I&#39;m sure we all hope<br/>\nto hear from you in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been lucky enough to get my wife to start playing recently. I scrounged<br/>\nup a 2nd computer so we can play side by side. It&#39;s made life a lot easier,<br/>\nhowever I haven&#39;t been playing Windleaf as often since I&#39;m playing a new<br/>\ncharacter along with her (I&#39;m a cleric, she&#39;s a ranger, both level 10 right<br/>\nnow). (We have a 9 month old daughter, but find time to play when she goes<br/>\nto sleep.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe both enjoy the game a lot and continue to meet very nice people and will<br/>\nkeep playing. Any game has problems, even non computer ones. (Heh, anyone<br/>\nplay Star Fleet Battles (pre-doomsday) or even Magic the Gathering? Talk<br/>\nabout rules problems. :-D )<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the unique thing about Everquest is that I can play cooperatively with<br/>\nmy friends. I&#39;m a pretty competitive guy, and my friends (and wife) were<br/>\ngetting tired of me clobbering them in games (cruel Magic the Gathering<br/>\ndecks and ruthless Star Fleet Battles tactics). So despite any flaws of<br/>\nEverquest, this is the game that I&#39;m going to continue to play. Makes my<br/>\nfriends and my wife much happier. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 23, 2000 10:21 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Harmonic and the future.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First off, Ryan, I think you made the right decision ;)  My <br/>\n&gt; GF and I have <br/>\n&gt; had to make concessions to my current 96 hour-a-week schedule (which <br/>\n&gt; included getting her a job here so we see each other more often <br/>\n&gt; *grins*).  I also haven&#39;t played EQ in 2 weeks, and haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; logged more <br/>\n&gt; than 10 hours in the last 3 months.  I have been playing AC a <br/>\n&gt; bit lately <br/>\n&gt; (Valentine&#39;s day present from the GF), and am disturbed to <br/>\n&gt; discover that I <br/>\n&gt; actually like it.  It seems a lot more laid back (of course, <br/>\n&gt; so does EQ at <br/>\n&gt; lower levels).  The graphics aren&#39;t as nice - and I&#39;m all <br/>\n&gt; about graphics - <br/>\n&gt; but the dynamics are really great.<br/>\n&gt; I dunno - I&#39;ll probably just keep bouncing from game to game. <br/>\n&gt;  Maybe some <br/>\n&gt; day someone will make one that everyone likes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 12:45 PM 2/23/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   First of all, I&#39;m still around, I read you all everyday. =D<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I haven&#39;t played Everquest in about 2 weeks now.  I may not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   play Everquest again.  In short, the game was taking away time<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I needed to spend working and most importantly taking care of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   my girlfriend.  For almost 14 months (since beta 3) she has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   endured 6-8 hour sessions of EQ on a daily basis.  Clearly,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   the game came before she did in all cases.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Everquest wasn&#39;t that great either, I know I complained about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   it often, but I&#39;d keep coming back for the people when I could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   have turned and looked 5 feet beside me and spent time with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that one person who counted.  Everquest/Verant are full of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   shortcomings and I kept hoping that things would finally get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;work properly&#39; - but that was just a dream.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I want to play again, just not now.  Things are going very well<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   right now and I don&#39;t want to bring back the frustration that EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   caused me.  I&#39;ll read the posts here where relevant, but I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   post much.  I&#39;ve got big work projects demanding more and more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   time.  I&#39;ve also got a kitten and a beautiful girlfriend demanding<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   more time as well.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to return <br/>\n&gt; and play the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   length of time I once played.  But I hope to return soon, maybe in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   a few more weeks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Harmonic Distortion, 50th unchained melody.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Ryan.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   +=================================+<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   | Ryan Honeyman, Programmer      /<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   | Decipher, Web Group           /<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.decipher.com\">http://www.decipher.com</a>      /<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   +-----------------------------+<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   | phone&gt; 757.664.1126        /<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   | pager&gt; 757.629.1567       /<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   +==========================+<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; -----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
