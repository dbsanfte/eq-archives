If you don&#39;t, I can <br/>\n&gt; &gt;guarantee you&#39;ll have a very difficult time getting groups <br/>\n&gt; &gt;as you advance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, because I disagree with you and then you rattle off a <br/>\n&gt; comment like above will make me say this.  I am one of the <br/>\n&gt; more popular 2nd wave bards on our server.  No one has ever<br/>\n&gt; questioned my tactics, and I have people immediately asking<br/>\n&gt; me to join up with them.  Druids and rangers are NOT typically<br/>\n&gt; extremely intelligent people, and either like to pure melee<br/>\n&gt; or pure burn/heal.  The bard has always been stuck with making<br/>\n&gt; many songs work to their advantage, where other classes specialize<br/>\n&gt; in one or two areas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Druids don&#39;t group much.  They solo anything they can.<br/>\n&gt;    I&#39;ve been in group with druids about 5% of the time I<br/>\n&gt;    play EQ.  And half of that 5% was with you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) Rangers are melee people.  Their spells are for the extra<br/>\n&gt;    utility perks.  They are not the best casters, I often see<br/>\n&gt;    the snare spell cast (the green/yellow flying circles) and<br/>\n&gt;    almost always see a full resist.  (ie: no snare message)<br/>\n&gt;    I don&#39;t have time to wait for the snare to kick in.  I<br/>\n&gt;    do not get resisted that often on chains.  I miss more notes,<br/>\n&gt;    than I get resists.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) In the last two weeks, my steady group DOES NOT have a<br/>\n&gt;    druid or ranger.  Tactics change based on the group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...and all this speculation about breaking out of chains,<br/>\n&gt; I think you should get your bard to level 23 and then come<br/>\n&gt; back to the table, J.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In cazicthule, I can chain blue defenders/sentinels and it lasts<br/>\n&gt; the whole battle (~20 secs), without reapplication.  Yellow/Red<br/>\n&gt; zealots, judicators... different story... however, once I chain<br/>\n&gt; them near the end of the battle - they do not move.  This may<br/>\n&gt; takes four or fives resists, but the end goal is to stop runners.<br/>\n&gt; And I accomplish this without ANY problems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>\n&gt; League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
