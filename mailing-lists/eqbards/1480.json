Could anyone<br/>\noffer any suggestions for a 10th level, sigh was 11th once, bard to really<br/>\nearn some coin?  I have found it difficult to make much as most of the<br/>\ncritters I get xp from are terribly cash poor in terms of loot available.  I<br/>\nhave a monk friend so can take on stuff slightly more powerful than I alone.<br/>\nAll suggestions welcomed!<br/>\n<br/>\nwait...almost all...if someone shouts kill snakes I think I&#39;ll scream...<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Kitasi<br/>\n     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n      &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>\n       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>\n     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>\n        and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\noops, looks like I&#39;ll be working for money, kust more proof the world&#39;s not<br/>\nperfect };-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
