Oasis has sand giants wandering<br/>\nthrough it, Karana has griffins flying through it.  There&#39;s<br/>\none at Lavastorm, which is a bit safer but nearly impossible<br/>\nto find.  The Lavastorm camp is also the only one with the<br/>\nblunt combine weapons and the combine spear and rapier.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever been to the camp in Rathe Lake.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost bards tend to get the best prices or close to it, so I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t fret so much over the cost.  When you outgrow it, you<br/>\ncan either sell it to a player, or sell it to a merchant and<br/>\nonly take a 10%-15% loss.  So even though a combine rapier<br/>\ncost me 52.5pp, I can sell it back for 47.681pp, thus it&#39;s<br/>\nlike I&#39;ve only paid 5pp to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
