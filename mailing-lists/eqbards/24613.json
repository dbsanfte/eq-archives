I don&#39;t go to SCA lengths but try to<br/>\nmake period pieces that look authentic without spending a ton. They come in<br/>\nhandy at Halloween and when we go to the Medival Faires also.<br/>\nSnicker&#39;s Amtgard site was long the memory tag I searched for to find the<br/>\nearly EQ bard song lists also. There is/was a link off his site.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal: no mask yet?! Be sure and hang around and try for a bag off the<br/>\nsupplier. Same room and it&#39;s his common drop.
