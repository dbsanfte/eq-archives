This is an important issue to you<br/>\nsister-bards, be supportive or delete the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night after I was killed by a Sand Giant & the party scattered in the Oasis,<br/>\na male wood druid who lived & I were the first to make it back to where we were<br/>\ncamped.  He make the usual naked helf/ drool emote so I turn to face him as he<br/>\nwas dressed & could stand guard. I start to loot my body, but I guess he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nwatching for SG&#39;s because he does the standard &quot;MM behind you&quot; warning, but as my<br/>\nslow computer won&#39;t let me out of the window, I don&#39;t see the ....hits you....<br/>\nmessages I am expecting.  No Madman, I was just facing so he couldn&#39;t see my butt<br/>\n& he wanted me to turn around in panic.  It is enough of a problem, that my<br/>\n1/2ling niece was started yelling a guys to leave me alone, that her uncle<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t like it, after they didn&#39;t get the hint when I tell them I&#39;m happily<br/>\nmarried.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; and, to make this bard related... I think the bard class and the cleric<br/>\n&gt; class appeal most to females because of their cooperative roles and their<br/>\n&gt; ability to make others around them stronger... agree?  disagree? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
