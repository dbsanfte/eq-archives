Mainly because I couldn&#39;t decide which one to use, so I decided to use both.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut... since I set my strength to a low 75, I&#39;m not much for melee, even while twisting Chant and the Warsong. 110 dexterity means I don&#39;t get hit often though. And now that I can use instruments, my biggest strength seems to be my songs (well, obviously. But very markedly different comared to my poor melee)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question, how much more effective will training Hand to Hand make me while wielding an instrument? I&#39;d like to be able to help out a bit.. Right now I&#39;m holding my lute, playing Hymn of Restoration, and punching jackals, pumas, and orcs to death in Northern Ro, and have reached 26 total skill in Hand to Hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to go along with that, what exactly does increased skill do? Is it purely chance-to-hit, or does it increase damage as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nCypress, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
