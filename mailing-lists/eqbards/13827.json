It simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>\n&gt;could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>\n&gt;characters, each on a different server:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my first character ever)<br/>\n&gt;Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>\n&gt;Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>\n&gt;I just have to know what the play time is on a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>\n&gt;characters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>\n&gt;than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?  I&#39;m not trolling...just bloody<br/>\n&gt;well amazed and curious (and obviously jealous).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*******************************************************<br/>\n&gt;          Windsinger Legendmaker on Innorouk<br/>\n&gt;               The Wayward Travelers<br/>\n&gt;   Friends are a Bard&#39;s Best Defense!<br/>\n&gt;*******************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Get what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
