We know what<br/>\nhappens in virtually every zone of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen any of us group with our bards ( 40plus ) in<br/>\nburning woods we have an EXTREMELY hard time keeping<br/>\nthe mobs off him/her. Its like a flag pops up that<br/>\nsays Bard in the zone - get him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact it has become so  bad that the bard has to<br/>\ncamp after every aggro attack. That seems to help a<br/>\nbit. We dont even bother to pull - the mobs just<br/>\ncharge at us. So now what happens is that the groups<br/>\nrather prefer the enchanters - which really turns<br/>\neverything into a nightmare for the bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same group without a bard - with enchanter- has<br/>\nnowhere near the amount of aggro&#39;s to deal with. In<br/>\nfact at a specific loc it is relatively safe and no<br/>\nMOBS wander close - untill the bard joins. Then the<br/>\nwhole zone wants to visit the previously relatively<br/>\nsafe loc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow - we ramble on dont we - anyhow - back to my own<br/>\nbard - experienced something similar in everfrost last<br/>\nnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI normally fight down by the south tower killing<br/>\nMammoths. Barb warriors love grouping with me cause I<br/>\ncan regen ( note not heal ) and it reduces their down<br/>\ntime dramatically .<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I get to the south tower - Orc Shaman charges me -<br/>\nliterally running over other players to get at me. Not<br/>\na big problem - Selos up and Mistmoore Battledrum (<br/>\ntwink is such a nasty word) and off I go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI run all the way to the One Guard and sit there and<br/>\nnothing happens so I go back. I get to the tower and<br/>\nTHREE shamans come charging for me. Okay now it gets<br/>\nhairy but I survive and run back to 1 Guard and camp<br/>\ntrying to clear the hate list.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I get to the tower and all my friends ask me what<br/>\ndid I do to the shamans that they are so heavily aggro<br/>\nonto me. They all can stand there relataively close to<br/>\nthe shaman and nothing will happen. As soon as I (<br/>\nbard) get close all the shamans gun for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say- this is making my bardic experiences<br/>\nturn into survival experiences. And therefore really<br/>\nmaking my bard life a hard one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I am really advocating is - why should we be<br/>\non the TOP of every zone hate list ? My<br/>\nranger/wizard/enchanter and necro dont have these<br/>\nproblems and therefore level much faster than my bard.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I am having the Bardic Blues and really cant<br/>\nfigure out how some of you got past level 50 while<br/>\nbeing the most wanted beings in Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaters,<br/>\nSonger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
