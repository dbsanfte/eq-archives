The king room solo isn&#39;t an<br/>\noption since Borxx (named evil eye) is level 32, few HP but he hits for 70s.<br/>\nThe knight room is possible if most of them don&#39;t agro based on level. With<br/>\nthe exception of Borxx nothing in there should present a problem solo but<br/>\nit&#39;s getting swarmed that&#39;s a problem. I do recall my ranger (on corpse<br/>\nrecovery run) was able to get just outside the king room at 29th level and<br/>\nnot agro those goblins outside. The Elites and king would have gone agro for<br/>\nsure though.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott/Reedwind<br/>\n16th level Bard<br/>\nBertoxx </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
