Bummer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t do any hard number crunching test with it, but it <br/>\n&gt; did not appear to<br/>\n&gt; be significantly improved as far as damage goes when sung so <br/>\n&gt; I switched to<br/>\n&gt; the drum (normal hand drum, I am not yet among the lucky <br/>\n&gt; battle bangers) and<br/>\n&gt; tried it and the damage seemed significant, appeared to do <br/>\n&gt; around 50 damage<br/>\n&gt; total over the duration of the DoT (I targeted myself and was <br/>\n&gt; having much<br/>\n&gt; lag and PL last night so the results cant be considered very <br/>\n&gt; accurate but<br/>\n&gt; only approximate).  I&#39;m guessing this is similar to the <br/>\n&gt; difference between<br/>\n&gt; singing DD and playing it with a brass horn, night and day as someone<br/>\n&gt; recently noted.  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
