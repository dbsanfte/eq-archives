Doubt we ll","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-533213287\">I would guess that the system you proposed would make a lot of people happy,<br/>\nboth those with lots of time to play as well as the casual gamers.  Doubt<br/>\nwe&#39;ll ever see it implemented though.  Abashi already posted that the people<br/>\nwho play more should be the ones who get the best items.  What is the cost<br/>\nof getting those items though?  I joined a group in the assasin room last<br/>\nnight.  Three of the group members had been in the assasin room over 10<br/>\nhours in hopes of looting a thick banded belt from the supplier for their<br/>\ncharacter.  The group leader took vacation from work for the next three days<br/>\nso he could camp the supplier until he got a TBB.  He had been in the room<br/>\nfor over 16 hours straight.  He said the supplier had spawned 15 times since<br/>\nhe had been there and not once did it drop a TBB.  The idea of having fun<br/>\nwas even in the equation anymore.  Not that my wife would ever let me play<br/>\nthat many hours straight, but I can&#39;t see myself ever camping that long for<br/>\nan item.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted it in a while.  Basically, it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; way to end camping.  Every named mob is always spawned, but<br/>\n&gt; you can only kill/loot it once in your character&#39;s lifetime.  <br/>\n&gt; Item rarity is then determined by the frequency of the item<br/>\n&gt; appearing on that mob.  As it is now, item rarity is<br/>\n&gt; determined by the the number of players willing to camp the<br/>\n&gt; mob for umpteen hours to get the item.  That would get the<br/>\n&gt; special items more evenly distributed among the playerbase,<br/>\n&gt; rather than having them concentrated in the hands of those<br/>\n&gt; with prodigious amounts of otherwise fruitless camping time.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;d also stop farming and eBay selling cold.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are some other changes minor needed to make it work<br/>\n&gt; properly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
