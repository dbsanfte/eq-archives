We rounded up<br/>\nour crew and some friends.  We had a great time clearing to the Lair. We had<br/>\n5 groups and sent 2 of them back to the Stone Spider room to lessen lag and<br/>\nkeep it clear for the ones who were arriving later. Only one death along the<br/>\nway, our monk puller brought the FG wiz, war, and Magi - got stunned too<br/>\nmuch to successfully feign and went down.  We got mask and crown (crown of<br/>\nKing Tranix is NOT no drop btw.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the hour long re-group and buff session as we assembled the full crew.<br/>\nFinally, we are ready to make the charge when &lt;you have been disconnected&gt;<br/>\nLog back in, click on char to re-enter zone and &lt;that zone is not available&gt;<br/>\nGrrr.  Now here is where you should have a chat room pre-assigned or log<br/>\nyour twink.  But -wth- lets just try it again.  Kinda fun entering a fully<br/>\npopulated Dragon Lair!  Kinda bad seeing 30 or 40 corpses strewn all over in<br/>\nthe few brief seconds you have before getting smooshed.  Virtually<br/>\n_everyone_ in the zone died. All the dragon hunters and all the Doggie<br/>\ncampers broke camp back into a fully populated zone.  Grrr. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so now I re-spawn at the spires in Gfay and start to hear the really<br/>\nugly stories from the casters who were binded in the lair.  Some took 5 and<br/>\n6 deaths before they could /q out.  Levels lost, 4 and 5 bubs lost. Camii<br/>\n(our server&#39;s head GM) comes to the zone and solos everything but the<br/>\ndragon.  More guides come and summon ppl from rocks, walls and lava. Someone<br/>\nsays to contact &quot;somename&quot; and report your exp loses.  No one reports any<br/>\nexp being restored by GM&#39;s or Guides - we were all told &#39;sorry, cant help<br/>\nyou.&quot;  Lev 50 clerics otoh were busy doing what they could.  I do applaud<br/>\nour guides and GM&#39;s for doing the best they could with a really bad<br/>\nsituation - they deserve a lot of credit for the thankless work they do. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people had to go at this point and they gated or got gated while the<br/>\nrest of us re-assembled and re-buffed.  By now we have heard rumors from the<br/>\nother server that FoH fought Naggy and found that he will strip your buffs.<br/>\nNever-the-less, we buff up and get ready.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe plan is half of the groups will go in and make the initial attack while<br/>\nthe other half wait away from the fight and out of sight.  This works fairly<br/>\nwell.  The first group took him down to about 80% before we got the call to<br/>\ncharge!  In we went and I played ele & guardian, dropping to ele only when<br/>\nit got too laggy.  I stood near my cleric and saw several resist messages<br/>\nand took no fear - not even partials.  My cleric stood his ground as well.<br/>\nUnfortuantely, our tanks roamer out of song range and were getting partial<br/>\nresists and short fears.  &lt;sigh&gt; if they would only listen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe fight and fight and slowly he drops his hp.  He is getting down to 20%<br/>\nnow and my cleric calls OOM.  I look up and see only 2 or 3 tanks on the<br/>\nDragon and think... hmm well he is below 20 and dropping, he is not casting,<br/>\nyou have 2 Yks... <br/>\n<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:13 2000] Lord Nagafen says &#39;You will not evade me Moods&#39;<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:13 2000] Moods has been slain by Lord Nagafen!<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:15 2000] <br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:15 2000] You feel an aura of elemental protection surround<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:15 2000] <br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:17 2000] Xaera tells the group, &#39;something is bugged&#39;  (X<br/>\nwas frozen and not swinging her sword)<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:17 2000] You are no longer afraid.<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:18 2000] Auto attack on.<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:19 2000] You slash Lord Nagafen for 1 point of damage.<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:19 2000] Xaera tells the group, &#39;there we go&#39;<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:21 2000] <br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:21 2000] You feel an aura of elemental protection surround<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:21 2000] <br/>\n[Thu Jan 20 23:10:22 2000] Your song ends.

More than half the battle is clearing<br/>\nto the Lair.  You will get multi-giant pulls.  <br/>\n3.\tDragon-wear is now more important than ever.  Camp that Frog King,<br/>\nfarm some crowns.  Resistance is not futile and with buff stripping, your<br/>\nbase is gonna matter more.<br/>\n4.\tBards are key but their value is lost if the group spreads out of<br/>\nsong range.  Keep the group in close proximity to each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 42nd song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Here is a clip from &quot;Suana&quot; who posted this to our (Innoruuk) server<br/>\nlist (he tends to rant a bit  but I think his observations are good)<br/>\n<br/>\n[begin clip]<br/>\nHere is some of the ninja-patching we found:<br/>\n1) SoundBlaster Live now causes you to crash to windows periodically.<br/>\nApparently programmed to do it just as King Tranix is trying to pound you<br/>\ninto Paste.  Additional side effect totally uninstalls certain components<br/>\nand corrupts the associated .DLL files.<br/>\n2) Lord Nagafen got a HP boost AGAIN<br/>\n3) Lord Nagafen had a resistance boost to match the resist debuff built into<br/>\nthe wizard class.  That&#39;s what I gathered from watching him shrug off all<br/>\nthose Ice Comets.<br/>\n4) Lord Nagafen&#39;s breath attack now does damage whether you resist it or<br/>\nnot.  Resisting only seems to save you half the damage.  The test?  (some<br/>\ncomment about getting burned here)<br/>\nYou have resisted the DragonBreath spell!<br/>\nYou have been slain by Lord Nagafen!<br/>\n5) Apparently, they felt dragons still didn&#39;t regenerate fast enough in a<br/>\ncombat, and took steps.<br/>\n6) Dragon fear seems to have been upgraded AGAIN.<br/>\n<br/>\n[end clip]  Those are Suana&#39;s observations - fwiw.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
