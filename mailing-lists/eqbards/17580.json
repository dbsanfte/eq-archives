(Yes,<br/>\nTalies, I realize you are also on Bristlebane)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just hit 27, so I have been experimenting with<br/>\ncharm... Perhaps a bit of an unorthodox use but here<br/>\nis what ive been doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get on a list for a high keep group... Then for the<br/>\nnext 2 hours, I have to do something... So I either do<br/>\nbaking, brewing, or lately, I&#39;ve taken to helping an<br/>\nenchanter friend lvl (he hit 19 last night) We go to<br/>\norc side and stand a bit away from the crowd, when<br/>\nsomething spawns and hits me first (has to hit me<br/>\notherwise my enchanter friends ethics cause him to<br/>\nthink we are ks&#39;ing) I charm it /pet follow over to<br/>\nthe area away from the fighting. I then beat on it,<br/>\ntill three quarters dead (or keep it charmed so the<br/>\nother ppl cant steal it...) and then my friend mem<br/>\nblurs it and finishes it off..  Really slow because he<br/>\nkeeps giving the orcs away, so ppl wont think we are<br/>\nks&#39;ing<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Spz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spz@...\">spz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Everyone!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With the arrival of level 26 and Area effect Fear,<br/>\n&gt; my strategy will most<br/>\n&gt; likely change.
