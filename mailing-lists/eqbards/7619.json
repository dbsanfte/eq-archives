They can both bind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bard is a toss-up, but if it comes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; down to it can be classified a hybrid just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; by default not being in another category.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With this logic, then you must also agree that<br/>\n&gt;a cleric and a shaman are hybrids as they by<br/>\n&gt;default do not belong in the pure caster or the<br/>\n&gt;pure fighter categories.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You are either a caster, a fighter or a mix.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
