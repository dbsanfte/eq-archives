First<br/>\noff let me state that my main character is a necro, lev 52 and that my bard<br/>\nlev 36 has been on the shelf for over 6 months. I dunno about all of you but<br/>\ni find 50+ levels to be extremely depressing, i feel like im taking one step<br/>\nforward 2 steps back. I find that in general all classes become extremely<br/>\npowerfull over 50 but its brain numbing repetition. I been playing my little<br/>\nwarrior (almost 14 with 400hp weeee). Its kinda cool to play a warrior, i<br/>\ndid 2 crippling blows in a row for 96 dmg to a kodiak at lev 12, i was in<br/>\nshock. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyways, the reason im writing this is because im thinking of restarting<br/>\nmy bard, but he&#39;s nekked (i stripped him when i started my necro). You have<br/>\nanything that you could suggest to re-equip with that is easy to obtain with<br/>\nmy big boy necro? i need armor and weapons. He&#39;s got lambent arms or bracer<br/>\nstill, and shin pants and gloves and his mask still, and i think he has a<br/>\nbarbute too, not sure. I was thinkin of goin to guk to get a carapace maybe<br/>\nfor a bp till i get him something better. Any suggestions of something i can<br/>\nsolo easily with my necro to give to him?  and weapons.... all i have is a<br/>\nfs long sword hehe (if only my wakizashies on my ranger were not no drop).<br/>\nmaybe i could go terrorize the avatar of fear or something, but im hoping to<br/>\navoid the claw. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as i think its<br/>\ntime to take the dust off that old drummer boy. I think i&#39;d like to go to<br/>\nhate one day with that bard<br/>\n<br/>\nYour opinions/suggestions will not be taken lightly and will be greatly<br/>\nappreciated<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rakka 52 Dark elf Heretic<br/>\n-Minkin 36 wood-elf Bard<br/>\n-Tanqueray 14 half-elf warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.
