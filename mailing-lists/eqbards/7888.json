I really need [Silk] to do<br/>\nthat&quot;<br/>\n\tPlayer: &quot;What about Silk?&quot;<br/>\n\tKitasi: &quot;Bring me 4 Spider Silks and I will reward you with<br/>\nhandsomely&quot;<br/>\n\tPlayer: {Cool, a new quest lemme go find this guy some Spider Silks}<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIts amazing what players will do for a quest and blow off an<br/>\n/auction for the<br/>\n\texact same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Operaman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 2:49 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Operaman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you got a Bracer of Erolissi for 5pp you should already consider<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yourself<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rewarded, great job!

I think, perhaps, that the druid used the sale as a way<br/>\nto gauge my newbie-ness and sincerity. When he saw that I was truly<br/>\nignorant, but honest, he knew he could trust me to hold his fortune for him<br/>\nwhile he switched characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like other ideas I&#39;ve seen here and elsewhere to create mini-quests for<br/>\nlower-levels so you and they feel they have earned their reward. It adds<br/>\nroleplay and fun to the process, and weeds out the greedy, get-rich-quick<br/>\ntypes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nMeandering Maestro<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
