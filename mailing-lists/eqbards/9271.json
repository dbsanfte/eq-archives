I told him good luck<br/>\ngetting that much, so he asked me how much I&#39;d pay. I said 15pp for loot<br/>\nrights and 50pp to buy in a city. He, a 35th lvl monk, said that was<br/>\nridiculous because the stone came from a 30+ level mob. I countered with<br/>\n&quot;yes, but they&#39;re lore.

Like I said, in a typical night of hunting giants,<br/>\n&gt; everyone in my group will get a stone (we did this twice).<br/>\n&gt; Given the rate they drop, I&#39;d value them at around 10-15pp.<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;d have to be nuts to expect 150pp one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other classes can use the stones.  There is a quest for some<br/>\n&gt; sort of staff that uses the stones, and the bard armor is not<br/>\n&gt; no-drop so could be traded/twinked.  Dunno if other classes<br/>\n&gt; can do the quests.  Still, I&#39;d expect it to soon become like<br/>\n&gt; crafted armor, where the resulting armor sells for a little<br/>\n&gt; above or even below the cost of the gems to complete the<br/>\n&gt; quest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
