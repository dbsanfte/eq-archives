He is a real font of wisdom,<br/>\nsending me an e-mail like this. So sad. now I guess I&#39;ll go cower in the<br/>\ncorner because this ranting loon didn&#39;t like my post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ugh. this post I find very undesirable reading. I think opinions about<br/>\n&gt; Verant&#39;s quality should be left off this list. The start of this thread<br/>\n&gt; was basically a request to keep things from being a &quot;flame Verant&quot; event<br/>\n&gt; if I understood correctly. This entire post was nothing but a long rant,<br/>\n&gt; and just showed to drive the orginial poster&#39;s point home. If your<br/>\n&gt; intent is to drive people away from reading eqbards that want to learn<br/>\n&gt; more about the bard class, you are succeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Give me a f*cking break, don&#39;t ever post sh*t like that again.<br/>\n  If you have a problem with me address it to me.  I&#39;m growing<br/>\n  very tired of you Verant a**kissers.  That clear enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Use your power, and press the delete key, because you are the naive<br/>\n  one here buddy.  I for one don&#39;t give a sh*t about what you think<br/>\n  after that kind of bashing. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  btw, have a nice day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
