Most<br/>\nmanagers I worked for would put the date-reported on their bug list.  We<br/>\nwould produce &quot;Aging&quot; Reports showing not just the severity of the bug<br/>\n(perhaps 1-10 or High Medium Low).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best manager I worked for would automatically bump the priority up one<br/>\nlevel for any bug that sat on the list for more than 3 months.  So he<br/>\nexpected even a trivial bug to be fixed within 6 months (and usually lows<br/>\nwere things like a heading not centered properly on a report).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the Tambourine - I&#39;m very happy that they added the graphic for<br/>\nit - but keep in mind the animation is still just as bad.  I was admiring my<br/>\ntwo new pieces of armor I got last night (traded the 3 wurmslayer scales for<br/>\nSinging Steel Gloves and got a Hero&#39;s Bracer) - watching the animation.<br/>\nWith the Tambourine - you basically are shaking it in a strange spot in your<br/>\nleft hand - and playing air guitar on your right.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote to Verant - professional musicians can play instruments - so we don&#39;t<br/>\nplay air guitar...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rebecca Small [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsmall@...\">rsmall@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 12, 2000 8:45 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Drum model and stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\ntime the issue was outstanding.
