You could, at\r<br/>\n&gt; level 30, walk around in unrest pretty much unperturbed by ANY of the\r<br/>\n&gt; undead simply because they won&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re so far above\r<br/>\n&gt; them in level. Just because an undead critter doesn&#39;t attack doesn&#39;t mean\r<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re invisible to them. Try using clouding then CONNING the undead. They\r<br/>\n&gt; still con as &#39;ready to attack&#39;. Which means they can see you. They just\r<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t agg because you are higher level than them.
