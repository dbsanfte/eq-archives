I have <br/>\n     bought all the pieces that I need or want from other players for no <br/>\n     more then 2pp per ac, sometimes less (got a great discount from a <br/>\n     fellow Bard on this list, thanks again!)  So that would make a <br/>\n     breastplate only 34pp.  A fraction of what Iron costs.  I had all I <br/>\n     wanted by 19th level, no twinking.  So If you really want bronze earn <br/>\n     some money hunting wisps, aviaks, or whatever and go to freeport or <br/>\n     kelethin (auction central) and buy some on a busy weekend night. <br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold (the non-camper/slowest leveler in all of EQ)<br/>\n     20th xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Medium Bronze Armor (Spoiler)<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-jhenders (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    9/20/99 10:08 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n     <br/>\n[possible spoiler warning]<br/>\n     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Sep 20/99, Chris Musson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...\">oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: Chris Musson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...\">oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There seemed to be some confusion this weekend about Medium Bronze Armor on th<br/>\ne<br/>\n&gt; list. <br/>\n[...]<br/>\n&gt; I got my Med Bronze breastplate from Perma, however i did buy the Hat (ick) an<br/>\nd<br/>\n&gt; Legs, because i am too much of a not-camper to sit in a dungeon that long.<br/>\n     <br/>\nMy understanding was that the only mobs in Perma that dropped bronze <br/>\nwere the elite guards at the back by the diplomat. At L19 I would have <br/>\nthought that they might be a bit hard to reach, even with a full party. <br/>\nIs this not the case? This dungeon wasn&#39;t even itemized until I was in <br/>\nmy 30&#39;s so I didn&#39;t get to play there much except for a trip to pick up <br/>\na crystalline blade and a couple of aborted Vox attempts.<br/>\n     <br/>\n&gt; -----<br/>\n&gt; To add to the stuff about what to wear, i think that (based on stats) the only<br/>\n&gt; Bronze worth wearing are the 3 pieces listed above.  All the other pieces are <br/>\n&gt; just 1 point better than Banded (i think) and REALLY HEAVY.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n     <br/>\nThey do, however, make a big difference, according to what I&#39;ve heard. <br/>\nWasn&#39;t it on this list where someone said they definately knew that <br/>\ndifferent armor types provided different protection, independent of the <br/>\nAC value? I remember someone saying a Programmer GM had grabbed him or a <br/>\nfriend in beta and equipped him in various armor to test this.<br/>\n     <br/>\nA few other sources of medium bronze I&#39;ve heard are, Guards in HighPass <br/>\nand some mobs in Mistmoore.<br/>\n     <br/>\nRegardless, the point still stands that medium bronze is totally <br/>\nunattainable by characters off mobs at anywhere close to the level that <br/>\nsmall bronze is.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
