Another bard and I both picked up one in a<br/>\nmatter of just a few hours, dropping of enticing sirens (L50-53ish) or siren<br/>\nseductresses (L56-57ish).  The shell itself is MAGIC ITEM it says, but both<br/>\nof us found that it added nothing to our numbers. The 5% stated here I think<br/>\nwould&#39;ve shown on Berserker&#39;s Crescendo at least a little, but we were using<br/>\nraw data really, producing hasty field resluts. I can do more extensive<br/>\ninvestigation on it, time permitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, I haven&#39;t researched it online anywhere, but I did notice it<br/>\nhad a weight of like 4.5 iirc.  And for the graphic being the same, there<br/>\nshould be some sort of stat enhancement, you&#39;d think. The store-bought horn<br/>\nweighs far less, adding the same result to the song. If this horn isn&#39;t in<br/>\nyour weight reducing bag, you could become encumbered quickly. =/<br/>\n<br/>\nOff Topic...<br/>\nHas anyone killed the named siren type mobs down there, the ones past the<br/>\nseductresses and icy servants? I recall there being 2 right near each other,<br/>\nand another yet on track somewhere.  I was using bind sight on our 59<br/>\npulling monk, and he said splitting those broads was the hardest pulls he&#39;s<br/>\never had to do. He said that when he FD&#39;d, the mobs wouldn&#39;t split, they<br/>\nwould *both* immediately start walking back to their spawn points. Anyway,<br/>\nsomehow he did pull just one, and she was quite rough, the usual quad<br/>\nhitting, summoning type mob (red to me at 55), and wouldn&#39;t stun for<br/>\nanything.  Well she ended up gating back, and bringing all her friends of<br/>\ncourse, then CH&#39;d - fun! That was attempt 3 btw, and the only time we had<br/>\njust one mob. We packed it up after that ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nPava<br/>\nCT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
