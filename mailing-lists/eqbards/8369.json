And<br/>\ni agree,  when i had my newbie troll i found that most of the trolls and<br/>\nogres i met were very friendly, then again, most newbies are as they havent<br/>\nbeen exposed to kill stealing dungeons yet where they lose their innocence. <br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  sage-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tRenee Cole [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nat_ive@...\">nat_ive@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tOctober 8, 1999 4:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Is eq sexual harrasment racist?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Renee Cole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nat_ive@...\">nat_ive@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;OK time for a new wrinkle on the stalker issue, have any of you who play <br/>\n&gt; &gt;female characters noticed a trend in the race of the stalkers?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can&#39;t say as I&#39;ve ever had much of a problem with stalkers.  Had one high <br/>\n&gt; elf try it once with my wood elf druid.  I sent him a tell that if he<br/>\n&gt; didnt <br/>\n&gt; stop it ASAP, i would /report him.  He apologized quickly and never I<br/>\n&gt; heard <br/>\n&gt; from him again.  I am female in RL, btw.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Never had the problem on my wood elf bard from strangers.  Get lots of <br/>\n&gt; teasing from flirting from the male members of my guild.  But since I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; known most of them for 3 RL years, its not quite the same thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing I have noticed: for some reason, seems like more wood elves and <br/>\n&gt; high elves have attitude problems than the other races.  Wood elf male<br/>\n&gt; bards <br/>\n&gt; being the worst. Of course, this is a subjective opinion.  One thing for <br/>\n&gt; sure though, soon as my wood elf characters were old enough to travel, I <br/>\n&gt; left Fedwyr and rarely go back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for Trolls and Ogres, I&#39;ve found them to be some of the nicest folks <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d want to be around, so long as you can overlook their disgusting <br/>\n&gt; personal habits ;-P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
