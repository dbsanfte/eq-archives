Even so, a number <br/>\nof changes and additions were made in today&#39;s patch.  Most of the changes <br/>\nare in regards to quests:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The &quot;Fleshy Orb&quot; quest has been completed<br/>\n- We&#39;ve received word that &quot;Fabian&quot; has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br/>\n- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br/>\n- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br/>\n- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost <br/>\nCircle.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few items have also been changed this week:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br/>\n- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a <br/>\nshort casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<br/>\n- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when <br/>\nyou log off (See Below.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br/>\n<br/>\nWe received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to <br/>\n&quot;spam&quot; other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to <br/>\ndisconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages <br/>\ncaused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out <br/>\nspell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the <br/>\ntargetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have <br/>\nto stand still to use them now.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Gunthak Harpoon*<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon <br/>\n&quot;rentable&quot;, meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one <br/>\nof our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it <br/>\nmust be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats <br/>\non this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical <br/>\ncomposition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in <br/>\nobtaining it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the <br/>\nnext time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect <br/>\nweapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it <br/>\nwithin the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Chat / Login Process*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning <br/>\nthat players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of <br/>\npeople in the chat server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
