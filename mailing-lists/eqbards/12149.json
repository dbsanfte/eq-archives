This is not to mention the ridiculous trips you need to take to <br/>\nmanufacture small (and, even worse, large) banded.  Or incredible <br/>\nannoyance of juggling lots of junk in your Bank inventory.  Or the long <br/>\nand involved conversations you end up having with people who decide that <br/>\nthey really don&#39;t want anything, or who want the item at cost, or who <br/>\nwere pricing things out for a friend (who won&#39;t on until Thursday), or <br/>\nthe people who think you&#39;re ripping them off and do zone-wide /shouts <br/>\ninsulting your integrity...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I managed to be enough in front of the wave that I made a <br/>\nreasonable profit, but I sure did trade off a lot of exp to get it.
