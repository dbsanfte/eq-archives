You might be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tempted to think wow, with a DSL I can zone in 10 secs!

This was also the case for<br/>\n&gt; Diablo - copying the CD to hard disk only helped to a point,<br/>\n&gt; but upgrading the CPU helped tremendously.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; FWIW, on my cable modem and 450 Celeron (OC) with 128MB RAM,<br/>\n&gt; it takes from 15-35 seconds to zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, on to ping.

Speaking<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience (I&#39;m a network programming and sysadmin), opening a socket is<br/>\n&gt; FAR<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more reliable.  I&#39;ve got a really quick and dirty pong program which<br/>\n&gt; does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just this as well as dumping out oodles of other interesting network<br/>\n&gt; info.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, comparing ping times for the same route (assuming<br/>\n&gt; relatively constant Internet traffic) using two different<br/>\n&gt; modems *will* tell you the relative performance of those two<br/>\n&gt; modems, since the times across all the other hops should stay<br/>\n&gt; roughly the same.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
