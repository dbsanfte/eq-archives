I have been in a lot <br/>\n&gt; of groups with<br/>\n&gt; two bards and it is great.  I&#39;d love to get in a group with <br/>\n&gt; Galtin and you<br/>\n&gt; sometime I think we would be very deadly.  Although I think <br/>\n&gt; the enchanter<br/>\n&gt; would have found that using his two very cheap stun spells <br/>\n&gt; would have even<br/>\n&gt; made the slaughter more amusing.  Three bards would <br/>\n&gt; definitely be a hoot,<br/>\n&gt; good grief think of the clarity effects at 32!  Three bards <br/>\n&gt; and two nukers<br/>\n&gt; with an enchanter would be scary indeed.  I don&#39;t think two <br/>\n&gt; many servers<br/>\n&gt; have as many bards as we do on E&#39;ci though.  What guild are <br/>\n&gt; you in Gilgurth?<br/>\n&gt; I know between DoH, Armigers, and Grail Brotherhood we have <br/>\n&gt; almost a dozen<br/>\n&gt; bards over level 25.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi Faegehearper<br/>\n&gt; \tArmigers of Mirth<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daryl Schwemley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drs@...\">drs@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 29, 2000 2:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bards and Enchanters<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since some people think we bards are very limited when <br/>\n&gt; grouped with bards, I<br/>\n&gt; thought I would relate what happened to me Tuesday night.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I logged in, two of my guildmates (bard and enchanter) <br/>\n&gt; were grouped<br/>\n&gt; together with a warrior and another bard.  I was invited to <br/>\n&gt; join them.  So<br/>\n&gt; our group was 3 bards, warrior, and enchanter.  All of us <br/>\n&gt; bards were around<br/>\n&gt; level 25, so it worked out where we actually had enough songs <br/>\n&gt; for all of us<br/>\n&gt; to twist 3 songs each.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The enchanter was giving everyone alacrity, but other than <br/>\n&gt; that, he was just<br/>\n&gt; medding.  Why?  There was nothing else for him to really do.  <br/>\n&gt; He commented<br/>\n&gt; on that at one point, and my fellow bard guildmate said, <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Sit, med, enjoy<br/>\n&gt; the ride!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, in this group, it wasn&#39;t the bard who was useless, it was <br/>\n&gt; the enchanter.<br/>\n&gt; Just thought it was funny.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gilgurth<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 26 Winces<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Get Your FREE Online Credit Report!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5783/13/_/451022/_/962310493/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5783/13/_/451022/_/962310493/</a><br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Free @Backup service!
