I&#39;ve been waiting<br/>\na long time to ask these questions, hoping they would answer themselves on<br/>\nthe list, but I&#39;m still curious! (The list has of course answered MANY other<br/>\nquestions I had.) The FAQ that was sent to the list earlier is really good,<br/>\nand answered a lot of things I was wondering about, perhaps these questions<br/>\ncould be added to it. And yes, I looked in the archives, but they seem<br/>\nalmost impossible to search.<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\nAnyway, here goes. Sorry if these have been gone over already to death. :P<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\n1. What are a bard&#39;s more important stats for playing songs? I&#39;ve heard<br/>\nCharisma is important - does it make it so the songs are more potent or so<br/>\nthat they are resisted less?<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\n2. What is a good bard website?<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\n3. What is the best way to cycle songs? Basically what I&#39;m doing now is<br/>\nmaking a panel of hotkeys, then hitting 1 to start song, 1 again to stop, 2<br/>\nto start second song, 2 to stop, etc. But I kind of got the impression from<br/>\nthe list that using´┐¢ a /stop hotkey might be faster? (It is almost<br/>\nimpossible for more to cycle three songs.)<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\n4. Is it true bard 2h slash skill is capped at 1 (or something like that?)<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\nHmmm I guess that is it for now.<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\nThanks in advance! :)<br/>\n´┐¢<br/>\nDaleia<br/>\n10 Bard, Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
