In general, when<br/>\nI started the game at 110 charisma, I got the best possible<br/>\nprices at all merchants who were indifferent or higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve played, I&#39;ve noticed that several friends with<br/>\ncharisma around 90 were getting the same prices as me (or<br/>\nclose to) from merchants who were amiable or higher.  There<br/>\nare other instances which I haven&#39;t quite figured out yet<br/>\nwhich I&#39;m chalking up to race or diety for now.  But in<br/>\ngeneral, especially with the Charisma song, a chr of 90 or so<br/>\nshould be sufficient to get you the best prices from most any<br/>\nmerchant.  (For reference, best selling prices are: minotaur<br/>\naxe 3.33pp, greater lightstone 4.3?pp, bronze 2H sword 4pp,<br/>\ncombine rapier/longsword 47.621pp; best buying prices are:<br/>\ncombine rapier/longsword 52.5pp)<br/>\n<br/>\nCharisma definitely affects the duration of charm type songs<br/>\n(Lament, Charisma, etc).  Other people here seem to complain<br/>\nabout the effect not lasting long enough for them to finish<br/>\nlamenting all the mobs, or for them to buy/sell an item.  My<br/>\nexperience with 110 (120 now) charisma has been that the<br/>\neffects of these songs last several minutes, even when played<br/>\nwithout an instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharisma is also rumored to affect the chance of certain songs<br/>\nbeing resisted.  I&#39;ve seen no evidence to back this up, other<br/>\nthan a general observation that I find the Lullaby to be a<br/>\ngreat song to use, while others seem to feel it gets resisted<br/>\ntoo often.  Several enchanters also swear that charisma<br/>\ndecreases their resist rate, while others swear that it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, if I were starting a new bard knowing what I know<br/>\nnow, I&#39;d probably distribute my points equally between str,<br/>\ndex, chr, and maybe agi.  I hadn&#39;t really intended to play a<br/>\nbard full-time, and just thought it would be a good class with<br/>\nwhich to get a feel for the game.  So I put all my points into<br/>\nchr to test its effect on prices.  Little did I know I&#39;d end<br/>\nup hooked on playing a bard...  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
