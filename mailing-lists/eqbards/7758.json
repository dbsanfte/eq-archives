Very red.  And I probably take more<br/>\nrisks than I need to, mainly due to being lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI.E.  Speed song first, find mob, cast any spell I can<br/>\non him without getting close.  Giant chases me.  Run<br/>\ntowards another giant.  As first giant runs by second<br/>\nwill hear what a nasty little bard I am and give<br/>\nchase.  Charm first (who is still targeted).  Usually<br/>\na couple resists (mixing charm and speed) then one<br/>\nholds.  Immediately turn and run AT the giants<br/>\n(switching of course to the speed song).  One hits me,<br/>\nthe other hits him, I may get stunned, but I get out<br/>\nof there.  Giants fight, twist one heal, back to<br/>\nspeed, recharm, speed, heal, speed, recharm, speed. <br/>\nAt some point I get close to see who the victor will<br/>\nbe (compare health bars).  Keep the healthy one<br/>\ntargeted.  Charm, speed, charm, speed, in a circular<br/>\nmotion.  You have gained experiance.  Run away from<br/>\ncorspe.  Giant follows, run past giant with super<br/>\nspeed, loot body before giant catches up (the exciting<br/>\npart).  Then look for a healthy giant to get the<br/>\nwounded one who&#39;s now chasing me.  Fear chain, yes, I<br/>\ncould take down cy&#39;s with it, but I&#39;ve never gotten a<br/>\n49pp 123gp split off a cy.  Eventually you zone to go<br/>\nbuy expesive wine in freeport and woo ladies waiting<br/>\non the boat.  All in all not a bad day.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharmed, I&#39;m sure,<br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
