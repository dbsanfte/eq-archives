I&#39;ve already chosen half elf as my<br/>\n&gt; race and I intend to put most of my points into strength so that I can<br/>\n&gt; easily carry steel plate, weapons and instruments.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, with the few remaining points I have, where do you <br/>\n&gt; guys and gals<br/>\n&gt; suggest I put them? Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity is <br/>\n&gt; important<br/>\n&gt; for playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does <br/>\n&gt; it actually<br/>\n&gt; increase the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>\n&gt; frequently you miss a note?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or perhaps agility would be better, as if I don&#39;t get hit, I don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; interrupted. Plus plate + agility is a nice combination.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>\n&gt; steelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t want <br/>\n&gt; to be in a<br/>\n&gt; constant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to be <br/>\n&gt; safe, but I<br/>\n&gt; was thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into <br/>\n&gt; dexterity and<br/>\n&gt; agility).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If less strength is okay, then I might consider just doing a <br/>\n&gt; wood elf, as<br/>\n&gt; they tend to have higher natural agility and dexterity. <br/>\n&gt; Either elf fits<br/>\n&gt; well in my IC perception of my character.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your help,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Jesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Books, music, videos, gifts, e-cards, auctions-find them at <br/>\n&gt; AMAZON.COM.<br/>\n&gt; Browse Earth&#39;s Biggest Selection!
