Our DoT songs did not get the extra tick of damage, but are<br/>\n&gt;subject to the damage decrease if the mob runs toward the bard when damage<br/>\n&gt;is applied.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is this documented somewhere?  I have heard no reports of actual damage<br/>\nafter the patch, then again it is going to be hard to get exact numbers with<br/>\nthe PvP damage changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever to that other point. Since our DoTs are also area effect,I cannot<br/>\nsee this mattering much in any situation except kiting. One way in which we<br/>\ngained reletive to other classes is that DoTs are not nerfed if the monster<br/>\nis feared and running away, which is our prime &quot;kiting&quot; method. If anything<br/>\nthey took pains to leave our &quot;kiting&quot; alone, I mean, why else would you<br/>\nexempt fear? For all those Enchanter kiters?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, I think it is a game tweak, yes, but we actually wound up on the<br/>\nwinning side of the equasion. All these cries of nerfing, I am not seeing<br/>\nit. Yeah hide and sneak are worthless, yes I could see a tweak in defensive<br/>\nskills. But I am a valued and useful member of my group, I drop some serious<br/>\ndamage on Fire Goblins in SolA and give everyone a chance to zone (if the<br/>\npull was too big) without getting backstabbed all the way. I have had Druids<br/>\nexpress jelousy at all the coool things we get to do that they don&#39;t. All<br/>\nwithout mana. What is so freakin bad? I don&#39;t feel nerfed or underpowered at<br/>\nall, sorry, but in a group with a warrior, a cleric and a wizard, I kick<br/>\nserious butt across a lot of situations. Why do I think I am not alone in<br/>\nthis?<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
