The ideas<br/>\n&gt; we came up with to encourage dungeon crawling still work in<br/>\n&gt; the above scenario - the L50s have to crawl rather than camp.<br/>\n&gt; So I would say that these are orthogonal problems that can be<br/>\n&gt; solved separately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Crawling or camping, either way the key is that you have to get them out of<br/>\nthe level 30 dungeons some how.  Hell, for that matter, you got to get them<br/>\nout of some of the level 40+ dungeons!  Nothing is more annoying then to<br/>\ncall a camp check in Lower Guk, get no response about the<br/>\nassassin/supplier... fight your way there just to find a level 50 anything<br/>\nsitting there camping the room.  Some areas are built for level 46-50, like<br/>\nthe frenzied and the lord and some are built for the low 40&#39;s or high 30&#39;s<br/>\nlike the assassin, but it sure doesn&#39;t stop the 50&#39;s from camping them.<br/>\nWhat is the root of the problem that we are ultimately trying to solve here?<br/>\nA combination of over crowding and item farming.  I don&#39;t think talking<br/>\nabout dungeon crawling buys you a darn thing until you eliminate Item<br/>\nFarming and Over Crowding... and once you&#39;ve done that I think you&#39;ll find<br/>\nthat the discussion about camping vs. dungeon crawling becomes rather<br/>\nmeaningless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always been taught to solve the root problem and not the symptoms.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the only real solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
