IMHO - what we<br/>\nare pretty much are seeing is an &quot;immature&quot; Software Company.  Unforuntately<br/>\nVerant is making the same mistakes that we ahve seen over and over again in<br/>\nthe Computer Game industry.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Those of us who are in their late 30&#39;s+ and have been playing computer<br/>\ngames know this.  Especially if you played early Massively-Multiplayer games<br/>\n(I did a lot on GEnie in the early 90&#39;s).<br/>\n<br/>\n    Every mistake they are making; from lack of QA, to thinking they know<br/>\nbetter in game design; to bad patches, etc etc etc is typical.  It&#39;s sad<br/>\nthat with the exception of the PvP issue they learned little if anything<br/>\nfrom the predescessors.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It sure is nice paying $10/month and not $6.00/hour (I&#39;m not kidding -<br/>\nthat&#39;s what we paid back then - plus a per-minute charge to the phone<br/>\ncompany - there were very few dialins) - but it is frustrating<br/>\nnone-the-less.<br/>\n<br/>\n    What&#39;s particularly frustrating - is there is a lot they can do to<br/>\nimprove it - at least on the testing side.  It&#39;s obvious their internal<br/>\ntraining staff is woefully inadequate.  And full-time inhouse testers aren&#39;t<br/>\ncheap - and we understand the economic reality for a company owned by a<br/>\nlarge corporation.  But what&#39;s ridiculous about it - they could easily get<br/>\nconsumer to do TONS of testing for them for very little money.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Sure they have a test-server.  But how much info is provided on what<br/>\nchanges have gone in to test it?  How many people really want to build a<br/>\ncharacter there. And it&#39;s ridiculous to CHARGE people to test it for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Why not give free accounts to people that ONLY let you log into the Test<br/>\nServer.  Require these people to file weekly bug reports.  And provide them<br/>\nwith DETAILED information on what changes are going on.  Let them import<br/>\nchars from live servers - or have a character building tool to let them test<br/>\ndifferent classes and Levels (But DON&#39;T give them a different client!  Make<br/>\nthis tool a seperate executable).<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyway - this is a ramble.  Yes Verant has a great product.  Yes they<br/>\ndeserve a lot of credit for what they&#39;ve done.  But it&#39;s really sad that<br/>\nthey have to make the same mistakes everyone else has.  And the marketplace<br/>\nis limited enough that they won&#39;t have to pay for this mistake until some<br/>\ncompetitor comes along with a better product...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
