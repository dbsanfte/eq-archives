I&#39;ve seen 5 or 6 of them already.<br/>\nI keep having to pass<br/>\nthem around to people since they&#39;re lore.<br/>\nThe earrings drop off about 1 of every 15 orcs (can drop off the oracle,<br/>\ncenturion or mystic).  The necklace<br/>\ncan also drop off the oracle or mystic.  The centurions can only drop the<br/>\nearrings.<br/>\nThe Oracle also drops the Ry`gorr armor.  At least the boots, bracer, sleeves,<br/>\ncoif and collar (that&#39;s what<br/>\nwe&#39;ve seen so far at least)..   It looks VERY VERY cool on a bard.  It looks<br/>\nlike the old Hot Rod symbol.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a flame that covers the chest and goes down through the legs.  Probably the<br/>\nbest looking bard armor<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen yet.  To get the BP and Legs, however, you have to go kill the<br/>\nChieftain (named mob) that spawns<br/>\nat the Rygorr Fort in the middle of the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoulsinger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: Jay Griffiths/IS/Expeditors)<br/>\nSubject:  Re: [eqbards] Velious first impressions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLadt night while camping the orc oracle in Eastern Wastes (near the bridge),<br/>\nwe had 3 of those nifty earrings drop (we were pulling cougars, griffs, etc)<br/>\nand a *very* rare drop from the oracle, a necklace that was like AC 8 (or<br/>\nwas it AC 5?
