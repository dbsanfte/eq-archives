Several of the bard/rogue<br/>\n&gt; items are or already have been realigned to be rogue only due to rogue<br/>\n&gt; complaints.  And yes the primarily found Cleric weapon is Cleric/Paladin<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there are many special weapons easily obtainable for clerics like the<br/>\n&gt; Bloodforge hammer.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And there are many special weapons a Bard can use.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are wrong if you think there are less Bard-only equipment than<br/>\nCleric-only equipment.  And Bards hve a much larger selection of weapons to<br/>\nchoose from that clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; High elves and halflings are the low for cleric hitpoints, half-elves and<br/>\n&gt; humans are the high for bard hitpoints.  Our dwarf cleric has near 400hp<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my 337 and he is 2 levels below me with no points added to stamina and no<br/>\n&gt; boosting items (just like me).  His AC is also 30 points higher since his<br/>\n&gt; strength is 100+ with minimal point investment.  Maybe clerics in general<br/>\n&gt; only make slightly better or equal tanks to us, but dwarf clerics<br/>\n </span></blockquote>definitely<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; make better tanks than any bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see your real problem.  You are only level 16 and the cleric is 14.  You<br/>\nhave no idea how things happen work out later on.  At higher levels Clerics<br/>\nare just not melee capable.  Clerics are more efficeint when they meditate<br/>\nin battle.  At your low levels, clerics do make decent tanks.  But this<br/>\nability goes away at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In addition his full suit of armor cost less than 150pp.  I on the other<br/>\n&gt; hand have one piece alone that cost me that much (silvered bracer).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This makes no sense at all.  You could equip yourself very similar to the<br/>\nDwarf for around the same prices.  But just because you bought one piece of<br/>\nrare equipment doesn&#39;t mean that bards are worse off.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cleric just paid 800pp for a CG Shield.  I also paid 600pp for two +WIS<br/>\nrings.  And around 100pp for some earrings.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
