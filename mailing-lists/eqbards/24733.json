Obviously, the health regen is higher on Soothing.  If you need straight mana regen, go with Clarity, if you&#39;ve also got wounded party members, go with Soothing.  (Range issues aside) If you want to twist something during battle (and you can equip the lute) go with Soothing because it will last the usual 2 tics, allowing you to twist in 2 other songs.  Clarity pulses and is gone, making it less effective if you&#39;re twisting more than 1 song with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that complicated answer is clear enough, hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the &quot;direct shot&quot; (it&#39;s not really direct, it gets applied at the 6 second tick cycle) vs. &quot;regen&quot; is VERY close to how Kaearia described it way back when.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Cranfill, Wendy <br/>\n  To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, May 14, 2001 5:45 PM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [eqbards] Reed&#39;s Bard Song Analysis Spreadsheet V 1.13<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So which one is actually better?<br/>\n  32 Clarity song<br/>\n  or Cantana of Soothing played with Lute of the Howler?<br/>\n<br/>\n  We have lots of arguments about this one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tani/Halana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
