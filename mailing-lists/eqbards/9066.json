If you&#39;ve ever tried to sneak<br/>\nup on Chief Goonda in WK, you know that he has a *huge* aggro<br/>\nradius (basically he charged me when he was about 5 pixels<br/>\nlarge on my screen at 1024x768).  So it may be that while a<br/>\nmob&#39;s initial aggro radius is small, once it has been<br/>\nactivated, the AI may be taking into account all potential<br/>\nhostiles it sees within a much larger radius.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
