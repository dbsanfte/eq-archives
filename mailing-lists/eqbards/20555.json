We were a great team,<br/>\nI would be tanking and he would call &quot;just short of boom&quot; do I would switch<br/>\nto mana song exclusively and then I would hear the standing sound followed<br/>\nby a boom followed by the words &quot;You gain experience&quot; :o) Being able to back<br/>\noff while the pet tanked was great as well. Not to mention all those free<br/>\ngoodies, the great dagger for my range slot, bandages, levitate and water<br/>\nbreathing rings, it always felt like Christmas morning *laughs*<br/>\n<br/>\nOn AE in a group for &quot;crowd control&quot;, there DOES have to be some point at<br/>\nwhich it is more efficient to hurt the whole pull (while focusing on one)<br/>\nthan to mez and take on one at a time, right?  The amount of damage you can<br/>\ndo with AE far exceeds the damage you can do to a single (before 38 at<br/>\nleast) so there MUST be some situations where that is a more efficient use<br/>\nof your abilities (and a mages). The trick of course is staying alive, which<br/>\nis possible with a healer. But pre-hurting 3 mobs while you focus on one is<br/>\na really efficient battle strategy, I used it a lot (with great success) at<br/>\nthe bridge in the Lake. <br/>\nI could be wrong, but I suspect that mezzing, while clearly a solid tactic,<br/>\nis not the end-all be-all of dealing with a crowd. I know it FEELS safer,<br/>\nbut I bet in some situations that people are being over-cautious, that using<br/>\nAE damage you could get a lot more exp in the same amount of time (plus its<br/>\nmore exciting :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTsengu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
