Roughly 8pm my time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometime earlier, my bard has already had a look out, and has camped<br/>\nat about the same spot in West Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday night .... after a day at work, I return home to log in and<br/>\ntake out my frustrations on the orcs, goblins and other meanies of<br/>\nNorrath.  I get to the character screen and decide to take the bard<br/>\nout for a run.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrange.  The character model is naked except for the lute.  Oh well,<br/>\nmaybe it got corrupted somehow, so I select enter world.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrange.  I&#39;m standing at the counter in the Freeport bank.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\npark here the last time.  Press inventory.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven stranger.  Where have all my armour and weapons gone?  &lt;insert<br/>\ngrowing concern&gt;  Check the bank manager.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh dear.  &lt;insert sinking feeling&gt;  Where has all my money gone?<br/>\n<br/>\nImmediately camp.  Check my other characters on the screen.  Wizard is<br/>\nalso naked.  Other 2 throwaway characters seem to be untouched.  So I<br/>\nenter the world as my wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame routine ... I don&#39;t remember camping at the same counter in the<br/>\nFreeport bank.  Oh look, armour and equipment seems to have<br/>\ndisappeared.  And yes, so has all my money in the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;insert a thump as I can&#39;t sink any lower&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I get to thinking.  Well, no one else has physical access to<br/>\nmy computer, let alone knowledge of my station ID or password.  My CD<br/>\nis safely locked away, the account key long since forgotten or known<br/>\noutside of this room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly did not give away the equipment and money.  And especially<br/>\nnot on both my main characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think for a while and can&#39;t come up with any other reasonable<br/>\nexplanation ....my account has been accessed without my knowledge or<br/>\nconsent, and all my bits and pieces have been &quot;donated&quot; away to<br/>\npersons unknown.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this stage, I phone Verant (or whoever).  Spend a good half hour in<br/>\na queue on the customer support only to be told I should have phoned<br/>\ntech support. &lt;sigh - at least it&#39;s the same the world over&gt;  Phone<br/>\ntech support .... I should petition and speak to the GM on the server.<br/>\nYes I already did the petition thing, no one was on.  So I was<br/>\nprovided with the Mith Marr administrator&#39;s email address, and<br/>\npromptly sent an email off to him/her.  I also logged in, went round<br/>\nkilling the lowest of the low beasts in an attempt to recover some<br/>\nmoney, and then eventually sat in W Freeport and waited.  But it is<br/>\ntime for me to log, and I shall have to seek a solution via email.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is simply an information sharing posting, to warn people that it<br/>\nis possible for such things to happen.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, my<br/>\naccount was compromised, I can see no other explanation for it.  My<br/>\nonly hope is that the logs retained by the administrators will<br/>\ndemonstrate the time my account was accessed, the IP address used, and<br/>\nhopefully the EQ account key used.  This will at least provide a trace<br/>\nto the person responsible and &lt;fingers crossed&gt; remove them from the<br/>\ngame.  If I have lost my money and equipment, so be it, my life still<br/>\ncontinues, perhaps somewhat disappointed, and certainly demotivated<br/>\nfor tonight at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would welcome any other reasonable suggestions that could explain<br/>\nwhat has happened.  People lose equpiment and money to bugs quite a<br/>\nbit, however having both characters standing at the counter in the<br/>\nFreeport bank cannot be explained by a bug.  I am simply at a loss to<br/>\nexplain it in any other way than an unauthorised account use.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, throwing it open to the rather more well-informed crowd ......<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nSaldara<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (21), Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\nMelaniel<br/>\nWood Elf Bard (11), Mith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
