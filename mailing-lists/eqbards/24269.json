At best that 30 seconds will not gain you 400+<br/>\n&gt;damage.  If you were using your chants during that 30 seconds, and counting<br/>\n&gt;the best scenario where you lose 2 pulses of Frost, 3 pulses of Flame, and 4<br/>\n&gt;pulses of Fulfill&#39;s you lose 350 damage from chants to gain 400 pts from<br/>\n&gt;DDD.  Since you really lose the full 5 pulses of each Chant, some on the<br/>\n&gt;back side while you restart them, you actually lose 600+ pts of damage in 30<br/>\n&gt;seconds.  These numbers are just with a store bought drum.  If you have even<br/>\n&gt;a Nostrolo&#39;s tambourine you lose even more potential damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the 30 seconds is during downtime, not during combat.  it also takes into account<br/>\nthe time it takes to mem the song, the time it takes to cast it (3 seconds), and the<br/>\ntime it takes to mem whatever song it replaced at the next downtime period.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Taking that into account DDD is worse than useless if you have to mem it<br/>\n&gt;every time you want to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it would be far more useless if it had a &#39;&#39;gray out&#39;&#39; timeout period like a cleric&#39;s<br/>\nDA spell or a druid&#39;s spirit of cheetah.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
