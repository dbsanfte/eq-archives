The<br/>\nnumber of people in your group will make a big difference in<br/>\nthe group&#39;s ability.  The biggest jump is going from 1 person<br/>\nto 2 people (double the hp, double the damage output = killing<br/>\nstuff twice as fast with half the downtime).  So when your<br/>\nbard leaves, the drop in your group&#39;s effectiveness is not<br/>\njust due to lack of a bard, it&#39;s also due to lack of a 4th<br/>\ngroup member.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to replace the bard with someone else (hopefully as<br/>\ncompetent a player :) and compare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so far the least important char in our group is the wizard.

Obviously fights go slower, but I would say<br/>\n&gt; our xp gain is about the same with or without her.  Theres a definite<br/>\n&gt; drop off when any of the other members leave.

Early on, the<br/>\ndamage mobs do is really not that great relative to your hp.  <br/>\nYou end up killing stuff and having little downtime.  Having a<br/>\nnuker there to shorten your fights does not really affect<br/>\nthings much because your group is already operating at near<br/>\ntop effectiveness.  i.e. The ratio of mob survival time to<br/>\nyour survival time is already very low.  If the wizard<br/>\naccounts for half the group&#39;s damage, nuking to cut it in half<br/>\nfrom 0.1 to 0.05 does not make that big a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on, the mobs do a lot more damage so you end up killing<br/>\nstuff and having lots of downtime.  The ratio of mob survival<br/>\ntime to your survival time is rather high, say 0.8.  Nuking to<br/>\ncut it in half from 0.8 to 0.4 makes a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
