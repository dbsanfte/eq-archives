Much like yours (Although I still need to<br/>\nupgrade my HD and will most likely buy a IBM ATA100)<br/>\nYou mention that your PC crashes and there is a little thing that I know I<br/>\noverlooked when I built my machine and that is the fact that the AGP port<br/>\nand the PCI port right next to it - shares resources! I put my SB LIVE next<br/>\nto my AGP port, because I did not know better (Hey the last machine I put<br/>\ntogether was a P166 with PCI and ISA). The result was that my GeForce and my<br/>\nSBLive shared interrupt!! While WIN98 says that is ok my machine crashed<br/>\nalot esp when gaming (most activity on GFX and sound)!!<br/>\nI tried everything. Until I finally detected that graphics and sound shared<br/>\ninterrupt and moved my SB to another slot.<br/>\nSince then I very rarely have system freezes. You can check your IRQ<br/>\nsettings and make sure that no interrupts are shared. I had to remove an old<br/>\nISA LPT port I have in order to free enough interrupt, so that no int was<br/>\nshared..<br/>\n<br/>\nWell its just an idea if you dident know about it..<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; MacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n&gt; 40th Bard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro Blood Tide<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 13, 2001 7:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] OT - Equipment question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;severe snippage&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
