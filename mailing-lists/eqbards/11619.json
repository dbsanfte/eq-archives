I assumed wrong.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying to cash<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; on lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>\n&gt; cheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>\n&gt; saying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>\n&gt; refuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent over<br/>\n&gt; 1000pp<br/>\n&gt; purchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not going to<br/>\n&gt; hand<br/>\n&gt; some greedy bugger more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Soooo, I am now camping SG&#39;s in oasis every opportunity I can but I killed<br/>\n&gt; 4<br/>\n&gt; last night and did not find a single one.  I am joining pickup groups for<br/>\n&gt; the purpose of giant hunting and I often have to convince my group members<br/>\n&gt; that they should let me loot a stone should we find one.  I just don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I still need about 7 lambent stones total for the rest of my armor and I<br/>\n&gt; am<br/>\n&gt; certainly not willing to pay another 200-1000pp to obtain them, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt; have that kind of money anymore after buying the other components.  But I<br/>\n&gt; have been looking for my next stone for 4 in-game days now and have killed<br/>\n&gt; 5<br/>\n&gt; giants and am still empty-handed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations apart from soloing in<br/>\n&gt; the Rathe mts and charming giants to kill each other?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Faras<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
