One of our high-levels <br/>\ntook her down and gave me her horn.  Yes, it&#39;s a wind instrument, acts as a <br/>\nlight source, and has 4 charges of Purge as I&#39;m sure many of you already <br/>\nknow.  I checked various websites and was disappointed to say the least that <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t add a bonus to wind-based songs like some of the other magical <br/>\ninstruments do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday, I was bored and running around North Karana looking for HG&#39;s to <br/>\ncharm (in the event there were two) or kite (if only one) when I ran across <br/>\nGrimFeather.  I get a kick out of kiting Grimmy if only for the number of <br/>\ntimes he killed me back when I was young.  He still gets a few hits in, but <br/>\nfor the most part, I&#39;m faster than him at 40 with just a MM drum (I still <br/>\nhave to get the guild to raid Kaesora for my final coin.. hehe).  After <br/>\nkilling Grimmy, I hit tracking to see what was up, and lo, Zahal the Vile!  <br/>\nSo I kited him (he was blue to me at 40, which was scary considering I had <br/>\nseen on some site that he was supposed to be level 16.  Of course after <br/>\nkilling Zahal, I had to hunt down Regis (I have a cleric twink...)   He was <br/>\ngreen to me but a nasty caster.  I would have died to this greenie if a <br/>\npassing druid hadn&#39;t healed me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, one of the items used in the cleric bracer quest is a flute that Regis <br/>\ndrops.  I decided to test if it could be used as a wind instrument just for <br/>\nkicks.  The standard method of testing this that I&#39;ve heard mentioned so <br/>\nmany times on this list is Pixie Striking yourself and checking the Magic <br/>\nResist loss.  So, I pull out my trusty unicorn horn (the only wind <br/>\ninstrument I usually carry with me) knowing that it has no bonus, and pixie <br/>\nstrike myself repeatedly until it sticks.  Then I noted my MR loss.  Waited <br/>\nuntil it wore off, and then tried it with the quest flute from Regis.  Hmmm, <br/>\nit was LESS MR loss than the unicorn horn.  No, sorry, I didn&#39;t write down <br/>\nthe numbers and do more extensive testing (my regular group was starting to <br/>\nget together).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I decided that it was my bardic duty to let all of you know my <br/>\nfindings.  I&#39;ll try the experiment again with a standard store-bought flute <br/>\njust to make sure that Regis&#39; girlfriend&#39;s flute isn&#39;t somehow cursed with a <br/>\nnegative wind instruments bonus or something.  Plus it&#39;s so hard to get <br/>\nPixie Strike to hit an even-con mob (ie. myself) as you all know (much less <br/>\na green one... hehe).  One quick question:  When you get the secondary <br/>\nresist you still get the full MR debuff but no stun, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and one more thing.  I&#39;ve had the unicorn for almost 6 months now and <br/>\nnever used the Purge effect.  While running past the gnolls in Lake Rathe <br/>\none of those stupid shammy gnolls actually managed to stick Strong Disease <br/>\non me (my MR, CR, and HR are good, but PR and DR are low).  I played Psalm <br/>\nof Vitality forever and it mentioned several times that I had been cured <br/>\n(actually I was probably playing Psalm of Purity and it was curing poison <br/>\nevery time... hehe) without actually removing the disease.  So I got <br/>\nfrustrated and used Purge for the first time ever.  Bah, didn&#39;t work... =8^P <br/>\n  Eventually the disease just wore off.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 40.9 Missed Notes (argghhh, almost out of hell #3)<br/>\nE&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
