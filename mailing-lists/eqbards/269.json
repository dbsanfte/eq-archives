I&#39;m going to approach him about working on a<br/>\nconstitution.  If we decide to move ahead, I&#39;ll come back here with the<br/>\nplan, for discussion of the charter, and to solicit members.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would expect help to be extended somewhat neutrally, although blindly and<br/>\nfoolishly helping the evil to commit more evil would be going too far.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe charter would be long on principles of honesty and reasonable<br/>\nunselfishness and short on exact specifics of behavior.  The idea is for<br/>\nthe guild name to be a badge of trust.  One who betrayed that trust would<br/>\nbe removed.  My first thought is to do that based on testimony and evidence<br/>\npresented to a guild council.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush/Bob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
