Instead I got to roll on the Mithril<br/>\nGreaves that dropped and If I had won I probably would of traded them on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan<br/>\n<br/>\nLoaded question;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point is moot since the decision was made and<br/>\nthe item given.<br/>\n<br/>\n...would it be possible to get a few buds together to<br/>\ndo this again?  Then you&#39;d get the crown....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
