I don&#39;t know if the Bard has as significant a penalty as some of<br/>\nthe hybrids (my Bards stay low leveled because this middle aged person has<br/>\na skill cap on her mash key skill).  I also think from personal experience<br/>\n(empirical data only!) that some races may have more/less of an exp.<br/>\npenalty.  Though access to good non-overcrowded hunting grounds with a<br/>\nspawn rate exceeding your rest time seems to have a bigger effect on<br/>\nability and time to level than any bonus/penalty IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I agree with the personal preference option.  Also the vision may be<br/>\nmore of an issue with a Bard since many of the caster classes get vision<br/>\nspells and/or light spells.  Some of the light spells at L1, and vision<br/>\nspells as early a L9.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
