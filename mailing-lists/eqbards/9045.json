While<br/>\ncamping on the left wall waiting for my group&#39;s puller to return with some<br/>\nfair, I heard the shout &quot;Hag to zone&quot;.  At this time I was sing anthem to<br/>\nensure that my group was ready to handle the pull.  Now what did I see, a<br/>\npaladin running out of the house over the railing of the porch with a hag<br/>\nand two dry bones in tow.  Not really thinking for a second, I was totally<br/>\nbaffled when the hag stopped, turned and headed straight for me.  Of<br/>\ncourse being level 21 at the time I could only survive 2 blasts of her<br/>\nforce shock and a couple hits from the carrion ghoul.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is not bard hate then I don&#39;t know what is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nBard of Kelethin<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
