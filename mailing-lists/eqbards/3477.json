Well IMHO Lullaby is one of the absolute most<br/>\n&gt; useful songs I have in my arsenal, ranked right up there with Consonant<br/>\n&gt; Chain and Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing I would like to stress here - MOST BARD SONGS ARE NOT VERY<br/>\n&gt; EFFECTIVE AT THE LEVEL YOU GET THEM! Give it a couple levels, get your<br/>\n&gt; skills up in the requisite instrument - All of a sudden the songs are more<br/>\n&gt; effective, being resisted less, you are missing fewer notes etc..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I find the Lullaby particulary useful for train control. Last night in<br/>\nCazic<br/>\n&gt; Thule i was hunting with a barbarian warrior and a human cleric. He pulled<br/>\n&gt; from the throne room and a spawn occured and we were fighting 2 gorillas<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; a lizard. Well with Lullaby, the two gorillas slept like babies.  Now yeah<br/>\n&gt; they woke up, but a couple rounds after the &quot;nod off&quot; message, they were<br/>\n&gt; sleeping again and we all fought the lizard, moved to the next gorilla and<br/>\n&gt; then killed the last one. Could I do this effectively at 15th level even<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; greens - NO! However as I have grown, the effectiveness of this song has<br/>\n&gt; grown with me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The same thing with Selo Consanant Chain.  When I first got this at 23 it<br/>\n&gt; was resisted 80% of the time. That is down to about 25% of the time<br/>\nagainst<br/>\n&gt; blues now, meaning that if I repeatedly sing this song i *can* stop a<br/>\nrunner<br/>\n&gt; before it goes and brings friends.  Be patient, experiment, practice. Make<br/>\n&gt; your level, rinse and repeat &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Big disadvantage of Lullaby - cannot be juggled<br/>\n&gt; Big advantage of Lullaby - GREAT TO INTERRUPT THOSE PESKY CASTERS!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my 2 copper.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lago Bardoon, 30th Rank Bard of Bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
