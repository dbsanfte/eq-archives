Then<br/>\nheal for a pulse to get icon back and then back to mana song.  I think it is<br/>\nclose - maybe I pulse mana one more time at the expense of a pulse w/o a<br/>\nheal tick.  But I prefer the visual cues from the icon dropping to the<br/>\nbother of all of the clicking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso something to remember - other classes see the bard icons as blinking<br/>\nicons (man that would drive me nuts!) So they don&#39;t really notice if heal<br/>\nsong blinks off as it is always blinking for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 39th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I get pretty easily confused weaving chant and celerity since they have<br/>\nthe same icons - hehe I can never remember which one I just did. I suppose I<br/>\nshould set my hot keys to 1 & 3 rather than 1 & 2 - that way if I start with<br/>\n1 I can have a visual cue as to which song need restarting (top icon drops -<br/>\nclick top key; bottom icon drops - click bottom key.)<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s. Instill Doubt in wolf-form is really annoying ;) hehe - I was<br/>\npracticing between fights and stopped cuz I was driving my group nuts &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\nBut it can make for some fun Role Play when other players walk up - you can<br/>\nbark at them and such hehe.  I finally saw a skill check (53) as was<br/>\npracticing in the guild house with a lev 44 friend who played the int wis<br/>\nsong.  He dumped 30 points into his and checked at 70 pretty quick.  We went<br/>\nout to west freep and dueled - using just ID.  I was the first to get one to<br/>\nstick (kick for 1 and he was feared away)  but then he feared me a few times<br/>\n(I resisted him 1 time too) - I&#39;d say 3 sticks out of 30 or 40 casts.  I<br/>\nmusta had one stick while I was practicing in HighKeep during combat - all<br/>\nof a sudden the gob takes off for the bank or the bakery and we hadda chain<br/>\nhim down.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, December 20, 1999 12:56 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Need more bards<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\twhat I usually do is let<br/>\n\t\tClarity tick twice (9 sec), give a shot of Hymn (3 sec) and<br/>\ngo<br/>\n\t\tback to Clarity.
