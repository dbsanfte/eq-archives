It is possible that Stamina has a greater affect for<br/>\nWar/Rog/Monk/SK/PAL/RNG than it does for us.  Bards are not melee hybrids.<br/>\nWe&#39;re more of a cross between caster and melee than any of the other<br/>\nhybrids.  In fact I&#39;d probably go so far as to say that Bards are more of a<br/>\nCaster Hybrid than a Melee Hybrid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just my interpretation but it leads to my theory...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible that &quot;Caster&quot; classes get less benefit from stamina than<br/>\n&quot;Melee&quot; classes.  Since the Bard class is &quot;less&quot; of a melee class than some<br/>\nother classes it&#39;s possible that we don&#39;t see the benefit from stamina that<br/>\nother classes do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;m currently *not* playing EQ because of the new EULA, and will not<br/>\nplay EQ until the new EULA is rescinded, I cannot test this theory on my 3<br/>\nbards (one 11th, one 34th, one 50th) (yes, I have too much time on my<br/>\nhands).   I have verified, as I levelled my shadowknight, ranger and rogue<br/>\nup that Stamina has a great effect on their hitpoints.  Thus my<br/>\nmisconception that it would help us as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone has a couple bards of various levels and could check this I<br/>\nsuspect we will find either 1 of 2 things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Stamina has an effect on hitpoints with a greater return as you level<br/>\n2)  Stamina has a constant effect on hitpoints which does not matter with<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure which will come up but I suspect that, given the responses I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen here, bards do not get a stamina bonus (which I already know that<br/>\nrogues and SK&#39;s do)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince EQ is based from AD&D you can see that in AD&D various classes got<br/>\nmore benefit from &quot;Constitution&quot; re &quot;Stamina&quot; than others.  I suspect that<br/>\nthe variance people are reporting re: Rog/War vs Bard have something to do<br/>\nwith that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a hunch though.  We&#39;ll need someone to verify through checkin&#39; it out<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s to hoping Verant comes to their senses so I can play again.<br/>\n<br/>\nCIAO!<br/>\n<br/>\nKev<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you get 3 hp for 1 sta at lvl 50 and I get 1 hp per 1 STA at lvl 20,<br/>\n&gt; when does STA become useful?<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt DeBarger<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
