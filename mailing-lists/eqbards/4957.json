Instead of using my<br/>\ninvisibilty, I just wandered around like a moron.  It was around 5pm Central<br/>\ntime so the campers had not yet arrived and the Orcs were in control.  I<br/>\nstumbled into them and managed to escape to the guards.  You&#39;d think that<br/>\nwould be enough of a warning to me but no I hadda go back for more and the<br/>\nrest of the dorcs nailed me. Grrrrr!  Needless death - I don&#39;t even wanna<br/>\nlook at my xp bar. Grrrrr!  Wrong place - wrong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe early part of the night goes by and I have some adventures.  But I<br/>\nfigger it&#39;s time to go back and get some xp.  So, back in HH I go looking<br/>\nfor a group to join back by the dorc side.  Nobody will have me. Wah!! So I<br/>\nwander around but end up back there in not too long. Well, the place is like<br/>\na tornado tore thru it.  Ded bods all over. And only a couple inky casters<br/>\nhanging about. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I look up....Hargis Shraylock!  He&#39;s spawned! I shout to the zone<br/>\nHurry!  The two casters there start wailing on him.  I equip my weps and<br/>\njump into the fray. Hmm, one brave caster is ded. And the second one is not<br/>\nlooking too good either! So here I am whacking away as hard as I can and<br/>\nbellowing like mad! Maybe - just maybe I can put enuff dmg into him.  And<br/>\nthen the second caster dies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s me and old Hargis (sp?) I am dropping hp and old Shrylock is not<br/>\ngiving up his hp too easy.  Pierce, slash, bellow, heal. anthem, rinse,<br/>\nrepeat... I am dipping into my 2nd last bub of hp and KA-BOOM! Down he goes!<br/>\nI am looting him like lightning wondering what will happen if I die with the<br/>\nloot window open - as two of his hench-orcs are pounding me.  Hey lookie<br/>\nthere!  Some kinda spear thing!  Right-click, right-click (I sure hope I got<br/>\nopen slots)  Excuse me dorcs, I cant stay and play - I gotta zone!<br/>\n<br/>\nYup - I nabbed a Shiny Brass Halbred!!!  Grr - not able to equip it.  Well,<br/>\nI guess I can sell it - or find some suitable purpose.  Yay!  My first big<br/>\ntime loot!!!  I got lucky for sure!  Right place - right time!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 20th level<br/>\na.k.a. Robo-Bard<br/>\nasleep on her feet<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
