He said he ran<br/>\ninto some unicorn and killed it a while back and that he got a &quot;unicorn<br/>\nhorn&quot;  but didnt know if it was special or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him give it to me ill do a quick test ( we were in lower guk so didnt<br/>\nwant to waste To much time).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell first I fired up Invis with it and it was a wind instrament. So then I<br/>\npixie striked my self 3 times to watch the MR lower.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. No instrament my mr loweres 8<br/>\n2. Normal Wood Flute my mr lowers14 points<br/>\n3. Unicorn horn my mr lowers 17 points ( average like 22% increase or<br/>\nsometing )<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a 50th necro and been bored with the game a bit . But my<br/>\nquestion is, well no question. Is there anymore to this horn? I actually<br/>\nhave never heard of it and those are all the tests I did with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want to know if anyone else knows anymore about this horn. Possible<br/>\nother uses for it and also what Purge spell is ( it has 5 charges)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso this has no hand graphic on me wood elf bard. It does do the Piper<br/>\nAnimation though :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks ahead of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldar Missednote 45th Wood Elf Bard. Tarew Marr<br/>\nNuldar Andhaka 50th Necromancer Human .
