For the non-bards reading<br/>\nthis, Verant fixed 3 of our songs so that their effects are enhanced when<br/>\nyou use an instrument - this is the original design - just took them 11<br/>\nmonths since release to get to it.  The instrument used to enhance these<br/>\nsongs is percussion which is also used to help you run faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got close enough to GrimFeather to effect him with a song and started in.<br/>\nChant, run away a bit, different chant, run more, rinse, repeat.  Turns out<br/>\nthat GrimFeather was no problem at all using this technique. He damaged me<br/>\nfor maybe 200 in the whole fight and that is because I was sloppy and let<br/>\nhim get too close.  And it was not an ungodly long battle either.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, I my euphoria to celebrate this kill, I decided to climb the wizard<br/>\nspires.  Hmm, I sure seem to be climbing up here pretty darn fast.  Wow,<br/>\ngoing lots faster now that its not so steep at the top. Hmm, I better slow<br/>\ndown before I....... whoops!  OMG I am falling!  I wonder if.... LOADING,<br/>\nPlease Wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucky for me, a good friend, who is a cleric, was in North Karana and ressed<br/>\nme back.  He had a good laugh too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 50 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
