I&#39;ll use Verant&#39;s general idea of a bard as a start<br/>\nthough, don&#39;t want to start that whole why the heck can we wear plate<br/>\nargument again.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimary:\tGroup buffs<br/>\nSecondary:\tMelee<br/>\nTertiary:\teverything else<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t I think this is true currently?  Because Verant overvalues the<br/>\nfact that our songs do not require mana.  To make it true would require them<br/>\nto realize their error.  We should be able to group buff a party at 5 levels<br/>\nor so below what the other buffers can do to make it truly a primary<br/>\nability.  Currently many of our buffs are so far behind the equivalent buffs<br/>\nfrom other classes that unless the fighting is continuous it is better for<br/>\nthe other classes to buff up and med.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur melee is really too weak currently to qualify as a secondary.  I back<br/>\nthis opinion up by this experience.  I was grouped at one point with a<br/>\nranger and a shadowknight.  We agreed to test out our melee skills, letting<br/>\nthe monsters be the judges.  None of us cat any spells or used any abilities<br/>\nexcept the ranger to snare mobs that had ceased to offer their opinion as<br/>\njudges.  The result?  I did not take more than a single attack the entire<br/>\nnight in any fight.  In 4 hours of play I took maybe 150 points of damage.<br/>\nThe shadowknight won the contest but only barely.  He was attacked 54% of<br/>\nthe time, the ranger 46%.   The number of attacks on me was below 1%.<br/>\nGranted the SK did have a sword that might be slightly more valuable than my<br/>\nweapons but the ranger and I had an identical combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason I put travel as tertiary is we are great errand runners.<br/>\nWithout teleport our travel really isn&#39;t up to snuff with druids and<br/>\nwizards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe amount of RL finger twiddling that bards do to make their abilities work<br/>\nis so far above that required by any other class, we might as well be<br/>\nplaying a different game.  I had a friend over last week who plays fairly<br/>\nregularly with me, he&#39;s the ranger from the test actually although his<br/>\nprimary is now a druid.  When he saw the constant button manipulation<br/>\nrequired by bards during combat he was stunned.  He had always agreed we<br/>\nwere a little underpowered, but felt all melee classes were.  When he saw<br/>\nwhat we have to do to make our abilities function he though that anyone who<br/>\nhad to go through all that ought to see some benefit from it that was more<br/>\nsignificant than we do.  He said he would rather just have mana than go<br/>\nthrough all that constant finger waggling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 8:05 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bards abilities redefined was: Attack speedups <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a blank sheet of &quot;paper&quot;.
