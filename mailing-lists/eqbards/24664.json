I whine about our loot<br/>\npriority too sometimes).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another Trak raid yesterday (gotta love patches the day AFTER you kill<br/>\nhim, everyone is camped out nearby with their poison gear), a froglok<br/>\ncroaking dirk drops. 10/18 small amount of ac, agi, cha and mr.  And its<br/>\nawarded to me.  I need to ask our guild leader why me, but I guess he gives<br/>\npriority to people who are always there (I have been to all of our 6? Trak<br/>\nraids now), cause I cant imagine no one else there asked for it.  (Though it<br/>\npeircing so maybe he only considered rouges and bards eligible)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, now I suddenly feel my melee dam could become meaningful, so I think<br/>\nI need to get meself a hast item.  Is there really any other option than<br/>\nbuying a FBSS?  I have about 8k now, so I am close to its going price...<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 55&lt;The Circle of Eternity&gt; Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
