I&#39;m in North Karana waiting for my Druid Guildmate who&#39;s gonna teleport me to Butcherblock - so I can cash in the Brazen Brass Kilij Plans for the weapon (finally got it over the weekend!).  I hear someone doing a shout - &quot;Fenne charm for the looting at loc...&quot;  I grab my drum and high-tail it - and boom I get it!<br/>\n    <br/>\n    I go to Butcherblock -&gt; Felwithe (pick up gold bars) -&gt; Kelethin - get the bars enchanted and get the Kilij.  Get teleported to West Commons - and start killing some Shadowmen.  I hear an auction &quot;Lambent Stone for Sale&quot;.  I offer 20pp (all I had on me - and fair price anywhere) - so Gaelthorne says - &quot;Meet me at the Druid ring&quot;.  I get there and he says &quot;Hey, are you Slyde from the EQ-Bards list?&quot;   I say yes - so he says &quot;Well you can have the stone for free then&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I thank him, we chat for a bit - and go on our ways.  All I can say is &quot;One class act!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks Gaelthorne - I&#39;m a Dark Boned Bracelet away from my first piece of Lambent!<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde - 28 of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
