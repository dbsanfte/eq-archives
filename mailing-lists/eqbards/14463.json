A Paladin and his<br/>\nbuddy were killing a DE Dragoon when my partner and I stopped nearby.  I was<br/>\nwounded and singing hymn.  The Dragoon was too far away normally to be in<br/>\nrange, but if they increased the radius of Hymn accidentally the Paladin<br/>\nwould have probably been in range.  The song wouldn&#39;t have affected him, but<br/>\nI think the taunt is already broken so that it still works like the whole<br/>\nsong did back in beta when you didn&#39;t need to be grouped to get the effects.<br/>\nOne pulse combined with my being hurt was enough to cause the Dragoon to<br/>\nignore a Paladin that had done over 500 pts to it to rush over and try to<br/>\nwhack me.  Fortunately I was able to zone.  My buddy just stood there and<br/>\nwatched.  even though he was hurt as well the Dragoon never even looked at<br/>\nhim, just went right back to the Paladin.  Got a tell a few minutes later<br/>\nfrom the Paladin asking me how the hell I got such a good taunt off on the<br/>\ndragoon.  He wanted to know if I&#39;d tell him how so he could use it since his<br/>\nown taunt sucked.  I told yeh no problem, just be a bard.  That made him<br/>\nlaugh, he hadn&#39;t seen my song pulse so he didn&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 04, 2000 11:52 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Reduced Taunt?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHad one of those weird AE Taunt things last night.
