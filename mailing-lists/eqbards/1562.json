Here is another query for you seasoned vets of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you get to Rivervale from Freeport?

I&#39;d also like to pick up that quest and get a squad ring (I could really use it at times).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again everyone,<br/>\nWell met and happy hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland of Freeport<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
