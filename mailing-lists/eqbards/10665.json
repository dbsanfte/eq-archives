It&#39;s both an art and a science -- you have to have an intuitive feel <br/>\n&gt; for the interactions between everything (race, procs, stat bonuses, classes, <br/>\n&gt; skill caps, etc.) and then you have to back up your gut instincts by running <br/>\n&gt; simulations so that the numbers do, in fact, add up to what you expect. Then <br/>\n&gt; you have to see how it all fits into the world with regards to real world <br/>\n&gt; usefulness (is that proc really relevant? Do these races really use this? Is <br/>\n&gt; there another weapon that&#39;s similar and easier to get?) and hope you made <br/>\n&gt; the right decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  This guy is like a god.
