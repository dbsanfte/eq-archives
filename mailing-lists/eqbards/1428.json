Single target, you have<br/>\nto recycle it manually.  You can keep a mob charmed a long time, but it&#39;s<br/>\ntricky to do more than charm it..such as charming it and fighting another.<br/>\nThere&#39;s no indication the song has worn off until the mob attacks you again.<br/>\nYou can&#39;t keep singing it and increase duration, you have to wait till it<br/>\ndrops then resing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with the fairly recent charm changes, you&#39;ll find that mobs over 25th<br/>\nlevel are immune to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll get a message saying &quot;Creature too high level to be charmed!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless Geoff sticks a higher level version of it in later, you&#39;ll be<br/>\ncharming blues only (and after a while, greens).  That gives the song a very<br/>\nshort career span.  But it&#39;s kinda fun while it lasts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 4:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Solon&#39;s song of the Sirens has been my prime motivation from near the<br/>\n&gt;beginning to work my musical ass off.  Can anyone comment on how this song<br/>\n&gt;works?  I realize that, like most bard songs it has only a 10 - 12 second<br/>\n&gt;duration, but after it wears off, can you recharm the NPC?  For that<br/>\nmatter,<br/>\n&gt;can you continue to sing at it to ensure that the song&#39;s effects never wear<br/>\n&gt;off?  We make horrible pvpers, hard to be killed, but even harder to kill<br/>\n&gt;the attacker.  The best we can do is flee.  Can you charm a PC using this<br/>\n&gt;song?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Have you entered ONElist&#39;s &quot;Grow to Give&quot; program?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Deadline is June 19.
