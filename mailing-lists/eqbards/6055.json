I would say it *is* impossible to pull a mob off someone<br/>\nwho&#39;s almost dead.  I was fighting in Cazic and we&#39;d beaten a<br/>\nlizard to about 1/4 life.  Suddenly it turned around, ran to<br/>\nanother group fighting, hit one of them once killing him, then<br/>\nran back to continue its fight with us.  Apparently it saw the<br/>\nguy was almost dead and that overrode all hatred it had for<br/>\nus even though the guy had never done anything to it, so it<br/>\nran over and killed him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve seen an enchanter charm a werebat. and then the enchanter left him at<br/>\n&gt; that spot and ran away. And we all stood around the werebat targeting it for<br/>\n&gt; when it woke up... and when it did we all attacked it instantly. And WHILE<br/>\n&gt; we were plummeling it, it RAN around like crazy until it fount that<br/>\n&gt; enchanter, and proceeded to lay the smack down on him. (Of course, being a<br/>\n&gt; good enchanter he just stood there twiddling his thumbs, and very soon we<br/>\n&gt; got the bat off him :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A smart enchanter would&#39;ve hit it with mesmerize or memory<br/>\nblur.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
