They are much more efficient under charm control,<br/>\n  than they would be otherwise.  If they seem to break charm<br/>\n  too quickly, drag them in a room, and tell them to sit.<br/>\n<br/>\n* AE fear (Screech) - all I can say is &#39;wow&#39;.  I can disperse<br/>\n  a 10 lizard train at the zoneline in 2 seconds.  While being<br/>\n  swarmed in 4C, this song let me escape into the maze and back<br/>\n  to the courtyard.  4 mob limits do not apply &#39;outdoors&#39; and<br/>\n  cazicthule is considered outdoors.  My screen scrolled really<br/>\n  bad with &#39;... flees in terror&#39; as a horde of lizards ran off.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Lullaby.  I stopped using this song at level 16 when the novelity<br/>\n  wore off.  Everytime I&#39;d play it, I would usually die.  Parties<br/>\n  don&#39;t understand how dangerous this song can be to the bard.<br/>\n  But now I mem&#39;d it back in my song lineup, and at my level with<br/>\n  a lute, jeez, I can put things to sleep instantly with very little<br/>\n  resists.  Same as Screech in that I can nod off as many lizards <br/>\n  that decide to show up, think I did 8 at once last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Pixie Strike.  Although difficult to track many mobs with this,<br/>\n  it works very good at balancing a fight when the odds look bad.<br/>\n  You must pull yourself out of weaving and combat, to click and<br/>\n  mez, over and over across multiple mobs - but it&#39;s worth it.<br/>\n  As for blocking casters with this, you either have to be lucky<br/>\n  or continue to strike them over and over.  If you see a judicator<br/>\n  healing and you press your pixie button, you will almost never<br/>\n  catch the lizard in time.  You will _never_ catch smites, they<br/>\n  are too quick, and you probably wont ever catch wrath.  Twitching<br/>\n  the button on a visual spell cue means you are too late.  Almost<br/>\n  need to cycle pixie on one target to keep it in check.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Charm bugs:  I have been playing with charm a lot recently.<br/>\n  And I have found a lot of bugs with it.  Deadly bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mage and pet are attacking a monster, and I charm it.  Sometimes<br/>\n  the pet STILL has the monster on it&#39;s attack list and decides<br/>\n  to attack ME the master of the monster.  I was beaten up very<br/>\n  bad by a magician&#39;s own pet last night in cazicthule.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Party is fighting a monster, and another shows up and I charm<br/>\n  the new monster.  One party member turns to attack the new monster<br/>\n  after charm wears off to &#39;pull it off me&#39; - but I charm it again.<br/>\n  The monster now has the player who attacked it STILL in it&#39;s agro<br/>\n  list.  And without me saying, /pet back off - the monster will <br/>\n  continue to beat down that player.  In fact if I tell the pet<br/>\n  to guard me, it will start right back up and attack my own party<br/>\n  members.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I will /log as much of this as I can tonight, and try to make sense<br/>\n  of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One more bubble til this hell ends...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>\n  League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n  &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
