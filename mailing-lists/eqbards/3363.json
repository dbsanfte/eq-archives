I got myself a Purity Belt as well.<br/>\nI also bought a bunch of songs that I originally thought weren&#39;t very useful<br/>\nbut find incredibly useful now.<br/>\nI started &quot;juggling&quot; (I only use this term because its the first one I have<br/>\nheard describing the method) Jonathan&#39;s whistling warsong with Chant of<br/>\nBattle and I am hitting with almost only 1 second delay between strikes. I<br/>\nonly use Bellow&#39;s for Fetching now because at my level most things are<br/>\nresisting it, and I would rather be going with the ultra fast attack speed.<br/>\nwhat I found as I was auctioning my brains out is the following:<br/>\nBloodstained mantles go for about 70plat (this was in Kelethin) on average,<br/>\nno one has heard of a troll Hide belt that I had met, and the Dragoon Dirk<br/>\ndoes not always appear on Dvinn, so it has jumped about 20plat in price  I<br/>\ngot mine for 35plat, inside crushbone.  The Dwarven 1H axe is still pretty<br/>\ncheap  I bought mine for 10plat and trading my minotaur axe.  Golden Amber<br/>\nearrings go for 45pp still, and I got my Purity Belt for 15plat (in Beholder<br/>\nMaze of all places)<br/>\nOne thing I have found about Medium Bronze:  It is much rarer than Small<br/>\nBronze armor and will go for around triple the cost.  and because of that  I<br/>\nhave found buying and then reselling my Bronze armor to desperate persons<br/>\ncan be one of the best money making experiences around.  I had originally<br/>\nbought my Breastplate for 38pp, a person in Qeynos then offered me a<br/>\nplethora of items for it until I settled on 88plat I sold it, and 5 minutes<br/>\nlater bought a Bronze breastplate, for 40plat and a bronze helm and pair of<br/>\nbracers for 55plat, from a level 39 Bard named Gohan )<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after buying all those things at the top of my post I am dead broke, and<br/>\nlooking for a good place to hunt. I tried looking in Lesser Faydark, and<br/>\nafter a half hour of running around all I saw was a small bandit camp, and a<br/>\nBrownie camp (which I gave a very large detour around).  I am fighting in<br/>\nthe Oasis right now, but the Loot is pretty poor, and can be very dangerous<br/>\nbecause of the Sand Giants running around.  Anyone have a good place for a<br/>\nlevel 14 bard, that has reasonable loot and is not overcrowded??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
