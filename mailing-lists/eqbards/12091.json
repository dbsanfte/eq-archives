Trumpy hangs around in one of<br/>\nthe buildings close to the docks.  People who are KOS to him<br/>\nwait for the boat at the docks sometimes end up getting within<br/>\nhis aggro radius through the wall.  He then runs out the<br/>\nbuilding, through the streets, and to the docks to attack that<br/>\nperson.  If that person manages to get on the boat, he will<br/>\nswim after them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to kill him.  The weapon you get<br/>\nis not really that good, and the faction hit is substantial.  <br/>\nRepairing your faction with the merchants of Qeynos is easy<br/>\nenough (visit Blackburrow).  But everything I&#39;ve found that<br/>\nraises your faction with the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos also<br/>\nlowers it with the non-corrupt guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
