When both of you<br/>\nare around level 14, Spirit of the Wolf is faster than Selo&#39;s without a<br/>\ndrum.  With a drum, Selo&#39;s is faster.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;ve never tested it, but we seem to get faster as we go up in<br/>\nlevels, while Sprit of the Wolf seems to stay constant despite the level<br/>\nof the druid or shaman.  It could be that at a high level, we&#39;re faster<br/>\nthan SoW even without a drum.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt we&#39;re ever faster than Spirit of Cheetah though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome experiments in this regard would be interesting, if anyone wants to<br/>\ntake them on.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
