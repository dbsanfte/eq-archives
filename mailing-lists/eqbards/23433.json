It takes 2-5 minutes to camp each time.  Believe me, unless you are the<br/>\nonly viable pulling option, your friends and guildmates are going to get<br/>\nVERY irritated waiting for you to come back each mob.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2.  We had seveal guildmembers of the high elven cleric and wood elf druid<br/>\nand ranger persuasions along with us as scouts.  Two of them had little<br/>\nmessups.. one healed when he thought there was no aggro and the other had a<br/>\nmis- /assist and they took faction hits.  They went to KOS in ONE faction<br/>\nhit. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice... if you don&#39;t want the faction hit, don&#39;t pull.  You&#39;re going to<br/>\nget one unless you&#39;re VERY careful and VERY slow, which will annoy everyone<br/>\nelse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents....<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana 58th Shammy, Dain lunch<br/>\nTani 40th Bardette<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Christopher M Andrews [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmandy_drew@...\">cmandy_drew@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 23, 2001 9:48 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Clarification on root/snare &quot;fixes&quot; ...

Pulling in PoG is a <br/>\n&gt; breeze when you<br/>\n&gt; have lightning speed. In my experience, many things have SoW <br/>\n&gt; or better, and<br/>\n&gt; the bard will have the best time making it back to the ambush <br/>\n&gt; unharmed (or<br/>\n&gt; dead).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also.. I seem to remember very few times at all that i&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; been either snared<br/>\n&gt; or rooted while playing Selo&#39;s.  I don&#39;t remember actuallly <br/>\n&gt; being able to<br/>\n&gt; *break* them when firing up the song though.  Since this last <br/>\n&gt; &quot;fix,&quot; what<br/>\n&gt; has everyone discovered? Can you still be immune to movement <br/>\n&gt; hindrances such<br/>\n&gt; as these, or can you be caught mid-stride with a root or <br/>\n&gt; snare from a long<br/>\n&gt; distance caster?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
