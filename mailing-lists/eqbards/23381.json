I would say 50 is<br/>\ntoo low.  Get 51 before emabarking on what is going to be a long career in<br/>\nthese places. You won&#39;t have those resists.  Yes, you can go there and yes,<br/>\nyou can do some stuff but don&#39;t be surprized if others are picked to join<br/>\ngroups before you.  It has nothing to do with player skill, very little to<br/>\ndo with class specific issues.
