The brief pause is about<br/>\n1 sec or less, but yes, I can&#39;t keep all 3 songs going in perfect harmony<br/>\nlike normal :(<br/>\n<br/>\nOf couse my having a pet that does 3x as much damage as me makes up for it<br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, the timing is just a *bit* screwy, it&#39;s that pause you have to work<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course all of this is assuming 1. it doesn&#39;t break charm early  2.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t resist charm, but those are to be expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nBien<br/>\np.s.  BTW, has anyone ever heard a wierd *boiiiiing* sound when lizzies are<br/>\ncasting?  It usually happens when I charm them, and they try to damage cast<br/>\non me, but I&#39;m protected, but not always<br/>\n<br/>\np.p.s  When charming, you might want to think about charming the casters. 1.<br/>\nThey do some mighty damage   2.  They seem to run out of mana during a long<br/>\nfight :)     Unfortunately, if they start a heal before you charm them, they<br/>\nstill heal the mob :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Adam Wasserman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve recently aquired the much coveted (by me at least) charm song. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; done some limited experimenting, mostly on very light greens so that I can<br/>\n&gt; get the hang of it, however I&#39;m finding the timing of this song to be<br/>\n&gt; something I just can&#39;t grasp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Generally I select a target, Charm, swtich targets and attack, Selo&#39;s,<br/>\n&gt; Hymn,<br/>\n&gt; they back to charm.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, I seem to charm too early every single time, the mob breaks<br/>\n&gt; charm and I get beat on for a full cycle while I try to get charm going<br/>\n&gt; again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if any of the more experienced bards on the list could<br/>\n&gt; offer<br/>\n&gt; any tips on timing this so that I can start singing charm as the mob is<br/>\n&gt; about to break out, rather than waiting until I get pounded.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I realize that I&#39;ll need to put in a lot of practice and that it will be<br/>\n&gt; hard to break the ingrained habit of making sure all my songs overlap.<br/>\n&gt; Just<br/>\n&gt; figured I&#39;d appeal to the list before spending 3 hours in teh newbie area<br/>\n&gt; perfecting my timing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Draelon Stormsong<br/>\n&gt; The Tribunal Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
