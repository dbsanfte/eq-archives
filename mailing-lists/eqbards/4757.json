The interface treats<br/>\n&gt; bards like casters, but that does not mean they can&#39;t alter the interface to<br/>\n&gt; accomodate this request.  Add a Harmony Ability (See Definitions below, esp<br/>\n&gt; #4a, courtesy of Meriam Webster&#39;s Online Dictionary).  This &quot;Harmony&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Ability could take the form of a button on the Abilities menu.  The Bard<br/>\n&gt; pushes the &quot;Harmony&quot; button and then depresses multiple songs in the order<br/>\n&gt; the Bard wants to play them.  The Server then starts each song and<br/>\n&gt; immediately shifts to the next song until the list is completed and then<br/>\n&gt; returns to the top of the queue.  To stop the auto-playing of songs, hit the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Harmony&quot; button and resume manual control.  Simple enough?  The idea is not<br/>\n&gt; without precedent.  [The auto-attack feature of the game is a similar form<br/>\n&gt; of redundancy elimination (which could also be enhanced, similarly to what<br/>\n&gt; is suggested here, to include special attacks like kick or bash or the<br/>\n&gt; myriad Monk abilities).]  There will be some resistance, perhaps even<br/>\n&gt; philosophical rejection, to any form of scripting, but keep in mind that<br/>\n&gt; this change would be completely voluntary for the user.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Actually, though probably not something easily coded into the game,<br/>\nthis is a great idea to reduce the twitch-a-mania bards face.
