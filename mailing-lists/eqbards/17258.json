After about a PII 300 your game performance has just about peaked as<br/>\nfar as the processor is concerned.  Not very much is handled by the<br/>\nprocessor anyway.  Most is handled by your Video Card and your Network<br/>\nInterface (modem or network card).  Also important is your sound card.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what discussions were held regarding the SB Live! 3d Sound<br/>\nsystems but I have had no problems with it other than when Verant goofed up<br/>\ntheir interface code and thus caused anyone using the SB Live! to have<br/>\nproblems.  It wasn&#39;t a deficiency with the card, it was a deficiency with<br/>\nthe software drivers and the EQ program.<br/>\n<br/>\nSystem Recommendation:<br/>\n<br/>\nAny PIII - Just because you&#39;re going to need those to do anything soon.<br/>\nPII&#39;s are out dated now :(<br/>\nRAM:  128mb +  (I&#39;d recommend going with 256) (I have 512mb ram and use 350<br/>\nof it as a Ram Drive for my Windows Swap File)<br/>\nHD:  Anything fast<br/>\nVideo:  TNT2 chipset or GForce DDR (The GForce DDR is better but cost wise<br/>\nthe TNT2 is adequate with the new NV15 coming out soon I&#39;d spend $50-$80 and<br/>\nget a TnT2 Ultra to hold you till then instead of a GForce)  A lot of people<br/>\nsay that Voodoo technology is better but only in 16 bit color.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsupport 32 bit at all and 32 bit is the future.  Also, the TNT2&#39;s video<br/>\nperformance is just as good as 2 Voodoo2&#39;s in SLI mode (though a bit darker<br/>\nwhich can be fixed by configuring the card).  And the GForce DDR is an<br/>\namazing improvment over that where the Voodoo5 or whatever that thing is<br/>\ncalled is just a speed improvement for the Voodoo3 3000.  Voodoo is a dying<br/>\ntechnology.  NVidia keeps raising the bar on graphics while Voodoo<br/>\ntechnology is sticking with the same platform and trying to speed it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound:  Currently I have yet to see anything better than either Turtle Beach<br/>\nor Sound Blaster<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.. and get a game pad ;)  EQ is wonderful with a good programmable game<br/>\npad.  I have a friend that swears by a programmable joystick though... hehe<br/>\neither way, it&#39;s better than using the keyboard and mouse for every darn<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\naka:  Lyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mike Roach&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 03, 2000 9:05 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] New messages<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of building a new machine, what do you recommend as far as<br/>\nhardware<br/>\n&gt; is concerned for a relatively high-end system that EQ will run well on?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I currently use Dual SLI Voodoo2 cards and glide drivers and I know there<br/>\n&gt; are issues with Mip mapping, gamma correction, and clip plane on other<br/>\n&gt; chipsets (TnT?).
