They damage my fantasy.  I *know* I can understand software, but can<br/>\nI be an effective, respected bard?  The first I do in real life.  The<br/>\nsecond is what draws me to EverQuest.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur abilities in the real world don&#39;t work by formulas and isolated<br/>\nnumbers.  I suggest that overall we&#39;d have more fantasy-life fun if we<br/>\ntreated the virtual world similarly, even when we know deep down it&#39;s all<br/>\nones and zeros.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
