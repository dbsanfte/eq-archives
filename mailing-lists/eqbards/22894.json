This means<br/>\nthat Root will suppress snare, but it will not overwrite it. That&#39;s the<br/>\nprimary change. But there is also a side effect to this change. <br/>\nBard songs will no longer break root. Root will also suppress songs that<br/>\nenhance movement. <br/>\nWe are aware that this will be seen as a &#39;nerf&#39;. However, I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>\nthat most of you understood that bard songs were never intended to break<br/>\nroot, and this is, in fact, essentially a bug fix. <br/>\n-----------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is pretty bad when I read something like this and think &quot;Great, now our<br/>\nchaining songs are going to be messed up because they forgot to test it on<br/>\nbards&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing this does demonstrate is that &quot;movement&quot; type spell effects can be<br/>\nsegregated...so why can they move bard song into a class of its own?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I really dont consider this a nerf since Verant has been saying for 2<br/>\nyears that bard songs should NOT break root.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
