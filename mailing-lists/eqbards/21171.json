I have a problem with people farming Fear<br/>\nfor several reasons going even beyond pride (or ego thing, whatever Lyrnia),<br/>\nand that&#39;s the chord your post struck with me, and I went overboard in my<br/>\nresponse.<br/>\nIf you get the chance to break Fear on a full pop, I would highly suggest<br/>\ngoing that route. As a bard you probably won&#39;t get much in the way of loot,<br/>\nbut it can be the most rewarding experience as far as fun, and sense of<br/>\naccomplishment from teamwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox:<br/>\n&quot;It neither offends me nor even comes close to making me laugh.  It&#39;s<br/>\njust not funny.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re entitles to your opinion(s) and particular sense of humor, wherever<br/>\nit may be.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nBig Daddy Legba:<br/>\n&quot;Why does it matter if people come in after your guild clears out fear? Are<br/>\nthey hurting you in any way? To be honest, you say how much it stinks to<br/>\nbreak the plane (deaths and time) but then criticze others for not wanting<br/>\nto do it themselves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd rightfully so. What I started with this is way off topic for this list<br/>\nand is already likely to be kabonged. I&#39;ll just say this - it&#39;s a free ride<br/>\nto nice gear. Plain and simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia:<br/>\n&quot;Generally speaking I just ignore folks who post anything about &#39;breaking&#39;<br/>\nfear being the &#39;proper&#39; way to do things.  It&#39;s a zone, like any other.&quot;<br/>\nBreak or not break doesn&#39;t matter.  Folks like Sartori just like to pretend<br/>\nthat you didn&#39;t &quot;earn&quot; your time in fear unless you broke it.  It&#39;s an ego<br/>\nthing nothing more nothing less.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally speaking I just ignore folks who post anything about there being<br/>\n&#39;nothing wrong with farming&#39;. But hey, I&#39;ll go ahead and finish this and<br/>\nthen read the other 3 posts you made on the subject. Nothing wrong with<br/>\ntaking pride in your accomplishments, but like I said above I have more<br/>\nreasons than that (maybe they&#39;re unique to me and my guild, hell if I know).<br/>\nThere have been several instances during fear raids where my crew has been<br/>\nfucked over by would-be farmers hoping the way was clear when it wasn&#39;t. But<br/>\nhey trains can happen like any other zone, I suppose...It&#39;s a &#39;zone like any<br/>\nother&#39; right? Hrmm why can&#39;t I zone my lvl 2 SK in and get some Umbral? It&#39;s<br/>\n&#39;just armor&#39; right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori<br/>\nBard of Norrath since beta 3 *shrug*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
