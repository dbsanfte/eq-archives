It seems<br/>\nthere are very few people who have spent the time to work on their begging<br/>\nskill.  I have taken it upon myself to master this skill and document the<br/>\nresults.  So if anyone is interested here is what I have found....<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I have spend all of my available practice points on begging.  (about<br/>\n37)  This put my skill up to 39.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting about a week ago.<br/>\nI started begging farmers in East Karana (conned green).  I used the<br/>\nCharasmatic Carrilion on them first with mino horn.  I begged constantly for<br/>\nover an hour with only 2 successes.  Each of which got me one dull copper<br/>\npiece and no skill increases :(  <br/>\n<br/>\nI then tried begging blue, yellow, and red NPC&#39;s.  I begged for another<br/>\nseveral hours over the course of the week.  Never seeing any successes, or<br/>\nskill increases.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also spent a good amount of time begging the boat to Odus.  (as was<br/>\nmentioned before you need to stand by the mast) and the boats in Lake Rath.<br/>\nThese attempts did not increase my skill at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried giving NPCs silver pieces before I beg.  In the chance that<br/>\nthey might not give me money if they dont have any.  No luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also developed an intresting bard technique, where I will target an<br/>\nNPC while running with Selo&#39;s.  Then right when I wizz by them I will hit my<br/>\nBeg hot key.  I ususally use this on red NPC&#39;s and while near a zone :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record.  I have begged hundreds of times now and while I have only<br/>\nrecieved coppers perhaps 4 times.  I have never been attacked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when I was wizzing by a green farmer in North Karana. I recieved a<br/>\nbeautiful copper piece and a lovely skill increase up to 40.  wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow all of this seems fruitless for the most part.  But I must find out if<br/>\nthe rumors about master beggers getting multiple platnum or fine steel<br/>\nweapons from NPCs.  I must know.  I must.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond with your comments or information if you have any.  Please<br/>\n... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin Tercet 21st Human Bard<br/>\non Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
