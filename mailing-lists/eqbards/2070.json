And you know, after an evening with my rapier and dirk,<br/>\nI have to agree with you.  I do look pretty good there, and in retrospect<br/>\nprobably looked more silly with a sword and rapier--what was I thinking<br/>\nheheh?  But I&#39;m still not ever wearing the bronze bird hat!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;J.M. Capozzi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:croak63@...\">croak63@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lore means that only one instance of a unique item may be possessed by a<br/>\n&gt;player.  Lore items of one type do not affect  lore items of another type.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, you can have a Dragoon Dirk, a Rubicite Breastplate, a Polished Granite<br/>\n&gt;Tomahawk, all tagged LORE, for instance, all at one time.  If you then try<br/>\n&gt;to pick up or trade another Dragoon Dirk(or any other lore item that you<br/>\n&gt;already have in inventory, including your bank), it simply vanishes, gone<br/>\n&gt;forever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This warrants some caution when looting mobs.  LOOK at the item before you<br/>\n&gt;pick it up, it  may be a lore item you already posses, or it may be a No<br/>\n&gt;Drop item.  Best to leave it on the corpse if in a group, and let the<br/>\n&gt;designated recipient pick it up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And the rapier/dirk look is cool, IMHO...reminds me of the old Musketeer<br/>\n </span></blockquote>era<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;duelists, who commonly used both a long blade and a dagger or main gauche,<br/>\n&gt;for parrying and extra attacks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you&#39;re REALLY concerned, there are several other dagger classed weapons,<br/>\n&gt;some very good, that you can aquire.  Jambiya, Obsidian Shard, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for a new hobby?
