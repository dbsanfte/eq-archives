I have<br/>\nbeen in Bouncer groups for over 10 levels now.  At 35 with 45&#39;s and<br/>\n49.999&#39;s, yes it sucks.  But when you are 45 or 49.9999 and there is no<br/>\nwhere else to go....  Well, some exp is better than none at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Ak&#39;Anon is a dungeon right? (Although I tried killing the gnome guards<br/>\nbut had to quit.  They are just too cute to kill &lt;sigh&gt;)  Brownies on the<br/>\nother hand... And Freeport is a city dungeon now.  The PoF Spectre cave was<br/>\nempty - of spectres that is - at midnight Sunday night because there were 3<br/>\ncampers there.
