I don&#39;t want &quot;half of the people in<br/>\nBlackBurrow&quot; to be there. However I agree that it can be tedious to find someone<br/>\nto bind during off hours. To fix that, we need to push for the idea that many<br/>\npeople have had which is to have NPC&#39;s that can bind you for a fee available at<br/>\ntemples (or where ever). This still keeps bind points in cities (giving the<br/>\nreward for traveling) but also allows people that play at off hours to be able<br/>\nto get bound without waiting hours for some kind soul to show up.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaelin, Songweavers of Kelethin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; No I think you&#39;d find people of more appropriate level there, and half the<br/>\n&gt; people in BlackBurrow would be there too since there are plenty of low level<br/>\n&gt; gnolls there.  In general it is binding more than anything that is keeping<br/>\n&gt; people from spreading out the way Brad wants them too.  It isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; uninteresting treasure, they just go get that when they know they can&#39;t die<br/>\n&gt; there, then complain because it is trivial to them at that level.  Binding<br/>\n&gt; keeps people close to cites, try playing at a non-prime time like I do many<br/>\n&gt; times when there are only 600 people on-line.  getting bound anywhere isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; just a pain, its often impossible.  I was unable to find anyone even capable<br/>\n&gt; of binding on all of faydwyr one morning, and so packed it in since a 40<br/>\n&gt; minute boat trip to recover a corpse is ridiculous.  this is my one and only<br/>\n&gt; real peeve with EQ, binding is given out as a &#39;skill&#39;, when in reality<br/>\n&gt; without adventuring can become ridiculously difficult, simply because there<br/>\n&gt; are not enough people playing.  That is unacceptable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
