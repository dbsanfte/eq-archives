Charm the blue 4-5 in a row doinf the basic charm and then run away.<br/>\n2. At this point you are at the very top of the shit list for this mob.<br/>\n3. Now find a green mob that can attack the blue.<br/>\n4. Charm it and get it to attack the blue mob.<br/>\n5. At this point you will notice that the blue mob will be chasing you<br/>\nignoring the green that is attacking it.<br/>\n6. Continue the charming of the greenie til the green kills the blue, the<br/>\nblue kills the green (you would go to step 3 again)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have successfully used this to kill Griffennes with the help of friendly<br/>\nGriffawns.  The only thing that you must be wary of are<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  If the creature is too green to the taget it will not attack it.<br/>\n2.  Your pet will pick up other mobs so you will have to resort to running<br/>\nin a circle to avoid picking up some extra mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 11 Nov 1999, JasonF wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand what is being accomplished here guys.  Please explain it<br/>\n&gt; using small words and speak slowly.  My base INT is only 75.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Crier<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if you only have a uber blue and some greens.  Charm the blue a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; few times.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He will now be agro against you and will ingnore you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; completely.  Now find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a green mob that is as fast as the uber blue and charm it and get it to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attack the uber blue.  What I found is a griffawn can take down a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; griffenne in about 4-5 charms on the Griffawn ^_^.  Got my charm in that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manner.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You know, this is really really clever.  I&#39;d been risking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; death by tossing a Chain on the mob that I wanted to lose, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I like your method better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; John H.
