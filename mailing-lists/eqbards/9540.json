Having heard the stories about the GM event<br/>\n&gt; and all the undead that had spawned in Kithicor I was more than a little<br/>\n&gt; edgey about travelling through the forest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I entered the zone from West Commons the ground was covered with<br/>\ncorpses<br/>\n&gt; that had yet to be reunited with their owners, needless to say this did<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; make me feel any better. I kicked up Selo&#39;s said a silent prayer to Karana<br/>\n&gt; and bolted down the path to the South. Just passing the HighHold marker I<br/>\n&gt; got a tell from someone asking me to hold a sec, so I did and was greeted<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; a Ranger who was looking for someone to do a corpse retrieval for a<br/>\nfriend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy take the path?  I&#39;ve always found it easier (and probably safer in these<br/>\ntimes) to stay on the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bernwyn </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
