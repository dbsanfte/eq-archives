As usual I ran in and made a<br/>\npull and drag some gobs out.  To ensure that they were agro on me I played<br/>\na healthly mixture of Lullaby and chains if it attacked my rogue friend.<br/>\nNow what I did notice was the fact that my chains never, not even once<br/>\nheld on a gob that was running away. An I am 100% sure that some of these<br/>\ngobs did not have any chance for a SoW to be cast on them.  SO I wanted to<br/>\nask if anyone else has had a similar problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
