I wondered why they had been zeroed out. Don&#39;t know about shamans.<br/>\nI know they don&#39;t get it before 20, and the one spell list I have seen that<br/>\nhas spells up that high didn&#39;t have it listed.  However, even if it is there<br/>\nat 29, it is a long time to go before you get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, though, this is still irrelevant to my main premise,  which is that<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t a compelling need for melee classes to be able to bind or bind<br/>\nanywhere.
