There are 4 conditions that must be<br/>\nmet in order for /assist to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  The person that you wish to assist must be your target...(pretty safe<br/>\nbet that everyone has this part aced =P)<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  You must be in melee range of the assistees target<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  The assistee must hit the target, and the one that gets everyone.......<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  The mob must hit the assistee!!  Then assist is 100% reliable.  If the<br/>\nmob doesn&#39;t hit your targeted assistee, chances are you&#39;ll be assisting<br/>\nnothing (i.e. attacking your puller)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is how I used to do it, pre-macro. I target the puller before he<br/>\nleaves, and type /assist without hitting enter, wait until I read that the<br/>\npuller has hit and been hit by said mob, and then hit enter (or you can just<br/>\nhit enter before he leaves and scroll through your typing and hit it again<br/>\nwhen he returns).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs of the macro patch, I have a macro set up that starts like so:<br/>\n<br/>\n/assist<br/>\n/pause 30, /cast X<br/>\n/pause 1, /stopsong<br/>\n/say Have at thee!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I proceed with my twisting!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland<br/>\nBastard Half-elf of<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found, regardless of what group make up I&#39;m in or what the puller is<br/>\nusing to pull, /assist can&#39;t be trusted.  I&#39;ve begun twisting songs only to<br/>\nnotice halfway through a battle against a single mob that I&#39;ve got no<br/>\ntarget at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have it hotkeyed, but as soon as possible in a fight I mouse click<br/>\nwhatever appears to be the main target just to be sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, newbie for life, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                    John<br/>\n                    Tatsukawa            To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n                    &lt;john@tatsuka        cc:<br/>\n                    wa.com&gt;              Subject:     Re: [eqbards]<br/>\n                                         Enchanter stuns, /assist<br/>\n                    10/12/2000           problem<br/>\n                    05:32 PM<br/>\n                    Please<br/>\n                    respond to<br/>\n                    eqbards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:19 PM 10/12/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;At 02:17 PM 10/12/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On Thu, Oct 12/00, John Tatsukawa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At 01:49 PM 10/12/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;All enchanter stuns are aoe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; /boggle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Really?!

Was very<br/>\ninteresting that my cleric&#39;s stun/holy might would stun giants, yet the<br/>\nenchanter stuns would never stick. We may have to experiment with WTYH at<br/>\nsometime as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for AOE stun based around the caster, now I understand why you were<br/>\nsaying they could mez more utilizing stun than they could with just AOE<br/>\nmez.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed something that could very well be a bug. My wife (druid)<br/>\nwould pull froggies to us. I&#39;m sitting next to her so I see what she is<br/>\ntargetted on. I push my &quot;/assist &lt;char_name&gt;&quot; button and interestingly,<br/>\nfind that I&#39;m targetted upon a different frog. (Of course &lt;char_name&gt; is<br/>\nfilled in with her character&#39;s name)<br/>\nIt has wreaked a little havoc having our necro Dot&#39;ing the wrong frog. It<br/>\nhappens intermittantly to us during pulls. I&#39;ve asked my wife to keep her<br/>\nautoattack on even when returning to the camp to see if that helps, but it<br/>\nhas made no difference. Sometimes we have the right frog, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
