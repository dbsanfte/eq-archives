Where did you get this info? I have two mule<br/>\n8)characters on a<br/>\n8)friend&#39;s account (one in Freeport and one in Kelethin) that<br/>\n8)exist mostly to<br/>\n8)hang onto spell research components, since there are enough<br/>\n8)different ones<br/>\n8)to fill most of a bank account.  I also use them when I need to give<br/>\n8)something to someone but don&#39;t want to hang around waiting<br/>\n8)for them -- I&#39;ll<br/>\n8)give the item to the holder character, tell the person to let<br/>\n8)me know when<br/>\n8)they get to the bank, and then log that character in to<br/>\n8)transfer the item.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think they frown upon a mule that is used to exploit the limited stats<br/>\nthat we start with. Most prevelent is your main character that you pump up<br/>\nthe physical or mental stats and a mule with major charisma used solely for<br/>\ngetting better prices. As far as just having an extra character for storage<br/>\nor meeting purposes, I personally don&#39;t see anything wrong with it. Even<br/>\nfrom a roleplay perspective you could consider it as a henchman. You have 8<br/>\ncharacter slots on each server after all. (Don&#39;t fill em all up just cause<br/>\nyou can though! =))<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOne thing I recall from MUD days (least the ones I played on) was that they<br/>\nbusted people who had alts. These systems often had limited resources and<br/>\nthus limited player slots. If you had an alt then there was one less person<br/>\nout there who couldn&#39;t have a character.<br/>\n<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)* You commented that twinking is not approved of by Verant<br/>\n8)and may result<br/>\n8)in character deletion. This is definitely not true. Verant<br/>\n8)has said that<br/>\n8)they don&#39;t care, and that the game has some balance factors<br/>\n8)that prevent<br/>\n8)low level characters from gaining huge advantage from powerful items.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTwo versions of twinking. First is the giving of powerful items to very low<br/>\nlevel characters. As you state there are some &#39;proficiency&#39; factors that<br/>\nmake using these powerful weapons less effective. Second is the practice of<br/>\nhelping a low level character defeat a mob that is way beyond their level to<br/>\nget major experience. I think this is guarded with the grouping exp window<br/>\nand a seeming cap on how much experience you can earn in one kill.<br/>\n\tVerant had an anti-twinking policy during Beta Phase 3 which would call for<br/>\nthe end of your beta testing if caught. They did this so they could get an<br/>\nidea of how the levelling was balanced between the classes. Twinking would<br/>\nskew the results.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
