I commute down GA 400 one of the main arteries into<br/>\nthe city.  It&#39;s slow bumper to bumper traffic the whole way.  Last week as I<br/>\nwas travelling into work I glanced over to my left.  There was a bright red<br/>\ncar, followed by a bluish red car, followed by another bright red car.  What<br/>\nimmediately popped into my head concerning the middle driver was, &quot;Hmmm,<br/>\nhe&#39;s out of the zone.&quot;  It made me grin.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday at work they are pulling lines to place more PC&#39;s in my work area.  As<br/>\nthey were pulling a line it ran over a piece of upright aluminum and made a<br/>\nnoise.  My immediate thought was, &quot;Gnoll!&quot;, because it sounded exactly like<br/>\nthe throaty growl that they make when standing at ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nI program for a living and am presently taking an antibiotic because my<br/>\ndaughter brought home &quot;strep throat&quot; from school.  I am finding it very hard<br/>\nto concentrate at times and the thought sprang into my head, &quot;I wish someone<br/>\nwould cast clarity on me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the TV networks changed the time of one of their shows to a less<br/>\ndesirable time slot and upon hearing the bit of news thought, &quot;Uh oh, they<br/>\nnerfed it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tell me, am I the only one?<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jasonf@...\">jasonf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 23, 2000 1:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Welp... it was me :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[46 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
