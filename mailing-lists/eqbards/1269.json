This means you can only use it to &quot;stun&quot; in a<br/>\nsafe battle, where you have one or two monsters and no real chance of<br/>\nstrracting others. Which brings up an interesting point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do way better in outdoor zones, because in a dungeon not only can I not<br/>\nrun, but I am afraid to use my really cool area effect songs (The Level 15<br/>\nLullaby, The Level 20 Weakening Song, to name a few).<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone used these kind of songs in a dungeon, and if so what was the<br/>\nresult? Killing your group? I know it can only effect 4 creatures . . .<br/>\nthis can be an advantage, right? At most you piss off three things other<br/>\nthan the one you&#39;re attacking, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil Tearsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;On-topic comment for those paying attention:  What about suggesting a song<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;that causes a stun - nothing else, just a stun.
