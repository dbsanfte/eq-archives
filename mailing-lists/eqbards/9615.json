Do not casually walk by a wolf before being sure what it is.<br/>\nThose enraged dread wolves hit me for 97 and cast nasty necro spells and are<br/>\nred to me at level 34.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, walking along the very edge of the zone is safer, but there are a few<br/>\nmobs who DO wander up on the side of the zone, quite far up the side wall.<br/>\nAll of the ones I have seen are wanderers though, so if you see a skeleton<br/>\nin front of you along the side of the wall, wait a few minutes and he&#39;ll<br/>\nleave.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia d&#39;Allaney</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
