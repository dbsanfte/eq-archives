I just got the EQ Trilogy and <br/>\n&gt; installed everything, seems to run ok.  I now have a level 3 Bard <br/>\n&gt; with whom I&#39;ve been practicing singing.  He is now up to &quot;Feeble&quot; <br/>\n&gt; does this mean i can start singing?  Do I need to learn songs?  How <br/>\n&gt; do i do that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can sing from level 1. It requires you to buy the songs from a song<br/>\nvendor.<br/>\nAt level 3 you have two songs which is really usefull:<br/>\n1. area effect (AoE) dot<br/>\n2. battle buff (Chant of battle)<br/>\n<br/>\nBe carefull about the AOE dot getting close to guards with it running is not<br/>\na thing to do.<br/>\nYou should also learn about &quot;twisting&quot; which enables you to sing 2 or 3<br/>\nsongs at the same time.<br/>\nIt requires some practice to get down, but once learned your group members<br/>\nwill bow in awe for you :)<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, is the game supposed to run in full screen? I have it on <br/>\n&gt; 800x600 and it doesnt fill the screen.  And at higher resolutions the <br/>\n&gt; game screen gets smaller.  Mind I have tweaked voodoo3 drivers <br/>\n&gt; running in XP so i can use Glide with other games so that could be <br/>\n&gt; the culpret.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hit F10 and see what happens ;o) <br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum, almost retired minstrel on Bertox<br/>\nMusiker Danesang, Skald on Lancelot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
