Had an idea, though, tell me<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you think.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I think you&#39;ll find that at higher levels, the players DO appreciate a<br/>\n&gt; bard,<br/>\n&gt; and actively seek them out, if there&#39;s not a regular one in their cadre.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; By that point, the newbie curse of the bard has worn off, there&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; confusion in the upper level players mind about what a bard can do.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; And, by default, if you&#39;ve taken a bard to the 40&#39;s and beyond, you have<br/>\n&gt; &quot;proven&quot; yourself to be skilled in bardic ways and a good social animal as<br/>\n&gt; well.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Not to mention that not only do you have an active support role, you have<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; active combat role as well, and neither requires you to sit on your duff<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; 10 minutes after each fight, staring at a spell book.  And, when you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; along, of course, you minimize that for others as well.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; As far as boosting bardic power, it&#39;s already done.  At 45th level, (or<br/>\n&gt; pretty much any level after you get Hymn, for that matter) you DO see the<br/>\n&gt; health bar move at an appreciable rate, as well as the mana bar, when a<br/>\n&gt; bard<br/>\n&gt; is along.  A single bard in a group of 6 can flat outheal a cleric over<br/>\n&gt; time, doing around 1200 hp per minute per person in the party. The<br/>\n&gt; offensive<br/>\n&gt; powers of a bard are subtle, but still very potent.  DDD was added to give<br/>\n&gt; them a bit more rapid firepower in limited situations, for there are times<br/>\n&gt; when nuking is handy.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Anyone who thinks a high level bard is weak has a serious perception or<br/>\n&gt; education problem.  There&#39;s been an ongoing debate internally for months<br/>\n&gt; now<br/>\n&gt; about bards being, if anything, too powerful, and nobody internal, even<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; staunchest bard advocates, have ever claimed they were weak, not since<br/>\n&gt; phase<br/>\n&gt; 2 (before that point, many classes, including the bard, were in a much<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; unfinished state).<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I think one of the defining moments for a bard is when they<br/>\n&gt; find<br/>\n&gt; themselves no longer memorizing Bellow, even when solo.  I won&#39;t expound<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; that, when that time comes, you will know.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; So, fear not, unless you&#39;ve done something of a personal nature to make<br/>\n&gt; others hesitant to group with you, you&#39;ll not lack appreciation for what<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; bring to the table.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; (end paste)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Make of this what you will. Personally, I think that the first poster<br/>\n&gt; turned<br/>\n&gt; out to be a bit more correct in his predictions than the guy who answered<br/>\n&gt; him.  And the scary thing is that the guy who answered him has since shed<br/>\n&gt; his &quot;guise of the deceiver&quot; and is now a VI employee.  I really like the<br/>\n&gt; part about bards being able to heal more than clerics &lt;snicker&gt;. It just<br/>\n&gt; does not work that way in how this game gets played. To be fair - he may<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; have had much experience beyond level 45 at that point and with only &quot;old<br/>\n&gt; world&quot; zones - certainly does not seem to consider the current use of a<br/>\n&gt; main<br/>\n&gt; tank and complete heal that most everyone uses in combat. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.s. 1500 of the 1659 items are from June, July, August & September of &#39;99<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;good ole days.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
