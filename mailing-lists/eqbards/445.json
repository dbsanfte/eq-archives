The longswords stats are 6/26.<br/>\nNumerically, the longsword is superior, but it costs something like 56 plat.  The<br/>\nscimitar on the other hand, is something like 43.  If you are buying a weapon for<br/>\nthose special occasions when you need to hit a magical critter, but not to use as<br/>\nyour main weapon, the scimitar is probably good for your needs, particularly if<br/>\nyou&#39;re somewhat strapped for cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking to buy the weapon you&#39;re going to hand down to your<br/>\ngrandchildren when you retire after using it for years, then go with the<br/>\nlongsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf money is absolutely no object, then buy a Well Balanced Longsword from the<br/>\nShady Swashbuckler in the East Commons tunnel.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBasil Eckert wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Basil Eckert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:athelas@...\">athelas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail fellow bards!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think about buying my first magical weapon right now and wanted to know<br/>\n&gt; what kind of 1HS combine weapons do exist in the game. I&#39;ve just heard about<br/>\n&gt; a combine longsword which you can buy at the gipsy camps. Are there other<br/>\n&gt; combine weapons, maybe with better stats than the longsword? I just dont<br/>\n&gt; wanna pay all my money for a combine longsword just to hear 1 day later that<br/>\n&gt; there would be a much better combine bastardsword to buy for just 10pp more...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Athelas<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Sent through Global Message Exchange - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net\">http://www.gmx.net</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the Week! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
