Had<br/>\nmyself (35 Bard), 44 Paladin, 46 Shaman, 44 Rouge, and 51 Warrior.  I was having<br/>\ntrouble selecting which songs to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Shaman was speeding and Primary healer. I was there for Crowd Control (I had<br/>\nan easy time with and blues and Zols which are low Red but hard time with Wan&#39;s<br/>\nthat were Yellow), Manasong, Snaring and ?.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 3 Song weave was Cantana (34), Snare (23) and Chant of Battle or Damage<br/>\nShield. After a while the Shaman got enough mana back after buffing to<br/>\nslow/speed etc.  So I switched to Chant of Battle primarily.  During downtime I<br/>\ndid straight mana and depending on our condition would weave Cantana in as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat other suggestions for Song Selection do you guys/gals have? I also had<br/>\nPixie, Charm, Heal song, Manasong, and Area Fear mem&#39;ed. At level 35 what else<br/>\ncould I have done? I know I could have used Elemental Rhythms (MR/FR/CR) or even<br/>\nGaurdian Rhythms (MR). Any other suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any suggestions and help.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ranian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
