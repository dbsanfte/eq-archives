I don&#39;t get to play <br/>\nto often so I depend on this list and boards for fighting tips with my <br/>\nbard so I don&#39;t have to go totally from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night in Cazic Thule I was in the Throne Room. I am a level 30 <br/>\nbard in Full Lambent my Charisma is about 145-150.  We had been there <br/>\nabout 45 minutes and our Enchanter had to leave. Someone in teh group <br/>\nsaid &quot;No problem the Bard can handle crowd control.&quot; :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh boy... the last time I tried this (before mezz was fixed) I got the <br/>\ngroup killed.  After I got my hot keys arranged with Charm, Pixie <br/>\nStrike and other hot keys I went to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we had the room broken the most that came was 3 pulls. So I <br/>\nwould charm 1 and attack another and keep them busy while the group <br/>\nfinished off the toughest monster. I would try to weave in healing or <br/>\nAnthem before Charm broke. Then the group would finish off the most <br/>\ndead 1 I was handling while I charmed the other to attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say charm (in this case) worked so much better than mezz for <br/>\nme. I was able to affectively keep 2 mobs busy and never got below <br/>\nhalf health the entire time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo again thanks for the tips on crowd control. They were very helpful <br/>\nas all I had to do was get my hot keys in order and go to town. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRanian Aeleroth<br/>\nBard of the 30th Song</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
