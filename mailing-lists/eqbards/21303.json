My reasonings why<br/>\nare all assumptions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Assume Verant will have same problems in terms of customer service and<br/>\ngame balance that they have had with EQ.  Their track record is the basis<br/>\nfor this assumption.  Only way I see improvement in this arena is if<br/>\nLucasArts handles this responsibility or holds Verant&#39;s feet to the fire.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  The Star Wars movies are all about special individuals performing heroic<br/>\nevents.  These events took place in both on land and space.  Gonna be really<br/>\nhard to include both aspects of gameplay in one game.  Some people will want<br/>\nto be Jedi Knights, who will likely spend most of their time on land doing<br/>\nspecial missions/quests.  Others will want to be fighter pilots, making<br/>\nattack runs on things like the Death Star and Imperial capital ships.  No<br/>\nidea how they will handle the players who want to be diplomats or smugglers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  The Star Wars universe spans numerous worlds.  The settings for the<br/>\nmovies were on three of these worlds.  The follow on books expanded the<br/>\nuniverse.  Most MMORPGs take place on one world (Norrath, Sosaria, Dereth<br/>\netc).  So for SWO to capture the spirit of the movies and books, events will<br/>\nhave to span multiple worlds.  My guess is that everything will take place<br/>\non Coruscant and that it will be very similar to Anarchy Online (OmniTek<br/>\ncorporation vs Rebels).  <br/>\n<br/>\n4)  By franchise name alone, SWO will attract a lot of new players into the<br/>\nMMORPG genre.  Unless they spend a lot of time following gaming websites,<br/>\nthese new players will have no idea of Verant&#39;s reputation with EQ.  They<br/>\nwill buy the game expecting to be able to perform like like their favorite<br/>\nStar Wars characters.  IMO, this will turn out to be a major disappointment<br/>\nfor most of them.  Don&#39;t expect most of these new gamers to maintain their<br/>\nsubscription.<br/>\n<br/>\n5)  So the end result is that the most hyped MMORPG up to date based on the<br/>\nmost popular movie franchise of all time will likely be a failure in terms<br/>\nof gameplay.  Potential investors in future MMORPGs will know that SWO was<br/>\nnot successful.  They may not be inclined to invest in future MMORPGs based<br/>\non the poor outcome of SWO.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI admit this is all worst case scenario.  Definately a possibility though.<br/>\nIf it does occur, sure hope NWN turns out to be as good as it promises.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Big Daddy Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 08, 2000 6:49 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Official confirmation from Ester<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI could not agree more.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant will pay for what it does when it comes out with Star Wars and EQ2.<br/>\nPeople are too ingrained in EQ to leave just for &quot;bad attitude&quot; (ofr the<br/>\nmost part, obviously a few ARE leaving).<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it this way.
