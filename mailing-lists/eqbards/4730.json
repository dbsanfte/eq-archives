Against<br/>\nMagic casters it was<br/>\n<br/>\nGuardian Rhythms to pull<br/>\n Warsong/Guardian/Bellow or Dischord depending on the location<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am adding Largos binding so against non casters I figure it will<br/>\nchange to<br/>\n<br/>\nWarsong/Lago/Dennons Disruptive Dischord for the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this level the healing song is still useless in the fight correct? Any<br/>\nthing I am missing?<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the bronze armour question was raised, my Str is 80 (85 with item<br/>\nbuffs) I am sticking with the Dwarven tunic until I find something better,<br/>\nthose 33 heat/33 cold/33 magic resists are still nice to have around. I<br/>\nforget my total AC, but my current armour set (weighing in around 50)is:<br/>\n<br/>\nBronze helm (sorry, the wood elf/bronze look was to good to pass up, no<br/>\nother reason for buying it *blushes*)<br/>\nBronze mask<br/>\nOnyx earrings (+2 dex)<br/>\nSpiked collar (+3 str)<br/>\nBronze shoulders (hope to replace with Blood Stained Mantle)<br/>\nDwarven ringmail tunic(12 AC, 33 heat/33 cold/33 magic resist)<br/>\nLizardscale Cloak (+5dex)<br/>\nBarbed arms(+2 dex)<br/>\nBanded bracers (bronze is WAY too heavy for little gain, currently searching<br/>\nfor an &quot;exotic&quot;)<br/>\nElf-hide gloves(+5 agi, dex, JUST got them have wanted these forever, I like<br/>\nto imagine they are Teir&#39;Dal :o)<br/>\nDervish rings<br/>\nPurity belt(dex,str, I have been THINKING of a thick leather apron just for<br/>\nthe AC, but there is also an Elf-hide belt, no idea on stats, just that it<br/>\nis Bard only)<br/>\nBronze legs<br/>\nBronze boots (which HAVE to go, they are way to heavy, but I haven&#39;t found a<br/>\ngood replacement yet)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions or idea would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz D&#39;Kith (or will be when a GM helps me, /surname accepts no<br/>\npunctuation)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
