If there is a memory blur component it is _very_ weak.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy CHA is 104 (still waiting to get another Opalline Earring and/or the Veil<br/>\nthat increases CHA - perhaps the leather foot raider cap), but I could never<br/>\nreliably pixie strike a faerie guard in lesser faydark.  Often times they<br/>\nwould attack me immediately after it&#39;s &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; (even though I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t in attack mode).  For that reason, I considered the song to be mostly<br/>\nuseless - but then again that&#39;s the only time that I&#39;ve used it.  Also, I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound that MOBs can get off their spell faster than I can Pixie Strike them<br/>\n(even if I sing it immediately after they go into cast mode).  I used to<br/>\nconsider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I started using it<br/>\nagainst Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll definitely keep<br/>\nplaying with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by charm, lullaby,<br/>\nscreech, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 10:46 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Mesmerize vs. Charm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 6 Oct 1999, David Knadler wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pixie Chase does nothing more than stun a creature.

A stun<br/>\ncannot be broken by an attack.  A mesmerize can.  So Pixie<br/>\nStrike is indeed a mesmerize.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I can tell.  I once tried to Pixie + Hymn my way back to full health, but<br/>\n&gt; the duration of it seems to be all over the board (as long as 10<br/>\nseconds...<br/>\n&gt; as short as 1 second..)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your charisma?  At 120 charisma against medium blues or<br/>\nlower, I&#39;d say it lasts full duration about 80% of the time -<br/>\nhigh enough that I generally weave two other songs with it.  <br/>\nAgainst high blues it&#39;s not as effective and tends to last a<br/>\nshorter time - I either just Strike over and over, or mix in<br/>\none other song.  The resists don&#39;t help either.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that while Strike+Hymn is the only way to make this<br/>\nviable while soloing, just Striking over and over can be<br/>\nvaluable in a group when everyone is OOM, low on health, and<br/>\nthere&#39;s one mob left to kill.  You can pause it long enough<br/>\nfor everyone to get enough mana and hp to kill it comfortably.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always have this song memorized, even when grouped with an<br/>\nenchanter (they can go linkdead, or get a mob attacking them<br/>\nto where they can&#39;t mes anything much less the three other<br/>\nmobs the rest of you are fighting).  This song gives you<br/>\nsomething no other song does - time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
