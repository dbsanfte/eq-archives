I was impressed.<br/>\nA lot of unique things in DAoC that you don&#39;t see in EQ but might wish you did.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few examples:<br/>\n1.)  Equipment and Armor degrades as you use it.  If it degrades far enough<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have to run to town and get it &quot;refreshed&quot; to keep the stats up.<br/>\n2.)  Any player can bind him/herself to any city/town/village bind point.<br/>\nCommmand:  /bind<br/>\n3.)  Seems to be a lot more low and midlevel quests for experience.  Every visit<br/>\nto &quot;guild master&quot; presents a new quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started many characters in each of the realms to &quot;try&quot; them out, didn&#39;t get to<br/>\nlevel many of them up very far.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all that comes to mind at the moment.  If you&#39;re playing feel free to<br/>\nelaborate.<br/>\nStill need to run out and get my copy of DAoC, Beta is over and I&#39;m cut off at<br/>\nthe moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>\nDrewt Drumslinger<br/>\n23rd Level Half-Elf Bard of Veeshan<br/>\nSolusek Ro - The Burning Prince Deity<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;For every reaction, there is an equal and opposite action&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
