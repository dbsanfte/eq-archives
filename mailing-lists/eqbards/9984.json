This section is a series of questions and answers regarding<br/>\nmagic-related issues and subjects. The person answering the questions is<br/>\nVerant Game Designer Geoffrey Zatkin, aka the Arch Mage of Norrath. Here&#39;s<br/>\nan excerpt:<br/>\nWhy are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 49?<br/>\nWhen we was finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave some room for<br/>\nexpansion during the evolution of EverQuest. Because Bards get one song per<br/>\nlevel, if we had given them all fifty songs there would have been no room<br/>\nfor expansion - aside from taking away older songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpect to see new songs coming soon. These songs will not be anything that<br/>\nradically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions that help<br/>\nkeep the Bard interesting at high levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Geoffrey!<br/>\n-Aurum @ 6:09 PM PT<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
