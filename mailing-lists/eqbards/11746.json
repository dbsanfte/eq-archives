I had spent a long<br/>\ntime the previous weekend waiting for gloves that never showed up, and<br/>\nfigured I would stick my head inside to see if I could get lucky.  I<br/>\nzoned in, and what did I see at the top of the ramp but a named Gypsy<br/>\ncarrying a Lute (and her pet).  She conned blue to me.  Now, I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nprepared to whack a blue and a pet, so I /ooc&#39;ed to ask if anyone would<br/>\nbe willing to help me out.  As she started to leave, two guys showed up<br/>\nand started to hit her.  &quot;Great!&quot;, I figured, here&#39;s the help I asked<br/>\nfor, so I piled on.  Through some miracle, I actually got the<br/>\nexperience, and looted the Lute of the Gypsy Princess.  This is cool, of<br/>\ncourse, but not particularly useful - I had really wanted the Gypsy Lute<br/>\nfor my armor - but, as a Bard, I was very happy to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did /tells to both of the others to thank them.  One sent back a short<br/>\ngrumble, the other said, essentially, &quot;Sure, anytime you want me to do<br/>\ndamage to something so you can KS it from me, just ask.&quot;  Apparently<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t responding to my /ooc.  After some /tells back and forth, I<br/>\ndetermined that they had been camping the music room for four hours,<br/>\ntheir group had just been trashed, and the two of them had gone back<br/>\ninto MM to get the Lute that they knew was at the top.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do I do?  I gave him the Lute.  Kind of a bummer, I go from<br/>\nbeing really elated at my extraordinary stroke of fortune to being<br/>\ndepressed at being thought of as a KSer, but it seemed the honorable<br/>\nthing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;m wandering away, I get a /tell from the guild leader of their<br/>\nguild, who was a member of the group they were in.  He tells me to come<br/>\nback; they were retaking the music room and, in thanks for my<br/>\nconsideration, he intended to have them give me the first lute that they<br/>\nfound.  And they did!  Not only that, but it was the Gypsy Lute that I<br/>\nhad really wanted anyway!  Sometimes life makes you smile, after all.<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 35 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
