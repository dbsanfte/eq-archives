I know I lose my song<br/>\nwhenever bashed for damage.  I nearly died fighting three green no xp<br/>\nzombies last nite because:<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA) Every time I sang Lullaby they all nodded, and all happily<br/>\nsuffered no song<br/>\n\t   effect and kept bashing away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tB) Every time I tried to start another song I&#39;d get bashed for 1<br/>\npoint of damage <br/>\n\t   and have to start &#39;casting&#39; all over again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tC) Couldn&#39;t do enough damage to kill 3 green no xp mobs without<br/>\nspells before <br/>\n\t   they did 4 bubbles to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean wtf?  True they were barely no xp greens probably, but still.  What<br/>\ngood is crowd control if it does absolutely nothing.  If Lullaby isn&#39;t<br/>\nbroken it is seriously flawed.  Last nite was especially bad, more like<br/>\nJohn(tm)&#39;s experiences with Kae where every green that nods is unaffected.<br/>\nI must have nodded mobs over 200 times last nite that kept right on<br/>\nattacking.  I guess they can just fight in their sleep or something.  After<br/>\nfour successive nods, a green no xp gnoll reaver finally went to sleep...<br/>\nfor one whole pulse.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 30, 1999 12:51 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Selos and trains underground<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lake, causing trains that are unannounced and very high level.
