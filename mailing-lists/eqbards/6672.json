Every time I turn around I am getting a new mailing<br/>\nfrom a friend of another class about the cool new quest they have that<br/>\nallows them to obtain this or that magic weapon or armor usuable only by<br/>\ntheir class.  Warrior only weapons are everywhere it seems, which actually<br/>\nmakes some sense, but the number of other class specific weapons I have<br/>\nheard of in the last two months in staggering.  I was also told that some<br/>\npreviously Rogue/Bard weapons are now Rogue only?  Anyone that can confirm<br/>\nthis?  I suppose I may be getting more info on this than most people as all<br/>\nmy friends know I am working on a magic weapon collection, but it still<br/>\nseems a bit unbalanced that we are rapidly becoming the only melee class<br/>\nwithout magical weapons devoted to our class.  Heck, Druids and Clerics both<br/>\nhave class specific weapons now, not to mention all the other melee classes.<br/>\nDoes anyone on this list have any connections to Verant from BETA days?  I&#39;d<br/>\nsure like to think we are going to get some attention as they are creating<br/>\nnew quests and class specific items, but have seen no particular mention of<br/>\nour class in anything Verant has posted.  I&#39;m not usually one to fly off the<br/>\nhandle and love playing a bard even if it becomes the worst class in the<br/>\ngame.  Still it is irking to have a friend email me with the cool new<br/>\nShadowknight only weapon, or another with his cool new dwarf only armor.<br/>\nHow about some equal time for us bards? <br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
