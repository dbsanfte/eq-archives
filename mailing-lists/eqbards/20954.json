Now I watch closely for my spell messages.   I&#39;ve filtered out the battle spam, which is<br/>\nhelping.  But if my spell colors would just show up a different color from the necro&#39;s and the druid&#39;s<br/>\n(and the NPC&#39;s - which I think should be able to be made yet a third color) my life would be so much<br/>\neasier.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyressa Treesilk<br/>\nBard of 26 recent deaths in Cazic-Thule<br/>\nThe Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.
