I have only met one <br/>\nperson with a bought account that I liked and trusted, and that&#39;s because he <br/>\ncame into it knowing the game. Most of these ppl buy these high level <br/>\naccounts, but have no clue what they are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine you are camping the something in guk, some lvl 50 asks to join the <br/>\ngroup, but doesn&#39;t know how to get to dead tower??? I&#39;ve gotten killed by <br/>\nthese lvl 50 newbies a few times and refuse to group with them ever again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Quellious of the 50th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> (scott brisko)<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Twinking Causes a Crisis of Faith<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 1 Dec 1999 10:02:29 -0800<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a similar problem, but not directly related to twinking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I started playing EQ with a friend of mine, and since he had much more free<br/>\n&gt;time to spend on his chars, he was able to advance far ahead of me with a<br/>\n&gt;number of characters, but usually he would have one that he was working on<br/>\n&gt;that was near my level so we would hang out and adventure together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Recently I turned another friend of mine on to the game, someone who had<br/>\n&gt;been very addicted to UO and did not think EQ was going to be that much <br/>\n&gt;fun.<br/>\n&gt;He started a character and was moving up the levels pretty quick, but then<br/>\n&gt;at about level 15 he decided that the whole process was taking to long, so<br/>\n&gt;he bought an account from E-Bay with a 50th level character and a couple of<br/>\n&gt;20-30 levels characters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At first this really did not bug me too much, and while I tended to look<br/>\n&gt;down in general who bought accounts from E-Bay, I cut him some slack. But<br/>\n&gt;now it is really starting to cause some bad feelings, mainly because he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;off adventuring in the planes Guk, Sol B, etc. and I am still looking at<br/>\n&gt;another 3-4 months at my pace of play to even get into the 40&#39;s where I<br/>\n&gt;might be able to try those places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It really make me wonder what I am putting all this work into. While for <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;most part I still have fun, on the nights when I join up with the world&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;most inept group or worse can&#39;t find a group I begin to think about hanging<br/>\n&gt;the lute up and calling it quits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know this is not something any one of us can change or fix, but I thought<br/>\n&gt;I would put it out there to see if anyone else had a similar experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bernwyn Ablesong<br/>\n&gt;Mith Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
