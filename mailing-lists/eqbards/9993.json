Not that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;useful or anything, but it amuses the party in those boring <br/>\n&gt; down moments.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(The &quot;you&#39;re not scaring anybody&quot; message still cracks me <br/>\n&gt; up.)  I also<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have fishing close to maxed, and begging at nearly 70.  With <br/>\n&gt; fishing I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can yank in a fish almost every cast now (which replenishes <br/>\n&gt; a low food<br/>\n&gt; &gt;supply quite quickly).  Begging, on the other hand, stinks.  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never<br/>\n&gt; &gt;managed to get more than a silver.  But, by Mithaniel Marr, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m gonna max<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it just to see if it ever gets better!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 32 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Acutally ID is usefull when you are Fear/Chaining, as it <br/>\n&gt; gives an extra fear <br/>\n&gt; chance which never hurts.  In the last two nights I have <br/>\n&gt; raised my ID 14 pts <br/>\n&gt; to 57, long boring camp for a Guise.
