The first time a 2nd mob that is SoW&#39;d gets feared you may<br/>\nwish you never tried this!  I had this happen in Lake of Ill Omen and the<br/>\ncarnage was spectacular.  I figure at least 10 characters were slain before<br/>\nthe goblins stopped pouring out of the mines.  All from one additional mob<br/>\nfleeing down the cave mouth because I ran by with fear.  Do not attempt this<br/>\non Giants in Frontier.  They will flee right by the castle wall and your AoE<br/>\nfear may hit a giant on the other side.
