Not very many people here agreed with me (some of them disagreed <br/>\nrather disagreeably), so I thought I would give it some time before I responded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t like it.  It&#39;s a great idea.  It&#39;s the wrong place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy level 11 warrior was killed two times attempting to go from Freeport to Rivervale <br/>\nand back, both times while on the wall, both times in mid-afternoon, both times from <br/>\ncreatures that were not visible to her when they started nuking her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy expectation at the time Kith was modified, which has proven to be correct, was <br/>\nthat, once the initial interest wore off, there would not be enough players in <br/>\nKithicor to keep it clear.  Mid Friday evening, there were 30 players there during <br/>\nthe Kithicor nighttime.  Not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy expectation also was that these very high level monsters (with very large aggro <br/>\nradii) would create some big trains at the zone points.  Right again.  Blundered <br/>\ninto one coming in from WC, blundered into one at HK, blundered into one leaving RV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that it is possible, by taking a MUCH longer route (and a route which is <br/>\nstill much more dangerous than the route used to be), that one can in theory get to <br/>\nHigh Keep.  But tell me how a low-level gets to Rivervale?  What other city is <br/>\nsurrounded by such dangerous territory (for the native inhabitants of the city, at <br/>\nleast)?  I sure would hate to start a Halfling in the current EQ.  Kithicor on one <br/>\nside, Runnyeye/Beholder on the other?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does a tradesperson do the Freeport/Rivervale/High Keep/Qeynos run now?  (S)he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on, but you get the point.  I still can&#39;t figure out why they didn&#39;t do <br/>\nsomething over in Erudin, or upgrade one of the lower-level dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 33 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
