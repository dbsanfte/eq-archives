Hehe, wearing it purely for the AC, have<br/>\nhad no luck whatsoever trying to get a runed lava pendent.  Even broke down<br/>\nand tried to camp it myself yesterday. Problem was I didn&#39;t know where the<br/>\nlava elemental spawned, so I was wandering around semi-aimlessly when the<br/>\nlava elemental found me.  I was at half health at the time, and he gave me a<br/>\npretty sound thrashing.  Tough little bugger for a greenie.  Eventually I<br/>\nhad to resort to fearing him off while I healed myself up (I was down to 78<br/>\nhit points).  At full health I was able to take him.  Dropped a crappy<br/>\npotion.<br/>\nI&#39;ll probably swap out my shoulders for the crested as soon as I dig up a<br/>\npair.  (yeah, I know, they&#39;re easy to get)<br/>\nI&#39;m going a little AC nuts lately, but it really seems to make a difference,<br/>\nso I&#39;m trying to squeeze as many points as I can.  One of the rangers in my<br/>\nguild is even more extreme, he&#39;s started wearing 10AC, -7MR rings, just to<br/>\nget his AC as high as possible :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 08, 2000 6:14 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Imbrued gloves?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ncrested is highest AC i know of for bards, that&#39;s what i wear (i know i lose<br/>\nDEX, but i wanted to break 800 hehe) and i can&#39;t get a cloak upgrade with<br/>\nonly 500pp in the bank.  you can wear a hero bracer, i can&#39;t.  you also have<br/>\nthe advantage of wearing an imbrued helm full-time (i have to wear a froglok<br/>\ncrown, i have gotten *cough* screwed *cough* out of a couple tranix crowns,<br/>\nbut i am gonna be borrowing one soon).  i can only wear mine to give people<br/>\na laugh.  and i get 0 AC from my haste sash.  i have to save up a lot more<br/>\npoints and get lucky to grab an RBB.  very nice stuff Elwyn.  we have very<br/>\nvery similar equipment (the RBB being the biggest difference).  what&#39;s the<br/>\nstats on the mithril torque?  i grabbed myself a runed lava pendant recently<br/>\nfor the neck slot.  i know the torques are easy as hell to get as most<br/>\npeople don&#39;t care one way or the other if they get one, unless that has<br/>\nchanged recently cause of its AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Powa, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L45 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Greg Gillan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ggillan@...\">ggillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 815AC now, check it out if you&#39;re interested.
