When JM posted<br/>\n&gt;he pointed out that the binding issue was a huge philosophical/design<br/>\n&gt;argument by the designers at Verant (we don&#39;t know how accurate his sources<br/>\n&gt;are - but it rang true)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As to the philosophical issue, they can scrap it. Taking an hour to bind at<br/>\nprime time (remember, just because others can bind doesnt mean they will) is<br/>\na hassle. Many times I have entered a off the track town (Halas, RV,<br/>\nKaladim) and been the only one there. Makes adventuring unfun knowing if you<br/>\ndie its a long walk. I am not saying that any class other than the actual<br/>\ncaster classes should get the bind spell, but being able to be bound by one<br/>\nof those classes anywhere would not disrupt the balance too much if they<br/>\nmade it equal to all classes by implementing the same thing as after being<br/>\nresurrected. You respawn at half hps, mana, stat hits, etc. It would skirt<br/>\naround the issue of exploiting by binding in a lair somewhere, and having<br/>\nthe melee classes constantly charging to die again. (though most forget that<br/>\nwhile caster classes dont necessarily need thier equip, melee classes and<br/>\nhybrids are equip dependant and dont function effectively without it)<br/>\nOn the real subject of the NPCs casting bind, I don&#39;t see how it would be<br/>\nthat big of a deal. NPCs are around that will cast healing or cures for<br/>\neither a donation or an item, the casting of the bind can be set up to do<br/>\nthe same thing. Easiest to do would be set it up on the priest of discord.<br/>\nTheres one in every city, so it could easily be accomplished (at least in my<br/>\nmind, if they can set npcs up to cast the heal spell, should be able to<br/>\neffectively cut and past - crude terminology I know - the code onto another<br/>\nnpc with the bind spell replacing the heal spell.)<br/>\nAs for bards getting the bind spell, it would be nice, but a pipe dream I<br/>\nthink. With my bard I bind at the bank, grab my spare drum (I keep a few<br/>\nextra) and zip back to corpse in no time. Giving the bard bind opens the<br/>\ndoorway to other classes binding (rangers use druid spells and druids get<br/>\nbinf, pals use cleric spells which can bind, etc) and that is an issue<br/>\nVerant doesnt want to touch. Gate potions though have been introduced into<br/>\nthe game, so a bind potion as well seems feasible. Make it city only like<br/>\nthe spell. If you try to get the melee class bound outside the city it<br/>\nfails. I would only assume the potion (procing the same spell) would have<br/>\nthose same guidelines.<br/>\n<br/>\nKragan<br/>\nMM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
