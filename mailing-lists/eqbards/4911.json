If you go <br/>\n&gt; into the tunnels<br/>\n&gt; beneath Freeport you will bump into a human standing beside a a dwarf.<br/>\n&gt; When you talk to the dwarf he will mention how much he misses <br/>\n&gt; Kaladim.  To<br/>\n&gt; alleviate his homesickness you give his human friend some <br/>\n&gt; dwarven ale and<br/>\n&gt; bang you improve your faction with the Freeport Militia.  BTW if the<br/>\n&gt; Freeport Militia hate you, the people of Freeport will hate you also.<br/>\n&gt; Except in North Freeport since the Paladins run that area.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt; Honour Guard, Karana  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
