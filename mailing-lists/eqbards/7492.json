I can personally attest that it is often very difficult<br/>\nfor me to get a bind because of the time zone I live in.  When I do get to<br/>\nplay, its usually after 9PM Hawaii time.  Thats midnight on the west coast<br/>\nand 3AM on the east coast.  What I usually end up doing is picking a zone I<br/>\nwant to adventure in and staying there for a couple of weeks.  I don&#39;t go to<br/>\na new zone unless its a weekend and I can spend more hours playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; If I lived in Hawaii like some on this list<br/>\n&gt; I would despair of ever getting bound in my what would be my prime playing<br/>\n&gt; hours.
