It&#39;s easier to<br/>\nbalance a game when tweaking monsters does not result in<br/>\nchanges for the players, and vice versa.  So most RPGs end up<br/>\nwith different rules for players than for mobs.  One of these<br/>\ndays someone will make a game where this is not the case, and<br/>\neveryone plays by the same rules...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And does anyone know how &quot;stunning&quot; works? It seems like whenever I am hit,<br/>\n&gt; I am auto-stunned half the time, whether it was for 50 points, or 1 point of<br/>\n&gt; damage I receive. Does it have anything to do with my armor? With my Stamina<br/>\n&gt; or Strength scores? Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it just depends on the monster&#39;s level compared to<br/>\nyours.  Stuff that used to stun me all the time when it was<br/>\nwhite or yellow either never or rarely stuns me when it&#39;s<br/>\ngreen, even if I&#39;m running around without any armor.  Bashes<br/>\nknock you out of your song every time, regardless of how much<br/>\ndamage it does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll also point out that stunning is why melee classes are so<br/>\nscrewed on the PvP server.  The game is designed so that<br/>\ncasting classes are balanced if the things they are fighting<br/>\ncan stun the caster frequently.  Aside from the few<br/>\nclasses/races which can bash, players cannot stun each other,<br/>\nand so the melee classes become sitting ducks to the casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
