The particles would appear, but<br/>\n&gt; no one would get the icon or spell message.  When there was no fight<br/>\n&gt; going on or I wasn&#39;t hasted the song would work fine.  Does anyone knwo<br/>\n&gt; what was going on?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second question, when fighting Avocets I could not get binding to stick<br/>\n&gt; at all, so I was trying to think of something to replace it with.  I<br/>\n&gt; sung guardian rhythms (for the little ac buff).  Any suggestions for<br/>\n&gt; songs to sing when the mob is too high level for my songs to affect<br/>\n&gt; them?  I sing Hymm, Anthem/COB, but I need a third song for that<br/>\n&gt; melody.  I am lvl 21, so no Psalm yet.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt DeBarger<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Would you like to save big on your phone bill -- and keep on saving<br/>\n&gt; more each month?
