I went up to my<br/>\nmax in just about 3-4 hours.  It was really funny though because when I got<br/>\nback after dinner, there were players standing around wondering why I was<br/>\ndancing with my horn.... because everytime they walked within range the song<br/>\nwould make them glow and I would do a silly jig.. I wouldn&#39;t have noticed<br/>\nbut I was in external view.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin<br/>\n18th level human bard <br/>\non Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 04, 1999 12:55 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Wind-practicing spots<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I have found many spots to practice my Wind and Brass skills.  A<br/>\nfew choice locales that are easy to get to are:<br/>\n1.  Follow the right hand wall as you leave Qeynos, heading to QHills.  As<br/>\nsoon as you zone into QHills you will be in a spot that no MOBs go anywhere<br/>\nnear.  Make sure you have plenty of food and drink, equip the appropriate<br/>\ninstrument/song combo, and go see a movie while your character skills away.<br/>\n2.  As you leave HPH going into EK, follow the left wall to where it opens<br/>\nup and allows you to go relatively far up the wall.  No one and nothing EVER<br/>\ngoes there.  Set the character up with the appropriate song/instrument<br/>\ncombo, and grab a good night&#39;s sleep.<br/>\n    As a good rule of thumb, any place in along a  zone&#39;s edge where folks<br/>\nusually don&#39;t go (for lack of MOBs to kill, merchants, etc) is a good place<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nI like 21 so much I&#39;ve gona back to it several times now :oP<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  Will killing the Kerrans over and over ruin my faction with<br/>\nanything/anyone important?  The only faction hit is to Prexuz (sp?)  the<br/>\nOceanlord.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\nprograms, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
