Hmm, don&#39;t know the<br/>\nbank?  Ok, wander around until you find the room with the room clerk or<br/>\ninnkeep? Then at the other end of that room is a way to go downstairs.<br/>\nExplore until you find the banker behind a counter. Now at the other end of<br/>\nthe bank is another stairs going down - next to a miner.  Go down those<br/>\nstairs and look for another flight going down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, this is the first pickclaw room - pickclaw guards spawn here.  Off to<br/>\none side is a room where 2 pickclaw lookouts spawn (weakest ones of all<br/>\npickclaw gobs - prolly too green)  At the other end of this room - you<br/>\nguessed it - another set of stairs - this is called the ramp.  The first<br/>\nroom on right is the warrior room.  Warriors are the next stronger ones from<br/>\nguards.  Follow the hall further down and you will find the raider room -<br/>\nwhere the strongest of all spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 32, you can be in either raider room or warrior room groups.  Typically,<br/>\nyou go down and ask groups if there is room for you - stating level and<br/>\nclass.  You may have to wait 20 or 30 minutes for an opening - or camp<br/>\nguards until an opening in warrior room or raider room is offered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week - Flurry Dovesong - a bard was camping high keep - she prolly<br/>\nstill there.  Tell I said hi!<br/>\n<br/>\nOther places:  South Karana - harriers and avocets  - partner or group,<br/>\nmaybe solo; Cazic Thule - Tae room or 4C  -- definitely grouped; Sol-A with<br/>\na good group; Sol-B maybe a bit young unless you get in a good group with<br/>\nsome experience.  Rathe Mts - cyclops - grouped or good partners. Hill<br/>\nGiants - def a good group.  Oasis - spectres - def a good group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t solo - but some do - Choon & Froon in West Karana with charm.  Some<br/>\nclaim they do HG&#39;s in  Rathe Mts with charm. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case - welcome!
