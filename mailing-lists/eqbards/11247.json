Nothing in my or Weiland&#39;s note<br/>\n&gt; deserved the dressing-down in Keith&#39;s note.

I never<br/>\n&gt; complained about GM&#39;s not &quot;running to help me&quot;.  The tone of the note was<br/>\n&gt; completely uncalled for - and this seems to be happening more and more on<br/>\n&gt; this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another gig Thursday - late one - so I can&#39;t get on after.  I had a =<br/>\ndate Friday - and a gig Saturday (great week huh - four gigs and a =<br/>\ndate!) but I got home again around 1:00 AM last night.  I petition for =<br/>\nhelp - and all the guide says is - &quot;Get a Wizard or Druid with group =<br/>\ngate to get out&quot;.  Wonderful.  My Druid buddy had just logged - and =<br/>\nsomeone in my guild mentions he&#39;s not going to be back until Wednesday =<br/>\n(which turned out to untrue - but whatever)..  I start to panic because =<br/>\nmy corpse will disappear on Tuesday (they only last a week right?)  I =<br/>\nstart telling a paladin friend - who mentions he has a Druid character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the passage from you that made me think you expected a GM/Guide to come to your rescue. Maybe it<br/>\nis the odd way of run-on sentances, seperated by hyphens, but that is what it looks like to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd from Mr. Hobson. (Since we are on a first name basis).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Michal Hobson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJeez that sounds familiar.  Same thing happened to a ranger and a warrior<br/>\nfrom my guild.  Same spot and all.  And in our situation, the GM&#39;s still<br/>\nsaid tough sh*t.  We finally managed to do the CR after a 6 hour stint with<br/>\nthe help of a level 30 something Shaman and Druid.  It was a nightmare.<br/>\nGlad it worked out for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same thing I saw in your passage. GM&#39;s said tough sh*t. Looks like he disagrees with the whole<br/>\nGM/Guide can&#39;t assist you thing either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most importantly - while not bard related - I think I posted information<br/>\n&gt; that is useful to other bards.  Especially the part about how I was able to<br/>\n&gt; zone into Sol B to get out of that tricky spot.  What are Guides supposed to<br/>\n&gt; do but Guide?  They can&#39;t fix bugs.  There is more use for them than simply<br/>\n&gt; helping people who are victims of bugs.  I would hope there is more customer<br/>\n&gt; service in this product that I am paying for.  The guides didn&#39;t even know<br/>\n&gt; that you could get into that area and not get out the way you came.  (The<br/>\n&gt; first guide at least.  I /petitioned simply to ask what to do - I never knew<br/>\n&gt; anyone who died that way and wanted to simply know how to get it out.  He<br/>\n&gt; said - get someone with levitate and drag your corpse out...)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey look. There is the whole meaning of my post. Look at it again. Was it a flame?<br/>\nNot once did I say anything derogetory. I said &quot;Why is it that people seem to have it in thier head that<br/>\nGM&#39;s and Guides must help you if you cannot get<br/>\nyour corpse?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy post was nothing past a post telling people that they must take responsibility of thier own actions.<br/>\nNot to expect help from a GM/Guide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I NEVER asked a Guide (never got a true GM) to do anything but give me<br/>\n&gt; advice.   Well eventually they said &quot;Find someone with group gate&quot;. Well I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; level 29 in a dungeon designed for my level.  Group Gate comes at that same<br/>\n&gt; level I do believe.  Randy Keith is high enough level to go after a dragon -<br/>\n&gt; so I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s mid 40&#39;s or higher.  At that level you take it for<br/>\n&gt; granted that you know a lot of people who can group gate.  I know two.<br/>\n&gt; Exactly two - no more.  Trying to schedule to be online at the same time as<br/>\n&gt; then can be very difficult.  It was looking very possible that I WOULDN&#39;T<br/>\n&gt; have been able to schedule that in the week before my corpse decayed.  I<br/>\n&gt; would have lost all my equipment I accumulated in 29 levels.  Asking a<br/>\n&gt; stranger to risk dying themselves on a such a corpse retrieval just &quot;isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; gonna happen&quot;.  I feel sorry for the people that DON&#39;T know anyone who can<br/>\n&gt; do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You forget that even if I am high enough to fight Dragon&#39;s now. I once had to go through the low levels<br/>\nmyself. Same as you. I have died going linkdead in Sol B just as often as you have. I have been careless,<br/>\nand fell off the ledge. It happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; People have been (IMHO rightfully) complaining that there seems to be<br/>\n&gt; inconsistencies in the way bards are being treated in the game.  &quot;We have to<br/>\n&gt; fix exploits with levitate - so lets make the spell not renewable while<br/>\n&gt; running&quot;  OOPS - we forget to think about what that means for the bard song.<br/>\n&gt; Oh you can&#39;t target your corpse in lava?  Let me  fetch it for you. - but if<br/>\n&gt; you can - you are on your note.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let me tell you something about inconsistancies. They added an &quot;Anti-Kiting&quot; patch a while ago that<br/>\naffected my main class more than it did the ones they were targeting. It happens to all the classes, some<br/>\nmore than others, but this has nothing to do with my post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In closing - the nature of a forum based on written communication can be<br/>\n&gt; difficult - because it&#39;s very easy to be lazy and read the first few<br/>\n&gt; paragraphs and not bother to try get the tone of the writer.  It&#39;s easy to<br/>\n&gt; decide the guy is full of sh*t and show the world how much more intelligent<br/>\n&gt; than they you are with a quick flame.  You can point out how much harder you<br/>\n&gt; had it when you had your body under a dragon and the wimpy 29th-level only<br/>\n&gt; had lava to contend with.  He had no business even posting it to the<br/>\n&gt; EQ-BARDS list!  He needs to be put in his place!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see a flame here. Sorry, but it is plain as day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not lazy. I read it all. Down to the date you had. I still saw the &quot;Gm&#39;s told me there was nothing<br/>\nthey could do. Wonderful&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never once said I was smarter than you. Never once said you had to be put in your place. What I did was<br/>\nstate that GM/Guides are not there to help you if you are in trouble of your own making.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for a wimpy 29th? No such thing. We were all at that level too. We have been there, and had the same<br/>\nfrustrations. I would not look down on anyone cause they are a lower level than me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m sick of seeing people write flames.  I often see  things I strongly<br/>\n&gt; disagree with - but usually just let it go (however this time I can&#39;t let it<br/>\n&gt; pass).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did not flame. My post was not angry. It was not even specifically sent after you. Why should I let this<br/>\ngo past me? Add fuel to the &quot;GM&#39;s suck&quot; attitude that is prevelant throughout the servers?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; chal Hobson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, December 05, 1999 7:31 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Michal Hobson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; flaws.
