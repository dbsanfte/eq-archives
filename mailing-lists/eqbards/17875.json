In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd control.  Whenever<br/>\ntwo things came in on a pull, I would charm the second, command it to /pet<br/>\nguard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a ways away, and<br/>\nreassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>\nenchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>\nclerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I heard through the grapevine of a bard on another server who<br/>\ncharmed the Key Master in the airplane to attack Sirran the Lunatic.  The<br/>\nlucky bard took such a faction hit that he is now scowling to all quest<br/>\nNPCs in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, 50th composition in progress<br/>\nCazic-Thule                      &lt;The Relentless&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
