I have now gotten 12 emails from non-bard friends<br/>\nasking me if the &quot;See Invisible&quot; enhancement is the only one not working or<br/>\nif we got totally screwed again.  It still raises the same question for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow in earth, Heaven, and Hell can they possibly defend the position that<br/>\nthey test changes when they put in something like this and it is patently<br/>\nobvious it does not work!  30 seconds of testing maximum and its apparent to<br/>\nanyone with more visual acuity than the aforementioned Stevie Wonder that it<br/>\ndoes not friggin&#39; work!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n\t&lt;Sigh, Just got out of a meeting on testing accuracy&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sylly Songsynger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 04, 2000 9:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Archmage Answers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;raises hand&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it maybe too early to &quot;tell&quot; what is really going on.  I dont know<br/>\nif the fact that they are posting the story about GZ having (and testing<br/>\nwith) a different client code than customers get is good or bad.  It maybe<br/>\nthat all the P.R. is lagging behind the reality of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly dont know if they yet understand the need (or do they even have<br/>\nthe means) to test the stuff they release.  Who in their right mind would<br/>\nput up all the P.R. stuff (release message, GZ answers, etc.) and address<br/>\nconcerns with &quot;go look, it&#39;s in the patch, we did good...&quot; and then have the<br/>\npatch be so botched.  Something is terribly amiss.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo those guys who posted: &quot;should I be able to see myself invis...?&quot; I gotta<br/>\nsay, it sure seems like the &quot;release notes&quot; talk about what you can expect<br/>\nin the next release rather than the current release.  If I had just landed<br/>\nhere from another planet and was learning the language by comapring what<br/>\nthey write to what they do, that would have to be my interpretation based on<br/>\nhow they behave.  And its been like this for as long as I have been playing<br/>\n(April &#39;99.) So, yes you can expect to see yourself and party when invis,<br/>\nbut not in this release, this is merely the &quot;announcement release.&quot;  Look<br/>\nfor it in the next release with is the &quot;fix our mistakes&quot; release.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, that is just the technical aspects.  Hehe, funny how we expect that the<br/>\nsoftware should actually work right.  Now about the &quot;design&quot; or &quot;vision&quot;<br/>\naspects.  They seem to have some plan to make certain classes &quot;manadatory&quot;<br/>\nfor certain situations.  Wiz to gate you into planes, mage have mana things,<br/>\nnecros same, bard same.  But as far as fine tuning for bards - no, I dont<br/>\nhave any &quot;good&quot; feelings that something nice will happen. A hint that the<br/>\nnext song might be something &quot;cool&quot; ? Scares me, to be honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now we have been playing this game for nearly a year.  Does anyone have<br/>\na clue about the actual &quot;lore&quot; of Norrath?  What have they done to tell us<br/>\nsome history?  Why do you raise live frog faction by killing un-dead frogs?<br/>\nThey try, I guess, the Kithicor thing was tied to some tale about Lany&#39;s the<br/>\ndaughter of Innoruuk but where is the follow thru?  NewPaw has some tale<br/>\nabout the new gnolls displacing the olds ones.  Dynamic quests in game?<br/>\nThey have enough trouble with GM&#39;s duping and selling items on Ebay - so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t expect anything to happen with any dynamic quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me finish this so it does not sound like just more ranting and raving.<br/>\nI still really enjoy many other aspects of this game.  Last night, I arrived<br/>\nto meet my group in OOT and was greeted with: &quot;Glad to see you! Only 3 days<br/>\nlate!&quot;  Hehe, well, that&#39;s true.  It was 3 night&#39;s ago they told me to come<br/>\nmeet them and it took me 3 nights to get from Rathe Mts to OOT.  Why?<br/>\nBecause I meet people along the way and have some adventures.  There is a<br/>\nlot to get from the game if you look to the other things besides killing<br/>\nNPC&#39;s for either loots or xp.  There are reasons for doing both.  You can<br/>\nget more out of the game if you depend more on yourself and less on Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 04, 2000 8:52 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Archmage Answers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Fri, Feb 04/00, Benjamin Jerrad Segal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:birdman@...\">birdman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Benjamin Jerrad Segal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:birdman@...\">birdman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Enter Geoffrey.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else feel a bit disappointed by this?
