I have had frogs spawn in front<br/>\nof me, behind me, next to me, and practically on top of me,<br/>\nand never had one see through invis in those cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted I wasn&#39;t checking when the song pulsed, so I can&#39;t<br/>\nreally refute your second hypothesis.  But I actually think it<br/>\nworks the opposite way.  On several occasions, I&#39;ve had a mob<br/>\nspawn next to me while I was fully visible, and I&#39;ve managed<br/>\nto run a safe distance away without aggroing it.  I think<br/>\nmobs are inactive for a few seconds when they first spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother place you&#39;ll notice this &quot;mobs /con indifferent while<br/>\ninvisible but attack you anyway&quot; effect is on the live side of<br/>\nLower Guk.  The minotaurs seem to be particularly good at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know certain mobs can see invis, and that invis can fail, but neither<br/>\n&gt; I nor the poster got &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pay no heed to that message.  I&#39;ve gotten it close to a<br/>\nhundred times, and I&#39;ve only become visible after it once.  <br/>\nOTOH, there have been several dozen times when I&#39;ve suddenly<br/>\nbecome visible without the message (after the message was put<br/>\nin).  I really think they goofed and the message makes it<br/>\nimpossible for bards to become visible, but we do occasionally<br/>\nbecome visible due to lag and PL.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
