If the others were taking damage, you should<br/>\nprobably use Chant of Battle instead of Anthem.  With casters<br/>\ntanking, the attack speedup of Anthem is laughable.  Chant<br/>\nwithout a drum buffs str by half the amount of Anthem, but it<br/>\nalso increases dex and AC.  If you&#39;re using a drum then it&#39;s<br/>\nno contest - Chant will increase str by the same amount as<br/>\nAnthem, and dex by the same amount as str (Anthem does not<br/>\nboost dex), and gives double the AC as without a drum.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
