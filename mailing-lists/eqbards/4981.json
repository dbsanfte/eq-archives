I&#39;ll mash my NumLock key to start<br/>\nrunning, switch to my hotkey bank that holds my meelee and inv slots and<br/>\nstart swapping, all the sudden I&#39;m not running anymore and/or my Selo&#39;s has<br/>\nbeen ended. Now I have either stand still and finish swapping weapon &<br/>\nshield for an instrument or I have to mash the NumLock again, switch back to<br/>\nmy songs hotkey bank, hit Selo&#39;s (several times lately before it works),<br/>\nswitch back to my slots bank, finish swapping items and hope I&#39;m still alive<br/>\nin the time that it took to do the above. <br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis happened to me all of the time.  To solve it, I put Selo&#39;s into the #6<br/>\nspot on my inventory hotkey bank.  If I get stunned or Selo&#39;s stops whilst I<br/>\nam trying to switch to the drum, I just hit &quot;numlock&quot; to start running, &quot;6&quot;<br/>\nto get Selo&#39;s going, and then try to complete the weapon/drum switch -- none<br/>\nof that &quot;shift-X&quot; crap is needed to switch hotkey banks.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanulf<br/>\nBard of the 13th Measure<br/>\nTunare Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
