That&#39;s right, the lvl 1 song with the tamborine -<br/>\nespecially with procing weapons -  they start counting how many times the<br/>\nweapons go off!  So I usually will do the tried and true, CoB, Celerity, and<br/>\nlargo&#39;s or Niv&#39;s a tank heavy group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the group is a balance of tanks & casters, thats when I use beserkers -<br/>\nI am getting the str buff and speed buff for one song - toss in a chant of<br/>\nflame or furfils, and a third thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKerouac Dharmabum<br/>\nlvl 49<br/>\nRodcent Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lyrnia Jongleur&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lyrnia@...\">Lyrnia@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 02, 2000 2:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Back to good stuff, LOOT! and Levels!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bzzzz, wrong answer.  40 or 41 are both crappy songs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 40 is single target dispell which doesn&#39;t work and 41<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uhh I LOVE Disenchanting Aria!  (40) and it&#39;s AWESOME.  I use it to drop<br/>\n&gt; damage shields ALL the time.  Our enchanters never bother memming dispel<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; I have this loaded.  It&#39;s a fantastic song and I find it extremely useful<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; any dungeon with casters that throw damage shields or buffs of any kind on<br/>\n&gt; mobs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is a psalm of something I believe (yep, confirmed it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on the song analysis page).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I find that the only psalms I use are warmth, cooling and the two with<br/>\n&gt; &quot;cure&quot; components.  And those I use VERY rarely.  For the most part the<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; really useful psalms are warmth and cooling (though the anti-poison psalm<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; nice vs Maestro and other Lifetap/Poison mobs).  I have yet to run into a<br/>\n&gt; disease based attack that really makes me feel it necessary to load up the<br/>\n&gt; other psalm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
