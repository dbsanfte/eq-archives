Not too dramatic..:)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know I get dual wield at 17, and that sounds nice but I was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; wondering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what it maxes out at and if its better to get dual wield for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2 1h slashers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or to invest in a 2h slasher like a bibs?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can&#39;t increase your skills with 2-handed weapons, so stick to<br/>\n&gt; practicing<br/>\n&gt; 1-h blunt, 1-h slash & pierce.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your using a long sword at level 7?  You&#39;re doing better in life than I<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; at your age.  I&#39;m using a bronze mace right now until my 1h blunt gets<br/>\n&gt; maxed.  Then I&#39;ll break out a short sword.  I&#39;ve already maxed piercing<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; my level with a FS rapier someone was kind enough to include in a trade<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; a HQ bear skin I&#39;d looted.  Look to get a combine weapon as soon as you<br/>\n&gt; can.<br/>\n&gt; No idea how much they cost as I can never find a vendor selling one.<br/>\n&gt; (grrr)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; happy hunting<br/>\n&gt; Evulia<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tCombine weapons are sold at the gypsy camps.  As far as I know there<br/>\nare 4.  One in Oasis, one in North Karana, one in Lavastorm, and one in<br/>\nRathe Mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI&#39;m not sure which camp sells which weapons (it used to be that<br/>\nLavastorm sold the only piercing ones, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true anymore)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe one in Oasis and North Karana are the easiest to find.  Combine<br/>\nweapons sell for about 50-70pp depending on what your looking at (the 2h<br/>\nones are more expensive, but you won&#39;t be buying those)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
