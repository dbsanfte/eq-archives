The descriptions kind of confused me, I<br/>\nhate the 12-hour timer, and I&#39;ve been stuck dragon hunting or gathering<br/>\nexp in Sebilis for a level or so, hardly the places to test things.  But<br/>\nI was looking for the Ancient Jarsath in FV the other night (any hints?<br/>\ndoes he have a PH?) and figured I&#39;d try them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of Highsun - described as &quot;Stun, Cancel Magic, Shadowstep&quot; on<br/>\neqsongs.  Shadowstep is described on eqcasters as &quot;short distance self<br/>\nonly gate travel (900 feet)&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure what 900 feet equals.  What<br/>\nthis song does (I really should have tested it by targetting myself,<br/>\nI&#39;ll try that next) is Shadowstep the TARGET.  So it gates the MOB.  The<br/>\nmessage is:  &quot;&lt;mob&gt; gates.&quot;  2 of 7 times I used this, the MOB<br/>\nreturned.  The other 5 times it did not.  This was in FV, so those MOBs<br/>\nmight have run into some enemies.  I need to test it further to see just<br/>\nHOW far it throws them.  It was out of visual range (on a pretty flat<br/>\nsurface) in any case.  Has some interesting implications, and sounds<br/>\nREALLY dangerous.  You can probably kill people using this on a blue<br/>\nserver by singing it on the MOB they&#39;re fighting and hoping it trains<br/>\nthem.  (I&#39;m surprised Verant didn&#39;t think of that to begin with.)  I did<br/>\nfind it pretty useful soloing; you can use it to summarily dismiss the<br/>\nadd-on junk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of Midnight is described as &quot;target:  fear/SoW&quot;.  In fact, it&#39;s AE<br/>\nfear/SoW, as I discovered when I sang it near some guards.  :(  This is<br/>\nin some ways more useful than normal fear, since the SoW lets the MOBs<br/>\nrun a lot further before the song expires, and they have to return at<br/>\nnormal speed.  It buys you more time, in other words.  And I suppose it<br/>\nis possible for them to get out of range this way (although they do not<br/>\nappear to do so if you stand still).  The drawback is that, since they<br/>\ngo farther, they can train more stuff back to you.  I&#39;d probably use<br/>\nthis instead of the other fear song if it weren&#39;t for the 12-hour timer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other observations?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, &lt;Silent Justice&gt; Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
