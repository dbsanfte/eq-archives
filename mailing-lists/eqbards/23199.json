This past weekend I was grouped with an enchanter.<br/>\nI had Chords of Cessation memmed but was not singing it until the enchanter<br/>\nslowed the mob.  During one fight the enchanter was late slowing the mob so<br/>\nI went ahead and used Cessation.  After my song went into effect, the<br/>\nenchanter cast his slow spell.  I got a message saying the my Cessation song<br/>\nwore off immediately followed by the message that the enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>\nstuck.  I got the Cessation effect &quot;wore off&quot; message before the song&#39;s<br/>\nnormal duration passed.  So it appeared that the enchanter&#39;s slow spell<br/>\noverwrote Cessation.  So what I am wondering is if the enchanter slow spell<br/>\nactually negated Cessation or if the enchanter&#39;s slow message was an error<br/>\nand his slow did not stick?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J.

I<br/>\ndid not test any of the songs against the higher level Ensnare.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has always been my understanding that our slowing effects stack with<br/>\nEnchanter or Shaman slowing effects (but previous to the last patch would<br/>\nblock them if our song was up on the mob when the spell was cast).  If my<br/>\nabove testing proves to be true, this means that we are &quot;value added&quot; to<br/>\nenchanters and shaman both now, at least from a mana and slowing standpoint!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to seeing if you guys get similiar results!<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon of Bertoxx<br/>\n55 Troubador<br/>\nGuild Leader, Defenders of Aleria<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
