He&#39;s not sitting down by the fire and<br/>\nentertaining the patrons with Chant of Battle or worse yet Chords of<br/>\nDissonance.  Those are songs that have special qualities to enable him to<br/>\nsurvive the trip to his next gig.  The songs that he sings in the inns would<br/>\nbe songs he learned before he was given his Bards Guild Membership.  The<br/>\nsongs you have to buy are magical and are sung for the magical effect, not<br/>\nfor the entertainment value to the listeners, so when you have achieved the<br/>\ndesired effect you proceed to another magical verse for another effect.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
