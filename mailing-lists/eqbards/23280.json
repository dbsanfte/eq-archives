And, realistically, we have to keep<br/>\nthe ideas to things that won&#39;t require a team of artists and programmers to<br/>\ncreate.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;ve gleaned so far, filtered through my own ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealing:<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids (and Shaman) want to be better at healing. Not only would this give<br/>\nthem a more active roll at the end of the big raids, while at the same time<br/>\nreducing perceived &#39;need&#39; for clerics at such times. But we also have to<br/>\nkeep in mind that healing is the clerics role, and we do not want to<br/>\ninfringe on that role.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the proposal is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nMove Superior Healing to 49th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy - a<br/>\nfast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing<br/>\nthat won&#39;t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing<br/>\nspells.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe add another healing spell at 60th level - perhaps Divine Light (though<br/>\nI&#39;d rename it...)<br/>\n<br/>\nReduce the fizzle rate on druid healing spells at the 50+ level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 18, 2001 7:59 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OT Complete heal (was Numbers on Bards)<br/>\n<br/>\nwell shaman, druids, and paladins all got superior heal.  they start giving<br/>\nout better heal spells and clerics will cry foul.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The most recent &quot;Absor Infobits&quot; on EQVault has him addressing Druid<br/>\n&gt; issues - may give druids (and then I&#39;d assume shamans as<br/>\n&gt; well) stronger<br/>\n&gt; healing..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
