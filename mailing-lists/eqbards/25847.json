I was weak,<br/>\nwomanless, kicked around by any and everyone who happened to see me.  Dogs<br/>\nwould cross streets, to pee against my leg.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I subscribed to EVERQUEST.  It was their ad, in PC Gamer.  It didn&#39;t<br/>\nsay, but it promised health, wealth, sex, strength, technical ability, and<br/>\ntons of other stuff that I really couldn&#39;t understand, but I could feel it<br/>\nassaulting my subconcious awareness.  So I subscribed, and I&#39;ve become a<br/>\npowerful warrior bard (well, up until I was nerfed, anyway, dreaded Verant<br/>\nthe Emasculator), with legions of admiring wood elven nymphs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy technical brain capacity has swelled, because I constantly reflect, as I<br/>\nplay, that I&#39;m seeing over four times the high resolution polygons than I<br/>\never did before.  That everything in EQ almost looks like real life!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince, as a husk of a man, I can&#39;t afford a computer that comes with a sexy,<br/>\nhigh tech name, I had to give mine a name.  So, I scratched out the &quot;Dell&quot;,<br/>\nand named my computer &quot;Firiona Pamela Lee Hawk Arnold Rock<br/>\nDoubledataratememory&quot; (and yes, I have a sign ready for when the REAL Pamela<br/>\ncomes to me, for how could she resist, that reads, &quot;Pamela Lee Firiona<br/>\nHawk...etc).  Hey, it&#39;s hard coming up with a name that reflects all the<br/>\npower, virility, athletic prowess, and technical knowhow that has blossomed<br/>\nsince I started playing EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal *Flex* Steelstring<br/>\nSlayer of Stuff<br/>\nWoo-er of Wood Elven Nymphs<br/>\nHeartbreaker of Half Elven Goddesses<br/>\nMost Favored of Bards<br/>\nCan Twist 3 songs, 8 if you&#39;re Gullible<br/>\nThe Dashingly Handsome Half Elf Bard<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - On a less sarcastic note, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the Mike this article<br/>\nreferrs to.
