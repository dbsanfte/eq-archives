I have a question that some of you might be able to answer.<br/>\nIn a lot of zones there are some really cool &quot;ambient&quot; sounds (animals,<br/>\nwind, etc).  However, in order for me to actually hear them, I have to have<br/>\nmy sound cranked really high - during a combat it&#39;s almost deafening.  Is<br/>\nthere a way to increase the ambient sounds w/o sending my combat sounds<br/>\nthrough the roof??<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 2:05 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Sound effects discovery (off topic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI discovered an aspect of EQ that I was completely unaware of until<br/>\nrecently.  I have been playing since April and during that entire time I had<br/>\nall the sound effect related options set to the max.  There are three sound<br/>\nrelated options: Sound Realism, Music Volume and Sound Volume.  During this<br/>\ntimeframe, the only sound effects that I ever heard were combat/spell<br/>\neffects and background music that you hear when you pass through specific<br/>\nareas, such as near a city or a zone border.  I have recently been<br/>\nadventuring in the aviak village in South Karana.  While you are in this<br/>\nvillage, the background music plays continuously.  This eventually became<br/>\nannoying to me so I went into the sound options screen and moved the sliding<br/>\nbar that controlls music volume down to about 25%.  This had a profound<br/>\nimpact on the sound effects in the game.  Soon, I heard a female monk shriek<br/>\nas she practiced feign death.  I heard aviaks shriek as they entered into<br/>\ncombat.  While running through SK, I heard the rumble of elephants walking<br/>\nas well as their distinct bellow (really cool sounding with a SBLive).  I<br/>\nalso started hearing my own footsteps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that, because I had all of my sound related options set to the max,<br/>\nthe Sound Realism effects were getting cancelled out somehow.  I&#39;m looking<br/>\nforward to going through regions long ago explored to see what special sound<br/>\neffects I have previously missed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be old news for some of you but wanted to post this info n in case<br/>\nother people are like me and were unaware of this option.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, according to the Creative labs website, there is a preset<br/>\nEnvironment Audio setting for EQ for the SBLive soundcard.  I have been<br/>\nunable to locate this setting.  I have been using the default Multi Speaker<br/>\nsetting for my soundcard.  Does anyone know if an Environmental Audio<br/>\nsetting for EQ exists and if so how I can go about downloading it? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
