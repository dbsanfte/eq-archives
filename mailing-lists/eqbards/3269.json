Take one<br/>\nlost soul with a mis-located corpse.  Put into group with a bard (that&#39;s<br/>\nyou), play Lyssa&#39;s & combine!  You have fashioned something entirely new!  A<br/>\nnew fiend.  And if you take up tailoring (I am a broken record - but you<br/>\nkeep axeing and I keep telling) you can make patchwork armor for players.<br/>\nThat is actually a bit more tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost players who want and need the armor are just a bit young to hunt for<br/>\nthe skins needed to make it.  So, you have to get a group together and hunt<br/>\nas a group.  Then there is the failure rate and the sp for the pattern seems<br/>\nso expensive at that level.  But the more you do it the better it gets.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice to you is: do some mail delivery quests. They pay pretty well and<br/>\nthey are something you know how to do - travel from city to city.  To make<br/>\nfiends - axe someone - anyone if they wanna do it with you.  Traveling with<br/>\nanother person is hard - esp at your level - whr all the monsties are gonna<br/>\ngo agro on you.  But it should be really exciting!  And you will get gp for<br/>\nyour travels.  With about 5gp you should be able to get a solid base in<br/>\npatchwork skill and be able to make armor for your new soon to be fiends!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started EQ - it was cuz some of my other game guild bubbies were<br/>\ndoing it.  One guy was in between consulting jobs and played it for a month<br/>\n- needless to say - he got pretty far ahead of us.  Then 2 more started and<br/>\nthey play same time and same amounts as each other so they group all the<br/>\ntime. They got up some.  And then I started with about 6 more of our same<br/>\nbuddies.  One guy has now powergamer&#39;d up to the top guys level - or close<br/>\n(both low 20&#39;s). One guy took a wiz to lev 8 and quit cuz he felt he dint<br/>\nhave the time for the game (ie not enough time to stay at levels with rest<br/>\nof us.) Three of us took chars to low teens and then restarted chars with<br/>\nbetter base or diff class.  Now us three have caught the rest except out 2<br/>\nlow 20 guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nI go in spurts between powergamer and goofing off.  For example, this<br/>\nweekend, my end Nadare - level 14 Enchanter goes: &quot;not sleeping until I get<br/>\nlevel 16!&quot;  Well, ok.  So, we stay up all Friday night and travel everywhere<br/>\nin search of the elusive xp.  She gets 15, I get 14 and its about 10 am Sat<br/>\nmorning.  Things are looking good.  Then she goes: &quot;brb, gotta go out for<br/>\nmore cigs.&quot;  Ok, np.  Ok, 2 hours later and she&#39;s still not back. Hmmm.<br/>\nWell, keep playing until about 5pm Sat then I gots to camp too.  After<br/>\ndinner I was so tired there was no way.  Sleep sleep sleep and up Sun at 8am<br/>\n- back on line.  &quot;/w nadare  all&quot; - where were you? &quot;Fell alseep rebooting<br/>\npc.&quot;  Heheh how many times I have done that.  Esp zoning!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when you play until you are totally fatigued - you find yourself doing<br/>\ndumb stuff.  Like getting lost in cities you normally know like the back of<br/>\nyour hand.  Or all of a sudden you wonder - did they change this zone?<br/>\nMisty thicket never looked like this before, Hmmm. Or you have to do &quot;/w<br/>\nsylly all&quot; just to find out what zone you are in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I know what its like to have fiends and have levels divide you.  And<br/>\nknow how fun ot can be to make new fiends and adventure with them.  So, I&#39;d<br/>\nsay don&#39;t be afraid to axe them to do stuff with you.  Travel from Freeport<br/>\nto Kelethin at your level and with people who have never done it - can be<br/>\nreally thrilling.  But you have to talk to them - talk to everyone and you<br/>\nshould have no trouble making fiends!.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - don&#39;t give up - but do strat talking to people!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly - the bard!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tweya [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a>] <br/>\nSent:\tSunday, July 11, 1999 12:38 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Roleplaying<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: weya &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, I changed servers to play with some people I knew and once<br/>\nagain, the people are moving on.  (btw, not following the same ppl from<br/>\nserver to server but it&#39;s happened twice that ppl have convinced me to a<br/>\ncertain server and then have left).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to find a group (guild?) of ppl that are more concerned with<br/>\ncharacter development (roleplay) than just power levelling.  I don&#39;t<br/>\ncare what server it&#39;s on ... so long as I can find a &quot;home&quot; where the<br/>\npeople are friendly and actually maybe return a &quot;hail&quot; every now and<br/>\nthen.  I&#39;m getting sorta discouraged because I don&#39;t have a predefined<br/>\ngroup of people to hunt with, so I end up solo-ing alot.  And running<br/>\naround Norrath not talking to anyone gets kinda lonely.  Maybe it&#39;s me,<br/>\nI dunno.  But if I don&#39;t find a solution then I may just bag EQ<br/>\naltogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts, ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels,<br/>\nWynsong<br/>\nWoodelf Bard, Level 4<br/>\nRivervale, Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nExpand in consciousness-<br/>\nbe ready to accept anything now,<br/>\nat any time.    --Eileen Caddy<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\nICQ# 1976509<br/>\nAOL IM: weya<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KNICKS@...\">KNICKS@...</a>.
