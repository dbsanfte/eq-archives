Isn&#39;t he supposed to read at LEAST the <br/>\nfirst post in a new thread?  Or does he just notice the word &quot;bard&quot; in the title and blow <br/>\nit off?  I work a full-time job, and I STILL know what most of the major issues are that <br/>\nare bothering other players of ALL types, not just bards.  Two months ago he tells us that <br/>\nChains should not have been nerfed, and now he has no idea what we&#39;re talking about?  He <br/>\nthinks that maybe someone somewhere mentioned in passing that Lullaby is just fine, so that <br/>\nmakes it OK?
