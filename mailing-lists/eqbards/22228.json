Its secondary<br/>\nresist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration. And<br/>\nit will require an instrument.<br/>\nThe single target haste spells will be self-only.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will also be revising the bardic epic weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should all go live with the next patch, which for now we are<br/>\ntentatively scheduling for late next week.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what to think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe removal of the damage shields is sort of OK, it means that the songs<br/>\nwon&#39;t drop now.  These songs aren&#39;t so great though, and it would have<br/>\nbeen nice if something had been added to them.  (A damage shield<br/>\nperhaps).<br/>\n<br/>\nPixie Strike is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of Twilight is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSingle target haste songs will be self only?  Not sure what that means.<br/>\nAs far as I can remember off the top of my head, the only single target<br/>\nsong that isn&#39;t self-only is Jonathan&#39;s Provocation, which I have rarely<br/>\nused, but it was useful to use it on other targets sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>\nhardly useful to use it on myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly good, I guess, if the secondary resist for Pixie Strike is low<br/>\nenough.  Of course, I&#39;m long past using the song.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 54 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
