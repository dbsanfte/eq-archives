But we are not<br/>\ndesigned for soloing like the Ranger or Paladin are.  Frankly, anyone who<br/>\ncomplains about not being able to solo well as a Bard is missing the point<br/>\nto being a Bard.  You want to be alone?  Play a Ranger.  (And yes, I have<br/>\nto yell at myself about this all the time).  Each class has a niche for a<br/>\nreason.  Just as we feel it is silly for a Wizard to complain about not<br/>\nbeing able to wear plate or not being able to do 16 points of damage/hit,<br/>\nit is silly to complain about Bards not being great soloists.<br/>\nSo what does this have to do with the experience penalty?  Well, frankly,<br/>\nif you&#39;re grouping, you should be gaining experience faster.  True, each<br/>\nkill gives you less, but the overall result of being able to kill<br/>\nrepeatedly in shorter periods of time, or handle multiple creatures at a<br/>\ntime balances that out. Bards, as a rule, will do much better in groups.<br/>\nAnd groups, as a rule, will do much better with Bards (*grin*)<br/>\n<br/>\n2nd Point:<br/>\nBardic Magic Weapons:<br/>\nHello (McFly!) - musical instruments ARE our weapons.  I would like to see<br/>\nmore interesting instruments to play (both normal AND magical) than to have<br/>\nmore weapons &quot;just for Bards&quot;.  We are the &quot;Jacks of All Trades&quot; - we<br/>\nshould borrow weapons from other classes (and do.)  While I like the idea<br/>\nof a &quot;Singing Sword&quot;, I think that we should really focus more on our<br/>\nstrengths than our weaknesses at this point.  And I can&#39;t wait to see<br/>\nMusical Instruments being made (*polite cough*)<br/>\n<br/>\n3rd Point:<br/>\nIf they *do* decide to allow Bards to bind ourselves, I think that it<br/>\nshould be 1) higher than 8th circle - like closer to 12th or 15th, and 2)<br/>\nSuck mana like DDD.  Why?  Well, first off, we&#39;re once again treading into<br/>\nthe realm of the spellcaster (something they really hate).  Game balance<br/>\nMUST be preserved.  Wouldn&#39;t be real fair to have you binding yourself just<br/>\neverydarned where, with no penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my final point of the night: (And here&#39;s where I expect to work on my<br/>\ndodge skill:) I think Bards should be denied Plate Mail.  Already I can<br/>\nhear the Battle Bards winding up - but hear me out:  The Bard was never<br/>\nintended to be a grunt-class.  The big burly types should be the ones<br/>\nsoaking the damage and such, not us.  Of course, before they make any<br/>\nchanges like this, they should also fix that tiny little bug that makes us<br/>\nthe primary target ALL the time :(<br/>\n<br/>\nThem&#39;s my bits.  Happy Songs, all. <br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nCheck out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
