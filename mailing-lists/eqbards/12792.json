I<br/>\nreally like all the great information and friendly atmosphere here.  It<br/>\nhelps make it so fun to be a bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I can help corroborate the theory that a flute boosts Charismatic<br/>\nCarillion&#39;s effect (at least slightly).<br/>\n<br/>\nexample:<br/>\nAbout a month ago I spent most of a week helping my roommate&#39;s barbarian<br/>\nwarrior repeat the Langseax quest to get him a Langseax of the Wolves.  I<br/>\nwas 29th level at the time and I&#39;m pretty sure my wind skill was maxed, if<br/>\nthat matters.  My base faction with the Wolves of the North was <br/>\nindifferent.  I Carillion&#39;ed Renth before I gave him my first Basil head<br/>\nand it bumped my faction up to amiable.  Gave him the head and got &quot;Run<br/>\nwhile you can... blah blah&quot;, faction still wasn&#39;t high enough to get the<br/>\nlangseax.  We go do the quest again and this time I Carillion Renth with<br/>\nmy flute.  It still only bumps my faction up to amiable, but this time he<br/>\ngives me a langseax for the head.  On the next repeat of the quest I<br/>\nforgot to use my flute with Carillion and he wouldn&#39;t give me the langseax<br/>\nagain.  We had to do the quest 20 times to get Paglan to spawn, by the<br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, what I&#39;m suggesting is that even though I was still only amiable<br/>\nwith the flute, it was a higher amiable than without the flute such that <br/>\nhe would let me successfully complete the quest only if I used the <br/>\nflute.  Just an observation of mine, your mileage may vary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuladan<br/>\n32nd level flute tooting bard of Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Date: Fri, 7 Jan 2000 15:58:20 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Tooting flutes (was: Re: Char Catillion)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; carrilon also, once I used it on a dubious and didn&#39;t get my flute<br/>\n&gt; &gt; equipped before pulse, and she was only indifferent.  Repulsed with flute,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and she was amiable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I definitely need to test this again, because the flute made no<br/>\n&gt;   difference whatsoever in any faction adjustments when I used it<br/>\n&gt;   in the past.

I could only find apprehensive things.<br/>\n&gt;    I could not locate anything dubious (where I was at).  Both with and<br/>\n&gt;    without the flute, I could get apprehensive to amiable.  I&#39;ll try <br/>\n&gt;    again later when my boss is not expecting some project to be on my <br/>\n&gt;    screen.  I think the merchants near the guard tower in Rathe Mountains<br/>\n&gt;    are dubious to me, I&#39;m right outside Oggok now, so the trip would be <br/>\n&gt;    quick. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    Harm. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
