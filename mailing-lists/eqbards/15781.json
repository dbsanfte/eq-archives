Well in EQ - it<br/>\nequates to &quot;Lag Kills&quot;.  If you are getting bad PL or anything else that<br/>\ncauses bad lag - stay away from Sol A.  I fell in once due to bad lag.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next thing - it&#39;s VERY dangerous to start running through the lava<br/>\ntrying to find your way out.  I had a corpse retrieval from hell once<br/>\nbecause I ran.  There is a &quot;Lavafall&quot; thing (like a waterfall but lava)<br/>\nthat&#39;s one way.  There are only two ways out.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Group with someone with Group Gate.  Levitate your way through the<br/>\nchannel to your corpse.  Loot then gate out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI basically tried this unsuccessfully.  They may have changed it - but at<br/>\nthe time you couldn&#39;t renew Levitate until after it ran out.  My druid<br/>\nfriend ended up dying before we could gate out....<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up doing this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) if you can keep going long enough without dying - you can zone to sol b -<br/>\nwalk through some more lava - and be able to get out. Hopefully you won&#39;t<br/>\nget jumped in Sol B.  Given that Sol B is pretty crowded you&#39;ll probably be<br/>\nsafe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde 36 of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Essam Khairullah&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:olgwinn@...\">olgwinn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 06, 2000 4:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Sol A and preventing lava deaths<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Essam Khairullah&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:olgwinn@...\">olgwinn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The best method that I have learned for lava corpse recoveries is Don&#39;t<br/>\nFall<br/>\n&gt; In!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course it&#39;s not always as easy as all that, so there&#39;s a little trick<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; can do when you fall into lava (at least by the Lavastorm entrance of Sol<br/>\nA,<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t tried it in any of the other lava, but may work).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; /quit<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
