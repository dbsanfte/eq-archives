I know at aleast one did for<br/>\n  sure.  We had to let a lot of warrior Amyg loot rot, along with necro<br/>\n  armor.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Hate to let stuff rot.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Got monk arms, cleric belts, shaman belts, ranger legs, druid legs,<br/>\n  war gloves, fluxblade, etc.  The list goes on, but still the loot <br/>\n  was very weak.  In 48 hours, and many mobs killed, I&#39;d say only <br/>\n  20 things dropped.  5 of which rotted, I&#39;d guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ah well.  I hate Verant, but you didn&#39;t hear that from me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harm.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
