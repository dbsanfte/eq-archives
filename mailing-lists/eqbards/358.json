How does a 6th level accomplish this classic mold. I must admit it<br/>\nis fun when asked, An I tell people I am below 17th level. They ask how did<br/>\nyou get duel wield? Usually I tell them. Except for one that kept pestering<br/>\nme, without offering any help, while I was being attacked by 3 Fire Beatles.<br/>\nAfter finishing my task, with less than 2 drops of blood left in my system,<br/>\nI told him the following OOC.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere is an embedded Easter Egg in the software that the company does not<br/>\nwant people to know about. If you promise not to tell I will tell you. For<br/>\nif it got out they will remove it. so whatever you do keep it to your self!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFirst, you have to go to the Theatre of Tranquility, &#39;Run&#39; to the top and<br/>\njump over the wall three times. Then walk to the dwarf rogue and say,<br/>\n&#39;Co-co-ca-ju Miss, Robbenson.&#39;. And after dunking your head off the peer in<br/>\nSouth Freeport while auctioning, &#39;Yes we have no bananas!&#39; You will get the<br/>\nDual Wield skill at a 31.5 rating.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAfter about an hour, my inquisitive friend returned saying it did not work.<br/>\nI said oh I forgot, when jumping hold the ALT and A, P, R, I, L, then CTL<br/>\nand F, O, O, L and S keys. After a long pause he was off again. I decided to<br/>\ncamp and leave for my new found friend alas did not get the joke. It is<br/>\namazing what some will do for dual wield...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOf course as we all know the dagger is not a weapon, but a parrying dagger<br/>\nonly usable as armor, not a weapon. It looks good, but does nothing but<br/>\nmaybe intimate someone on a PvP server into thinking you are of a higher<br/>\nlevel than you really are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t- SnowLynx, Gentleman Bard [having a bit of fun in] Freeport...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: A.Rubman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 4:56 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings, name&#39;s Luini figure since I don&#39;t know much about the<br/>\n&gt; Soebards I won&#39;t talk about them, instead I have a question. I know that<br/>\n&gt; a Mino Axe is a good 1h-slashing weapon, however I don&#39;t feel it fits in<br/>\n&gt; with my &quot;bardic attitude&quot; if you understand my meaning. Its a massive,<br/>\n&gt; slow, big axe thing from a minotaur, and I&#39;m a bard who likes to travel,<br/>\n&gt; sing his songs and bring mirth. I was using a bronze long sword, now<br/>\n&gt; switched to a plain old Axe (smaller and quicker than a mino), So I ask<br/>\n&gt; you all Whats a good weapon that is not imposing like a mino axe for a<br/>\n&gt; level 8 bard, or even for any level bard.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
