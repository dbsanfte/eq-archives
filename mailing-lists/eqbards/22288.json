THE BRACER IS BROWNISH<br/>\n&gt;RED!!  i freaked out when i saw it, it keeps overwriting my hero bracer<br/>\n&gt;look. I never though i could look worse but oh boy when i put that on did i<br/>\n&gt;ever freak. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While i&#39;m auctioning, some twink bard in full lambent at lev 12 pops up to<br/>\n&gt;me asks me what i wanted for my hero bracer (im auctioning it because i have<br/>\n&gt;a spare)  then after a wee bit says oh nm, i thought you were a twink and<br/>\n&gt;not a real player.  Talk about kicking me while im down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sooo anyways, that kicked me in the butt severely and now im really<br/>\n&gt;determined to powerlevel instead of grouping (which i would much rather do).<br/>\n&gt;I have to kiss my lambent and tree weave goodbye soon and get some imbrued,<br/>\n&gt;im tired of looking like all the twinks with various ss and lambent.  Dont<br/>\n&gt;get me wrong, i have nothing against twinking but man im sick of passing for<br/>\n&gt;something that is 20-30 levels lower then i really am.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Arg sorry for the rant<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Minkin<br/>\n&gt;almost lev 42 bard<br/>\n&gt;The Menace of Rathe Mountains <br/>\n&gt;Sol ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
