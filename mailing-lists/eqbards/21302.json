According to this month&#39;s PC <br/>\n&gt;Gamer, they now have several companies looking at publishing them.  Things <br/>\n&gt;are looking up for David.  I must admit, I owe him an apology - I never <br/>\n&gt;really thought he&#39;d get this far, based on the performance of his <br/>\n&gt;less-than-stellar game &quot;Demise&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interestingly we talked about the demise of Demise at the convention last<br/>\nweekend.  David openly admitted that the screwups on Demise were mostly his<br/>\nfault, partly for trying to do everything himself, and partly from thinking<br/>\nhe knew what made a good game more than the players who were interested in<br/>\nit did (sound like anyone else we know?).  Apparently Demise has been handed<br/>\noff to someone else to repair.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was the biggest lesson David said he learned from Demise, that it was<br/>\nbetter to get good people to do pieces of the game even though they might<br/>\nhave a different opinion of what was good than he did.  They are currently<br/>\nin the process of hiring an economist to finalize the details of the money<br/>\nsystem for Horizons because they do not fell that any of the dev team knows<br/>\nenough about how economics work in different scales to get it right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;d certainly appreciate your wisdom on the game if you get involved<br/>\nwith it in the future Talies, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone.  I don&#39;t always<br/>\nagree with you, but you do always prompt me to think about stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
