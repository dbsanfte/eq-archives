I had Selo&#39;s running<br/>\nat the time.  When I switched off Selo&#39;s I found that I ran at normal (i.e.<br/>\nnon-Sow non-Selo) speed until I zoned.  Evidently it works like Selo&#39;s used<br/>\nto when someone had SOW on them before the patch...<br/>\n<br/>\n    I almost quit grouping with the Druid at that point - but she turned out<br/>\nto be okay - and didn&#39;t do it again.  In retrospect - I think she DIDN&#39;T<br/>\nknow about it - but made a poor attempt at humor after she cast it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It seems that the majority of people don&#39;t know about the change.  Both<br/>\nSOW casters routinely casting it on everyone who can&#39;t ask; and everyone<br/>\nelse freaking when you play Selo&#39;s when they have it cast on them.<br/>\nSimilarly - a great number of people still ask me to play the Jig to speed<br/>\ntheir mana regeneration...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 22, 1999 9:42 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] News Flash On SoW<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last knight - shaperson fiend says hi - I say hi - I go to run off and<br/>\nwtf?<br/>\n&gt; he sow&#39;d me &lt;grrr&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; right click -- &lt;grrrr&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; find druid with cancel magic &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; u can NOT right click it off u if u r not the caster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
