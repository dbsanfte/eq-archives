Factor in cast times, and song duration after it ends,<br/>\n&gt;and when twisting 4 songs, almost always, the first effect will drop before<br/>\n&gt;you get back to it.  You can add amplification to a 4 song twist, and call<br/>\n&gt;it 5, but when it comes time to refresh amplification, you&#39;ll probably lose<br/>\n&gt;an effect just as you&#39;re trying to twist it back in, resulting in a catch up<br/>\n&gt;effect where a song wears off a pulse or two before it can be refreshed, all<br/>\n&gt;the way through the twist, so you&#39;ve only got 3 songs active anyway, not<br/>\n&gt;counting amplification.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure if anyone ever actually defined &quot;twisting&quot;.  To me, it is the<br/>\n&gt;ability to keep the effects of multiple songs **active** on my group, or on<br/>\n&gt;the mob, at ALL times.  A 3 song twist is common among high level bards (am<br/>\n&gt;I a high level bard now?  :P ).  Why?  Because we&#39;ve been playing the class<br/>\n&gt;long enough to realize that, under most circumstances, it is the best twist.<br/>\n&gt;Some song lineups, and situations make a 4 song twist desired, and while<br/>\n&gt;possible, it&#39;s a lot harder, and is only practical when the occassional<br/>\n&gt;dropped effect isn&#39;t that big a deal.  Like manasong, which is a shot of<br/>\n&gt;mana when pulsed, and not a regen effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But when you&#39;re talking a song effect dropping for a duration of time, which<br/>\n&gt;is what would happen in a 5 song twist...well, it&#39;s not really a twist.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you insist it is, then I&#39;d like to be the first to introduce myself as<br/>\n&gt;the best bard in EQ, because I can twist 8.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/bow<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Atonal<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: KAZ [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kazvorpal@...\">kazvorpal@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 14, 2002 8:17 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] twisting 5, added note<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- Michael Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MikeRoach@...\">MikeRoach@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A great bard does not need to twist 5 songs.
