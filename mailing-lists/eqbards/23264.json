The health regen is quite<br/>\nimpressive when I am singing the lvl 55 cantana with the 7 string lute in<br/>\nhand during downtime, especially if another group regen spell is active on<br/>\nthe party.  Why should a cleric burn mana on a party member that will regen<br/>\nup over the same time it takes the cleric to regain his mana to a &quot;Ready&quot;<br/>\nlevel?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just another way of reducing downtime that we have discovered, but<br/>\none which less experienced clerics and groups do not recognize.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
