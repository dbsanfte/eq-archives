I would enchanter would be one of<br/>\nthe worst to try to multi play.  When I stopped pl;aying EQ to perform in a<br/>\nplay, my regular Thursday night group, did not want to tbreak up.  So my<br/>\nroomate, paid my $10 a month and played both his warrior and my cleric.  He<br/>\nsaid it was no problem at all.  Granted he lost my cleric crowd control<br/>\n(parking.and atoning), and we were no where near effective at killing<br/>\ncasters (when we were both playing in the same room we would pretty much<br/>\nnever see a enemy spell go off, between his bash and my stuns).<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see playing a monk as a puller (in a multi group raid) and a nother<br/>\nclass (since essentially the monk could just stay feigned the whole time<br/>\nwithout losing much).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever this stems from a specific question about loot rights and I would<br/>\nsay the multi played enchanter should not have gotten the robe.  Primaries<br/>\nshould always come before secondaries.  In my former guild, I got way ahead<br/>\nof a lot of my guild mates in level, and started playing my cleric secondary<br/>\nwith them at times.  I would always defer loot to them, even though I was<br/>\nplaying my cleric (and only my cleric) at the time the loot dropped.  Its<br/>\nsimply common sense.  The guild was best served by the the primary getting<br/>\nthe item.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
