He&#39;s specialized in archery & axe.  I find myself using the axe<br/>\nFAR more often in dungeons and the bow more often on the surface.  Archers<br/>\nare supposed to be powerful in open areas where they can peg you from 300<br/>\nyards.  Underground the tanks rule.<br/>\n------<br/>\n<br/>\nI played AC for 4 mos.  In that time, I got a Sho melee sword fighter with <br/>\ncreature and item 4 to level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I liked about AC:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Totally customizable characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n-The GM staff and Turbine are not paranoid.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Camping is almost not an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n-You can get experience off of anything you kill, albeit less the higher you <br/>\ngo if the critter is low level.<br/>\n<br/>\n-The death penalty doesnt hurt as much as EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n-The ability to solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I didn&#39;t like about AC:<br/>\n<br/>\n-The interface<br/>\n<br/>\n-The chat system<br/>\n<br/>\n-The posing for combat (got my mage killed plenty).<br/>\n<br/>\n-The graphics<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, the game is becoming more crowded.  The higher in level you go, <br/>\nthe more difficult it becomes to find places to hunt that will give you <br/>\ndecent experience. (sound familiar?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMages and archers are very powerful.  I&#39;ve had an archer 5 levels below me <br/>\nout kill me in dungeons using the quarrel bug, which has been in existence <br/>\nsince beta.  They can&#39;t take the hits that a melee fighter can, so they will <br/>\nstand back and let you tank while they suck up the experience.  Since <br/>\neveryone who touches a monster gets experience from it, there is no &quot;kill <br/>\nstealing&quot; per se.  Your only recourse is to leave him to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I decided to leave AC and return to EQ, my patriarch, our monarch <br/>\n(level 40 archer), and some other vassels in the allegiance all came with <br/>\nme.  So far, they like it better than AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t to say I totally hate AC, or that I don&#39;t see the problems EQ <br/>\nhas, just, for me, EQ has more depth to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too, would like to see a nice hybrid of the best of the MORPG&#39;s I&#39;ve <br/>\nplayed. Done right, it could be an awesome game.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
