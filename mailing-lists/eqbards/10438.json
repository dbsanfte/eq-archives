(My boss<br/>\nis a wizard)  I thought to myself wouldn&#39;t that be great, to be able to<br/>\nresearch new songs.  Well, then I thought to myself, that isnt really<br/>\npractical because no one would &quot;research&quot; a song.  But then I thought<br/>\nwouldnt it be even better if we bards could do our own form of research in<br/>\nsongwriting.  Of course we couldnt just write a song a then be done.  What<br/>\nif we could do musical research and put components together to make new<br/>\nsongs.  After all, wouldn&#39;t real bards write their own songs?  What do you<br/>\nthink?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
