If a mob is aggressive to you, you take a<br/>\nslight faction hit for any non-attacking player it kills while<br/>\nyou were the last target (dead people are not included, you<br/>\nare still responsible for a short time after you zone).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really see purposeful training as a problem (I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I&#39;ve ever seen this).  What I do consider a problem are<br/>\npeople running/zoning from unintentional trains.  A lot of<br/>\ntimes, the total experience lost due to deaths from this<br/>\nexceeds the total experience the running player(s) would have<br/>\nlost if they&#39;d just sucked it up and gone down fighting<br/>\ninstead of trying to zone (I&#39;m guilty of this too).<br/>\n<br/>\nA slight faction hit for deaths due to trains that are of your<br/>\ncreation would make people rethink their retreats so as to<br/>\nminimize the number of people killed when the do zone.  With<br/>\nwide zones like Oasis, I try to ditch trains in unpopulated<br/>\nareas (NEVER the beach).  I&#39;d like to see more people acting<br/>\nthis considerate with their trains.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
