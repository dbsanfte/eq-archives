The message on screen that popped up numerous times during the fight<br/>\nwas the &quot;scintillating colors&quot; message.  I&#39;ve always assumed this was the<br/>\nmessage enchanters get when they successfully stun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood idea though on the tashan possibility.  I didn&#39;t think of that but its<br/>\nthe most likely reason my songs stuck better.  Another good reason why bards<br/>\nand enchanters group well together.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hmmm an enchanter joined you ? Enchanters usually start fights with the<br/>\n&gt; tashan debuff spell, that dramatically reduce opponents magic resistance.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe it does explain the difference.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;     I was in the assasin room in LGUK last night.  The ghoul knights we<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt;     fighting usually either conned blue to me or red.  We had a druid in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;     group ensnaring so I weaved Largos Binding during combat.  My CHR was<br/>\n&gt; 130 at<br/>\n&gt;     the time and whenever we went up against a red ghoul, they resisted<br/>\n&gt; Largos<br/>\n&gt;     frequently.  Later on an enchanter joined the group and buffed my CHR<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;     158.  From that point I was able to get Largos to stick on almost<br/>\n&gt; every red<br/>\n&gt;     ghoul we fought.  I didn&#39;t parse a log file so its all subjective, but<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt;     seemed that higher CHR made this song more effective.  I was under<br/>\n&gt;     impression higher CHR only increased our chance of success with mind<br/>\n&gt; control<br/>\n&gt;     related songs like songs like Lullaby, Charm, Pixie and Fear.  Does<br/>\n&gt; anyone<br/>\n&gt;     know if higher CHR also effects Largos?  Its quite possible that the<br/>\n&gt; random<br/>\n&gt;     number generator was skewed in my favor and thats why I was having<br/>\n&gt; better<br/>\n&gt;     success with the high CHR.<br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
