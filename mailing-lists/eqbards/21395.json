They seem to think<br/>\nthat not requiring mana makes the bard class completely powerful.  It is<br/>\nclear that no one at Verant &quot;Plays&quot; a bard character using the retail<br/>\nclient.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve played a necro now to level 6 and I can see how they can come to this<br/>\nconclusion.  When you are out of mana you are somewhat vulnerable in a way<br/>\nthat a bard isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think to truly understand the way the game works you have to play it.  You<br/>\nhave to really understand the limitations.  We have no items that let us<br/>\ntwist more songs - while casters get INT/WIS and mana boosting items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no spells that let us twist more (i.e. clarity/manasong).<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have been posting excellent analysis of this on the Verant boards -<br/>\ntalking about opportunity costs - and mana management (i.e. how many mobs<br/>\ncan an Enchanter keep mezzed indefinitely with clarity on and meditating<br/>\nthrough it).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Verant just &#39;doesn&#39;t get it&#39;.  If they played a Bard they would.  It&#39;s<br/>\nobvious they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; I think INDIRECTLY there is some truth to it.<br/>\nI suspect that when it comes to design, balancing, etc meetings and<br/>\ndiscussions at the meetings - the people there who sincerely do play and<br/>\nenjoy Everquest as a player - subconsciously at best (and perhaps even<br/>\nconsciously) champion their favorite class.  People accuse Abashi of having<br/>\nNecro-favoritism.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t help but believe that there is truth to some degree (again even if<br/>\nsubconscious) and there is no Bard-player/champion on the design team.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Big Daddy Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 13, 2000 8:44 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Crowd Control<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you guys honestly think there is some kind of Verant plan to screw over<br/>\nbards?<br/>\n<br/>\nCome back to reality.  Verant is a poorly run company.  Their in house<br/>\ntesting is abysmal (if it exists at all, which I have serious doubts of).<br/>\nTheir customer service is embarassing, and their arrogance is the stuff of<br/>\nkings.  They just wrote a really good game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, they treat everyone like that.  Perhaps theres a few more<br/>\nbard problems since we are the most unusual class in the game.  (This goes<br/>\nback to their lack of testing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did you expect things to change this time?<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil a viable competitor arrives, this attitude won&#39;t hurt them.  If<br/>\nAnarchy Online (which I doubt will be, as its a sci fi setting, which has<br/>\nalways been a smaller market than fantasy.) is this viable competitor then<br/>\nsoon we will see them reaping what they have sown.  If not we will have to<br/>\nwait for horizons/shadowbane/whatever.  (All of which are a long way away).<br/>\n<br/>\nRecent posts from Brad indicate to me, they believe the game has reached its<br/>\npeak and are preparing for the inevitable shrinking of the population.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
