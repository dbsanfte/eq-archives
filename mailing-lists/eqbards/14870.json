I can own an SG while all the HG i have tried have gotten me down to one bubble, one time a little less hehe. <br/>\n  Greycloud BloodTalon&quot; (level 50 warrior)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;2081 HPs and 840 AC(self buffs only), Sprinkler and Sash, I solo them without LoH, but it takes all my mana on healing and they usually get me down below half after that. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Vaul TrueHeart <br/>\n  Holy Knight of Marr&quot; (level 50 paladin)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I killed HGs in west commons with 1586hp (self buffs only), not an arrow shot.  Jetal was there to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tanthalar Silverleaf &quot; (level 50 ranger, full thorny vine, mistwalker, spined dragon claw, RBB)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Ive tried yesterday with Tsul. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Was a blue HG (Im 47), I had no buffs. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Got him down to 1/4 or so before I got under a bubble and used FD. <br/>\n<br/>\n  It could be done if I was 50 and had better equip (fear gear and better haste) I think. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Im pretty sure Denz could.&quot; (Denzalo is a 50 monk with full shiverback, and tons of god/dragon items)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  like i said, its all about equipment with melee classes, whether it be planes and dragon armor (thorny vine, valorium, rbb, etc), planes and dragon weapons (monsoon, sdc, mw, etc).  now i am at home Scully, so i won&#39;t see any replies til i get to work tomorrow, but i expect a full report on my desk that you have accepted the truth!<br/>\n<br/>\n  your partner,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mulder<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
