The only way in is down a &quot;lavafall&quot; which<br/>\n&gt;is high enough that you can&#39;t go back up.  The only way out is<br/>\n&gt;by gating or zoning to Sol B.  Once you get in there with<br/>\n&gt;levitate, there is no reachable land so you cannot drag your<br/>\n&gt;corpse up to the surface.  Since your corpse is in the lava,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;snip<br/>\n&gt;for you.  If you are a bard/necro, then you have a way to loot<br/>\n&gt;your corpse so the GMs don&#39;t have to help you, which is what<br/>\n&gt;the original poster was griping about. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
