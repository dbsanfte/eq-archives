I saw the damage figures and the potential double<br/>\n&gt; resist and thought my lvl 30 song might turn out to be as unexciting as<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; level 29 one I just got.  It still seems peculiar that our level 2 song<br/>\n&gt; outdamages it though.  At what level will my songs start moving up the<br/>\n&gt; scale?  I noticed last night something that has been bugging me a bit for<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; couple of weeks.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here I am 29th level and except for special situations I still pretty much<br/>\n&gt; use mostly the same songs I did at 10th.  I&#39;m using Anthem (or Chant of<br/>\n&gt; Battle depending on enchanter), Jig, Hymn, Accelerando, and Chords.  Of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; other 3 slots only Largo&#39;s and Psalm of Warmth see extensive usage.  Charm<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; keep for mega taunting off our casters.  So basically 5 of my 8 spell<br/>\n&gt; slots<br/>\n&gt; are still 10th level or below.  I tried using Denon&#39;s instead of Chords<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; a while, but the double resists on Denon&#39;s definitely lower its<br/>\n&gt; performance<br/>\n&gt; significantly.  I found it to be resisted by whites and up 14.7% more than<br/>\n&gt; Chords.  That lowered its damage potential to below Chords.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even in all instrument I&#39;ve found that in my combo of Largo&#39;s, Chords,<br/>\n&gt; Hymn,<br/>\n&gt; and Denon&#39;s, its Chords and Hymn that have the most effect.  Denon&#39;s gets<br/>\n&gt; resisted too often, and Largo&#39;s isn&#39;t far behind.  These experiences leave<br/>\n&gt; me wondering how songs with 3 or 4 effects will ever stick.  What sort of<br/>\n&gt; resists are you higher levels seeing?  Maybe I&#39;ve just had a bad run of<br/>\n&gt; randoms lately but from what I&#39;ve seen, songs with more than one effect<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; get resisted way too much.  A grouping class ends up fighting mostly stuff<br/>\n&gt; that cons above them which just magnifies the problem at least in my<br/>\n&gt; experience the last month or two.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 23, 2000 6:31 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Song Damage<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found FCC to be pretty reliable against yellow and below mobs.  The<br/>\n&gt; double<br/>\n&gt; resist rate problems you have with Lullaby don&#39;t appear to work the same<br/>\n&gt; way<br/>\n&gt; with this song.  In fact, I&#39;m inclined to believe the mob only gets one<br/>\n&gt; chance<br/>\n&gt; to resist.
