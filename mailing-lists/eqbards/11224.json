You can actually stand there admiring the<br/>\nbok&#39;s and frog king (although I&#39;d recommend being careful, in case it<br/>\nblinked ;)). If I&#39;m not mistaken (and I could be), our invis used to<br/>\nwork against Undead in Lower Guk Undead side, and was changed in a patch<br/>\na few months ago.
