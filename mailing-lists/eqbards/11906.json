The original warrior armor<br/>\n&gt; from PoF was mislabeled so that a variety of classes<br/>\n&gt; (including bards) could use it.  Being warrior armor, the<br/>\n&gt; stats were way better than anything available to those<br/>\n&gt; classes.  They fixed it so only warriors could equip it, there<br/>\n&gt; was a huge outcry, they changed it back, and created some new<br/>\n&gt; warrior armor. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
