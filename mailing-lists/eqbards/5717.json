The<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; increased duration makes up for the lost ticks of damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; during the pull.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s incorrect if we&#39;re all reading it correctly. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not being based on whether YOU the player are moving. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; being based on whether the mob is moving. So the argument<br/>\n&gt;&gt; above stands. If you pull with a DOT spell and the mob<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is running towards you - the DOT isn&#39;t doing any damage.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; And again, long term damage is not as preferred to me as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; damage done up front. I&#39;d prefer to have a lot of damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt; in the beginning and end the fight faster rather than<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the DOT lasting longer.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;are you being intentionally dense?  If you stop, the mob<br/>\n&gt;catches you and *TA-DA* STOPS!  So he starts taking<br/>\n&gt;damage again.  How hard is this?  If you&#39;re going to end<br/>\n&gt;up running for that long, and be that far away from the<br/>\n&gt;mob when you reach your group/fight spot, don&#39;t pull with<br/>\n&gt;a dot, pull with DD.  For short pulls you lose a couple<br/>\n&gt;of ticks of damage if you continue to pull with it.  I have<br/>\n&gt;a shaman, I usually pull with my dot, run to my fighting<br/>\n&gt;spot (somewhere out of the usual mob paths) turn and<br/>\n&gt;and get another cast in to slow the monster.  The only<br/>\n&gt;adjustment I have to make is how I pull, now I just have<br/>\n&gt;to slow it (drowsy for another level, then walking sleep)<br/>\n&gt;then, when I reach my fighting spot, dot it.  The net effect<br/>\n&gt;is the same, as drowsy last longer than the poison dot line.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for this &quot;I&#39;d prefer to have a lot of damage<br/>\n&gt; in the beginning and end the fight faster rather than<br/>\n&gt; the DOT lasting longer.&quot;, then don&#39;t use dot&#39;s, use<br/>\n&gt;DD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I actually like the dot lasting until the end of the fight,<br/>\n&gt;during a string of misses with a long delay 2hb weapon,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s nice that the mob&#39;s health is still dropping.  For me,<br/>\n&gt;the way I fight, the changes will result in an improvement<br/>\n&gt;in performance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This all regards solo play, in a group the dynamics<br/>\n&gt;are different, and I think I won&#39;t even notice.  (In<br/>\n&gt;a decent group, even a poison dot doesn&#39;t always<br/>\n&gt;reach the end before the mob drops)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
