If you climb to the top and leap, you<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; just reach the wall.  By running and leaping, you can get around to most<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the city walls and rooftops.  The graphics there are unfinished, and I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; a nice overhead shot of me standing on the wall watching the moon rise<br/>\n&gt; BENEATH me - a bit vertiginous, that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK, ok, I climb a lot, just to see what&#39;s up there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know whether this is possible for you non-woodelves or not.  My<br/>\n&gt; friend Bayrn, a high-elf cleric, tried over and over but couldn&#39;t climb to<br/>\n&gt; the top of the tree.  I wonder whether we woodelves actually are better at<br/>\n&gt; climbing trees? = )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aloro (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Teaser112\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/Teaser112</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
