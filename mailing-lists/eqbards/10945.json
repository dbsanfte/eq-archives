The one<br/>\n&gt;time monks get nerfed they get a two-page apology in the patch news the next<br/>\n&gt;day, we get nerfed nearly weekly and get squat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would urge every single bard, regardless of level to /bug the new Levitate<br/>\n&gt;results and /Feedback them as well every single time you log on to play.<br/>\n&gt;Maybe several hundred /bugs and /feedbacks will get their F&%@in&#39; attention.<br/>\n&gt;If not we should plan a Bard sit in like the monks had and see if a 50&#39;<br/>\n&gt;gnome shows up for that.  If he doesn&#39;t its just one more thing we can throw<br/>\n&gt;in their faces to prove that no one at Verant gives a Flotsam&#39;s A$$ about<br/>\n&gt;bards and we are sick of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wasn&#39;t going to play tonite much do to having a hockey game, but I&#39;ll make<br/>\n&gt;sure to get on just to /bug the new levitate issue.

Because it&#39;s a nerf, that&#39;s why =)  This does not<br/>\n&gt;  impact casters whatsoever, it&#39;s aimed at bard&#39;s who can levitate<br/>\n&gt;  continously higher and higher.
