This<br/>\nsi my latest one that I thought I would share with the group.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>\nif you use it. I think part of a Bard&#39;s job is to spread the works of others<br/>\nas well as create works of their own.  I do that myself, and I try to give<br/>\ncredit to the original poet if I know who it is.  Anyway, here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the deep, dark wood<br/>\nOf eerie Kithicor<br/>\nSee the bixies flit about<br/>\nHear the horrible kodiak roar<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the deep, dark wood<br/>\nOf eerie Kithicor<br/>\nThe halflings play in their cool glen<br/>\nNot far from Highhold Pass´┐¢s door<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the deep, dark wood<br/>\nOf eerie Kithicor<br/>\nSettlers proud and noble died<br/>\nDefending us from zombie hordes<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the deep, dark wood<br/>\nOf eerie Kithicor<br/>\nAbandoned, burned and haunted homes<br/>\nRemnants of the things they wore<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the deep, dark wood<br/>\nOf eerie Kithicor<br/>\nAn undead ghoul took my friend´┐¢s life<br/>\nNow it´┐¢s time to settle the score<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the deep, dark wood<br/>\nOf eerie Kithicor</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
