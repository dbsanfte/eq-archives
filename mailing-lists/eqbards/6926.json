All <br/>\n&gt; results assume a 50th level player, with 200 in all his combat skills, and <br/>\n&gt; 100 STR. The 5 dam/20 delay  weapon will outperform a 10dam/40 delay weapon <br/>\n&gt; by about 27 percent in a two minute time period, in the primary.  If you <br/>\n&gt; have double attack, it goes up to 44 percent, thanks to double the amount of <br/>\n&gt; DA activation checks. It will outperform by 39 percent if used in the <br/>\n&gt; secondary, mainly thanks to twice as many DW activation checks. If your <br/>\n&gt; class is capable of &#39;quad&#39; attacks (see above),  it goes up to a staggering <br/>\n&gt; 73 percent overall spread between the faster and the slower weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There seems to be some misunderstanding about why JM and I<br/>\ndisagreed on this.  He assumed the same efficiency rating<br/>\n(divide damage by delay), I assumed the same damage over time<br/>\n(hit for X minutes, add up damage, divide damage by time).<br/>\nWhat he says above is true if the damage/delay ratings for the<br/>\nweapons are the same, but the damage-over-time of the weapons<br/>\nare different (to favor the faster weapon, whish seems to be<br/>\nthe case in this game).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the damage-over-time of the weapons are the same, then it<br/>\nis impossible for dual wield or double attack to make a<br/>\ndifference unless the damage equations are time-dependent<br/>\n(i.e. your chance of doing X damage on a hit is different 30<br/>\nseconds into the fight than 2 minutes into the fight).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; polarized.  But you can still expect a marked advantage over the faster <br/>\n&gt; weapon.  Enough of an advantage to even sacrifice some small amount of <br/>\n&gt; efficiency in favor of speed.  A well balanced scimitar, (5 dam/21 delay, <br/>\n&gt; ..238 eff rating), outdoes a barbed leather whip,( 7 dam/28 delay, .25 eff <br/>\n&gt; rating), by 14 percent in a two minute period used as the primary, and 19 <br/>\n&gt; percent as the secondary. At 50th level, in pure melee combat, two minutes <br/>\n&gt; is pretty close to how long a typical fight lasts.  Drop the time period <br/>\n&gt; down to one minute, the gap narrows, but is still evident.  Drop it down to <br/>\n&gt; 30 seconds, it&#39;s a dead heat, still.  Anything less than 30 seconds tends to <br/>\n&gt; favor the whip.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This happens due to &quot;strobing,&quot; a bias that occurs in discrete<br/>\nsampling.  An extreme example would be a 100 damage 200 delay<br/>\nweapon vs. a 10 damage 10 delay weapon.  Even though the 2nd<br/>\nweapon is twice as efficient, if the fight lasts 1 second,<br/>\nboth weapons will get in one swing, and the first weapon will<br/>\ndo 10x better.  It is not the type of time-dependeny I mention<br/>\nabove.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   If you factor in the highly variable factors of target defense and AC, <br/>\n&gt; first you go nuts, then you come up with results even more in favor of the <br/>\n&gt; faster weapon, as you get more chances to hit as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>\nonly lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>\nlikely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>\nthing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>\ndeviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>\nyou&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>\nas more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
