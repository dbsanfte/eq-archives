While its true that it<br/>\nsometimes won&#39;t change my prices due to my already high charisma, it has<br/>\nother benefits.  The greatest benefit of Carillion is in the area of quests.<br/>\nI have found that not only am I able to get more quests because of<br/>\nCarillion, but the rewards for doing the quests are better as well.  I have<br/>\nfound that I consistently get greatly increased rewards when I use Carillion<br/>\nbefore I turn in items for quests.  While the chance still exists to get a<br/>\nlesser reward due to the vagaries of the random number generator, over the<br/>\nlong haul it has proved invaluable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I completed the squad ring quest I noticed that Hendi Mrubble would not<br/>\nrecharge my ring, and the marshal would not give me a new one.  One blast of<br/>\nCarillion and the Marshal obliged my request for a new ring, another blast<br/>\nand Hendi was equally cooperative.  I have also consistently gotten a reward<br/>\nfor 2 jumjum stalks from Uner, while most folks have to turn in 4 to get a<br/>\nreward.  So far I have only found 2 quests I could not do, and those folks<br/>\nwere apprehensive to me before carillion.  In both cases I merely did 2 of<br/>\ntheir lower faction quests and that coupled with Carillion were enough to<br/>\nput me over the hump to get the quests.  Of course I haven&#39;t tried any evil<br/>\nquests, but then why would I want to?<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi the quester</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
