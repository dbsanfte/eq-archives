I pretty much ran around<br/>\nhim bellowing and hitting him in the back. We were<br/>\nabout even and 2 bubbles down when I accidentally<br/>\nerased bellow from my memory!  (I right mouse click<br/>\nand turn mouse to rotate faster--and accidentally<br/>\nright mouse clicked on the bellow song).  At that<br/>\npoint I was pretty much screwed.  Anyway, my point is<br/>\nthat it is possible to beat a ranger at that level. I<br/>\nwas 21 i think and he was 23 or 24.  If I was his<br/>\nlevel I think I would have kicked his butt all over<br/>\nthe planet. At a higher level I&#39;m sure this would be<br/>\nmuch more difficult--maybe impossible.  I have heard<br/>\nof bards slaughtering rangers doing instrument attack<br/>\nwith DDD/COD/HOR.<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 11<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1999 12:00:07 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Re:  Bards vs. casters, melee, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes but all those examples were with each class<br/>\n&gt; using all its abilities.  I<br/>\n&gt; was trying to point out that separating them out was<br/>\n&gt; meaningless which those<br/>\n&gt; examples would bear out.  How the 25th bard beat the<br/>\n&gt; ranger I can&#39;t fathom.<br/>\n&gt; I dueled a 15th level ranger when I was 15th and<br/>\n&gt; despite having 40 points of<br/>\n&gt; ac over him he smoked me and stayed above 2 bubbles.<br/>\n&gt;  If I ran around and<br/>\n&gt; tried to heal he shot me with his bow, and in melee<br/>\n&gt; it was a near even trade<br/>\n&gt; of blows.  It should be even worse at 24th with<br/>\n&gt; rangers getting Parry at<br/>\n&gt; 18th and double attack at 20th, ick!  When I hit<br/>\n&gt; 20th I will try again on a<br/>\n&gt; 20th ranger, but seriously doubt I will win a real<br/>\n&gt; duel with him.  What I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to try is a group of three bards vs three of<br/>\n&gt; any other class at the<br/>\n&gt; same levels.  I think we would nearly win all those<br/>\n&gt; duels, but unless on the<br/>\n&gt; PvP servers will never find out unless I can get<br/>\n&gt; some friends into the<br/>\n&gt; Arena.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
