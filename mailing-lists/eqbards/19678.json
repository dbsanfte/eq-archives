And","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-80086589\">Gate would be a nice effect to drop off a level 20 mob.  It does drop off<br/>\nlevel 35ish mobs (the cenobite? in CT? And PoF mobs too drop a wand with a<br/>\ngate.) And they need to make Shaman potions reasonable - to make and to buy.<br/>\nBut its a low level spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt high levels, folks do not use gate as a &quot;get out of jail free card.&quot;  Not<br/>\nif they ever want to get invited to plane/dragon/dungeon again.  The stuff<br/>\nyou do is group oriented.  Druids and Wizards transport folks - before and<br/>\nafter.  You wont be hurting for transport if you are playing with guild<br/>\ngroups.  And a gate to your bind point is merely a very occasional<br/>\nconvenience.  Gate without bind - is ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething good would be a heal or buff.  A real heal or a good buff even if<br/>\nit used reagents.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I&#39;d take summon bandages over gate<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s.
