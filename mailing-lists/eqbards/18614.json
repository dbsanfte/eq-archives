They may have<br/>\nguild members that they draw off, but there are many<br/>\nraids that are &quot;thrown together&quot; in less than a week<br/>\nwith people not of the same guild.  Tunare has a<br/>\npretty active board on the EZBoard newsgroups.  One of<br/>\nthe categories is &quot;Dragons and Planes&quot;.  Someone who<br/>\nwants to organize a  raid and get others can just post<br/>\nout there the time and day of the event and get people<br/>\nto sign up.  Sure there may be some no shows or<br/>\nwhatever, but I think it works fairly well.  It does<br/>\nprobably take a number of experienced raid members to<br/>\npull it off (especially the organizer) but it<br/>\ncertainly can be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n40th level bard, Black Tower<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, certainly it&#39;s possible to organize and pull off<br/>\n&gt; a non-guild <br/>\n&gt; event like this, there are many obstacles in place<br/>\n&gt; making it <br/>\n&gt; extremelly difficult.  I wonder if any dragon or<br/>\n&gt; plane has been <br/>\n&gt; successfully done without a guild of some kind<br/>\n&gt; organizing it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
