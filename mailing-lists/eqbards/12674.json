I respect you all<br/>\n  as players a lot.  The time and effort you spending into the<br/>\n  mechanics of the game intrigues me.  I am a quantitative person, <br/>\n  and I like to figure out how things work.  I&#39;ve asked to come<br/>\n  on raids before, never even got a response from your GM.  I would<br/>\n  love to help you all out by learning some things, but there&#39;s no<br/>\n  way for me to get Selo&#39;s Drum or McVax&#39;s Horn if I don&#39;t first<br/>\n  go to a dragon raid.  Conversely, not responding to me, and ignoring<br/>\n  me also leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m just a bard looking for a piece of the action.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harm.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
