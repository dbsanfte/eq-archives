Yay!  This is a very nice addition.<br/>\nThe same message<br/>\nfor fear seem to work most of the time, but there<br/>\nwere also MANY<br/>\ntimes when I got the message, &quot;Hill Giant flees in<br/>\nterror.&quot;  And the<br/>\ngiant stood there and whacked on me...no message<br/>\nabout the giant<br/>\nbreaking fear, or anything.  Interestingly, this<br/>\nseemed to happen<br/>\na LOT after the giant had been charmed, like it<br/>\nwas so pissed at<br/>\nme it was unafraid (despite the message to the<br/>\ncontrary).  In any<br/>\ncase, I /petitioned it and they said they filed it<br/>\nas a bug.  So if<br/>\nyou see this happening, be sure to /petition it (I<br/>\nthink /bug is useless).<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer, Level 33 bard of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSteven S.
