The problem<br/>\nis if you get in over your head above ground, you can always<br/>\nrun away.  If that happens underground, you&#39;d better hope your<br/>\ngroup has good healers because you are going to take a beating<br/>\nuntil you kill everything or you zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used it in Crushbone today to pull a legionnaire train off<br/>\nof another player (I&#39;m at the point where I can solo these<br/>\neasily and they are all green or blue to me).  Someone else<br/>\ntook one, and I was left with two.  I kept the lullaby going<br/>\nto keep one asleep while I dispatched the other.  We both<br/>\nfinished about the same time, and I was more interested in<br/>\nhealing than experience so I let the other guy kill the final<br/>\nlegionnaire.  I never touched that legionnaire, but it was so<br/>\nmad at me for putting it to sleep for so long that it *never*<br/>\nattacked the guy who was hacking at it.  It kept attacking me<br/>\nright up until it died, even though the only thing I was doing<br/>\nwas playing my healing song (solo no less).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
