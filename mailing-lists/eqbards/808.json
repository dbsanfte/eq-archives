In general,<br/>\nthings either give good loot or good experience.  If it gives<br/>\nboth, it&#39;s probably camped.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do hunt in Steamfont, I&#39;d also recommend trying the<br/>\ninitial passage in the minotaur caves (before it splits into<br/>\nthree).  A minotaur often spawns just inside, and if you get a<br/>\ntrain (2+ minotaurs, though I was able to take two solo at<br/>\nL14), you can always kick in the afterburners and run for the<br/>\nguard near the windmills.  Minotaurs tend to have a little<br/>\nbetter loot, and about one in ten has an axe that sells for<br/>\n3pp (vendor) to 5pp (players).<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to draw them out of the cave (so more wouldn&#39;t drop on<br/>\ntop of me), and fought near the mountains (so other monsters<br/>\noutside wouldn&#39;t jump me).  If you start to lose a fight, you<br/>\ncan either run for the guards, or run around for a bit with<br/>\nboth Accelerando and the healing song playing until you think<br/>\nyou can finish him off.  Careful where you run though as being<br/>\n&quot;in combat&quot; tends to attract giant disease rats.  I usually<br/>\nstuck close to the mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do decide to venture in deeper, try to avoid going too<br/>\nfar in (especially the far left passage).  Meldrath (a L53<br/>\nnecromancer I hear) lives inside and casts some nasty spells<br/>\non you through the walls.  The worst, which thankfully has<br/>\nnever happened to me, is charm, at which point you will<br/>\nmerrily waltz into his lair to die, leaving your corpse<br/>\nunrecoverable.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
