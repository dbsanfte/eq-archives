But I think that&#39;s camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nSouth Karana - KFC crowded but then you have the &quot;Hill of Doom&quot; Head over<br/>\ntowards the Hermit (camp him if he&#39;s not taken - opps you dont camp - sorry)<br/>\nand park on top of one of those hills - kinda between Herman and KFC.  Have<br/>\nyour ranger track and pull back to the party on the hill. Opps camping<br/>\nagain?<br/>\n<br/>\nCazic-Thule - more trains and crowded but try the sewers - go down from the<br/>\ndoors above the double doors where you zone in from and explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOOT - is there a skelly island where you clear thru skellys to get to some<br/>\ngargoyles?<br/>\n<br/>\nUpper Guk - opps that&#39;s a hard dungeon if you dont have a good group who can<br/>\nhandle things like crowd control and runner stoppage.  Also, takes some<br/>\nexploring to find the good spots and you&#39;d prolly need to invis in, find a<br/>\nspot (like way back by ancient croc) and invis out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreants, druids - welcome to the dark side! (I was gonna add bards too but<br/>\nremembered what list this was going to &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nPermafrost - hard dungeon but has stuff. Key to some of these hard places<br/>\nmight be 2 groups willing to work together.  But you (not you personally but<br/>\ngenerically young 20&#39;s) are lo to mid 20&#39;s and still trying to learn to<br/>\nassist the main tank or assist the pet.  Also maybe the Redking (sp?) the<br/>\nplatform in Everfrost where the Icy Orcs are? Camped? Opps!  that bad word<br/>\nagain!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some ideas - but one thing you may need to come to terms with is this<br/>\ngame has _alot_ of campers and camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of 42 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 24, 2000 12:59 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the area of zones.  Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill.  Mistmoore is too<br/>\n&gt; deadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too<br/>\nfrequently<br/>\n&gt; to make the entry area safe.  Unrest is packed, last three times I was<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; there were 50+ people in them.  Sol A and Sol B are obviously beyond my<br/>\n&gt; groups ability at 21-24.  Haven&#39;t tried Paw since they lowered the<br/>\n&gt; difficulty but there was no way before.  Befallen is also fairly crowded<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; most everything there is too low to give me much xp anyhow.  Tried hunting<br/>\n&gt; skeletons in rathe but there were too many groups there as well.  Went to<br/>\nS<br/>\n&gt; Karana but there were 75+ people there mostly hunting aviaks. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
