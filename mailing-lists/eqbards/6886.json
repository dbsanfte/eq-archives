Sorry if we end up getting it<br/>\nposted twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nFellow bards,<br/>\n<br/>\nI came into work today and there were relatively few messages on the list.<br/>\nIn an effort to jumpstart some discussion, I have the following proposal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf enough people on this list thinks its a good idea, lets submit a petition<br/>\nto have the level 14 song replaced.  As most of you are aware, the song<br/>\ncurrently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already<br/>\nidentified.  All you have to do is right click on it.  The only situations I<br/>\nhave heard of the song providing any additional information is when it is<br/>\nsung while holding a head.  The name of the person who the head used to be<br/>\nattached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you are turning in<br/>\nthe head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses for this song.<br/>\n<br/>\nI propose that we also provide Verant with some ideas on a song to replace<br/>\nit with.  The biggest thing to remember here is that the power of the new<br/>\nsong should be appropriate for a 14th level character.  I don&#39;t think minor<br/>\nversions of any higher level song are likely to get approved.  The new song<br/>\nshould provide a completely new spell efffect.  I request that everyone<br/>\nsubmit to this list their idea of what the new 14th level song should be.<br/>\nOnce we get several good responses, we can all vote on which ones we think<br/>\nhave the best chance of getting approved.  We can then submit the petition<br/>\nto Verant with the entire list of suggested new songs ranked in the order we<br/>\nvote on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a couple of ideas that I have:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>\npower of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or toned<br/>\ndown versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  The<br/>\namount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you sing<br/>\nChant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an<br/>\ninstrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.  This<br/>\nsong would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order for<br/>\nVerant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in outdoor zones (no<br/>\ndungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a high skill<br/>\nlevel in the instrument that is required to play it.  If you miss a note and<br/>\nfail, the song button grays out for a specified amount of time before you<br/>\ncan try it again.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal<br/>\nbard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters are getting<br/>\nmauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if<br/>\nsomeone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think this<br/>\none would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can include it if<br/>\nthats what everyone wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are what I came up with on the fly.  Make any modifications to these<br/>\nthat you like.  Submit new ideas if you have one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in the Army and will be going out on a field exercise this Thursday for<br/>\nthe next week.  Assuming this message generates a lot of positive response,<br/>\nsomeone else will have to facilitate discussion on this issue until then.  I<br/>\nwill write up the petition when I get back next week if we all come to an<br/>\nagreement.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
