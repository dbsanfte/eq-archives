The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-623361674\">The &quot;quests&quot; in PoA are basically scavenger-hunt type of things.  You accumulate the 3 or 4 items required<br/>\nfor the trade-in, trade them in, get the item.  The final item for all quests is VERY rare.  I&#39;ve been to<br/>\nSky 6 times (cleared it through the Eye the last two times) and we&#39;ve only found the final item for one of<br/>\nthe Bard items twice (the Flute), none for any of the other Bard items.  And those we only found because<br/>\nwe were farming the Spiroc Lord, using a technique that is arguably an exploit, and which we do not use<br/>\nanymore.  You should make a list of the items (castersrealm has one) that are required for the Bard items,<br/>\nand carry a good weight-reducing bag (those components weigh a ton, like 5-25 pounds apiece), then hope<br/>\nfor a good roll if a rare one drops.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how far you&#39;re likely to go.  Sky takes a lot of planning, and some very specific tactics on<br/>\neach of the different islands.  Best bet is to listen to the raid leader and hope he knows what he&#39;s<br/>\ndoing.  Your role as a Bard is pretty straightforward, buffs/resists/regens.  I always ask &quot;what kind of<br/>\nmagic do we expect from this MOB&quot; pretty much anywhere I go, anyway.  I look like an ignorant doofus, but<br/>\nI end up singing the right stuff (and the others who were too chicken to ask the question appreciate it).<br/>\nSo just ask if they aren&#39;t telling you.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpect to die a lot.  Ask in advance if you need to bring cash up.  Bring up some extra jaspar and peridot<br/>\n(the Clerics and Enchanters will appreciate it) and tiny coffins if you have the bucks (don&#39;t admit you<br/>\nhave the coffins unless it becomes obvious that you&#39;re going to sit on your heinies for a couple of hours<br/>\nwithout them, they&#39;re too expensive, hehe) (this assumes you have a Necro along of the appropriate level<br/>\nto use them - 57 I think).  A properly organized raid should be correctly supplied beforehand, but my<br/>\nguild seems to fall short on that score.  Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 56 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; --- In eqbards@y..., &quot;Daniel P.
