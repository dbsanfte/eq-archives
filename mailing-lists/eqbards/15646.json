This stategy behind<br/>\nthis is that it will reduce the amount of damage inflicted on the entire<br/>\nparty.  I think it would be safe for me to say that almost every group I<br/>\njoin follows this tactic when we fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this tactic is that, due to bard hate, it opens up the bard<br/>\nto bear the brunt of the damage from the mobs that aren&#39;t engaged.  This<br/>\ntactic also puts the groups healer at risk because unengaged mobs are likely<br/>\nto attack him as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wondering that if in situations where you get 2+ mobs, that it might<br/>\nactually be smarter if the tanks in the group each attacked a different mob.<br/>\nIt would take longer to kill all the mobs, but it would help ensure that<br/>\ndamage to the group was spread out better.  Plus, if all the mobs are<br/>\nengaged, it would be safer for bards to sing Largos to debuff mob attack<br/>\nspeed.  Its quite possible that the damage multiple mobs inflict using this<br/>\ntactic (Largos in effect all the time) would be very close to the damage<br/>\nthey inflict when everyone focuses on one at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone had a lot of experience fighting in groups that followed the<br/>\nsecond line of reasoning?  I&#39;d like to hear what your results were.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
