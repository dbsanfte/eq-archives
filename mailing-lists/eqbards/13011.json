Our guild leader spends a great<br/>\ndeal of his time basically doing nothing - &quot;/shout level 50 wiz looking for<br/>\na group!&quot; So, he is happy to move us around, log in a lev 50 cleric and res<br/>\nus as needed.  If they are breaking planes, raiding boots or dragons,<br/>\nobviously you gotta wait or deal with it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple weekends ago, in a hi-mid 30&#39;s guild group we went to the live side<br/>\nand we took the jail room. The login server crashed and I went LinkDead.  I<br/>\ncould not get back in and gave up trying after a couple hours.  Next<br/>\nmorning, I wanted to play but did not want to &quot;bother&quot; the 50&#39;s.  So, I<br/>\nstudied a map real carefully and uncamped. There I was - face to face with a<br/>\nroom full of froogys.  I mashed screetch and took off for the exit.  The<br/>\nfroogys were not my problem but the mino-cows were. Stunned, spun, and<br/>\nsmooshed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I had to fess up and get some help.  And I was very embarrassed since<br/>\nthis was like my first week in the guild.  But they were real nice and both<br/>\na 50 wiz and 50 clr who were not busy came and got me.  &quot;Wow, you made it<br/>\nmuch further than I expected!  But really, there is no need for that - just<br/>\nask us next time.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild is quite a unique group of people.  The &#39;culture&#39; is one of making<br/>\neveryone better.  They think about how they can get things for other&#39;s and<br/>\nwork hard to make sure that everyone has the best stuff.  I was really<br/>\nimpressed when I saw how much they think about others in the guild.  I hear<br/>\n&quot;we have to get (this item)... for (that person)...&quot; much more that I hear<br/>\n&quot;who will help me get this...&quot; As a result we have a really good team.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you say about respecting their time is correct.  I don&#39;t expect them to<br/>\ndrop what they are doing and help little old me.  Even so, they are willing<br/>\nto help us mid levels grow.  Here&#39;s an example:  we had 2 groups in Guk -<br/>\none camping the frenzy and the other camping the king. I was with the frenzy<br/>\ncrew and had 2 50 ench, 1 50 cleric, a 40ish tank and me bard 40.  The king<br/>\nroom called for some help and one of the enchanters ran over.  Then he<br/>\ncalled for some help and the cleric gated over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHehe, then our room spawned and we needed some help.  The enchanter and the<br/>\ntank were down to less than half a bub of hp and dropping and getting<br/>\nstunned/interrupted.  So, I equipped my lute and played hymn.  More out of<br/>\ninstinct and last ditch attempt to heal (I think I cast minor heal on the<br/>\ntank with my crude stein too.)  Anyhow the frenzy or bloodthristy objected<br/>\nto me helping them and he helped himself to me. The others lived and in<br/>\nshort order I was ressed back. <br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent guilds have different attitudes.  I am not afraid to ask mine for<br/>\nhelp and they are not afraid to say &#39;sorry&#39; if they are busy.  But we got a<br/>\nlot of high levels and a bunch of us have 2 pc&#39;s and can run 2 logins at the<br/>\nsame time.  That along with some strategic binds makes things work quite<br/>\nsmoothly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 41st song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pantheon.worldshock.com\">http://pantheon.worldshock.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pantheon.worldshock.com\">http://pantheon.worldshock.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tPerhaps a Princess...
