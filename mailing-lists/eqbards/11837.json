I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t think it&#39;s to blame for the problem some bards are saying<br/>\nthey are having with charm. My CHA is only 102, and I regularly charm,<br/>\nHG, SG, Griffons, etc. I get some resists, but am still able to do it<br/>\nwill confidence that I will win.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf fact, my resist rate is ~50%. (of course once it works it seems<br/>\neasier the next time). But if my resist rate was 90%, I could still<br/>\ncharm and win. It would take a bit longer i&#39;m sure...<br/>\n<br/>\nThese stats are for soloing, not charming in group tactics. in that<br/>\ncase, a 50% resist rate is bad, possible deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n35th Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
