It<br/>\nsays lull type spells work by reducing the aggro radius of<br/>\ncreatures.  That would explain why sometimes Lament works (you<br/>\nget the &quot;sad&quot; message), but when you pull a mob, the mob you<br/>\njust Lamented still comes along.  If the mob you pull enters<br/>\nthe Lamented mob&#39;s aggro radius, both will come.  I&#39;ve played<br/>\naround a bit with this with my enchanter and it really does<br/>\nseem to work this way.  If I lull the closer mob and pull the<br/>\nfurther one so it takes a path near the closer one, the closer<br/>\none almost always joins.  If I lull the further one and pull<br/>\nthe closer one, I almost always get it alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when you Lament, be wary of the physical arrangement of the<br/>\nmobs, and the path they will take to get to you.  It&#39;s also<br/>\npossible that using a lute further reduces the aggro radius,<br/>\nas opposed to (or in addition to) increasing the duration of<br/>\nthe Lament.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
