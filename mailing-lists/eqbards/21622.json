In other words, you temporarily stop swinging for X number<br/>\nof seconds after casting a spell.  X is the your weapon DLY/10.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo does this affects bards?  We are constantly weaving songs so do we also<br/>\nstop swinging for X amount of seconds after our songs start?  I&#39;ve never<br/>\nreally noticed it myself so am inclined to believe this does not affect us.<br/>\nCan someone confirm?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
