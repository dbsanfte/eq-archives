I learned about singing the stamina song while swimming<br/>\na couple of weeks ago.  While on the boat in the OOT my PC locked up.  When<br/>\nI logged back on I was at the bottom of the ocean.  After reaching the top,<br/>\nI started the song and swam across the entire OOT until I reached the last<br/>\ndock before you reach Butcherblock.  Wouldn&#39;t have been able to do it unless<br/>\nI had the stamina song.  That&#39;s the only time I have ever had to use the<br/>\nstamina song since I&#39;ve been playing the character.  Anyway, it took me over<br/>\n45 minutes real time to get to the dock.  Raised my swimming skill by 40<br/>\npoints during the trip.  That was the only good thing that came out of the<br/>\nwhole deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGaltin<br/>\n\tE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
