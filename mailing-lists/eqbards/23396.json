I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; - if you mean<br/>\n&quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments have partials.<br/>\nRegardless, the determination of instrument types is by how the sound itself<br/>\nis generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips vibration creates<br/>\nthe sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child - a big day<br/>\nfor me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>\nShofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>\ninstrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the exception of the<br/>\nflute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations caused by the<br/>\nwind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind<br/>\ninstrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a brass player - we<br/>\nare creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies the sound.<br/>\nThis is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search of a good<br/>\nreed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get one or two in a<br/>\nbox of 20 - they are happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.
