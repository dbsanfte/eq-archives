This was a mutual agreement between me and the person I&#39;m making <br/>\nthe trade with, because he got me into the last guild I was in, so we&#39;re <br/>\nfriends, and I don&#39;t want to renege on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t want to ask them to kill a dragon, because they have a <br/>\nschedule for that, and all of the Bards in the Guild are on a schedule to <br/>\nreceive their epic stuff.
