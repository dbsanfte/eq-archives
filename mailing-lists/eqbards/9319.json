(Charm<br/>\nis a great taunt - if something is frenzied on your cleric or a weak party<br/>\nmember - charm it to taunt it off.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, charm the mob then quick target the victim and click pet attack.<br/>\nThen re-target pet and get busy with a re-charm.  I find that I need to keep<br/>\ncharming as soon as I recover from the first charm cast.  Barely any time to<br/>\nissue commands.  For perspective, it&#39;s about as easy to me to weave 3 songs<br/>\nas it is for John Kim to weave 4 (my guess to the relative difficulty any<br/>\nways - sure I can do it - if all goes right.  But in reality, 2 songs at a<br/>\ntime - in full combat --  is my practical limit.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes you miss a note or get a resist and pet come to you.  Then you<br/>\nre-charm and pet frenzies on a party member.  Now quick do pet back off and<br/>\nhe calms down.  You ranger buddy calms down too now :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPutz around with some gnolls and stuff that is real easy in order to get<br/>\nyour hot keys and clicking routines down pat.  Heck, I get resists from<br/>\ngnoll pups so you should be able to practice everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, October 28, 1999 12:05 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Observations: Upper & Lower<br/>\nGuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tJohn Kim said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; I prefer charm since it helps reduce<br/>\n\t\t&gt; downtime.
