He is L50.  His placeholder is a lava guardian.<br/>\n  He is guarded by two L48 imp protectors.  It absolutely takes<br/>\n  at least two groups to reach him.  Every time I&#39;ve seen one <br/>\n  group persue the boots, they were doing CR afterwards.  You<br/>\n  have to dispatch a handful of L39-41 sonic bats, possibly<br/>\n  a few lava beetles and lava duct crawlers to reach the stepping<br/>\n  stone room.  There you will find two or three lava guardians.<br/>\n  Beyond that there are two or three imp protectors.  Beyond <br/>\n  that &lt;g&gt; there is another spawn of lava guardian / imp protectors.<br/>\n  Then you can reach the Efreeti&#39;s Room.  Enchanter required the<br/>\n  whole way, imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And how often does he drop those Boots?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Boots are common, the ring is &#39;rare&#39;.  The boots seem to drop<br/>\n  less than 75% of the time.  Getting the Efreeti to spawn is<br/>\n  a whole &#39;nother story.  He usually has his darn placeholder <br/>\n  pop up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve heard those Efreeti boots trade VERY highly - I&#39;ve seen mithril or<br/>\n&gt; Ykesha&#39;s trade with that one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Chances are, if you have a pair of these you looted them from the<br/>\n  Efreeti yourself and are wearing them.  Bards have no real reason<br/>\n  to want to wear these boots.  In fact, I dont include myself in <br/>\n  the random, nor would I let other melee classes do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
