Odds are if I was even 80% as effective as them I would win out by<br/>\nrandom chance vs some mobs when I did well and they did not and I would get<br/>\nthe mob attention.  This never happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll combat messages were on and they way outdamaged me, not even close.<br/>\nRanger has double attack in addition to dual wield and the sk was just scary<br/>\nwith double attack and his 2-hddr.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIts the typical problem many game systems have.  Being focused is all that<br/>\nreally counts.  Being versatile just means you stink at everything.  Neither<br/>\nthe ranger nor the sk worried about putting points anywhere but strength and<br/>\nagility and stamina because it just didn&#39;t matter.  Where I have higher<br/>\nstats overall, particularly in Charisma, they have much higher combo of<br/>\nstrength and stamina than me.  Agility is about the same all around.  the sk<br/>\ncan hit twice in a round for 40+ points each hit (Dark Reaver), the ranger<br/>\nhas the same combo I do, PGT and Dirk, plus he has double attack so can hit<br/>\ntwice as well.  Their focus on melee stats (extra hp&#39;s and more melee<br/>\nskills) makes them far more effective than me.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider.  All melee classes get 6 or 7 melee skills except bards.  we get<br/>\ntwo, dodge (which everyone gets) and dual wield.  That&#39;s not even close to<br/>\n50%.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 12:25 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bards abilities redefined was: Attack speedups <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 30 Mar 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our melee is really too weak currently to qualify as a secondary.

We agreed to test out our melee skills,<br/>\nletting<br/>\n&gt; the monsters be the judges.  None of us cat any spells or used any<br/>\nabilities<br/>\n&gt; except the ranger to snare mobs that had ceased to offer their opinion as<br/>\n&gt; judges.  The result?  I did not take more than a single attack the entire<br/>\n&gt; night in any fight.  In 4 hours of play I took maybe 150 points of damage.<br/>\n&gt; The shadowknight won the contest but only barely.  He was attacked 54% of<br/>\n&gt; the time, the ranger 46%.   The number of attacks on me was below 1%.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a bit misleading.  Your melee could be 95% that of the<br/>\nranger (and the SK&#39;s 101%) and you could get the same results.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d be better off turning on all attack messages, then<br/>\nparsing the file afterwards to figure out damage/sec and<br/>\ndamage_taken/sec figures.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
