A lot of them I would not even finish <br/>\n&gt; because I got bored<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with them.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since April and I am still <br/>\n&gt; having lots of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fun playing.  As a 22d level bard, I still have alot of <br/>\n&gt; things I can look<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forward to doing in the game.  I haven&#39;t even considered <br/>\n&gt; buying a new game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since April. <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   Well put !!!! I was just telling my wife how much money she save<br/>\n&gt; because I have not brought the 3 or 4 games a month that I used to ! <br/>\n&gt; Now I may but Diablo 2 but EQ I play every day and the one game I<br/>\n&gt; brought since EQ (TA Kingdoms) I haven&#39;t bothered to finish. <br/>\n&gt; But I will<br/>\n&gt; collect pop bottles on the side of the road to get the EQ <br/>\n&gt; Expansion pack<br/>\n&gt; :) You can&#39;t beat playing with real folk :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    Bill, AKA Moonflower CZ-Thule<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
