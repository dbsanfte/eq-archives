We had a real jerk bind himself just<br/>\ninside the zone in lower guk, head DEEP inside, whack<br/>\none frog, and gate. The ensuing trained killed almost<br/>\neveryone between frog #1 and the zone. Gate is only<br/>\nsafer when used by non-idiots - an all too rare<br/>\ncommodity these days. I for one, would love to play on<br/>\nan adults only server. Make you have to prove you&#39;re<br/>\nover 18, maybe pass an IQ test first. Maybe have<br/>\nstricter rules and make it easy to get booted off the<br/>\nserver. You wouldn&#39;t be banned from eq, just from the<br/>\none server.  That&#39;d be so nice, a server with no<br/>\nstupid children shouting to zone, causing trains,<br/>\ntyping without using consonants, swearing flagrantly,<br/>\netc. Too bad it would never happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDouble<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nThousands of Stores.
