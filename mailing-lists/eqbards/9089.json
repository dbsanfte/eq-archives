Since I&#39;ve been singing a lot in Cazic-Thule I&#39;ve been<br/>\nwhipping up batches of Beer Braised Gator and Lizard-On-A-Stick for my<br/>\ngroupmates.  Since I am in pickup groups a lot this sometimes really freaks<br/>\npeople out!  It&#39;s amazing that many poeple are completely unaware that you<br/>\ncan cook all of these meats that you so often destroy.<br/>\n<br/>\nA female rogue that I was grouping with got a real kick out of my handing<br/>\nher a couple of Beer Braised Gator steaks when we were fighting the tough<br/>\nlittle alligators.  After a particularly nasty fight in which the gator just<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t taunt off of her and took her down to one bubble, she looted the<br/>\ngator, gave me the meat and said &quot;Cook this one for me.  I&#39;m eating his<br/>\nass.&quot;  She then proceded to put those steaks first in line in her inventory.<br/>\n&quot;Virtual payback&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 28th song bard on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
