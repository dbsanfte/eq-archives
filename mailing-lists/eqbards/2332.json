We tried levitating him <br/>\nout; it didn&#39;t help.  While waiting for a GM to respond to the petition, <br/>\nand discussing whether we should just group-teleport out and come back, <br/>\nsomeone thought of the Melifluous Motion song.  The group wizard cast <br/>\nlevitate on me and the stuck player (since this urn was next to a deep pit <br/>\nfull of lava), we ungrouped and I grouped with just the stuck player, and I <br/>\nsang a verse of the Motion song. Blink, and we&#39;re both elsewhere in the <br/>\nroom.  Unstuck!<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
