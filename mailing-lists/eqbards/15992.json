I<br/>\nenjoy it, but my interest has been waning of late.  I&#39;ve played 8 different<br/>\nclasses, 4 to over 20th (my monk will hit 30 soon), been to every zone,<br/>\nexcept the Planes of course) at least a few times, and am just finding it to<br/>\nbe very limited.  I do prefer soloing, and we all know how hard that can be,<br/>\nat times.  I don&#39;t mind grouping, but I really don&#39;t like being forced to do<br/>\nit.. I think that&#39;s the one thing that will get me to try AC out.  If I can<br/>\nsolo throughout my entire career (not that I will, but who knows..) that<br/>\nwill be a HUGE benefit to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo they give you a free month as well?  I may just decide to pick it up.. I<br/>\njust got my tax refund back last week. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lyrnia Jongleur&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lyrnia@...\">Lyrnia@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heya everybody!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not quitting EQ (yet) but Asheron&#39;s call is my number 1 game if my RL<br/>\n&gt; friends aren&#39;t logged into EQ.
