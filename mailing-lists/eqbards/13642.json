He stated this when Paw was upgraded so you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can take his &quot;mid level&quot; as someone suitable to play Paw. As Brad has<br/>\n&gt;&gt; direct access to the customer database, I think this provides a perfect<br/>\n&gt;&gt; example of the uselessness of web polls. The only thing that poll tells<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you is that 6% of the people who go to everlore and bothered to take the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; poll (and only voted once) have a 45+ character.
