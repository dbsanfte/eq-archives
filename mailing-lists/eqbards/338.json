I <br/>\nmisplaced an expression of my frustration with all of the posts <br/>\ntrashing Verant, trashing the Soerbairds, trashing individual <br/>\nposters, and everything else under the sun. Nearly all of it totally <br/>\nmisplaced.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO EQ is the most awesome online game I have ever encountered and I <br/>\nam appalled at how people will whine even when a company is as <br/>\nresponsive to it&#39;s customer&#39;s concerns as Verant has been so far. I <br/>\nplayed Meridian 59 for years at 3 times the cost and 3DO was totally <br/>\nUNresponsive to it&#39;s customers concerns. The UO staff was nearly as <br/>\nbad. <br/>\n<br/>\nGee, I am sorry that I&#39;m not following the crowd, but I actually <br/>\nappreciate Verant.
