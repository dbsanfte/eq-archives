These<br/>\nquestions stem from looking at the Bard Song Calculator 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at the output it says that at level 21 my songs do the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nCoD w/intr 14dam x 3 ticks = 42<br/>\n       wo/intr 3dam x 3 ticks = 9<br/>\n<br/>\nDDD  w/intr 19dam x 3 ticks = 57<br/>\n        wo/intr 5dam x 3 ticks = 15<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, when I start a song and then stop the song it will pulse for 3 ticks<br/>\nfrom what I have read on this board. <br/>\n<br/>\n1)  If I change instruments after stopping the song do I still get the<br/>\ninstrument effect during the 3 ticks ??  ie with DDD do I do 19+19+19 or<br/>\nwill it do 19+5+5.<br/>\n<br/>\nA: 19x3<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Do creatures get resist attempts on each tick or do they only get the<br/>\nresist attempt on the first pulse?  reasoning behind this is that at times<br/>\nmy damage seems to go to nil even though I am not being resisted as far as<br/>\nI can see.<br/>\n<br/>\nA: Dot&#39;s are All or Nothing. If they fail the initial check they will take<br/>\nfull damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  How long is a tick?  Is it 3 seconds or is it 6 seconds?<br/>\n<br/>\nA: 6 seconds<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx for you time and the great discussions held on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatawyn 21st Season Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nThe Arcane Order - Mithaniel Marr Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
