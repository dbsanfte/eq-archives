Capozzi [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:croak63@...\">croak63@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 6:01 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] New Patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has no effect at all on Clarity and the rate at which your party members<br/>\nregen mana.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe Desperate Dirge is VERY powerful for a bard song.  Most bard songs are<br/>\nclassified as cantrips, quick little spells that have minor duration and<br/>\nimpact when song once, but add up over time.  This song breaks out of that<br/>\nmold completely.  The mana use, and the lack of regen, was needed to keep it<br/>\nfrom being overused.  As the name implies, it&#39;s a last ditch effort on the<br/>\nbard&#39;s part to end a combat.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;d kicked around the idea of the song stunning the bard for 10 to 30<br/>\nseconds as another balance factor, or using a horn or lute as a consumable<br/>\nreagent, but neither proved practical, or easy to code.  The change making<br/>\nbards immune to mana regen was relatively easy to implement.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s going to take at least 30 minutes of just sitting to regen all that<br/>\nmana once you cast the song, twice that if you remain standing.  And thats<br/>\nas it should be.  The song rivals harm touch at that level in damage done (A<br/>\n43rd level SK can do 430 to a SINGLE target), and this song will hit FOUR<br/>\ntargets.  That&#39;s 1600 damage, fast.  It&#39;s use should be limited.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd it might encourage bards to wear more mana and mana stat boosting items,<br/>\nso they can have a larger mana reserve to draw from, speeding downtime<br/>\nbetween songs a bit.  This is fine, as it means in most cases that they&#39;ll<br/>\nhave to give up better armor to wear the low or no AC caster tuned garb.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Douglas  &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bierbower@...\">Bierbower@...</a>&gt; Bierbower <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;  <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 5:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] New Patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read it the same way. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, the patch message seemed to indicate their would be no method<br/>\npossible to speed up a bard&#39;s mana regen rate, it gave no indication of any<br/>\nchange that would alter how current bard songs *may* speed mana regen for<br/>\nother party members (or maybe I just read it wrong). <br/>\n<br/>\nAriell, Karana Server <br/>\n-the resident &quot;dumb&quot; bard *smiles* <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge Holt wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n in addition there is no way for bards to speed up mana regen...
