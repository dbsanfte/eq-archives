[BTW, i realize that proc means cast, but what does it stand for or <br/>\nmean? =)] So will weilding both of these drain my stamina too quickly you <br/>\nthink?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) And what are some good hot keys to have set up as I&#39;m just learning the <br/>\nskill?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) When you auto attack, do both weapons go auto or must you continue to <br/>\nclick on some key or repeatedly type something?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) What are some other good relatively inexpensive weapons to use for this? <br/>\nSome ideas i have are Bladed Thulian Claws, Dragoon Dirk, and a 1h staff <br/>\npossibly a Staff of Writhing. Those are still a little out of my price range <br/>\nthough; Dirk is not, but no one seems to ever want to let one go. =P Unless <br/>\nthey just ran across a Runed Bone Fork - in my dreams!!<br/>\n<br/>\n   Well I guess I can wait on some gift from the Gods or help from you <br/>\nfriendly wanderers of Norrath.
