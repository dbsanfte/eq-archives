Both have assured me that once your CHA<br/>\npasses 110 there is no longer a change in vendor prices.  And after 140<br/>\nthere is no change in the NPC consideration of you.  So I&#39;d say that once<br/>\nyou get over 110, only faction can help you more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCharisma does help when buying from your own race.  My wizard only has 65<br/>\ncha, but with a newbie enchanter at 95.  there was a 150 plat difference in<br/>\nprices.  And I know my wizard has killed many a minotaur, so my racial<br/>\nfaction is higher than the newbie.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nThe Crimson Knights<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;When i got my steel plate, i made a gnome enchanter and poured all points to<br/>\n&gt;charisma.  since a gnome was buying from gnomes, more charisma had no effect<br/>\n&gt;on prices.   the breastplate was 768pp, and they rest were slightly less<br/>\n&gt;than your list as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada Silverleaf, Level 50 Bard, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt;Erisi, Level 15 Paladin, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; With more charisma, you should be able to get it for 787.5pp.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s my best price list again for small steel plate:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; 787.5 Breastplate<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 346.5 Boots<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 252   Bracers<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 420   Greaves<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 294   Belt<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 147   Collar<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 483   Gloves<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 336   Arms<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 367.5 Pauldron<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 367.5 Helm<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 105   Mask<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 399   Cloak<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The &quot;hidden&quot; base price is 5% below this (price/1.05).
