I<br/>\nhate soloing, its too damned boring IMO.<br/>\nI have started to hunt with groups in Dreadlands, on the north wall of karnor to<br/>\nbe precise. I still find that 3 spawn in Overthere gives me better experince<br/>\noverall + I have just about hunted so many berzerkers that I am able to enter<br/>\nthe outpost without my mask (They con threathingly without the mask) So I think<br/>\nI will do my last bubble of hell (40th) in OT.<br/>\nBtw I almost never have problems finding a group. Only problem is that the zones<br/>\nwhere people hunt during my playhours, are the same well known zones which is<br/>\ntottaly crowded during peek hours. I guess thats the curse of playing on the<br/>\nhours where there is less than 1k people on the server - I seldom get to fight<br/>\nin the less populated zones like dalnir.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I tried some hunting in the Emerald Jungle. Easy to fear/chain the iksars.<br/>\n&gt;Was funny, I tried to charm them and after the 4th failure remembered that<br/>\n&gt;they can&#39;t be charmed. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can&#39;t say the loot has been to great, but not many people in the zone so<br/>\n&gt;the lag isn&#39;t too bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Windleaf<br/>\n&gt;Happily sitting at his 40th song, in no rush to 50. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Musiker &quot;wants to get planes capable&quot; Silverdrum</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
