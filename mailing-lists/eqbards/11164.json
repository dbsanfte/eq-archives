Most Bard Songs leave an <br/>\n&gt; icon on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>\n&gt; seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration -<br/>\n&gt; this means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially<br/>\n&gt; keep the song effect going indefinitely.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the <br/>\n&gt; Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again. <br/>\n&gt; Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it <br/>\n&gt; does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your<br/>\n&gt; screen. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
