Mailing<br/>\nlists and maps are straightforward ways for people to exchange information<br/>\nand can be kept somewhat in game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is using programming internals to further my ability to beat the<br/>\ncomputer program.  That&#39;s not the game I want to play.  It&#39;s too much like<br/>\ndisassembling code to decypher the operating system so I can write whizbang<br/>\nprograms of my own, or getting playing hints by printing out all the text<br/>\nmessages from the software.  That&#39;s playing the computer system, not the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n/loc and the grid system are program mechanisms, not a game world feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an old, familiar argument.  I&#39;ve had it before about exploiting<br/>\nrule glitches in live roleplaying games.  Some people do because they get<br/>\nmore power.  Others won&#39;t because they want to play the fantasy game, not<br/>\nthe external rules.  I&#39;m of the latter group and as a game rules designer<br/>\ntried to eliminate the abilities of the former.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
