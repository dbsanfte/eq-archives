I took them out easily with Bellow, Hymn and Chords w/ lute (no magic<br/>\nweapon yet). I don&#39;t think I would have faired as well strictly using<br/>\nBellow, which leads me to think that a like-level warrior using only magic<br/>\nH2H before the change would have a challenge and long downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know warrior&#39;s don&#39;t get bellow but don&#39;t they have double attack by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>then<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and dual wield?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My first char. when I was learning the game was a barb. warrior.
