Basically, you have 4 - 4 position &quot;hats&quot; and several buttons<br/>\n- one for each finger and some fingers can do 4 key presses.  You can<br/>\nprogram it to send many many different key strokes. Your hand wraps around<br/>\nit so the position is &#39;natural&#39; and non-cramping.  They are designed so that<br/>\nyou can keep your hands off the keyboard and still &#39;press keys&#39; for your<br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chproducts.com/pcgear/prothrot.html\">http://www.chproducts.com/pcgear/prothrot.html</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chproducts.com/pcgear/prothrot.html\">http://www.chproducts.com/pcgear/prothrot.html</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI have one and use this in my left hand.  I use one hat switch for movement<br/>\n(also does a sense heading each time I press it to move or turn) - fwd,<br/>\nback, turn left/right (also steer with mouse and plan to replace the turn<br/>\nleft/right with other functions)  Then have buttons for select nearest npc &<br/>\ncon (does both on one button); attack button; inventory screen button; f9<br/>\nbutton; f10 button; hot keys 2, 4 & 6 on one button (for my warrior - does<br/>\nkick bash and taunt in one press).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I know more how my bard should be working - I need to make some<br/>\nadjustments so I can select various hot key pallets - then have buttons to<br/>\nfire the various hot keys. Currently I am going to the keyboard to twist<br/>\nsongs and want to get this onto the throttle. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know how hard it is (and dangerous) to change once you have &quot;your system&quot;<br/>\nthe way you like it.  But if you are having trouble - carpal tunnel, etc,<br/>\nyou might consider this an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tLora Roa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, July 07, 1999 5:00 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Twisting<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tDepends on whether you&#39;re talking head/eye work or hand/eye<br/>\ntwitch speed.<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;ve got no problem with concentration.
