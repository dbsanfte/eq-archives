A dwarf warrior gave me a small bronze cloak, and someone else gave<br/>\nme a Mithril Quill, both while I was just hanging out near the bank in<br/>\nFreeport waiting for someone.  Others have giving me things, or &#39;traded&#39;<br/>\nthings as well, where it was obvious I was getting the better end of things.<br/>\nI hope this continues into the future. :)  Maybe someone will be nice enough<br/>\nto give me some lambent armor.  &lt;wink, wink, nudge, nudge&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelaian<br/>\nBard of the 10th Refrain, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I play on Tunare , and it is true there aren&#39;t many events on the server.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do get invited into guilds all the time.
