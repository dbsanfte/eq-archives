Lately I haven&#39;t been<br/>\nfighting many mobs that are all by their lonesome.  Usually<br/>\nthere are several green things nearby or wandering around.<br/>\nPlay binding and they will become aggresive to you.  Also, the<br/>\nfew times that I *do* want to use an area effect song, I<br/>\nalmost always hit Lullaby.  Why slow down their attack speed<br/>\nwhen you can stop their attacks almost entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat aside, has anybody tried timing how long the Binding<br/>\neffect lasts?  Is it something you need to keep twisting, or<br/>\nis just hitting it once at the beginning of a fight enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sure it can get rather boring but I can tell you that<br/>\n&gt; it is nowhere near as boring as kiting is. Imagine running around from<br/>\n&gt; anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes with a mob on your tail, not being able to<br/>\n&gt; talk to anyone or risk a fair amount to type in tells, just pounding the<br/>\n&gt; Bellow and Accelerando hot keys.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah.  I&#39;ve kited a few times and I agree entirely.  It is<br/>\nmind-numbingly boring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; \tIf you&#39;re fighting multiples and have good clearance then area effect songs<br/>\n&gt; like Discord or Lullably can be more effective than Bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is there a less dangerous brass song that I can use later to<br/>\nwork on my brass skill?  I still don&#39;t like the idea of<br/>\nleaving myself playing Discord overnight in some remote<br/>\nlocation to work on the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
