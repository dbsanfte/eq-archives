Congrats on getting the BP so quick!  I&#39;ve spent countless<br/>\nhours at the AOF and I &quot;might&quot; have seen one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I forgot to mention, which you discovered (sorry for it<br/>\nbeing late to help you : /)... The sewers are somewhat tough to pull from<br/>\nwhen unbroken.  There are typically 2 lizards in each room and several<br/>\ngators in the water.  The gators kind of blend in with the water making it<br/>\ndifficult to know how many you&#39;re pulling.  You can also miss gators and go<br/>\nto the next room and of course they will jump on the train on the way back.<br/>\nBasically, overpulls from the sewers are a fact of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe whoever heads there next can make use of this extra stuff. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all getting very tired of hearing my pleas for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>advice,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but you guys give such awesome advice that things go smoothly and I&#39;m<br/>\n </span></blockquote>forced<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to move on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night our group went to cazic to get the RS BP for our rogue.
