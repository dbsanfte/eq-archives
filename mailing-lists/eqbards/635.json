I&#39;ve upgraded to<br/>\n56k, and the only difference is I go linkdead less often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; The increased speed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; DOES mean a lot, btw - much more than the increased str.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Has anybody figured out exactly what it is increased str does?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Increased str = increased attack score, thus, you hit more often, and have<br/>\nmore potential to do more damage.  I&#39;m right on a threshold for both STR<br/>\nand DEX, so I notice immediately when STR and DEX bonuses make a<br/>\ndifference.  (For example, I recently bought two dervish rings, and instead<br/>\nof boosting my ac by 2, they boosted it by 5, because the dex bonus pushed<br/>\nme over that threshold.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And as I said yesterday, the speed boost for both the anthem<br/>\n&gt;and the whistling warsong do not stack, so there&#39;s less of a<br/>\n&gt;reason to use both together.  (Would be interested if others<br/>\n&gt;find differently)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t aware that the warsong gave a speed bonus - in fact, in my<br/>\ncomparisons (I use scarabs as my &quot;baseline&quot;) with no bonus, I hit less<br/>\noften than the creature I&#39;m fighting, with the Warsong, it&#39;s the same, but<br/>\nthe Anthem puts me at equal-to or faster.  Pretty sweet if you ask me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to stacking, I had someone point out that this might be<br/>\nconsidered &quot;abuse&quot; - what are your thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies on Bristlebane<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
