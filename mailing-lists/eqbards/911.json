Aye, you re finding the earlier version of the problem I ve had in low 30 s lvls. One solution is to find (or create) a semi-permanent group.  People you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-821297947\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;I was wondering if anyone has been experiencing the same things that I<br/>\n&gt;have been as of late.  To start off I remember when I finally reached<br/>\n&gt;level 6 and got hymm of restoration, I was  a hot commodity in just about<br/>\n&gt;any group.  However now that I am at lvl 16 no one seem to want a bard in<br/>\n&gt;their party.  Perhaps it is because of my hunting in unrest, but I would<br/>\n&gt;think a bard would be a useful addition to any party there.  However, it<br/>\n&gt;seems a bard&#39;s utility is my undoing.  People either want a tank, or a<br/>\n&gt;healer or a burner and I can never be any of them.  Many parties seem to<br/>\n&gt;forget the advantages of some of the bard songs.  With anthem, my friend a<br/>\n&gt;lvl 14 Druid and I were able to mow down Tormented after tormented with<br/>\n&gt;next to no downtime.  In fact my friend rarely cast a spell because the<br/>\n&gt;two of us could melee the TDs without too much trouble.  I was armed with<br/>\n&gt;a Combine Long Sword and he a runed Totem Staff.  Now I can imagine how<br/>\n&gt;effective Warriors would be with Dual wield and dual attacks and all tanks<br/>\n&gt;in general.  Does partying get worse from here on out?  I have started a<br/>\n&gt;mage and had more luck partying at level 13, than I did with my bard which<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t make too much sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye, you&#39;re finding the earlier version of the problem I&#39;ve had in low 30&#39;s<br/>\nlvls.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne solution is to find (or create) a semi-permanent group.  People you are<br/>\nwith most of the time, who will agree to keep you as a member of the &quot;core&quot;<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the game, there are points where one class&#39;s star dims, and<br/>\nanother&#39;s rises.  Spell casters are hot for first level or two after new<br/>\nspell level.  Bards are hot after certain songs and a few abilities (such as<br/>\ntracking at 35).  You just have to keep going until you hit another hot<br/>\nlevel for bards.  Your next one should be at either lvl 18 (discord) or 19<br/>\n(sleep).<br/>\n<br/>\nLinako</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
