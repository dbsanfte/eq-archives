I&#39;m not going to petition to<br/>\nget it back.  I&#39;ll probably just beat up the next decaying skeleton I see<br/>\nwith a cracked staff since I&#39;d only been using it for skill increases<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat worries me is if this is a code change where any time you die you&#39;ll<br/>\nloose what&#39;s on your cursor.  I&#39;d like to say &quot;Verant would never do that&quot;<br/>\nbut I can&#39;t, and if I loose my gnoll hide lariat I&#39;ll cry.  Did anyone else<br/>\ndie since the last patch with an item on their cursor that the know<br/>\nappeared in their corpse&#39;s inventory?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, wondering if Selo&#39;s without a drum effect is fast enough to chase a<br/>\nfleeing decaying skeleton<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                         <br/>\n                   Ioshua                                                <br/>\n                   &lt;Ioshua@rocke        To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>      <br/>\n                   tmail.com&gt;           cc:                              <br/>\n                                        Subject:     Re: [eqbards]       <br/>\n                   01/12/2001           Anyone else seen this?           <br/>\n                   11:26 AM                                              <br/>\n                   Please                                                <br/>\n                   respond to                                            <br/>\n                   eqbards                                               <br/>\n                                                                         <br/>\n                                                                         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to a GM, they will probably have you email someone specific. If<br/>\nthey refuse ask for the email anyhow. Explain the situation and<br/>\ndepending on what kind of day the person had you may or may not get it<br/>\nback. I&#39;ve never gotten the shaft on lost item bugs before but people I<br/>\nknow have. However, not to be a downer, it was a bronze mace and they<br/>\nmay not deem it to be worth the effort. If you get past their lazyness<br/>\nyou aught get it back. Best of luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinev Desksleeper<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JESSICA_WEBBER@...\">JESSICA_WEBBER@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; First off, this may not have happened.
