You&#39;d have to be a fool not to<br/>\nwant one in your group.  Yes their DoTs don&#39;t get to last<br/>\ntheir full duration if you kill stuff quickly, but the DoT(s)<br/>\nthey do manage to put on do about as much damage as 1-3 tanks.  <br/>\nTheir pet does about that much too.  I could see passing up<br/>\nnecros for if someone else (especially a buffer or healer)<br/>\nwere available, but if there&#39;s an empty slot and a necro comes<br/>\na-looking, they&#39;re in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at the formulas I whipped up for the seven-string<br/>\nlute comparison, you&#39;ll see that the two primary factors in a<br/>\nfight are damage rate, and survival time (rate of damage<br/>\ntaken).  Any class who can solo well will have a very good<br/>\nratio of these two.  When you group, you add your damage rate<br/>\nto the group&#39;s, while your survival time is usurped by those<br/>\nwith the best values (tanks, pets).  Neither of these<br/>\ndramatically make the necro any weaker in groups.  Their<br/>\nprimary grouped handicap is that they take a while for their<br/>\ndamage rate to &quot;ramp up&quot; and the group often ends up killing<br/>\nstuff before they hit their max.  Still, it can&#39;t take *that*<br/>\nlong to ramp up or else they&#39;d need to have a large survival<br/>\ntime in order to solo, in which case they would be able to<br/>\nsupplant the role of tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, &quot;great solo, poor grouped&quot; is a contradiction.  <br/>\nThe worst you can get is &quot;great solo, ok grouped.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
