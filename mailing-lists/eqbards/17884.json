At that time I decided to<br/>\ntest lament to see how well it would stick.  So I memed it and tossed it<br/>\ninto my battle weave.  at 48 with an unbuffed cha of about 115 I was getting<br/>\nresisted about 40% of the time.  I am itching to try it now on a single<br/>\nparty break in to Efreeti :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeff Illian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, April 17, 2000 7:57 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Lame List of New Spells <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Much as I&#39;ve enjoyed using it, I can attest to it&#39;s power, <br/>\n&gt; and perhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; overpower.  In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd <br/>\n&gt; control.  Whenever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second, <br/>\n&gt; command it to /pet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a <br/>\n&gt; ways away, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I finally feel like my old level 30 self again.  This weekend I led an<br/>\n&gt; Efreeti run.  On the third pull someone wandered off a little <br/>\n&gt; too far and<br/>\n&gt; agroed 2 Lava Guardians and 3 Imps right after we had <br/>\n&gt; finished off an imp.<br/>\n&gt; Our enchanter went OOM after the first of the 3 remaining <br/>\n&gt; Imps fell leaving<br/>\n&gt; me to crowd control alone.  Using Charm on one of the imps, I <br/>\n&gt; was able to<br/>\n&gt; keep both imps busy while we were able to finish off the lava <br/>\n&gt; elementals and<br/>\n&gt; then the imps with no further casualties :).  From that point <br/>\n&gt; forward, the<br/>\n&gt; enchanter and I had it worked out so that I would charm the <br/>\n&gt; extra incoming<br/>\n&gt; in each pull and keep them busy while he mezzed singles.  I <br/>\n&gt; would then tell<br/>\n&gt; him when the charm broke so he could start mezzing my pet.  <br/>\n&gt; This had the<br/>\n&gt; nice effect of keeping the imp pounding on me instead of the <br/>\n&gt; enchanter until<br/>\n&gt; he could get the mez to stick as well as giving us an extra <br/>\n&gt; hand in battle.<br/>\n&gt; We repeated the process every time mez broke as well with <br/>\n&gt; great success.<br/>\n&gt; The enchanter barely took damage the rest of the break in and <br/>\n&gt; used a lot<br/>\n&gt; less mana.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was EXTREMELY tempted to attempt pulling for this raid...  <br/>\n&gt; I really wanted<br/>\n&gt; to try out a combination of Lament and charm to pull on these <br/>\n&gt; to see if I<br/>\n&gt; could really control the pulling better then the monk.  In <br/>\n&gt; the end I went<br/>\n&gt; with traditional break in techniques but I&#39;m not so sure the <br/>\n&gt; traditional<br/>\n&gt; break in is the best way to go anymore.  Have any of you <br/>\n&gt; tried Lament on the<br/>\n&gt; Imp or Lava guardians or been the puller for the Efreeti <br/>\n&gt; raid?  If Lament<br/>\n&gt; would work, I really think that a single well balanced party <br/>\n&gt; of 6 might be<br/>\n&gt; able to handle the break in alone.... :)  If none of you have <br/>\n&gt; tried it, I<br/>\n&gt; think I might go for it next weekend...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW, 2 Efreeti in the first 3 spawns and then we were shut <br/>\n&gt; out with only<br/>\n&gt; place holders for the next 10 hours...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Taneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 48th song<br/>\n&gt; Prexus<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; GET WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE FREE!
