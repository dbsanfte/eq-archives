After you zone into Sol A, pass the lava and go<br/>\nthrough the hole in the wall, you&#39;ll come to a T intersection<br/>\nat the ledge.  If you go straight (off the ledge) there&#39;s a<br/>\ndoorway.  Go through that door and follow the right<br/>\nwall.  There&#39;s one passage that will loop back (ends at a<br/>\nwindow above a previous area), but if you skip it and keep<br/>\nfollowing the right wall, it&#39;ll take you straight to the room<br/>\nwith the Solusek Mage.  The room immediately prior to this,<br/>\nthere&#39;s a door on the left which leads to the king room.  So<br/>\nit&#39;s actually not that bad a place to use as a base and pull<br/>\nto.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou *will* need a group.  Just clear as you go, and be careful<br/>\nto give yourself time for when the room respawns.  I had a<br/>\nfull L30-36 group overwhelmed in here because we had a 4<br/>\ngoblin pull when the room goblins started to spawn (two<br/>\nhealers too, never did find the second, probably healing<br/>\nthrough the walls).  This is the high level goblin portion of<br/>\nSol A by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
