We were killing all the available birds on<br/>\nthe Isle, though not excluding others from joining in, in the hopes of<br/>\nspawning Gull and Soarin for the 2 clerics and 2 shamans in our group.  By<br/>\nthe rules as stated by Caltin, if another group came along they could demand<br/>\nthat we ignore one of those two named spawns when he appeared and share him<br/>\nwith them even if he spawned near us first.  That&#39;s certainly the impression<br/>\nI get from the posts there and that we would be eld especially accountable<br/>\nbecause we were a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jasonf@...\">jasonf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 16, 2000 11:14 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Worldly Issues & &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jasonf@...\">jasonf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s silly.  On Fennin Ro (crowded as hell) the King/Priest/Champ are all<br/>\nthree different groups.  Always.  The fact that a group came in and started<br/>\ncamping the Priest when the Champ room felt like King/Priest/Champ were all<br/>\ntheirs are simply wrong.  This would *never* fly on Fennin Ro.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on Druzzil Ro, with the Sol B population at 20 or 30, sometimes the<br/>\nKing/Priest/Champ is all one camp, but having come from Fennin, no one is<br/>\nshocked when others come in and set up camp.  Normally a King/Priest/Champ<br/>\ngroup will base itself in the King room so that is this happens they still<br/>\nget the primo camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check out this guild&#39;s use of the Play Nice policy to break the player<br/>\n&gt; made agreement that&#39;s been in effect in Sol B on our server.
