You<br/>\nshould have offered to trade :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSlightly off-topic :<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Verant has done a wonderful job with the game.  Unfortunately, if<br/>\nyou spend any amount of time reading the garbage on alt.games.everquest,<br/>\nyou&#39;d be amazed at what some people will bitch about.  Rubicite is a perfect<br/>\nexample.... for so long people have been whining about the camping, KS&#39;ing,<br/>\nand all the morons surrounding Rubicite.  People also bitch that there is no<br/>\nQUEST in Everquest (which I strongly disagree with).  Anyway, Verant goes<br/>\nin, removes Rubicite - adds new quests for class-specific armor and now<br/>\neveryone is bitching that they took rubicite away!!!  So outrageous.  Also,<br/>\nsome warrior went on this huge rant about Lambent armor - he was disgusted<br/>\nthat it was better than rubicite and crafted and that Warriors should get<br/>\nthe &quot;best&quot; armor in the game.  The funny thing is that I _never_ hear bards<br/>\nbitching that it isn&#39;t fair that we don&#39;t have weapons equivalent to<br/>\nBladestorm, Langseaxe of the Wolves, Soul Leech, etc, etc.  I just don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand some of these people.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, October 12, 1999 2:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Speed of a bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Innorruk server I saw someone in black mail(?) maybe plate <br/>\n&gt; (blackened)<br/>\n&gt; and he was moving pretty fast so I kicked in selo&#39;s and my <br/>\n&gt; Mistmoore drum...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OMG!! Can&#39;t catch him??? wtf???  He stops by Kith tunnel and <br/>\n&gt; I catch up and<br/>\n&gt; can see his name &quot;Harmany&quot; and I do a /w on him and...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; YIKES!  He&#39;s a bard and a GM! (or maybe Guide) But WOO HOO!! <br/>\n&gt; We have a GM<br/>\n&gt; Bard!  So, I say Hi and stuff and chat.  I hope it helps us <br/>\n&gt; get some points<br/>\n&gt; across.  TBH, I think Verant does listen and they do react <br/>\n&gt; but they set<br/>\n&gt; their own priority and have their own vision.  I think they got very<br/>\n&gt; surprized at how their &#39;community&#39; evolved so fast and are <br/>\n&gt; finally coming to<br/>\n&gt; grips with things - new zones, changing stuff that&#39;s over <br/>\n&gt; camped, dealing<br/>\n&gt; with KS&#39;ers, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 32th song<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; p.s. the reason I have not been posting much:<br/>\n&gt; 10-01-99 - welcome to level 30<br/>\n&gt; 10-04-99 - welcome to level 31<br/>\n&gt; 10-06-99 - welcome back to level 30 <br/>\n&gt; 10-07-99 - welcome back to level 31<br/>\n&gt; 10-08-99 - welcome back to level 30 <br/>\n&gt; 10-09-99 -- welcome back to level 31<br/>\n&gt; 10-11-99 - welcome to level 32 - WooHoo!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom:\tCYR, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSent:\tFriday, October 08, 1999 10:13 AM<br/>\n&gt; \t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Speed of a bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom: &quot;CYR, Thierry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tThe other day when i was hunting in Steamfont a <br/>\n&gt; Guide showed<br/>\n&gt; up and was just<br/>\n&gt; \t\tstanding there next to us.
