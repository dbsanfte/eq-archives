Actually, I hate the whole NO","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1519960851\">I agree in one sense Galtin (welcome back by the way ;-) because I hate the<br/>\nfact that quest items are no drop, it is irritating. Actually, I hate the<br/>\nwhole NO DROP thing altogether and wish there was a better way to handle the<br/>\nissues it was stuck in against, but that is neither here nor there I<br/>\nsuppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer creates a Warrior, raises him to level 3, Kills as many koalindl fish<br/>\nas he can before he is killed (by Mr. Paladin), comes back, loots<br/>\ncorpse...runs out into a remote area somewhere (how about a rooftop in<br/>\nFreeport) drops the items, logs out, logs back in immediately with his main<br/>\ncharacter who was logged out in the same secret place, picks up the<br/>\nitems...ta da!<br/>\n<br/>\nHence the absurd need for NO DROP.  Also NO TRADE can be circumvented<br/>\nwithout NO DROP in place by just dropping an item at the feet of another<br/>\nplayer rather than using the trade window - requires more trust for a big<br/>\ntransaction, but makes NO TRADE useless without NO DROP.  Some items are<br/>\ncurrently NO DROP but tradable, like some of the keys you pick up...try to<br/>\ndrop one on the ground...no dice...but you can put it in the bank, sell it<br/>\nto a merchant or give it to another player. I am thinking in specific of<br/>\nkeys I have picked up in Unrest although I am sure there are others as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wandered around with a weight 2 bloody ogre head in my backpack for 3<br/>\nweeks hoping to catch Zarchoomi and finally gave up and destroyed the head.<br/>\nI feel the NO DROP policy hurts players who play the game fairly just to<br/>\nforce the people who do not play fairly to play by the &quot;rules&quot;.  Sigh, I<br/>\nfeel I&#39;m getting closer and closer to a KABONG so I&#39;d better shut up.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 14, 1999 3:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Nerfing quest components (OT) (was<br/>\n&gt; alt.games.everquest)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think changing quest items to NO DROP is a step in the <br/>\n&gt; right direction.<br/>\n&gt; Case in point is the Exotic Drinks/Glowing Stein quest.  When <br/>\n&gt; the quest was<br/>\n&gt; finally fixed a couple months back, people were creating 1st <br/>\n&gt; level mule<br/>\n&gt; characters to kill the koalindl fish at the Temple of Life in <br/>\n&gt; Qeynos.  This<br/>\n&gt; allowed them to avoid the major faction hit with their main <br/>\n&gt; character.  The<br/>\n&gt; mule character then gave the fish to the main character ( I <br/>\n&gt; admit I did this<br/>\n&gt; but only because my faction got screwed earlier by trying to <br/>\n&gt; complete the<br/>\n&gt; quest legitimately before it got fixed).  To complete the <br/>\n&gt; quest now, the<br/>\n&gt; same person has to acquire all the quest components.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the best way Verant could handle this is to make <br/>\n&gt; quest components NO<br/>\n&gt; TRADE and keep magic items NO DROP.  That way, you could put quest<br/>\n&gt; components in the bank until you got them all and eliminates <br/>\n&gt; using mule<br/>\n&gt; characters to collect the items.  This would also allow <br/>\n&gt; Verant to start<br/>\n&gt; giving better rewards for quests because it ensures that the player<br/>\n&gt; completes all the necessary steps and earn the reward.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another thing, although not specifically bard related <br/>\n&gt; except in that bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably do more quests than anyone else simply because <br/>\n&gt; they can, is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; constant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I <br/>\n&gt; went to the bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 <br/>\n&gt; containers from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I <br/>\n&gt; would have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does <br/>\n&gt; Verant think the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solution to everything is to make an item no drop.  <br/>\n&gt; Bizzarely the Bozemite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the <br/>\n&gt; use for is now No<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Drop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires <br/>\n&gt; considerable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; faction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go <br/>\n&gt; figure.  Why should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across <br/>\n&gt; Norrath to get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put <br/>\n&gt; it in the bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness <br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weigh<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10 lbs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; \tKitasi the questly nerfed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program <br/>\n&gt; WIN $100 to Amazon.com!
