No association to bards, that I know of.  Unless you can get into Ogre town, and live, give it to a newbie Ogre, and let him get a bit of XP from it.  Oh, and I don&#39;t see this quest listed on any of the spoiler sites, but, when I once played an Ogre Shadow Knight, I do remember being given the quest.
