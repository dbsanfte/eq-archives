In an excerpt<br/>\n&gt;from the test server:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Solution:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<br/>\n&gt;suicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<br/>\n&gt;adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we<br/>\n&gt;do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key<br/>\n&gt;spawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will <br/>\n&gt;immediately<br/>\n&gt;break Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will not be affected.  While<br/>\n&gt;this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet,<br/>\n&gt;it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that<br/>\n&gt;charming an NPC does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We would appreciate diligent testing of this change, to insure that no<br/>\n&gt;unforeseen problems have been caused by it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-The EverQuest Team<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So now they are saying they would appreciate diligent testing of a change?<br/>\n&gt;Wtf?  Who is the customer and who is the service provider here?  I guess<br/>\n&gt;this tells us everything we need to know about Verant test procedure.  <br/>\n&gt;Throw<br/>\n&gt;the code out on the test server and hope some player puts it to task.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt;\tmore disillusioned than ever<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
