There is some concern<br/>\nfloating about that a minimum skill of 100 in forage is required to get the<br/>\nnew unique items people are finding in the different zones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a bit of good news, I foraged an &quot;ash root&quot; last night (I think it<br/>\nwas in Kithcor) and later foraged a normal &quot;root&quot; in HighKeep.  They were<br/>\ndefinitely separate items and did not stack with one another (much like the<br/>\nold berries and fruit that have been around and have the same graphic).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other bards on this list found any of the unique new forage items yet<br/>\ntoo?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - my forage is maxed at the cap, 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Faras<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
