Let your imagination a<br/>\n&gt; bit loose and consider that perhaps someday Verant will let us feed in a<br/>\n&gt; MIDI or .wav file that then goes to the listeners.  The bandwidth needed<br/>\n&gt; for a MIDI might even be within reason.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I further assume that you simply supply the words for all those nearby<br/>\n&gt; to read.  Is there a way to do that in reasonable quantity without having<br/>\n&gt; to type them as you go?  Do you perhaps set up chunks of the words as<br/>\n&gt; command macros, then touch those off one at a time in order?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Bob/Thrush of Freeport on Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for the perfect gift for a friend?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell them about ONElist&#39;s 115,000 free e-mail communities! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
