If I&#39;d known this<br/>\nwas what you were posting about earlier I wouldn&#39;t have replied to your<br/>\nmessage at all on whineplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry my friend but Duping bugs, corpse loss bugs, item poofing bugs etc<br/>\ntake FAR more priority, to me, than fixing a song that I have learned to do<br/>\nwithout.  I&#39;d FAR rather not be able to mez than to lose all my hard earned<br/>\nitems to a corpse poofing bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nComplaining about reality is one thing but they HAVE had some pretty major<br/>\nbugs pop up over the past couple weeks that really do take priority over<br/>\nfixing things like a secondary resist on our songs.  I&#39;m not saying our<br/>\nsongs aren&#39;t important to me, far from it, but I really think we need to<br/>\nkeep things in perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath since Beta 2<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Stephen E.
