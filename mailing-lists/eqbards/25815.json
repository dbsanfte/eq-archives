Most people don&#39;t want to put that much effort into gameplay and I think that is why you don&#39;t have a lot of high level bards.  Personally I think VI should code in an extended notes ability for bards above say, level 55, but that&#39;s just me P<br/>\nI can twist four songs (barring missed notes) but I find it a lot of work over the course of an entire evening -- I prefer to twist three as I find more opportunity to at least read the group and guild chat.  On raids I have missed important drops because I was twisitng and not watching for loot that way ... Five songs?  If you do the math, you&#39;ll see that this doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>\nAmplification and charm last long enough to extend your twists but those are special songs and I probably wouldn&#39;t use them together.<br/>\nBoH does a free song for you, so does some singing steel.  Epic procs are also sometimes confused with songs.  Sounds to me like a bard who was marketing himself to a group. <br/>\n  Katye and Brandon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:landmax13@...\">landmax13@...</a>&gt; wrote: OK,<br/>\n<br/>\nSitting around with some RL friends who play everquest, and suddenly one of <br/>\nthem says &quot;by the way, your bard sucks now.&quot;  &quot;Eh?&quot; I say.  &quot;Yeah, we <br/>\nplayed with a bard the other night, 58, who kept 4 songs going most of the <br/>\nfight and said when things get tough he twists in a fifth.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this BS?  Or do i really suck.  When I have a good connection and low <br/>\nlag I keep four going with few drops...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one song per hotkey, and I hit 1122334411223344...<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something here?  Should I set up hotkeys so that one casts two <br/>\nsongs with appropriate delays?  I&#39;ve never like that idea because it gives <br/>\nme less flexibility... but now I begin to wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is this bs...<br/>\n<br/>\nVery curious to hear what y&#39;all have to say<br/>\n<br/>\nRaub Zaumbie<br/>\n38 :-) E.
