I<br/>\n&gt;  heard the rumor of the quest connected to him and Mistmoore, I never<br/>\n&gt;  followed up on it.  He has since been removed from the game.  I&#39;ve not<br/>\n&gt;  seen him since I was in my L30s.  Either he got really, really rare<br/>\n&gt;  and no one has cleaned the camp long enough or he&#39;s poofed.
