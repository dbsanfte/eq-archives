Each<br/>\nof them gets the same percentage of exp needed for their level.  That means<br/>\nthat if the mob gives the level 29 player 2% of the total exp needed to<br/>\ngain level 30.  It will also give the level 20 player 2% of the exp that he<br/>\nor she needs to gain level 21. (I&#39;m talking total exp for the level not<br/>\nwhat you still need left to make the next level)<br/>\nEvery time I go out adventuring.  No matter what group I am in and what the<br/>\nlevels are.  If I gain a bubbel of exp for say an hour of play.  Everyone<br/>\nelse in the group  appears to have also gained one bubbel of exp.<br/>\nReguardless of race or class.  Now I am sure there are probably penalties<br/>\nto some classes that could cause this to be inaccurate.  However, they have<br/>\nnever been very noticible.<br/>\nI believe Verant designed the exp system so that if say a group of 6<br/>\nplayers reguardless of class and race always grouped and Never adventured<br/>\nwith out all the other members of the group.  They would all level FAIRLY<br/>\nbut not exactly all the way to level 50.  The same principle can be applied<br/>\nwhen dealing with a mixed group.  Eveeryone is going to level about the<br/>\nsame rate.<br/>\nThe reason it appears as though lower level people don&#39;t get as much exp is<br/>\nthat the higher level players require a larger percentage of exp to get<br/>\nthem to the next level.  So if the group is killing blue things.  The<br/>\nhighest level person will suck up more exp because the system is leveling<br/>\nthem roughly the same rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a not about this post.  I know that there are rumors from some guides<br/>\nand beta testers as well as other players that say certain mobs give<br/>\ncertain classes more exp.  As well as the one that says some classes have<br/>\nmore penalties than others depending on the zone they are in.  Thats why in<br/>\nmy above comments I used the words fairly and roughly.  I&#39;m not looking for<br/>\nflames, Just though you might care to hear the point of view from soneone<br/>\nwho has plaied with groups well above me and well below me for a total of<br/>\n68 levels worth of characters.  Ones almost 30, most in their teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nThe Crimson Knights<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; My first night as level 20 and I went<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to HighHold Keep.  Got into a group with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; others ranging to 27 with me the lowest<br/>\n&gt;&gt; most of the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but with a group of people that high up in level<br/>\n&gt;(up to 7 above you), isn&#39;t it true that you&#39;d get very little to no<br/>\n&gt;experience from the fights? I remember when I was level 5 and my friend was<br/>\n&gt;level 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting experience when we were<br/>\n&gt;grouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that even when the<br/>\n&gt;levels are closer, the people with the higher levels get more experience<br/>\n&gt;than the lower levels regardless of who does the most damage. Of course if<br/>\n&gt;you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I was just curious<br/>\n&gt;if you got any experience from it.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
