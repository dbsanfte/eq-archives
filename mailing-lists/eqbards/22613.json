And I just let clarity keep singing at<br/>\nend of macro in case I forget to restart the macro or in case I go afk -<br/>\nclarity keeps going which I am more concerned about during downtime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I don&#39;t like long macros - once one starts, it must finish<br/>\nbefore you can sing a different song.  Maybe we should ask for an interrupt<br/>\ncommand like /stopmacro to be able to stop a longer twist to get at the song<br/>\nyou really need NOW(i.e., mob pops and starts beating on medding cleric -<br/>\nyou want to charm it off them and can&#39;t since you just started the downtime<br/>\nmacro).  So, my normal macros during a fight are:<br/>\n<br/>\n/pause 2, /stopsong<br/>\n/cast &lt;song you want&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI then time it(based on current lag) to hit next macro for the next song<br/>\nwhich stops the current song and starts the next.  It saves you one<br/>\nkeystroke as you don&#39;t have to stop any songs if you create a similar macro<br/>\nfor each slot.  So in a normal fight, I hit half as many hotkeys now and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t get the &quot;you have not recovered&quot; message anymore since I no longer can<br/>\njump the gun on starting the next song after I stopped the previous.  Also,<br/>\nif you miss a note, you don&#39;t have to wait to restart the macro as there is<br/>\nno pause after song casting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, for that where to go in 20&#39;s question - definitely Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>\nIt will take you to charm at 27 and beyond.  My favorite charm target there<br/>\n- Sabertooth Grimalkin, but you will test it out for yourself one day....<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two cents,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I just reread this and while I understand it, it is confusing with all<br/>\nthe stops/nexts/etc.  Sorry.  Hope it helps.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
