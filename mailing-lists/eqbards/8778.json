Its damage ratio is <br/>\njust a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t have any stat <br/>\nincreases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon be found?  It <br/>\nlooks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the only one I&#39;ve <br/>\never seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he got it...so any <br/>\nhelp would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same <br/>\ngraphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRuldaas Riverdance</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
