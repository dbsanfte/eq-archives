Dots won&#39;t make you lose xp<br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n&gt; (Both PC and NPC dots, from what I&#39;ve seen.)  However, if the dot kills<br/>\nthem, the<br/>\n&gt; duel will be &quot;canceled by their untimely death&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As to the fear question:  You won&#39;t get an answer out of me on that one,<br/>\nbut...try it<br/>\n&gt; out.. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Lohengrin, 45th bard of Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tyria Sarkin, L35 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just to let you all know, my RL best friend has a 36 Mage and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I dueled him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; once for fun. You can imagine how pissed off I was when I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lost exp after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fight. Why? You ask.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, his pet killed me, causing me to die from a NPC, which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same as dieing via a normal mob. The duel was void and I lost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1/2 bub exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (this was back at level 29 or so, he was 31). So, I must stress, NEVER<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fight a mage in a duel because if you die you can kiss<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goodbye to your exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (if the pet gets the last hit and kills you).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; and reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ========================================================================<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; To UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; and reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n&gt; ======================================================================== </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
