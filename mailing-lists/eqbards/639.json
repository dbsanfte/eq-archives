Since it was put up on that site, I have received some good feeback, including corrections as well as some minor additions.  I&#39;m up to v 1.6 that I will be sending it in Monday for posting.  If anyone has any information not in there already, I&#39;d appreciate if you could drop me a line.<br/>\n    Looking through some of the archives, I&#39;ve noticed that there is another Bard song document?  Can someone forward me a copy?  I&#39;d like to merge that information into what I have already (and give credit where it&#39;s due, of course).<br/>\n    Lastly, there does seem to be two Bards mailing lists on onelist.com.  I started EQ_Bards about a day before eqbards was born, but it looks like this list get&#39;s more discussion.  I think that having two lists is rudundant and not very useful so I&#39;m going to shut down EQ_Bards over the next two weeks and try and migrate everyone over to this list.  BTW, who is the originator of this list?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Alex<br/>\naka: Goatnatos, lvl 16 Bard, Povar Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
