I know you cnnot use any of the music skills<br/>\nunless you train that first point and get the &quot;You have learned the basics<br/>\nof XXX&quot; message.

I&#39;ve read time and again that I should<br/>\nventure to Arena or a PvP area, start Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord and leave<br/>\nit running indefinitely to increase my skill.  However, I have not been<br/>\nsuccessful in getting that to work.  Initially I went to Arena in Rathe Mts.<br/>\nand tried this.  I had read that you only needed to be in the area, not<br/>\nactually in the PvP area itself, so I equipped my Minotaur Horn, fired up,<br/>\nfired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, DDD<br/>\nand went to a restaurant for dinner.  Before I left I noticed that the<br/>\n&quot;plays horn&quot; graphic wasn&#39;t running, but didn&#39;t think much about it.  Got<br/>\nback from dinner to find zero skill increase.  Hmm..  Ok, perhaps I *do*<br/>\nhave to be in the PvP area, so I tried that.  Same results.  Ok, maybe it&#39;s<br/>\nthe Minotaur Horn - maybe it&#39;s the problem.  So the next time I was in the<br/>\nbank and thought about it, I traded out my Minotaur Horn (tired of the bag<br/>\nin my wrist anyhow) for a standard store-bought horn.  Last night I tried<br/>\npracticing this song in the PvP area of Freeport and it again wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nactually play.  Well now I have gone to Kelethin and bought Screech and am<br/>\ncompletely unable to start the song due to my brass skill.  I tried to start<br/>\nScreech (literally) about 300 times last night with and without the horn<br/>\nequipped and had *one* success - not too useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there is not a mob within range of my song, what I get is DDD starts, I<br/>\nbriefly get some orange flares from my hands and then it&#39;s just me standing<br/>\nthere.  No playing horn graphic, no orange flares, nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone comment on this and/or offer a solution?  I *need* this song, but<br/>\nif Verant has changed it so that the only way for me to increase my Brass<br/>\nskill is to fight experience-giving mobs with it, I&#39;m screwed.  I *WILL* die<br/>\ntrying to get DDD and/or Screech fired up against a blue mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 26th on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
