They know how their spells work and they also know firsthand<br/>\nthat if their group mates get stupid and attack mezzed mobs then the<br/>\nenchanter has a good chance of dying.  If they have to resort to being bossy<br/>\nto get the point across, then IMO its justified due to self-preservation.  I<br/>\ndo the same thing when I am in crowd control mode.  Back when Lullaby was<br/>\nuseful, I gave myself headaches trying to get everyone to attack the same<br/>\nmob.  I&#39;ve lost count of the times I died because group mates attacked mobs<br/>\nI was putting to sleep.  Hopefully, its a problem I will soon have to start<br/>\nfacing again:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

They seem to lean towards the bossy<br/>\nside.  One errant swing at a mezzed mob and you rapidly get the &quot;Everyone<br/>\nneeds to /assist or this will not work&quot; message.  Two swings seems to be the<br/>\ntirade threshhold. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:solane@...\">solane@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:solane@...\">solane@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 29, 2000 1:41 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] bards as group leaders (was: grouping)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This kind of brings me to another general question I wanted to throw<br/>\n </span></blockquote>out to the list:  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; How often do you bards take the role of group leader?  I think that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>our<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; broad knowledge of class abilities and our support playing style tends<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; make us excellent leaders and I often find people want ME to lead the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>group,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am almost never the one originally inviting or leading, because I hate<br/>\nbeing leader.  Call me lazy or whatever, but I would really rather have<br/>\nsomeone else do it, assuming there is a competent person who is willing. <br/>\nHowever, my groups tend not to see it this way.  No matter how much I try<br/>\nto take the back seat, if the original &quot;leader&quot; ever leaves, 10:1 they<br/>\nall decide that I will be the new leader, no and&#39;s, if&#39;s, or but&#39;s about<br/>\nit.  I don&#39;t claim to be very knowledgeable, or a great leader (though I<br/>\n*do* tend to take charge in a power vacuum, ask my guild :P), so I can<br/>\nonly think of one reason groups seem to want me to lead--I know when to<br/>\nleave well enough alone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a problem, I will happily fix it and I will gladly resolve<br/>\nany conflicts or whatnot in a diplomatic way, but if there isn&#39;t a<br/>\nproblem and the group is running great, I keep my mouth shut and let<br/>\neveryone have fun.  No one especially likes other people telling them<br/>\nwhat to do, and when people are comfortable doing their jobs, the whole<br/>\ngroup has a better time.  Not that I have not asked people to change<br/>\ntactics in some cases, or even kicked out threats to the group in others,<br/>\nbut I think most people like a leader who is in that in-between<br/>\narea--neither bossy and overbearing nor too timid if changes need to be<br/>\nmade.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\nGuildmistress, Hearts of Valor<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heartsofvalor.com\">http://www.heartsofvalor.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVisit Swiftarrow&#39;s Song at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freespeech.org/karisma\">http://www.freespeech.org/karisma</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
