I was doing songs<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; waiting for a friend so I was there a bit.. This guy asked no less than 20<br/>\n&gt; people and was there before I got there and after I left. The worst part<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; that you could watch as he actually got a lot of stuff from people. (You<br/>\n&gt; could see him put it on) I know people like to be nice, as do I, but<br/>\nwhat&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the point of this person playing the game? (By the way, he was level 2 and<br/>\n&gt; definitely not a &quot;restarted&quot; character)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Upgraded that whip & don&#39;t feel like dealing with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the hassle of selling it?  Go give it to a beetle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the commons, then invis & watch he glee of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; newbie who finds it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does that actually work? You can give an item to a monster and if they get<br/>\n&gt; killed, it&#39;s still on the body to recover? If so that&#39;s a completely<br/>\n&gt; fantastic idea and I&#39;ll start doing that immediately with all the rusty<br/>\n&gt; stuff I find and maybe the occasional tidbit. Thank you!!!! (No sarcasm<br/>\n&gt; what-so-ever, this is a really great idea!) By the way, if this actually<br/>\n&gt; does work - is there any kind of time limit as to how long it&#39;ll stay with<br/>\n&gt; the monster?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Weekly drawing is held each Friday.
