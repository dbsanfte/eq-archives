First of all, I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m a 31<br/>\nyear old woman and I&#39;ve been playing EQ for<br/>\nnearly 2 1/2 years, ever since the original EQ<br/>\nbox with Firiona Vie beconed me into a world a<br/>\nlot like &#39;Dungeons & Dragons&#39; but without all the<br/>\npaperwork or trouble of looking for people to<br/>\nplay with. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Gasp!! I&#39;m a woman & I&#39;m interested in &quot;D&D&quot;<br/>\ntype games... whoa, wait a minute... my main is<br/>\nalso a warrior... I bet this guy would think this<br/>\nsays something about MY sexuality. Maybe I<br/>\nsecretly want to be a man... lol... I think<br/>\nnot!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m one of those whacked out people who<br/>\nactually met my significant other while playing<br/>\nEQ!!!! We have been in a serious relationship for<br/>\na year and a half now and have even lived<br/>\ntogether for over a year. I honestly believe we<br/>\nhave a healthy relationship and we plan to marry<br/>\nthis fall.<br/>\n <br/>\nI do admit that when I first started playing this<br/>\ngame the social aspect of the game was very<br/>\nappealing, at the time I was working over 60<br/>\nhours a week and didn&#39;t have a very active social<br/>\nlife, but I definately wasn&#39;t origionally drawn<br/>\nto the game for the social aspect. I was drawn to<br/>\nthe fantasy role-playing (laughs now after<br/>\nplaying for so long) aspect of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as perverts are concerned, I&#39;ve met quite<br/>\na few myself, but over the years I&#39;ve found that<br/>\nthey are widely attracted to the more &#39;vocal&#39; or<br/>\nboisterous female characters. I was a flirt<br/>\nmyself for a while until it started becoming a<br/>\nnuisance... guys wanting my email or to set up a<br/>\nchat room, some even requesting my phone<br/>\nnumber!!! I just wanted to portray my character<br/>\n(origionally) as a rough & tumble flirty warrior<br/>\nwoman - at the time, I was watching a lot of<br/>\nHercules & Xena episodes, lol! It didn&#39;t pay off.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally this game isn&#39;t much of a role-playing<br/>\ngame and it seems that people make more friends<br/>\nand are bothered less if you just act yourself<br/>\nand aren&#39;t too flashy in the way you act. The<br/>\nmajority of people I group with these days don&#39;t<br/>\neven really chat much with each other. Sometimes<br/>\nthey&#39;ll talk about nice gear or zones they&#39;d like<br/>\nto explore, with occaisional people mentioning<br/>\nthey need to leave to go to work or their time<br/>\nzones... but theres really not any real<br/>\ncommunication going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think I&#39;ve rambled on long enough and<br/>\nactually lost my whole point of this long and<br/>\nboring post! ROFL!! But the main thing is, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot a 20 - 24 year old man looking for cyber-sex<br/>\nor game power! If I was, I&#39;d probably be level 60<br/>\nalready and fully outfitted in uber gear...lol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nKinrea Keres 52nd Teir&#39;dal Champion <br/>\nDanallis Stormcaller 40th Half Elven Druid <br/>\nSinarya L&#39;achesis 29th Teir&#39;dal Necromancer <br/>\nLereny 16th Half Elven Bard <br/>\nPippina 7th Vah Shir Beastlord <br/>\n<br/>\nSaryrn Server<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGot something to say?
