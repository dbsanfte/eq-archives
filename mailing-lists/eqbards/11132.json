Clearly, one has an hp bonus<br/>\n  and one doesnt.  AC17 on the MithBP and AC20 on the LambentBP is<br/>\n  what I&#39;m referring too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think we talked about this before.  Every 10? AGI gives you some<br/>\n  sort of AC bonus applied across all your armor?  I don&#39;t remember.<br/>\n  But if my 105 AGI drops to 99 AGI, I lose AC for sure.  I&#39;m willing<br/>\n  to bet bumping my AGI to 110 will then increase the AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, does a +15 AGI increase/bump your overall armor up enough to make<br/>\n  just +3 AC?  If it does then the MithBP is equally as good as the<br/>\n  Lambent one.  (Not to mention the added AGI makes your combat effective-<br/>\n  ness increase as well)<br/>\n  <br/>\n  If I followed all the numbers correctly, I still wouldnt wear the <br/>\n  MithBP even if it was better =)  Baby blue is for those wimpy paladins.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
