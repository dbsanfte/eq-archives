I<br/>\nwent to find the guy in W Karana who turns into a Doppelganger (Miraz or<br/>\nsomething).  I found his little band of merry men, and as I approached, they<br/>\nagroed on me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have to charm him to give him the note?<br/>\n<br/>\nDO I have to kill off all his lackey&#39;s first?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, do oyu think a group (6) of 50-54 will have any problem taking<br/>\nthem out?<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro 51(doh, raided again last night so still haven&#39;t pushed out<br/>\nthat last smidge to 52) Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  I don&#39;t know whY i am bothering to do this since I don&#39;t think I will<br/>\never be able to finish the quest since I depend on other guilds to take me<br/>\non dragon raids, thus I will never get the components...  Guess I can say I<br/>\nam half done my Epic Quest :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
