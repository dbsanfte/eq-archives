Yeah, the one that determines who<br/>\ngets the kill.  The person who does the most damage between<br/>\nwhen the creature is uncharmed and when it dies gets the kill.<br/>\nThis has implications both for anti-kill stealing and kill<br/>\nstealing.  A friend remarked that a bard was kill-stealing<br/>\nfrom his group earlier.  Now we know how.<br/>\n<br/>\nPixie Strike does not have a memory blur effect I&#39;d read about<br/>\nsomewhere.  When the mob becomes unmesmerized, it makes a<br/>\nbeeline straight for you, just like with Lullaby.  It could be<br/>\nthat everyone except the bard is removed from the hate list,<br/>\nbut you will not be able to use this song to get an annoying<br/>\ngreen mob to leave you alone.  You still need an enchanter for<br/>\nthat.  It is single target only, so if you need to heal up in<br/>\nthe middle of a one-on-one fight, weave Strike and Hymn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrag:  I found a mob that I can (barely) solo at L27 (28 now),<br/>\ngives good experience, and great loot.  I made about 100pp in<br/>\njust under two hours this morning soloing, half of which was<br/>\nrunning back and forth from town overloaded with loot because<br/>\nI can carry only 8 pounds before I&#39;m encumbered. :-P<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
