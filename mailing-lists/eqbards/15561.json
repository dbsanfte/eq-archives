I<br/>\nasked how do we get all these frogs when there are 80+ people in the zone?<br/>\nI was told you are pretty damn deep in Lower Guk. Then our enchanter went<br/>\nafk or LD during a pull or was it the room spawn. We started getting more<br/>\nand more froggies beating on him. I paniced and feared them off.  Heh, well,<br/>\nits been a while since I&#39;d seen quite so many froggies all at once (when<br/>\nthey came back with a bunch of friends.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, playing AE songs in dungeons?  I guess it depends on: where you are in<br/>\nwhich dungeon and what song.  Fearing frogs in the King room is still a<br/>\n&quot;no-no!&quot;  When there are 6 to 8 dogs frenzied at the zone in Sol B, chain<br/>\none and fear the rest of them off (heh, they can get more friend - all of<br/>\nthem are already there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 48 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...(and when I un-camp - somehow I got this feeling I<br/>\nam really gonna Hate the Plane.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 29, 2000 2:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Is it safe to sing AE songs in dungeons now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With overcrowding a problem on almost every server, I&#39;m wondering if it is<br/>\n&gt; now safe to add these songs back to our playlist. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
