I dont know what you are spending you<br/>\nmoney on but I had an entire suit of leather by 7th level. I guess its how<br/>\nyou play. You get in a hurry and wanna kill everythig in site, waste time<br/>\nscrewing around ect. Patience is key. Get your armor. Get prepared before<br/>\nyou start &quot;adventuring&quot;. The ill prepared seems to always die. Ya it gets<br/>\nmundane. Sometime you have to kill stuff that doesnt give you exp. But its<br/>\neasy to make 5 plat in a night or more killing bugs, spiders and skels. The<br/>\narmor...not that patchwork garbage will pay you back 10 fold. If you make it<br/>\nfine no prob. But I did not make squat, wouldnt buy it or wear it. Im 20ish<br/>\nlevel now in what 3 weeks? and no im not 24 7 player. Just being prepared is<br/>\nthe key and knowing the bard. The patchwork is a waste of money and skill<br/>\npoints i will always say :-) Play smart Play Prepared. That scarab will tear<br/>\nyou up in patchwork. In leather you will solo it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rodney Morris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rodmorris@...\">rodmorris@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, May 04, 1999 7:48 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Level 9 - Leather Armor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Rodney Morris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rodmorris@...\">rodmorris@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greg wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am the most anti-patchwork armor guy there.

Patchwork, going for<br/>\n&gt;about 2pp per piece, or less with quantity, is within reach of the<br/>\n&gt;low level players.<br/>\n&gt;The fact that several pieces of armour are not available in patchwork<br/>\n&gt;means you should do both IMHO.  Buy the patchwork (or make it) at a<br/>\n&gt;lower level, and upgrade as you can affort it, purchasing those<br/>\n&gt;pieces that aren&#39;t available as patchwork first.  I see no point<br/>\n&gt;in shelling out for a leather tunic when you have a patchwork tunic,<br/>\n&gt;but no shoulder pads or face mask.  Sure, a tunic has higher AC, but<br/>\n&gt;I think that a patchwork tunic plus another piece of leather (or two)<br/>\n&gt;would have higher AC than the leather tunic alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Patchwork...blah. Waste of skill points and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; money.<br/>\n&gt;Again, I disagree.  Studded and reinforced, well, that&#39;s another<br/>\n&gt;discussion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mully<br/>\n&gt;Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Get &quot;in synch!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;With the ONElist Shared Calendar Feature.
