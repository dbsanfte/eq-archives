Also remember that <br/>\nevery time he sings a song, he&#39;s getting area-effect aggro, so multiply <br/>\nthat times five, and you&#39;re probably seeing a bard who abuses the <br/>\nhigh-level clerics in his guild.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have one song per hotkey, and I hit 1122334411223344...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re doing just fine.
