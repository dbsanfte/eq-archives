Still I can&#39;t figure out why people think running naked<br/>\naccross the world to you body is more fun than regaining exp you had fun<br/>\ngetting the first time just so you don&#39;t get set back in some bizarre got to<br/>\nget to the next level plan.  What&#39;s up with that?  Does anyone understand<br/>\nthat at all and can explain it logically?  I mean you had fun getting those<br/>\nxp the first time.  You get to get them all over again and have fun again?<br/>\nUnless you let thsi get out of control by not taking unreasonable risks,<br/>\nwait I thought that was the whole point of a death penalty?, there shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe a problem.  Unless of course playing isn&#39;t fun, only going up levels is<br/>\nfun.  Of course at that point running naked to get your corpse still isn&#39;t<br/>\nfun because while you are doing that you aren&#39;t going up levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 5:12 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 30 Sep 1999, Bard wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;:Also, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There does?
