The<br/>\n&gt; real danger is when they warp a long distance away, and<br/>\n&gt; then never come back.  Never, that is, until you happen to<br/>\n&gt; walk near him later, and he comes running with his 4 giant<br/>\n&gt; friends and the little cyclops who wants to be part of the<br/>\n&gt; group.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the area we were fighting (near the entrance pass with the<br/>\nstone) there seems to be one spot where the warp to - a good<br/>\ndeal further South near the lizard camp.  Once I figured this<br/>\nout, it was pretty easy to go and retrieve the giants that did<br/>\nwarp away.  There&#39;s also a pathing bug near the pass.  Unless<br/>\nyou pull a giant across a ridge there against the wall, it<br/>\nwill head for this warp spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the up side, this meant if we got in trouble in a fight,<br/>\nfear would be much more effective.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Sometimes there&#39;s too MANY hill giants.  When you&#39;re in<br/>\n&gt; a group, one hill giant is tasty, two makes them see how<br/>\n&gt; powerful you are as a bard.  Three means run to the zone.<br/>\n&gt; Four means run to the zone and try and take a screen cap.  <br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The group I was with could handle a hill giant without me.  If<br/>\nwe got three, I&#39;d tell them to take one, then I&#39;d pull the<br/>\nother two aside to let them get better aquainted.  :-)  We<br/>\nnever got four.  There were several groups there fighting<br/>\n(though I suspect we were doing the most killing since with<br/>\ncharm you have zero downtime).  We pulled a couple giants off<br/>\nthem if they got too much, so I think they would&#39;ve done the<br/>\nsame if we got four.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
