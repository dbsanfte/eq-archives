Yes, this could be exceptionally powerful, what with<br/>\ntwisting and all, but this could easily be limited to only effect the &quot;top&quot;<br/>\nbard song in the spell list of the lead singer, whilst the &quot;recovery&quot; period<br/>\nof stopping the song would be such that twisting wouldn&#39;t be possible if you<br/>\nwere a cantata player.<br/>\nExample: A group composed of 1 warrior and 2 bards stops to rest. Bard 1<br/>\nbegins to sing Hymn, only to be joined in song by bard 2 with Cinda&#39;s<br/>\nCantata - boosting regeneration by their now intensity music (by the SWAG<br/>\nformula above that would be a +69%).<br/>\nFull stacking numbers would be:<br/>\nn    +%<br/>\n---    -----<br/>\n1    69<br/>\n2    74<br/>\n3    80<br/>\n4    88<br/>\n5    100<br/>\nAnyhow, I have no idea how to make a formal suggestion that wouldn&#39;t be lost<br/>\nin /feedback, but none the less, here&#39;s mine. Also, this would be a<br/>\nbeautiful deeply involved story line &quot;quest&quot; song as we&#39;re currently lacking<br/>\nanything to do once we get our lambent.<br/>\n<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Tork@Nameless&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
