I could easly make <br/>\n100 plat every 2 nights at 6th level :)  I used this money to finance the <br/>\nsmith in my guild, looking back I should have done the smithing as the <br/>\nperson deleted the character later on, grrrrrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;* What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I am a twink?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This will be hard to do, especially on a established server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;* Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this character.
