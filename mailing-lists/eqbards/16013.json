When I travel in EQ and see somewhere<br/>\nfor the first time, I mostly think &quot;Oooooooh&quot;.  When I travel in AC<br/>\nand see somewhere for the first time I mostly think &quot;Oh&quot;.  Hopefully<br/>\nthat will get the idea across ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, I enjoyed AC for giving me a large number of outdoor areas<br/>\nthat I can wander around in and fight things, without the need to camp<br/>\nspawns and fight/argue with the idiots who spoiled my EQ fun<br/>\nyesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, I&#39;ve just cancelled my AC subscription because I had<br/>\nno desire to go back and play it!!  Fickle?  Me?  Not likely ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 13 Mar 2000 07:12:40 PST, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Renee Cole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nat_ive@...\">nat_ive@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Things I liked about AC:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Totally customizable characters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-The GM staff and Turbine are not paranoid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Camping is almost not an issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-You can get experience off of anything you kill, albeit less the higher you <br/>\n&gt;go if the critter is low level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-The death penalty doesnt hurt as much as EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-The ability to solo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Things I didn&#39;t like about AC:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-The interface<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-The chat system<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-The posing for combat (got my mage killed plenty).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-The graphics<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMelaniel, Wood Elf Bard (31)<br/>\nJilanna, Barbarian Shaman (13)<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (30 retired)<br/>\n... and a host of others<br/>\nMith Marr server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
