I was talking to a higher level ranger friend of mine and he asked if<br/>\n&gt; I needed any foraged food or water.  I said I forage as well and had plenty<br/>\n&gt; thanks.  I got a kick out of his next statement which was &quot;Is there anything<br/>\n&gt; that you don&#39;t do?!?&quot;  As I said before, gotta love being a bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just explain to him that you have to push the forage button about 150<br/>\ntimes more often to get food than he does and he won&#39;t get quite so<br/>\njealous.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally with the success rate of bard&#39;s foraging I find it much<br/>\neasier to just buy milk and muffins. Plus they don&#39;t weigh as much or<br/>\ntake up as many inventory slots as the 5 varieties of foraged food.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, with my druid I&#39;m using forage but passing on the<br/>\nendless clicking required to keep sense heading maxed. I will just buy<br/>\nhim a compass when he&#39;s near a gypsy camp next. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
