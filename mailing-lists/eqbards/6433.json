No more chasing<br/>\nSoW&#39;d goblins though SolA like some Keystone Cops movie!! Annnd, Bard Nuking<br/>\nlooks like it juuuust got an upgrade, as well, Fear/chains is untouched! I<br/>\nhave edited out all parts unrelated to Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>\n<br/>\nPVP Changes:<br/>\n- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more<br/>\nviable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells<br/>\ncast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would<br/>\ndo to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a<br/>\n20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon<br/>\nthe<br/>\nm.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.<br/>\n- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.<br/>\n- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed - AoE spells will now effect<br/>\nmore monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoT Changes:<br/>\n- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell<br/>\nworks.<br/>\n- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no<br/>\nchange to how a DoT spell works.<br/>\n- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens<br/>\nevery few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.<br/>\n- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased. If the monster<br/>\nmoves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the<br/>\nDoT as it would before the patch. If the monster moves for less then 18<br/>\nseconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done<br/>\nbefore the patch. If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the<br/>\nfight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
