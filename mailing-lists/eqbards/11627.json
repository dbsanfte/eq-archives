I was always under the impression that<br/>\n&gt; lambent stones could only be acquired by killing a giant or griffon.  Never<br/>\n&gt; knew you could buy them from NPCs.  Can someone list the known locations<br/>\n&gt; where NPCs sell them?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another thing.  I was wanting a stone the other night for my last piece of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lambent.  The zone was camped and I couldn&#39;t find ONE giant, much less<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I /auc&#39;d for a stone and some jackass wanted 100pp.  I said &quot;Hey guy, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buy one from the INN in Rathe Mts., a 60 second run, for 48pp.&quot;  He called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me a liar of course, so I ran to the Inn and bought it for 48pp.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with<br/>\n&gt; the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
