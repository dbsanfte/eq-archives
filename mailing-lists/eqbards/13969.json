Because there are <br/>\na lot of high level people with nothing to do, they trickle down into <br/>\nzones that they were supposed to have outgrown.  Since they are massively <br/>\noverpowered in comparison the the MOBs in these zones, I often see them <br/>\nrunning around mowing down every MOB in sight.  This is lots of fun, I <br/>\nsuppose, for the soloing level 45-50s, but it bleeds a lot of <br/>\nexperience-giving stuff out of the zone for all the people for whom the <br/>\nzone was intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point:  I&#39;m in a group of six in West Commons fighting Dervishes <br/>\nwith my level 15 Warrior.  We&#39;ve just finished clearing and getting the <br/>\nspawn slightly staggered when a level 40 something comes in and kills the <br/>\nnext three.  I can&#39;t imagine for what reason other than sheer boredom.  <br/>\nThey have crappy loot, no exp, and do not help in any quest.  In the <br/>\nmeantime, that&#39;s three spawns we didn&#39;t get.  Because it was so <br/>\npointless, this is the most flagrant recent example, but I&#39;ve had similar <br/>\nexperiences in High Hold, High Keep, Sol A, Ro, Oasis, West and East <br/>\nCommons, ...  oh, forget it.  Suffice it to say, in every zone I&#39;ve <br/>\nplayed in over the last two months.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou leveled at about the same rate as my friends did, and after asking <br/>\nthem to come visit me in many of the zones that they told me were swell <br/>\nfor getting experience, they were universally glad that they managed to <br/>\nbeat the crowding curve.  It may have been bad when you were coming up, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s worse now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I actually agree with you, though.  The problem stems from a <br/>\nlack of stuff for high level players to do, which ought to be Verant&#39;s <br/>\nfirst priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
