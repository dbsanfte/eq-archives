Hehe, I&#39;m not planning<br/>\non upgrading any of them to PIII until I can find a game that can come close<br/>\nto stressing the GeForce + PII 450 combination.  At that point, it will be<br/>\ntime to go for the latest PIII or PIV and grab the ultimate video card<br/>\navailable at that time.  That way, I&#39;ll at least buy myself a year or two<br/>\nwithout really needing to upgrade all 5 computers again :).  For now,<br/>\nhowever, the games on the market are primarily video card bound and not CPU<br/>\nbound.  I was disappointed with the Voodoo3 and TNT2 cards, but I&#39;m<br/>\noverjoyed at the results that I&#39;ve seen with the GeForce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are running a PII computer and think you need to upgrade to a PIII to<br/>\nplay some of these new games, I&#39;d highly recommend dropping the $300 or so<br/>\n(got my GeForce for $275) on a new video card instead and buy yourself<br/>\nanother 6 to 9 months before your framerates start to go south.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are running a PIII then the cheaper TNT2 sounds like your best<br/>\nalternative until the new Voodoo4/5 series or NV15 come out.  Even then,<br/>\nwhat would be the ultimate goal?  Full particle density on a dragon raid?<br/>\nHehehe, you wouldn&#39;t be able to find the dragon in all the flashing lights!<br/>\nYou&#39;d be blind for weeks :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Your statement does not give enough information.  If you all have the same<br/>\n&gt; setup as each other (except video cards) and the systems are NOT PIII or<br/>\n&gt; Athlon then you will see tremendous improvements from the GeForce Card<br/>\n </span></blockquote>over<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the TNT2 Ultra in all areas.  Otherwise (if you did have a PIII setup or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>an<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Athlon to a much lesser extent) in many areas the TNT2 Ultra will do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>almost<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; as well as the GeForce card.   This is because the PIII SSE and the Athlon<br/>\n&gt; 3dNOW instruction sets do a lot of the work that the GeForce processor<br/>\n </span></blockquote>does<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; thus giving a &#39;diminishing returns&#39; effect to the GeForce.  There&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; improvement by upgrading (as I said before) but it&#39;s not as much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; See Tom&#39;s Hardware page for a full run-down on the differences and<br/>\n&gt; advantages of GeForce 256 DDR over Riva TNT2 Ultra.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is still a noticeable improvement of the GeForce over a TNT 2 Ultra<br/>\n&gt; but is the difference worth $300?  Not in my world but others may have a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lot<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; more money to throw around.  As I said in an earlier post:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have an older system an upgrade to the GeForce may be a good idea.<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re on a newer PIII system I would wait till the NV15 or Bitboys new<br/>\n&gt; Graphics cards come out.  Both cards are at least 4 times better than the<br/>\n&gt; GeForce and should market at about $400.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Up to the buyer:  $300 (yes I know you can get them for around $230-$260<br/>\n </span></blockquote>as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; well) now and $400 later this year?  Or stick to what works now and just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>pay<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; $400 later?  The advantages of the GeForce are great.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; an AWESOME card.  But I would recommend doing some pretty extensive<br/>\n </span></blockquote>reading<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of the GeForce (or any 2nd gen card)  before I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>run<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; out and buy it.  3rd Generation cards are just around the corner.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OH:  For the hard core Gamers:  If you get a Gig system:  Don&#39;t get one<br/>\n&gt; based on Intel&#39;s i820 or i840 chipset, get either the VIA FBS 133 chipset<br/>\n&gt; with 133 SDRAM or get a BX 440 chipset and overclock the board to 133mhz<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; use SDRAM 133.  You will get FAR better performance out of the Intel Gig<br/>\n&gt; system on those Mboards and your games (IE:  EverQuest) will run a lot<br/>\n&gt; better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
