My only other character is a Rogue so forgive<br/>\n&gt;me if my magic user references are wrong, don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt;much about them :)  When I got my heal song I took off<br/>\n&gt;after a skeleton that conned white to me. I was<br/>\n&gt;interupted alot. This had not really happened before<br/>\n&gt;at least not this much! Is Intstrument/Singing skill<br/>\n&gt;what helps prevents Bards being interupted like<br/>\n&gt;Channeling is to Magic user casting? If not what is?<br/>\n&gt;BTW I beat the skeleton but was not pretty *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You get interrupted if your opponent succesfully bashes<br/>\nyou.  Skellies, Orcs, barbarian Dervs and Bandits all<br/>\nbash, and you will find it very hard to weave songs.  Hard<br/>\nenough just keeping 1 going in those situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Third (almost done :) on getting a new song about how<br/>\n&gt;long is it level wise or skill wise before you can<br/>\n&gt;count on playing that song well? Is there such a time?<br/>\n&gt;Another thing that surprised me was that I mess up<br/>\n&gt;playing that Heal song alot more than any of the other<br/>\n&gt;songs I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Missed notes (fizzles) seem to be related to your<br/>\nskill in the skill for that song (stringed for Hymm) and<br/>\nthe level of the song.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why It&#39;s still tough for me to get Aquatic Ayre<br/>\ngoing, even if I&#39;m just singing it. my wind skill is only <br/>\n30 something and my singing is maxed for 16 (85).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lastly I noticed when I bought my Drums at level 5<br/>\n&gt;from the wood elf vendor she sold a Mandolin and Lute<br/>\n&gt;as well. Is there a difference in these two for<br/>\n&gt;playing purposes? Or are they just two options for<br/>\n&gt;string instruments?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only weight and price, apparently they were going to<br/>\nmake them subtly different, but that didn&#39;t get implemented.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Many thanks for the help and safe travels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kobias<br/>\n&gt;Lvl 6 Bard<br/>\n&gt;Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tindayen<br/>\nPovar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
