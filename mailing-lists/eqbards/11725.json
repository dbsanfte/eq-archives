I have had to <br/>\ndo the dirty work obviously, but I am able.  I hadn&#39;t much exp with Mistmore <br/>\nprior to my big adventure (still think Esprit de Corpse are using MM as <br/>\ntraining for multi-group fighting prior to plane assaults).  I now have most <br/>\nof the pieces to get most of the lambent. And friends are holding on to the <br/>\nrest of my stones.  Maybe when you see me I won&#39;t be silver anymore!<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewduer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey gang!<br/>\n&gt;   At 19, I&#39;ve managed to acquire 4 items needed for the lambent armor <br/>\n&gt;quest<br/>\n&gt;without any real help from anyone thus far, with the exception with the<br/>\n&gt;lambent stone itself.  I&#39;ll tell you this, for all you newer bards  out<br/>\n&gt;there (including me), you can get these items fairly easily...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dark Boned Bracer from Greater Dark Bone in Unrest...  found mine on a<br/>\n&gt;corpse lying at the zone as SOON as I stepped in! How convenient. Picked it<br/>\n&gt;up, turned around and left. This was at lvl 15-16ish?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Grinnenne Charm from Griffenne in W Kar? Once again, i zoned in from the<br/>\n&gt;wooden bridge, made an announcement this time, actually... Someone&#39;s like<br/>\n&gt;&quot;one charm in front of the wooden bride!&quot; Woohoo. Walked straight out on <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;path, spotted it, and grabbed it. yay! I think I was 16ish here too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Opalline Helm from Deep Water Goblin in Oasis... Hey, there are normally<br/>\n&gt;people pulling these guys and their pets to either the SRo zone or right<br/>\n&gt;there near those huts on the shore during peak hours. If you can get on and<br/>\n&gt;over there during these times, I&#39;d make an effort to do so. You know, the<br/>\n&gt;helm itself is pretty sorry to wear itself as armor, the people who are <br/>\n&gt;high<br/>\n&gt;enough to kill DWG&#39;s most likely already have something better than an ac8<br/>\n&gt;helm with no stat enhancers. I was maybe lvl 17 or so then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shin Greaves and Shin Gauntlets from Shin Ghoul Knights and Shin Knights in<br/>\n&gt;Lower Guk... (forget which drops what) People pull these mobs to zone all<br/>\n&gt;the time. The spawn rate isn&#39;t bad, and the way to do it is wait just down<br/>\n&gt;the hall from the zone into Upper. They like to fight right at the zone<br/>\n&gt;line, and if they zone, they&#39;ll turn to you. Again, once you wait a little<br/>\n&gt;while, shouts and ooc&#39;s will say _____ is on _____ at zone. Pick it up and<br/>\n&gt;go. Now the trick with Lower Guk is you have to get down there without<br/>\n&gt;getting mauled. I just made 19, so I had sonorous clouding (invis song). I<br/>\n&gt;also had NO faction hits against frogloks. When uninvis, they were dubious<br/>\n&gt;or apprehensive? forget... anyway, yay me! The other trick is trying to <br/>\n&gt;find<br/>\n&gt;it. That I&#39;ll leave up to you, cuz I couldn&#39;t even try to begin explaining<br/>\n&gt;now LOL! Btw, I think both mobs could see through invis too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Icy Greaves from Elite Goblin Guard in Permafrost Keep... Ya, another easy<br/>\n&gt;one lol! This is the one I really did need help. These guys ain&#39;t no<br/>\n&gt;cocktail party. They spawn way down in the valley with the King and<br/>\n&gt;patriarch. I was with two groups 35+ one night. They were there for the Vox<br/>\n&gt;bracer i believe. First group left, I still had no greaves. Besides, two <br/>\n&gt;ppl<br/>\n&gt;in that group wanted greaves themselves. I made a /tell to a 46 Pal to see<br/>\n&gt;if he would kill one for me so I could loot. I offered him my Runed Bone<br/>\n&gt;Fork. Ya it was pretty late. So he was camping some weight reduicing bag,<br/>\n&gt;and said he&#39;d be down in a little bit. I told him the king just spawned - <br/>\n&gt;he<br/>\n&gt;was scowling at me =P yikes! He hurried down with his two friends. From <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;point on, we were there for 4+ hrs killing everything that spawned. You <br/>\n&gt;know<br/>\n&gt;what they asked me to sing? Chant of battle!! (they asked for some dex<br/>\n&gt;songs. was the only one I had. heehee!) The paladin leaves, with just two<br/>\n&gt;fighters and this singing guy. wiz and druid actually. Hardly a balanced<br/>\n&gt;group. Needless to say, I died once. Ran back from Halas, got camo from the<br/>\n&gt;druid (didn&#39;t have my wind instrument obviously), and ran back down. I<br/>\n&gt;noticed very little exp loss, and it was a small price to pay. As it turns<br/>\n&gt;out, I got 2 FS wpns, 1h silvery war axe, and the icy greaves finally did<br/>\n&gt;drop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So these five items I&#39;ve attained at just level 19. Yesterday (sat), i went<br/>\n&gt;to the temple and got my lambent greaves and bracer. One small problem with<br/>\n&gt;lambent. It doesn&#39;t match with barbed arms and bronze boots and chest. EW!!<br/>\n&gt;I still look pretty pimp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And regarding the lambent stones... By being at the right place at the <br/>\n&gt;right<br/>\n&gt;time, I&#39;ve received 2/3 i&#39;ve owned for free! So you can finesse your way<br/>\n&gt;into some lambent if you got the skill! =P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Good Luck all, and sorry to babble! I like to share my good fortune and<br/>\n&gt;encourage others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Special thanks go to Athren Notechaser for the questions he answered for me<br/>\n&gt;before I went into the temple. You rock bro!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pava, Bard of 19th measure<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Silent Dragons&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
