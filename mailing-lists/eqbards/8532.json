Then wait awhile.<br/>\nThen lull one guard and pull the other. Then wait some more, and then go<br/>\nkill the last guard and camp the room. Lull failed? Thats ok, you can send<br/>\nat least one of the guards off chasing pixies while the group kills the<br/>\nlord. So yes, you usually have to pass on the ykeshas till everybody else<br/>\nhas one, but doing the lord room is nothing special for a bard, and all lvl<br/>\n45+ bards should have them (they dont have to use them, they should just<br/>\nhave them :). <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention the lord room gives some great experiance. Better than the<br/>\nlava crawlers, kobolds, or any other place i can find for a lvl 47+<br/>\nindividual. <br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 bard<br/>\nEnoch Lyciferous, lvl 40 Necromancer<br/>\nTunare<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:52 AM 10/13/1999 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;LOL - you really meant 45-50th bard for those items? <br/>\n&gt;&gt;Those items fall within those level ranges and are very <br/>\n&gt;&gt;acquireable by a NON-TWINKED bard at lvl 40+. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You are absoutely right.
