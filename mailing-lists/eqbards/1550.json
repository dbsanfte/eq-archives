Not sure if it&#39;s a percussion or singing thing or simply a <br/>\ncase of: effect of this song = x + the bard&#39;s lvl (or the bard&#39;s lvl <br/>\ndivided by 2.. or whatever). Either way it does definitely appear to <br/>\nimprove as I gain levels and I&#39;ve seen high lvl bards (I&#39;m 18th, definitely <br/>\nNOT high lvl ;) mention it - on here or in a post, can&#39;t remember. Other <br/>\nsongs improve too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw the post about some Bard spells (sic) requiring Mana on the Test <br/>\nServer too... shocked me somewhat. Does anyone here honestly think we&#39;re <br/>\noverpowered? I&#39;ll say this - we&#39;re a FUN class to play simply because we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to put up with a lot of the tedious shit that many other classes <br/>\ndo. We&#39;re a quick healing, quick moving, pretty good at ass-kicking, speed <br/>\nthe game up a lot for the player kinda class. But I really don&#39;t think <br/>\nwe&#39;re overpowered or twinky in any way. Requiring mana would add an element <br/>\nof tedium to playing the game - and although I hate to go off on a tangent <br/>\nlet me just quickly say that I reckon the last thing EQ needs is another <br/>\nelement of tedium to overcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n...which is why I love Bards - we make this game fun, for me at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nBACK AT THE BARDIC HOMESTEAD...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy instincts are that aything related to us requiring mana will suck but <br/>\nuntil some patient or extremely curious soul really does some research on <br/>\nthis (J Kim? (Just kidding ;)) we really don&#39;t know how harsh it&#39;ll be and <br/>\nit might even be fun. Might make some of our stuff MORE powerful. I like to <br/>\nthink positive - call me naive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a request for some info:<br/>\nI&#39;m close to getting the inviso song... in peoples&#39; experiences, what <br/>\ncritters see through it? And can you use it to disappear from an attacker <br/>\neven after you&#39;ve initiated combat? I suspect not but it&#39;s nice to know <br/>\nthese things in advance ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some tidbits on some other stuff:<br/>\nI think Guardian Rhythms is a great li&#39;l spell. People have mentioned how <br/>\nmagic resistance isn&#39;t working, but I&#39;ve found this song to be extremely <br/>\neffective - especially when I&#39;ve played it with a drum. You resisted the <br/>\n&lt;&lt;turn your brains inside out&gt;&gt; spell! Yeeeeah!<br/>\nAnd the Charismatic Carillion song is GREAT! Thanks to whoever worked out <br/>\nwhat it&#39;s for, it&#39;s excellent to pretty much be able to do everyone&#39;s <br/>\nquests (within reason, of course). I must admit, to me most quests are <br/>\ninane crap with insulting rewards, but I still have fun doing them ;P I&#39;m <br/>\nall excited now I can waltz into the Rogue&#39;s guild in Qeynos and try my <br/>\nhand at all those fun quests I never managed to finish when I played a <br/>\nRogue.<br/>\nOr not. We&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nDud.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tCodo the Mysterious [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:codo@...\">codo@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tFriday, June 04, 1999 6:13 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Sad Encounter<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Codo the Mysterious&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:codo@...\">codo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you<br/>\nget better at Percussion, do you get faster?
