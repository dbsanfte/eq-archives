When I died at 30th level, the EXP<br/>\nbar didn&#39;t drop very much.  I still lost the same amount of EXP I did when I<br/>\ndied at 29-, it just wasn&#39;t as noticeable because it takes so much extra EXP<br/>\nto get thru those levels.  When you died at 47 and dropped to 46, your EXP<br/>\nbar decreased a full bubble into 46.  Had you died at 46 with only a few<br/>\npixels to go before making 47th, you would only have lost maybe a 1/4<br/>\nbub(normal EXP loss).  So in effect, when you died at 47 and dropped a full<br/>\nbub into 46, you got penalized more than you should have.  Is that what you<br/>\nwere pointing out?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Do you understand why I made it a point to use only deaths<br/>\n&gt; which ocurred without my having gained *any* experience into<br/>\n&gt; the new level?  That way the exp loss was for the new level,<br/>\n&gt; but was applied entirely to the old level, letting me do a<br/>\n&gt; direct comparison to deaths in the old level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
