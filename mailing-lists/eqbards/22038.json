There seems to be little to base a guess on. The Fier&#39;Dal<br/>\nseries are all races but the Koda&#39;Dal are elf only and the Tier&#39;Dal are<br/>\nInkie/Human/Half/Troll. I&#39;d think that the halfling weapons might be<br/>\nusable by up to at least elves to throw the halflings a marketable bone<br/>\nbut I&#39;m not too sure because the Dwarven weapons are limited to<br/>\nstubbies alone. I do hope they implement bristlebane imbued Fier&#39;Dal<br/>\ngear. I have druids and clerics waiting in line for Tunare and Karana<br/>\nmorningstars and a pile of people asking &quot;Can you make those rapiers in<br/>\nBristlebane?&quot; that I have to turn away. I think this new smithing is<br/>\ngreat, I just wish there were more gem options. Who knows, Yak said<br/>\nthere would be more recipies added so there may just be some coming<br/>\ndown the pipe yet. As far as Bristlebane, if no Fier&#39;Dal flavors<br/>\narrive, I&#39;d look to the Gnomes before the Halflings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as a point of clarity for those who don&#39;t know, you don&#39;t have to<br/>\nworship the deity to make the weapons, just to imbue the gems and use<br/>\nthe gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinev Rudeflute<br/>\nAlso E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4(n)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wood elven blacksmiths can craft Mithril Fier&#39;dal weapons.  These<br/>\n&gt; items are deity items linked to Tunare.  My bard is a wood elf but I<br/>\n&gt; chose Bristlebane since I figured the god of rogues was more fitting<br/>\n&gt; for a bard than Tunare.<br/>\n&gt; So does that mean I can not equip these weapons since I don&#39;t worship<br/>\n&gt; Tunare?  And if I can&#39;t equip weapons crafted by wood elves, could I<br/>\n&gt; equip deity weapons crafted by halflings who worship Bristlebane?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
