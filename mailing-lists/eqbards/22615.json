Also, note that the points assigned to mobs maybe updated<br/>\nsomewhere internally (ie they have more mobs listed where else - I read that<br/>\nwhen someone from AL was telling someone else to go there and read it.)  But<br/>\nin general you will see how it works for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first saw their system - I was a bit taken aback.  But after being in<br/>\na large guild with a totally different system, I can really see some good<br/>\nvalue in how they do it.  Our guild&#39;s policy is that loot should go to those<br/>\nwho both need it in that they dont have a better item and those who have<br/>\nbeen trying to get it for the longest time.  Well, that turns into &quot;the<br/>\noldest guild memebers in the class get all the best things first.&quot;<br/>\nEssentially, everyone goes on most all of our raids and we do not keep and<br/>\naccurate attendance record. So, you have everyone saying: &quot;I have been on<br/>\nevery POH/POF/POS, Naggy, Vox, VS, DS, Trak, etc etc since I joined the<br/>\nguild...&quot;  Also, our policy is that primary characters get loot before<br/>\nsecondarys.  Well, that becomes problematic when one gets asked to play the<br/>\nsecondary because that is what this raid &quot;needs.&quot; So without some point<br/>\nsystem, who earns credit?  What happens if its your primary&#39;s turn to loot<br/>\nan item and they are not active in the raid? Say you have 3 bards and one is<br/>\nasked to play a cleric for VS raid.  Bard greaves drop. Do you uncamp the<br/>\nprimary to loot and item when 2 others of that class were fighting in the<br/>\nraid?  Point systems can address these issues ahead of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing to look at - for those of you who are interested in &#39;what<br/>\nit&#39;s like to be uber&#39; is the minimum equipment requirements to join AL.<br/>\n&quot;Here&#39;s a list of boring greenies we are not gonna camp for you...&quot;  But<br/>\nindeed it is a list that says you are well equipped and ready for a variety<br/>\nsituations.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the other &#39;uber&#39; guilds on our server has a loot policy that says<br/>\nloot goes to the oldest and highest level players first.  Their focus is on<br/>\nlevel and they leveled as many as possible to 60 as soon as possible.  That<br/>\ndid put them in good shpe to be doing Trak first and VS and they have been<br/>\nfirst ones in our server to go to VP.  Their focus is different - to them<br/>\nlevel is the number one thing.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 20, 2000 9:24 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you guys use a point system?  I seem to remember talking about this in a<br/>\nthread a while back.  We have discussed using points on and off but it<br/>\nalways comes down to the fear that they won&#39;t be assigned uniformly and also<br/>\nthat nobody would want the responsibility of maintaining such a thing.   We<br/>\nuse more of a deferment system.. aka peer pressure.. which seems to work<br/>\nmost of the time, though.  Do you like the point system? Can you use point<br/>\nfor any item you want or does it have to be an item that is &quot;clearly&quot; for<br/>\nyour class?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
