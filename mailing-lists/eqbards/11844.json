He will<br/>\nalso try to cast his DD &  DoT and have his Thorns and buffs up on himself.<br/>\nHe also has some minor heals for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have elemental & guardian memmed and maybe the disenchanting melody<br/>\n(if not - have a egg-shaped pumice handy  they can dispell roots - not sure<br/>\nabout snares).  Selos, hymn, lullaby or pixie, bellow or denon&#39;s, screetch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would start with my MR maxxed out - weaving ele & guardian.  Ranger mana<br/>\nis weak and he may panic when you resist and re-cast.  The more you can make<br/>\nhim cast the better. Get close to him and stay inside bow range.  Use songs<br/>\nto damage at first because he will be thorned.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might try to fear chain him if you are not in the arena but just out in<br/>\na zone.  (hehe if you can pick the spot - charm an HG or Griffon &lt;eg&gt;)  Once<br/>\nyou have made him use up his mana, you can play lullaby and continue song<br/>\ndamage.  They really hate being winced.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on how long the fight goes, his thorns may wear off. I&#39;d try to<br/>\nwait as long as possible to melee him to prevent taking damage from his<br/>\nshield of thorns.  And you can play the same game with Psalm of Warmth. If<br/>\nyou run away to heal or load a different song - remember he has tracking so<br/>\nrun to a zone edge where tracking gets all messed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut like Harm said - you might be well served to go down in the 3rd round<br/>\nfor future peace and harmony ;p<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 38th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tAbraham Hardjana<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, December 15, 1999 3:22 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Dueling techniques for a bard at<br/>\nlevel 30<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Abraham Hardjana<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHello friends,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAs a fellow bard I am faced with a great duel in less than a<br/>\nmonths time.<br/>\n\t\tThis duel will be fought between a level 30-33 bard and a<br/>\nsimilarly<br/>\n\t\tleveled ranger.  From what I have read on the groups most of<br/>\nthe dueling<br/>\n\t\tresults have been for extremely high level people like Shada<br/>\nand a few<br/>\n\t\tlower level duels.  What I am looking for is some sort of<br/>\ntactics to be<br/>\n\t\tused in the battle.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tPlease understand that the ranger I will be facing will be<br/>\nwielding many<br/>\n\t\titems that are above her level like Raincaller, Short Sword<br/>\nof Morin, and<br/>\n\t\tThulian Bladed Claw.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAlso some thoughts... am I expected to lose?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n\t\tBard of Kelethin, Honour Guard <br/>\n\t\tKarana<br/>\n\t\tTo be married to well equipped ranger in less than a month.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
