But now, we buff up, invis and do<br/>\n&quot;standing breaks.&quot;  We get like 3 groups ready and zone them in with 20-30<br/>\nsecond intervals to avoid crashing the server.  Then fight whatever is there<br/>\nuntil we get it cleared.  PoF we usually move the the west wall (50 feet<br/>\nfrom portal.)  PoH we just clear then pull to the zone-in and dont bother<br/>\nwith the SW or North of SW spots any more.  It&#39;s a far cry from when we were<br/>\nmaxxed at level 50.   Having folks 52-57,58 & 59 even makes a great deal of<br/>\ndifference.  &quot;Dont kill that!  He&#39;s giving us mana!~&quot;  as the &#39;chanters are<br/>\nmana tapping mezzed mobs, heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then last night, I got asked to do the Efreeti in nag&#39;s lair with some<br/>\nfriends and friends of friends.  I agreed under the condition that I could<br/>\nbe the puller - hehe.  I was the highest level at 52 and we had a 52 SK.<br/>\nOne 51 and the rest were 48, 49 and 50&#39;s for the 11 folks there.  I planned<br/>\non using Lament and getting singles.  The first group of imps were closely<br/>\nstacked and all 4 of them came.  They got mezzed by the chanter and<br/>\nfortunately the melee folks were able to assist the picker (the 52 SK.)  I<br/>\nguess they had never seen 4 imps all at once - up close and personal like<br/>\nbut they did well and we mowed threw them all.  I had better luck pulling<br/>\nthe next set and got separation using lament.  We rushed the Freeti room and<br/>\nhad no trouble there as well.   Pretty good work for a &#39;pick-up&#39; group.<br/>\nAside from 2 guildies (one was the SK and the other was playing her<br/>\nSha-person secondary char), I had never met the rest of these folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyways, what makes it relavent, is the comment I heard from them:<br/>\n&quot;Resisted!  Damn it, nothings sticking!  Resisted again!&quot;  And all because<br/>\nof the level differences fighting even and higher cons vs fighting blues.  I<br/>\nhave to keep reminding myself as I cruise through Burning Wood: &quot;Yes, it&#39;s<br/>\nblue but blue can be level 51 and he can summon you - that Gullierback, yes<br/>\nhe can.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, July 08, 2000 3:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] The Plane of Fear<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; breaking in is a different story, i hope you are going with some<br/>\nexperienced<br/>\n&gt; groups.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Shada Powa, L56 Wood Elf Troubador<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
