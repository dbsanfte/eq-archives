Back when I worked at an isp I was quite active in news.admin.*<br/>\nand some other comp.* groups but lately most of the areas I&#39;m interested<br/>\nin are better served by mailing lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe geek code now has a web page, www.geekcode.com. I&#39;m not sure how my<br/>\nsig translates now as I made it up back around version 1.0 and the code<br/>\nis appearantly up to 4.0 now. The Artificial Intelligence thing I made<br/>\nup but I&#39;ve since been told there&#39;s a very similar one on a wall at MIT<br/>\nsomewhere. I had the &quot;they keep making better idiots&quot; phrase in mind<br/>\nwhen I made up mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBack on topic a bit, I finally went back and played my bard on my old<br/>\nserver last night after having burned out on playing for quite a while.<br/>\nIt was rather fun. A RL friend I had introduced to the game finally was<br/>\nL52 so we could actually play together. He and I teamed up with a L40<br/>\ndruid and went hunting ice giants. As I&#39;d read that the chants finally<br/>\ndid different damage we tried an all instrument attack. The druid snared<br/>\nand dotted, I wove fear, chant of flame and fufil&#39;s with a MM Drum and<br/>\nmy friend used a lute and played fear, CoD and CoC. We also had a L36<br/>\nwarrior with us who beat on the giant&#39;s back. The giants went down quite<br/>\nquickly. In a couple hours play I&#39;d got a quarter bubble at 49 and the<br/>\nwarrior had got over a bubble in 36. Looks like I may play my bard more<br/>\nfor a while, as I&#39;m definately tired of 53 with my druid.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
