Supposedly Verant<br/>\n&gt; &#39;accidentally put this code into the game?  And then decided to leave it<br/>\n&gt; there as a feature?  Hard to believe.  Even harder to believe given Brad<br/>\n&gt; McQuaid&#39;s past statements. One thing McQuaid has said..and I have probably<br/>\n&gt; repeated here..is that he &quot;never said it would be an easy game&quot;.  Of the 3<br/>\n&gt; major MMORPGs (EQ, UO, AC) Everquest is probably the most difficult and the<br/>\n&gt; most unforgiving for player mistakes. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
