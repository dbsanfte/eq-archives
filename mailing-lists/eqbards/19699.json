Almost 14 months into this game and I&#39;m still a newbie!  Heh heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; About the point<br/>\n&gt; when you start getting enough loot between trips back to town <br/>\n&gt; (And you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; far enough away from town) That you destroy coppers to save <br/>\n&gt; the weight and<br/>\n&gt; keep you light on your feet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>NEVER DESTROY COPPERS!!  Kindly drop them near zone edges when poor newbies<br/>\nlike me can pick them up  (said the encumbered bard twisting Selo&#39;s & Chant<br/>\nall the way from Oasis to Freeport bank &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Twinked or not, ALL my characters save every copper they can <br/>\n&gt; get -- until<br/>\n&gt; they run out of strength to carry it. And I haven&#39;t yet <br/>\n&gt; started throwing<br/>\n&gt; silvers away. That still feels like a sacrilege.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m worse, I have a hard time dropping fishing grubs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a twink, I group with whoever I can find to group with. I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t look<br/>\n&gt; at equipment. Shoot, I don&#39;t know whether most of it is &quot;good or bad&quot;<br/>\n&gt; even. What I look at is first, personality. SOmeone I can get along<br/>\n&gt; with. and second, level range. Can I group with them. Occasionally,<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ll be specifically looking for a tank-type, or a healer-type. Or<br/>\n&gt; a Snarer. But that&#39;s about it :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on your interests in the game.  If you&#39;re playing to level, and<br/>\nyour twinked, then you&#39;re better off to play with other twinks.  Likewise if<br/>\nyour class can solo yellows and your in a group pulling yellows, then you&#39;d<br/>\nbe better off to solo (unless your seeing a huge reduction in downtime).   I<br/>\ndon&#39;t hold it against people who choose to play this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I look at level first.  I level extremely slowly, so if I can<br/>\ngroup with someone who&#39;s a lower level than me, there&#39;s a chance that I<br/>\nmight still be within grouping level range with them the next time we&#39;re<br/>\nboth on.  Personality matters, but that&#39;s not as quickly apparent.  Class<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter at all.  I like to experiment with different group make ups<br/>\nand find ways to make each combo work.   <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
