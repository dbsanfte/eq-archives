There should<br/>\nbe an approx equal number of people who choose not to play bards because<br/>\nthey are boring as choose not to play necros because they are boring.  etc.<br/>\netc.  The only factors that should not balance out over a large sample are<br/>\nthose which result from reward differential, because everyone playing the<br/>\ngame does so to be entertained on some level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nno, we&#39;re simply debating the basis for a choice, not the choice itself.  i<br/>\nmaintain<br/>\nthat choices are not always based on a reward given to work required<br/>\ncomparison.<br/>\nand if they are not, then your argument stating that bards are underpowered<br/>\nbecause<br/>\nthey have fewer people playing them is not a valid argument.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
