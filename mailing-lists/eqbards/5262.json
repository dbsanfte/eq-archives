Then one of my friends pointed<br/>\n&gt; something out, something that I&#39;ve been noticing more and more. Even though<br/>\n&gt; bards don&#39;t have specific things, I think they can use more stuff than<br/>\n&gt; anyone. I think it&#39;s the staff of writhing or observer that is NEC WIZ MAG<br/>\n&gt; ENC and BRD. BRD? WTF? Many more things are like that too. Why can a bard<br/>\n&gt; use it? I think that&#39;s our benefit that goes right along with our JOAT<br/>\n&gt; trait.<br/>\n&gt; \tMy thought anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, while we can weild a couple of 2H weapons (glowing staff and<br/>\n2H dwarven axe come to mind) our skill can never go past 1 in them. I<br/>\nhave heard 2 explanations for this, one that they were marked that way<br/>\nso GM&#39;s could wield them for show, and the other that it was an accident<br/>\nthat they listed bard but as our skill couldn&#39;t raise no one could be<br/>\nbothered fixing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefit your friend pointed out can also be looked on as a curse. As<br/>\nwe are only one of several classes who can weild various weapons, and it<br/>\nis well known that our combat skills are not up to other classes, it is<br/>\nvery unlikely we will get the first of anything found on an expedition,<br/>\nso if you want a ykesha for instance, you will need a group of friends<br/>\nwho will help you who already have them if they can use one, or some<br/>\nvery fair minded people to adventure with. We were in better shape<br/>\nbefore when we shared exclusive use of some rogue weapons like the bone<br/>\ndirk, as our chances of getting one of those in a group were a lot<br/>\nbetter than they are for a Ykesha where every warrior and ranger seems<br/>\nto also want one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if charisma is important to us, the staff of writhing becomes a<br/>\nlot less useful weapon to us, as it gives a big charisma hit. Personally<br/>\nI thought it was a terrible weapon for a bard image wise anyway so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sure would have liked to see that new dragon&#39;s claw list BRD as one of<br/>\nthe classes instead of warrior and ranger but I guess there&#39;s no hope of<br/>\nthat. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one bard specific weapon in the game at this<br/>\npoint.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
