So I&#39;m<br/>\nsure doing so can unstick you (though I don&#39;t know how to do<br/>\nit consistently).  Try hitting your song hotkeys really<br/>\nquickly for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a simple programming issue that&#39;s causing the problem.<br/>\nThe client and server get out of synch.  The client thinks a<br/>\nsong isn&#39;t playing, the server says it is.  You try to play a<br/>\nsong, the server says you&#39;re already playing.  In the opposite<br/>\ncase (what happened to me), you try to stop playing a song,<br/>\nthe server says you&#39;re already stopped.  They just need to add<br/>\nsomething to resynch the client and server.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
