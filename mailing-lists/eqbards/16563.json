However, there are<br/>\nseveral changes to note:<br/>\n<br/>\n*Spell Changes*<br/>\n<br/>\n- Skin Like Nature has had its damage shield removed and has regained its<br/>\nregeneration component.  We&#39;re certain this time :)<br/>\n- Many Shaman buff spells have had their recast delay removed.  You can<br/>\nnow cast them on multiple people without having to wait between each cast.<br/>\n- The Wizard spell &quot;Rend&quot; was improperly saving versus cold.  It now saves<br/>\nversus Magic.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Bug Fixes and General Enhancements*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe spawning problem in Solusek&#39;s Eye (SoldungA), related to the spawn of<br/>\nthe Clockwork gnomes, will be fixed later today in a zone patch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe +/= key will no longer take screenshots. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can now adjust your clipping plane by using the SHIFT/- and SHIFT/+<br/>\nkey combinations. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can now view the Message of the Day by typing /motd.<br/>\n<br/>\nCorrected a bug in the /follow process that would cause your character to<br/>\nloop around to the right at times when following someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nCorrected a bug that would cause item-loss associated with trading a<br/>\ncontainer marked LORE. <br/>\n<br/>\nCorrected some grouping bugs that had the potential to cause the client to<br/>\ncrash. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Feign Death and Pets*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Feign Death spell will no longer wear off.  This change had been made<br/>\ndue to an issue that was discovered that allowed Necromancers to solo<br/>\ncreatures while feigned and AFK.  The change had some unintended effects,<br/>\nas we discovered that there are a few cases where someone could be<br/>\nlegitimately feigned for a longer period. Instead of having the spell wear<br/>\noff, any summoned pet will automatically suicide 2 minutes after its owner<br/>\nfeigns.  This is the solution requested by most of the players who voiced<br/>\nan opinion, and should serve the same goal as the original change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
