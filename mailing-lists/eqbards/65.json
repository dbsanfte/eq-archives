I haven&#39;t seen any improvement in merchant prices either, is that<br/>\nmaybe I don&#39;t have a brass instrument equipped when I sing it?  Are you<br/>\nsupposed to click on the merchant when you have the song icon in the active<br/>\nspells area?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\n Name: Joseph &quot;Burnt Toast&quot; Chang<br/>\n E-Mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jkchang@...\">jkchang@...</a><br/>\n Homepage: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.linkonline.net/jkchang\">http://members.linkonline.net/jkchang</a><br/>\n AIM / ICQ #: jkchang256 / 11739978</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
