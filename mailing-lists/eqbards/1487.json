I think spawn points spawn a<br/>\nvariety of creatures, and one in the northwest corner of E.C. produces<br/>\nDW snakes along with others.  Since barely anyone hunts the<br/>\nsnakes, they become the predominant mob in that area.<br/>\nThey are all over the northwest corner.  I used the mountain<br/>\nbehind the inn as a place to fight them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only problem is that if you solo them, the poison really boosts<br/>\nyour downtime, with a cleric buddy though.....<br/>\n<br/>\nWith luck you&#39;ll get a Giant snake fang (4g6s to an npc) or venom<br/>\nsack (4g6s).  Every once in a while I&#39;ve gotten 1 of each or 2 of one<br/>\non the same snake, as good a haul as a lightstone, without the need<br/>\nfor a magic weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m level 14, and I&#39;ve just &quot;moved&quot; to the west coast.  In the last 3 levels<br/>\nI&#39;ve put away 93pp in the bank.  Now I have to decide on exactly how to<br/>\nspend it (how much on banded, whether or not to buy a magic weap yet,<br/>\nand if so what)<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen, Journeyman Bard of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
