Let me ask you this...are the Fire Giant&#39;s green or blue to you?  Or<br/>\neven white?  If they are white and above they are going to get resisted.  I<br/>\ngroup with druids now and they get resisted 100% of the time against reds,<br/>\n80% against yellow and 60% against whites.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJesse[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, July 16, 1999 12:12 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [eqbards] Offtopic: Asheron&#39;s Call vs. Everquest<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Jesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, this is were the grouping aspects of EQ take over.  Yes we have<br/>\n&gt; songs <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that lower fire resist, also enchanters can lower resists as well (which<br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; why my bard loves grouping with enchanters, but that is another thread <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;grin&gt;).  This is not a solo&#39;ist game in the long run, esp if you want<br/>\n&gt; to go <br/>\n&gt; &gt; into the dungeon depths.  The thing with Druids and Necros is that they<br/>\n&gt; are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; so easy to solo up to high levels (30+) that the people who play them do<br/>\n&gt; not <br/>\n&gt; &gt; get a chance to build grouped tactics.  So it is not so much that they<br/>\n&gt; are <br/>\n&gt; &gt; difficult to play at higher levels, they are just suddenly forced to<br/>\n&gt; group <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the 30&#39;s and it can ge a bit harsh making the change that late in the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s bull. Sure, it may be true for some people, but most druids I know<br/>\n&gt; (including myself) are constant groupers. Grouping is where the fun is at.<br/>\n&gt; However, it&#39;s not fun to be decent at some things (DD and heal) for 30<br/>\n&gt; levels, then suddenly have half your ability taken away (DDs resisted) and<br/>\n&gt; your other main ability fade away slowly (no heals above greater heal).<br/>\n&gt; Yes, you can still be very useful. But no longer can you be, to a group,<br/>\n&gt; what you&#39;ve been for 30 levels (a nuker or healer as needed). That&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; hard change to make -- especially when Verant keeps waving in your face<br/>\n&gt; &quot;you&#39;re the second/third best nukers in the game!&quot; but decline to mention<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s IF you&#39;re not resisted. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kind of like how they go &quot;you have the best root in the game! it roots AND<br/>\n&gt; does damage!&quot; Sure.. at level 30, that 10dmg with a root is really worth<br/>\n&gt; the extra 40% resists..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, getting pretty off topic here.. =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Jesse &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j@...\">j@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumiere.net/\">http://www.lumiere.net/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get $20 off all MotherNature brand products!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
