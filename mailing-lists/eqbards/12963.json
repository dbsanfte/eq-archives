I sometimes think we can lose sight of what<br/>\nwe&#39;re doing (man I HATE those nights when she can&#39;t play).  I think our<br/>\n#1 job is to make everyone else better at what they do best (which is<br/>\nhow verant designed us).  We take the down time healing requirment off<br/>\nthe clerics (I cannot tell you how much, even at my low lvl this means,<br/>\nI have mana to buff everyone, and even throw some stuns in combat when<br/>\nour bard is around).  We help the real melees fight better (granted many<br/>\nother people do this better than us, but at a great cost in mana).  We<br/>\nhelp the casters regain mana (at levels higher than me).  <br/>\nSecondly we fill in when you don&#39;t have the ideal group configuration. <br/>\nNo enchanter, then crowd control falls on our lap.  No tank (well at<br/>\nlower levels, it seems we cant do this at higher levels from what i<br/>\nhear), looks like all those mean orcys are going to chew on little old<br/>\nme (I end up tanking in pick up groups a lot because so many tanks are<br/>\nnot good pullers and I get impatient).  No teleporter in the group? <br/>\nWell guess who&#39;s going to get your group across the continent fastest? <br/>\nNo pet to sacrafice to that mob &quot;We thought we could kill it&quot;?  Oh wait<br/>\nguess we can&#39;t help there... (unless you can charm FAST)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll say it again at least at low levels a good tank(Monk in this case),<br/>\nwith a buffer (Shaman in this case) and a bard at his side in a darn<br/>\nscary thing.  We had no trouble (even pulled desert trash some times)<br/>\nholding the 4 derv camp this weekend and they are high blue/black/yellow<br/>\nto us (with Thugs being red, I would kite them to half usually before<br/>\nthe monk would attack).  That was pretty sweet experience and loot... <br/>\n(the shaman was at more than 2x her massive wt limit with bronze weapons<br/>\nwhen we went to sell)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
