They<br/>\nwill not be able to cast it on if you already have<br/>\nchain on.  However, you should be able to notice this<br/>\nfor yourself.  Our slowdown doesn&#39;t even come close to<br/>\ncomparing to the shaman&#39;s.  You should visibly notice<br/>\nif your chain was killing their slowdown.  I&#39;m pretty<br/>\nsure I&#39;ve stacked chain onto an enchanters slowdown<br/>\nand the mob was still attacking VERY slow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n45 1/2th level bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on another note, i&#39;d love a definitive answer to<br/>\n&gt; this question, as it would<br/>\n&gt; allow me to start chaining sooner if i am the snarer<br/>\n&gt; in the group.  i group<br/>\n&gt; with a shaman a lot, and obviously the shaman is in<br/>\n&gt; charge of slowing the<br/>\n&gt; mob.  so, if the shaman slows the mob, and i chain<br/>\n&gt; the mob after, will the<br/>\n&gt; chain cancel the shaman&#39;s slowdown?  i usually wait<br/>\n&gt; til close to when the<br/>\n&gt; mob is going to run cause i don&#39;t want to cancel the<br/>\n&gt; slow.  if i am not<br/>\n&gt; going to cancel it then i can start snaring earlier,<br/>\n&gt; since i have recently<br/>\n&gt; become accustomed to getting resisted a ton.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada Powa, L55 Wood Elf Troubador<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L50 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
