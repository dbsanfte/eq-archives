The picture quality is gorgeous, and everquest runs like a<br/>\ndream. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only &quot;problem&quot; is the lack of glide support, which isn&#39;t really an<br/>\nissue with EQ (i tried playing with my voodoo2 in glide, and switched back<br/>\nto the tnt2 because i liked it better), although it&#39;s preventing me from<br/>\nplaying Tribes (unless their opengl is finally ready). The days of<br/>\nglide-only games seems to be over, so i&#39;m not really too bothered by it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
