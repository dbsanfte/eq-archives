You can only imagine the number <br/>\n&gt; of /petitions<br/>\n&gt; that get filed every night.  I get loads of crazy  requests <br/>\n&gt; from people.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes they start out: what items do you need for Lambent <br/>\n&gt; Helm?  Followed<br/>\n&gt; by: do you have any for sale?  Then: can you come help me get <br/>\n&gt; one?  This is<br/>\n&gt; from people totally out of the blue &lt;no pun intended&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; then I go /anon<br/>\n&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;.  &quot;Sorry, I am kinda tied up here with these Fire <br/>\n&gt; Giants and cant<br/>\n&gt; come help you right now....&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But any how - keep talking to the guides and GM and be calm <br/>\n&gt; and nice but<br/>\n&gt; persistent.  They can restore you to a point prior to your <br/>\n&gt; incident.  There<br/>\n&gt; is a lot of discretionary room for guides and gm&#39;s.  Keep <br/>\n&gt; talking to them<br/>\n&gt; and eventually you should get some help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would love to see someone who is a real life attorney or <br/>\n&gt; has some bucks to<br/>\n&gt; hire one go after these loot item stealers.

Now this may take a few hours so get<br/>\n&gt; comfortable and watch....And remember she had TWO of the <br/>\n&gt; items stolen!
