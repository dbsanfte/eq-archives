The only hard part about it is convincing your group to move<br/>\ndown in there.  It isn&#39;t that hard to do once you have done it a couple of<br/>\ntimes.  First thing you need to do is set up camp outside the gates and pull<br/>\nall the giants on the right side of the fortress.  Once that is done, med up<br/>\nand have every one move in towards the entrance of the tunnel.  There will<br/>\nlikely be some giants nearby but their aggro range is so small that they<br/>\nwill not attack you.  Your group will need to be ready to fight two giants<br/>\nnear the tunnel entrance.  For this fight, you need to kill them quickly and<br/>\nmake sure there are no runners.  Once you kill these two, move into the<br/>\nfirst part of the tunnel and med up.  There will be one or two giants a<br/>\nshort distance from the tunnel entrance.  These may start roaming if they<br/>\nhave been there for a while so be ready to get attacked.  Kill those, med up<br/>\nand then kill the giants further down the tunnel.  Once you kill those, you<br/>\nshould be able to move down to the bottom of the ramp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral reasons why camping at the bottom of the tunnel is best.  First off,<br/>\nyou don&#39;t have to worry about any wandering mobs.  They will not come down<br/>\nto the level portion of the tunnel.  Second reason is that you can safely<br/>\nuse the chains/fear trick here.  Third reason is that mountain crags spawn<br/>\nin the tunnel.  The crags are higher level (some conned yellow to me at 35th<br/>\nlevel) than the giants who spawn outside in the fortress.    <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting out of the fortress can be tricky.  Most likely you will have to<br/>\nmake a mad dash but with Selos the bard is relatively safe.  In the times I<br/>\nhave camped the tunnel, the casters gated out and the meleers followed me.<br/>\nWe aggroed a few giants on our way to the LOIO zone but after a while they<br/>\nstopped chasing us.  You could try Lamenting the mobs if you want to as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.
