Sadly enough in my normal group our tanks are<br/>\na monk and a dwarf cleric.  I am considered the group target dummy and<br/>\nbuffer and usually end up looking like a cheap enchanter with a mace.  The<br/>\ndwarf cleric can take far more damage than I can and he is 2 levels lower<br/>\nthan me.  Divine Aura just makes it even more noticeable.  In truth bards<br/>\nare lousy tanks, lousy nukers, and lousy rogues with ok buffs.  But overall<br/>\nwe are beast at doing everything if you consider things all at once.  Its<br/>\nthe skill caps that really make this only true up till 17th level or so.<br/>\nafter that many of our skills will become useless like hide, sneak, etc.  I<br/>\nthink they are taking the &#39;master of none&#39; part of jack of all trades a<br/>\nlittle too far, but since there are so few bards our voice is small and we<br/>\nmay never be heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 17, 1999 10:47 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard only equipment, a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 17 Sep 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What other class has had their spell deliberatly placed as<br/>\n&gt; lesser value?

Obviously outdoors you would not<br/>\n&gt; since Accel is far faster especially as the bard playing<br/>\n&gt; grows.  In our desire to not fall into the morrass of me<br/>\n<br/>\nI really wish they&#39;d just fix this right, and have the game<br/>\ncheck for other active movement spell effects when one<br/>\nexpires.  If two are in conflict, the faster takes precedence<br/>\n(with the exception of root/snare/chain).  If someone has SoW<br/>\non him and a bard in his group plays a faster Accelerando, he<br/>\nshould get the Accelerando boost.  If he drops out of song<br/>\nrange, he should drop back down to SoW speed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I would like to see the quest system fixed.. I&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; see some more special items for bards.  I&#39;d like to see<br/>\n<br/>\nI too would like to see some more special items.  Right now<br/>\nthe only bard-specific items are instruments, one of which<br/>\ncomes from Nagafen the dragon, one which comes from a L30ish<br/>\nmob in Mistmoore, and the rest of which are no different from<br/>\nstore bought instruments.  Oh, and the PoF items, not that any<br/>\nbard is going to be getting them soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; some more useful songs. And I&#39;ld like to see them stop<br/>\n&gt; nerfing us without reguard to the results. I won&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; get into balance, as right now I feel we are underbalanced<br/>\n&gt; now and others seem to think we are just fine. Anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of balance, I think we&#39;re still pretty well balanced.<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see us get either another defensive skill, or the<br/>\ncap on dodge raised to 200.  The defensive skills are dodge,<br/>\nblock, parry, and riposte.  Because we&#39;re not supposed to be<br/>\nfull tanks, we only get one out of four.  And then for some<br/>\nstrange reason the one we get is capped at half what the other<br/>\ntanks get?  That puts our defensive ability closer to casters<br/>\nthan to tanks.  In fact I&#39;ll need to ask my cleric friends<br/>\nwhat the cap on their dodge skill is.  I have the sinking<br/>\nfeeling they&#39;re just as good at tanking as we are (better<br/>\neven since they&#39;re usually using a shield).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
