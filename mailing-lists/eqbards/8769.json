In regards to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-702057036\">1)  I paid 150PP for a barbed leather whip (BLW) and after getting some<br/>\nthulian claws sold it for 150PP.  I wouldn&#39;t pay much higher than 150PP.  In<br/>\nregards to finding someone selling it, for every item in the game your best<br/>\nchances of buying it is to go to the zone where it is found.    <br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I&#39;ve never had either of the two weapons you listed but I&#39;m almost<br/>\ncertain the DAM/DLY ratio for the BLW is better than either of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Unless you get a group to help you camp the PGT spawn, it will be almost<br/>\nimpossible for you to get a PGT by yourself.  That spawn is heavily camped<br/>\nand any nuker can KS it from you.  With the new rules giving the kill to the<br/>\ngroup that does the most damage, you should be able to get a PGT with a<br/>\ngroup of three easily.  The going rate for a PGT on E&#39;ci is around 300PP if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t want to camp for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have a Dragoon Dirk and have boosted my piercing to around 60 (out of<br/>\n&gt; 80). I find that I still like the secure feeling of my heavy, slow mino<br/>\n&gt; axe for big stuff. I&#39;m planning to put the dirk in my off hand when I hit<br/>\n&gt; 17 and want something magical for the primary. The barbed leather whip<br/>\n&gt; seems to have good stats.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Questions:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) How much should I auction for it and where? (I know it comes out of<br/>\n&gt; Najena)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) Is it better bang for the buck than a combine ls or scim?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) Do I have a chance at skipping it and camping for a PGT before 20?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
