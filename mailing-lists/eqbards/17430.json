With a six-note, wakizashi, haste belt, and<br/>\naugmentation (putting me at max haste), I averaged just about<br/>\n11.0 damage/sec in melee.  Factoring out a haste belt and<br/>\nfactoring in Verses, that would&#39;ve been about 8.2 damage/sec<br/>\nwhich agrees with the average Raiel got.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does this compare to instrument attacks?<br/>\n<br/>\nCoC+CoD with a lute at L50:<br/>\nCoD = ~50 damage/6 sec<br/>\nCoC =  32 damage/6 sec<br/>\ntotal = 82 damage/6 sec = 13.7 damage/sec<br/>\ntotal w/ gypsy lute = 85 damage/6 sec = 14.2 damage/sec<br/>\ntotal w/ Kelin&#39;s lute = 98 damage/6 sec = 16.3 damage/sec<br/>\n<br/>\nChants with a drum at L50:<br/>\n<br/>\nFCC = ~31 damage/6 sec<br/>\nCoF = 48 damage/6 sec<br/>\ntotal = 127 damage/6 sec = 21.2 damage/sec<br/>\ntotal w/ MM drum = 148 damage/6 sec = 24.7 damage/sec<br/>\ntotal w/ Selo&#39;s drum = 169 damage/6 sec = 28.2 damage/sec<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the Chants offer superior damage, but the Chords can be<br/>\nmixed in more easily with healing.  Since healing affects your<br/>\nentire party, that can easily make Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD better<br/>\nthan the Chants.  Chords are also better against multiple<br/>\ntargets (obviously), since just one extra target doubles the<br/>\ndamage rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I used the Chords while fighting with weapons, that would<br/>\nput me at 18 damage/sec.  But I lose out on half the healing<br/>\nwith the Hymn+Nivs+CoC+CoD combo as well.  OTOH, using the<br/>\nChants with weapons equipped puts me at about the same damage<br/>\nrate as if I were using a normal drum (21.7 damage/sec).  <br/>\nSince there&#39;s no healing factor here, if I&#39;m going to use the<br/>\n3 Chants, it clearly makes more sense for me to use my Selo&#39;s<br/>\ndrum than my weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m using only two chants (CoFl+CoFr), then with a Selos<br/>\ndrum my damage is 128 damage/6 sec = 21.3 damage/sec.  With<br/>\nweapons it&#39;s 19 damage/sec.  So it still makes sense to use a<br/>\ndrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nFCC debuffs MR though, which is arguably more useful, so if I<br/>\nuse FCC+CoF, then with a Selo&#39;s drum my damage is 105 damage/<br/>\n6 sec = 17.5 damage/sec.  With weapons and singing the Chants,<br/>\nit&#39;s also 17.5 damage/sec.  So this will be a toss-up<br/>\ndepending on resist rates.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in a nutshell, there are very few situations where our<br/>\nweapons will be superior to an instrument attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a whim, I tried FCC+CoFl+CoFr+CoC on one seafury, switching<br/>\ninstruments.  I managed to steal it from my friends who were<br/>\ngrouped (L38 bard, L35 cleric, L43 monk w/ FBSS, L44<br/>\nenchanter).  My calculated damage was 221 damage/6 sec = 36.8<br/>\ndamage/sec for that configuration.  Obscene.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
