What&#39;s up with<br/>\nthat? Was this too powerful a benefit? Meanwhile, the accellerando still<br/>\ncancels sow when it wears off, as does levitate and of course the L30<br/>\nsong still doesnt work. Wish they would take a break from nerfing and<br/>\nfix some bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also discovered with great joy that our music skills are capped at 200<br/>\nalong with our combat skills. Guess I can&#39;t complain about that too much<br/>\nas even a warrior&#39;s combat skills cap at 200, and you&#39;d think the<br/>\nwarrior would be better at them than other fighters. But if that&#39;s the<br/>\ncase, why are the magic users still shooting up over 200 in their<br/>\ncasting skills?<br/>\n<br/>\nA very depressed L41 bard. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
