Also, the first time I got the hammer, I sold it for 90 pp to a shaman. (I was like 12 at the time and it was a lot of dough ;) This was when noone knew about the quest and the hammer&#39;s weren&#39;t popular.  Also IMO, for a low level Shaman this is a great weapon!<br/>\n<br/>\nPIXIE STRIKE:  Last night I was soloing dwarves in OOT (Beatdrop doesn&#39;t like those shorties) and when things went bad, I was able to keep them Striked and heal at the same time.  I did notice that sometimes the strike wouldn&#39;t last as long as most of the succesful strikes.  My opinion is that the duration of the mez will depend on 1) your Charisma and 2) the MR of the mob.  I also recall someone posting a quote from GZ to the list (or maybe it was The Concert Hall) that said Charisma affects 1) the successful mezzes and charms and 2) the duration the mez/charm lasts.  But these are just my opinions, I could be wrong ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Beatdrop Battledrum &lt;Platinum Sphere&gt;<br/>\nChild of Erollisi Marr<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
