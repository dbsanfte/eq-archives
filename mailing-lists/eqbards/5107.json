Obviously Verants<br/>\nsoulution was to set all the songs regardless of level to the same &quot;saving<br/>\nthrow&quot; for missed notes. This problem began immediately after the patch, and<br/>\nI agree its silly to miss a note on Selo or Hymn. I never complained about<br/>\nthe missed notes on a new song, it made sense it would be difficult to<br/>\nlearn, just like fizzles on a new spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 09, 1999 10:43 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Charisma effect on magic resists<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;At 120 charisma I consider the number of missed notes I get to<br/>\n&gt;be intolerable.  I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>\n&gt;of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>\n&gt;this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt;how any of you are able to stand it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  With 95 charisma (base) I miss on around 20% of my songs.<br/>\n  Mind you, not level 22 or 23 songs, I&#39;m talking about Jig,<br/>\n  Selo&#39;s, and Hymm.  It&#39;s truly embarrassing.  It&#39;s like a<br/>\n  level 25 cleric fizzling minor heal.  I like to group with<br/>\n  players who are around 4 to 8 levels higher than I am, and<br/>\n  it makes bards look pretty bad.  Needless to say, I feedback&#39;d<br/>\n  the amount of missed notes I was getting recently, because<br/>\n  it wasn&#39;t like this before.  And I will always wonder everytime<br/>\n  a &#39;spdat.eff&#39; file comes my way, if I have been nerfed again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;this entire weekend because I actually get to play the game,<br/>\n&gt;instead of assidiously watching the chat window for &quot;missed<br/>\n&gt;a note&quot; messages.  I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>\n&gt;tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>\n&gt;on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>\n&gt;to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>\n&gt;frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  You and me both brother.  I&#39;m too busy pushing hotkeys to<br/>\n  start songs, getting bashed, and figuring out which songs<br/>\n  played, which ended, which never even started...  It&#39;s<br/>\n  something I&#39;d rather not worry about with songs I learned<br/>\n  20 levels ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic Distortion, 25th drummer.<br/>\n  League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n  &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
