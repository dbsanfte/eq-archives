Now that he can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;make a pet, I need to worry about what songs are bad to play when his<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pet is around.  Do songs like the Chords of Dissonance affect the pet?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Will the pet also run fast when I&#39;m playing Selo&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Jerrilia<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bard of the 9th song<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Luclin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pets are treated as non-party members for our songs.  So if you are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>singing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; AE attack songs the pet will get hit, but not be effected by the song.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you will be added to the pets hate list, so if the pet&#39;s master goes LD<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; pet will aggro on you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll have to test this, but I don&#39;t remember being attacked by my GF&#39;s pet<br/>\nunless I sang an AE song AFTER she went LD...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other song to worry about is obvious....  Invis.  Not that I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t accidentally killed pets on numerous occasions. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSelo&#39;s will NOT affect the pet, nor will any other &quot;Party&quot; songs.  The pet<br/>\nnormally will catch up before too long, tho. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
