So i go to the cemetary, i see a<br/>\nnamed invisible npc with a book in hand named something like Ssinn or<br/>\nsomething like that. Hmmm i think to myself, maybe its the red robe npc and<br/>\nhe&#39;s green to me and scowling ready to attack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, to make a long story short, i screwed up big time, Turns out it was<br/>\na quest npc for the sol ro temple<br/>\nyour faction with sol ro got worse<br/>\nyour faction with shadowmen got better <br/>\n<br/>\nUgh!  and to top things off i decided to get creative before this and went<br/>\nall the way in the castle to the gypsie room (woohoo i know where they are<br/>\nnow) and decided to tap her on the shoulder and make a run for it<br/>\nscreetching to  the zone....  i didnt make it *mumbles something about<br/>\ncasters*  <br/>\n<br/>\nThough i died, i still came out ahead at the end of the night and laughed<br/>\nabout my mini train, but the faction hit really hurt, im now apprehensive in<br/>\nthe temple and the npcs wont talk to me unless i use my faction song,<br/>\nluckily the other bard that took the hit had killed many shadowmen to get<br/>\nhis faction up and he&#39;s still ok in the temple.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nsol ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:galen@...\">galen@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:galen@...\">galen@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, October 22, 1999 11:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Our limbo letter...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:galen@...\">galen@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any chance of getting our unreplied letter added to the files area?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gaelthorne<br/>\n&gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
