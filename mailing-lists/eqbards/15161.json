Fishing adds variety to the game.  I&#39;ve also done<br/>\nfishing when I really need to read a textbook (for work), but I really<br/>\nwant to paly EQ.  I compromise by fishing.  Read a paragraph, press the<br/>\nfishing hot key, read a paragraph, press the fishing hot key....<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly I use fishing to pass the time waiting for a boat, and of course<br/>\nI work on sense heading at the same time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJerrilia<br/>\nBard of the 9th song<br/>\nLuclin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
