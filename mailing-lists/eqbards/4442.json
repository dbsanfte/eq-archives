In West FP a mage summoned a skeleton for a pet then<br/>\ndissapeared, and the pet promptly slew everything within the mage<br/>\nguild(I watched as it happened). For a while it just stood there till a<br/>\nhigh level paladin on our server slew it, and then the mage reappeared<br/>\nagain. He spoke of the Ilkath Zan, a DE society who was watching us with<br/>\ntheir agents, about how they gave him that book in the form a human,<br/>\nhoping he would cast its spell, that they were watching us as we spoke,<br/>\nand that those who helped slay the skelton were doomed(yay for me).<br/>\nAfter the undead battle we had fought(and considering all the deaths,<br/>\nand how one mob escaped) we lost in sro past sunday I feel that there is<br/>\nsomething brewing in those gms mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalonus DuPrey<br/>\nWandering Minstrel of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes there is probably an underlying story brewing slowly here.  One which we<br/>\n&gt; bards may play more of a part in than we know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmm, kinda like all those Dark Elves are agents of some great conspiracy...<br/>\n&gt; Good thing we have our own agents spreading out now to keep an eye on their<br/>\n&gt; doings...

Anyone who<br/>\n&gt; mentions<br/>\n&gt; &gt;something about being part of &quot;The Dead&quot; is.  Other than the fact that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Dark Elves have a known alliance with the Crushbone Orcs, I cant help you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the rest... though it seems logical that they also have an alliance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with the DeathFist orcs and the Gnolls.... it seems to me they have an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unusally high presence in High Pass as well, which makes me wonder if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are conspiring with the leader of High pass?
