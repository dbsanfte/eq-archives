It may just be that things look screwy<br/>\nwhen fighting clops/giants.  I know that I can melee them while standing<br/>\nmuch farther back than I ever could Dervishes.  It seems like it might be<br/>\nthe same physical range, but since the clops/giants are so much larger, and<br/>\nhave a larger melee range, it makes it seem like you&#39;re closer to them than<br/>\nto the dervishes.  If you remember, try running back to a dervish camp, and<br/>\nsee how it compares.  Or I&#39;ll try tonight or tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Daniel P.
