It is bard only and a horn graphic but it is only range<br/>\nequipable. It has a clickable slow and a load of awesome stats. I think it<br/>\ndropped off something or other in VT. They logged me on to loot it so it<br/>\nwould not rot. They say it&#39;s effect doesn&#39;t stack with our slow song. I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t had a chance to test it yet. They also got the ancient mana song for<br/>\nme. I have not had the time to play in the last couple weeks due to an<br/>\navalanche of RL stuff. Nothing bad, just loads of various crap that leaves<br/>\nlittle time to play. I hope to get back in the swing when PoP comes out. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if you haven&#39;t heard, another nifty bard/rogue item drops in Fungus<br/>\nGrove. It&#39;s a cloak that goes in the ammo slot with a rightclick self invis.<br/>\nThis is off the named guy that spawns when you do the ring, which is a ton<br/>\nof fun btw and doable with a group. Just pick the right speed for your group<br/>\nsize/capability.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe 60 Bard <br/>\nBrilinia Ilsidi 54 <br/>\nBrillinia Klagetsdautter 46 cleric <br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
