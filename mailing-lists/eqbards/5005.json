I unequiped my two bracers that provide AC8 (I think)<br/>\nand took a look at my AC total and it dropped by 15 points.  Of course<br/>\nthis is just a guess but it is possible that the material value is<br/>\nfactored into the AC total, so a piece of AC5 mesh(like chain) adds 8 to<br/>\nyour overall AC and AC5 plate adds 10 to your overall AC.  Thereby making<br/>\nit quite viable to go for a full suit of plate armor, since this will tip<br/>\nthe scales in your favour for damage resists.  Can anyone verify this<br/>\nhypothesis?<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 5 Aug 1999, Blair, Keith (Keith Blair) wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The type of armor does make a difference.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The difference between leather and plate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was like night and day, and in my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; opinion still is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But is it different because of the AC # difference, or because of the<br/>\n&gt; material the armor is made from? ie: If a piece of plate has an AC of say 5<br/>\n&gt; and a piece of Mesh had an AC of 5 as well, would there be a difference? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The question is whether the AC# makes the difference or the material makes<br/>\n&gt; the difference. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
