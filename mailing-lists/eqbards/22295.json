I dinged into 35 earlier this week and made a b-line<br/>\nfor Kelethin to train in Tracking (sunk 38 points into it... brilliant<br/>\nskill).  While I was in the neighbourhood, I paid a visit to Mr. D&#39;Vinn to<br/>\ngive him my regards and relieve him of his Dirk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in the tower, looking out one of the windows when I see a Bard in full<br/>\nLambent on the receiving end of a sound spanking from a Centurion.  A quick<br/>\n/who bard showed him as level 7.  Nothing new there; it happens all the<br/>\ntime.  I&#39;m not bitter, cos, you know, I *worked* for my Lambent and didn&#39;t<br/>\nbuy a single piece... grumble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hop down from the tower to give him a hand and someone shouts out &quot;OMG!<br/>\nTwo bard twinks in the zone. Don&#39;t expect us to save your asses.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n?!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI later had to save this fellow&#39;s hide when he pulled an almighty train to<br/>\nthe zone, but I&#39;ll continue that in Kitasi&#39;s thread...<br/>\n<br/>\nKyrisha</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
