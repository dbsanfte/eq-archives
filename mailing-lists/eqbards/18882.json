Feeling confident, (25 was the first level I reached without<br/>\ndying since 5, 26 was the second) I began my search for some lambent<br/>\narmor.  After some unsuccesful searching, I decided to come here with<br/>\nsome questions...<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically with all these peices, I&#39;d like to know is there a specific<br/>\nmob (IE the Shin Knight down the hall from the preist room) or will any<br/>\nmob of that type drop the item I need.  Also any other advice you could<br/>\noffer for getting them would be great. (like where to find them) (Most<br/>\nof these peices are out my reach right now, but my guild has lots of mid<br/>\n30&#39;s casters dying to get me to 32, so they are very eager to help me<br/>\nget my lambent, (I assume they want me to get my butt back to ROK for<br/>\nmore levels))<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Boned Bracelets (Greater DB skelly in Unrest)<br/>\nShin Greaves (Shin Knight, upper guk)<br/>\nShin Gauntlets (Ghoul Shin Knight, lower guk)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso since I am in Guk, I am trying to get the Mask of the Deceiver. <br/>\nThe person camping it on Saturday was willing to let me loot it, but I<br/>\ncould never find the room.  How do you ge there?  Will I make it with<br/>\ninvisibility?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell thanks for the help :)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
