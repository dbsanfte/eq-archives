Just don&#39;t use it when grouped with an <br/>\nenchanter - they won&#39;t like it much. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to Sol A after the Temple Ro patch to get my fiery vambraces/boots. <br/>\nTook me two days. I was alone and had no problem and I barely ever used a <br/>\nweapon. I equipped the lute and twisted the lvl 48 DoT, lvl 2 DoT, and Hymn, <br/>\nswitching to Chains before they started running (oh yeah, used MR song <br/>\ninstead of lvl 2 DoT if fighting a mage). If I had to fight more than one <br/>\nI&#39;d charm the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome friends of mine (a lvl 50 druid and lvl 50 warrior) thought I was nuts <br/>\nfor soloing back there. Even though everything was green, they had trouble <br/>\nand had to zone many times, while I sat back and played my songs. The song <br/>\nis powerful, but honestly I don&#39;t like using it when fighting high level <br/>\nmobs unless there is only one and we have a good taunter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother Companions HATE attempt comin up this weekend.

Anyway , the lvl 46 song isn&#39;t too exciting. but i looked <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;the lvl 48 song on the concert hall song list , and it says its an area<br/>\n&gt;effect song that does 100 damage in about 8 seconds . is this true ? how <br/>\n&gt;much<br/>\n&gt;do the other dot songs do at that lvl? Do they stack ? I checked the song<br/>\n&gt;analysis and there was no info on the damage it does , just that it lowers<br/>\n&gt;attack speed too ( nice bonus ). So any High lvl that have info and would<br/>\n&gt;share would be great.  Btw , anyone else think berserker crescendo is<br/>\n&gt;completely stupid and useless? It doesn&#39;t stack with anything , and only<br/>\n&gt;gives +20 strength , or does it have other effects?<br/>\n&gt;Thanks in Advance-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ulaien Firesong<br/>\n&gt;lvl 46 bard of tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
