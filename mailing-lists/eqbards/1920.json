Its clear there is an<br/>\n&gt;easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure where you draw this line.... Please define it a little more so<br/>\n&gt;I can figure out if you&#39;ve pre-classified me as a powergamer or a<br/>\n&gt;roleplayer.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was speaking in general about some prior posts, so at that point hadn&#39;t<br/>\n&#39;classified&#39; you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From your message, I believe you&#39;re talking about the Platemail<br/>\n&gt;issue, but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  If so, I believe you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;labelling me as a powergamer, because, as I&#39;ve previously mentioned, I<br/>\n&gt;believe our class is Balanced with the use of Plate in mind.  I believe<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a Bard that doesn&#39;t use Plate is like a Monk that doesn&#39;t use his punch<br/>\n&gt;because &quot;Every class can punch&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, can now classify you as a powergamer, since you plainly imply that<br/>\nanyone who doesn&#39;t take the utmost advantage of the abilities of their class<br/>\nis stupid, so we should all wear plate and all use the weapon combo that<br/>\nnumericaly deals the most damage per unit time.  so in real life no one<br/>\nshould drive red cars by your logic since they function as well as any other<br/>\nand statistically get the most speeding tickets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now, if that doesn&#39;t fit YOUR image of a<br/>\n&gt;Bard, then you&#39;re more than free to take the AC hit and not wear it....<br/>\n&gt;Please don&#39;t tell those of us that do choose to wear plate that we&#39;re<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wrong,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;or aren&#39;t roleplayers.  I am roleplaying the Bard class as Verant designed<br/>\n&gt;it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never said they were wrong, in fact plainly said I don&#39;t care but I wont,<br/>\nand no you are taking the utmost advantage of the class as designed, no<br/>\neveidence you are roleplaying it just because you wear plate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>\n&gt;image of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>\n&gt;while sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;bazooka too.  Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>\n&gt;is moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard.  to me<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;image is more important than being as effective as possible.  I kinda wish<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>\n&gt;light armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>\n&gt;even equal, just better than nothing.  If not, oh well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I like the idea of having some bard specific items.  Singing swords,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>magical<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;instruments, any of these would be great!  Most of the other classes seem<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have items tailored towards them with the exception of bards.  Oh yeah sure<br/>\n&gt;we can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>\n&gt;like a monk, why would we?  It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;could make better use of than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Bard&#39;s are Jack of All trades - Borrowing from many different classes.<br/>\n&gt;We&#39;re different than monks, Monks have their own set of skills.  Ours are<br/>\n&gt;part fighter, part rogue, part magical, part of many things.  I&#39;ll use any<br/>\n&gt;weapon or skill that&#39;s available to me, that betters my class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, not much to complain about here, but by this logic shadowknights are<br/>\njust warriors mixed with necromancers, why do they have shadowknight only<br/>\nweapons?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;On most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>\n&gt;The way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>\n&gt;they should travel more than any other character.  To have to do this<br/>\n&gt;without being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>\n&gt;minstrel could bind himself anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I am wholeheartedly against Bind for Bards.  No other Hybrid gets this.<br/>\n&gt;This is reserved for the pure casters.  Yes it would be nice to have, but<br/>\n&gt;&quot;it&#39;d be nice to have a bazooka too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ummm, no other hybrid gets pick locks either, so they should probably take<br/>\nthat away too by your logic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I somewhat agreed with everything on the petition but the Bind and the Exp<br/>\n&gt;issues.  I was a little bit peeved to see the petition ask for a bonus in<br/>\n&gt;ability (Bind) that makes the class stronger, and at the same time ask for<br/>\n&gt;less of an exp hit.... We are hybrids.  Hybrids have a penalty.  We can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tank<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and cast spells with our songs.... We get a penalty in Exp for that and we<br/>\n&gt;should.  As far as soloing... Verant has always said this is a group game.<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t level any noticeably slower than my GF (High Elf Magician) who I<br/>\n&gt;group with on EVERY kill.   So in groups, as Verant designed the game, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;been my exp that we&#39;re not really disadvantaged at all.  While Bards CAN<br/>\n&gt;solo and DO solo, I believe Bards belong in a party.  If someone chooses to<br/>\n&gt;solo, then they should take the extra penalties for doing so in a group<br/>\n&gt;based game.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Best part of your piece hands down.  While I disagree on the bind issue, I<br/>\ntoo think we do not suffer from an overly large experience penalty.  I keep<br/>\nup with the human monk I most often group with and do better soloing against<br/>\nsome critters than he does.  In groups he ends up taking most of the damage<br/>\nsince he deals out so much and wears no armor to speak of.  I have not seen<br/>\nany real evidence we advance much slower than the average character,<br/>\nalthough many bards are wood elves and wood elves advance slower than<br/>\nhumans.  But then why would you want to be a human and live in some smelly<br/>\nstone city, yech!  Oops, sorry let my character run away with itself there,<br/>\nno offense intended to our human readership.<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Kitasi<br/>\n     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n      &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>\n       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>\n     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>\n        and each to his separate star...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCampaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nDiscuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
