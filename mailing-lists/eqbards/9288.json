Some<br/>\ndon&#39;t work, granted but they will eventually fix them. Some you don&#39;t have a<br/>\nuse for right this minute but who knows.  Like there I was in the Sol Ro<br/>\ntemple, getting ready to do a Lambent quest, ok I got 2 runes and they both<br/>\nsay &quot;one-eye&quot; but nuthin else. Which one is Froon and which one is Choon? So<br/>\nI used the Lyssia Catalog song (ya, the one that is so-called useless) and<br/>\nNadare has to rib me because I was reluctant to buy it when I was young and<br/>\n14pp seemed a treasure.  Some day you maybe somewhere and not have it and<br/>\nthem what?   Like you don&#39;t have a use for stamina song - fine - you are a<br/>\nsolo bard right now.  Wait til you are party bard and your war&#39;s are<br/>\nswinging their BBC&#39;s  and getting slower and slower and slower.  &quot;Excuse me<br/>\ngroup, I will selos to freeport and buy that song - I hope the boat is<br/>\nrunning today - brb.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things - my so-called grammar is what it is &quot;mine&quot; hehe and I already<br/>\nbeen yelled (to no avail) but that was a typo - should have said &quot;better for<br/>\nyou...&quot; Songs get better with age and when brand new are weaker that how<br/>\nthey work even 2 levels later. Also, at 8 you don&#39;t might the bandits or<br/>\norcs - maybe some grouped gnolls.  In you teens, you will fight at bandit,<br/>\nraider, orc and derv camps where you will want to do selective pulls. So<br/>\nmaybe not all that great right now - but it will get better for you.  You<br/>\nwill use it more and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome loot is similar.  Rustys and such - plus coin. By 15 to 20, you can get<br/>\nsnake skin armor off the captains, commanders and nobles. Paw is empty<br/>\nbecause it is too far away for beginning dungeon hunters who die too often.<br/>\nBB for loot - WK for xp - that was our motto.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnake Fang necklace (that was me) - DOES NOT cure poison - it add sv poison<br/>\n+2 (resistence - not cure) I think.  Get Snakskin tunic and gloves if you<br/>\ncan and Snakefang necklace to wear while fighting poisonous mobs.  Prolly u<br/>\ncan buy a potion in Rivervale that is cure poison.  Maybe a cleric quest<br/>\ntoo? Cant remember if you get a potion or just a cure cast on you. <br/>\n<br/>\nLament is pre-pull crowd control and a different tool than the post pull<br/>\nones like lullaby, charm and mez.  Lament will not add you to hate list<br/>\nunless it is resisted.  Yes it does wear off and then the mob is agro again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we are happy to answer your questions - I think it helps us re-think<br/>\nthings that help us do better - even if they are basic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
