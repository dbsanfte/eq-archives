AC will<br/>\nkeep you alive longer - dual wield will get you dead faster. In your early<br/>\ncareer, a single wield weapon with a shield may be lots better than dual<br/>\nwield and dieing *alot* - you can only do damage when you are alive.  And<br/>\nearly on, all instrument in a group may not be your best choice.  Just<br/>\nbecause you *can* dual wield does not mean you *must* dual wield al of the<br/>\ntime.  Bards have a great deal of flexibility so lets not limit our thinking<br/>\nto only one way of doing things: dual wield until you die.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Orb is a great shield AC 15 and very light weight.  I bought a Chitin<br/>\nshield (for 30pp? was a good deal I was on at 4am and seller was in a hurry)<br/>\nwhen I was like 14-15ish and fighting asps in East Commonlands.  Without<br/>\nthinking, I put it in a dimensional pocket.  I used to beg for dim pockets<br/>\nand spirit pouches al lthe time.  Then &lt;system message&gt; the server are<br/>\ncoming down in 5 minutes!  log out now!  And so I did. &lt;poof&gt; went my Chit<br/>\nshield.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I got 6 note blade and Yk.  But in fights with really strong mobs, if I<br/>\nmelee, I use 6 note and my shim orb.  That combo seems to moderate the<br/>\namount of attention I revieve from the mobs and my cleric does not have me<br/>\nas an additional problem to heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Papa Legba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 11, 2000 9:52 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Lambent woes....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Bards have dual wield before they can afford the item (twinks a side, I<br/>\n&gt; gues sit has value to a twink).
