When GZ says you get a &quot;dose&quot; of the song, it means<br/>\nyou get the song effect, and cannot get another dose of that<br/>\neffect (from the same bard) for another 6 seconds.  If the<br/>\nstop/start trick worked, it should in theory double the<br/>\neffectiveness of Clarity.  I found it had no effect.  The only<br/>\nother person I know who tested it found it helped by about<br/>\n30%(?), but he had bad lag and PL (in which case stop/starting<br/>\nit *would* help since it would reduce the chance of you<br/>\nexceeding a 6 second window due to lag).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do wish someone else (without lag or PL :) would test this<br/>\nthough.  I&#39;m confident in the results I got, but it&#39;d be nice<br/>\nto get someone else to verify the results.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
