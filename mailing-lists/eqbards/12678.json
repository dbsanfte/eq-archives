Level 50 over crowding is here now.  The guilds on<br/>\nInnoruuk who can do these raids and runs _do_ communicate and try to<br/>\ncoordinate.  Not withstanding there is the _Strong_ competitive spirit<br/>\nbetween them.  The members need to trust their leaders and abide to the<br/>\nagreements.   On a couple occasions, there have been one or 2 problems and<br/>\nthat&#39;s when GM&#39;s step in.  Granted - there&#39;s a lot of stuff that gets posted<br/>\nand flamed and it&#39;s usually far from what is really happening between the<br/>\nguild leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome competition is indeed healthy - a lot of cooperation will make things<br/>\nwork for everyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tReece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, January 06, 2000 3:25 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Here&#39;s a clip from the elite Innoruuk guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaveat:  It will probably be six months before I&#39;m high enough level to go<br/>\non a dragon raid so the topic of this thread has no impact on me whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpinion:  Until Verant comes up with something for all the level 50s to do,<br/>\nthis type of conflict between high level guilds on every server is gonna get<br/>\na helluva lot worse.  I can see in the near future where guilds will have to<br/>\nstart using a waiting list, schedule, etc that every guild must abide by.<br/>\nFull time GM required to make sure everyone plays by the rules (don&#39;t<br/>\nlaugh:-)  Maybe a modified version of the /yield rule for guilds??<br/>\n<br/>\nShort term solution?:  To promote a &quot;community&quot; atmosphere, why don&#39;t the<br/>\nhigh level guilds try cooperating with other guilds on a trial basis.<br/>\nPerhaps agree to limit each guild to having one full group participate.<br/>\nHave four guilds participate and you get the magic number of 24 people<br/>\nfighting the dragon that everyone seems to think is the best number to<br/>\nhandle lag. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Wonder how many of the players who act the way mentioned below, no<br/>\nmatter what guild they are in, fall into the stereotype category of<br/>\n&quot;powergamer&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \tTo many, such practices seem &quot;elitist&quot;.  I can definitely<br/>\n&gt; understand why someone would think that, some of my guildmates do act with<br/>\n&gt; that kind of attitude.  But there IS a logical reason for not inviting<br/>\n&gt; outside people, in addition to the fact that inter-guild co-ordination is<br/>\n&gt; alot of work.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
