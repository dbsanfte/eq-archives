Last night made level 28 and ran right out to play<br/>\nwith my new charm song.<br/>\n  I mean visions of Sand Giants dropping at my feet ! Now Moonflower<br/>\nBllue on Cazic-Thule is no fool. You don&#39;t get to level 28 without<br/>\nlearning something and not only that she has been reading this list<br/>\nsince nearly the beginning and even formulated it into her text for<br/>\nbeginning Bard&#39;s, &quot;Guns and Roses&quot;. But this time James, John Gregg and<br/>\nthe boys have not come through. You left out the critical information on<br/>\nkey board set up. Moon decided to practice with Lesser Fey Orcs and<br/>\nspiders. Hot Keys on the Number pad bottom row read &quot;pet attack&quot;, &quot;Pet<br/>\nguard me&quot; and &quot;Pet back off&quot;, the second row was #4 Charm, #5 Selos and<br/>\n#6 ...&quot;Train Coming&quot; I think.<br/>\n  F1,F1 to call up pet and Num Lock to auto run and mouse to steer.<br/>\n<br/>\n She practiced and practiced. She found usually Charm would last 2 to 3<br/>\nrounds , some times 4 but hunting and pecking , hands crossing... I mean<br/>\nif they had been Sand Giants she be level 27 in a heart beat. <br/>\nGetting a pet is no problem. Praying you bogus &quot;Sand Giant&quot; AKA Orc<br/>\nCenturion at your side keeps his cool while you fumble with targeting<br/>\nanother SG Cent ( the target SG is lost because your on auto run getting<br/>\nthe first SG as a pet) &quot;aim, click, keypad 1, F1,F1 OUCH !!! sucker hit<br/>\nme !! ,aim, click, Charm, charm, aim, click on target, key pad 1 attack,<br/>\nf1, f1, Charm... &quot;hummm, why isn&#39;t pet attacking ?&quot;... ok, Pet guard me.<br/>\nRun near target... whooooaa, forgot to turn on Selos !!! OUCH OUCH OUCH<br/>\n!!! Thank heavens they are green Cents ! What the !!! 2 bubbles gone ?<br/>\nTarget Cent has a name ? Chief !!!... Run song...<br/>\n<br/>\n   And so it goes.<br/>\n   It would be really instructive if one of you gentlemen could take me<br/>\nand other readers on a walk thru as above on what keys and what you do<br/>\nto make use Charm successful. It is the most difficult task Moonflower<br/>\nhas met yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
