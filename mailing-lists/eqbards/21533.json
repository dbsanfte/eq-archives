It worked wonderfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when our group moved to Frontier Mountains to tackle Mountain<br/>\nGiants, I&#39;d try to Pixie if we got more than one pull but it would never<br/>\nwork.  I got some strange message to the effect of:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot mesmerize this creature (not with this spell)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was on a blue Mountain Giant Hillock - they Charm easily enough.  Now,<br/>\nI know there&#39;s not a level limit on the song but is there a size limit?  ie.<br/>\ndoes it work on large creatures?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a brighter note, I dinged into 30 and got a Forest Loop, so I&#39;m happy.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
