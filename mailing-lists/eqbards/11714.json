Most of the time those do not come alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve dont the Lord with just one group of 45+ - 1 cleric, 1 bard, 1 <br/>\nenchanter, and some tanks.

Maybe score <br/>\nsome 1mbru3d! (at least). I&#39;m just worried about the new patrollers that <br/>\nroam into the gate-point. It&#39;s bad enough that half the stuff you pull will <br/>\ntake the scenic route to get to you (especially the stupid revultant rats) <br/>\npulling mass trains of friends to you along the way.

I&#39;m thinking a cleric with Rune IV that Auras when the rune runs out <br/>\nmay work.
