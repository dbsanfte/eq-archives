I thought all of our songs <br/>\nhad the same duration of 18 seconds before and that charm lasted 18 seconds <br/>\nprior to the patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I notice that after I charm a creature, I can have 3 pulses of selo&#39;s <br/>\nbefore charm wears off. Do you think that they meant that charm&#39;s duration <br/>\nwas increased from 18 secs to 24 secs?<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, checking my logs (should have done that before) I can see that my <br/>\ncharm sometimes last as long as 23 secs, so I think their message was <br/>\nindeed incorrect and our new charm duration is approximately 24 secs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to thank the many bards who put in their suggestions of <br/>\nlengthening the duration of the bard song. I made the same suggestion and <br/>\nwas pleasantly surprised to hear that a lot of other bards had the same <br/>\nidea. This will help those who are in groups reacquire the target. It <br/>\ndefinitely helps us higher level solo bards sit and med a bit so that we <br/>\ncan charm kite longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
