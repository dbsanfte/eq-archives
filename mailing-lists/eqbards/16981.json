I was referring to casters who ran back and forth or in<br/>\ncircles expecting you to get the mob off him.  If the caster<br/>\nwants the mob off him, and he&#39;s not SoWed/mob is not snared,<br/>\nhe&#39;ll take just as much damage running around as he would<br/>\nstanding still.  Once you realize that, then it becomes a<br/>\nsimple problem of maximizing the ability of the other party<br/>\nmembers to get the mob off you; and the best way to do that is<br/>\nto stand still and back off in small increments.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we took on the Maestro with 36 people.  When he<br/>\nfirst got to us, somehow all the casters simultaneously<br/>\ndecided to nuke, and he was ping-ponged for about 1 minute.  <br/>\nHe took virtually no melee damage during that time, and<br/>\nbasically healed up all spell damage he took by using his AE<br/>\nlifetap on the melee folks trying to chase him.  The battle<br/>\ntook an excessively long time (about 5-6 minutes).  Clerics<br/>\nwho had gone OOM were shouting requests for heals for group<br/>\nmembers.  Towards the end a spite golem joined in, and it with<br/>\nthe Maestro wiped us out as all the clerics were OOM.  Only 2<br/>\npeople managed to camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake two.  30 minutes later, down to 32 people.  This time we<br/>\nasked the casters to hold off for a minute to prevent the ping<br/>\nponging.  We pulled the Maestro, the melee folks started<br/>\nwhacking, a minute later the casters nuked (and the Maestro<br/>\ndidn&#39;t budge), and about 3 minutes later the Maestro was dead.  <br/>\nZero casualties, not a single shouted request for heals from<br/>\nOOM clerics, and the clerics in my group finished at 60% and<br/>\n80% mana.  It was obscene how much better we did by simply<br/>\nletting the tanks hit the target.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
