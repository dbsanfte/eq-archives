I&#39;m don&#39;t grasp the concept you&#39;re stating <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with just the formula.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think I understand this now, and I believe we already have the <br/>\n&gt;answer.  The previous exp penalty is not actually a penalty perse, by <br/>\n&gt;this I mean that there is no actual exp being docked per kill.  Bards <br/>\n&gt;would actually physically need 1400 exp points to level, rather than <br/>\n&gt;1000.  Check with the people running ShowEQ to be sure.  The amount <br/>\n&gt;of EXP their character is receiving is the same regardless of class.  <br/>\n&gt;The EXP Bar is just larger.  Also, the way VI is introducing this <br/>\n&gt;change is extremelly and confusing if they&#39;re using one table <br/>\n&gt;and &quot;knocking off&quot; experience based on the classes.  Plus, I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;see clearly how they (pre-patch) would divide the experience based <br/>\n&gt;off how much experience you have, i.e. a Bard at level 40 would have <br/>\n&gt;more than a Cleric at level 40.  From your suggestion, the Bard would <br/>\n&gt;actually have the exact same amount, but it would have come from more <br/>\n&gt;kills.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If this is what you mean by the exp penalty COULD have been moved, <br/>\n&gt;then I am confident that it&#39;s not.  I&#39;m pretty sure that they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt;using seperate tables for each class/race combination rather than 1 <br/>\n&gt;overall table by all the other evidence available to us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
