There  <br/>\n&gt; happened to be a<br/>\n&gt; 50+ necro in the room camping for Borxx (she needed the lens <br/>\n&gt; and nerves for<br/>\n&gt; a quest).  Well sure enough, BOrxx popped, and I had had the <br/>\n&gt; good sense to<br/>\n&gt; mem Mystic Shielding.  Out of about 7 or 8 casts on me, Borxx <br/>\n&gt; only got one<br/>\n&gt; to stick :o)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and that&#39;s the totallity of my Mystic Shield experience ;o)~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=B=-<br/>\n&gt; 41.something<br/>\n&gt; The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
