It was not a very happy<br/>\nexperience for me but I did learn some valuable lessons:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tYou need a good group to go to hard places.<br/>\n2.\tUnrest is a hard place.<br/>\n3.\tYour group needs a serious healer.<br/>\n4.\tStrange stuff happens - deal with it!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt cost me my life several times to learn those lessons.  At lo 20&#39;s we&#39;d<br/>\nhug the wall and try to pull from the house.  The &quot;yard trash&quot; is plentiful<br/>\nand aggressive at that level.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy level 25, I had gotten into &quot;the good regular group&quot; - we were co-level,<br/>\nwell balanced class wise and had an excellent cleric.  We were able to take<br/>\nand hold both the Barroom (2nd floor) and the Knight Room (3rd floor) and we<br/>\nhad a much happier time there.  Mid 20&#39;s prolly can&#39;t hold the barroom if<br/>\nthe knight room is not camped.  But it usually is so if the barroom is open<br/>\n- go for it.  No matter what - weird things happen - the hags cast thru the<br/>\nfloor and you take damage when they are fiting above you.  You get occasion<br/>\nvisit from the upstairs mobs so you may even see the knight appear in the<br/>\nbarroom.  By 27, you will welcome this sight! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the normal boss in the barroom is the unded-barkeep.  He is the one you<br/>\nseek. You will need to be in a lo to mid 20&#39;s group for success in than<br/>\nroom.  You can work your way up by joining the groups that park along the<br/>\noutside wall and pull things from the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and have fun,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 29th song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, September 30, 1999 3:04 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Unrest<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roleplay@...\">roleplay@...</a>&gt; (by way of Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHaving just obtained the 20th song for a bard I am getting<br/>\nthat wonder lust<br/>\n\t\tfeeling again.
