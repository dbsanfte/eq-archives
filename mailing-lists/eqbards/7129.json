I have been in several<br/>\n&gt; groups there fighting for the last 3-4 nights.  While I have never grouped<br/>\n&gt; with a bard while there, I have paired up (fighting in a group of 2) with<br/>\n&gt; several different classes.  Namely, A Druid, A Shaman, A Paladin, A Ranger,<br/>\n&gt; and a Necromancer.  In each of these cases I have had a problem that I as a<br/>\n&gt; bard have never run into.  I was unable to taunt Aviaks off my partner.  For<br/>\n&gt; once I would be the one ending battle with most of my health, while my<br/>\n&gt; partner was near death.  This is nice but unsetteling.  Even with Lullabye I<br/>\n&gt; would have a terrible time trying to get my share of dammage.  I think that<br/>\n&gt; some of this is because at 20th level I am getting a lot of resists from<br/>\n&gt; Darters and Rooks.  But it cant be just that.  So I think that there is some<br/>\n&gt; other reason that Im not getting mobed as much.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The possible answer to this is faction. If the extra mob hate for bards<br/>\nis done intentionally by Verant, it&#39;s possible they base it on faction.<br/>\nAs it&#39;s been noted the Avaiks have no faction it&#39;s also possible they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been programmed to hate any factions either. I would say if you<br/>\ntook away the magic thing that makes bards and bard songs the top hated<br/>\nthing by mobs you would probably rarely end up at the top of their hate<br/>\nlist by your own efforts, as you would rarely if ever do more damage<br/>\nthan anyone else in your party. Even the benefits of the heal song would<br/>\nbe quickly eclipsed by the first heal cast by a cleric/druid/shaman of<br/>\nyour level.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
