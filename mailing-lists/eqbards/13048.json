Even though a ranger<br/>\nmight get better use out of a sharkjaw cutlass than a bard, if<br/>\nhe&#39;s only planning on using it to trade, he&#39;s the same as a<br/>\ncaster on the priority list.  After that, we consider when the<br/>\nrecipient last got a special item, how rare the item is (i.e.<br/>\nis this something we&#39;d want to keep in the guild for when<br/>\nsomeone of the right level might find it useful - e.g. my<br/>\nsceptre of rahotep), level of the recipient, whether that item<br/>\nrepresents the &quot;best&quot; item possibly obtainable for a class (so<br/>\na druid would probably have a higher priority than melee<br/>\nclasses on a runed falchion), and any other factors.  None of<br/>\nthese rules are set in stone too, which sometimes leads to<br/>\nlengthy discussion or us deferring the decision until a later<br/>\ndate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, if the low level person actually helped kill the mob,<br/>\nthey can get the item.  OTOH, the vast majority of the time,<br/>\nthe item will be lottoed as trade material before it&#39;s used to<br/>\n&quot;twink.&quot;  (And most of the folks in my guild seem to feel as I<br/>\ndo that twinking puts you into a doldrum for a many levels<br/>\nwhere you have zero chance of improving that equipment.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy EBW was kind of a special case because I got the maid tooth<br/>\nplaying on my own.  If we&#39;d gotten it as a guild, it probably<br/>\nwould&#39;ve gone to a ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
