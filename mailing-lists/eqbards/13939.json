This<br/>\nadded a Haste component to the pet that the warrior apparently did not have.<br/>\nAbashi rightly said that either the warrior should have been Hasted or the<br/>\npet should not have been equipped with daggers for that test.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; No, Abashi is correct on this point.  A L49 pet requires words<br/>\n&gt; and components which are very rare and difficult to obtain -<br/>\n&gt; roughly as difficult as or rarer than equipment like the FBSS.<br/>\n&gt; A lot of the high level mages and necros are using lower level<br/>\n&gt; pets because they simply haven&#39;t obtained the items needed for<br/>\n&gt; their higher level pet spells.  So the correct comparison is<br/>\n&gt; between L49 pet and L49 warrior with equipment typical for<br/>\n&gt; that level.  (Actually, the correct comparison would be L49<br/>\n&gt; necro and L49 pet vs L49 warrior.  We&#39;re already being<br/>\n&gt; massively conservative comparing the warrior to just the pet.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
