It doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to be breaking early anymore (except rarely).  In fact, I don&#39;t get the<br/>\nbreak message until it would normally expire, even when root is cast after<br/>\nchains.  Also, when I rechain after root is cast, chains does not seem to<br/>\nbreak root anymore, either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s hard for me to test this out further as the root I&#39;m working with is<br/>\na Mage pet&#39;s root, but here&#39;s what I&#39;m noticing:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When mob is fleeing (experienced this in Karnors), pet roots and the mob<br/>\nturns around to attack.  Obviously, we can&#39;t have this :p so I chain.  Mob<br/>\nstays facing the party like it&#39;s still rooted.  It doesn&#39;t even turn around<br/>\nfor a second (like if the pet had rooted immediately after I chained) and I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen a 2nd root message.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else noticing any of this?  And, anyone else with access to a more<br/>\nstandard root willing to test?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If root and chains are in fact stacking, I&#39;m not sure if this is a plus or<br/>\nnot.  I am always grouped with a mage, so the pet used to kill chains ALOT.<br/>\nIt&#39;s kinda nice to keep the slowdown effect while it&#39;s rooted, but I&#39;d like<br/>\nto see the mob stand there patiently trying to run away, too. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n&gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt; Closing on 50!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Want to make money in the stock market without losing a penny?
