Simply put, probability is in<br/>\n&gt; favor of more successful attack resolutions with more speed.

Say you have two weapons, one is<br/>\n10 damage 20 delay, the other is 5 damage 10 delay (i.e. same<br/>\ndamage ratio).  Say you are fighting for 60 seconds, and the<br/>\nchance of your dual wield going of is 20%.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the slow weapon in your off hand, it will make a<br/>\ndual wield check every 2 seconds, for a total of 30 checks.<br/>\n20% of those will succeed, resulting in 6 attacks.  At 10<br/>\ndamage, that works out to 60 damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have the fast weapon in your off hand, it will make a<br/>\ndual wield check every 1 second, for a total of 60 checks.<br/>\n20% of those will succeed, resulting in 12 attacks.

Ignoring for the moment that max damage is<br/>\n(2*dam+1), if two weapons have identical damage/delay ratios,<br/>\nit does not matter which one you put in your off hand, faster <br/>\nor slower.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
