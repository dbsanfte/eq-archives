Water <br/>\nbreathing?  I sure don&#39;t, due to the feeble ranges on these songs... anyhow <br/>\nI would love to have Die Zauberfl´┐¢te even if it does nothing more than give <br/>\nbetter song sprites, or allow females to dance (my heart goes out to them).<br/>\n<br/>\nA magic lute would doubtless be deemed too powerful, as it might allow us to <br/>\n(gasp!) do more damage or heal better.  Never mind that there are dozens of <br/>\nitems that raise mana for casters, effectively making them better at dealing <br/>\ndamage or healing...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I foresee is this: to still the slowly rising tide of complaints from <br/>\nbards who feel that they have fewer class-specific items than any other <br/>\nclass, Verant will introduce a new brass instrument, the Giant&#39;s Ear Horn.  <br/>\nIt weighs 20.0, adds 1% to all brass-based songs, and also gives +5 mana.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s dropped by a new named 64th level giant in North Karana named Tinear <br/>\n(rare drop on a rare spawn), and has the side effect of increasing all <br/>\nmonster&#39;s aggro radius by 10% around you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\njust a tad bit cynical about Verant&#39;s support of bards - great class, loads <br/>\nof fun despite being the redheaded stepchild of EQ = )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
