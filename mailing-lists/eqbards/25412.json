This is for my DE wiz btw, not my bard. My evil cleric hubby talked me<br/>\ninto doing the Coldain Shawl quest and I will need high tailoring for that.<br/>\nDE&#39;s don&#39;t get cultural tailoring so that left velious for the higher skill<br/>\nlevels. The fact that she may be able to make some pps while hunting is a<br/>\nplus, maybe I can make a dent in the +5k pp deficit the trade skill work up<br/>\nfor this quest has cost me. One further question: you mention the Chief<br/>\nbeing L60,  but about what level are the other dogs? I have yet to go get<br/>\nthe CS tooth for my wiz so haven&#39;t been able to con anything in CS. I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to get non kos to dragons so I can start her Giant Bane spell quest<br/>\nin the near future. Dwarvves already think &quot;you&#39;re one of the most highly<br/>\nreguarded dark elves&quot;, lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe, 58 bard and silk collector extrordinaire!<br/>\nBrilinia Iliside 48 wiz who&#39;s spent way too much time combining things<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
