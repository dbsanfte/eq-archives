Say you have two monsters standing near each <br/>\nother (like the orcs at the front gate of Crushbone) and you&#39;d like to <br/>\nfight them one at a time.  You edge up towards them, targeting one with the <br/>\nLament and trying it until you get close enough for it to go off. When you <br/>\nsee the &quot;looks sad&quot; message, quickly run up close enough to get the other <br/>\nmonster&#39;s attention and then back away again.  The &quot;sad&quot; monster won&#39;t <br/>\nchase you, if everything worked right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis of course works much better with a group, where you can lull one <br/>\nmonster and have someone throw a spell at the second one.  Far less chance <br/>\nof accidentally picking up both of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong, bard on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
