They train up like they work for Amtrak.<br/>\nSol A and Runnyeye are the worst, Permafrost isn&#39;t quite so bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been in bad pickup groups, but I have died and left<br/>\nempty-handed every time I&#39;ve tried to fight in Sol A as a bard.  So far I&#39;ve<br/>\nmade excursion there three separate times for vambrace and boot items and<br/>\nthere&#39;s usually just about 12 people in the zone, half of them resting from<br/>\nSol B.  I have yet to even get to the spawn locations for these items.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a strong guild, so getting them together for this sort of thing<br/>\njust isn&#39;t possible.  So every once in a while I cruise to Sol A and ask if<br/>\nanyone is fighting in there and need a bard.  So far no luck.  Just another<br/>\ncouple of empty-handed deaths and a run back to Cazic-Thule where the<br/>\ncoordinated people seem to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 32nd song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Oh thank god,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     After being the world&#39;s poorest bard for 22 levels, I must<br/>\n&gt; say that I have found the greatest place I have ever been for<br/>\n&gt; experience and cash.  If any of you level 30 and under bards are<br/>\n&gt; in need of a fun time and a good place, I would suggest Solusek&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Eye.  In the last week, I have gone from level 22 to almost 25,<br/>\n&gt; and made about 1400pp (no kidding - I know you big guys are<br/>\n&gt; saying ~yawn~, but I&#39;ve never had more than 100pp in the bank<br/>\n&gt; hehe).  I am now the proud owner of 2 Obsidian Scimitars, a<br/>\n&gt; drakescale belt, a pair of Kobold hide boots, and an obsidian shard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     My guild and I have been exploring the place for a week now<br/>\n&gt; and we love it!  Of course, we&#39;ve only gotten as far as the<br/>\n&gt; Foreman&#39;s room but we&#39;ll get a little further after a while.  Our<br/>\n&gt; group was myself, a 25 rogue, a 25 monk, a 27 ranger, a 26<br/>\n&gt; paladin, and a 26 warrior.  So far I&#39;ve only died once, which is<br/>\n&gt; incredible for me.  Hell, I died getting there (forgot to check<br/>\n&gt; the time and ran smack through the middle of Kithicor at 1 am --<br/>\n&gt; you writhe in pain....LOADING, PLEASE WAIT).  I have yet to see a<br/>\n&gt; champion or a mage other than on the ranger&#39;s tracking, but we<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t gotten that direction yet.  We will, poppa needs some<br/>\n&gt; brand new shoes and sleeves, as soon as we level a few more times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Anyway, just a suggestion for those of you who are looking<br/>\n&gt; for a nice place to hunt.  Although you&#39;ll need a good group, the<br/>\n&gt; place is a blast so far.  There are lots of &quot;safe&quot; places to pull<br/>\n&gt; to once you fight your way to them, most are right next to Sol B<br/>\n&gt; zone lines.  And so far, I&#39;ve encountered no warping bugs for<br/>\n&gt; MOBS, and no Z-Axis problems, I have no trouble using Lullaby at<br/>\n&gt; all.  It has saved our asses more than once, I know one time we<br/>\n&gt; pulled a fire gob shaman, 2 flame gobs, and 2 cinder gobs when<br/>\n&gt; Singe showed up!  We barely eeked that one out, but damn it felt good!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to ramble on, I&#39;m just in awe of this place!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Weiland &lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S. Of course you know that as soon as I post this I&#39;m going to<br/>\n&gt; go back and die there 25 times tonight, Murphy&#39;s Law.
