I like playing EQ tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nTopic was why did Harmonic chide Sylly for 50pp and Estella<br/>\nfor 75pp for elfhide gloves.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) When you are level 19 (which I was) you don&#39;t just throw <br/>\n   out 50pp or more on something like that.  Hell, you are<br/>\n   lucky to make 25pp on a hard working night.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) People who claim that plat is worthless, and that making<br/>\n   a couple hundred pp is no big deal are full of it.  That&#39;s<br/>\n   that traditional level 35+ person talking.  Refer to earlier<br/>\n   comment on my level at the time.  You don&#39;t make that much<br/>\n   money if you are a lower level adventurer.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I&#39;ve seen those gloves sell for 35pp to 45pp, in fact people<br/>\n   are willing to hand those gloves out at no cost sometimes!<br/>\n   I like to deal the price down on anything I buy, I don&#39;t just<br/>\n   throw plat at people for good items.<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, I bought elfhide gloves from a friend of mine last<br/>\nweek for 75pp.  She needed the money, and you know what?  I had<br/>\nthe money.  For once in my poor EQ career, I was starting to earn<br/>\nmoney.  Anyone under level 25 can appreciate that... you won&#39;t <br/>\nmake money until you are around level 30 or so.  All the people<br/>\nwho claim to make mad money are all over level 25 - there is no<br/>\ntrick to it.  Level = Money.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also bought two star ruby golden rings (300pp total - killer deal)<br/>\nYes, because I had the money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t play me off as some cheap bastard like I was 11 levels ago,<br/>\nwhen I was lucky to make 10pp a night.  I&#39;m pulling down around<br/>\n50pp a night or so and I&#39;m happy as a clam to spend my money. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
