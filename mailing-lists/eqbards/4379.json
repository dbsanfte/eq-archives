How in the world is a discussion of which weapons <br/>\n     are good for bards off topic???  Lets not get carried away here.  True <br/>\n     the twinking/lottery thread was way OT but lets not let that scare us <br/>\n     off of talking about stuff that is useful to all of us, especially <br/>\n     those of us under 20 who rely on this list for advice to avoid making <br/>\n     painful errors.  If I hadn&#39;t joined this list I might still be singing <br/>\n     one song at a time...  )  <br/>\n     <br/>\n     For example I asked if Bronze Armor stopped more damage then banded <br/>\n     over and above the AC increase. (which is very modest compared to its <br/>\n     weight.)  Not one answer.  This is a relevant Bard topic because we <br/>\n     can&#39;t afford to put all our extra points into Strength and the <br/>\n     decision to wear Bronze plate is a tough one.

The WB <br/>\nRapier is 6 dam 23 delay, but no stat bonuses and wieghs over twice as much. <br/>\n  Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>\nconsidering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  The Dirk, IMO, is the most <br/>\nunbalanced weapon in the game.
