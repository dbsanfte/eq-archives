I simply cannot tell you how happy I am, btw, that we have charm<br/>\nback again. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Songs:<br/>\nSelos51 is broken of course, you get invis/see invis/lev but no speed. <br/>\nEverything sees invis anyhow but trust me, you&#39;ll want lev.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to the good stuff:<br/>\nOur armor is Singing Steel, neon green plate - like Hero Bracer type green<br/>\nnot drab ranger green.  Yes Tork is sporting Singing Steel and loving it.<br/>\n;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNew weapons!  New graphics!  LOTS of new stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nI got dawnchaser (first one on Nameless) this weekend, last night I got a<br/>\nnear godly piercing weapon: Sacrdioan&#39;s (sp) Partisan!  That time spent<br/>\nwith the ol&#39; obsidian shard to get to 200 was worth it - I&#39;m a regular<br/>\npigsticker with the new shoulder armor... um nevermind... =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Tork@Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend online invitations with Yahoo!
