Since both tunes<br/>\nare in the compilation, both effects are present.Since this is a game, and<br/>\nnot real life, we don&#39;t have the option of linking the songs to make musical<br/>\nsense. But we can view the bard as having done so in the game. We just have<br/>\nto deal with the odd implementation in RL(i.e. alternating buttons, vice a<br/>\nlinked string of different tunes).<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, you could imagine that using two songs together is actually a third,<br/>\ntotally different song with a melody, and countermelody. I know I&#39;ve sung<br/>\nchoral tunes with this structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of options for viewing juggling in an RP sense, rather than<br/>\njust a game mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristian Leitzen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Kristian Leitzen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kleit@...\">kleit@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am also a RL musician, and i don&#39;t think that anyone, no matter what<br/>\n&gt; you try to say on here, sings one verse of one song, then one verse of<br/>\n&gt; another song, then the second verse of the first song, then the second<br/>\n&gt; verse of the second song, etc.  if you do then you are annoying the<br/>\n&gt; hell out of everybody.  this is what i mean when i say that a bard<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t do it.  a bard is proud of his singing and wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; appear foolish even if it did boost his stats.  this is all IMHO by the<br/>\n&gt; way.  everyone is free to their own opinion.<br/>\n&gt; Olczyk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_witcraft@...\">dean_witcraft@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, May 14, 1999 12:50 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] juggling justified<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_witcraft@...\">dean_witcraft@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The juggling is EXACTLY what I do as a RL solo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; club musician.  It isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the song that continues when you stop singing.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the EFFECT that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; song has on you.  When I sing a sad song, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; listener doesn&#39;t stop feeling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sad immediately after I stop singing.  It&#39;s this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *effect* that carries over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into the next song.  If the next song is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; toe-tapper, the audience may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still feel a little sad for a while even as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start tapping.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
