From my direct experience, Warriors were<br/>\n&gt;&gt; way less whiny than Druids and Necros were, most Warriors I started out<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with back in March picked the more direct route of just not playing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Warriors any more (for real, not just threatened to)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  This isn&#39;t an attack against younger people, however look at the<br/>\n&gt;  average age of druids/necros.  Druids/Necros are two of the most<br/>\n&gt;  powerful solo&#39;ing classes in the game (the powerleveler&#39;s dream<br/>\n&gt;  if you will).  It&#39;s only fitting that those immature very young<br/>\n&gt;  powergaming types, a stereotype of both classes mind you, would<br/>\n&gt;  whine much like a child who just had his lollipop taken from him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Younger people (&lt; 16 yr old) need and want attention, and in EQ<br/>\n&gt;  the majority of the attention comes when you are powerful (with<br/>\n&gt;  items or level).  I think both these classes represent the power<br/>\n&gt;  of the game to those people.  Just my take on it, and this clearly<br/>\n&gt;  doesn&#39;t fit all the players, as I know we have 12 yr old Bards and<br/>\n&gt;  I know some 30 yr old Necros.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shop for your Valentine at eGroups.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine6\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/SparksValentine6</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
