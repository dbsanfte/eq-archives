The leader agreed and upon arriving to the<br/>\nLord group I realised I knew 3 of the people there very well. All former<br/>\nguild mates so I knew I was in good hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was already dual wielding Yaks after some fine fortune on friday evening,<br/>\nI offered my sharkjaw Cutlass for a Yak and the guy accepted. I was so<br/>\npleased, no I deal out a modest amount of dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpent 8 hours at the Lord camp sunday, made 2 bubs exp and hit level 38<br/>\n(yet another useless song). Only died once and that was because the Lord<br/>\nwas too hard. Wiped all but 2 of us out (they gated out). Another group<br/>\nwatched us die and didn&#39;t help, hoping they would get the kill but our<br/>\ncleric was bound next to the Lord room and managed to get the exp for us.<br/>\nIn total we saw 2 Yaks and 6 SSB&#39;s. I lost every single roll &lt;sigh&gt; I never<br/>\nrolled higher than a 62, what is wrong with me???<br/>\n<br/>\nSpent 10 hours in magi on saturday and he only spawned twice (no smr). Made<br/>\n3 bubs here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, good weekend for me, I made 5 bubs exp total, and got my second<br/>\nYak. I am so pleased.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 38 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt; on 11/02/2000 01:21:38<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: John Senior/M&G)<br/>\nSubject:  Re: [eqbards] Executioner Hood vs BI Crown<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh now a days it&#39;s by far late 30&#39;s early 40s.
