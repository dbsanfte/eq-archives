I think it is an interesting observation of the<br/>\neffectiveness of the classes, and population, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;friends/guild&quot; issue is really a non-starter.  It&#39;s obvious that your<br/>\nfriends will want to group with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever there&#39;s a lot of issues at play.  For bards, the pre-/post- 32 issue<br/>\nis a major factor.  I think someone here complained of grouping at 30.  Once<br/>\nyou get the Clarity song - it&#39;s a huge difference.  We KNOW that caster<br/>\nheavy groups will want a bard in the group - especially if there&#39;s no<br/>\nenchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother factor is the quality of the player.  Beyond &quot;friends&quot; if you know<br/>\nhow to effectively play a bard (and if you&#39;re reading this list odds you<br/>\nare).  &quot;Reputation&quot; comes to play here.  Someone playing a bard who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what they&#39;re doing can be dangerous to a group.  This may be less true<br/>\nfor other classes.  (Also your guild&#39;s rep may come into play as well)<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming a relatively busy zone (i.e. when there are 13 people in zone -<br/>\nthere&#39;s a chance there are 2 full groups only) I rarely have trouble getting<br/>\ninto groups with my 48 bard.  In Burning Woods the other night - I shouted<br/>\nfor a group - and got five invites - now three were overlaps in the same<br/>\ngroup - but basically there were three groups that wanted me.  Hard to judge<br/>\nin my case how much was desire for a bard vs. desire for ME - while I had no<br/>\n&quot;Friends&quot; per se - there were a number of people I had previously grouped<br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly - I hear of Druids from guild, for example complaining about<br/>\ndifficulty of getting into groups in certain zones.  Part of that is the<br/>\nnumber of Druids.  I have been in Karnor - and seen 3 or 4 yelling for<br/>\ngroups.  Most of the time you only want one in your group - or perhaps the<br/>\ngroup filled up.  So I argue it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t want a Druid in<br/>\nKarnor - it&#39;s that - they already have one (or two!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

If you are an<br/>\nenchanter or cleric or several of the other &quot;we gotta have that&quot; classes you<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to know anybody cause everyone wants you in their group.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
