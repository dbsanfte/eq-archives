You can imagine how pissed off I was when I <br/>\n&gt; lost exp after<br/>\n&gt; the fight. Why? You ask.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, his pet killed me, causing me to die from a NPC, which <br/>\n&gt; also is the<br/>\n&gt; same as dieing via a normal mob. The duel was void and I lost <br/>\n&gt; 1/2 bub exp<br/>\n&gt; (this was back at level 29 or so, he was 31). So, I must stress, NEVER<br/>\n&gt; fight a mage in a duel because if you die you can kiss <br/>\n&gt; goodbye to your exp<br/>\n&gt; (if the pet gets the last hit and kills you). </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
