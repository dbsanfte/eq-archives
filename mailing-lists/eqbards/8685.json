I don&#39;t mean to gripe (well, yes I<br/>\n&gt;do ;p ), but have any of them taken a look at the armor and 1H Slash lists<br/>\n&gt;at Allakhazam&#39;s site?  Just go by and look at all the nifty Ranger-only<br/>\n&gt;items there.  Gosh, let&#39;s see... how many bard-only weapons are listed<br/>\n&gt;there?  NONE :oP  Bard only armor (pre-patch) 1, and that&#39;s from PoF.<br/>\n&gt;Ranger&#39;s have no room to gripe.  Period.  (IMO)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I spent my evening last night with my druid taxiing a ranger friend around <br/>\nso he could get his new armor.  He got both bracers and the sleeves.  I saw <br/>\nthe stats for these pieces myself.  On the bracers and sleeves, AC and <br/>\nweight are the same as rubicite (which is what he was replacing) plus stat <br/>\nbonuses.  The ivy etched armor is VERY nice stat-wise (I don&#39;t like how it <br/>\nlooks though).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it appears that Verant forgot to add boots and pants for the <br/>\nrangers, the rest of the gear is nothing to complain about.  I suppose those <br/>\nthat are complaining are the ones that would gripe  regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the question on lambent stones, I saw one being auctioned last night <br/>\nin Kithicor. (this was on Povar)  I was a bit sceptical, since my <br/>\nunderstanding is that the components needed for these quests are all no <br/>\ndrop/lore.  Nary a hg or griffon did I see all evening while we ran all over <br/>\nNorrath and back.  I am hoping lambent stones don&#39;t turn out to be a rare <br/>\nitem.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
