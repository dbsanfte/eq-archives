The combo of<br/>\ncharm plus speed faster then sow is pretty overpowered.  Post 40th bards<br/>\nslowly start losing power till 53 with Song of Twilight.  With SoT you can<br/>\nsolo anything in the game that this song will stick on.  The only place<br/>\nbards are really weak is in raid situations, in areas with 54+ mobs, or when<br/>\ngrouped with an Enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for DDD it is great for duels as very few people expect a bard to<br/>\nsuddenly let loose with a nice nuke like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I am surprised the VI has not added mana usage to 27th lvl charm<br/>\nto balance it.  It is a hideously power song :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 21, 2001 10:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:20 AM 2/21/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;all I can say is (excuse my language) what a fucking joke. 10 points per<br/>\n&gt;level above level 45?
