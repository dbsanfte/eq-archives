First, I want to make one point: most deaths occur 2 to 3 zones from<br/>\nthe bind point.  In cases where the character reloads more than 3 zones<br/>\naway, there is generally a safe bind point within 3 zones where the player<br/>\ncould have been bound.  I recognize that there are some few zones -- all in<br/>\nthe South of Antonica -- where safe binding points are farther away, but in<br/>\nalmost all cases the above is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: Yes, I know, everyone has a sob story about dying 17 zones away from<br/>\ntheir bind point when they couldn&#39;t get a bind in Highpass/Rivervale/Erudin,<br/>\nbut those are rare exceptions.  I have never had any trouble getting bound<br/>\nwhere I need to with a little patience, good humor, and a little cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith those points made, I believe that Verant gave magic-users and priests<br/>\nthe ability to bind anywhere because making the 2 - 3 zone run to fetch a<br/>\ncorpse can be darn near impossible.  Magic-users are roughly 40% less<br/>\neffective in melee combat because of their reduced OFF/DEF, and priests are<br/>\ndown 20%, and neither group has any special melee attacks like the melee<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving played a wizard up to the mid-teens before becoming a full-time bard,<br/>\nI can tell you how hard it can be for a naked wizard to handle a tough blue<br/>\nthat has latched onto you when you are making the run-of-shame to your<br/>\ncorpse -- and this is with the best root and DD spells in the business.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a melee class, the run is an inconvenience, but without nearly as much<br/>\nrisk, as you can either outrun any problems that may arise (bards), hide and<br/>\nsneak from them (rogues), or have enough varied attacks that do not rely<br/>\nupon weapons alone that you can defend yourself adequately (warriors, monks,<br/>\net.al.).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument I make is that there is a compelling need for magic-users and<br/>\npriests to be able to bind and bind anywhere.  That need is not present for<br/>\nfighters and hybrids; rather, it would simply be a convenient ability to<br/>\nhave.     <br/>\n<br/>\nWith all the work that Verant has done to balance the various classes, I do<br/>\nnot believe that one can reasonably expect them to make this major change to<br/>\nthe game without a compelling need.  I believe that it is also important to<br/>\nconsider the outcry Verant would get from the seven classes that can bind if<br/>\nthey let everyone bind.  Can&#39;t you already hear Namby Pamby the Necromancer<br/>\nshouting across the zone about how badly Verant nerfed the casters, and how<br/>\nthey are owed some special &#39;hot death from above&#39; spell to offset the loss?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parting thought is this: sure I&#39;d love to have bind.  I&#39;d also like to be<br/>\nthe flying cuisinart of death, but I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m a bard.  I&#39;ve been endowed<br/>\nby my creators with a wide variety of marvelous abilities (most of which<br/>\nwork), but bind is not one of them.  Being adaptable, I make do with what I<br/>\nhave, and frankly, I do pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanulf<br/>\nTunare Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
