No groups seem to have need of my<br/>\nservice, and when I do find groups to adventure with they seek me out not<br/>\nfor the healing, strength or speed that I can provide, but to take blows at<br/>\nthe hands of monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticied that there are far fewer people of a comparable level, and<br/>\nthat many of the players belong to guilds of various natures. Perhaps this<br/>\nis a consequence of playing on a more established server where players have<br/>\nhad more time to develop their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a complaint mind you. Soloing has made me into a hardy adventure<br/>\nable to cope with circumstance well beyond my meager skills. Has anyone else<br/>\nhad experiences similar to these?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn of Kelethin<br/>\nIntiate of the 10th Stanza</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
