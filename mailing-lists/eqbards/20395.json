For down time I play( with lute) Hymn.  I always keep Selos mem&#39;d with Screech for a fast getaway. so there are my 8 song slots. I weild weapons most of the time Kirsh & Obs. Shard in off hand.<br/>\nNow I&#39;m 30 I got my first Chant...but last nite I was at a loss as how to weave it into my mix, do I do all instruments? do i sing it as a 3rd or 4th song what song do I drop?  Most of the time I fight in High Keep or Karnuk so AoE aggro is not a problem.<br/>\nPlease help me :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPinen<br/>\nbard of the rathe 30 songs ( and took too long to get &#39;em)<br/>\nGM-Noble Warriors of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
