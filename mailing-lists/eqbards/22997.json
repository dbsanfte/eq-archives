I bet there are servers where necro/druid<br/>\npopulation is sky high because they were new servers when necro/druid were<br/>\nTHE choices.   However, I do have to agree that there are fewer bards. One<br/>\nof the reasons I think that is is not necessarily the difficulty of playing<br/>\na bard, although I do think it is more difficult, but that bards go through<br/>\ntheir &quot;bad, weak period&quot; very early - say around levels 9-22, and a LOT of<br/>\npeople never make it through that.

Difficulty of <br/>\n&gt; actual play.<br/>\n&gt; There is no other class which even remotely approaches the <br/>\n&gt; actual physical<br/>\n&gt; difficulty of play which the bard class presents.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; think bards are<br/>\n&gt; adequately recompensed for that aspect of the playability <br/>\n&gt; factor; in fact I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think it even enters into the equation in Verant&#39;s mind because<br/>\n&gt; despite their claims to the contrary it is quite evident that <br/>\n&gt; no one there<br/>\n&gt; plays a bard regularly.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that if all the classes were properly balanced we <br/>\n&gt; would see a more<br/>\n&gt; balanced representation of the classes in the overall <br/>\n&gt; population.  That is<br/>\n&gt; not the case.  Certain classes so far outnumber others that <br/>\n&gt; it is readily<br/>\n&gt; apparent there must be a reason for it.  Certain other <br/>\n&gt; classes, including<br/>\n&gt; bards, are so vastly underrepresented that there also must be <br/>\n&gt; a reason for<br/>\n&gt; that.  Personal preference would obviously create some <br/>\n&gt; variation, but across<br/>\n&gt; a population as large as this one that variation would not be <br/>\n&gt; at the levels<br/>\n&gt; we see now.  Below is just a sample from E&#39;ci that I took in <br/>\n&gt; the off-peak<br/>\n&gt; hours when I could get some actual numbers.  Note that <br/>\n&gt; &#39;Anonymous&#39; will<br/>\n&gt; lower the numbers shown for some classes, but typically <br/>\n&gt; should be fairly<br/>\n&gt; equal for all classes except those with high &quot;request&quot; <br/>\n&gt; factors like druids,<br/>\n&gt; shamans, enchanters, and clerics.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note these numbers are the averages over 4 nites at around 3am mst.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tWarriors\t\t32+\ttoo many to list<br/>\n&gt; \tRogues\t\t9.5<br/>\n&gt; \tMonks\t\t\t5.5<br/>\n&gt; \tRangers\t\t30<br/>\n&gt; \tPaladins\t\t27<br/>\n&gt; \tShadowknights\t17.5<br/>\n&gt; \tBards\t\t\t5<br/>\n&gt; \tWizards\t\t19.25<br/>\n&gt; \tMagicians\t\t29.75<br/>\n&gt; \tNecromancers\t32+\ttoo many to list<br/>\n&gt; \tEnchanters\t\t25+\tOne night there were too many to<br/>\n&gt; list<br/>\n&gt; \tClerics\t\t31+\tTwo nights there were too many to list<br/>\n&gt; \tDruids\t\t32+\ttoo many to list<br/>\n&gt; \tShamans\t\t23.75<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tWith over 600 people on the server this means that <br/>\n&gt; either half the<br/>\n&gt; server was \tAnonymous or Roleplaying (Highly unlikely) or <br/>\n&gt; those classes<br/>\n&gt; which were too many \tto list were actually much, much higher <br/>\n&gt; than 32 in<br/>\n&gt; number.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
