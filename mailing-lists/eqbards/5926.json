Perfect place for a bard if you ask me,<br/>\nnot too much stunning from mobs, it&#39;s out doors so you<br/>\ncan use selo&#39;s.  I gain tons from going there each<br/>\ntime.  But I have a problem.  I often bank in FP. <br/>\nWhich means I run past guk.  Ah, guk, a deathtrap for<br/>\nbards.  Using 70% of our songs in that dungeons will<br/>\nget you trained faster than standing outside a weight<br/>\nwatchers meeting door when the ice cream truck rolls<br/>\nby.  But I hear voices.  &quot;Come to guk&quot;  &quot;troll hide<br/>\nbelt in guk&quot; &quot;lots of items you like in guk&quot;  &quot;yes, my<br/>\nprecious, the yellow light, it burns my skin&quot;.  9<br/>\ntimes out of ten I stop in guk on my trips, with<br/>\nalways the same result:  me, 20 frogs, and a fear run<br/>\nto the zone.  Why?  Why can&#39;t I solo one stinking blue<br/>\nin guk?  Why do the frogs hate me so?  I just want a<br/>\nfew shiny baubles and I&#39;ll be on my way.  Our root<br/>\neven when it works won&#39;t stop them, just slow them,<br/>\nand 2 blues is an even quicker death.  At 27 my melee<br/>\nalone just doesn&#39;t cut it, but if I use any damage<br/>\nsongs, it&#39;s a parade of kermit&#39;s singing &quot;It&#39;s not<br/>\neasy beeing green&quot; followed by a Loading, please<br/>\nwait...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, does anyone have any info that will let me<br/>\nknock off just one blue in guk?  Just one, thats all I<br/>\nask.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n(two froglock guards sit in a chair as a bard goes<br/>\nrunning past them at full speed followed by half a<br/>\ndungeon, one says to the other in a souther voice)<br/>\n&quot;you reckon that er bards dun riled em froggies up?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I reckon&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Ma, git my gun&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
