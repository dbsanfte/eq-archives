I baught 2 gnoll hid lariats a few days ago<br/>\nfor kick and the stun proc. I took my enchanter friend to Fp arena  to show<br/>\nhim my neat somewhat useless toys. I told him &quot; you should see how much I<br/>\nstun wielding 2 of these, it funny&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe stood there I sang Berserkers. I got him down to 2 bubbles no proces I<br/>\nhealed him up and did this  about 5 times.. and got ONE proc the entire<br/>\ntime.. I was thinking it was just an arena/duel thing. I did not get to test<br/>\nit on a mob though for I went on a wonderfull nagga raid shortly. We<br/>\nslaughtere him. (yes he is buffed more now) the previous group tried for 5<br/>\nhours and mass people died till they gave nagga up to the more experienced<br/>\nraids..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing we did on nagga since he removes buffs.. we made a &quot;useless<br/>\nbuff line&quot;  we would buff everyone with all the useless enchantments THEN<br/>\nlast we would do the resist hp buffs etc... it worked great.. naga would<br/>\nremobe the useless buffs first. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldar<br/>\n45th bard  Tarew marr....<br/>\nHI maeve.. he was there to in all his red beard!..<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eqbards@...\">Eqbards@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, January 21, 2000 10:21 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Post Patch Procing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not too concerned yet, but did anyone else playing last night notice a<br/>\n&gt;staggering drop in the number of procs that their weapons are firing?
