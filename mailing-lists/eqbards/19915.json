Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>\nfrom time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for those<br/>\nthat had characters there, my condolences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character over<br/>\nthe last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what I&#39;ve<br/>\nheard.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia, you had a high level Bard on test, didn&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI read on the Gameplay board this morning that Brad is taking suggestions<br/>\non:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Offering players to move their characters onto the live servers without<br/>\ntheir items.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>\nstinks nonetheless.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
