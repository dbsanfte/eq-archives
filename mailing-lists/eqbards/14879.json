This is a<br/>\ngentrification of elder player problem as old as all the genres of online<br/>\ngames/MUDs etc. How do you keep it challenging to the elder player?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easiest bandaid is to make everything harder - this shuts out new<br/>\nplayers. The correct solution is adding new things - not continually<br/>\nraising the bar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed in a few posts the attitude that Verant is the enemy. Well,<br/>\nsortof - WE are the enemy. This too is a very common attitude shift for<br/>\ndesigners and GMs/DMs. What starts out as OUR game - eventually turns out<br/>\nto be THEIR game - and the players do become the enemy. It&#39;s all bout<br/>\nattitude and human nature - and it&#39;s as predictable as tommorrow&#39;s sunrise<br/>\n- they ALL go thru it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Which is, of course, how it should be.  As a casual gamer playing 2 hours a<br/>\n&gt;night, I should expect to advance slower than somebody who plays 12 hours a<br/>\n&gt;day.  There&#39;s no &quot;bias&quot; against casual gamers in EQ that doesn&#39;t exist in any<br/>\n&gt;other online game.  And it&#39;s not really accurate to call it a bias<br/>\n&gt;either...after all would it be fair for me to level 6x faster than Joe<br/>\n&gt;Collegestudent just because I can&#39;t play as much as him? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
