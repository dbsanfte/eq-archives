All the bears were green and threatening to me, but<br/>\ndidn&#39;t attack.  I finally ran across a huge bear - Mammoth -<br/>\nwho was yellow and threatening.  He immediately attacked me<br/>\n(hey, thanks for the warning - real funny sending me on a<br/>\nquest where the thing I&#39;m supposed to be protecting attacks<br/>\nme).<br/>\n<br/>\nMammoth is fast.  Very fast.  With Accelerando (my running<br/>\nsong) and a drum, I can (slowly) outrun druids and shamans<br/>\nwith Spirit of the Wolf.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t outrun Mammoth.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe whacked me down to two bars of life (around 150/399, so<br/>\nit&#39;s not like I tried to outrun him for just a few seconds - I<br/>\nwas doing a pretty good imitation of the pod race scene in the<br/>\nPhantom Menace going through those caves at warp speed for a<br/>\ngood 20-30 seconds), at which point I knew there was no way<br/>\nI&#39;d survive a trip to the zone with Mammoth in tow.  I figured<br/>\nmy best chance was to jump off a ledge and hope I&#39;d land in<br/>\nwater, which I did, and which happened.  This was my first<br/>\ntime in Surefall so I was now completely lost, with a mad bear<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t outrun presumably pathfinding his way through the<br/>\ntwists and turns of the caves in the shortest possible<br/>\ncomputer-generated route to decapitating me.  So I ran in any<br/>\nold direction and ended up in a dead-end cave with a pool of<br/>\nwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot wanting to backtrack, I jumped in the water and swam.<br/>\nThere was a small underwater passage.  I figured the chances<br/>\nthat Mammoth, whom I&#39;d left far above, had somehow gotten<br/>\n*below* me were slim, so I took the passage.  After a good<br/>\ndeal of swimming (my skill is around 85) I was about to start<br/>\ndrowning and realized this passage was not meant for mere<br/>\nmortals.  Fortunately, I just happened to have the Aquatic<br/>\nAyre memorized, so I started it - end of drowning problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe underwater passage went on for a really really long time -<br/>\nI&#39;d guess about 4-5 times the time it normally takes you to<br/>\nstart drowning.  Finally I saw light and popped up in a room<br/>\nbehind the waterfall.  I kicked in Accelerando again and got<br/>\nthe Hell out of Surefall.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t go in the caves unless you&#39;re a druid or ranger.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
