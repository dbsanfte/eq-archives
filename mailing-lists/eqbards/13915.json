A L49 pet requires words<br/>\nand components which are very rare and difficult to obtain -<br/>\nroughly as difficult as or rarer than equipment like the FBSS.  <br/>\nA lot of the high level mages and necros are using lower level<br/>\npets because they simply haven&#39;t obtained the items needed for<br/>\ntheir higher level pet spells.  So the correct comparison is<br/>\nbetween L49 pet and L49 warrior with equipment typical for<br/>\nthat level.  (Actually, the correct comparison would be L49<br/>\nnecro and L49 pet vs L49 warrior.  We&#39;re already being<br/>\nmassively conservative comparing the warrior to just the pet.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
