The old saying goes<br/>\nthat any item is only worth what two people are paying for it.

Is it his fault that someone is selling a fine steel sword<br/>\nfor only 10pp, and he can get 20pp for it?  (just an example).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in another post I read that Verant has officially said that<br/>\njacking up prices is not allowed?!  My God?!  What&#39;s next?!  Killing<br/>\n&#39;green&#39; creatures in the newbie area if you are above level 15 is<br/>\nillegal?<br/>\nGeez, why don&#39;t they introduce a &#39;free economy&#39; option, like the<br/>\nPvP option.  If you turn off the free economy, it is impossible for<br/>\nyou to pay more for an item than an NPC would charge, and you can&#39;t<br/>\nsell any item for less than an NPC would pay!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on this general rant, what is up with the trade skills?  I mean,<br/>\nsure, I can sell patchwork armour for 3gp, which represented a <br/>\nreasonable return on the time and financial investment.  Although I<br/>\nhave seen people selling for 2gp lately.<br/>\nBut studded armour?  No hope selling that at any profit.  Leather<br/>\narmour abounds, and is just as good.  Given the cost of making studs<br/>\n(I have a friend who is a smith), I don&#39;t think we can break even. <br/>\nReinforced leather?  I do have my doubts, given the ridiculously low<br/>\nprices I have seen for banded armour.  I remain hopeful.<br/>\nWhat goes through a smith&#39;s mind when they sell a banded helm for 10pp?<br/>\nThat is cost, assuming a 30% success rate (which I believe requires<br/>\na skill level requiring an investment of HUNDREDS of platinum).<br/>\nIs the entire world of Norrath a charity organisation?<br/>\nIt is starting to annoy me.  I am seriously considering giving up my<br/>\ntrade (tailoring), and spending my points on something that will<br/>\nactually give me a return.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, time for my medicine now.  8)<br/>\n<br/>\nRod</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
