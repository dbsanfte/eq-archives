It seems now that more bards<br/>\nare beginning to agree that our melee skills are not far beyond those of<br/>\nsome of the &quot;pure&quot; casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually his statement is exactly right.  Our Melee skills are hardly our<br/>\ndefining trait.  Being only barely a notch above shaman and druids in our<br/>\nmelee ability.  Sure we get dual wield but they can wield 2h blunt weapons.<br/>\nSo we&#39;re better at melee, but not near on par with the &#39;true&#39; melee classes<br/>\nthat get dual wield and double attack or just double attack but can wield<br/>\n2hs weapons or 1hs and use a shield to bash.  Either way, any of the real<br/>\nmelee classes are &quot;defined&quot; by their melee skills.  We are &quot;defined&quot; by our<br/>\nability to sing songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n(and almost any bard will tell you that our songs are far more powerful than<br/>\nour melee ability)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nMissing old school friends?
