Message Board is a good idea. There&#39;s got to be some nice<br/>\narmour or weapons they can trade you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, the only coin that I had trouble with was the Kaesora because of the<br/>\nway the zone is built. Dalnir&#39;s is 2nd hardest but doable alone.

Either way, I just won the lottery as far<br/>\nas I&#39;m concerned...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
