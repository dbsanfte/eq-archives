Ok so the song isint supposed to work on<br/>\npost 20 level mobs...FAIR ENOUGH  however if you notice<br/>\n50+ level bards cannot keep newbie area mobs mezzed with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat folks, is a broken song.<br/>\nalso MOST importantly, the song doesnt add ANY fun to the game<br/>\nI would rather they changed the song into one that just spewed out a pretty<br/>\ngraphic.  AT least then we could have some fun with it.<br/>\nsomething, anything, jeez!  How about a little CREATIVITY verant...?<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway...I am venting WAY too much lately...:)<br/>\nI need a vacation..:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very angry, disappointed, and confused as I compose this<br/>\nletter.  My first inclination is to shout, scream, and curse.<br/>\nHowever, I realize that is not the proper course of action to take<br/>\nwhen you are attempting to communicate in a rational manner.  So,<br/>\ninstead of all the above, I have simply sat back and tried to<br/>\nevaluate my emotions.  Why am I feeling this way?  Why is it Verant<br/>\nseems to totally misunderstand our plight?  Surely it&#39;s a<br/>\nmisunderstanding because I honestly don&#39;t see Verant doing<br/>\nsomething<br/>\nto intentionally run players away or anger them.  So where does this<br/>\nlead me?  I guess the big disparity, as I see it, lies in what<br/>\nplayers of Bards see as their role in the overall scheme and what<br/>\nVerant sees as the Bard&#39;s role.  Obviously there is a big<br/>\ndisparity<br/>\nhere.  Obviously I don&#39;t understand what Verant perceives as the<br/>\nBard&#39;s role in EverQuest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know is how I perceive my role in EverQuest.  Let me explain<br/>\nhow I see it in the hopes someone from Verant can explain where I<br/>\ndiffer.  For me, a bard is the ultimate group member.  We are<br/>\ndesigned to operate most effectively in the company of others.  We<br/>\nare often called a Jack of All Trades, but a master of none.  We have<br/>\nso many abilities that are spread among several other classes.  Need<br/>\nsomeone to buff your attack speed?  A Bard can do that and more at<br/>\nhigher levels. Need to slowdown a mobs attack speed?  A Bard can do<br/>\nthat and more at higher levels.  Need a boost to your resistances?  A<br/>\nBard is one of the best at boosting resistances.  Need to regenerate<br/>\nhealth or mana faster?  Again, a bard can do this.  Need to charm a<br/>\ncreature for a short while and make him your ally?  Bards.  Need<br/>\nsomeone who can wear armor and take a FEW hits ok?  Bards.  Need to<br/>\nget from one location to another fast and teleports or gates are not<br/>\nfeasible?  Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are MANY things a bard can do but usually at a reduced capacity<br/>\ncompared to the class it is imitating.  One thing that many bards<br/>\nattempt to play is the role of limited crowd control.  We have never<br/>\nexcelled at this ability nor did we ever expect to excel at this<br/>\nability.  We certainly don&#39;t excel at any other abilities we<br/>\nimitate.  No, we saw our role as more of a contingency crowd<br/>\ncontroller.  Our line of songs designed for these roles were very<br/>\nlimited in scope.  The first crowd control ability we receive is in<br/>\nthe form of a point blank area of effect song.  By point blank I mean<br/>\nit extends in a radius around the bard.  This song would never be as<br/>\neffective as enchanter&#39;s spells because it requires the bard to<br/>\nbe in<br/>\nthe thick of things and pretty much doing nothing else but playing<br/>\nthis song.  The duration on the song was such that it did not lend<br/>\nitself to being &quot;twisted&quot;.  Waking mobs would rightly attack<br/>\nthe bard<br/>\nthat had put them to sleep and the duration on the song was such that<br/>\nmobs WOULD wake at some point.  This song would work in an emergency<br/>\nor a bad pull.at a minimum it would allow for the group to<br/>\ncollect<br/>\ntheir thoughts rapidly and get organized or make the decision to<br/>\nfight or flee.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next form of crowd control a bard receives is in the form of a<br/>\ntargeted mez.  Well, the duration on this song (and all bard songs<br/>\nfor the most part) dictate that a bard can only keep a very limited<br/>\nnumber of creatures mezzed.  With no resists and a good connection, I<br/>\nwould hazard the average bard could keep three separate targets<br/>\nmezzed.  This is not even considering the difficulty targeting<br/>\nclosely packed mobs.  Now, a bard doing this type of crowd control is<br/>\nalso typically able to do little else.  If he is only keeping one<br/>\ntarget mezzed, then he may have time to twist in one or two more<br/>\nsongs and maybe melee for two rounds.  Try to keep 2 mezzed and<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\nusually a full-time job.  Keeping 3 mezzed would require a lot of<br/>\nluck, but most likely would be the bard getting beat on a few times<br/>\nas he remezzes one that resisted.  Again, not nearly as effective as<br/>\nan enchanter and the bard is effectively removed from combat (albeit<br/>\nkeeping other mobs also out of combat).<br/>\n<br/>\nStill yet another form of crowd control available to the bard is his<br/>\nability to charm.  This is a risky method and takes a lot of<br/>\npractice, timing, and coordination.  I daresay you see more bards<br/>\nwilling to charm creatures in combat than you do any other class.<br/>\nThere are some problems associated with this song that have never<br/>\nbeen addressed.  The biggest issue is that on a non-pvp server, this<br/>\nsong cannot be refreshed until it wears off.  On a pvp server, this<br/>\nsong can be refreshed over and over as needed.  What is more<br/>\nconfusing is the higher-level charm song.  The level 39 song,<br/>\nSolon&#39;s<br/>\nBewitching Brauvara, includes a Magic Resistance Debuff!  Why would a<br/>\ncharm song that cannot be refreshed include a Magic Resist Debuff?<br/>\nPlayers cannot cast on the charmed mob because it is now a pet.  The<br/>\nMR does not last any longer than the charm, so it does not make it<br/>\neasier to reapply the charm.  It really leads one to believe a few<br/>\nthings.  This song is meant to be refreshable and that whomever<br/>\ndevelops songs for the bard class sure doesn&#39;t pay attention to<br/>\ndetail.  It also makes one wonder if anyone at Verant really has an<br/>\nunderstanding how bard songs operate on a production server.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have an Enchanter in the group, then a bard is not needed in<br/>\nthe role of crowd control.  That&#39;s fine and wonderful because<br/>\nthere<br/>\nare many other roles the bard can fulfill.  We can buff attack speed,<br/>\ncombat stat abilities, defensive abilities, add in health regen, mana<br/>\nregen, buff resistances, slow-down mobs, debuff mobs, cast dots as<br/>\nwell as debuffs, and reduce downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am getting at is a bard looks at his group makeup,<br/>\nthen at his songs and best determines his role within the group.  No<br/>\nother class really needs to do much in this area.  And this is where<br/>\nthings get confusing.  Bards have a nice line of songs developed to<br/>\nperform a role as crowd control.  If there is not an enchanter in the<br/>\ngroup, it might behoove the bard to memorize at least one of these<br/>\ntype of songs.  Why would Verant give bards the ability to perform<br/>\nthis role if it is not one they really intended bards to perform?<br/>\n<br/>\nBard songs are known to improve as a bard levels.  This has always<br/>\nseemed to be the reason bard&#39;s only earned one song a level.<br/>\nUnlike<br/>\nSPELL casters, bard songs do not receive an upgraded version later.<br/>\nInstead, the song increases in power as the bard increases in level.<br/>\nThe Hymn of restoration at level 6 that only healed a mere 4 points a<br/>\npulse now heals 19 points a pulse.  Why is it unreasonable to think<br/>\nthe crowd control abilities would also not increase in power as the<br/>\nbard levels?  One would think a level 50 bard would have the same<br/>\nchance to mesmerize that level 40 Drolvarg as he did at 15 versus<br/>\nthat level 5 Orc (not accounting for any magic resistance).  One<br/>\nwould CERTAINLY assume the level 50 bard would have near 100% chance<br/>\nto mesmerize that level 5 Orc now!  This has not been the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is the role of a bard?  Certainly more than a walking,<br/>\ntalking mana-battery!  Does the loss of crowd control really define<br/>\nthe bard class?  No, we have been surviving ok without it for these<br/>\npast 10 months already.  However, it severely diminishes the role<br/>\nbards can play and it certainly forces groups into preset group make-<br/>\nups.  Higher level groups learn they can&#39;t do certain things<br/>\nwithout<br/>\nan enchanter in a group.  It takes a lot of the challenge out of the<br/>\ngame and it forces people into fewer and fewer group options.  While<br/>\nthe bard may not be as effective as the enchanter may, he can be<br/>\nsomewhat effective.  While a group may not delve as deep into a<br/>\ndungeon with a bard instead of an enchanter, at least they can delve<br/>\nsomewhat into the dungeon with the hope the bard can manage a few<br/>\nextra mobs.  This is what I used to perceive as my role, to make up<br/>\nfor any deficiencies in a group to make it a productive group.  This<br/>\nis the challenge of the bard class that makes it one of the most<br/>\nexciting classes to play.  The ability to take a &quot;broken&quot;<br/>\ngroup and<br/>\nmake it work is amazing.  Crowd control is a significant part of this<br/>\nrole when there is no enchanter available.  Bard&#39;s with crowd<br/>\ncontrol<br/>\nabilities open up more groups to be able to accomplish things they<br/>\nwould not have dared without ONE other class being present.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I ask Verant.  What IS the role of a bard?  Please help clear up<br/>\nthis disparity and tell us how YOU see us using our songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosha Cristi, Bard of 51 {insert something musical here}<br/>\nGuild Leader, Legends<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
