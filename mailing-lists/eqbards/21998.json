Today (or <br/>\npretty close, their records got messed up) marked my 6 month anniversary as <br/>\na Guide on the Tarew Marr server.  It also marked my last day as a Guide, <br/>\nas I felt that I could no longer in good conscience support a company that <br/>\nchooses to treat it&#39;s customers in so heavy-handed a manner with no <br/>\nconsideration for the consequences.  This refers to both the recent banning <br/>\nissues (more than just Mystere were banned over this), and the Bard issues <br/>\nthread.  It is my belief that Everquest truly IS their world, and as such, <br/>\nI have no place being in it.  I haven&#39;t paid Verant a dime in 6 months, and <br/>\nI&#39;m not about to start today, so this was my last day on Norrath as a <br/>\nplayer, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really believed that I could make a difference in Everquest as a Guide - <br/>\nnot just by summoning corpses, but also by being a good source of input for <br/>\nthings that needed to be fixed or changed.  I&#39;m well-versed in diplomacy <br/>\n(being the Herald for my local LARP Kingdom), and I was very eager to make <br/>\nthe world a better place.  Unfortunately, from day one, my rose-coloured <br/>\nglasses suffered some pretty potent tarnish.  While in IRC, being given <br/>\ninstructions on what NOT to do as a Guide (&quot;no hunting, no looting, and <br/>\nabove all, no fighting with players!!!&quot;), I was also online on my other <br/>\ncomputer (Love having two windows machines!).  As I was playing my <br/>\nenchanter, I heard the shout that there was a &quot;Giant GM&quot; on the loose in <br/>\nthe Arena, so I invis&#39;d myself and ran there. (why the invis? I dunno... <br/>\nJust didn&#39;t want to attract any attention to myself, and didn&#39;t realize at <br/>\nthe time that GMs can see invis all the time.)<br/>\nWhen I got there, I saw the giant GM - 3 stories tall, at least!, and he <br/>\nwas in the process of giving a warning to a rude player who was exploiting <br/>\nthe arena (charming the lower level guy every time he tried to retrieve his <br/>\ncorpse).  While I grant that the player was being rude, and certainly <br/>\ndeserved the warning, what happened next was totally uncalled for.  The GM <br/>\nfollowed up his verbal warning with a spell (some kind of knockback that <br/>\ndoes damage), nearly killing the offending player.  I was stunned.  I <br/>\nimmediately did a direct tell to a GM in the IRC room asking for <br/>\nclairification on this, and at first, until they heard the GMs name, they <br/>\nacted somewhat shocked.  When they realized it was a programmer GM, they <br/>\nsuddenly backed off and said that &quot;well, GM&#39;s know what they&#39;re doing - <br/>\nit&#39;s not our place to question that.&quot;<br/>\nThis, incidentally, was less than two weeks after several guides were <br/>\nbanned for fighting players in the Arena.  Even the Guides who were brand <br/>\nnew and just following their leader were suspended, and removed from the <br/>\nGuide Program.<br/>\nBasicallly I guess what I&#39;m saying here is that *even then*, the hypocrisy <br/>\nran rampant, and that sort of attitude really ticks me off.  I&#39;m not going <br/>\nto turn into any sort of Tweety, but I&#39;m also not going to candy-coat <br/>\nit.  Verant&#39;s version of social engineering made me sick to my stomach, and <br/>\nI refuse to be a part of that orwellian nightmare.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting note is that when I posted my letter of resignation to <br/>\nthe Guide board (which wasn&#39;t nearly as vitriolic as this one - but it did <br/>\ninclude the phrase &quot;rampant hypocrisy&quot;), it was deleted inside of 3 <br/>\nminutes.  I had to severely water it down before I posted it again to <br/>\nensure that it would stay up there.  Way to control information, Big <br/>\nBrother Verant.  Ignorance is Bliss.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will remain on the list as an active moderator, and to share Bard <br/>\nstories, perhaps even get some input on Bards for my new project, but my EQ <br/>\ncareer is over.<br/>\n<br/>\nSweet Songs and Light Laughter,<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nformerly<br/>\nJalviv the Just of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
