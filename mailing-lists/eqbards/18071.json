Those people who ordered prior to the 20th and do <br/>\nnot receive their CD before the 24th will receive a refund of all shipping <br/>\ncharges, plus a free month of game play.  These arrangements to be handled <br/>\nby email.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Some few persons have reached 51st, but were immediately demoted back to <br/>\n50th.  These persons are all Guides playing their play characters, so don&#39;t <br/>\nexpect to be able to level any time before the 24th.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) You will need to have the CD and Registration Key in order to a) Visit <br/>\nKunark with your existing characters, 2) Level above 50th, or 3) Create an <br/>\nIksar character.  You will NOT need the RoK upgrade to see Iksar players in <br/>\nthe rest of the world, or to purchase/trade Kunark-specific items from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) I do not have a CD, and am currently not planning on purchasing one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nCheck out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
