Like many of you,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1692707784\">Bear with me for a couple of paragraphs while I go over my thoughts on<br/>\ntwinking.  If you want just read My Solution, skip to the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike many of you, Twinking has become a bigger issue as of late.  As first I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t care, but serveral incidents have started me thinking about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t care if you hand something down to a lower level if you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a need for it.  This doesn&#39;t affect me directly so I could care less.<br/>\nIf that level 5 Paladin is wearing full bronze because his &quot;older brother&quot;<br/>\nupgraded to Crafted Armor (or plane armor) more power to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut lately I see more and more people camping items they don&#39;t need just to<br/>\ntwink.  Several times my group has went to get a specific item and found it<br/>\ncamped by a higher level that can&#39;t use the item.  On several occasions, the<br/>\nplayers confessed that he was twinking his guild or his newbie character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time in a pickup group, a wizard tried to claim the first Bronze<br/>\nArmor loot, said he needed it for twinking his new character. (I dropped out<br/>\nof that group in a hurry).  I&#39;ve seen several instances like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to talk about any killstealing encounters.  Were they there<br/>\njust for the profits, or were they looking to twink as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone prevents me from getting an item I want because they want to<br/>\ntwink, I feel as if I am being robbed.  Now, everytime I look at a twinked<br/>\ncharacter, I wonder if someone deserving was denied access to that item so<br/>\nthe twink could occur.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Twinking Solution really isn&#39;t a solution.  Most of the proposed<br/>\nsolutions involving level limits and NoDrop items won&#39;t affect twinking that<br/>\nmuch, but would have a negative effect on normal players too.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead my group has started playing on the Team PvP servers a few times a<br/>\nmonth.  Twinking doesn&#39;t nearly seem to be as common.  If a level 5 is<br/>\nrunning around with Quest Armor, there is a good chance that he will get<br/>\npopped and have his armor taken from him a piece at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also seems that because of the PvP nature, items are not quite as<br/>\nplentiful.  This has the wonderful aspect of actually making the tradeskills<br/>\n(Tailoring and Blacksmithing) useful again.  It is totally different from<br/>\nthe &quot;carebear&quot; servers, and not the bloodbath I had initially expected.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
