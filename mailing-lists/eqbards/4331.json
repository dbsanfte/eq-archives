After<br/>\nmuch consideration my Most Desired Magic Instrument (tm) would be a regular<br/>\nol&#39; drum...but one that sticks with you when you die. You awaken in the<br/>\nArena, naked to the world, with 3 or so zones to cross...wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>\nwonderful to have that drum sitting there in your inventory? No, we can&#39;t<br/>\nbind, and I am happy with that, but at EXACTLY the time you could really<br/>\nleverage your abilities to lessen the pain, blah, no drum. Sure, I keep one<br/>\nin the bank for when I am bound to a city,  but often zoning to the bank to<br/>\nget it is just not what I have patience for after dying... Just a thought,<br/>\none born of making level 18 five times this weekend :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
