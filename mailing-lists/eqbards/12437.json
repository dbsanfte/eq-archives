I am a 36th bard. Killing HGs in North<br/>\nKarana. Found 2 and charmed one, let them fight. Slipped up a couple of<br/>\ntimes, so I was at 75% health when My HG kills the other, He&#39;s at 25%<br/>\nheath, and an EVEN /con to me. I wade in for Melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sing Fear, Chains, and Fufil&#39;s. 50% resist rate on all, so I<br/>\nconcentrate on Fear. I have ~850 HP, so a few &quot;HG hits you for 94, HG<br/>\nhits you for 94, HG bashes you for 27, YOU are STUNNED&quot; and we are both<br/>\ndown to almost nothing. I decide if I can get fear to stick one more<br/>\ntime, i&#39;m leaving, even though the HG is dow to maybe 5%.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen: &quot;A HG hits you for 78!, You have been knocked Unconscious!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow being unconscious is something that has not happenned to me in 10<br/>\nlevels. The mobs usually run right by that buffer and kill you outright.<br/>\nSo I lay there Unconscious looking from overhead at my prone body,<br/>\nwaiting for the killing blow. And I see:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A HG tries to hit YOU but misses, A HG tries to hit YOU, but you<br/>\nDODGE!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then the best part: &quot;A HG flees in terror!&quot; I still had Screech<br/>\nplaying, and the HG ran away. I popped back up, got a quick dose of<br/>\nhymn, which must have put me at ~10 HP. Equipped my MM drum and started<br/>\nselo&#39;s and ran. AND I actually RAN. 36th level selo&#39;s with a MM drum<br/>\nseems to overcome the massive AGI penalty of low health (I checked my<br/>\nAGI it was ~50). I made it to the zone safely, never saw the HG again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust had to share this with all of you, I was so astounded it happenned<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n36th Bard ROdcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, if it had not happenned this way, I could have commented on the<br/>\n&quot;lose one bubble of XP at 36th discussion, but alas, it does not appear<br/>\nI can :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
