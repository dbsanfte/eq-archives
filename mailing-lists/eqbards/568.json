This amount is (DMG * 2) + 1. Why? It<br/>\njust does . . . observe your weapon&#39;s behavior. Your Mino Axe should do no<br/>\nmore than 17 damage (8 * 2) +1.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, you won&#39;t always do the maximum amount of damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour STR helps determine how close to the max you hit. The higher your STR,<br/>\nthe more chance you&#39;ll have of hitting for the max. Your skill in the<br/>\nweapon and in offense probably affects this as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, your opponent&#39;s armor will affact how much damage you hit for,<br/>\nbecause their armor will absorb some of your damage. You will notice you do<br/>\nless damage against higher level characters even when you hit them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my formula takes the max amount of damage (DMG * 2) + 1 . . . and<br/>\ndivides it by the delay of a weapon in seconds (Delay / 10). Doing this you<br/>\nget damage per second, which is probably better named maximum damage per<br/>\nsecond.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:38 AM 5/9/99 , you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Blitz Krieg&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Question about your formula for dps... And maybe it&#39;s a question about<br/>\n&gt;damage in general...  : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(damage*2)+1   Where&#39;d you get the *2?  Doesn&#39;t STR get factored in there<br/>\n&gt;somewhere?  I am extremelly curious about this as I am probably over<br/>\n&gt;obsessive about Stats.  : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If someone could break down how my Mino Axe with a damage of 8 does 18 max<br/>\n&gt;damage for me, I&#39;d appreciate it. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a base strength of 95, going as high as 112 with buffs and equip.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I sorted through the list of weapons on EQLizer for magic 1H slashing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;weapons.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; The obvious ones are the combine longsword and scimtar, and their<br/>\n&gt;&gt;well-balanced counterparts. Information on these is widely held, so I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;go into detail here.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; First, let me say I measure the damage value of a weapon using a stat<br/>\n&gt;&gt;called damage per second (dps). This is calculated assuming that the delay<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is in tenths of a sec (I think that&#39;s about right). To calculate: ( (damage<br/>\n&gt;&gt;* 2) + 1 ) / (delay / 10)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Please give me any info you have on any of these weapons, including<br/>\n&gt;&gt;opinons on which is best, how hard they to obtain, how much they sell for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;if sold, etc.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Also, if there are any missng from this list please add them. (There are<br/>\n&gt;&gt;only 4 here). And two of those are not even confirmed as 1H slashing magic<br/>\n&gt;&gt;weapons.
