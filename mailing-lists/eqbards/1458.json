It is very useful when your group is <br/>\nfighting 2 yellow mobs, it let you sleep one while your group is <br/>\nconcentrating on the other.  I think they also change the song name from <br/>\nPixie Chase to Pixie.. something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to the other person who was asking about the level 3 song. It is NOT a <br/>\nmana regen song, it regen STA not mana.  To get the mana regen song, you <br/>\nwill have to wait until level 32.  The message will say your mind is clear..<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen you play that song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone know what Crisson&#39;s Pixie Chase does?  It is the lvl 28 song <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;I heard it was tweaked on the patch before the last one, still don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt;what it does though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
