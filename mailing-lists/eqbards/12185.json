You&#39;ll take a<br/>\nfew turns, then you&#39;ll see a door on your right with gargs clustered around it.  3<br/>\nthere, I think, that can be either basalt or clay.  We want basalt, of course. :)<br/>\nWas very easy to pull single gargs there using lament.  Then, if you go a little<br/>\nfurther you&#39;l reach the bridge leading into the tower, with the 3 caster froggies<br/>\nstraight in front of you, and a few more gargs up in an alcove on the left.  I<br/>\nhad trouble lamenting the caster froggies for some reason, always ended up<br/>\nwith all 3 at once. :)  Thank goodness for pixie strike and elemental...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin, 45th bard of Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;                 From:   JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;                 Sent:   Thursday, December 23, 1999 1:38 PM<br/>\n&gt;                 To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;                 Subject:        [eqbards] Lower Guk (long) (was Grrrrrrrr!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 &gt; PS. Can anyone tell me what level Greater Ice bones are, I<br/>\n&gt; was in the<br/>\n&gt;                 &gt; bedroom in L Guk with my group and we had cleared the<br/>\n&gt; area. I went round<br/>\n&gt;                 ------<br/>\n&gt;                 There are two paths leading out of the BR and they both very<br/>\n&gt; shortly empty<br/>\n&gt;                 into the same room.  This room, the &quot;bat room&quot;, has a<br/>\n&gt; passage leading off to<br/>\n&gt;                 the left and to the right.  Most people are heading left as<br/>\n&gt; that takes you<br/>\n&gt;                 over toward the assassin, etc. and most of lower guk.  The<br/>\n&gt; bat room room has<br/>\n&gt;                 a couple of frog spawns and some sonic bats.  Here&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; tricky part.  The<br/>\n&gt;                 invis vs undead that you got at the zone doesn&#39;t help you<br/>\n&gt; with the bats,<br/>\n&gt;                 only the frogs, however, if you hug the wall going left<br/>\n&gt; pretty tightly then<br/>\n&gt;                 the bats won&#39;t agro on you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; To UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; and reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n&gt; ======================================================================== </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
