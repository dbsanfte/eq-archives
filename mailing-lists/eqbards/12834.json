I am willing to buy<br/>\n  the fact that CCC adjusts faction by X amount, and if you are too<br/>\n  dubious to some faction it will only bump you up to apprehensive.<br/>\n  If you are only slightly dubious, it could put you to indifferent<br/>\n  or even low amiable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But to say players can go from dubious to amiable with a flute is not<br/>\n  always a true statement.  Nor does the flute always show a faction<br/>\n  difference, if the adjustment is minor and your faction is in the <br/>\n  lowest range of the category.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, I admit the flute may boost the amount of faction given, however<br/>\n  faction levels are not static 1 or 2 faction level jumps I&#39;m guessing.<br/>\n  The song appears to give +numeric faction, and not +category faction.<br/>\n  This is important in understanding the effects of the song.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
