As<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; guild was doing a Najena raid I really wanted to get back to the<br/>\n&quot;mainland&quot;<br/>\n&gt; from Kunark on Saturday...  Saturday night I still found myself in Kunark<br/>\n&gt; trying to help a friend get his char. to level 19 for the raid.  We found<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; great group near the goblin ruins at the Lake and just flew.  We cycled<br/>\n&gt; through a heap of group members but almost always kept a full group.  It<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; insane!  We were basically fighting non-stop pulling blues to yellows.  We<br/>\n&gt; tried one or two pulls out of the Ruins and died massive deaths ;)  So at<br/>\n&gt; 2am(+10 GMT) Sunday morning I made level 20!  One level in one day! I was<br/>\n&gt; just wrapped!  At 2:02am  my first skill hit master and I was already off<br/>\n&gt; and pulling again for the group (after we stopped for some SS&#39;s of my<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; 20 group).  I had a guild member and friend that wanted to come along for<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; naming &quot;ceremony&quot;.  So at 2:35am Jacana got her surname and more SS&#39;s were<br/>\n&gt; taken :)  A few more pulls were done and then I went to bad a very happy<br/>\n&gt; camper.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sundays guild Najena raid was a bomb for us (and for the rest of the<br/>\nguild).<br/>\n&gt; A group of us decided we were going to head back to Kunark.  As we went<br/>\n&gt; through the forest we smacked around some DE&#39;s :)  Then in ECommons I got<br/>\n&gt; side tracked (MMMMM! Male Half-Elf Bards) and they headed on with out me.<br/>\n&gt; Of the group of 5 two logged but 3 would still be enough in Kunark.  So I<br/>\n&gt; finally caught up with them in FV and it was only then I realised I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get my songs I wanted.  So I ran back to the boat in time to see it pull<br/>\noff<br/>\n&gt; (bloody trams!).  That was enough!  Another member logged so two were<br/>\nleft.<br/>\n&gt; I shouted for a TP back to BB and we found one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Off to get songs I went.  And suddenly got in my head that tonight was<br/>\n&gt; Lambent Bracers night!  After a few hours of shouting I got my &#39;feene<br/>\ncharm<br/>\n&gt; and a lambent stone (from a friend) and the darkbone was already in my<br/>\nbank<br/>\n&gt; from some nice people in Unrest days...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So after I hit Eurdin for my songs it was off for the Lambents.  I<br/>\nrealised<br/>\n&gt; when I got to the temple it said 550gp.  I had everything in PP *DOH*  So<br/>\n&gt; back to the bank I went and back again.  Finally at about 10:45 last night<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; ended up with my first piece of lambents!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I was given two amazing weapons by a very very sweet high level bard<br/>\n&gt; this weekend (as well as a few pieces of armour).  My thulian claw and<br/>\n&gt; silvery war axe have been replaced with a Sainy&#39;s Claw and a Gleaming<br/>\nBroad<br/>\n&gt; Sword (or is it short sword?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that&#39;s what I call bards luck ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Smurf Wannabe,<br/>\n&gt; Jacana Mourningsong, Wood Elf Bard of the 20th song, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop online together.
