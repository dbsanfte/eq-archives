I&#39;ll mash my NumLock key to start<br/>\n&gt; running, switch to my hotkey bank that holds my meelee and inv slots and<br/>\n&gt; start swapping, all the sudden I&#39;m not running anymore and/or my Selo&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; been ended. Now I have either stand still and finish swapping weapon &<br/>\n&gt; shield for an instrument or I have to mash the NumLock again, switch back<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; my songs hotkey bank, hit Selo&#39;s (several times lately before it works),<br/>\n&gt; switch back to my slots bank, finish swapping items and hope I&#39;m still<br/>\n&gt; alive<br/>\n&gt; in the time that it took to do the above. <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This happened to me all of the time.  To solve it, I put Selo&#39;s into the<br/>\n&gt; #6<br/>\n&gt; spot on my inventory hotkey bank.  If I get stunned or Selo&#39;s stops whilst<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; am trying to switch to the drum, I just hit &quot;numlock&quot; to start running,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;6&quot;<br/>\n&gt; to get Selo&#39;s going, and then try to complete the weapon/drum switch --<br/>\n&gt; none<br/>\n&gt; of that &quot;shift-X&quot; crap is needed to switch hotkey banks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ranulf<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 13th Measure<br/>\n&gt; Tunare Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\n&gt; Join our community member news update at <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
