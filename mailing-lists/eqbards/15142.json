Something<br/>\nlike a duet between Jonthan and Lyssa.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I would love to see Verant break away from the one song a level thing<br/>\nand give us some other songs to play with.  I of course want a bind and a<br/>\ngate. And a feign death song would make us much better pullers. Ports to the<br/>\nstages all over Norath would have to be my absolute most wanted feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nKealus<br/>\nEc&#39;i</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
