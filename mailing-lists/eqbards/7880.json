I regularly run from Qeynos to<br/>\nRivervale checking every merchant in W Karana, N Karana, E Karana and Misty.<br/>\nAt the same time I auction as I run to buy them for 4gp each.  Merchants<br/>\nsell them for 2.4 gp each when you can find them.  I also use the 4gp price<br/>\nto figure my pricing and profits and even at that price the armor sells<br/>\nwell.  I also try to kill as many spiders as I can.  The ones in E Karana<br/>\nseem to drop silk more often than the lower level ones elsewhere.  I&#39;d get<br/>\nused to the fact though that tailoring is the only trade skill where you<br/>\ncannot raise your skill solely on store bought items.  also with fish you<br/>\nwill make more money with fish fillets than with fishrolls if money making<br/>\nis your aim.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n\tMaster Baker<br/>\n\tCapable Tailor<br/>\n\tCapable Smith<br/>\n\tCapable Brewer<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 1:38 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] A trade skill question for the gallery.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question for you Kitasi (or anyone else), where do you get your<br/>\nspider silks?

This is what I would like to do with<br/>\nspider silks instead of running all over the place at level 29 killing<br/>\nspiders like some kind of wild neurotic arachnophobe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHints, suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n Master Brewer<br/>\n Master Potter<br/>\n Master Fisherman<br/>\n E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.

Raw silk begins triviality <br/>\n&gt; at 33 (gloves,<br/>\n&gt; mask) and is still not all trivial at 39.  Cured Silk does not begin<br/>\n&gt; triviality until after at least 44 where I am now unless it <br/>\n&gt; is the masks,<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t made one of those in a few points.  Also the raw silk <br/>\n&gt; and Cured silk<br/>\n&gt; will sell to vendors for about break even.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; suggest that unless<br/>\n&gt; desperate though since the Cured is selling for 2-3pp per AC <br/>\n&gt; point currently<br/>\n&gt; (at least on E&#39;ci) and even the raw silk sells at 1pp+ per Ac <br/>\n&gt; pt.  Boots are<br/>\n&gt; the biggest sellers for me.  No one seems to want a raw silk <br/>\n&gt; tunic, but the<br/>\n&gt; Cured Silk tunic is so popular (due to giving that buff <br/>\n&gt; guildmaster look) I<br/>\n&gt; have been selling them for 25pp with no complaints or <br/>\n&gt; question.  The Cured<br/>\n&gt; pants are also very popular because the AC to wt ratio for <br/>\n&gt; them is ungodly<br/>\n&gt; good compared to even mesh.  Pants normally have the worst <br/>\n&gt; AC/wt ratio of<br/>\n&gt; any piece in an armor set so these are an amazing upgrade <br/>\n&gt; even over mesh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi soon to be master tailor <br/>\n&gt; \t(assuming bards don&#39;t have another ridiculous skill cap <br/>\n&gt; that stops<br/>\n&gt; me!)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
