It was usually only where high <br/>\n&gt; resistances were<br/>\n&gt; needed, like Kithicor.  I was around level 29 or 30 at the <br/>\n&gt; time so I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; a battery.  It was set up like this:<br/>\n&gt; Slot 1: Anthem<br/>\n&gt; Slot 2: Elemental Rythms<br/>\n&gt; Slot 3: Primary hand<br/>\n&gt; Slot 4: Secondary hand<br/>\n&gt; Slot 5: Inventory slot<br/>\n&gt; Slot 6: Inventory slot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Depending on how fast you get you can do it like this:  While <br/>\n&gt; moving the<br/>\n&gt; primary weapon out of the primary slot start up your <br/>\n&gt; instrument song, drop<br/>\n&gt; the primary weapon on the drum in the inventory then drop the <br/>\n&gt; drum on the<br/>\n&gt; secondary weapon.  Keep the secondary weapon in your cursor, <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t put it<br/>\n&gt; in the inventory.  Once it pulses start another song and swap <br/>\n&gt; the secondary<br/>\n&gt; weapon and the instrument, drop the instrument on the primary <br/>\n&gt; weapon and<br/>\n&gt; equip it.  Once you get good at this you can try taking out one of the<br/>\n&gt; inventory slots in the hot bank and replace it with a third song.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Steve<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 08:23 AM 11/13/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt <br/>\n&gt; whose main is a bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and <br/>\n&gt; there... &quot;less<br/>\n&gt; &gt;talking more twisting!&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three <br/>\n&gt; to four songs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory <br/>\n&gt; slots, and #2 bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt;set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, <br/>\n&gt; switch to #1, switch<br/>\n&gt; &gt;out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new <br/>\n&gt; song without<br/>\n&gt; &gt;missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one <br/>\n&gt; of those things<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to <br/>\n&gt; switch hotkey<br/>\n&gt; &gt;banks...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Tani, 35th Bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Halana, 57th Shaman<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Paradigm<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; eLerts<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s Easy.
