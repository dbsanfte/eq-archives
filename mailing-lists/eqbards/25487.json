I started out in Frontier Mtns...more to just<br/>\nget the rythym down with minimum risk.  Except for the goblin rockcrusher<br/>\n(rock something...can&#39;t remember), that has a good range nuke on him...hehe.<br/>\nFrom there, I tried in OT, with some pretty good success.  Then went on a<br/>\nguild trip to CoM, after which, I went to GD, and tried a frost giant.<br/>\nHehe...what a miserable failure.  They *must* have a much higher MR than<br/>\nmost other mobs.  So, since I&#39;m there, I&#39;m nearby for faction raids to Kael,<br/>\nand will just do the bears...hopefully, they don&#39;t resist as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the advice!  I haven&#39;t paid much attention to<br/>\nJonathans...then at advice given, I look...how in the hell did I overlook<br/>\nthat it&#39;s a 25% haste!?!?!  hehe...live and learn<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!!<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I was in a guild group in CoM last night.  Me at 40, the next lowest<br/>\nwas 51, and the highest a 60, and my xp bar moved like it wasn&#39;t even in a<br/>\nhell level.  I&#39;ll be pestering my guild to do those little raids like that<br/>\nmore often.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Egelhof, Tobias [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tobias.egelhof@...\">tobias.egelhof@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 8:53 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: AW: [eqbards] In a rut at 40<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ndo not kill frost giants, they have too many hps. go to OT and<br/>\nchant-/fearkite chicken and pickles, they give good xp till 46 (got<br/>\npowerlevelled through half 45 on a single evening there by a druid).<br/>\n<br/>\nbeware the sabretooth tigers though, they can be mean!<br/>\n<br/>\ntobi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Urspr├╝ngliche Nachricht-----<br/>\nVon: Christopher Sanders [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christopher.sanders@...\">christopher.sanders@...</a>]<br/>\nGesendet am: Dienstag, 9.

I&#39;m sick<br/>\nof being 40!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also sick of pickup groups!  Heh.  So, any advice would be welcome on<br/>\nwhere to go at this level, and what song combination to use to solo me 2<br/>\nbubbles as quickly as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been using chains-fulfils-tuyens, but it takes so long to kill a frost<br/>\ngiant this way...I get bored quickly (hence, 40 for a month...hehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
