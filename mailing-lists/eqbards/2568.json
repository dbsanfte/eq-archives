I am not blaming a tobacco company(what a retarded analogy).  I am <br/>\nexploiting a bug I *did not* create and harm is in the eye of the beholder.  <br/>\nIf I see no harm in it, and I am not forcing you out of your character into <br/>\nmy powergaming, so...what the F do you care?  I certainly don&#39;t see it as <br/>\nharmful.  I will not die from it.  You will not die from it.  The problem <br/>\nreverts itself straight back to the &quot;I don&#39;t like the way you play so I am <br/>\ngoing to complain about you&quot; proselytizing you chartruese dorks do so well.  <br/>\nPiss off, girly.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
