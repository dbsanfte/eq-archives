The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1783322517\">I&#39;ve been through the place from stem to stern invis and had zero mobs see<br/>\nthrough.  I have heard reports of a select few of the mobs seeing invis<br/>\nthough.  The place&#39;s mobs are in the 33-36 range.  In some places they&#39;re<br/>\nclumped up pretty well and you&#39;ll either need a very high level puller or an<br/>\nenchanter to get the job done.  Even though it&#39;s all green to me I still<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t guarantee that at 51 I could pull singles, I&#39;d have to try it.<br/>\nLament would help obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a repost of my report from a couple of weeks ago regarding the<br/>\nBurynai Bundt Cake quest:<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to the Temple of Droga and the Mines of Nurga alone last night<br/>\nspecifically looking for ovens.  There are NO ovens or other appliances that<br/>\nI could find in the Mines of Nurga.  There is an oven in the Temple of Droga<br/>\nin a goblin building waaay in the back in a section of the dungeon that is<br/>\nhidden behind a secret wall.  I opened it and it is a standard six-slot<br/>\noven.  In addition to the oven, when I was there one of the guards standing<br/>\ndirectly to the right of the door leading into the space where the oven is<br/>\nhad a book.  He was the &quot;goblin fanatic&quot;.  The mobs in that space are all<br/>\nlevel 33-38 or so and fairly densely packed, so although I could have taken<br/>\nthe Fanatic down solo several of his buddies would definitely have jumped to<br/>\nhis aid and killed me (many are casters as well).  It would have been<br/>\nsimilar to fighting three or four Greater Kobolds in Sol B simultaneously -<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t have won and the corpse retrieval would have been very difficult<br/>\nand time consuming.  So I briefly tried to get some guildmates interested,<br/>\nbut going way to the back of a mid-level dungeon located in the center of a<br/>\nzone that no one was near so that I might be able to bake a cake really<br/>\ndidn&#39;t interest them...  ;-/<br/>\n<br/>\nOne interesting sidebar is that the Jail has a Pottery Wheel in a jail cell<br/>\nbehind a locked door.  Now this is probably for another quest or something,<br/>\nbut it raises the remote possibility in my mind that we might have to make a<br/>\nBundt Cake Pan.<br/>\n<br/>\nMini-Spoiler:<br/>\nWhen I was there (alone and invis) nothing attacked me and I had free run of<br/>\nthe place.  I don&#39;t recall seeing any mobs other than goblins except for a<br/>\ncouple of Iksar prisoners in a jail (i.e. no lone Burynai Prisoner or<br/>\nsomething that might drop some Burynai Meat).  Word of advice: I fell into<br/>\nthe pit trap located on the map pointed to in this thread.  You fall into a<br/>\njail cell and into a locked room.  Presumably if you kill the three goblins<br/>\nin this room one or more will drop a key for you.  I didn&#39;t find out because<br/>\nafter I memmed some songs and was working up the courage to Lament the first<br/>\ncouple the wandering goblin was kind enough to open the locked doors for me,<br/>\nso I scooted out invis and didn&#39;t have to fight.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no garauntee that the book has anything to do with the quest.  In<br/>\nfact, I would think that a recipe would drop as a scroll and not a book, and<br/>\nnot off of a &quot;Goblin Fanatic&quot; but a &quot;Goblin Pastry Chef&quot; hehe... but who<br/>\nknows.  Verant has surprised me before.  A lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pieces are starting to come together on this quest.  Let&#39;s keep pushing<br/>\non it.<br/>\n<br/>\n[51 Minstrel] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Anyone have much experience in Droga?  There&#39;s a nifty range slot item,<br/>\n&gt; 10ac, 7str, 10sta that drops in there.
