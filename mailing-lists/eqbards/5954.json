It is also possible to jump all gaps in the wall if you have Selo&#39;s blasting and the drum on.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To get up there you have to Enter the Jade Tiger Inn, that is opposite the Bank.  then you go up the stairs and enter the first room on the right, and jump up on the balcony railing, then onto the wall :).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to worry about falling under the world up there, because there is a zone border that stops you, although I would be careful....<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, go off and confuse everyone by jumping on top of the bank, and running along the walls :).<br/>\n<br/>\nGleeman Merrilin, Bard of the 20th Chorus.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
