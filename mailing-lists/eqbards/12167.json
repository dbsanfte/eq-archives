At one time I had 116 STR and 151 DEX and I still<br/>\nmissed alot. Dex didn&#39;t seem to improve my hitting ability at all. So<br/>\neventually I scrapped DEX altogether since I felt it was useless to a<br/>\nbard, despite being a &quot;primary&quot; stat. I feel cheated to have given my<br/>\nbard a starting dex of 90 but oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow DEX does add mana for a bard though right? I suppose this is true,<br/>\nbut I hardly get a chance to use dirge in the first place, seeing as how<br/>\nwhenever I get res&#39;d, all my mana zips to 0 and before I can regain 4<br/>\nbars of it, I&#39;m dead/getting res&#39;d again. And yea, hunting in the planes<br/>\nat 50, I die too often. Also, another thing about bard mana... I got<br/>\nsuper drunk which dropped my int to 15, then sobered back up to where my<br/>\nint was back to normal and I was missing a full bubble of mana. So int<br/>\ndefinitely plays a part in our mana amount, but I have yet to confirm<br/>\ndex or cha for doing so. I&#39;ll have to test that out.<br/>\nSo I&#39;d suggest you sacrifice dex for STR, unless you have a Proc&#39;ing<br/>\nweapon in which it&#39;d be good to have some dex without totally killing<br/>\nstrength.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
