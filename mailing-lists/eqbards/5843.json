I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant the fun of being a Bard to run out so quickly!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started numerous characters and have had the most fun being the Bard<br/>\nwithout question.  The only character that was almost as much &quot;raw fun&quot; was<br/>\nthe Troll Shadowknight that I played up to level 5 and deleted (I was<br/>\nspreading myself too thin over too many characters).  I figure in two months<br/>\nwhen my Bard is 50th and the Plane of Fear is getting old (sarcasm) I think<br/>\nI&#39;ll start a Troll Shaman or something.  Lotta fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only stressful thing about being a Bard is dropping things through the<br/>\ncracks in the Inventory slots moved to the hotkeys.  I dropped a set of Bladed<br/>\nThulian Claws the other night and they&#39;re LORE.  They were destroyed before<br/>\nthey hit the ground - 700pp flushed.  That was Saturday night and I still<br/>\nhaven&#39;t fully recovered from it - I was genuinely enraged at the game eating<br/>\nthat much time and money (substatial at level 17/18, I assure you).  My<br/>\nstomach hurts when I think about it.  If anyone on Fennin Ro feels like<br/>\nselling me another set (or perhaps a Silvery War Axe), please look me up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; P.S.  I was talking to a higher level ranger friend of mine and he asked if<br/>\n&gt; I needed any foraged food or water.  I said I forage as well and had plenty<br/>\n&gt; thanks.  I got a kick out of his next statement which was &quot;Is there anything<br/>\n&gt; that you don&#39;t do?!?&quot;  As I said before, gotta love being a bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kurik Nitesong<br/>\n&gt; 23rd bard (Sliver from 24 and all the extra pretty lights)<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
