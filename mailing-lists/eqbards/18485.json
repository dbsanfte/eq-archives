If you try to sing the level 51 travel song <br/>\n&gt; with a Drum of<br/>\n&gt; the March the song will behave as if you don&#39;t have a drum <br/>\n&gt; because you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; exceeding the speed cap.  So it plays as if you were just <br/>\n&gt; singing it (still<br/>\n&gt; fast but uh....)  Fastest drum to use for lvl 51 song is the <br/>\n&gt; one from Kedge<br/>\n&gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia Jongleur </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
