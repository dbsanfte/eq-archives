It&#39;s just easier to go to PoG and <br/>\nfarm Resonant than it is to quest for Melodic in Thurgadin.<br/>\n<br/>\nHighsun armor from Skyshrine was superior to the above in every way <br/>\n(example: BP has 50 AC). It had a yellow guardian armor look. A couple <br/>\npatches ago it was changed to Twilight armor with a dark gray guardian armor <br/>\nlook. Stats are same as before, they just changed the name and color.<br/>\n<br/>\nTroubador armor from Kael is the highest AC armor for bards (BP has 54 AC). <br/>\nIt had a teal guardian armor look. A couple of patches ago the tint on the <br/>\narmor was changed to burgundy, but the name and stats are the same to my <br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
