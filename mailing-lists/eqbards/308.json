It<br/>\nserved me well so far.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a few higher level bards might compile a larger list, though I won&#39;t<br/>\nbe needing it for a while.  I like Rynn&#39;s descriptions because they&#39;re<br/>\npersonal, perhaps that&#39;s why I kept them.

Saves immense amounts of time... and gets faster as you get<br/>\nhigher in levels. So fast actually, that bards get the safe fall skill later<br/>\non, so that we don&#39;t damage ourselves going down hills.<br/>\n<br/>\n     6 Hymn of restoration<br/>\n<br/>\n     THE SONG number two! Wait for the lute though to see the full<br/>\npotential. At level 26 I believe I heal 14 to 16 hit points per &quot;flash&quot; in<br/>\ngame. When you first get the lute you can expect to heal at 6 per flash.<br/>\n<br/>\n     7 Johnthan&#39;s whistling warsong<br/>\n<br/>\n     Speeds up self attack, and adds str and AC. Perfect soloing song.<br/>\n<br/>\n     8 Kelin&#39;s lugubrious lament<br/>\n<br/>\n     Very different type of song. Say you have two monster&#39;s next to each<br/>\nother... and you only want to attack one.  You cast lament on one, then<br/>\nattack the other. The lamented one will not &quot;help&quot; the other one. Make sure<br/>\nyou &quot;pull&quot; the monster though, as the song effect wears off quickly, and you<br/>\nwant to be a ways away when that happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n     9 Elemental rythms<br/>\n<br/>\n     Adds to resist of magic, fire and cold. You will not use this one until<br/>\nmuch later in the game. No need to buy it at level 9<br/>\n<br/>\n     10 Anthem de arms<br/>\n<br/>\n     Kinda like a full party level 7 song. Excellent song... must have.<br/>\nSpeeds up party attack (and speeds it up more and more as you gain levels)<br/>\n<br/>\n     11 Cinda&#39;s charismatic carillion<br/>\n<br/>\n     Dunno what is wrong with this song... but it does not seem to work.<br/>\nSupposed to add charisma to yourself but all it does is &quot;nothing&quot; I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbuy it unless you know how to use it (in which case please tell me) or until<br/>\nthey fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\n     12 Brusco&#39;s boastful bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\n     long range damage for 7 to start... gets higher as you go up (at level<br/>\n26 this song does 14 per hit for me).  IMPORTANT SONG great for pulling or<br/>\njust dealing additional damage during a fight<br/>\n<br/>\n     13 Purifying rythms<br/>\n<br/>\n     adds to poison, disease and magic resist. Never used this one<br/>\nreally.... as it does not stack with elemental rythms, and more often than<br/>\nnot you want that resist from fire and cold... not poison and disease.<br/>\n<br/>\n     14 Lyssa&#39;s cataloging lyric<br/>\n<br/>\n     No need for this song since magic items already appear as identified.<br/>\nBesides it costs like 20 PP...<br/>\n<br/>\n     15 Kelin&#39;s lucid lullaby<br/>\n<br/>\n     GOt 100 monsters attacking you? Want them to stop? Play this song and<br/>\nput them all to sleep... If yer good enough.... you could sleep 10 or so<br/>\nmonsters comfortably while your party kills them one at a time. GREAT<br/>\nsong... and HEAVILY used at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n     16 Tarew&#39;s aquatic something or other :)<br/>\n<br/>\n     Water breathing. Only thing I have used it for it to take a peek into<br/>\nKedge Keep... and underwater dungeon that  NEEDS some kind of water<br/>\nbreathing since it is ALL underwater. Level 40 plus dungeon I hear.. and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t doubt it since the darn fish there are red to me at 26 :) No real need<br/>\nto buy this one until later, but good song for practicing wind instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\n     17 Guardian rythms<br/>\n<br/>\n     I have begun using this song ALOT. When you are up against casting<br/>\nmonsters, this song puts up a spell shield, and raises magic resist by alot.<br/>\nGives you a few AC too.<br/>\n<br/>\n     18 Denon&#39;s disruptive discord.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Uses BRASS, so I never used the song... until a few days ago. GREAT<br/>\nSONG Lowers target AC, and damages  them about one and a half times as much<br/>\nas the level two song does. Use it and get yer brass skill up there....<br/>\nyou&#39;ll want it for the level 26 song. Area effect<br/>\n<br/>\n     19 Shauri&#39;s sonorous clouding.<br/>\n<br/>\n     party invisible. Rough song... works fine solo, but if you are using a<br/>\ngroup you will want see invis on everyone, or else it will be too hard to<br/>\nfollow everyone when you cannot see them. Important for getting corpses deep<br/>\nin the  higher level dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\n     20 Largo&#39;s melodic binding<br/>\n<br/>\n     Area effect lowers target attack speed and AC. I never really used this<br/>\none... but perhaps it will come in useful later.<br/>\n<br/>\n     21 Melanie&#39;s mellifluous motion.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Teleport random direction, random distance. This song is a cruel joke<br/>\nin my opininon, as I see no use for it yet but to plant yourself in the<br/>\nmiddle of a nest of monsters that will beat the crap out of you. I will have<br/>\nto experiment more with it though... could be useful.. but I highly doubt<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n     22 Alenia&#39;s disenchanting melody<br/>\n<br/>\n     Same as wizard cancel magic spell. works on whole party. I never used<br/>\nit.... I assume it is useful later.<br/>\n<br/>\n     23 Selo&#39;s consonant chain.<br/>\n<br/>\n     BUY IT This is a great soloing song. This will do two things... slow<br/>\nthe target to a walk if it is running after you, or root it if the target is<br/>\nescaping. Wanna get rid of Ambassador DVinn? sing this song on him and blast<br/>\naway at him  with the level 12 song as he walks around helpless. (Although,<br/>\nthat tactic will take you a long time... and is so boring it makes ya wanna<br/>\ncry)<br/>\n<br/>\n     24 (forget the name)<br/>\n<br/>\n     Sharpens sight. Now I dunno what the heck that means but I know for one<br/>\nit lets you see invisible. It also gives everything a blueish tint... odd.<br/>\n<br/>\n     25 Psalm of warmth.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Adds to resist cold... but not enough that it seems to be worth it?<br/>\nAlthough it does use singing which is always nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n     26 Angst&#39;s appaling screech<br/>\n<br/>\n     COOL! A song with the face of death on it!! :) Grab a horn... set up<br/>\nthe song, and go get a crazy battle going.  Looks like yer gonna lose? Play<br/>\nthis song and every monster around you runs screaming. Basically a fear song<br/>\nfor bards.. but it will hit 100 targets if there are that many.<br/>\n<br/>\n     FUnny thing about this song. I was messing around in crushbone (which<br/>\nif you did not know, there is a recent problem there with retion brenclog,<br/>\nwho likes to cast 200 pets and kill the framerate in the zone) Well since<br/>\nall these pets are such low level to me, I decided I would fear them all<br/>\nwith my new song. OH JEEZ :) It worked...  and 200 pets come screaming outta<br/>\nthe hole in the ground... I kept fearing them and they ran all over the zone<br/>\ncausing such a disturbance that a GM was there within minutes to kill them<br/>\nall. (nobody got killed, the pets are neutral, friendly little guys). I wish<br/>\nI had taken screenshots as it was quite a sight to see :)<br/>\n<br/>\n     level 27 I hear is a charm spell... &quot;Oh boy!&quot; :)<br/>\n<br/>\n     Well, hope that helped a bit... keep playing the bard... and you&#39;ll<br/>\nalways be happy :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRynn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
