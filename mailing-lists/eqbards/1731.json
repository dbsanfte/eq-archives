First, I am a role-player, though probably <br/>\nnot what you would consider hard-core. As far as the plate issue, though, I <br/>\nhave to say I am all for it. If you treat EQ as a r/l situation where <br/>\neverything you encounter decides that you are public enemy number 1, any <br/>\nnormal rational being is going to say &#39;heck with any pre-concieved notion of <br/>\nhow my profession is supposed to act, give me the hardest toughest armor you <br/>\ncan find and image be damned&#39;.  Tell me how this is not appropriate <br/>\nrole-play?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want to role-play, stop and take off some of the heavier gear <br/>\nthat can interfere with your strumming when you break out that lute. If you <br/>\nhotkey your armor slots, it shouldn&#39;t take that long. As far as Selo&#39;s goes, <br/>\nyou should be able to beat a drum even in full plate.<br/>\n<br/>\nZendarin<br/>\nThe Wandering Minstrel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
