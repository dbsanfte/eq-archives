Also, note his<br/>\nconditional phrase:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unless the mob was snared or you were SoWed, you would&#39;ve died<br/>\n&gt; regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are admitting that you WERE running, but you have the advantage implied<br/>\nin the conditional phrase above (read SoWed as Selo&#39;d).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing a cleric as my alternate.  I take much more of a licking<br/>\nrunning around when something is on me, than I do when I just stand there<br/>\nand take a couple licks.  The reason is simple: the cleric-helper tank can<br/>\nhit and taunt the mob without getting the &quot;out of range&quot; messages he&#39;d be<br/>\ngetting if he were having to chase the mob around.  That mob is gonna hit<br/>\nyou regardless (unless you cheat with strafing) -- you may as well let your<br/>\ntank hit the mob while it&#39;s hitting you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Root tip is a very effective tool.  No, your bard can&#39;t stun/root.  But,<br/>\nit&#39;s a great tip for my cleric, who always has root memmed (we&#39;re trying to<br/>\ncatch up to our enchanter friend, so I&#39;m crowd control right now).<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
