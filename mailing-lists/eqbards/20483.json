You can&#39;t use Largo&#39;s or chain because<br/>\nthat interferes with their Slow spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually sing COB, Psalm or warmth and Hymm.  Not<br/>\nmuch else you can do at that point...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStupid bard, Shada?  I think not -- I always make a<br/>\npoint of reading certain posts and yours are always<br/>\namong those.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you&#39;re right, if there is an enchanter or shaman or<br/>\n&gt; both in the group then<br/>\n&gt; there is very little for a bard to do to buff the<br/>\n&gt; group, if anything but<br/>\n&gt; mana.  that&#39;s a situation where you can do some song<br/>\n&gt; damage (or take a<br/>\n&gt; breather if an easy camp and just relax, 56 levels<br/>\n&gt; of twisting songs is<br/>\n&gt; killing my fingers), and i said many times that our<br/>\n&gt; songs do a lot more<br/>\n&gt; damage than our weapons.  but if a bard is there to<br/>\n&gt; do the group buffing,<br/>\n&gt; you are not going to be using songs to do damage. <br/>\n&gt; that was my only point,<br/>\n&gt; which i regret even trying to make since it did not<br/>\n&gt; come across correctly,<br/>\n&gt; and now i am the stupid bard who doesn&#39;t know how to<br/>\n&gt; play.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m gonna have to agree to disagree on Sylly&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; side. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last night in Sebilis we had 2 groups.. including<br/>\n&gt; a Shaman and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Enchanter (2 at one point).  I didn&#39;t need to<br/>\n&gt; Haste, Slow, Snare (2 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; druids), Heal (2 clerics, 2 druids, 1 shaman)... I<br/>\n&gt; could have sang <br/>\n&gt; &gt; battle buffs to buff some str and dex and such,<br/>\n&gt; but there was only 1 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tank (Warrior) in my party... not a whole lot of<br/>\n&gt; mileage gained.  So, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I chanted (with selo&#39;s drum) and I charmed (a<br/>\n&gt; little) and I played <br/>\n&gt; &gt; mana song and bind sight to help scout in the<br/>\n&gt; downtime.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Was I being the most effective Bard I could be...<br/>\n&gt; imho, Yes.  And was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that helpful to the group?  Hell, yes.  Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; forget the magic, fire, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and cold resistances you&#39;re also lowering on top<br/>\n&gt; of the damage you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing.  That&#39;s helping every one of your nukers,<br/>\n&gt; procing weapons, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; overzealous druids with their newfound starburst,<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
