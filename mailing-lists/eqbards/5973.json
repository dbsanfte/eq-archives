Now I can&#39;t seem to avoid<br/>\nthem, it&#39;s insane how many of these things I&#39;ve run over in the past<br/>\nweek or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reference to the dying-as-you-zone-and-comming-out-at-full-health<br/>\nbug, I had an interesting variation of that happen to me yesterday on<br/>\nthe Tallon Zek (PvP-Teams) server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was hunting in a group in the Gorge, slaying mino&#39;s and muddites, when<br/>\nsome poor sap trained an Evil Eye to the runnyeye zone (close to where<br/>\nmy party was hunting).  Well, most of my group was smart (and quick)<br/>\nenough to zone out in time, but I (being the fool I am) decided to climb<br/>\nup the wall and see if I couldn&#39;t sit just out of the eye&#39;s sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that worked for a bit, long enough for an older (19-20 IIRC)<br/>\nmagician to come and try his luck on the eye.  Well, he was doing all<br/>\nright, he got the allready hurt eye down to just a sliver, when all of a<br/>\nsudden, he stopped fighting.  Well, I didn&#39;t realize what happened right<br/>\naway, but he had been charmed.  Anyways, me being the fool that I am,<br/>\ndecided to help the magician out.  I jumped off the wall and jumped in<br/>\nto face the eye head on.  This is where I will point out that my<br/>\ncharacter on Tallon Zek is only 13th level right now, and not much of a<br/>\nmatch for an eye at all.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, needless to say, I was quickly knocked down to half a bubble and<br/>\nwas making my way to the zone.  Just as I hit the zone wall, I crashed<br/>\nout of EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon returning to Norrath, the character screen showed my wireframe in<br/>\nfull armour and my location was Runny Eye.  Good enough, I must have<br/>\nmade it!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I enter the world and meet with my party who are all amazed to see me<br/>\nalive.  (This is when I noticed I was back to full health).<br/>\nWell, we try to regroup and realize we can&#39;t (fair enough, I had just<br/>\ngone LD, and my ghost was still grouped with them.)  So we all camp to<br/>\nfix the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon returning to the character select screen, I notice my wireframe is<br/>\nnow naked, and my location was Rivervale (my current bind spot).<br/>\nThis startled me a bit, but hey, I must have somehow died while camping<br/>\n(after this last week of bugs, it wouldn&#39;t suprize me).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I enter the world, hurry on to Runnyeye and go looking for my corpse.<br/>\nWell, /corpse reported that I didn&#39;t have a corpse in the zone.<br/>\nStrange, I thought.  Well, I zoned into Beholder again to rejoin my<br/>\nparty and see if they had seen anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, one of my group members reported that he had just seen me charmed<br/>\nby an evil eye and was following it around dutifully as it&#39;s pet. (Note,<br/>\nit had been almost an hour since the battle with the eye at this point).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, after all was said and done, this is what I figured out happened:<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as I zoned, I was hit by the (then) charmed magician and dropped.<br/>\n(not killed.)  My computer crashes.  My character then splits into two.<br/>\nThe first one is laying on the ground in Beholder, the second is zoning<br/>\ninto runnyeye linkdead.  Well, the one in beholder regains conciousness<br/>\nand is then quickly charmed by the Evil Eye.  Theone in runnyeye zones<br/>\nin with less than 1 hit, and the server gets confused and gives me full<br/>\nhealth.<br/>\nWhen I camped, the server realized there were two of me, and promptly<br/>\nhad them both killed, and one of the corpses removed.  I later found my<br/>\ncorpse way into the maze in the gorge, much further than I ever could<br/>\nhave gotten safely without a bit of help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I&#39;m about ready for bug week to end =)  This new patch has<br/>\nsomething against me, and I want to know what it is before my corpse<br/>\nends up not comming back next time =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nLokar of The Soerbaird, 15th Bard, Fennin Ro<br/>\nSpite, 13th Rogue, Tallon Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n This message was sent from Castle Rock BBS - telnet casrock.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
