I have already seen shaman who forgets to heal the<br/>\nwarrior in combat but dumps his mana with heals after combat while Hymm is<br/>\nplaying - just young I guess.  And the druid who wont melee and leaves as<br/>\nsoon as he dings - just a weenie I guess.  Others who ask for SoW after I<br/>\nexplain that Selo&#39;s will unroot them but will cancel SoW, etc. etc.  You<br/>\nneed know how to assist and how to deal with multiple mob fights. BTW: I am<br/>\njust dying to try the Lullaby with a Lute in there - but think I&#39;ll do it<br/>\nright near the zone the first time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think another key is to gather a party with the correct levels - not<br/>\nfor xp distribution so much as for taking collateral damage.  Tanks can be<br/>\nyounger - casters and bards need to be older - just so they can last thru a<br/>\ncouple hard hitting rounds during the beginning of an evac and run for the<br/>\nzone when they get mobbed by the bad stuff they cant fight. Skel Monk? wtf??<br/>\nwho invited him? ZONE!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far we have not done rooms - we sit by the wall and pull from back<br/>\ndoor/side door.  We tried to hold the side room but highers were pulling<br/>\nstuff thru our room and we got chased out.  So far we been working yard<br/>\ntrash and ghouls and dry bones we can pull. Guess those all are yard trash<br/>\nto highers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the last pulls of the night was one of the best - we got mobbed by<br/>\ntoo much stuff!  But this time everyone heeded the ZONE call and our ranger<br/>\neven yelled ROOTED so I could fire up Selos and break him loose.  I tried to<br/>\nstay right behind everyone as we ran for the zone.  Everyone lived! Finally<br/>\nfelt like the team was a team.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tAbraham Hardjana<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, August 31, 1999 10:53 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_eqbards@onelist.com\">_eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] WTB Thulian Claws on Innoruuk<br/>\n& Unrest notes<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Abraham Hardjana<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSylly,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI have almost lived in Unrest from levels 14-24.  Yes this<br/>\nplace can be<br/>\n\t\texciting, but it can be quite tedious at times.  As bard<br/>\nthere are<br/>\n\t\tactually very few items that you will really want in here.<br/>\nMostly the BS<br/>\n\t\tmantl and BS Tunic unless you are a wood elf, then small<br/>\nbronze looks<br/>\n\t\tquite attractive.   After many successful and unsuccessful<br/>\ncampaigns in<br/>\n\t\tUnrest I have found  that the following group make up<br/>\nprovides the<br/>\n\t\tgreatest balance while holding a room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI find that <br/>\n\t\t2 tanks (warrior, monk, ranger, paladin, shadowknight)<br/>\n\t\t1 bard <br/>\n\t\t2 cleric<br/>\n\t\t1 DD caster<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWhenever I get a group like this holding a room like the<br/>\nGhoul Magi room,<br/>\n\t\tHand room or the Barrom is quite easy.  Once you get your<br/>\nlevel 23 things<br/>\n\t\tget better because you are able to stop the runners if you<br/>\nhave no ranger<br/>\n\t\tor Druid.
