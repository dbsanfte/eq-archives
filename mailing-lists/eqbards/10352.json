After experiencing the kind of openess that Asherons Call<br/>\nallows, Everquest is really starting to feel like an apartment with 3<br/>\nfamilies living in it. The Kithicor change is a classic example of this.<br/>\nThey took a well used travel corridor and turned it into a death trap so<br/>\nthat high level players wouldn&#39;t have to fight 90 other people for a spot in<br/>\nlower guk. The problem is that since travel is so restrictive (through zone<br/>\npoints) that the younger players don&#39;t have much alternative.<br/>\nEverquest simply cannot expand fast enough to support the players. A new<br/>\ncontinent in March? Oh joy.....we need it now. For the average high level<br/>\nplayer (between lvl 40-50) you can count on one hand the number of zones<br/>\nthat are desirable to go to, and in all of those zones, you are gonna find a<br/>\nlarge number of players already there.<br/>\nMonster boosting would be a better choice than player nerfing, but it<br/>\nrequires more new places to go where the new creatures could be added in,<br/>\nleaving the lower level creatures in tact for the newer players.<br/>\nUnfortunately Verant has already proven to us that this will never happen.<br/>\nThey simply do not have the capability to add on new zones quickly. Since<br/>\nretail release (and correct me if I&#39;m wrong) a grand whopping total of 3<br/>\nzones have been added, two of which are only for extremely high level<br/>\nplayers, and the other is just for quests. 3 zones have been completely<br/>\nrevamped (Kith and Kedge and Perma), but again, revamping takes away from<br/>\nthe younger players and gives to the higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ is stagnating because it isn&#39;t growing. Stagnation is slow death.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well.......here is hoping that the next crop of MMRPG&#39;s (Heroes Journey<br/>\nand Shadowbane) allow for the easy expansion of the world by the game<br/>\ndesigners. Then maybe these problems would have a chance of being solved.<br/>\n<br/>\nDank</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
