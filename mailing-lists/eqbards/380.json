I think that grouping is about the only way to<br/>\npractice it. Going solo would prolly get you spanked by anything that would<br/>\nactually raise your skill since it would take a while longer to kill it and<br/>\nhealing will only be doing 2 add&#39;l points with the lute.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWell... It might be practicable with dual wield. I don&#39;t know.

I would love to continue pounding my drum and<br/>\npunch my enemy in synchrony with the beat of my tune. However so far,<br/>\nmy delicate hands yield very little damage, unless holding a weapon.<br/>\nI was wondering if any fellow bard has an excellent hand to hand<br/>\nskill. Is it worth practicing? What is the most damage that can be<br/>\ninflicted with ones bare bard hands?<br/>\nVisha of Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
