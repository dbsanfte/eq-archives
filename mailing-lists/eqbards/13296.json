I was the lowest at 31st level.  We only had five people in the<br/>\ngroup so when a 34 necro shouted he wanted to join a party I told him we had<br/>\na spot.  When the necro joined the party, he told us that that he had almost<br/>\nno experience fighting in groups before.  He stated that he had soloed all<br/>\nthe way from 1st level to 34th level and only had 10 days played time.  He<br/>\nstated that only now since he was at 34th did he find it necessary to join<br/>\ngroups to get good EXP.  I have heard that necros were the best at soloing<br/>\nso I had trouble believing what he said.  I am 31st level with 29 days<br/>\nplayed time.  A friend of mine is a 36 enchanter with 50 days played time.<br/>\nSomeone in the party asked him if he had friends that helped him powerlevel<br/>\nto 34th.  He said that he had done it all by himself and that he just knew<br/>\nthe right places to camp.  Does this sound credible that a necro can solo to<br/>\n34th in only 10 days played time?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
