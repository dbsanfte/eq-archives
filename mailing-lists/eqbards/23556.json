The base code in Windows ME is the same kernel code as in Win95 .. 98 etc Win2k however is built with much of the same","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-192112914\">Hmm this was my understanding ....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe base code in Windows ME is the same &quot;kernel&quot; code as in Win95 .. 98 etc<br/>\n<br/>\nWin2k however is built with much of the same code used in WindowsNT (thier<br/>\nadvertised as stable business OS).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn both cases IMHO how it runs on your box with your cards and your software<br/>\nwill come down to how dependent on the OS your application is for one.  And<br/>\non the layers (drivers for example) where you are OS interface dependent ..<br/>\ndid the vendor both sign the non-compete clause with Microsoft and therby<br/>\ngettng access to the preferred and often non documented interface? and did<br/>\nthey know someone at MS to get support and confirm bugs.  Both code-bases<br/>\nhave thier issues, it just .. well depends.  So say an application that<br/>\ncodes strictly to a driver layer, and a driver layer that was written by<br/>\npeople &quot;well-connected&quot; to MS interfaces and support .. will work fine.  But<br/>\nan app which bypasses the driver layer and uses (perfectly well documented<br/>\nbtw) OS calls may really wig out ...<br/>\n<br/>\nOr what you run may have the capacity to go *poof* but you never happen to<br/>\ntrigger that exact call sequence the way you play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, your milage may vary .. a LOT.   The two code-bases due have diferent<br/>\n&quot;features&quot; ME/2k .. but ... most of the impression of one being &quot;more<br/>\nstable&quot; than the other is based on thier origins.  It will really depend on<br/>\n*what* you want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs well, there are few driver-coder organizations which wrote a lt of<br/>\ncommercial drivers for WindowNT .. so I would expect there to be a short<br/>\ntime gap while most peripheral vendors get used to the more NT-like<br/>\narchitecture of 2K. Sort of like the game gap while console game guys come<br/>\nup to speed on the PS2.   IMHO a rule of thumb for me on whether I expect my<br/>\nbox to run Win2k well .. did the makers of my cards drivers have WinNT<br/>\ndrivers for them?  If so .. its a good bet they had a jump on 2K drivers.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Menuette&#39;s typist<br/>\n&quot;I hate MS OS based memory leaks!  they make my layer look bad!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 25, 2001 2:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] (OT) Tech problem, any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has<br/>\n&gt; inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a less-than-desirable<br/>\n&gt; platform.
