My wiz fiend levi&#39;d over and dragged it out - I was rezzed and<br/>\nlooted it at the zone - but boy was I nervous while sitting in Rivervale<br/>\nwaiting for them to get it. She musta blindly clicked until she got it<br/>\ntargeted.  I consented and she dragged.  She might have pulled it to a place<br/>\nwhere Z-axis effect can pull it up to the top, zoned out,  then /corpsed it<br/>\nup to the top. (We /corpsed one from the bottom of HH canyon straight up to<br/>\nthe top ledge one time.) <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand... a high level warrior in our guild (hehe she seemed high<br/>\nto me at the time 39ish) died in lava and was told no help from GM&#39;s.  She<br/>\nwas so bummed she declared her char to be dead - and the guild held a<br/>\nfuneral for her. (She had full crafted and some nice stuff.)  Well,<br/>\napparently the fastest way to resurrect a dead 39 is to start and play a<br/>\ncleric to teens and that frustration seemed to be enough to raise the dead!<br/>\nOur warrior princess came back to life and the guild helped her get her<br/>\narmor back and replace items so she had same or as good or better stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nI zoned into Sol-A one day after a bad time with that stoopid croc the<br/>\nwizzies need for quest stuff.  Some poor solu had just died in the lava.  I<br/>\noffered to loc it and to levi him - we did this pre-bug on levi.  He managed<br/>\nto target, drag, fall in, swim, drag out, loot and get all his stuffs back.<br/>\nWoo hoo!  I was sure scared that I would try to get closer to the lava and<br/>\nfall in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava pool into Sol-b?<br/>\nDoes that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would end up in Lava<br/>\nif you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?  Like someone could zone out of sol-b<br/>\nin panic and die in the lava?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tKen Bachman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, December 06, 1999 10:00 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Ken Bachman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMy conclusion is that it is realistically only possible to<br/>\nget a corpse out of this <br/>\n\t\tlava (unless it is remarkably well-placed) if you have<br/>\nlevitate, which is a pretty high <br/>\n\t\tlevel spell for this level dungeon.  And even then, you<br/>\nprobably also want group gate. <br/>\n\t\t (Note that, with our current song, this would not be<br/>\npossible; once you fell after the <br/>\n\t\tthird pulse, you would be in the lava, and the song will NOT<br/>\nraise you out.)  I&#39;m not <br/>\n\t\tsure what sadist designed this dungeon.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tKenross Cantorforjado, 35 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
