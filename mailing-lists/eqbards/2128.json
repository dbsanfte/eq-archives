There are alot of reasons for this<br/>\nbut in the case of lullaby it&#39;s more likely to work on the<br/>\nweaker mobs and make them stand there waiting their turn to<br/>\nget beat on. If your group is smart (or well informed by you -<br/>\nI usually say inc and call first target when I&#39;m pulling), this<br/>\nshould let you control the fight very nicely. I&#39;m fighting<br/>\ntougher stuff these days but many times I had a lizard defender<br/>\nand maybe a couple warders sleeping away while we wailed on<br/>\nthe tougher sentinel in Cazic. Lullaby can turn an un-winnable<br/>\nfight into a near cake walk if you have some luck on your side<br/>\nand dont get too many resists.<br/>\n<br/>\nBerk, level 25 bard, Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
