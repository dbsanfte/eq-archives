I killed 4 Scorpions (blue <br/>\n&gt; con) and got two Stingers (wind instruments).  I am mentioning this <br/>\n&gt; because I haven&#39;t heard anyone bring up the FoB scorpions, but I have <br/>\n&gt; heard people talking about the scorpions in Overthere.  Someone was <br/>\n&gt; asking about instruments in Kunark.  I was thinking that for those <br/>\n&gt; bards playing in Kunark a lot.  This is probably a good place to <br/>\n&gt; stock up on *flutes*.  Just offer some money to newbie Iksars to <br/>\n&gt; bring you some.  I also haven&#39;t explored too much of this zone, but I <br/>\n&gt; bet that there are more scorpions scattered about and probably real <br/>\n&gt; easy to stock up on these.  Just thought I would mention this bit of <br/>\n&gt; info ;)  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I usually have tons of mino horns in the bank for corpse recovery and <br/>\n&gt; I tend to destroy them once I am back to my corpse and collecting <br/>\n&gt; lots of loot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Beatdrop Battledrum<br/>\n&gt; 44th Bard of the Karana Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Secure online gaming at William Hill Casino.
