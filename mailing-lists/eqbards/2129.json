When I first started using it with no skill, skill went <br/>\nup by like 5 points in an hour or two.  When I got back to Freeport, <br/>\nthough, I dumped 30 training points into the skill.  After that it&#39;s been <br/>\ngoing up steadily -- I&#39;m up to 80-something now.  I just switched my other <br/>\nhand from tomahawk to a Dvinn dagger, putting another 30 training points <br/>\ninto piercing, to train that skill; I&#39;ll see whether that goes up equally <br/>\nwell.  (And I still have 40 training points unspent.  Bards don&#39;t really <br/>\nhave anything to spend them on at high levels, unless we want to learn <br/>\nlanguages for no particular reason.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
