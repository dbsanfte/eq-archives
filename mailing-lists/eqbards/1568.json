It is unlikely anything will<br/>\nattack you in these zones at the walls.  Go to the mountain - and go up as<br/>\nhigh as you can.  When you get to East Commons go to the right until you hit<br/>\nthe mountain.  Run along the top of the mountain.  Zone to W Commons.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever been attacked by griffins, NPCs or Sand Giants on the North wall in W.<br/>\nCommons (but the Sand Giant do hang out on the Desert wall)<br/>\n<br/>\nContinue running along the &quot;right wall&quot; in West Commons until you get to a<br/>\ncanyon.  Go into the canyon and Zone.  Do the same in Kiticor - run along<br/>\nwall - but after a bit - don&#39;t stay up top - you can get fall damage and you<br/>\ncan miss the Rivervale Zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tjaxon@...\">tjaxon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 05, 1999 10:07 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Rivervale<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tjaxon@...\">tjaxon@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From Freeport head out into the East Commonlands.
