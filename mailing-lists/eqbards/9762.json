Almost every class is<br/>\n&quot;unfinished&quot;.  There are many spells and skills that were never implemented<br/>\nor useless.  For example many classes have the Sense Magic spell, which has<br/>\nno use at all.  And what about the poor Rogues?  They are much worse off<br/>\nthan Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad has stated numerous times that EQ is a work in progress.  If you are<br/>\ngoing to be bitter about the unfinished parts, either suck it up and live<br/>\nwith it or quit EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I still greatly doubt that a high level binding<br/>\n&gt; song would be unbalancing.

Kitasi, I thought you said the ability to bind was one of the most<br/>\nimportant abilities in the game.  How could giving Bind to Bards not be<br/>\nunbalancing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
