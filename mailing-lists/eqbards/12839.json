I know the bard with the first<br/>\n  drop.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Members of the Pantheon killed him after they themselves had perished <br/>\n  twice to the bugger and us once.  I swear the guy was doing donuts <br/>\n  around the plane looking for people to kill.  That, and the 4 mob<br/>\n  train he was carrying around with him didn&#39;t help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Needless to say, I was the only bard on the plane at the time.<br/>\n  Unfortunately, I have to wait until Maestro drops another, since<br/>\n  the weapon was &#39;accidentally&#39; looted by someone who cannot use it.<br/>\n  &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you use your evensong over your yk, Shada?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
