I m just gonna quote people w/out names, so it s gonna be kinda random. My ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2034683178\">This is the most overly-semantic, nitpicky thread I&#39;ve ever read here. :) Oh <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just gonna quote people w/out names, so it&#39;s gonna be kinda random. My <br/>\nopinions:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;well it started out by someone saying dirge was useless due to recast time <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;resists.  i said what resist problem, i never have any, and it is useful in <br/>\n&gt;some<br/>\n&gt;situations including pvp.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t call it useless, but I would call it not very useful. *shrug* I <br/>\ndefinitely agree with Shada on the resist rates - they further reducing the <br/>\nalready LOW chance that this would ever take up one of my spell slots.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;they are useless).  the song has been compared to harm touch, and i think <br/>\n&gt;it compares<br/>\n&gt;favorably to harmtouch with respect to damage/refresh time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why. With Dirge I can hit multiple targets for 450ish damage <br/>\nonce every 30-40 minutes or so. It is 100% useless on raid-level mobs that <br/>\nrequire lure-level spells (which is a mostly what I see daily). HT is a free <br/>\nability, doesn&#39;t take any mana or spell slots, drops a sizeable nuke on a <br/>\ntarget at lure-level resistance when paired with discipline. I guess in <br/>\nterms of regular xp-ing dirge might seem more useful. Not using it won&#39;t <br/>\nmake you less of a bard though, thx.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have never fought what is now an &quot;uber mob&quot;.  However, according to &gt; <br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt;on this list (and others) they take in the range of 10 minutes to kill.<br/>\n&gt;Which means med times matter.  SO why wouldn&#39;t having a bard in the &gt; <br/>\n&gt;wizard<br/>\n&gt;group be useful?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pre-Velious mobs take anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 or 4 minutes to kill <br/>\ndepending on which mob, how many people are engaging it, and how well they <br/>\nsurvive. Velious mobs can take upwards of 15 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am assuming that resist rates are useless on these mobs...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re talking about dirge, you are correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So, now that we all (except whee) agree it&#39;s worthless to mem, what changes <br/>\n&gt;would need to be made to make it worth memming in place of some other song?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Take it out of the game and replace it with a mem-wipe song. :) So solly <br/>\nPVPers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout what classes are good for raiding:<br/>\nI still feel that I have my place on raids, and I NEVER have any &quot;your class <br/>\nis useless&quot; stigma hanging over my head from my guildmates. This goes for <br/>\nevery member in my guild. You can get through this entire game and kill just <br/>\nabout every mob in the game using just clerics, warriors, rogues, and <br/>\nenchanters. Thankfully, my guild hasn&#39;t devolved to this point like I know <br/>\none prominent guild on my server (Veeshan) has.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with the single-shaman stress syndrome. You only NEED 1 <br/>\nactive, but I&#39;d never want to be in his shoes. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad{Legion}<br/>\n59 Bard (I will get 60 oh yes I will...after this next raid)<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
