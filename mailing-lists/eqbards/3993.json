A lot of dead birdies helped!~ Made it twice<br/>\nactually and some stoopid bandits didn&#39;t help there at all! Stole my level<br/>\n17 they did but I made them taste Sylly&#39;s  Revenge! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways... there I was down in Lake Rathe when I realize - hey I got dual<br/>\nwield now!  And my extra wep and guildmaster is back in Qeynos.  Well, what<br/>\nthe hell, we have run this route a few times and one more wont be the last!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I am:<br/>\n<br/>\nbase str is 82<br/>\nbase weight is 78<br/>\n<br/>\nthis is with a mix of bronze and other stuff including a spiked collar +3str<br/>\n(I need some str earrings - got the str rings and a ruby veil would be nice<br/>\ntoo :-) and with a dragoon dirk and a combine ls.  I have to NOT wear some<br/>\narmor to stay in an unencumbered - unbuffed state - or else my agility takes<br/>\na huge penalty.  if I can get str buffs, I switch to my derv rings for the<br/>\ndexi boost.  and I am constantly begging for dim pockets and constantly<br/>\nforgetting to give them away before camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe combine weighs in at 5 and while it has a decent dmg/dly ratio - I&#39;d<br/>\nlove to have a second magic hitter that is quicker and liter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what should I get?  My piercing skill is prolly higher than my 1hs. So I<br/>\nwas thinking a combine dagger.  Or a whip (kewl dood sound effects &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 17th level<br/>\na.k.a. Robo-Bard<br/>\nSwimming across Lake Rathe <br/>\nomw to get me corpse<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I also got sneak!  how does that work?  makes you kinda invisible?  or<br/>\nchanges attitude of monster? someone said you can play songs and sneak -<br/>\nwhat about run? can you run and sneak?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
