I play them because they are fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I play Everquest a lot, because it is a hell of a lot of fun<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I play a Bard, because I think Bards are one of the most fun classesin<br/>\nthe game. We can heal fast, run fast, root, lull, fear, charm, stun, buff,<br/>\ninvis, find our corpse, sing some good damage, breathe underwater,<br/>\nlevitate, cancel magic, track, and more. We get to wear the coolest armor<br/>\nin the game, and wield some good weapons and handle them pretty well. Being<br/>\na bard is a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. When I play Everquest, I want to have fun. If I am not having fun at any<br/>\ngiven time, I stop playing, or I go to another zone, party, etc.. Duh.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Rubicite armor is probably the coolest armor that any of us have a<br/>\nreasonable chance of wearing. Having it would be really neat, and would<br/>\ndefinitely enhance the fun I have in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Rubicite armor is found in Cazic Thule, on a variety of reasonably rare<br/>\nmobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Cazic Thule is hell on Norrath. It isn&#39;t like each mob with Rucicite is<br/>\ncamped by a single party in a room somewhere (like Najena for instance).<br/>\nNo, most of the armor is camped by multiple parties, who have some sort of<br/>\nsystem for figuring out which GROUP gets the next loot of something that<br/>\nMIGHT have Rubicite. It is the silliest thing I have ever encountered in<br/>\nEQ, and I have seen a lot of silliness.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Getting a reasonable amount of Rubicite would require sitting in Cazic<br/>\nwith a bunch of people who are constantly stressed about looting, and doing<br/>\nthis for a LONG time . . weeks or MONTHS.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Number 8 is not fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Verant&#39;s Biggest Mistake: To acquire the best items in Everquest, you<br/>\nmust often be willing to have no fun. This is insane. This is nuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
