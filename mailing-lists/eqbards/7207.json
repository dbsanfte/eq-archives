I dont mind trying to find out what stuff does, but<br/>\n&gt; i dont even bother anymore cause most of the time its just broken. That imo<br/>\n&gt; takes all of the fun out of it.

Even if it is broken, usually your reward isn&#39;t enough to<br/>\njustify the time and effort.  Some guy did the Grimrot quest,<br/>\nturned in the opal scythe (a 15/48 weapon that procs) and got<br/>\na nonmagical morningstar for a reward.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
