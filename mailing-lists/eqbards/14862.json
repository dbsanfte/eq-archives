So far, all the mobs I&#39;ve seen, unless they<br/>\n&gt; have a weapon or are buffed, swing once every 3.0 seconds.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s far easier to test it on level 1 mobs that can&#39;t double<br/>\n&gt; attack.

It definitely<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t feel like 3.0 seconds between swings.  They are some of the<br/>\n  fastest attackers (maybe perceptively) around since they theorectically<br/>\n  are of level where you will see possible quadruple attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can easily last twice to three times as long in toe to toe against<br/>\n  an ice giant with togors on it.  It would be obvious after chains<br/>\n  wore off (and didn&#39;t effect togors) if my survivability was still<br/>\n  intact.  Snakes don&#39;t offer such challenges, and you then need to<br/>\n  resort to logging and timing.  With larger npcs the dmg output will<br/>\n  be noticably different without parsing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
