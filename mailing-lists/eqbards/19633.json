We went to<br/>\nKaesora the last 3 nights. In 2 hours camping the Church area, I made 1.5<br/>\nbubbles in level 44. We got a total 5 ransacker packs, and Xalgoz himself<br/>\nspawned once, dropping the fang. The library area is awesome for levels<br/>\n35-40 as everything is still blue. The drops are less frequent there but exp<br/>\nis still great.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also a great dungeon for crawling. You can get most mobs as single<br/>\nor double pulls. There are many wanderers, but they are easy to isolate and<br/>\npick off. There are well spaced areas where you can pause to clear the next<br/>\narea. And the spawn clock is enough so that you can clear an area and the<br/>\nnext area before respawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend Kaesora for parties levels 35-45. In the time I&#39;ve spent<br/>\nthere, I&#39;ve only once, seen someone not in my group in the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrae</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
