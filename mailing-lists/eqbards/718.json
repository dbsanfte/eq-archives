My Half Elf Ranger and Wood<br/>\nElf Ranger friends are both constantly encumbered and either skip loot or<br/>\nfight impoverished if we&#39;re not close to a merchant.  Lavastorm is one area<br/>\nthat comes to mind.  I&#39;m almost in full banded, except for some magical<br/>\npieces and still have an advantage, while they can only acquire a few choice<br/>\npieces of banded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest str.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I also disagree that str is the best stat. I pumped 5 into str, and put the<br/>\n&gt;rest in charisma. I almost never fizzle when twisting, and I get incredible<br/>\n&gt;prices on items at the store. I&#39;ve also been able to access vendors most<br/>\n&gt;other of my type can&#39;t - even without killing to adjust factions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have purchased very expensive items for people at such savings that I got<br/>\n&gt;a few plat for myself as a reward.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have also engaged in buying loot from people at a rate they are happy<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and sold it for profit (ogres and trolls come to mind).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There&#39;s no simple answer about stats, it&#39;s just based on what kind of<br/>\n&gt;character you want to play. I would add the Roleplay bit into it... think<br/>\n&gt;about your character and what he/she is like. Take the attributes you think<br/>\n&gt;your character really has.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Sam Zoucha [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:szoucha@...\">szoucha@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, May 13, 1999 1:22 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] starting stats<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Sam Zoucha &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:szoucha@...\">szoucha@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just wanted to add my 2 cents on the stats issue..i have seen many people<br/>\n&gt;say to pump all u can into strength cause u&#39;ll need it for that heavy<br/>\n&gt;armor...this is true..but..i personally only put 5 into str to bring my<br/>\n&gt;half-elf str up to 80...why would i do this ?  simple with 8- i could wear<br/>\n&gt;full chain and have enough str to carry quite a bit of loot without being<br/>\n&gt;encumbered..o what about that heavy plate..not to worry..i for 1 dont plan<br/>\n&gt;on buying regular plate as it is heavy and ridicously expensive..i am<br/>\n&gt;currently level 26 and upgrading slowly to pieces of lizard.ie mantle and<br/>\n&gt;cape..and rubicite.  This armor if u didnt know is much lighter than plate<br/>\n&gt;and just as good(i think, i dont have stats on all pieces)..also got a<br/>\n&gt;thick leather apron from unrest  ac8 weight 1....<br/>\n&gt;2ndly as you get this high there are plenty of magical items to pump up<br/>\n&gt;your strength..both as loot and now from enchanters as they get higher up<br/>\n&gt;in level.<br/>\n&gt;So as you can see dont worry if your not arnold the bard...i found my<br/>\n&gt;pumped dex and agility much more useful as lowere level than i would<br/>\n&gt;strength...:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 02:57 PM 5/14/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Lorrie Hopper&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lhopper@...\">lhopper@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I would suggest pumping up your strength above all the other stats, thus<br/>\n&gt;&gt;enabling you to wear better armor later among other things already<br/>\n&gt;mentioned<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in other posts.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;As far as best race goes, personally I dont think there is one.
