A: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1077342752\">From the Arch-Magi answers page on the official EQ site<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: How do spell fizzles (and missed notes on songs) work?<br/>\nA: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle check. There is always a 5% <br/>\nchance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a <br/>\n5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). <br/>\nWhat modifies a fizzle check are (a) your appropriate skill (Abjuration, <br/>\nEvocation, Brass, Wind, etc.) (b) your primary statistic (Intelligence for <br/>\nMagi, Wisdom for Priests, Dexterity and Charisma for Bards) (c) the <br/>\ndifficulty of the spell and (d) the level of the spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has <br/>\na 20% chance of fizzling. This assumes that (a) your appropriate skill <br/>\n(Evocation, for example) is at its maximum value (b) that you have a minimum <br/>\nof 75 in your appropriate statistic (Intelligence, etc.) and (c) that we did <br/>\nnot set the difficulty of the spell to less then average (some spells we <br/>\nassign a lower difficulty, making them easier to cast - to date, we have not <br/>\nmade any spells with higher difficulty).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your appropriate statistic is greater then 75 (Intelligence, Wisdom, <br/>\netc.), we reduce your fizzle percent by 1% for every X points of your <br/>\nstatistic above 75.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the <br/>\nspell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells at <br/>\nlevel 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had a 60 <br/>\nAlteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the <br/>\nappropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% <br/>\nchance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our <br/>\nWizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a <br/>\nminimum of a 5% chance of fizzling. Thus, three levels (15 skill points) <br/>\nafter our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she will be able to max out her <br/>\nAlteration and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nA high intelligence would help her to max out her ability to cast Bind <br/>\nAffinity without fizzling earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
