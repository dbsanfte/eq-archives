As a result, I don&#39;t have a really good idea on how much<br/>\nPP to offer for the looting rights.  If anyone out there gets a quest<br/>\ncomponent by paying for the looting rights, request you post how much you<br/>\npaid for it.  That will give me and other bards in my situation a good<br/>\nstarting point in our negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
