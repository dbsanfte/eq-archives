Boy was it dangerous!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when sitting down with my group while all the spell chuckers<br/>\nrecovered from their oh so hard zapping, playing a nice tune just in<br/>\ncase we needed to run for the exit, it didn&#39;t take long for the<br/>\nnearest gnoll to suddenly turn and jump on me.  Not the meditating<br/>\nhigh elves oh no, ignore everyone else and straight for little old me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;m asking is ..... were they just offended by the slightly<br/>\ndifferent interpretation I placed on Selo&#39;s, or do I have some sort of<br/>\nbad guy magnet attached to me!  I deliberately avoided my hymn of<br/>\nrestoration because I&#39;d heard they really don&#39;t like you helping<br/>\npeople, but does this hatred run to any kind of song disturbing their<br/>\nclearly very peaceful home?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and if a nice friendly L24 and up bard is hanging out here who<br/>\ndonated a bronze helmet to a rather under-dressed me at the docks in<br/>\nButcherblock a couple of weeks ago, can I just say thank you very<br/>\nmuch, it&#39;s saved my life on a number of occasions :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks everyone, see ya out there!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nSaldara<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard, Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\nMilaniel<br/>\nWood Elf Bard, Mith Marr server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
