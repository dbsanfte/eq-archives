No armor dropped<br/>\n(we got two banshees and they dropped nada) but we took down Maestro (he was<br/>\ntough seemed to have a lot more HP&#39;s than the last time I fought him).  He<br/>\ndropped me an Evensong as well as a lute and the Hand.  The sad thing - a<br/>\nlot of people died (they rez&#39;d me right away) - and the Maestro poofed<br/>\nbefore they could lotto the Hand.

But this<br/>\nweekend i got an invite from a friend that was allready in hate so i figured<br/>\ni&#39;d gate up early....<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday night: was allready empty zone practically (1-2 mobs on track) when i<br/>\ngot there, my friend&#39;s guild was in maestro hall, we proceeded to pull the<br/>\narea, another bard logged in (that was in his guild) she got a helm and<br/>\nmartune rapier.  I have no complaints though, my group was the xp group once<br/>\ni started chanting, made almost a full bub. Got tired afterwards, had to get<br/>\nsome shut eye...<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday morning: join up with another guild up there, 2 other bards in<br/>\nzone, one of which had a full suit, other had bp/arms/gloves.  The one that<br/>\nneeded pieces went LD just before we pull a banshee, never came back, i got<br/>\nboots.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday morning:  join up with yet another guild up there,  kill a couple<br/>\nmobs, 2 cr&#39;s later and 2 banshees, i got myself a bp woot!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all i guess im a lucky bard in hate so far, even won a lotto on a<br/>\nruby crown (money money money).  Only thing i really care to get from the<br/>\nzone now is legs and lute and maybe a diamond if i&#39;m really lucky, and maybe<br/>\na martune rapier would be nice in offhand.  I really cant complain, so far<br/>\nwith this char my hate experience has been quite positive<br/>\n<br/>\nWonder what i&#39;ll get this week 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nlev 48 bard<br/>\nAyonae Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In eqbards@y..., Rebecca Small &lt;rsmall@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Strangely enough, I&#39;ve spent only one full day in Hate.

I started on one, another dove in when the first<br/>\nwas mostly<br/>\n&gt; dead, then it was about dead a third and then a fourth jumped in! I<br/>\nonly saw<br/>\n&gt; the one wisp when I started the fight. I had to run. Later, I<br/>\nstarted on<br/>\n&gt; another one and in about 2 minutes, I had five live wisps chase me<br/>\nto the<br/>\n&gt; zoneline after I killed the first one! Have you ever seen a wisp<br/>\ntrain?
