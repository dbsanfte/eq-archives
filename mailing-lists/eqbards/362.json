I would love to continue pounding my drum and <br/>\npunch my enemy in synchrony with the beat of my tune. However so far, <br/>\nmy delicate hands yield very little damage, unless holding a weapon. <br/>\nI was wondering if any fellow bard has an excellent hand to hand <br/>\nskill. Is it worth practicing? What is the most damage that can be <br/>\ninflicted with ones bare bard hands?<br/>\nVisha of Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
