When the necro left, it took up a <br/>\n&gt;lot longer to kill the lord and a wizzie spawned at <br/>\n&gt;the end of our battle and started to Ice Comet us... <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\nWow it took over 10 minutes to kill the lord? <br/>\nSomething&#39;s very not normal sounding here.  I&#39;d guess<br/>\nthe 3 spawns weren&#39;t staggered evenly or something<br/>\nelse screwy happened...oh well. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In addition, we could not re-break the spawn once we <br/>\n&gt;complete corpse recovery and the lord and his<br/>\n&gt;guards had respawned.  With the necro we broke the <br/>\n&gt;room by simply waltzing in, charming, mezzing and <br/>\n&gt;then we slapped the lord around like he was a<br/>\n&gt;wimpy dervish cutthroat or something... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes no surprise here, necro adds charm or pet and mes<br/>\nin addition to great damage...necros are great at the<br/>\nbreakin. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The necro was infinately more productive then the <br/>\n&gt;wizard in this group camping the Lord/Hand/Magi... <br/>\n&gt;and yes, I will attest that a Necro&#39;s ability to <br/>\n&gt;effect undead and us being in lower guk may have had <br/>\n&gt;a lot to do with it...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh I never meant to imply that the wizard was more<br/>\nproductive than the necro...remember i&#39;m the guy who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t ever want his group nuking as its too<br/>\ninefficient for my tastes.  I&#39;m just surprised that<br/>\nthere was that big of a difference in holding the<br/>\nspawn.  IIRC the smallest/weakest group i&#39;ve done lord<br/>\nwith was: 50 war, 49 cleric, 48 druid, 50 rogue, 42<br/>\nshaman?  Something like that...so I would have thought<br/>\nyou could hold it just fine with either wiz or necro.<br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
