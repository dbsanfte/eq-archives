If so, here is <br/>\nthe information on the virus:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vil.mcafee.com/dispVirus.asp?virus_k=10003\">http://vil.mcafee.com/dispVirus.asp?virus_k=10003</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I say &quot;may&quot; because it&#39;s possible that the infected file came from the <br/>\npatch center.  In either case, Abashi has stated that if you didn&#39;t open <br/>\nthe doc file, you are fine.  If you did, you are SOL - Verant is keeping <br/>\nmum about a solution.  Of course, you should always have a virus scanner <br/>\nrunning (says the guy without one) and never open anything from someone you <br/>\ndon&#39;t know and/or trust (yadda yadda).  Thanks for shooting THAT one in the <br/>\nfoot, Verant :P.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you RoK&#39;ers - I&#39;m not able to upgrade, so I won&#39;t be seeing <br/>\nyou there.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE FREE!
