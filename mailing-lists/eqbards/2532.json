First, you&#39;ll have to<br/>\nbe in yours mid-20s. Then you&#39;ll have to travel to cazic-thule, near the<br/>\nogre home city. Once you eneter cazic you&#39;ll need to find a group and<br/>\nhunt down the creatures that spawn with the armor, which is easier said<br/>\nthan do. The tae ew templar in the throne room has the leg greaves, a<br/>\ngolem(forget which one) has the hands, the avatar(which also holds the<br/>\ndemon claw) has the breastplate, and I forget who has the helm and the<br/>\narms. Of course, expect much camping of the mobs that have rubicite, as<br/>\nthe rubicite is very valuable and they usually carry something else that<br/>\nis very valuable(like the demon claws for instance). On the other hand,<br/>\nmost high level(above 30 or so) people have rubicite now probably,<br/>\nbecause, as I hunt in cazic, I tend to see 90% of the people in cazic<br/>\nabove 27 or so using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalonus DuPrey<br/>\nTraveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Karen wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would like information on Rubicite Armor, where does each piece come<br/>\n&gt; from and how difficult are they to get?
