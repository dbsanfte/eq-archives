Words from inside the<br/>\nsoftware and its design, like &quot;mob&quot; have a way of slipping into the game.<br/>\nBet you haven&#39;t guessed that bothers me.  :-)}<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least I have a good reason here.  Programmers jargon is handy for<br/>\nprogrammers but it leads to less understanding for those who are not.<br/>\nVerant has a bad habit of using such jargon, even in system warnings, with<br/>\nno explanation whatsoever of what it means.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s unreasonable and inconsiderate to invent words or give old words new<br/>\nmeaning then expect others to know what they mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the software industry for 30 years.  The<br/>\nonly real way to stem the tide of ugly jargon is to push back and refuse to<br/>\nuse it yourself, both of which I try to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
