Why don&#39;t you join them?  I had a great time the other night <br/>\ncamping the Savant room in Lower Guk with a bunch of mid-forties.  If I hadn&#39;t <br/>\nrushed off to loot a Basalt Carapace and forgotten to get myself re-invised to <br/>\nundead after looting (thus creating an amusingly huge train of froggies and <br/>\nskeletons), I would have made it through six hours without dying once, and I <br/>\ngot two bubbles net, anyway.  (I wouldn&#39;t have died at all if the <br/>\nbleepity-bleep wizard had kept enough mana for an evac.  He managed to med up  <br/>\njust in time to see me croak.)  (Well, I take it back - I died 30 seconds into <br/>\nour very first fight.  The Cleric, who is really quite good, told me that he <br/>\nhad forgotten just how fast Bards can dump Hit Points if four things are <br/>\nwhacking them.  hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
