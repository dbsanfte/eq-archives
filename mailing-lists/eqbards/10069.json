So i got 2 level 30 rangers to help me and we went to<br/>\nNK. First thing: Griffennes are rare. in 3 hours of hunting we only<br/>\nfound 3. It was every thing the 3 of us could do to kill the griffenne.<br/>\nIt nearly killed all 3 of us each time. 3 kills: no charm.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCame back the next day without the rangers, with a 25th druid, i was<br/>\n29th then. the Griffennes that conned blue to me were a piece of cake. I<br/>\ncould chain them while the druid DOT&#39;d them, 2 kills, one charm. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tWent to unrest to get bracelet, walked in there is a corpse on floor...<br/>\nhrmm a Greater dark boned skel... yep, it has the bracelet on it. well,<br/>\nthat was easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGot my bracer and went back to NK, killed 2 griffennes with a shaman<br/>\n(they drop an item for the shaman quest also), we got 2 feathers for<br/>\nhim, no charm for me. Then someone yelled &quot;free charm at stone bridge&quot;.<br/>\nI ran and i got it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBack to unrest for bracelet, luckily we were having a guild event and<br/>\nwe took over the pit. Got my bracelet from my own kill in about 15<br/>\nminutes. In 2 more hours of event, saw about 3 more bracelets, shouted<br/>\nfor bards to come get, noone ever did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo if you want to do the quests yourself... i&#39;d say you need to be 28+<br/>\nor have a great group helping you. I wanted to do the quests myself, but<br/>\ncould not pass up free items like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfagson<br/>\n30th Bard Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
