I think GZ needs more specifics than this<br/>\nletter will include.  The goal is to raise the general level of awareness of our<br/>\nclass to the team in general.  We&#39;ve all noticed that warriors, rogues, and<br/>\nrangers get alot of tinkering.  My guess...large player base, large amount of<br/>\nfeedback (or in the rogue&#39;s case, very broken and embarrassing).  So, since<br/>\nwe&#39;re such a small group I&#39;m hoping to do a little PR with the big guy and have<br/>\nhim and his team think on us a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone out there have a list of the songs that still aren&#39;t implemented?
