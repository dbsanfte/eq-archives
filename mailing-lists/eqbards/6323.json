I created my bard as pretty much<br/>\na rogueish lad.  I tend to be drunk a LOT (yes, much<br/>\nto the dismay of my friends, even in battle) and tease<br/>\nEVERYBODY (my clan is SOOO sick of Limericks).  In<br/>\nkeeping with this, I have stuck to peircing weapons<br/>\nsince level 2 (where I found a nifty rusty spear).  I<br/>\nam fairly well armed now, with a Dragoon Dirk and a<br/>\nCombine Rapier (what I wouldn&#39;t give for an Ashenwood<br/>\nSpear) and so far I LOVE my choice of weapons (Since I<br/>\nNEVER seem to get into a group with more than one<br/>\ntank...and usually that is me..I have fit into the<br/>\nrole of battle bard more than I&#39;d care to think<br/>\nabout).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy big question.  Am I making a mistake that will bite<br/>\nme at later levels? (Shada....help me out here)  Every<br/>\nweapon I&#39;ve heard about that is decent damage for<br/>\nbards at high levels is 1H Slash.  Did I, for<br/>\nroleplaying purposes, limit my usefulness at later<br/>\nlevels?  I really like the bard I created, as he is<br/>\nSOOO different from the Cleric I had, and Im managing<br/>\nto turn my guild into a bunch of drunks with me..hehe,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t want to find out at level 3x that I should<br/>\nhave chosen to raise my 1h slash, as to do any decent<br/>\ndamage and be worth my wieght, I need to wield a<br/>\n1hSlash weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWork with me here folks, Im at work and sober (in game<br/>\nand IRL)<br/>\n<br/>\nWindolas Stormsong (Still at 20th Song, MM)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
