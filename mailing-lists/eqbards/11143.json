I think there might be something<br/>\nscrewy in the code where hand to hand only raises if you are totally<br/>\nwithout anything in your grasp - or maybe it&#39;s just been me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur hand to hand caps pretty low anyway, so don&#39;t ever think you&#39;re gonna<br/>\ndo much more than scratch a mob with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiercing and 1h slash pretty much cover most weapons a bard is likely - or<br/>\nreally wants to use. Again, debate on this depending if you plan on playing<br/>\na support (singing/playing bard) or a battle bard in there trying to swing<br/>\nwith the tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is one tip tho - you can tank in a pinch, but after awhile - you&#39;ll<br/>\nsoon come to realize bards are NOT tanks, no matter how much some may wish<br/>\nthey were.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:35 PM 12/3/99 -0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all, I&#39;m making a bard as a secondary character to my cleric.  Just<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;few basic questions, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re hearing for the 4356th time on the<br/>\n&gt;list.  Sorry for the clutter... (But to be honest all the online guides<br/>\n&gt;I found were useless)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Stats, stats, stats...  To str or not to str... Tis better to dex<br/>\n&gt;than...<br/>\n&gt;In other words, what are your thoughts on starting stats?  I was<br/>\n&gt;thinking of making a half elf, since I want the better vision, and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;played a wood elf before...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What skill is used when you kabong somebody with your lute?  Hand to<br/>\n&gt;hand?  1HB?  I figured it would be worth a practice for all those times<br/>\n&gt;I attack with an instrument...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any other general starting advice?  I won&#39;t be twinking myself with my<br/>\n&gt;cleric.  (who was started on a new server for me (veeshan) to prevent<br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;first character from twinking him) (not a judgment on twinkers, I just<br/>\n&gt;think it detracts from the fun, to each their own)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
