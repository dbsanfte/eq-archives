After the last late night patch, I discovered the recently<br/>\n&gt; discussed stacking of magic resist songs no longer works. <br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s up with<br/>\n&gt; that? Was this too powerful a benefit? Meanwhile, the <br/>\n&gt; accellerando still<br/>\n&gt; cancels sow when it wears off, as does levitate and of course the L30<br/>\n&gt; song still doesnt work. Wish they would take a break from nerfing and<br/>\n&gt; fix some bugs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also discovered with great joy that our music skills are <br/>\n&gt; capped at 200<br/>\n&gt; along with our combat skills. Guess I can&#39;t complain about <br/>\n&gt; that too much<br/>\n&gt; as even a warrior&#39;s combat skills cap at 200, and you&#39;d think the<br/>\n&gt; warrior would be better at them than other fighters. But if that&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; case, why are the magic users still shooting up over 200 in their<br/>\n&gt; casting skills?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A very depressed L41 bard. :(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
