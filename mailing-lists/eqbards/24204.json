I made the arrogant mistake of never trying it, since for the<br/>\nlast five or so levels, I&#39;ve found it next to impossible to aggro the primary target, very easy to ditch<br/>\nit if I do, and I assumed it would not be worth the bother for secondaries.  I suppose if it lowers you<br/>\nfar enough on the list, other factors (like proximity) take over, so maybe it works even if nobody else<br/>\nhas aggroed a MOB directly.  Even if true, I have other things I&#39;d rather twist, but I may try it if I do<br/>\nbigger stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the other four, I&#39;ve actually memmed them.  I didn&#39;t say they were worth much, but I&#39;ve used all<br/>\nfour of them:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Level 14 - Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto, unless you are doing the lambent<br/>\n&gt; quests and need a rune identified.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>... and the Nostrolo Tambourine and VP key quests.  There&#39;s a few other things that people like to<br/>\nidentify as well.  I&#39;m not sure that they NEED to, but I get asked occasionally.  In some ways, this is<br/>\nreally artificial.  They put the identical-appearing components in the game in order to make the song (and<br/>\nthe spell) have a purpose, which is kind of ass-backwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Level 21 - Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion, unless you are PvP i guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It has sometimes helped me get people unstuck from places.  It doesn&#39;t work great for that, but it<br/>\nsometimes does the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Level 57 - Cassindra&#39;s Insipid Ditty, same boat as Denon&#39;s Dissension<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this works this way, but my theory is that if you knock a MOBs WIS and INT down right off<br/>\nthe bat (before they cast) that shrinks their mana by a proportional amount.  If they work like PCs, they<br/>\ndon&#39;t regain the mana even when the WIS and INT is restored when the song wears off.  The mana drain<br/>\ncomponent is so small that I don&#39;t bother with it for that, but if I have an open song slot, I will fire<br/>\nit as a first salvo against casting MOBs.  Of course, I have no way to test whether or not it does any<br/>\ngood...  :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Level 59 - Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord, this is what i am working for?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, now that&#39;s a stupid song.  Especially as a reward for level 59.  I didn&#39;t list it because I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave it to not mem yet.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 53 - Song of Dawn:  Reducing aggro on secondary MOBs doesn&#39;t help when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re the only one on the list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, i am no expert on how aggro works, but when i have a secondary mob on<br/>\n&gt; me that i believe no one else has aggro&#39;d, Song of Dawn has worked to get it<br/>\n&gt; off me and on someone else.  maybe someone else did have aggro and i was not<br/>\n&gt; aware, but not that i could tell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shada </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
