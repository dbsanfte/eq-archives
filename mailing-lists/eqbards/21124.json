It drops <br/>\nin Karnor&#39;s Castle and is Bard only.  It is LORE unfortunately so you can&#39;t <br/>\ndual-weild two of them, but it can be weilded in either hand.   I&#39;m <br/>\ncurrently using one of these in my primary hand and a Yak in my off hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think the Staff of Writhing is primary hand only.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess you&#39;re a battle bard too... hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 42 Missed Notes<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;Well its time for me to call upon the experinced souls here to get some <br/>\n&gt;advice<br/>\n&gt;regarding weapons. I have the following weapons at my disposal:<br/>\n&gt;- Ebon Razor (Primary only) Damage 9, Delay 25, +4 fire, cold & magic prot. <br/>\n&gt;  Wt.<br/>\n&gt;3.5.<br/>\n&gt;- Short Sword of the Ykesha:  Damage 8, Delay 24, Weight 4.5.  Effect of <br/>\n&gt;Ykesha<br/>\n&gt;(75 point direct damage spell)<br/>\n&gt;- Staff of Writhing 9/33 Diret proc Damage 48<br/>\n&gt;- Bladed thullian claws (Primary only). 5/19<br/>\n&gt;- Silvery War Axe  6/22<br/>\n&gt;Currently Im wielding the Ebon Razor and the yak and I think my damage is <br/>\n&gt;better<br/>\n&gt;than with the yak in primary and Silvery in off hand. But I have my doubts. <br/>\n&gt;Im<br/>\n&gt;not satisfied with the yak being placed in my offhand. Do any of you have<br/>\n&gt;suggestions for a better weapon setup?<br/>\n&gt;I have been thinking of getting a second yak, but I find the proc is <br/>\n&gt;resisted<br/>\n&gt;quite a lot by kunark mobs atleast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Regards<br/>\n&gt;Musiker(x) Silverdrum, bard of the 38th song, bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
