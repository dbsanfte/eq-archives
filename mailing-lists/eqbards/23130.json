If you fear mobs<br/>\nthere, they run up into the corner and run back and forth mostly up in the<br/>\ncorner. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a gm watch me for about 15 minutes up there one evening.  I asked him<br/>\nif he considered it an exploit, and he said &quot;Nope, Great tactics!&quot;  Bear in<br/>\nmind that the mob was never just running into a wall, it was always in<br/>\nmotion, and as long as fear wasnt resisted it stayed on this little path<br/>\nwhere it ran back and forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
