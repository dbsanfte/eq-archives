(I know it REALLY helped me when I was <br/>\n&gt; trying to get my bracers.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Along the Northern wall of NK, there is a hill with a column. <br/>\n&gt; This is near the named treant, and in the area where the <br/>\n&gt; werewolf hunters roam. Anyway, a griffenne or a griffawn will <br/>\n&gt; spawn there once every 8 minutes, and I camped the area no <br/>\n&gt; more than an hour and a half for each bracelet. Anyway, if <br/>\n&gt; you are on Xegony and need the /loc give me a yell in game (I <br/>\n&gt; have it written down at home.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Safe hunting...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gaelthorne </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
