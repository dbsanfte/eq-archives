It&#39;s bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Us bards have to press buttons every 5 secs to change songs and now we&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;have to continue to be chained to our desks during downtime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Auto-logoff would be really bad, btw. Have you ever been in a room that has<br/>\n&gt;a motion sensor light? If you sit at your desk and you&#39;re reading, you have<br/>\n&gt;to wave your hand in the air every 15 min or end up in the dark.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Auto-logoff is the same thing. You may be sitting reading stuff on your<br/>\n&gt;screen, not necessarily pushing any buttons for 10 mins, but get booted off<br/>\n&gt;just because the server thinks you&#39;re inactive. You&#39;d have to make sure you<br/>\n&gt;push a button every 10 mins or be booted. After you&#39;re booted, you&#39;d lose<br/>\n&gt;all of your no-rent items as well as any illusions you had up. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think Verant would even implement such a bad thing. Uhh, maybe not. Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;post the auto-logoff thing on the web Kit.
