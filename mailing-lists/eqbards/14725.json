I was standing kinda near the assasain ladder saw this dumb caster<br/>\ncome running across the bridge with a GIBS train in tow. Hehe, training into<br/>\nthe tower instead of out of it?  Like I said she was dumb.  So, I figured<br/>\nwell, what the heck, and stepped in to stop that train.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chained a GIBS, yelled for my group, hit auto-attack and started to<br/>\nscreetch. All but one GIBS fled back to their cave.  My group arrived and we<br/>\nhacked down the gibs. Then the other 4 GIBS came back and attacked us.<br/>\nChain, fear, assist on me!  Dont chase them!!! Rinse, repeat.  We nailed all<br/>\nof the GIBS - hehe. And were lucky that the caster frogs to the side of the<br/>\nbridge did not spawn during our fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry that today and someone will prolly yell at you that they were &quot;pulling&quot;<br/>\nthose GIBS to the Lord room for something to kill between spawns &lt;g&gt; and<br/>\naccuse you of KS&#39;ing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we were first exploring lower guk, back when there was 8-10 ppl in<br/>\n&gt; the zone, I used lullaby at least once on an over pull in the undead<br/>\n&gt; tower. It worked and we all lived.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Another time we had an over pull (again in the undead tower) and I fired<br/>\n&gt; up screech to try to get 4 mobs off our druid so he could get off an<br/>\n&gt; evac. The train that came back 15 sec later with the feared frogs was<br/>\n&gt; the scariest I&#39;d seen there. We got all the gargoyles and every other<br/>\n&gt; frog in the tower too. Heh. Didn&#39;t last too long. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
