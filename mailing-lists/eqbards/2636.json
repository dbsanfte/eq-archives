I do not see the used of lvl 20 song at all and I<br/>\nwas hoping that it does what the song list say it does which is -AC and slow<br/>\ndown the attack rate.  I do not see that when I used it against a blue.  It<br/>\nsaid that it is binding and all.  could anyone tell me if they have ever had<br/>\nany success with this song?  Also I am very close to lvl 21 and I was<br/>\nwondering if I should buy it since I am very short on PP.  The lvl 21 song<br/>\nis supposed to be very similar to lvl 20 right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThnx for the help,<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Samiam Syren Wind<br/>\nChampions of Norrath, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
