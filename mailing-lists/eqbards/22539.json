I thought the animated version was ok, but certainly not of that<br/>\ncaliber.  Gandalf is being played by Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto from X-Men),<br/>\nLiv Tyler plays Arwen, Sean Bean (Sharpe of the Sharpe&#39;s series) plays<br/>\nBoromir, Elijah Wood plays Frodo, Samwise is played by the Sean Astin<br/>\n(Rudy), Saruman is played by Christopher Lee, Bilbo by Ian Holm, Gimli by<br/>\nJohn Rys-Davies, Galadriel by Cate Blanchett, Wormtongue by Brad Dourif.<br/>\nThe cast alone makes this an immense undertaking.  Throw in the fact that it<br/>\nwill be three movies, one for each book in the trilogy and I think it will<br/>\nbe very exciting.  more info available at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tolkienonline.com/\">http://www.tolkienonline.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Legba Work [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, November 17, 2000 10:15 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dark Age of Camelot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter, it would be like so one remaking the white album, (or<br/>\nredoing Psycho, say...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI found the animated movie to be nearly perfect (I really love it that<br/>\nmuch).
