I was playing when I first got lullaby at 15th and<br/>\npracticing to see its effects on low level critters.  I was playing Lullaby<br/>\nin the are in front of Qeynos and went upstairs to get a drink.  The<br/>\ndoorbell rang and after talking to my neighbor for 15 minutes I forgot what<br/>\nI was doing.  I walked in to the bedroom and turned on the tv to watch<br/>\nsci-fi channel.  As I got ready for bed 4 hours later I suddenly realized I<br/>\nhad never camped.  I ran downstairs to find myself still playing lullaby<br/>\nwith about 6 or 7 newbies around me killing off the many beetles etc I had<br/>\ngathered.  Some of the beetles had been there so long they would not attack<br/>\nanyone and when awakened just turned on me for a snap.  I was down about a<br/>\nbubble, but still playing away.  One of the newbies, I think his name was<br/>\nJaloshy or some such said he had been sitting there for over 2 hours waiting<br/>\nfor things to walk in and fall asleep.  His delay on his rusty 2 handed<br/>\nsword was so great they would often nod for a while in between blows so it<br/>\nhelped him quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
