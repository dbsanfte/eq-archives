If you mean exploit as in &quot;you kill <br/>\nthem, they have no chance of killing you&quot;, then I&#39;d have to say, &quot;Sorta&quot;. <br/>\nThe melee mobs have no chance to kill you, period. The casters can (and <br/>\nhave) kill you, but you do get some control over it. It&#39;s possible to DOT <br/>\nthem, run away from the jail and then come back and DOT them. However, it&#39;s <br/>\nalso possible that the wandering Caitliff or PH will come in and kill you <br/>\nwhile you&#39;re trying this. Argh, I hate contemplating these things. I just <br/>\nlike to play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve camped in the MM jail on numerous occasions but always before I got the<br/>\n&gt;chant songs.  Also was always in a group so we just pulled them out of the<br/>\n&gt;cells.  I assume what you were doing was opening the doors, targetting one<br/>\n&gt;of the mobs, closing the doors, and then chanting until the mob died.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would open the doors, and start chanting. I let the door shut itself. The <br/>\ncasters can still cast on you if you are in their LOS and within range.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Curious what happens when the first chant hits.  If it is a caster mob, does<br/>\n&gt;it cast through the door?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Melee mobs?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They are stuck in the cell and die. I admit, that&#39;s not entirely fair for <br/>\nthe mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What about the mobs in the other<br/>\n&gt;cells that you didn&#39;t target?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If they are casters they blast the holy heck out of you, but only if you <br/>\nare in their Line of Sight and within range.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t call this a total exploit. I mean, realistically, we can chant <br/>\nthings to death with selo&#39;s in the open plains and have practically no <br/>\nchance of dying. Heck, I charm kite all the time and have only had a couple <br/>\nof deaths the entire time (1 time because I went linkdead). I think that <br/>\nthis is pretty much the same thing. We can stay out of range and chant them <br/>\nto death. The melee mobs, I would say that this is an exploit. But the <br/>\ncaster mobs I would say is more dangerous than just kiting out in the open.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
