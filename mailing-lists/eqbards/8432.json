Should I <br/>\nstick with the Serpentine or go with a Lambent (AC9, +1 CHA, +4 STR)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso debating on going with Lambent Greaves (AC13, +1 CHA, +5 AGI) or <br/>\nsticking with Mithril (AC10, +7 STR, +5 vs Magic). Nice AC on the Lambent, <br/>\nbut I like the stat and MR buff on mithril.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently stats are: STR 131, DEX 129 (or close to it), AGI 144, CHA 104.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have stats on the other Lambent pieces?<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 48th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
