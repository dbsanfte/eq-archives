Ever since obtaining dual weild I have used two dwarven axes and <br/>\nlet me tell you I&#39;m a friggin cuisinart.  I regularly group with a Ranger <br/>\nwho dual weilds a whip and a combine LS.  I ALWAYS end up tanking when I <br/>\nplay anthem (this is with the ranger casting spells as well).  The ranger <br/>\ncan&#39;t taunt anything off me for more than a couple of rounds.  I recently <br/>\nobtained a Pugius dagger (very nice!) and have been unable to sell my spare <br/>\ndwarven axe.  Most people prefer to stick with the heavy...slow mino axe.  I <br/>\ntry and tell them the dwarven axe is lighter and faster...but they hear its <br/>\ndam is 6 and usually turn their noses up at it.  If only they knew...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you see me on the Rathe and want an axe...give me a tell and I&#39;ll give <br/>\nyou a deal :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRuldaas<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> (scott brisko)<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] How to know if Anthem is really working<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 20 Jul 1999 09:39:13 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> (scott brisko)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sure I have read everlore, eqvault, harpers, etc. but as much as I had read<br/>\n&gt;what the effects of Anthem de Arms was, I was never able to guage if the<br/>\n&gt;weapons speed increase was really working. Part of the problem was that I<br/>\n&gt;use a Mino axe, (very heavy, long delay) and most of the people that I <br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt;with are also using mino axes, or equally heavy/slow weapons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night I grouped with a rogue double wielding daggers. I have never <br/>\n&gt;seen<br/>\n&gt;someone hit so hit a mob so many times in my life.
