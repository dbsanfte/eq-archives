My original post was technically correct but I just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor skills that you can obtain at level 1, i.e weapon and trade skills, when<br/>\nyou put a practice point into it you get a starting skill level of 1.  This<br/>\nexplains why my Sense Heading skill started at 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor skills that you obtain at a certain level, when you expend a practice<br/>\npoint you get a starting level in that skill equal to your character&#39;s<br/>\ncurrent level.  This explains why my String skill started at 8.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: Your characters INT and/or WIS score has no impact on how many<br/>\nskill points you get when you expend a practice point.  If I want to get my<br/>\nbrewing skill up to 10 (currently zero), I will have to expend 10 practice<br/>\npoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to those who responded.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tCMai [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, May 05, 1999 3:49 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Off-topic: Expending practice points<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The skill that you buy is equal to the lvl that you can buy it.

That indicates that expending the initial practice<br/>\n&gt; point to get the String skill gave me a skill level of 8.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, when I first started my character I expended one<br/>\n&gt; practice<br/>\n&gt; point in Sense Heading.  The next time I went up a level in Sense Heading,<br/>\n&gt; my skill level was only 2.  That indicated one practice point spent and<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; skill level gained.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, does expending a practice point give you a random amount of skill<br/>\n&gt; levels<br/>\n&gt; based on your INT and/or WIS score or does it only give you one skill<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; per practice point?  If the second case is true, how do you account for me<br/>\n&gt; getting 8 skill points in String while only expending 1 practice point?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reason for asking:  I am about to embark on a secondary career as the<br/>\n&gt; Kelethin brewmaster for E&#39;ci.  I haven&#39;t expended any practice points in<br/>\n&gt; brewing yet.  I want to get my skill up to 10 before I start the learning<br/>\n&gt; process.  Just need to know if I only need to put a couple of practice<br/>\n&gt; points in it or will I need to expend 10 practice points.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Galtin  <br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Join the Star Wars craze!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Set up your Star Wars list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Star Wars fans are using ONElist to share the fun.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
