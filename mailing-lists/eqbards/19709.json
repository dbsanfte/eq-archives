Here&#39;s<br/>\nthe way I normally find one.  I go to an area where there are likely people<br/>\nmy level.  Then I look around using /who to find people around my level<br/>\n(from approximately 2-3 levels below --&gt; 2-3 levels above mine.)  Then I<br/>\nwander around to the various areas within the zone and observe the existing<br/>\ngroups.  I&#39;ll ask to be invited into a group if they seem to need a bard.<br/>\nIf I can&#39;t find a group that way, I /tell people who aren&#39;t yet grouped to<br/>\ninvite them to *my* group. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n    I try tanks first. If they don&#39;t have a healer, they are usually very<br/>\nhappy to group with me.  Then I&#39;ll invite casters to round out the group.  I<br/>\ntry to take groups to places that aren&#39;t normally explored (e.g. find people<br/>\nin Oasis then once grouped suggest going to Upper Guk, find people in East<br/>\nCommons and suggest Najena, etc.)  Be sure to discuss where you will be<br/>\ngoing AFTER they are grouped or many people will shy away. ;P<br/>\n<br/>\n    I sometimes end up fighting in the same zone but quite often people are<br/>\ninterested in a little adventure.  It&#39;s great to be a bard and get people<br/>\nquickly to unusual places and it creates memorable grouping experiences.  I<br/>\ntry to pick locations where the group can get started on easy creatures and<br/>\nget a feel for things before taking on tougher fights and risking death.<br/>\nDying always sucks and you really don&#39;t want to create that kind of grouping<br/>\nexperience. ;P<br/>\n<br/>\n    Quite often at the lower levels people won&#39;t necessarily know how a bard<br/>\ncan help.  Show them your song combos before battle if possible so they get<br/>\nan idea.  For example, when I explain my strategy for taking down casters by<br/>\nresist buffing, I&#39;ll get out my drums and play my resist songs then ask<br/>\npeople to let me know their stats.  It shows them how much I can buff and<br/>\ngives me a good idea of how much damage they are likely to resist.  People<br/>\nwith resists significantly under 100 won&#39;t resist as much but I&#39;ve had<br/>\npeople who were buffed to near 100 MR almost entirely resist 15 blasts in a<br/>\nrow (regularly) from con even ice goblin wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some of the fun places I have grouped and hunted from around level<br/>\n15:<br/>\n-    Upper Guk (clear scryer room from the antechamber)<br/>\n-    Permafrost (clear the way to the flag room)<br/>\n-    Befallen (lower level)<br/>\n-    Crushbone (castle and the tower)<br/>\n-    Blackburrow (Commander rooms)<br/>\n-    Oasis of Marr (Orc highway or Crocs solo)<br/>\n-    South Ro Desert (derv camps, dry bones, ghouls)<br/>\n-    West Commons (derv camp, ghouls outside Befallen)<br/>\n-    Lesser Faydark (Orc Chief camp)<br/>\n-    East Karanas (Gnoll reavers, Gorge hounds, beetles)<br/>\n-    Lake Rathetear (Gnoll camp and some aviak spawns)<br/>\n-    South Karanas (Aviak Village and elephants)<br/>\n-    Gorge of King Xorbe (Muddites and Gorge Minotaurs)<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m sure there are many more fun areas that I haven&#39;t found yet since I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t even begun to explore Kunark.  Some non-kunark zones that I haven&#39;t<br/>\nexplored enough to list include Kerra Isle(haven&#39;t been there since it was<br/>\nupgraded), the Hole, Lost Temple of Cazic Thule(too hard for 15), Lavastorm<br/>\n(fire elementals, fire drakes, rock dervishes?), Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron (Aqua<br/>\nGoblin Mariners?), Estate of Unrest (Death beetles and other yard trash?),<br/>\nMistmoore Castle (group of 17+ to take the familiars?), Steamfont (Minotaur<br/>\nslavers?), etc. I hope that answers your questions about grouping and where<br/>\nto hunt!  Explore around and there are lots of interesting things to find.<br/>\n<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the idea behind my guild (Imperturbable Fellowship) is to learn the<br/>\nvarious classes (capabilities and limitations) and grouping strategies that<br/>\npromote teamwork, strong communication and lots of fun.  I&#39;m always looking<br/>\nto learn new things so if anyone has suggestions for grouping, please let me<br/>\nknow. Thanks! And sorry for another long post :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAanluil &lt;Imperturbable Fellowship&gt;<br/>\n20th level Wood elf Bard<br/>\nErollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
