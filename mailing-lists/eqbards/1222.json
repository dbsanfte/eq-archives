I went to Paw at level 19 to practice it.  I<br/>\nfigured it would be safe.  At one point we had about 8 shamans and a couple<br/>\nguards and captains all pissed at myself a cleric and a warrior.  It was very<br/>\ndifficult to kill any of them because the shamans kept healing each other.<br/>\nEventually we had chase them down one by one into a corner.  So, if you go to<br/>\nPaw or some other low level dungeon to practice your brass skill, be warned&lt;g&gt;!<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, there is another way to do it.  If you can find a remote enough<br/>\nlocation where no npc&#39;s will wander by, you can play the song if there is a<br/>\nplayer character who is not in your party within range.  Pretty neat animations<br/>\ngo along with playing the horn.<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Ok, after attempting to make money in the resale of Mino Axes, I have a nice<br/>\n&gt; collection of Mino Horns.  Are these Wind or Brass instruments?  Also I<br/>\n&gt; noticed we get the Brass Skill at 12, but there are no level 12 brass<br/>\n&gt; songs... or am I missing something?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
