He says the power of magic<br/>\njewelery comes from the metal used, which has to be enchanted before you<br/>\nadd the stone.  Silver makes the least powerful, then electrum, gold, and<br/>\nplatinum.  Those four metals represent increasing expense and increasing<br/>\ndifficulty of enchantment, in terms of the level of enchant spell used.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the type of enchanted metal determines the power level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe type of stone determines what&#39;s affected: saves against some hazard or<br/>\na personal characteristic such as strength or wisdom.  Stones have widely<br/>\ndifferent monetary values.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe combination of which metal and which stone determines whether you get<br/>\nearring, bracelet, veil or whatever.  The jeweler can&#39;t choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nJewelers generally price what they make based on what it costs for<br/>\nmaterials, and how badly people want the particular enhancement.  Most<br/>\ntradespeople seem to go for a price about double the cost of materials, to<br/>\ncover their time and the failures that are especially painful with<br/>\nexpensive items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are some types of jewelery that jewelers can&#39;t make, such as<br/>\nagility earrings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that&#39;s what my friend Dweomerforge the enchanter and jeweler tells me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
