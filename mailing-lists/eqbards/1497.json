It&#39;s risky,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I&#39;ve found that to be a better way to save everyone than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; try to make sure they&#39;re all under the effect of Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as they try to run away.

Sometimes you get unlucky and get<br/>\nhit by a double attack.  But usually, that&#39;s enough to keep<br/>\nthe SG busy for 2, sometimes 3 or 4 rounds killing the first<br/>\nperson.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I say, &#39;if you say for the first round of battle, chances are you<br/>\n&gt; will die&#39;.

When I see one approaching from the<br/>\ndistance, I switch to a drum and start Accelerando.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
