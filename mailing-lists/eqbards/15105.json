Then they&#39;d probably fill in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;missing songs with find true east, find true west and find true south.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Note that the spell they replaced with True North, Sense Magic, is a<br/>\n&gt;lvl 1, MAYBE lvl 4/5 spell. It did NOTHING before. Now, if you are<br/>\n&gt;young, it will be a useful spell. Sure, you don&#39;t want it if you are<br/>\n&gt;now lvl 49 (except to train that skill perhaps) But how many<br/>\n&gt;people still use Flame Lick at lvl 49 either?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think Verant really did improve Sense Magic, for the levels that<br/>\n&gt;spell is put in at. I work to max Sense Heading first thing when I<br/>\n&gt;create a new character. 1) it takes forever. Only in lvl 8, when<br/>\n&gt;I had to travel across the continent and used SEnse Heading every<br/>\n&gt;time it came up, did my bard FINALLY max Sense Heading. And even<br/>\n&gt;maxxed, its not very consistent yet. At levels 1-4, your MAX<br/>\n&gt;Sense heading, after all, is 10-25... And sometimes it can be useful to<br/>\n&gt;know. Just because you stay in your newbie area at that time does not mean<br/>\n&gt;that everyone is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Meara, level 14 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\n&gt;Mystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\n&gt;Faerain, level 18 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\n&gt;Faesong, level 8 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;(Blackburrow)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Get what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
