Not good if its #1, congrats if its #2.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually, the first.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but after spending the last 2 weeks<br/>\n&gt;gaining a half a bubble slowly over several hours, only to lose it in an<br/>\n&gt;instant at LEAST 6 times a day - I just got too frustrated.  I was trying<br/>\n&gt;to play by Brad&#39;s rules: group or die, so I was grouping, everywhere.  Died<br/>\n&gt;3 times in a row in Unrest, and the only support I got from my group was<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Dude, you&#39;re too low - you&#39;re gonna die if you come back!&quot; (I was 22nd.)<br/>\n&gt;I gave up on groups and decided to solo, but the very first pull, a simple<br/>\n&gt;Dark Boned Skeleton standing RIGHT at the side door, went awry, when the<br/>\n&gt;skeleton somehow decided that the door was not the shortest path to e, and<br/>\n&gt;ran through the entire house to get to me, of course, bringing the entire<br/>\n&gt;house with it.  I just /quit&#39;d, didn&#39;t even look back.  I can&#39;t play the<br/>\n&gt;game if I can&#39;t find a regular group, and every group I find that is<br/>\n&gt;halfway decent soon outstrips me in levels, so I gave up.<br/>\n&gt;  Enjoy it, and perhaps someday I&#39;ll be back, but for now, I will be<br/>\n&gt;leaving for greener pastures.  At least, single-player-friendly pastures.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talies the Retired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;P.S. I wasn&#39;t the only one to make this decision in my semi-regular group.<br/>\n&gt;After dying 3 times in a row to trains other groups brought over her in the<br/>\n&gt;space of 30 minutes, with NO opportunity to gain experience before dying<br/>\n&gt;again... well... she decided to quit, too.
