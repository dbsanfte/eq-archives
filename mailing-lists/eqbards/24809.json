The G1 cleric spent the enitre prep time asking me what loot he<br/>\nwould get, ignoring the instructions being shouted aout buffing.  I just<br/>\nsang the cancel magic song repeatedly as he continued buffing us (we were<br/>\nhaving a level 60 cleric and shaman friend buff everyone AFTER 4 dummy<br/>\nbuffs).  A monk on the raid TWICE agroed Vox on the buff area, among<br/>\ncountless other idiocy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be happy to never get my Epic if it meant never being on a raid like<br/>\nthat again.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
