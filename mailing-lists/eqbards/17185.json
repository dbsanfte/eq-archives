Playing against<br/>\nhuman brains is a lot more fun than against NPC&#39;s that do the same thing<br/>\nover and over. (I wish my friends would have switched to PvP server about 48<br/>\nlevels ago but we decided to stay on Innoruuk.)  There is no dynamic to EQ<br/>\nNPC&#39;s.  Once you find out what they do, you can rely on them to do it onver<br/>\nand over again.  In the PvP games that I have played, you can do obstensibly<br/>\nthe &quot;same thing&quot; over and over yet each time it can be different and unique.<br/>\nI am talk about the games where you are on more or less equal terms in<br/>\n&quot;equipment&quot; but the &quot;skills&quot; depend on the person and their ability to play<br/>\nthe game.  Games where you have to make decisions in battle and the<br/>\nsituation is dynamic.  And the dynamics come from having real live thinking<br/>\npeople as opponents vs pre-programmed NPC&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ has great potential for PvP in role playing situations but my year has<br/>\nbeen spent on an NPC server so I have seen very little of that.  On the<br/>\nother hand, I have been in &quot;scenarios&quot; in other games where you have 1000<br/>\nregistered players and each plays a &quot;role&quot; (not talking with accents but has<br/>\na tactical role in planned combat.)   These have been the most entertaining<br/>\nevents I have been part of.  EQ could do alot more of this to develop their<br/>\n&quot;GM Events&quot; or &quot;large scale events.&quot;  And we hashed this all out here<br/>\nbefore.  You need it to be &quot;staged&quot; in out of game venues (web pages,<br/>\ndiscussion forums, assigned team leaders, pre-planned actions) all this so<br/>\npeople know where to go and what to do once they get online and want to kill<br/>\nstuff.  Think of 2 teams of 6 full groups starting on opposite sides of<br/>\nRathe Mts with the objective of securing some designated spot like the<br/>\nburned out fortress.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have dueled, you know that the combat technique is alot different<br/>\nfrom soloing or grouping vs NPC&#39;s (you get to use all kinds of different<br/>\nsongs - and some of them actually work.)  But do any of us have significant<br/>\nexperience in &quot;guildwar&quot; combat?  Where multiple groups of comparable level<br/>\nand equipment face off to accomplish some tactical and or strategic goal?<br/>\nFighting against other people provides for a more dynamic combat and thus<br/>\nholds interest much longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the stuff you mention about how characters have become one-dimensional<br/>\nat the high levels - I pretty much agree with.  The way they have designed<br/>\nthe higher levels where multiple group combat is necessary kind of forces<br/>\nthis situation even more.  There is no &quot;west karana&quot; for level 50&#39;s to shout<br/>\nfor a group and go hunt &quot;tormented, undead, rotting, tentecle, thought<br/>\nravishing, bixie commanders.&quot;   Maybe expansion has these - 20 new dragons?<br/>\nZones larger than West K? Hmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting NPC&#39;s relies on them to make new npc&#39;s.  Fight other people can be<br/>\ndifferent each time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 4:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Attack speedups<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 30 Mar 2000, Sylly Songsynger wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You don&#39;t understand.
