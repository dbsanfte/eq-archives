The previous exp penalty is not actually a penalty perse, by <br/>\nthis I mean that there is no actual exp being docked per kill.  Bards <br/>\nwould actually physically need 1400 exp points to level, rather than <br/>\n1000.  Check with the people running ShowEQ to be sure.  The amount <br/>\nof EXP their character is receiving is the same regardless of class.  <br/>\nThe EXP Bar is just larger.  Also, the way VI is introducing this <br/>\nchange is extremelly and confusing if they&#39;re using one table <br/>\nand &quot;knocking off&quot; experience based on the classes.  Plus, I don&#39;t <br/>\nsee clearly how they (pre-patch) would divide the experience based <br/>\noff how much experience you have, i.e. a Bard at level 40 would have <br/>\nmore than a Cleric at level 40.  From your suggestion, the Bard would <br/>\nactually have the exact same amount, but it would have come from more <br/>\nkills.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is what you mean by the exp penalty COULD have been moved, <br/>\nthen I am confident that it&#39;s not.  I&#39;m pretty sure that they&#39;re <br/>\nusing seperate tables for each class/race combination rather than 1 <br/>\noverall table by all the other evidence available to us.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
