That is why I like EQ,<br/>\nI don&#39;t have to deal with trade skills to make money - I work enough in RL,<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to play a game and work there too.  In all of my years of<br/>\nroleplaying (AD&D, Amber, etc) I don&#39;t ever remembering anyone saying &#39;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to go out and explore and kill stuff, I would rather make armor<br/>\nor jewelry!&#39;  That is what NPC&#39;s did for you.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tJohn Kim[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, July 16, 1999 11:46 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [eqbards] Re: Item Values (meta)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Fri, 16 Jul 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; john writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Most people don&#39;t realize it, but a lot of the enjoyment of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the game is the anticipation just before you loot something -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;will it or won&#39;t it have a nice item?  I once modified the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;source of an RPG so I could start off with the best stuff.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;It made the game really boring - the item drops didn&#39;t matter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;because I already had the best stuff, so all that was left was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;endlessly killing monsters for experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think though that if less emphasis were placed on gathering items and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accumulating wealth in EQ, more emphasis would be put on the social<br/>\n&gt; aspect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of it.  I hate to use UO as an example but in this case it serves as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beautiful example.  It just had something EQ missed.  When you died you<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think EQ has enough infrastructure to survive on a<br/>\n&gt; purely social aspect.  There are no player-owned structures,<br/>\n&gt; there are no player-owned merchants, there are no item sinks,<br/>\n&gt; and there are very few money sinks (trade skills, steel armor)<br/>\n&gt; most of which (trade skills) were an afterthought coded in<br/>\n&gt; just before the game went Final.  In short, there really isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; much you can *do* in EQ which doesn&#39;t revolve around killing<br/>\n&gt; monsters to gain items and experience.  You can&#39;t really make<br/>\n&gt; your mark on the world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The PvP and Racewar servers definitely have more<br/>\n&gt; possibilities, but on the normal servers, socializing is not<br/>\n&gt; much different from an IRC chat room.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In that respect, UO is ahead of EQ.  I think EQ only strived<br/>\n&gt; to make massively multiplayer online hack and slash FRPG.  UO<br/>\n&gt; strived to make an online virtual world.  In the discussions<br/>\n&gt; Brad McQuaid and Raph Koster have had, it&#39;s pretty obvious EQ<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have as high a goal as UO.  Brad still refuses to admit<br/>\n&gt; that long-term money and item sinks are necessary in a<br/>\n&gt; persistent online game, to keep player ability inflation (and<br/>\n&gt; thus monster difficulty deflation) in check.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
