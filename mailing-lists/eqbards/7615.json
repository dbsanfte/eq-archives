It has all sorts<br/>\nof great quests for the various caster classes, here are the details I have<br/>\nso far: <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Enchanter Tashania Quest is commenced within the Temple from an NPC who<br/>\nwill give you a coin bag and a book of clues. Return with the 10 Coins of<br/>\nTash combined in the bag and 50gp to claim your scroll. <br/>\nEnchanters can also do a quest to obtain a Rod of Glamours. <br/>\nMagicians have four quests to obtain various items. The Robe of Elements,<br/>\nEarthen Boots, Circlet of Mist and Clay Bracelet. <br/>\nNecromancers and Wizards also have quests for various class specific items,<br/>\nbut I still need details on these. <br/>\nThere is apparently a quest involving the Crystal of Kintaz which wipes<br/>\nmemories. It is beleived at this time you can use this to change<br/>\nspecialisations. <br/>\nThere is also a new quest to make Shadow Silk, for Necromancer only armour. <br/>\nThe temple is located opposite the Solusek Dungeons in Lavastorm, and is a<br/>\nlittle bit tricky to enter until you figure out how, but it won&#39;t take long.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, more cool stuff for casters just what the world of Norrath needs.  Why<br/>\ndo we even try to play non-casters any more.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
