And<br/>\nnot because a &quot;pull&quot; is screwed up but because it is the way things are<br/>\ngoing to pull.  In this case, crowd control falls to the class that is best<br/>\nable to deal with it: enchanter(s).  When my guild goes on a raid to a<br/>\nserious place (fire giants, ice giants, dragons, planes) we have 2<br/>\nenchanters.  I can&#39;t tell you exactly which mez spell they use on which mob,<br/>\nmany times they charm (can&#39;t mez giants?) but whatever they do, one of their<br/>\nbest specialties is crowd control.  In some situations, other guilds use<br/>\nother tactics (2 clerics per tank group & level 50 tanks) and just beat down<br/>\nwhat they can and res back until they have cleared what they want.  We like<br/>\nour enchanters to do crowd control (we like Clarity & Swift Like The Wind<br/>\ntoo ;p)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some fun we decided to jump into the pit under Vox&#39;s Lair and clear out<br/>\nthe giant polar bears, wooly spider, & dire wolves.  If you fall down the<br/>\nfirst pitfall, you land in a room with 5 or 6 giant polar bears (blue to me<br/>\nat 48).  They are positioned such that if you pull one you will get several.<br/>\nWe had 3 groups, 2 enchanters and no problems dealing with them.  Too bad<br/>\nVerant forgot to itemize them with any loot.  It was fun jumping into some<br/>\nplace that you usually try so hard to avoid and then cleaning house.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in other situations, you are going to face multi-mob pulls.  Plane of<br/>\nHate getting a couple Clerics, Scron Banshee and Forsaken Rev in one pull is<br/>\nfairly normal and with enchanters&#39; crowd control, your teams can deal with<br/>\nit.  We go for everyone kill the same mob and fite them one at a time.  We<br/>\nhave designated taunters in the event a pet or something breaks and gets on<br/>\na cleric or enchanter but the main group assists the primary and secondary<br/>\ntarget pickers.  (Make hotkeys that say &quot;/assist name1&quot;  and &quot;/assist name2&quot;<br/>\nrather than just &quot;/assist&quot;).  Even so, we see that the assist command is<br/>\nbuggy and sometimes you cant get a target or get a bad target but the intent<br/>\nis to focus on one mob at a time.  It something that we have worked out<br/>\ngiven how we load groups (one cleric per tank group).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the biggest value of having a SOP (Standard Operating Plan) is<br/>\nmaintaining a coordinated effort.  If everyone has a job and sticks to it,<br/>\nyou eliminate the confusion that can rapidly escalate into disaster when<br/>\nsomebody gets creative and &#39;trys something&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 48 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Illian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, March 04, 2000 12:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Breaking from conventional tactics<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Admitted, but the point was an Enchanter who is mezzing is doing so<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; the party screwed up in the first place IMHO...<br/>\n&gt; :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Perhaps a Princess...
