Many Bard tasks can be done better by<br/>\n&gt;Enchanters.  Crowd control, buffs, and mana regen are the big three.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once the enchanters get the spells. As a low level bard, I have grouped with<br/>\nnear-level enchanters with no problems whatsoever. Consider using the bard<br/>\nsongs for the buffs (quickness, etc) and saving the enchanter&#39;s mana for<br/>\ncrowd control -- their specialty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, to some extent, this is the same problem that enchanters get when<br/>\nyou have two in the same group -- and bards when you have two.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Problem 2: Enchanters make Bard AoE songs more or less useless.<br/>\n&gt;Since so many<br/>\n&gt;of our songs are AoE, our playlist is more limited than a Los<br/>\n&gt;Angeles Top 40<br/>\n&gt;FM station when grouping with an enchanter.  I&#39;ve just learned on this list<br/>\n&gt;that Largo does NOT wake up mezzed mobs, so I&#39;m adding that back into my<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Enchanter Hotkey&quot; bank.  That&#39;s good news.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not high enough level to have lots of problem with this. Do the Rhythms<br/>\nsongs mess up enchanters? How about heal (though I know you probably don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to play that in combat) According to the list at caster&#39;s realm thoug,<br/>\nonly 7 of our songs are AoE in the fist place. And the last is a 48th level<br/>\nsong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know how many of the buffs overwrite higher level enchanter buffs<br/>\nas my enchanter is still lower level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;charm classes too.
