Apparently does not teleport <br/>\nyou through walls or locked doors. In a dungeon, this song can get you in a <br/>\nwhole lot of trouble. Outdoors, however, with a flute in hand, it has an <br/>\namazing range. From the front gate of Qeynos one pulse can jump you to the <br/>\nzone line or 2 feet away. Lots of fun, you do a silly dance while playing <br/>\nit. This song is very useful to get characters unstuck from a <br/>\nwall/crack/floor/etc... when a GM is not around. In a situation where the <br/>\nentire party is trying to flee a monster or group of monsters, <br/>\ntheoretically, this song can help, but it is very risky, as the entire party <br/>\nwill be separated and will be on their own to make it to the zone border. <br/>\nUse with caution.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 22: Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, Cancel Magic<br/>\nSkill: String (Required)<br/>\nLocation: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nAnalysis: This song is supposed to get rid of all DoT and de-buffs that have <br/>\nbeen cast upon a party, but leave all of your buffs intact. A few people <br/>\nhave reported that it has worked for them but many bards report no effect at <br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 23: Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain<br/>\nEffects: TARGET, Snare -Attack Speed<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: HighHold Pass<br/>\nUpgrades: Reports from high (45+) level bards that song will stop movement <br/>\nat half HP.<br/>\nAnalysis: This song will allow you to snare runners, a very useful thing, <br/>\nand also slows attack speed of target.  One big advantage of this song is <br/>\nthat it can be &#39;cast&#39; while moving, unlike casters that must standstill to <br/>\ncast their snare/root spell.  This can be a life saver in dungeons.  This <br/>\nsong will break root/snare from casters so be careful using in a party, <br/>\nunless you are the designated snarer.  This song can also be used to break <br/>\nroot indoors on yourself, you will move slowly which is better then not at <br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 24: Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, Ultravision See invisible<br/>\nSkill: Wind<br/>\nLocation: Erudin<br/>\nUpgrades: N/A<br/>\nNote: Not weavable with Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding.<br/>\nAnalysis: Allows you to see invisible, as well as give you ultravision <br/>\n(useful for blind humans). This song also tends to give everything a bluish <br/>\nhue.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 25: Psalm of Warmth<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, Infravision +Cold rest Fire-based damage shield +AC<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Erudin, Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Damage shield at every 5 levels after 26 (ie 6 dam at 31, 7 dam at <br/>\n36). Cold rest every other level?<br/>\nAnalysis: Increases resistance to cold-based spells, gives a small AC boast, <br/>\nInfravsion, and most importantly will give a party-wide fire based damage <br/>\nshield (starts at 5 damage).  This damage shield will stack with all <br/>\nnon-cold based damage shields.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 26: Angstlich&#39;s Apalling Screech<br/>\nEffects: NON-PARTY, AE Fear<br/>\nSkill: Brass<br/>\nLocation: Kelethin<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nAnalysis: This song is great for when you need to run when a battle has gone <br/>\nbad, it is also useful to give the casters time to get off an Evac/gate as <br/>\nwell.  Another use for this song is while soloing/grouping outdoors.  Fear <br/>\nthe target then Chain it and enjoy wacking on its back while it runs from <br/>\nthe scary bard. If you group with a Rogue they will love you, backstabs <br/>\ngalore.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 27: Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens<br/>\nEffects: TARGET, Charm<br/>\nSkill: Wind<br/>\nLocation: Kelethin<br/>\nUpgrades: None, charm is limited to mobs 37th lvl and under.<br/>\nAnalysis: Will charm a monster for ~ 15 seconds. During that time, the <br/>\nmonster will respond to /pet commands. Allows you to do things like charm <br/>\nD&#39;Vinn and tell him to attack Crush. Be careful though, because when the <br/>\ncharm wears off, the monster will frenzy on you.  PC/NPC pets are immune to <br/>\ncharm as long as the owner is alive.  This is another song that requires a <br/>\nfull hot key bank to use effectively. Hot key this sing and the following <br/>\npet commands (using socials) /pet attack, /pet back off, /pet who is leader, <br/>\n/pet sit down, /pet follow.  Sometimes a mob will agro on a party member use <br/>\n/pet back off to fix this.  This song takes a lot of practice to get right, <br/>\nbut once you do the results are worth it.  Interesting use for this song is <br/>\nto stop kill stealing spell casters. If you spot a wizard trying to steal <br/>\nyour kill, just charm the monster. In the 10 or so seconds that the monsters <br/>\nis charmed, the wizard will have dumped about all of his mana, casting <br/>\nspells on the now spell-proof monster. When charm wears off, kill the <br/>\nmonster and retain the looting rights while the caster looks on in confusion <br/>\nand frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 28: Crission&#39;s Pixie Chase<br/>\nEffects: TARGET, Mesmerize/Stun<br/>\nSkill: Wind<br/>\nLocation: Kelethin<br/>\nUpgrades: N/A<br/>\nAnalysis: This is a single target Mesmerize song. If you have good targeting <br/>\nyou can mez up to 3 targets at a time(this can be very hard to do). Any <br/>\nattack against the mob will wake it up, so besure to inform your party when <br/>\nyou do this.  This song is also useful for intrupting NPC spell casters, for <br/>\nPC casters Bellow is a better choice (harder to resist).<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 29: Psalm of Vitality<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, +AC +Poison resist<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Every other level?<br/>\nUnconfirmed Analysis: Increase resistance to poison and gives a small AC <br/>\nincrease. Does not provide a damage shield like Psalm of Warmth.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 30: Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant<br/>\nEffects: Target, -Magic Resistance Dot<br/>\nSkill: Percussion<br/>\nLocation: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Every other level?<br/>\nNote: Stacks with all other DOT songs.<br/>\nAnalysis: This song has a small dot effect and lowers magic resistance.  The <br/>\nMR debuff will stack with Encahnter/Shamen MR debuffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 31: Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, Levitation<br/>\nSkill: Wind<br/>\nLocation: HighHold<br/>\nUpgrades: N/A<br/>\nAnalysis: The range on this song is short, so it is not too useful in party <br/>\nsituations unfortunatly.  This can be a dangerous song to use in dungeon <br/>\nsettings, as it will allow all mobs in dungeon rooms above and below you to <br/>\nattack. Since these mobs will be attacking through walls, ceilings, and <br/>\nfloors, you will not be able to fight back. If this happens to you, <br/>\nimmediately stop playing the song. Once you stop levitating, the mobs will <br/>\nno longer be able to attack you through. Zone immediately, as the mobs what <br/>\nwere attacking you, will now be racing through the dungeon to find and kill <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 32: Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, Mana Regeneration<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nAnalysis: This is the Holy Grail song of any party with mana users. There <br/>\nhave been mixed reports on the weavability of this song, as it gives no on <br/>\nscreen icon.  The song will stack with Enchanter Clarity for a further <br/>\nincrease to mana regen and will stack with itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 33: Psalm of Cooling<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, Ultravision +Fire Resist +AC Cold-based damgage shield<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Any<br/>\nUpgrades: Damage shield does same damage as Psalm of Warmth.<br/>\nAnalysis: The damage shield will NOT stack with non-cold based damage <br/>\nshield. It will actually subtract from them, so a magician shield that did <br/>\n13 damage will only do 7 when stacked with this song.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 34: Lyssa&#39;s Solidarity of Vision<br/>\nEffects: TARGET, Bind sight<br/>\nSkill: Wind<br/>\nLocation: Erudin<br/>\nUpgrades: N/A<br/>\nAnalysis: This song allows you to see though the eyes of the target. This <br/>\ncan be a PC or NPC. You can &#39;chain&#39; this by targeting something you see from <br/>\nthe current target and restarting the song.  This song has a zone wide <br/>\nrange.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 35: Denon&#39;s Dissension<br/>\nEffects: TARGET, AE Drain Mana<br/>\nSkill: Brass<br/>\nLocation: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nAnalysis: The mana drain rate is very slow and as many mobs seem to have <br/>\nunlimited mana not of great use.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 36: Vilia&#39;s Verses of Celerity<br/>\nEffects: PARTY: +AGI +Attack speed<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Every level?<br/>\nNote: Does not stack with Anthem de Arms, does stack with Chant of Battle<br/>\nAnalysis: Stacks nicely with Chant of Battle, to increase DEX, STR, and AGI <br/>\nand increase the parties attack speed. The attack speed component does not <br/>\nstack with Enchanter/Shamen attack speed spell lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 37: Psalm of Purity<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, +Disease Resist +AC<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Every other level?<br/>\nAnalysis: Does not provide a damage shield<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 38: Tuyen&#39;s Chant of Flame<br/>\nEffects: Target, -Fire Resist DoT<br/>\nSkill: Percussion Instruments<br/>\nLocation: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Every level?<br/>\nNote: Stacks with all other DOT songs.<br/>\nAnalysis: It does 36 damage total over three ticks (the song&#39;s duration) and <br/>\ndrops<br/>\nFire Resistance 14 points (at 48th level), if you use a drum. Without a <br/>\ndrum,<br/>\nit does 24 damage total, and still lowers Fire Resistance by 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 39: Not implemented<br/>\nEffects:<br/>\nSkill:<br/>\nLocation:<br/>\nUpgrades:<br/>\nAnalysis:<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 40: Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aria<br/>\nEffects: Target, Cancel magic<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Kelethin<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nAnalysis: Removes one buff per pulse.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 41: Psalm of Mystic Shielding<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, +Magic Resistance<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Qeynos, Kelethin<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nUnconfirmed Analysis: Increases magic resistance by 50<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 42: McVaxius Beserker Cresendo<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, +STR +Attack Speed<br/>\nSkill: Brass<br/>\nLocation: Freeport<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nUnconfirmed Analysis: The attack speed increase is better than Celerity. <br/>\nDoes not stack with Chant of Battle, Anthem de Arms or Vilia&#39;s Verses of <br/>\nCelerity.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 43: Denon&#39;s Desparate Dirge<br/>\nEffects: NON-PARTY, AE DD<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nNotes: Only mana using sing, requires 800 mana. Currently Bard mana is <br/>\nIntelligence based.<br/>\nAnalysis: This song does a one-time damage of 400 points to each monster <br/>\nwithin its radius. That&#39;s up to 1600 points of damage to 4 monsters. Due to <br/>\nit&#39;s power, Verant restricted its usage, making it the only Bard song to <br/>\nrequire mana. One use of this song is engineered to drain most, if not all <br/>\nof a Bard&#39;s mana. Supposedly it will take 30 minutes of sitting down or <br/>\nabout an hour of doing normal actions before the Bard&#39;s mana level will have <br/>\nrecovered enough to use this song. Mana regeneration spells, songs, or items <br/>\nhave no effect on a Bard&#39;s mana regeneration rate. The mana drain has been <br/>\nengineered such that no matter what buffs are cast or no matter what INT <br/>\nenhancing items you have, there will be no way to sing this song 2 times, <br/>\nback to back. This song is currently bugged as singing it will do 400points <br/>\nto the Bard himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 44: Cassindra&#39;s Elegy<br/>\nEffects: PARTY, +WIS +INT<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nLocation: Erudin<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nAnalysis: at 48th level, this song will raise Wisdom and Intelligence by 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 45: Not implemented<br/>\nEffects:<br/>\nSkill:<br/>\nLocation:<br/>\nUpgrades:<br/>\nAnalysis:<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 46: Tuyen&#39;s Chant of Frost<br/>\nEffects: TARGET, -Cold Resist DoT<br/>\nSkill: Percussion<br/>\nLocation: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nNotes: Stacks with other DoT songs.<br/>\nAnalysis: It does 36 damage total over three ticks (the song&#39;s duration) and <br/>\ndrops Cold Resistance 14 points (at 48th level), if you use a drum. Without <br/>\na drum, it does 24 damage total, and still lowers Cold Resistance by 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 47: Not implemented<br/>\nEffects:<br/>\nSkill:<br/>\nLocation:<br/>\nUpgrades:<br/>\nAnalysis:<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 48: Selo&#39;s Chords of Cessation<br/>\nEffects: NON-PARTY, AE -Attack speed DoT<br/>\nSkill: Stringed<br/>\nLocation: High Hold<br/>\nUpgrades: Unknown<br/>\nAnalysis: Does 40 damage per tick.
