I am now in my 14th<br/>\n&gt;level and feeling darn proud about myself<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=================================<br/>\nHail! And good job reaching 14th!!!! Many do not make it that far before<br/>\nquitting, or changing professions! Congrats!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;A person I met in Qeynos told me about the mailing list so I thought I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>would<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;check it out.<br/>\n&gt;and from the archived Messages I have read so far, this mailing list proves<br/>\n&gt;to be an excellent source of Bard information<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=================================<br/>\nThis list IS a VERY good source of info fo us. There aren&#39;t 5 year olds<br/>\nloose running around like there are in the EQ newsgroup, and there are some<br/>\nVERY knowledgable folks here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What are some good strength raising Items a level 14 Bard can obtain?? I am<br/>\n&gt;pursuing the purchase of a set of &quot;veiwable&quot; Bronze Armor (so far I have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;plate, helm, bracers) and the weight can be crippling as I only placed 85<br/>\n&gt;strength when I started my character,  Items that raise strength I have so<br/>\n&gt;far are: Silver Amber rings and a spiked collar this brings my strength up<br/>\n&gt;to 89 but I am always quite near encumbered and if I wish to carry any Loot<br/>\n&gt;with me I have to suffer a loss of speed and agility.  I know things like<br/>\n&gt;the bloodstained mantle and tunic raise strength, as well as the &quot;Thick<br/>\n&gt;Banded Belt&quot; found in Guk (as I have read on EQ&#39;Lizer)  currently I have<br/>\n&gt;around 50plat in the bank, and was wondering if I could afford any of these<br/>\n&gt;things<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>===============================<br/>\nI, too, have went nuts trying to raise my STR through items, and so far have<br/>\ngone from a 90 to a 108. You already have things I would have suggested at<br/>\nyour level, and the BS Mantle is still a bit more than 50pp (at least on<br/>\nBertox, my server). The Thick Banded Belt, I have never seen. But in UPPER<br/>\nGuk you can get a Trollhide belt which raises your STR by 5 points, and the<br/>\ncool thing is, it is Bard/Rogue only, so you don&#39;t have to fight campers or<br/>\nother classes trying to get it.  I also have a BS Mantle, as well as a pair<br/>\nof STR rings and a pair of STR earrings. Use the /auction and try to find a<br/>\njewler that will make some STR items for you, too. The lower ones should be<br/>\naffordable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Should I start using the Dragoon dirk as my primary weapon to gain peirce<br/>\n&gt;skill or should I invest in a FS rapier instead??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>================================<br/>\nUnless you plan to use TWO piercing weapons, or unless you just HAVE to have<br/>\nthe &quot;car antenna&quot; look, totally forget about the FS Rapier. NEVER buy one.<br/>\nIt is inferior to the Dragoon Dirk, and is MUCH more expensive, too. I was<br/>\ngiven a FS Rapier in trade, which you can buy from the vendor for approx<br/>\n280pp. Well, I tried to sell it for 100pp, and EVERYONE laughed at me.<br/>\nLooking at the stats... yes... a Dragoon Dirk IS better, and you can get one<br/>\nof those for 20-40pp. So, forget about it. Really. Honestly. Unless you want<br/>\nthe look, or want to use 2 piercers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Where should a person of my level be fighting? I don&#39;t really care about<br/>\n&gt;where it is on the world as travel is quite easy for me ).  BlackBurrow is<br/>\n&gt;becoming quite boring, I found Crushbone to be overcamped and not really<br/>\n&gt;worthwhile.  Are places like dagnor&#39;s cauldron or Lavastorm safe for me??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>================================<br/>\nAt your level, I was camping the Nybright Sisters in Lesser Fay. Not too<br/>\nmany people were there yet, GREAT XP, constant fighting if you broke the<br/>\nspawn right, and GREAT loot. I have been told, however, that the loot has<br/>\nbeen altered now, and they don&#39;t drop bronze NEAR as often. Pitty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and lastly  what are some really good &quot;weaving, juggling, twisting, or<br/>\n&gt;medlying&quot; methods??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>================================<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve read some of the archived messages, many other bards here have<br/>\ndiscussed how to use hotkeys to help mix songs.  I haven&#39;t tried that myself<br/>\nyet, but soon shall!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Gleeman, the roving bard, who&#39;s big mouth has landed him in trouble more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>often than not<br/>\n=================================<br/>\nTrust me, I know that feeling of getting into trouble (smile)<br/>\n<br/>\nTallonn Stringfellow - 34th Verse<br/>\nBertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
