The name they gave to it,<br/>\n&#39;Farming&#39;, doesn&#39;t help in what they intend it to mean either. Are we<br/>\nplanting these creatures to harvest them? Odd.\tDoes it also mean a spell<br/>\ncan&#39;t be used to lure a creature into an ambush? What other point of luring<br/>\na creature is there?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI also have a disagreement that they consider price gouging an exploit.<br/>\nWTH? Isn&#39;t EQ an economy? In times of high demand, price goes up. If there<br/>\nis high supply, no one is forcing someone to buy an item at the high price.<br/>\nCompetition will always sell for less.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut then again I am only a lowly opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
