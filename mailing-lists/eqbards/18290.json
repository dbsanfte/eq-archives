Song of Dawn seems to do nothing, Song of<br/>\n&gt; Twilight is an upgrade to pixie&#39;s and therefore works just as <br/>\n&gt; poorly.  I had<br/>\n&gt; huge hopes for this one, eqcasters listed it as a stun, not a mes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 54 song...worthless.  45% haste means nothing when any <br/>\n&gt; haste item+any<br/>\n&gt; haste spell/song gives you max haste.  even anthem is better <br/>\n&gt; than this.  was<br/>\n&gt; hoping that since the haste cap was raised above 75% (i think <br/>\n&gt; it can get as<br/>\n&gt; high as 100% now and is based on level and class, ranger i <br/>\n&gt; was fighting with<br/>\n&gt; was at 90% at level 53) it would mean something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 55 song...nice, but reaffirms us as mana pumps, and i&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; gonna hate<br/>\n&gt; having to switch to lute between every fight to get the max <br/>\n&gt; potential from<br/>\n&gt; this (ok so i am lazy, my fingers hurt after weaving songs <br/>\n&gt; for 12 hours in<br/>\n&gt; upper bugs for 1.5 bubbles).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 56 songs...both geared for running away from bad <br/>\n&gt; situations, dunno how<br/>\n&gt; useful they will be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 57 song...worhtless, when was the last time you used denon&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; dissension?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 58 songs...one nice there is nothing wrong with an AC <br/>\n&gt; increase, can<br/>\n&gt; weave it with Vov, the other is the same useless piece of <br/>\n&gt; crap the level 45<br/>\n&gt; song is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 59 song...is this a joke?  yes the real reason i have <br/>\n&gt; for getting to<br/>\n&gt; level 50 is so i can charisma buff my entire party! woohoo!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 60 songs...both look awesome at first glance, hopefully <br/>\n&gt; make it worth<br/>\n&gt; the frustration of getting to 60.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Level 39 song...soon worthless as we start fighting mobs <br/>\n&gt; above level 49, but<br/>\n&gt; i use the hell out of it now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; btw Parry caps at 75.  guess we can assume riposte does also, <br/>\n&gt; i was hoping<br/>\n&gt; more along 125 but better than nothing i guess, though <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to work<br/>\n&gt; much at that cap.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ok these thoughts just came from conversations with the level <br/>\n&gt; 54 bard in my<br/>\n&gt; guild.  i am trying not to get depressed.  someone cheer me <br/>\n&gt; up, please!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada Powa, L52 Wood Elf Minstrel<br/>\n&gt; Tyria Sarkin, L50 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Avoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online <br/>\n&gt; reservations.
