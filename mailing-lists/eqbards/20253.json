They <br/>\nwere so pitiful I couldn&#39;t believe it.  After recovering my corpse, I just <br/>\nlogged in disgust and went to clean the house and do laundry...

And they are SK&#39;s, which <br/>\nmeans harm touch and low level necro spells.  They also give bad Venril <br/>\nSather faction, so use care in case you happen to run into the evil outpost <br/>\nfor groceries (which are expensive as hell, anyone else notice that???)  I <br/>\nassume you are interested in the scorpicus scrounger for the Nostrolo <br/>\nTambourine quest.  Well, in case it helps, the other day I and a level 42 <br/>\nwizzie killed one.  Basically I ran over to where the chasm starts (where <br/>\nthey live), tracked the nearest Scorpicus Scrounger, and ran in with Selos <br/>\nand Elemental Rythms going.  Tagged him (and another unfortunately decided <br/>\nto join, although the rest left me alone) and carefully drew him out towards <br/>\nthe zone where my wizzie was waiting.  Keep Selos going (just in case), but <br/>\ngo slowly or you will lose it.  Also keep Elemental Rythms going to protect <br/>\nyou from the stuff he&#39;ll try to hit you with.  We finished it off fairly <br/>\nquickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst one I pulled up had a coin.  Case closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and a level 41 bard ran into me at the zone Friday night and said, &quot;Hey, <br/>\nit&#39;s Olgwinn from the eq bards list!&quot;  hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 39 Missed Notes<br/>\nE&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
