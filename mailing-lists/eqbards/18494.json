This came across last <br/>\nnight as I was grouped with another bard, which hasn&#39;t happened to me in a <br/>\nlong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are 2 bards in the group and both are singing Chorus of Clarity, <br/>\nis mana recovered faster than if just 1 were singing it? I checked with <br/>\nsome bards logged on-line last night and received a &quot;no&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot; and a <br/>\n&quot;yes, most definitely&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the &quot;no&quot; answer came from a bard who didn&#39;t realize that Anthem <br/>\nde Arms was an Atk speed buff, and thought that Whistling Warsong buffed <br/>\nthe entire party. : ) Man, he needs to read Rokken&#39;s website.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong<br/>\nClan Battlehammer<br/>\nBertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
