(I gotta learn to keep my mouth<br/>\nshut)<br/>\nA few questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am about to break out of 40 (like 3/4 bub left, it should fall tonight no<br/>\nproblem)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means I will learn Max&#39;s Beserker Cresendo soon.  When i am the haster<br/>\n(IE no enchanter in group) I use Celerity now (which i LOVE, the agi buff<br/>\ngives a nice ac boost).  Do the experienced (I aask since its high level<br/>\nsong) bards think Besrker is better?  (it gives str boost I think the haste<br/>\neffect is the same)<br/>\n(This is excluding the obvious benefit of guildmates saying &quot;Olaf, do<br/>\nBeserker.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLoot:  I need to upgrade my belt, back and shoulders.  What do you all<br/>\nreccomend out there?  I like maxing my AC, Resists, CHA, and STR (in that<br/>\norder).  Right now I have a Kunzar Mantle (idiot me looted it not knowing it<br/>\nwas no drop) (ac7, wis,dex,agi +3), a splinted bronze cloak (UGH!) and a<br/>\nstraw spun belt (ac 10, but weighs 6...).  I have about 2k right now and<br/>\ndont really have trouble making money, though I would rather go get a guild<br/>\nrun to get new items...  Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro<br/>\nBard of Norrath since December.  Well not including March and April.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
