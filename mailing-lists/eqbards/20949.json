I don&#39;t know about<br/>\nyou,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but have you ever missed a song because the blue didn&#39;t show up well in<br/>\n&gt; full<br/>\n&gt; &gt; screen mode?  You ever forget to click run and get beat to death as you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposedly selo&#39;s to zone?  I hate having to always change to full<br/>\nscreen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (not much effort, but it does get old).  I like what Verant did here and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give them credit for it.  I just wish...  Ah, nevermind, enough said on<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; line already.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, I want to share what I did and see if any of you have had any<br/>\nsuccess<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the color changes.  I first made my songs red - I wanted to see<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boldly, but that mixed in with resist so not good.  I then changed songs<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yellow - that shows up really well in all modes.  Damage shields (if you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still have them on) also show up in yellow, but I typically am not<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beat on that long even if pulling, so not a problem.  I also changed<br/>\nskill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; increases to red.  I use a parser sure, but I like to see them (or at<br/>\n&gt; least<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a chance - blue sucks imho - I could never catch what was said -<br/>\n&gt; song,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill or whatever - in blue).
