A friendly shaman was <br/>\nbuffing me and cast SoW (he didn&#39;t mean to, poor guy) while I was singing <br/>\nAccelerando with a drum. For the rest of the duration of SoW, Accelerando <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work. I&#39;m only level 16, but even at so low a level, a bard with a <br/>\ndrum can outrun SoW slightly (I&#39;ve been stuck at 16 long enough to notice <br/>\nthe difference). I zoned several times and even logged out a couple of times <br/>\nwhile the SoW was still in &quot;affect&quot; (If you try to cancel SoW yourself by <br/>\nleft-clicking the icon, you get the &quot;You cannot remove this affect&quot; <br/>\nmessage). No matter what, Selo&#39;s didn&#39;t work. I still ran at SoW speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I still kept strumming my drum. And the song icon bubble was greyed out. <br/>\nAnd I made little song sparklies. But there was no &quot;Your feet move faster&quot; <br/>\nmessage, and I was stuck running at SoW speed until the darn thing wore off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s been like this for a while, sorry. It&#39;s just that I seem to remember <br/>\nthat Accelerando used to override SoW, not the other way around (you would <br/>\nstill have the SoW icon, but you&#39;d run at Accelerando speed and get the <br/>\n&quot;Your feet move faster&quot; message).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Juke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] More secret nerfing<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 31 Aug 1999 21:30:17 -0400 (EDT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Tue, 31 Aug 1999, M Sanford wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can now no longer use Selo&#39;s Consonant Chains on rooted, ensnared or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SoW&#39;d mobs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The rooted or ensnared part I dont mind, but not being able to chain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SoW&#39;d or SoC&#39;d mobs is very aggravating. When they flee, they cannot be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stopped. Especially in dungeons where the NPCs can cast SoW indoors,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; although PCs cannot.

I&#39;ve written at length about the<br/>\n&gt;problems and ill-feelings that develop when you make monsters<br/>\n&gt;work by different rules than players.  Instead of reducing<br/>\n&gt;these differences, Verant seems to be increasing them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Unless of course this means that players with SoW or<br/>\n&gt;Accelerando cannot be rooted by mobs?  That still seems<br/>\n&gt;terribly unfair to the classes who cannot SoW or Accelerando<br/>\n&gt;themselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
