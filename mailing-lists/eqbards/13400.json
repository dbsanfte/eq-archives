But things change.  I haven&#39;t played my cleric in<br/>\n2 months.  I&#39;m spending most of my time on my mage (lvl 12) or necro (lvl<br/>\n9).  If you can&#39;t beat them, join&#39;em.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to mage&#39;s healing pets, I don&#39;t think clerics have any problem with it.<br/>\nMages can only heal their pets, nothing else.  It&#39;s difficult for a cleric<br/>\nto monitor a pet&#39;s hp.  Plus a cleric has enough to heal usually.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the mage&#39;s perspective, healing pets is not that great.  Even the<br/>\nhighest level pet can be summoned for 200 mana.  Spending 100 mana (20th lvl<br/>\nheal) to heal a bubble may be a waste when a fully fresh pet is only 200<br/>\nmana.  And pets heal naturally much faster than players, nearly as fast as<br/>\nmana regen rate, making healing less needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the anti-group oriented nature, mages also got the &quot;mana stone<br/>\nreplacement&quot;.  It is far from actually being a summoned mana stone, but with<br/>\nthe new ban of mana stones on the planes, people might find them useful.<br/>\nTime will tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to tie this back to Bards, how do Bards feel about not being able to<br/>\naffect party pets?  Other classes can buff, heal, and improve pets.  Bards<br/>\nseem left out in this ability.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
