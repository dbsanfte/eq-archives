I couldn&#39;t care less if the items <br/>\n&gt; along the way<br/>\n&gt; in the quest were &#39;no drop&#39; because I plan on keeping them to <br/>\n&gt; complete the<br/>\n&gt; quest anyhow.  Having the reward be &#39;no drop&#39; and incredibly <br/>\n&gt; restricted in<br/>\n&gt; its usability just makes quests less worthwhile.  From what I <br/>\n&gt; have seen very<br/>\n&gt; few people do quests anyhow so I doubt this would break any <br/>\n&gt; item rarity<br/>\n&gt; overmuch.  I even traded a Shining Star of Light to a 38th <br/>\n&gt; level cleric from<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos who could easily have done the quest but didn&#39;t want <br/>\n&gt; to lose valuable<br/>\n&gt; camping time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: David Knadler [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 3:44 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\n&gt; Importance: Low<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: David Knadler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dknadler@...\">dknadler@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [snip]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Personally I also hate letting items go to waste, but it at <br/>\n&gt; least fits<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in with Verant&#39;s appearant philosophy of keeping items rare <br/>\n&gt; &gt; by any means<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possible. If they didn&#39;t have the items no drop, they&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably cut the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spawn of items even more to assure that everyone didn&#39;t have one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also think they implemented the &quot;NO DROP&quot; flag to minimize <br/>\n&gt; the amount of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;farming&quot; & &quot;harvesting&quot; of items.  Without it, you know that <br/>\n&gt; there would be<br/>\n&gt; people camping quest item spawns and then attempting to sell <br/>\n&gt; the items.  &quot;NO<br/>\n&gt; DROP&quot; isn&#39;t the perfect solution, but I consider it to be the <br/>\n&gt; lesser of two<br/>\n&gt; evils.  In fact, from what I understand of the game mechanics <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; they could come up with an ideal solution without a major <br/>\n&gt; overhaul of the<br/>\n&gt; entire system.  Also, in a FRPG milieu, it makes perfect sense to keep<br/>\n&gt; certain items rare and unique - unfortunately, most people <br/>\n&gt; consider it their<br/>\n&gt; birthright to eventually own these particular items simply <br/>\n&gt; because they<br/>\n&gt; exist - and they&#39;ll go to great lengths to obtain them.  If <br/>\n&gt; every rare item<br/>\n&gt; was dropped all the time, it would just be a matter of time <br/>\n&gt; before everyone<br/>\n&gt; in the game had the best equipment (for their class) with <br/>\n&gt; little regard for<br/>\n&gt; level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Desmei Sightblinder<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 30 Bard [Povar]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\n&gt; the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;        Thinking about putting your business on the Web? <br/>\n&gt; MindSpring Biz has helped over 100,000 businesses get their .com.<br/>\n&gt;              Join MindSpring Biz and save $50!  <br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mindspring4\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mindspring4</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
