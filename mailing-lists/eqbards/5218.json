I&#39;m sure he could settle this<br/>\nissue once and for all.  Did Verant put a muzzle on him for posting details<br/>\nof game mechanics on this list?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m in the US Army and have been playing EQ since April.  Until today<br/>\nI have never seen/heard the term Black Helicopter used as a reference to<br/>\nanything, military or EQ related.  What does this reference mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, I have also noticed an increase in missed notes but only since it was<br/>\nbrought up on this list.  IIRC, it happens mainly during combat when the lag<br/>\nis bad.  If my wife lets me play anytime soon I will do some tests for<br/>\nmyself:-)    <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tChris Kuenster (Entex) [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, August 11, 1999 11:14 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] Missed Notes<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry, I am just more than a little ticked off at the &quot;Black Helicopter&quot;<br/>\n&gt; comment earlier in the chain. And someone saying this is being imagined<br/>\n&gt; because someone brought it to our attention. What I am saying is I never<br/>\n&gt; missed notes on the bulk of my songs prior to 2 weeks ago. I have not gone<br/>\n&gt; out and kept track of #s because it isnt realistic to what I am doing in<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; everchanging battle situation. I am in Lower Guk, the #s and types of mobs<br/>\n&gt; is so fluid I may have to go from one strategy to a completely different<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; mid battle, and a missed note can cause the death of our whole party. Dont<br/>\n&gt; laugh till you&#39;ve been there, all frogs are not created equal. If I cant<br/>\n&gt; play my twisted tunes I may as well sing the Mana song and melee without<br/>\n&gt; worrying about being a Bard anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 11, 1999 1:48 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Missed Notes<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh sorry, thought I gave you numbers, I tried to use Denons 30 times and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; missed notes everytime. It never fired. Are those good enough?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually, you said &quot;maybe a total of 30 times&quot;.   Not exactly precise<br/>\n&gt; numbers.<br/>\n&gt; So you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s a 100 percent failure rate on a sample size of<br/>\n&gt; 30?  I<br/>\n&gt; certainly understand why you&#39;d be upset.  Thing is, that&#39;s awfully hard to<br/>\n&gt; believe when I haven&#39;t had a failure rate of higher than 10 percent on any<br/>\n&gt; song<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve tested with recently.  Nobody else is claiming 100 percent failure<br/>\n&gt; rates<br/>\n&gt; either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to be combative here, I&#39;m trying to figure out, with a<br/>\n&gt; little<br/>\n&gt; rigor, what&#39;s happening here, because simply bitching about it isn&#39;t going<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; get the problem fixed, if there is one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; Drawing is held each week through August 20.
