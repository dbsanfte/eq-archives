Sorry, here is the correct<br/>\nversion. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t[slinks away] <br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe petition should ask Verant to adopt an Open Disclosure <br/>\n<br/>\n\tPolicy which commits them to reveal ANY changes made to a <br/>\n<br/>\n\tclass which affects gameplay in the next patch message. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs we all know, Verant likes to &quot;stealth nerf&quot; classes and <br/>\n<br/>\n\tBards have probably been the biggest victim. Its basically <br/>\n<br/>\n\ta form of cowardice in that they dont want to take the heat <br/>\n<br/>\n\tfor their actions. However, as paying customers I think it <br/>\n<br/>\n\tis reasonable for us to have the right to know what is being <br/>\n<br/>\n\tdone to the characters we are paying to play and have invested <br/>\n<br/>\n\tso much time into. Although other classes would benefit <br/>\n<br/>\n\tfrom such an official disclosure policy, Bards have been the <br/>\n<br/>\n\thardest hit by this and as such it should be valid to include <br/>\n<br/>\n\tit in a Bard petition. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn a side note, Brad and Smedley are always noting how much <br/>\n<br/>\n\tthought and debate go into every change to a class. They claim<br/>\n<br/>\n\tto agonize over every issue and debate it among the developers. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tTherefore, it should not be very difficult for them to list these <br/>\n<br/>\n\tchanges since they should be well aware of them after so much<br/>\n<br/>\n\tdiscussion. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t <br/>\n<br/>\nBaraden of TM, Prexus, Rodcet, and Brell</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
