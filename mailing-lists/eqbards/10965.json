Mine come from the same town, it&#39;s highly likely they know eachother <br/>\nand may even be related!<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently the facts are there is not much to do for lvl 50&#39;s on a server <br/>\ncrowded with high levels so twinking is going to happen. Until Verant gets <br/>\noff their asses and stops nerfing the freakin game, and does something about <br/>\nit that&#39;s the way it&#39;s gonna be. There are many things we could do, but you <br/>\nknow what - on my server almost EVERY night those many things we could do <br/>\nare already being done by someone else. 80 people in Lower Guk average, 60 <br/>\npeople in Sol B, usually at least a group doing Kedge, and it&#39;s hard to get <br/>\nthe right people together for a planes raid so when those raids happen they <br/>\nhappen. Dragons pop once a week, FG&#39;s pop every 8 hours - BOTH life spans <br/>\nare a couple hours at most (no lie). We complain to Verant, and what do they <br/>\ndo? They add a bunch of rediculously high level mobs to Kith, screwing all <br/>\nthe low level travellers. Now you tell me what else is there to do. Please <br/>\ntell me now - thx info! Trust me, I have tried and tried lately to find <br/>\nsomething xp-gaining for Sart to do with NO luck. Maybe if Paw doesn&#39;t suck <br/>\nit may help a LITTLE, but it is not a very large place (comparatively). <br/>\nWe&#39;ll see how that turns out.<br/>\n<br/>\nPh34r my bad grammar! =P<br/>\n<br/>\njust my 2,000,000 plat..<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Quellious of the 50th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Twinking Causes a Crisis of Faith<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 1 Dec 1999 20:06:32 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Because your chars don&#39;t know each other from a hole in the ground. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t think twinking should be acceptable just because level 50 people <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;bored.  They should give the level 50 people something to do then. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you adventure and get an item you can&#39;t use.. give it to someone else.<br/>\n&gt;Trade it for something of an appropriate level that you CAN use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes this will not happen because Verant does not have a problem with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; twinking. If you adventure and get a item you can&#39;t use why shouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to make a new char and use it? That&#39;s what Verant said&#39;s and I <br/>\n&gt;happen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to agree because what else is there for a level 50 to do?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Naeeldar </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
