Ahh well we all have are<br/>\nopinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did find I like about your current post is you mentioned you<br/>\ncould be off bases kind of nice to not have somebody shove their opinion<br/>\ndown your throat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 9:31 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Plane of losses<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let me give an analogy to try to better explain what I was saying.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The only &quot;fear&quot; that exists in the Plane of Fear is what the players, not<br/>\n&gt;their characters, have in their own mind.  This &quot;fear&quot;, due to the current<br/>\n&gt;way the Plane of Fear works, is that 1) they will automatically die and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lose<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;hard earned experience and 2) most likely not be able to recover their<br/>\n&gt;corpse. Thats some bad mojo and rightfully so.  I agree something needs to<br/>\n&gt;be done about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now I will use myself as an example.  I&#39;m a 22d level bard.  Suppose I was<br/>\n&gt;considering camping the basement in Unrest or the castle in Mistmoore.  I<br/>\n&gt;use these places as examples because I would almost certainly die if I went<br/>\n&gt;to these locations.  My reservation about going to these places is for all<br/>\n&gt;practical purposes the same &quot;fear&quot; that the 46+ level players are having.<br/>\n&gt;The only difference is that I have a better chance of recovering my corpse.<br/>\n&gt;If my corpse is deep in the basement, I couldn&#39;t do it myself but I could<br/>\n&gt;get the assistance of someone much higher level than me to protect me while<br/>\n&gt;I was recovering my corpse.  46+ characters don&#39;t have the luxury of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>someone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;higher helping them retrieve their corpse so, IMO, thats the only<br/>\n </span></blockquote>difference<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;between me camping the basement in Unrest versus them camping the Plane of<br/>\n&gt;Fear.  You could argue that this luxury makes a world of difference and<br/>\n&gt;makes the entire analogy invalid.  I could be totally offbase here so take<br/>\n&gt;it with a grain of salt.  It does make for an interesting, allbeit<br/>\n&gt;off-topic, discussion:-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;IMO, the Plane of Fear, as well as all others, should have something<br/>\n </span></blockquote>magical<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;about them that takes into account that the Norrathian laws of physics and<br/>\n&gt;magic don&#39;t apply in the planes.  Thats pretty much how it works in most<br/>\n&gt;fantasy games I&#39;m aware of.  Verant even stated when the Fear plane opened<br/>\n&gt;up that magic worked different in there.  In order to do that, they need to<br/>\n&gt;add the magical fear, hate, etc. element (or something along the same line)<br/>\n&gt;I discussed in my original post.  Obviously if they were to do that, they<br/>\n&gt;would have to do some major tweaking of how the planes work.  Offensive<br/>\n&gt;capabilities of the mobs would need to be reduced to the point where, when<br/>\n&gt;combined with the ideas I proposed, a players chance of survival is<br/>\n&gt;near/equal that of what it was before the Plane of Fear was tweaked to the<br/>\n&gt;point of where it is now.  Bottom line is that characters should, with a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lot<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;skill, good planning, and a little luck, have the chance to go to the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Planes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(or anywhere for that matter) and afterwards sit around the campfire and<br/>\n&gt;celebrate their accomplishment.  Verant will get it fixed eventually (we<br/>\n </span></blockquote>all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;hope).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My brain hurts after this one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Heh what your suggesting would make the zones worse then it is now.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Believe<br/>\n&gt;&gt; me being thrown halfway across zone is enough don&#39;t need anything else<br/>\n&gt;&gt; like<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that added.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Just an idea, but perhaps Verant could reduce the toughness of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; combats<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;in the Planes so people have a better chance of survival but also make<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Planes somehow reflect what they are.  For example, in Fear, the players<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;magic resist rate gets periodically checked to see if they become<br/>\n </span></blockquote>scared.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt;Could be at anytime, in combat or while they are sitting around.

In Hate, make it where a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; player<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;can, if they fail their resist, become consumed by irrational hate and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; start<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;attacking anything nearby, monsters or players.
