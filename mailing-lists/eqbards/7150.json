I don&#39;t remember such great things existing in UO in its first 6<br/>\nmonths either so maybe you should give EQ more time to mature as a<br/>\ncommunity, not necessarily as a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Elijah Meeker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 24, 1999 2:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Adieu!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how much I am going to miss the bard class, the feeling of<br/>\nrunning around the countryside exploring, hunting (which is so much finer in<br/>\nEQ than UO, I mean duh).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my wife, of all people, pointed out that hearing about UO stories used<br/>\nto be great, the interactions, the intruiges, the plots the schemes, and<br/>\nthat largely hearing about EQ was boring. Killed this, killed that, got this<br/>\ngot that, had goofy fun with a small group of folks. Which is all fine, but<br/>\nnot very creative sounding. Then on the very same day friends from Siege<br/>\nPerilous start sending me emails out of the blue...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all the thrill of EQ hunting, visuals, for all the total rockingness of<br/>\nthe Bard class...I am left feeling like I am not creating what I want to be<br/>\ncreating in an online world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn UO I raised huge armies (more than anyone else actually) got whole shards<br/>\nin an uproar, wrote a lot of story, all without one bit of help from OSI.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now once again I am off to Siege Perilous, where have gathered some of<br/>\nthe best story people from all the shards. The Imperium, The Sinful, the<br/>\nTemple of Monadain, Shadowclan orcs, the Mordain sisters and more. I go not<br/>\nto revive Tengu the Summoner, but to reinvent him. (Heeee! I just HAD to say<br/>\nthat *laughs*).<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the old stinky interface the old stinky spawn, the old stinky combat<br/>\nsystem...all those I can live with, but I can&#39;t live without large scale<br/>\ncreative community. And all the biggies of large scale creative community<br/>\nare on SP. So off I go. It&#39;s been a total blast, I will miss the Bard class<br/>\nmost of all...<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep your lutes dry and your blade polished.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin a.k.a Tengu</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
