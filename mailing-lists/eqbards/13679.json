While it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; doable without an enchanter, I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;NEVER&quot; expect more than 2.  (Normally charm is good enough to<br/>\n&gt; control a 3-mob pull.  The problem with the DW gobs is that<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re all named &quot;deepwater goblin&quot; but some of them are<br/>\n&gt; casters.  If your group is fighting one gob and the two you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; charming turn out to be casters, you&#39;re going to be eating a<br/>\n&gt; lot of nukes in between charms.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Like I said, *ideally* you want an enchanter, healer, and<br/>\n&gt; someone who can cast harmony.  You can do it without the<br/>\n&gt; enchanter, but I found the fights to be much much easier (like<br/>\n&gt; zoning two times vs. only losing 0-2 bubbles) with an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed, but after fighting them for an hour, your puller will know right<br/>\naway BEFORE pulling if he/she is pulling a wizard, shaman or warrior DW<br/>\ngob... at least my wife could tell us ahead of time with about 95% accuracy.<br/>\nIf we got two, I always charmed the caster... which always was the last one<br/>\nout of the water since it was trying its hardest to nuke her.  We pulled 3 a<br/>\ncouple of times, but with charm it was never a problem.  So I still say the<br/>\nperfect group is a tank, druid and bard for this spawn point :-).  I&#39;d take<br/>\nanother healer rather then an enchanter in this scenario if given the<br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ve learned to time my charm so that I&#39;ve usually got it charmed<br/>\nBEFORE it gets its spell off which is nice because I get the &quot;A DW Gob tried<br/>\nto cast a spell on you but you were protected&quot; message.  I rarely failed<br/>\nsticking charm on the DW&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pull from Oasis, you need only to run to the inn.   The caster will come<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pulling to the inn makes it a bit harder to use fear.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, not REALLY to the inn.  Just to the edge of slope in front of the inn.<br/>\nif you fight them there, they will tend to run back and forth right on the<br/>\nslope rather then running away.  We never really got THAT close to the Inn<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, the area we found they do this in was also<br/>\n&gt; close enough to the water for the casters to nuke us while out<br/>\n&gt; of sight.  :(  We had enough tankage that I let them beat on<br/>\n&gt; us until they were at half health, then I chain-feared them<br/>\n&gt; while they stood in place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to handle this is to have your tank run clear past your party to the<br/>\ninn.  This pulls them out of the water about to the slope.  Then you, the<br/>\nbard, engages, the druid snares, you fear and the tank comes running back to<br/>\nget some licks in.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 40th song possibly retired<br/>\nPrexus </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
