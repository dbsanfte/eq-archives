There is a lot of fun out there.  Only when you join the quest for<br/>\nexp race and leet loots, remember to smell the roses too.  All you have to<br/>\ndo to get to level 50 is kill 1,210,314 moss snakes, skellies, aviaks,<br/>\npickclaws, froogs, kobolds, specs, etc, etc, etc.  It&#39;s a long haul but<br/>\neventually you get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You don&#39;t have to worry about me Sylly :)  Before EQ I was a avid mudder.<br/>\nPlayed for years!  On one mud the level structure was this: 50 mortal<br/>\nlevels, 999 hero levels, 999 lord levels.  At the time my pfile got messed<br/>\nup by the Imp and not reinstated correctly I had the highest mortal thief in<br/>\nthe game and also the highest mortal halfling in the game.  Level 200+ lord.<br/>\nI left that game almost two years ago now and the highest lords are about<br/>\nlevel 500...<br/>\n<br/>\nI RP where I can.  But no not everyone wants to RP.  I took a day - a whole<br/>\nday! - and walked around Antonica with a high level bard.  No Selos no run<br/>\njust walk.  And it was FUN! During the week most of my levleing is done<br/>\nbecause my play time is so different (Australia).  But the weekends I have<br/>\nmy fun...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
