But instead it was decided that the enchanter <br/>\n&gt; should get to keep<br/>\n&gt; the item and that I shouldn&#39;t get to roll for it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was really angry to be treated like this especially as we <br/>\n&gt; have just got a<br/>\n&gt; new charm song, the tranix crown would of been great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just thought I would post this here and see whether you <br/>\n&gt; guys and girls<br/>\n&gt; think I should of got to roll for this item?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Madagan Songweaver, Bard of 44.8 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; The information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\n&gt; intended for the addressee only.
