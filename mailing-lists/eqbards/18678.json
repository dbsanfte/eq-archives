We were fairly<br/>\nbeat up after fighting 3 giants in a row when we were suddenly faced with<br/>\nanother 2 at once.  The enchanter and I both got the same idea, and about 10<br/>\nseconds later both got the message, &quot;that&#39;s not a legal target master&quot; as we<br/>\nhad our new pets try to attack one another.  The charms gave us a little<br/>\ntime to rest after which I let my giant go and we watched the two rumble.<br/>\nVery amusing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting to read all the comments.  I have to admit to never seeing<br/>\nthis before, even when I used charm all night one time in Solusek.  I<br/>\njust imagined it was another little unusual thing with Dreadlands/<br/>\nKunark, along with the random faction changes and the way mobs seem to<br/>\nignore the puller and everyone else and focus on one party member for<br/>\nno obvious reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;ll try out a number of commands and be more wary in future.<br/>\nEven if we can just take 1 mob out of the fight it&#39;s a help, never<br/>\nmind if it isn&#39;t attacking and killing the others alongside us! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again all!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
