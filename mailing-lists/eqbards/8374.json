More often you see how much fun EQ is<br/>\nwith a lightened server load.  TZ and VZ cap out around 1000 - IMHO what I<br/>\nthink should be the Verant&#39;s goal of keeping server populations.  Now if<br/>\nonly they would admit it... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCase and point: in Oasis there were 35 people.  It rocked, and it was all<br/>\nthe better when someone was attempted to kite specs got rooted by another<br/>\nplayer.  For those of you who haven&#39;t enjoyed the &quot;specs to beach&quot; cries,<br/>\nperhaps this isn&#39;t quite as meaningful, but to those of us who have... I was<br/>\ngrinning ear to ear in RL. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo give it a shot if you&#39;re bored (or try the test server, its around<br/>\n300-450), its honestly a lot more fun that the congested 1400-1600<br/>\npopulations you see almost NIGHTLY now and I cringe to think what this<br/>\nweekend will bring.  Now all that being said, I&#39;m a hypocrite too - I play<br/>\nmy &quot;main&quot; chars on Veeshan.  Scroll to the bottom of the list when you sort<br/>\nservers by number, you&#39;ll see it. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n--More work to follow this weekend on song stacking.  Again if anyone wants<br/>\nto help contribute you can find a zip excel file at<br/>\nwww.erols.com/gww6e/stacked-songs.zip<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun,<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Sicarius&Scummy@Veeshan&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
