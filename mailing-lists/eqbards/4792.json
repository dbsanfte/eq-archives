If you<br/>\nbought a winmodem because it was cheaper, you may want to go<br/>\nbuy a real modem.  Winmodems use the computer&#39;s CPU for the<br/>\nanalog-to-digital and vice versa conversions.  That leaves<br/>\nfewer CPU cycles for the game graphics, and it introduces<br/>\nabout 100-200 ms of lag.  Both of these will kill your ability<br/>\nto switch songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I noticed is that oddly enough, with a Voodoo3<br/>\ncard, the refresh rate is faster using DirectX than using<br/>\nglide.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
