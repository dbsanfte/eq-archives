We had a great leader for our raid (I&#39;m not talking about me, <br/>\nhehe) and everyone thankfully listened and did their job (after <br/>\naggroing about 6 IG&#39;s at the beginning).<br/>\n<br/>\nBard Trak is identical in Level, Str, and Abilities as the normal <br/>\nTrak, but he is not buffed by Jumpy, which makes him easier to kill.  <br/>\nHe drops 1 Kunark BP and the Trak Guts.  No other loot, not even <br/>\nspells when we killed him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else asked about Phin still being a gimp... Phin can be <br/>\nsingle pulled to the ledge by a Level 60, so he&#39;s just a little more <br/>\nwork (having to swim to his lair) than before the change... It&#39;s <br/>\nprobably faster to swim to him, pull him and swim/gate out than it <br/>\nwas to get the eye thing to work anyway. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In eqbards@y..., Rebecca Small &lt;rsmall@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; As to keeping vox from Ch&#39;ing, our theory is to have all the tanks <br/>\non the same side to cause her to move.
