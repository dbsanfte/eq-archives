Then I tried using it<br/>\nsome (DDD) and like all &#39;immature&#39; songs (ones you just got cuz u just<br/>\nleveled) it was not the uber song I was expecting.  And then I pretty much<br/>\nwent back to my old standards.  And in the course of things, my brass skills<br/>\n- although listed as &#39;master&#39; in my stats - fell behind my levels.  I was<br/>\nwondering why screetch with horn was so crappy and it dawned on me that like<br/>\nmy 1HS, 1HB & Piercing, I need to max brass every level or so to keep it<br/>\nmaxed.  My singing and string and percussion get maxed in my normal<br/>\nfighting, etc. I prolly have slacked on wind as I don&#39;t invis much any more<br/>\n- at least not like I used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo two points:  Yes - lower level songs seem to get stronger as you go up -<br/>\neven to me at 36.  And max those skills every level - brass was one I let<br/>\nslip and that&#39;s prolly why some brass stuff seemed so crappy when I tried<br/>\nit. (A brass song with crappy brass skill obviously gets resisted more that<br/>\na string song with good string skill - duh!  And the CoD being more &#39;mature&#39;<br/>\nthan DDD adds to situation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 36th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. so the jig song saved you about 30 seconds over the course of 5 minutes<br/>\nof med time.  And then you waited another 13 minutes for the spawn.  But you<br/>\nwere ready just in case!  But if it makes em feel good and you don&#39;t have<br/>\nthe level 32 song - do it!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tBard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tSunday, November 21, 1999 4:26 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] CoD and DDD damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIn my camping of the Icy Greaves last week, and last night&#39;s<br/>\ngrouping in Kith, taking out high-level undead (the lowest thing con&#39;d gold<br/>\nto me at 28) I have noticed that although DDD may be more powerful, CoD will<br/>\nbe resisited by higher level creatures MUCH less often.
