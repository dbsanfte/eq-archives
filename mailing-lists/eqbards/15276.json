A bard there<br/>\n&gt; claimed to have used Lullaby with great success in Runnyeye.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyways, my new theory is that somewhere in the resist check<br/>\n&gt; when GZ should&#39;ve used the mob&#39;s level, he accidently used the<br/>\n&gt; bard&#39;s level.  So if you (the bard) are relatively low level,<br/>\n&gt; the song works reasonably well against even con mobs.  But if<br/>\n&gt; you are high level, the minimum resist rate is that of a high<br/>\n&gt; level mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop the web for great deals.
