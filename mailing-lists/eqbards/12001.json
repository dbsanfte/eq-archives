As we&#39;ve discussed<br/>\nhere, mobs have a &quot;give up&quot; radius.  If you&#39;re outside this<br/>\nradius, they will quit chasing you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your puller goes in, sometimes he can activate mobs that<br/>\ndon&#39;t follow him out.  Unrest used to be pretty bad with mobs<br/>\nthat got stuck, but I think Verant has fixed most of those.  <br/>\nStill, it&#39;s possible that there are still some mobs with this<br/>\nproblem.  Another possibility is that your puller is<br/>\naccidently activating a mob, but because of the mob&#39;s pathing,<br/>\nhe is running out of the mob&#39;s &quot;give up&quot; radius before he<br/>\nreaches your group with the real pull.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he gets back to your group, these extra mobs are not<br/>\nchasing him, but are still aggressive towards him.  In your<br/>\nfight, you play a song, and blammo - you&#39;re now on their aggro<br/>\nlists as well.  In fact, they&#39;re only mad at him because they<br/>\nsaw him.  You are buffing and healing him, so you end up<br/>\nhigher on their hate lists than he.  But since both of you<br/>\nare outside their &quot;give up&quot; radius, they don&#39;t come after you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour puller goes in, gets these mobs (or any mobs that were<br/>\n&quot;told&quot; about you by the stuck mob).  He is inside their &quot;give<br/>\nup&quot; radius but you are not, so they chase him.  He pulls them<br/>\nto your group.  Eventually, both you and he are inside their<br/>\n&quot;give up&quot; radius, but you are tops on their hate list.  So<br/>\nthey all go after you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s not much you can do to stop this - if anyone in your<br/>\ngroup is on any hate list, the instant you play a song that<br/>\nhelps them, you&#39;re on the hate list too.  When grouped, the<br/>\nbard has to act as if he inherited the worst faction and the<br/>\nworst hate of anyone in the group, because that&#39;s the way the<br/>\ngame treats him.  When I played in Unrest, every time I got<br/>\nthe inkling something like this was starting, I had my whole<br/>\ngroup zone out and back in to clear any hate lists (took a<br/>\nhalf dozen deaths before my guild believed me - fortunately<br/>\nthe clerics vouched for me, since they run into this problem<br/>\ntoo to a lesser degree).  Or you can do the pulling (which<br/>\ninsures any hate lists you get on are entirely your own<br/>\ndoing).  Fortunately, the problem is mostly limited to zones<br/>\nwhere mobs can get stuck or lost (or your pull is stolen).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s worse is when another group starts a train that<br/>\nincludes one of these mobs.  They zone or die, and the mob<br/>\nthat hates you tells all the others, &quot;Awww, they got away.  <br/>\nBut hey, there&#39;s this nice juicy bard who&#39;s been causing<br/>\ntrouble lately...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
