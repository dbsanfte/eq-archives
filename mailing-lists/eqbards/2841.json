To change instruments--right click on backpack in the bottom left slot---backpack opens--change instruments.  I think this is more or less how most bards are doing it.

I just lost a fine steel spear,<br/>\n&gt; which I spent most of my bank account on (money isn&#39;t exactly prolific<br/>\n&gt; at level 8).  Tried to shout and see if someone would return it, but<br/>\n&gt; alas to no avail.  Yes I&#39;m using the inventory-as-hotkey method.  I<br/>\n&gt; have no problem juggling 2-3 songs, but trying to switch instruments<br/>\n&gt; is a serious PITA with the risk of dropping something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Warren, aka Erol of Cazic-Thule </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
