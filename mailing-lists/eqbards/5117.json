I also had that<br/>\nproblem you speak of with the Brass based songs, thats what I think this<br/>\npatch &quot;fixed&quot;, unfortunately it nerfed all the songs now, thus the missed<br/>\nnotes on songs I learned 30 levels ago. Prior to this patch missing a note<br/>\non even the level 23 song was unheard of, let alone Selo. With a class that<br/>\nrequires the twisting of songs during battle I am sure we are dying from<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 09, 1999 12:27 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Charisma effect on magic resists<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You must need incredible Dex then because my base is 124 and with a Shaman<br/>\n&gt; buff it is 161, I still miss alot of notes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This could well be.  I don&#39;t claim to be absolutely correct on this, but I<br/>\nthink dexterity also has more face validity than charisma does when it comes<br/>\nto<br/>\nwhether you miss a note.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso note that the frequency of missed notes depends on how long you have<br/>\nhad<br/>\nthe song in question.  When I first tried playing chords of dissonance with<br/>\na<br/>\nhorn, the missed notes were just unbelievable.  I was like a junior high<br/>\nschool<br/>\nband.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist now brings ICQ Instant Messaging to members<br/>\nFor details, <br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
