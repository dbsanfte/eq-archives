Please understand that the Test Server is<br/>\njust that... a place where we can TEST ideas we have. It absolutely does NOT<br/>\nmean that the changes seen there will make there way onto the Live Servers.<br/>\nSometimes we need to try new things to see what works and what doesn&#39;t to<br/>\nsolve particular problems. Brad will cover this topic more in his Producer&#39;s<br/>\nLetter. <br/>\nJohn Smedley <br/>\n<br/>\n-Aurum @ 10:46 AM PT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
