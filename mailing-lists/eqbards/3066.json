It&#39;s his baby, his brainchild, his labor of love.<br/>\nEveryone else of course feels the same way, but Brad is the man truly<br/>\nresponsible for this game&#39;s creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, while he can do anything he wants in the game, pretty much, he<br/>\ngenerally doesn&#39;t.  He has regular anonymous play characters on several<br/>\nservers,  much like the rest of us, and plays regularly.  You may have<br/>\ngrouped with him and never known it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe only dusts off and puts on his Aradune persona when he&#39;s acting in an<br/>\nofficial capacity, or in the singular case of Vox&#39;s demise, when he wanted<br/>\nto join in on some fun.  A lot of folks gave him flack for that, but his<br/>\npresence didn&#39;t effect the Vox&#39;s fate.  She was doomed from the start.  Oh,<br/>\nand Aradune is a Ranger, not a Paladin.  Don&#39;t let the green plate mail<br/>\nthrow you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, this is off-topic to this thread, but in response to someone who felt<br/>\n&#39;twisting&#39; (BTW, 10 free brownie points if you can point me to the person<br/>\nthat coined that term...and an evil and painful death for him..I really<br/>\ndislike it) was an exploit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCycling bard songs is part of what bards do, it&#39;s a feature, and all the<br/>\nsong designs reflect that ability.  If any one song was more than a cantrip<br/>\nin power, it&#39;d be a different issue, but that&#39;s not the case.  Bard songs on<br/>\nthe whole are very mild in effect, singularly and per verse, but potent<br/>\ncombined and over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the way it should be, and any bard who is not &#39;twisting&#39;, has failed<br/>\nto realize the potential of the class.  It&#39;d be the same as playing a<br/>\nwarrior who doesn&#39;t use weapons, a wizard who never memorizes spells, a<br/>\nranger that doesn&#39;t track, a shadowknight that doesn&#39;t harm touch, a mage<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t use pets, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Fun Bob &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 08, 1999 12:23 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Two of the same weapon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Fun Bob&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun-bob@...\">fun-bob@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kinda, except Aradune (Bard) Can do anything he damn well wants, while JM<br/>\n&gt; can just spew usefull info at us degenerates<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Codo the Mysterious &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:codo@...\">codo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 7:16 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Two of the same weapon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Codo the Mysterious&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:codo@...\">codo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If there is only one of these - some power-gamer named aradune has it!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Bard of the 13th level<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a.k.a.
