I chose agnostic for many reasons, i find<br/>\ni am more accepted in different towns because of this, not much but still it<br/>\nhelps. I like the idea of deity specific stuff but i *hope* that they will<br/>\nnot favor certain deities and have deity specific stuff for each deity as<br/>\nwell as unholy items for us agnostics.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy worship. This reminds me of an old pun advertisement i read somewhere...<br/>\n<br/>\nhonda in the 70&#39;s had an add that was something like :<br/>\nfollow us we&#39;re riding hondas<br/>\n<br/>\nthen a mile down the road harley had an add:<br/>\nRide a harley, don&#39;t follow anyone...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt says it all, i know i&#39;ve gone off topic abit but i personally don&#39;t like<br/>\nfollowing something i&#39;ve never seen... Why put my faith into something that<br/>\ndoes not manifest its presence in the world? While all you worshippers are<br/>\nspending time in the temples worshipping a god that somewhere someone is<br/>\ncamping, i&#39;ll be having a beer at the tavern with my friends 8)  When ya<br/>\nthink about it, why are people worshipping a god? gods are gods, they cant<br/>\nbe killed by a group of people, doesnt make sense in my book.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and ya some of the gods do have a presence in the world... but think<br/>\nabout it, my necro follows innoruk, and i have to kill my god to get the pet<br/>\nenhancing book. I guess i&#39;m agnostic after all.  Either that or when i go<br/>\nbuy my next coffin in innoruk&#39;s temple i&#39;ll probably burn up on entry or<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nRakka 49 necro follower of Innoruk *cough*<br/>\nMinkin 36 bard Agnostic<br/>\nTanqueray 6 warrior Agnostic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tMike Roach [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tTuesday, April 11, 2000 3:51 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] Patch Message  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is it just me or does this part concern anyone a bit:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity.
