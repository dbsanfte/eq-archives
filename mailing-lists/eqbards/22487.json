First, if you have LiveWare 3 installed (if you&#39;re running an SB Live card, you need to install this ;), make sure EAX sound effects are off.  To do so, goto the Surround Mixer, then choose &quot;Speaker&quot;.  Select the speaker type you&#39;re trying to use (for some reason 4 speakers isn&#39;t working right in EQ, I&#39;m using &quot;Live! Surround&quot; mode, or use 2 speaker if you don&#39;t have a surround set of speakers  [and if you change between speakers and headphones regularly, get used to using this mixer...it&#39;s great for that]), then up at the &quot;Task&quot; box, select &quot;(Custom)&quot;, then immediately select &quot;(No Effects)&quot; on the next box.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the first step...next step is open up your Sounds and Multimedia properties box (instructions are for Win2k, it&#39;s almost exactly alike for Win9x though)...click on &quot;Start&quot;, then &quot;Settings&quot;, then &quot;Control Panel&quot;, then &quot;Sounds and Multimedia&quot;.  Next click on the &quot;Audio&quot; tab then click on the &quot;Advanced&quot; button.  Click on the &quot;Performance&quot; tab, then set the &quot;Hardward Acceleration&quot; slider, one notch left of &quot;Full&quot; (to 3/4).  This will also fix the screens locking up for a split second while in game.  Click &quot;apply&quot;, the &quot;ok&quot; then &quot;ok&quot;.  (NOTE: Everyone should do this, whether or not you&#39;re using SBLive!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn-game (heh, finally :), set your Sound Realism down a notch or two, then you might move your music down to about half-way (it is sometimes too loud).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the above fixes I did and tested last night...it&#39;ll return your sound to a semblence of normal (your sounds are a little loud, but you can hear monsters, etc).  I have also noticed that while casting (or singing), the sounds seem to be a bit muted...which means all the time for us.  I&#39;ve also noticed that the EQ sound engine is having trouble appropriately adjusting the volumes of the sounds for distance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, for untested fixes...I found this fix this morning while surfing for more fixes...haven&#39;t tested it (will be able to on Sat, and fix it if it doesn&#39;t work), but I think it&#39;ll partially help.  This fix is also just for SBLive! folks (it fixes too much &quot;reverb&quot; in the game):<br/>\n<br/>\n1)\tOpen up your Creative Launcher (top of the screen if you have it running...the annoying little grey line).  Goto the &quot;Audio HQ&quot; tab.  Select the &quot;Environmental Audio&quot; button.  In the &quot;Environment&quot; box, select &quot;(No Effects)&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2)\tOn the &quot;Master&quot; page (default screen), click on the &quot;All Effects Off&quot; button.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3)\tOn the &quot;Source&quot; tab, select &quot;Wave/DirectSound&quot;, then click on &quot;Chorus&quot; and move the &quot;Chorus Amount&quot; slider to 0% (all the way left).  Do the same to the &quot;Reverb&quot; option.  Leave the &quot;Original Sound&quot; at 100%.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)\tGoto the &quot;Options&quot; tab, make sure the Device is the SB Live value, then make sure the &quot;Always save changes automatically&quot; checkbox is checked.<br/>\n<br/>\n5)\tClick &quot;close&quot;...if it asks you for a name to save it as, just type in &quot;EQ&quot;...this way it&#39;ll save your settings so you can move back to it from a different game.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust remember...I haven&#39;t tested the above settings...if they don&#39;t work, just reset your effects in the Surround Mixer to &quot;(Custom)&quot; and &quot;(None)&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Khelan, Bard of 42 tweaks, lost at Work</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
