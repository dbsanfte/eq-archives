I am a wimpy bard in regards to STR, with<br/>\nmine barely being over 100.  If I didn&#39;t have some weight reducing bags, I<br/>\ncould never loot FS weapons to sell for cash without exceeding my weight<br/>\ncapacity.  If I switched to the SS arms, not only would I lose the STR bonus<br/>\nfor the SotA, but the extra weight from the SS arms would make my situation<br/>\neven worse.  So guess I will stick with SotA for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 22, 2001 10:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] SS Arms vs Sleeve of the Ancient<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really depends on your bard.  are you hurting for strength?  the 6ac by<br/>\nitself<br/>\nis really negligible and you won&#39;t notice the difference.  that dar knight<br/>\nin sebilis<br/>\nwon&#39;t all of a sudden start hitting you for 90 instead of 110, for example,<br/>\nheh.<br/>\nbut the singing steel will weigh more, so if you have a low base strength,<br/>\nyou may<br/>\nnot be able to go full singing steel.  i put all my spare points in the<br/>\nbeginning into<br/>\nstrength because i knew in the teens/20&#39;s i&#39;d need it for bronze armor.<br/>\nlambent and<br/>\nimbrued isn&#39;t too heavy, but then singing steel is pretty weighty again.  so<br/>\nit worked<br/>\nout pretty good.  i&#39;ve got full singing steel except for hero bracer and<br/>\nebbp and i run<br/>\ninto weight problems every now and then even with an abukar box.<br/>\n<br/>\non the other hand, 2k is just plat, and easily replaceable.  just go farm<br/>\nunrest<br/>\nor cazic or lower guk for fine steel weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:40 AM 1/22/01 -1000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I currently have SotA but someone offered to sell me SS arms for 2K over<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;weekend.
