As a wood elf, I have infravision so can<br/>\nnormally see fine at night.  However, whenever I activate the DE illusion,<br/>\nI&#39;m blind as a bat (i.e. I lose infravision and don&#39;t gain ultravision).  I<br/>\nhave had shamans buff me with the Ultravision spell and I have also had<br/>\nmagicians give me a Coldstone to equip so I know what Ultravision is<br/>\nsupposed to look like.  The difference at night when I have either of these<br/>\ntwo buffs versus the vision I have with the DE illusion is literally the<br/>\ndifference between night and day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is the Mask of Deception supposed to also give you ultravision?  I have<br/>\ntalked with enchanters who regularly cast the DE illusion spell on<br/>\nthemselves so they can see at night.  Is it possible that this component of<br/>\nthe Mask of Deception is broken?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
