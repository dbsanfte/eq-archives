Lets assume after they code the fix equipping a drum <br/>\n&gt; &gt;will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now increase the damage of the DOT and the amount of magic resistance the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mobs loses.  I think we should remind them to remember the MM battle drum<br/>\n&gt; &gt;when they code the fix.  Singing Furfil&#39;s with the MM battle drum<br/>\n&gt; equipped<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should increase the DOT and magic resistance amount 20% (I think thats<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;everyone says it increases resist songs by) more than with a normal drum<br/>\n&gt; &gt;equipped.  Based on their track record, if we don&#39;t remind them they will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;probably forget about including the MM battle drum as part of the patch.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The percussion<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aspect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces no additional<br/>\n&gt; effect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(damage or resistance debuff).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***GZ SAYS***<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm - don&#39;t use that one much.
