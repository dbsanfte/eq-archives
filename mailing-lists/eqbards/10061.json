What gives you the right to judge me?  (Martyn)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    My comment stands.  However, I apologize for the seemingly lack of<br/>\n&gt;   respect, but you&#39;ve got to realize I&#39;ve played this game<br/>\n&gt;   as a bard longer than you have -- and I hear all the L20 bards<br/>\n&gt;   complaining because the Lambent quests are too hard.  The fact<br/>\n&gt;   that they think they should get Lambent because they are something<br/>\n&gt;   special, irritates me.  I worked really hard for my armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic, Mister Know it All, Bard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Despite the sniping, you&#39;re both expressing frustration over the same thing:  you are both seeing<br/>\nplayers wearing Lambent armor at levels below those intended by the game design, and neither of<br/>\nyou like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the risk of sounding like my (&quot;when I was a boy&quot;) father:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was around level 20, tiring of wearing patchwork leather, found-ringmail and a few pieces<br/>\nof ultra-expensive banded (the four Master Smiths on my server had a price-fixing cartel), I<br/>\ncalculated that a full set of Banded Armor would cost me about as much as it would to become a<br/>\nSmith, so I made a set for myself.  That was my first sweeping armor upgrade since cloth at level<br/>\n4 and patchwork at level 8.  (I&#39;m a tailor, too.)  I am now level 33, and I do not own a single<br/>\npiece of Lambent.  I intend to start questing for some next weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are not a twinked character, and you are level 22, you cannot expect to have Lambent Armor<br/>\nunless you have at least a few high-level friends.  This is irritating, sure.  (At level 33, I<br/>\nget pretty irritated seeing players in their teens with better armor/weapons than I have, and I<br/>\nhave some pretty good ones, due to some friends semi-twinking me while I was in my 20s.)  But the<br/>\nfact is that you are playing the game as designed.  If it makes you unhappy, there are things you<br/>\ncan do about it (joining a Guild comes to mind).<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t, though, you should take some solace and some pride in the fact that you are making<br/>\nyour way through this game the way it was intended, by earning things for yourself at the level<br/>\nat which they are appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not that you &quot;don&#39;t deserve it&quot;; it&#39;s that the other players you&#39;re looking at haven&#39;t<br/>\nearned it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 33 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
