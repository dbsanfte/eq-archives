I&#39;ve had this song for several levels<br/>\nnow and just simply can&#39;t figure out the proper method of using it.  I see<br/>\nmessages from some of the talented bards on this list saying &quot;Yeah, two Hill<br/>\nGiants, no biggie.  I just charmed them against one another and got both<br/>\nkills.&quot;  I would be dead or zonign within 15 rounds if I tried this.  At<br/>\nlevel 31 HGs are still red to me, so let&#39;s take the Choon and Froon brothers<br/>\nas examples because they&#39;re blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how I think it should work (remember, my base INT is only 75):<br/>\n<br/>\n- Set up a hotkey panel with Selo&#39;s, Charm, &quot;/pet attack&quot;, &quot;/pet back off&quot;.<br/>\n- Equip drum and fire up Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n- Sneak up to the bros and Charm one.<br/>\n- Assuming Charm sticks, the other will probably immediately attack it due<br/>\nto its inheriting my factions, but if not, click on the other brother and<br/>\nhit &quot;/pet attack&quot; hotkey.<br/>\n- Click on original charmee.<br/>\n- Start Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n- Watch ensuing battle.<br/>\n- When Charm breaks and brother runs toward me, hit Charm again.<br/>\n- Assuming Charm sticks, the charmee *should* return to previous &quot;/pet<br/>\nattack&quot; status.<br/>\n- Repeat until one is dead.<br/>\n- Once one is dead, the problem shifts to a kite or chain/fear issue to<br/>\nfinish survivor off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried this.  Hell I can&#39;t even make this work with Orc Centurians in<br/>\nEast Commonlands.  Either I totally misunderstand something or I&#39;m just not<br/>\ncoordinated to pull it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
