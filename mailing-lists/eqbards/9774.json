I have several pieces of Lambent now and have hunted for all<br/>\nbut one of the stones.  The one stone that I did purchase I purchased<br/>\nbecause it was getting late and the HGs were being stingy with the Lambents.<br/>\nI wanted the gauntlets before I logged, so when I saw someone auctioning one<br/>\nfor 25 I went ahead and bought it because I needed to be civil at work the<br/>\nnext day ;)  If it hadn&#39;t been late I would&#39;ve either dickered them down,<br/>\nwaited for one at 20pp, or gotten one myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 31st song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; John,<br/>\n&gt; With all due respect, this is why some jerks ask 100+pp for<br/>\n&gt; Lambent stones-I<br/>\n&gt; paid 10pp for a Lambent, the other 2 I have gotten so far were<br/>\n&gt; given to me.<br/>\n&gt; I refuse to pay more than 20, but when other bards pay 50, 60, or more for<br/>\n&gt; one it makes it harder to get the message across.<br/>\n&gt; My advice to you would be to be patient, you will find them for<br/>\n&gt; 20 pp, or I<br/>\n&gt; believe there are enough kind souls who will /shout looting rights to one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Scanna Swiftsinger<br/>\n&gt; Level 30 (and sick of it)<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I payed 60pp for a Lambent stone last night (was asking 100pp),<br/>\n&gt; I also got<br/>\n&gt; &gt;myself 2 sapphires and now all I need is the rune from Choon in<br/>\n&gt; WK. Anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know hard this is to get, bearing in mind I am only level 27. My friend<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will help me kill him (level 28 Mage) so I think we could take him, can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;anyone tell me how hard Choon is to locate??<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Madagan, Bard of 27 songs - Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
