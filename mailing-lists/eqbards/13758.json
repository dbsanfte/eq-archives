I have &quot;sense heading&quot;<br/>\nstacked with &quot;move forward&quot; and &quot;move back.&quot; Every time I start to move I<br/>\nget a sense heading. At first (level 3), I wanted to get the skill maxed as<br/>\nsoon as possible.  Now it&#39;s just &#39;natural&#39; for me to keep tabs on which way<br/>\nI am going.  Heh, and I still get lost real easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I did not die immediately, I started to &quot;look around&quot; inside the lair.<br/>\nProlly, a good idea for guilds who are thinking about doing a dragon - find<br/>\nout when one is killed and go in while most of the bad stuff is still down<br/>\n(6 and 8 hour spawns on giants) and get acquainted with the territory. Then<br/>\ncome back for Ice/Fire Giant &#39;practice&#39; when the dragons are still dead.<br/>\nThen when you know that you can clear to the lair, try again and learn how<br/>\nto not agro the dragon on your last pulls.  My guild has done all this but I<br/>\nam a recent addition so this was my first time this deep in the lair.  Vox<br/>\nlair has the additional perks of the pit traps so getting there can be fun<br/>\neven when the dragon is dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 10:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OMG!
