I tested as a 10th level warrior with an offense and 1hb of 10<br/>\nand hit considerably more often on the same mobs as a 3rd level warrior with<br/>\nthose same skill levels.  And yes getting a warrior to 10th level without<br/>\nraising his offense skill was a pain in the keister.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rolaleil LeLandont [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rolaleil@...\">rolaleil@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 01, 2000 2:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Giant Grub Digger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy just gave me a Giant Grub Digger (12dam/47dly, +20HP, +5 <br/>\nSVDisease), *2HS* weapon that can be wielded by bards!  Now, last <br/>\ntime I visited the Bard Guild, my trainer didn&#39;t offer me 2hs as a <br/>\nskill, and I&#39;ve always heard that 2HS is not available to bards <br/>\nanyway, YET I can and have wielded this thing!  In truth, using this <br/>\nis not as effective as my Drachnid Leg Tip, but I think it&#39;s because <br/>\nBards are NOT ABLE to increase their 2HS skill.  Also, the only time <br/>\nI do any REAL damage (25-28 per hit!) is when I&#39;m whistling the war <br/>\nsong, otherwise I rarely hit above 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any information on this?  Have any bards been able <br/>\nto establish and improve a 2HS skill?  If so, bards just got a GREAT <br/>\nsoloing weapon!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rolaleil<br/>\nBard of the 15th Song<br/>\nE&#39;ci Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAccurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/10/_/451022/_/959890042/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/10/_/451022/_/959890042/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
