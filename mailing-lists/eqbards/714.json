I think that<br/>\nleft me with Strength of 80, Agility of 75, Int 75 and Wis 75.  I did get beat<br/>\nup a lot at lower levels until I got decent armor.  That and not seeing in the<br/>\ndark is the downside.  The big upside is GREAT prices and excellent song<br/>\nreliability.  I will never play a human again, but I am very happy with a high<br/>\ncharisma Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide note on Charisma&#39;s effects on prices:  With a 100 Charisma I see about a<br/>\n10% price difference on cheap things (under a plat) as compared to a Human with<br/>\n75 charisma.  However, for expensive items (over 10 plat) I see as much as a 20%<br/>\ndifference in prices.  The bonus is clearly not linear.  I am anxious to see if<br/>\nI will get a 30 or 40% bonus on items greater than 100 pp, but cashflow<br/>\nconstraints postpone the test for another day.  I am sure one of you<br/>\nnumber-cruncher types will have some graphs or equations for us by the end of<br/>\nthe week&lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
