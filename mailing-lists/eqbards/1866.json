HUGE.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d disagree with this.  If you&#39;re using different speed<br/>\n&gt;weapons, the dual wield check seems to be asynchronous with<br/>\n&gt;your primary weapon.  I&#39;ve watched several times as my<br/>\n&gt;off-hand would swing, pause, primary, pause, off-hand, pause,<br/>\n&gt;primary, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If this is correct and the dual wield check is made every<br/>\n&gt;swing cycle of the off-hand weapon, then the weapon speed does<br/>\n&gt;not matter.  If your dual wield goes off 30% of the time, then<br/>\n&gt;it will increase your damage 30% regardless of what the weapon<br/>\n&gt;speed is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Most* of the times dual-wield succeeds it seems to be<br/>\n&gt;sychronized, so there may be more to it.  Perhaps it only goes<br/>\n&gt;asynchronous after a successful dual wield, and after a<br/>\n&gt;failure the next check is synchronous with your primary hand?<br/>\n&gt;That seems a rather convoluted way to program it; but if<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s the case, then Mr. Capozzi is correct, although the<br/>\n&gt;increase in damage is not quite HUGE :-), and this advantage<br/>\n&gt;becomes less the better you get at dual wield.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
