A caster will<br/>\nalways need mana to kill anything.  A melee with enough twinked armor<br/>\nand a super weapon can kill a camain with a bubble of hp.  A twinked<br/>\nmelee with a lot of cash can pay someone to walk behind him and heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to superpower level is to get damage shields from high levels<br/>\non you.  24 damage each time you get hit... stuff dies fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, ... usually you do not power level off a random spawn very well.<br/>\nCaiman are random spawns... ickie.  Better to find an NPC with a very <br/>\nquick spawn rate in your level range.  Stuff like the dwarves or elves<br/>\nin OOT are favorites for necro&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Dark&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Quite credible.

I was the lowest at 31st level.  We only had five people in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;group so when a 34 necro shouted he wanted to join a party I told him we<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a spot.  When the necro joined the party, he told us that that he had<br/>\n&gt; almost<br/>\n&gt; &gt;no experience fighting in groups before.  He stated that he had soloed all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the way from 1st level to 34th level and only had 10 days played time.  He<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stated that only now since he was at 34th did he find it necessary to join<br/>\n&gt; &gt;groups to get good EXP.  I have heard that necros were the best at soloing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;so I had trouble believing what he said.  I am 31st level with 29 days<br/>\n&gt; &gt;played time.  A friend of mine is a 36 enchanter with 50 days played time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Someone in the party asked him if he had friends that helped him powerlevel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to 34th.  He said that he had done it all by himself and that he just knew<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the right places to camp.  Does this sound credible that a necro can solo<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;34th in only 10 days played time?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
