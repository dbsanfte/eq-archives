Well when retail first came out I started<br/>\nup a monk on Tarew Marr and played him up about 15 levels. He was really<br/>\ncool and all, but nothing special.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I found out my guild from another game had started up on Bertox so I moved<br/>\n&gt; there, and rolled up the one character class I had never really had much<br/>\n&gt; contact with on Tarew Marr - the bard.  I gotta admit the one single thing<br/>\n&gt; about bards at the time that intrigued me was their speed and health<br/>\n&gt; regen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Back at the beginning of retail there were alot of unknowns..we didnt<br/>\n&gt; really have a clue what songs we got above lvl 20.  I had to discover how<br/>\n&gt; to use lullaby (and oh my did that song rock the world back then), chains<br/>\n&gt; was a godsend when I got it...charm was amazing...all these things I<br/>\n&gt; discovered on my own and with the help of this list...but why did I start<br/>\n&gt; a bard? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; SPEED!  .... do I have it now? Nope...I plod along like a crippled<br/>\n&gt; red-headed stepchild and will never take bard speed for granted again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lago Bardoon of Bertox<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 54 Minstrel<br/>\n&gt; Guild Leader, Defenders of Aleria </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
