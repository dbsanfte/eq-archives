I went to CB but the orc&#39;s hit so hard that it<br/>\nkeeps<br/>\n&gt; disrupting my song.  I died 5 times in there.  I went to Nro and all the<br/>\n&gt; places has been camp out.  I was wondering if anyone know a good place to<br/>\n&gt; solo at lvl 12.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanx,<br/>\n&gt; Your Friendly Rogue and Bard,<br/>\n&gt; Hammerpaw and Samiam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Make it count!
