On Thursday mornings patch, Verant gave<br/>\nNag and Vox a new ability to AE Dispel Magic. I am a Level 50 Bard by the<br/>\nname of Downs on Tribunal, my guild The Elitists and our Sister guild The<br/>\nVagrants attempted to kill both dragons after the patch. Well, Lady Vox fell<br/>\nfine but after a failed attempt at Lord Nag we had some key members in need<br/>\nof sleep due to it being a weekday (yes, we got started a little late in the<br/>\nevening). <br/>\n<br/>\n\tI was just commenting on this fact so that others know what to<br/>\nexpect now when fighting these dragons, most everyone in our raiding party<br/>\nhad all of their buffs stripped away. I also noticed that guardian rhythms<br/>\nand elemental rhythms was being stripped by Nag and Vix nearly as fast as I<br/>\ncould refresh them. It is seems these two are quite a bit more difficult<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDowns DePunisher<br/>\n\t50 Wood-elf Bard<br/>\n\tThe Elitists    Tribunal Server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
