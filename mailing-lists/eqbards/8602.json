I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-227775805\">In a fit of limelight grabbing impulse (for which I&#39;m well known,<br/>\nalthough I can&#39;t see it myself), I&#39;d like to pose some questions to<br/>\nthe audience .....<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely made a similar post a little while back asking about the<br/>\nproblems we have with those creatures that just don&#39;t like us singing,<br/>\ndrumming, whatever while our group is sitting down resting for the<br/>\nnext fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut lately it&#39;s become a problem for me again.  Granted, I&#39;m not the<br/>\nhighest level going, but I&#39;m entering the nice grouping range at which<br/>\nto learn the different tactics as a bard.  My wiz grouped constantly<br/>\nall the way through her career, so she learned quite early how to<br/>\nsurvive.  But I&#39;m having more trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been fighting a lot in West Commons.  Those juicy wisps are just<br/>\nripe for the taking, and I&#39;ve made a pot of cash from selling stones<br/>\nto the greedy druids and wizards who want to take them a couple zones<br/>\nover and sell for a profit.  Tip - ask for 9pp, they can still make a<br/>\nprofit out of that ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, on the few times I&#39;ve actually grouped, it&#39;s usually to fight<br/>\nthe mean old dervs at their camp.  Now to put this in context, when<br/>\nI&#39;m solo, I don&#39;t die.  Actually, sometimes I have died but it&#39;s<br/>\nusually when I get greedy and take on 3 wisps, only to be barely alive<br/>\nas the last one is nearly dead and suddenly I&#39;m asking myself how I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t hear that kodiak tiptoe up behind me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as soon as I get into a group, I&#39;m dead before I can get off a<br/>\nlast musical obituary.  Once I even didn&#39;t have my weapon equipped, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t bellow, I didn&#39;t do chords, I just sat back, had my drum out,<br/>\nand buffed.  And still the dervs didn&#39;t like me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my simple question is .... how can I avoid being the centre of<br/>\nattention!  In a fight that is, because clearly I need to be centre of<br/>\nattention at all other times! &lt;cough&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it a case of holding off for a little while before doing the songs<br/>\n... similar to being a wiz and holding back zapping until the fighter<br/>\ntypes have made the beasts dislike them enough?  I can do that, but<br/>\nthen it seems a bit daft.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe I&#39;m alone in this, and I&#39;m just paranoid or silly or both.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thoughts much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nSaldara<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (27), Mith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nMelaniel<br/>\nWood Elf Bard (14), Mith Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
