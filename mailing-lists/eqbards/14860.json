I&#39;d prefer the tests<br/>\n&gt;   be done on ice giants, because it is glaringly evident when they <br/>\n&gt;   attack if their speed is normal, chained, or togors/shiftless.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why ice giants?  So far, all the mobs I&#39;ve seen, unless they<br/>\nhave a weapon or are buffed, swing once every 3.0 seconds.<br/>\nIt&#39;s far easier to test it on level 1 mobs that can&#39;t double<br/>\nattack.  Just let it beat on you, chain/torgors it, and time<br/>\nhow long it takes between hits.  Or duel a shaman/enchanter<br/>\nand time your own swings.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
