Can a bard use a shield? I<br/>\nhave seen quite a lot of bards with shields and they are saying that they<br/>\ncan use them and on the other side you are saying here that bards don&#39;t have<br/>\nparrying. Doesn&#39;t that mean that we can&#39;t use shields? I allways thought<br/>\nthat parrying is the skill that you need if you want to use your shield. Ohh<br/>\nyes and please no criticism that I should know that.
