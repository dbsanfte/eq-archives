Do you really<br/>\nwant your second character, or your friends, to go through the same system<br/>\nof camping hours on end and dealing with kill stealers that you did?<br/>\n\tIt&#39;s something ingrained in human nature to try and make the lives<br/>\nof our family and friends easier, to save them the hardships that we had<br/>\nto go through.  To me, the &quot;fun&quot; in everquest is the interaction between<br/>\nyou and your friends, going in a group to kill monsters to learn new<br/>\nskills and new spells.  Going through a dungeon to get items is nice and<br/>\nall, but when the items in question are ones in which you have to deal<br/>\nwith people who&#39;s sole purpose seem to deprive other people of their fun,<br/>\nby farming the items for ebay, or kill stealing them items for themselves,<br/>\nI for one wouldn&#39;t want to go through that experience any more than I have<br/>\nto, nor would I want to put anyone else through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Windryder</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
