Why?  Because people get tired of trying to sell stuff and want to get some sleep -- You never know what cool deals you&#39;ll find. )<br/>\nLook for a dragoon dirk if you can.  They go for 30-40pp and when you upgrade, it can sit in your range slot and you&#39;ll still get the MR and dex from it...I carried a dragoon dirk in my range slot until I could afford a Runed Bone Fork.  If you don&#39;t have  30-40 pp then hunt bears until you get a HQ pelt and auction it for 40pp or trade for a dragoon dirk -- You might get lucky and a tailor with extra gear in the bank will give you a deal...<br/>\nFind a friend who has luclin and ask him/her to buy you those songs.  If you are in a guild, it should be easy -- if you are not in a guild, look for one -- guilds offer a whole new perspective on the game if you join a good one.<br/>\nWarsong is a self-only buff and it is a bit better than anthem which is for grouping -- I recommend it highly if you are soloing -- but with hymm under your belt, you&#39;ll be a welcome addition to most groups. ...and bellow WILL tell you the damage you do.  I used it for pulling until I hit lvl 30.  Damage is unimpressive from this song but it costs no mana and is seldom resisted and is a good interupt when you fight/duel casters.  you&#39;ll get a lot of use from it )<br/>\nYours in Song<br/>\nTyunes Stratevarius<br/>\nBard of 55 missed notes<br/>\n  compugeeke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:compugeeke@...\">compugeeke@...</a>&gt; wrote: Hi everybody!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am nearly ready to take on some Willo-whisps (i am almost lvl 11)<br/>\nbut I need a good *cheap* magic weapon, as my tarnished broad sword <br/>\naint gonna cut it.  How much can I expect to pay for a weapon that <br/>\nwill do the trick?  I am on a tight budget right now, what with <br/>\nbuying songs and learning to smith :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when soloing which do you prefer: Anthem de arms, or Whistling <br/>\nwarsong?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Also, how hard is it to get that other level 9 song I heard can <br/>\nonly be gotten in Luclin, &quot;Magical Monologue&quot;  (of course I&#39;ll have <br/>\nto buy the exp first) so that i can save my Platinum and not have to <br/>\nbuy a magic weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Also Also does the bellow that bards get at lvl 12 affect <br/>\ncreatures that can only be hit with magic weapons, and does that song <br/>\nshow you how much dammage you are delivering (whereas the chords of <br/>\ndisonance only say &quot;Large Spider winces&quot; etc)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening!<br/>\n<br/>\n-fohat, level 10 half-elf Quelious Bard on Firiona Vie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
