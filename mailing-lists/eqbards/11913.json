The Psalm <br/>\nsongs give resist bonus in excess of what guardian gives with a drum at the <br/>\nexpense of only boasting one resist. So if you know you need a certain boast <br/>\n(say poison for fighting Nox) just mem the correct Psalm and weave it in.  <br/>\nOne night a party I was in took on good old Nox, I memed Psalm of Purity & <br/>\nthe cleric buffed poison resist & no one in the group got poisoned.
