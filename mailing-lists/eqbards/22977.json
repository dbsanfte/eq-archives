For this reason alone, bards were<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; best class for pulling in PoG.  Now if you get rooted, your stuck in place<br/>\n&gt; until roots wears off or until you cancel magic it away.  This change is<br/>\n&gt; contrary to what GZ stated a long time ago on how the song was intended to<br/>\n&gt; work.  I only assume that whoever replaced GZ as spell system designer was<br/>\n&gt; not aware of this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel P.

The<br/>\n&gt; patch went in, there was a public outcry, and a few days later the<br/>\ndecision<br/>\n&gt; was reversed and Selos was working the way it did when the game was first<br/>\n&gt; released, i.e. it broke root. Geoffrey Zatkin at one point even publically<br/>\n&gt; stated that Selos breaking root was &quot;working as intended&quot; and not a bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone else remember that far back?
