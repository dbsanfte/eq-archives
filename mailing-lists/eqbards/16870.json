Is there ever a situation where we would not want<br/>\nthe -16 ac or -45 agi?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 57:<br/>\n- McVaxius&#39; Rousing X -<br/>\nIncrease Attack Speed for Between 21% to 22%; Strength - Unknown formula;<br/>\nIncrease ATK from 13 to 14; Damage shield by 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, I&#39;m not level 50 yet, so I don&#39;t know how good Verses of Victory is,<br/>\nbut it seems like it would be a better choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare:<br/>\n==============================<br/>\nAttack Speed Buff: 21% (McVaxius&#39; Rousing X) vs 25% (Verses of Victory)<br/>\nStr Buff:          + x (McVaxius&#39; Rousing X) vs +30 (Verses of Victory)<br/>\n<br/>\nHard to judge without seeing the exact str buff of McVaxius&#39; but if it isn&#39;t<br/>\nat least 18, then it isn&#39;t competitive with VoV. Not to mention that ViV has<br/>\n+20 ac and +30 agi (to balance with a rather meager 8 damage shield)<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 58:<br/>\n- Niv&#39;s Harmonic X -<br/>\nIncrease AC by 24<br/>\n<br/>\nBoring? Guardian Rythmns at level 17 is +3 ac (sans drum), at level 36 is +6<br/>\nac (sans drum). I don&#39;t have figures on level 50, but we can probably<br/>\nreasonably extrapolate the ac to be +9 (sans drum). Now I ask you, is +11 ac<br/>\nworth giving up +30 vs magic?<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 59:<br/>\n- Solon&#39;s Charsimatic Concord -<br/>\nIncrease Charisma by 45<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems a bit weak also, given that for all intensive purposes, only<br/>\nbards will benefit from this in combat (most enchanters have thier cha in<br/>\nthe 180s-200s at level 50). Seeing as how we can&#39;t charm mobs above level 37<br/>\nwith no charm upgrade and there is no mez upgrade, how often will this see<br/>\nplay?<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 60:<br/>\n????<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we to assume that this is being left blank to allow for expansion? Ok,<br/>\nso that was probably a bit premature.
