(And it&#39;s MUCH more effective<br/>\nwith an instrument anyway, don&#39;t bother singing it)  It&#39;s a strangely<br/>\nfitting first song for bards to learn their brass skills with.  The whole<br/>\npoint of the &quot;song&quot; is to make a deafening racket, something easy to do when<br/>\nyou can hardily play a horn!<br/>\n<br/>\nMust practice.  Find a quiet, safe place, away from the radius of any<br/>\nwandering NPCs--and leave yourself play a few hours.  (Like the schoolchild<br/>\nwho finds a secluded place to learn their trumpet, away from any wandering<br/>\nparents)  I also went to a low level dungeon and just &quot;practiced&quot; on swarms<br/>\nof greenies, killing them all.  Just make sure you play it constantly for a<br/>\ngood long while.
