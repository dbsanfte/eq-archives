I<br/>\nknew that I could now use duel wield and that I probably need to point into<br/>\nit for it to work, but I forgot to train in Freeport before I left, and then<br/>\nwhen I arrived at Kelethin I forgot to train  there as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow back in Freeport I went to the guild intent on putting some points into<br/>\nduel wield before I returned to hunting in Oasis. But to my surprise when I<br/>\nscrolled down to duel wield in the skills window I did not see the friendly<br/>\n&quot;no charge&quot; text, but a charge of 1 plat 3 gold. Hmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo off I went to oasis, equipped my dwarven axe and combine longsword and<br/>\nproceeded to pound crocs..<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have become better at duel wield (35)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am stumped. I never tried to use two weapons before, didn&#39;t train it,<br/>\nand all of a sudden I am starting out with a skill of 34.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 10:22 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] dual weild<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Abraham Hardjana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ahardjan@...\">ahardjan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well you are able to live without putting a asingle point into the skill.<br/>\n&gt; It will take forever to get the first few points through actually using<br/>\n&gt; it.  I tried to do begging from scratch while waiting for the boat.  I<br/>\n&gt; think I had to hit that button about 200-300 times before I got the<br/>\n&gt; begging(1) message.  What can I say I took the boat a lot in my youth back<br/>\n&gt; in the days when there was only one boat travelling from Butcherblock and<br/>\n&gt; Freeport ^_^.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 17 Nov 1999, Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like many skills (e.g. warrior&#39;s double attack) i thought we had to put<br/>\n1<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill point into duel wield to learn the basics.  could be wrong though<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hehe.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
