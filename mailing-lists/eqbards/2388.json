If you&#39;re soloing, the<br/>\ncomparison is pretty straightforward.  If you&#39;re in a group,<br/>\nthe extra damage is a small percentage of the damage the group<br/>\ndoes, so it may not exceed the extra damage you receive.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re grouped with just a cleric, you definitely want the<br/>\nextra weapon.  If you&#39;re grouped with a bunch of tanks the<br/>\ndifference between using a weapon or shield may be all of 3<br/>\nseconds.  If you&#39;re grouped with a bunch of wizards, the<br/>\ndamage from the weapon may be negligible, and you&#39;ll want to<br/>\nuse a shield and every taunt song available to keep the mobs<br/>\noff your wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat made the decision for me is that my str is not<br/>\nspectacular and shields tend to be heavier than weapons.  So I<br/>\njust carry two weapons, rather than two weapons and a shield,<br/>\nor a weapon and a shield.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
