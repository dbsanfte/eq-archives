Got the green pants and<br/>\nsleeves, rest is brown, no hat. Several people have complimented<br/>\nme on the look. Dunno what I&#39;ll do when I get higher since I<br/>\ncan&#39;t stand the look of banded on a human (or just about any<br/>\nfemale for that matter), bronze weighs a ton, and waiting until I<br/>\ncan get my lambent is an awfully long time to be wearing leather<br/>\neven if it does look good. But after spending about 15 levels in<br/>\nbanded with my cleric (she&#39;s now 29 and working on quests for the<br/>\nnice gold plate), I never want to look like a swimsuit model<br/>\nagain. Suggestions on good looking and relatively cheap gear for<br/>\nan low level bard? (besides twinking. The poor cleric&#39;s broke as<br/>\nit is, and I&#39;m not too fond of twinking anyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca Small wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I liked the color on lambent, especially when I had a mostly<br/>\n&gt; full suit on.<br/>\n&gt; When I started getting imbrued though, it didn&#39;t look as good.<br/>\n&gt; Then I got<br/>\n&gt; some kylong, and a hero bracer, and it was commented on several<br/>\n&gt; times that I<br/>\n&gt; was really multicolored.
