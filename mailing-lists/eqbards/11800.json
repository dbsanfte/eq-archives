And how<br/>\n&gt; often does he<br/>\n&gt; drop those Boots?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard those Efreeti boots trade VERY highly - I&#39;ve seen mithril or<br/>\n&gt; Ykesha&#39;s trade with that one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Madagan Songweaver - Bard of 30 songs - Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Although I like charm, and I like being able to kill hill giants this<br/>\n&gt; way,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it really really sux in a party and is pretty darn boring after<br/>\n&gt; the first<br/>\n&gt; 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or 3.  I much prefer holding the bar room in Sol A, or going after the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Efreeti with a party of 6 to watching a couple of giants beat on each<br/>\n&gt; other.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Solo&#39;ing in my opinion just isn&#39;t very much fun and it is just clearly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boring compared to the non-stop action of a good dungeon.  Last weekend,<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; did a Guild invasion of Sol A.  We held a good portion of the dungeon<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two well balanced parties of 6.  A bard and snarer (ranger or druid), a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; greater healer (shaman or cleric) and good tanks in each party,<br/>\n&gt; excessive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use of lullaby, hymn, anthem.
