When pvp is 7% out of two total segments where the other<br/>\nsegment is 93% they are insignificant.

The reason more people don&#39;t play them is because the return on<br/>\nthe work invested is not proportionate.  Unless you truly enjoy the actual<br/>\nwork involved, there is no reason to play a bard.  Some people do enjoy the<br/>\nconstant challenge despite the fact it is not rewarded equivalently to the<br/>\nlesser challenges of other classes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBards are not some Nietzschian ideal class that only those who are willing<br/>\nto sacrifice can play and for which they are rewarded with awesome powers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is inherently arrogant to assume that bards are actually really powerful<br/>\nbut are not played by more people solely because of ignorance, laziness, or<br/>\nincapacity.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
