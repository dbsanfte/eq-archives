Work and other<br/>\nstuff kept me from playing much the whole week. Did <br/>\nhave time to play an hour a day and managed to finish<br/>\nthe Glowing Stein quest for a friend by Thursday. <br/>\nFinally, I get some time to play seriously on Saturday<br/>\nand Sunday.<br/>\n*End Background Info*<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday<br/>\n<br/>\nLog on slight before noon EST. Figure it&#39;s a Saturday,<br/>\nand most of my friends should be on. Do a /who all <br/>\nfriends and all I see is a level 23 enchanter friend<br/>\nof mine (I&#39;m level 33). He&#39;s doing the Glowing Stein <br/>\nquest. I&#39;m heading to Highkeep to see if I can find a<br/>\ngroup. No luck there. Oh well. Head over to Freeport,<br/>\nget a boat ride and off to Unrest. Pretty dead. Another<br/>\nfull group is camping the basement. Someone starts a <br/>\nhuge train, I run to the zone, take on the unrest noble<br/>\nand his pet. With some help, I kill him and get a <br/>\nbloodstained mantle. Not too bad. No group but at least<br/>\na mantle. I thank the people that help me and I&#39;m off <br/>\nto Mistmoore to see if I can get a group. No luck there<br/>\neither. One or two groups there, but too low to do the<br/>\ngraveyard. Mainly picking off initiates and grinning <br/>\ngargoyles. Finally find a group with a level 31 cleric<br/>\nand a 29 druid. Not willing to take chances, they want<br/>\nto stay outside the graveyard. Fine with me. I stick <br/>\naround helping them kill stuff that is mostly green to<br/>\nme. Get one or two kills that give me exp. Ho hum <br/>\npretty boring. Get dropped. Oh well. Not exactly doing<br/>\nwell anyway. Decide to take a break, watch some TV and<br/>\nhave some food. Play Freecell a little and decide to <br/>\nlog on again. This time a good friend of mine, Level 35<br/>\nPaladin, Talhkis is on. Meet him in the graveyard in <br/>\nMistmoore. Get a decent group going and start getting <br/>\na bit of exp. But things were going slow, so we decide<br/>\nto meet another friend in West Commons and head to Sol<br/>\nA. So we arrive in Sol A and head towards the King area<br/>\nbut we get lost some. But it&#39;s ok. We&#39;re still getting<br/>\nkills and pretty decent exp so we&#39;re not complaining.<br/>\nHowever, all this time after I left Mistmoore I&#39;ve been<br/>\nhaving packetloss of over 50% consistently. I was <br/>\ncomtemplating logging and calling it a night but since<br/>\nwe were doing fine I decided to stay. Unfortunately, <br/>\none runner got away and came back with friends. I bit<br/>\nit. There was so much packetloss when I died that I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get the msg that I was slain by some goblin but <br/>\nrather Pain and his twin Suffering strikes me (must be<br/>\nmonks. Pesty monks) but misses and I died. Bound in <br/>\nGreater Fay. No problem. Level 31 cleric in my party<br/>\nrevives me. Decided to cut the losses before it gets<br/>\nworse and log. Net experience gain for the day - Zero.<br/>\nOn the whole not too bad a day but far from a good one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday<br/>\n<br/>\nOh how I wished I never even logged. Log on and see a <br/>\nfriend I haven&#39;t seen in a while. A level 29 monk<br/>\n(pesty monk). Group with him a little and again help<br/>\nhim clear some stuff. Green to me but blue to him so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really mind. Finally he gets a level 25 druid to <br/>\njoin us. So we try to make our way to the Foreman&#39;s<br/>\nroom. Packetloss is fine now so I said sure. Invis our way past most of<br/>\nthe goblins that were green to me. <br/>\nSitting around waiting for one more person to join us<br/>\nso we can try the Captain room since we found out that<br/>\nthe foreman room was being camped by someone else. Just<br/>\nchit chatting and all of a sudden I turn around and a<br/>\nhuge Flame goblin train is on my back. I run as fast as<br/>\nI can but I bite it. Still bound in GFay. Ouch. This <br/>\ntime no cleric. Well, turns out my friend&#39;s guildmate<br/>\na level 30 druid is online and in Greater Fay. Get a <br/>\ngroup teleport to West Commons. Invite this druid to <br/>\njoin us in Sol A. She does. So now we have a level 29<br/>\nmonk, a level 25 druid, a level 30 druid, a level 32 <br/>\nwarrior and me, a level 33 bard. Pretty good group. <br/>\nFigure the captain room shouldn&#39;t be a problem. <br/>\nShouldn&#39;t have a problem regaining the exp I lost from <br/>\ngetting trained on. Well make my way back and loot my <br/>\ncorpse. Go back to the zone line to regroup and we pick<br/>\nup another level 33 bard to complete the group. So we <br/>\ntry to work our way back. As I was crawling through the <br/>\nhole in the wall, my computer drops a frame. Next thing<br/>\nI know everything around me is red and I&#39;m taking 39 <br/>\ndamage every so often. Ouch, lava. Try to swim around<br/>\nand find a way out. Can&#39;t, swim to a place where I know <br/>\nwhere I am and die. Welcome back to GFay. Lvl 30 druid<br/>\ncomes pick me up and this time I get myself bound to<br/>\nFreeport (I&#39;m too used to grouping with a level 29 and<br/>\nup cleric). Run back and get my corpse with levitate <br/>\nsong. By this time I&#39;m kind of frustrated... but I push<br/>\non. We make our way to the captain room. Kill the <br/>\nelementals (cancel their dmg shield and they are <br/>\nactually pretty easy to kill and good exp). Then we <br/>\nclear the other room. So far so good. Maybe all this<br/>\ndying will soon pay off. Since I knew the area the best<br/>\nin my group, I pull. I knew I was going to pull a big<br/>\ngroup right when I clear the area before the captain <br/>\nroom. No problem. Done it a lot of times before. Have <br/>\na pull of 6 or so. I nod (and I noticed I nod more than<br/>\n4 but who knows... not sure). We&#39;re working on the <br/>\nflame goblin wizard. Monk says cancel magic the dmg<br/>\nshield this wizard has and nuke it as fast as the group<br/>\ncan. Was kind of puzzled by why he told the group to do<br/>\nthat since the wizard dmg shield does only 2 dmg and<br/>\nthis wizard was hitting us with AE spells that really<br/>\ndon&#39;t do that much. However the fight was going well<br/>\nand I got overconfident and didn&#39;t overrule that <br/>\ncommand. So our lvl 30 druid wasted all her mana nuking<br/>\nthe 2 wizards and one shaman. Leaving us to deal with<br/>\none inferno and 2 flame goblins (i think). By this time<br/>\nI&#39;ve taken a significant amt of damage so I take myself <br/>\nout of combat for a bit and sing healing song. Two<br/>\nrunners go. Uh oh. I immediately order evac. Druid <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have enough mana for succor. Goblins come back<br/>\nwith friends. I bite it first again. This time party<br/>\ncasualties are high. All except the monk (feigned) and<br/>\none druid die. Get corpse and decide to log. All this<br/>\ntime I was having a minor argument/discussion with the<br/>\nother bard in the party about nod vs charm. I prefer <br/>\nnod over charm, although I can see the use of charm. <br/>\nHowever, in a party I find nod so much more useful <br/>\nthan charm. The other bard insist that nod is inviting<br/>\ndeath to the person singing it (however it seems he had<br/>\nno problems with me singing it and keeping other alive)<br/>\n. I disagreed but oh well. On the whole totally disappointed with the<br/>\nday and felt that a lot of <br/>\nmiscommunication led to lots of unnecessary dieing and <br/>\ndifficulties. Sigh...... <br/>\n<br/>\nThat sums up my terrible EQ weekend. Taught me a valuable lesson<br/>\nthough, one of the most valuable thing<br/>\nyou can have in EQ (more than any piece of equipment in the game) is a<br/>\nparty of people that you can group with<br/>\nand group well with (communicate and trust each other). <br/>\n<br/>\nWell I&#39;m looking forward to the next weekend and this time I hope I can<br/>\ngroup up with all the people I usual group with. Oh, have a wedding to<br/>\nattend in Norrath too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to close things, I leave everyone with this question (which is<br/>\nsomewhat unfair since each song has its own merits (well almost all<br/>\nsongs)): <br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby/Nod vs Charm in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDarrian Ashoka<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
