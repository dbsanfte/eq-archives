I scribed SoT and started using it and WOW!<br/>\nIt┬Æs amazing.  I┬Æve used it in the Karnor Dog Tower, against Raptors and<br/>\nVicious Raptors in Timorous Deep and at the zone in Chardok.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis song really changes things for me. I feel like I did at 32 ┬û getting a<br/>\nnew song that really increased my capability and group-ability.  Unlike<br/>\nothers ┬û I┬Æve found Pixie to be too resistant to be usable.  Keeping 2 mobs<br/>\nparked now is trivial.  The resists were rare ┬û me or anyone else getting<br/>\nhit was even rarer.  I don┬Æt have to worry about post-rez mana shortage for<br/>\ncrowd control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a group with 2 Druids, 2 Paladins and myself at the zone out in<br/>\nChardok.  We had little difficulty.  We had a 59 monk soloing ┬û he was<br/>\n┬ôPersonality Challenged┬ö and through a fit because we complained about him<br/>\ntraining us by pulling through us because he was there first.  He got mad<br/>\nbecause his pull through us started hitting my group so I mezzed it &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a large guild raiding there ┬û and went bad after they tried to<br/>\ntake the Queen down.  A good buddy 56 Shaman hung out with us while he<br/>\nwaited on his CR ┬û and initially thought we were ┬ôCrazy┬ö to fight there<br/>\nwithout a Cleric.  He through us some nice buffs and slowed the mobs for us<br/>\nwhile he waited ┬û which rocked ┬û but we kicked butt before and after.  This<br/>\nwas with a five man group.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually a third Druid came and one of the Pallies had to leave.  Shortly<br/>\nthereafter ┬û we had a 2 pull and a third wandered in.  I was able to keep<br/>\nthe two parked indefinitely without any problems.  But the mob left (forget<br/>\nwhich type of Sarnak it was) was a Cleric or Shaman ┬û and dotted the tank<br/>\nand healed itself.  Ironically ┬û we were able to keep the extras down ┬û but<br/>\ncouldn┬Æt kill the single one fast enough with only the one tank.  (Druid DOT<br/>\n┬Æs were resisted etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n53 Bard<br/>\nOrder of Norrath<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
