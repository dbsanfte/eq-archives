I don&#39;t really know all the details of Shada&#39;s, but I think<br/>\nthey&#39;re fairly similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasicially how it works is this.  Every item that drops from a<br/>\ngod/dragon/dracolich/etc is assigned a point value based on the percieved<br/>\nworth of the item.  We use a 1-5 scale with a McVaxius&#39; Horn of Suckiness<br/>\nbeing an example of a 1, and a Cloak of Flames being an example of a 5.  For<br/>\nevery raid that you attend, you recieve 1 point.  When an item drops, the<br/>\nperson with the most points, from an eligible class (no RBB&#39;s for wizards,<br/>\nor eyepatches for warriors) has first claim to the item.  If two or more<br/>\npeople with the same amount of points want the same item, then we random it<br/>\nbetween them (mind you, this is rare, since we have a pretty large points<br/>\nbase now).<br/>\n<br/>\nIts works amazingly well.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had a single arguement over<br/>\nloot since we started with this system a few months ago, and we know within<br/>\nabout 15 seconds of when something drops who gets it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Randy Keith [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kalekona@...\">Kalekona@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 09, 2000 10:44 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Imbrued gloves?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Randy Keith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kalekona@...\">Kalekona@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking at these posts, and am very interested in this point system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny chance you could point me to the rules? =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
