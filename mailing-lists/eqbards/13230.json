When I<br/>\nstarted I had to kite them most of the way, but I was still doing better<br/>\nthan I had been in my pickup groups and constant death.  I eventually got<br/>\ntired of soloing (I&#39;m 19th now) and started to wander a bit....I headed to<br/>\nPermafrost got in a pickup group and had immediate party death.  (Camping<br/>\nthe prophet the others in the group told the puller not to use his bow to<br/>\npull, sure enough he does and brings hell and high water at us....*Foomf*)<br/>\nCR and we decide to back out to the alcove in the banner room, I pull out<br/>\nmy horn and play Clouding to scout about a bit, counting 7 goblins, 3 of<br/>\nwhich are casters, I say, &#39;We should move to the hall (back towards the <br/>\nentrance) and pull those front three&#39; out walks the tank and around the<br/>\ncorner and pulls all 7...mind you, our &#39;healers&#39; numbered three, a ranger,<br/>\na paladin, and myself.  Needless to say, after my CR I left.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can go on and on....&quot;Let&#39;s goto Runnyeye&quot; they say, two CR&#39;s later,<br/>\nmaybe the eyes in the gorge would be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose that this is more of a rant and I apologize, but I wanted to let<br/>\nyou know that there are others like you who, when grouping, get stuck in<br/>\npiss poor pickup groups that couldn&#39;t fight there way out of a cardboard<br/>\nbox in the slums of Freeport after a downpour....<br/>\n<br/>\nTimmian Trueheart<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Papa Legba &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For example Monday I was with two others (enchanter and shaman) who I<br/>\n&gt; had done great with the night before.  We picked up three tanks (A<br/>\n&gt; uber-twinkie warrior, exec axe/crafted at lvl 17, monk and a ranger). <br/>\n&gt; Playing it safe ( I thought) we were turbo pulling on orc highway (if<br/>\n&gt; you dont know they are lvl 12-16ish with an occasional &quot;a orc warrior&quot;<br/>\n&gt; which are like lvl 20 I think, red to me at 15).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fifteen minutes in (the enchant, shaman and I had been together for an<br/>\n&gt; hour Monday, but a lvl 15 bard is a flimsy tank against DW caimians and<br/>\n&gt; crocs).  We heard a &quot;xxxx yells for help&quot;.  All but the monk (out<br/>\n&gt; pulling) get up, and see the usual.  A soloist mistakingly pulled on of<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;a orc&quot;s.  We pile on, as the shaman warns the puller we have a big<br/>\n&gt; fight (these are pretty rough even with a full group).  We have it<br/>\n&gt; beaten down, both casters OOM, but health is fine, when I look up from<br/>\n&gt; key mashing and see mine dropping.  Ugh, DB skel decided he didnt like<br/>\n&gt; my music.  Three /g&#39;s of &quot;Help the bard&quot; from our shaman (he&#39;s good!<br/>\n&gt; noticed my health before I did), and I am still solo on the DB down to<br/>\n&gt; 1.5 bubs.  Eventually the enchanter&#39;s pet manages to get the DB off<br/>\n&gt; me(lucky I guess).  At which point the ranger says &quot;Anthem!&quot;.  (I assume<br/>\n&gt; he finally noticed all the nifty flashing icons were off his screen, as<br/>\n&gt; I was getting the crap stunned out of me).  Shaman reminds the tank that<br/>\n&gt; their fair haired bard is the lowest lvl in the group and not much good<br/>\n&gt; at absorbing damage.  (I tend to not say anything, so he has taken on<br/>\n&gt; the role for me) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
