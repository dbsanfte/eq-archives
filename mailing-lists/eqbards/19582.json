I have 3 or 4 of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe failed crypt raider drops the coin, and seems to drop it every time. He<br/>\nspawns near the library. Getting to the library is laughably easy. You can<br/>\npull singles or doubles the whole way there just by pulling slowly and<br/>\ncarefully, no lulling is needed. The raider seems to be on approx a 40 min<br/>\nspawn, which is about twice the regular spawn rate of the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nScrounger coin<br/>\n===============<br/>\nScrounger happened to be there one day as I was passing through. I soloed<br/>\nhim easily despite the 2 sarnak knights that joined in. (selo, chant, chant)<br/>\n<br/>\nDalnir Coin<br/>\n============<br/>\nPAIN IN THE BUTT to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe imprecator is not a common spawn. I spent 3 hours in dalnir before he<br/>\nshowed. We were camping the church, but the 2 times he spawned, he spawned<br/>\nin the upstairs location. (2nd level) A druid was at the upstairs spot, so<br/>\nwe went up there and I bought the coin for 50p. (which is what I had on me)<br/>\n<br/>\nBloodgill Coin<br/>\n===============<br/>\ndunno, bought if from a merchant for 6 silver. :┬¼ )<br/>\n<br/>\nCity of Mist Coin<br/>\n==================<br/>\nCaptain of the guard spawns near the entrance. You need to clear 1-4 mobs<br/>\nbefore you can pull him. He drops the coin everytime. I have 3 or 4 of these<br/>\nas well, and saw many others go to party members.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmerald Forest<br/>\n===============<br/>\nAll luck. Our druid foraged it on the first try. (whoo hoo)<br/>\n<br/>\nStar of Odus<br/>\n=============<br/>\nApprox 105 p. Can be purchased in Erudin or East Cabalis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all there was to it for me.

I&#39;ll probably find him and give him some more money at <br/>\nsome point) and 50 pp for the coin in Kaesora.  The guy in Kaesora <br/>\nwas very helpful in telling me how difficult it would be to get the <br/>\ncoins and (from what he said) that specific coin was pretty rare, so <br/>\nI felt it was worth more.  The one&#39;s in Dalnir I got for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrices could vary tremendously, I imagine, but remember that the <br/>\nperson you&#39;re dealing with can not complete the quest (unless they <br/>\nare a Bard, have a Bard, or know a Bard).  I always offer to pay in <br/>\nmy shout to the zone and then leave it up to the person who offers to <br/>\ndecide how much they want for it.  Most people don&#39;t know what <br/>\nthey&#39;re for and are actually happy to give it away for free when you <br/>\ntell them (MENTION THAT IT&#39;S NO DROP!!!!).  And most people would <br/>\nhave destroyed it anyway, so ANY money is more than they&#39;d get <br/>\notherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Speaking of these coins, if you had to buy them, how much would you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>expect<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to pay for them?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Gilgurth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop online together.
