The message received is evidently &quot;Your song ends abruptly&quot;, and<br/>\nhas a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant seems to be<br/>\nputting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from the keyboard if<br/>\nwe want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the keyboard to keep one<br/>\nsong up as well.  I guess bards dont need bathroom breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon of Bertoxx, 48th Composition, Defenders of Aleria</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
