If critter A modifies you AC by<br/>\n-400 then the difference between an armor of 500 and 460 is no longer 10%,<br/>\nsuddenly its a whopping<br/>\n40% change.  It seems from the mechanics that critters have an Offensive<br/>\nBonus (static) and armor provides a Defensive Bonus (also static).  These<br/>\nbonuses are added to some simple random attack roll (RND).  Hence Wisp at OB<br/>\n300 has maximum attack value of 300+RND vs your AC.  This effectively makes<br/>\nits attacks your AC (500) - its OB (300) crossreferenced vs RND to determine<br/>\nhit and damage.  Hence going from 500 - 460 whould have an enormous effect<br/>\non combat outcome.  This would also explain why creatures far lower in level<br/>\nthan you would be unable to hit you or do minimal damage when they do.  Add<br/>\nthe concept of open-ended rolls (ala RoleMaster) for RND into this equation<br/>\nand you end up with a system extremely like that in RoleMaster.  The results<br/>\nI see in EQ are so like those typically seen in Rolemaster it is uncanny.  I<br/>\nhave been playing that game for 15 years and was shocked when I saw how<br/>\nclosely the mechanics seemed to model onto it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a side note, in RoleMaster, high value armors like Plate reduce the<br/>\nagility bonus for performing skills.  This also seems to hold true in EQ<br/>\nthough is far tougher to check.  This could also account for the &quot;damage<br/>\nabsorbtion&quot; that is perceived by many, especially monks who seem to see it<br/>\nthe most.  If those &quot;less absorbing&quot; armors actually lowered agility bonuses<br/>\nmore than the &quot;more absorbing&quot; ones, the result would be the same or at<br/>\nleast very similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have started playing with some of the log parsers and will see what I can<br/>\nget out of them to disprove my ideas.  Its far to easy to look at them and<br/>\ntry to prove my concepts, I&#39;m more interested in seeing how hard to disprove<br/>\nthey are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
