Died<br/>\nseveral times the first nite, due to poor groups - my enchanter husband kept<br/>\ntelling people which thing to kill (he was mezzing the others), but they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t follow his direction - but later we got a great group going in the BK<br/>\nroom, and some higher level friends of ours got a group going in the Knight<br/>\nroom upstairs and were handy to help in case we got in trouble... And, until<br/>\nalmost the entire server crashed, we were doing great and having much fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same on all servers, but on The Rathe, the<br/>\nskeletons do not have a nametag like all the other NPCs. I petitioned this<br/>\n(first time I ever petitioned anything), because at one point we were trying<br/>\nto fight three or four different skeles, and it was hard to get targeted the<br/>\ncorrect one to fight (and some were having a hard time figuring out how to<br/>\nuse the assist command...) - but I digress... I basically petitioned that<br/>\nthe skeles get nametags so they would be easier to target and identify, and<br/>\nan assistant got right back to me (I was impressed) and said he understood<br/>\nmy point and was going to request they fix that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow... I was wondering if any of you have gotten such quick response and if<br/>\nanyone has ever seen them fix things like that... or if it takes them a<br/>\nwhile to fix things like that... Just curious what kind of responses people<br/>\nhave gotten, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe journeys all!<br/>\n<br/>\n==Lady Brangwen Incantare of the 22nd Song<br/>\n====The Lavender-Eyed Lady of Song<br/>\n======Squire Court of The Guild New Outriders<br/>\n========Citizen of the City of Kelethin on Faydwer<br/>\n=========Wife of High Elf Enchanter, Callais Incantare<br/>\n===========Server: The Rathe<br/>\n===============================================<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
