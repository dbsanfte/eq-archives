I assume since you are talking about the mana song, you<br/>\n&gt; are level 32+.  All i was thinking was that you are not level 26 yet, when i<br/>\n&gt; believe it shows up as a skill on Carskin.  Or perhaps they made it<br/>\n&gt; available at a later level, hard to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The yucky level of 35. (Forgot to leave name and such in original thread).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m left with one more question still for anyone who can respond.<br/>\nWhat is the duration of the mana song? &quot;Your mind clears.&quot; Is that the end of<br/>\nit, or like other songs does it last for 2 more ticks?<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that the duration of the mana song is 1 tick only because of the<br/>\nfact that the mana song is cumulative if you have more than 1 bard in your<br/>\nparty. 2 bards can sing it, and it stacks well. The casters in the party, with<br/>\ndouble mana song going, were on some kind of a high.<br/>\nAnyways, thanks for the info.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow another quick question thats on a different topic again. I recently hit 35<br/>\nand was wondering how useful or practical it is to use Denon&#39;s Dissension aka<br/>\nthe mana-drain song. I&#39;d think it&#39;d come in handy when fighting some tough<br/>\ncasters or the never-ending mana NPCs, but has anyone tested this against a<br/>\nfriend or anything to see how much and how fast their mana actually drains?<br/>\nBasically, what I want to know is, should I ever bother memorizing this song?<br/>\nI&#39;ll test it out on my own, but please comment on this if you&#39;ve had any<br/>\nexperience with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper, L35<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
