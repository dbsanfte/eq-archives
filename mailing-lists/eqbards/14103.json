I went<br/>\nthru 27 - 37 in about 1/4 the time it took to go thru 19 - 27.  I must have<br/>\ndied nearly 200 times in my 20&#39;s.  One major benefit is being ported out of<br/>\na battle gone awry, rather than trying to crawl to the zone.  But mostly it<br/>\nis being with competent people and working lots of blues rather than few<br/>\nreds.  I&#39;ve averaged about 1 death a level since 27, quite a change from my<br/>\n20&#39;s.  And _that_ definately adds to the fun factor.  _I_ am certainly<br/>\nenjoying the game more staying alive instead of trapsing back from my bind<br/>\npoint. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, my Bard is somewhat on the shelf until they sort out the<br/>\novercrowding problems.  It&#39;s more fun playing a level 8 Shaman in Kerra Isle<br/>\n(and training myself to death :), than it is spending 45 mins trying to find<br/>\na place to hunt... Even Paw is crowded on Xegony these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
