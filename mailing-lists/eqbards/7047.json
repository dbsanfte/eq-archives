Lullaby has a lesser effect, but<br/>\nalso<br/>\n<br/>\nworks.  In fact, the only song that doesn&#39;t really seem to do anything to<br/>\nplayers is Kelin&#39;s Lament, other than giving them the &quot;You feel a sense of<br/>\nloss&quot; message. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin<br/>\n  -bard of Rallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
