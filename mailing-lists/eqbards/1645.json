The spell effect on it goes up as<br/>\nyou level, increasing STR, but also decreasing AGI .  After a while, that<br/>\nAGI loss pretty much negates the magic skin(which doesn&#39;t go up in the<br/>\namount of damage it can absorb), and keep in mind that while skinned, you<br/>\ncan still be bashed and run stunned.  Either one stops your songs cold, and<br/>\ncan get you killed at the wrong time.  Also, the last hit that &#39;blows<br/>\nthrough&#39; the tomahawk shield applies all extra damage to you.  And since the<br/>\ndamage was computed with the benefit of your lower AC, that last hit can<br/>\nhurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd quite frankly, the shield is so puny that it won&#39;t even absorb ONE good<br/>\nhit from higher level mobs before it fails.  That, combined with the fact<br/>\nthat the tomahawk is not all that efficient compared to other 1h slash and<br/>\npierce you can aquire in the mid twenties and beyond, means that about the<br/>\ntime you get one on your own, you should start planning on replacing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan knew what he was doing when he created that item, and knew the level<br/>\nranges that would be required to get it.  The tomahawk is roughly the same<br/>\nniche as the Bone Bladed Claymore, Chrysknife, Runed Totem Staff, and the<br/>\nScreaming Mace.  Good for its level, something to transistion you out of<br/>\ncombines while you quest for better items, but by no means a weapon someone<br/>\nbeyond high teens/low twenties should want to use, once they knew about<br/>\nbetter weapons elsewhere.  Even well balanced weapons are more efficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: Eqbards (E-mail) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 10:24 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Best 1hs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Which is better: tomahawk, bloodclaw, or a barb whip?<br/>\n&gt;Or is there another good 1hs that I do not know about that a bard can use.<br/>\n&gt;WellBalanced does not count.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\n&gt;Hammerpaw and Samiam<br/>\n&gt;Champions of Norrath, The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
