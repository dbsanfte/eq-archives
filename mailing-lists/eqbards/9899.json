My Fear just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to be taking hold on this guy.  It was like he was out of range<br/>\n(no resist message), but he was hitting me for 60s and 70s.  I dutifully<br/>\nstood at his feet Screeching while he pummeled me trying to get it to take<br/>\nhold.  Screech *finally* worked and he turned and fled.  I had exactly 12<br/>\nHPs left at that point, so I decided chasing after him was probably a bad<br/>\nidea.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you try this at 27th, be careful!<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also meant to ask this in my last email.........<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can someone give me a good tactic on how I can take Choon/Froon, I hear<br/>\n&gt; stuff about Fear/Chains etc but Fear has a really poor range and you have<br/>\n&gt; to be within hitting range for it to work, if I get too close to Choon he<br/>\n&gt; hits me and interupts my song, am I doing something wrong or is it just a<br/>\n&gt; hard trick to pull off?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tried to melee Choon but I barely hit him, maybe I should wait<br/>\n&gt; till level<br/>\n&gt; 28 so that I may have a chance with my Staff Proc (Chaotic Feedback).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any help/info would be greatly appreciated, and if anyone on Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; fancies helping a fellow bard then that would also be appreciated too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Madagan, bard of 27 songs - Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
