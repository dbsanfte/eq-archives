That&#39;s not the part I find funny,<br/>\nits just that everyone who says its hopeless also says they are afraid to go<br/>\nthere.  I would think it is would be desireable that they&#39;d be afraid to go<br/>\nthere but that they would go anyway and have some reasonable chance of<br/>\nsurvival.  The idea that groups could go off and wantonly kill a &#39;od like<br/>\nCazic Thule struck me as silly as in the old days of D&D some kEwL DoOd<br/>\nwould show up for a game with his own personal Mjolnir that he &#39;ripped&#39; from<br/>\nThor&#39;s cold dead fingers.  &#39;ods should kill you, by the dozens.  If every<br/>\ngreat hero in the land showed up and laid into the guy then maybe he should<br/>\ndie, but not without a lot of company.  Just my personal opinion of course<br/>\nand I&#39;ll leave it at that and save Talies the &#39;KABONG&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 4:29 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Plane of losses<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Sep 15/99, &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No matter what they say I still find it hilarious that people consider it<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; problem that they are afraid to go to the Plane of Fear.  I feel for those<br/>\n&gt; who were slaughtered, but I think we should all be afraid to go there.  It<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be hopeless, but it should be feared, not merely viewed as a new<br/>\n&gt; place to get xp and cool items.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nUmm. Do you somehow get the idea it&#39;s not currently hopeless? If you<br/>\nwant a real plane of fear that works like the current one but is a bit<br/>\ncheaper on system resources they should just make a gate that kills you<br/>\nand deletes your body when you use it. We currently have the same basic<br/>\neffect.
