Low and behold, not once<br/>\nbut TWICE in a row she was able to steal the XP from all of us.<br/>\nTheoretically that should be impossible and I cannot imagine how in ANY<br/>\nfashion she could outdamage all 6 of us... especially the combo that we had.<br/>\nEmbarassed, she stop practicing on our MOBs after her two steals :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in my opinion, the last option &quot;BUG&quot; is most applicable here.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 43rd song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kevin L.

So she would solo a mino lord and then we would kill<br/>\none.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While she was soloing hers, I was chaining it to make it a little easier<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her while we awaited our turn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One time, I decided to give her a little extra help in the form of<br/>\n&gt; Fulfil&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Curtailing Chant (level 30 song?) which provides the MR debuff along<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; small DOT (6 or 7 dmg per pulse).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So when the mino lord died, imagine my surprise when I got the exp for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill!!!  She had been dotting the heck out of it as well as bashing it,<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her pet helping her, and whatever else a level 36 shaman can do.. hehe,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yet my teensy tiny DOT somehow stole her kill!  Oh, and I wasn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; equipping a drum (it IS supposed to be a percussion song isn&#39;t it?).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, as I see it, there are a few possible explanations.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.  She wasn&#39;t getting credit for her pet&#39;s damage.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.  The DOT on Fulfil&#39;s is much higher than suspected.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3.  The druid I was with (who was supposedly afk) threw in a few zaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4.
