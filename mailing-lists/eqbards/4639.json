I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>\nscrap up the details about how it works but haven&#39;t been successful. My<br/>\nquestions are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. When the person that loses dies, do they go back to where they&#39;re bound?<br/>\n2. Is it true that whoever wins the duel can loot items off of your body?<br/>\n3. Is there any way to cancel a duel after both people have accepted the<br/>\nduel?<br/>\n4. Is it against Verant&#39;s rules to have outsiders buff a player while he/she<br/>\nis dueling? (I wouldn&#39;t do this, but I&#39;d worry about the person I&#39;m dueling<br/>\ndoing it)<br/>\n5b. If you&#39;re in a group with another Bard and you&#39;re dueling, will their<br/>\nsongs affect you during the duel?<br/>\n6. If you&#39;re dueling in a PVP area, can other people enter the fight?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, and sorry if these have been covered before.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
