Also, the hallway just past the zone when<br/>\nleaving Kaladim always lags for me until I get outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt annoys me greatly the number of people that just sit in the bank at<br/>\nFreeport doing absolutely nothing but taking up space. Last night I couldn&#39;t<br/>\neven get INTO the bank because people were standing around blocking the<br/>\ndoor, the hallway and then the windows as well as the door to get around<br/>\ninside. There must have been no less than 30 people in the bank with maybe 6<br/>\nusing it. It not only creates incredible lag, but is quite annoying not<br/>\nbeing able to get in.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
