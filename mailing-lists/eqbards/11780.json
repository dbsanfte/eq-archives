True, they are not deliberately and directly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;preventing you from finding anything to hunt, but they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;doing it indirectly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then why are you laying the blame at their feet?

I&#39;m saying they are a<br/>\ncontributing cause, and therefor one cannot say they are<br/>\nirrelevant to the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBad things do not always have malicious intent behind them.  <br/>\nSometimes they just happen.  It&#39;s very possible for people to<br/>\nmake all the right decisions and still have things go wrong.  <br/>\nJust because I say people are causing a problem does not mean<br/>\nI think they are doing it out of maliciousness and need to be<br/>\nblamed and reprimanded.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
