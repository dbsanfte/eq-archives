Hence I<br/>\nswore off any helm that has the plate look. Sigh, that<br/>\nmeant I won&#39;t ever be wearing a crested helm (which<br/>\nis a great helm that is found in Mistmoore). Humans<br/>\nalso look terrible in leather helms (baskethead if you<br/>\nask me), hence no executioner&#39;s hood for me (although<br/>\nit does look cool in the inventory slot) even though<br/>\nthe stats on that hood is amazing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat leaves me with two alternatives as far as I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Fine Silk Turbin - AC 10 and some bonus to Save vs <br/>\nHeat. It is dropped by Hatar (a RARE spawn in Oasis). <br/>\nHatar is a Sand Giant but a wussy one. He&#39;s only about<br/>\nlevel 23 but he hits very hard hence tough for melee<br/>\nclasses and should be quite easy for the casters (isn&#39;t<br/>\nthat always the case? Sigh) From what I&#39;ve heard he <br/>\ndrops one of three things everytime you kill him, the<br/>\nFine Silk Turbin being one of them. I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nthough. I bought mine. Oh, the most important thing,<br/>\nthe turbin is invisible.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Crown of the Froglok King - this one is going to be<br/>\na while before I get it. Off a high level mob in Lower<br/>\nGuk supposedly. I&#39;ll let you know more once I actually<br/>\nget it (don&#39;t hold your breath waiting for me, I&#39;m only<br/>\nlevel 33, Elyana will probably get hers before I do).<br/>\nIt is also invisible when worn and has a really cool<br/>\nlooking graphic for the inventory slots. I belive the<br/>\nstats on it are available in EQ&#39;lizer <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq)\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as other pieces go, I&#39;m wearing mostly store<br/>\nbought plate for the visible pieces except for the<br/>\nbracers (Serpentine, but they look exactly like plate)<br/>\nbreastplate (Mithril, I think it looks fruity purple<br/>\nbut I love the Agility bonus so I&#39;ll sacrifice some<br/>\nfashion for it) and boots (charred boots. They look <br/>\nlike black plate boots). And oh yeah, elf hide gloves<br/>\nwhich are invisible when worn. The stat bonuses on <br/>\nthose gloves are a little too good to give up for mere<br/>\nplate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do intend to get myself as close as I can to a full<br/>\nset of charred armor (black is one of my favorite<br/>\ncolors). I like a theme look but not rubicite for me,<br/>\nthank you. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else has comments on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDarrian Ashoka<br/>\n[who looks so much better when he uses the illusion<br/>\non his Guise of the Deceiver. Humans didn&#39;t get much<br/>\nin the fashion deparment from Verant IMO.]<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
