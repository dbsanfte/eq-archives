There is endless discussion<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; &quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing<br/>\n&gt; two songs<br/>\n&gt; at once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some<br/>\n&gt; sort of<br/>\n&gt; special trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves<br/>\n&gt; starting<br/>\n&gt; one song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; quickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; stopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tMy only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tDo people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; effect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of<br/>\n&gt; button<br/>\n&gt; pressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have<br/>\n&gt; failed<br/>\n&gt; entirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; icon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I<br/>\n&gt; hardly ever<br/>\n&gt; actually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually<br/>\n&gt; higher<br/>\n&gt; when I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any<br/>\n&gt; effect of<br/>\n&gt; either song!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over<br/>\n&gt; zealous but<br/>\n&gt; very talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a<br/>\n&gt; lot of you<br/>\n&gt; take seriously. <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \tI for one am going to save my fingers the busywork . . . <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Musil<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>===<br/>\n----------<br/>\nRogers Pessin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rpessin@...\">rpessin@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
