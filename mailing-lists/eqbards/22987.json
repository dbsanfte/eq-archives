Long Live The King!

The new<br/>\nguys breathed some much needed life into a dismal user interface in short<br/>\norder.  Now, maybe some other much needed changes will happen too. The fact<br/>\nthat they are even discussing ways to increase exp gains - is a good thing -<br/>\na real good thing. I dont really care what &quot;GZ&quot; ever said in the past - they<br/>\nall said lots of stuff and then turned around and did exactly the opposite<br/>\nor were just flat out wrong...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;These new epic quests have been thoroughly tested...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Kunark 50+ spells are dropping...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Bard mez spells are working right...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Selos should break root...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were wrong before - they will prolly be wrong again but at least we<br/>\ndont have the old guys with what seemed like an ingrained predjudice against<br/>\nany inference that what they just coded/designed might be not working<br/>\ncorrectly.  Programmers have a very hard time finding errors in their own<br/>\ncode because they first need to believe that an error exists.  The old guy&#39;s<br/>\n(plural - I am blanketly lumping GZ and the rest of &quot;them&quot; - whoever they<br/>\nare toegther) attitude was a major factor in a lot of problems with the game<br/>\nand Verant.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my humble opinions =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n(The Pantheon)<br/>\nTroubador, somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Donny Dane [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddane01@...\">ddane01@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 6:57 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Selos breaking root was not a bug<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ no longer works on EQ, he works on &#39;other MMORPG&#39;s&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\nSolusek Ro - 31.4th Song bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 5:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Selos breaking root was not a bug<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; GZ is gone? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
