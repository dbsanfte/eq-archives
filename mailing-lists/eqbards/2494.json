My name is Abbalar, and I&#39;m a 20&#39;th level wood elf bard on Fennin Ro. I&#39;ve been lurking for a while until I came up with something useful to post, but that last patch message on the test server piqued my interest. I&#39;ll repost the bard changes here:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant now works on monsters. \r<br/>\nTuyen&#39;s Songs have had their damage increased. \r<br/>\nNew Bard Songs have been added to vendors. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;m not high enough to comment on this, but many other people are :) Can anyone who plays on the test server confirm exactly what the new songs (and changes) are?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlso, when I got the invisibility song, I noticed a very interesting thing- the minotaur horn works with it (i.e., it acts as both brass and wind.) Is this a bug? I LOVE this- it saves me one of the precious inventory slots- but I doubt it&#39;s intentional.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAbbalar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
