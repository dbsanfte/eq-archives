Shaman was in full banded, I was in a mix of magic<br/>\narmor and some studded (boots and gloves).  My ac was higher and if I was in<br/>\nfull banded with some bronze i would be encumbered.  The only item above his<br/>\nlevel the shaman had was a glowing wooden crook (from the same mob as LJ<br/>\nvest so maybe that&#39;s what you were thinking of).  Given that they now sell<br/>\nfor 150pp it really wasn&#39;t much above his level if at all.  At 19th I could<br/>\nbuy 3 of them with my current bank account.  He still beat me last nite even<br/>\nthough I have only 2 pieces of armor now that is below banded ac, boot and<br/>\ncap.  I also have several pieces above banded.  It was a much closer fight,<br/>\nbut his 9 stuns won out over my dual wield.  If its any consolation he only<br/>\nhad 17hp&#39;s left so I could easily win at least half the duels if I got<br/>\nbetter luck.  The big problem is his natural str is 40 points higher than<br/>\nmine.  My agility is higher but that didn&#39;t seem to be enough.<br/>\nUnfortunately this is the last test I can do against this opponent.  He is<br/>\nretiring to redo his shaman and give him more points in wisdom.  He<br/>\ninitially put only 10 points in wisdom and the lack of mana is killing him<br/>\nin group fights.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe Bards eventually become better than Shamans in melee, but not at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>level<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 17.

I believe you admitted<br/>\nthat the Shaman was equipped with a LJ Vest and other items not readily<br/>\naccessible to a level 17.  You were also equipped with substandard items,<br/>\nStudded Leather for the most part.  A Bard of the 17th level should be<br/>\nwearing Full Banded with a few Bronze pieces at minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no doubt that if you did the test again with comparably equipped PCs,<br/>\nthe Bard would win just about every time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
