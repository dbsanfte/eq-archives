Thieves have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-664267881\">Reading disenchantment thread, and agree wholeheartedly, but if it&#39;s any<br/>\nconsolation, we&#39;re a jack-of-many-useless skills anyway, master of none.<br/>\nThieves have long been complaining about detect/disarm traps and pick lock.<br/>\nI rarely see any doors to be picked, though there seems to be more of those<br/>\nthan traps.  Then I&#39;ve read so many thieves complaining how most parties<br/>\nwould rather not have a thief amoung their ranks, regardless of the group&#39;s<br/>\nlevel (Bards are highly desired at one point, at least).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt got me to thinking about the classic CRPGs, how when you went to create<br/>\nyour group of adventurers, it would come down to 2 warriors, 2 spellcasters,<br/>\nbut at least one thief!  You -had- to have a thief, or at least a class that<br/>\ncould substitute for a thief like a ninja/monk type or jester/bard.  Reason<br/>\nwas: every encounter involved monsters dropping a trapped chest that needed<br/>\ndisarmed.  Hell, remember is Wizardry how my thief stood behind the<br/>\nwarriors, never fighting, just following along to pick any locks and disarm<br/>\nafter every battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what if that happened here?  Could you imagine the uproar?  :)  Say,<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s in Crushbone.  They kill one of these humanoid creatures, and any<br/>\nweapon or shield/armor the orc was wielding can be snatched up easily.  But<br/>\nthey also see a trapped chest in there, for all humanoid monsters now keep<br/>\ntheir valuables in such boxes.  Within the chest is probably just coins, but<br/>\nperhaps the orc was storing his valued shiny brass shield in that chest, not<br/>\nwielding it.  Regardless, the player can simply open the chest and set it<br/>\noff.  Either a minor explosion, poison, stun, things like that.  Nothing so<br/>\ngreat as to kill the player, but enough a threat that the player must be<br/>\ncertain things are safe in the area before they loot.  The player would then<br/>\nhave to weigh leaving the corpse there a while for safety, or someone<br/>\neventually being able to steal their prize.  I think it would make things<br/>\nmore interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a thief is in the area, even not in the other player&#39;s group, the thief<br/>\ncould just use the disarm skill on the corpse itself (not having to go in<br/>\nloot mode to see the trapped chest itself), removing the trap for the other<br/>\nfellow.  Once set off or disarmed, the box itself would vanish.  Could<br/>\nimagine said thief running around Crushbone disarming corpses to increase<br/>\nskill, instantly becoming a local hero, people sending shouts for him to<br/>\n&quot;come over here!&quot;  Do high-level magic users get a Knock spell equivalent?<br/>\nMaybe they should, maybe they shouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used the /feedback option to suggest this, doubt it&#39;ll ever happen though,<br/>\nbut remember to use that option yourself for ideas like this (and send my<br/>\nidea too if you like, maybe it&#39;ll one day happen that way).  As it stands<br/>\nnow, who cares about traps?  What, there&#39;s like one trap in the whole game?<br/>\nI like my idea because I just know how irritated it would get people, heheh.<br/>\nIn Everquest, unlike other CRPGs, a thief is not required for a<br/>\nwell-balanced party, yet I think they should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, May 21, 1999 6:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Disenchantment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I really love playing a bard, so don&#39;t get me wrong - but in light of the<br/>\n&gt;things I have been hearing on this thread it seems like maybe we should all<br/>\n&gt;get together and petition Verant to throw us bards a frickin bone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I mean, to have to wait all that time just to get the thieving skills and<br/>\n&gt;then to have them max out at 35 and 40 what use are they?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Would you really be using the sneak skill when it is maxed at 35?

Any other magic class usually has a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; variety of usefull<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;spells, and I rarely see 1 (Lets say wizrd) using the same<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4 or 5 spell<br/>\n&gt;&gt; over<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;and over again. They switch them around considering what<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the situation<br/>\n&gt;&gt; calls<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Gotta disagree here.  As an enchanter, I generally had a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; standard &quot;spell<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;kit&quot; that I seldom changed.  As a Bard my song kit is much<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the same, but as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I get more protective songs they will take some precedence.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Note one VERY important thing:  We are NOT defined by our<br/>\n&gt;&gt; songs the way<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;spellcasters are defined by their spells.  We are also middlin-fair<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;warriors (You watch a wiz try to go toe to toe with a fast<br/>\n&gt;&gt; melee mob and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;see who&#39;s still standing).  We are also the SINGLE MOST<br/>\n&gt;&gt; VERSATILE CLASS IN<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;THE GAME.  Read that sentence again.  There is NOTHING we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can&#39;t do:  pick<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;locks, disarm traps, put monsters to sleep, heal our party,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hide our party,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;take our party underwater....  Bards in EQ are the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; single-most powerful<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Bard class I&#39;ve ever played (and this is from someone who&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; played Bard in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;nearly every conceivable RPG).<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;As has been stated before, we enhance a party.  If you want<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to convert a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Bard to a mathematical formula, where fighters = 1, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spellchuckers = 1,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;and Clerics = 1, Bards = x2 multiplier.
