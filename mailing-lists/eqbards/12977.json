Coolness!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was cruising thru Runnyeye and went down to see if I could nab a BIBS<br/>\n(sword) and ran into a 50 druid who was camping for a BIC (crown).  We<br/>\nchatted and I offered my BIC as trade bait but we could not agree - so in<br/>\nthe end I just gave him the BIC and said &quot;you can owe me one...&quot;  Hehe,<br/>\nwell, he decided he did not wanna be in debt so he gave me a butler tooth!<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking around in my guild I found that a druid had 2 maid&#39;s teeth and a<br/>\nwarrior had a butler tooth. So, I traded my butler for a maid and gave the<br/>\nmaid to the warrior.  Hehe, so now they each got the stuff to make EBW&#39;s.<br/>\nToo bad they are no drops that don&#39;t proc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. everyone in our guild is now 2YK compliant &lt;eg&gt; including yours truly!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, January 11, 2000 6:27 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Got my Waki!
