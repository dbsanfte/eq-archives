Do they<br/>\nthink we won&#39;t notice if they don&#39;t say anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone doesn&#39;t read the patch messages, and they get stuck, then it&#39;s<br/>\nthier own fault, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant always says how they think through every change thoroughly, but these<br/>\nseem to have skipped that process. How hard is it to foresee the problems<br/>\npeople would have, especially with the Box? And if these decisions were so<br/>\nwell though out, why did they reverse them so quickly?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all seems rather obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAranlas Starchaser<br/>\nSongweaver of Tunare<br/>\n(Mithaniel Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSent: 9/16/99 4:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: revenge is sweet you know...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 16 Sep 1999, Mike Roach wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; however, that if you are high enough level to have that kind of item,<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t have all that much trouble replacing it with something<br/>\ndecent,<br/>\n&gt; (not from fear plane of course ;-) again (as in the box) fair warning<br/>\nwould<br/>\n&gt; have resolved this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that simple.
