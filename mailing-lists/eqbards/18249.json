Black <br/>\nReaver. It was a TOUGH yellow-con (to a 51) golem-like thing, 100% magic <br/>\nresistant, seemed to have well over 15K hits. We are all about to rejoice <br/>\nover killing it after our cleric had gone OOM from a string of complete <br/>\nheals on the main tank when *poof* a NEW Black Reaver spawned from the <br/>\ncorpse of the old one! This totally caught us off guard. Me and the warrior <br/>\nheld it off while our cleric and rogue camped and the monk feigned. I died <br/>\nof course. We did loot the old one and get a nice Jade bladed Axe off it. We <br/>\nwere again surprised when we found that the old reaver corpse had become the <br/>\nhome point for the newly spawned Reaver. We originally had thought it was <br/>\ncorpse camping. So we had the monk pull the reaver away right as our guys <br/>\nlogged in and ran from it&#39;s home point. The monk died tho. =(<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used sneak/hide to get mine and the warrior&#39;s corpse to safety, and <br/>\nrecruited a necromancer to help fight the new Reaver. We prepped and <br/>\nattacked it. The necro tried a couple spells with 100% resist (we were <br/>\nhoping it might be suceptible to disease, but no go), so she just had her <br/>\npet lay into it while she twitched out cleric&#39;s mana. This time, the thing <br/>\nwas a blue con, and our cleric came out of the fight with 60 mana left <br/>\n(post-twitching).<br/>\n<br/>\nHoly shit, a new mob sprang forth from the second corpse! This time it was a <br/>\nyellow-con Iksar ghost named Lord Ghiosk (sp?). He had mass hp, but only hit <br/>\nfor 160&#39;s. Still, took all of our cleric&#39;s mana to kill him, with mrs. necro <br/>\ntwitching the hell out of her mana. We dropped it after what seemed forever, <br/>\nand looted a Throneblade of the Ykesha. This item went to the warrior for <br/>\nhis hard work tanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say, this was the most intense and exciting fight I have ever <br/>\nexperienced on Kunark as of yet. It ranked up there with my first dragon <br/>\nslaying, actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I got Sionachie&#39;s Partisan this morning. Thing looks nutty. Piercing, <br/>\n9/19 +6 CHA +2 INT +5 Magic. From a Caller of Sathir in Karnor&#39;s. We also <br/>\ngot a gold shield with a dragon emblem (I forget the name of this item) from <br/>\nChardok off an Aruspex. AC 25 plus a bajillion stat buffs. The friggin thing <br/>\nis better than Bladestopper, easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Kunark is crazy as far as loot goes, but I&#39;m stil havin a lot of fun <br/>\nthere. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad&lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n51st Gangsta-G, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Kunark: first impressions<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 26 Apr 2000 19:23:49 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;we went over and killed some stuff and got a bunch of phat lewt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;come on with all these good stories we need the powergamer perspective! =P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our younger bard Taneran made his way across the great ocean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a brave band of adventures for the first time yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
