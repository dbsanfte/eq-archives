It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s a fix for the horribly broken EXP <br/>\nsystem we&#39;ve been playing under.  It benefits everybody.  Arguably, <br/>\nthe biggest boost for Hybrids is not the extra EXP they will attain <br/>\nwith each kill, but the fact that they&#39;ll have a MUCH easier time <br/>\nfinding EXP groups now that the group doesn&#39;t share their penalty.  <br/>\nTHAT, imo, was the biggest injustice of them all.  Many Hybrids would <br/>\nhave been willing to shoulder the whole load of their exp penalties, <br/>\nbecause THEY chose it, and not burden the group with it.  Now, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to.. plus, they get a nice EXP bonus to go with it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
