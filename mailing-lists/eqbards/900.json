When I first bought it a<br/>\nlevel 15, I was unable to lull even a widow hatchling.  To me that is kind<br/>\nof useless.  Perhaps I have improved.  As for finding better friends, I<br/>\nhave tried but it is hard at the moment.  I am in an inbetween situation.<br/>\nAll of my friends are either in teh 12-14 range or in the 18 and above<br/>\nrange.  It usually makes it hard for me adventure forth.  I am just hoping<br/>\nthat this lack of people wishing to party witha bard does not get any<br/>\nworse.  I am more of a social player if I get in a good group, but those<br/>\nare so hard to find nowadays.  Either you bump into power gamers who steal<br/>\nkills and train you to death, or you find those newbies who constantly ask<br/>\nyou to help them find your corpse ).  As a level 16 bard, what is the best<br/>\nplace for exp?  I usually solo at this point and would like to find a<br/>\nplace that gives really good exp and decent loot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW Did people actually right in a character description in their<br/>\ncharacter screen?  I have and nobody looks at it.  They just query my<br/>\narmor and then run away.  It frustrates me so because I have been trying<br/>\nto roleplay my characters background.  Perhaps it is a time to compose a<br/>\ntune to sing everytime I have time to myself, emoting doesn&#39;t even seem to<br/>\ngive a hint to anyone at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin - Karana - Bard of the 16th Rank</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
