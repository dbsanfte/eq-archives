I always request<br/>\n&gt; people in my group to use the /assist command before we start engaging<br/>\n&gt; enemies.  Almost everytime I do that someone comes back and asks &quot;What is<br/>\n&gt; the /assist command? It isn&#39;t on the Socials menu.&quot;   After I tell them what<br/>\n&gt; it does, generally their next response is &quot;Cool, I didn&#39;t know you could do<br/>\n&gt; that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The people in my party use /assist all the time, and we&#39;ve found it to be very<br/>\nvery buggy.
