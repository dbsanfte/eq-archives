You&#39;re over-analyzing this though.  All they&#39;d have to do is add one flag to the client and one check to the drop process.  All in all roughly 4 lines of code to do it clunky.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Flag on client<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd Flag<br/>\n<br/>\nCanDropItems = Binary<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd code to drop check<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen clicking in view area<br/>\nIf Isareaempty = no then opentradewindow<br/>\nElse<br/>\nIf CanDropItems = No then keepitemonmouse<br/>\nElse<br/>\nDrop Item<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t the most elegant pseudocode but it should get the idea across.  Sure I may not have their exact process down but this would be a VERY easy patch to put in regardless of how they have it coded.  Even if the hook isn&#39;t already there it&#39;s 1 flag easily added to the engine.   It&#39;s not a major change to how the engine works.  They added the Destroy box in a 40kb patch during beta and I guarantee that wasn&#39;t in the client then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, Gordon has stated on at least 2 occasions that I can recall that they have something like this on the &quot;list&quot; but it&#39;s not high priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
