But as you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; went from 25 to 50 you&#39;d lose str, dex, sta, agi, and maybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; int while gaining wis.  There are actually systems that do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this, usually coupling older (decreased stats) with wiser<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (more skills) and vice versa.  But that&#39;s beyond the scope of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The way I&#39;d look at it would be that level 50 is (currently) the &quot;prime&quot; of<br/>\n&gt; a player. The player is the best they can be so to speak. So this would be<br/>\n&gt; the prime time of their life. The same would go to 75 if that&#39;s what the cap<br/>\n&gt; was raised to. I don&#39;t agree with the curve from low at 1 to high at 25 to<br/>\n&gt; low at 50 again. 50 is when you&#39;re at your peak so to speak in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well then I would say don&#39;t use reality as an argument to back<br/>\nup your stance then.

It may seem different, but as<br/>\nI mentioned, it&#39;s by far the norm in RPGs.  Think of it as<br/>\nstarting level 1 when you&#39;re at your peak, and never suffering<br/>\nthe effects of aging.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not saying people should be able to raise their skills to<br/>\n&gt; uncomprehendable numbers with skill points, but they should be able to raise<br/>\n&gt; them to their natural maximums over time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ack!
