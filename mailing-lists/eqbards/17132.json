Since the servers had been repopped, there were raids planned on<br/>\nPrexus to simultaneously take out Vox and Naggy.  I got invited into the Vox<br/>\nrun (my second dragon invite, first time I accepted).  This focus of the Vox<br/>\nraid seemed to be to give a bunch of people who had never seen a dragon a<br/>\nchance to kill one, with which dragon politics being what they are seem<br/>\npretty darn reasonable ;).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up with 6 full groups and proceeded to the &quot;buff point&quot; to prepare<br/>\nto engage Vox.  *Sign #1* Bert and another server go down, the chat server<br/>\nfills up and we find ourselves unable to create a chat room and proceed with<br/>\nbuffing.  After about an hour or hour and a half, the servers come back up<br/>\nand the chat server goes back to semi-normal operation.  We start buffing<br/>\nwith only one buff party which tends to go extremely slow when you have<br/>\nabout 40 people to buff.  Then another shaman shows up and we put together<br/>\nanother buffing party (listen to this one: shaman dies, necro summons corpse<br/>\nto buff spot, shaman gets res, hehe, shaman joins us past the giants :) ).<br/>\nFinally we are all buffed and camped out by around 11:00PM.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all logged back in, created groups and charged Vox!  Being a bard, of<br/>\ncourse I was assigned a tank party, although my party was practically all<br/>\nfirst timers.  With the initial hit of dragon breath, every member of my<br/>\nparty but 2 tanks goes LD.  By about the 4 wave of breath and I was the only<br/>\nnon-Link Dead member of my party left.  Hehe, I lasted until she was about<br/>\n15% alive before I finally dropped (my songs seemed to do great).  Only<br/>\nthing I can think of is that my party didn&#39;t head the advice to turn off ALL<br/>\nchat including NPC spells :(.  At about 5%, Vox got off a complete heal and<br/>\nthen got trained to the bind point and proceeded to wreak major chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout an hour and a half later, corpse recovery is complete and we decide to<br/>\ncall it a night and go after Vox again the next night.  I get a teleport to<br/>\nLavastorm when a second try on Naggy is currently being organized.  Hehe, I<br/>\nget an invite into this one as well (bards! hehe).  Figure, what the heck, I<br/>\nwanna see a dead dragon!  We head on in through the Fire Giant palace and<br/>\nproceed to buff up and camp.  By now, we are pushing 4AM.  *Sign #2* We get<br/>\norganized, and then log back in to go after Naggy only to find that one of<br/>\nthe clerics for the tank group disappeared (probably fell asleep in the chat<br/>\nroom).  We proceed to camp out again to wait for a replacement cleric to<br/>\nshow.  Cleric arrives at Sol B and *Sign #3* Cerfnet goes belly up and all<br/>\nthe server goes down.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I&#39;m currently camped at the entrance to Naggy&#39;s lair with a full<br/>\nrespawn of Fire Giants just waiting to pound on me when I log back in :).<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping I&#39;m going to get a shot at at least one of the 2 dragons again<br/>\ntonight :).  Hopefully it will go more smoothly this time :).<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 46th Song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
