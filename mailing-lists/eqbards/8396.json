I think GZ needs more <br/>\n&gt; specifics than this<br/>\n&gt; letter will include.  The goal is to raise the general level <br/>\n&gt; of awareness of our<br/>\n&gt; class to the team in general.  We&#39;ve all noticed that <br/>\n&gt; warriors, rogues, and<br/>\n&gt; rangers get alot of tinkering.  My guess...large player base, <br/>\n&gt; large amount of<br/>\n&gt; feedback (or in the rogue&#39;s case, very broken and <br/>\n&gt; embarrassing).  So, since<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re such a small group I&#39;m hoping to do a little PR with <br/>\n&gt; the big guy and have<br/>\n&gt; him and his team think on us a bit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone out there have a list of the songs that still aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; implemented?  Are<br/>\n&gt; there any?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Golias, Solusek Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
