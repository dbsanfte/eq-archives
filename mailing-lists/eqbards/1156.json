The icon is a red-background Disenchant symbol, so my first guess on <br/>\nthat would be a targeted Disenchant to de-buff enemies (or maybe de-charm <br/>\nfriends?).  If it can remove charm, it could be very handy against certain <br/>\ncreatures.  (I just love getting beat up by my own party&#39;s Monk when <br/>\nfighting the Diviner in Cazic...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, the song is in Freeport by the way.  There are new songs in Kelethin, <br/>\nFreeport, and Erudin.  I haven&#39;t had the chance to check Qeynos or Highpass <br/>\nyet.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
