Now, last <br/>\ntime I visited the Bard Guild, my trainer didn&#39;t offer me 2hs as a <br/>\nskill, and I&#39;ve always heard that 2HS is not available to bards <br/>\nanyway, YET I can and have wielded this thing!  In truth, using this <br/>\nis not as effective as my Drachnid Leg Tip, but I think it&#39;s because <br/>\nBards are NOT ABLE to increase their 2HS skill.  Also, the only time <br/>\nI do any REAL damage (25-28 per hit!) is when I&#39;m whistling the war <br/>\nsong, otherwise I rarely hit above 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any information on this?  Have any bards been able <br/>\nto establish and improve a 2HS skill?  If so, bards just got a GREAT <br/>\nsoloing weapon!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rolaleil<br/>\nBard of the 15th Song<br/>\nE&#39;ci Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
