Now,<br/>\n&gt;lullaby is a bit of a different manner.  I played punching<br/>\n&gt;bag for someone one, by doing this to the two orcs<br/>\n&gt;that jumped him, and I believe it was OBVIOUS that I<br/>\n&gt;was not attacking, as I just stood and played, without<br/>\n&gt;swinging back :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The one thing I would love to see (but probably won&#39;t,<br/>\n&gt;for balance reasons) is for a small set of our beneficial<br/>\n&gt;songs (Chant, Hymm, the Psalms) to work on a<br/>\n&gt;targeted, non-grouped PC.  I consistently invite people<br/>\n&gt;sitting and healing to share my song, while I&#39;m healing,<br/>\n&gt;but you can only do that when you&#39;re solo.  I saved<br/>\n&gt;someone from poison the other day, but I had to group<br/>\n&gt;with him first, and if I&#39;d been grouped he would have<br/>\n&gt;died (I&#39;ve intended to get my bind wounds skill up for a<br/>\n&gt;while now, I just haven&#39;t had time).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tindayen, Journeyman Bard of Povar<br/>\n&gt;Swifthawk Apprentice Shaman of the far north </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
