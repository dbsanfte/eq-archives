I was camping the Spirit room in Unrest and the<br/>\nmobs were coming more or less continuously at some points.  With a<br/>\ncompentent cleric in the group he was medding constantly and only standing<br/>\nup to heal before diving back into his book.  The amount of melee damage<br/>\nthat the warrior, paladin, druid and I was dishing out was fine.  Anthem,<br/>\nPsalm, etc. wouldn&#39;t have contributed enough to justify denying the cleric<br/>\nClarity.  This cleric was calling &quot;2 mins to heal&quot;, &quot;1 min to heal&quot;, &quot;30<br/>\nsecs to heal&quot; and kept us informed the whole time.  It was wonderful.  The<br/>\nonly time I felt obligated to play something else was when a Hag joined the<br/>\nparty.  Then I twisted MR buffs and threw in the occassional (resisted)<br/>\nPixie Strike.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know it really gets my goat that a friggin&#39; blue undead resists me again<br/>\nand again and again.  The live lizzies in Cazic hardly ever resist Strike.<br/>\nI guess undead mobs are just different though, cause the ones in Kith resist<br/>\nPS routinely as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I have to pick one song to sing, it&#39;s probably Lullaby (which<br/>\n&gt; impressed the heck out of a bunch of level 42-50s in Lower Guk the other<br/>\n&gt; night - I was level 34 at the time).
