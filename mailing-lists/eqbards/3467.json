I mean a good check is usually<br/>\nthis:  What would happen if all the casters in the game suddenly decided not<br/>\nto bind anyone they did not know personally?  There are already many casters<br/>\nwho hate being bothered about getting a bind, the fact that non-casters have<br/>\nno choice but to beg for a bind notwithstanding.  If a skill is so necessary<br/>\nto continued play that refusal to grant it by a particular group of players<br/>\nwould wreck the game, you have a problem.  Maybe not one that will ever<br/>\nhappen given the number of available players, but try getting bound on the<br/>\ntest server.  With only 200 players on there at all, who you gonna find to<br/>\nbind you?  Nobody, plain and simple.  That&#39;s why I stopped playing there,<br/>\nthough I may try again.

Actually it annoys me that<br/>\nALL the casters get bind, then on top of that it annoys me that casters can<br/>\nbind anywhere, where as noncasters can only bind in cities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best happy medium I can think of is allow anyone to bind at Inns &<br/>\nTaverns, but still only casters can cast bind.  Also, take away the bind<br/>\nanywhere ability of the casters (forcing them to bind at the inns as well).<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dan Harmon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deharmon@...\">deharmon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 5:19 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bards and Binding<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Dan Harmon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deharmon@...\">deharmon@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t know, if I thought about it I&#39;m sure I could come up with some<br/>\n&gt;perfectly reasonable argument that my magician should get SoW at lvl<br/>\n&gt;5...just for himself.
