Initally in the lower levels 1-6 I found this spell to be a<br/>\ngreat way to kill myself, either in attracting that ever popular guard you<br/>\nforgot patrolled your area of the incredible &quot;there he is that guy, everyone<br/>\nget him!&quot; attraction feature of this song.  But lately at 9th I&#39;ve had alot<br/>\nof fun practicing my String skill and nuking lvl 1 characters in the newbie<br/>\nareas of freeport.  But I&#39;m curious just how much damage does this song<br/>\nactually do anyways?  I&#39;ve been using it more and more in the desert taking<br/>\nspiders and such.  Makes for a great helper if you think you&#39;re not gonna<br/>\nmake it out alive.  Sure you have to be sure nothing else is around<br/>\notherwise you&#39;ll be double/tripple teamed by creatures but even still I<br/>\nfinally feel like its a useful spell.  Also in a party does this spell also<br/>\ndo damage to members in your party as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nGediprime, of Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
