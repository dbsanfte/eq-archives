I was playing my lvl 14 mage to help a<br/>\nguildmember catch up to my lvl 20 bard.  We were camped out at the Orc<br/>\nCamp in West Common and had this level 17+ character stealing our kills.<br/>\nThe only reason why this situation was considered harassment was the fact<br/>\nthat this idiot actually told my group that we had to sell our orc belts<br/>\nto him or else he would proceed to kill every orc until he had sufficient<br/>\norc belts for his cause.  After discussing this with a guide, this is<br/>\ndefinitely harassment.  Kill stealing on the other hand is not.  The<br/>\nargument that all kill stealers use is the fact that there was no order,<br/>\nor I need that item for a friend or the ever favourite well I began<br/>\ncasting when you attacked.  To me, Verant&#39;s stand on kill stealing is too<br/>\nbad it is  a fact of life and hopefully these people will learn later on,<br/>\nwhen no one will party with them.  Well I have yet to see any problem with<br/>\nthis, I have seen many people who have kill stole consistently and<br/>\npredictably have no problems with grouping, in fact they are in a guild.<br/>\nSo there is no punishment for his actions ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Bard of Kelethin<br/>\nAariel Mage of Felwithe<br/>\nKarana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
