Doesn&#39;t mean that guy hitting his few<br/>\nbuttons couldn&#39;t do what I do, just that he doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main point is.  Bards can do more different things than any other class,<br/>\nnot more of any one thing than any other class.  This versatility does not<br/>\ntranslate into greater power.  In this game being powerful means being more<br/>\nable to gain xp, pp, items.  Bards can help set groups gain these things<br/>\nfaster, but in most if not all of these cases there is another class that<br/>\ncould help them gain these things even faster.  I would argue this is true<br/>\nin all cases except with manasong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe majority of the things bards can do are flashy, subtle, intriguing, and<br/>\npretty cool.  But powerful?  not really.  DDD is even more useless than<br/>\nmost.  John Kim has already presented multiple examples of how a shaman can<br/>\nkeep an entire party of melee characters more enhanced than a bard can<br/>\nindefinitely.  Clearly any other melee class can provide better offensive<br/>\nweapon and tanking support than we can.  Clearly any druid or necro can do<br/>\nmore DoT damage than we can, effectively indefinitely.  Clearly an enchanter<br/>\ncan CC far more effectively than we can.  Our sole advantage is our ability<br/>\nto do some of all these things.  I just disagree that the advantage<br/>\noutweighs the weakness of doing all of them individually so much more poorly<br/>\nthan the primary users can.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
