Instead of spending the time and effort to<br/>\n&gt; offer meaningful responses, we get a flame.

But the fact that he<br/>\nresponded to your message while there were two substantive posts hanging out on the first page for more<br/>\nthan a week (that nobody has responded to in any way at all) didn&#39;t help my mood any.  And he didn&#39;t even<br/>\naddress the more salient parts of YOUR post...   You have nothing to apologize for.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 43 songs (again), Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
