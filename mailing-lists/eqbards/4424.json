(how&#39;s Finland these days) But I am curious how you <br/>\n     came to the Damage +1 equaling the average damage potential of a <br/>\n     weapon.  I pretty sure your right, from observed damage while playing <br/>\n     but is there something you know that confirms this.  For example do <br/>\n     you know how to calculate Max damage?<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Thanks,<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Ron Talbot<br/>\n     Bujold  18th<br/>\n     Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n     <br/>\n  Ok, I still don&#39;t understand why I seem to be the only one that is<br/>\nnoticing what is wrong with the damned formula for weapon <br/>\nefficiency used just about everywhere. That max damage / delay. <br/>\nYou don&#39;t do max damage with a weapon.. you do _average_ <br/>\ndamage. Yes dex and str and skill will make it closer to max <br/>\nmore often, but on those battles where damage efficiency<br/>\nreally counts as anything (meaning a tough foe, if its a real wimp <br/>\nwho cares what you wield, you sing back more health probably<br/>\nthan what it can do to you) you are doing really rarely max damage. <br/>\nNow change the formula to damage+1 / delay and it represents<br/>\nthe average damage. And better yet to ease it out, do the reverse <br/>\ncalculation of delay/dmg+1 and it is way easier to check efficiencies <br/>\nin your head without a calculator ;)<br/>\n     <br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a><br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nHow do you enter ONElist s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\nBy joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
