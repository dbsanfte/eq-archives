I am incapable of such things as simple<br/>\nhousehold repairs or things like changing my own oil...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat said - there&#39;s only two reasons I can see to buy (as opposed to<br/>\nbuilding) a PC is if you are so strapped for time - that paying additional<br/>\nmoney to save time is worthwhile to you.  Building a PC now in my mind is<br/>\nequivalent to the change in buying stereo components as opposed to the<br/>\nconsole systems that were popular up to the late 70&#39;s.  The second reason is<br/>\ntech support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMounting the motherboard is a bit tricky the first time you&#39;ve done one.<br/>\nLining up the drives in the drive bays can also be a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow - if you&#39;ve owned a PC or two and never ever called the tech support<br/>\nline - and you have some time to spare - you are throwing money away buying<br/>\na Compaq, Gateway, Dell etc.  It&#39;s amazing how powerful the low-end chips<br/>\nare now (Celeron, Duron&#39;s etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA good buddy of mine (formerly professional musician, now in property<br/>\nmanagement - very non-technical) is consulting me for advice on a new PC<br/>\n(he&#39;s helped others build them before).  He&#39;s getting a new case,<br/>\nmotherboard, Duron 500, 128 MB of PC133 memory.  This will cost between<br/>\n$300-400.  He&#39;s using his old Hard Disk, Voodoo3 3000 PCI, SoundBlaster,<br/>\nFloppy, and Modem.  He can upgrade each piece at his convenience.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA couple months ago I spent less than $1700 to build a high-end Athlon 800<br/>\nbox that would have cost close to thousand more to buy the equivalent box<br/>\nfrom a Big-name (or even small name) PC company.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
