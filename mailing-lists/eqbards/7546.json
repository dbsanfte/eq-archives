I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s entirely due to (malicious) intent by Verant<br/>\neither - stuff like class balance in a level-based game isn&#39;t<br/>\nthe easiest thing to anticipate at the design or even beta<br/>\nphase.  You can rant and rave all you like about how much you<br/>\nhate it, but it will probably always be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; above. Why should they spend months unhappy just to<br/>\n&gt; hope that one day things might be better? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to spend months unhappy.  If you don&#39;t like it,<br/>\ndon&#39;t do it.  I agree it&#39;s unfortunate that they didn&#39;t list<br/>\nout all the strengths and weaknesses of the classes at<br/>\ndifferent levels in the manual, but I honestly believe even<br/>\nVerant didn&#39;t really know what these strengths and weaknesses<br/>\nwould be in the final release version of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You don&#39;t do it in real life given a choice, nor should<br/>\n&gt; you have to in a game you&#39;re supposed to be playing to<br/>\n&gt; HAVE FUN in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Real life isn&#39;t level-based.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If someone hates the way something works, very rarely<br/>\n&gt; does &quot;wait, it will get better&quot; offer them any comfort<br/>\n&gt; or reason to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, let me rephrase what I said:  Having a well balanced group<br/>\nbecomes more important at later levels.  I wasn&#39;t telling you<br/>\nto wait because it&#39;ll get better.  I was simply saying that<br/>\ncasters may seem to be the best class to play at lower levels,<br/>\nbut at high levels it&#39;s important to have a tank or four, to<br/>\nenlighten you to a potential mistake you could be making now<br/>\nbecause level-based systems suck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; change in the 30s.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally speaking, I&#39;ll have given up my bard long<br/>\n&gt; before I ever come close to that level. It&#39;s already<br/>\n&gt; starting to lose it&#39;s luster to me at 18. I keep,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you and your friends are never going to reach the 30s, then<br/>\nthere&#39;s no point to planning that far ahead.  You will do fine<br/>\nplaying (mostly) casters.  I don&#39;t see Verant fixing the<br/>\ncaster/melee imbalance at low levels; if anything they&#39;ve<br/>\nactually made it worse since release.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that? All the other players I play have bind. If I<br/>\n&gt; remember correctly, wasn&#39;t it you John that said (awhile<br/>\n&gt; ago on this list) that if you started over you&#39;d never<br/>\n&gt; play a non-binding class again?   (grin)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wasn&#39;t me.  I honestly don&#39;t care about binding except when<br/>\nthat stupid boat trip is involved.  I&#39;ve played in the Karanas<br/>\nwhile bound in Freeport.  I&#39;ve played in Cazic bound in Halas.<br/>\nHeck, a lot of times I don&#39;t even remember where I&#39;m bound.<br/>\nThe bard is the non-binder *least* affected by this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; impressed. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve never used<br/>\n&gt; them before. *shrug* But that combined with not being<br/>\n&gt; able to bind make the class that less interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Obviously being able to bind is of paramount importance to<br/>\nyou, while it isn&#39;t to others.  Either play classes who can<br/>\nbind, or complain to Verant about it.  While the discussion<br/>\nhere has been stimulating, it&#39;s all pointless if Verant never<br/>\nsees it.  There&#39;s not much to gain arguing it with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
