As obviously<br/>\nwe couldn&#39;t do much serious adventuring with L1 characters for those<br/>\nvisiting from other server, I thought the alternative would be to do<br/>\nsomething silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the silliest (and fun looking) thing I&#39;ve seen done so far is the<br/>\nnaked troll race. While I wouldn&#39;t want to steal that particular idea, I<br/>\nthink borrowing the concept is ok, so what I had in mind was something<br/>\ncalled the March of the Lemmings. The idea would be to all create L1<br/>\ngnomes and march all across Faydwer, take the boat to Freeport, then go<br/>\nup to Lavastorm and jump off the edge of the Solusek crater into the<br/>\nmolten lava. However, if someone can come up with a sillier or less<br/>\nderivitive idea, I&#39;m certainly open to that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone interested? How many people are on the list now?
