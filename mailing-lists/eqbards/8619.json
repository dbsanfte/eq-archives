When I<br/>\ngot to Lower Guk there was a party camping the assasin room and several<br/>\npeople in the group didn&#39;t have a Guise yet and were unwilling to let me<br/>\npurchase looting rights.  They even laughed when I offered to give PP for<br/>\nit.  At their level PP was worthless.  One of them told me he would have<br/>\nconsidered letting me loot the Guise if I had something of value to trade<br/>\nhim.  The problem with this is that there aren&#39;t too many items a 25th level<br/>\nplayer can obtain that a 35+ level player doesn&#39;t already have.  Guess I<br/>\nwill just have to wait until I&#39;m in my 30s and get one for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; \t\tThats a good idea.  I&#39;m certain that with either my charm or<br/>\n&gt; my cash,<br/>\n&gt; \t\tsomeone will let me loot the Guise.  My main concern though<br/>\n&gt; is not getting<br/>\n&gt; \t\tkilled while I&#39;m down there.  Any suggestions on how a 24<br/>\n&gt; bard can pull this<br/>\n&gt; \t\toff?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; Step number one, if you get down there and a group is<br/>\n&gt; camping the mob that<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; drops the guise<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; (Assassin? I don&#39;t remember) is to just ask if they would<br/>\n&gt; mind if you<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; looted it.  Be creative,<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; offer to sing them a song or something in exchange for it.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; Chances are, they&#39;re nice people who all have masks anyway<br/>\n&gt; and just want<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; to pull Serrated Bone<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; Dirks and they&#39;ll happily let you loot the mask if you<br/>\n&gt; entertain them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
