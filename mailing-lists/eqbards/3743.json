I&#39;ve heard from Beta friends that this particular double standard<br/>\nwas implemented back in beta because some spellcasters were levitating<br/>\nthemselves, running off the nearest cliff, and shelling mobs with direct<br/>\ndamage spells from what effectively constituted as a &#39;safe zone&#39;. To fix<br/>\nthis they enabled mobs to attack you across any vertical distance.<br/>\n\tI suppose there could be two additional solutions to correct this<br/>\ninconsistency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1. Disallow casting when levitated. Nah. That would totally screw over<br/>\ncasters in the plane of Air as I understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t2. Allow players to attack mobs across any vertical distance. Possible,<br/>\neven if it is not really realistic. Imagine a warrior on the ground<br/>\nunderneath the Aviak Village in South Karana hitting aviaks up in the<br/>\nhighest building. =/<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n8)[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Thursday, July 15, 1999 11:50 AM<br/>\n8)To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n8)Subject: RE: [eqbards] More OT stuff: Invisibility<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)You should be able to.
