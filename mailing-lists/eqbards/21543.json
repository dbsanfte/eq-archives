Turn it in to the *MALE* banker in FV.  He will then give<br/>\nyou a 6-slot container with a combine button for the coins.<br/>\nSince you already have the ones from Dalnir&#39;s and Kaesora, we&#39;ll skip those.<br/>\nCity of Mist- One drops from the Captian of the Watch (or something like<br/>\nthat, I lost my detailed list :o/ )<br/>\nEmerald Jungle- Must be Foraged for.  Grab a nearby druid and exchange a lil<br/>\nmana for the foraging ;o)<br/>\nLake of Ill Omen- The Bloodgill gobbies in the lake (look at the base of the<br/>\npillars around the center of the lake) carry these, and are probably the<br/>\ntoughest creatures you&#39;ll have to fight in this quest.<br/>\nThe Overthere-  Check out the big pit in the center of the zone and kill a<br/>\nscorpoid (can&#39;t remember the exact name, but it&#39;s the rarer of the two kinds<br/>\nof scorpions in the pit).<br/>\n-all of these coins are fairly common drops-<br/>\nPut them in the box the banker gave you, hit combine (now it looks like a<br/>\ntreasure chest), give it to him, and Voila!  you have a Nostrolo&#39;s Tamborine<br/>\n(and you will notice the difference IMMEDIATELY).<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE:  Make *SURE* you have an empty spot in you general inventory for when<br/>\nhe gives you the box for the gem (not sure about the tamborine, but always a<br/>\ngood idea).  If your inventory slots are full, you will get the &quot;dropped to<br/>\nthe ground message&quot; but the box will be gone (ie: time to head back to<br/>\nErudin again).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\nOn Strike<br/>\n(Remember, the Bard strike hits Bertoxxulous server *THIS* weekend in<br/>\nKelethin (at PoD), at 9PM CST)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
