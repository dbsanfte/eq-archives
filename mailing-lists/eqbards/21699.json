At the time I ran into the jail and found that they couldn&#39;t come out <br/>\nand get you, I figured that this made sense since they were all locked in <br/>\ntheir cells. I didn&#39;t see this as an &quot;exploit&quot; in the sense that this is a <br/>\nbug that you are exploiting. Someone at Verant had to put in the code to <br/>\nlock the 3 mobs in their cells, and figured that this was just a part of <br/>\ntheir world. The cells won&#39;t make you rich, you&#39;ll get exp, but not at a <br/>\nrate as fast as you could with a group you could get into at your level.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, you are right in the sense that the melee mobs are easy to kick <br/>\nwith no danger whatsoever to the person doing this. However, the casting <br/>\nmobs still cast at you even after the door closes. If you have 3 casters in <br/>\nthe cells, you are getting blasted by 2-3 of them. At least for a bard in <br/>\nthis room, you have a pretty decent chance of dying if you are soloing. <br/>\nWith a partner, it&#39;d be pretty easy, but it&#39;s only 3 spawns so it&#39;s kind of <br/>\nslow. I just figured this was part of their game balance. I got bored with <br/>\nit and have found more fun things to do with my limited time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt I&#39;d be banned for hunting there. If Verant sees this as a problem, <br/>\nthen one of their programmers can just unchain them. It&#39;s different than <br/>\nthe Cazic Thule exploits which relied on bad pathing or the rooftop exploit <br/>\nwhere the players found the mobs wouldn&#39;t chase them. In the jail, I open <br/>\nthe door, they yell at me and some cast at me. I dot them over and over and <br/>\ntake what spells they could cast. The melee mobs are SOL against me. If <br/>\nthis wasn&#39;t part of the game design, then they can change it. Would I have <br/>\nany problem with them changing it? Nope. Ultimately, I was just sharing <br/>\nwith you all places that I&#39;ve hunted at this level. I didn&#39;t see it as a <br/>\nbig exploit since melee classes still have to contend with the melee mobs. <br/>\nFor bards and casters this is a nice place. That&#39;s all I have to say on the <br/>\nmatter.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:16 PM 10/5/00 -0600, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Always wondered about &#39;exploits&#39; like this.
