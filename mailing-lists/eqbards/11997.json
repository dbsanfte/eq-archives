These are all people I play with all the time so the chance they<br/>\n&gt; mistyped something is nil.  Heck, I work with 3 of them.  I told my friend<br/>\n&gt; to send me another /tell as soon as he got off his phone.  I waited for 15<br/>\n&gt; minutes and never saw anything.  I think he gave up in disgust as it was<br/>\n&gt; getting late, but he hasn&#39;t answered my email yet so I don&#39;t know for<br/>\n&gt; certain.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else experienced any problems with this or am I the only one<br/>\n&gt; &#39;going deaf&#39;?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
