Not certain how rare the drop is so I guess<br/>\n&gt; not looting one on five<br/>\n&gt; attempts is nothing to get too concerned over.  Its<br/>\n&gt; just a nuisiance at this<br/>\n&gt; point.  IIRC, someone posted a long time ago on the<br/>\n&gt; list a method to<br/>\n&gt; guarantee a griffenne would spawn.  The poster<br/>\n&gt; mentioned a /loc to go to<br/>\n&gt; somewhere in NK.  Does anyone remember the details<br/>\n&gt; of this post?  Also, I<br/>\n&gt; recall someone saying that the only mobs who were<br/>\n&gt; placeholders for<br/>\n&gt; griffennes were griffawns.  Killing the other mobs<br/>\n&gt; in NK will not increase<br/>\n&gt; the chances of getting a griffenne to spawn.  Is<br/>\n&gt; that true?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages with Yahoo!
