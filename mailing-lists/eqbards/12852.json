The guy that took<br/>\n  it is a very well known, well respected leader on our server.<br/>\n  He and I get along very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That said...<br/>\n<br/>\n  People who accidentally loot very important nodrop items are likely<br/>\n  to find themselves not ever looting again.  I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve<br/>\n  ever seen it done until that night, as people are usually very good<br/>\n  at looting appropriately.  One poor cleric accidentally looted the<br/>\n  crown from Tranix one night, and he caught major hell for it.  He<br/>\n  wasn&#39;t a bad guy, in fact he&#39;s an incredible cleric.  But the accident<br/>\n  cost several enchanters a new headpiece.  It&#39;s nothing more than <br/>\n  irritating I guess you could put it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was invited into the Plane by a separate group than the group he<br/>\n  was in.  I didn&#39;t realize this at first.  Apparently, his team was<br/>\n  breaking out hate, and another team came in behind them (the team<br/>\n  who requested me up there).  So there was definitely bad blood to<br/>\n  start things off, although the two teams cooperated eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Plane of Hate can be shared.  In fact, it will be in the future.<br/>\n  We had over 50 people in there and it was lag free.  You just have <br/>\n  to take the teams to two different areas.  SE and SW, or SW and NW,<br/>\n  or whichever.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To make a long story short, it was my assumption that he and his<br/>\n  team were disgusted with the fact that the team I was with was<br/>\n  even on the planes after they had reserved it.  As soon as I<br/>\n  approached the Maestro corpse, the person in question bent down,<br/>\n  and the corpse disappeared.  He stated he accidentally looted it<br/>\n  and never apologized at all.  In fact no one did from the other<br/>\n  team.  It&#39;s all really suspicious.  And while they didn&#39;t have to<br/>\n  let anyone loot it.  We had been sharing nodrops the whole night.<br/>\n  I just hope that he didn&#39;t do it on purpose.  I&#39;m trying to believe<br/>\n  that he didn&#39;t, because I really respect the guy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
