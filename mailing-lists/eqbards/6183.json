I<br/>\npicked a Risky one and attacked it with Weapons,<br/>\ntwisting DDD, Chords and Hymn.  After 5 of them (can&#39;t<br/>\ndo a valid test with only ONE subject), average health<br/>\nloss each time was 2 bubbles.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut weapons in backpack, wielded Horn with Lute on<br/>\npointer.  Twisted same three songs, flipping Lute and<br/>\nHorn at appropriate times (my GOD!  I have NEVER been<br/>\nso busy in my life...hehe).  After five hounds,<br/>\naverage health loss each time was a little UNDER one<br/>\nbubble.  I was nearly ready to go immediately after<br/>\nmaking the kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, I tried to take on 2 Hounds at once....a little<br/>\nharder to do.  Taking them on with weapons, twice I<br/>\nmade it to the zone, once I won the fight with a<br/>\nlittle over 1 1/2 bubbles remaining.  I decided to NOT<br/>\ntry this test again...hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on, I got mobbed by two again.  Decided to try<br/>\nto take them without weapons and get at least ONE<br/>\nvalid test in.  Killed both, ended with 3 full bubbles<br/>\nof health left.  Didn&#39;t do this again, so I can&#39;t<br/>\nconfirm averages here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, I joined some members of my guild for a<br/>\ntrip to Runnyeye.  Entered, turned the corner, and got<br/>\ncreamed by Borxx (someone trained him and didn&#39;t<br/>\nbother to shout a warning...oh well).<br/>\nEntered Runnyeye again, extra tough spawn decided to<br/>\nREALLY be a critic.  Heard the fateful &quot;OOM&quot; from our<br/>\nShaman....ouch!  NOW LOADING....<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I broke even and managed to complete the<br/>\ntests I wanted to.  Also, my brass finally got maxed,<br/>\nso the night was a success in my eyes.  Oh...I also<br/>\nhelped a Cleric friend get to level 19 in the Gorge. <br/>\nTo me, THAT was the best part of the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindolas Stormsong (MM)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
