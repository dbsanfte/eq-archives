But, by and large, people who group up in the Highhold/highkeep<br/>\narea tend to learn two things (at least on Veeshan):<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  KS is ok.  I&#39;m not sure how it is on other servers but on Veeshan just<br/>\nabout anything goes in the orc area of highpass.  It&#39;s a huge KS festival<br/>\nwhere no matter how long you&#39;re fighting a mob those around you will do<br/>\ntheir best to nuke it from under you.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  It&#39;s ok to pull too much, the guards are just around the corner.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  It&#39;s ok to train someone, the zone is very close and/or the guards are<br/>\nnearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just the social attitudes.  The skills that a players don&#39;t learn<br/>\nor don&#39;t learn well because of these situations are critical later in life.<br/>\nIn short:  You can&#39;t learn the skills needed to bust a difficult spawn in a<br/>\nplace where you can just Guard kill the extras unless you are in a<br/>\ndisciplined group who actually tries to learn them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent some time in highkeep myself and left because the zone offers no<br/>\nchallenge.  At 14-18 the gnolls are a lot of fun but the orcs are a KS<br/>\nfestival and the goblins inside highkeep are good XP but a lot of groups<br/>\ntend to get lazy about pulling technique etc because safety is, litterly, a<br/>\nstone&#39;s throw away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not an insult against anyone.  It&#39;s a fact about that zone.  And anyone<br/>\nJUST out of highkeep who&#39;s allowed their group skills to stagnate is more<br/>\ndangerous than someone who went through their twenties in, say, Solusek.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my oppinion but a lot of people share it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it may be very different on other servers.  But on veeshan the norm is<br/>\nto see a group pull too much, kill 1 then take the rest to the guards, and<br/>\nbreak the spawn using the guards to kill off anything they can&#39;t handle each<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ken Bachman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 20, 2000 4:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Highpass Keep<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Kevin L.
