I don&#39;t mean<br/>\nto gainsaying all your points, but I just keep grouping with tanks who<br/>\nfreely offer &quot;ahhh, I love bards&quot; after the first battle. I have a tank (not<br/>\nin my guild) who sends me a tell every single time he is setting up a group,<br/>\nhe sees a bard as invaluable glue. I have had  casters who when I shout<br/>\n&quot;bard looking for fort group&quot; shout &quot;No your not, you are with us. Dibs on<br/>\nthe bard&quot; (yeah I had grouped once with them before, and yes that was at<br/>\n32). I just have had great luck with being invited in and kept in a group.<br/>\n32 changes a LOT, but not everything. The trick is education *laughs*<br/>\nletting the group know what you can do. If a pickup group I am in is looking<br/>\na bit of downtime I always mem guardian/purifying rhythms and, playing the<br/>\ndrum, say &quot;Check out your resists&quot;. It ALWAYS gets amazed groupsays with<br/>\nlots of caps and exclamations. And suggestions we go fight Cenobites<br/>\n*laughs*<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
