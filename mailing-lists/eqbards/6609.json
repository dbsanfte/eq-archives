We could afford to take the<br/>\nlosses and still come out of the zone after a few days with what Verant<br/>\nconsidered to be &quot;easy&quot; loot. So they nerfed it. However, unlike the way<br/>\nthey nerfed the dragons, which we can still go kill, if we put a good<br/>\nenough bunch of people together and have a leader who can keep things<br/>\ntogether, they managed to nerf it so you don&#39;t even have a chance to<br/>\nzone in before you are dead. That&#39;s just, IMO, sloppy work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOB Bard so this doesn&#39;t get kabonged. Almost the only bard only items in<br/>\nthe game are in PoF. Other than the drum, isn&#39;t anyone else just a<br/>\nlittle bummed out at the dearth of bard specific items? We used to at<br/>\nleast share some of the cool rogue daggers, but they took that away from<br/>\nus and gave us nothing to make up for it. Meanwhile, after the huge<br/>\nwarrior protest a while back, you can&#39;t even kill a firebeetle without<br/>\nfinding some new warrior only armor or weapon. What&#39;s up with that? Do<br/>\nwe have to yell and scream until our faces turn blue to get any<br/>\nattention at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
