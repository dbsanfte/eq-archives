I got a few extra days between Xmas and New Years, here&#39;s how<br/>\n&gt;they went:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wednesday - Spent a lot of time in Oasis killing specters, giants and the<br/>\n&gt;occasional DW goblin.  Specters were camped, giants spawn slowly, not<br/>\n&gt;much exp.  Spent a couple of hours with a tired and overeager guild group<br/>\n&gt;in Paw, got run out of zone three times, not much exp.  (Those snakes are<br/>\n&gt;cool, though.)  Net 1/2 bubble of 35.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thursday - Spent 8 hours at the top of 4c pyramid in Cazic.  Great group,<br/>\n&gt;no deaths, last two bubbles of 35, sliver of 36.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Friday - Off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Saturday - Spent 8 hours at the top of 4c pyramid again, with a<br/>\n&gt;completely different group. Great group, no deaths, got 4 plus bubbles of<br/>\n&gt;36, taking me to a sliver under 37.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sunday - Most guild members who are on are in Planes, spent an hour<br/>\n&gt;apiece in each of three dungeons, /auctioning for a group (no responses),<br/>\n&gt;/oocing if rooms were taken (they all were), /telling the few people I<br/>\n&gt;knew if they had space (they didn&#39;t, and wouldn&#39;t for hours).  Spent four<br/>\n&gt;hours running around to all the places where I thinnk I can solo<br/>\n&gt;something, all camped up the wazoo.  Net:  7 hours, killed three blue<br/>\n&gt;things solo.  Still a sliver under 37.  How do I avoid another one of<br/>\n&gt;these days?  Or is this the price I pay for having a job which didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;permit me to powerlevel my way to 50?  Am I not patient enough?  Am I<br/>\n&gt;supposed to pick a dungeon and sit on my heinie for four hours until<br/>\n&gt;something opens up?  Is this fun?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 36 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
