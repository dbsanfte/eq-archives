It is<br/>\n&gt;just hearsay, but this is what someone told me...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot; It is now called the Stein of Moggok. I got my character who i used<br/>\n&gt;to kill the fish for the quest in qeynos to see if they changed it just<br/>\n&gt;for fun. This is what i found, the fish is now the god Rodcet Nife. Hit<br/>\n&gt;me for 244pts dam in one bite. Then proceeded to call me a puny<br/>\n&gt;mortal.Not sure if the fish can be killed anymore. Just my experience<br/>\n&gt;with it:)&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t tried it, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true. But then again, I<br/>\n&gt;never tried it before.
