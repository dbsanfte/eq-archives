This is in reference to the person being able to<br/>\nget experience at all. If I remember correctly the mob must be within at<br/>\nmost 1/3 of your level.. ie a level 24 character must kill a mob levels<br/>\n17-32 in order to get xp. 8 levels on either side.<br/>\n The amount of experience given to that player for the group kill is<br/>\ndependant upon the raltionship of the level difference between the group<br/>\nmembers. As far as the amount of xp given the character gets his level<br/>\nproportion of xp as it would be divided within the group irregardless of<br/>\nwhether the other group member are within the level range to gain experience<br/>\nthemselves.. IE a level 50 player and a level 20 player.. 50+20 is 70<br/>\ntherefore the level 20 player get 2/7 of the experience for the mob if the<br/>\nmob is within 1/3 his levels. The exception to this is I believe until level<br/>\n15 you can gain exp for anything within 5 levels regardless of level.<br/>\nShadowdancer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 9:43 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Some questions about Experience (off-topic)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 27 Oct 1999, Christine wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree with Thormeal here - I have a level 33 ranger that has been<br/>\ngrouped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a level 9 paladin for a few days (doing a quest) and I will say<br/>\nthat if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I kill something green to me, he will not get exp if we are grouped.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The confusion comes because if HE kills something, and I assist in no<br/>\nway in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the fight (I assume bard songs would be considered assisting, but I did<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with my ranger so can&#39;t say for sure) he will get the exp he normally<br/>\nwould,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even if we are grouped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is more in line with what I&#39;ve observed.
