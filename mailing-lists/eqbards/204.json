Actually, they<br/>\n&gt; were on my corpse, way up in Everfrost Peaks, but having died in Qeynos<br/>\n&gt; Hills, I lost it.<br/>\n&gt; Taking this as a sign from the Gods, I decided to practice Hand-to-Hand<br/>\n&gt; attacking until I could generate more coin. Decided to truly live the life<br/>\n&gt; of an ascetic, I choose to fast. I hoped that I could &quot;live on a song&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; have Jaxon&#39;s Jig O&#39; Vigor restore any stamina a lost due to starvation.<br/>\n&gt; This plan might have worked, but I zoned and the song ended and I<br/>\n&gt; forget to<br/>\n&gt; re-sing it. I cast it as I passed out and watched my stamina and health<br/>\n&gt; bars creep up and down near their midpoints. Eventually, I began to bleed<br/>\n&gt; to death. I don&#39;t know why, I guess starvation will do that to you. The<br/>\n&gt; Coup de Grace (sp?) was right before I died. I received a rather odd<br/>\n&gt; message. I left it at home, but the gist was:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>\n&gt; Pain and Suffering strike at YOU and miss<br/>\n&gt; you died<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whoah! Who are these Pain and Suffering beasties? They apparently live in<br/>\n&gt; the city of Qeynos, since that&#39;s where I was at the time.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve since decided that I should probably eat. As of this posting, Plastos<br/>\n&gt; is camped out under the Dock of Qeynos, wishing he had more food and some<br/>\n&gt; clothing.
