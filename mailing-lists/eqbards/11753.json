No matter what.  It&#39;s the 10,000 monkeys at the<br/>\ntypewriter scenario - where one of them eventually pounds out the complete<br/>\nworks of William Shakespeare.  People like to &quot;try stuff&quot; and when they find<br/>\nsomething &#39;cool&#39; they swear their friends to secrecy and show them. Then 3<br/>\ndays later everyone on the internet knows about it and does it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think the &quot;owners&quot; of the game need to take responsibility.  It&#39;s their<br/>\ngame. They need to fix it.  But at the same time - they delivered a product<br/>\nand they should stand behind it.  If some guy thought hmmm this would be a<br/>\ncool thing, codes it, it passes internal testing, they pop a zone with it<br/>\nand players loot it.  I think it should be theirs to keep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Brad comes along 6 months later and someone at a design review meeting<br/>\nwhines about so-and-so KS&#39;d some neat item and they decide the item is &quot;too<br/>\nneat&quot; and implement a nerf - well that is gonna make everyone who got the<br/>\nitem before the so called powers that be changed the rules - MAD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are dealing with a bunch of issues kinda like this now - the whole<br/>\nfeign death thing with Monks. After them watching 100k people play their<br/>\ngame - they decide they don&#39;t like how its being played? So they change it??<br/>\nWTF??? <br/>\n<br/>\nThey should concentrate on making the game MORE FUN - not more like some way<br/>\nthey think it should be.  Instead of taking away cool items - they should<br/>\nadd more cool items.  So they implement alchemy.  Good!  Now shamans have<br/>\nsomething to do that is cool.  So the first potions they can make oughta be<br/>\nworthwhile - not just more crap.  Why not a invis to unded potion?  Why not<br/>\na shrink your self? Or a SoW your self? Spread around some of these minor<br/>\npowers - and while it may reduce your interaction with one class - it will<br/>\nincrease it with another.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this is just my HO - happy to agree to disagree with you - agreeably :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, December 13, 1999 12:10 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Re:Re: Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\n(Longish)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t\tOn Mon, 13 Dec 1999, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; All this stuff about &#39;class balance&#39; and whether an item<br/>\nis &#39;bugged&#39; (guise<br/>\n\t\t&gt; lets you get the spell even if you cant wear it - which<br/>\nyou need to do to<br/>\n\t\t&gt; get the stats) is a matter of opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYup.
