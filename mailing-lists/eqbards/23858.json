I&#39;m still (out of habit) playing first-person<br/>\nview even thought I&#39;ve heard all the advice that overhead is better for<br/>\nCC...<br/>\n<br/>\n     Anywho - I try to target the add which is in view in the bottom right<br/>\nhand<br/>\nof the screen - and all hell breaks loose.  It takes me a second to realize<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve clicked the &quot;Social/Abilities&quot; box and the interface decided it<br/>\nwas time for me to move the box.  I frantically try to figure out how to<br/>\nget<br/>\nit to stop - as a 3rd mob walks in the room.  By the time I get it under<br/>\ncontrol the 2 tanks are dead.  I get 2 mobs tied down - we kill one when<br/>\nmore start spawning.  At this point we don&#39;t have enough firepower (2<br/>\nClerics and a Druid) - and eventually I get a string of resists to mez - so<br/>\nwe decide to run for the border.   One of the mobs was a summoner - so only<br/>\none of the four of us makes it.<br/>\n<br/>\n     I told my guildies what happened - only to discover about the alt-L<br/>\ncommand<br/>\nto lock the windows.  If you haven&#39;t done the ALT-L do it right away -  I<br/>\nwish I had known about it before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n53 Bard of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
