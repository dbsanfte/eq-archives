My first two regular groups ahve all but<br/>\nfallen apart as the various members have ditched their primary characters to<br/>\nplay binders.  It has been a depressing last month for me group wise.  The<br/>\nonly time I grouped in the last week it was in Befallen with 2 rangers and a<br/>\ncleric.  The cleric blew 80% of his mana every fight nuking the undead and<br/>\nthe two rangers and I were forced to be healers.  It was silly.  If he<br/>\nwanted to play a wizard why didn&#39;t he?  I would dearly love to find a group<br/>\nof intelligent players my level who won&#39;t be depending on me to be their<br/>\nprimary tank.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Miriana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 4:00 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Twinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 5 Oct 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John.Curry@...\">John.Curry@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Giving away banded.. doph.. the poor blacksmiths who spent all that time<br/>\n&gt; learning the craft so they could be undersold by someone giveing it away.<br/>\n\tRead my signature below :).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; would think that the game STARTs at level 20 :)  Thats when you started<br/>\n&gt; getting stuff for yourself :)  Anyway, I really think that if Verant<br/>\nwanted<br/>\n\tFor many of us, the game isn&#39;t about STUFF, but apparently it is<br/>\nfor you.
