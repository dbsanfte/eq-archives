The following changes have been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-269091024\">Patch process complete.<br/>\n******************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nFebruary 3rd, 8:00am<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following changes have been implemented on the live servers:<br/>\n<br/>\n*Spells*<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lay On Hands: Enhanced to heal more hitpoints per level.<br/>\n- Enveloping Roots: Casting time reduced to match Immobilize<br/>\n- Skin Like Nature: Small Damage Shield added. This will stack with other <br/>\nshields.<br/>\n- Insidious Fever: Casting time reduced.<br/>\n- Insidious Malady: Casting time Reduced.<br/>\n- Burnout series: Negative HP component removed to bring it in line with the <br/>\nNecromancer&#39;s Intensify/Augment death series.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Songs*<br/>\n<br/>\n- Syvelian&#39;s Anti-magic Aura: Potency increased.<br/>\n- Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding: Now also grants See Invisible. Party members <br/>\ncan now see each other while under the effect of this song.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, the following songs have been given a slightly larger radius:<br/>\n- Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\n- Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles<br/>\n- Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>\n- Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre<br/>\n<br/>\n*PvP-Teams Change*<br/>\n<br/>\nCustomers on the PvP-Teams servers have been plagued by a tactic known as <br/>\n&quot;Bind Rushing&quot;. Casters would bind themselves in a hostile area or dungeon, <br/>\nand attack everyone of an opposing race in the area. Sooner or later the <br/>\ncaster would die. They would then respawn, memorize a few spells, then jump <br/>\nback in to attack their wounded opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a first step in combating this practice and improving life for those on <br/>\nthe PvP-Servers, casters will now respawn with zero mana after being killed <br/>\nby another player in a duel or open combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis code is new for those on Tallon and Vallon Zek. It has been in place <br/>\nfor some time on Rallos Zek and works very well there.<br/>\n<br/>\n*The Plane of Sky*<br/>\n<br/>\nAll spells that grant levitation will no longer function in the Plane of <br/>\nSky. This affects spells cast by Wizards, Enchanters, Shamans, Druids, <br/>\nNecromancers, and Bards. The Plane of Sky is designed to be completed in <br/>\ncertain fashion, and the existence of these spells allowed the islands to be <br/>\ncompleted out-of-order.<br/>\n<br/>\nA teleporter will be placed on the first island in the next patch to allow <br/>\npeople access to the room below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
