Because of this, your question <br/>\nwill most likely be answered with the typical: They&#39;re powergaming losers, <br/>\nthey KS and train people hourly and on purpose, they have GM&#39;s in their back <br/>\npockets, they take over zones and push everyone else out, they perma-camp <br/>\nspawns by rotating people in and out to keep someone on the spot, they&#39;re <br/>\nall arrogant egotistical pricks (a couple are, but every guild has those), <br/>\nthey&#39;re all kewld00ds that don&#39;t give a shit about role-playing (some are <br/>\nsome aren&#39;t, same as any other guild), they farm items to e-bay them <br/>\n(LAFFFF), and they own all dragons/planes. The funny thing is none of that <br/>\nis true, but people tend to belive whatever they read, and the best form of <br/>\npublicity in an online game is word of mouth, so...<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, the Veeshan forum on eqvault is spammed and trolled with flames <br/>\nstating one or more of the above items, and the person gets shot down, <br/>\nbut...they keep it coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know enough about them (being former-FoH myself) to know that they aren&#39;t <br/>\ndeserving of all of the flames, but it happens anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad&lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n52nd Bearer of the hard, plain truth<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Race to 60 (OT)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 10 May 2000 14:25:46 -0600<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FoH?
