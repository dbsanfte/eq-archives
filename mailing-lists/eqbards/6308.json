As I can&#39;t tell a<br/>\n&gt; significant difference in the amount I get missed between 100 and 130 I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth giving up AC for agility beyond that point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is almost correct. Agility DOES affect your AC. I don&#39;t have the<br/>\nnumbers written down but I do know that my AC is affected by how much<br/>\n+agility I have (just like my HP are affected by how much +stamina I have).<br/>\nHowever, once your agility reaches 100, it takes a larger amount of agility<br/>\nboosting items/buffs to see that AC increase.  If you doubt this at all,<br/>\ntake off all your +agility items and look at your AC then put them on and<br/>\ncompare again. For those of you with a base agility that is lower than 100<br/>\nyou should see your AC increase.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne example I can give and maybe some of you can test this with someone you<br/>\ntrust, but the dwarven cleric I run around with gets better AC from his BS<br/>\ntunic than a bronze breastplate because of the agility boost. Because my<br/>\nagility hangs around the 110 mark, my AC went down from Steel/Bronze when I<br/>\ntried his tunic on. Had I removed all my other +agility items and tried<br/>\nagain, the story might have been different. I&#39;ll try this tonight if I can<br/>\nremember and let you all know what I find.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\n33rd level bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
