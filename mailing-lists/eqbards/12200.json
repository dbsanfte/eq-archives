However, bards are group-centric<br/>\nclass, so if your aim is to more or less solo to 50 I&#39;d look at Necros or<br/>\nDruids (but bards are much more fun).  Soloing is very difficult past about<br/>\nlevel 12, so if you&#39;re soloing now, that is probably why you&#39;re seeing your<br/>\nexperience slow down.  I agree wholeheartedly with the other poster that<br/>\nsaid tanks are your friends at these levels.  Find a Warrior, Ranger or<br/>\nPaladin to tank for you - a class with taunt - and then just do dervishes or<br/>\nraiders until you get to 14th/15th or so.  Then move to Oasis of Marr and<br/>\npartner with another tank.  The Caimans there are great experience but very<br/>\nlittle loot.  Find a tank partner who is tired of sitting on his bottom for<br/>\n15 minutes healing after every fight and group with him.   He&#39;ll love you<br/>\nfor your healing and Anthem de Arms, and you&#39;ll love him for the damage<br/>\nhe&#39;ll dish out.  That&#39;s a great combo and location at that level.  Frankly<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find no reason to leave until 20th.  At 20th ask us again and we&#39;ll<br/>\nbe happy to help you some more!  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can easily make high levels without camping, but unfortunately some of<br/>\nthe equipment that you want (or feel that you need) will either have to be<br/>\npurchased from someone who camped for it or camped for.  I too have a low<br/>\ntolerance for camping an item and have done very little of it in my EQ life.<br/>\nLike you I get restless and move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game was designed to take a lot of time.  I remember reading a post from<br/>\nBrad McQaid (the producer of EverQuest) that the typical player should take<br/>\na year to get to level 50 (many powergames beat that of course).  So don&#39;t<br/>\nworry, the game isn&#39;t a race, it&#39;s a world.  Live in it.  It you can only<br/>\nlive in it for two hours a week, that&#39;s ok.  If you chose to spend your two<br/>\nhours that week working on your Fishing Skill or something - so what.  Do<br/>\nwhat&#39;s enjoyable to you and you&#39;ve won.  Sounds corny but it&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your other comment about equipment speeding things up, this is perhaps<br/>\nonly true at lower levels for a twinked character (i.e. a player that has<br/>\nequipment far above his level).  The game is balanced so that at the higher<br/>\nlevels you are expected to have that equipment and the mobs are suitably<br/>\nmore difficult.  In other words, without advanced equipment at high levels<br/>\nyou simply get ripped to shreds.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 40th bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\nEQ: Pretend it&#39;s a game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Jason Sanderson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moxy1@...\">moxy1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player<br/>\n&gt; (maybe a couple<br/>\n&gt; hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be taking longer...<br/>\n&gt; Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it take longer for<br/>\n&gt; each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each level, but<br/>\n&gt; hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better selection of<br/>\n&gt; mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or<br/>\n&gt; harder to level<br/>\n&gt; in the early teens compared to later levels..<br/>\n&gt; Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?  I hate<br/>\n&gt; camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I get bored and<br/>\n&gt; leave....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Reed<br/>\n&gt; 13 lvl  Bard of S Ro.. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
