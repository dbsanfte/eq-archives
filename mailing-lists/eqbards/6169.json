Look a named SG, and he cons yellow! Lets get <br/>\nhim! If i remember correctly I was lvl 18 at the time.<br/>\nSo we jump him and soon discovers that he is one tough yellow, hitting for <br/>\nsome 50 a punch, but none of the 120 point hits other SGs has scored <br/>\n(without killing though, I must add :). Oh well, we sound the retreat and <br/>\nbolt for the zone.<br/>\nBack again in the zone we quickly gather three more ppl to join us<br/>\nfor that rare SG hunting expedition at this lvl.<br/>\nWe soon find him in the desert near N Ro and promptly charged.<br/>\nAgain a tough battle began with Hatar swinging left and right. After a short <br/>\nwhile most group members are down to half health, but so is Hatar and we <br/>\nfeel that we are winning, when suddenly BOOM and Hatar falls dead to the <br/>\nground. Cheers break out but I think wtf no exp!<br/>\nI look around and, oh yes, there he is the high lvl KS nuker standing at <br/>\nsafe distance.<br/>\nOh well I think, hadnt had a chance to loot anyway in the right click frenzy <br/>\nthats sure to take place in this quickly assembled group.<br/>\nAnd now I can claim that I have stood my ground against an SG and lived to <br/>\ntell the tale!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m lucky enough to meet him again I will certainly give it a second try.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and greetings to you all! This is my first post to this excellent list <br/>\nwhich I have enjoyed for a while now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWoland Vildhufvud - 21st lvl battle bard of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep trying you SGs and spectres, you will never catch me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Help I look like a Nazi<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1999 12:54:13 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hatar does spawn in Oasis.

I think that I will probably try to obtain a Turban <br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Sand Giant.  I looked it up and the turban gives +10 to AC with <br/>\n&gt;almost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no weight.  Does anyone know how much they generally sell for, so I <br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; start saving my plats... or gather sympathetic party to hunt with me?  <br/>\n&gt;:)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hatar is a spawn so rare, I, and most people I know, have never seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him. He spawns in either Oasis or S Ro (so I&#39;ve heard) and I used to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; check tracking every time I passed through there. I even auctioned that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would pay 100 plat for a tell from someone when he was sighted and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never once got a message. I lucked out and got one from someone who did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stumble across him, and I traded a serpantine bracer for it. I&#39;ve only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; run across 3 of them on Tarrew Marr, counting the one I have.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Drawing is held each week through September 17.
