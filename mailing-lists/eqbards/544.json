They were charging 1-2 PPs per person.  That sounds<br/>\nlike a great alternative for making some cash other than the standard trade<br/>\nskills and adventuring.  What does everyone else think?  Is this a viable<br/>\nway to make money?   <br/>\n<br/>\nI am fairly new to the game and have not ventured anywhere other than on the<br/>\nFaydark continent.  As a result, I am not certain of all the perils of cross<br/>\ncountry travel on other continents.  I am also unaware of how long it takes<br/>\nfor another class (at standard movement rates) to travel from Point A to<br/>\nPoint B on the other continents.  Do you guys think that other players, in<br/>\norder to maximize their adventuring potential by decreasing travel times,<br/>\nwould be willing to pay for this service? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we agree this is a viable service, I was thinking that we could use this<br/>\nforum as a place to agree on standard service rates from Point A to Point B<br/>\nfor each continent.  I will consolidate all the recommendations I receive<br/>\nand publish a list that everyone can use if they wish to perform this<br/>\nservice.  Of course, like all other services, final prices would still be<br/>\nnegotiable and subject to the supply/demand laws.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in order to make this work, bards will have to start advertising the<br/>\nservice to their fellow players.  Amazingly, I grouped with some guys the<br/>\nother day, all 8-10th level, who had never travelled cross-country with a<br/>\nbard before.  We started in Kelethin and went to the Mino caves in<br/>\nSteamfont.  They were amazed at how fast we got there.  Everyone made a<br/>\ncomment they were glad to have me in the group.  They were even more<br/>\ngracious when we had to start fleeing from some Mino slavers:-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know what you think, both positive or negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nBard of the 8th Circle<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
