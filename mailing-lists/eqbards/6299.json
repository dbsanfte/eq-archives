I&#39;ve been playing since April 1st and still<br/>\nam at 16th level, okay I was 17th level very briefly, but I &#39;waste&#39; so much<br/>\ntime doing quests and running around interacting and generally exploring<br/>\nthat I level ridiculously slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However I do agree that something must be done about <br/>\n&gt;harvesting low level mobs for twinkie treasure by high level characters. <br/>\n&gt;My suggestion:  random spawn points for the named NPC&#39;s that carry the good<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like this suggestion, but I still think it would be better to have a<br/>\ncreature always spawn with its common drop and a timestamp.  Every game day<br/>\n(or whatever period is appropriate for that creature) the timestamp is<br/>\nchecked, and if a sufficient amount of time has passed since the creature<br/>\nspawned, his common drop is replaced with his rare drop.  I would think this<br/>\nwould help discourage camping as killing the spawn without the rare drop<br/>\nwould further delay the appearance of the rare drop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like the idea of comparing a critters time of death to his spawn<br/>\ntimestamp and if less than some set amount respawning him at a higher level<br/>\nuntil he reaches his max level.  If this max level was increased, imagine<br/>\nthe camper&#39;s surprise as they battle the critter for the 5th time and<br/>\nsuddenly get pasted by a critter they had little trouble with before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
