I did not see it in <br/>\nFreeport so i went to Kelethin and sure enough it was there. That was around <br/>\nlvl 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am lvl 14, and was looking forward to purchasing Lullaby. So i had a <br/>\nfriend gate me to G Faydark just for this song, and found that the merchant <br/>\nselling high level songs has neither one now. I also heard that maybe one of <br/>\nthe merchants was missing. Maybe he went for a walk (I&#39;ve seen that before, <br/>\nbut never with spell merchants). I seem to remember seeing Lullaby there at <br/>\nthe time I purchased Lament.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know what the deal is with this? I want to get this song badly, <br/>\nbut unless i get help I will have to possibly travel all the way to Erudin. <br/>\nA petition brought a response from a guide saying &quot;you&#39;ll have to find out <br/>\nfor yourself&quot;, of course. It&#39;s just annoying when you are sure the song was <br/>\nthere. It threw me off enough finding that since beta, our songs have been <br/>\nscattered across the world - which can be ok, it gives you a reason to <br/>\ntravel.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid they move it? Was the merchant out having a drink at the local pub? <br/>\nAnyone? Thanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 14th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
