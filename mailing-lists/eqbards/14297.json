They don&#39;t<br/>\ntest in a competent manner, but at the same time they claim to.<br/>\nHowever, I want to say something about the perception that they are ignoring the<br/>\nlarge issues in favor of the small ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently working on a fairly large data warehousing project, with a fairly<br/>\ncomplex ETL (extraction/transform/load) structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a list of changes that need to be made.<br/>\nThe system is in production.<br/>\nThe data used will F up the financials if I screw up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do I do?  What would YOU do?  I make the small safe changes first.   Tweak<br/>\na field value, change a calc.  No structure changes, no multi tier changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings as a whole get slightly better, my list is shorter.  I still have large<br/>\nissues.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you solve large issues? What&#39;s the solution to issue X?  Who does that<br/>\nsolution hurt unintentionally?  How long does it take to get a workable<br/>\nsolution?<br/>\nCan you even get one with no downsides?  I&#39;ve almost NEVER solved a complex<br/>\nissue with no drawbacks in a complex system.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I have a team working with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do we do?  Some folks make MANY small changes fairly fast.<br/>\nSome folks work long hours for months on EACH large issue and fix them slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of these things happen at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know most of us are programmers/data specialists/IS folks, etc.  And as mad as<br/>\nwe are, you know that in the real world this is how things work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd to this that we have NO idea what the code ramifications to change are.  For<br/>\nall I know, the same module that controls spell X also produces cascade data for<br/>\nmob behavior Y.  With a zillion spells and a zillion mobs, making ANY structural<br/>\nor rate change can be HUGELY time consuming, even to track the effects, much<br/>\nless implement the change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Verant has dropped the ball in several cases.  Are they a bunch of<br/>\nKeystone Kops with no clue?  I doubt it.<br/>\n<br/>\nComplain away about specific issues, that&#39;s the only way to get them fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut nobody on this list really knows enough about the code or dynamics to call<br/>\nVerant incompetent.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my .02 cents, having been there...<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias the Staunch!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
