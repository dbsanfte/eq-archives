I did not know about h2h(damm<br/>\nwanted to train in that too), but 2handers are capped at 1, tracking at<br/>\n1, forage at 40, pick lock at 40, hide at 40, sneak at 40, disarm traps<br/>\nat 40. Safe fall, instill doubt, and bind wound are probably too. Corect<br/>\nme if I&#39;m wrong. The only thing we aren&#39;t capped in are the basic weapon<br/>\nskills(cept mentioned), instrument and singing skills, dual wield,<br/>\noffense and defense, (though it seems to be 5 pts behind your level,<br/>\nI&#39;ve been at 90 forever at level 18), and language skills. Its the price<br/>\nof being a bard heh. About best weapon...I personally used a dwarven axe<br/>\nfrom 5 to well...using it now. Its got a nice 6 dam 26 delay. Very good<br/>\nweapon, plus has same time between attacks as my polished granite<br/>\ntomhawk, which is helpful in seeing when dual wield fails.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalonus<br/>\nTraveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chr.geo@...\">chr.geo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chr.geo@...\">chr.geo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I level 12 HEF - skill level is &quot;bad&quot;, guildmaster(s) says &quot;trained to the<br/>\n&gt; max limit&quot; - does that mean that hand to hand skill caps at 40?
