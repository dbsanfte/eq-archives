Although I stand<br/>\nby my statement. Of course it is possible to go to sol a without a tank a be<br/>\nok, there&#39;s just no way I&#39;d do it. Usually equates to one dead bard. (me) Of<br/>\ncourse by the time you hit 25-27 you can survive just fine there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI first went to sol a at level 20, and then again at 22. The first time was<br/>\njust way too early. At 22, we had a well balanced party (enchanter 23, bard<br/>\n23, bard 22 (me), sk 20, necro 19, druid ?) we were able to break and take<br/>\nthe singe room and hold it for 3 or 4 hours. It was a lot of fun, but I<br/>\nchalked up the positive experience to having a good party that was really<br/>\nworking well together. After that night, I didn&#39;t go back till 25, but once<br/>\n25, I parked myself for the ride of a lifetime. We have a truly amazing<br/>\npuller who is capable of pulling a non stop stream of endless blues. Exp was<br/>\nflowing like water. (approx a bub an hour) But anyway, I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are commited to staying in sol a and no one is willing to start up a<br/>\ntank, then recruit one from outside your group. There are plenty of tanks in<br/>\nthe game, and they are more dependant on the other classes than the casters<br/>\nso they are generally looking for a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraeloin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

My point was they do<br/>\nsucceed just as well in Sol A without me.  Only difference is they take<br/>\nturns seeing who dies once per night instead of me every night.  They get<br/>\njust as much xp and loot in the same amount of time.  They don&#39;t need a tank<br/>\nin Sol A and having someone who can only tank and not very well just means<br/>\nthat person gets to be the nightly martyr who dies in the bad pull.  Might<br/>\nas well have it be a caster who can be back in 30 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tkitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
