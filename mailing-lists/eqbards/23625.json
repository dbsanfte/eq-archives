Was me (55 bard), 59 SK, 59 Necro, 53 shamen,<br/>\n54 cleric, 54 paladin.  We rocked the place, I had no trouble CC&#39;ing<br/>\nanything.  Well this group broke up and I joined another group.  Now for the<br/>\nmediocre group-----  me, 57 paladin, 52 cleric, 59 druid, 59 ranger, 54<br/>\nrogue.  The damage output on the second group was killin things fast.  The<br/>\ndruid and the ranger were idiots though.  They insisted on using root as<br/>\ncrowd control (even after I repeatedly told them I had been CC&#39;ing with no<br/>\ntrouble for the last 2 hours in Bar/Armorer).  The stupid ranger was pulling<br/>\nsingles by rooting the extras at the spawn points.  So mid battle we would<br/>\nend up with more mobs then if he had just pulled the 2 or 3 that where<br/>\nthere.  Then he pulled the bar room (using this lame root pulling) we got 4<br/>\nadds all once (they ported in on us).  The cleric went invulnerable and just<br/>\nas I got the adds under control the frickin druid evac&#39;d us!  Leaving the<br/>\ninvulverable cleric behind to die.  /sigh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The FAQ: Talies, in reference to the last question, don&#39;t have a 49th song<br/>\n&gt; now? Melody of Ervaj from Velious is listed as being 49th level. And<br/>\n&gt; speaking of the issues of bad bards, wonder if we could get that fabulous<br/>\n&gt; FAQ posted on the Concert Hall. It might possibly help the new crop of<br/>\n&gt; bardlings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The 49 song is Shield of Song.
