She musta blindly clicked until she got it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; targeted.  I consented and she dragged.

(We /corpsed one from the bottom of HH canyon<br/>\n&gt; straight up to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the top ledge one time.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can drag stuff out of lava anywhere else in Sol A (you may<br/>\n&gt; have to get creative with your levitate, but you can do it).<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s just the section past that lavafall where you can&#39;t pull<br/>\n&gt; it out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava<br/>\n&gt; pool into Sol-b?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would<br/>\n&gt; end up in Lava<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?  Like someone could zone<br/>\n&gt; out of sol-b<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in panic and die in the lava?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That particular zone point goes from lava to lava.  I spent<br/>\n&gt; the better part of an hour (my first hour ever in Sol B mind<br/>\n&gt; you) finding a friend&#39;s corpse after he fell in in Sol A,<br/>\n&gt; zoned through to Sol B, and died.  We had no idea where in<br/>\n&gt; that lava zone came out in Sol B, and I had to rely on the<br/>\n&gt; song to figure out where his corpse was.  (I was not attacked<br/>\n&gt; the entire time, and figured Sol B wasn&#39;t so bad so decided to<br/>\n&gt; play there a bit, and problem died to a sonic bat train. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
