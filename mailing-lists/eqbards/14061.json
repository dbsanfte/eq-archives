If they did you could nod a single mob and it would never break<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; unless it resisted (R).  It would stay forever nodded as long as you got<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; least an r.  This isn&#39;t the case.  I was firing just Lullaby with no<br/>\nattacks<br/>\n&gt; coming my way, no lag, and ping of about 100.  The result vs a level 1 mob<br/>\n&gt; (large rat) was that it could get a secondary resist and attack even<br/>\nthough<br/>\n&gt; it failed the very first resist totally.  Might be more like Nr = NN , Nrr<br/>\n=<br/>\n&gt; NNR.

It would seem my<br/>\n&gt; charisma is high enough that I&#39;ve hit the 5% cap, at least<br/>\n&gt; against these low level mobs.  This is about what I&#39;d expect<br/>\n&gt; considering 154 is pretty high by anyone&#39;s standards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Secondary resists (r) are not working as GZ said.  During<br/>\n&gt; the Lullaby test, he said the chance of a secondary resist<br/>\n&gt; ranged from 25% to 35% (against L1 and even /con mobs<br/>\n&gt; respectively - I finally read the log :), modified by<br/>\n&gt; charisma.  I&#39;m getting roughly 50% secondary resists against<br/>\n&gt; green mobs, higher against low blues, which would indicate<br/>\n&gt; something is broken.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think the mobs buffed themselves with magic resist<br/>\n&gt; since their chance of a primary resist was at the 5%<br/>\n&gt; cap.  The dark ritualist pet that was summoned after someone<br/>\n&gt; killed the first one (neat trick that :) most certainly wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; buffed in any way, yet still had a secondary resist rate of<br/>\n&gt; 57%.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
