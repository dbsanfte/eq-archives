The problem, though, is that few people sell these<br/>\nitems.  People who are high enough level to obtain them generally have enough<br/>\nplatinum that they don&#39;t need any more, and so look instead for items to trade.<br/>\nThis ends up being a big problem for lower level players, who really only have<br/>\nplat to offer.  I suggest that if you want one of these before you are able to<br/>\nkill Bonecracker yourself, buy one at whatever price you see.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are, btw, excellent weapons for a bard, as they are very efficient and do not<br/>\nhave any annoying &quot;lockup&quot; abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
