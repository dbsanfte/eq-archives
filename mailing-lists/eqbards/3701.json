I was endlessly walking around in<br/>\n&gt;cloth or patchwork armor, with my trusty tarnished hatchet, and my exotic<br/>\n&gt;small wooden shield, dying often, and dreaming of the day I would be able to<br/>\n&gt;buy a single leather gorget.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My second bard was lucky enough to receive the gift of mino axe and small<br/>\n&gt;shield at level one from a friendly ranger. It was like night and day.<br/>\n&gt;Killing stuff was much easier, my death to lvl ratio hit the floor, and I<br/>\n&gt;was soon buying extra containers (backpack, sacks, etc.) just so I could<br/>\n&gt;increase the efficiency of my killing/looting binges. By lvl 5 I had a full<br/>\n&gt;set of leather, and was comfortably adventuring to places that my original<br/>\n&gt;bard had been afraid to venture at lvl 8.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Of course, being very familiar with greater faydark and the surrounding<br/>\n&gt;areas may have made the second bard easier to play as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bernwyn<br/>\n&gt;BardEx Courier - Kelethin to Freeport Route<br/>\n&gt;&quot;When you absolutely have to get it there overnight*&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Give or take a boat crash<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 4:16 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Purity belt...SPOILER REQUEST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am pleading the fifth on all matters concerning twinking, on the grounds<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that i fear i may incriminate myself.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Shada Silverleaf, Level 50 Bard, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Erisi, Level (Anonymous) Paladin, Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Sean Gifford [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:giffords@...\">giffords@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 3:56 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Purity belt...SPOILER REQUEST<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Sean Gifford&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:giffords@...\">giffords@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Think thats bad?

He said a friend gave it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to him, nice<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gift.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; On the other hand, my real life brother-in-law just started<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about 3 days<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ago.  No sooner had his new character spawned at the Freeport<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gates than<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked if he<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wanted a 2H<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could tell<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; him how to say<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; thank you.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; So scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.
