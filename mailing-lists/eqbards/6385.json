Sometimes everyone is good<br/>\nabout keeping fights localized in their area and announcing<br/>\ntrains.  I&#39;ve made nearly a level in a night playing in<br/>\nMistmoore under these circumstances, and the action was<br/>\nnonstop.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther times one or more groups are really rude and pull stuff<br/>\ndeep from the castle to the zone or don&#39;t announce their<br/>\nconstant trains.  I&#39;ve fought one familiar, then spent the<br/>\nnext half hour keeping my group invisible waiting for the<br/>\ntrain to dissipate, kill another familiar, spend another half<br/>\nhour waiting for another train to leave, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re clearing out yard trash, there is absolutely no<br/>\nreason you should ever see the Will Sapper and Soul<br/>\nSeductress.  There are several spots near the zone that are<br/>\nout of the path of trains.  Find them and work from there.  If<br/>\nthe trains are just too frequent, then there are some idiots<br/>\nin the zone - leave and try again another night.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
