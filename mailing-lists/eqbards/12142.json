One group of 6 and one group of 5.<br/>\nThere were 11 people in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say that it was one of the most singularly fun times in EverQuest<br/>\nI&#39;ve ever had.  Working 100% underwater necessitates some tactical changes<br/>\nsuch as playing Jig in battle and occassionally while medding, having<br/>\nAquatic Ayre memmed, etc., but man.  Serious fun.  Great experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter weeks of my &quot;/random 1 100&quot; being something like &#39;7&#39; I finally broke a<br/>\nstreak and rolled a 98 when we killed the big, mean, nasty shark<br/>\nCauldronboil.  Of the 7 or so non-casters that rolled for the weapon I ended<br/>\nup with a Sharkjaw Cutlass (10/33 2.0).  This weapon looks *so* cool as it&#39;s<br/>\ncurved and serrated, plus it is an improvement on my Brazen Brass Kilij<br/>\n(10/35 8.5).<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: Once or twice we had &quot;trains&quot; of swordfish and/or piranha pulled to our<br/>\ngroups.
