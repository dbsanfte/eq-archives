If you have lots of open space,<br/>\nhave more than enough to fight (don&#39;t mind losing exp on some<br/>\nmobs), and your healers don&#39;t have to do a lot of healing, I&#39;d<br/>\nhave to say charm is better.  If you can charm something and<br/>\nyour group concentrates on one target *away* from the charmed<br/>\nmob, all the others will usually attack the charmed mob.  When<br/>\nyour charm lets up, they will all charge you, which is why the<br/>\nopen space is important (once they get within melee range of<br/>\nyou, they will continue attacking mostly you even though the<br/>\ncharmed mob is beating on them from behind).  Just keep this<br/>\nup to distract the other mobs and thin them out until your<br/>\nparty finishes the one it&#39;s fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, if you&#39;re fighting stuff in close quarters, or high<br/>\n/cons, this isn&#39;t as viable a strategy since charm can be<br/>\nresisted and in my experience, three successive resists in a<br/>\nbad situation is enough to drop my health to where I start to<br/>\nthink about running.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother factor is how much damage you&#39;re taking and how often<br/>\nyou&#39;re being healed.  If you take a lot of damage and a cleric<br/>\nheals you, any untaunted mobs (i.e. ones that haven&#39;t been<br/>\ncharmed) will attack the healer.  This is where Lullaby (or<br/>\nany area effect song) is really useful since they make the<br/>\nmobs stick to you freeing the healer to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I tend to use charm when we&#39;re fighting just 2-4<br/>\nmobs and there are no other mobs nearby (your charmee tends to<br/>\nbe lower level than you, which invites green mobs into<br/>\nattacking it).  2-4 mobs in close quarters or with others<br/>\nnearby, I will use pixie strike (or rely on an enchanter to<br/>\nmesmerize).  Fewer mobs = less chaos = less likelihood to be<br/>\ndistracted trying to charm or strike without realizing you&#39;re<br/>\nabout to die.  Strike can actually be better with 3 mobs since<br/>\nI can consistently keep two of them chasing pixies, thus<br/>\nleaving them no time to attack me.  With charm, there is a<br/>\nsmall window between when charm wears out and when all the<br/>\nmobs can attack you.  More mobs than this and I would use<br/>\nLullaby (assuming you have one healer - two and/or a paladin<br/>\nwith lay hands is better).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
