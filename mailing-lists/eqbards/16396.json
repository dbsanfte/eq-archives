In this position his gravity flux doesn&#39;t<br/>\nthrow us out the door and potentially bring trains of mobs back.  When I&#39;m<br/>\ngravity fluxed I turn and run against the wall as I come down (old Quake<br/>\nreflexed kicking in).  Their does appear to be some slowing of the fall<br/>\ncause by my friction against the wall.  I have not died to a gflux since<br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing that trick.  *shrug*  Could be just luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve yet to resist Innoruk&#39;s gravity flux, but for some reason<br/>\n&gt; high MR seems to decrease the damage you take from it.
