I was intrigued that they were<br/>\noriginally using the Rolemaster system, bards in it are pretty cool.  Have<br/>\nto see how much they have to change with the demise of ICE.  I&#39;ll probably<br/>\njump to whichever MMORPG that comes out next that has bards at least as a<br/>\ntrial.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daryl Schwemley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drs@...\">drs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 11:03 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Why did you start a Bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Kit!  That&#39;s funny, I&#39;ve quit twice myself and cancelled the account<br/>\nboth times.  Anyway, the mmorpg I&#39;ve got my eye on right now is Dark Age of<br/>\nCamelot.  I&#39;ve always loved the Camelot myths and they have bardic classes.<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t seen anything about it yet, check it out at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/\">http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/\">http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd as for why I started a bard, it was because I remember seeing one in<br/>\nGFay when I first started playing.  She was playing HoR, and I thought it<br/>\nwas very cool that the sparkles kept going and going and going. ;-)<br/>\n <br/>\nGilgurth<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

Both times I let friends convince me to come back.  I must<br/>\nsay though if there were any other mmorpg&#39;s out there currently with bards I<br/>\nwould likely quit and at least try the other game.  Not saying I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ncome back, but it wouldn&#39;t be hard at this point to lure me away given the<br/>\nimmense frustration VI has built up in me over the last year.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Kit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cyr, Thierry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 10:20 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Why did you start a Bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo did you cancel your account? *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still happy with my choice, though.
