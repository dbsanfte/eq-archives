I used to be able to lull the whole Pirate of Gunthak camp and waltz in<br/>\nand pull the Captain.  Now, I ALWAYS get at least one other pirate on me at the<br/>\nsame time.  Fighting Isle Goblins this morning, I was only able to lull one out<br/>\nof 4 goblins... when before, I would lull everyone with ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else noticed this?  Or am I just experiencing some really wacked out<br/>\nstatistically bad luck?<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
