When I first got dual wield,<br/>\nI used a dragoon dirk and a Pugius dagger.  Both of these are very light<br/>\nweapons.  In long combats, my stamina bar almost never dropped.  I now use<br/>\nthe dragoon dirk and a barbed leather whip.  Because the whip weighs more<br/>\nthan the Pugius dagger, my stamina bar often drops below 50% after a long<br/>\nbattle.  If my stamina gets too low, the primary stats start to decrease.<br/>\nFor me, dual wielding light, fast weapons works out the best.  It also gives<br/>\nme more room in my backpack to carry loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Lowering deviation from average however, does increase predictability<br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; means less dying.  The faster weapon means you&#39;ll die less from mobs you<br/>\n&gt; have easily killed before, while with a higher damage weapon you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; sometimes easily beat a white con andthen get thoroughly trounced by the<br/>\n&gt; same white con the very next time.  Fast weapons are the best defense<br/>\n&gt; against clumpy random number generation.  Missing 5 times in a row with my<br/>\n&gt; Dirk is meaningless in a fight where I have to hit 100 times anyway.<br/>\n&gt; Missing 5 straight times with a delay 45 weapon is equivalent to 10 plus<br/>\n&gt; straght misses  and will cause death.  Of course 5 straight hits are as<br/>\n&gt; advantageous as the misses are disad., but its the lack of predictability<br/>\n&gt; that kills.  Can I take this blue dangerous?  Only if I don&#39;t get bad<br/>\n&gt; luck,<br/>\n&gt; whereas with the faster wepon you generally know what you can handle and<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t after trying it once.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>\n&gt; only lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>\n&gt; likely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>\n&gt; thing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>\n&gt; deviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>\n&gt; as more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.

The higher dmg weapon is better than the faster<br/>\n&gt; weapon when the dmg ratio are the same.  I used to used a Demon claw and a<br/>\n&gt; Silver war axe.  That was fast.  But now that I have the crystalline blade<br/>\n&gt; and the black enamel mace I find the later weapons a lot more efficient.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; have no scientific facts except that with the Crys blade and mace the MOBs<br/>\n&gt; seems to hate me a lot more than when I was fighting with Claw and axe.<br/>\n&gt; Same mob at same lvl.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\n&gt; Hammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\n&gt; Bad Apple, The Rathe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
