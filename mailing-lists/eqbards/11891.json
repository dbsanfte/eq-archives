Since i never got feared, stuned, blinded,<br/>\nsnared, or rooted i could safely pull stuff in the pof that would get many<br/>\nothers killed. As an xtra bonus, if a worry wraith/jello cube dispelled my<br/>\nsow you have the safety of selo&#39;s to fall back on. I even pulled the fire<br/>\ncastle sometimes, though i disliked doing that cause 9 harm touches even<br/>\nwith 250+ mr puts a kink in your day. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut now... my bard dislikes even setting a foot into the plane of fear with<br/>\nthe cazic dt&#39;s, the reason being that bards are such efficient transfers of<br/>\nagro. With one pulse... everybody is added to cazic&#39;s dt list it seems.<br/>\nGoing solo and pulling would solve a lot of these problems, but the people<br/>\nbuffing/healing you would still be added to the agro list of cazic. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing to be aware of is autopull. Autopull used to be great but<br/>\nyou DEFINATLY do not want to be using it now. Autopulling now just ensures<br/>\nthat cazic starts DTing people at random much sooner than later.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
