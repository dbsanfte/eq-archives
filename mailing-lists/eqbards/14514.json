It looks like a lute, feels like a lute, and is even called a lute, <br/>\nbut it doesn&#39;t affect Hymn healing rates and you can wield it in one hand <br/>\nand a weapon in the other - for a brief time I ran around wielding a lute <br/>\nand sword &#39;cause I loved the confused /tells I got.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How do you DO that?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Bard magic - trickery and legerdemain.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno about you folks, but I love finding stuff like this to do = )<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n~Flying Brethren~<br/>\nFleet Footed Singin&#39; Fool<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
