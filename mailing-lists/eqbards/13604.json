Being the only Bard part<br/>\nof the raiding party, I received this instrument with no contest. It appears<br/>\nto be a flute by picture, I however, cannot find any information regarding<br/>\nthis items and any effects it may have. I cannot think of any way to test<br/>\nany possible increased effect, due to the fact that it is a wind instrument.<br/>\nDoes anyone have any knowledge of this item, or know of a way that I might<br/>\ntest any effects it may have? Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDowns DePunisher<br/>\n50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nThe Elitists, Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
