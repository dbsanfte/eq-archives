Other <br/>\nstats were the same so I&#39;m assuming they just gave the armor an AC buff.  If <br/>\nanyone could direct me to a website or list the AC changes I&#39;d appreciate <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 49 Bard of Qeynos Solusek Ro<br/>\nAnthem<br/>\nLevel 2 Bard of Qeynos Inoruuk<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
