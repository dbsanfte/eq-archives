It usually isn&#39;t as crowded as the chessboard and the loot<br/>\nis much better there. <br/>\nAnother good choice would be the orc camps in Lesser Faydark. They are<br/>\nalways completly empty and the level range there is 7-10 at most of the camps.<br/>\nWith the lull song you can even go solo there.<br/>\nIf you just want good loot and don&#39;t care about the EXP go to the bandit<br/>\ncamps in Lesser Faydark. They are always very crowded but you can earn about<br/>\n10pp per hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthelas<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSent through Global Message Exchange - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net\">http://www.gmx.net</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
