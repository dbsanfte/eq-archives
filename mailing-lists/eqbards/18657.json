But I really doubt if this is Bard<br/>\nDancing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen the anim of the Male bard that looks kind<br/>\nof like a Pied Piper jumping on eggs when the male<br/>\nbard plays the flute. I can only assume this is the<br/>\ndancing that people are talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we have another DANCE anim ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLaters,<br/>\nSonger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
