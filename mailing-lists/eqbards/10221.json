Recently Brad answered some<br/>\nquestions about that and while I don&#39;t remember it exactly it was something<br/>\nalong the lines of not wanting to put in a hard level cap onitems. Why?<br/>\nBecause if somebody goes through a lot of trouble of doing a new quest or<br/>\nkilling some mob and gets a item he can&#39;t use why should he not be able to<br/>\nuse it on a new character?

Now I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; own a car like this but would like to, and could certainly do so, if I so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; choose, because I&#39;ve already gone to college and have a career making a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>very<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; nice salary (i.e. &quot;paid my dues&quot;). SO...If we take this line of thinking<br/>\n&gt;&gt; then it would be fair or kind for me to say he doesn&#39;t deserve the car<br/>\n&gt;&gt; because he didn&#39;t earn it, and so SHOULDN&#39;T have it??? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (just a little playing the D Advocate here)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m speaking in universal generalities.  One student having a<br/>\n&gt;car given to him by his parents is pretty irrelevant.  OTOH,<br/>\n&gt;if 80% of the students at a college have expensive cars given<br/>\n&gt;to them by their parents, then that may be a factor in your<br/>\n&gt;decision to (not) attend that college.  It alters the living<br/>\n&gt;(playing) environment, to the dislike of some and to the like<br/>\n&gt;of others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Given the half-hearted attempts Verant has made to thwart<br/>\n&gt;twinking, they&#39;ve legitimized the viewpoint that you SHOULDN&#39;T<br/>\n&gt;have expensive cars given to you by well-to-do parents in this<br/>\n&gt;game.  I don&#39;t have a problem with people who want to twink.<br/>\n&gt;I do have a problem with them wanting to do it in a game where<br/>\n&gt;the designers don&#39;t want them to twink.  IMHO the ideal<br/>\n&gt;solution given infinite resources would be to have some<br/>\n&gt;servers a twink-fest, and others twink-free, to support both<br/>\n&gt;ends of the spectrum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That aside, please remember that we each have our own opinion and are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; entitled to those opinions. Its OKAY if people disagree with your opinion<br/>\n&gt;&gt; regardless of the issue at hand (sometimes I have to remind myself of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; What people seem to be objecting to, IMO, is how mean-sounding it was for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that person to say &quot;... you don&#39;t deserve....&quot; etc (and I know that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>person<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; probably didn&#39;t mean it to come across as harsh as it sounded???). BUT,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Um, if there is nothing in the game that you don&#39;t deserve,<br/>\n&gt;then there is no advancement, and you have the ultimate<br/>\n&gt;monty-haul game.  It may sound harsh to say you don&#39;t deserve<br/>\n&gt;something at a certain level, but that&#39;s the fundamental basis<br/>\n&gt;of advancement in a level-based roleplaying game.  If you<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t like it, then you probably shouldn&#39;t be playing an<br/>\n&gt;advancement-based RPG.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
