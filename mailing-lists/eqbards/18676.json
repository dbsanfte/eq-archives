I believe that<br/>\nthe max gain is 3 points per level. Thus, at level 11 your 1 h slash will<br/>\ncap at 60 but your hand to hand will cap at 34.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are going to do an instrument attack, I suggest going against mobs<br/>\nthat do not dot you. Avoid spiders and asps. Stick with Young Kodiaks, Giant<br/>\nScarabs and Orcs (if you are staying in the Freeport vicinity) At level 12<br/>\nyou gain Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow and you may want to consider taking on<br/>\nwisps. Wisps are magic only to hit, but in a an all song attack, that&#39;s not<br/>\na problem. (try to pick up magic gloves though so you can punch the wisps)<br/>\nWisps are great exp and good loot, just be careful because they hit hard at<br/>\nlower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nBard of the Tribunal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Webber, Jessica [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 17, 2000 9:12 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;; &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tunare@egroups.com\">tunare@egroups.com</a>&#39;; &#39;Sisterhood&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] ...but it&#39;s still easier than playing a rogue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings all!<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried my first all-instrument attack last night.  I was battling blues in<br/>\nthe Southeast corner of West Commons and the Southwest corner of East<br/>\nCommons.  First I tried a giant spider in WC.  It took me down to two<br/>\nbubbles, but I won.  And I got hand to hand up to 3!  Woohoo!  So I tried<br/>\nanother spider, which also took me down to two bubbles, and got hand to hand<br/>\nup to 4.  Then a ghoul showed up so I moved to EC and attacked an asp.<br/>\nWell, an &quot;asp&quot; got whooped alright, but it wasn&#39;t the snake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I retrieve my corpse and try another asp.  I show my wisdom by zoning<br/>\nbefore I die, but display my lack of intelligence by not leaving myself<br/>\nenough HPs to survive the poison.  I loose consciousness the minute I hit<br/>\nWC, never getting Hymn started.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDONG!  You have lost a level!  Welcome back to level 10, dummy!  <br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I retrieve my corpse and ditch the instruments in favor of my FS 1H<br/>\nslasher and kite shield (don&#39;t I feel twinked &lt;g&gt;) and look for some more<br/>\nspiders.  I attack one and another joins in.  I swear this is the first time<br/>\nI&#39;ve ever seen a giant spider assist another.  I mean I know spiders are<br/>\nlike that, but I&#39;ve just never seen it happen.  I&#39;ve also never noticed<br/>\nspiders stunning me before.  I just BARELY make the zone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBack on the EC side I try my luck with another asp.  Wicked close, this<br/>\nbattle.  I loose consciousness twice, but survive.  I search for another<br/>\nsnake but instead find a lesser mummy.  So I head back to WC.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAn asp is there waiting for me.  I fair better with this one.  It&#39;s still a<br/>\nclose call, but I don&#39;t loose consciousness.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDING!  You have gained a level!  Welcome back to level 11!  Be more careful<br/>\nthis time, silly!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMore careful?  Me?  Heh.  It occurs to me that if I can get my H to H skill<br/>\n(currently at 5) up to where my 1H slash skill is (57) that I might just be<br/>\nable to kick some asp.  WC is empty, so I zone back to EC and find another<br/>\nserpent.  The battle commences but is not looking promising.  So I ditch the<br/>\nlute mid-battle.  Victory!  Woohoo!  I find another asp.  I reequip my lute<br/>\nand this time don&#39;t stop playing until about 2/3 of the way through the<br/>\nbattle.  Victory!  Woohoo!  I find another asp.  I reequip my lute and this<br/>\ntime stop playing the moment I switched to 3rd person view and discover I&#39;ve<br/>\nactually found a nest of asps.  Run away!  Woohoo!  I equip my drum and get<br/>\nmy asp out of there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in WC I spy a spider creeping along.  I reequip my lute and this time<br/>\ndon&#39;t stop playing until...<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in Freeport a guildmate accuses me of hanging out at the tavern<br/>\ndrinking.  Why anyone would assume I&#39;m at a tavern just because they keep<br/>\nseeing me in Freeport is beyond me.  But anyway, I run back to WC and<br/>\nreequip my lute just long enough to bonk myself on the head with it, then I<br/>\nput it away in favor of more conventional weaponry.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother dead spider, another dead asp.  Things are looking up.  So I start<br/>\nthinking about that hand to hand skill again, wondering how much damage I<br/>\n*could* be doing.  Well... <br/>\n<br/>\nLittle miss bard<br/>\ndid her shield discard<br/>\nand picked up her lute to play<br/>\nalong came a spider<br/>\nwith poison insider her<br/>\nsaying &quot;Minstrel, this isn&#39;t your day&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nI retrieve my corpse and equip my drum.  This time I don&#39;t stop playing<br/>\nuntil I reach the tavern.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSpecial Offer-Earn 300 Points from MyPoints.com for trying @Backup<br/>\nGet automatic protection and access to your important computer files.<br/>\nInstall today:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/2344/10/_/451022/_/958569117/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/2344/10/_/451022/_/958569117/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
