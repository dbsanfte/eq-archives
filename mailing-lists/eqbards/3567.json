The mass market, RPG newcomer.   The game is complex by<br/>\n&gt;design, lightly documented by design, and often daunting, and far too many<br/>\n&gt;folks bypass the built in training curve via various methods, leaving them<br/>\n&gt;at moderately high levels with very deficient play skills (and character<br/>\n&gt;skills).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Those folks tended to die a lot more often than was necessary all of a<br/>\n&gt;sudden, and watching that exp bar keep dropping was pretty discouraging,<br/>\n&gt;especially when you didn&#39;t learn from your mistakes.

Hitting the level cap in 45<br/>\n&gt;days is appalling to me.  Hitting it in 120 days, no matter how dedicated a<br/>\n&gt;player you are, still makes me twitch and drool some.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the case of Bind Affinity, there&#39;s more than enough bind capable players<br/>\n&gt;online on any server at any time to accommodate player needs.
