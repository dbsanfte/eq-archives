For the most part a casters<br/>\nlife at high levels in cast a spell and then go back to medding. Why because<br/>\nwith a healer a tank has no down time and sincem ana takes so long to regain<br/>\nmost of the time your stuck with your head in a book. I play both a paladin<br/>\nand a Necromancer as my main characters and while you get bored running<br/>\naround I guaruntee you it&#39;s a lot more fun in battle and in dungeons for you<br/>\nthen your caster friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, September 30, 1999 7:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada: what you say in your last sentence sums up the whole issue.  For me<br/>\n&gt;at least, the time spent travelling back to your corpse from multiple zones<br/>\n&gt;away is not fun and completely boring.  That time could be better spent<br/>\n&gt;adventuring, which is the fun part of EQ to me.  Lets say on average it<br/>\n&gt;takes you 15 minutes to get back to your corpse.  If you could get bound in<br/>\n&gt;non-cities, the amount of EXP you could gain during those 15 minutes is<br/>\n&gt;nowhere near the amount you lost when you died.  However, you get to spend<br/>\n&gt;that 15 minutes playing the game in whatever manner makes it fun for you.<br/>\n&gt;IMO, the binding issue isn&#39;t a class balance issue but a &quot;Is this really<br/>\n&gt;what I want to be spending my valuable game time doing&quot; issue.  Don&#39;t take<br/>\n&gt;any offense, but based on the fact that you have a 50th level character and<br/>\n&gt;two 20+ level characters, you obviously have more time to devote to playing<br/>\n&gt;EQ than I do.  My only character is my 23d level bard and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>\n&gt;him since April.  That gives you a pretty good idea how much time I get to<br/>\n&gt;play.  As I have said before, for casual gamers who don&#39;t get to play EQ<br/>\n&gt;that much, not being able to bind in non-cities has a major impact.  When I<br/>\n&gt;die, that pretty much writes off the rest of the gaming session for me.<br/>\n&gt;Thats why I support a change to the policy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas) [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 1:25 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sorry i don&#39;t see the connection.  i advocate not letting melee/hybrid<br/>\n&gt;&gt; classes to be able to bind, making the game harder.  how does that make<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; easier to &quot;win&quot; or have anything to do with what you said?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; no one likes dying, not just some folks.  that&#39;s the point, it is bad to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; die.  if there were no consequences, there would be no challenge.  is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; what you are referring to, my point of the game being a challenge?  this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; has<br/>\n&gt;&gt; nothing to do with wanting to win, it has only to do with wanting to have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fun, and not being bored.  it is after all a game, and if you are not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; having<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fun, you shouldn&#39;t be playing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Shada<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; enough of a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; penalty, thank you very much.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is where the paradigm falls back to singlemindset games<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; - that there<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; has to be a way to &#39;keep score&#39; - that puts the emphasis on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; advancement and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; competition with others - instead of living in the world, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; working with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; others.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; You cannot &#39;win&#39; in a persistent world - nor should the goals be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; artificially propped up to encourage that attitude.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One of EQs major shortcomings - is there is a perceived<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;end&#39;.
