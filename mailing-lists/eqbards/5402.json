I have a 23rd monk that works his butt off and he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; never had more than about 125pp in the bank at any one time.  I&#39;ve spent time<br/>\n&gt; in unrest.  Where&#39;s the money there?  FS weapons?  The cash drops aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; *that* great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired of reading about<br/>\n&gt; how others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably a little harder now. The people who talk about making 100+<br/>\nplat a trip to Unrest may, like me, have been in the group ahead of the<br/>\nbell curve of player population. When I was playing in unrest, you could<br/>\nsell small bronze chests for 70pp, with other pieces proportionate.<br/>\nThat, plus specials I got I couldn&#39;t use, like Savant&#39;s caps,<br/>\nbloodstained gloves, a second and then third bloodstained mantle, plus<br/>\nfine steel and the cash dropped by mobs put me into partial steel plate<br/>\nby L25 (at that time no one had a clue where medium bronze could be<br/>\nfound) After I moved on from Unrest to Cazic and we started finding<br/>\nrubicite, my bank went up even faster, as I replaced my steel with Rubi.<br/>\nThat was an interesting time, as instead of the case you have now, where<br/>\nyou can&#39;t get a templar or diviner because of campers and kill stealers,<br/>\nwe had the problem or trying to figure out how to break the spawn in the<br/>\nthrone room with just the 10-12 people who were down there. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nuntil the guy who got the first pair of rubi legs went to unrest to show<br/>\nthem off that the crowds started showing up, and even that took a while<br/>\nas he told everyone who asked that he&#39;d got them in Guk. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
