I guess that the bard&#39;s role will depend on the composition<br/>\nof the rest of the team (groups.) When we (my guild) goes to do some plane<br/>\nstuff, we make sure we have enough clerics, enchanters, and tanks.  Our SOP<br/>\n(standard operating procedure) is built around those classes.  I guess some<br/>\nothers will vary the mix and use more clerics and tanks and skip the<br/>\nenchaters or have one enchanter who is the clarity caster and trys not to<br/>\nget killed. Our enchanters do crowd control and are fairly often getting<br/>\nkilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, one big part of my role is mana bard.  I&#39;ll typically get grouped with a<br/>\ncleric and an enchanter and a couple tank types (and hopefully *not* the<br/>\npuller.)  The cleric has to spend a lot of mana keeping the enchater alive<br/>\nand really does not want to have to worry about me. So in those instances<br/>\nwhere the enchanter is in critical need of support, I will stay out of the<br/>\nmelee and stay close to the cleric with mana song playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we go for a dragon, my group will usually be 2 or 3 tanks, 2 clerics,<br/>\nme and maybe a caster if only 2 tanks.  We will get right next to the<br/>\ndragon.  I stay by the cleric and tell the tanks to stay close to us.  At<br/>\nfirst, I weave elemental and guardian with my Mistmoore drun and my palette<br/>\nset for a quick switch to Hymn & Niv&#39;s with my 7 string lute - in case the<br/>\ncleric get LOM and low health or dies and the tanks need some healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting back to the planes.  If you are set for a pull and know what the mob<br/>\nwill fight you with, you can select songs accordingly.  There are some mobs<br/>\nthat do AE cancel magic or pilliage enchantment (they strip your buffs.)<br/>\nThere is another one that does AE drain stamina (excellent time to play Jig<br/>\nof Vigor - no stamina means slower weapon speed and casters cant med when<br/>\nthey have 0 stamina.)  Some mobs have poison base and others have disease<br/>\nbase and of course some have magic base.  So, the Planar bard should know<br/>\nthese things and be ready to provide the appropriate resist buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a bard in a group could really shine - especially if they are going<br/>\nin with a group that does not have an enchater or tanks who dont have haste<br/>\ngear.  But the groups I have gone with have always been my guild and we have<br/>\nboth enchanters and haste gear. I need to go build some xp so I can venture<br/>\nforth one again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 50 songs<br/>\n... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 03, 2000 12:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Waki or Yaki...
