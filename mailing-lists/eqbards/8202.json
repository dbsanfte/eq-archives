It seems the kill <br/>\njunk for Giant spawn works in South Ro just like Rathe. When no giants are <br/>\nspawned, we kill all the mummies, madmen, and pumas and Giants seem to start <br/>\npoping. Heh, not many folks in the desert of S Ro so last night we had a <br/>\ntrain contest for low level junk! Since warriors can use this weapon, lots <br/>\nof my guildmates are helping so I have group to hunt there. The SG with the <br/>\nplans is fairly low, but we kill any SG that pops for exp. This weapons <br/>\nstats show it is heavier than a barbed whip, so I don&#39;t know that I will <br/>\nswitch to it permanently from banded Thulians. Barbed whips weren&#39;t lore, I <br/>\nused to dual wield 2 of them.<br/>\nBTW, being a wood elf woman and a RL woman, I think the male art needs some <br/>\nimprovements! If I have to run around in a skimpy suit dead, why do all my <br/>\nmale friends have almost full cothing! I even accused one of our paladins of <br/>\ngetting me killed alot so he could see my undies, hehe. Thank God for Barbs <br/>\nand those wonderful kilts! I have only been harassed for being female twice <br/>\nseriously and my guildmates all proceeded to gang up and intimidate the <br/>\nperson sufficiently to end it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeveling by accident, playing for fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (L34)<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
