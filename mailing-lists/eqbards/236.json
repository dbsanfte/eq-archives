I know that the 8th level song, Lament, is only<br/>\navailable in Kelethin as is 11 and 13 I think. A few higher level songs seem<br/>\navailable at all bard guilds but most of them will be hidden in other remote<br/>\nplaces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSure, tehre are some lists around on the internet listing the locations of<br/>\nmost of the songs but I think it is more fun to ask fellow bards in-game<br/>\nwhere they might be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Heather [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heathers24@...\">heathers24@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 23, 1999 7:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Heather &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heathers24@...\">heathers24@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am new to this list and have read two digests so far. I just reached<br/>\n8th level a few days ago and was curious about a few things.<br/>\nMy bardess resides in Kelethin and the guild there only sells songs up to<br/>\nthe<br/>\n7th level song. I am curious as to where I would obtain the rest of the<br/>\nsongs.<br/>\nNot sure where to start looking for them or if they are quests. The guild<br/>\nleader<br/>\nin Kelethin only gives out drums for four spiderling silks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like for the information either on the list or emailed to me<br/>\ndirectly<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nKristin- Wood elf of Kelethin<br/>\n8th level Bardess<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow mom you love her.
