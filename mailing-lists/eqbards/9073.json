This weekend I was grouped with a warrior and a mage, both a few levels higher than me, killing guards in Nektulos forest (very enjoyable if you&#39;ve never done it =D). The mage would wait by the E Commons zone while the warrior would pull, with me in tow providing speed. I never touched the guards and we made it back by the zone with plenty of time for me to turn off all music and switch to weapons before they reached us. Every time they would go straight for me! The mage began casting a damage shield on me after she realized I needed it as much or more than the warrior. I did not start Anthem or Hymn until after the battle was begun, but it didn&#39;t seem to matter. Pulling back from the melee would often drag a guard along. I guess evil races just don&#39;t appreciate patriotic music.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nMeandering Maestro of the 17th Song<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
