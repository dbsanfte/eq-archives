Every named","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1134409263\">Simple solution to this, given a day to think about it I could come up<br/>\nwith 5 better ways (and thus have a variety of ways for different<br/>\ndungeons).<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery named mob in the dungeon drops a lore, no drop widget (make it<br/>\napproprtiate to the dungeon).  The boss has a lor, no drop container, in<br/>\nwhich you put the widgets, hit combine, get the reward.  A really clever<br/>\nprogrammer could even make diminishing returns for not including all the<br/>\nwidgets.  I essentially did this in many of the Gold Box Construction<br/>\nSet adventures I wrote (remember those?).  Usually it was done a little<br/>\nmore cleverly than that, but you get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith some clever programming, the EQ engine could easily give the game<br/>\nwe want it to be, just takes some time.  Also I want to volunteer my<br/>\ntime to them to write the bard song creation for EQ2.  I think JKim<br/>\nmentioned it, but I envision a sheet of music paper where you combine<br/>\nnotes, accents, rests, tempos, etc... The end result is the song you are<br/>\nsinging.  You learn more as you go up levels, plus the ability to<br/>\ncombine various techniques into a single song.  How great would that<br/>\nbe?  It would not be that hard to write, plus a song book (which lets<br/>\nyou name and save your songs could all be done and saved client side,<br/>\nmaking it easy on the server).<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont say this to criticize EQ&#39;s bards.  They have done for bards what<br/>\nBaldur&#39;s Gate did for thieves.  (made them unique and useful).  I just<br/>\nthink their base system could be so much more.  How much fun would it be<br/>\nto make your &quot;Overture of Wizard Wariness&quot; by combining some elemental<br/>\nresitance with a quick targeted stun effect? (I think accented notes<br/>\nwould give the stun effect personally)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A true dungeon crawl in EQ would only work if at the end of the dungeon<br/>\n&gt; there was some type of reward that provided enough incentive to not camp.<br/>\n&gt; This could be a major EXP gain from killing the boss mob or a treasure chest<br/>\n&gt; that contained several items in it.  The level of the mobs throughout the<br/>\n&gt; dungeon would have to be close enough that the party got EXP for mobs both<br/>\n&gt; at the beginning and at the end.  There would also have to be a mechanism to<br/>\n&gt; prevent a party from camping the boss mob over and over again. Lot more<br/>\n&gt; other factors but these are the key ones.  Most likely in the &quot;to hard to<br/>\n&gt; do&quot; category for EQ.  Maybe not for EQ2.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
