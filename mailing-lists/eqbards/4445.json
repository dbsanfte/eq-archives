I&#39;m not too sure the legitimacy of this claim, but if it&#39;s true,<br/>\n&gt;that will put us over the top as pvp gods.  And of course there&#39;s other<br/>\n&gt;tactics, but none so devastating as the ones previously mentioned (unless<br/>\n&gt;someone can think of any, and I would be thrilled to hear of any more).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I cant get this song to do squat. On mobs it will pulse with the animation<br/>\nthat looks like selo&#39;s accelerando on us, and this will irritate the<br/>\ncreature causing them to attack me but thats all i can tell. I tried<br/>\ndualing a friend and it wouldnt even pulse on them, though it was<br/>\nirritating the snakes and bats around me. For that matter, i couldnt even<br/>\nget the dissonance to hurt them. Bellows hurt them, and i could wack all<br/>\nday on them with my weapons, but no aoe song hit them. Didnt try fear now<br/>\nthat i think of it... this happened before todays patch but after the last<br/>\npatch. Anybody know what was going on here? I am going to try this again<br/>\ntoday after this patch and see what happens...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
