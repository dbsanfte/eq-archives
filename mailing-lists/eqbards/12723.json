I am still toying with the thought<br/>\nof starting one, although from reading on this list how much people<br/>\nhate them, I&#39;m taking a second look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Everyone has opinions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Every server is being aflicted by a power guild(s) taking over the <br/>\n&gt;   things that 90% of the rest of the server would like to do.  This<br/>\n&gt;   in every way affects Bards... and Enchanters, and Warriors, and etc.<br/>\n&gt;   In the past this list has proposed solutions to non-bard questions,<br/>\n&gt;   thus is the nature of the list to investigate and solve problems.<br/>\n&gt;   I can guarentee that this list distributes more in-game mechanics<br/>\n&gt;   than any of list out there.  But more than that, it distributes <br/>\n&gt;   a fun and cheerful attitude.
