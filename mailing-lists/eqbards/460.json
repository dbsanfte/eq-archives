I didn&#39;t do the tests<br/>\nmyself, and some assumptions have been made in the statistics, but the<br/>\nperson who posted this has been very reputable so far. If you have any<br/>\ndoubts about the value of a bard in healing, read on...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Dendall, Ollave of the Aegis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\nThis is interesting.  I must get try to get a magician to conjure some<br/>\nbandages for me.  I take it they weren&#39;t real enthusiastic since I hear that<br/>\nit is more trouble than it is worth for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou 1hp per 4 skill seems quite accurate since I have 45 skill now and I<br/>\nseem to get 10-12 per bandage now.  Hard to tell exact numbers since I&#39;m<br/>\nusually poisoned and have my own healing going at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately the anecdotal 100 hps per bandage seems to be out of line<br/>\nthen.  Still, at level 15 my max bind wound would be 80 giving me 20 hits<br/>\nper bandage and my hits would be around 480 (for my warrior).  To heal<br/>\nnormally from 0 to full would take 240 ticks (or around 20 minutes, a tick<br/>\nis about 5 seconds by my reckoning).<br/>\nBandages seem to take two full ticks to apply, so working it out with<br/>\nbandaging I get 22 ticks for the first half ((11 bandages * 20 hits)+20<br/>\nheal) plus 120 ticks for the second half, for a total of 142 ticks (or<br/>\nalmost 12 minutes).  Not bad, a saving of eight minutes valuable play time<br/>\nfor the cost of 11 bandages (7 gold at the shop rates).<br/>\n<br/>\nI did some checking on the healing rate with the bard healing song and I<br/>\ndiscovered that this is +6 hits per tick for a 12th Bard when using his<br/>\nlute.  So here&#39;s a table of some figures (feel free to question the accuracy<br/>\nsince I&#39;m just slapping this out, I&#39;m especially interested if anyone thinks<br/>\nthat the number of seconds for a heal tick and the number of seconds for a<br/>\nbind wound are wrong)<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume a bind wound skill of 80 and 480 hit points, the time given is to go<br/>\nfrom 0 to 480 hits, bandage costs assume a store price of 6.6 silver, and<br/>\nthe figures are rough<br/>\n<br/>\nPerson standing\t\t\t480 ticks\t40 minutes\tJust for<br/>\nreference, but same as diseased person sitting<br/>\nPerson sitting\t\t\t240 ticks\t20 minutes<br/>\nTroll sitting\t\t\t120 ticks\t10 minutes\tTroll<br/>\nwarriors rule!  Accept no substitute :&gt;<br/>\nPerson being bandaged\t\t142 ticks\t12 minutes\tOnly 2<br/>\nminutes to get to half, but costs 7 gold<br/>\nTroll being bandaged\t\t78 ticks\t\t6.5 minutes\t1.5<br/>\nminutes to get to half, costs 6 gold<br/>\nPerson sitting w. healing song\t60 ticks\t\t5 minutes<br/>\nTroll sitting w. healing song\t48 ticks\t\t4 minutes<br/>\nPerson w. bandages & song\t44 ticks\t\t3.7 minutes<br/>\nBandages save little time, probably not worth the cost<br/>\nTroll w. bandages & song\t36 ticks\t\t3 minutes<br/>\nDitto, cost 3 gold to save 1 minute<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes it clear that a bard is a very valuable commodity, even if they<br/>\njust did the healing.  Bandages are worthwhile to bring yourself up to half<br/>\nin the absence of other healing, and they have the advantage that you can<br/>\nstep out of combat for a minute and heal over a hundred hits.  It is also<br/>\nuseful to bring yourself above one bubble so you can run properly and get<br/>\nyourself out of a dangerous area.  You need to be able to throw around some<br/>\ngold though.  They can save your ass, and your friends asses so I think it<br/>\nis a worthwhile skill to have, but no one is going to complain that it is<br/>\ntoo powerful.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
