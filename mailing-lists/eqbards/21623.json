(20min spawn so it wasn&#39;t so bad<br/>\ntrying over)  anyway, a druid guildmate and i were dotting the junk out of<br/>\nhim and he died with relative ease, other than blinding us to no end, and<br/>\nfearing us all over WK... ok, the first time we tried it was a dot, snare<br/>\ncharm approach. we&#39;d both dot, she&#39;d snare, and i charmed to keep him from<br/>\ncasting on us during the times where he was dot&#39;ed. well at one point in the<br/>\nbattle, we were both blinded, and i was too far from him to determine what<br/>\nhealth he had remaining, so i commenced to charm him again. just as i did,<br/>\nshe said in group &quot;DIE&quot;... well little did i know he had just a sliver left.<br/>\nso he died. of course while under charm spell.. argh body poofed. no biggie.<br/>\nwe waited for respawn. tried again by just dotting, worked well, well still<br/>\ndropped no head. so the 3rd time i decided, maybe he needs this note to<br/>\ncough up the head. she harmonied him and i walked up to give him the note.<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t say a word as i recall. just proceeded to attack as always. i<br/>\nthought well he has the note now, he&#39;ll give the head for sure... yeah ok..<br/>\nlol<br/>\n<br/>\nso now i have no note (not impossible to get again, just not worth it)...<br/>\nbut was wondering if you need to have him under charm,like gix in commons,<br/>\nto get the note for thex mallet quest.  if anyone has the note, or is about<br/>\nto get it, inform us of your success, not a carbon copy of this =)<br/>\n<br/>\nPava Rahti<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.  yes, and this human necromancer mysteriously drops an ERU Wiz only<br/>\nrobe (ac2 wt 0.7) lore though =( can&#39;t start a collection hehe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
