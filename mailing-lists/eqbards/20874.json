Some of my best<br/>\nfriends on Rodcet Nife are from pickup groups...one<br/>\nguy I am grouping with now (mid 30s) I first met in<br/>\nCrushbone at 7th lvl and haven&#39;t seen him since until<br/>\nthis week.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I&#39;ve seen some really bad things<br/>\ntoo.  I won&#39;t bore anyone with more horror stories, my<br/>\nrule of thumb though, is that if I get a bad feeling<br/>\nabout a group or if they don&#39;t work well together, I<br/>\nexcuse myself and move on.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Kevin L.

Pickup groups were nearly as good as some<br/>\n&gt; of our guild groups,<br/>\n&gt; some were worse but none were as bad as some of the<br/>\n&gt; things you&#39;ve related on<br/>\n&gt; this board ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IMO Pickup groups are awesome because you get to<br/>\n&gt; learn new tactics to go<br/>\n&gt; with other people who you aren&#39;t used to grouping<br/>\n&gt; with.  Maybe I just adapt<br/>\n&gt; on the fly better.  Maybe you just have some really<br/>\n&gt; lousy players on your<br/>\n&gt; server ;)  Dunno.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with a<br/>\n&gt; pickup group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Biggest Key in a pickup group:  Talk about who&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; going to do what before you<br/>\n&gt; head anywhere in the dungeon.

So unless you<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to guk with a group, hope there&#39;s someone in the<br/>\n&gt; tower allready so ya can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; join up with them, or ya might end up like me last<br/>\n&gt; night, with a warrior<br/>\n&gt; &gt; getting to the bridge, yelling uh oh and training<br/>\n&gt; all the wizards and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gibs to the BR. needless to say i didnt make it to<br/>\n&gt; the zone.
