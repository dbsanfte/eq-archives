I was feeling a bit reckless, and figured I&#39;d see how fast GF<br/>\n&gt; really is... so I ran under him (GrimFeather hits YOU for 72 points of<br/>\n&gt; damage!) and sped off.  Well, turns out he is quite a bit slower than me<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; 36 with MM drums.  So now I am wondering if there is anything in the world<br/>\n&gt; faster than me other than Shadowed Men and higher-level bards...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n&gt; fleet-footed fool<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
