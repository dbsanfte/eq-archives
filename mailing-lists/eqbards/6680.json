If someone has SoW<br/>\non him and a bard in his group plays a faster Accelerando, he<br/>\nshould get the Accelerando boost.

Right now<br/>\nthe only bard-specific items are instruments, one of which<br/>\ncomes from Nagafen the dragon, one which comes from a L30ish<br/>\nmob in Mistmoore, and the rest of which are no different from<br/>\nstore bought instruments.  Oh, and the PoF items, not that any<br/>\nbard is going to be getting them soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some more useful songs. And I&#39;ld like to see them stop<br/>\n&gt; nerfing us without reguard to the results. I won&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; get into balance, as right now I feel we are underbalanced<br/>\n&gt; now and others seem to think we are just fine. Anyway<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In terms of balance, I think we&#39;re still pretty well balanced.<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see us get either another defensive skill, or the<br/>\ncap on dodge raised to 200.  The defensive skills are dodge,<br/>\nblock, parry, and riposte.  Because we&#39;re not supposed to be<br/>\nfull tanks, we only get one out of four.  And then for some<br/>\nstrange reason the one we get is capped at half what the other<br/>\ntanks get?  That puts our defensive ability closer to casters<br/>\nthan to tanks.  In fact I&#39;ll need to ask my cleric friends<br/>\nwhat the cap on their dodge skill is.  I have the sinking<br/>\nfeeling they&#39;re just as good at tanking as we are (better<br/>\neven since they&#39;re usually using a shield).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
