(or something like that?)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Those lava beetles have rarely done that to me, so I never<br/>\n  bother to twist in FR.  Lava beetles seem to hit harder<br/>\n  than ldcs, but dont have nearly the hp.  Pretty quick and<br/>\n  easy kills, good exp.  As for the sonic bats, I find that<br/>\n  if the caster with Resist Magic puts it on everyone, I dont<br/>\n  need to twist any Magic buffs in, and can concerntrate on<br/>\n  other songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last night I bought the L48 song, wasnt as impressed as I <br/>\n  wanted to be.  Pulled about 15 creatures in freeport to a<br/>\n  corner and pulsed it on them.  I was expecting them to die<br/>\n  instantly, but they all took a while.  On the second tick<br/>\n  of the DoT they all died.  I think I need to look into the<br/>\n  dmg factor on that song again, it&#39;s not as high as I&#39;ve <br/>\n  been told or expected.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On the Song Analysis site, Satori you stated that a shaman<br/>\n  should debuff the mob before this song is played.  However,<br/>\n  just like togors and chains, this song will block debuffs <br/>\n  and override existing debuffs.  This is very easy to prove<br/>\n  when fighting ice giants.  Togors has an extremely powerful<br/>\n  slowdown effect on ice giants, as soon as I pulse Binding,<br/>\n  Chains, or Cessation... the ice giant returns to it&#39;s normal<br/>\n  speed with my minor slowdown on it.  Basically instead of<br/>\n  the ice giant hitting me every 3-5 seconds, it returns to<br/>\n  pounding my ass into the ground every 1-2 seconds.  I still<br/>\n  need to look into that more though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
