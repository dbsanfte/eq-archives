You *can* re-strike a mob that&#39;s already<br/>\n&gt;under the effect of Pixie Strike.  You can &quot;pause&quot; a mob<br/>\n&gt;pretty much indefinitely by Striking it over and over,<br/>\n&gt;although high blues and higher seem to resist enough to make<br/>\n&gt;this a dicey strategy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually Pixie Strike has made a lvl 50 bard almost a requirement in the<br/>\nnew PoF. Last week our server finally broke into the PoF again after many,<br/>\nmany abortive attempts. We kept having to evac out when more than 2 mobs<br/>\ncame cause the enchanter couldnt mez the creatures without dying at some<br/>\npoint (they do wake up often, and a lvl 50 enchanter just cant tank :).<br/>\nThen i decided to take out pixie strike and me and another bard would take<br/>\na mob each and lock them down. If the mob was blue to me, i could lock it<br/>\ndown almost 100%, Yellow 75%, and red about 50%. These are rough numbers,<br/>\nbut pretty close to the truth, if it was red both bards would gang up on it<br/>\nand chain cast pixie strike. Using this tactic we took on 4 mobs at once<br/>\nwith 22 people, which was a huge rush for everybody. We couldnt even do<br/>\nthat prepatch with weaker mobs. It felt GREAT to have an immediate an<br/>\nobvious use for my bard, most of our other effects are very subtle and<br/>\neasily over looked. <br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 Bard of Tunare<br/>\nEnoch Lyciferous, lvl 40 Necromancer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
