Don&#39;t like the AE?  Binding has an AC<br/>\ndrop and the same speed reduction as Chains, while Chords (lvl 48) has a<br/>\nfriggin&#39; DoT built in.  I&#39;ve seen countless mobs die to the Chords DoT since<br/>\nI&#39;ve been level 48 - &quot;A mob has died&quot;.  In typical non-Planer melee fighting<br/>\nat level 48 I have the current songs memmed:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Berserker<br/>\n2- Niv&#39;s (will switch for +MR as necessary)<br/>\n3- Chords of Cessation<br/>\n4- Chains<br/>\n5- Selo&#39;s (switches out in dungeons)<br/>\n6- Pixie Strike (I love this song so much)<br/>\n7- Hymn<br/>\n8- Clarity<br/>\n<br/>\nSongs 1,2,3 are the ones that I typically sing in combat.  When mob&#39;s health<br/>\ngets low I switch to 1,2,4 if necessary.  If AE is bad for the<br/>\nmobs/location, or an enchanter is mezzing and Chord&#39;s DoT would be a bad<br/>\nthing, I will use 1,2,4 exclusively or simply swap in something for Chords<br/>\nas appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 20 Mar 2000, Kevin L.

If one gets away though I am the stopper<br/>\n&gt; because I can run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while &quot;casting&quot; and keep the sucker in sight.  I can also stop<br/>\n&gt; them at a LOT<br/>\n&gt; &gt; greater life than a snare can.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree it&#39;s better for stopping runners, but you shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; defer entirely unless you have a shaman or enchanter doing<br/>\n&gt; speed debuffs.  Most rangers and druids have gotten a bit lazy<br/>\n&gt; with snare and just snare at the beginning of a fight.  Unless<br/>\n&gt; the mob is high red (i.e. you&#39;ll have a hard time getting<br/>\n&gt; Chain or snare to stick), I&#39;d recommend Chaining for a good<br/>\n&gt; portion of the fight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talk it through with the snarer and try it out - some mobs die<br/>\n&gt; so quickly it&#39;s not worth it, others you can Chain only to<br/>\n&gt; about half hp before stopping in order to give the snarer<br/>\n&gt; enough time to snare.  Others have so many hp you can Chain<br/>\n&gt; almost until they&#39;re about to run, and the snarer will still<br/>\n&gt; have enough time to snare.  Once I figured out when I needed<br/>\n&gt; to stop Chaining, I&#39;d give a quick &quot;Chain off&quot; message in<br/>\n&gt; groupsay, and the ranger would have enough time for 3-4<br/>\n&gt; attempts at snare.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Remember, a 30%-40% speed debuff is not just equivalent to<br/>\n&gt; increasing your attack speed by 30%-40%, it also means<br/>\n&gt; regeneration/Hymn and meditation/Clarity are 30%-40% more<br/>\n&gt; effective, casters have 30%-40% more time to cast without<br/>\n&gt; being interrupted, and you have 30%-40% more time to react to<br/>\n&gt; changing combat situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
