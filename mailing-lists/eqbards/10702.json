Everything else I <br/>\nlooted when the camping group let me take a turn, or (in the case of the <br/>\nstones) was handed to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe upside to this is that lower level Bards can probably expect to get <br/>\nLambent Armor much earlier than Verant probably intended.  Because <br/>\nall of the components are no-drop (and hence financially worthless), most <br/>\ngroups will let you loot the stuff for nothing.  Just go on the weekend <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s crowded, and bring a good book.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
