We are players.<br/>\n&gt; We pay $10 per month just like you.  The players who played there and got to<br/>\n&gt; high levels SPECIFICALLY so that they could test high level<br/>\n&gt; dungeons/areas/planes/dragons were basically paying verant for the<br/>\n&gt; priveledge of doing their jobs for them.  People that played on test<br/>\n&gt; religiously (I&#39;m not talking about the 5 day wonders that would level to<br/>\n&gt; 17th then go back to a live server) were very religious testers.  Most of us<br/>\n&gt; have been testing this game since Beta 2 or earlier.  Many of those folks<br/>\n&gt; have now left in disgust over their treatment by Verant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IMHO:  Anyone who played on Test should have been playing for free instead<br/>\n&gt; of paying $10 bucks a month.  Just my opinion though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I leave you with this thought:<br/>\n&gt; If there weren&#39;t level 50 players to test the planes, dragons, kunark,<br/>\n&gt; etc... how stable would those zones be on the live servers?  Hope you enjoy<br/>\n&gt; falling through the world for 32,000 dmg when walking across the plane of<br/>\n&gt; hate.  I&#39;ve had it happen.
