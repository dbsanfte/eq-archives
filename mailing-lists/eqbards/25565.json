Even if <br/>\nyou can - a LOT of the &quot;standard&quot; monster rules are suspended for the <br/>\nmonster class.  For example, you can&#39;t give them a weapon.  Like Atonal <br/>\npointed out, there&#39;s also a serious lack of &quot;survivability.&quot;  And <br/>\nultimately, if (god forbid) someone went to the great trouble to do this - <br/>\nremember, it&#39;s a PVP okay server.  In other words, this falls under the <br/>\n&quot;appropriate&quot; guidelines.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
