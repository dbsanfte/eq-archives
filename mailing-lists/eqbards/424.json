I&#39;ve just heard about<br/>\na combine longsword which you can buy at the gipsy camps. Are there other<br/>\ncombine weapons, maybe with better stats than the longsword? I just dont<br/>\nwanna pay all my money for a combine longsword just to hear 1 day later that<br/>\nthere would be a much better combine bastardsword to buy for just 10pp more...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthelas<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSent through Global Message Exchange - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net\">http://www.gmx.net</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
