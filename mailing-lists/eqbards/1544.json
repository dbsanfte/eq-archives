I live in Hawaii so at that time of the night<br/>\n8)there were<br/>\n8)less than 20 people in the zone and we were the only group at<br/>\n8)the dervish<br/>\n8)camp.  We only had four people in the party, a paladin, a<br/>\n8)ranger, a wizard,<br/>\n8)and myself (all around 13th level).  Because we were the only<br/>\n8)party at the<br/>\n8)site, when we arrived the entire camp was full of cutthroats,<br/>\n8)around 6 or 7<br/>\n8)total (fortunately no mages).  Knowing that we couldn&#39;t take<br/>\n8)them all on at<br/>\n8)once, I told the party to stay back and let me do some bard<br/>\n8)magic.  After<br/>\n8)equipping my mandolin, I proceeded to Lament (sadden) three<br/>\n8)cutthroats and<br/>\n8)attacked another one.  I ran back out to where my party was<br/>\n8)and we easily<br/>\n8)dispatched the cutthroats that followed.  Once we were ready,<br/>\n8)we dispatched<br/>\n8)the ones that I had initially Lamented.  After that, we were<br/>\n8)able to take on<br/>\n8)the cutthroats one by one as they respawned.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)After the initials battles, my party thanked me for using the<br/>\n8)Lament tactic.<br/>\n8)They all stated they had grouped with bards before and had<br/>\n8)never seen the<br/>\n8)song used in the manner I had used it.  I thought that was<br/>\n8)odd because I<br/>\n8)heard about the trick from this forum so assumed a lot of<br/>\n8)other people used<br/>\n8)it frequently.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)So what&#39;s the point of this post?  Well, the bard community<br/>\n8)needs to educate<br/>\n8)the other classes on everything that we can do for a party.<br/>\n8)A lot of other<br/>\n8)players seem to think that our main purpose in a group is to<br/>\n8)play Selo,<br/>\n8)Hymn, Anthem, and at higher levels, Mana regen.  I&#39;m only<br/>\n8)13th level but<br/>\n8)I&#39;ve learned there is a lot more to it than that.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)If anyone else knows of similar tactics that only a bard can<br/>\n8)perform I would<br/>\n8)like to hear about them also.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Now for the rant<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)After we cleared out the initial cutthroats, we were pretty<br/>\n8)much able to<br/>\n8)take them on one by one from that point on until we ran into<br/>\n8)a stumbling<br/>\n8)block.  Here is what happened.  The paladin, the ranger and<br/>\n8)myself, aided by<br/>\n8)the Anthem could easily handle one cutthroat at a time.<br/>\n8)However, our wizard<br/>\n8)insisted on expending his mana with direct damage spells even<br/>\n8)though the<br/>\n8)tanks were whittling down the cutthroat without taking that<br/>\n8)much damage.<br/>\n8)The damage we were taking could quickly be healed via the<br/>\n8)Hymn after the<br/>\n8)combat was over.  What eventually happened was that the fully<br/>\n8)healed tanks<br/>\n8)ended up standing around while the wizard meditated.  In the<br/>\n8)meantime, the<br/>\n8)camp fully respawned.  This time, however, there were 3 mages<br/>\n8)plus a couple<br/>\n8)of thugs.  I tried the Lament trick again but a mage resisted<br/>\n8)and everyone<br/>\n8)got waxed except the wizard, who gated.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)I don&#39;t like telling other people how to play their character<br/>\n8)but how do you<br/>\n8)handle a magic user who insists on wasting his mana?  The<br/>\n8)group leader kept<br/>\n8)telling him to save mana but it didn&#39;t do any good.  I can<br/>\n8)see using one<br/>\n8)direct damage spell to help the combat but he would continue<br/>\n8)spellcasting<br/>\n8)once the cutthroat started to flee.  At this point, no one<br/>\n8)was in any danger<br/>\n8)because the cutthroat was fighting back.  He created a lot of needless<br/>\n8)downtime by his actions.  Any other recommendation other than<br/>\n8)finding a<br/>\n8)different group to adventure with?<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Galtin<br/>\n8)E&#39;ci<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n8)----------<br/>\n8)With more than 18 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n8)<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)...ONElist is THE place where the world talks!<br/>\n8)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
