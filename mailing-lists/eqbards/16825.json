What else<br/>\nare we going to use it for :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dirge = cute and useless, nuff said, thx.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure it&#39;s useless but you can use it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  You remind me a lot of myself when I started posting here.<br/>\n  Have to prove everyone wrong.  Have to be all-knowing.  Except,<br/>\n  Shada, I always am all-knowing with her.  I mean how smart can<br/>\n  a female woodelf be?  /chuckle<br/>\n<br/>\nOh give me a break Harm.  You disagree with me, that&#39;s all.  I wasn&#39;t being<br/>\nall knowing.  I was merely posting my opinion on the topic.  Last time I<br/>\nchecked I lived in a free country.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Plus, anyone who cannot make their point without capitalizing a<br/>\n  word in every sentance REALLY is irritating because it LOOKS like<br/>\n  you are SHOUTING at someone because you are ANGRY.  It&#39;s the equivalent<br/>\n  of debating with someone over a topic and then resorting to voice<br/>\n  escalation to flood your point across.  The best debates I receive<br/>\n  come from: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>.  They use<br/>\n  proper grammar, they can spell, and they never ever raise their<br/>\n  voice (so to speak) in the emails.  Sometimes, I wish I could have<br/>\n  the composure they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nProper Nettiquette:  Using allcaps in a sentence is Shouting.  Using allcaps<br/>\non 1 word is used to emphasize that word.  It&#39;s been that way on the<br/>\ninternet since before there was HTML or email clients capable of RTF format.<br/>\nTherefore, since those of us who were around back then learned to talk<br/>\nwithout bold, italics, underline etc, we used allcaps (on 1 word in a<br/>\nsentence) to emphasize the importance of that word.  It&#39;s not shouting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Need to break out my procmail filters again, and run my eqbards mail<br/>\n  through a program that to_lowers everything   /sigh  =(<br/>\n<br/>\nOh give me a break.  1 word and you are getting upset over an issue.  The<br/>\nreason you&#39;re upset, frankly, is that someone disagreed with you and has<br/>\nactually found a use for the song.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the only way to use<br/>\nthe song.  Nor am I saying its the best option.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no, I don&#39;t have to prove everyone wrong.  Just those who post their<br/>\nopinions as if they were the only one possible.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
