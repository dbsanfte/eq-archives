Mobs hate based on &quot;spells&quot;   The reason I<br/>\nthink it &quot;seems&quot; that there is bard hate - we cast a lot more &quot;spells&quot; than<br/>\ncasters since we have no mana requirements.  Add to that - I&#39;m guessing that<br/>\nsystem counts each pulse as an additional casting.  I also guess that group<br/>\nsongs count once per person in the group.  As far as I am aware - all other<br/>\nclasses buffs only affect a target (and probably is cast while you&#39;re not in<br/>\nagro range).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you can see how this can multiply causing the bard to go way up on the<br/>\n&quot;hate list&quot; without an automatic bard-hate.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I don&#39;t believe the bard-hate theory.  I think it is more related<br/>\nto idiosyncrasies of the class balance.  I seemed to suffer from it at lower<br/>\nlevel - but never see it happening to me now.  I tend to group a lot with a<br/>\nDruid and Cleric above me in levels.  I saw the so-called bard-hate a lot up<br/>\nto the late-teens - never see it any more.  I think this &quot;problem&quot; occurs<br/>\nmost in tank-heavy groups.  I&#39;m guessing the &quot;spell&quot; factor weighs heavier<br/>\nthan damage...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - Verant isn&#39;t telling us the details - so we can only guess...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\nLevel 25<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 8:08 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] RE: NO BARD HATE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not to argue semantics, but if all bard songs cause<br/>\n&gt; mobs to hate us and we are the only class that has<br/>\n&gt; songs, doesn&#39;t that equate to bard hate?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Llewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
