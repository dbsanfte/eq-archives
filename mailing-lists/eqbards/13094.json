If we had gone that<br/>\nroute, then I and the other bard could have started playing lullaby at that<br/>\npoint to try and keep all the mobs off the enchanter while he medded.  We<br/>\ndecided that the enchanter would contribute more by casting his charm, stun,<br/>\nand DOT spells and let the two bards handle crowd control.  For each mob we<br/>\nfaced, he would have his pet attack, stun once, DOT once, then med and let<br/>\nthe two tanks and other bard finish off the mob.

Most enchanters I know just cast AE mes again<br/>\n&gt; before the mobs wake up from the previous one.  If something<br/>\n&gt; starts attacking the enchanter, taunt/charm it off him and go<br/>\n&gt; back to work.  (Although in this case it probably wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have worked because the enchanter would&#39;ve been OOM before you<br/>\n&gt; killed everything.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
