Include in the message that we as<br/>\nrepresentatives of the EQ bard community are requesting this not so much as<br/>\na way for us to get detailed explanations of game mechanics but instead as a<br/>\nway to get official confirmation on theories that we have tested and believe<br/>\nto be true.  For example, if someone has a theory on how a song works, the<br/>\nbard programmer could confirm if he was right or not.  If the response is<br/>\nthat the theory is wrong, thats all he has to say.  It would be up to us to<br/>\nfigure it out from there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be wishful thinking on my part but its worth a shot.  If the<br/>\nmoderator doesn&#39;t want to write the letter, I can do it.
