I am very green to be so far from home, lol.  It&#39;s a<br/>\nblessing in some ways ... less to risk making the journey from Kelethin<br/>\nto Rivervale ... if I died all I lost was my guild tunic -- and I gained<br/>\nfood back, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, the reason why I left Kelethin so early is because Quellious<br/>\nis a very young server so all the pc&#39;s were hunting in Faydark.  I have<br/>\na crap computer (P200, 32mb RAM, 8mb StealthII) and with all the other<br/>\nyoung pc&#39;s running around hunting my lag was waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy up.  I<br/>\nspent the whole time running around after npc&#39;s that were no longer<br/>\nthere or that someone else had already started whacking at.  I&#39;d start<br/>\ncombat with something right in front of me and *pop* it&#39;d be 30 feet<br/>\naway dying by someone else&#39;s hand -- you get the picture.  I was getting<br/>\nready to delete the character and make something in Qeynos (I never have<br/>\nthat problem there for some reason) when a friend was making the journey<br/>\nto Freeport.  So I decided to go along for the run just for a change<br/>\nfrom the frustration of swatting at &quot;ghosts&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I was bound to Freeport, the server itself was having problems with<br/>\nlag in the hunting grounds outside the west gate.  1000+ server side<br/>\nlag.  Even one morning with only 400 ppl on Quellious in total, and only<br/>\nmaybe 20 ppl in West Freeport, I was still running at 600+ on the server<br/>\nside (that&#39;s the number on the right side, correct?).  So, it was make<br/>\nthe run to Rivervale or scrap the char.  So, here I am in Rivervale.<br/>\n<br/>\nWynsong<br/>\nWoodelf Bard, Level 3<br/>\nFaaaarrrrr from home in Rivervale, Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 20<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 7 Jul 1999 18:09:37 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Codo the Mysterious&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:codo@...\">codo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Rivervale to Qeynos?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this may seem like a silly question, but don&#39;t you think you&#39;re a<br/>\n<br/>\nlittle green to be so far from home just yet?
