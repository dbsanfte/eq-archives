DDD and CoD gives you the<br/>\n&quot;wince&quot; message.  You mentioned you were in Highkeep fighting the pickclaws.<br/>\nProbably don&#39;t need to tell you this, but singing DDD or CoD in the basement<br/>\nwill sometimes, due to the z-axis bug, affect get the guards who are on the<br/>\nfloor above you.  Learned that the hard way last time I was there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I think about the z-axis bug, the more I realize that it really<br/>\nputs a hamper on our effectiveness.  I almost never have DDD or CoD<br/>\nmemorized unless I&#39;m in a wide open area in outdoor zone.  Don&#39;t assume just<br/>\nbecause you are outdoors the z-axis bug won&#39;t bite you.  One time I was in<br/>\nthe Beholder Maze fighting evil eyes and minos.  My group was camping along<br/>\nthe wall in the gorge where the Lord evil eyes appear.  I sang DDD in every<br/>\nfight.  We were having a great time when all of a sudden just about every<br/>\nmuddite and mino in the entire zone came rushing into the gorge. Everyone of<br/>\nthem starting attacking me so I can only assume that one of them got<br/>\naffected by DDD through the mountain walls and started up a train.  If<br/>\nVerant can&#39;t/won&#39;t fix the z-axis bug, I would likely welcome a nerf<br/>\nreducing the radius of DDD and CoD so we could use it more often.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; A Goblin Warrior winces!<br/>\n&gt; A Goblin Warrior is hit for 15 damage non-melee<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Faras &quot;harp-music playing in the background&quot; Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
