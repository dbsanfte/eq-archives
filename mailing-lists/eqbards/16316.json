If the spawn is more than 45<br/>\nminutes apart, letting my group share any night at every other spawn means<br/>\nwe&#39;ll generally get one shot at the named spawn.  The rest of the two weeks<br/>\nor so in between these meetings the people who get on and want to do<br/>\nsomething else must leave and travel elsewhere.  It isn&#39;t worthwhile to<br/>\ntravel for 45+ minutes to get to a spawn site to play for 2 hours to fight<br/>\nthe spawn once, then have to do the whole thing again a week or two later.<br/>\nAs we have worked things out before we only do named spawns when we can set<br/>\nup a time in advance and get a group member to get there early to get on the<br/>\nlist if there is one so we can all get to hunt the spawn&#39;s area for 2 hours<br/>\nor so and see the spawn 3-4 times.  Under this system we will only rarely be<br/>\nable to fight the spawn once, rarely twice.  This pretty much locks us out<br/>\nof any chance of ever getting rare drops.  We can only play with enough of<br/>\nus to do tough camps once every other week pretty much anyhow.  Giving us<br/>\nthe ability to get a chance at the spawn every nite while reducing our<br/>\nability to camp the spawn longer gains us exactly zero access, while<br/>\nreducing the access we did have.  None of my regular groupmates plays more<br/>\nthan 4 times a week and those are the ones who can solo easily.  Once a week<br/>\nis the most often we get more than three guildmembers together.  From our<br/>\nexperience the new rules will not increase our access as casual players, but<br/>\nexactly the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 17, 2000 2:37 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Worldly Issues & &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 16 Mar 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d be tempted to agree with that, but their are several places where it<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; ridiculous for a group to go in and sit and do nothing for hours while<br/>\n&gt; waiting for one spawn because there are only two and another group has<br/>\n&gt; demanded you let them have the other one.  The group who can play for<br/>\nhours<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a hard time understanding what you&#39;re saying here.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s worth it to sit there for hours hoping for two named<br/>\nspawns, but not worth it to sit there for one?  What about all<br/>\nthe spots where there is only a single named spawn?  Are these<br/>\nspots simply not worth your time no matter what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe MO I&#39;ve seen nearly everywhere is to camp one named mob<br/>\nsite, while pulling generic mobs from other locations.  The<br/>\nonly 2-named-mob sites that come to mind are the<br/>\nassassin/supplier, and the king room in permafrost.  Maybe the<br/>\nmaid/butler room in Mistmoore.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; still gets the benefit as they are going to be there for hours anyhow,<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; group gets their limited playing time suddenly made nearly pointless while<br/>\n&gt; had the group that&#39;s going to be on for 6 hours simply let you have their<br/>\n&gt; two hours they would miss only 1/3 rd of their available time, you are<br/>\n&gt; forced to lose half your time which may well make the room unviable for<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re still not looking at the big picture.  Yes you might<br/>\nlose half your time this time.  But instead of having to wait<br/>\n2 weeks before getting another crack at it, you can go back<br/>\ntomorrow, no waiting (well, aside from the waiting for the<br/>\nnamed mob to show).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis rule does not change the crowding, does not change the<br/>\nmob spawn rate, does not change the item drop rate.  It only<br/>\nchanges the composition and number of the people camping those<br/>\nmobs.  If it results in casual players having easier access to<br/>\noft-camped mobs, then it improves their chances of getting<br/>\nitems from that mob.  If the mob still remains camped to the<br/>\npoint where casual players are discouraged, then it is<br/>\n*already* camped to the point where casual players are<br/>\ndiscouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Result is you move on to find something you can actually enjoy your two<br/>\n&gt; hours at and the long termers get the whole room anyhow for the full time.<br/>\n&gt; Eventually the short timers will find everything shared and will quit in<br/>\n&gt; frustration as they never get a turn at getting a useful chance to do a<br/>\nroom<br/>\n&gt; instead getting many turns that are not very useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefine &quot;useful chance&quot; and &quot;not very useful.&quot;  If you normally<br/>\nonly had a shot at a named spawn once every 2 weeks, and under<br/>\nthe new rules if every named spawn has an average of 2 groups<br/>\n(highly unlikely as I don&#39;t think there are that many players<br/>\ndespite the overcrowding); then your shot at getting a night<br/>\nat the named spawn has gone from 1 in 14 days to an effective<br/>\n1 in 2 days.  If you normally had a shot at a named spawn<br/>\npoint once every 2 days, then it&#39;s not camped to the point<br/>\nwhere it&#39;ll be a problem under the old or the new rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand why so many people are so vehemently<br/>\nopposed to the concept of sharing.  When I first started the<br/>\ngame, that&#39;s how I played.  Share the derv camp, share the orc<br/>\ncamp.  I only went along with the camper-has-all-rights rule<br/>\nbecause that seemed to be the majority consensus.  And even<br/>\nthen, if I was group leader and holding a spot with multiple<br/>\nnamed mobs in a crowded zone when another group came looking,<br/>\nI gave them the extra.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think this is one of those prisoner&#39;s dilemma<br/>\nsituations, where the bad choice from an individual<br/>\ncost/benefit analysis results in the best outcome for everyone<br/>\noverall (and the good choice from an individual cost/benefit<br/>\nanalysis results in the worst outcome for everyone overall).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
