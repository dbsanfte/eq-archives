My entire party died.  When we returned to get our corpses,<br/>\nthere was no sign of the necro.  Whew.  Still, we decided that we had<br/>\nhad enough, and we started heading out.  On the way out, we ran across<br/>\nthe necro again!  This time, he was stuck in a gate.  Now, as far as I<br/>\nknow, the path we were taking was the only way out from the depths where<br/>\nwe had retrieved our corpses.  If the mob had been working properly, we<br/>\nsurely would have perished again.  As it was, we were able to get out<br/>\nof his range (and out of the dungeon) before any of us succumbed to his<br/>\nDoT spells, and being stuck, he could not give chase.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I admit it.  We cheated.  We exploited the fact that this guy was stuck<br/>\nin a gate to escpe with our skins intact.  Perhaps we should have stood<br/>\nthere and waited for him to kill us with DoT spells to avoid taking <br/>\nadvantage of the bug.  But as usual with issues like this, my question is,<br/>\n&quot;Where&#39;s the fun in that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPurna<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out this week&#39;s ONElist of the week.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nHow is ONElist changing YOUR life?
