I was able to work on the other machine while playing my cleric.<br/>\nAt 19, I have:<br/>\n1 - Smite<br/>\n2 - Expulse Undead<br/>\n3 - Root<br/>\n4 - Healing<br/>\n5 - Extinguish Fatigue<br/>\n6 - Spirit Armor<br/>\n7 - Daring<br/>\n8 - Divine Aura (Always and Forever)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have healing hotkeyed at #4 and DA hotkeyed at #6.  The rest are easy<br/>\nenough to cast using alt-#.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question I have...what are some techniques you guys use for organizing<br/>\nyour spell book?  Heh...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my bard, they&#39;re just in order by level.  This is easiest, since I can<br/>\nreally choose from almost any song, regardless of level.  Makes it easy to<br/>\nguess which page a song is on.  I even left the spot blank for Melliflous<br/>\nMotion (spelling..heh..).  I&#39;ve never bothered to buy that one.  Seems<br/>\nawfully dangerous...heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the cleric, and the rest of my casters, the first 8 scribe slots are the<br/>\n8 spells I have memmed.  Then I try to decide which 2 are the next most<br/>\nused, and put those in the 2 remaining scribe spots on pages 1 and 2.  Pages<br/>\n3 and 4 are spells I don&#39;t use often, but the possibility of use exists.<br/>\nPage 5 are my cures, poison, disease, etc.  Page 6 are the endures, poison,<br/>\ndisease, etc.  The low level spells, ones I don&#39;t expect to ever use again,<br/>\nare currently around page 20 - 21.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 22, 2001 10:52 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] OT Complete heal (was Numbers on Bards)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was playing my cleric this weekend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have my #4 button set up to throw my main heal, and #0 set up with the<br/>\n&gt; Spells hotkey.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think I have the following imprint on my left index finger:<br/>\n&gt; $<br/>\n&gt; 4<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and the following imprint on my right index finger:<br/>\n&gt; )<br/>\n&gt; 0<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hehe...  :)  Stand, heal, sit.

There not much to a cleric&#39;s life.  Buff, Med,<br/>\nHeal, Med...<br/>\n<br/>\nI became involved (IE got a part in) a play and my rehersal schedule<br/>\nconflicted with my regular EQ group.  Fortunatly (at the time) I lived with<br/>\nyour group&#39;s warrior, and he was able to run both pc&#39;s and play both<br/>\ncharacters without much of a hiccup (granted they picked easy places to camp<br/>\nlike Dalnir&#39;s while he was doing this).<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres what my cleric hot key bank looks like:<br/>\n1. Valor (replace with random spell like counteract poison if situation<br/>\ncalls for it)<br/>\n2. Sup Heal<br/>\n3. Greater Heal<br/>\n4. Root<br/>\n5. Stun<br/>\n6. Holy Might (another stun spell) (If they aren&#39;t any caster mobs I care<br/>\nabout, Wrath (dd spell) goes here)<br/>\n7. Buff spell (rotates between ac/symbol/resists)<br/>\n8. Divine Aura (30 sec invul spell, recast time is 15 min, so its always<br/>\nmemmed)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt never changes.  I have had all these spells (or their lower level<br/>\nversion) since level 4 I think.  It will never change (except name changes<br/>\nwhen I get an upgrade).<br/>\n<br/>\nMost fights, I never see the mobs (well now I will since I finally lost my<br/>\nspell book while medding).<br/>\n<br/>\nI;m not complaining, in many ways I like my cleric. Its easy, its relaxing,<br/>\nI watch Smackdown while I am playing (Flame away with &quot;Then you aren&#39;t<br/>\nplaying your cleric right&quot;  I&#39;ve heard it before...My group has a run of 5<br/>\nstraight weeks of 0 deaths.  This has been done 100% inside dungeons, 75%<br/>\nwith no enchancter, 100% with my insane former roomate pulling, who&#39;s quoted<br/>\nas saying &quot;I was bored so I decided to pull 3 casters&quot;, and we have gotten<br/>\nat least a (non hell) level every 5-6 hour session, with non twinked<br/>\ncharacters.  We are effective)  I&#39;m just saying, I gave up alot when I chose<br/>\ncleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
