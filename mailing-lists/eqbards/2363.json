Little did I realize East and West are reversed in the<br/>\nOcean of Tears.  I did hit an island, but it wasn&#39;t the one I<br/>\nexpected.  Turns out I swam all the way across from the BB<br/>\nzone back to the island of the Sisterhood of Erollisi.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Personally I consider /loc a debugging command and a roleplaying<br/>\n&gt; abomination.  I refuse to deal with it.

It&#39;s very easy to think you&#39;re going due West when<br/>\nyou&#39;re off by 10 degrees and completely miss where you&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to go.  I suppose I could start dropping copper coins<br/>\nas I go like Hansel and Gretel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem I&#39;ve had was figuring out orientation<br/>\nunderwater.  I&#39;ve actually gotten lost in the lake in Oasis,<br/>\nwhere it&#39;s murky enough that you often can&#39;t see if you&#39;re<br/>\nswimming into a wall (i.e. not moving).  Eventually I figured<br/>\nout that I could center my view and just rotate to get a<br/>\nproper heading (so as not to swim *towards* the spectres), and<br/>\nswim slightly up to get to the surface.  In real life, you can<br/>\nat least feel when you&#39;re up against something, so I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a problem using /loc if I ended up lost underwater again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other times I use /loc is when the group gets separated<br/>\nwhile running.  That would almost never happen in real life,<br/>\nand the problem is exaggerated by packet loss and chasing<br/>\nghosts.  The follow command helps, but is not perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
