NO... I would feel the CLASS was complete... I would feel the QUEST for the FA was NOT complete.

Why should your priorities be any more<br/>\n&gt; important than someone else&#39;s priorities?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paladins are supposed to be able to wield the mightiest holy swords in the<br/>\n&gt; game, including the Fiery Avenger.  Brad loved to show off the FA in the<br/>\n&gt; Beta, telling everyone how it was the &quot;most powerful sword in the game&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it was Paladin only.  Imagine if you were a Paladin.  You chose to be a<br/>\n&gt; Paladin because you wanted to quest for the FA.  Wouldn&#39;t you feel your<br/>\n&gt; class was incomplete if the FA didn&#39;t exist?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>NO... I would feel the CLASS was complete... I would feel the QUEST for the<br/>\nFA was NOT complete.  It would be one of the many promises that went<br/>\nundelivered by Verant.  The FA quest would be just like many of the other<br/>\nquests in the game right now - broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, maybe if Verant would have implemented the FA instead of one of 3-4<br/>\nother paladin only weapons, then they would have had time to actually<br/>\ncorrect the bard-only plane weapons.  Instead we are stuck with three<br/>\nidentical non-procing weapons.  Or maybe Verant would have figured out why<br/>\nNOBODY has been able to aquire a small brass trumpet or Kelin&#39;s practice<br/>\nlute?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mages can summon a weapon every level.  But Verant hasn&#39;t put the level 49<br/>\n&gt; summon in the game yet.  Only recently was the lvl 44 Summon Weapon spell<br/>\n&gt; put into the game.  Still no word on the 49th spell.  Mages are also<br/>\n&gt; incomplete, according to your own definition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Count the spells...  a class that has over 120+ spells is missing 2...<br/>\nthat&#39;s very different than a class with 50 missing three.  BIG DIFFERENCE!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the two classes you mentioned have had  what I would call significant<br/>\nenhancements.  Enhancements that noticabley changed the effectiveness of<br/>\ntheir class, and addressed MAJOR concerns.  I&#39;ll stand by the statement that<br/>\nalthough the recent enhancements make some songs more useful, Verant has NOT<br/>\naddressed the major concerns of bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; The  little things, like the enhancements that were implemented in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last patch, didn&#39;t get mentioned the patch message?  What was up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the whole - it&#39;s in this patch, the next patch, coming soon,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; responses...  Again, it&#39;s a little thing, but it&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; getting the same attention paid to us as the other classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mages had pet healing spells added. or so the patch said.  Some duplicate<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter spell appeared on the vendor instead.  &quot;Database entry error&quot; we<br/>\n&gt; were told.  Three patches and four weeks later, the spell is finally<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seems like mages were given an explanation, not one they wanted to hear, but<br/>\nsomething.  I don&#39;t recall anything communicated about the status of bard<br/>\nenhancements and implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Shaman had Alchemy bugged for 8 months before Verant could be convinced it<br/>\n&gt; was broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You think after that Verant would learn from that mistake, and change the<br/>\nway they do things.  Instead the lullaby post floats out there unresponded<br/>\nto for 3 weeks?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bards get about the same attention as every other class.  There is no<br/>\n&gt; hatred of Bards at Verant, just as there is no special Bard Hate coded in<br/>\n&gt; the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think we are treated the same as other classes.  What I see is<br/>\nhappening is bard issues being glanced over and pushed to the side.  I never<br/>\nsaid there was bard hatred at Verant, just that bards are a low priority to<br/>\nVerant.  Bottom-line -  everything can&#39;t be that &quot;A-1&quot; priority.  What I<br/>\nwant to know is why bards aren&#39;t moved up that priority list more often?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your problem is that you are only looking at it from your tiny little Bard<br/>\n&gt; portal.  There are hundreds of things broken or missing in EQ.  Verant<br/>\n&gt; tries to fix them, but they do a very poor job.  You seem to not care<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; anything but fixing your Bard.  Verant has to fix problems with every<br/>\n&gt; class.  They can&#39;t stop everything just to fix Bards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, let me state the obvious... like any EQ player,  I feel good WHENEVER<br/>\na game improvemt is implemented - whether it&#39;s an enhancement for another<br/>\nclass or a quest fixed or a bug squashed.  But yeah, your right... I have<br/>\none character that I play - a bard.  I wouldn&#39;t want to play any other class<br/>\nbut a bard.  So I see things from that perpective.  I am not asking them to<br/>\nstop fixing everything to &quot;... just to fix bards&quot;, I am simply asking them<br/>\nto fix bards.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As far as the enhancements that went in on the last patch.  The see<br/>\n </span></blockquote>invis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; to clouding makes the song much more useful, and increased range on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; selo&#39;s is great. But did they do anything earth-shattering... no.  Did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they fix lullaby, increase dodge, implement parry, implement any mid-lvl<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instruments - no.  They increased the range of 4 songs.  Now maybe some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of  you can clue me in, but I have never actually used levitation for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group, or actually used tarews as the way to keep the group breathing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; under water.  So unless I am missing something * a very likely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possibility :) *- those two &quot;enhancements&quot; aren&#39;t much of anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most bards complained that levitate and water breathing were useless in a<br/>\n&gt; group partly because of the range problem.  Many Bards asked that the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>range<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be increased.  I believe there was a bard petition to increase the range.<br/>\n&gt; So they increased the range, and your not happy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think this guy said it best...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Abashi is absolutely right... They do get less rants when they nerf!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, what does that mean? So they get less rants when they nerf - ok, good,<br/>\nso what.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems to me that Verant has very little resource maintaining EQ.  Most<br/>\n&gt; everyone is working on the expansion or new projects.  Only so much is<br/>\n&gt; going to get done on each patch.  This sucks for us, and we can either<br/>\n&gt; complain loudly or find another game to play.  But to insist that Verant<br/>\n&gt; stops everything until you get your three missing songs (which Verant<br/>\n&gt; promised would be in the expansion) is just selfish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am sure Verant and Sony are making A TON of money off this product, and<br/>\nconsidering that, should be able to make more resources available for<br/>\nproduct support.  Again, your right - we can either complain louder or quit.<br/>\nI enjoy the game the way it is, so I ain&#39;t quitting.  But I am a paying<br/>\ncustomer, so I will be complaining louder.  Hopefully it makes a difference.<br/>\nIt is not being selfish to get what you paid for.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Promote Health & Earn Extra Income!
