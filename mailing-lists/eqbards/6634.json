Mcmannus stands just within aggro range at times, so you<br/>\n&gt;have to watch him, and make sure he leaves.  Also, another wandering<br/>\n&gt;Barbarian walks around near the pen on an irregular basis.  After both Barbs<br/>\n&gt;were clear, I took Frostbite for a bit of a run, to get him away from the<br/>\n&gt;camp, and proceeded to solo him.  Easy fight at 17th level, using<br/>\n&gt;dirk/barbed whip/songs.  But, no fish.  Just a ruined wolf pelt.  so my<br/>\n&gt;guildmate shows up, we wait a bit, new spawn, let the barbs run off, and he<br/>\n&gt;nukes the wolf.  Same thing, ruined wolf pelt.  So, there is something more<br/>\n&gt;to getting Frostbite to have a fish on his corpse, or another way to get it<br/>\n&gt;from him, without killing him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is possible to get the fish from Frostbite, you don&#39;t need to do<br/>\nanything else.  I tried it once as a bard but got nothing except a<br/>\nnice bit of xp :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a wizard I killed Frostbite a few times and eventually got the damn<br/>\nfish.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, she is now unable to go anywhere near Halas due to the<br/>\nfaction hits you take.  Just as well, she hates the cold anyway!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you take your choice what way to get the fish.  Either no-go in<br/>\nQeynos, or no-go in Halas.  I might suggest doing it from Qeynos since<br/>\nthere is probably a way to raise your faction with them again.  As far<br/>\nas I can tell, there is no way to raise your faction in Halas, so no<br/>\npartying with the barbarians as a wizard for me!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSee yas<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nSaldara<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (23), Mith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nMelaniel<br/>\nWood Elf Bard (12), Mith Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
