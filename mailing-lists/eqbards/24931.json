So he must qualify as an<br/>\nold bard, hehe. Im just a casual player so Im still only 48th level, but Ive<br/>\nbeen on this list for a loonnnnggg time. I remember when the guy from verant<br/>\nand the tester roamed around. Those where the days with lots of good info<br/>\nand communications bards around norrath, forgotten their names though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker, bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 31. maj 2001 06:40<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Guess I&#39;m not the only one who was humor-challenged today &lt;g&gt;...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nygaardr, FC3 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nygaardr@...\">nygaardr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 11:18 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, and enchanters need an unresistable indefinite duration <br/>\n&gt; mez too that<br/>\n&gt; costs 50% of thier mana, sound fair?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mu<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 3:05 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hehe - man I need to learn not to respond to the list before <br/>\n&gt; my first cup of<br/>\n&gt; coffee in the morning...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I like the Spit Valve of Doom - and there will be different values - a<br/>\n&gt; trumpet gives smallest affect while a tuba the biggest!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW - not to get into another debate on mino horns - but the <br/>\n&gt; trombone is a<br/>\n&gt; Brass Inst not a Wind Inst.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also - I think there should be Wind Instrument &quot;Sax of <br/>\n&gt; Gorelick&quot; which has a<br/>\n&gt; negative affect on all wind songs EXCEPT mez songs - in which <br/>\n&gt; case the mez<br/>\n&gt; is never resisted and has an indefinite duration...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Windleaf Mistsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:windleaf@...\">windleaf@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 1:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s ok, to make it up to Slyde, Verant has included in this patch a<br/>\n&gt; trombone.

No bard songs would refresh so you got one pulse <br/>\n&gt; had to stop the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;song and then had to restart it.  Aria at the time had about <br/>\n&gt; 4 seconds of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;duration beyond the pulse just enough to get you out of <br/>\n&gt; safty and into a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;long drop :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The next batch which fixed that problem then made it that <br/>\n&gt; weapons would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not proc while bard song was active.

The unlucky bards who found this out <br/>\n&gt; the hard way -<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used the song THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK often fell <br/>\n&gt; to their death.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It was clear that Verant made a change to the spell <br/>\n&gt; system without doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ANY testing on the bard class.        Literally 19 <br/>\n&gt; seconds of testing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; caught this bug.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t add to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; affect of Selo&#39;s. Again - many bards died expecting their <br/>\n&gt; songs to work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they way they were designed (i.e. running away from mobs <br/>\n&gt; etc). In this<br/>\n&gt; case<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - 3 seconds of testing would have caught it. They <br/>\n&gt; admitted it was a<br/>\n&gt; bug -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but refused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They <br/>\n&gt; said it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; critical enough (we were upset about this wondering the <br/>\n&gt; reaction from<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; player base is SOW was broken...)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a <br/>\n&gt; half-dozen or<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending <br/>\n&gt; to affect Bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that were introduced into the live servers because the <br/>\n&gt; most trivial<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of testing the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Heck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by <br/>\n&gt; players and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Henrik Holm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEH@...\">HEH@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 30, 2001 10:01 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a <br/>\n&gt; nessesary nerf because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bards would outrun guides and make fun of them.
