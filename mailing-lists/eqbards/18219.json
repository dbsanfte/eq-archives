You&#39;re in luck.  But<br/>\n&gt; first, we mostly did Mountain Giants last night.  We saw a number of new<br/>\nitems including a ring AC10 +10<br/>\n&gt; Strength, a tunic called tree weave AC25 +10 strength wearable by just<br/>\nabout EVERY class and race except<br/>\n&gt; pure nukers (mages/necros/wiz).  My wife&#39;s warrior got the ring which goes<br/>\ngreat with her Efreeti ring on<br/>\n&gt; her other hand.  Another warrior got the tunic.  The tunic looks like<br/>\nleather so it is hilareous to see<br/>\n&gt; this warrior running around in all crafted and a leather BP.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The necro stuff is a Flayed Skin Tunic, AC 16 -2 charisma, +5 to all<br/>\nprotect,  +20 hp nec and shadow only<br/>\n&gt; and the bracer was AC6 -2 char, +5 int, +5 all prot shadow and necro only<br/>\nI believe.  The key though is<br/>\n&gt; they could not be worn by gnomes or inkies.  I believe they are both<br/>\nhuman/euradite only.  Both items<br/>\n&gt; were looted almost back to back in Karnor.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
