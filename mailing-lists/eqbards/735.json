And since dungeons confer a mild 5% experience<br/>\nbonus per kill, a druid that kills the same level mobs outdoors will advance<br/>\nslower than one that kills them indoors, by a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n      A few weeks back, and throughout all of beta, the dungeon bonus was 25<br/>\npercent, but this was lowered. I imagine that&#39;s where the druid 75 percent<br/>\nrumor got started. And keep in mind that a good many dungeons, or adventure<br/>\nzones as Verant classifies them, are flagged as outdoor anyway, such as<br/>\nCrushbone, Blackburrow, Mistmoore, Unrest, Cazic-Thule, Highpass (both<br/>\nzones), and Kedge Keep.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Next thing is the &#39;virtual&#39; experience point system. Each class and<br/>\nrace combo has a set number of experience points it needs to advance to the<br/>\nnext level. Human warriors do have the lowest numerical requirement, while a<br/>\nTroll shadowknight has the highest. Compared to a human warrior, a troll sk<br/>\nrequires roughly 30 percent more experience each level.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Now, using round numbers, a 10th level human warrior and a 10th troll<br/>\nSK group.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Since the troll SK needed 30% more experience to get to tenth, the<br/>\ngame treats him as if he was 30% higher in level, in figuring the experience<br/>\nsplit.<br/>\n<br/>\n      In virtual levels, the SK is 13th level, and as such, he gets a bigger<br/>\nshare per kill. This is offset of course, by the fact that the warrior needs<br/>\nless experience to level, so the warrior still advances a bit faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Now, if the troll SK was 13th in actual levels, and the warrior still<br/>\n10th, the warrior would get far far less experience per kill, since there&#39;s<br/>\nnow nearly a 7 level spread in virtual experience. This is intentional, and<br/>\na good thing. Why? Because a 10th level warrior teamed with a 13th level SK<br/>\nhas a far easier time making the kills, there&#39;s less risk for the warrior,<br/>\nso there&#39;s less reward.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Do these virtual levels actually equate to the difference in<br/>\ncapability of each class? Not at first, but as the hybrid and casting<br/>\nclasses gain levels and spells, they become more and more potent, and at<br/>\naround 30th level, they are indeed that much more effective than their pure<br/>\nmelee counterparts, in many situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n      This doesn&#39;t mean a 30th warrior is a wimp compared to a 30th<br/>\nshadowknight, or wizard. But a warrior required so much less experience to<br/>\nobtain that level. It&#39;s a matter of getting what you paid for.<br/>\n<br/>\n      The reason they went to this system was because in beta, they didn&#39;t<br/>\nconsider virtual levels. It was all based on your numerical levels. It<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take long for hybrid classes to fall so far behind their non-hybrid<br/>\ngroupmates that catching up was next to impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\n      It was further aggravated by the fact that each level one of their<br/>\nfriends gained on them meant that much LESS experience for them, making the<br/>\ngap grow even wider. Before long, the hybrids either had to clock enourmous<br/>\namounts of non-grouped time to keep up, or drop out of the group completly.<br/>\nThis was a bad thing. It happened on a smaller scale with monks, casters,<br/>\nand healers, but took a lot more levels to become a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n      In an attempt to preserve group integrity, they went to the virtual<br/>\nlevel system, which while still having problems, is a lot better than the<br/>\nold way.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Now, some folks reading this are going to think that hybrids are<br/>\nexperience leeches. That may be true, but they also bring a lot of power to<br/>\nthe group, on a purely numerical basis, and given the same amount of group<br/>\ntime, should level not much faster or slower than the rest of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Then there&#39;s the friendship factor. If you play a warrior and your<br/>\nfriends play a ranger and paladin, are you going to stop grouping with them<br/>\nbecause they get more experience per kill? You shouldn&#39;t, since in the long<br/>\nrun, it&#39;s a wash, level wise.<br/>\n<br/>\n      And this game would be pretty damned dull if there were only pure<br/>\nmelee and pure casting classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Here&#39;s a listing of classes in experience order, lowest to highest<br/>\n<br/>\n      1. Warrior<br/>\n<br/>\n      2. Rogue (very small gap between rogue and warrior, and some<br/>\nclass/race combos are lower than warrior class combos, half elf rogue takes<br/>\nless exp to level than a barbarian warrior, for example)<br/>\n<br/>\n      3. Monk (modest gap between monk and rogue)<br/>\n<br/>\n      Wizard/Mage/Enchanter/Necromancer (very small gap between them and a<br/>\nmonk)<br/>\n<br/>\n      Cleric/Shaman/Druid (small gap over the magi)<br/>\n<br/>\n      Ranger/Bard/Paladin/Shadowknight (large gap over the healers)<br/>\n<br/>\n      Here&#39;s the race list, again in lowest to highest:<br/>\n<br/>\n      1. Human/Erudite (no special abilities)<br/>\n<br/>\n      2. Half elf (infravision)<br/>\n<br/>\n      2. High Elf (infravision)<br/>\n<br/>\n      3. Gnome (infravision, tinkering)<br/>\n<br/>\n      4 Dwarf (infravision, sense heading)<br/>\n<br/>\n      4 Wood elf (hide, forage, infravision)<br/>\n<br/>\n      4. Dark elf (hide, sneak, ultravision)<br/>\n<br/>\n      4. Barbarian (slam, high combat stats)<br/>\n<br/>\n      5. Halfling (hide, sneak, infravision, higher total stat points)<br/>\n<br/>\n      6. Ogre (infravision, slam, higher stat point total)<br/>\n<br/>\n      7. Troll (infravision, regeneration, slam)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Where did I get this information? I asked, and was informed by the<br/>\ndevelopment team, throughout all of beta. It&#39;s pretty acurate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Kelton,<br/>\n      aka Kendrick<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Scott Pickle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottp@...\">scottp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 3:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] starting stats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: Scott Pickle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scottp@...\">scottp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;re kidding, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Do other races have even worse hits?
