I don&#39;t play enough hours to gain even two <br/>\n&gt; levels in 3<br/>\n&gt; weeks though.<br/>\n&gt; I like Sol A a lot, but I can&#39;t be effective in Sol A.  I <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t really tank<br/>\n&gt; and if a group is caster heavy they really have no other use <br/>\n&gt; for me.  This<br/>\n&gt; has done nothing but continue to foster my opinion that melee <br/>\n&gt; classes are<br/>\n&gt; not useful until you get to the level where they artificially <br/>\n&gt; created a use<br/>\n&gt; for them by giving critters insane resists.  The cleric can <br/>\n&gt; tank as well for<br/>\n&gt; this group as I can.  His heals of himself when he tanks are <br/>\n&gt; sufficient<br/>\n&gt; taunt to keep the mobs on him and the other casters can <br/>\n&gt; easily make it a<br/>\n&gt; one-gob fight 90% of the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
