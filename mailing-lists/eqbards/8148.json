Sylly just described my entire evening last night! :) Putting<br/>\ntheory into practice, I used techniques learned from this mailing list and<br/>\nthe boards and came up with gold. (You can, too, if you send $74.95 and a<br/>\nself-addressed, stamped envelope, to the League of Antonican Bards)<br/>\n<br/>\nFiring up my shiny new Purifying Rhythms, I meleed Darkweed Snakes in E<br/>\nCommons (average 5gp loot per kill - not bad for a 13 bard). Am I sick to<br/>\ntake satisfaction in killing them with their own fangs? Though I resisted<br/>\nthe venom often, I eventually resigned myself to learning a new skill for<br/>\nthe evening: Poison Tolerance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso my first All Music Attack night. I killed wisps with CoD and Bellow,<br/>\ntwisting in Hymn (no magic weapon yet). I found that I was actually gaining<br/>\nhealth during the fight, even while still poisoned. People would stop to<br/>\nwatch, curious why this goofy half-elf was taking those hits and not even<br/>\nswinging back.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, my first true Kite night. It was late and I was a sliver from<br/>\nleveling so took some reckless chances. After another Darkweed, and another<br/>\npoison, I saw a high-blue Young Kodiak and rushed in. The bear (I think it<br/>\nwas a monk in a former life) got in so many critical-size hits that I was<br/>\nforced to flee at 1.5 bubbles, pesky poison still in my veins. I blended<br/>\nSelo&#39;s and Hymn while I ran from Mr. Bear in disgrace. The poison finally<br/>\nran its course. Suddenly it came to me. Why should I give up this juicy<br/>\nkill? He was half HP and I had a longer range kick than the Mauling Monk. I<br/>\nswitched to an outer view and confirmed that he indeed wanted one last<br/>\nmorsel (me) before hibernating. Twisting Selo&#39;s and two Bellows, I stayed<br/>\nahead of him and whittled away for 2 minutes. He finally turned to limp away<br/>\nand I just stood there, bellowing and bellowing. I walked up to him and,<br/>\nwith one fateful timely punch, slew the beast that had threatened my<br/>\ndeath-free night. I was rewarded with a cathartic DING! Welcome to level 14.<br/>\nYou cannot believe how satisfying that was!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to the experts on this list. Success is easy when you stand on the<br/>\nshoulders of those who have gone before.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nMeandering Kiting Maestro of the 14th Song (if he bothers to travel to<br/>\nErudin for it)<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 4:00 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] soloing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings! And Welcome!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The best thing to do is get a &quot;regular group&quot; - find a group that will<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; the same days, hours and times - then you can learn together instead of<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; having to teach the group every time.  Other than that - there are many<br/>\n&gt; morons out there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How are you trying to solo? Toe to toe melee?  If yes, you need to change<br/>\n&gt; your tactics.  Bards have low HP compared to true tanks and mobs are<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; stronger while you stay about the same (ok you get more hp each level but<br/>\n&gt; the mobs get more).  Use tatics where you damage them but prevent them<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; damageing you.  Hit and run - stay just far enough away that you can<br/>\ndamage<br/>\n&gt; them but they cant get you.  Use magic songs for damage - Chords, Denon&#39;s<br/>\n&<br/>\n&gt; Bellow.  And do not be in a hurry - it takes longer and you need to learn<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; out side.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You would be better off to have a same-level partner and the 2 of you kill<br/>\n&gt; more mobs with less downtime.  From 15 thru 25 - most other classes get<br/>\n&gt; arrogant and ignore the need and value of partys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get a better weapon - soon you will have dual wield.  The whip is ok but<br/>\n&gt; there is better - Dragoon Dirk or Combine Longsword.  I used a giant snake<br/>\n&gt; fang and mino axe along with my combine long sword for a long time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You lose hp when monster hits you - don&#39;t let him get close enough to hit<br/>\n&gt; you - as much. Hit him, run, hit him , run.  Use songs to hit him!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 30th song<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Janko S.

I was asked this for 4 times today and I really hate<br/>\n&gt; it. I<br/>\n&gt; even got kicked from a group when I refused to play it because the<br/>\n&gt; mana is<br/>\n&gt; not regenerating faster. Can anyone recommend me what to do?<br/>\n&gt; I have one more problem. I&#39;m lvl 15 at the moment and I can hardly<br/>\n&gt; ever solo<br/>\n&gt; a blue creature. I&#39;m wearing full banded armor, and I have my 1H<br/>\n&gt; slash<br/>\n&gt; allways maxed. I&#39;m using tentacle whip as a weapon, no it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; twinked I<br/>\n&gt; got it as in a bet when someone didn&#39;t beleive me that selo&#39;s is<br/>\n&gt; faster than<br/>\n&gt; sow. And I just bought the armor. Can anyone please tell me why<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t I solo<br/>\n&gt; a blue creature without loosing 90-95% of my health.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Asandir<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does Windows keep &quot;&quot;bugging&quot;&quot; you?
