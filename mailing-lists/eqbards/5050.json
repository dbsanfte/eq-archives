If anyone else want to test this out or has similar experience with <br/>\nthis, let us know.<br/>\n     <br/>\nIt was a typical strategy for me when visiting unrest to go invis right <br/>\noutside the zone, zone in, restart the song, and start shouting for a group <br/>\nand wandering around the courtyard and walls.  This way I would be left <br/>\nalone from suprise attacks.  Then when a group might answer me with <br/>\nsomething like &quot;meet us in the barkeep room&quot; I would just run in and join <br/>\nthem, then stop the song.  Many many times I strolled right past trains from <br/>\nthe basement and stood next to hags, etc, without being noticed.  Not <br/>\nanymore :-(  Looks like this Bard needs to learn to be a bit more careful <br/>\nfrom now on.<br/>\n     <br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n     <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
