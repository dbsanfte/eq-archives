I was<br/>\n&gt;lucky enuf to acquire a pair of elf-hide gloves (thank you Lamont :)<br/>\n&gt;already, and with no other Bards in my normal party, I think these would be<br/>\n&gt;great items to bring out and sell from our upcoming return to Guk.  I am<br/>\n&gt;currently &quot;trying&quot; to upgrade to Plate mail of some kind and am being<br/>\n&gt;extremelly unsuccessful finding any medium bronze for sale, anywhere.<br/>\n&gt;Aparently the mobs in Permafrost that carry it are well beyond my current<br/>\n&gt;level (21).  So, that leaves me with the option of buying steel plate.<br/>\n&gt;OUCH!  Needless to say, unless Bronze starts showing up, I&#39;m gonna be<br/>\n&gt;needing some heavy cash.  : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I had the idea of going to Cazic and trying to buy thrown away plate from<br/>\n&gt;players who have just found Rubicite....  : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol - Xegony<br/>\n&gt;(wishing he went wood elf)  : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;If anyone can help, you can either email me direct or post here with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;appropriate spoiler warning. Thanks!!!!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I am looking for the Elfhide Gloves in Upper Guk. These are the +5 Agi and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;+5 dex gloves useble ONLY by Bards and Rogues. I was TOLD that they are on<br/>\n&gt;&gt;someone named &quot;The Warden&quot;, who is supposedly the Warden of the jail cells<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in Upper Gukk. My group camped there for QUITE a long time this evening<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;never saw him once. Does anyone know exaclty where he spawns? Is there<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;sort of trigger? We kept seeing Knights and Warriors, but never a Warden.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;We are ALSO looking for the trollhide belt. Again, I was told this SAME<br/>\n&gt;&gt;invidual bears it. Is this true? If not, who has it, and where? And of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;course, is this ALSO a Bard/Rogue only item?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;THANK YOU for any help you can provide!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Tim - Tallonn - Bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
