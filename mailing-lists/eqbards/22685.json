Since we are aware that some<br/>\nmay have not bothered training sense or disarm traps due to them formerly<br/>\nbeing unimplemented, bards and rogues will have the ability to gain skill<br/>\nwithout training once they have reached the appropriate level and have<br/>\ncrossed a zone boundary.<br/>\n <br/>\nThese skills now have use within Velious.  There are traps, and they range<br/>\nfrom annoying to deadly throughout Velious.  They are invisible and can only<br/>\nbe detected and disarmed by rogues and bard.  <br/>\n <br/>\nUse &quot;Sense Traps&quot; to see if there are any traps in the vicinity.  If so, you<br/>\ncan then use &quot;Disarm traps&quot; to try and disarm the trap.  Once disarmed, the<br/>\ntrap will remain inactive for a short period of time (about a minute) while<br/>\nyour group passes through the area.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be<br/>\ndirected towards the closest one.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
