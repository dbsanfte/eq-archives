I myself was stuck at 15 and 16<br/>\nfor quite a while.  I don&#39;t know it seems like the a big speedbump in your<br/>\nleveling progress.  Once you make 17 things start rolling again.  That&#39;s<br/>\nwhere I am at now.  The best suggestion is to make sure yur twisting in<br/>\nUnrest and group as much as you can.  Even a single partner makes the two<br/>\nof you very effective.  I got to level 16 partnering with my lvl 15 druid<br/>\nfriend.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin - Bard of Kelethin - Honour Guard - Karana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
