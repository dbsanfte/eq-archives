You<br/>\ntarget that merchant and sing.

As I recall I paid 5 platinum for the shirt.  A cleric friend of<br/>\nmine bought me the amulet as a gift for 1 platinum.  He said I&#39;ve saved far<br/>\nmore than that for him, using his money to buy him his spell scrolls at his<br/>\nown guild.  It seems the merchants there give me better prices even than<br/>\none of thier own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past evening I made several platinum in commissions, spending a<br/>\nfriend&#39;s money for him to buy fletching supples.  I can save him over a<br/>\nplatinum on an ash bow staff and keep a platinum for myself, so we&#39;re both<br/>\nway ahead, since I get it for more than two platinum less than he does, on<br/>\nan item that costs me just a bit over 15 platinum.  Quite a savings, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
