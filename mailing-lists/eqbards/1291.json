People<br/>\n&gt; tend to attack certain guards and even a spawning tavern NPC, but I took<br/>\n&gt; absolutely no part in these nearby battles, just making brew and chatting<br/>\n&gt; with drunks (I offered free beer in an auction, heheh).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Roop<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
