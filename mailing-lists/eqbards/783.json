It isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; the song that continues when you stop singing.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the EFFECT that the<br/>\n&gt; song has on you.  When I sing a sad song, the<br/>\n&gt; listener doesn&#39;t stop feeling<br/>\n&gt; sad immediately after I stop singing.  It&#39;s this<br/>\n&gt; *effect* that carries over<br/>\n&gt; into the next song.  If the next song is a<br/>\n&gt; toe-tapper, the audience may<br/>\n&gt; still feel a little sad for a while even as they<br/>\n&gt; start tapping.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each<br/>\n&gt; day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 1,000!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
