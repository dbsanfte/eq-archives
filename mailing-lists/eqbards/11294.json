It is AC 4 +10 cha Lore and No Drop.  Here are the <br/>\ndetails<br/>\nSpoiler Space<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n1) Faerie Dust. You need to talk to Princess Joleena of the fairies(she&#39;s in <br/>\nLesser Faydark in the center of the Fairy Camp near a Gnome Clockwork) about <br/>\nthis. Asking her about it reveals that one of her wings was stolen by a bald <br/>\nperson who smelled of rust and refuse. She asks you to bring her wing back <br/>\nand she&#39;ll give you the Fairy Dust. In Ak&#39;Anon across from the Necro Guild <br/>\nthere is a Gnome named Sanfyrd Featherhead. If you ask him where Princess <br/>\nJoleena&#39;s wing is, he will tell you that you can&#39;t have it because he read <br/>\nthat it will make his hair grow back. He also mentions that he has no <br/>\n[friends]. Befriend him by saying, &quot;I&#39;m your friend&quot; at which point he <br/>\nexclaims that you are &quot;just saying that to get my feather, if you are really <br/>\nmy friend you would help me get some hair tonic.&quot; Converse with him further <br/>\nand he will give you a 10 slot crate to fill with hair tonics. Then go to <br/>\nWest Freeport and visit a Gnome Merchant in a tent outside the West Gate by <br/>\nthe name of Ping Fuzzlecutter. Ping sells the tonics you need, so just buy <br/>\nten and combine them(they are not called hair tonics, there is some other <br/>\nwierd name for the tonics). Take the new box(no longer a container) back to <br/>\nSanfyrd Featherhead and he will ask one more favor beforegiving you the <br/>\nwing. He will give you his tattered toupee&#39; and ask that you get it fixed by <br/>\nthe same man who sold him the tonic. So once again go to West Freeport to <br/>\ntalk to Ping Fuzzlecutter again. You need to ask Ping, &quot;can you repair a <br/>\ntoupee?&quot;(you must say &quot;repair&quot; rather than fix or he won&#39;t respond). Ping <br/>\nwill go into the history of his wig, &quot;The Mane Attraction&quot; and tell you that <br/>\nhe can still fix it because it is under warranty. But in order to fix it you <br/>\nneed to fetch him two clumps of hair from a Hulking Gorilla(lvl 25 or so <br/>\ngorillas in the Cazic-Thule throne room) and a lock of the golden tresses <br/>\nfrom a &quot;certain mermaid&quot;. This certain mermaid is a &quot;golden haired mermaid&quot; <br/>\n(thats the exact name of the npc) that resides in Kedge Keep. You will <br/>\nabsolutely need at least two well balanced 40+ groups to safely do this in <br/>\nKedge. Once you retrieve the mermaid hair, go back to West Freeport and give <br/>\nPing the 2 clumps of Gorilla Hair, the Golden Locke, and the Wig and you <br/>\nwill get the Mane Attraction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
