Caster pays 1pp for SOW and nearly<br/>\n&gt; keeps up with bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since the Caster can pay someone else to help him, then I will pay someone<br/>\nto help me.  &quot;/auction Need a group gate to Qeynos&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Bard arrives in Qeynos let&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; be generous and say 10 minutes before wizard does.<br/>\n&gt; Bard heads back and gleefully waves at wizard still<br/>\n&gt; on his way to Qeynos. Wizard gets to Qeynos. Wizard<br/>\n&gt; gates back to Freeport and laughs it up for 45 minutes<br/>\n&gt; while the bard is still running.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the race was serious, the bard could just suicide against a guard and be<br/>\ninstantly teleported right back to Freeport, beating the wizard.  Put all<br/>\nyour stuff in the bank first to make it easier.  And if you are worried<br/>\nabout the experience loss, kill yourself instead.  No exp loss there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or better yet, high level bard & high level wizard in<br/>\n&gt; the same race. Bard takes off a runnin&#39;.. Wizard does<br/>\n&gt; his fancy teleport to the Karana&#39;s. Runs rest of way<br/>\n&gt; to Qeynos. Gates back to Freeport. Bard arrives in West<br/>\n&gt; Commons on his way to Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yeah, Selo&#39;s makes up for all of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But a wizard will never be able to heal himself.  If you think Selo is the<br/>\nonly thing bards have going for them.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
