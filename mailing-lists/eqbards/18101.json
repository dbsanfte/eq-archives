February 1, 3178--<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Today, the League of Antonican Bards, responsible for maintaining<br/>\n&gt; communication across Norrath announced that they have established a mail<br/>\n&gt; route to the newly discovered continent of Kunark, located across the ocean,<br/>\n&gt; south and east of Antonica. The new route will carry mail from Port Faydwer<br/>\n&gt; to the Elven outpost of Firiona Vie, which will serve as main port-of-entry<br/>\n&gt; and battle staging grounds for adventurers arriving in the new lands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The outpost of Firiona Vie was established soon after word reached King<br/>\n&gt; Tearis Thex, King of Felwithe and leader of the Koada`Dal, that his daughter<br/>\n&gt; of the same name had been kidnapped by lizard creatures now known to be<br/>\n&gt; named the Iksar. The King commissioned Galeth Veredeth, once-Lord and High<br/>\n&gt; Paladin of Tunare, to establish the outpost on Kunark and return his<br/>\n&gt; daughter to him, lest Veredeth&#39;s life be forfeited for failure. &quot;I cannot<br/>\n&gt; allow those vile creatures to keep my daughter and only heir to the<br/>\n&gt; Koada`Dal throne from fulfilling her destiny,&quot; says King Tearis Thex.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Galeth Veredeth had best not fail me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A high level source in Neriak confirmed today that the Dark races will not<br/>\n&gt; be outdone in the endeavor to acquire new territory and power. The source<br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;We believe that this nonsense about a kidnapped princess is just<br/>\n&gt; that. If the lesser `Dals and their human and stunted playthings think that<br/>\n&gt; they can wander the new lands unchecked, they are quite mistaken.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many adventures are already beginning the trip to Kunark, a journey that is<br/>\n&gt; not without its perils. A human and halfling party was apparently<br/>\n&gt; slaughtered upon their arrival after mistakenly boarding a Kunark-destined<br/>\n&gt; ship in the Oasis of Marr. They evidently were not aware that the ship would<br/>\n&gt; arrive at a new port, firmly controlled by Neriak and their brutish muscle<br/>\n&gt; from Oggok and Grobb.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Druidic scouts have reported that there are some strange phenomena present<br/>\n&gt; throughout the new lands. &quot;The land appears to have been ravaged by some<br/>\n&gt; viscous magical storms at one time,&quot; said one follower of Karana. &quot;Some<br/>\n&gt; magics that we have come to count on just do not work.&quot; This phenomenon was<br/>\n&gt; apparently noticed to an extreme in the vicinity of a mountain peak rumored<br/>\n&gt; to be inhabited by followers of Veeshan. &quot;Only through divine intervention<br/>\n&gt; did I escape that place with my life.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The League of Antonican Bards&#39; representative in Kunark met with Galeth<br/>\n&gt; Veredeth, Governor of the Outpost Firiona Via. &quot;It is my sincerest hope that<br/>\n&gt; many adventures loyal to the King will assist us on our Quest to return the<br/>\n&gt; Princess to her home,&quot; says Veredeth. &quot;Though the dangers in these new lands<br/>\n&gt; are formidable, I have no doubt that many will come, if for nothing else<br/>\n&gt; than to reap the spoils.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ###<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *Kunark Goes Live*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In case the announcement from the League of Antonican Bards wasn&#39;t to your<br/>\n&gt; liking, we are very pleased to announce that the EverQuest: The Ruins of<br/>\n&gt; Kunark expansion has been implemented on the live servers. Adventurers who<br/>\n&gt; have installed the expansion and registered their account key may now visit<br/>\n&gt; the new lands, exceed level 50, create Iksar characters, and access<br/>\n&gt; Kunark-related content in general.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is a short list of some of the new features available to those who have<br/>\n&gt; upgraded:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Players may now reach level 60!<br/>\n&gt; - Over two dozen new zones to explore!<br/>\n&gt; - Tons of new quests, items, and spells to complete, acquire, and learn!<br/>\n&gt; - All-new creatures and weapons, with new art too!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are two minor issue that is known and that we are still in the process<br/>\n&gt; of rectifying: Action-based sounds for the Iksar and some other Kunark<br/>\n&gt; creatures are still being worked on. In other words, you might hear a giant<br/>\n&gt; mosquito &quot;walk&quot; by you, and your Iksar might sound curiously like a human<br/>\n&gt; when he is hit with a sword. In addition, there is some additional work<br/>\n&gt; required with a couple of the starting Iksar quests. This may cause you to<br/>\n&gt; reach a point where you cannot proceed further in a quest. This will not<br/>\n&gt; however cause you to turn in items and be denied your reward, so feel free<br/>\n&gt; to explore these new quests. We will be finishing them over the next week.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We would like to offer special thanks everyone who has been patient over the<br/>\n&gt; past couple of weeks while we&#39;ve readied EverQuest for this awesome event.<br/>\n&gt; It has been quite a challenge for our team to get everything ready for<br/>\n&gt; launch, and your support has been instrumental in this process. We&#39;d also<br/>\n&gt; like to thank the beta test team, who in the face of all of the new content<br/>\n&gt; managed to keep their thoughts between themselves and the Dev Team, while<br/>\n&gt; working to make the game better for everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you ordered Kunark on or before 4/19/2000 and do not receive your Kunark<br/>\n&gt; CD by today, we will be posting instructions later today on how to claim the<br/>\n&gt; shipping refund as well as the free month of EverQuest promised last week.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The EverQuest Team<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; April 24th, 6:01am<br/>\n&gt; -------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *K-Patch Required*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All Kunark-enabled players should run the Kunark Patch on the Patch Program<br/>\n&gt; control panel prior to attempting to enter Kunark.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *Manual Supplement*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The files named everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt in your<br/>\n&gt; EverQuest directory are now obsolete.
