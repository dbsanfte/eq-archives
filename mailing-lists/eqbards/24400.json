I was kind of pissed - everytime I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen in KC - Hand/Warlord was cnsidered a linked camp.  Was camping the Hand<br/>\nroom and another group moved in on the Warlord Room.  The first drop after<br/>\nthey took it a Harmonic Dagger dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo zones for Armor drops - (assuming you have Velious) - Skyshrine (but you<br/>\nhave to take Dragon hits).  Better AC and better bonuses than Lambent.  And<br/>\nmost are no-drop - so they aren&#39;t farmed for trading.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is to try to get Frosted Velium from Icewell Keep.  You need<br/>\nlike a 60 puller if you fight them - (they resist almost everything under<br/>\nthe sun) - and most people don&#39;t want to go anti-Dorf - but if you happen to<br/>\nsee a gooup fighting there - you may want to stick around and ask them for<br/>\nthe drops (I believe they are no drop as well)<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n54 Bard Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Grady [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john_grady@...\">john_grady@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 06, 2001 1:58 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Newbie on list - finally found a Bard list with some<br/>\nlfe to it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInstruments: MM Drums (finishing tambourine now), Gypsy Lute, Minotaur<br/>\nHorn<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I&#39;m done trying for the Harmony dagger in KC.
