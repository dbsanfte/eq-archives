Calling it &quot;Weaving&quot; for short seems too weak, and too close to<br/>\nsounding like some sissy skill like &quot;Tailoring&quot; - i.e., &quot;oooooh, I am good<br/>\nat weaving tonight.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMedley, (if you will pardon my bluntness) is completely out of the question<br/>\nand should not be brought up again.  I don&#39;t feel a justification for my<br/>\nopinion on this is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nJuggling seems the best candidate I have contemplated thus far partly for<br/>\nthe same reasons given by Jyzan below.  I feel like I am juggling when I am<br/>\nperforming the activity of keeping several song affects active at once.<br/>\nExamine the following definition of the word &quot;juggle&quot; as it is derived from<br/>\nWebster&#39;s dictionary:<br/>\n<br/>\nMain Entry: 1jug´┐¢gle<br/>\nPronunciation: &#39;j&-g&l<br/>\nFunction: verb<br/>\nInflected Form(s): jug´┐¢gled; jug´┐¢gling /-g(&-)li[ng]/<br/>\nEtymology: Middle English jogelen, from Middle French jogler to joke, from<br/>\nLatin joculari, from joculus, diminutive of jocus joke<br/>\nDate: 15th century<br/>\nintransitive senses<br/>\n1 : to perform the tricks of a juggler<br/>\n2 : to engage in manipulation especially in order to achieve a desired end<br/>\ntransitive senses<br/>\n1 a : to practice deceit or trickery on : BEGUILE b : to manipulate or<br/>\nrearrange especially in order to achieve a desired end &lt;juggle an account to<br/>\nhide a loss&gt;<br/>\n2 a : to toss in the manner of a juggler b : to hold or balance precariously<br/>\n3 : to handle or deal with usually several things (as obligations) at one<br/>\ntime so as to satisfy often competing requirements &lt;juggle the<br/>\nresponsibilities of family life and full-time job -- Jane S.
