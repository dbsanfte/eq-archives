Not only for me but the group.<br/>\n   When we have to evac, I sing this song and get <br/>\n   pretty much everything on me while the healer keeps<br/>\n   me alive and our gater gets us out. The reason this<br/>\n   song is so effective for me is because I&#39;m almost <br/>\n   always grouped with a healer. When I nod, it&#39;s the<br/>\n   job of my healer to keep me alive while the rest<br/>\n   work on killing one mob at a time. Also, because <br/>\n   nod pretty much taunts everything onto me, the <br/>\n   casters in my group have a easy time nuking one <br/>\n   target at a time. I usually do this when we pull<br/>\n   4 or more mobs. Very effective strategy from my <br/>\n   personal experience. Drawback is that this doesn&#39;t<br/>\n   really work with mobs that are higher level than me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Charm: I think it&#39;s a great song. Great way to get<br/>\n   stuff off casters and also great when the pull is<br/>\n   small. However in larger pulls, I favor Lullaby. I<br/>\n   don&#39;t always have this song memmed though. Depends<br/>\n   on where I go to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Pixie Strike: Too bad this doesn&#39;t wipe S-List as <br/>\n   one of the bard webpages claimed. Another great song<br/>\n   However, the problem I have with using Pixie Strike<br/>\n   for crowd control is this, I have to keep changing <br/>\n   targets. And I don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but<br/>\n   sometimes, I find it impossible to click on the mob<br/>\n   I wish to target. This is esp true when all of them<br/>\n   are clumped together. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDarrian Ashoka<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
