The last one,<br/>\nsomehow I lived.  I played resists the entire battle.  When<br/>\nall three melee people and the cleric in my group died, I was<br/>\nat a bubble and a half so I meleed Vox a bit, healed the<br/>\n(still alive) enchanter, meleed the priest of Nagafen and some<br/>\nice giants a bit.  I was expecting to get summoned at any<br/>\nmoment, but I ran around doing all this for about 3 minutes<br/>\nwith nothing happening.  I didn&#39;t know what to do because it&#39;d<br/>\nnever occurred to me that I might live.  Eventually I zoned.  <br/>\nI think I was the only melee person to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, the first try, I played my resist song for a couple<br/>\nrounds, Vox summoned me, and clawed me to death right off the<br/>\nbat.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
