If you charmed a mob to kill another and your pet is <br/>\ndoing most of the damage, you HAVE to have your pet in charmed mode when the <br/>\nother one dies.  The reason is the stronger mob was doing most of the damage <br/>\nand game remembers that, so when the weaker mob die, it will credit the <br/>\nstronger mob for the kill and if the stronger mob is not charmed at that <br/>\ntime, your party will not get any xp and the weaker mob will poof.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is Pixie Strike is not broken.  It just won&#39;t work against <br/>\nsome of the mob like HG or Cyclops.  They have a natural immunity to stun, <br/>\nmes, or pixie strike type of spells.  I don&#39;t know if this was introduced <br/>\nafter the recent patch or what, but one of the enchanter from my guild told <br/>\nus that she can no longer Mes a HG.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not certain, but I think that corpses only go *poof*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when the mob dies and the thing you&#39;ve been charming to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill it is not currently charmed.  They check to see who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; did the most damage, and since the thing that did the most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is an unaligned NPC, *poof*.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
