And I&#39;m dying, I <br/>\n&gt;think. I have loved this list like no other board&#39;ve known in some years.   <br/>\n&gt;It is highly intellectual, why I bother you with this damned heavy luggage.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have to agree, of the lists I&#39;ve been on, this is one of the best.  We <br/>\ngenerally get few mindless rants and many insighful opinions compared to the <br/>\nratios on, say, the brewing list.  I personally think it&#39;s because of the <br/>\nkind of person that likes to play bards, but I have a slight bias. = )<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;* It runs deep, I think.  There is no wandering.  Everyone stays put.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Roop, you yourself helped me to start really traveling long distances, and I <br/>\nam quite grateful you took me on my first trip to Halas (bashing vengeful <br/>\nskellies, getting lost in EverFrost - hmmm sounds like a good song title).  <br/>\nI don&#39;t know about everyone else, but in the last three days I have traveled <br/>\nfrom Kelethin to Halas to Qeynos (one night), from Qeynos to Halas back to <br/>\nKelethin (another night), and from Kelethin to Freeport (last night).  Every <br/>\nnight I also made stops in Mistmoore a few times (hoping against hope for <br/>\nsomeone to sell me the dang drum).  Now, this is definitely travel on a <br/>\nglobal scale.  I do it often - heck, I have saved up enough Stormbreaker <br/>\nfrequent passenger miles to qualify for the Kunark cruise First Class.  <br/>\nEveryone does not stay put - many do.  But then, many people do stupid <br/>\nthings IRL too, and I feel no compulsion to follow them there either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Camping is a problem, everyone says, and we have all these solutions <br/>\n&gt;suggested and implemented.  But, mmmm, none will work!  Camping is central <br/>\n&gt;to EverQuest!  Everyone camps!  Everywhere!  Been to Unrest?  How else do <br/>\n&gt;you survive there but &quot;camp the wall?&quot;  These people aren&#39;t camping for <br/>\n&gt;items, but just to play.  Folks camp every dungeon, every outdoor zone. <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been to West Karanas and watched folks pulling lions to the wall.  And <br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s the same everywhere else.  Was suggested by a friend, since I so <br/>\n&gt;loathed camping, to play the south Karanas.  I am currently &quot;camped&quot; there <br/>\n&gt;now, because that&#39;s all anyone does in such an outdoor zone as well!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like camping either.  I do almost all my hunting in outdoor zones, <br/>\nand I run around looking for good game.  This may become harder and harder <br/>\nat higher levels, but for now I rarely find it difficult to track down <br/>\nsomething around my level to hunt... I have spent a lot of time killing <br/>\nkodiaks in the Commonlands, hunting beetles in the Karanas, etc.  This is <br/>\nnot camping - I literally run until I find something to kill.  Yes, if I am <br/>\nin a dangerous zone like North Karana (wayyyy to many grifs wandering around <br/>\nto hang out in the middle) I do pull monsters away from the action to a <br/>\nplace of relative safety, such as Xanuusus&#39; little grove to the North.  But <br/>\nthat&#39;s just a basic survival tactic.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t like camping?  Avoid dungeons unless you have a good group.  Most <br/>\ngroups do camp spawn points because it pays off.  I find this to be <br/>\ntypically boring, just like you do.  Yes, the best loot is found by camping. <br/>\n  So I make money by hunting and by performing and by doing people favors <br/>\nand I buy the loot I am unwilling to camp.  I have even had fun a few times <br/>\ncamping, but this is entirely dependant on the group.  People who like to <br/>\nscrew around, have some fun, make humorous emotes... they can really liven <br/>\nup a boring few minutes of waiting.  I try to be such a person when I can, <br/>\nand seek out the company of others who actually want to roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nA small digression - warriors can stop to heal and casters can stop to med <br/>\nwithout camping.  Just because you stop to rest for a few minutes does not <br/>\nmean you are compelled to stay there until something attacks you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;:My solution:  No natural regeration of wounds, for anyone.  This is not <br/>\n&gt;how wounds work, afterall.  A warrior is wounded, make no natural <br/>\n&gt;regeneration but increase effect of bandages.  They want healing, find a <br/>\n&gt;freaking cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You said you wanted less down-time?  Removing healing would cripple everyone <br/>\nexcept clerics, druids, shamans, and of course us bards.  Now, while I am in <br/>\nfavor of grouping, how would a level 1 character ever survive if he could <br/>\nnot heal at all?  Every healer in the world would be CONSTANTLY bombarded <br/>\nwith people begging for heals, and in fact the healer classes, now very <br/>\noverpowered, would see a huge influx.  Hell, I think personally we&#39;d see a <br/>\nLOT more bards.  But the point is, this is not at all feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;No regeneration of mana either.  I know there&#39;s no real-world counter-part, <br/>\n&gt;which others would point out THIS IS A GAME anyway in the last argument, <br/>\n&gt;but we&#39;re talking logic.  Mana, where does it come from?  The physics of <br/>\n&gt;mana? Where is this pure energy coming from?  Apparently Norrath does have <br/>\n&gt;gravity, and follows Einstein, so we must assume Energy cannot be just <br/>\n&gt;created out of thin air.  It needs a source....  The soul I always assumed, <br/>\n&gt;but that can only supply so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly why there is a set mana regeneration rate... casters don&#39;t just get <br/>\nall their mana at once.  Their soul, or spirit, recharges at a rate based on <br/>\ntheir requisite characteristics.  If a wizard is more intelligent, he has <br/>\ngreater mental capacity to hold the energy he manipulates... becuase he <br/>\nunderstands and uses this energy intellectually.  A cleric needs wisdom, <br/>\nbecuase his link to the energy flow of the world is through the depth of his <br/>\nunderstanding of how his god manifests in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Enough with everyone sitting on their duffs.  Burn mana in a battle, run <br/>\n&gt;and hope you&#39;re not chased to find a private spot to channel spirit spell <br/>\n&gt;to regain all your lost mana.  I want the game to require people to be on <br/>\n&gt;THE MOVE and not encourage them to sit around like they&#39;re lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rather than requiring you move, I&#39;d like the game to reward you more if you <br/>\ndo.  A difference in approach... I noticed last night that quests now give <br/>\nappreciable experience.  Heck, at level 15 I think I saw a rise from <br/>\ndelivering the mail, and I got about 1/4 bubble for killing the Nybright <br/>\nsisters and bringing their necklaces to their besotted father.  So Verant is <br/>\ntaking some small steps to encourage people to do quests, which pretty much <br/>\nalways involve moving around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;*  AI lacking.  In a massively multiplayer game it should be better, <br/>\n&gt;especially one that is so Player vs. Environment based.   This is AI that <br/>\n&gt;was seen in Doom, if that.  The wonder of AI that some folks are impressed <br/>\n&gt;by how it acts, when it&#39;s actions are not that complex.  MUST be improved. <br/>\n&gt;When I fight this AI, it makes me bored.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, the AI is far from perfect, and it has numerous bugs.  Still, I remember <br/>\nrecently facing a camp of orcs and being impressed that the oracles sit in <br/>\nplace and buff up all the cents, that when you attack one they will all mob <br/>\nyou, that they figure out who is the greatest threat and typically all <br/>\nattack it at once... that is what they&#39;re doing, I hope.  I like to believe <br/>\nthat monsters attack bards preferentially because we are the greatest threat <br/>\nto them...  No, they are not as smart as players... well, most players. = )<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;* Tradeskills are lacking.  I have a feeling, given a year, this may work <br/>\n&gt;out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  I regret the fact that Verant does not give much support to <br/>\ntrade skills, and that brewing has been so difficult of late.  I am sure <br/>\nthat has hit you as hard as it has me... nerfing Ol&#39;Tujim&#39;s, then releasing <br/>\na lot of new recipes onyl to find we can&#39;t make many of them... it&#39;s <br/>\nfrustrating.  I recently took up baking for kicks, and have found it to be <br/>\npretty fun.  I don&#39;t try to make a profit off trades anymore, I just do it <br/>\nfor the roleplaying...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;* Death.  There is no death.  I want to die.  I cannot die.  Who were the <br/>\n&gt;generation before this, the immortal generation?  Totally ignored by the <br/>\n&gt;story of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have never played any computer game (that I recall) where death was <br/>\n&quot;real&quot;.  You either get resurrected with some penalty, or you have a certain <br/>\nnumber of &quot;lives&quot; per game, after which you start over with another set of <br/>\n&quot;lives&quot;.  Granted how many times we die in EQ, I am very glad death is not <br/>\npermanent... otherwise no one would ever make 10th level. = )<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It is like a moment locked in time, it never changes.  No matter what <br/>\n&gt;anyone does, the NPCs will always be locked in that moment, regardless what <br/>\n&gt;level the real folk have gotten to.  The &quot;plot&quot; is unchanging.  Join a <br/>\n&gt;massively online rolplaying game with an ongoing plot!  There is no ongoing <br/>\n&gt;plot. Everything is the same.  It always has been, always will.  McQuaid <br/>\n&gt;wants people to appreciate where items come from plotwise, when they buy <br/>\n&gt;them or find them.  Yet I&#39;m afraid those subtlties are lost when it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;always that same NPC in that same place, and they never change.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would like to see some sort of plot evolution too... but the point was <br/>\nwell made elsewhere.  How would any new player ever keep up with massive <br/>\nchanges?  Now, maybe some day Antonius Bayle will be assassinated, and <br/>\nQeynos will fall under the sway of his evil brother... but even something <br/>\nlike this would massively screw with newbies in that zone.  I don&#39;t honestly <br/>\nknow, algorythmically, how to solve the problem of having an evolving plot <br/>\nthat does not cause all new characters to be at a HUGE disadvantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;* Fix the damned NPC parser.  Using Scott Adams Parser in 1999!!!!  Infocom <br/>\n&gt;got it better in 1985!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, the parser is not very sophisticated, granted.  I&#39;d like to see this <br/>\nimprove as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;* To really encourage roleplaying and a community allow people access to an <br/>\n&gt;in-game print press.  Where they can make their own newspapers or books. <br/>\n&gt;Allow people to own a deck of cards so they can play kings court and <br/>\n&gt;gamble. Make a Roulette Wheel when a PC spins it everyone can watch the <br/>\n&gt;text as it clicks along.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, there is one option along these lines... the message board in Qeynos.  <br/>\nI&#39;d like to see these in every city in Norrath... some of the personals are <br/>\nreally funny... Mael trol luking for inky pet fur barshin and luvvin...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to see the cards too... though I hear there are cards in game, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think we can play.  After all, in the Bristlebane section of the <br/>\nmanual don&#39;t they warn you against playing King&#39;s Court with a worshipper of <br/>\nthe god of tricks?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;NAMELY<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GIVE folks options besides combat!!!  I ask this, because the way combat <br/>\n&gt;works in EverQuest bores the living crap out of me.  If it weren&#39;t for the <br/>\n&gt;way groups worked, &quot;heroes&quot; sitting around in some safe corner while <br/>\n&gt;squires hauled the monsters one at a time for them.... BAH!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The options besides combat are few, but meaningful.  There are quests... I <br/>\nknow there are a finite number, and many don&#39;t seem that rewarding.  I use <br/>\nquests as a means of accomplishing one of my personal goals: I want to make <br/>\nall the NPCs in the cities I frequent love me.  I want to have everyone I <br/>\ndeal with look on me warmly.  So I go off and run small quests and feel like <br/>\nI am progressing towards a huge and nigh-impossible goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is exploration... Norrath is pretty big, and given enough time and <br/>\ndedication I am sure you can see everything... but given the rare spawns and <br/>\nthe fact that many things move around, the same zone is not the same each <br/>\ntime you visit it.  I want to see the Lake Rathe monster!  I want to see the <br/>\nnamed sea serpent in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron!  I want to give Cazic Thule a <br/>\nwedgie!  Well, ok, maybe not soon, but someday...<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly, there are other PCs.  Most of the really good times I have <br/>\nhad in EQ have been in player interactions.  Last night a good friend of <br/>\nmine named Murtik sent me a /tell to say a friend of his was on a scavenger <br/>\nhunt and wanted some edible goo.  He was willing to pay well (15pp for 3 of <br/>\nthem!!!) so I ran back to Freeport with my friend and master baker Bayrn.  <br/>\nWe brought the goo and gave it to Guta, and also threw in some cookies and a <br/>\nBlackburrow stout, on the house.  We eneded up sitting around the bank for <br/>\nabout a half hour, just talking and drinking and screwing around.  I can&#39;t <br/>\neven say it wasn&#39;t profitable (beyond the very genrous money for the goo)... <br/>\nthe kindly Guta appreciated my roleplaying and my generosity (hey, he gave <br/>\nme a lot of money for something made out of fire beetle eyes and rat ears, I <br/>\nwas in a good mood) so he gave me some bronze armor.  He was happy, I was <br/>\nhappy, and it had nothing to do with killing things or camping.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop, you were an inspiration to me when I was a young lad in Kelethin.  You <br/>\ngave me my first drink of Elven Wine (now I have maxed out my alcohol <br/>\ntolerance every level since).  You took me on my first trip from Freeport to <br/>\nHalas.  You answered some of my newbie questions about bards.  I am truly <br/>\nsorry to hear you are not enjoying the game anymore.  I think you can find <br/>\nother things to do in Norrath that you will enjoy more, and sincerely hope <br/>\nthat some of the suggestions I gave above will be helpful.  If not, I for <br/>\none will miss you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay your voice always be sweet,<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
