Well, a pull went bad and<br/>\nwe ended up with 2 bok knights, several dars, kor wizards etc. I mass<br/>\nfeared them and called for evac, but our wizard just sat there. Knowing<br/>\nwe could last very long, I told the cleric to heal me full then gate,<br/>\nthe monk FD&#39;d, and the other 2 party members were also able to gate.<br/>\nWhat followed was me running while blaring mass fear with a HUGE train<br/>\nthrough lower guk undead side. Because nothing was camped, it was<br/>\nthrough full spawn. I unfortunately died about 100 feet to the zone line<br/>\nfrom getting rooted, but you should have seen that overhead view of my<br/>\ncorpse - both boks still with me, 3-4 dars, a kor, several zols and<br/>\nwans, all 5 greater ice bones (lol!) etc. The rest of the team,<br/>\nfortunately all survived except for me. The wizard had gone afk without<br/>\ntelling anyone *sigh*, but what a memorable attempt at zoning that was.<br/>\nAt least the Corpse Recovery was easy for the cleric. =P<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; nice, ghoul lord at zone.  never seen that before.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
