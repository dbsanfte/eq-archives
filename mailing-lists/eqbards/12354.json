The<br/>\ngood feelings from the raids (Vox, Nagefen and Fear all went down in a<br/>\nperiod of 3 days) quickly turned into animosity, arguments, cries of<br/>\nelitism, and just plain bad mojo.  The raids seem to have touched off a<br/>\nfirestorm of debate about who gets to go, who gets what loot, etc...  It&#39;s<br/>\njust plain bad mojo and I know a lot of players who have quite Prexus<br/>\nbecause of it.  Just check out the message boards on www.prexus.com in<br/>\nregards to the dragon raids and the plane raids.  My guild is medium sized<br/>\n(40 or so) and well respected, but we only have one level 50 and almost<br/>\neveryone else is in the low 30&#39; which means we don&#39;t have any<br/>\nrepresentatives in the current raids.  Since I&#39;m getting closer to<br/>\nparticipating in this stuff, I&#39;m wondering if it might not make sense to<br/>\nstart over on another server...  On the other hand, there are a lot of<br/>\nreally great 30 something people on Prexus both in my guild and in other<br/>\nguilds with who we have great relations (also all 30 something guilds) and<br/>\nI&#39;m really really hoping the landscape changes by the time I get to 45+...<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 04, 2000 10:51 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Cazic Thule slain on Innoruuk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; WTG Harm - etal!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got to hear a lot of it thru guildsay - like listening to the &#39;big game&#39;<br/>\n&gt; on the radio.
