First, according to<br/>\n&gt;screenshots on a couple EQ sites, it says the Guise is for bards and rogues<br/>\n&gt;only.  Is this still true?  I ran into a barbarian once who had one on.  He<br/>\n&gt;used it to make him smaller so he could get into tight places.  I&#39;m almost<br/>\n&gt;certain he was a warrior (I did a /who on him).  Second question is the NO<br/>\n&gt;DROP flag.  The screenshots I saw listed it as a NO DROP item.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;much experience with NO DROP items so not certain how this works.  If<br/>\n&gt;someone has one can I buy it from them?  What if someone who can&#39;t equip it<br/>\n&gt;loots it off the creature that drops it? Does that mean it is forever<br/>\n&gt;unusable?  Last question, if it can be sold/traded, what is the fair price<br/>\n&gt;for it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
