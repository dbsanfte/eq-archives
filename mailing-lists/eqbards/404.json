That is why I use IRC servers. the tech is a bit more solid,<br/>\nand designed for larger groups. And with all the free servers out there (I<br/>\nfrequent StarChat, it is smaller and less crowed than DalNet, and some of<br/>\nthe other well known IRC nets). The other advantage is that it has better<br/>\nsecurity for founders, and it does not require the founder be online<br/>\n(without interruption) for a gathering.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis way people can gather anytime they want to live chat. And those picked<br/>\nto be ops can keep control at all times though Chanserv. I would like to<br/>\nsuggest you investigate this method. I have created, oped, and attended many<br/>\nchannels on IRC and find it the best for such an endeavor.&lt;/OOC&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t- SnowLynx, Gentleman Bard of Freeport...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel P.
