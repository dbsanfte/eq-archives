I wasn&#39;t sure if the horn worked since there<br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to any kind of dance or animation at all with it.  Is that<br/>\nnormal?  I did notice a horn mouthpiece in Qeynos when I spent a few<br/>\nminutes there the other day, is that anything useful?  Or have I just<br/>\nmissed something totally obvious on my infrequent travels!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m out for the day, so I think I&#39;ll leave it running at just<br/>\nthe point you suggest!!  Thanks again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, 20 Nov 1999 03:58:39 EST, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Valharick@...\">Valharick@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You want to use a plain ol&#39; horn. And you will miss MANY notes at first. I <br/>\n&gt;would suggest going someone far away from people, kicking the song up, and <br/>\n&gt;let it sit for a couple hours. That will give you a good start into the <br/>\n&gt;skill. And contrary to what some people say, you do not have to have a target <br/>\n&gt;for the skill to rise. <br/>\n&gt;The place I chose for my AFK practice was in Qeynos Hills all the way across <br/>\n&gt;the zone from the entrance to the karana&#39;s, up on the hill. I didn&#39;t see one <br/>\n&gt;living thing and even after letting it sit all night I was still alive :)<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, good luck to ya.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Renaldo Rallentando of the 34th String<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSaldara, High Elf Wizard (29 ... again)<br/>\nMelaniel, Wood Elf Bard (18)<br/>\nBrindarya, Dark Elf Warrior (5) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
