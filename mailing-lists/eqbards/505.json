It is a bad idea for m at Level<br/>\n15 unless I have a pretty good group.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t buy ringmail . . . buy banded armor. Much better, and probably<br/>\ncheaper depending on the smith you get it from. As far as I know, makes<br/>\nyour character look exactly the same. I started buying my banded set when I<br/>\nwas Level 10 . . . completed it at Level 14 to the tune of about 120 plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I made levels 10 and 11 easily in Blackburrow. Just kill all the<br/>\nGnolls, Patrolling Gnolls, and Giant Snakes you can handle. The place is<br/>\ntrain central, but since it is &quot;outdoors&quot; you can outrun most trains . . .<br/>\nor you can group and kill guards and elites. I made about 5 plat per trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:54 AM 5/6/99 , you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;John Hosenberg&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:waper9@...\">waper9@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thought 10th circle was specific enough, but 10th lvl.  Already got my basic <br/>\n&gt;PW set back and such, but it seems like I should be moving onto ringmail by <br/>\n&gt;this time, least I see some bards with it on.  And heard that maybe Dagnor&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;is good since they have aqua goblins? good money/exp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bryne<br/>\n&gt;10th circle<br/>\n&gt;Songweaver<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
