I just made 20th level and for the first time<br/>\nhad to think really hard on what songs I wanted to memorize.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink the spellcasting classes really have much of a problem with this.<br/>\nMany of their spells at higher levels are just improved versions of<br/>\nspells they had at lower levels.  They don&#39;t really have to worry about<br/>\nmemorizing their low level spells once they reach a certain point.  That<br/>\nisn&#39;t the case for us.  With a few exceptions, almost all of our songs<br/>\neach have their own unique effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can safely say that I will almost always have Selos and Hymn of<br/>\nRestoration memorized.  Anthem or Warsong is another automatic.  That<br/>\nleaves me with 5 slots for all the remaining 18 songs I know.  If the<br/>\nchoice is hard now, I can&#39;t imagine what its like later on down the<br/>\nroad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if Verant will ever add 8 more spell/song slots for the right<br/>\nside of the screen. Even more optimistically, I wonder if Verant will<br/>\never make it where we don&#39;t have to memorize songs at all but instead<br/>\nknow them all by heart.  This would give us the ability to sing any song<br/>\nat any time as long as we had it in our songbook.  I realize this is<br/>\nwishful thinking on my part but you never know.  Maybe with the<br/>\nexpansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
