I HATE Kithicor!  It is the most scary place<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; have been - so far.  But I keep going back!  I have had Ged make me his<br/>\n&gt; Bearskin gloves and am looking for a HQ LION to get the finest ones in all<br/>\n&gt; of Norrath.  Jed&#39;s druid friend - she won&#39;t talk to me not even with my<br/>\n&gt; cha<br/>\n&gt; song.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is anyone keeping track of the various inter-twining of these kind of<br/>\n&gt; things?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, talking to Furball Miller on the Miller farm. His sad story<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; woe.  Then, there is the letter from the DE that the halfling in the<br/>\n&gt; Hogcallers Inn has (part of the Lady Shae quest.) I got the letter and<br/>\n&gt; read<br/>\n&gt; it.  It implies that you can get a special thing if you deliver it to the<br/>\n&gt; correct person. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wonder if there is some underlying tale about Norrath or are these just<br/>\n&gt; independent little quest things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly. <br/>\n&gt; \t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom:\tElijah Meeker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t\tSent:\tMonday, July 12, 1999 11:42 AM<br/>\n&gt; \t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Adventure vacations levels<br/>\n&gt; 12-15 *spoilers*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tFrom: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;Finally someone else notices...I get sick of those messages<br/>\n&gt; that say<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;something like, &quot;We need to get rid of useless<br/>\n&gt; zones....like Kithicor&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tHeehee!
