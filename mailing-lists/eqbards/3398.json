Next thing I know it did just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that!  Since when is there a faction of Wolves?  Unnerved I walked <br/>\n&gt;around<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think ever since they fixed it so wolves and bears no longer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;attack druids and rangers on sight.  I would dearly love to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know how to raise my faction with wolf as I&#39;ve always liked<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wolves.  :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmmm, doubt that.  I kill wolves all of the time, and I do mean all of the<br/>\n&gt;time, trying to find those quality pelts you understand so I can clothe<br/>\n&gt;myself in studded and some day reinforced armor.  I even died yesterday <br/>\n&gt;when<br/>\n&gt;4 silvermist wolves decided I was being mean to their fellow in N Karana <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;joined in.  I have never seen a hit to &#39;Wolf&#39; faction before and they all<br/>\n&gt;still glare threateningly at me like they did the day I was born.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kitasi the wolf-hated?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
