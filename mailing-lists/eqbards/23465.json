Run a voodoo 3000 vid card and<br/>\nan sb live, oh and a 1* 128meg sim of 100mhz ram.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my problem, I pretty much only play EQ, check email and surf.  Lately<br/>\ni&#39;ve had a few solid lockups playing eq, some crashes to desktop as well.<br/>\nYesterday i got 2 in 10-15 minutes and the day before i died while kiting<br/>\ndue to this (grrr)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I tried deinstalling EQ, reinstalling EQ, RoK and SoV.  While<br/>\nreinstalling SoV, total lockup again.  This indicated to me that probably my<br/>\npc is overheating or something.  Another thing i&#39;ve noticed while playing is<br/>\nthat my graphics seem to be choppier than normal (more vid lag, and its not<br/>\nswarmcaller) (which indicates to me processing problems).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... Tonight I&#39;m going to probably rip the pc open, check if my fan is<br/>\nstill working, if it is i&#39;ll proceed to downclock the cpu back to 300 like<br/>\nits supposed to be.  If my pc is still acting up from there i&#39;ll reinstall<br/>\nwin98 (arg i hate doing this, takes forever with all my apps).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what the prob may be, I have a<br/>\nfeeling my cpu might be nearing retirement but i&#39;m really hoping this isnt<br/>\nthe case because i dont have the cash to buy a new chip/board cause that<br/>\nwould run me about 350$ canadian for a 700mhz/board<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
