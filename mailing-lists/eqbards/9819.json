From what I have observed, it seems to work similarly to our other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; songs.  When the effect goes off the mobs get a chance to resist.  If they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fail to resist they nod.  When they would next get to attack they get a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chance to break the nod, if they do they attack.  Just as with some other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; songs this results in the effect getting broken before it ever costs the MOB<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So why do mobs that are 30 levels lower than me seem to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;succeed&quot; at this &quot;second resist&quot; about 60%-80% of the time?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I forget offhand what the other songs are that function this way, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; remember John lamenting on the fact that the song could work and be broken<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before it really had any effect.  I have seen it to always interrupt a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; caster if they nod though in my experience, but then again I haven&#39;t been to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Temple of Cazic Thule. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know something similar happens with root.  However, if mobs<br/>\n&gt; were breaking root at anywhere near the frequency they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &quot;breaking out&quot; of Lullaby and Pixie Strike, the casters would<br/>\n&gt; string GZ up by the... ahem.  Anyhow, the fact that Pixie<br/>\n&gt; Strike works much better if you successfully get one to stick<br/>\n&gt; leads me to believe this is a bona fide bug, and not a high<br/>\n&gt; &quot;second resist&quot; effect.  If it were just a &quot;second resist&quot;<br/>\n&gt; effect, then it shouldn&#39;t matter whether or not you&#39;ve gotten<br/>\n&gt; one Pixie Strike to stick.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
