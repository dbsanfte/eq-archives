Well IMHO Lullaby is one of the absolute most<br/>\nuseful songs I have in my arsenal, ranked right up there with Consonant<br/>\nChain and Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I would like to stress here - MOST BARD SONGS ARE NOT VERY<br/>\nEFFECTIVE AT THE LEVEL YOU GET THEM! Give it a couple levels, get your<br/>\nskills up in the requisite instrument - All of a sudden the songs are more<br/>\neffective, being resisted less, you are missing fewer notes etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nI find the Lullaby particulary useful for train control. Last night in Cazic<br/>\nThule i was hunting with a barbarian warrior and a human cleric. He pulled<br/>\nfrom the throne room and a spawn occured and we were fighting 2 gorillas and<br/>\na lizard. Well with Lullaby, the two gorillas slept like babies.  Now yeah<br/>\nthey woke up, but a couple rounds after the &quot;nod off&quot; message, they were<br/>\nsleeping again and we all fought the lizard, moved to the next gorilla and<br/>\nthen killed the last one. Could I do this effectively at 15th level even to<br/>\ngreens - NO! However as I have grown, the effectiveness of this song has<br/>\ngrown with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing with Selo Consanant Chain.  When I first got this at 23 it<br/>\nwas resisted 80% of the time. That is down to about 25% of the time against<br/>\nblues now, meaning that if I repeatedly sing this song i *can* stop a runner<br/>\nbefore it goes and brings friends.  Be patient, experiment, practice. Make<br/>\nyour level, rinse and repeat &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig disadvantage of Lullaby - cannot be juggled<br/>\nBig advantage of Lullaby - GREAT TO INTERRUPT THOSE PESKY CASTERS!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 copper.....<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon, 30th Rank Bard of Bertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
