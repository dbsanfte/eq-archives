My internal case fan<br/>\nwas unplugged and 2 out of my 3 cpu fans were dead (ack!).  Turns out the 2<br/>\nfans that have a common power plug on the mother board seem to have a faulty<br/>\nplug.  I swapped it so that 2 of the 3 fans are on the other reliable power<br/>\nplug and that the third fan is on the faulty one (it goes on and off).<br/>\nSince i&#39;ve fixed all my fans the pc has yet to hang, and i&#39;ve done a couple<br/>\nof 4-5 hours sprints of gaming and everything is ok woot.
