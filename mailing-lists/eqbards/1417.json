For<br/>\nmy Bard I have a similar bank of hotkeys that allows me to access my melee slots<br/>\nand three inventory slots (one of those is occupied by a backpack to allow<br/>\naccess to all instruments) the sixth slot has a &quot;Run Away!&quot; text key.    That is<br/>\nthe bank of keys I use most of the time now, but my other bank of keys has sense<br/>\nheading, forage, /assist, /loc,  /corpse, and a &quot;Run Away!&quot; key.  It is easy to<br/>\nswitch between them (shift and numbers one through six), but I rarely find it<br/>\nnecessary to switch in critical situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The recent discussion on the use of the /assist command has got me wondering<br/>\n&gt; how other bards setup their macros.  For myself, up to this point I have<br/>\n&gt; only used one bank (6 hot-keys) of macros.  I have not setup the other five<br/>\n&gt; banks.  If I have confused anyone, I use the term bank to refer to the six<br/>\n&gt; buttons you can hotkey in the lower left hand portion of your screen.  You<br/>\n&gt; can hit Shift-# to switch banks or you can use your mouse to cycle through<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For my first bank, I have two inventory slots and two melee slots macroed so<br/>\n&gt; I quickly switch from weapon/shield to an instrument if the situation calls<br/>\n&gt; for it.  I have hot-keyed Sense Heading and Foraging to take up the other<br/>\n&gt; two slots.  I hotkeyed Sense Heading so when I am fleeing I dont have to<br/>\n&gt; worry about switching macro banks.  I have Foraging hotkeyed so I can<br/>\n&gt; continually click on it in between combats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t worried about macroing songs because I can click on them with my<br/>\n&gt; mouse just as easy as hitting the hotkey.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m beginning to think that I should place /assist on my main macro bank but<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t like the idea of moving Sense Heading or Forage to another bank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How does everyone else have their hotkeys setup?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you entered ONElist&#39;s &quot;Grow to Give&quot; program?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline is June 19.
