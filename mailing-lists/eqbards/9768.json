Bards max at 40 foraging, right?<br/>\n&gt; 2. At what level do you usually reach 40 skill foraging?<br/>\n&gt; 3. Have any of you bards managed to forage something other than berries,<br/>\n&gt; fruit, rabbit meat, roots, veggies and water? And at what skill level did<br/>\n&gt; you get it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone know about druids? (Like, if you have a druid, what is his skill cap<br/>\n&gt; and has he found any of the items, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My druid never saw any of the special food until around 99 skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
