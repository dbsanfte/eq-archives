I&#39;ve found it works best if I dont have people set follow to me,<br/>\nbut to someone who&#39;s about the slowest in the party. Then I follow that<br/>\nperson too, that puts me in the middle of the group instead of ahead,<br/>\nmaking it more likely I will keep everyone under the effect of Selo&#39;s.<br/>\nHowever this often also results in my client deciding the person I was<br/>\nfollowing turned right and ran in a circle a couple of times then<br/>\ndisappeared, when in fact they continued in a straight line. <br/>\n<br/>\nA good trick I used to use before the follow patch that can still be<br/>\nuseful is when you are leading with Selo&#39;s and need to slow down to let<br/>\npeople catch up, instead of stopping, which usually causes most of your<br/>\nparty to also stop to see why you stopped, crouch while running, which<br/>\nwill slow you down considerably. <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
