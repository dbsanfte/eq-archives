Also I was wondering, besides<br/>\n&gt; rubicite, is there another armor that has the very high AC <br/>\n&gt; and yet is light?<br/>\n&gt; Is mesh an option for bards?  What exactly is mesh anyway?  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard many<br/>\n&gt; Looking to buy&#39;s but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever actually noticed anyone<br/>\n&gt; wearing it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And my gripe of the day -- TWINKING HAS BECOME RAMPANT ON <br/>\n&gt; EROLLISI MARR!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; I saw a lvl 5 bard yesterday walking through Freeport with a <br/>\n&gt; full suit of<br/>\n&gt; bronze plate.  That&#39;s just silly.  He said a friend gave it <br/>\n&gt; to him, nice<br/>\n&gt; gift.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, my real life brother-in-law just started <br/>\n&gt; about 3 days<br/>\n&gt; ago.  No sooner had his new character spawned at the Freeport <br/>\n&gt; gates than<br/>\n&gt; some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked if he <br/>\n&gt; wanted a 2H<br/>\n&gt; instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could tell <br/>\n&gt; him how to say<br/>\n&gt; thank you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.  I guess <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just bent<br/>\n&gt; because my bank account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly <br/>\n&gt; so there&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; way I could buy plate or any other really cool items yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Weiland the Extremely Poor Bard of Freeport<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enjoy 120+ unique music channels right from your desktop!
