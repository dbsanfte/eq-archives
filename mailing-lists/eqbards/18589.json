For awhile, other guilds would ask them to step back and give them a shot at Dragons,<br/>\nthey would give the guild 24 hours, then they&#39;d step in and do it in 2.  :)  They&#39;re an extraordinarily<br/>\ncapable and well-organized guild.  With that, in some cases, comes a touch of arrogance which is kind of<br/>\noff-putting, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s anywhere near as bad on Innoruuk as on other servers, and of<br/>\ncourse, it&#39;s still dependent on the individual.  I didn&#39;t realize they were as small as they are; I&#39;m even<br/>\nmore impressed now!<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot about some of the daytime and foreign guilds.  They&#39;re big, too, now that I think about who I see<br/>\naround when I&#39;m on at 10am EST.  Yesterday, I saw two Avenguardia members talking French.  In Dark<br/>\nElvish.  Now that will twist your head a little!<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 49 songs, Innoruuk (who was asked the other day whose twink he was because he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nlevel 50 yet.
