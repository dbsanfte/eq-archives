Plan carefully<br/>\nto thwart this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But that&#39;s not the way it is so we end up with a player driven economy.  My<br/>\n&gt; group has lots of money and we buy the stuff we want/need and simply avoid<br/>\n&gt; the ks&#39;ing campers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, many of the folks selling this stuff *are* the<br/>\nKSing campers or their mules.  I only buy from people and<br/>\nguilds I know don&#39;t stoop to KSing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  We did have one really lucky night in the Tae room in<br/>\n&gt; Cazic and got some rubi panties.  The next night was KS-Hell and we have not<br/>\n&gt; been back.  Stoopid Kyle, does he really think that we don&#39;t have see invis?<br/>\n&gt; So the moron sits by the throne.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One &quot;solution&quot; we stumbled upon was to not break up the<br/>\nspawns.  Take them on all at once, with the item-dropping mob<br/>\nin the middle or last (assuming you have the place to yourself<br/>\nat the start).  Some friends and I were in the foreman room to<br/>\nget a scimitar as a gift for a friend (L38 druid and still<br/>\nusing a combine scimitar, tsk tsk), when some druid way too<br/>\nlow level to hold the room alone came by invisible and sat.  <br/>\nWe explained what we were doing, and offered to tell her when<br/>\nwe finished.  She shrugged and brushed us off.  So I just made<br/>\nmy whole group invisible.  First goblin spawned, she attacked<br/>\nit.  Second goblin spawned about 30 seconds later.  Then the<br/>\nthird goblin spawned 30 seconds after that.  When she dropped<br/>\nbelow half health, I told her to yell if she needed help.<br/>\nAfter a few more hits, she reluctantly asked for help, which<br/>\nwe did.  We&#39;d made our point - she couldn&#39;t hold/break the<br/>\nroom without us there.  So she left.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also have great armor is only marginally better that having &quot;average&quot;<br/>\n&gt; armors.  It looks a whole lot better!  But the real &quot;twink&quot; for power is in<br/>\n&gt; stat jewelry, stat items, and uber-weapons.  Those things will make a decent<br/>\n&gt; difference in your performance.  Armor is just the most visible twink.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup.  A L40 druid friend was asking me questions because her<br/>\nAC in leather was higher than a like-level dwarven warrior&#39;s<br/>\nAC in plate and crafted.  I played around with my armor and<br/>\nagility a bit, and figured out that her agility (126 or so)<br/>\nwas significantly multiplying the AC of all her armor pieces.  <br/>\nThe dwarf only had an agility of 80, so was receiving very<br/>\nlittle AC bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still need to test the &quot;armor absorption&quot; theory.  When I<br/>\ntested it 10 levels ago, in full plate with an AC in the low<br/>\n500s, wisps would usually hit me for 1-2 points with an<br/>\noccasional 20s.  In full mesh with an AC around 460, they&#39;d<br/>\nregularly hit me for 20s.  Now that my AC naked is in the<br/>\n500s, I&#39;ll have to test it again while naked and see if I&#39;m<br/>\nbeing hit for 1-2 or 20s.  Assuming of course that Verant<br/>\ndidn&#39;t tweak the game mechanics since then...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
