For fun and a change of pace, I took my lvl 5 Bard over to Erud to see if there would be any fun hunting.  Of course, I got hopelessly lost in the woods.  Anyway, in the process of asking directions someone who called me a Heretic came up behind me and clubbed me for 132 pts damage!!!  Needless to say, I died but I switched views to see who got me and there was no one there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Human Bard of Queynos formerly known as Weiland<br/>\nNow the Half Elf Bard of Freeport presently known as Weiland<br/>\nErollosi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
