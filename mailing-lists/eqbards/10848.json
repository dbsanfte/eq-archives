That s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I ve seen a lot","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1038050003\">I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>\nand I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk up to 23rd and an<br/>\nEnchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing that the best class in<br/>\nthe game was bard..  but I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent, dual Ykeshas, Flowing Black<br/>\nSilk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked out like a level 50<br/>\nthat hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago I saw a level 15 in<br/>\nfull Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other goodies as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly* discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nworking my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor that I have and I *still*<br/>\nlack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on the sands of Oasis,<br/>\nbeing *less* complete than a guy that started his bard last weekend.  Not<br/>\nonly that, he literally *laughed* at me for having 38 &#39;played&#39; days and not<br/>\nbeing level 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there ceases to be any way for players&#39; characters to differentiate<br/>\nthemselves from one another other based upon level (i.e. time and effort<br/>\nexpended), what is the point of continuing?  I want, when people look at me,<br/>\nfor them to know that I braved death and died many times to achieve the<br/>\narmor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to assume that I bought it from<br/>\na farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>\n&quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>\ndifferent story.  The bard that I saw in Oasis would have been in steel<br/>\nprobably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based upon<br/>\nmy efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know* that I had earned the<br/>\npieces for myself.  They would know that I had pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>\nMistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>\nfor a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not being NO DROP has reduced my<br/>\nefforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes me<br/>\nfeel this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
