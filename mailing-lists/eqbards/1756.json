I won&#39;t wear plate because it is too heavy (unless I find<br/>\na way to radically enhance my strength).  I would wear plate if I could.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink a rule change is in order.  Nobody is forcing anyone to wear plate.  I have<br/>\n100 Charisma and 100 Dex.  I like the decision I made, but I also realize that I<br/>\ncannot solo this character at the level I am or in the future.  I can take a lot of<br/>\nattacks and receive less damage than any of the tanks in my party.  I can&#39;t dish<br/>\nout the damage they do, but it all works out well this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t have the HP that the grunts do (not by a long shot).
