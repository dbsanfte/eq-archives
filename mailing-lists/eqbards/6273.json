While testing, my guildmates would make fun of a bard <br/>\n&gt;vs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a cleric how she would wup my ass.  She is a lvl 39 clerics that can <br/>\n&gt;solo a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Raider in HK just fine.  While me being a lvl 35 bard cannot even solo a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard blue guard, haha.\tSo anyway after my testing (which I posted on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another post), I told her why not duel and find out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
