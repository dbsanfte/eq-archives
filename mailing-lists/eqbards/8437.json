Matter of fact, I&#39;m the one who has been <br/>\ncalled on to do the quest by most of my friends because bards can bypass <br/>\nfaction requirements and because of item No Drop restrictions. I won&#39;t give <br/>\ndetails of the quest here, but anyone who does some digging (like 1, MAYBE 2 <br/>\npages into your favorite EQ spoiler site) can find out how to do it. The <br/>\ncatch is you HAVE to be a medium race with good faction both to complete the <br/>\nquest (if you can call it that), and to wear the resultant item. I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nsmall races try it and all quest related items are vaporized every time, <br/>\nwhether or not they have the right faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nLambent Armor: Aye, of course I&#39;m basing my decision on the currently known <br/>\nstats of the armor, and I&#39;ll definitely reevaluate this if the stats change <br/>\nby Wednesday. Either way, I&#39;ll most likely do the quests just for something <br/>\nto do. =) Finally a REAL quest that nets us something for US that is of <br/>\nworth. None of this fed-ex crap for some gold coins, or running all over <br/>\njust to get an unneeded copy of our level 1 song.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 48th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
