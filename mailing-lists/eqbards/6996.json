We all<br/>\nagreed that each one of our songs are unique right rather than like pure<br/>\ncasters where most of their spells are an upgrade.  Would it not be great<br/>\nfor us to beable to mem more than 8 since each songs takes us so long to<br/>\nmem.  With caster, each spell they have to mem takes them like 2 seconds.<br/>\nWith our songs it takes forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of we start out with 8 slots only.  Then each 4 lvl after lvl<br/>\n20, we get 1 extra slot to mem our songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do u all think?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\nBad Apple, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
