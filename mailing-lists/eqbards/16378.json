Since Beta 2 I have seen the gator a total of maybe 10 times.  But I<br/>\ndon&#39;t camp/hunt him so he may be slightly more frequent.  I did spend 5<br/>\nhours killing every gator in sight with my ranger once and couldn&#39;t get him<br/>\nto spawn.

I gave up and am waiting until I hit 35 so<br/>\nI can track.  I don&#39;t like wasting my Ranger&#39;s time tracking down items for<br/>\nmy bard.  He doesn&#39;t even know her after all.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
