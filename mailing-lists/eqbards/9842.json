The pathing is SCREWY here.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been camping the Courtyard extensively as of late and the spot along<br/>\nthe wall in the lower part of the courtyard as you are approaching the area<br/>\nbeneath the bridge.  When a train pours out of the castle, as the mobs are<br/>\nreturning they path so weirdly that they look like they are walking right<br/>\ntowards you and then through you and through the wall behind you.  I have<br/>\nseen mob after mob, gargs, gypsies, vamps, all kinds of stuff walk right<br/>\ninto me and disappear.  They do not see you and do not attack...their normal<br/>\npathing is screwed and it is a quirk that you can see them at all, if you<br/>\nwere to attack them while they were on this path their aggro radius has the<br/>\npotential of pulling the train back out of the castle on top of you but if<br/>\nyou leave them alone you are fine.  Weird and very scary at 2am in the<br/>\nmorning when your group of 6 comprises 60% of the people in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the tunnel right as  you enter MM you sometimes see a skeletal pet in the<br/>\ncorner in front of you just standing around...it will leave you alone but if<br/>\nyou attack it, its master on the other side of that wall which is deep<br/>\nwithin the castle, will kill you in a jiffy.  Pick your fights wisely and DO<br/>\nNOT, I repeat DO NOT use AE songs in this zone unless you are very certain<br/>\nof where you are what you might affect that is on the other side of a<br/>\nwall...it is utterly deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps Galt, sorry to hear about your misfortune.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 10, 1999 3:36 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Strange deaths in Mistmoore <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night, I was grouped with a necromancer in MM.  There were only a<br/>\n&gt; handful of people in the zone so we decided to pull the mobs <br/>\n&gt; back to the<br/>\n&gt; zone and fight there.  On one occasion, I pulled two <br/>\n&gt; familiars that we were<br/>\n&gt; handling just fine.  Out of nowhere, a flouting gargoyle <br/>\n&gt; appeared.  None of<br/>\n&gt; the other people in the zone were nearby so I know for a fact <br/>\n&gt; they didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; lead the gargoyle to us.  At the time the garg appeared, the <br/>\n&gt; necro was over<br/>\n&gt; 75% health.  In an instant, he got zapped by something and <br/>\n&gt; was killed.  He<br/>\n&gt; checked his text window to see what zapped him but couldn&#39;t find an<br/>\n&gt; explanantion.  Later on, I made a similar pull.  This time I got three<br/>\n&gt; familiars by mistake.  They all attacked me so I started to <br/>\n&gt; sing Lullaby and<br/>\n&gt; put them to sleep.  Once again, out of nowhere, three <br/>\n&gt; flouting gargoyles<br/>\n&gt; appeared right on top of us.  I was around 60% health at the <br/>\n&gt; time.  Before I<br/>\n&gt; had a chance to even start running to the zone, I got zapped <br/>\n&gt; and was knocked<br/>\n&gt; from 60% to dead in one shot.  Like the necro earlier, there <br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t any<br/>\n&gt; text messages to indicate I should have taken that much <br/>\n&gt; damage in one shot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am inclined to believe that our deaths were a result of a <br/>\n&gt; bug, which I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; told sometimes occurs in MM.  First off, the gargs spawned <br/>\n&gt; right next to the<br/>\n&gt; zone, which I am almost certain shouldn&#39;t have occured.  <br/>\n&gt; Everyone in the<br/>\n&gt; zone were in their 20s and camping around the lake.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; know where<br/>\n&gt; flouting gargoyles normally spawn, but I would assume nowhere <br/>\n&gt; near where<br/>\n&gt; everyone was pulling from (the pathway leading to the <br/>\n&gt; graveyard).  I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think of any reason how the flouting gargs got to the zone <br/>\n&gt; except due to a<br/>\n&gt; bug.  Second, the text messages did not indicate I got hit by <br/>\n&gt; a spell, which<br/>\n&gt; could have accounted for losing 60% of my health in one shot. <br/>\n&gt;  Even if I did<br/>\n&gt; get hit by a spell, the damage that familiars can do in one <br/>\n&gt; shot (usually<br/>\n&gt; with Force Shock), shouldn&#39;t be over 400 hit points.  I did <br/>\n&gt; get hit for<br/>\n&gt; physical damage by the gargs but not enough to do 400 hit <br/>\n&gt; points of health,<br/>\n&gt; which was about what I had when they appeared.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else had similar deaths in MM? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 26 bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;        Thinking about putting your business on the Web? <br/>\n&gt; MindSpring Biz has helped over 100,000 businesses get their .com.<br/>\n&gt;              Join MindSpring Biz and save $50!  <br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mindspring4\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mindspring4</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
