I<br/>\nhave books that have whole chapters about it, trying to explain it&#39;s design but not one piece has<br/>\never been found and not one conjectural recreation has ever been anything but plain stupid (overly<br/>\nheavy, lacking flexibility, the bands having no purpose but to try to make it fit the artwork).<br/>\nNote, &quot;banded&quot; is not the same as &quot;splinted&quot; which is chain reinforced with thin plates (most Indian<br/>\narmour was spinted)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when I bought my first piece of banded THEN I knew I was a fantasy game...*laughs*<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
