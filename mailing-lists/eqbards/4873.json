I subscribed to it right before I went on vacation. . . came back and had 1700 messages to read.  I&#39;m glad I decided to read them instead of delete them (although work productivity dropped significantly, but. . . oh well).  I am not sure if this is a full fledged spoiler, but since I am new to this list, I&#39;ll error on the side of caution.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    S<br/>\n    P <br/>\n    O<br/>\n    I<br/>\n    L <br/>\n    E <br/>\n    R <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    S<br/>\n    P <br/>\n    A<br/>\n    C <br/>\n    E <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I&#39;ve seen many weapons posted to drool over, but one I haven&#39;t seen mentioned is Ashenwood Short Spear.  Damage 6, delay 22, piercing, 10 charges of haste.  I&#39;m at work right now and can&#39;t remember the weight, will post it later if anyone is interested.  It&#39;s a rare drop from Drelzna in Najena.  I got mine from a friend who killed her, who then tried for a week to auction the spear but nobody was buying.  Finally he gave it to me =).  I think it is 1 point faster than the dragoon dirk, and while the dragoon dirk has the extra stats bonuses, I like the look of the spear versus the tiny dagger (and if you can afford the extra weight, put the dirk in the ranged weapon slot to get the bonuses).<br/>\n    <br/>\n    By the way, does anyone know any specifics about &#39;Haste&#39; that the some items have?  I&#39;m curious, but not enough so to waste a charge to learn.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Good travels,<br/>\n    Kassao of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
