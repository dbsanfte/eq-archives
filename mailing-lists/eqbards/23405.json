Agreed only brass instruments have <br/>\n&gt; them, that&#39;s what<br/>\n&gt; I said ;-)<br/>\n&gt; Simple woodwinds have no reeds.  The hunting horn I have <br/>\n&gt; really isn&#39;t an<br/>\n&gt; instrument at all to be honest, but it is the vibrations <br/>\n&gt; created inside the<br/>\n&gt; horn that make the sound you hear.

I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; - <br/>\n&gt; if you mean<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments <br/>\n&gt; have partials.<br/>\n&gt; Regardless, the determination of instrument types is by how <br/>\n&gt; the sound itself<br/>\n&gt; is generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips <br/>\n&gt; vibration creates<br/>\n&gt; the sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child <br/>\n&gt; - a big day<br/>\n&gt; for me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>\n&gt; Shofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>\n&gt; instrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the <br/>\n&gt; exception of the<br/>\n&gt; flute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations <br/>\n&gt; caused by the<br/>\n&gt; wind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tA saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind<br/>\n&gt; instrument.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a <br/>\n&gt; brass player - we<br/>\n&gt; are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies <br/>\n&gt; the sound.<br/>\n&gt; This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search <br/>\n&gt; of a good<br/>\n&gt; reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get <br/>\n&gt; one or two in a<br/>\n&gt; box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.
