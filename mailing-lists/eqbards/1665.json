As I&#39;ve experienced:<br/>\nIn Crushbone, a group trains Crush into the cave where a Bard is resting.<br/>\nCrush stops pounding on them, and turns to pound on the Bard, completely<br/>\nignoring everyone else.<br/>\nThis is why Bards make the best engineers ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the programming that causes this is the part where a mob checks the<br/>\nimmediate area for threats, and detects the Bard&#39;s potential threat (not<br/>\nactual threat - potential threat).  Therein lies the problem.  The Bard<br/>\n(who has mostly group-affecting songs) is seen as the greatest threat<br/>\n*regardless* of the fact that he or she is neither attacking nor even a<br/>\nmember of the party on the hate list.  This is what needs to be fixed.<br/>\nThat and the attractiveness of our instruments.  *sheesh* I know I play bad<br/>\nnotes once in a while, but still!<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWith more than 20 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n...ONElist is home to the liveliest discussions on the Internet!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
