However, there are some instances<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in non-pvp where I wish more than anything that I could just open up on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;some stupid fool who insists on being a jerk.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Enter Naluvin, Dark Elf Necro in North Ro.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Naluvin seems to find it funny to load up notorious good-race hater Dorn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;B&#39;Dynn with weapons and then has his good friend train Dorn out so he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;causes mass havok and destruction against the good races in North Ro.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Then he will NOT shut up about how cool he is for doing it in OOC.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Time to get creative.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I had noticed earlier that there was a sand giant lurking towards the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;zone to oasis and I thought to myself, &quot;Gee, I have Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and a Hand Drum, I can outrun a Sand Giant, can he?&quot;  Time to find out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Standing at max distance, I twisted the bard lull song (level 8 song,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;forget the name) which was (of course) resisted with Selo&#39;s and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;chase was on.  Using Selo&#39;s and my drum, I lead the SG right on top of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Naluvin et Voila... no more witty Dark Elf comments in OOC.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is also useful for clearing out EXCESSIVE campers of the derv camps<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in NRO and other areas, especially those who get rather vocal when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ask if you can have a kill or two.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying this unless you have a drum in hand, and if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you want to try and turn the sand giant, make sure you give him a wide<br/>\n&gt; &gt;berth.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please understand, I am not a vindictive person in anyway and I do not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;take part in kill stealing or monster healing or things like that.
