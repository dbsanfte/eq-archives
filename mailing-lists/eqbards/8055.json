I was<br/>\nhanging out at the Aviak Village a couple weeks ago.  I saw a Harrier<br/>\nperched up on top of one of the ledges.  Usually I bellow them off, but this<br/>\ntime I didn&#39;t have Bellow memmed.  Anyway, I went and stood underneath the<br/>\nledge and fired up CoD - sure enough, the Harrier got popped and jumped down<br/>\nto have a discussion with me.  I am pretty sure that his altitude relative<br/>\nto me was greater than the &quot;normal&quot; horizontal radius of CoD<br/>\n<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 28 Bard (Povar)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 2:22 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bellow and DDD/CoD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if our AE songs like DDD and CoD actually have a infinite<br/>\ncylindrical AE instead of a sphere around the singer?  For example, the<br/>\ninfinite cylindrical AE will affect anything within the radius of the<br/>\ncylinder that is in front/behind you, above you (no matter how high), and<br/>\nbelow you (no matter how low).  With a sphere, the AE would be an equal<br/>\nradius from you in all directions.  I have always been under the impression<br/>\nthat the radius of our AE sounds was a sphere.  I have also always been<br/>\nunder the impression that the effect of the z-axis bug was that mobs<br/>\nseparated from you by the ground/wall but still within the radius of the<br/>\nsphere were still affected.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone confirm this?  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Heheh I can CONFIRM that it reaches all the way to the ground from the top<br/>\n&gt; floor of the birdhouse!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the zone is hvly camped and the spawns are getting actively pulled -<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; no problems.
