I<br/>\nthink that all lull/mez type spells don&#39;t work in PvP.  Rokenn said that he<br/>\ntested the song agains a level one human warrior.  The only way that I know<br/>\nhow to do this is via PvP.  To test the song with a real situation I would<br/>\ngo to a newbie area and test pixie strike against bats or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeez almost worried about the Berserker Cresendo answer.  I think that all<br/>\nsongs should have a bit more info after they are scribed.  Know what skill<br/>\nthe song uses and wether the song is instrument only would be nice.  And<br/>\nremove the casting time info from bard songs.  Three seconds is what they<br/>\nhave always been.  Unless we get something that reduces bard casting time by<br/>\nhalf I don&#39;t really see the need to remind us that a song takes 3 seconds to<br/>\ncast.  Whoops kinda ranted like someone from EQ was actually listening<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Winu D&#39;ryden, Bard 43.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
