I swear, I have practiced<br/>\n&gt;   it for hours on end while just waiting for a rare spawn, or camping<br/>\n&gt;   some obscure item - and I have gotten it to 35, but it will not go<br/>\n&gt;   any higher.  In that same time I got my begging to 20, and my bind<br/>\n&gt;   wound to 15.

Once you get ID (and I assume Beg) over 50 it goes up fairly <br/>\nfast and is actually useful when solo&#39;ing.  When solo&#39;ing with ID I will <br/>\nstart using hitting it when the target is under 50% and I have successfully <br/>\nchained it, as it will turn and not move :) Giving you several free shots.  <br/>\nYou can practice ID on anything (corpses, players, pets, etc..)  Beg can be <br/>\npracticed on pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way I found to raise Bind Wounds (mine is maxed at 100) was to get <br/>\na backpack full of bandages and go to a crowded low-level dungeon <br/>\n(Blackburrow is great for this) and shout out free wound binding at zone.  <br/>\nAll the melee solo&#39;ist will come and help you raise your skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
