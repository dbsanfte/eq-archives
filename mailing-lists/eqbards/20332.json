We went all the way in and were having the<br/>\ntime of our lives.  None of us could believe how well we were doing without<br/>\na cleric but, point of fact, we just didn&#39;t need one.  With the Druid<br/>\nhitting everyone with pack regen and me using lute songs with Hymn up we<br/>\nwere barely getting hurt in  most fights and the few times we did get hurt<br/>\nthe paladin and druid were more than able to keep up with the dmg we were<br/>\ntaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the necro split we picked up a Wizzy and kept right on going.  Downtime<br/>\nwas minimal, if any, both Druid and Wizzy were nuking for the most part and<br/>\nI handled any crowd control needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nFun fun fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother group I never thought would make it was:<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin<br/>\nRanger<br/>\nRogue<br/>\nRogue<br/>\nBard<br/>\nShaman<br/>\n<br/>\nWe absolutely destroyed anything that got near us.  Ranger and I split<br/>\npulling duties.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
