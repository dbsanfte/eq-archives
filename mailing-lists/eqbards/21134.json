But again - I just<br/>\nturned 48 - never been on a Plane or Dragon raid.  I know nothing of Plane<br/>\nRaids: Fear, Hate, Air, Breaks or Respawns except for whets been posted on<br/>\nthis list - and the Backstage Forum.  And let&#39;s face it - there hasn&#39;t been<br/>\nmuch discussion of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had no idea WHAT to expect.  I was there to learn.  I don&#39;t recall any<br/>\ndiscussion here of how respawns work in Fear and what to expect. No one<br/>\npromised me any treasure - no one called it farming.  I was simply asked if<br/>\nI wanted to &quot;join a raid on fear&quot;.  I posted my experience and asked a<br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to participate in Breaking Fear.  It occurred at 7:30 AM my<br/>\ntime while I was sound asleep (I am a professional musician and was working<br/>\nuntil 12:30 the night before - had dinner with the guys in the band - got<br/>\nhome at 3:30).  As soon as someone invites me to break fear - I&#39;m in.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot like I can organize one myself having participated once in a respawn and<br/>\nnever been on a break...<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted what I posted to find out if this was typical; to find out what<br/>\nitems do in fact drop there and to ask how the respawn works.  I posted this<br/>\nfor all the other Bards who&#39;ve never been invited on a Fear Raid to know my<br/>\nexperience AND HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT! (I sure didn&#39;t).  No one said<br/>\nthey were farming treasure - no one promised me anything.  The only thing<br/>\nwas a general belief that things start to respawn in numbers after a good<br/>\n12-14 hours.  They organized 4 full groups expecting to need them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate the information you posted, but I found your post to be<br/>\npatronizing, sarcastic and even insulting.  It seems to me that over the<br/>\ntime, this board has been declining in tone.  I worry that we are getting to<br/>\nthe point where people are going to be afraid to post something without<br/>\nbeing jumped on.  It&#39;s not surprising the number of people who have quietly<br/>\ndisappeared from here and stopped posting.  It shouldn&#39;t be a crime to be<br/>\nwrong; and even worse - to have an opinion - and my God - asking a question?<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: jay schultze [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sartori69@...\">sartori69@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 28, 2000 6:31 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Plane of Fear<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does one go to an already broken Fear plane and not expect to be bored<br/>\noff his ass? The only time I could see this being even remotely exciting is<br/>\nif a GM showed up and re-popped the entire zone at once, which they would<br/>\nonly do if some mobs were bugged.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the other guys said, all imbrued armor is dropped in the Plane of Hate,<br/>\nunless you get lucky and see it drop on a cube in Fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want an exciting experience, try not farming Fear for once, and<br/>\ninstead breaking it open on a full pop. You might actually have a challenge<br/>\n*gasp* and fun. Instead of seeing maybe 2-3 dozen mobs in 5.5 hours, you<br/>\nwill more than likely see 2-3 dozen mobs in your first couple hours,<br/>\ndepending on how efficient your raiding party is. Not only will you kill a<br/>\nlot more in less time, but you will see more loot drop in a shorter amount<br/>\nof time. Last time I was on a Fear raid, we saw no less than 8 drops in the<br/>\nfirst hour. It reminded me of the candyland that was the original Fear plane<br/>\nopening.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I&#39;d have to say that breaking Fear on a full pop is one of the<br/>\nmost fun experiences I have ever had in EQ, next to maybe killing Trak.<br/>\nKiting dracolich around is pretty fun too. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople farming Fear and then wondering where the fun went baffle me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me of a running joke some friends have about farming Fear (if<br/>\nthis offends any of you, oh well):<br/>\nLleluvyn says, &#39;Hail there hardy adventurer, would you be interested in<br/>\n[Farming The Plane of Fear]?&#39;<br/>\nKruegen says, &#39;How do I farm the plane of fear?<br/>\nLleluvyn says, &#39;It is an easy task, done by many! Simply fetch me [a shovel]<br/>\nand [Treasure bag] and we can get started! There is a [reward]!<br/>\nKruegen says, &#39;What is the reward?&#39;<br/>\nLleluvyn says, &#39;Ah! The reward you ask? The reward is free [phat lewtz] with<br/>\nno risk other then [/random 100].<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad&lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n55th Bard, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
