When I&#39;m doing crowd control - I usually<br/>\nhope for a 2-pull and use charm.  Was in a group with a Paladin and Rogue a<br/>\ncouple of weeks ago that were pretty high level on the North Wall of Karnor.<br/>\nI replaced an enchanter - they had no probs with 3-pulls.  I tried pixie<br/>\nstrike to alternate between the two &quot;extras&quot; and tried to keep them both<br/>\nmezzed.  The resists made it useless.  The Paladin Died and the rogue and I<br/>\nzoned into Karnors (The Rogue&#39;s primary was a +49 Cleric so it was no big<br/>\nwoop).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was 44 at the time - and there&#39;s nothing above a blue (although I think it<br/>\nwas &quot;High-Blue&#39;s&quot; I was trying to mez if that makes a difference).  I WAS<br/>\nusing my Mino Horn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe (but not sure) there was no secondary resist message...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

I have used it before and gotten<br/>\nresisted quite a bit, but last night was the first time I ever saw the<br/>\nsecondary resist message like Lullaby has.  Was this added at the same time<br/>\nas Lullaby&#39;s was or later?  It was taking me 3-4 applications to get it to<br/>\nstick which made it useless for mezzing casters.  Granted I was using it on<br/>\nhigh blues and whites, but why would I want to mez a green caster that<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stand up to the group for 20 seconds anyhow???<br/>\n<br/>\nI was singing nothing but Pixie Strike against a blue necro trying to hold<br/>\nher off while the group was busy and the necro was able to keep me almost<br/>\ncontinually stunned with fear while I was only able to interrupt her once or<br/>\ntwice.  Looks like this is another song I will demem until they fix it.<br/>\nWhen fighting high blues and whites it has not worked well enough to be<br/>\nworthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLife&#39;s too short to send boring email.
