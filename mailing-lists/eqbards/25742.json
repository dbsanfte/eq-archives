Trak kills <br/>\nUDB.  20 hours from that point, if Trak is dead, the UDB will spawn <br/>\nand stay up.  If Trak dies 18 hours after server pop, the UDB will be <br/>\nup in 2 hours.  If Trak dies 21 hours after server pop, the UDB will <br/>\nbe up in 19 hours (he&#39;d already spawned and was whacked by Trak once).<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nRetired<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In eqbards@y..., &quot;Azerael Ng&#39;Ataman&quot; &lt;azerael@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; He is something akin to Ragefire, he seems to spawn several times<br/>\n&gt; between the &#39;real&#39; Trakanon.
