They are a bit higher level but its working ok.<br/>\nThen Macgrough asks if he can join and oh wow, what a great couple of hours!<br/>\nThe experience flew!  Macgrough played just instruments, I fought, we also<br/>\nhad a warrior, wizzie and 2 druids.  We had non-stop fighting and great fun!<br/>\nAll I have to say is playing with another bard is awesome - and I even<br/>\nleveled!  (Not to mention it was great to meet Mac after talking to him<br/>\nhere).  And he gave me good bard lessons and wow!  He even put up with me<br/>\nand my online sweetie being schmoopy!  Ok, well obviously I had a good time,<br/>\njust wanted to say wow! and thanks to Mac!  <br/>\n <br/>\nTani, 22nd (woo hoo!)
