Basically late last year <br/>\nVerant added a second resist to the song that makes it almost useless.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have the numbers, but apparently a level 50 bard with high Charisma <br/>\nwill have more than 40% resists on level one mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to GZ (of Verant) it&#39;s only supposed to resist at approximately <br/>\nthe same level that the enchanters mez spell (which has, what, 15% resists?) <br/>\n  They are supposedly &quot;looking into testing it&quot;, which they&#39;ve been saying <br/>\nsince March or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, are you sure you have Bard Songs showing?  They added an option to the <br/>\nclient software a month or so ago that allows people to turn off the <br/>\nmessages and &quot;fireworks&quot; that bards produce.  I&#39;m not exactly sure, but I <br/>\nthink it is located in the Options-&gt;Chat Filter or maybe General tab, on the <br/>\nsecond or third page of options (ie. use the NEXT button to go the next page <br/>\nof options).  This may be why you are not getting the &quot;a_mob_00 nods&quot; and <br/>\nresist messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps...<br/>\n<br/>\nOgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 40 Missed Notes<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  The absolute safest spot on Norrath to practice the Brass instruments <br/>\nskill is in the Arena zone in Lake Rathe.  Just make sure you play it <br/>\noutside of the PVP area so nobody kills you while you are afk.<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS:  I fell for 10000 damage today in Frontier Mountains when I got hit by <br/>\na lag pocket while playing the levitation song.

Some sort of sado-masochist?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now I&#39;m having a bit of a <br/>\n&gt;problem figuring out what to do<br/>\n&gt;with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a lot of discussion on the <br/>\n&gt;list about this song, but<br/>\n&gt;usually in relation to levels far above mine.  I&#39;ve been meaning to write <br/>\n&gt;this since I got the darn song,<br/>\n&gt;because I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>\n&gt;...<br/>\n&gt;Then I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament was when I first got it <br/>\n&gt;because I can&#39;t see when it<br/>\n&gt;&quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden surrounded.  I pick a small group <br/>\n&gt;of blues.  Run up and turn on<br/>\n&gt;Lullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot; message.  <br/>\n&gt;Then they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>\n&gt;me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong or if this song just <br/>\n&gt;really sucks that bad?  Should I<br/>\n&gt;wait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use it?  But then I thought <br/>\n&gt;I recalled from previous<br/>\n&gt;discussion that it&#39;s completely useless after level 24? or 27?  So why <br/>\n&gt;bother for just a few levels of<br/>\n&gt;use?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for any advice.<br/>\n&gt;Lyressa - level 17<br/>\n&gt;Nameless<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to have to give him a piece <br/>\n&gt;of my mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>\n&gt;soundly on the butt.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
