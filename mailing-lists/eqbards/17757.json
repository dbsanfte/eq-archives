Thanks so much! Yep Tyunes, that&#39;s the<br/>\nidea...losing is something I sort of expect with him being the level he is,<br/>\nbut I want to at least put a hurtin&#39; on him! I will have to check to make sure<br/>\nI can leave the board, that would be soooo funny! Everyone would be like where<br/>\ndid she go? And I do have a friend I can borrow claws from :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMelodii<br/>\n<br/>\nBill Costlow &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Heh, I can see it now: &quot;The bard is cheating!&quot;  Just<br/>\n&gt; remember, running like the gingerbread man is what we<br/>\n&gt; do best;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is a goblin Camp North of the chessboard.  A<br/>\n&gt; 15th lvl pet will kill them in no time but they should<br/>\n&gt; keep the pet occupied long enough for you to go back<br/>\n&gt; and melee the mage a bit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...and borrow a thulian claw or something really fast<br/>\n&gt; from the genius who matched you up with a con-red<br/>\n&gt; opponent. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d also work overtime to make 12th lvl, which you can<br/>\n&gt; easily do at the chessboard, but a quick place is the<br/>\n&gt; Derv Camp in West Commons...you might even make 13 by<br/>\n&gt; then.  You are still at a disadvantage but at least<br/>\n&gt; you would have bellow as an extra tool.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And if the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pet roots you...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the pet roots you and you are singing Selo&#39;s you<br/>\n&gt; can usually break root the next round...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; good luck...even if you don&#39;t win, make sure your<br/>\n&gt; opponent knows he was in a fight!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Send online invitations with Yahoo!
