Rangers are NOT<br/>\nprimary tanks.  Rangers are 2ndary and as such they should ALWAYS watch<br/>\nEVERYONE (including the bard) because they&#39;re the next best tank in the<br/>\ngroup (unless there is an SK or Pally)<br/>\n<br/>\nSnare isn&#39;t quite as easy as you think unless you just don&#39;t bother snaring<br/>\nevery critter.  Its not easy to pop-target 6 mobs to make sure they&#39;re<br/>\nsnared then get back on the right one.  Trust me there is a LOT of button<br/>\npushing if you&#39;re a GOOD ranger, just like there is if you&#39;re a GOOD bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe and the bard I run with (when I&#39;m not playing my bard) have a blast.  I<br/>\npop-snare an entire room while they beat on me and he sings Largo&#39;s then he<br/>\nAE fear&#39;s while AE dotting I beat up one at a time and we rake in XP hand<br/>\nover fist.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t agree but obviously you have a different style with<br/>\nyour warrior than I do with my ranger.  As a Ranger I see it as my job to<br/>\nmake sure every un-engaged mob stays OFF every other party member and is<br/>\neither rooted, snared or otherwise occupied so that the casters can do their<br/>\njobs without being killed (and a bard, in this case, is considred a caster<br/>\nby me).<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line:<br/>\nBards have to time their button presses, others don&#39;t.  That does not mean a<br/>\nbard is pushing more buttons.  And if your bard is pounding Sense heading<br/>\nduring combat then he&#39;s a fool.  The ranger CAN do it without reducing his<br/>\noverall effectiveness, so he does.  In fact I&#39;ll sometimes even pop tracking<br/>\njust to see what&#39;s around.  A bard can&#39;t do that while trying to twist 3<br/>\nsongs because of timing.  Does that mean a bard is hitting more buttons?<br/>\nNope, just means they have to time their button presses.  I don&#39;t so I tend<br/>\nto pound buttons non-stop as a ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatter of fact, I would say that when playing my ranger my fingers never<br/>\nstop moving unless we&#39;re resting between fights.   Even then I&#39;m hitting<br/>\ntrack now and then to see if a named has popped.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Big Daddy Legba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 05, 2000 1:06 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] getting new friends<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sense Heading:  That goes for any character, not just rangers...  Perhaps<br/>\n&gt; bard have a slightly higher int which would help a small amount.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Make sure you have the correct target?  What class doesn&#39;t have to do<br/>\nthat?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Snare:  Not exactly tough to do, when you get the snare breaks message,<br/>\ncast<br/>\n&gt; it again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hit Kick: Yup<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Taunt: Why would you hit taunt all the time?  It only works when the<br/>\nmonster<br/>\n&gt; is on someone else.  And again when it light up you hit it.  Very easy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep an eye on casters:  I do this more as a bard than my roomate does as<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; warrior.  Why?  because he&#39;s the tank, I want to stay on the main monster,<br/>\n&gt; let the extra mellees help the casters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No offense taken, but I can&#39;t disagree more with what you said.  My first<br/>\n&gt; char was a warrior, who is the exact same thing, minus the snare...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hit Sense heading constantly to max skill<br/>\n&gt; Make sure you have correct target<br/>\n&gt; Make sure target stays snared (esp painful if there&#39;s a magician in the<br/>\ngrou<br/>\n&gt; **curses all magicians and their stupid earth pets**)<br/>\n&gt; Hit Kick when button recycles<br/>\n&gt; Hit Taunt whenever button recycles (unless there is a warrior in the<br/>\ngroup)<br/>\n&gt; Keep an eye on the casters to make sure nothing jumps them.  If it does,<br/>\nrun<br/>\n&gt; over, taunt it away and stick-root it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No offense guys.  I&#39;ve played 3 bards over 20th level (beta, test and<br/>\n&gt; release server) (Beta to 30, Test to 51, Release server to 46) and, yes,<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; have a lot of button pushing to do.
