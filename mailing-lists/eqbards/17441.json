Andi... Faesong.. [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:princess@...\">princess@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 06, 2000 2:00 PM<br/>\nTo: Eqbards<br/>\nSubject: Lullaby tale<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a use for Lullaby that only desperate circumstances suggested to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 16 bard was fighting with a 15 druid in East Karana, where it opens up<br/>\nfrom the Gorge zone entrance. I was pulling and tanking. She was blasting<br/>\nand healing. :) (I did warn her if she got something stuck on her I couldn&#39;t<br/>\ntaunt it off. We seemed to do a good job of balancing damage though so that<br/>\nnever really became a problem.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had, on my first panel,<br/>\n1 Anthem     2 Chords<br/>\n3 Purifying  4 Bellow<br/>\n5 Heal       6 Assist<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the second panel<br/>\n1 Selo&#39;s     2 Heal<br/>\n3 Jig        4 Bellow<br/>\n5 Inc social 6 Shurikens (more damage/range than throwing daggers)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had Lullaby memmed in the eight song slot, but not in any of<br/>\nmy hot key panels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, We had a lion patriarch come up and chew on our backsides<br/>\nwhile we were taking out a gorge hound. Or rather, chew on MY backside.<br/>\nI took the gorge hound out at 2 bubbles and a bit of health. Turned<br/>\nto engage the lion, praying my groupmate was sending a heal my way,<br/>\nwhen I saw the yellow text: Krilled went Linkdead.<br/>\n<br/>\nUm. I threw up Selo&#39;s and headed for zone. :) But the lion kept hitting<br/>\nme from behind and stunning me. My life was down to 1 bubble -- FAR into<br/>\nthe &quot;slow you down even running fast&quot; category.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to try the song that doesn&#39;t work. Click on Lullaby. A tick later<br/>\n&quot;a lion patriarch&#39;s head nods&quot; Great! Click on Selo&#39;s, run for zone. It<br/>\nallowed<br/>\nme to get far enough ahead the lion did not catch up again until I was one<br/>\nstep<br/>\nfrom zone. And then I just went ahead and stepped into the zone.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
