We found a <br/>\n&gt; bug with the way &quot;haste&quot; items stack with &quot;haste&quot; spells. <br/>\n&gt; Basically, even <br/>\n&gt; the worst haste item combined with the worst haste spell <br/>\n&gt; would put the <br/>\n&gt; wearer at the haste cap. This basically invalidated the <br/>\n&gt; better haste items <br/>\n&gt; and spells, and explains why people have been saying that the <br/>\n&gt; newer haste <br/>\n&gt; items aren&#39;t any better than the FBSS.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is being fixed in tomorrow&#39;s patch. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
