The next<br/>\ndeath at 31 dropped him from two full bubbles down to just a sliver over one<br/>\nbubble.  It was definitely more than the visual lost xp when he dropped to<br/>\n30th by at least double.  Could be some distortion from the end of bar<br/>\ndecorations, but wouldn&#39;t think it was that much.    It definitely appeared<br/>\nthat he lost at least twice as much visible bubble space in pixels when he<br/>\ndropped from 2 bubbles and didn&#39;t lose any 30th level xp as it did when part<br/>\nof the xp loss came out of 30th.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 03, 2000 3:22 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Question about experience penalty (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 3 Jan 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wow, that&#39;s exactly the opposite of what we saw.

What you describe is exactly what I saw.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was barely 31 and lost about a quarter bubble into 30 (I&#39;ll<br/>\nassume he lost less than me due to class/race differences).  <br/>\nThat tells you a level 31 death costs (for him) a bit more<br/>\nthan quarter of a level 30 bubble.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he died &quot;barely&quot; 30, he lost almost nothing into 29.  <br/>\nThat tell syou a level 30 death costs (for him) so little of a<br/>\nlevel 30 bubble that he considered himself &quot;barely&quot; into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, a level 31 death costs (for him) a quarter level 30<br/>\nbubble, while a level 30 death costs a smidgeon of a level 30<br/>\nbubble.  So a level 31 death takes away more exp than a level<br/>\n30 death, just like I saw.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
