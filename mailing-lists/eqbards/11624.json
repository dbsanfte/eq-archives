The zone was camped and I couldn&#39;t find ONE giant, much less<br/>\n&gt; two.<br/>\n&gt; I /auc&#39;d for a stone and some jackass wanted 100pp.  I said &quot;Hey guy, I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; buy one from the INN in Rathe Mts., a 60 second run, for 48pp.&quot;  He called<br/>\n&gt; me a liar of course, so I ran to the Inn and bought it for 48pp. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
