Maybe <br/>\nyou meant to say &quot;I have never used concord once; it is useless to <br/>\nme&quot; or &quot;I find concord to be a very limited song&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many songs may require &quot;non-standard&quot; situations before they <br/>\nbecome of value. Let me tell you a tale of what happened this <br/>\nweekend. My guild was preparing to raid the Char nobility, and while <br/>\npeople were on their way, some of us started hunting the zone out. <br/>\nOne one pull, our monk got &quot;zapped off the bridge&quot; by a caster, and <br/>\nsaid he was stuck on a ledge. I decided to use another, often <br/>\nworthless, song -- Solidarity of Vision. I targeted the monk, checked <br/>\nout where he was located, moved to the other MOBs in the area to see <br/>\nexact what the situarion was, directed our warrior as to what MOBs <br/>\nneeded pulling, waited for the others to leave, then went in and used <br/>\nlevitate to get the monk out. There may have been other ways to <br/>\nhandle the situation, but I found a pretty simple solution in <br/>\na &quot;worthless song&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I agree that this song is of very &quot;limited&quot; use, but I would <br/>\nrather say I have thought of no good use for it instead of &quot;it is <br/>\nuseless&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
