Who has time to check what time it is in Norrath everytime they want<br/>\nto use a song? And its not even like the frickan songs are all that usefull<br/>\nanyways.

His talk says that he got it from a bard,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that the helm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is only usable by bards, and that the bard said it came from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sebilis where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all of the class helms are coming from that I know of.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the quest for the cake turns out to be quite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; elaborate and time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consuming then I can see Verant putting this as the reward.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Old school buds here:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/10/_/451022/_/961028829/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/10/_/451022/_/961028829/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
