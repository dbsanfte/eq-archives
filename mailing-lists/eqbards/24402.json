I&#39;ve been in the Warlord all<br/>\nof two times and the hand was camped seperately, but at peak hours with<br/>\n60+ peeps in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, hope to meet up on one of the XA raids. And thanks for the advice.<br/>\nProb need to get back to SS where I won the roll on my Sentry BP.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Icewell, I&#39;m already KOS in SS and Kael. Think there&#39;s any<br/>\npossibility of looting a Bard only No Drop in Icewell without killing and<br/>\ntaking the faction hit? I&#39;m no familiar with the zone (i.e. getting out)<br/>\nor the drops.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only Bard I&#39;ve seen so far with the Melodic BP got it in a free loot<br/>\nfrom a group in POG with no Bard. Talk about being in the right place at<br/>\nthe right time!<br/>\n<br/>\nTzeetch<br/>\nMinistel on Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
