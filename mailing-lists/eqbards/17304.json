With FBSS you&#39;ll get the same results with all your tests<br/>\nas you did with the BoC. The belt has no &quot;special&quot; ability which puts you at 75%. There is a CAP on weapon<br/>\nspeed. It is roughly 55% of the original weapon speed. Meaning if you stack just about *any* attack speed<br/>\nbuff on a FBSS, BoC, Swirlspine, CoF, RBB, etc it will always cap out at that 55% of the original weapon<br/>\nspeed.<br/>\nNot sure if you noticed, or if its even practiced on your server, but enchanters no long use swift like<br/>\nthe wind for this reason. Its just a bigger waste of mana, so they use Augment instead. Its a lower level<br/>\nspell, costs less mana, adds less speed than SLTW, adds AGI and AC.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how you came to the calculation of 75% speedup. You have listed that all the delays are<br/>\ncapped at 20 with Item + Bard songs. (Also note monks were complaining of having this delay cap on them,<br/>\nthus innate monk haste went in soon after).<br/>\n20 (maximum HTH delay)/36 (original delay) = 0.55, 55%.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I got this belt this weekend in PoA.

The initial<br/>\n&gt; timings were really strange (giving me better-than-Swift<br/>\n&gt; speed), so I timed it again this morning.

Some people were<br/>\n&gt; complaining that this plane of Air item only had the same 15%<br/>\n&gt; speedup as the other haste items available from &quot;mundane&quot;<br/>\n&gt; creatures (Frenzied, Swirlspine guardian).  I think to make<br/>\n&gt; the belt special, Verant made it so combining it with any<br/>\n&gt; other haste put you at 75% speedup (which may be max).<br/>\n&gt; Combined with *any* bard speedup, it puts me at 75% speedup.<br/>\n&gt; My hunch is it&#39;ll do the same combined with any enchanter<br/>\n&gt; speedup, including augmentation.  I don&#39;t believe the FBSS and<br/>\n&gt; Swirlspine belt work like this, as the timings I&#39;ve seen for<br/>\n&gt; those just added 15%ish speedup to the song.  (Wanna lend me<br/>\n&gt; yours so I can test it, Rokenn?  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My six-note and Waki swing really really fast with 75% haste.<br/>\n&gt; :)  It&#39;s a real killer on my stamina though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
