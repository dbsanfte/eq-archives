I think that the general populace is probably pretty <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ignorant about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what abilities bards do and do not have.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Halana, 59th Shaman<br/>\n&gt; Tani, 45th Bard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You hit it right on the head Tani.  How many times do you hear people <br/>\nsay, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know bards could do that!&quot;  I don&#39;t know about you <br/>\nall, but I hear that quite a bit.  And it doesn&#39;t surprise me that <br/>\nusually, those are the people that say play mana song during the <br/>\nfights!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich reminds me of a recent mana song story of mine... I was playing <br/>\nwith a guild that we have an alliance with in Sebilis.  We did <br/>\nSebilis all weekend with pretty much the same group of people.  Some <br/>\nrotated, but all were in the same guild.  One night, we had 2-3 <br/>\nclerics in the group at a given time.  One in particular was telling <br/>\nme to keep playing mana song when he would go OOM.  Now, I don&#39;t know <br/>\nabout you guys, but when I have more than one cleric in the group <br/>\nwith one OOM and 2 frogs on us, I&#39;m not going to stop singing just <br/>\nfor mana song.  So he keeps going on about it and I just ignore him, <br/>\nthen finally he says it in caps.  I immediatley say &quot;CHILL OUT!  I&#39;M <br/>\nSINGING WHAT I SHOULD BE!&quot;  I usually tell them to not worry about <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m singing and I won&#39;t tell them how to play.  That usually <br/>\nshuts them up ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second day, the group decided that the 56 wiz would do better <br/>\ncrowd control with root than I could do.  So, I agree to try it <br/>\nbecause I have never been to the Gang beetle room so don&#39;t know what <br/>\nto expect.  Well, needless to say, we failed that more than once <br/>\nbefore I could explain that I could do a way better job after <br/>\nnoticing they are all blues.  After the weekend, I reflected back and <br/>\nrealized that their guild no longer has a bard in it!  Rokenn was <br/>\ntheir only high level bard until he switched servers!  It seemed to <br/>\nme that they thought bards were only good for buffing resists and <br/>\nmana.  Hey Rokenn!  You should&#39;ve done a better job at teaching those <br/>\nfolks what we are all about, lol!  ;)  JK Rok. I guess I get the fun <br/>\ntask of teaching them.  Or maybe Rokenn tried and they are just <br/>\nhopeless, lol!  No, they are a great guild, but they just don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand a bard&#39;s power... just as Tani said.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Beatdrop Battledrum<br/>\n51st Minstrel of the Karana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
