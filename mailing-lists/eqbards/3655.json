Or any of the other slow the mob<br/>\ndown songs like Melodic Binding.  The difference from Druid, Cleric and<br/>\nShaman spells is the fact that most people fail to see that you are<br/>\nactually helping them.  Do they notice the mob is bound by strands of<br/>\nmusic?  Not really, but it is still gratifying to do the deed.  Who know<br/>\nif they noticed, who knows if they will ever help you?  Instant<br/>\ngratification isn&#39;t there , but you never know where kindness can come<br/>\nfrom =).<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver 21st Chorus Bard of Kelethin<br/>\nAariel 5th Circle Mage of Kelethin<br/>\nHonour Guard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, 15 May 1999, SteelWolf wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwlf@...\">steelwlf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Use bellow without making an attempt to melee the monster at all, and only once<br/>\n&gt; the person fighting it has it around half life.
