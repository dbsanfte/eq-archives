I use a minotaur horn all the time.  I never really<br/>\nhad to spefically practice my wind skill.  When I got invisibility, I<br/>\nended<br/>\nup using it so much, that it goes up to max each level on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tip, if you&#39;re in a train prone zone, like Mistmoore for example, and<br/>\nyou&#39;re in a group that has mana dumpers.  When the party is done being<br/>\nhealed up with Hymn, kick in group invisibility.  It&#39;s saved my party and<br/>\nmy own life on numerous occasions.  Of course, this only applies between<br/>\nlevels 19 and 31.  (Not that I would know about the latter level...)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni the 26th level bard on E&#39;ci.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
