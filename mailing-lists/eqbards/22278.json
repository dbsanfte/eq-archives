I went with an instrument combo all<br/>\nevening, and some of the group commented that their resist rates against NPC<br/>\nspells were higher than normal for a Hate raid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also took care of all curing for my party, which allowed our cleric to<br/>\nkeep more useful spells memmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was just a &quot;fun&quot; raid, and we cleared the entire zone except for those<br/>\nareas around Maestro and Inny (who were both up, but our pull team had 3<br/>\nmembers who had to work today and wanted to get to bed).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast but not least is the fact that my party only got exp on 10 or so kills,<br/>\nbut I made almost 3&#92;4 of a bubble of exp!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon of Bertox, 48th composition, Defenders of Aleria</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
