I am new to the roleplaying games<br/>\nand find it to be enthrolling and addictive!  I also<br/>\nfind it to be overwhelming at times, if you don&#39;t know<br/>\nanyone and don&#39;t know any of the commands.  Sineras,<br/>\nuntil you mentioned that there is a location command,<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have a clue...just remember there are people<br/>\nout there that don&#39;t know and don&#39;t know how to find<br/>\nout...and find out by luck alone or nice bards who<br/>\noffer advice!!!<br/>\n ;-) Andriah<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kyle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tNumber of questions made that I&#39;ll just sum up in<br/>\n&gt; this one message.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.\tWhere is Kelin&#39; Lugubrious Lament?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKelethin Bard&#39;s Guild. Bout 4 plat, 6 gold.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2.\tWhat does it do?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tLowers a creature&#39;s reaction to you (won&#39;t attack<br/>\n&gt; you) for a short while.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t try to get a screenshot of yourself standing<br/>\n&gt; next to the creature<br/>\n&gt; though. =) I think help is the thing that makes them<br/>\n&gt; come after you if you<br/>\n&gt; attack one of their buddies. (Orc camps are prime<br/>\n&gt; examples). Agro<br/>\n&gt; (arressiveness) would prolly be what makes it decide<br/>\n&gt; to attack you for<br/>\n&gt; simply invading its personal space. It does seem to<br/>\n&gt; wear off after a short<br/>\n&gt; while. And I think the skill needed is singing so no<br/>\n&gt; instrument.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.\tDoes Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord work yet?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tThe damage part of it works, can&#39;t tell about the<br/>\n&gt; AC penalty though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4.\tHymn of Restoration in combat?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI almost always play it unless I know I can easily<br/>\n&gt; defeat the creature I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; fighting against. Even though you only get a few hps<br/>\n&gt; back a tick, it will be<br/>\n&gt; significant during a long battle. Many a times have<br/>\n&gt; I been victorious<br/>\n&gt; because of those extra hps I healed during the<br/>\n&gt; fight. This song seems to do<br/>\n&gt; an extra 2hps for every 6 levels gained after 6th.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5.\tSame post mentioned about running and bellowing a<br/>\n&gt; wisp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tHeh, how about that. This song seems to do an extra<br/>\n&gt; 1 damage for every 2<br/>\n&gt; levels gained after 12th.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 6.\tA post about experience percentages.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tThe only thing I can attribute is that the level<br/>\n&gt; window for exp in a group<br/>\n&gt; might not be as it is written (which I&#39;ve seen<br/>\n&gt; written to be 4 levels<br/>\n&gt; wide)...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 7.\tOn a matter of starting a bard and what<br/>\n&gt; attributes should be picked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tIn beta I jacked my charisma and got fairly good<br/>\n&gt; prices as the most<br/>\n&gt; immediate benefit. For final I put enough into<br/>\n&gt; strength to wear plate and<br/>\n&gt; everything else into dexterity so that my chance to<br/>\n&gt; hit is greater. I seem<br/>\n&gt; to be fairly adept at hitting near or at the top<br/>\n&gt; range of the damage scale<br/>\n&gt; so I don&#39;t know if any more strength will help in<br/>\n&gt; combat. I do seem to be<br/>\n&gt; hitting more then in beta with the better dex,<br/>\n&gt; though. Only drop into<br/>\n&gt; intelligence if you *really* want your skills to<br/>\n&gt; rocket. It has no effect on<br/>\n&gt; songs since we don&#39;t use mana. I prolly wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even consider it really.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 8.\tQuests in Kelethin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAlmost all quests I&#39;ve seen can be done as many<br/>\n&gt; times as you want. The game<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t really seem to keep track of state other<br/>\n&gt; then any item you might be<br/>\n&gt; given, which would key the next part of the quest<br/>\n&gt; when you give it to the<br/>\n&gt; correct person. I&#39;ve seen newbie bards make the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;watch report&#39; run to the<br/>\n&gt; docks in Queynos over and over again to get 2nd<br/>\n&gt; level without fighting a<br/>\n&gt; thing. It&#39;s not often you&#39;ll find a quest that will<br/>\n&gt; give more money that<br/>\n&gt; what is required to buy the things neccessary to<br/>\n&gt; complete it. Good example<br/>\n&gt; are the Deathfist Slashed Belts that cost about 3<br/>\n&gt; gold in stores but you get<br/>\n&gt; maybe 7 copper back when you hand them in to the<br/>\n&gt; quest person. Course you<br/>\n&gt; get a good faction adjustment....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 9.\tCharging fees for corpse hunting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tChances are good that if they forgot to do a /loc<br/>\n&gt; before dying they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know how much they might have on them in terms of<br/>\n&gt; money so they won&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; if they can pay you until you get there. Usually the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;accept any donations&#39;<br/>\n&gt; thing works well unless they are real knobs, in<br/>\n&gt; which case you can lead them<br/>\n&gt; into some nasty spot, drop them from the group, turn<br/>\n&gt; on speed, and burn<br/>\n&gt; outta there leaving them behind. =) jk Seriously, if<br/>\n&gt; they lost a character<br/>\n&gt; before, they&#39;ll reward you well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tGood Journey,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tSineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest<br/>\n&gt; lists on the Internet?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Our scaleable system is the most reliable free<br/>\n&gt; e-mail service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
