But you need to keep in mind, you are but a small<br/>\n  piece of the puzzle in the big picture.  While most people only <br/>\n  know people on their server, I have the privledge of speaking with<br/>\n  many people (including their tactics) on several other servers.<br/>\n  I build my tactics from other proven tactics.  And sure... bards<br/>\n  want to sound useful, so we say we can bring your resistances up<br/>\n  through the roof.  But I&#39;ve noticed that high resists don&#39;t always<br/>\n  cut damage factors.  I&#39;ve noticed that since day one.  With eq and<br/>\n  spell buffs, you can bring your cold resist to the 120&#39;s - 150&#39;s<br/>\n  for Vox.  Someone said that 125 doesn&#39;t have any impact, but 225<br/>\n  does.  heh.  It&#39;s my opinion, as I have seen with every single other<br/>\n  mob in this game that regardless of resistance, you are gonna be<br/>\n  lucky and unlucky at times on damage.  Hell, ice goblin wizards<br/>\n  can still cast their stupid shock spells on me for almost<br/>\n  full dmg, despite the fact I play mystic shielding.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not downplaying resistances, but there is some luck factor<br/>\n  involved which skews everything at times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  LoD had one bard (blue to me, poorly equiped) Sagnaria (sp) and<br/>\n  Weadeneye... that was it.  And your crew had their plane gear on<br/>\n  from what I saw, no special cold resist stuff, yet you still <br/>\n  clobbered Vox swiftly.  Level/experience is clearly better than<br/>\n  resistances.  Hell, you all were doing dragons without bards at<br/>\n  one point.  And you still won easily.  (Gotta be the rogues ;p)<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Harm.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
