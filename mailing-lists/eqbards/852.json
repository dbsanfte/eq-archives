I was under the impression that it is way heavier than regular<br/>\n&gt;plate.

At level 18 you<br/>\n&gt;| can solo the whole place, but still get exp from captains, commanders,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt;| the high shamans. Snakeskin armor and the sought after runed totem staff<br/>\n&gt;| are your rewards. I bring back 100 plat worth of loot on every trip. And<br/>\n&gt;on<br/>\n&gt;| Fenin Ro the zone goes neglected. I have never seen it with more than 20<br/>\n&gt;| people, and very often I am the only one there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would agree that Paws is underpopulated in most servers (Cazic averages<br/>\n&gt;10-15 in evenings) and the loot is quite decent although 100 plat might be<br/>\n&gt;high unless you sell the staves at a high price.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Soloing *all* of it at level 18 I can&#39;t quite agree with. Ghanex Drah can<br/>\n&gt;bring some tense moments at times and Zixx Nenixx will simply smoke your<br/>\n@#$<br/>\n&gt;all the way back to the zoneline.
