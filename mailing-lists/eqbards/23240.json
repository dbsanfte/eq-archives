Of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2076682910\">In groups where I didn&#39;t have to melee, I used to turn away from the action,<br/>\nand just keep a real close eye on the chat window, while twisting my songs.<br/>\nOf course, this didn&#39;t work so well the one time I was backstabbed for my<br/>\nefforts...heh.  I don&#39;t do that anymore, since I did miss an add once, with<br/>\nruinous consequences, so I have learned to twist even when it is laggy,<br/>\nstanding in the middle of everything.  This effectively eliminates any hopes<br/>\nof a 4 song twist, but I can usually keep 3 going, with a bit of effort.  My<br/>\ngroupmates often wonder why I don&#39;t talk to them during a fight...heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never bothered to twist instruments.  If I don&#39;t need weapons, I equip<br/>\nthe instrument for whichever song I want to have the highest effect.<br/>\nNormally, for tank groups, anthem, purifying, and guarding with drums<br/>\nequipped, dropping the rythyms and doing anthem/chains when mob is about to<br/>\nrun, switching to heal and lute during downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI normally stay in the first person view.  Does moving to a third person<br/>\nrelieve some of the video lag in the first person view?  Never tried it, and<br/>\nI won&#39;t get any play time until tomorrow :( night to experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 17, 2001 12:51 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Detail level - Low ...?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthey have mentioned they were going to fix this, but never have.  low, med,<br/>\nhigh look the same to me.  they need to let you see epic weapons no matter<br/>\nwhat your density, or have a separate setting for them, and they need to<br/>\nmake the settings actually mean something, since they all look the same.  i<br/>\ndon&#39;t see how a bard can play with particles on, which is unfortunate.  i<br/>\nwould love to play in a low setting if it really meant low.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I personally love the particle effects and I never play with <br/>\n&gt; out them.  I<br/>\n&gt; always kept the density set to low ...but the sparkles look <br/>\n&gt; the same to me<br/>\n&gt; on low, med and high.  Is it just me?  I hit 39 last night <br/>\n&gt; and the particle<br/>\n&gt; effects are killing me.  I don&#39;t want to turn them off but I <br/>\n&gt; am not seeing<br/>\n&gt; a choice here.  Any suggestions?  I play in the &quot;out of body&quot; <br/>\n&gt; views already.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Steve<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
