I am a level 17 bard, and just recently <br/>\n&gt;acquired this song.  I equipped my flute, and tried to play it.  I got the <br/>\n&gt;following message:  Learn to sing it before you play it.  I proceeded to <br/>\n&gt;try and sing it, and could never get it going.  Nothing but one missed note <br/>\n&gt;after the other.  Is this common?  Am I doing something wrong?  Also, do I <br/>\n&gt;need a mouthpiece for my flute?  I bought the flute from the Bard&#39;s Guild, <br/>\n&gt;and eqipped it as usual before I tried the song.  Any help at all would be <br/>\n&gt;greatly appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kirree<br/>\n&gt;Xegony Server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
