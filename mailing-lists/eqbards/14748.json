Lullaby was awesome when I used it, oh about<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  30 levels ago.  I can&#39;t even keep 3 snakes asleep now.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hrm... Interesting. Maybe you have something here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m just grumpy that&#39;s all, I loved the tactics I got to employ<br/>\n&gt;   during my 20s, and even low 30s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   What happens is our so/so melee and so/so magic don&#39;t strike<br/>\n&gt;   with the force they used to when we were little.  Verant puts<br/>\n&gt;   magic resistances on things through the roof to prevent chain<br/>\n&gt;   IC wizards and makes the mobs melee skills so incredibly high<br/>\n&gt;   that they can decimate a warrior in a few rounds.  When you<br/>\n&gt;   toss in a bard, who excels at neither melee nor magic, the<br/>\n&gt;   bard truly becomes a speed/mana support class.  Since his other<br/>\n&gt;   magic doesn&#39;t have the effectiveness it used to and his melee<br/>\n&gt;   coupled with low hp and mediocre ac usually gets him killed<br/>\n&gt;   in toe to toe combat, Verant ends up just dishing out frustration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Speaking from the L50 perspective, you will be playing Victory<br/>\n&gt;   and Clarit and most likely nothing else.  You may need to Chains<br/>\n&gt;   something once in a while, you may need to AE fear things.  You<br/>\n&gt;   won&#39;t be using any other AE songs, including Lullaby.  You won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;   healing anyone anymore.  I use my Solidarity of Vision more than<br/>\n&gt;   Hymm nowadays.  Dirge, yeah that&#39;s laughable.  Charm, we all<br/>\n&gt;   know it&#39;s limitation.  Pixie Strike is good once in a while,<br/>\n&gt;   but not against anything in the Planes (for all purposes).  The L50<br/>\n&gt;   perspective also isn&#39;t fighting tower froggies or dogs in SolB, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   in the Planes or against a Dragon, at that point you will feel your<br/>\n&gt;   true worth. (or lack there of)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;d like to say there&#39;s something cool at L50 we do, and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;   racked my mind for hours trying to figure it out.  It&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt;   so hard to find something other than Victory/Clarit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
