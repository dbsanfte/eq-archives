He was surprised that it actually worked because he was under the<br/>\nimpression that it wouldn&#39;t.  He tried it anyway and was able to escape.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still skeptical until I do it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Although Selo&#39;s does not break root anymore I thought<br/>\n&gt; we had determined that it would on the next pulse if<br/>\n&gt; you were playing it before being rooted.  Well, last<br/>\n&gt; night in Mistmoore this did not appear to be the case.<br/>\n&gt;  I was running around when I was rooted by<br/>\n&gt; something--maybe dark offerer or whatever.  Anyway<br/>\n&gt; Selo&#39;s was on and did NOT break root.  It is possible<br/>\n&gt; that I got rooted and stunned which killed my song<br/>\n&gt; before the next pulse.  I got out of the root and was<br/>\n&gt; blasted about 2 jumps from the zone. Arghhh.  Anyway,<br/>\n&gt; can anyone verify the root thing?  I&#39;ll try to<br/>\n&gt; experiment with a rooter tonight.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
