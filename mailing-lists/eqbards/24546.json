We saw ya&#39;ll coming in to HS about the time we weremaking our<br/>\nlast round. Started going all the way through North then going through West<br/>\nonce we got the key and then back to North, etc. It was less boring than<br/>\nsitting in either spot. We were on our last round when the ogre fell into<br/>\nthe hole that he&#39;d carefully avoided the last 2 cycles. I think it was a<br/>\nplot against me as the Procurator was finally up and we had just enough time<br/>\nto get to him, until the ogre forgot about the rug.<br/>\nI had put my foot down about no raids all weekend so I could get to 56.<br/>\nLogged on Friday and everyone is screaming for help to do Trak again so we<br/>\nwent along. Bard bp dropped and I won the lotto. After that we rounded up<br/>\nsome exp minded folks and entertained Darkfox in HS. Our wiz put succor in<br/>\nhis harvest spell spot and accidently ported us to zonein twice.
