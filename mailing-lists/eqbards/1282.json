I am a level 25 Bard on the Rallos Zek<br/>\nserver.  I have read with interest your emails, suggestions, and tips, but I<br/>\nseem to have a problem.

This is a<br/>\nreal disadvantage to me I believe.  Anyone on RZ with any suggestions? Or<br/>\nanyone else ?  Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInfiniti<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
