Those who are simply missing the music<br/>\n*may* have a sound-card conflict, but more likely, you simply have music<br/>\ndisabled. (I remember reading somewhere that it starts disabled.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember if mine was, I always go through and tweak everything, anyway).<br/>\nCheck under &quot;options&quot; after you have the game started.  There is a button<br/>\nfor sound, and under sound, there are various sliders for controlling sound<br/>\nand music levels.<br/>\nIMHO ambient music is one of the things that makes EQ so engrossing.  Some<br/>\nof the music really pulls you in, like the sound of Crushbone or the music<br/>\nfor Kelethin.  The music on the ship is pretty goofy, but it does have the<br/>\nadvantage of being very appropriate for a sea-faring jig.  Is music<br/>\nnecessary? No - but it sure makes it more fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
