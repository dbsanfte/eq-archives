However, I apologize for the seemingly lack of <br/>\n  respect, but you&#39;ve got to realize I&#39;ve played this game <br/>\n  as a bard longer than you have -- and I hear all the L20 bards<br/>\n  complaining because the Lambent quests are too hard.  The fact <br/>\n  that they think they should get Lambent because they are something<br/>\n  special, irritates me.  I worked really hard for my armor.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  My point was I wish all bards had to work for their armor, cause<br/>\n  it doesn&#39;t get any better until level 46.  I dont whine that I<br/>\n  cannot get the Plane armor yet, so I&#39;m working as hard as I<br/>\n  can to become of level to travel and earn it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Plus, I never called you a twink.  You put those words in my mouth<br/>\n  Mr. Level 22 Bard hehe.  So what does a L22 bard wear nowadays?<br/>\n<br/>\n  You posted to this list looking for advice, and I gave it to you.<br/>\n  I&#39;m sorry it wasn&#39;t what you wanted to hear.  If you want Lambent<br/>\n  armor, you need to take some risks and quest for it, or pay the<br/>\n  piper.  I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic, Mister Know it All, Bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
