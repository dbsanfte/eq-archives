At level 35 I&#39;m charm/kiting the HG&#39;s and this morning ran <br/>\ninto the same exact thing you are talking about regarding groups blaming <br/>\nyou for trains. Unfortunately, HG&#39;s aggro on just about anything around <br/>\nthem. I was able to charm/kite 3 HG&#39;s when someone pulled 1 HG accidentally <br/>\nthrough the 2 that I already had fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor cyclopses, I&#39;d recommend you pull them over to the unkempt druid&#39;s <br/>\narea. Sometimes a druid will get aggro&#39;d on your pet, but I then just have <br/>\nmy pet kill the druid for me. You even get good faction with the good <br/>\ndruids. = P<br/>\n<br/>\nFor HG&#39;s I&#39;m thinking of trying to pull them south close to the Zazamoukh <br/>\nenchanter area.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d highly recommend that you warn any groups that will be in your path <br/>\nabout what you are doing. My recommendation is that if there are a lot of <br/>\ngroups in the area, that you join one of them or find some other place to <br/>\nhunt. Solo hunting can be very hazardous to other groups and can make a lot <br/>\nof people mad at you.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf Mistsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 06:32 AM 8/2/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Finally left my regular group and learned to use siren<br/>\n&gt;song.  Here are some notes I haven&#39;t seen posted or in<br/>\n&gt;any guide:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tarskuk, the named cyclops is 33rd lvl and runs faster<br/>\n&gt;than SOW.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The area to the right of the Lake Rathetear zone is a<br/>\n&gt;valley with a large hill in the middle (bandit camp on<br/>\n&gt;the hill top).  There is a gypsy camp to the North and<br/>\n&gt;an undead tower to the South.  The East side of this<br/>\n&gt;&quot;racetrack&quot; seldom has any action and this is prolly<br/>\n&gt;the best area for easy charm kiting.  Optionally you<br/>\n&gt;can pull two Clops North of the gypsy camp to the open<br/>\n&gt;area near the ruined druid ring for your kiting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The cyclops are often well camped and many people who<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t understand the bard class take exception to you<br/>\n&gt;and two angry cyclops barreling thru their peaceful<br/>\n&gt;camp.  Any trains that occur during this time will<br/>\n&gt;likely be blamed on you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I like to get on early in the morning when there are<br/>\n&gt;few people in the zone.  There are seldom any &#39;clops<br/>\n&gt;spawned at this time.  Kill the placeholders,<br/>\n&gt;lizardmen, bears and giant skeletons until a few<br/>\n&gt;cyclops pop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Always kill placeholders until at least three cyclops<br/>\n&gt;spawn.  It is a sad thing when you&#39;ve got a cyclops in<br/>\n&gt;tow and the second is taken by a group that has just<br/>\n&gt;arrived.  If this happens, relax.  Not even Tarskuk<br/>\n&gt;can catch you with that drum equiped.  Just run around<br/>\n&gt;the track until you see your next victim.  If nothing<br/>\n&gt;else, you can have your pet-in-tow kill placeholders<br/>\n&gt;for you until more cyclops spawn.  You will be<br/>\n&gt;surprised at how quickly cyclops can kill a bear or<br/>\n&gt;lizardman so be quick to retarget.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Charm kiting with a group:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Generally a bad idea.  Cyclops hit very hard and<br/>\n&gt;mistakes are often deadly.  But if you do, post your<br/>\n&gt;healers by the zone entrance and run by if you get<br/>\n&gt;into trouble.  If you&#39;re really in trouble, the zone<br/>\n&gt;is right there.  Melee type can hang out near the<br/>\n&gt;gypsy camp and you can train your weakened ex-pet to<br/>\n&gt;them for great xp.  Have the melee types kill<br/>\n&gt;placeholders while you charm for a never-ending supply<br/>\n&gt;of prey.  At this point, the cyclops will ignore the<br/>\n&gt;warriors in your group.  Just keep it chained and at a<br/>\n&gt;distance and the fighters can walk behind it while the<br/>\n&gt;cyclops remains focused on you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Note:  Enchanters have much better charming ability<br/>\n&gt;than we do.  the difference is that we run like the<br/>\n&gt;gingerbread man so mistakes and unexpected problems<br/>\n&gt;are much easier to avoid.  If you are lucky enough to<br/>\n&gt;group with an enchanter, let him/her charm while you<br/>\n&gt;sing Selo&#39;s.  Chain/Bellow/FCC the other cyclops and<br/>\n&gt;keep your finger near the Selos hotkey in case the<br/>\n&gt;unexpected happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Suggested songs to memm:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anthem/Chant of Battle<br/>\n&gt;Chains<br/>\n&gt;Hymm<br/>\n&gt;Selo&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;Bellow<br/>\n&gt;FCC<br/>\n&gt;Screach<br/>\n&gt;Siren song<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;__________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Kick off your party with Yahoo!
