I remember one &quot;Oh you have<br/>\nto see this idea!&quot; chainmail setup which was masking tape and books for the<br/>\nlayout on a ping pong table and miniatures for those that had one when the<br/>\nidea &quot;hit&quot;.  The rest of us were ... ping pong balls (what&#39;s the movement<br/>\nrate on that?).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen D&D, Traveler, Call of Cthulu, ICE (both the FRP & Space systems),<br/>\nGURPS, then AD&D (orig), and I started to feel the demands of my growing<br/>\nfamily and quit table-topping about AD&D 2nd Edition.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd non of the men in any generation RPed in my family. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far ... watching my son closely :P<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO Women run games & women designed modules/worlds always seemed to have<br/>\na better plot-line, more cohesive events and more depth of plot.  Mainly<br/>\nbecause when we design .. we have to keep asking ourselves .. But WHY would<br/>\nthe NPC do THAT? (its a female thing - we HAVE to know)<br/>\n<br/>\n- that grey-haired woman<br/>\n(Why are the college co-ops at work discussing 3D cards & and on-line games<br/>\nwith her?)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
