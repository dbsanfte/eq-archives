So i<br/>\nmight have been getting confused with the natural healing rate, its a<br/>\nlittle tricky to judge sometimes with the server actually *dropping* your<br/>\nhps below what the client software thinks it is. So when the servers come<br/>\nback up i plan on doing some testing. I hope im right, but its starting to<br/>\nlook like i am wrong. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nPS check out the psalms if you havent, i havent seen any source mention<br/>\nthis but they give damage shields too. At least the psalm of warmth does, i<br/>\nneed to go pick up the rest of the psalms now :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 40 Bard of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
