But for speed it is only about 15% greater speedup than<br/>\na normal hand drum when running unencumbered (for a total of<br/>\nan extra 7%-8% compared to running at normal speed).  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re walking (wounded) or encumbered, then the speedup is<br/>\nmore pronounced.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sure *feels* a lot faster though. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
