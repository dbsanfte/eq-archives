My bard lost 16th level 5 times by comparison.  Casters in my<br/>\nguild nearly never die, while the hybrids die a lot.  We don&#39;t have but one<br/>\nmelee&#39;r left sadly as they all got tired of dying 10 times as much as the<br/>\ncasters and restarted as casters or at least hybrids.

Uhhhh - not my wizard. If I die once<br/>\na level - I have really screwed up. With my bard - it was more like once a<br/>\nnight. Seriously considering starting a bard on this server there aren&#39;t<br/>\nmany - and the ones I&#39;ve run across are new bards - and not terribly well<br/>\nversed in what a bard is really all about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGet what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
