I was so<br/>\n&gt; pleased, no I deal out a modest amount of dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the double-attack folks in my guild are complaining<br/>\nabout the Yaks being a huge stamina drain (4.5 wt).  They&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen trying to get Wakizashis instead (2.0 wt).  The sharkjaw<br/>\ncutlass would fall under the same category (2.0 wt I think).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Spent 8 hours at the Lord camp sunday, made 2 bubs exp and hit level 38<br/>\n&gt; (yet another useless song). Only died once and that was because the Lord<br/>\n&gt; was too hard. Wiped all but 2 of us out (they gated out). Another group<br/>\n&gt; watched us die and didn&#39;t help, hoping they would get the kill but our<br/>\n&gt; cleric was bound next to the Lord room and managed to get the exp for us.<br/>\n&gt; In total we saw 2 Yaks and 6 SSB&#39;s. I lost every single roll &lt;sigh&gt; I<br/>\nnever<br/>\n&gt; rolled higher than a 62, what is wrong with me???<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh heh.  Told ya so.  :)  The levels required to hold the<br/>\nroom is much lower than the levels required to kill the lord<br/>\nwith a sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
