I am Pistov, a 10th level Bard currently residing<br/>\nin the metropolis of Freeport in the world of Cazic-Thule.  I have been <br/>\nlistening to all of the fine discussion by all, and like any bard worth<br/>\nhis lute strings, I have a few things to say as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n    First of all, regarding charging for locating a corpse, think of it<br/>\nthis way.  Bards, Shadow Knights, and Necromancers are the only classes <br/>\nwho have this talent.  Charging for this service seems a greedy and<br/>\nselfish act, much more suited to those evil undead mongers, I would say.  <br/>\nWe as bards work best in a group, and the more friends we have the better.<br/>\nLocating a corpse for free has made me many a travelling partner.  Coming<br/>\nfrom one who was a wizard in a past life, it is FAR easier for us to sing <br/>\nthe song of speed and run in a straight heading to locate a corpse than it<br/>\nis to wander around, lost, at a normal run searching fruitlessly.  <br/>\nPerforming this task for free gives all bards a good name.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Another thing I wanted to mention.  I myself tire of seeing a Dark Elf<br/>\nNecromancer, a Troll Warrior, and a High Elf Paladin all in the same party.  <br/>\nPlease, try to role play at least a little.  Bards are well suited to<br/>\npromoting role playing, since by our nature we are highly social.  It is <br/>\neasy enough to make a few hotkeys that add a little flavor to the game.<br/>\nConsider this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPistov shouts, &#39;10 Bard wanting to join group for dervish hunting.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nOR<br/>\n<br/>\nPistov shouts, &#39;I grow weary of singing to myself, I need an audience!  If<br/>\nyou would care to listen to a 10th level bard, please give a tell.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I guarantee you will have more success with the latter.  And it really<br/>\npromotes good role playing.  We as bards should be good examples for others <br/>\nto follow.  Try it, and I am sure you will begin to have much more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nFare well, all, and may the muses bless you!  Perhaps some of us may meet<br/>\nsome day!<br/>\n<br/>\nPistov</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
