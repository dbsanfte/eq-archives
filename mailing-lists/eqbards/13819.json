When <br/>\nI play my warrior, I will often stop taunting and will sometimes stop swinging <br/>\naltogether in order to balance out the damage, and to keep the MOBs spinning.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s much easier for a party to copy with balanced damage, and a spinning MOB <br/>\nattacks less, so both are useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
