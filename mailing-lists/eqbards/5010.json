I gave a Aviak<br/>\nCharm to a snake and then my newbie bard friend killed the snake. No charm.<br/>\nThere were 3 full slots on the snake though.  So, I think that the charm was<br/>\nlost because the mob had full slots.  Someone here said it will not work --<br/>\nperiod.  But I will try with a burnt stone and see.  Also, I suggest you<br/>\npick fire beetle as your loot mule - the most I recall on them is 2 beetle<br/>\neyes and I&#39;d guess that all newbie mobs have 3 slots.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tBlair, Keith (Keith Blair)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tThursday, August 05, 1999 8:50 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kblair@...\">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> \t\t&gt; I don&#39;t have much experience with NO DROP<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t\tThe only solution around this, as was suggested by someone<br/>\nelse on this<br/>\n\t\tlist, is to give the item to a mob and then kill the mob to<br/>\nloot the item.<br/>\n\t\tYou can give NO DROP items to NPC&#39;s because of the need to<br/>\nbe able to do so<br/>\n\t\tfor quests.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
