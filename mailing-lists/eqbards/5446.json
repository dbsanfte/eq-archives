Now,<br/>\njust as he logged on, another druid that had been solo&#39;ing the hermit was<br/>\npreparing to log off.  The new arrivaly began asking the other druid<br/>\nquestions... like &quot;What does this spell do?&quot; and &quot;What does that spell do?&quot;<br/>\nImmediately I smelled the prescence of Ebay!  As the other druid logged off,<br/>\nthe new arrival asked to join in rotation.<br/>\n&quot;Sure,&quot; I replied, commenting in groupchat that this ought to be amusing.<br/>\nMy psychic powers must have been working overtime because sure enough, when<br/>\nit became his turn, he KITED the hermit!  This is a MOB that I can almost<br/>\nsolo at 21, and he&#39;s 25 and KITING it!<br/>\nNeedless to say my partner and I laughed til tears rolled down our faces.<br/>\nAfter felling the hermit, our account-buyer came back in, plopped down, and<br/>\nasked me about the &quot;Winds of Karana Sheet 1&quot; quest item.  I answered him,<br/>\nand not a minute later he asked the same question on /ooc.  (this also<br/>\nhappened with the cracked flute)<br/>\nWith a spawn time of 5 minutes, most folks are more than happy to rotate the<br/>\nhermit, but not this guy.  Even though he couldn&#39;t med up in the time before<br/>\nour spawn came, he decided that it was just too much waititng for him, so he<br/>\nleft.<br/>\nProblems are over right?  Nope!  Throughout the night he kept /t&#39;ing me...<br/>\nwanting to know if we were done camping the hermit yet.  Just when I was<br/>\nabout to &quot;go off&quot; on him, his newbiness hit a NEW mark:<br/>\n&quot;(un-named UberNewb) says out of character, &#39;What&#39;s a topaz?&#39;&quot;<br/>\nLevel 25, kiting (what shold be for him) an easy blue con, and asking what a<br/>\ntopaz is...<br/>\nLadies and gents, he is my entrant for Newb of the Year.<br/>\n:::shakes his head in disbelief once again:::<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
