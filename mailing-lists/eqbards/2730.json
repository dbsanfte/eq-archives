I&#39;ve been in and out of<br/>\nbands for years, helped with distro and recordings and such, put out my<br/>\nown music zine, organize shows in my area, all sorts of fun stuff.  I<br/>\ncan play guitar, bass, a little bit of drums, and a couple brass<br/>\ninstruments (but not well enough yet.. been working on trombone mostly).<br/>\nI&#39;ve mostly stuck to punk rock, as it&#39;s the one music style that appeals<br/>\nto me the most, altho I also dabble in 80&#39;s pop,<br/>\nska/skapunk/skacore/etc, and a few oldies covers for fun.  Overall, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t see myself giving up music anytime soon, it&#39;s always been one of<br/>\nmy favorite hobbies and a very large part of my life.  Playing a bard<br/>\nwasn&#39;t even a choice for me, it was automatic.  *shrugs*<br/>\nTake care!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle green balls of mushy poison and other vegetables,<br/>\nZen Tormey<br/>\nLokar of the Soerbaird  (Fennin Ro)<br/>\nwww.soerbaird.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n This message was sent from Castle Rock BBS - telnet casrock.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
