I remember when I was level 5 and my friend was<br/>\n&gt; level 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting experience when we were<br/>\n&gt; grouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that even when the<br/>\n&gt; levels are closer, the people with the higher levels get more experience<br/>\n&gt; than the lower levels regardless of who does the most damage. Of course if<br/>\n&gt; you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I was just curious<br/>\n&gt; if you got any experience from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>After some amount of experementation, I&#39;ve decided that the percent of<br/>\nexperience you get in a group is relative to your current xp total divided<br/>\nby the total xp of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this is not based on levels, but rather experience.  The net<br/>\nimplication of this is that grouped characters will level at the same rate<br/>\nregardless of their individual experience penalty.  For instance, lets say<br/>\nA Warrior who just reached 2nd level has 100 xp, and you (a Bard) have also<br/>\njust reached 2nd.  Assume a 30% penalty - this means you have 130 xp.  If<br/>\nthe Warrior needs a total of 300 xp for 3rd, you will need a total of 390.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you both go out an kill 460 xp worth of critters...  The Warror will<br/>\nrecieve 460 * (100 / (100+130)) = 200 xp, just enough to bring him to 3rd<br/>\nand you will recieve 460 * (130 / (100+130)) = 260, just enough to get you to<br/>\n3rd as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother implication of this is that grouping at low levels is very bad<br/>\nfor the low leveler...  Assume as a newbie you start with 1 xp.  Your<br/>\njust-made-level-2 buddy might have 100 xp.  You are getting less than 1%<br/>\nof the xp, while he is getting more than 99%.  This is with only a 1-level<br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt higher levels, this is less of a problem, and the ratio approaches 1/N<br/>\nin a N-member party even for a spread of levels...<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I have no idea of the actual xp numbers required for each level<br/>\n(I assume it&#39;s some sort of geometric progression) and only a vague idea<br/>\nof what the racial and class penalties are, but I think the theory is<br/>\naccurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother affect, which is probably the issue you ran into, is a hard level<br/>\nlimit on who gets xp.  At low levels, this is a 4-level limit (group members<br/>\n4 levels less than the highest member get no xp).  At higher levels, this<br/>\nspreads out to a wider range.  I assume this limit is there for antitwinking<br/>\n(level 50 kills a critter while grouped with you and your tiny share of a<br/>\nhuge amount of xp gives you 5 levels...)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Luvas of Fennin Ro.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
