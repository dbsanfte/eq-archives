Verant seems to believe that the reason most people are<br/>\nleaving the game ( level 50 people that is or close ) is because we&#39;ve<br/>\nbeaten the game typically for a powergamer. However I know most people just<br/>\ngot bored with it because there was nothing else to do with their current<br/>\nchar or areas like Lower Guk or Sol B are just too crowded. If verant would<br/>\nadd some more high level areas and fix PoF I seroiously doubt this would<br/>\ncontinue. On another note almost all the 40+ I know and group with have a<br/>\nsecondary char some even have 3-4.  Hopefully Verant will begin to realize<br/>\nproblems as more and more people leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note Verant seems to think they can keep powergamers from<br/>\npowerleveling. Most recent thing has to do with the dot nerf. Has anybody<br/>\nseen kiting stop or even lessen? I sure haven&#39;t. If they would stop worrying<br/>\nabout keeping people low level and start adding stuff to the game instead of<br/>\nnerfing they would see a lot less people leaving or selling on ebay.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 9:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Plane of losses<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Wed, Sep 15/99, Naeeldar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Lol heh even before they twinked fear it was dangerous to go there and to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; kill the big guys in zone they need to move it back to the wya it was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>before<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; and lower the level cap to 40+.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t know about lowering the cap, but, I think this was a typical<br/>\n&gt;Verant reaction to powergamers (of which I was one) Basically, the zone<br/>\n&gt;was really tough before, even when you took 2 or 3 groups as one party.<br/>\n&gt;You still had a damn good chance of many people dying and then spending<br/>\n&gt;a few hours on corpse recovery.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But, a lot of us play(ed) 12+ hours a day. We could afford to take the<br/>\n&gt;losses and still come out of the zone after a few days with what Verant<br/>\n&gt;considered to be &quot;easy&quot; loot. So they nerfed it. However, unlike the way<br/>\n&gt;they nerfed the dragons, which we can still go kill, if we put a good<br/>\n&gt;enough bunch of people together and have a leader who can keep things<br/>\n&gt;together, they managed to nerf it so you don&#39;t even have a chance to<br/>\n&gt;zone in before you are dead. That&#39;s just, IMO, sloppy work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;OB Bard so this doesn&#39;t get kabonged. Almost the only bard only items in<br/>\n&gt;the game are in PoF. Other than the drum, isn&#39;t anyone else just a<br/>\n&gt;little bummed out at the dearth of bard specific items? We used to at<br/>\n&gt;least share some of the cool rogue daggers, but they took that away from<br/>\n&gt;us and gave us nothing to make up for it. Meanwhile, after the huge<br/>\n&gt;warrior protest a while back, you can&#39;t even kill a firebeetle without<br/>\n&gt;finding some new warrior only armor or weapon. What&#39;s up with that? Do<br/>\n&gt;we have to yell and scream until our faces turn blue to get any<br/>\n&gt;attention at all?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    GRAB THE GATOR!
