You will need to learn how to scoot thru the Black Burrow Paw but once","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1223399387\">Greetings Fellow Bard!~<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion to you is make a journey to Everfrost and Halas!  You will<br/>\nneed to learn how to scoot thru the Black Burrow Paw but once you know the<br/>\ndrill it should not be too hard.  Because of your young age, the bigger<br/>\nGnolls will find you a tasty morsel, so you will want to avoid those.  They<br/>\ngenerally stay in the lower levels and should not pose too much of a<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get thru the BB, you will need to learn the canyons of Everfrost<br/>\nPeaks but you should be well able to handle the stuff that roams thru there.<br/>\nI know of level 3 Shamans that have made the journey in reverse so I know a<br/>\nlevel 6 can do it.  The game in Everfrost Peaks is plentiful and rich<br/>\nespecially for you.  I&#39;d suggest learning tailoring while there because all<br/>\nthe materials are close at hand and if you invest the time and material to<br/>\nlearn and it does take some practice, I think you will be satisfied with the<br/>\nreturns.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalas as a city is smaller than Qeynos but has all of the comforts you need.<br/>\nThe people there - whilst they be Barbaric are not the less quite<br/>\nhospitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first real corpse rescue happened out on the plains of Everfrost.  A<br/>\nhigher level ranger - I think she was even 16 or more - got killed before<br/>\nshe could determine her location.  Believe me that was quite exciting for me<br/>\na low level 5 running across those treacherous plains for the first time of<br/>\nmy life.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you reach level 9 or 10 and tire of the fighting inside BB can travel<br/>\nto West Karana for big game hunting.  Then seek your fortune in the lands<br/>\nnear Freeport.  Actually at level 8, you could make the journey to Freeport<br/>\n- but a stop in Rivervale and Misty Thicket for a couple levels would be<br/>\ngood too.  If you do stop in Rivervale - invest all of your time there in<br/>\nquest of the Squad Ring.  You will be killing gobbies and orcs anyways - why<br/>\nnot get something for your efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun and give me /tell if you are on Innoruuk,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 17th level<br/>\na.k.a. Robo-Bard<br/>\nSwimming across Lake Rathe <br/>\nomw to get me corpse<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tTalien [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talien@...\">Talien@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tFriday, July 23, 1999 1:38 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Suggestions for a level 6 baby<br/>\nbard<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Talien &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talien@...\">Talien@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHeya,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYou fine folks have any suggestions for a level 6 Bard on<br/>\nwhere to hunt?<br/>\n\t\tIm was born in, and live around the Qeynos area.
