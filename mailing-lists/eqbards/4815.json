When I sing the Lullaby or Largo&#39;s<br/>\nMelodic Binding in Unrest, they only seem to affect the creatures nearby and<br/>\nfortunately not the hag in the basement.  Is this because the area of effect<br/>\nfor these two songs is smaller than Denon&#39;s and thus not reaching the hag?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Before we submit a petition, I think we should also consider the<br/>\n&gt; possibility<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that this is not even a bug.  I say that because it is within the realms<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possibility that Verant intended for our songs to work this way.  Sound<br/>\n&gt; does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carry so its possible that even though we can&#39;t see the monsters, they<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; certainly hear our songs through the walls.  Something to consider. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If that&#39;s the case, why do we need visual sight of a mob to target them<br/>\n&gt; with bellow and chains? As they are sound, line of sight should be<br/>\n&gt; irrelevant, no? Anyway, I would say this is a bug, or more likely a<br/>\n&gt; design flaw. The recent discussion on the charismatic carillon shows<br/>\n&gt; that there are other problems with the z axis that they haven&#39;t fixed<br/>\n&gt; either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
