There seems to be some delay<br/>\ninvolved with the mouse click - so you can&#39;t &quot;Riff&quot; (my preferred term) as<br/>\nwell no matter how quick you are at clicking that mice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - it seems some people get better results - I&#39;ve NEVER been able to<br/>\nRiff four songs like some have - so ping/pl time may be a factor - as well<br/>\nperhaps how fast your machine is..
