It&#39;s odd.  Bards really<br/>\n<br/>\n  stick together more so than any other class I&#39;ve seen.  It could<br/>\n<br/>\n  be the friendly group mentality we have.  A bard is truly a <br/>\n<br/>\n  different beast.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I noticed that a L50 cleric was trying to powerlevel a bard<br/>\n<br/>\n  the other day.  Needless to say, I&#39;ve seen very few bards<br/>\n<br/>\n  powerleveled.  It&#39;s not an easy thing to do.  Most powergamers<br/>\n<br/>\n  cannot stand being so weak, because in their mind if you cannot<br/>\n<br/>\n  heal, melee, or nuke then you are no good.  The inherent bard<br/>\n<br/>\n  trait is to group, and to powergame you cannot do such.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Therefore you build this community of very intelligent, patient,<br/>\n<br/>\n  fun, and likable people.  I&#39;ve never seen two bards really hate<br/>\n<br/>\n  each other like I&#39;ve seen wizards hate wizards, and druids hate<br/>\n<br/>\n  druids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
