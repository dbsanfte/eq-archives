My reply (after the <br/>\nbattle) &quot;Too many to type!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe I must say, really brightened my evening to read that.  We were <br/>\nhelping with a corpse recovery somewhere in Sebilis (this was my <br/>\nfirst time in that dungeon too).  Had 2 groups working together.  We <br/>\nhad been in several big battles already with multiple pulls each and <br/>\nduring this one we still had several more to go.  I think at the time <br/>\nI had my Lute equipped.  The hotkey bank I had up had Verses, Nivs, <br/>\nHymn, Jig, and Clarity.  I guess she saw several of those flashing <br/>\nicons on her screen and maybe I actually had a 4 song twist for a <br/>\nsecond (Verses, Nivs, Hymn, Jig).  It&#39;s just nice to be recognized at <br/>\ntimes. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRosha Cristi, Bard of 51 {insert something musical here}<br/>\nGuild Leader, Legends<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
