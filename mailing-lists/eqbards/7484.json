Your lowest level character probably has<br/>\nmore playing time than my highest.  Dying for me doesn&#39;t just mean running<br/>\nacross some zones and back to playing.  It often means running across some<br/>\nzones and quitting for the night.  Might as well be like that old MUD<br/>\nImmortal where dying prevented you from playing till the next day.  Now that<br/>\nwould be a painful penalty for many people, but for me no different really<br/>\nthan the current one.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 5:34 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Hey this sounded interesting..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;ve completely lost where this discussion is going.  i advocate the<br/>\nnon-binding side of the discussion, meaning for me when i die i have less<br/>\ntime to as you say gain levels and exp, but that means that&#39;s all i care<br/>\nabout?  i don&#39;t think dying is fun, i don&#39;t think running naked is fun.<br/>\nit&#39;s not supposed to be, that is my point.  apparently dying is such a<br/>\ntraumatizing experience for you.  running across a few zones is an<br/>\nincredible hardship.  i&#39;ve done it a million times, and i still don&#39;t want<br/>\nto be able to bind.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Definitely Agreed!  Still I can&#39;t figure out why people think <br/>\n&gt; running naked<br/>\n&gt; accross the world to you body is more fun than regaining exp <br/>\n&gt; you had fun<br/>\n&gt; getting the first time just so you don&#39;t get set back in some <br/>\n&gt; bizarre got to<br/>\n&gt; get to the next level plan.  What&#39;s up with that?  Does <br/>\n&gt; anyone understand<br/>\n&gt; that at all and can explain it logically?  I mean you had fun <br/>\n&gt; getting those<br/>\n&gt; xp the first time.  You get to get them all over again and <br/>\n&gt; have fun again?<br/>\n&gt; Unless you let thsi get out of control by not taking <br/>\n&gt; unreasonable risks,<br/>\n&gt; wait I thought that was the whole point of a death penalty?, <br/>\n&gt; there shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be a problem.  Unless of course playing isn&#39;t fun, only going <br/>\n&gt; up levels is<br/>\n&gt; fun.  Of course at that point running naked to get your <br/>\n&gt; corpse still isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; fun because while you are doing that you aren&#39;t going up levels. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
