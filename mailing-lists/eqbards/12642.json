You&#39;re right, without inspecting<br/>\n  each person (I did look at a few), I noticed no big surge of +CR/FR<br/>\n  stuff.  In fact, despite what Miriana says... they did Nagafen, and<br/>\n  immediately, do not pass go, do not collect 200$ went for Vox, I watched<br/>\n  them the whole time.  Gate from Solb to WK, and straight to everfrost.<br/>\n<br/>\n  While some items produce CR/FR effects, not all items do.  So for<br/>\n  a team so concerned with resistances as was said, why didn&#39;t they<br/>\n  hit the bank and swap out gear for the next dragon?  Why didn&#39;t <br/>\n  they pickup another bard?  They had 3 or 4 groups, and only 2 bards.<br/>\n  I would have offered to go for the experience, and no loot.  The<br/>\n  answer is that it&#39;s so routine for them, and they are so experienced<br/>\n  at it, they don&#39;t need much resistance support.  Which was my whole<br/>\n  point of this resistance thing, that if you have the right people,<br/>\n  you can whoop a dragon without going overboard on the Elem/Guard<br/>\n  songs.  You could then play VoV and Elemental, or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Harm, come to the dark side.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Never.  I still know there&#39;s good in you, I can feel it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
