No idea, but seeing those frog-like white things instantly<br/>\nmade me think of frogloks and seeing the dead one with yellow eyes only made<br/>\nit more so.  Maybe the froggies and goblins had a war long ago?  Or the<br/>\nfroggies and kobolds?  Maybe that&#39;s how the undead frogloks got created and<br/>\nthat&#39;s why the live ones hate them?

As far as I <br/>\n  can tell, I don&#39;t think the kobolds know anything about frogloks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think goblins, firegiants, kobolds, and nagafen are portrayed.<br/>\n  But who is who is hard to tell, besides the big dog Nagafen.
