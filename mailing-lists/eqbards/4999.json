This enabled us to clear almost everything in the zone<br/>\n8)except for<br/>\n8)Cazic himself and his three henchmen fright, terror, and dread. We had<br/>\n8)killed all of his henchmen before and they hadnt dropped anything<br/>\n8)interesting so we where thinking we would just rather ignore<br/>\n8)them. At this<br/>\n8)point we started getting cocky. Dracoliche was cake for us<br/>\n8)and if another<br/>\n8)server could kill cazic, well then we could to. So we<br/>\n8)launched our assault<br/>\n8)and imediatly cazic said something about his henchmen better<br/>\n8)come over and<br/>\n8)help him. At this point various profanties where uttered as<br/>\n8)we realized our<br/>\n8)fatal mistake, and sure enough fright, terror, and dread<br/>\n8)showed up on the<br/>\n8)spot just as we had cazic at half life. Luckily for us we had<br/>\n8)several high<br/>\n8)level magicancs and necros which set their pets on the<br/>\n8)henchmen. With this<br/>\n8)borrowed time we finished cazic and gated out with minimal<br/>\n8)losses. Killing<br/>\n8)him was about the same as the dracoliche except the three henchman.<br/>\n8)Definatly need to take out the henchmen first before killing cazic :)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Updated bestiary:<br/>\n8)Phoboplasms are my new personal favorite, they can drop up to<br/>\n8)TWO random<br/>\n8)class specific items. Last night we killed around 8 of these<br/>\n8)guys and TWO<br/>\n8)dropped a bard bracer, along with a bunch of ranger and shaman stuff.<br/>\n8)Cazic Thule : 8 platinum. Thats it. Good thing killing him<br/>\n8)was so much fun<br/>\n8)cause that was a big let down.<br/>\n8)Nightmare&#39;s drop some silly piece of nightmare hide that can cancel<br/>\n8)blindness. Woopydo.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Total bard pieces found have been 2 bracers, helmet, and<br/>\n8)boots (which i<br/>\n8)got) and arms and gloves which another bard got. No greaves<br/>\n8)or breastplates<br/>\n8)yet :(<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n8)----------------------------<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)How do you enter ONElist´┐¢s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n8)By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
