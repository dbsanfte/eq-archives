Only 4 mobs will attack you at<br/>\n&gt; once.  Others that have aggroed on you will either not move<br/>\n&gt; (thus staying out of range), or not attack (if they are<br/>\n&gt; already in range), or if there&#39;s another target they&#39;ll attack<br/>\n&gt; that instead.  As a result, it&#39;s more difficult to get more<br/>\n&gt; than 4 mobs within range of a song at once if you&#39;re alone<br/>\n&gt; (it&#39;s really easy if you&#39;re grouped or in a crowd of players).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s an interesting theory.
