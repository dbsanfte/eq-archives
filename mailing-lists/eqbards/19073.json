I thought about going into <br/>\nKaesora with my lil druid, but he was just to young apparently (lvl <br/>\n26).  That Guardian Spectre at the entrance greeted him with a few <br/>\nhard slaps and he ran him right out of there!.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosha Cristi, Bard of 47 {insert something musical here}<br/>\nGuildleader, Legends<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;jgs@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Greetings!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We went to Kaesora to explore and try for the coin.  Me 51, &#39;nother <br/>\nBard 51,<br/>\n&gt; third bard 50 and wizard 50.  I had a map - get one.  We zoned in <br/>\nand iirc<br/>\n&gt; took the left passage - then killed some bugs - then took a right <br/>\n(check<br/>\n&gt; map) and headed for the library on a whim.  There were several bugs <br/>\nto kill<br/>\n&gt; along the way and some spec&#39;s too.  Nothing to break a sweat for <br/>\nour levels<br/>\n&gt; although we lamented and tried to pull singles as best we could.  <br/>\nWe pulled<br/>\n&gt; to clear the outside of the library then moved up closer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the porch, we agro&#39;d something and as we fought we also agro&#39;s <br/>\nthe &#39;??<br/>\n&gt; librarian&#39; and killed &#39;em both.  The something turned out to be the <br/>\nfroog<br/>\n&gt; that dropped the coin for the quest.  Something else there dropped <br/>\na book<br/>\n&gt; (?? iirc) that had good int +5 or +6 and that made our wiz happy.  <br/>\nThen we<br/>\n&gt; went in the library and looked around.  Perhaps killed something <br/>\nelse -<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t remember.  We did happen to go up stairs and looked around the<br/>\n&gt; balcony.  On the ground, we found something for one of the medallion<br/>\n&gt; quests - &quot;piece of a medallion&quot; or something.  BTW - we were the <br/>\nonly ppl in<br/>\n&gt; the zone - sad but true - and it looked to be a very cool zone for <br/>\nppl who<br/>\n&gt; can get exp at this level.  You&#39;d want a good party, some anti-<br/>\npoison<br/>\n&gt; songs/spells but it looked to be good.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We went outside and started to look around. Then we got our <br/>\nobligatory<br/>\n&gt; over-pull.  About 6 things agro&#39;d and we were swarmed by greenies.  <br/>\nEvac was<br/>\n&gt; no problem as we got what we wanted and it was time to go anyhow.  <br/>\nNext<br/>\n&gt; time, we wil be heading to Dalnir&#39;s for the Royal Crown.  Then <br/>\nSuladan will<br/>\n&gt; have all 6 coins.  Kaldivar needs Kasora and Dalnir.  I have Selos <br/>\nDrums so<br/>\n&gt; its not as high a priority for me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, I dont know if the froog that drops the coin in Kaesora roams <br/>\nthe whole<br/>\n&gt; dungeon or he is always found in the library area - but that&#39;s <br/>\nwhere we<br/>\n&gt; found him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Richard Read&quot; &lt;richard.read@n...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, May 29, 2000 9:37 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: Dalnir: any bard toys?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am doing this quest at the moment and have 4 of the coins.
