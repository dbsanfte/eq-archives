Seems everyone has this misconception.  If your dual<br/>\nwield has a 40% chance of activating, it doesn&#39;t matter if the<br/>\nweapon in your off hand has a 10 delay or a 100 delay, it will<br/>\nstill activate 40% of the time and thus do 40% of the damage<br/>\nit would do if wielded in your primary hand.  There are some<br/>\nslight nonlinearities that favor faster weapons, but the #1<br/>\nfactor in deciding which weapon goes into your primary hand<br/>\nshould be avg damage/time (use a log parser) + procs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for putting a fast weapon in your primary is to<br/>\nraise dual wield skill - a 10 delay weapon would give 60 dual<br/>\nwield checks (and thus chances to improve) every minute.  A<br/>\n100 delay weapon would only give 6 checks.  If your skill is<br/>\nmaxed, this is a non-issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n(For those of you who remember, the disagreement JM and I had<br/>\nover this was a matter of definition - he was using dam/delay<br/>\nratio, I was using average damage over time.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
