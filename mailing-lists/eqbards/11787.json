At one point we had<br/>\n  3 bats and 2 ldcs.  A group with a healer would have fled,<br/>\n  but this group finished all the battles at full hp.  How?<br/>\n<br/>\n  2 paladins, 1 enchanter, 1 bard, 1 monk, 1 wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Enchanter does her thing, per usual.  AE mez, AE stun.<br/>\n  Paladins are key to this.  They can heal in a pinch if<br/>\n  needed.  But they are the stunner elite.  They are non-<br/>\n  stop stunning the mob during the fight.  So much so, that<br/>\n  not one ldc hit us between the paladins and the enchanter<br/>\n  stunning.  In fact, I have never killed ldcs and bats as<br/>\n  fast as I did in this group ever.. in my whole experience.<br/>\n  SLTW + sash + song = melee blender.  At one point, one of<br/>\n  the paladins never stopped swinging.  I never saw his sword<br/>\n  pause, it was always going.  This same group could have <br/>\n  easily broken the lord room full lord/bok spawn, sans healer.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
