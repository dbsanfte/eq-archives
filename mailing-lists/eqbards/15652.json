Where s the problem? Here s one of the messages that I posted in response to a bitchy message over in the Lullaby thread: Bards - I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1532658049\">I can solo Hill Giants..  Where&#39;s the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one of the messages that I posted in response to a bitchy message<br/>\nover in the Lullaby thread:<br/>\n<br/>\nBards -<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important for us to focus on the one aspect of bards that seems<br/>\nto be *bugged*, not flame Verant because you feel that the Bard class is<br/>\nunderpowered or unbalanced. Those are not the issues that we&#39;re attempting<br/>\nto discuss with this thread, and quite frankly issues that I feel are<br/>\nincorrect. I absolutely love being a bard. I feel that I&#39;m powerful enough<br/>\nand balanced quite well, thank you. However, I would love being a bard a bit<br/>\nmore if Lullaby worked the way that GZ said on Veeshan that it should.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the risk of multiple nerfs, let&#39;s recap some of our abilities:<br/>\nWe cover ground much faster than any class in the game. Our spells last<br/>\nindefinitely and require no mana. We can cast while running. We have the<br/>\nversatility to strengthen our songs by equiping instruments instead of<br/>\nweapons. We can duel wield some of the finest weapons in the game. We can<br/>\nwear plate, and our armor quests have always worked and yielded quite nice<br/>\n(and nice looking) armor. We can tank a bit. We can do some single-mob<br/>\nmezzing with Pixie Strike. We get party-wide Clarity that costs no mana to<br/>\ncast. We can heal up to 19 HPs a tick (manaless) for all party members and<br/>\nat lvl 47+ we can now heal for up to ~35 HPs/tick *for the entire party<br/>\nsimultaneously and without mana*. We are the only class versatile enough to<br/>\nchange party buffs *during battle* as the battle flow changes (caster shows<br/>\nup, change to MR songs). We can put up party-wide damage shields that are<br/>\nalso resist enhancers. We get *the best* resist buffs in the game against<br/>\nfire, cold and magic making bards irreplacable for dragon raids. We can<br/>\ntrack, hide, sneak and forage. And more...<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and gentleman. We rock. Period.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t enjoy playing a bard then by all means start playing another<br/>\nclass. The Bard class is NOT broken. A song&#39;s behavior is.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\n47th Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; God<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; Hate<br/>\n&gt; Class<br/>\n&gt; Envy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You gripe when they moan about us being able to solo Hill Giants<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you think they feel when you moan about them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stop the vicious circle people.
