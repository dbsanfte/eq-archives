More over, we are weak in raids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Aftathott on this one. Verant did a very good job balancing<br/>\nBards in solo and group situations. But we are far less valuable in raid<br/>\nsituations.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaids are one area VI should definitely spend some time on before<br/>\nreleasing Luclin. I hope they address XP in raids, class balance in raids<br/>\nand communication (chat) in raids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more of the game is around raids where the top Warrior, Rogue,<br/>\nShammy, Chanter and Cleric take the XP. The 6th spot is very likely a Monk<br/>\nfor pulling, but mages, wizzies and SKs are all more preferred than Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nTzeetch<br/>\nThe Commune, Xegony <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nUgh....<br/>\n<br/>\nIts funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find<br/>\nmyself<br/>\nsometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of keeping a low<br/>\nprofile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice. Seriously, don&#39;t laugh, its just<br/>\nthat bards seem very overpowered to me at higher levels, then again 60<br/>\nshaman with Can IV.... I used to think all level 60 were equally powerful<br/>\nbut I&#39;m changing my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope nobody else figures this out!<br/>\n<br/>\nTani, 54 Bardette<br/>\nHalana, 60 Shaman<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
