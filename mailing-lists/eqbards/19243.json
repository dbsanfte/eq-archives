It would have been<br/>\nnice to include them.  No doubt this is now at the top of Verant&#39;s list of<br/>\nfixes and fixing actual things in the game that damage its enjoyability by<br/>\nthe customers will be pushed back yet again.  All in the name of integrity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can a game where a necro&#39;s pet can outdamage each and every one of the<br/>\nother 5 people in a fight when the necro is lowest level character present,<br/>\nhave any integrity to begin with.  Bah!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t catch the message last night. I never thought of it as an exploit.<br/>\nNow I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;d be a shame to lose everything I&#39;ve worked for over the past seven<br/>\nmonths just to sneak an extra person into the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely not worth it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
