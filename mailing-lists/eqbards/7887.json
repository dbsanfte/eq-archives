Rubicite, the PGT,<br/>\nand to a lesser extent the SBH are infamous for being bad in<br/>\nthis regard.  My guess is because they&#39;re in relatively safe<br/>\nareas which are frequently camped so as to pose little risk to<br/>\nthe solo kill stealer.  If you get to some of the more<br/>\ndangerous/obscure locales, it becomes less of a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe finally got a fourth Ghoulbane last night for the fourth<br/>\npaladin in our guild.  All told we spent probably 40 hours<br/>\ncamping the lord spot over the last two months (for those who<br/>\ndon&#39;t know where this is, it&#39;s deep in a dungeon and requires<br/>\na high 20s to low 30s group to get to and hold).  We got four<br/>\nlords with swords, and I&#39;d estimate 15 lords with bracers<br/>\n(yes, we have silver plated bracers coming out our ears).  In<br/>\nall that time, we only had one problem with a kill stealer,<br/>\nand he was already known server-wide as a kill stealer (and<br/>\noddly enough has disappeared ever since school started).  <br/>\nWhenever we found the spot camped, we were friendly with the<br/>\ncampers and ask them to give us a tell when they were done.  <br/>\nThey did so in all cases, and a couple of them that didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave paladins in their groups let us take over right then and<br/>\nthere.  When people came upon us while camping, they left us<br/>\nalone, and we told them when we were done (and one guy got<br/>\nGhoulbane 30 seconds after we left).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I still feel kill stealing is a huge problem in the<br/>\ngame, it definitely does not extend to all items and all<br/>\nlocales.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
