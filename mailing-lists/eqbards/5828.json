I figured that a fellow bard should<br/>\nlearn from my 40+ deaths in Unrest since I was a lowly level 14 bard. Here<br/>\nare some replies to some statements that you make.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always a competent group of players is required to do really well, but<br/>\nlast night was an indication that surviving was possible.  I had a cleric<br/>\nand a mage totally lagged last night.  I know in truth that Selo&#39;s is a<br/>\nwonderful tool, but I have also learned that SOW can be a good send for<br/>\nthe rest of your party.  When running you will have to keep close tabs on<br/>\nall of the party members because it is eay to lose them.  So it is a toss<br/>\nand will depend on the situation.  BTW you are correct about the<br/>\nunrooting, but it will become a moot point once you start camping a room<br/>\n=).<br/>\n<br/>\nActually as a bard I find that the burners have to be of higher levels or<br/>\nelse the burn is resisted.  Though when partied with well equipped tanks,<br/>\nthe need for burn is lessened.  The bard could also be older as you find<br/>\nthat you are the tactical componenet of the group.  YOu be the one taking<br/>\nhits and tanking for the caster  if a surprise spawn appears.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell a group of players level 19-23 can usually take the Ghoul Magi room<br/>\nwithout a problem.  If your casters aren&#39;t of high level it can be<br/>\ndangerous when the Werebat spawns.  The bar room and hand room would<br/>\nrequire a group of level 22-26 can hold those two rooms quite nicely.  The<br/>\nsafety of camping the house is all dependant on the on the number of<br/>\npeople who can hold rooms.  Never hold the bar room without some group in<br/>\nthe tower and watch out for trains if those two rooms aren&#39;t camped.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW if you are playing any opf the rhythm songs be very careful I have<br/>\nseen way too many hag trains make a beeline srtraight for me when exitting<br/>\nthe house =).<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver <br/>\nHonour Guard, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
