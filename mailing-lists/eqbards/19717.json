I hate that moment at the end of a raid where I&#39;m <br/>\ndesparately counting...&quot;how many melee left and how many wizards/druids???&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s what we could really use:  A Charisma buff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarriors get a str buff.  If we&#39;re grouped with an enchanter who can buff <br/>\nus, our charisma is less relavant (though not irrelevant), but if there&#39;s no <br/>\nchanter or shaman around... well, it&#39;d be nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnaeve<br/>\nQuellius<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
