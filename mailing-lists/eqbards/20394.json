The &quot;most<br/>\neffective&quot; bard isn&#39;t one that locks themselves into one pattern of play.<br/>\nThe &quot;Most effective&quot; bard is the bard that knows when to put the weapons<br/>\naway and use a different tactic.  Sometimes you just dont WANT to be up<br/>\nthere swinging away.  It all depends on your situation, group makeup, mob<br/>\nmakeup, level, etc.  A truely effective bard understands that there is never<br/>\nany one way to handle a situation and an extremely effective bard knows<br/>\nwhich methods to use for each situation that comes up.<br/>\n<br/>\nDone arguing this thread myself ;)  It&#39;s turning into a &#39;tastes great&#39;,<br/>\n&#39;less filling&#39; thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nSinging since Beta 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess that there may be more than one way to be &quot;the most effective<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bard.&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Circumstances will vary depending on what weps and what magic instruments<br/>\n&gt; you have, who is in your group, where you are hunting, and what mobs you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fighting.
