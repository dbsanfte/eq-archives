If so then I say don&#39;t let the door hit you on the ass on the<br/>\nway out.  To roll for and loot a magic item like that only to &quot;complete your<br/>\nset&quot; and then retire your character is an example of EQ greediness at its<br/>\nworst.  If he had no intention of ever using the weapon, he should have let<br/>\nsomeone loot who could have actually used it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Yes, Innoruuk drops it, my guild got one a few nights ago.  It was awarded<br/>\n&gt; to another bard with a lot more Planar experience than I have.  He now has<br/>\n&gt; the whole set of weapons and Imbrued.
