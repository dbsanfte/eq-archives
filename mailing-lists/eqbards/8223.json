Petitioning because <br/>\nof a problem with an item&#39;s stats or because you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like the way something works in Norrath is<br/>\nabout as useful as writing it on a post-it note<br/>\nand putting it on your monitor. Guides/GM&#39;s have<br/>\nabsolutely NO influence on or to the Verant<br/>\ndevelopers. (Plainly states as much in the &#39;guide<br/>\nbook&#39; that was &quot;leaked&quot; not too long ago)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in effect, if everyone /petition&#39;d with things<br/>\nsuch as this, the &quot;stuck in the bottom of the world&quot;<br/>\ntype petitioners would have to wait that much longer<br/>\nwhile the complainers are repeatedly told that<br/>\nthey should do a /feedback report. Also, if you&#39;ve<br/>\nread that book that I mentioned above, you&#39;ll see<br/>\nwhere the only thing the guide is going to do is<br/>\nlog the petition as feedback just as the user<br/>\nshould have done in the first place to save time. It<br/>\nmakes absolutely no mention of any &#39;database&#39; that<br/>\nthe guides keep so I&#39;d be confident in saying that<br/>\none probably doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Um, Wayne, he was being sarcastic about the stats and<br/>\n&gt; pettions stuff, the stats on the items aren&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; known yet.  Perhaps some prozac is in order<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; /petition You all messed up again, you gave me<br/>\n&gt; cleric type armor, what gives?  Don&#39;t you realize<br/>\n&gt; bards primary stats are in STR/DEX/AGI/CHA?  You<br/>\n&gt; probably just typo&#39;d in the armor database again<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
