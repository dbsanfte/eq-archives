We had a L31<br/>\nenchanter in the group so I got a chance to time my attack<br/>\nspeeds.  The results had about a half second of variability<br/>\nacross 10 attacks, which works to +/- 2% or so.  I tested with<br/>\nboth my dirk (delay 23) and whip (delay 28) in my primary hand<br/>\nand got the same percentage speedup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe percentage I list is [(normal time)/(enhanced time) - 1 ]<br/>\nas that seemed to produce &quot;round&quot; numbers that I suspect are<br/>\nwhat the programmers coded.<br/>\n<br/>\nSongs:<br/>\nAnthem - 10%<br/>\nWarsong - 20% (this is an improvement over the 15% I saw at L17)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells:<br/>\nAugmentation - 20%<br/>\nQuickness - 25%<br/>\nAlacrity - 33%<br/>\n<br/>\n- The enchanter&#39;s speedups are faster than ours.<br/>\n<br/>\n- None of these stacked - the faster always took precedence.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Warsong seems to be improving with my level, which kinda<br/>\nmakes sense if they wanted to keep our self-only battle song<br/>\n&quot;competetive&quot; with Celerity which we get at L36.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
