I was<br/>\nusing warsong and chant so it was maybe what 90 something?  I&#39;d hit for 5 a<br/>\nlot but 6 or 7 was max I&#39;m pretty sure.  I haven&#39;t used h2h since though so<br/>\nI have no idea what it would be now if I could even hit anything.  I do seem<br/>\nto remember that some wisps were only yellow to me at 9th, but most were<br/>\nstill red.  My record keeping then was pretty sloppy though so I&#39;m not 100%<br/>\nsure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know warrior&#39;s don&#39;t get bellow but don&#39;t they have double attack by then<br/>\nand dual wield?  If so even at dmg 2 they&#39;d be the equivalent of 5/25 or so<br/>\nwhich is a combine scimmy.  I didn&#39;t have a magic weapon until 13th level<br/>\nand that was a dirk at 25p.  I couldn&#39;t have afforded a combine back then<br/>\nbecause I was too busy having fun to make money ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 1:32 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Elf Hide Gloves<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 7 Oct 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d have to totally and completely disagree.

Weapons are nearly four<br/>\ntimes more effective.  Put another way, a non-monk melee<br/>\nperson will take nearly 4 times as much damage fighting a<br/>\ncreature h2h compared to fighting an equivalent non-magic mob<br/>\nwith weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the reason, I don&#39;t think wisps were behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
