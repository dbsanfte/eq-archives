Why oh WHY are some critters so hard to target? I&#39;ll be in <br/>\n&gt; unrest - 2<br/>\n&gt; darkbones banging on my crew - a deeth beetle at my feet - and the dam<br/>\n&gt; deeth beetle is the only thing I can manage to target? I try <br/>\n&gt; to use assist,<br/>\n&gt; but it seems very, very buggy - more than half the time - it <br/>\n&gt; just doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work.
