My problem is, I&#39;m crap at levelling, to give you an idea I think I&#39;m<br/>\n31 days old and level 32. Thats almost 24 hours per level *sighs*<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of level you level 40+&#39;ers on this list so I was wondering,<br/>\nhow can I get a steady gain in experience? And the answer, &quot;don&#39;t die as<br/>\nmuch&quot;, doesn&#39;t really help. I wish I could die less than I do but I&#39;m just<br/>\nunlucky I guess. It&#39;s not my equipment that sucks just the rate I level at.<br/>\nI have good equipment for my level, Full Lambent, Various magic items<br/>\nDwb&#39;s, Exe Hood etc and plat jewellery. Plus I have about 1.5-2k in cash in<br/>\nthe bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was quite pleased last night with the 2 bubs exp however I did play for<br/>\nabout 7-8 hours so thats crap in comparison, I have tried places like<br/>\nHighkeep and it just gets dull and boring. Sol A is usually good but I<br/>\nstill get killed there sometimes and I end up with next to no exp made.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny info and advice would be greatly appreciated.....<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 32 Songs - Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
