I&#39;d say<br/>\nthat 99 percent of the motivation for doing 7 person groups is just so you<br/>\ncan play with your friends. (Ok, saving a bit on gates in to planes too -<br/>\nbut big whoope - they react like some one robbed the bank of Rivervale.)<br/>\nWhen it takes 8 hours of constant fighting to gain one bubble of exp - it<br/>\nhardly matter if 6 are doing or 7 are doing.  The bulk of this game is<br/>\nintensely boring.  What do they do to address that problem?  Social<br/>\ninter-action is the only saving grace.  When they stifle that, it just makes<br/>\nthings worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a growing &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality.  Fostered by poor customer<br/>\nservice, lack of communication: bug reports, email, etc, that never get<br/>\nanswered, the perception that only the squeeky wheels get greased &quot;bump my<br/>\nthread...,&quot; lack of product management &quot;the high level spells are dropping,<br/>\nGZ told me so; they are dropping we checked, they are dropping you just<br/>\naren&#39;t finding them; opps, let us know if you get any after this next<br/>\npatch....&quot; - That is typical of the programmer mentality who &quot;can&#39;t see the<br/>\nlogic because of the code&quot; (he cant see any errors until he belives the<br/>\npossibility of error exists.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then when there are problems in their code, they resort to arbitrary<br/>\n&quot;rules&quot; instead of accepting the responsibility of *their errors* and just<br/>\nfixing them.  Whether it&#39;s from some &quot;evil&quot; intent on their part or simply<br/>\ntheir own sloppiness or lack of Vision(tm) when it comes to details, they<br/>\nturn their design flaws, bugs and other problems into the players problems.<br/>\nOMG! You found a way to play with 7 of your fiends instead of only 6????<br/>\nOMG!!! The Vision(tm) can only see 6 players!  YOU ARE A DIRTY<br/>\nXPLOITER!!!!  - Why go thru the hoopla?  Just fix your code and slide it in<br/>\nthe next patch.  And what&#39;s worse - they dont see the same priority to fix<br/>\nthe ones that hurt the players (zones that dont match where you fall thru<br/>\nand die - then guides who wont res you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ebisha&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ebisha@...\">ebisha@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 01, 2000 10:24 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] More than 6 in a group?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; For the record, there was a system message this evening officially<br/>\n&gt; declairing the use of this bug an exploit warrenting immediate suspension.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just so you know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EMEEKER@...\">EMEEKER@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 01, 2000 10:41 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] More than 6 in a group?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I juuust have to say, 6+ member groups is an exploit.
