If I was<br/>\n&gt;wrong then I guess I have to retract the first part of the post.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin<br/>\n&gt;Bard and Master Brewer on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Last night Roop (a fellow bard) and I were grouping with a party in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Highhold<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Pass fighting orcs.  After one particular tough battle, one of the <br/>\n&gt;party<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;members stated that the fight would have been a lot easier if he hadn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;rooted the entire battle.  I then told him that had he informed the <br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that he was rooted, Roop or I could have easily broken him free with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Actually, I thought that Selo&#39;s only broke a root spell on the bard who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sings it, not on the party members. Any confirmation on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Selo&#39;s DOES break root, so does SoW (but much slower), and I also hear <br/>\nJourneyman Boots do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to hang in Unrest alot on the left side of the house. I would wait <br/>\nfor the designated fetcher at the door keeping it open for him. If he/she <br/>\nyelles &quot;Rooted!&quot; I would run in and Selo&#39;s and break em free. It DOES work <br/>\non party members. The only thing that sucks is if they were sowed they will <br/>\nneed to have it refreshed. Not REALLY that big of an issue though. I&#39;ve had <br/>\nto break myself free many times after getting hit by a ghoul or carrion <br/>\nghoul.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the SoW vs Selo&#39;s discussion goes - Selo&#39;s blows SoW out of the <br/>\nwater for travelling, but I find SoW to be best for fetching. Keeps things <br/>\nsimple, and you can sing other songs without worrying about Selo&#39;s. I hadn&#39;t <br/>\nhung out with a good druid buddy of mine in awhile, and while we were <br/>\nrunning thru E Commons tunnel i turned on Selo&#39;s. Next comment by him, &quot;Man <br/>\nF*CK sow!!&quot; Blunt, but to the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd GET a Dirk!!! If not to wield at least throw in your ranged weapon slot <br/>\nfor the stat buffs. I sold my barbed whip to use this, and am not even close <br/>\nto disappointed. However, as I have seen someone else post on this list - I <br/>\nwould HIGHLY suggest not limiting yourself to 1 type of weapon skill. <br/>\nPractice your 1H Slash, Piercing, AND Blunt. There are many great weapons of <br/>\neach class that you will come across they higher level you get. I found out <br/>\nthe hard way. I just got a Staff of Writhing through trade, and my blunt <br/>\nskill is 40. I can hardly hit with it. Hopefully I can get it maxed by the <br/>\ntime i am able to proc it<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels to you!<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 27th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
