I noticed a huge amount of all<br/>\nmanner of froggies (wan, zol, tal, urd, nameds) break snare whenever they<br/>\nfelt like it. I would say 80% or more of the froggies were blue to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m not talking about resists, I&#39;ve come to expect that, I&#39;m talking<br/>\nabout mobs breaking the effect early. Now I will say this, I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nI&#39;m getting a message based on the attack slowdown portion or the movement<br/>\nportion, but I&#39;m definitely seeing the &quot;Your Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain has worn<br/>\noff&quot; message well before 3 ticks have gone by. I have log records of me<br/>\ngetting the &quot;Surrounded by chains of music message&quot; followed immediately (no<br/>\nlines of combat text in between) by the &quot;worn off&quot; message.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was always under the impression that if I could get our snare to stick it<br/>\nwas pretty reliable, now I&#39;m not so sure. I watched in horror as I got a<br/>\nsuccessful snare off, saw the worn off messages after a second or two and<br/>\nthen saw the froggie zooming off.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 18, 2000 2:13 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 18 Apr 2000, Adam Wasserman wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that we are getting messages when our song effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; noticed that our snare song amost never lasts the full duration.
