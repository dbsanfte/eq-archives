I am so used to dying<br/>\nfirst or second in these situations that when it didn&#39;t happen I didn&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat to do.  I never planned a course of action for a scenario where the<br/>\ngroup gets attacked but I don&#39;t since it had never occurred to me as a<br/>\npossibility.  I stood there thinking &quot;Umm.. uhh.. What do the others do?&quot;,<br/>\nso I went up the wall and camped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only died twice in Hate last night, whereas two weekends ago I died 9 or<br/>\n10 times, a big difference.  One of my deaths was because I pissed Innoruuk<br/>\noff:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou go Berserk.<br/>\nYou slash Innoruuk for 14 points of damage.<br/>\nYou resist the Gravity Flux spell!<br/>\nInnoruuk shouts &quot;CRIER&quot;<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did NOT like me resisting his Gravity Flux one little bit.  heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nInnoruuk dropped a Dawnchaser btw, a Bard-only piercer that unfortunately<br/>\nlooks like a spear when equipped.  As with the other weapons from the<br/>\nMeastro (Six Note Blade and Evensong mace) it&#39;s 11/25 with no proc.  The<br/>\nguild chose another bard with a lot more Planar experience to award it to<br/>\n(he now has the whole collection).  My turn will come.<br/>\n<br/>\n[47 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; This only seems unusual to us bards.  :)  While playing around<br/>\n&gt; with sneak in various zones with no songs playing, I found out<br/>\n&gt; this is how the game works for everyone *except* us.  If a mob<br/>\n&gt; is aggroed on someone, you can be inside its aggro radius and<br/>\n&gt; it won&#39;t aggro on you (unless you&#39;re close enough that it<br/>\n&gt; decides to attack you instead).  I&#39;ve had giants, frogloks,<br/>\n&gt; kobolds, and various bugs all run through me and never aggro<br/>\n&gt; on me (should /con threatening while in sneak mode and behind<br/>\n&gt; them).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, the way it works for bards is that if you&#39;re in<br/>\n&gt; the aggro radius and your song pulses, that almost always adds<br/>\n&gt; you to the hate list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
