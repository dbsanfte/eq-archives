EQ is a game<br/>\n- you can &#39;win&#39; - rather, &#39;finish&#39; it. Communities spring up in virtual<br/>\nworlds - there is no winning in a virtual world - the focus is on living in<br/>\nsaid world.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat tiny bit of community among groups that might try to blossom gets<br/>\nsquished by exactly what you described - folks getting out of grouping<br/>\nsynch with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ learned a lot from UO - but they totally dropped the ball when it came<br/>\nto what makes a virtual world - how and what communities need to form, and<br/>\nproviding endless entertainment for their customers. They are stuck trying<br/>\nto reinvent the world - to keep the elder players happy. Given the proper<br/>\nframework - the players themselves provide their own entertainment and<br/>\nreasons to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:51 PM 12/2/99 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, they had to slug through a lot of other problems making the whole<br/>\n&gt;world come together - and making it work on 15 or 20 servers all synch&#39;d to<br/>\n&gt;some kinda version control system.  What I think happened is that what they<br/>\n&gt;saw in beta was incorrectly interpreted:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;some gamers find stuff and use it to gain xp = &quot;oh they are exploiting we<br/>\n&gt;will fix that&quot;<br/>\n&gt;nerf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;some gamers find new ways to use tricks to gain xp = &quot;oh they are exploiting<br/>\n&gt;we will fix that - normal players will never do that&quot;<br/>\n&gt;nerf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;rinse, repeat<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;ok, beta is over folks - thanks for all your help! say good bye now cus we<br/>\n&gt;are gonna delete your chars (again - hehe)&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;commercial release<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;some gamers find stuff and use it to gain xp - post it on their web site and<br/>\n&gt;everyone does it = &quot;oh they are exploiting we will fix that&quot;<br/>\n&gt;nerf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;some gamers find new ways to use tricks to gain xp - post it on their web<br/>\n&gt;site and everyone does it = &quot;oh they are exploiting we will fix that -<br/>\n&gt;normal players will never do that&quot;<br/>\n&gt;nerf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;rinse, repeat<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They did not or maybe even could not have anticipated the success of their<br/>\n&gt;product and the desire for the player to &quot;win&quot; even as it means enduring<br/>\n&gt;endless hours of boredom.  And it&#39;s this boredom and the needless &#39;hell&#39;<br/>\n&gt;levels that will turn away the casual to medium level players.  At some<br/>\n&gt;point, if you develop a game where the players compete against AI, you need<br/>\n&gt;to decide how many people you will allow to win.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I contend as I have in the past that they should not make it harder to get<br/>\n&gt;to level 50 - but they should make it more fun for everyone to get there.<br/>\n&gt;That is if they want to maximize their their player base retention.  If<br/>\n&gt;their model is: get to 50 or get frustrated and get out - then what they<br/>\n&gt;have is just fine.  Right now its real hard to break thru 35 and keep going<br/>\n&gt;on my server - one because of the game design itself and how hard it is to<br/>\n&gt;get xp without hours and hours played.  And two because there is a big bunch<br/>\n&gt;of player right at or near my level (mid 30&#39;s) Lower Guk on a popular night:<br/>\n&gt;70 players vs 40 or 50 froggies?  Solb - same deal.  Kith was a good try but<br/>\n&gt;has been kinda fizzled becuz of too much insty-death situations although I<br/>\n&gt;have not been there in a week (becuz nobody else was in the zone to even get<br/>\n&gt;a group going).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What the heck is so hard to understand: make the game more fun and people<br/>\n&gt;will play it more - and pay.  Make the game harder and more frustrating and<br/>\n&gt;people will leave - in droves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here is a run down:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Azmo - 35 frustrated and stopped cus he cant get decent xp in 2 hours a<br/>\n&gt;night<br/>\n&gt;Aejis - Azmo&#39;s friend quit now too cuz his friend is not there to play with<br/>\n&gt;Bate - cut back cuz Azmo and Ae are not on - so he is roughing it with<br/>\n&gt;pick-up groups<br/>\n&gt;Skwid - quit a couple months ago after a nerf that made his war get less xp<br/>\n&gt;- also a casual play for an hour or two type<br/>\n&gt;&quot;mr x&quot; - raised a player to 20&#39;s and got frustrated with slow xp for casual<br/>\n&gt;play - bought an ebay account - not playing either one much - prolly bz<br/>\n&gt;working<br/>\n&gt;thrifmir - raised a wiz to mid 20&#39;s - went away on business for 2 weeks and<br/>\n&gt;came back to most of his friends too high to group with - so now hes not<br/>\n&gt;playing any more<br/>\n&gt;sylly - still here ;p<br/>\n&gt;nadare - level 48 enchanter<br/>\n&gt;xaera - level 50 SK as of 2 days ago<br/>\n&gt;moods - level 50 Cleric as of 3 days ago<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So out of 10 - 3 make the end by hard core power gaming, 1 or 2 struggle on<br/>\n&gt;and the other half quit?  What kind of ongoing community will you have when<br/>\n&gt;you suffer a 50% loss getting &quot;winners&quot; and then have huge loss rates among<br/>\n&gt;the &quot;winners&quot;???  &quot;Welcome to level 50 - the level of nothing to do!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These are issues that they did not seem to think of - I can understand that<br/>\n&gt;they had their hands full with lots of other issues building the world and<br/>\n&gt;the game but I do have some fundamental concerns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the mean time - I really need to get level 38, 39 and 40.
