That would make me quit the game no question.  I am<br/>\noften joked about because I have been known to go from Halas to Kaladim and<br/>\nback again in one nites play and that&#39;s in about 3 hours.  I can never stand<br/>\nto stay in the same zone for more than a couple of days tops, i want more<br/>\nvariety than that.  Maybe that&#39;s why I want more binding somewhere,<br/>\nanywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 30, 1999 6:12 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Question...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be me.  I can personally attest that it is often very difficult<br/>\nfor me to get a bind because of the time zone I live in.  When I do get to<br/>\nplay, its usually after 9PM Hawaii time.  Thats midnight on the west coast<br/>\nand 3AM on the east coast.  What I usually end up doing is picking a zone I<br/>\nwant to adventure in and staying there for a couple of weeks.  I don&#39;t go to<br/>\na new zone unless its a weekend and I can spend more hours playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; If I lived in Hawaii like some on this list<br/>\n&gt; I would despair of ever getting bound in my what would be my prime playing<br/>\n&gt; hours.  You better know someone real well who can bind and you would<br/>\n&gt; probably be restricted to playing with those people where those people<br/>\n&gt; wanted to play.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
