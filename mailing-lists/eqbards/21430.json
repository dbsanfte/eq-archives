Anyhow, all my friends are still<br/>\nplaying or returning like I am, and I have to re-learn how to fight my bard<br/>\nwith all the nerfs&#92;changes of the last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, I was always a battle-bard with both weaps swinging and<br/>\ntwisting 2 to 3 songs at once.  During the timed I was away many of you guys<br/>\nhave perfected the &quot;instrument&quot; battle bard and I am considering giving that<br/>\na try.  I was one of those that relied heavily on Lullaby, Chains and Pixie<br/>\nStrike...but it sounds like those have been nerfed to oblivion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only &quot;special&quot; instrument i have at this time is the mistmoore<br/>\nbattledrums. I was outfitted in a complete set of steel plate (yes, back in<br/>\nthe days when that was considered amazing for anyone at my level), although<br/>\nI have a brigandine tunic now, and some kind of special sleeves one of my<br/>\nbuds handed me.  My current weapons are a yak and a silvery war axe<br/>\n(offhand).  I have both piercing and slashing maxxed, and I could max blunt<br/>\npretty easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am looking for is this -- what would you consider a &quot;prime&quot; setup for<br/>\nsomeone of my level.  Also, what were your preferred song mixes when you<br/>\nwere in your mid-thirties?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like I will be doing alot of grouping in Kunark during the next few<br/>\nweeks, and I am currently in Overthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to your input!<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon, 35th Level Battle-Bard of Bertox, Defenders of Aleria</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
