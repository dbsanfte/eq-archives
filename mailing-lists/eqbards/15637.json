This happened<br/>\nto me in November.  I was very lucky to belong to a good Guild who  helped<br/>\nme through it and replaced my stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt surprised me to hear Madagan say that he heard of someone being banned<br/>\nfor this.  At the time of my looting, Guides/GMs were unable to do anything<br/>\nfor me even though my guild mates hunted him down that day and got him to<br/>\nconfess and /reported the confession.  The perpetrator is still at large on<br/>\nmy server and it irks me everytime I run across him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are not an idiot, you probably just want to see the potential good in<br/>\npeople.  I have to admit, though, I am much less willing to trust others<br/>\nsince my incident.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLlyrean, E&#39;ci Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
