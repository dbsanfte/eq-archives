Got a set this past weekend.  I don&#39;t care if they ARE <br/>\nnerfed; I fly!  Had a quite a successful weekend (for me).  In addition <br/>\nto the drums, I got my Mudwater Rune, Fiery Vambraces, Shin Greaves, <br/>\nBasalt Carapace, and won a lotto for the Ring of the Goblin Lord.  Plus, <br/>\nI got to explore Sol A for the first time, mapped lots of Upper Guk, and <br/>\nsaw some of Lower Guk and parts of Cazic Thule that I had never ventured <br/>\ninto before.  Killed all sorts of creatures on my personal hate list <br/>\nusing Chain/Fear (Dorn died three times - I&#39;m still not even), got in my <br/>\nfirst Charm kiting practice (I stink at it).  Oh, and I got a full level <br/>\nout of the deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
