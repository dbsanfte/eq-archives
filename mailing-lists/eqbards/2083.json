That said, I&#39;ll offer my take on this forum and<br/>\nspoilers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play EverQuest way too much.  Since I got it I no longer vegetate in<br/>\nfront of the TV.  I play.  Hmmmm.  Maybe overall that is an improvement.  :-)}<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, even playing that much there&#39;s a lot I miss due to time or don&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out or am a bit too careful about.  In my mind and on an in-game<br/>\nbasis, this forum represents a conclave of bards, helping one another.  I&#39;m<br/>\na dedicated roleplayer, trying to keep the fantasy intact as much as I can<br/>\nand avoiding fantasy-busters such as /loc or talking too much in terms of<br/>\nsoftware mechanisms, but I&#39;m sure in an alternate reality like our game<br/>\nworld bards would share tales and information, suggesting good places to<br/>\nsee, profitable ventures, and particularly effective techniques and equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome want to discover it all for themselves.  Some want the most power the<br/>\nfastest.  Some want to live a fantasy life.  I want to have fun and avoid<br/>\nmajor frustration and I find this forum a wonderful resouce to those ends.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep the information flowing.  It is the life blood that runs through the<br/>\nveins of the bards, the heart and soul of Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush, human bard of the 14th circle, Freeport, Veeshan aspect</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
