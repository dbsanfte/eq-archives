Anyone playing on there agreed to that.  People are<br/>\n&gt; supposed to be there to test the new patches, zones, items . . . what ever.<br/>\n&gt;  Not to &quot;play&quot; like people on the live servers do.

Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test database<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for those<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character over<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \u001b$BCg4V$H$O$8$a$k!&quot;Cg4V$r8+$D$1$k!!#e%0%k!&lt;%W\u001b(B<br/>\n&gt; \u001b$B!!!!!!!V%0%k!&lt;%W%a!&lt;%k$7$^$;$s$+!)!W\u001b(B<br/>\n&gt; \u001b$B%5!&lt;%/%k!&F1Ak2q!&F1N=!&%S%8%M%9!&2HB2$G$I$&$&gt;!*\u001b(B<br/>\n&gt; \u001b$B!!\u001b(B<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.co.jp/info/features.html\">http://www.egroups.co.jp/info/features.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3411/13/_/451022/_/961597080/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3411/13/_/451022/_/961597080/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
