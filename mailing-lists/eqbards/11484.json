But the Butler, like many other<br/>\n&gt;inhabitants, drops a harm touch (~200 dmg).  And if said druid<br/>\n&gt;agro&#39;s the gargoyle that usually stands in there, or agros a <br/>\n&gt;hallway roamer - KYAG.  It&#39;s all in the pull vector, and object<br/>\n&gt;angles that makes the room look really easy, until the unexpected<br/>\n&gt;may occur.  I know, I&#39;ve been there many many times.

Harmony works in mistmoore<br/>\n2.  Druid has not killed anything that gives him Bad MM faction.  What this<br/>\nmeans is that he is Indifferent to MM faction things in Wolf Form.  Combine<br/>\nthat with liberal doses of Harmony, and there is very little chance of anything<br/>\njumping in (like basically 0%)to aid the butler or the Maid, or the Catliff. <br/>\nHe has killed (since lvl 32, he is now 43) the Butler 2x, the Maid at least 2x,<br/>\nthe catliff enough to get 2 Crested helms, and a truckload of shoulders, the<br/>\nCloaked D once. (He hasn&#39;t killed Mynthi yet for the drum, but he did e-mail me<br/>\na screenshot of him standing next to her while she was holding the drum....just<br/>\nto irritate me..)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, the difference between &quot;doable&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; is a matter of opinion.  He<br/>\nINSISTED that i use the word &quot;easy&quot; when describing the Butler....including the<br/>\nexample that it was easier than the Ancient Croc in Upper Guk...he also said<br/>\nthat he does not remeber being harm touched...is it possible that the Butler<br/>\n(if he spawns) during the DAY does not harm touch, but the one at night does? <br/>\nHe said he just may not remember the HT, but i would think he would remember<br/>\nthat!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n23rd song<br/>\n&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\nYes, there IS a high elf Paladin in my guild...go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill.
