The only way in is down a &quot;lavafall&quot; which<br/>\nis high enough that you can&#39;t go back up.  The only way out is<br/>\nby gating or zoning to Sol B.  Once you get in there with<br/>\nlevitate, there is no reachable land so you cannot drag your<br/>\ncorpse up to the surface.  Since your corpse is in the lava,<br/>\nyou cannot target it to loot it unless you have a song/spell<br/>\nto target the nearest corpse for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you aren&#39;t a bard/necro, the correct course of action<br/>\nwould indeed be to get a GM or guide to retrieve the corpse<br/>\nfor you.  If you are a bard/necro, then you have a way to loot<br/>\nyour corpse so the GMs don&#39;t have to help you, which is what<br/>\nthe original poster was griping about.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless I&#39;m remembering wrong and the /corpse command targets<br/>\nthe corpse for you...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
