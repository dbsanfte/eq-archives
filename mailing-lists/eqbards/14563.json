Our guild went to<br/>\nthe arena for some fun free for all dueling.  While we were there, I tried<br/>\nthe &quot;new & improved&quot; version of Syvelian&#39;s anti-magic aria.  My test subject<br/>\nhad a bunch of buffs up and I targeted him and cast it. About 1 out of 3<br/>\ntries, it would strip 1 buff.  He is lev 50 enchanter and I was lev 43 bard.<br/>\nSo, level difference probably has a strong impact on success rate and<br/>\namounts.  Also, he may have been buffed with GMR or what ever his Magic<br/>\nResist buff is. But even so, I was stripping buffs off a level 50.  Look<br/>\nLady Vox, next time I will strip your SoW~!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s my story and I am sticking to it!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
