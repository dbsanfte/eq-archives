Exact same stats as the Guise (4ac 13cha<br/>\n7mr NO DROP yadda yadda) Only new thing is that it must be equipped to<br/>\ntrigger the Illusion: Dark Elf effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tSomeone mentioned about big ogres and trolls blocking hallways and that<br/>\nthe Guise is perfect for taking care of this. From a utility standpoint, yes<br/>\nthat is true, but that is about all there is to it. There is really no sense<br/>\nof why the Guise is used.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.\tThe RP sense of it all. I know I&#39;d raise my hand first when I say that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t really consider what race a char is when I group with them. I did when<br/>\nI was level 6 but now it gets difficult to pick and choose who to group<br/>\nwith. If this were not the case and many people RP&#39;d racial reactions in<br/>\ngroups I&#39;d imagine that there would be a lot fewer dyed DE&#39;s and the ones<br/>\nyou&#39;d mostly see would be naturals. (Although the female DE form is rather a<br/>\npleasant sight };)<br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tEver think of why a froglok assasin would have an item that would change<br/>\nthem into a DE? The frogs are natural enemies to the Trolls and Ogres<br/>\n(possibly the DE&#39;s too not sure). Mayhaps there was some subterranean plot<br/>\nafoot to strike against the Tier&#39;Dal horde or evil races in general before<br/>\nthe frogs died? (This sorta falls apart if you consider the undead frogs as<br/>\nplotting against the evil races since they attack everyone...)<br/>\n<br/>\n5.\tPersonally I&#39;d prefer the thing to have the effect for as long as you<br/>\nhave it on (not just from an annoying &#39;damn-the<br/>\neffect-wore-off-gotta-right-click-it-again&#39;). If you want to be a DE then<br/>\nyou&#39;d slip the Mask on and the magic of it would change your form. Mostly<br/>\nsimilar to what happens in the movie &#39;The Mask&#39;. Unfortunately the engine<br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to handle the illusion effect across zones(?)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Katy Westerman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 08, 1999 6:39 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Katy Westerman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust saw that this had been changed in the patch.
