It&#39;s also quite obviously a bug that allows you to climb<br/>\na verticle wall with levitate. Using a bug to do something that was not<br/>\nintended by the designer is usually considered an exploit.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously invisibility was intended to give you a chance to sneak by an<br/>\nagro mob so your comparison does not apply. Invis was also given a<br/>\nrandom duration to make it not a guaranteed way to get past an agro mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
