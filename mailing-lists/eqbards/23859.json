For<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instance, if you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really, really want a particular class for a specific<br/>\n&gt; &gt; function (e.g. manna<br/>\n&gt; &gt; battery, evacer, puller) & the only character available is on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a player&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other PC, it might just be worth it to the group to have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard who only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sings the manna song, or a wizard who sits around waiting for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dicey, or a monk who pulls, feigns, and doesn&#39;t get up again<br/>\n&gt; &gt; until it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time to make another pull. &lt;/shrug&gt;  Any class played that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way is a waste<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the class, but still, maybe the group really, really, wants that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specific need filled.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Peace<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evulia of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                    Christopher Sanders<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                    &lt;christopher.sanders@exp        To:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                    erian.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                                                    cc:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                    02/14/01 09:49 AM               Subject:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   RE: [eqbards] Answers to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                    Please respond to               Questions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on Loot Rights<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                    eqbards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hehe...the loot fairy is welcome to visit me while I&#39;m away.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My only question is, how can a person play more than one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; character at a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; effectively?  Yesterday in Dalnir, I was doing CC (heh...it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weird being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high enough level to say this) for my group, and it was more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than enough to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep me busy.  There is no way I could have played, say, a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same time, at least not effectively, much less a class that takes more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situational awareness, like a chanter or cleric (or a bard.  :)  ).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would be hesitant to be in a group where the same person<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was trying to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2 classes in the same group/raid.  Especially in high risk,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; multiple mob<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dungeons, where not even Selos has a chance to save my hide.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sounds like things have worked out, though.  That&#39;s always a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good thing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Atonal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nearly 30 after a few days in Dalnir!

Were all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people in both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; groups in your guild? [Yes everyone in both groups is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; technically in our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild] And 2 of the people (including the tag-along<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Enchanter) were being played by your guild leader? [ The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild leader is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Queen and her husband the king were both playing 2 characters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each. She was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing the second L44 enchanter and her shaman and the king<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was playing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warrior and a cleric] &quot;Walk on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild&quot; means leaving the guild? [Yes I mean leave the guild.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our guild is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; based on the chivalric values and while this was hopefully<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only a momentary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lapse of clear reasoning, I wanted them to see just how seriously we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; considered this issue.]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As to rules, we have loot rules to this effect that the king<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wrote that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; primaries get first cut. We discussed this at the time with several<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guildmates and some were kinda divided over the rightness of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it. I guess<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mudding factor was the chanter was actually there. We&#39;re a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fairly small<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild nowadays and this is the first disagreement over loot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we&#39;ve had. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really think it wasn&#39;t greed as much as it was them having been too<br/>\n&gt; &gt; insular.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The king has an odd work schedule (doctor) and so they have never been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; involved in Planes raids or high level dungeon raids with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone else. We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tend to hang with other guilds like Venator Sapentia as we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have several<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guilded or ex&#39;excal friends in VS and so we get out more you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might say.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As to multiples, we currently own 4 accounts: we&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends quit with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decent level characters and so we took over the account in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one case and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; added the third just prior to that for bankspace mostly. We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a 3rd pc<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our office in easy reach of either of us so we do play up to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3 lower level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; characters at once usually wizard, necro, and a healer. We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play with our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends alternates who are similiar level and there&#39;s never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any issue over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loot. We have a third generation of characters started and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nearing their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 20&#39;s now as well. It proves we&#39;re addicted of course but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; given us a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chance to try out alot more character types; we&#39;ve probably got one of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything at this point. I do think there are classes and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; places where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing 3 characters is not a good option. A couple of our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gotten second accounts from friends or family members as well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so now we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an address book of account names and passwords so we can move<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items at will.
