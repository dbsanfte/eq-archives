Not that I disagree but I think what really is the<br/>\nproblem in your case here is that there&#39;s not gates in that part of the<br/>\nworld at all which is a huge oversight on Verant&#39;s part. There&#39;s a druid<br/>\ncircle in Perma, IIRC, but no spell to gate there. I haven&#39;t run across<br/>\na wizard circle there though. But I think we&#39;d have a hell of a lot<br/>\nbetter chance of getting gates to everfrost put in the game than to get<br/>\nother classes gate and bind.
