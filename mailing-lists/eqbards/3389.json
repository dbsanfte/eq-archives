What that something is I cannot fathom.  I spent a<br/>\ncouple hours there last night and ran into some interesting things, though<br/>\nnot particularly Bardic ones.<br/>\n\tFirst I ran into one of the named Shraloc orcs for the first time.<br/>\nIt was Renlik, or something close to that.  He was a reasonable fight for a<br/>\n15th measure bard and carried several gp and a bronze longsword.  I then<br/>\nfound a small house, where none had been before btw, with a gypsy merchant<br/>\nin it selling herbs.  I haven&#39;t seen these herbs anywhere else, but its been<br/>\nquite a while since I visited Halas.  She offered me 3.3pp for the sword.<br/>\nFiguring I&#39;d get a better price from a merchant I knew well I told Elsbyth<br/>\nno thanks and headed off to Rivervale.  On the way I ran into two gray<br/>\nwolves, something else I have never seen in Kithicor before, and I hae spent<br/>\na fair amount of time hunting undead and scarabs there some time back.  I<br/>\nkilled one of the gray wolves, hoping to find a good pelt and low and behold<br/>\nI got this feeling that someone wasn&#39;t happy about my killing a wolf in<br/>\nKithicor.  Fortuantely not that Holly Windstalker kind of right before you<br/>\ndie kind of feeling, but more of a prickling along the back of your neck you<br/>\nget when your &#39;Wolf&#39; faction takes a hit.  Next thing I know it did just<br/>\nthat!  Since when is there a faction of Wolves?  Unnerved I walked around<br/>\nthe other gray wolf and smack into a wolf.  Not a black wolf, not a shadow<br/>\nwolf, or gray wolf.  Just a wolf.  He was looking at me in that hungry way<br/>\nwolves do so I attacked him before he could jump my back.  He was about as<br/>\ntough as the gray, but not as quick to run.  But he had the most remarkable<br/>\npelt, one of medium quality!  This was the first time I had ever seen a pelt<br/>\nabove Low quality mind ou and the first time I had ever seen &#39;a wolf&#39;.<br/>\nAgain though I felt that icy hand of lowering &#39;Wolf&#39; faction gripping my<br/>\nshoulder as the beast fell dead.  Now every time I see any kind of wolf I<br/>\nshudder, and wonder who they are reporting to.  Every person I meet is<br/>\nquickly scanned for signs of wolf sympathies.  I know they are out there,<br/>\nand they are not amused.  <br/>\n\tHappily trotted into Rivervale, ah the wonders of halfling<br/>\ncivilization.  Rolled up to my friend Twippie and showed him the sword.<br/>\nHe&#39;s been kindly to me for almost as long as I can remember so he always<br/>\ngives me great prices.  He took one look at the word and offered me 2.7pp.<br/>\nI reeled in shock, the gypsy woman had offered me more than my old friend<br/>\nTwippie?  I was stunned.  I checked around town and Twippie&#39;s deal was not<br/>\nto be beat.  Thinking that gypsy needed more investigation I ran back into<br/>\nKithicor to find her.  Well, the house was there still, but of Elsbyth there<br/>\nwas no sign.  I searched around a bit until I spotted a wolf following me.<br/>\nIt was weird, I turned, he turned, just sauntering along.  at that wee hour<br/>\nof the morning it was too much to bear and I hightailed it back to<br/>\nRivervale.  Maybe in the daylight I&#39;d look for Elsbyth again, but not at<br/>\nnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi the spooked</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
