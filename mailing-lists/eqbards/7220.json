During the Tests <br/>\nI am a 29th Bard non encumBered.  <br/>\n     <br/>\nFor the tests I tested with 2 separate weapons, An Electrum Bladed <br/>\nWakazashi<br/>\nand a Short Sword of the Ykesha.  Each test was done with one weapon only <br/>\nand the off hand just punching.  I tested with the Sash on, Sash off (Troll <br/>\nHide Belt on instead), Anthem on no Sash, and Both Anthem and the Sash <br/>\nactive.  Here are my results.  <br/>\n     <br/>\nFirst test with the Wakazashi Fighting against 4 separate Sand ScaraBs. <br/>\nTiming on this test was 27 Seconds.  The Wakazashi is listed as 7 damage 21 <br/>\nDelay.  <br/>\n     <br/>\nDelay 21 (2.08) Wakzashi - No Sash - No song  - 13 hits (including misses) <br/>\nin 27 seconds (4 punches not included)<br/>\n     <br/>\nDelay 19 (1.93) Wakazashi - No Sash - Antem de Arms - 14 hits in 27 seconds <br/>\n(5 punches as well)<br/>\n     <br/>\nDelay 18 (1.8 ratio) Wakazashi - Sash on - No Song - 15 hits/27 sec (3 <br/>\npunches)<br/>\n     <br/>\nDelay 14 (1.42) Wakazashi - Sash on - Anthem On - 19 hits/27 sec (3 <br/>\npunches)<br/>\n     <br/>\nThe second test was trying the Short Sword of Ykesha instead of Wakazashi. <br/>\nIt was against 4 separate Crypt mummies.  The stats for the Ykesha are <br/>\nlisted as 24 delay 8 damage.  At my level its effect does not go off yet. <br/>\nTiming on this test was 35 seconds each.  <br/>\n     <br/>\nDelay 23 (2.33) Ykesha - No Sash - No Song - 15 hits 35 seconds (5 punch)<br/>\n     <br/>\nDelay 22 (2.19) Ykesha - No Sash - Anthem De Arms playing - 16/35 (5 punch)<br/>\n     <br/>\nDelay 19 (1.94) Ykesha - Sash Worn - No Song - 18/35 (7 punches not <br/>\nincluded)<br/>\n     <br/>\nDelay 15 (1.52) Ykesha - Sash - and Anthem all going - 23 hits 35 seconds <br/>\n(5<br/>\npunches)<br/>\n     <br/>\nFrom these results it is easy to see that the Flowing Black Silk Sash and <br/>\nAnthem de Arms do indeed Stack thier Speed increases.  In Fact, when <br/>\nComined<br/>\ntogether their enhancements are far Better than the sum of thier parts.  In <br/>\nsome way when comBined they totally rule.  Using Both the Sash and Singing <br/>\nAnthem De Arms I took a 21/7  weapon down to a 14/7 one, and a 24/8 down to <br/>\n15/8.  These are phenomenal stats.  Get a Sash when you can.  They are <br/>\ngreat<br/>\nstuff.  <br/>\n     <br/>\n(I also tested to see if the sash speeded up song pulses ut the results <br/>\nindicate that the Sash does not speed our songs.  I recieved 10 messages in <br/>\n60 seconds with heal and with anthem regardless if I had the sash on or <br/>\noff).  <br/>\n     <br/>\nNote I have not tested with a slower weapon like the Runed Falchion.  Also <br/>\nnote that a weapons Speed Rating is equivalent the the tenths of seconds in <br/>\nBetween swings it seems.  <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\nThanks<br/>\nRADIA<br/>\nCazic-Thule Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
