One problem though...  I thought all my problems<br/>\nwould go away when I got the song, and alas, they have magnified.  We tried<br/>\ntaking a couple of different areas of Sol A with me in a diminished role of<br/>\nbeing a mana maker and it didn&#39;t work out to well.  I still need to fulfil<br/>\nmy old role as puller (Lament), crowd control (Lullaby or Pixie depending on<br/>\nthe number), healing (I weave it with Clarity), chains (I can get it to<br/>\nstick on A LOT of things that the druid gets 3 or 4 resists on).  What&#39;s<br/>\nlost now though is MR(Guardian and Elemental) and Anthem... both sorely<br/>\nmissed.  Additionally, there is has been a super fine line we&#39;ve been<br/>\nwalking on playing clarity enough to get some mana in the party vs. running<br/>\noff to get the next pull before the spawns get messed up.  I&#39;ve been lucky<br/>\nthat I have been able to manage the situation by pulling only to break us<br/>\ninto an area and space the spawns apart.  My wife (a warrior) can then pull<br/>\nafter that without needing Lament.  I also have a HUGE advantage in being<br/>\nable to have my wife or brother-in-law give commands and maintain group<br/>\ncommunication for me while I mash the keyboard (we all play in the same<br/>\nroom).<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, what our parties REALLY need more then anything else is another bard to<br/>\ndo all the things I used to do so that I can concentrate on my new roles<br/>\n:-).  Problem is there aren&#39;t enough of them to go around.  We really need<br/>\nmore bards.  I&#39;ve got a feeling that the sentiment is server wide on Prexus.<br/>\nYesterday afternoon, I had organized a successful 2 party assault on the<br/>\nKing&#39;s room and the Torturer in Sol A with my guild when I got a tell asking<br/>\nme if I could go to Perma and help with Vox.  I had to decline, but I<br/>\nstarted thinking that the state of bards must be REALLY bad on my server if<br/>\nthey are pleading with a level 32 bard to come play Cold Resistance songs so<br/>\nthat they could take Vox (I figure they already had some bards, but needed a<br/>\ncouple more).  I hadn&#39;t even imagined wandering into that part of Perma<br/>\nuntil at least level 40!<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 32nd (sliver from 33rd!) song<br/>\nPrexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
