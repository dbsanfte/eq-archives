My plan was to get everything around the house caught<br/>\nup and maybe a bit ahead before PoP, but now it looks like I will need to<br/>\nget back on the raid horse. I really don&#39;t care for raid level stuff, all<br/>\nhurry up and wait. Plus I finally got a new job and have to log at a<br/>\nreasonable hour. Being on EST, that means I have to go about the time we get<br/>\nreally started in VT or wherever.
