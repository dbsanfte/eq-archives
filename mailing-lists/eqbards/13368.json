Today is your first day,<br/>\nand that should be spent learning the primary tenant of a monk: uncontrolled<br/>\nviolence will only destroy one&#39;s self.  Come students, let us be still and<br/>\ncontemplate this thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf: Excuse me, excuse me sir!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Yes young seeker of knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf: Do you mind if I ask a question before we start?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Go right ahead young one.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf: When do we get to gate?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: A monk will never gate.  Alas, it is not our calling.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf:  All my friends gate, and they can bind too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: We are masters of the body, not of magic.  The body is pure, and our<br/>\nforces come from this purity, not from outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf:  Well that sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Alas child, you do not understand.  Our way is to become one with<br/>\nyour inner body, your muscle, your sinew.  To channel magic would be to mix<br/>\nspring water with gutter water.  Come class, let us meditate on our new<br/>\nfound knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nDominic:  Pardon my interruption...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Another question.  My, an eager class so full of interest.<br/>\n <br/>\nDominic:  Do we really have to wear an orange headband.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: The orange headband is a sign of honor; earned through the trials of<br/>\ncombat.<br/>\n<br/>\nDominic: But orange doesn&#39;t look good on me, it&#39;s just not my color.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Alas my child, you too do not understand.  We lead a simple life,<br/>\nshowing no want of earthly possessions.  Except for our clothing, we need<br/>\nlittle.  We live the humble life, wearing what little we have to show our<br/>\ndevotion to our path.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf:  If I was an enchanter, I&#39;ll bet I could change the color of the<br/>\nheadband for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Class, it is time for silence as caterpillar is silent while<br/>\nbecoming a butterfly.  Let us dwell upon our future path...<br/>\n<br/>\n[Class is silent although restless for a while)]<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth: Excuse me master, but I have a question about what you said.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Who disturbs the calm as a falling tree disturbs the forest?<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth:  Me!  Are you deaf or something?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Now that our concentration is broken, what is your question young<br/>\ninitiate?<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth: I was thinking of what you said about not needing possessions...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Very good, you are contemplating a true and right thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth: Where do we keep our sword?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Our body is a weapon; why would we need anything else?<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth:  So we can kill something?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Over time, your hands and feet will be able to do more damage, than<br/>\neven the greatest paladin with his holy weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth: Are some kind of loony?!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Young student, please step forward so you may learn more closely the<br/>\nways of a monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth: Cool.  Is this where you want me to stand.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Class, please observe:<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth:  OOOF!  Hey, your hit me!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Class, as you can see, we have no need of weapons..<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth:  Hey, that wasn&#39;t fair, I didn&#39;t even have a weapon!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster:  Here is a fine steel sword young student.  You will find that it<br/>\nonly gets in the way.<br/>\n <br/>\nSmashmouth:  Yeah, we&#39;ll see about that.  Try it again now that I&#39;m ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Class, observe again<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth:  OOOF!  Hey, I&#39;ll bet you couldn&#39;t do that with a shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Here is a shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth: Now try getting past me this time.  OOOF!  Ok,  I think I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to lay down here for a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf: If you had gate, you wouldn&#39;t get hit at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Class, S3 has learned a valuable lesson, that the hand without a<br/>\nweapon is quicker when not chained with metal.<br/>\n <br/>\nDominic:  Master, we only use our hands and feet?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Yes child, you learn quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDominic: That sounds kind of messy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: When we punch or kick a foe, we battle it directly, human against<br/>\nmonster.  Others use weapons or magic as a crutch because they have not<br/>\nfully developed the potential of their own body.<br/>\n<br/>\nDominic:  Do we have to kill giant spiders with our hands?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Yes my child.<br/>\n<br/>\nDominic:  I can see it now. Well, the bug juice on my hand is going to look<br/>\njust spiffy, clashing with my orange headband!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Class, you do not understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf:  No gate, no possessions to speak of, except for ones that will<br/>\nclash with Dominic&#39;s wardrobe.  This doesn&#39;t sound too good to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: My child, a monk is one of the most exciting classes to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf: Yeah, well, I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Your humble teacher has run up alone to Lord Nagafen, attacked him,<br/>\nand lived.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth: Yeah right!  And bixies commonly kill giants.  Tell me another<br/>\none. OOOF!  Hey!<br/>\n <br/>\nMaster: Please show proper respect for one&#39;s elders.  It was my job to run<br/>\nahead and lure him and his fire giant guards.  I was to run alone to Lord<br/>\nNagafen&#39;s throne room alone and bring him back.<br/>\n<br/>\nDominic: So you have god guts instead of spider guts on your hands.  I<br/>\nsuppose the bigger they are, the more they splatter.  I am doomed to lead a<br/>\nmessy life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: Well child, the blood did not soil my hands that evening.  That is<br/>\nnot the proper role of monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf:  Huh?  You run up, bonk Naggy on the nose, run back, and you don&#39;t<br/>\neven fight him?  What exactly were you doing?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster:  I used one of the skills that you will learn later down the path:<br/>\nfeign death.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth:  You rolled over and played dead?   Bwahahaha  OOOF!   Bwahahaa<br/>\nOOOF!  Bwahahaha.  OOOF!  OOOF!  OOOF!  It&#39;s gwetting dark in hwere...<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf:  So let me get this straight.  After years of learning to fight<br/>\nwith your body, you come to the pinnacle of your career, and feign death? <br/>\n<br/>\nMaster: The role of the puller in combat is an honorable one.  It can only<br/>\nbe done by ones great with knowledge and skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nGandalf:  I&#39;m never going to be able to explain this to dad.  &quot;Well dad, I&#39;m<br/>\nreally a great fighter, but I spend most of my time feigning death.&quot;  I<br/>\nthink I&#39;m going to find a magic guild.  At least they can gate.<br/>\n<br/>\nDominic:  The monk life is too messy for me.  I think I&#39;m going to quit and<br/>\nbecome a tailor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmashmouth:  Well, I&#39;m off to the fighter&#39;s guild, at least they don&#39;t teach<br/>\nthem to play dead against their foes.  OOOF!  Hey!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaster:  Alas, the young initiates have all left the calling of a monk.<br/>\nThank the gods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
