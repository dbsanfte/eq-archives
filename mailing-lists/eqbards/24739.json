Only worked on the first charm and then they all wanted your blood.  <br/>\nAfter that I would simply charm until one of the mobs started to wander off--signaling very low hp.  I would let charm expire and then chant whichever mob was lowest for full xp.  I would gain a quarter bubble of xp per coldain village at 41 doing this and solo four in about 20 minutes.  Your pet will poof if it&#39;s killed while charming but that&#39;s the only way it happens.  Killing stuff with our dots doesn&#39;t make it poof either.<br/>\nWith the nerf, coldain charm kiting is still possible but it&#39;sa lot riskier.  and you don&#39;t want to do missionaries this way -- takes too much time to target -- command the pet -- and retarget and also run when you are being chased by four coldain and being struck down by wrath spells.<br/>\nMy xp has slowed now -- and my 51st druid friend can still quad kite wyverns for a quarter bubble of xp every time.  Why does it always seem like bards are the ones to get &quot;nerfed&quot;?<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blitz_krieg@...\">blitz_krieg@...</a> wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Aren&#39;t you supposed to charm your victim before you kill it to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>clear it&#39;s  exp history list?
