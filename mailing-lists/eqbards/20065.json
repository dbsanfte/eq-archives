I remember reading serveral posts about bards stopping mega-trains<br/>\ndead and killing off 15-25 mobs one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks after these stories emerged, it was nerfed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, an enchanter can keep multiple mobs under indeffinetly, but it is a<br/>\nsituation they have to put effort into to manage. They have to choose an<br/>\norder, they have to deal with targeting, they have to be aware of timing,<br/>\netc. etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nClarity, Aoe Stun, target, mez, target, mez, target, mez, target, mez,<br/>\nmeditate, target, mez, all in order, etc. etc. Is not the same thing as<br/>\nhitting one hotkey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Tue, 27 Jun 2000 14:02:22 -0600<br/>\n&gt; To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Another Lullaby question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I considered that argument and promptly rejected it after we ran a<br/>\n&gt; simple test.  The enchanter can cast Breeze on themself and keep a group of<br/>\n&gt; 4 mobs that are even cons, mezzed forever.  The resist rate isn&#39;t high<br/>\n&gt; enough to give them much trouble since it&#39;s below 10% and the mez lasts<br/>\n&gt; longer than it takes to med back the mana.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I then tried the same tactic with lullaby.  6 greater heals later I gave up.<br/>\n&gt; Lullaby met with about 40% success on the even cons.  That means it reduced<br/>\n&gt; damage by 40%.  Largo&#39;s reduces damage by 30%, is seldom resisted, and<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t stop reducing damage when someone smacks the target.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want 90% success.  If it worked 75%of the time on even cons at high<br/>\n&gt; charisma Lullaby would be viable.  Not as good as an enchanter by any means<br/>\n&gt; since it lasts 6 seconds, it&#39;s all you can do if you keep them mezzed other<br/>\n&gt; than swing waking up the one you are hitting.  It doesn&#39;t even begin to make<br/>\n&gt; enchanters obsolete.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its duration of one tick should be more than enough to balance it out.  Add<br/>\n&gt; a higher resist rate than enchanters and it would still be ok.  I certainly<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t recall anyone ever claiming it was ridiculously powerful back when it<br/>\n&gt; did work 85% of the time.  Nobody claimed that enchanters were made obsolete<br/>\n&gt; by this.  This song used to be very useful and got me into quite a few<br/>\n&gt; groups from level 15-18.  Since it has been broken I  have used it combat<br/>\n&gt; exactly 3 times.  I put it away in disgust all three times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Merck [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mmerck@...\">mmerck@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 27, 2000 12:01 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Another Lullaby question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the reason lullaby will never work to the degree we all want it too<br/>\n&gt; is simple - it would devalue the enchanter class to such a huge degree there<br/>\n&gt; would hardly be a need for them. It would be so hugely unbalancing that VI<br/>\n&gt; will never make it work the way it seems it should.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; An AoE mez that doesn&#39;t require mana, doesn&#39;t require targeting, allows you<br/>\n&gt; to melee as well and crowd control with no effort, risk or thought other<br/>\n&gt; than hitting a single hotkey is just too powerful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the same reason they nerfed 54 chains.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe what people should do is offer suggestions about how to balance the<br/>\n&gt; song in a different way other than having it not work 90% of the time. Like,<br/>\n&gt; make it cost mana for each pulse or make it effect the bard as well as the<br/>\n&gt; mobs, or make it a single pulse song instead of a constant one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; After looking over the Lullaby data again while posting a huge<br/>\n&gt; sledgehammer<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of a question hit me over the head.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Why does Lullaby have a secondary resist???<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop online together.
