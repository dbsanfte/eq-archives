But, if your<br/>\nsong pulses on him while his target is cleared, the target gets set to you<br/>\nand then the repopulation of the target from the top of the hate list fails,<br/>\nso the mob attacks you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRndBard: &quot;Doesn&#39;t that mean it&#39;s a bug?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nVIEmployee:  &quot;Well, we&#39;re not sure.  We think it&#39;s working as intended, but<br/>\nwe can look into it later if necessary, it&#39;s just not a high priority right<br/>\nnow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Legba Work [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 13, 2000 10:30 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: /assist problem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a few people who include emotes in their assist keys.
