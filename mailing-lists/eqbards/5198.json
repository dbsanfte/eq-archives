While standing near<br/>\nthe zone border, I got messages similar to those you get in Unrest when<br/>\nstanding near the left wall.  For example in Unrest, you get the message &quot;a<br/>\nfestering hag casts a spell&quot; even though the hag is nowhere in sight but<br/>\ninstead underneath you in the basement.  I assume that means that the z-axis<br/>\nbug also exists in Mistmoore and that I should be very careful when singing<br/>\nare of effect songs like Denons Disruptive Discord.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone tell me which songs I should avoid like the plague while in<br/>\nMistmoore?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
