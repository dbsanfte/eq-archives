Sure he died quite a few times <br/>\n&gt; and many of them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;before anyone even heard of a lvl 49 res, but I spent days <br/>\n&gt; with very little<br/>\n&gt; &gt;exp movement after 45 or so. [The necromancer] on other hand <br/>\n&gt; has officially<br/>\n&gt; &gt;passed [the paladin]up exp wise. Get this in 29 days played, <br/>\n&gt; 4 of those<br/>\n&gt; &gt;camping Pyzin. I think I may have 1 or 2 days in group time, <br/>\n&gt; which cutts<br/>\n&gt; exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in half at least. That adds up to less than 25 days to go <br/>\n&gt; from 1 to 54 for<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;necro and 128 hard core cant leave your pc days for the <br/>\n&gt; pally.
