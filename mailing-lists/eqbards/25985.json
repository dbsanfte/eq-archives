I really don&#39;t care for raid <br/>\n&gt; level stuff, all<br/>\n&gt; hurry up and wait. Plus I finally got a new job and have to log at a<br/>\n&gt; reasonable hour. Being on EST, that means I have to go about <br/>\n&gt; the time we get<br/>\n&gt; really started in VT or wherever. Songs are the only thing I <br/>\n&gt; care about<br/>\n&gt; having though so it&#39;s back to grind, I suppose.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe 60 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Brilinia Ilsidi 54 wizard <br/>\n&gt; Brillinia Klagetsdautter 46 cleric<br/>\n&gt; Venator Sapentia, Xegony<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
