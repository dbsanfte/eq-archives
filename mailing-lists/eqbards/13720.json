A player (of any type) who jumps into battle with <br/>\nguns a-blazin&#39; and doesn&#39;t know when to back off is one of the more annoying <br/>\nplayer types to have to group with.  This is particularly true in any party with <br/>\na healing shortage.  By judiciously backing out when I start to attract too much <br/>\nattention, I&#39;ve cut my personal death rate enormously (5 in six levels, all due <br/>\nto other groups&#39; trains), which, IMHO, is a big benefit to any party.  If they <br/>\nhave to try to continue without me, or wait for me to return, it&#39;s a lot worse <br/>\nfor them than getting a bit less assistance from me in any one particular fight. <br/>\n (And it&#39;s more fun for me, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also learned to make more liberal use of:<br/>\n/g RUN<br/>\n&lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>\n&lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>\n&lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThose &quot;glorious&quot; everyone-down-to-one-bubble-surrounded-by-a-pile-of-dead-MOBs <br/>\nfights do not make up for the far more frequent 2-people-deads.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
