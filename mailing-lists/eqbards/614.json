I usually<br/>\nget 115-130ms over a cable modem, and am just shy of being<br/>\nable to keep 4 songs going (4th song effect expires an instant<br/>\nbefore it comes back).  Usually I keep three running.  A<br/>\nfriend playing over a modem can, like you,k do two reliably,<br/>\nbut not three.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually go with restoration, the anthem, and bellow, to<br/>\nminimize downtime between fights.  If I&#39;m soloing, I&#39;ll<br/>\nsubstitute the whistling warsong for the anthem since it also<br/>\nboosts your AC.  I only get 33% of the bellows, but you get<br/>\nthe other two effects 100% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, despite my good connection, I don&#39;t particularly like<br/>\nthat an external factor like connection speed could have this<br/>\nsort of impact on the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The increased speed<br/>\n&gt; DOES mean a lot, btw - much more than the increased str.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Has anybody figured out exactly what it is increased str does?<br/>\nAnd as I said yesterday, the speed boost for both the anthem<br/>\nand the whistling warsong do not stack, so there&#39;s less of a<br/>\nreason to use both together.

So when a monster<br/>\nstarts to flee, I will usually drop the other songs and use<br/>\nbellow repeatedly to kill it quick before it wanders into<br/>\ndangerous territory or brings back friends.  This should<br/>\nbecome moot though when I get the root song (level<br/>\ntwenty-something), or if a spellcaster in the party can root.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that&#39;s why I really like playing the bard.  Every<br/>\nlevel, you have to reassess your capabilities, reprioritize<br/>\nwhich songs to play, and modify your fighting strategies.  <br/>\nWith the fighting classes, you only do this every time you get<br/>\na new skill.  With spellcasting classes, you only get new<br/>\nspells every 4 or 5 levels.  (Lullaby, L15, is awesome by the<br/>\nway.  I&#39;ve already saved three groups that were being<br/>\noverwhelmed by multiple monsters.  Just fire up the song and<br/>\nput the ones they aren&#39;t fighting to sleep.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
