My guild has fallen in love with City of Mist this week (after past","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1360392941\">Since I have given up ever getting mez again, I have moved on with<br/>\n(Dark)Elfson Allegro.  My guild has fallen in love with City of Mist this<br/>\nweek (after past affairs with Dalinars and Kaesora).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo last night we actually had no enchanter (not usually an issue for us as 3<br/>\nof our 20ish 35+ players are enchanters).  So our group is 45 warrior<br/>\n(puller), 42 Wiz, 42 Druid, 35 Druid, 36 Shaman, and our hero (43 Bard).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were able to handle 3 and even 4 pulls with little trouble.  Pretty<br/>\nsimple too, Warrior beats (and taunts) the biggest mob, while I sing<br/>\nbeserker and target the second biggest mob (takes a little time to figure<br/>\nout which one I should charm), I hit charm and back up a few steps.  When I<br/>\nhave my pooky charmed, I hit Binding, which agros at least one of the extra<br/>\nmobs on me.  This causes my pooky to hit him, and I back up a bit more.<br/>\nThey fight each other, while I restart beserker.  (repeat cycle as needed,<br/>\nthough it easier to target my pet now).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis leaves us with either the warrior eating 2 mobs or he and I each eating<br/>\none.  Either case is fine...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this is going, wiz and higher druid are blasting the day lights out of<br/>\nmob1, and it quickly falls. Leaving us with an easily handled 3 mob pull.<br/>\nBy the time mob two has been dropped by the warrior/wizard/me (druid then<br/>\nlays off and saves mana for heals), mobs 3 and 4 have beaten each other down<br/>\nto like 2/3 of their original life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhack whack whack...<br/>\n<br/>\n4 mobs dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is nothing innovative or paticularly difficult going on here.  I<br/>\nlearned most of these techniques on this mailing list.  Was it ideal?  No,<br/>\nbut when is life in Norrath ideal?  (Ok maybe when you hear the<br/>\n&quot;Cleric/Warrior/Enchnater/Rogue/Druid group looking for a bard to explore<br/>\nthe depths of Dungeon_MegaLoot&quot; shout and are the only bard in the zone).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is life in Norrath goes on without lullaby.  And without an<br/>\nenchanter in your group.  Most every group would like to have one, and you<br/>\nlose some of the every important xp/time ratio without one.  But the same<br/>\ncan be said for warrior and cleric also.  Maybe this is a bigger drop off<br/>\nfrom enchanter to bard then from warrior to pally/sk or cleric to<br/>\ndruid/shaman.  But to be honest, I love grouping without enchanters.  My<br/>\nlife is pretty boring when the enchanter is there (I become a mana pump).<br/>\nWith no enchanter I get to do so much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I am sorry to see some of the old guard leaving, you guys have<br/>\ntaught me so much.  But you have to do what makes you happy.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
