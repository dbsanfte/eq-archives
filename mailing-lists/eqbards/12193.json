I made my first chocolate bar at a<br/>\nBaking Skill of 135 and it was trivial.  It&#39;s the toughie because Brownie<br/>\nParts are less common than hen&#39;s teeth.  Cake Rounds you make by getting<br/>\nyour Pottery Skill up.  The Birthday Cake itself was not trival at 135,<br/>\nalthough I did succeed in my attempts and made 6 cakes for a friend&#39;s<br/>\nwedding.  A rumored Wedding Cake recipe has never been confirmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun questing around to make those six cakes.  I spent literally hours<br/>\non them, mostly in tracking down Brownie Parts: &quot;/auc Buying Brownie Parts<br/>\n(yes, I&#39;m serious)&quot;  Then there are people that think Brownie Parts must be<br/>\nneeded for some quest and want 100pp for them like a Lambent Stone.  Haha..<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure they believe I&#39;m just making cakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Birthday Cake -<br/>\n1 Winter Chocolate<br/>\n1 Clump of Dough<br/>\n1 Frosting<br/>\n1 Cake Round<br/>\nCombine in Oven, makes two cakes<br/>\n<br/>\n- Clump of Dough -<br/>\n1 Snake Egg<br/>\n1 Milk<br/>\n1 Cup of Flour<br/>\nCombine in Mixing Bowl, makes one clump<br/>\n<br/>\n- Winter Chocolate -<br/>\n1 Brownie Parts<br/>\n2 Frostings (separate slots)<br/>\nCombine in Mixing Bowl, makes one bar<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier &quot;Sarah Lee&quot; Sharpsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
