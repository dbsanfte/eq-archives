I camped the room with a pickup group of<br/>\n35-45 lvl players (they only let me join if I would<br/>\nplay manasong 24/7 -- and I always try to play<br/>\nrequests &lt;g&gt;) -- for what it&#39;s worth, they were a<br/>\ngreat group of players.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\nEven just singing manasong, my group was amazed at how<br/>\nmobs aggroed me.  I was careful but still died a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several ways to get to the undead side, find<br/>\nthe main entrance (with the ramp) that all the<br/>\nregulars use.  It is listed as &quot;7&quot; on the upper guk<br/>\nmap from eqatlas. All the navigation info posted is<br/>\nfrom that point.  If you haven&#39;t been thru Guk yet,<br/>\nit&#39;s confusing the first few times you go in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMine was a 6 hour camp. Maximumeq lists the spawn time<br/>\nof the assasin at 29 minutes (in the comments<br/>\nsection).  But that is incorrect (and my wife is very<br/>\npissed off at me this morning for all the time I spent<br/>\ncamping that thing...)  Point here is, have a pot of<br/>\ncoffee on, you may be luckier than me, but the assasin<br/>\nis a rare spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy several invis to undead potions, take 2 with you<br/>\nand leave the rest in the bank...bind at the bank in<br/>\nFP and run SOuth thru Ro, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmediately upon zoning in, do an ooc asking if the<br/>\nassasin room is camped.  Then ask if you can approach<br/>\nand loot.  I did this and the group holding the room<br/>\ntold two people arriving there before me that the mask<br/>\nwas for the two bards trying to fumble their way in.<br/>\n<br/>\nTorel:  if you are reading this, I would have let you<br/>\nloot the mask first if you hadn&#39;t logged.  I was a bit<br/>\npissed that you logged and then came back after I died<br/>\nas many times as I did in that room: but you did win<br/>\nthe loot roll and you did say you were coming back.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting to you all,<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes, manapump of Rodcet Nife<br/>\nCharismatic, Dark Elf Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nKick off your party with Yahoo!
