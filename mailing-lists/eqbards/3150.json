Perhaps there is a way - and I just missed it, do we ever get to <br/>\n&gt;weild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one weapon and an instrument?  I could have sworn I saw a higher<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing just this once, but could never get it to equip. I figured<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I might be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to do this once I got dual wield, but if there is one that lets us <br/>\n&gt;do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it, I&#39;ve not found it yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I used to get questions about this all the time when I carried a mino axe<br/>\n&gt;and a drum or mandolin.  You CAN carry a weapon and an instrument at the<br/>\n&gt;same time, the problem is you can&#39;t use the weapon in a conventional way.<br/>\n&gt;Before I got dual wield I would put my mino axe in my range weapon slot and<br/>\n&gt;my intrument in my secondary mellee slot.  This gave the appearance that I<br/>\n&gt;was carrying a weapon and an instrument.  Too bad the only way I could use<br/>\n&gt;the weapon would be to throw it at that point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On a related note, have any of you bards used throwing skill at all? I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;found it to be a collosal waste of money so far, but maybe I am doing it<br/>\n&gt;wrong. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Attention ONElist list owners.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;We&#39;ve just added a &quot;NO ATTACHMENTS&quot; option.
