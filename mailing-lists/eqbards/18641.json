The mage who gave the<br/>\ninformation said that he hadn&#39;t actually clicked them to see if they<br/>\nworked, but it looked like they might and he&#39;d check for me and let me<br/>\nknow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve already said too much, does that mean a forage or two near<br/>\nKurn&#39;s tower where the burynai seem to live would do it?  <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.           <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
