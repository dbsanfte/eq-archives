No resist messages - just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take place.  I was close enough to the Mountain to get hit by it -<br/>\nbut he was far enough away (due to Height Obviously) to be immune to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I recall using Screech many levels ago against one of the &quot;oon&quot; named<br/>\nOgres (I forget which one) in my mid 20&#39;s - and it worked nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I think this is a problem we should have Verant look into.
