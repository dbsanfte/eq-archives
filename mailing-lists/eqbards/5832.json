If everyone is SoW&#39;ed, I don&#39;t have to wait<br/>\naround for everyone else to leave first, so I am at less risk.<br/>\nI&#39;m finding this to be more important now that I can&#39;t tank as<br/>\nwell as the other true tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will still keep Accelerando memorized and the drum ready<br/>\nthough.  The obvious use is for unrooting people.  But another<br/>\nuse is that SoW walking is barely faster than monsters.<br/>\nAccelerando with a drum while walking is significantly faster.<br/>\nSo if any of your party is down to a bubble or less and is<br/>\nwalking, you can use Accelerando with a drum to give him<br/>\nenough speed to escape without getting hit from behind 3-4<br/>\ntimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
