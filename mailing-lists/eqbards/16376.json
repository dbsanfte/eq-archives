(Not that it hurts that bad for us, with Safe Fall)<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you fight Maestro, Resist Poison + Purifying makes all the<br/>\n  difference.  Otherwise, he will actually heal himself in battle<br/>\n  to the point where your life is fading quicker than you can <br/>\n  knock him out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lifetap is dangerous, it&#39;s not a one-way street like AE breath<br/>\n  weapon is.  In a DragonBreath attack you lose health, but in<br/>\n  the AE Lifetap attack Maestro is tapping all 24 or so players<br/>\n  for several hundred hp.  Each time that&#39;s many thousands of hp<br/>\n  you as a group lose, and he as an indiviual gains.  Well, no<br/>\n  sh*t... hehe, that&#39;s what a Lifetap is anyway, but most people<br/>\n  see their hp dropping and don&#39;t realize that you are beating<br/>\n  up an NPC who now has 1/3 of the life of all your tanks added<br/>\n  to his own hp.<br/>\n<br/>\n  An unprepared group is likely to see Maestro gain hit points<br/>\n  in battle, as he picks people off one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Reso, Shield of Words, Naltron, Resist Magic, Resist Poison, <br/>\n  Stamina, Tuna, (augment + other various shaman buffs on tanks)<br/>\n  should be all you need.  You as the bard need to supply the<br/>\n  additional resist poison and another song of your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maestro can tap for up to 2 bubbles (1800 hp) with no resistance.<br/>\n  He could only get 0.25 - 1.00 bubbles with (2400 hp) and 120ish<br/>\n  poison resist, depending on how close you are to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Food for thought.  Some of this is just a reminder, nothing new.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
