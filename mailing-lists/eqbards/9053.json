The lizards and basilisks are<br/>\nmajor green to me and run away, and the pathing bugs make them<br/>\nimpossible to chase.  So I&#39;d just charm a gaint and tow it<br/>\naround, ordering it to kill these guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, one more thing.  Because of the pathing bugs and slow<br/>\nupdates (mobs blink in and out even with 0% PL), it&#39;s very<br/>\neasy to accidently attack something someone else has already<br/>\nattacked.
