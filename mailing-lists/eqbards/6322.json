I had a<br/>\n100 agility and an AC of around 200 or so when I got my first agility<br/>\nboosting item.  Going from 100 to 102 with no attached AC bumped my AC up by<br/>\n9 points.  Not sure if there are bonuses at points past 101, but I would<br/>\nimagine they get spread out at that point.  I checked with a new character<br/>\nand 101 is definitely better than 100 and 110 is no different from 101.<br/>\nCould not add enough points to reach 111 so could not check that, will try<br/>\nwith a halfling rogue to see if bonuses really do continue past 101, and<br/>\nwill report back on Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi the agile?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 10, 1999 2:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dex vrs Agility<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Sep 09/99, Naeeldar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Agility is great for all classes. Most importantly agility directly<br/>\neffects<br/>\n&gt; your armor class which allows you to get hit for less damage and fewer<br/>\n&gt; times. Agility should always be priorited in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople keep saying this but I don&#39;t find it to be true. I tried tonight<br/>\nwith my serpentine bracer. AC 1 AGI 9. I put it on and my AC went up 1.<br/>\nIt does affect how often you get missed but has _no_ effect on AC, which<br/>\nis how much damage you take when you do get hit. As I can&#39;t tell a<br/>\nsignificant difference in the amount I get missed between 100 and 130 I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth giving up AC for agility beyond that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBETA TEST expertcity.com&#39;s new online, real-time, technical support service!<br/>\n   Let our live experts help you with your computer now.
