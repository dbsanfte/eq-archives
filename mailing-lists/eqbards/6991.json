More chances to hit<br/>\nonly lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>\nlikely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>\nthing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>\ndeviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>\nyou&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>\nas more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.

The higher dmg weapon is better than the faster<br/>\nweapon when the dmg ratio are the same.  I used to used a Demon claw and a<br/>\nSilver war axe.  That was fast.  But now that I have the crystalline blade<br/>\nand the black enamel mace I find the later weapons a lot more efficient.  I<br/>\nhave no scientific facts except that with the Crys blade and mace the MOBs<br/>\nseems to hate me a lot more than when I was fighting with Claw and axe.<br/>\nSame mob at same lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\nBad Apple, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
