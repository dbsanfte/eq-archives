There&#39;s an <br/>\niksar marauder camp over by the zone to Trakanon&#39;s Teeth as well as a <br/>\nFroggie camp hidden down a corridor (up on the right hand ledge heading <br/>\ntowards the marauder camp). Just don&#39;t attack Dugroz as he&#39;s an almost <br/>\ninvincible NPC needed for the Howling Stones quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe zone is real close in case anything goes wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen that started greening out, we started pulling froggies from near the <br/>\nfrog city, and when we got bored with that, we fought near where the Ton <br/>\nWarrior for the enchanter&#39;s iksar illusion spell spawned (right around the <br/>\niksar bandit camp close to the Field of Bones zone).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a great area because frequently we were the only ones in the zone.
