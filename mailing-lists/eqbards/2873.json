Thanks!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for the Elfhide Gloves in Upper Guk. These are the +5 Agi and<br/>\n+5 dex gloves useble ONLY by Bards and Rogues. I was TOLD that they are on<br/>\nsomeone named &quot;The Warden&quot;, who is supposedly the Warden of the jail cells<br/>\nin Upper Gukk. My group camped there for QUITE a long time this evening and<br/>\nnever saw him once. Does anyone know exaclty where he spawns? Is there some<br/>\nsort of trigger? We kept seeing Knights and Warriors, but never a Warden.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are ALSO looking for the trollhide belt. Again, I was told this SAME<br/>\ninvidual bears it. Is this true? If not, who has it, and where? And of<br/>\ncourse, is this ALSO a Bard/Rogue only item?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHANK YOU for any help you can provide!<br/>\n<br/>\nTim - Tallonn - Bertox<br/>\nmy e-mail:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timandmary@...\">timandmary@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
