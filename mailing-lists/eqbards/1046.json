Apparently the bardic class was VERY powerful in beta<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and had to be toned down but I am thinking maybe it was toned down in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;areas that made it too powerful and forgotten about in the areas it is<br/>\n&gt;very &gt;weak in.  Am I totally off base?  I mean why give me the capability<br/>\n&gt;to have &gt;skills I will never be very good at?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Paladins also do not get dual attack.  It&#39;s what makes a warrior<br/>\n&gt;special.  Remember, we can even wear plate (which I personally think is a<br/>\n&gt;mistake.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) cf. JOAT (Jack of All Trades, Master of None.)  We can do a lot of<br/>\n&gt;different things - but we will never be the masters at any one of them that<br/>\n&gt;the class we&#39;re borrowing them from is.  Rogues will always be better<br/>\n&gt;lockpickers, sneakers and trap disarmers. Monks will always fall better<br/>\n&gt;than we can.  Rangers will always forage better.  And Warriors will always<br/>\n&gt;fight better.  It is not in a single thing that we are great, but that in<br/>\n&gt;all things we are good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt;Check out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s finally here!
