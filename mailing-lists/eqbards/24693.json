The first time ended<br/>\nwith him getting a slightly upper hand and me accidentally hitting the zone<br/>\nas I began to kite him  (He had 1/2 hps and I was down to 2 bubs).  That<br/>\nparticular tactic was to fire up the SS bracer shield, then just let SoS<br/>\nrun.  He was doing devcent damage, but nothing bad (unless he did a special,<br/>\nand that would get through) so I was able to absorb quite a few of his blows<br/>\nwhile he beat himself down on my shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I zoned back, and watched a 51 bard trounce him, I gave it another<br/>\nshot, this time leading off with a Cahin, getting a small distance away and<br/>\nthen firing off a song I thought I would never use... Dirge.   It scared the<br/>\nbejeezus outta him when he saw his hps drop by 400+ in one shot *eg*  By the<br/>\nend of this fight, he was down to one bub of hp, while I had only lost 1/2 a<br/>\nbubble  (level 49 bard vs. level 52 monkey, gotta love it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy that time, his SoW had worn off, so I just started running around<br/>\n(non-Selos&#39;  lol!) and DoT&#39;ing him until he yeilded, then did the Zone of<br/>\nShame (made the pretty &quot;Barrd won!&quot; spam when he hit the zone ;o)  )<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it&#39;s a massive drain on us, in a duel, never count out Dirge ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bill Costlow&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 10, 2001 2:43 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] dueling a druid<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn preparation for this weeks guild event: duelmania, I got silly and dueled<br/>\nmy wife last night.  She is a 40th lvl druid and I am at 41.<br/>\nI was curious about how my songs would work -- here&#39;s what I discovered:<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiflorious motion dispels root every time.<br/>\nDenon&#39;s dissention does work, but not well enough to use in a duel<br/>\n(**There is a potential psych factor tho -- maybe combining it with an<br/>\n&quot;emote /e drains mana from %T&quot; and /cast &lt;song #&gt; would work...)<br/>\nFear is resisted alot and pixie strike too -- my wife&#39;s MR is 57.<br/>\nanti magic aria is a great song<br/>\nchains is a great song, in spite of numerous resists (great psych factor)<br/>\nNever dismiss the effectiveness of guardian rhythms and a drum<br/>\nBellow is a great song<br/>\npunching interrupts casting<br/>\n<br/>\nBest overall tactic of the night turned out to be:<br/>\n<br/>\ndrums equipped, twist GR, chains and anti-magic aria to debuff (she had 9<br/>\nbuffs up for each of our 11 duels...)<br/>\n(Most druid spells bounce with MR over 120 but DRONES OF DOOM usually landed<br/>\nand was difficult to for me to dispel.)<br/>\nOnce chained, I was able to punch and interrupt spells<br/>\nOnce damage shields and most buffs are off, druid is also LOM by this time<br/>\nEquip weapons and commence to thrash.<br/>\n<br/>\n Note<br/>\n<br/>\nDispelling DOTs can be a real pain with targeting, singing, retargeting,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend setting up a social key:<br/>\n<br/>\n/stopsong<br/>\n/stopsong<br/>\n/target &lt;yourname&gt;<br/>\n/cast &lt;song number&gt;<br/>\n/target &lt;opponent&#39;s name&gt;<br/>\nThe nice thing about this social is your opponent is very quickly retargeted<br/>\nso you can immediately resume punching/dismembering them.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
