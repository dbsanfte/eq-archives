And lullaby/nod is no exception. I think<br/>\n&gt; every time nod pulses the mob has to make a savings <br/>\n&gt; check to see if it resists or not. Assume we have a<br/>\n&gt; spell caster that resisted it, and then it begins <br/>\n&gt; casting. If the casting does not take more than 6 <br/>\n&gt; seconds, there is no chance that nod will be able to <br/>\n&gt; interupt it. Since NPC casters do not suffer the same<br/>\n&gt; casting time limitations as PC casters do, most are <br/>\n&gt; able to get a spell off before the next pulse of nod <br/>\n&gt; and hence can cast without being interupted. However,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes when the mob resist nod, it attacks first and<br/>\n&gt; then cast. When this happens, the attack and the casting<br/>\n&gt; might not be complete within 6 seconds so when nod pulses <br/>\n&gt; again and the mob fails the savings, then it is nodded<br/>\n&gt; and it&#39;s casting is interupted. This is what I seem to<br/>\n&gt; observe a lot. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I noticed something even more annoying yesterday while helping a friend<br/>\nfight the necro at the fear portal. I was chaining and fearing here,<br/>\nand even while running in terror she was still able to cast spells. If<br/>\nyou&#39;ve ever been feared you&#39;ll know this is completely impossible for a<br/>\nPC character.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
