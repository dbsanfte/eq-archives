My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>\n&gt;&gt; assertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Paladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>\n&gt;&gt; types, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>\n&gt;&gt; time thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>\n&gt;&gt; levels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spread the damage around quite well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I used to be in groups like this back in the early days in Cazic before<br/>\n&gt;rubicite fever swept the servers. Usually we&#39;d have a group of whoever<br/>\n&gt;showed up, and it was commonly all melee/hybrid types as the casters<br/>\n&gt;were all still in Unrest. It can be quite effective and quite fun. You<br/>\n&gt;get to use songs you wouldn&#39;t normally use.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do the same right now.. Hunting in CZ and often in straight Melee/Hybrid<br/>\ngroups, and I must say its much more fun than being grouped with a bunch of<br/>\ncasters that is used to soloing and thus burns all their mana in the start of<br/>\nthe fights which only results in two things:<br/>\n1. Lots of downtime because of them medding<br/>\n2. They get bashed pretty good by the mobs until we (tanks and semi tanks) can<br/>\nget em of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffcourse there is nothing that beats a well balanced group where people know<br/>\nhow to work together, but a straight melee/hybrid group is much easier to get to<br/>\nwork together and with little downtime.<br/>\nThere is vitually no downtime and when people knows when to taunt and when to<br/>\nback off - Hymn with a mandoline heals a massive amount of health each round..<br/>\nFurther more our speedup songs really get to show their worth (Currently using<br/>\nAnthem the Arms).  One group I have been with in CZ resently constisted of:<br/>\nranger, SK, SK, warrior and me (Bard) we all ranged from 30 to 35. We pulled to<br/>\nCY from pool and had virtually no downtime.. It got even better when a Cleric<br/>\njoined us :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum bard of the 30th song, Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fran6.com/Divine_Light/\">http://www.fran6.com/Divine_Light/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
