I started with both of these<br/>\n&gt;as a Wood Elf, seems nice maybe.  First, I never bother with hide anymore.<br/>\n&gt;I used to when I could Con an enemy to tell if I was hidden or not.  Now,<br/>\n&gt;there&#39;s just no way to be able to know if I&#39;m hiding.  I fail hiding a good<br/>\n&gt;2/3 of the time it seems, so any situation where I&#39;d need to hide is not<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt;where I&#39;d risk attempting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re better off than a human or half elf bard in both Hide and Forage.<br/>\nYou start capped at 50 with your inate skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most a non wood elf bard can get in Forage is 40, and only 35 in Hide. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
