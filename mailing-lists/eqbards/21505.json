The Cantana/Nivs/Mana<br/>\n&gt;song combo is so powerful, it&#39;s almost always the &quot;best&quot; thing you can do.<br/>\n&gt;Unfortunetly we are all too used to being effective in a variety of ways,<br/>\n&gt;not just one way. Even if you melee while singing the &quot;battery&quot; songs, you<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t scratching the mobs. Test it, fight a certain number of fights<br/>\n&gt;meleeing and not meleeing. You&#39;ll percieve absolutely no difference in<br/>\n&gt;outcomes. So You might as well just turn on your gamepad macro and go watch<br/>\n&gt;a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well, the outcome in 99.9% of the fights is the same, i (and my group) win.  for<br/>\na while last night our monk was linkdead.  we continued fighting.  the outcome was<br/>\nthe same every time (we won).  does that mean that monk melee is meaningless?<br/>\nand what about the 90% of the population who don&#39;t get to 55 and don&#39;t get cantana?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Sure, we still shine in broken, unbalanced groups, but those very same<br/>\n&gt;groups can&#39;t really &quot;get anything done&quot; in kunark.
