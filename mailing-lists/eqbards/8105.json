I was to do exactly what is in this<br/>\nmessage<br/>\nthen I decided that sharing this and asking for advice (or approval)<br/>\nwould not hurt since we are talking several 100pp for the jewelry<br/>\nand equipment. If you need to know<br/>\n<br/>\nI use 2 Barbed Leather Whips (delay 28 damage 7) and sometimes<br/>\nthe Dragoon Dirk. I can&#39;t afford Platinum jewelry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this is based on the best of my knowledge. Hope this could<br/>\nhelp others too although creating and choosing our own stuff is cool<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\n================================<br/>\nOk first AC versus STATS<br/>\n================================<br/>\nShould we base our armor on AC or stats? I decided to go<br/>\nwith the Bronze but I loose a little bit of stats while weighting more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe armor I own and can wear:<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nSmall Bronze: Helm AC 10, Bracers AC 7, Chest AC 17, Arms AC8,<br/>\nLegs  AC 10, Boots AC 8 and Cloak AC 8<br/>\nAbove = Good AC (about 75) and Looks but heavy (about 45).<br/>\n<br/>\n-OR-<br/>\n<br/>\nSmall Banded: Helm AC 8, Bracers AC 6, Boots AC 6 Cloak AC 7<br/>\nDwarven Ringmail Tunic = AC 12 and 7 against Heat/Cold/Magic<br/>\nBarbed Legplates = AC 8 and 2 AGI<br/>\nBarbed Armplates = AC 7 and 2 DEX<br/>\nAbove = Less AC (about 54) but more stats and weight less (about 28)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther example: Thick Leather Apron AC 8 weight 1<br/>\n               or Troll Hide Belt AC 5 but 5 STR 5 STA<br/>\n<br/>\n=================<br/>\nSTATS<br/>\n=================<br/>\nMagic stuff on me:<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\nElf Hide Gloves = 5 DEX 5 AGI<br/>\nBloodstained Mantle = 3 STR 10 Magic<br/>\nDragoon Dirk = 2 DEX 3 Magic (I leave it in the range slot)<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon I will buy this:<br/>\n--------------------------------------------<br/>\nTroll Hide Belt = 5 STR 5 STA (need to buy one, around 200pp ??)<br/>\nBlack Iron Crown  = 5 STR and plus 5 to P/D/M/C/H (300pp ??)<br/>\nBracer of Erollisi = 5 AC 5 STR (40pp ??)<br/>\n<br/>\nSilver Star Ruby Veil = 5 DEX 5 CHA<br/>\nGold Opal Necklace = 9 STA 6 AGI<br/>\nElectrum Sapphire Earrings = 4 STR 2 INT (*2)<br/>\nGold Star Ruby rings = 7 DEX 5 CHA (*2)<br/>\n<br/>\n(The Electrum Star Ruby rings = 5 DEX 7 CHA could be good too<br/>\ninstead or the chosen rings to have 4 more CHA and minus 4 DEX)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Base Stats plus the added stats based on Bronze armor set:<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSTR 85 + 26 = 111 (more loots so less overweight + help with weapons a<br/>\nbit)<br/>\nSTA 70 + 14  = 84 (good to improve HP, I think this will give me 14 HP<br/>\nmore)<br/>\nAGI 95 + 11 = 106 (Better at dodge and take less damage / improve AC)<br/>\nDEX 90 + 26 = 116 (hit more, play better, 112 with Electrum Star Ruby<br/>\nRing)<br/>\nWIS 80 +  0 = 80 (I don&#39;t feel I need this and 80 is not too bad)<br/>\nINT 80 + 4 = 84 (Help learn skill faster, so what if it takes longer)<br/>\nCHA 85 + 15 = 100<br/>\n(Since I&#39;m not sure CHA is that important I decided to had some just in<br/>\ncase.<br/>\nUsing the Electrum Star Ruby Ring would give me 4 CHA more for 104).<br/>\n<br/>\nPoison / Disease 15 + 5 each<br/>\nCold / Heat 25 + 5 each<br/>\nMagic 25 + 10 + 3  = 38<br/>\n<br/>\nAny comments is welcome and I would like to see what other people<br/>\ndid at different level. Send it to me in private if you don&#39;t want to go<br/>\n<br/>\npublic ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nThe Anonymous L20 Bard.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
