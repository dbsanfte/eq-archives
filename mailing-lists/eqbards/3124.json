Racing her with no songs or spells, she still outruns me.  So we<br/>\n&gt; compared pings & packets & such.  No big differences.  We compared modems.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got a 56K that usually connects at 28.8, the druid&#39;s got cable modem,<br/>\n&gt; but has run EQ on a 28.8 and had no problems then.  Then we compared PCs.<br/>\n&gt; Mine&#39;s a P300 MMX, 64 MB RAM, 16 MB on the video.   The druid runs on dual<br/>\n&gt; 200s with 194 MB RAM and a similar video card.   Grrr.  Guess I&#39;ll have to<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless EQ is specifically written to take advanatage of dual<br/>\nprocessor systems, she is running EQ at the same speed as a<br/>\nsingle P200 system.  The other processor is sitting idle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat resolutions are you two running at?  Also try turning<br/>\ndown some of the display options and special effects.  I heard<br/>\nturning off 3D sound makes a big difference, although you lose<br/>\nthe ability to hear something sneaking up on you.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, on a related note, apparently you&#39;re not supposed to be able to do<br/>\n&gt; this, but in playing around we managed to stack SOW & Accelerado.  The<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; time we could get it to work though was when Accelerado went into the<br/>\nsecond<br/>\n&gt; space and SOW in the third.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another related note, has anyone else noticed that if<br/>\nyou&#39;re playing Accelerando on a drum and you zone, when you<br/>\ncome out the other side you default to Accelerando-w/o-drum<br/>\nspeed?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
