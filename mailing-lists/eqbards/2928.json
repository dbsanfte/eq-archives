My system is pretty high<br/>\nend (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>\ngot the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>\noff (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>\nfrom twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>\nRiva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>\nspeed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>\nwith lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that really irks me about this is that it&#39;s a client<br/>\nside problem.  The determination that &quot;you haven&#39;t yet<br/>\nrecovered&quot; to sing another song is completely client side, and<br/>\ncompletely dependent on the speed of your system.  When I had<br/>\na P200 with a Voodoo 1, it took ages for the song buttons to<br/>\nun-grey when I stopped singing.  When I upgraded to my current<br/>\nsystem, it was almost instant, except as noted above when lots<br/>\nof spells are flying.  I would prefer to be able to turn off<br/>\nthe button un-grey animation sequence and suffer a flat time<br/>\ndelay which doesn&#39;t change with CPU speed.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
