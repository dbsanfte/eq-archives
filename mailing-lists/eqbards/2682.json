I&#39;m not likening them to any of the real <br/>\nlife gypsy people, I&#39;m viewing them in a more fantasy RPG frame of mind and <br/>\nthat suggests to me that they should be freewheeling, cavorting, <br/>\nhappy-go-lucky types (much like Bards are), and they can indeed remain <br/>\nextremely powerful, vicious, psychotic bastards (much like Bards are). That <br/>\nwon&#39;t interfere with my perception of them in Verant&#39;s setting. But man, <br/>\nit&#39;s just frustrating that none of them *talk*. I dislike all these silent <br/>\nNPC&#39;s, some places are kinda spooky from the absence of talking NPC&#39;s... <br/>\njust ghostly images moving around at random, never uttering a sound... <br/>\nstaring at me with those expressionless eyes framed in a perpetually angry <br/>\nface, mouths slightly open like guppies... giving them the impression  of <br/>\nmindless thugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd wouldn&#39;t it be cool if the Gypsies moved around sometimes? One day <br/>\nyou&#39;re wondering where the hell your unfriendly neighborhood Combine <br/>\nsupplier is, next day you see them settling down at the other end of a <br/>\nzone. Funky indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as far as Bards are concerned I feel they should warm to us for being <br/>\nso similar to them in nature. Plus they could drop juicy quests on us and <br/>\nONLY us. That&#39;d really make us hated by other players ;) But it&#39;d at least <br/>\nmake up for the lack of Bard -specific quests. I don&#39;t feel right saying <br/>\n&quot;Yes I am a follower of Tunare/Rodcet Nife/Bluntman&quot; to whichever NPC I&#39;ve <br/>\ncarillioned this time in order to get some FedEx quest... it&#39;s fun <br/>\nsometimes, but I&#39;d so much prefer a Bard-specific one. Which Bard quests <br/>\nexist now anyways? As far as I know we have:<br/>\n<br/>\nWood Elf spider silk chick<br/>\nQeynos Guard Reports<br/>\nQeynos sing Thornless Rose to girl IN FRONT OF HER FATHER (!) even after <br/>\nbeing told not to and suffering NO repercussion for doing so (thankfully) - <br/>\nis this Bard-only btw?<br/>\nQeynos/S Kar fix Lute (over-and-over even when it&#39;s supposedly in the other <br/>\ndude&#39;s hands for a week)<br/>\nN/S Kar Flute lady (is this Bard-Only? I cheated on this btw, didn&#39;t manage <br/>\nto get her to give me the keywords but the quest still &#39;worked&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\nZassit? Found nothing in Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nKilling an NPC in Mistmoore to get her lute might be viable, but a) <br/>\neveryone can do it and b) killing something to get loot (ooh, pun) isn&#39;t <br/>\nreally a quest as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo are there any that I&#39;m missing or is this it? Rather disappointing, I <br/>\nknow it&#39;s been said time and time again on different bulletin boards and <br/>\nmailing lists, but I&#39;m feeling a little &#39;bleah&#39; about playing EQ and have <br/>\nbeen doing other things with my time. It&#39;s such hard work not dying <br/>\nrepeatedly... I must suck at EQ ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nS&#39;right,<br/>\nDud<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tJames Schuldes [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tTuesday, June 29, 1999 3:53 PM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Source for Combine Weapons<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think there is a gypsy camp in Lavastorm - with combine blunts<br/>\nthere?
