I normally play these songs during<br/>\ndowntime to relieve the cleric of curing duties.  Up until last night, I<br/>\nwould get a message...&quot;You have been cured of your affliction&quot; or something<br/>\nlike that each time my song successfully pulsed against poison or disease,<br/>\nand after a few successful pulses the poison or disease would drop on group<br/>\nmember Soandso.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell last night I never saw that message, and no group member ever was cured<br/>\nby my song.  I am just wondering if you guys have noticed the same thing?<br/>\nIf any of you are in a position to quantitively test this over the weekend,<br/>\nplease do so so we can get a bug report submitted ASAP if it is in fact<br/>\nbroken.  The possibility is also that my group was unresponsive to me, and<br/>\nit is simply the success message which is broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
