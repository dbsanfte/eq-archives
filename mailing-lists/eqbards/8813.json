My guild &lt;Fervir&gt; had an event vs.<br/>\n&lt;Nox Aeris&gt; today on the Innoruk Server.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically the two guilds went to war and then we chose a person to race<br/>\nfrom the Arena in Lake Rathe to West Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got nominated, 22nd Level Bard(go figure), and Nox Aeris put up a 24th<br/>\nlevel Shaman. (little did i know 24 is the level where you get Spirit of<br/>\nCheetah)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we take off, and it is a tie at the Rathe Mountain zone. Both our<br/>\nguilds have ambushes set up along the way (i planned to twist Rhythyms<br/>\nwhen i got in trouble to up my magic resist). Then the Shaman pulls<br/>\nahead of me for a second... but then he has to stop and cast SoC again<br/>\n(i have heard it lasts 30 seconds). I catch up to him, and pass him,<br/>\nthen he passes me again... then has to stop to cast again... and i pass<br/>\nhim and never see him again. i got a report at South Ro, that he was<br/>\nright behind me (that was where our ambush was set. Both sets of<br/>\nambushers (ours and theirs) said &quot;i saw him for a second, but could not<br/>\ntarget him, much less cast a spell&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time I entered West freeport, the shaman had just zoned into into<br/>\nEast commons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my guild won, thanks to the bard speed. It was quite a shock to the<br/>\nother guild since I strutted around like a warrior with my PGT and BLW<br/>\nall morning, just for their benefit, only breaking out my drum and song<br/>\nwhen they said &quot;GO&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
