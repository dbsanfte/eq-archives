To start off I remember when I finally reached<br/>\nlevel 6 and got hymm of restoration, I was  a hot commodity in just about<br/>\nany group.  However now that I am at lvl 16 no one seem to want a bard in<br/>\ntheir party.  Perhaps it is because of my hunting in unrest, but I would<br/>\nthink a bard would be a useful addition to any party there.  However, it<br/>\nseems a bard&#39;s utility is my undoing.  People either want a tank, or a<br/>\nhealer or a burner and I can never be any of them.  Many parties seem to<br/>\nforget the advantages of some of the bard songs.  With anthem, my friend a<br/>\nlvl 14 Druid and I were able to mow down Tormented after tormented with<br/>\nnext to no downtime.  In fact my friend rarely cast a spell because the<br/>\ntwo of us could melee the TDs without too much trouble.  I was armed with<br/>\na Combine Long Sword and he a runed Totem Staff.  Now I can imagine how<br/>\neffective Warriors would be with Dual wield and dual attacks and all tanks<br/>\nin general.  Does partying get worse from here on out?  I have started a<br/>\nmage and had more luck partying at level 13, than I did with my bard which<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make too much sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin - Karana - 16th level Bard<br/>\nAlariel - Karana - 13th level Magician</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
