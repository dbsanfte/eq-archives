(They said somthing like we could just make<br/>\na world where all zones are lower guk, oasis,... etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWas that comment really that far from a good idea?  In EQ they have<br/>\ndecided that fun over rides reality in mud terms.  As opposed to UO<br/>\nwhich tries to be more real (in my opinion less fun).  We have the tell<br/>\ncommand, auc channels, guild channels, group hp bars on screen all<br/>\ntimes, a consider command.  Thats a few reality based things we have<br/>\ntraded off to gain more fun (or ease of play).  I like every one (and<br/>\nwould make a few more if I was king of Norrath).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy dont they make a copy of the overcrowded zones?  For example Lower<br/>\nGuk 1 and Lower Guk 2.  Carbon copies which you chose which one you go<br/>\ninto when you zone (Or make a second zone entrance, I dont care).<br/>\nProgramming wise this would be a breeaze, it would require more<br/>\nhardware, but they need hardware for new servers anyway.  Perhaps<br/>\nCrushbone, Lower Guk, Solusek B, Oasis would be the important ones to<br/>\ndouble up.  Since Naggy should be unique (in their thinking, this will<br/>\nbe more of a problem in about a month when he will never be alive for<br/>\nmore than 30 minutes), perhaps he&#39;s only in Solusek B1.  Maybe if they<br/>\nwanted to really do something fun, they&#39;d make a third dragon (nagy&#39;s<br/>\nbrother) for Solusek B2.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould anyone be offended by this?  It would help to bring their dungeon<br/>\ncrawl vision to reality, and I am willing to sacrafice a little more<br/>\nrealism for a lot more fun (IMO)...<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
