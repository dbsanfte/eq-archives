If I&#39;m singing Selo&#39;s and someone tries to<br/>\n&gt; cast SoW on a group member, it won&#39;t stick.  But if I stop singing,<br/>\n&gt; and then they have SoW cast upon them, and then I start singing again,<br/>\n&gt; the rest of the group gets Selo&#39;s, while the person SoW&#39;ed keeps his<br/>\n&gt; SoW.  So assuming enduring breath works in the same way, if group<br/>\n&gt; members get enduring breath cast on them before the bard sings his<br/>\n&gt; song, they should be using the spell, while the bard is using the<br/>\n&gt; song. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
