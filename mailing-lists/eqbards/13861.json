Another thing I would change is the AI so<br/>\nthat if you attack a named social mob, it would aggro nearby<br/>\nmobs regardless of whether or not they&#39;re &quot;afraid of&quot; (green<br/>\nto) you.  Likewise if you attack a green mob near a named mob,<br/>\nthe named mob would aggro, causing all other nearby mobs to<br/>\naggro.
