I currently wield the following weapons:<br/>\n<br/>\nStaff of Wriggling<br/>\nObscene Scimitar<br/>\nObscene Shard<br/>\nDragoon Dirk<br/>\n<br/>\nAs my piercing skill is not maxxed yet (it&#39;s in the 120&#39;s) I alternate<br/>\nbetween weapons depending on the situation, so if I am in a group of 6 that<br/>\nare doing fine I whack the piercers in, if it gets hairy I swap back again.<br/>\nI am only doing this so that I can eventually dual wield the Staff and<br/>\nshard (Proc&#39;s galore). The Dirk stays in my range slot unless I am<br/>\npracticing piercing.<br/>\nWhat we need is a top quality piercer that is better that the shard, ok the<br/>\nshard is a good weapon but I find it gets resisted far too much, in Cazic<br/>\nit has a 40% resist rate, don&#39;t know if this is because my skill is not<br/>\nhigh enough or what but it&#39;s not great. And 30 dmg isn&#39;t a great deal<br/>\nconsidering a monk can kick for 80+ every 5-10 seconds. I prefer the look<br/>\nwhen I dual wield piercers though, the so called ugly stick and simitar are<br/>\nwell out of proportion for a small woodelf bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only good piercing weapon I know of is from the Plains, I believe it is<br/>\nthe Martune Rapier???<br/>\n<br/>\nBards/Rogues are similar classes so I don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t let us wield<br/>\nthe same weapons. However I can understand Rogues getting more choice of<br/>\nweapons as they do not have the choice of any other weapon skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Sonweaver, Bard of 33 Songs - Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt; on 12/01/2000<br/>\n02:04:16<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\ncc:    (bcc: John Senior/M&G)<br/>\nSubject:  [eqbards] Bards and piercing weapons (was  GZ Answers)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a semi-related topic from this thread.  I was thinking about<br/>\nincluding a condensed version of it in my post I intend to write as part of<br/>\nthe &quot;ArchMage answers everything bards want to know&quot; thread on the official<br/>\nEQ board.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to any of the EQ spoiler sites and look at all the piercing<br/>\nweapons in the game, you&#39;ll see that a lot of them are Rogue only.  Now I&#39;m<br/>\na firm believer that every class should have weapons that only they can<br/>\nwield, but it seems to me there are a disproportionate number of rogue only<br/>\npiercing weapons in the game compared to the actual number of people who<br/>\nplay rogues.  Lets also take into account how many classes actually use<br/>\npiercing weapons.  Other than rogues, bards are about the only other class<br/>\nin the game that equip piercing weapons on a regular basis.  A ranger here<br/>\nand there may use them but most rangers I see use 1HS weapons.  You almost<br/>\nnever any other class using them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to see is either: 1) some of the rogue only piercing<br/>\nitems<br/>\nchanged to where bards can equip them or 2) more piercing weapons<br/>\n(appropriate for 25-35 level characters) added to the game that a bard can<br/>\nequip.  The counter argument is that bards have a wide variety of 1HS, 1HB<br/>\nand piercing weapons already in the game that they can use.  True.  But<br/>\nsince bards and rogues traditionally resemble one another, IMO it only<br/>\nmakes<br/>\nsense that we can both use the same weapons.  Also, a lot of bards,<br/>\nespecially those who are wood elves, have a very low Stamina stat.  As a<br/>\nresult, I prefer to wield light weapons with fast Delay rates to avoid the<br/>\nstamina drain.  Most piercing weapons fall into this category.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I smoking crack here thinking there aren&#39;t enough medium level piercing<br/>\nweapons in the game for bards to use?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci (still wielding a dragoon dirk since around 10th level)<br/>\n30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  You can do a /who all bard count, /who all rogue count, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get numbers for all the non-anonymous players on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; server.  The bard, rogue, and shadowknight have consistently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yielded the lowest numbers on the two servers I play on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
