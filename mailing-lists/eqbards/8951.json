I wonder who at V has the job of buffing & twinking<br/>\nthem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - it&#39;s my belief that the color con is firstly and indicator of how<br/>\nmuch xp you will get if you win the fight - NOT any indication of how hard<br/>\nthe fight will be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese guys (Dvinn, Dorn, etc etc) have huge magic resists and some really<br/>\nuber-buffs.  At 32 I cruised through N Ro and some lev 15&#39;s talked me into<br/>\nbouncing Dorn.  Man was I glad to have their help!  That little inkie took<br/>\nme down below half HP.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a lot of resists.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that - resists to chains - and I think all song spells have to pass<br/>\nthe &#39;random&#39; resist test.  Gnoll pups in Qeynos will resist me - so there is<br/>\na test that is not level difference based.  maybe you hit a bad clump in the<br/>\nRnd generator (random number.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 33rd song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tGreg Gillan [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GGillan@...\">GGillan@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, October 20, 1999 2:05 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Resist on chains gotten worse<br/>\nlately?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Greg Gillan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GGillan@...\">GGillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWell, I was chaining SG&#39;s last night no problem.  Maybe 1<br/>\nresist in about 50<br/>\n\t\tattempts.

I<br/>\n\t\tfired up chains.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.<br/>\nResist.  5 resists<br/>\n\t\tbefore it took.

I<br/>\ndecided to go see<br/>\n\t\tif I could kill some hill giants in W Commons and while<br/>\nlooking ran<br/>\n\t\tacross Kizdean Gix. He attacked dispite being 20 odd levels<br/>\nbelow me and<br/>\n\t\tI fired up chains intending to chain and fear him. Hmm. 8<br/>\nresists in a<br/>\n\t\trow. After killing him and determining there weren&#39;t any<br/>\nhill giants in<br/>\n\t\tthe zone, I happened to spot some big wisp spawns and killed<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n\t\tAgain, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist<br/>\nrates gone up<br/>\n\t\ton chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much<br/>\ntrouble last<br/>\n\t\ttime I played my bard.
