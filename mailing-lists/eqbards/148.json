At 7th level, your max","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1563058257\">I don&#39;t know for certain if the following is true but I have read in other<br/>\nplaces that your singing ability has an impact on this song. At 7th level,<br/>\nyour max singing ability should be around 40.  As you singing ability<br/>\nincreases higher than 40, the effects of this song should also increase.<br/>\nCan&#39;t confirm this because I&#39;m only at 6th level.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume this holds true for many other songs as well.  Does anyone out<br/>\nthere know for certain.  If I am incorrect, then what impact does singing<br/>\nability have on songs?  Does it decrease the monsters ability to resist the<br/>\nsong?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I have noticed.  The time it takes to scribe a song in your<br/>\nspellbook increases based on the level of the song.  For me (6th level),<br/>\nmemorizing Chant of Battle only takes a few seconds but memorizing Hymn of<br/>\nRestoration takes about a minute.  This can be a pain in the butt since,<br/>\neverytime you get killed, you have to rescribe your spells.  Right now its<br/>\njust an inconvenience but what happens when you get higher level songs?  I<br/>\nassume, and hope, that as your singing ability increases the time it takes<br/>\nto scribe songs in your spellbook proportionately decreases.  Can anyone<br/>\nprovide a definitive answer?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I&#39;m on the soapbox, why did Verant make it where merchants and<br/>\nguards attack you if you sing Chords of Dissonance in their vicinity?  I am<br/>\na wood elf from Kelethin.  I obviously bear no ill-will to the merchants and<br/>\nguards of Kelethin.  They sell me goods and protect me from the evil orcs of<br/>\nCrushbone.  But here is what happened to me the other day.  I was mucking<br/>\naround the orc camp south of the entrance to Crushbone attempting to rid the<br/>\nforest of the orc infestation.  I was going solo and was in the process of<br/>\nfighting an orc centurion.  I was singing the Chords to help dispatch the<br/>\ncenturion.  I almost had him finished off when a guard spawned behind me.<br/>\nHe immediately killed me and then killed the orc cent himself.  To say the<br/>\nleast I was quite upset.  Guildmaster, guards and merchants /con red to me<br/>\nso it would be stupid if I attacked them on purpose.  It seems to me that<br/>\nthese type of NPCs should be unkillable in the first place.  If I kill a<br/>\nguildmaster then how will other players train?  I would be willing to bet<br/>\nthat they are unkillable, even by high-level players.  If they are<br/>\nunkillable by players, IMO the Chords of Dissonance should have no effect on<br/>\nthem whatsoever and they should not attack PCs singing it.  Am I justified<br/>\nin my opinion on this? Dissenting opinions are appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nBard of the 6th Circle<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tReedo [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:reedo@...\">reedo@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, April 21, 1999 3:52 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Chant of Battle and Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just hit level 7 and purchased Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong because I do<br/>\n&gt; a lot of soloing.  I memorized and started it up and to my disappointment<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t notice a great skill boost.  In fact it only gave me 2 more<br/>\n&gt; strength than the Chant of Battle and didn&#39;t give me any dex bonus.  Is it<br/>\n&gt; really worth using.  Even if I have both songs going at the same time I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t notice any difference in my fighting ability.  I seem to do better<br/>\n&gt; if I just keep playing the Hymn of Restoration.  Am I missing something or<br/>\n&gt; did I just waste my platinum?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Ardon, Level 7 Bard, Cazic-Thule </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
