Bards are warrior/casters (if you equate<br/>\ncasting to singing).  And with the mix of song types, they are a hybrid of<br/>\nmany different casters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As a result, they get magic<br/>\n&gt; plus superior battle skills.

It isn&#39;t even<br/>\nclose.  Bards are much closer to Rangers than Clerics in combat abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; then perhaps we can get a<br/>\n&gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To make up for it?  Bards have many advantages over the other hybrids in<br/>\nmagical abilities.  Name one other hybrid that can do damage in all these<br/>\nways: DD, AOE DD, DOT, Damage Shield.  Bards can increase just about every<br/>\nstat and resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards might be less combat worthy compared to other hybrids, but they have<br/>\nmuch better spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
