But it&#39;s NOT possible to<br/>\nhave 5 up at once all<br/>\nthe time. Do the same thing with 0 time between songs, you&#39;ll go from 4 to<br/>\n6, but you&#39;ll always<br/>\ndrop back to 4. And 0 time between songs is impossible. At some point<br/>\nbetween 0 and 1 second<br/>\noverhead time, it becomes impossible to maintain 4. That assumes no missed<br/>\nnotes.&nbsp; And<br/>\nclearly, that fractional difference of less than a second may well be due to<br/>\nconnection and<br/>\ncomputer power, and have nothing to do with the competence of the player. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to APPEAR to get 5 up all at once is to twist in the BoH. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow for sure, but I<br/>\nsuspect the Epic and the Siren&#39;s Song also blink when they proc, so they may<br/>\nmake it SEEM as if<br/>\nthe Bard is singing 5. Charm and Mez last 4 pulses, Anglitsch&#39;s Assonance<br/>\nlasts 10, so they can be<br/>\nused to bump things up. You can with proper ordering and timing of songs,<br/>\nand the right weapons,<br/>\nhave 8 effects up at once for about 1 second, then it comes tumbling down<br/>\nlike a house of cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also suggest that the only way another player would KNOW that a Bard<br/>\nwas twisting 5 was if<br/>\nthe Bard was singing 5 buff songs, and I challenge you to come up with 5<br/>\nuseful non-conflicting<br/>\nbuff songs that are worth the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, Virtuoso (possibly retired) of Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS, I went to the BotB and I had trouble keeping 3 up. We beat a pretty good<br/>\nteam in the first<br/>\nround, too. Twisting 4-5 was only possible for me when I was sitting in one<br/>\nplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS, I&#39;ve been able to consistently maintain 3 songs (I know from checking<br/>\nlogs) even in<br/>\nconditions (such as NToV) where I was receiving text messages 15-30 seconds<br/>\nbehind the event they<br/>\nwere referring too. This is possible because the outgoing information in EQ<br/>\nis about 1/10th the<br/>\nsize of the incoming, and the outgoing info is pretty much a steady stream,<br/>\nas opposed to the huge<br/>\nbursts you get on incoming. So I would never rely on the screen timer. Nice<br/>\nand rhythmic, just<br/>\nlike a percussionist, is the way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
