They &quot;stole&quot; players from all the other guilds when<br/>\n&gt; they were formed. Good ones. And they have never done anything (as<br/>\n&gt; a guild. Individuals within Paradigm are fine. Others are idiots at<br/>\n&gt; personal relations) that has made the other guilds want to forgive<br/>\n&gt; them. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
