I decided to<br/>\ntest<br/>\n\t\t  them each out, again, for kicks.  Maybe Verant adjusted<br/>\nthem<br/>\n\t\t  during the last patch, I thought.  Or not.  heh.  The<br/>\nnormal<br/>\n\t\t  lute, the gypsy lute, and the LotGP all did 17 hp recovery<br/>\n\t\t  with Hymm.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  Maid showed up (fangless) so we handed the wreath to<br/>\nanother<br/>\n\t\t  friend.  And the Butler never did spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  I also died in the attempt, when Ms. Davassi surpassed all<br/>\n\t\t  level boundries and charmed my druid friend who was oh...<br/>\n\t\t  20 freakin levels higher than her.  Damn cheating NPCs.<br/>\n\t\t  Needless to say, a level 50 druid casting starfire on you<br/>\n\t\t  will knock the stuffing out of you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  You feel the gaze of the heavens. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  (translate:  You just lost 3 bubbles of health)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  In the current situation, deep in the castle, running was<br/>\n\t\t  a bad idea, so I found my little corner and waited for the<br/>\n\t\t  last starfire to hit.  One death is worth the lute to me.<br/>\n\t\t  Plus we got a variety of other trinkets, AND I got a cute<br/>\n\t\t  screenshot of me as a dead wolf.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t  You can even make $$$ in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n\t\t&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click<br/>\nHere&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n\t\tPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
