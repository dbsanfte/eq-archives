In an equivalent amount<br/>\nof time, my friends and I can currently rake in about 20-30pp<br/>\nof loot killing general mobs.  If someone wants to charge me 5<br/>\nhours of loot for an item that takes me 2 hours to get myself,<br/>\nI will just get it myself in 2 hours and spend the remaining 3<br/>\nhours enjoying the dirk and earning money for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think you guys need to make Dvinn a rarer spawn, or<br/>\ngive him a different weapon most of the time instead of the<br/>\ndirk.  The availability of the dirk is out of proportion to<br/>\nthe other special weapons in the game at that level.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
