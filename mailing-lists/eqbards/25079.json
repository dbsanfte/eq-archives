Great to hear everything worked out so well!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While we&#39;re on the topic of hardware...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you decide to buy an Intel P4, you&#39;re most likely gonna <br/>\n&gt; be happy...if,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that is, you don&#39;t mind spending more.  Historically, Intel <br/>\n&gt; processors are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more expensive than AMD processors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And a bit more reliable (less out-of-the-box failures with Intel)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aye, Ive been an avid Intel fan, but do this still count? I know before K7<br/>\nAMD had pretty lousy stability and QA. I havent heard about any problems<br/>\nwith k7 series though??<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Additionally, if you select Intel P4, you will be required to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also purchase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a new type of memory (RAMBUS - if my memory serves...heh).  <br/>\n&gt; This memory is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much, much more expensive than the typical memory you see <br/>\n&gt; advertised today<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (eg: $65 for 256MB RAM).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yeah, RAMBUS is much more expensive, however, Intel is <br/>\n&gt; working with it&#39;s own<br/>\n&gt; and 3rd party motherboard manufacturers to get SDRAM and DDR <br/>\n&gt; SDRAM (double<br/>\n&gt; data rate) mobo&#39;s working w/ P4, last I heard, expect them to <br/>\n&gt; be out before<br/>\n&gt; Christmas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the meanwhile NVIDA is working on their own chipset (according to toms<br/>\nits a byproduct of X-box) which among other nifty things doubles the<br/>\nbandwith to the memory (using DDR):<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/mainboard/01q2/0106041/index.html\">http://www.tomshardware.com/mainboard/01q2/0106041/index.html</a><br/>\nThis mainboard is for the Athlon, btw..<br/>\nSo even if Intel makes the transition to DDRRAM they will still be hard<br/>\npressed to keep up with AMD in terms of raw performance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; The bottom line is, do your homework before you buy <br/>\n&gt; computers or computer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parts.  Pricewatch.com is an excellent source, and I have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Google toolbar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as part of my browser.  :)  Know what you&#39;re buying, and what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your money is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being spent on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, don&#39;t forget the &quot;arcane&quot; science of overclocking.  <br/>\n&gt; :)  With proper<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cooling, you can get an 800Mhz processor to 1Ghz.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Both pc&#39;s I&#39;ve tried overclocking have caused problems w/ <br/>\n&gt; Everquest.  PIII<br/>\n&gt; 600 overclocked to 800mhz, locks up after any 8 minutes in <br/>\n&gt; old world zones,<br/>\n&gt; any 3 minutes in Kunark, never tried w/ velious. AMD hrm...I <br/>\n&gt; think it was a<br/>\n&gt; 500 clocked to 675 or 700 or so...would lock up on ANY direct3d<br/>\n&gt; input/output.  Worked great if I never accessed anything <br/>\n&gt; using directx,<br/>\n&gt; though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah Ive dropped OC&#39;ing too. However my K7-600 Runs flawlessly at 1024x768<br/>\nwith a ASUS V6800 (GeForce I)<br/>\nIve had it running like 800, but it had very little visible impact on EQs<br/>\nperformance (My bottleneck is elsewhere).<br/>\nSo I pulled out some of the extensive cooling and clocked it back down hehe<br/>\n- The sound from all those fans drove me crazy anyway.<br/>\nMy next project is to build a quiet machine..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Feel free to email me directly for directions to the best (IMHO)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; overclockers info/support site on the internet.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you try this, good luck, hopefully better than mine :)  (a <br/>\n&gt; friend of mine<br/>\n&gt; has a piii-7xx(?), overclocked to 1.2ghz, plays all manner of <br/>\n&gt; 3d games, and<br/>\n&gt; loves it, he&#39;s also running 1gb of ram...and about a dozen <br/>\n&gt; fans in his case)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ugh Dosens of fans, Ill never go there again...<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
