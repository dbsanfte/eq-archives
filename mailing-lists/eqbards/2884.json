I was<br/>\nlucky enuf to acquire a pair of elf-hide gloves (thank you Lamont :)<br/>\nalready, and with no other Bards in my normal party, I think these would be<br/>\ngreat items to bring out and sell from our upcoming return to Guk.  I am<br/>\ncurrently &quot;trying&quot; to upgrade to Plate mail of some kind and am being<br/>\nextremelly unsuccessful finding any medium bronze for sale, anywhere.<br/>\nAparently the mobs in Permafrost that carry it are well beyond my current<br/>\nlevel (21).  So, that leaves me with the option of buying steel plate.<br/>\nOUCH!  Needless to say, unless Bronze starts showing up, I&#39;m gonna be<br/>\nneeding some heavy cash.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the idea of going to Cazic and trying to buy thrown away plate from<br/>\nplayers who have just found Rubicite....  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol - Xegony<br/>\n(wishing he went wood elf)  : )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;If anyone can help, you can either email me direct or post here with<br/>\n&gt;appropriate spoiler warning. Thanks!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am looking for the Elfhide Gloves in Upper Guk. These are the +5 Agi and<br/>\n&gt;+5 dex gloves useble ONLY by Bards and Rogues. I was TOLD that they are on<br/>\n&gt;someone named &quot;The Warden&quot;, who is supposedly the Warden of the jail cells<br/>\n&gt;in Upper Gukk. My group camped there for QUITE a long time this evening and<br/>\n&gt;never saw him once. Does anyone know exaclty where he spawns? Is there some<br/>\n&gt;sort of trigger? We kept seeing Knights and Warriors, but never a Warden.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are ALSO looking for the trollhide belt. Again, I was told this SAME<br/>\n&gt;invidual bears it. Is this true? If not, who has it, and where? And of<br/>\n&gt;course, is this ALSO a Bard/Rogue only item?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;THANK YOU for any help you can provide!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tim - Tallonn - Bertox </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
