Its the casters<br/>\nthat tend to be less valuable and the tanks that really count.<br/>\nCasters tend to get highly resisted at planes/dragons so do relativly little<br/>\ndamage.  High level warriors can hit for 100&#39;s and critical for 200&#39;s and<br/>\nthat kind of damage adds up.  Its always the tank group that gets the dragon<br/>\nkill, and its always the gurlee casters that get thrown into a group with a<br/>\ndruid or shaman to fend for themselves if there&#39;s no extra clerics to waste<br/>\non them.  <br/>\nOf course, we wouldn&#39;t even be able to get into PoS or PoH without wizzies,<br/>\nso I guess they&#39;re good for something ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn 50 Bard<br/>\nTarukin 32 Monk<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

If all the caster classes were suddenly removed from the<br/>\ngame would it still be playable at all?  I think not.  Removing all the<br/>\nhybrid and melee classes on the other hand would make the game much harder,<br/>\nand maybe make some mobs impossible, but otherwise the game would still be<br/>\nplayable.  To me that on fact is the ultimate statement of proof that the<br/>\nclasses are absolutely not balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
