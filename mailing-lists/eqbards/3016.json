Since it takes less time to<br/>\n&gt; stop and restart a song than waiting for it to pulse, you<br/>\n&gt; could in theory heal your group faster if you were to stop and<br/>\n&gt; restart Restoration every time it pulsed, instead of just<br/>\n&gt; letting it play and waiting for the next pulse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Incorrect actually. Restoration is not a healing song, but rather a song<br/>\nthat increases HP regen. It, like all other bard songs, lasts for 10 seconds<br/>\nfrom it&#39;s start. It does not heal on the pulse, the pulse just happens to be<br/>\nwhen HPs are updated. So starting and stopping Restoration does nothing to<br/>\nincrease it&#39;s effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this does mean is twisting Restoration is a very viable option:<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s consider low levels where Restoration without a stringed instrument<br/>\nincreases the HP regen rate of a standing character from 1 HP a pulse to 3<br/>\nHPs a pulse. Greg the Warrior and Peter the Bard are in a group. Greg the<br/>\nWarrior has 150 HPs total. He takes damage down to 110 HPs. Peter the Bard<br/>\ntwists as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nRestoration, Anthem, Elemental (who knows why these three). Let&#39;s imagine<br/>\nGreg the Warrior is not taking any new damage during the combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nPulse 1 (with Restoration): Greg&#39;s HPs 113<br/>\nPulse 2 (with Anthem): Greg&#39;s HPs 116<br/>\nPulse 3 (with Elemental): Greg&#39;s HPs 119<br/>\nPulse 4 (back to Restoration): Greg&#39;s HPs 122<br/>\nPulse 5 (with Anthem): Greg&#39;s HPs 125<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg the Warrior&#39;s HPs continue to go up without needing a &quot;pulse&quot; of<br/>\nRestoration because Restoration is not a healing song, but a HPs regen rate<br/>\nincrease song.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
