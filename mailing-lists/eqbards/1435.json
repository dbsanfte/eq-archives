He does anything but spawn regularly. He know<br/>\n&gt; longer follows the 6 hour schedule, and at times he won&#39;t spawn for 12<br/>\n&gt; or so hours, and then 3 times the next hour. I&#39;ve sat around, <br/>\n&gt; watch many<br/>\n&gt; fights(lost too many of them to nukers and high level <br/>\n&gt; people), and I can<br/>\n&gt; safely say there is no pattern. Even the captain formula(don&#39;t ask)<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work anymore. Getting one of these is pure luck. And <br/>\n&gt; yes, it is<br/>\n&gt; strange they spawn there.
