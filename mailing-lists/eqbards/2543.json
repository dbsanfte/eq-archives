There are four undead spawn sites there, as<br/>\nwell as the Shralok orcs site (around L15-20).  The undead<br/>\nsites tend to generate massive numbers of undead - I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nas many as 7 zombies spawn on &quot;one&quot; spawn point.  At lower<br/>\nlevels, you just Lament a bunch of them and pick one off at a<br/>\ntime.  If Lament fails, kick in Accelerando and run for a<br/>\nzone.  At higher levels, play with Discord and Dissonance to<br/>\nkill them all at once.  And the best part is, so many people<br/>\nhate Kithicor that there&#39;s rarely anyone there.  About the<br/>\nonly things you have to be careful of there are ghouls.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother odd thing I&#39;ve noticed is that only 4 or 5 undead will<br/>\nattack you at once.  The rest start to run towards you, but<br/>\nstop and stand (and sometimes even go back) once you&#39;re<br/>\nengaged by this many. When one dies, one of the standing ones<br/>\nruns in to take its place.  (If you have a friend though, it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stop them from attacking him.)  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s<br/>\nalways been like this with undead, or this is a recent change<br/>\nto cut down on obscene insta-kill trains.  As I&#39;ve mentioned,<br/>\nI once had a dozen orcs chasing me in Oasis.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
