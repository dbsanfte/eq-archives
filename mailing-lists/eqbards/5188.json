It was EXTREMELY frustrating, enough<br/>\nthat after two 3-5 hour nights of it (it wasn&#39;t one instantce<br/>\nof me being unable to get Selo&#39;s started) I quit my bard for<br/>\nalmost a week and played my enchanter instead.  When I finally<br/>\nplayed my bard again, the problem was *still* there.  I&#39;d been<br/>\nplanning on switching to my enchanter again, but my friends on<br/>\nmy bard server just got a guild started last night so I hopped<br/>\nin to join the guild and play a bit, and the problem was gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can normally stack 3 songs no problem, sometimes 4.  During<br/>\nthe time I was having this missed note problem, I could only<br/>\nkeep 2 song icons up consistently, and sometimes manage 3.  <br/>\nIt was that bad.  Running the numbers, at a 5% missed note<br/>\nrate, you should be able to play 3 songs without a missed note<br/>\n85% of the time.  With a 20% missed note rate (which was my<br/>\noriginal estimate, but I stated it as 10%-20% because I *know*<br/>\nthe mind has a tendency to overestimate these things) you can<br/>\nonly play 3 songs without a mised note 51% of the time.  That<br/>\nfits my observations of keeping 3 songs going, so my 20%<br/>\nestimate was probably pretty accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI minored in social and cognitive psychology in undergrad.  <br/>\nMy graduate thesis topic was a statistical analysis of data<br/>\nchannel capacity in high-latency high-loss environments.  I<br/>\n*know* the tricks your mind can play on you, and I *know* how<br/>\nit&#39;s easy to mistake statistically random data for something<br/>\nelse.  This was NOT my imagination, it was real.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
