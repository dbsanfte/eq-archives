It&#39;s not long now until 32 when you&#39;ll become<br/>\nevery caster&#39;s friend.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s excellent that you explored some of Lower Guk, it&#39;s a fun place,<br/>\nhowever, I&#39;d like to offer a friendly word of advice.  Go elsewhere until<br/>\nyou get 35th or so (Cazic-Thule, Rathe Mts., Mistmoore, Paw), because from<br/>\n35th up about the only places you can go routinely for experience are Lower<br/>\nGuk, Sol B and occassionally Mistmoore and Paw.  Believe me when I say that<br/>\nyou will get VERY VERY tired of these zones, and the earlier you start going<br/>\nthere the sooner you get tired of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to Mistmoore, I do have some tips for getting drums.  I don&#39;t have time<br/>\nto type it up and the moment (cause I&#39;m damn longwinded as we all know), but<br/>\nI will do so today and post what I know.  That&#39;s an interesting camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Adam Wasserman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi folks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This weekend was good to me as I finally hit level 30.
