I am certain that Lullaby no longer &quot;Nixes S. List.&quot;  I<br/>\nhave seen a noticeable change in the way this song behaves.  Grouped with a<br/>\nrogue, we made quite a team with this song and a backstab... no longer.  Try<br/>\ndueling the caster again.  I cannot see any melee class winning a duel with<br/>\na caster!

I dueled my level 21 wizard friend when<br/>\n&gt;I was level 19 and he was in serious trouble.  An initial cast knocked me<br/>\n&gt;silly for about 1 bubble of hp, but beyond that the battle degenerated<br/>\n&gt;into him trying to cast Fade and me slapping  him with a dragoon<br/>\n&gt;dirk/combine rapier while singing the lullaby.  If I had an off-hand<br/>\n&gt;weapon that alternated I probably would have done better then I actually<br/>\n&gt;did.  So we can easily stand toe to toe with casters.  BTW my friend was<br/>\n&gt;interrupted about 95% of the time between the lullaby and the smacking he<br/>\n&gt;was getting.  Mind you this was a while ago and Verant may have been kind<br/>\n&gt;enough to nerf us.  I have read a number of threads that claim bards are<br/>\n&gt;too powerful and that we need x song and x ability removed.  Another case<br/>\n&gt;of envy and lack of knowledge.  I don&#39;t know about all of you, but I have<br/>\n&gt;never felt overly powerful just extremely useful =).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt;Honour Guard, Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Mon, 2 Aug 1999, Roop Dirump wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I dueled a level 17 wizard using this technique and it just plain didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; work!
