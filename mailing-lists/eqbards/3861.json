I like computer games. I play them because they are fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2. I play Everquest a lot, because it is a hell of a lot of fun<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3. I play a Bard, because I think Bards are one of the most fun classesin<br/>\n&gt;the game. We can heal fast, run fast, root, lull, fear, charm, stun, buff,<br/>\n&gt;invis, find our corpse, sing some good damage, breathe underwater,<br/>\n&gt;levitate, cancel magic, track, and more. We get to wear the coolest armor<br/>\n&gt;in the game, and wield some good weapons and handle them pretty well. Being<br/>\n&gt;a bard is a blast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4. When I play Everquest, I want to have fun. If I am not having fun at any<br/>\n&gt;given time, I stop playing, or I go to another zone, party, etc.. Duh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5. Rubicite armor is probably the coolest armor that any of us have a<br/>\n&gt;reasonable chance of wearing. Having it would be really neat, and would<br/>\n&gt;definitely enhance the fun I have in the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;6. Rubicite armor is found in Cazic Thule, on a variety of reasonably rare<br/>\n&gt;mobs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;7. Cazic Thule is hell on Norrath. It isn&#39;t like each mob with Rucicite is<br/>\n&gt;camped by a single party in a room somewhere (like Najena for instance).<br/>\n&gt;No, most of the armor is camped by multiple parties, who have some sort of<br/>\n&gt;system for figuring out which GROUP gets the next loot of something that<br/>\n&gt;MIGHT have Rubicite. It is the silliest thing I have ever encountered in<br/>\n&gt;EQ, and I have seen a lot of silliness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;8. Getting a reasonable amount of Rubicite would require sitting in Cazic<br/>\n&gt;with a bunch of people who are constantly stressed about looting, and doing<br/>\n&gt;this for a LONG time . . weeks or MONTHS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;9. Number 8 is not fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;10. Verant&#39;s Biggest Mistake: To acquire the best items in Everquest, you<br/>\n&gt;must often be willing to have no fun. This is insane. This is nuts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Comments?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Books, music, auctions, and more.
