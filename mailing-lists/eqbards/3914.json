I don&#39;t have my water breathing song yet, <br/>\nand I have been wondering what&#39;s back there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanye<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;===== Original Message From <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> =====<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The water breathing song and it&#39;s possible uses was one of the big factors<br/>\n&gt;in playiing a bard for me. Now that I have it I have done some exploring<br/>\n&gt;(Everfrost river for one) but now I am looking for suggestions for new<br/>\n&gt;areas. Actually I would like to request folks offer little detail besides<br/>\n&gt;the zone (unless something is a deathtrap for a level 17, THAT would be<br/>\n&gt;appreciated) as exploring is 90 percent of the fun. Er, if it&#39;s OOT a<br/>\n&gt;general loc would be appreciated too, while I would LOVE to search the whole<br/>\n&gt;OOT I just don&#39;t have that kinda time *laughs*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any favorites folks have?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tszaaz D&#39;Kith, Scarlet Moon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Books, music, auctions, and more.
