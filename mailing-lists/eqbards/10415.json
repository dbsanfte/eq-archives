I was corrected. I <br/>\n&gt; know there have <br/>\n&gt; been petitions and letters sent to GZ and such, but I haven&#39;t really <br/>\n&gt; participated in any of them as of yet. Normally I just <br/>\n&gt; feedback any opinions <br/>\n&gt; i have on the game, but even as a write one I feel like I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; wasting my time. <br/>\n&gt; If anyone has a current petition why don&#39;t you add the skill <br/>\n&gt; cap and ask <br/>\n&gt; parry to be added to bards on it. =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Kelethin of the 50th Chorus<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
