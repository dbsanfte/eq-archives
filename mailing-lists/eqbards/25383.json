(Hope nobody from my guild is<br/>\nreading this!)  And again, I haven&#39;t played a bard on 40+ person raids.  I<br/>\ndo know that our main Necro switched to the bard character of someone who<br/>\nhad left the game (Iridis), and he is constantly amazed at how much more<br/>\nuseful bards are than necros in group raids.<br/>\n<br/>\n*shrug*<br/>\nMaybe its that we all just get bored after a while?<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana/Tani<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 9:59 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You mean 380MR when VI says the cap is 255 and anything over <br/>\n&gt; is wasted?<br/>\n&gt; Or the people who say they resist less with 350 than with <br/>\n&gt; 190?  With the<br/>\n&gt; first nag and vox raids when there was not a large variety of resist<br/>\n&gt; gear, sure bards helped a lot.  Today, anyone can easily buff their<br/>\n&gt; resists with equipment.  Tests are inconclusive as to what <br/>\n&gt; point resists<br/>\n&gt; are soft-capped (anywhere from 175 to 255).  Level is the <br/>\n&gt; primary factor<br/>\n&gt; in resisting.  Equipment gives you permanent resists and resists buffs<br/>\n&gt; from other classes stay on you whereas resists from bards are <br/>\n&gt; gone when<br/>\n&gt; they lag or die.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i.e. there is nothing amazing about bard resists except impressing<br/>\n&gt; others with big numbers, you haven&#39;t &quot;needed&quot; bards for resists in a<br/>\n&gt; long time.  I&#39;m only talking about need with your and Dark&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; arguments.<br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t need a bard for resists, you don&#39;t need a bard for DS (every<br/>\n&gt; person in an AL raid gets a diamond from the VP mage staff, DS done on<br/>\n&gt; EVERY person in the raid, not just 6 people in 1 group).  You <br/>\n&gt; only need<br/>\n&gt; 1 bard for OOS.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I agree with Dark about 6-man EXP groups.  Bards are incredible IF<br/>\n&gt; they are filling in the role of enchanter/shaman.  If an enchanter or<br/>\n&gt; shaman is there, there are things you CAN do, but the true skills of a<br/>\n&gt; bard are wasted.  On a big raid if there is more than 1 bard there,<br/>\n&gt; there are things you CAN do, but another class could help the <br/>\n&gt; raid much<br/>\n&gt; more.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Disclaimer: I loved my bard, always have.  I didn&#39;t quit <br/>\n&gt; cause of bards,<br/>\n&gt; was cause of RL.  I didn&#39;t come back as a monk for any reason, I liked<br/>\n&gt; how cured silk looked on humans, that&#39;s about it.  Ya I am 50 now I do<br/>\n&gt; love the monk but will always be a bard at heart.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada/Erisi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 7:00 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I totally disagree Shada, bards are very useful, imo on large <br/>\n&gt; raids, the<br/>\n&gt; resistances they provide alone are amazing...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
