Such a service could be set up for<br/>\nKelethin easily!  Just return to the docks every 14-16 game hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve escourted folks from Freeport to Qeynos before, and only last night<br/>\nthis foolish Lv5 mage wouldn&#39;t follow me through the commonlands properly<br/>\n(he seemed to trust the roads more than my experience).  This irritated me,<br/>\nof course, because he was wasting my time and taking an unnecessary risk.<br/>\nHe also disobeyed my instructions to -never- engage in any combat and was<br/>\nkilled in the Gorge.  There I was, tapping my foot and wielding a<br/>\ndrum--being wacked by three goblins, just waiting for him to run on ahead so<br/>\nI could follow.  No.  First he stood and watched a while as I screamed,<br/>\n&quot;GO!&quot; and &quot;Run!&quot;  He then decides to cast a few spells; I knew he was<br/>\ndoomed.   For this reason I would advise taking payments in advance (require<br/>\nat least half) and not making any guarantees to anyone&#39;s safety, stipulating<br/>\nyou can only make such a guarantee if the client follows your instructions<br/>\nEXACTLY!  Simply too difficult to save someone if they make it difficult for<br/>\nyou through sheer stupidity.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst rule should be, we are travelling and not fighting!  Perhaps insist<br/>\neveryone sheath their weapons even. Then explain that they will avoid<br/>\nanything as long as they don&#39;t stop, not to fear anything because they are<br/>\nfaster than any creature on Norrath.  So many people stop and nervously<br/>\nstare when they spot a Hill Giant.  They are safer if they just keep moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, May 07, 1999 7:19 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bard travelling services<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jyzan mentioned in an earlier post that during the beta, a few bards were<br/>\n&gt;offering their services to travellers wishing to speedily travel from<br/>\n&gt;Freeport to Qeynos.  They were charging 1-2 PPs per person.  That sounds<br/>\n&gt;like a great alternative for making some cash other than the standard trade<br/>\n&gt;skills and adventuring.  What does everyone else think?  Is this a viable<br/>\n&gt;way to make money?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am fairly new to the game and have not ventured anywhere other than on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Faydark continent.

I am also unaware of how long it takes<br/>\n&gt;for another class (at standard movement rates) to travel from Point A to<br/>\n&gt;Point B on the other continents.  Do you guys think that other players, in<br/>\n&gt;order to maximize their adventuring potential by decreasing travel times,<br/>\n&gt;would be willing to pay for this service?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If we agree this is a viable service, I was thinking that we could use this<br/>\n&gt;forum as a place to agree on standard service rates from Point A to Point B<br/>\n&gt;for each continent.  I will consolidate all the recommendations I receive<br/>\n&gt;and publish a list that everyone can use if they wish to perform this<br/>\n&gt;service.  Of course, like all other services, final prices would still be<br/>\n&gt;negotiable and subject to the supply/demand laws.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, in order to make this work, bards will have to start advertising the<br/>\n&gt;service to their fellow players.  Amazingly, I grouped with some guys the<br/>\n&gt;other day, all 8-10th level, who had never travelled cross-country with a<br/>\n&gt;bard before.  We started in Kelethin and went to the Mino caves in<br/>\n&gt;Steamfont.  They were amazed at how fast we got there.  Everyone made a<br/>\n&gt;comment they were glad to have me in the group.  They were even more<br/>\n&gt;gracious when we had to start fleeing from some Mino slavers:-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let me know what you think, both positive or negative.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin<br/>\n&gt;Bard of the 8th Circle<br/>\n&gt;E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to TOWERSHIGH, our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
