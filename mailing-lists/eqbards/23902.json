As a shaman you might say I&#39;m &quot;very valuable&quot; on a large<br/>\nraid.  Last night we tried Dain again (and failed due to HUAS &quot;Head Up A**<br/>\nSyndrome) and I did absolutely NOTHING.  Literally.  Halana is 59 = no<br/>\nfocus, no torpor, no malo... also she does not have a vp hammer, so my buffs<br/>\nare low level and mana inefficient.  Clerics have bp heals... and not even<br/>\ngonna SEE what happens if I try to slow Dain *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in my guild, bards are invaluable on large raids, but they become<br/>\nspecialists, twisting resists mostly... which probably feels like<br/>\n&quot;uselessness&quot; to a bard who is used to playing varied roles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think class value on a large raid depends on a combination of factors:<br/>\nlevel, class, and often, equipment.  In my opinion, Hybrids (including Bards<br/>\nhere) are made by their gear.    Give a ranger their epic swords and its<br/>\nlike the game has been reinvented for them.  Give a shaman her epic spear<br/>\nand *yawn* goodie, a mediocre dot... changes nothing.  Just a couple<br/>\nexamples from my limited perspective.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHalana 59th &quot;I hate Dain&quot; Shaman<br/>\nTani 45th Bard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 21, 2001 12:03 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 01:30 PM 2/21/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think that bards are probably over powered in the pre 50 <br/>\n&gt; game and under<br/>\n&gt; &gt;powered in the post 50 game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I see absolutely nothing in this patch that addresses EITHER of those<br/>\n&gt; &gt;beliefs. Furthermore, assuming that my personal belief is <br/>\n&gt; incorrect, I see<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nothing that does the opposite. Based on what I see in this <br/>\n&gt; patch, I have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;conclude that bards are perfect and all the other classes <br/>\n&gt; are being balanced<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to match them, only I&#39;m not seeing any reduction of power in <br/>\n&gt; the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;classes post 50, in fact, I&#39;m seeing modest improvements for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; bards are not really underpowered in the post 50 game imo.  they are<br/>\n&gt; only underpowered on large multigroup raids.  why is this?  because<br/>\n&gt; bards are best at being flexible and filling in the gaps of <br/>\n&gt; abilities not<br/>\n&gt; represented in the group.  generally in most well organized <br/>\n&gt; large multigroup<br/>\n&gt; raids, all abilities ARE represented, leaving little for the <br/>\n&gt; bard to do.<br/>\n&gt; i would say that bards are overpowered in most single group scenarios<br/>\n&gt; (even post 50) and underpowered in most multi group raids which seems<br/>\n&gt; as a whole compared to other classes to be overpowered.  paladins/sks/<br/>\n&gt; necros/druids/mages/rangers all are underpowered in the large <br/>\n&gt; raid type encounters.<br/>\n&gt; but they also aren&#39;t any more powerful in single group <br/>\n&gt; scenarios or unbalanced<br/>\n&gt; group scenarios either.  necros and druids are slightly <br/>\n&gt; compensated in that they<br/>\n&gt; can solo well for most of their careers if they choose to.  <br/>\n&gt; but the other hybrids<br/>\n&gt; seem to need some sort of enhancement.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
