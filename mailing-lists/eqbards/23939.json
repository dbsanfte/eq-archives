I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;memmed this song a few times in an attempt to find some song combination that could let me aggro the<br/>\n&gt;primary MOB; I have never once had it land for any damage.  It is always resisted.  Increasing zero by 25%<br/>\n&gt;still gives you, well, zero.  Even if this were utterly resist-proof (and as a once every 40 minutes<br/>\n&gt;&quot;desperate&quot; song, I think it easily could be), it still does so little damage on a high-end MOB that you<br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t see the hit bar move.
