Once again this list makes<br/>\nplaying a bard a pleasure! The information about twisting in the same digest<br/>\nwas great also. I am glad to read that others don&#39;t switch weapons and<br/>\ninstruments all the time during a battle. I have tried, but haven&#39;t been able<br/>\nto do it. I am still trying to do the instrument switch thingy to be able to<br/>\ndo instrument only fighting. Sometimes I think I&#39;m just a bit thick for not<br/>\nbeing able to master this so quickly. But when I read other people&#39;s posts, it<br/>\nmakes me feel a bit better.<br/>\n I thought it might be because I am slower than all you youngsters ( I&#39;m 51),<br/>\nbut now I see even some really agile younguns have a hard time! Thank you for<br/>\nmaking me feel better:)<br/>\n <br/>\nMoonspinner<br/>\nLevel 31(FINIALLY) Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.netscape.com/webmail\">http://home.netscape.com/webmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
