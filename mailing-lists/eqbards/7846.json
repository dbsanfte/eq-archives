So unless you do<br/>\nsomething to lower your faction with GuardiansoftheVale, if<br/>\nyou should accidently give your ring to Hendri before singing<br/>\nyour song and she won&#39;t give it back, you can just go back to<br/>\nthe marshall and get another ring.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know how to raise your faction with the clerics at<br/>\nRivervale so you don&#39;t have to use a faction raising<br/>\nsong/spell every time you want to recharge the ring?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
