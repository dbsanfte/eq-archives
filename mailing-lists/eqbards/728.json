I used the first<br/>\nlevel attack song alternating it mainly with the level 2 buff song when fighting<br/>\nin and around my home town of Kelethin.  Occasionally, when I run back to town<br/>\n(NEVER still singing my attack song), a guard will kill me for no apparent<br/>\nreason.  Maybe it thinks I attacked another PC if he or she happened to run by,<br/>\nbut I really don&#39;t know.  I fear that I have lost faction with my town, though I<br/>\nreceive no messages about it.  Shopkeepers now look at me apprehensively, except<br/>\nfor my guild of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, on to my question.  How much does a diety effect your actual abilities<br/>\nand inter-race relations?  I play a Wood Elf bard, and have enjoyed it immensly,<br/>\nbut chose my diety as Tunare for fear of fraction problems.  I roleplay my<br/>\ncharacter as a romantic, so naturally Erolisi Marr (sp?) seems like a good<br/>\nchoice, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effects on others.  Would love to hear from<br/>\nanother bard who has tried more than one diety perhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaeaus, Wood Elf Bard level...(sigh)...3</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
