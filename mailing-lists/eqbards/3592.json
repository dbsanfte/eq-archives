Go<br/>\nover that annoying plank bridge.  It&#39;ll open up into a room<br/>\nwith a square well-looking thing in the middle.  On the far<br/>\nright is a hallway leading down.  To the left of that is a<br/>\nshort passage which ends at a ledge with a plank leading down<br/>\ninto a large room.  Go into that room.
