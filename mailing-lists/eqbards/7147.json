Killed this, killed that, got this<br/>\ngot that, had goofy fun with a small group of folks. Which is all fine, but<br/>\nnot very creative sounding. Then on the very same day friends from Siege<br/>\nPerilous start sending me emails out of the blue...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all the thrill of EQ hunting, visuals, for all the total rockingness of<br/>\nthe Bard class...I am left feeling like I am not creating what I want to be<br/>\ncreating in an online world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn UO I raised huge armies (more than anyone else actually) got whole shards<br/>\nin an uproar, wrote a lot of story, all without one bit of help from OSI.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now once again I am off to Siege Perilous, where have gathered some of<br/>\nthe best story people from all the shards. The Imperium, The Sinful, the<br/>\nTemple of Monadain, Shadowclan orcs, the Mordain sisters and more. I go not<br/>\nto revive Tengu the Summoner, but to reinvent him. (Heeee! I just HAD to say<br/>\nthat *laughs*).<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the old stinky interface the old stinky spawn, the old stinky combat<br/>\nsystem...all those I can live with, but I can&#39;t live without large scale<br/>\ncreative community. And all the biggies of large scale creative community<br/>\nare on SP. So off I go. It&#39;s been a total blast, I will miss the Bard class<br/>\nmost of all...<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep your lutes dry and your blade polished.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin a.k.a Tengu</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
