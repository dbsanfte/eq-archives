If it is easier to accomplish <br/>\nthe same thing with two different tools, but is easier with tool A <br/>\nthan with tool B, then tool A is by definition more powerful than <br/>\nTool B.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy my definition, a gun is more powerful than a sword, because when <br/>\nused properly (ignoring the difficulty), the gun is more powerful.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re saying we should incorporate &quot;level of difficulty&quot; into the <br/>\nequation, not me.  Those saying &quot;Bards are overpowered&quot; are actually <br/>\nsaying it&#39;s not only harder with Tool A, but when used right, it&#39;s <br/>\nmore powerful, too.  You&#39;re saying Tool A is harder to use than Tool <br/>\nB, so Tool B is more powerful.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For an equal amount of effort, not skill necessarily, bards get far <br/>\n </span></blockquote>less return than other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m saying, &quot;Played to it&#39;s fullest potential Bards can do far more <br/>\nthan other classes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.
