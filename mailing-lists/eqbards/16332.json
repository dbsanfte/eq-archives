Too bad about all of the postings I <br/>\nread today (while wasting time at work) that stated that, when a guide was called <br/>\nin to a list room, his &quot;solution&quot; was for the list group to rotate spawns with the <br/>\nwalk-ins.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth this rule and the KSing rule are very badly written.  I should not have to <br/>\nrely on the mood of the guide that happens to be on at 4am on a Monday to decide <br/>\nwhether or not I&#39;m going to be warned for what is, to me, perfectly acceptable <br/>\nbehavior.  They should either write the rules to say what they mean, or they <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have the rules.  This &quot;we&#39;ll intrepret it on the fly, trust us&quot; attitude <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be acceptable from a company that has GOOD customer service.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 45.8 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff Illian wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Found this posted on EQ Vault from a discussion with Gordon:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sharing Spawns<br/>\n&gt; We do realize how long it takes.
