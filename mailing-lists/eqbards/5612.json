I explored a good portion of the<br/>\nbasement using it, then I spent a good 3-4 hours pulling from<br/>\nthe basement using the song to scout ahead before pulling. The<br/>\nsong most definitely still works against undead - I would con<br/>\nthem and they&#39;d be in different to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, sometimes the hags cast see invisible on<br/>\nthemselves and other mobs.  Or if you end up with a buggy mob<br/>\naggressive to you (which shouldn&#39;t happen anymore with the<br/>\nteleporting mob fix they put in), it and anything it alerts<br/>\nwill remain aggressive to you even if you&#39;re invisible.<br/>\nAnother possibility is that they changed the song so that the<br/>\ninvisibility to undead effect does not kick in until you reach<br/>\na higher level.  I&#39;ll have to as a bard friend that just got<br/>\nthe song to test it for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
