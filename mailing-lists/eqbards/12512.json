When I gave the<br/>\n&gt;quest components to Cyrissia (sp?), I got the breastplate, faction change<br/>\n&gt;messages, experience gain message,  etc.  I then noticed on the next line <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;the text window a message from Cyrissia saying &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting<br/>\n&gt;something?&quot;.  None of the words were bracketed as a key word/phrase.  I<br/>\n&gt;tried replying with variations of &quot;What am I forgetting?&quot; but got no <br/>\n&gt;further<br/>\n&gt;response from her.
