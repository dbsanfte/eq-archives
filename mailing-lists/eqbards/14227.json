I conned dubious at first and he told me nicely where the<br/>\n&gt;exit was. Carillon, with flute or without, would not raise my faction above<br/>\n&gt;dubious, and did not change his response. With sneak I got him to<br/>\n&gt;indifferent, but he still wouldn&#39;t sell. His response was different, <br/>\n&gt;though,<br/>\n&gt;saying that he doesn&#39;t talk to Half-Elves, much less sell to them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I may have lost faction a while back when someone pulled Krak down to the<br/>\n&gt;ramp and I whacked on him before I knew who he was. Think I was still in <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;zone when he died.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can still sell to centaurs, so no worries. Just curious about others&#39;<br/>\n&gt;experience with Krak boy and Carillon not doing anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Operaman<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 2 Feb 2000 16:48:18 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt;    From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Mask of Deception and ultravision<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Wed, 2 Feb 2000, Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You would sing carillon first before sneaking.

So if illusion+song results in higher<br/>\n&gt;than indifferent faction, it will be better than<br/>\n&gt;sneak+anything else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
