Eventually I moved to 2<br/>\nslashing weapons.  And now at 36, I&#39;m back to 2 piercing weapons :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBasically, once you hit 17, you&#39;ll be dual wielding the rest of your<br/>\nlife.  I don&#39;t know any bard that uses a shield (though it is possible)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDon&#39;t forget your 1h blunt also.  Mine is only about 120 now,<br/>\ninstead of 185 where all my others are.  It&#39;s just that to me, no 1h blunt<br/>\nweapons are really that good, so I haven&#39;t really botherd with it much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Ok, for those who missed the last post, I am a level 7, almost 8 bard.<br/>\n&gt; Right now I am using a regular Long Sword.  Not too dramatic..:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know I get dual wield at 17, and that sounds nice but I was wondering<br/>\n&gt; what it maxes out at and if its better to get dual wield for 2 1h slashers<br/>\n&gt; or to invest in a 2h slasher like a bibs?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; thanks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cerulia<br/>\n&gt; Bard of 7.8 songs, Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
