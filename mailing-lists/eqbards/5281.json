He was a dangerous blue to me - so there was no way I could<br/>\n&gt; solo him and in fact he did kill me even when I had help. He&#39;s a ranger or<br/>\n&gt; druid - I don&#39;t know those classes well enough to say exactly but he would<br/>\n&gt; spawn and then buff himself with at least 3 buffs in a row - the 3rd one<br/>\n&gt; being shield of thorns - ouch!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So when my blonde-ness wore off, I thought hmmm, what if I don&#39;t wait for<br/>\n&gt; him to get all nice and thorny before schwacking him?  So, we&#39;d heal up then<br/>\n&gt; while my party - 2 rangers were medding I went over by his bedroom window to<br/>\n&gt; practice my brass skills - ya, ya I was just practicing - that&#39;s it!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly begins to practice her brass...<br/>\n&gt; a hermit begins to cast a spell...(some kinda self-buff)<br/>\n&gt; a hermit begins to cast a spell...(another self-buff)<br/>\n&gt; a hermit winces...(hehe here is where he winces instead of casting thorns)<br/>\n&gt; a hermit begins to cast a spell...(now he&#39;s mad but has forgotten to do the<br/>\n&gt; rest of his buffs)<br/>\n&gt; Sylly is struck by a bolt of fire...(ok, doky time to come out and play<br/>\n&gt; herman!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So - while this was not exactly interrupting his casting - in that I would<br/>\n&gt; see only occasional interrupt messages by him - it did significantly affect<br/>\n&gt; how he would fight us.  As soon as he spawned he gets his first spell off<br/>\n&gt; immediately then when he got attacked by my Denon&#39;s - he stopped his buff<br/>\n&gt; routine and switched to his attack mode.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So the tip is - don&#39;t wait for him to spawn (which you know because you see<br/>\n&gt; his buff casting) before you attack him - lay down a nice AE for him to<br/>\n&gt; spawn into.

Harmonic Distortion gave a concert in BlackBurrow Paw Sunday<br/>\n&gt; afternoon.  It proved to be very popular because _every_single_gnoll_ in the<br/>\n&gt; whole Burrow (and some of the married ones too!) came up to the top floor<br/>\n&gt; and gathered around Harmonic to hear his concert.  When he was done, a<br/>\n&gt; certain druid named Estella who was also enjoying the concert, applauded the<br/>\n&gt; performance with what sounded like the shock of an earthquake! The young<br/>\n&gt; adventurers in the Burrow were quite happy to loot the 30 or so gnolls who<br/>\n&gt; died in that blast &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Darrian Ashoka [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dashoka@...\">dashoka@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 13, 1999 3:25 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Lullaby and interupting casting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Darrian Ashoka &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dashoka@...\">dashoka@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s my take on the whole issue.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure of this but this is just a couple of<br/>\n&gt; observations I have made using lullaby extensively.<br/>\n&gt; (Been using it a lot since I got it at level 15)<br/>\n&gt; Every song pulses at every tick (6 seconds) as far as<br/>\n&gt; I can tell. And lullaby/nod is no exception. I think<br/>\n&gt; every time nod pulses the mob has to make a savings<br/>\n&gt; check to see if it resists or not. Assume we have a<br/>\n&gt; spell caster that resisted it, and then it begins<br/>\n&gt; casting. If the casting does not take more than 6<br/>\n&gt; seconds, there is no chance that nod will be able to<br/>\n&gt; interupt it. Since NPC casters do not suffer the same<br/>\n&gt; casting time limitations as PC casters do, most are<br/>\n&gt; able to get a spell off before the next pulse of nod<br/>\n&gt; and hence can cast without being interupted. However,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes when the mob resist nod, it attacks first and<br/>\n&gt; then cast. When this happens, the attack and the casting<br/>\n&gt; might not be complete within 6 seconds so when nod pulses<br/>\n&gt; again and the mob fails the savings, then it is nodded<br/>\n&gt; and it&#39;s casting is interupted. This is what I seem to<br/>\n&gt; observe a lot. YMMV.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Darrian Ashoka<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Transfer your big list to ONElist and earn $500!<br/>\n&gt; For program details, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/biglistbon_intro.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
