I decided to go see<br/>\nif I could kill some hill giants in W Commons and while looking ran<br/>\nacross Kizdean Gix. He attacked dispite being 20 odd levels below me and<br/>\nI fired up chains intending to chain and fear him. Hmm. 8 resists in a<br/>\nrow. After killing him and determining there weren&#39;t any hill giants in<br/>\nthe zone, I happened to spot some big wisp spawns and killed them.<br/>\nAgain, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist rates gone up<br/>\non chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much trouble last<br/>\ntime I played my bard. My druid can get snare to stick on reds with more<br/>\nreliability than this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
