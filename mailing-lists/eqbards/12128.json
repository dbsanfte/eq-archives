Do you mean a <br/>\nLOOONG way or just a little way? Can they track Bandl McMarrin from <br/>\nPermafrost, or maybe just Captain silverwind from the bank in Kelethin? Give <br/>\nus a scale to measure that you don&#39;t have to be 40th to go by :)<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n35th Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
