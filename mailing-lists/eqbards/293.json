Now it seems to nix the &#39;S&#39;<br/>\nlist of the creatures and add you to it. This also means that you&#39;ll tick<br/>\noff anything that steps in range regardless of if they were mad at you or<br/>\nnot before. Best use is to continuously play it or stack it when you have a<br/>\nlarge group or if your friendly mage type just unloaded on something.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Basil Eckert [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:athelas@...\">athelas@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 26, 1999 7:46 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Kelin&#39;s Lullaby<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Basil Eckert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:athelas@...\">athelas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I got the song Kelin&#39;s Lucyd Lullaby in Kelethin. I&#39;ve heard<br/>\nseveral times that this is one of the most powerful bard songs and I was<br/>\nreally<br/>\nlooking forward to get it. But now i have to admit that i am quite<br/>\ndisapponited. I thought that it should stop monsters attacking you, and this<br/>\nseems to<br/>\nbe true, but after a few seconds they start attacking you again. I&#39;ve read<br/>\nin this newsgroup that the song makes monsters forget you so they wont<br/>\nattack you any more when you go away, but that doesnt seem to be true. In<br/>\nfact<br/>\nEVERY monster in a certain area around you will attack after a while when<br/>\nyou<br/>\nare singing the song. So if you are in real trouble and want to get rid of<br/>\nthat nasty monster attacking you, you just start singing that song and 10<br/>\nseconds later EVRY living being near you will start attacking you. I really<br/>\ndont know why this song is called to be one of the most powerful ones...<br/>\nIf i am wrong please tell me, I would really appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthelas<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nSent through Global Message Exchange - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gmx.net\">http://www.gmx.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has over 115,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
