Congrats!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI got to admit I&#39;m cracking up picturing this, but not picturing it in the<br/>\nEQ graphics sense, but as a scene in a movie where aged wizards are flipping<br/>\nthrough spell books, standing, wiggling their fingers, frowning at the<br/>\nresults, and sitting back down to flip through more pages while a teeny,<br/>\ntiny, itsy-bitsy, little minstral, staring straight up and hacking blindly<br/>\nat the toes before him, belts out &quot;Here I come to save the day!&quot; through a<br/>\nmega-phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s cracking me up.  ;^)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, bard of 11 missed notes, Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Beckemeier [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Beckemej@...\">Beckemej@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 03, 2000 1:59 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Story Time<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok children, get comfy, I feel like relating one of Knaeve&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; Tales of the <br/>\n&gt; Ludicrous.  I usually just lurk on the list, but I have time <br/>\n&gt; to kill at <br/>\n&gt; work, and feel like sharing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So anyway, I&#39;m grouped with a cleric doing CR after a failed <br/>\n&gt; Vox run.  We <br/>\n&gt; had learned the hard way that 53+ clerics, even if they don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; engage Vox, <br/>\n&gt; still get zapped out of the zone if they get even remotely <br/>\n&gt; close (this was <br/>\n&gt; right after the patch).  I was pumping mana and there were <br/>\n&gt; about a dozen <br/>\n&gt; people in the room, all of whom, by pure coincidence, were <br/>\n&gt; casters.  And <br/>\n&gt; they were all very LOM casters since they&#39;d just been rez&#39;d.  <br/>\n&gt; Somehow, two <br/>\n&gt; lvl 50 Ice Giants agro&#39;d on us.  I charmed one for a while <br/>\n&gt; and had them <br/>\n&gt; duel, but I myself had recently been rez&#39;d, so I ran out of <br/>\n&gt; mana.  The <br/>\n&gt; casters, using what little shred of mana was left, reduced <br/>\n&gt; one to ashes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thus began The Bardic Prize Fight of the Century (may it <br/>\n&gt; never be repeated).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The bad news:  I DIDN&#39;T HAVE ANY CHANTS MEM&#39;D!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; F1<br/>\n&gt; /bonk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The good news: I had VoV, Niv&#39;s, and CoB mem&#39;d from working with some <br/>\n&gt; melee&#39;s earlier to clear out the king room as we worked back <br/>\n&gt; mostly naked to <br/>\n&gt; the CR (the other melee had left, and as I&#39;ve stated, I was <br/>\n&gt; the ONLY melee <br/>\n&gt; in this room of OOM casters).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other good news: I have Sionachie&#39;s Partisan (only one on <br/>\n&gt; Quel server to <br/>\n&gt; my knowledge... I&#39;ll tack the stats to the end of this post) <br/>\n&gt; which I&#39;m very <br/>\n&gt; fond of.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I start to melee this frigging lvl 50 ice giant while <br/>\n&gt; everyone med&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; furiously.  Everyone who could heal had me targeted and so I would <br/>\n&gt; periodically get incoming greater heals.  Every once in a <br/>\n&gt; while a caster <br/>\n&gt; would get enough mana for a nuke--but by some freakish chance <br/>\n&gt; everyone was <br/>\n&gt; getting horrid resists & partial resists.  And the fight went <br/>\n&gt; on.  And on.  <br/>\n&gt; And on.  While I tanked, twisted, and meleed the huge <br/>\n&gt; bastard.  AFter about <br/>\n&gt; two minutes, the cleric I had been mana feeding earlier asked <br/>\n&gt; how stamina <br/>\n&gt; was doing.  &quot;Out.&quot;  So he shot me a bar of stamina.  It was <br/>\n&gt; sort of like the <br/>\n&gt; people on the sidelines of the marathon handing a cup of <br/>\n&gt; gatorade to one of <br/>\n&gt; the runners.  It took 5 minutes to kill him.  Over that period I was <br/>\n&gt; probably the recipient of 30 greater heals.  It was one of the most <br/>\n&gt; ludicrous settings I&#39;ve seen--all these powerless casters <br/>\n&gt; watching the lone <br/>\n&gt; bard take on something with maybe 8-10k hp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Suffice it to say, me and the one person I was grouped with <br/>\n&gt; (cleric) got the <br/>\n&gt; xp for the kill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Knaeve, blah blah blah blah blah.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; .<br/>\n&gt; Sionachie&#39;s Partisan:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 9/19 +6cha +2int +5MR<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; __________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWas the salesman clueless?
