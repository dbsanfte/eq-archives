But the pattern I&#39;m seeing over and over is that mobs<br/>\nthat take 5-10 Pixie Strikes to successfully mes (&quot;eyes glaze<br/>\nover&quot; and it doesn&#39;t immediately wake up) are actually trivial<br/>\nto keep mesmerized, even while weaving one or two extra songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, I&#39;m getting about a 10%-20% success rate at<br/>\nsuccessfully mesmerizing them initially (resists maybe 10%-30%<br/>\nof the time); but once Strike sticks once, subsequent Strikes<br/>\nstick maybe 70%-90% of the time (i.e. whenever it isn&#39;t<br/>\nresisted).  Recognize these percentages?  They&#39;re the same<br/>\nestimate I gave for when Strike wasn&#39;t resisted but had no<br/>\neffect against myself and other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs seems that this bug doesn&#39;t happen when you Strike a target<br/>\nthat&#39;s already mesmerized, which is why it&#39;s so easy to keep<br/>\nthem mes&#39;ed when you finally do get a Strike to stick.<br/>\n<br/>\nI urge everyone with this song to test it on themselves to see<br/>\nthe &quot;not resisted, icon is up, but no effect&quot; bug, and /bug to<br/>\nhave it fixed.  This is a serious impairment to our ability to<br/>\ndo crowd control.  Given our lack of defensive melee skills,<br/>\nI&#39;m sometimes even finding it more effective not to do any<br/>\ncrowd control and just let the extra mob(s) beat on a real<br/>\ntank.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
