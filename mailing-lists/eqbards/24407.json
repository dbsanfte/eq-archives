The reason I say only 70% is because lag affects our songs and<br/>\nI would get killed if soloing at real laggy times.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off make sure you have your mask of deception from Lower Guk already.<br/>\nI&#39;ll tell you why in a bit. Then I would head to Lake of Ill Omen if not<br/>\nalready there.<br/>\nHead out to the pillars along the shoreline. This is the open area in<br/>\nbetween the gobbie ruins and the sarnak fort. You can stay here till about<br/>\nlevel 30-31. Then either head to Frontier Montains or The Overthere. My<br/>\nfavorite hunting spot in Overthere is the little area in between the outpost<br/>\nand the skyshrine zone. If you have the mask of deception already you can<br/>\nbank in town and even train mobs there to safety because the guards will<br/>\nprotect you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is a posted strategy that I placed in a forum  at<br/>\nEQ.castersrealm.com not too long ago. You will find that I have mentioned a<br/>\ngroup strategy and a solo strategy. Lag willing you will be able to solo as<br/>\nI have till 38 for about 70% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a group I would have this song memmed to help out in bad pulls. If we got<br/>\n2-3 mobs the party would fight one and I would handle the other two. I would<br/>\nstart selos to get my running on and then start a charm on the lower con<br/>\nmob. I then tap my /pet attack hotkey or let my self get hit by the<br/>\noffending mob. My pet would then start to kill the other mob. As soon as<br/>\ncharm wears off start it again and repeat the process.<br/>\nI started to solo by using my running song and then I&#39;d find two mobs and<br/>\nagro each. I do not recommend you pull with a charm. Get them both agroed<br/>\nusing a bellow or just get close to them. Start running in small circles and<br/>\nthen start a charm on the lower con mob. Then select the other mob and hit<br/>\n/pet attack hotkey. Once they start fighting (you will hear them) start up<br/>\nselos again. Watch the fight till you get the message that charm has broken.<br/>\nKeep an eye out for possible adds and lead your two mobs to a nice quiet<br/>\nspot. Repeat the process until either mob is at 1/4 health. Then if your pet<br/>\nis at lower health, select the other mob, charm it and tell it to attack the<br/>\nother mob to finish it. If your pet still has higher health, Recharm it and<br/>\nhave it finish off that mob. Keep in mind you have to have a charmed pet for<br/>\nyou to get xp for the kill. You then have a choice to either finish the mob<br/>\nyourself or repeat the cycle with another mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things to keep in mind:<br/>\n1.If you start out charming a mob to pull it to you you will still be<br/>\nrunning once the charm breaks for a while as your other pet will have to do<br/>\nsome damage to get it to release the agro on you.<br/>\nExample: You see Mob A and Mob B near each other. You decide to charm A and<br/>\nthen tell it to attack B. B has full agro on A but A still has full agro on<br/>\nyou unless you recharm him. If you accidently forget which is which and<br/>\ncharm B, you will have to tell it to attack A and A will also start chasing<br/>\nyou even if its being whacked by B until B hits it to build enough hate for<br/>\nit to agro on B.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.The 27th level charm song does not work on mobs 38th level and higher.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. If in the course of charming you get a resist, immediately start selos,<br/>\nwait for a pulse and then try to recharm. I&#39;ve had up to 6 resists in a row<br/>\nand still come out ahead because I&#39;m patient.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Lag affects songs. If you get hit with lag run close to guards or a town<br/>\nor near a zone before it gets worse. If your lagmeter is at 60%+ and your<br/>\nsongs have stopped for more than 6 seconds, more than likely you will be<br/>\nnear death unless you put some distance between you and the mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. If your pull gets stolen this is an excellent way to get it back.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. With alot of practice you will be able to get selos going, hit a charm,<br/>\nget a resist, hit charm once more and succeed before you have to hit selos<br/>\nagain. You may even be able to figure out the timing to get two mobs so far<br/>\ndown that they both decide to run away at the same time. If this happens you<br/>\nmust keep one or the other charmed to recieve credit for the kill.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Rhinos and Tigers/Grimalkins fight until the death. They will not run<br/>\naway even at the last hitpoint. If you are charming another mob and one of<br/>\nthese and they are very close on health, I&#39;d choose a rhino or<br/>\ntiger/grimalkin as the other one will be more likely to try to make a break<br/>\nfor it.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Some people may question why I say charm the lower con mob first. The<br/>\nreason for this is that over time I&#39;ve found that the more I charm the same<br/>\nmob, the more resists I get. I always charm the lower con and if I have to<br/>\nthen I charm the higher con and have him finish the other off. It all<br/>\ndepends on who is losing the fight between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. I&#39;ve added a druid or ranger to snare the mobs I&#39;m kiting and to watch my<br/>\nback. I mainly did this during laggy times. Make sure the snarer only snares<br/>\nor heals you, anything more would seriously agro the mobs onto your partner.<br/>\nNot recommended. We still got great XP.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Lastly, I have been able to kite 4 mobs fairly quickly using this<br/>\ntechnique. Just takes alot of running and patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours in Song,<br/>\n<br/>\nArud Bastad<br/>\n<br/>\n38th level Songstacker on Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\nPending Lore<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
