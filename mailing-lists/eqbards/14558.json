I had only had one crash to the desktop in the whole time<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been playing.  Since the last patch, I&#39;ve locked up on the<br/>\n&gt;login screen 5 times and crashed completely twice -- each one<br/>\n&gt;requiring a reboot.  I haven&#39;t installed anything since then or<br/>\n&gt;even prior to the patch so I was just seeing if anyone else was<br/>\n&gt;experiencing the same sort of thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    On the other hand though, the random number generator seems to<br/>\n&gt;have taken a liking to me last night.  I was camping the goblin<br/>\n&gt;foreman in SolA for some quick cash.  We were there 2 hours and<br/>\n&gt;the foreman (20 min spawn) spawned 4 out of the six times we were<br/>\n&gt;there.  Every time he had an obsidian scimitar!   6 spawns, 4<br/>\n&gt;foremen, 4 OS&#39;s -- too bad we had a druid with us that was in dire<br/>\n&gt;need of a tunic.....but I&#39;m not complaining =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Weiland<br/>\n&gt;Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Finding a sweetheart is hard work.
