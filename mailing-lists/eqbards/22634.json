I guess that <br/>\n&gt; explains why <br/>\n&gt; last nuke to hit doesn&#39;t get kill most of the time anymore. <br/>\n&gt; =) I&#39;ve survived <br/>\n&gt; quite a few fights, but for some reason haven&#39;t taken faction <br/>\n&gt; hits most of <br/>\n&gt; the time. I am still warmly (or kindly I forget) to Kunark dragons. I <br/>\n&gt; specifically remember standing under Silverwing and watching <br/>\n&gt; Alloria get the <br/>\n&gt; killshot (of all people a cleric) while I was grouped with <br/>\n&gt; her. No faction <br/>\n&gt; hit whatsoever. Later I definitely got a hit from Phara Dar, <br/>\n&gt; but I am still <br/>\n&gt; not KoS. Only a matter of time I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sartori{Legion} </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
