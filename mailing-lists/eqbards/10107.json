I have an observer staff and am maxed (I think) for my<br/>\nlevel in 2H blunt.  And all I have to say is that buffed up to the hilt, I<br/>\ncan MAYBE solo a blue in melee (not using DOT and DD)...but I doubt it.<br/>\nThis is strict melee.  Even when I use my spells, I still need to kite a<br/>\nlittle to be comfortable.  My bard is only 17 and does just fine on a<br/>\nblue... I don&#39;t know how she will be at 35 yet. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI guess my point (do I have one here?) is that my bard kicks<br/>\nass in melee compared to my shaman (can&#39;t say about other hybrid classes or<br/>\nabout other bards or other shaman).  Shaman are best at niche filling -<br/>\nturning the tide of battle in our favor, whether by buffing, debuffing or a<br/>\nnicely placed heal or DD.  Maybe bards are best at that too, with a slight<br/>\nemphasis on getting in there and fighting.  But if my shaman is taking hits,<br/>\nI crumple just about as fast as a wizard :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTani 17th Bard<br/>\n\t\tHalana 35th Shaman<br/>\n\t\tSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom:\tKimes, Dean W.<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSent:\tMonday, November 15, 1999 11:09 AM<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] RE: RE: Bellow<br/>\nsong Damage<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tIf you jump off a 10 story building you will<br/>\nfall.

That is not a fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tYou are the only person I know who does not<br/>\nknow the difference between a<br/>\n\t\t\t\tfact and an opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tMaybe Bards eventually become better than<br/>\nShamans in melee, but not at level<br/>\n\t\t\t\t17.  Dual wield was not sufficient to<br/>\nprevent me from being pummeled due to<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthe numerous stuns I received.  All shamans<br/>\nhave slam.  Sure it never goes<br/>\n\t\t\t\tup, but it is still sufficient to stun a<br/>\n17th level bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tBards are better than all hybrids in magical<br/>\npower?  Under what microscope<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdid you determine that?  At lower levels its<br/>\nobviously true as the other<br/>\n\t\t\t\thybrids have no magical power.  Hmm lets<br/>\nexamine them at higher levels.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tPaladin get Greater Heal, 400 hp that&#39;s 3<br/>\nminutes worth of Hymn with a lute<br/>\n\t\t\t\tand it takes them less time than that to<br/>\nmeditate back the mana.  They also<br/>\n\t\t\t\tget Revive at their utmost level of spell<br/>\nuse.  Not to mention Lay Hands.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tRangers probably have the weakest line of<br/>\nspells getting nothing above Heal,<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthough they do get Wolf Form, cool but not<br/>\noverly powerful.  Shadowknights<br/>\n\t\t\t\tspells are fearsome.  The Engulfing Darkness<br/>\nDoT line is devastating as it<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdestroys our best defense, Acellerando and<br/>\nit stacks with their Heat Blood.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tThey also now have the lifetap series.  All<br/>\nthis aside their Harm Touch<br/>\n\t\t\t\talone is a devastating if slow to recharge<br/>\nweapon.  We do have a greater<br/>\n\t\t\t\tnumber of spells than the other hybrids do<br/>\nthough.  Are our abilities<br/>\n\t\t\t\tobviously better, I would not say so.<br/>\nBetter in a full group of six maybe,<br/>\n\t\t\t\tbetter in small groups, that&#39;s not apparent.<br/>\nEven if we were better it<br/>\n\t\t\t\tcertainly would not be 5-6 times better and<br/>\nthat&#39;s how the other hybrids<br/>\n\t\t\t\trelate to us in terms of melee skills.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tNow since I have stated that bards magical<br/>\nabilities might not be so much<br/>\n\t\t\t\tbetter than some of the other hybrids,<br/>\nrangers excluded as their spells are<br/>\n\t\t\t\ttruly weak, feel free to call me a liar.<br/>\nThat will just be one more<br/>\n\t\t\t\tdefinition you will need to look up on<br/>\nMerriam-Webster Online, right after<br/>\n\t\t\t\t&#39;fact&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo further turn your argument around: <br/>\n\t\t\t\tBards cannot beat any caster consistently in<br/>\npure magical combat. (though<br/>\n\t\t\t\tI&#39;ve come close with Maxell MR)<br/>\n\t\t\t\tBards cannot beat any other hybrid or melee<br/>\ntype consistently in pure melee<br/>\n\t\t\t\tcombat.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tNeither of those statements however true<br/>\nprove we are weaker than those<br/>\n\t\t\t\tclasses any more than yours prove we are<br/>\nequal in power.  In my opinion, we<br/>\n\t\t\t\tare weaker than several of the other<br/>\nclasses.  The weakness is not generally<br/>\n\t\t\t\toverbearing but that doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be corrected.  To be honest I<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthink a realignment of our skills would<br/>\nsuffice to bridge the gap without<br/>\n\t\t\t\tmodifications to our spells other than<br/>\nincluding the missing ones and fixing<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthe broken ones.  An added melee skill like<br/>\nParry which succeeds more often<br/>\n\t\t\t\tthan Dodge, and some raised caps on skills<br/>\nthat are currently of debatable<br/>\n\t\t\t\tusefulness would help as well.  Most<br/>\nJack-of-all-trades are seen as<br/>\n\t\t\t\tself-sufficient characters while we are<br/>\ndefinitely not designed to be very<br/>\n\t\t\t\tcapable on our own.  We do best in groups<br/>\ndue to the nature of our spells.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tIt is this very grouping nature that further<br/>\nundermines the usefulness of<br/>\n\t\t\t\tour other skills as there will often be<br/>\npresent others in the group whose<br/>\n\t\t\t\tskill so far overshadows ours in those other<br/>\nareas that we might as well not<br/>\n\t\t\t\thave the skill at all. There is no benefit<br/>\nto having Find Traps and Pick<br/>\n\t\t\t\tLocks when there is a rogue in the group<br/>\nwith more than double your skill.<br/>\n\t\t\t\tIf we were meant to be characters who could<br/>\nfunction on their own and do<br/>\n\t\t\t\tnearly everything, if not well, that would<br/>\nbe different.  However, we are<br/>\n\t\t\t\tnot.  We are meant to group and for every<br/>\nmember we add to our group some of<br/>\n\t\t\t\tour skills become superfluous just as our<br/>\nmagical powers become more potent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t1.
