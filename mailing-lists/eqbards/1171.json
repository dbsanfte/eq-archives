If you live around Qeynos go to<br/>\nSplitpaw. Great exp, not many people to steal kills(but trains suck<br/>\ntherefore), and good money. If you live in Rivervale, either get a group<br/>\nof 4-5 people around your level(you&#39;d prolly want higher levels) and<br/>\neither hunted in Beholder(gorge minos, mudites, and chasm minotaurs<br/>\ndepending on group level, and how many), or in Highpass, which, though<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t have great money, is a great way to gain exp. I would say it<br/>\nhas great money, as the Polished Granite Tomahawks have gone for as much<br/>\nas 300pp on Solusek Ro, but jerk high level people tend to farm the spot<br/>\naround the spawn time(its not too random). If you live in Freeport<br/>\neither hunt dervish Cutthroats, head to Guk, or go into the Oasis if its<br/>\nnot crowded(which is not often). If you live in Faydwer, try Unrest or<br/>\nCrushbone, though they both have many trains and are very crowded.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Lynn Uhlman wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a lvl 15 bard and i&#39;m looking for a great place to make a lot of<br/>\n&gt; cash, plus get some exp.
