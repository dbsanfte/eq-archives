Yep, as a female.  Its<br/>\n&gt;still sexist, and I still hate the lack of graphics which would appeal to <br/>\n&gt;female player.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Women, they look much more like Rangers than their female counterparts.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Heh.
