","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-591557874\">Hehe - John,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is better:<br/>\n<br/>\nChords, Bellow, Anthem<br/>\n<br/>\nor <br/>\n<br/>\nconstant singing of Fulfil&#39;s Curtailing (also factor in resists)?  If<br/>\nmaximum damage is your goal?<br/>\n<br/>\nStandard songs in choice one have lower standard resist rates because they<br/>\nare &#39;vintage&#39; and have level * x powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I do think a consideration should be is whether your party is &quot;tank<br/>\nhvy&quot; or &quot;caster hvy.&quot;  Bard is a party buffer so song choices should be made<br/>\nwith respect to the other classes in the party.  With 3 tanks, healer, bard,<br/>\ncaster; or 3 tanks (one is a bard), healer, ench/sha, caster - I would buff<br/>\nthe tanks.  With 2 pure casters, 2 tanks, bard, healer, I would buff the<br/>\ncasters (by debuffin&#39; the mobs.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes - you have to keep playing it - that was my point exactly.  But<br/>\nthere have been situations where I tried using it to debuff the mobs for my<br/>\nbenefit. Ie, I was using bellow and getting high resist rates so I tried<br/>\ntwisting Fulfil&#39;s with bellow - knowing that I had to make the next pulse to<br/>\nbenefit from the MR debuff. My thinking was I can time the follow up attack<br/>\nbetter than party casters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost bards can play 2 songs for fights - some can do 3.  Even so, playing<br/>\nany one song means not playing another one from a pretty good set of<br/>\nchoices.  To get into a situation where you concentrate on one song only -<br/>\nhas got to be pretty specific and pretty important.  Ie to give up benefit<br/>\nof 2 songs because you can only play one or need to keep playing the same<br/>\none.  One situation like this is the multiple mob pull and bard does crowd<br/>\ncontrol with pixie strike.  Two mean mobs need your full attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unless you have casters that are going to see significant results from<br/>\nthe MR debuff (cmon 30some dmg over 3 rounds is pretty minimal damage) - to<br/>\ndrop to one song only from 2 songs is a hard choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, January 04, 2000 11:07 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Question about 30th level song<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t\tOn Tue, 4 Jan 2000, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; I thot of using this song to lower mob&#39;s MR and tried to<br/>\nclue my casters and<br/>\n\t\t&gt; see if it helped.<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; In testing the song (on yourself) you can see that it drop<br/>\nMR for 2 pulses.<br/>\n\t\t&gt; So, unless you play it more or less constantly, and make<br/>\nit stick (ie mobs<br/>\n\t\t&gt; do not resist), I&#39;d say you are not gonna be successful.<br/>\nI&#39;d think that<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWell, considering it also has a DoT effect that&#39;s about<br/>\ntwice<br/>\n\t\tas good as singing Bellow once every three songs, if you&#39;re<br/>\n\t\tgoing to be using it I&#39;d think the extra damage would be an<br/>\n\t\timportant, if not the primary, factor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t&gt; you need to keep pulsing your song.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIf you keep reapplying it, there&#39;s no need for casters to<br/>\ntime<br/>\n\t\ttheir casts to your song.
