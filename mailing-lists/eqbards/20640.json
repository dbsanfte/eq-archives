On pulls","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1366701559\">With my current guild I am in the Enchanter group on most plane raids now.<br/>\nMy usually line up is focused on keeping the 2 chanters in my group alive.<br/>\nOn pulls I weave VoV + Nillipus + Purifying Rhythms w/drum.  This adds a<br/>\nnice chunk of AC to the chanters, tends to tuant mobs off them at times, and<br/>\ngives them some protection from the nastier effects on the planes.  After<br/>\nthey have locked down the pull I usually do VoV + Clarity.  As keeping the 2<br/>\nchanters full of mana is more important (for the mezzing group) then<br/>\nanything else.  The only time I get in and melee is on spite golems, since<br/>\nthere is usually a huge crowd around the current target.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne additional thing I have been using lately is Song of Twilight.  This has<br/>\na nice effect of pulling the mobs toward you.  Great for when the silly<br/>\nmelee&#39;ers have pushed the mob up on the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 24, 2000 12:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Feeling kinda useless sometimes<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i would try to get the tanks to spread out damage among them <br/>\n&gt; and use vov, nivs, hymn.<br/>\n&gt; on paper the enchanters hastes are better, but in real life, <br/>\n&gt; any speed up song/spell with any<br/>\n&gt; haste item gets you to max haste.  so he can save his mana <br/>\n&gt; for other stuff.    you could<br/>\n&gt; also pull multiples and use charm.  we break the king room in <br/>\n&gt; lower guk by pulling 2 and 3<br/>\n&gt; at a time, just cuz it&#39;s quicker.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
