Are you saying it won&#39;t do me much good until 2 more levels (level<br/>\n&gt;10) and then it will always be a keeper?

I<br/>\nuse it quite often at 18th and my group laments (doh, the regular non-magic<br/>\nkind) when I am not around to play it cause they can&#39;t handle 3 of the<br/>\nthings we usually can get one at a time when I am there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At your age you can be hunting the first and mid parts of <br/>\n&gt; BlackBurrow Paw.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Hmm, I&#39;d been liking West Karana.  Room to run, less lag.  I&#39;ll have to<br/>\n&gt;check out Paw though.  Can&#39;t stand Blackburrow.  Is the loot in Paw similar<br/>\n&gt;to that in BB?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Far better Loot in Paw than Blackburrow. I too hated Blackburrow until I<br/>\nmade 10th level when the trash gnolls started to ignore me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can get Menkes Tolbet in South Qeynos to make you Snake Fang <br/>\n&gt; Necklaces and<br/>\n&gt; re-sell those in the snake places in east commonlands for 1 <br/>\n&gt; to 2pp. Their<br/>\n&gt; value goes way up when your buyer is sitting there with the <br/>\n&gt; poison icon on<br/>\n&gt; his screen &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;THANK YOU!!  I thought I needed a cleric to cure poison.  This is very good<br/>\n&gt;to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t get too excited they only give a bonus to poison resistance.  You can<br/>\nget a bracelet with 14 charges of cure poison from a Quest in Misty Thicket<br/>\nthough.  I have gone thru 3 of these to date and am on my 4th.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Rokenn wrote:<br/>\n&gt; NPC&#39;s near Surefall <br/>\n&gt; Glade (Baobob and Chanda Miller).

Of course, on Tunare, the<br/>\n&gt;Millers&#39; life expectancies are about 3 seconds anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I had that problem too, but the campers agreed to let me speak to the<br/>\nmillers before they killed them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hmm, I was under the impression you had to keep them within the songs range<br/>\n&gt;and keep lament in your mix of songs.  Guess not.  So, let&#39;s say I lament a<br/>\n&gt;blue mob, pull a white mob off to the side & kill it, then decide to leave<br/>\n&gt;the blue mob alone.  When the lament wears off, am I on it&#39;s hate list?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;if I am, will it come across a zone to find me?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope, if Lament succeeds you do not get on its hate list.  Also many times<br/>\nwhen it is resisted you still do not get on its hate list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just WISH her lull lined worked as effectively as lament <br/>\n&gt; has for me since<br/>\n&gt; the day I got it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;So if lament is really that great, why are you higher level folks always<br/>\n&gt;arguing about whether crowd control is best done with Lullaby, Chain, or<br/>\n&gt;Charm?  Is it just that they hit multiple mobs at once?  Or are they better<br/>\n&gt;than Lament even for single mobs?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lament only works before a mob is after you.  It has no effect on a mob who<br/>\nalready has you in its sights, whereas Lullaby will put those mobs that are<br/>\nrunning after you to sleep.  Lament is a before combat spell, Lullaby is a<br/>\nduring combat spell for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
