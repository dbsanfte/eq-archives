I <br/>\nwas totally unbuffed and when her AE hit me it dropped me well under 30% <br/>\nlife so I hauled ass. =)  She cons kindly to me, and never agrroed me. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure what caused her to go aggro on you. During downtime in VP some <br/>\nfriends of mine decided to duel (don&#39;t EVER do this in VP), and Hoshkar, who <br/>\nis kindly to me, stand right on top of me and kill them. His AE hit me HARD, <br/>\nbut he walked away after my friends died w/out aggroing me. *shrug*<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori{Legion}<br/>\n57th Troubador<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Side question about Gorenaire.  I was fighting along the castle north wall<br/>\n&gt;in Dreads when a Gorenaire raid was going on.  I conned the dragon and I <br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt;either warmly or amiable.  So I got close to take some screenshots since<br/>\n&gt;this was the first time I had ever seen a dragon.  I had Selos up and was<br/>\n&gt;standing right in front of Gorenaire when she decided to swat me.  Before I<br/>\n&gt;realized what was going on, I was back at my bind point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So did I die to a bug or will Gorenaire, once aggroed, attack anyone near<br/>\n&gt;her, even if they weren&#39;t involved in the attack?  BTW I was not in wolf<br/>\n&gt;form nor was I grouped with anyone at the time who had pets (which I have<br/>\n&gt;been told will cause her to attack you).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Galtin of E&#39;ci&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
