Nice<br/>\ntrain!  As Damaun, another level 51 bard who got wiped out by the same train (summoned as he ran for<br/>\nzone) shouted &quot;Kudos to the puller that managed to pull a Mob that summons to zone and live!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a discussion last night about the trains in Karnor&#39;s.  Our belief is that most level 50&#39;s grew up<br/>\nin overcrowded dungeons where the fine art of a good pull was not necessary and as a result most don&#39;t<br/>\nknow dirt about pulling successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for deeper, we&#39;re now discovering a couple of &quot;safe&quot; spots you can go to to get out of train city for<br/>\nthe most part including the castle wall where the lookouts spawn, the little alcove just inside the<br/>\ncastle to the left, the captain&#39;s area to the right up the ramp and the two corners by the lake.  Problem<br/>\nis that all of these areas can be a challenge to hold, but certainly doable with a single group.<br/>\nWhatever you do, don&#39;t swim in the under water tunnel to the right of the castle... Insta-death or<br/>\ninsta-train (if somehow you manage to make it that far).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Excuse my ignorance, where is this guy?  Sorry, I have been woefully<br/>\n&gt; neglecting and studiously avoiding Karnor&#39;s Castle - train city as the<br/>\n&gt; morons from our server have moved in from Sol-B.  Last night we were camping<br/>\n&gt; one side of the front zone and another group was at the other side. They<br/>\n&gt; over pulled and we watched 6 or more mobs swarm them.  They zone and we<br/>\n&gt; watch the train begin to reset.  Then this one solo moron fire up her jboots<br/>\n&gt; and dashes over to have a look see or something.  well, she comes running<br/>\n&gt; back with the train and we all have to zone. /rude  followed by soanso says,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Why rude? I didn&#39;t pull that train on you.
