Until this update I never had a<br/>\n&gt; driver-related problem in EQ - (even with SB-Live that a lot of people<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; had problems with).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once I installed 6.18 and went into EQ - it locked up.  The first time - I<br/>\n&gt; tried switching from weaps to Drum - and it locked when I put the drum in<br/>\n&gt; the appropriate hand slot.  Rebooted, came back to EQ.  Then did a tell or<br/>\n&gt; two - and as soon as I tried to move forward - locked again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had to revert to previous drivers (5.33) and no problems.  Beware<br/>\n&gt; upgrading drivers...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
