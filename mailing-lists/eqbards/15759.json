NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the worst zone there is for a young bard.  It&#39;s a train station of<br/>\nthe first order and was designed specifically to kill bards.  The mobs are<br/>\nof a wide level range and are tightly packed in a multi-level structure.  If<br/>\nyou play *any* AE songs they&#39;re going to agro stuff above and/or below you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did at your level was the Crag Spiders in EK at the bottom of<br/>\nthe ramp from Highpass Hold.  Those things are remarkably good experience<br/>\nand are always available.  At 24th I could solo them and each one gave me a<br/>\nnoticable exp bump.  You will get poisoned, but you will still gain 4 or so<br/>\nHPs a tick with Hymn and a lute until it wears off.  So find a tank buddy<br/>\nand try that if you like.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther nice places that are train-free are crocs in Oasis (deepwaters at your<br/>\nlevel), Giant Skeletons in Rathe Mts., Aviaks in SK (dull), Scythe Beetles<br/>\nin NK, DE guards in Nektulos, and if you can stand the occasional train try<br/>\nSol A, Permafrost, Upper Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a bard is diffucult, and high level bards are pretty rare.  In my<br/>\nguild I have talked with several people while grouped that said basically<br/>\nthe same thing: &#39;Yeah, I started a bard, got to level X and said screw that.<br/>\nI&#39;ve never died so much to level so slowly.&#39; so it&#39;s definitely not for<br/>\neveryone.  It&#39;s a hard class, but it&#39;s FUN AS HELL and I encourage you to<br/>\nget 23rd.  Chains does help our class quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n[48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, March 06, 2000 12:08 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Level 22 woes (or why Unrest STILL sucks) LONG<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I logged in my Level 22.5 bard last night for the first<br/>\n&gt; time in about<br/>\n&gt; 2 months (I&#39;ve been playing a bunch of other classes for fun)<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d put Talies away because of all the frustration that last few<br/>\n&gt; times I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; played him.  Just FYI, he *was* 23rd once...<br/>\n&gt; His current equipment:<br/>\n&gt; All armour is bronze except for:<br/>\n&gt; Blackened Iron Crown, Bracer of Erollisi, Purity Belt, Banded Sleeves, 2<br/>\n&gt; strength rings, 2 strength earrings, Grotesque Mask, so AC and<br/>\n&gt; STR aren&#39;t a<br/>\n&gt; problem.  He&#39;s actually not overloaded, either, so that&#39;s no big deal.<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s also got a combine Longsword and a Dragoon Dirk for combat, and no<br/>\n&gt; magical instruments, though he does carry one each of the normal ones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s got two &quot;sets&quot; for songs for combat:<br/>\n&gt; Set 1: Outdoors/open areas (Instruments only)<br/>\n&gt; A) Chords of Dissonance<br/>\n&gt; B) Hymn of Restoration<br/>\n&gt; C) Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord<br/>\n&gt; D) Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; E) Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>\n&gt; F) Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>\n&gt; G) Guardian Rhythms<br/>\n&gt; H) Elemental Rhythms<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Set 2: Indoors/tight quarters (combat bard)<br/>\n&gt; A) Anthem de Arms<br/>\n&gt; B) Hymn of Restoration<br/>\n&gt; C) Jaxon&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor<br/>\n&gt; D) Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; E) *varies*<br/>\n&gt; F) Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>\n&gt; G) Guardian Rhythms<br/>\n&gt; H) Elemental Rhythms<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, last night I logged on, I was on Faydwer, and didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; leave the<br/>\n&gt; continent (not having a whole bunch of time to get a bind<br/>\n&gt; somewhere else),<br/>\n&gt; so I went to Unrest.  Found a group in no time (hurrah for bards), group<br/>\n&gt; was 1 Necro, 1 Cleric, 1 Ranger a Warrior (I think) and me.  No problem -<br/>\n&gt; the Warrior, the Ranger and the Necro&#39;s pet can tank, while the<br/>\n&gt; Cleric and<br/>\n&gt; I support.  The Warrior was pulling.<br/>\n&gt; The Warrior died on the first pull (trained/rooted), the Necro decided to<br/>\n&gt; leave.  The Ranger got an XP res.  We filled in the missing spots, while<br/>\n&gt; waiting for the Warrior to return, with another Necro and a Wizard.  This<br/>\n&gt; time, (since they seemed to think I can&#39;t get rooted) I was assigned to<br/>\n&gt; pull duty.  I&#39;m not very familiar with the area, so after scouting the<br/>\n&gt; whole ground floor (emtpy), I hear about the two new members and<br/>\n&gt; zoom back<br/>\n&gt; to check them out.  When I get back, the Warrior appears and<br/>\n&gt; starts looting<br/>\n&gt; his corpse.  Suddenly, we get an &quot;Inc RED&quot; from the Ranger.  He<br/>\n&gt; dies.  Um -<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t I pulling?  Anyway, naturally, we had to wait for the Ranger, so<br/>\n&gt; while we were waiting, I scouted again, this time up to the second<br/>\n&gt; floor.  &quot;Hey, guys, what&#39;s a &quot;Khrix Fitchoff&quot; &quot;BAD BAD BAD!!! Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; touch!  That&#39;s what killed the Ranger!&quot;  &quot;Um - okay - he&#39;s not bothering<br/>\n&gt; me.&quot;  I guess Necro&#39;s don&#39;t mind Bards.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, we decided to camp the ghoul magi room.  We all get there (except<br/>\n&gt; the Ranger, who is still on his way back), and all of a sudden &quot;A<br/>\n&gt; Skeletal<br/>\n&gt; Monk hits you for 75.  A Skeletal Monk hits you for 49.&quot;  I<br/>\n&gt; looked around,<br/>\n&gt; no monk.  I ran to the other side of the room - how nice, a ghoul.  We<br/>\n&gt; start smacking it down (I&#39;m just healing at this point) and the<br/>\n&gt; ghoul gets<br/>\n&gt; out of the room - no one can seem to get a snare or root to<br/>\n&gt; stick.  Oh, how<br/>\n&gt; nice, just outside the room are two MORE ghouls, and a werebat.  And<br/>\n&gt; EVERYTHING is beating on the poor Bard.  FLEE. DIE.<br/>\n&gt; Okay, I get back, and first thing I hear is &quot;Don&#39;t run, next time.&quot;  Gee,<br/>\n&gt; thanks.  Run back to Unrest, find my corpse, loot and get back into Magi<br/>\n&gt; Room.  Ranger starts to come for his bodies (yes, two - his first time<br/>\n&gt; back, Khrix killed him) and Khrix goes aggro on him AGAIN.  For some<br/>\n&gt; reason, Khrix REALLY hates the Ranger, so we decide to go outside.<br/>\n&gt; On the wall, the usual bard hate summons us a Skeletal Monk and Undead<br/>\n&gt; Knight - no pull necessary.  I was just standing there, and<br/>\n&gt; blammo - there<br/>\n&gt; they were.  As we&#39;re beating on them, a wave of lag hits the zone,<br/>\n&gt; disconnecting our party one by one.  I jumped in to take the monk off of<br/>\n&gt; the Ranger (the only one left tanking at this point) and he manages to<br/>\n&gt; finish off the Knight by himself, while I get the monk down to half (not<br/>\n&gt; bad for a Bard, actually).  He and I play ping pong with the<br/>\n&gt; monk, but he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; too chicken to solo the monk the rest of the way (we&#39;re both at two<br/>\n&gt; bubbles) so he backs off to let the monk beat on me while he heals<br/>\n&gt; himself.  Naturally, I died.<br/>\n&gt; Come back, lost the Warrior, everyone else is disconnected.<br/>\n&gt; Wizard decides<br/>\n&gt; to leave.  Go collect my corpse, and the cleric starts<br/>\n&gt; reassembling a party<br/>\n&gt; from what&#39;s left in the zone - a lot of people got disco&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; apparently.  Nice lag-storm.  At least I was the only one in the<br/>\n&gt; party who<br/>\n&gt; died.<br/>\n&gt; We juggle 3 or 4 people who decide to leave immediately for other<br/>\n&gt; groups.  Oh well.  I&#39;m very disappointed and frustrated - no<br/>\n&gt; positive  experience yet, and not even a chance to loot a bracelet.  We<br/>\n&gt; finally flesh out the party with a Druid and a Shaman (who decides<br/>\n&gt; shrinking is cool).  So the 6 of us tiny people go take the round room by<br/>\n&gt; the back door, since it&#39;s not camped.  I can&#39;t seem to find anything to<br/>\n&gt; pull, so the Ranger gets sow&#39;d and pulls a nice bunch of ghouls,<br/>\n&gt; DBS&#39;s and<br/>\n&gt; a Werebat.  Amazingly, we survive (I was only healing so that was<br/>\n&gt; the only<br/>\n&gt; song I was using).  Next pull, I fire up my combat songs - DOH!  Wrong<br/>\n&gt; songs!  &quot;A Ghoul Magi&#39;s Pet winces,  A Ghoul Magi Winces, A Carrion Ghoul<br/>\n&gt; Winces, A Carrion Ghoul Winces&quot;  RUN!!!!!  ZONE!!!!  Safely zoned.  Come<br/>\n&gt; back, apologize, we try one more time.  This time, we collect a train.  I<br/>\n&gt; die first, so does the necro, party disintegrates.  My corpse is still in<br/>\n&gt; the house, and there&#39;s no one willing to help.  Fortunately, it&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; inside the back door, so I go, corpse it out to the back wall.  As I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; bending down to pick up my stuff, &quot;A Carrion Ghoul hits you for 30! A<br/>\n&gt; Carrion Ghoul begins to cast a spell! You are Stunned. You are Rooted!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Everytime I tried to run, I clicked on my corpse again and opened it up,<br/>\n&gt; and couldn&#39;t seem to get my view reset.  My girlfriend left the room at<br/>\n&gt; this point, sick of the invectives I was throwing at the screen.  So, I<br/>\n&gt; die, two feet from my other corpse.<br/>\n&gt; All told, 4 deaths, so I head back to BB and camp - time to go play a<br/>\n&gt; character who can actually gain experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So - there you have it.  Any suggestions before  I delete him?  I<br/>\n&gt; think if<br/>\n&gt; I can just get to 23rd, things will be much easier, with chains...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talies the frustrated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
