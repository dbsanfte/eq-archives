I guess you are probably wondering how<br/>\nthat can be the case :) You see, mid level encounters were not typically<br/>\ntested with a haste item and a haste spell, but one or the other, since<br/>\nmid-level groups are more free-form in their makeup than the high level<br/>\nones. <br/>\nThe high level groups were typically tested with max-haste, in the form of<br/>\nan item plus a spell. Now we didn&#39;t know at the time that any item plus any<br/>\nspell yielded max, but testing with max was still our intent. <br/>\n[Quote from original post: 2) While we&#39;re on haste, can you please try to<br/>\nlook into, and explain why the Swirle Spine Belt, which is considerable<br/>\nharder to get than the FBSS, has less haste than the FBSS?(and you wounder<br/>\nwhy kedge is always so empty...) ]<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that it is less haste. The players determined all of the haste<br/>\nnumbers by analyzing data in the log.
