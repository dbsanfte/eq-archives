Oh sure, it takes mana. But one shot<br/>\nof said mana and I&#39;m ready to go. With a<br/>\nbard I&#39;ve got to practice my pac man skills<br/>\nwith my hotkeys to remain buffed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you do know all of these particular things<br/>\n&gt; were in effect since the game came out.<br/>\n&gt; did you expect them to change?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A. Where in the poor excuse for a game manual<br/>\ndoes it cover what each class can and can&#39;t<br/>\ndo in detail? Where in that same manual is a<br/>\nlisting of the spells that become available to<br/>\neach class so that you know about bind? For<br/>\nthat matter - where in the manual does it even<br/>\nmention the word bind or what it is?<br/>\n<br/>\nB. Things in Norrath are *always* changing. That<br/>\nis the main &quot;feature&quot; of this game. YES I expect<br/>\nthem to change, and change often. Very quick<br/>\ncase in point - rearrangable spellbooks. They<br/>\nsaid it wouldn&#39;t happen. Too much work to get it<br/>\ndone they said. *poof* It&#39;s done.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW: Yes, I&#39;m bashing my Bard on a bard list. No,<br/>\nI don&#39;t hate my bard - actually I like him very <br/>\nmuch which is why I&#39;m complaining. I would love<br/>\nto see him become more of a viable character in<br/>\nNorrath so that I could realistically keep<br/>\nplaying him. But when I compare him to the other<br/>\nclass characters I have, I find it more difficult<br/>\neach day to pick him from my character selection<br/>\nscreen over the others.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
