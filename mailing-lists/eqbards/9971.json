Otherwise most <br/>\n&gt;systems<br/>\n&gt;work pretty well.  When doing FFA&#39;s I tell people to count five corpses <br/>\n&gt;then<br/>\n&gt;loot the sixth one (assuming a six-member party).  With &quot;honorable&quot; people<br/>\n&gt;it works pretty well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     What galls me the most are the rash of characters named &quot;Aaaba&quot; and<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Aaada&quot; (the three a&#39;s is NOT a typo here).  Obviously these character <br/>\n&gt;names<br/>\n&gt;were decided purely to go first in alpha loot.  With a character name<br/>\n&gt;starting with &quot;S&quot; I&#39;m usually one of the last to loot.  Even in &quot;honorable&quot;<br/>\n&gt;groups - when we do the 5pp or item loot - I often don&#39;t get my turn.<br/>\n&gt;However - I usually am with my guildmates who will split their share with <br/>\n&gt;me<br/>\n&gt;in those cases - often even when I don&#39;t ask!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Slyde<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My favorite method of looting in as far as monetary gain is concerned is <br/>\nmaster-looting. Of course this does not always work well with pick-up <br/>\ngroups, but generally it is fair as long as the master looter is <br/>\ntrustworthy. He loots everything and splits the cash/FS items either at the <br/>\nend of the night or when someone has to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to work great for us when money is an issue to entire party. <br/>\nLately however we have reserved most money and FS loots for the clerics <br/>\nbecause Peridots can easily burn a hole in their wallets, as well as wizards <br/>\nwho need it for PoH trips (250 plat per gate is hella expensive when you <br/>\nhave to evac ever so often).<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 50th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
