Yes there needs to be some<br/>\n&gt;work, but admit it, the trade skills are not put in for the *fun* value.<br/>\n&gt;They are put in there to make money so you can buy better equipment so you<br/>\n&gt;can go fight more stuff (or in UO, kill other people).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have to disaggree with you on this.  The thing many people seem to miss is<br/>\nthe definition of RPG.... which stands for ROLE PLAYING GAME.  For me, and<br/>\nmany many other people, ROLE PLAYING means creating a character, with a<br/>\nbackground, a mind, a personality, likes and dislikes, and yes... hobbies.<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s what trade skills do for you.  They give you the chance to flesh<br/>\nout that character.... and while it would be nice if you could make a small<br/>\namount of money at it, for me it isnt necessary.  My bard has a ball brewing<br/>\nnew drinks to give her friends to try out, and has recently taken up baking<br/>\nfor her betrothed as he experessed an interest in trying some of the<br/>\nrecipies he had heard of.  It&#39;s FUN.  It&#39;s IN CHARACTER.  It ADDS DEPTH to<br/>\nthe role playing experience.  And it&#39;s not so tedious as it was to start<br/>\nwith, and may well get less so as time passes.  It&#39;s certainly NOT work.  At<br/>\nleast, not unless you make it so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I do have one thing to<br/>\n&gt;say about your last line though:  people that pay real money for online<br/>\n&gt;stuff have 2 things and missing one thing.  1) Alot of money, 2) Alot of<br/>\n&gt;time, and the thing they are missing is sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here I have to agree with you though.  As far as I am concerned, the person<br/>\nwho pays several hundred RL dollars for 1000 plat in game has a hell of alot<br/>\nmore money than sense... and WAY more money than they really need.  Though I<br/>\nadmit I find myself wishing I had the time to get that much plat together<br/>\nand auction it off... because that would very likely solve my RL financial<br/>\nproblems. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nLiani, SongWeaver of the 16th Measure, Guardian of Faydwer, Beloved of<br/>\nTheodoric.... from the reality of Bristlebane.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
