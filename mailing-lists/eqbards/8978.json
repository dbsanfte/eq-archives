The only way to make the<br/>\nhero spawn that I know of is to kill the skeletons who spawn in the set points behind the gear.<br/>\nIn particular, there is one spot where he spawns instead of a skeleton, and that is the &quot;niche&quot;<br/>\nbeside the big gear.   My gut feeling is that people have to be killing minotaurs too, but that<br/>\nusually isn&#39;t a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t spawn on a set schedule, that&#39;s for certain.  I&#39;ve seen times when he doesn&#39;t spawn<br/>\nfor days it seems, and other times, he seems to spawn every five minutes.  There was a period in<br/>\nbeta where I got killed by him 4 times in one 2 hour session.  (Different heros).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, kill him for me!<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
