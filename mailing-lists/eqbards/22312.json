With lute ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1705948082\">After reading, Kitasi&#39;s initial post below, I decided to test out Lullaby on<br/>\na drolvarg rager (IIRC 35+ mob, blue to me at 40) in Dreadlands.  With lute<br/>\nequipped, I put him to sleep 3 straight times.  He then resisted twice<br/>\n(normal resist message).  I put him to sleep twice more in a row.  Then he<br/>\nresisted twice in a row.  I was down to half health so thats when my group<br/>\nstarted to attack.  Not once did I get a secondary resist message.  So it<br/>\nlooks like what Kitasi pointed out is true and that aspect of the song has<br/>\nbeen changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild had a mid level raid in Droga this weekend.  Our highest level<br/>\nenchanter was 30th level so, based on my semi-success with the drolvarg<br/>\nrager, I had Lullaby memmed in case things turned sour.  Somehow or another,<br/>\nwhether it was due to a pathing AI bug, a caster using AE spells, etc, we<br/>\ngot swarmed by 10+ mobs.  The enchanter went down quick so I started singing<br/>\nLullaby non-stop. I wasn&#39;t near as successful with these mobs as I was with<br/>\nthe drolvarg rager.  I probably got 75%+ resists on the song.  When it went<br/>\ninto effect, my text screen would usually fill up with at least 6-8 resist<br/>\nmessages.  But I never got a secondary resist message like before.  After<br/>\nour healer went OOM, I was forced to sing fear so we could evac/gate.  Was<br/>\nnot a pretty sight as almost everyone got killed.  Fortunately we had a 50+<br/>\nmonk and 50+ cleric for CR.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBased on my results in Droga, Lullaby is going back into the songbook until<br/>\nI see its been changed in a patch message.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Donny Dane [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddane01@...\">ddane01@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 06, 2000 9:41 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Has anyone else used these recently and noticed?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, had a chance to quiz GZ on the songs this weekend at eqfest 2000 in<br/>\nHouston, TX.<br/>\n<br/>\nPixe and such, are being/have been changed, during the patches that are<br/>\ngoing live...he wasn&#39;t specific on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLULLABYE WILL BE CHANGED!<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ: &quot;Look for some VERY interesting things to be happening to Lullaby soon&quot;<br/>\nGZ: &quot;We have been thinking about bard mez, we didn&#39;t want them to infringe<br/>\non the Enchanter role, as that is what Enchanters do best, BUT we don&#39;t<br/>\nthink that giving bards some mez abilities will hurt&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are not exact quotes, but pretty close.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\nSolusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.

However the spdat.eff file did get patched last<br/>\n&gt; weekend when I logged in.  They can also change some spell effects in the<br/>\n&gt; database without taking the servers down.  I think this might actually<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; gone in with the last patch and may have either been unintentional, or<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; may be trying it out to see if they see any unbalancing effects from it<br/>\n&gt; being live before they announce that it is live.  That way if they have to<br/>\n&gt; change it fewer people will notice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece Tom R CPT 25 ID L G4(n)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 03, 2000 1:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Has anyone else used these recently and noticed?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t think the server I am on (E&#39;ci) has gone down for the scheduled<br/>\nserver<br/>\n&gt; maintenance Abashi mentioned.
