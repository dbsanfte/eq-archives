A bard in the classical sense was a teacher of the<br/>\n&gt; masses, in their historical guise as first level Druids they where charged<br/>\n&gt; with helping the masses where the priests where unable to. Their stories<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; songs contained news, moral lessons, and good advice on life, love, and<br/>\n&gt; happiness. For any to say you are wrong, and I do not have the time to<br/>\n&gt; correct is only self serving. Even the message I am replying to seems more<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; justification that and explanation... Even to say Look at my &#39;experience&#39;<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; a misnomer for much &#39;experience&#39; can be granted for being in the right<br/>\nplace<br/>\n&gt; at the right time. It does not mean one has learned anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A bard never has to say here are my credentials, for they know it is in<br/>\n&gt; their words, songs, and actions where they will be found. A bard is a<br/>\n&gt; chronicler of others not themselves. Leaving it to others to decide on the<br/>\n&gt; value of their  works. I am greatly distressed by this thread, but more<br/>\nover<br/>\n&gt; the personal attack on others without offering help. For that shows one<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; is more worried about being found inadequate rather than wishing to be a<br/>\n&gt; light in the darkness. For it is good to offer what one thinks is true,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; allow ones self to be corrected. rather than keep quiet and not know the<br/>\n&gt; true value of ones knowledge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is easy to throw snipes, to be a source takes much more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also an thankful this thread came up, for I had just sent a application<br/>\n&gt; to that guild. For it has allowed me to see I was wrong in applying. I am<br/>\n&gt; glad for it allows me to ask that the application be rescinded before<br/>\nanyone<br/>\n&gt; puts any work into it. I can not belong to a group that would allow, and<br/>\n&gt; possibly foster this attitude. For a group is as strong as it weakest<br/>\n&gt; member. and all members reflect on the whole. I have nothing bad to say<br/>\n&gt; about them, and still believe them to be a good group, with good ideals.<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; is just not for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wish I could find a guild that I feel comfortable with, and may some day<br/>\n&gt; will. Who knows maybe I will find a like group of people who seek service<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; others over personal fame and recognition. I may someday find a group who<br/>\n&gt; think the same as I and we could form such a group our selves. but that is<br/>\n&gt; to time to choose...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So please, if you have advise to offer, please do. If not please do not<br/>\n&gt; just defame, but rather allow others to offer the proper corrections. For<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; will help the poster as well as the reader if a post (no matter how wrong)<br/>\n&gt; is made. so all can find the truth. To remain silent is to remain<br/>\nignorant.<br/>\n&gt; I am not saying that you do not have a right to your option, say what you<br/>\n&gt; feel you should, I only hope to say that others should not stop speaking<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; worry of what another may say. For if I have a problem, that is what the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Ignore&#39; feature of my Mail client is for...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - SnowLynx, Gentleman Bard of Freeport...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS - I have left the reply train mostly in tact (which is unlike I usually<br/>\n&gt; do, for I like to keep them short but) for those that do not have access<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the full train of thought that I am replying to. I am sorry, but felt it<br/>\n&gt; important in this respect.

You don&#39;t know me well, then.<br/>\nMy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; intent is to prevent a novice bard from getting incorrect information.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Being a founder of the Soerbaird, with members who have put hours of<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into various Beta Phases, and much research into all things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bardic, I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say I have access to a lot of good information and research. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; need only to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; turn to my fellow Soerbaird for accurate information I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; already have. A<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level 25 bard in our guild seems to be quite a rich source of<br/>\nexperiential<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knowledge.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our guild is built to be a boon for Bards, and thus it&#39;s my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charge, as well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as the charge all Soerbaird to be helpful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess I don&#39;t think it&#39;s arrogant or selfish to ask people to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be accurate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather than wrong. I don&#39;t think young bards want to be given incorrect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information. &quot;Guesstimates&quot; are fine, so long as they are posed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that way. My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; contention was that people were posting incorrect information as truth.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for time, I give what time I have to providing a source of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Soerbaird as well as to anyone interested. I built the Soerbaird<br/>\n&gt; &gt; web site as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a resource for you or anyone else - as well as for my guild. I have<br/>\nindeed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; invested many hours into developing this information storehouse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for you and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone else.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While it&#39;s only 1 week old, the site will soon be overflowing with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; information for young and old bards alike. I can tell you the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leaders of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Soerbaird spend little time powergaming, and much time tinkering with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quests, writing ballads, and testing techniques for bards.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As you might imagine, it takes time to document research, and I&#39;m always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grateful to those who do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dendall, Ollave of the Aegis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: John Rice [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnrice@...\">johnrice@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, April 23, 1999 1:49 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: A lot of misinformation<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;John Rice&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnrice@...\">johnrice@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why don&#39;t you enlighten all us poor dunces<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with your incredible deductive prowess?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh, what, you don&#39;t have the time?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You would prefer to passively benefit only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the most exacting research of others,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and not their guesstimates?
