So what? Well, what this means is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana<br/>\n&gt;regen<br/>\n&gt;  (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>\n&gt;- If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should<br/>\n&gt;increase at the<br/>\n&gt;  same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even<br/>\n&gt;more critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this<br/>\n&gt;information, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;even try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt;an upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of<br/>\n&gt;Jaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Synedra of Veshaan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
