(ugh)  Charisma stuff<br/>\nusually seems pretty cheap anyways.. most don&#39;t consider it a priorty<br/>\nstat raise.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I have this:<br/>\n<br/>\nOrder of thunder (2ac, 5charisma) comes off of Drosco (a zombie necro,<br/>\naround 6 to 10 I think) in Qeynos Aquaducts.  This is great for the stat<br/>\nbuff, bad on ac though.  Only gripe I have is that it is No Drop :(<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Electrum Cat&#39;s Eye Braclets (+4 charisma.. no ac IIRC).  Jewler made..<br/>\npaid 10 plat for one, 6 for the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy good friend Jim, A Mystic Doll (3 charisma IIRC, no ac, off hand<br/>\nonly)  Comes off of Lizzie Shamans in Feerott I think..<br/>\n<br/>\nSilk Evening Tunic (5 charisma, no ac that I recall) purchased off a<br/>\nwoman vender in South Qeynos<br/>\n<br/>\nI know jewlers can make a +3charisma necklace, but the Order is nicer if<br/>\nyou can deal with not being able to bank it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunatly, I can&#39;t wear the leatherfoot raiders cap.. small only.<br/>\nShame too, I was looking forward to the +10 :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m working on getting a Crude Stien (+15 charisma, and 10(I<br/>\nthink?)stamina, one charge of minor healing, offhand only) Found off of<br/>\nBouncer Hurd in Ferrott (around lvl 30 I believe)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow anything nice I&#39;m missing?  I have a feeling I&#39;m forgetting<br/>\nsomething important, but I&#39;m not sure what it is.  With base 100<br/>\ncharisma, I can get to around 121 now.  Looking to beef it as high as<br/>\npossible without any spells.  Any help is apretiated :).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLokar, Bard of the Soerbaird<br/>\n15th level, Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n This message was sent from Castle Rock BBS - telnet casrock.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
