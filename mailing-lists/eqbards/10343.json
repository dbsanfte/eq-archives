The greaves and<br/>\ngauntlets were a gracious gift from my mother. The bp<br/>\nI got on my own (I had help only as far as killing the<br/>\nmob, a lvl50 bud nuked the gypsy for me, I still had<br/>\nto go into the house (shiver)) I did get my own<br/>\ngauntlets, too. But, I&#39;m a merchant bard. I didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave much trouble getting the gauntlets, and some guy<br/>\noffered me an insane amount for them... So, my mother<br/>\ngave me hers, silly half elf that she is.. She says<br/>\nblue isn&#39;t her color, and they clash with her mithril.<br/>\nAs far as cash... At level 20, my character is more or<br/>\nless insanely wealthy. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time<br/>\ngetting this cash... I&#39;m somewhere around 25 days<br/>\nplayed, at lvl 20. It&#39;s nice, but now that I have a<br/>\nsurname, people think I&#39;m way older then I am. A group<br/>\nI unknowingly joined in Cazic brought me into the tae<br/>\nroom. 2 hulking gorillas made exceptionally short work<br/>\nof me. Yeowch... And the beggars... &quot;u giv me xtra<br/>\nwaep pls??&quot; I hate them. If you can amuse me, or rp<br/>\nwell, I&#39;ll toss some shinies at you, if you can&#39;t type<br/>\na sentence in full, begone. Enough of my rant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDouble Entendre<br/>\nUberrwink of 20 Seasons<br/>\nSpirit of the Moon<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
