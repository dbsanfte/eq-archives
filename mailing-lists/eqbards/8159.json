No clue on how it looks nor how the<br/>\n<br/>\nstats are.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt bottom is the complete text so you do not have to run a bard over to find<br/>\n<br/>\nout what&#39;s up.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n-Liquidated<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the complete text:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* You say, &#39;hail Walthin Fireweaver&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n* Walthin Fireweaver says &#39;Good day to you.
