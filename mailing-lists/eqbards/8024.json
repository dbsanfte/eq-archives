Both are surprisingly similar<br/>\nif not in function - in role. Our best moments are when we are making<br/>\nOTHERS better - support.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a female thing?  Probably - also something the older player also<br/>\nenjoys more. I don&#39;t feel any particular need to be the center of<br/>\nattention, nor the Avatar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found crafts a fantastic outlet for creativity and player<br/>\ninterraction - at least before they nerfed them so badly I was actually<br/>\npenalized for trying to live that kind of life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;and, to make this bard related... I think the bard class and the cleric <br/>\n&gt;class appeal most to females because of their cooperative roles and their <br/>\n&gt;ability to make others around them stronger... agree?  disagree? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
