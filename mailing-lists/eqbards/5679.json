I had made a habit<br/>\nof checking \tit and on two occassions I was able to detect a difference.<br/>\nOnce I went from \tAmiable to Amiable with song, and to Kindly with<br/>\nflute.  The other time I went \tfrom Indifferent to Amiable with song, but<br/>\ncould not get quest.  With flute I \twas also Amiable, but obviously<br/>\nhigher Amiable as I was able to get quest after \tusing the flute.<br/>\nKeep in mind Amiable is about 2-4 times as large, faction \tpoints wise,<br/>\nas Indifferent, Apprehensive, or Dubious.  Not sure if Kindly is as \tbig<br/>\na faction point range as Amiable, but I would guess it is the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tI&#39;ll retest Chords tonite if I get the chance, but as I recall it<br/>\ndoes 2pts + \t1/6 lvls per pulse when sung and 5 + 1/6 when played just<br/>\nlike Hymn.  My memory \tcould be faulty on that, but it is easy enough to<br/>\ntest what it does at 16th as I \tam currently there, again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI would love to have some better examples of how to use Lullaby<br/>\neffectively.  \tHere is my situation:  I generally am fighting<br/>\nwhites/blues/yellows, but they \tare usually surrounded by greens that ignore<br/>\nme.  If I lullaby the greens will \tstop ignoring me or my group and<br/>\nthen there will be trouble as the greens \tgenerally outnumber the ones<br/>\nwe fight two to one!  Should I not worry about \tthis?  Will the greens<br/>\nresist so infrequently that they won&#39;t matter in the \tfight?  Any<br/>\nsuggestions along these lines would be appreciated as I&#39;d like to \tsee<br/>\nLullaby becaome as useful as the rest of my songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
