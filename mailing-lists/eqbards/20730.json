I was in Steamfont collecting micro servos for a Trueshot bow<br/>\nwhen the Mino hero pops and starts killing the under 10 crowd around the<br/>\ncaves. I was 39 at the time so I have SoW and figure I&#39;ll try kiting him. I<br/>\ngot him to 1/2 health but I was nearly out of arrows and figured I might<br/>\nneed to drop him on a guard when a 44th level druid swoops in and offers to<br/>\nhelp. Within 30 seconds there&#39;s a dead mino and the druid doesn&#39;t want any<br/>\npart of the shackle. I couldn&#39;t believe my good fortune. I needed to get off<br/>\nat that point but I made a point to go to Greater Faydark to celibrate my<br/>\ndruid savior (he was a woodelf so I figured to do it in his home zone)<br/>\n<br/>\nI go and buy 9 bottles of something expensive, not sure what wine it was<br/>\nthen setup by the newbie lift. I /rollplay and begin to shout my story to<br/>\nthe zone. Finally near the end I call out to a first or second season (I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even use level and circle doesn&#39;t seem right for non-casters) ranger<br/>\nand druid to come to the top of the lift to drink a toast in the name of my<br/>\nsavior. I didn&#39;t say I was going to give them a Mino axe, buffs and maybe<br/>\nsome coin, I think I had a FS Scim for the druid, so you can imagine the<br/>\nreaction ... nothing. I shouted for several more minutes and finally got a<br/>\n2nd level ranger. I gave him the axe, buffed him as well as I can and gave<br/>\nup, selling the extra wine back to the vendor.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt; at least I now have a Hero Bracers<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderbrush<br/>\n43rd level ranger of Tunare<br/>\nReedwind<br/>\n17th level bard<br/>\nTerris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
