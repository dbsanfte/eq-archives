The place to get through 30<br/>\n(and a bunch more levels after that) is the entrance<br/>\nof Kedge Keep.  Get yourself a group of 3 players of<br/>\n30 or ABOVE.  Pull the lancer swordfish.  You have to<br/>\nbe careful how your pull them.  There is generally an<br/>\nimpaler or piercer nearby so you have to make sure you<br/>\ndon&#39;t attack the lancers at those times.  Kind of<br/>\napproach the area and let the lancer attack you. <br/>\nAnyway, the experience is AWESOME!  There is never<br/>\nanyone there (except for the occasional raids on Phin<br/>\nor whatever his name is).  The loot is absolutely god<br/>\nawful though.  However, I guarantee you will level<br/>\nvery quickly.  The zone is right there so you should<br/>\nnever die.<br/>\n<br/>\nThex Luteslinger (Tunare)<br/>\n36th level bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 27 Feb 2000 20:11:05 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Michal Hobson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:  Where to go at hell #1<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know this question has been answered a thousand<br/>\n&gt; times, but where would people suggest to move<br/>\n&gt; through level 30.
