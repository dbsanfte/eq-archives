It doesn&#39;t always work on all <br/>\nof them, and it&#39;s pulse-based. So they&#39;ll nod their heads for a few secs, <br/>\nthen the song pulses again and they&#39;ll nod once again if they fail their <br/>\ncheck. Sometimes they get an attack in, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what you do is the following:<br/>\nALL your group has to target the same critter, you do likewise. Beat the <br/>\ncrap out of it while playing the Lullaby. You&#39;ll notice they all start <br/>\nnodding (hopefully). The ones NOT getting hit will just stand there. The <br/>\none getting hit will get knocked out of lullaby instantly.<br/>\nBasically it makes it so a group of monsters can be taken one by one, if <br/>\nthey&#39;ve all jumped you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is the ones who aren&#39;t being hit will - if they succeed in <br/>\nresisting Lullaby - attack YOU. So be prepared for that. Tell the healer to <br/>\ntarget you, and all should be fine. The other problem is making sure the <br/>\ngroup knows to only attack one monster. This is wise in almost any <br/>\nsituation, so it&#39;s a good habit to get into.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found this song to be great in Mistmoore. Having a few initiates <br/>\nnodding while you pound a glyph or gargoyle is very useful, and as long as <br/>\nthey&#39;re not crazy high level mobs, the song will work well. I suspect at <br/>\nlower levels it&#39;s pretty innefective, but at 21&#39;st I&#39;m starting to use it a <br/>\nlot. Pain in the ass explaining it to every new person I group with though <br/>\n;P<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not too clear on if it can be twisted effectively though. I suspect it <br/>\ncan be, I&#39;ve been doing so when the odds aren&#39;t too bad against us. <br/>\nKnocking 3 initiates out of the fight for one round every 3 or 4 rounds is <br/>\nbetter than nothing when I can stack it with Anthem and make us all pound <br/>\nthat one we&#39;re targetting that much more effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I think that&#39;s an accurate way of defining this song: it basically <br/>\nreduces a group of enemies to 1/4 of their potential (factoring in resists <br/>\nand bashes and missed notes and such).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also find it of great use when I see a low lvl person getting pounded by <br/>\na bunch of critters. Run up to them, hit lullaby and they can basically <br/>\nwalk away to safety while the group of critters nod like old men.<br/>\n<br/>\nDud<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tRuss Fuja [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsfuja@...\">rsfuja@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tFriday, June 18, 1999 5:24 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Proper way to use Lucid Lullaby<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt; File: ATT00007.htm &gt;&gt; Hi fellow mistrels and other friends,<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I have never really figured out how to use the lullably song <br/>\ncorrectly.  I wonder if someone could detail a play by play on how it might <br/>\nbe best used against 3 or 4 creatures my group and myself might encounter. <br/>\n I honestly haven&#39;t seen much effect when I have tried to use it....ok <br/>\nthings nod but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any other effect.  Also it is an <br/>\narea effect right, so do I target a creature, myself, what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help y&#39;all can give!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRyleth Stormsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
