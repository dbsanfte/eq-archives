The price on items at the low end (I<br/>\nonly checked 1gp and 4gp) &quot;bottom out&quot; at around 95 chr (extra<br/>\nchr does not increase the discount).  And the very cheap items<br/>\n(a few silver) you can sell for the same price you buy at 95+<br/>\nchr.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;pre&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nChr  Price  % change per chr point<br/>\n---  -----  ----------------------<br/>\n 75  1.000    -<br/>\n 80  0.977  0.443%<br/>\n 85  0.957  0.422%<br/>\n 90  0.936  0.409%<br/>\n 95  0.917  0.388%<br/>\n100  0.898  0.374%<br/>\n105  0.880  0.357%<br/>\n110  0.863  0.343%<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third column is basically your price savings per point of<br/>\ncharisma invested in the above range.  I only checked in<br/>\nincrements of 5 charisma, so those values are the average over<br/>\n5 points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also agree that for very expensive items, the discount<br/>\nseems to be bigger.  My bard has 110 charisma and got a<br/>\ncombine longsword for 52.5pp.  I hear that 75 chr people get<br/>\ncharged 63.5pp.  That&#39;s a 0.827 ratio, not the 0.863 I found<br/>\nabove.  (Yes, I could buy combine weapons and sell at 5pp less<br/>\nthan &quot;normal&quot; people would pay, and still make a tidy profit.)<br/>\nThe most expensive item I&#39;ve priced is a well-balanced 2hsword<br/>\nat 447.681pp.  Maybe someone with 75 charisma could check the<br/>\nprice they&#39;re charged?  (And that merchant views me<br/>\nindifferently)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d expect selling prices follow the same pattern, but I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t checked those.  (Now that I think about it, I should<br/>\ncheck the spread between buying and selling prices.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
