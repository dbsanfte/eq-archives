At least I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t met anyone past about level 30 that went on a looting<br/>\nbinge when it was declared FFA.  In fact, I&#39;ve noticed we tend<br/>\nto have a lot of corpses rot on us unlooted when it&#39;s FFA -<br/>\nnobody wants to pick up the extra weight.  Looting out of<br/>\norder was a pretty big problem at lower levels though.  One<br/>\nguy I was grouped with immediately looted anything with a<br/>\nweapon whether or not it was his turn, then began complaining<br/>\nhe was encumbered.  Needless to say, that group didn&#39;t last<br/>\nlong.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
