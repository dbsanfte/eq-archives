I&#39;ll leave you to read the<br/>\nnotable Bard changes.  The increased customisation of the client gui is<br/>\nwelcome, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s hope it all works as intended. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKyri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNovember 15th, 3:00am<br/>\n------------------------------<br/>\n***Patch Day***<br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included<br/>\nwith DirectX 7. You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play<br/>\nEverQuest. Please refer to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml</a> prior to contacting<br/>\ntechnical support for procedures prior to contacting technical support.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s patch also includes the new &quot;Sound Engine&quot; that we&#39;ve been speaking<br/>\nabout for some time. The new sound engine supports additional EAX features<br/>\nand should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the<br/>\npast.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday<br/>\n11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight. All players wishing<br/>\nto have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those<br/>\nservers to the new split-server should execute &quot;/movelog yes&quot; during the<br/>\nwindows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or<br/>\nWednesday. Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for<br/>\na firm time when it is decided. Remember that corpses will not follow you to<br/>\nthe new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all<br/>\ncorpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people<br/>\nbeing left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention<br/>\nafter the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during<br/>\nthe window. You will need to be present and execute the command in order to<br/>\nmove.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Spell Changes*<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<br/>\n-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing<br/>\nthe secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<br/>\n-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item. The effect was<br/>\nchecking resist on each tick instead of running full course.<br/>\n-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<br/>\n-- Fixed the &quot;Modulating Rod&quot; so that it can be used by the appropriate<br/>\nraces.<br/>\n-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<br/>\n-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength<br/>\nspell.<br/>\n-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack<br/>\nappropriately with other spells that have similar effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Modified the &quot;Jonathan&#39;s&quot; line of songs to remove the &quot;skin&quot; effect in<br/>\norder to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat. In addition, we<br/>\nmade them &quot;Self Only&quot; spells rather than &quot;Single Target&quot; spells in order to<br/>\nallow bards to remain in combat while singing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n*General Fixes/Changes*<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on &quot;Sister&#39;s Isle&quot; to attack people who<br/>\nwere fighting pirates.<br/>\n-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game<br/>\nsince they do not have the piercing skill.<br/>\n-- The &quot;Belt of the River&quot; quest should now work correctly.<br/>\n-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<br/>\n-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<br/>\n-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items. Please check your items to see<br/>\nyour changes. Note: Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<br/>\n-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the<br/>\ncorrect loot.<br/>\n-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<br/>\n-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<br/>\n-- Made the &quot;Gravebinder&quot; a magic weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Repaired the Forager Bag. It was causing people to lose weight when<br/>\nplacing items in the bag. It is supposed to have a weight reduction<br/>\ncomponent, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50. Previously, creatures<br/>\nabove level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill. Now, most<br/>\ncreatures below the character&#39;s level can now be successfully taunted. As a<br/>\nnote, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that<br/>\nof a creature below 50th.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Client Enhancements*<br/>\n<br/>\n-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<br/>\n-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total<br/>\nnumber of available socials by 108.<br/>\n-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate<br/>\nincorrectly.<br/>\n-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at<br/>\nhigher resolutions.<br/>\n-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider. Users should now<br/>\nsee differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an<br/>\nadjustable clipping plane.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show &quot;[LD]&quot; over their heads when<br/>\nlinkdead. In addition, these same players will no longer show as &quot;LinkDead&quot;<br/>\nin the /who list.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game. /usercolor: Usage<br/>\n&quot;/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B&quot; where &quot;UserColorNumber is the number of<br/>\nthe color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red,<br/>\ngreen and blue respectively. All changes will be automatically saved to your<br/>\nEQCLIENT.INI file.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the<br/>\ncharacter name indicating the server number. As such, you will now be able<br/>\nto have characters of the same name on two separate servers with different<br/>\ncustom options.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and<br/>\ncharacter name. For instance, if your character is named &quot;Bobb&quot;, and you are<br/>\non Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Added two new entries to the &quot;Defaults&quot; section of the EQCLIENT.INI file:<br/>\nAttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on<br/>\nautomatically when assisting. Defaults to &quot;TRUE&quot;.<br/>\nShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the &quot;Soandso is<br/>\ninspecting you&quot; message. Defaults to &quot;TRUE&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced. You can now set two keys,<br/>\na primary and an alternate, for each function in game. In addition, things<br/>\nthat were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your<br/>\npreference. Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key,<br/>\nright-click to set the secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Added the /note command. /note will append the following text to a file<br/>\ncalled &quot;notes.txt&quot; in your EverQuest directory. For instance, typing &quot;/note<br/>\nThis is a note&quot; will put &quot;This is a note&quot; on the next line in the notes.txt<br/>\nfile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
