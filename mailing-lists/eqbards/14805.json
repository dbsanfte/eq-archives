Didn&#39;t need my<br/>\nScepter of Flame anymore so I traded it plus 100PP for an Executioner Hood.<br/>\nI had thought the Exe hood was +9 STR and +5 DEX when I made the trade.  Its<br/>\nactually +5 STR + 9 DEX.  I don&#39;t have any weapons that proc so right now<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t much of a reason right now for me to equip it over the BI Crown.<br/>\nThey both have the same AC and the same STR boost.  The BI Crown adds +5 to<br/>\nall resist rates while the Exe hood gives you +9 DEX.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould like an opinion from the peanut gallery if I should keep the Exe Hood<br/>\nfor future use.  Eventually I hope to acquire Ykeshas so the +9 DEX from the<br/>\nExe Hood will increase the chances of the Ykesha procing.  The key question<br/>\nis that by the time I can camp for Ykeshas (late 30s/early 40s), will the +9<br/>\nDEX increase the number of procs by enough to outweigh the benefit of having<br/>\n+5 to all resist rates? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhats a good price if I decide to sell the Exe Hood? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
