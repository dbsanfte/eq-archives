I requested everyone <br/>\n&gt; send me a list of<br/>\n&gt; their primary stats so I could determine what the average <br/>\n&gt; stats were for<br/>\n&gt; bard characters.  Also need to know what your race is so I <br/>\n&gt; can differentiate<br/>\n&gt; the average stats between the three races.  So far the number <br/>\n&gt; of responses I<br/>\n&gt; have received has been less than encouraging.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unless a majority of you are opposed to using this forum for <br/>\n&gt; this type of<br/>\n&gt; research, I will continue to periodically post this request <br/>\n&gt; until I get<br/>\n&gt; enough responses to generate some valid results.  If you are <br/>\n&gt; opposed to me<br/>\n&gt; using this list for this type of  research, send me a private <br/>\n&gt; email.  Also,<br/>\n&gt; if you send me your character&#39;s stats, be sure to send them <br/>\n&gt; via private<br/>\n&gt; email as well. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
