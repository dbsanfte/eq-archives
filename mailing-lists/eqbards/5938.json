A friendly shaman was <br/>\n&gt; buffing me and cast SoW (he didn&#39;t mean to, poor guy) while I was singing <br/>\n&gt; Accelerando with a drum. For the rest of the duration of SoW, Accelerando <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t work. I&#39;m only level 16, but even at so low a level, a bard with a <br/>\n&gt; drum can outrun SoW slightly (I&#39;ve been stuck at 16 long enough to notice <br/>\n&gt; the difference). I zoned several times and even logged out a couple of times <br/>\n&gt; while the SoW was still in &quot;affect&quot; (If you try to cancel SoW yourself by <br/>\n&gt; left-clicking the icon, you get the &quot;You cannot remove this affect&quot; <br/>\n&gt; message). No matter what, Selo&#39;s didn&#39;t work. I still ran at SoW speed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, I still kept strumming my drum. And the song icon bubble was greyed out. <br/>\n&gt; And I made little song sparklies. But there was no &quot;Your feet move faster&quot; <br/>\n&gt; message, and I was stuck running at SoW speed until the darn thing wore off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If it&#39;s been like this for a while, sorry. It&#39;s just that I seem to remember <br/>\n&gt; that Accelerando used to override SoW, not the other way around (you would <br/>\n&gt; still have the SoW icon, but you&#39;d run at Accelerando speed and get the <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Your feet move faster&quot; message).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sigh. This sounds like they took another shot at the SoW/Selo&#39;s<br/>\ninteraction bug and really screwed it up royally. Perhaps causing Selo&#39;s<br/>\nwearing off to not cancel SoW was too hard for them, so they took the<br/>\neasy way out of making Selo&#39;s not effect someone that has SoW on them at<br/>\nall. And, because of some weird inheritance scheme in the C++ classes<br/>\nthey are using, they also nerfed chaining and other songs on SoW&#39;d PC<br/>\nand NPC characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will have to log in and test this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is the case, Bards may have to join the screaming multitutes to<br/>\nassure our class isn&#39;t constantly nerfed by them every time we turn<br/>\naround.
