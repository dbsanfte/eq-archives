It&#39;s a very powerful song. The charm series is one<br/>\nof the most powerful tools at our disposal. If you haven&#39;t purchased it, you<br/>\nshould.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou chain cast it - mixing other songs in and fighting with weapons (after a<br/>\nbit of practice and setting up your hotkeys) - recharming your pet after it<br/>\nfades. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther practical uses:<br/>\n<br/>\nPulling - works in alot of good ways. One that comes to mind is getting that<br/>\ncasting mob back to your group without it getting a spell off. Also, makes<br/>\nit easy to pull mobs that deviate from following you and jump onto other<br/>\nplayers or groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt - An almost sure-fire way to get a mob attacking you when you<br/>\nabsolutely need it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nEscape - charm, /pet guard here, run like mad. You&#39;ve got a 9 second head<br/>\nstart.<br/>\n<br/>\nKS&#39;ing - Mean old, anti-social wizard is being a bully? Charm the Ancient<br/>\nCyclops and watch him spend his mana blasting your immune pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrowd control on multiple pulls - charm a baddie and send it after another<br/>\nthat is not engaged by the group. Now you&#39;ve got two mobs tied up while the<br/>\ngroup fights a third.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuels - nothing funnier than posting a screen shot of your buddy saying you<br/>\nare his master.<br/>\n<br/>\nKiting - charm that mob and let him do your dirty work for you, while you<br/>\nrun around burning wood or Lake Rathe way out ahead and safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSave the crucial party members buttocks - Your enchi is going down and can&#39;t<br/>\nget a mez to stick? Charm the baddie and give him some breathing room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Bill Mann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Wed,  9 Aug 2000 12:54:32 -0500<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bravura question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With Bravura&#39;s nerf a while back (due to someone charming Cazic Thule  lol!),<br/>\n&gt; it seems to me that it would be, funadmentally, the same as Sirens.
