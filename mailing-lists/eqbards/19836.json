I<br/>\nbelieve Griffons, Griffawns, and Griffennes are generated from this spawn<br/>\npoint, but I&#39;m not totally sure.  And my experience mirrors your 2nd<br/>\nattempt... Many, many, many Griffennes (more than 5) before getting the<br/>\ncharm.  The Shaman quest item (feather I believe) seemed to be much more<br/>\ncommon.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess I got spoiled in that the first two griffenes I killed dropped<br/>\n&gt; charms.  Not certain how rare the drop is so I guess not looting one on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>five<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; attempts is nothing to get too concerned over.  Its just a nuisiance at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; point.  IIRC, someone posted a long time ago on the list a method to<br/>\n&gt; guarantee a griffenne would spawn.  The poster mentioned a /loc to go to<br/>\n&gt; somewhere in NK.  Does anyone remember the details of this post?  Also, I<br/>\n&gt; recall someone saying that the only mobs who were placeholders for<br/>\n&gt; griffennes were griffawns.  Killing the other mobs in NK will not increase<br/>\n&gt; the chances of getting a griffenne to spawn.  Is that true?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Best friends, most artistic, class clown Find &#39;em here:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5543/10/_/451022/_/961187438/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5543/10/_/451022/_/961187438/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
