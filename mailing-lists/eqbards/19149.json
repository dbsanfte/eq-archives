To do this start with a group of 5.  Then have<br/>\nsomeone outside the group invite the other non party members to form their<br/>\nown group.  They should hold off on accepting the invite (don&#39;t decline<br/>\neither).  Then invite the person who just did that invite to join the first<br/>\ngroup.  After he accepts, and is added to the group, the other people he<br/>\ninvited should accept his group invitation.  They will now be part of the<br/>\noverall group, but will not appear on the main group&#39;s member list.  They<br/>\nwill share xp for the kills and can make (but not hear) group tells.  When a<br/>\nparty member above them leaves, they will move up onto the list.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this actually works, it would be entirely possible to have multiple<br/>\ngroups combining into one to participate in Vox and Nagafen raids and get<br/>\ngroup experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to keep it on topic, how does one Bard buffing 20 people and providing<br/>\nClarity to a dozen mana-drained casters sound? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how long it&#39;ll take to be &#39;fixed&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-KS</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
