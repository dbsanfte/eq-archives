I tried <br/>\n     it with my enchanter friend.  She cast a one big sell (200 mana or <br/>\n     such, enchant metal)and instantly sat, meditated and stood when she at <br/>\n     full mana.  this way you are measuring the same exact amount of mana <br/>\n     vrs time and can disregard refresh rate, etc.  There is a touch of <br/>\n     variance based on the consistency of her reaction rate but this is <br/>\n     probably small and she is very methodical.  Anyway Jig didn&#39;t do a <br/>\n     thing with or without a drum.  Same time on my stopwatch to within 5 <br/>\n     100ths of a second.

So I <br/>\n&gt;would expect some variability in your mana regeneration times <br/>\n&gt;regardless of whether or not the jig was playing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There&#39;s also the possibility the jig may be interacting <br/>\n&gt;unintentionally with meditation failures, causing an increase <br/>\n&gt;in regeneration rate.  e.g. if &quot;succeeding&quot; at meditation <br/>\n&gt;means you gain, say, 5 points of mana, and the jig reduces the <br/>\n&gt;time for a meditation pulse from 8 sec to 6 sec (though I <br/>\n&gt;still think this is a client refresh illusion), then it would <br/>\n&gt;increase the regeneration rate because the success/fail check <br/>\n&gt;would be made more frequently.  That would decrease <br/>\n&gt;regeneration times at early levels, but show no difference at <br/>\n&gt;later levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
