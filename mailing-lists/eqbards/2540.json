You get <br/>\ncombinations like a froglok shin warrior, froglok tuk knight, froglok tuk <br/>\nshaman, etc.  I&#39;m told that their toughness runs more or less in <br/>\nalphabetical order.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Lull is used not only for the pre-combat spells that prevent a monster <br/>\nfrom reacting when its neighbor is attacked, but also for the in-combat <br/>\n&quot;lullaby&quot; bard song that &quot;turns off&quot; creatures temporarily (similar to <br/>\nenchanter&#39;s Enthrall).  (This double meaning can sometimes cause a lot of <br/>\nconfusion.)<br/>\n<br/>\n* You commented that mules are not approved of by Verant and may be deleted <br/>\nif found. Where did you get this info? I have two mule characters on a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s account (one in Freeport and one in Kelethin) that exist mostly to <br/>\nhang onto spell research components, since there are enough different ones <br/>\nto fill most of a bank account.  I also use them when I need to give <br/>\nsomething to someone but don&#39;t want to hang around waiting for them -- I&#39;ll <br/>\ngive the item to the holder character, tell the person to let me know when <br/>\nthey get to the bank, and then log that character in to transfer the item.<br/>\n<br/>\n* You commented that twinking is not approved of by Verant and may result <br/>\nin character deletion. This is definitely not true. Verant has said that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t care, and that the game has some balance factors that prevent <br/>\nlow level characters from gaining huge advantage from powerful items.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few EQ slang terms I&#39;ve run into that aren&#39;t in your list:<br/>\n<br/>\nbeetle paste - Deep deep red. (Red means &quot;you will die.&quot; Beetle paste red <br/>\nmeans &quot;you and five of your friends will be reduced to beetle paste.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\ncowboy - A player who runs off and attacks stuff when the party (or even <br/>\nthe player himself) isn&#39;t finished recuperating from the last fight.<br/>\n<br/>\ndress - see &quot;nightie.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nmomma - mammoth (as opposed to mammoth calf). It&#39;s unwise to attack a calf <br/>\nwhen one of these is nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nno drop - Item that can&#39;t be traded or dropped, but sticks around when you <br/>\nlog out. (cf. No rent)<br/>\n<br/>\nnuke (2) - see &quot;hose.&quot;  (I&#39;ve never heard &quot;hose&quot; used this way, <br/>\npersonally.)<br/>\n<br/>\nsmurf - Dark elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nwanderer - any NPC that wanders around in a dungeon, rather than sitting in <br/>\none place. (&quot;Don&#39;t kill the wanderer in the graveyard - it will pull the <br/>\nwhole castle!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
