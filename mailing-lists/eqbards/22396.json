And I<br/>\nam about to get second chant(should ding 38 tonight) so I might again try<br/>\nusing horn/drum combo as described in another message.  I have swapped<br/>\nequipment and know I can do it, but most times I decide not to.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, seems as if Bards tend to be older, at least for this small sample<br/>\nreplying.  I am 38 and also very much enjoy the social interactions that go<br/>\nwith EQ(and the wood elf druid I flirt with I have heard in Yahoo chat -<br/>\nvery female).  I have friends from all over the world and from as young as<br/>\n13(in my guild and actually a very good player) to as old as, well, how old<br/>\nare you Ken?  Anyway, I like to think all of you on this list are my friends<br/>\nand include this as part of the EQ society.  As for age making you sleepy, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if it is age or the fact I am up by 6 AM every morning and don&#39;t<br/>\nget to log in until usually after 10 PM(last kid in bed).  I usually end my<br/>\nnight with the statement:  I am doing the headbob and if I keep this up, I<br/>\nwill plant some keys in my forehead.  Hehe.  Never ended up at the bottom of<br/>\na moat due to falling asleep, but my wife enticed me there once(first time<br/>\nin City of Mist, fell in moat, couldn&#39;t get out(I now know it is easy) and<br/>\nwife decides to get home at the most inopportune moment - Get off now!!<br/>\nsituation - Lol).

I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>\nquestion is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory slots, and #2 bank<br/>\nset up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, switch to #1, switch<br/>\nout weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new song without<br/>\nmissing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one of those things<br/>\nthat just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to switch hotkey<br/>\nbanks...<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, btw, play with people 8 levels lower than you!  I played with a monk my<br/>\nlevel and a warrior 8 levels higher.

I<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnever switched weapons during combat.  I agree with Rokenn that it&#39;s only<br/>\nfor the most dedicated player.  Maybe it also has to do with age (I&#39;m 38)<br/>\nand lack of finger dexterity (I find it enough work to twist 3 songs)!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAlso - I don&#39;t view leveling as a race.  The fact that other people<br/>\nlevel a<br/>\nlot faster than I do doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt&#39;s a game - it&#39;s about having fun.  As Rokenn pointed out for many<br/>\nof<br/>\nus - the social aspect is as important or more important than the<br/>\naccumulation of levels and items (please don&#39;t anyone view this as a flame -<br/>\nif that is your playing styles that cool and great - just a matter of<br/>\npersonal taste!)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI pretty much ALWAYS twist in combat - and never in down-time.  In<br/>\ncertain<br/>\nsituations I will - but its very much the exception not the rule.

You might want to remind your groupmate that EQ is after all a<br/>\nsocial game and it is impossible to be social while twisting constantly.
