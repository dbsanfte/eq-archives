Agreed 100%<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you take a Bard who&#39;s soloed his way to 50 (/laugh), I&#39;d be willing to<br/>\n&gt; bet he&#39;s not a very good group player.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually the Bard is the 2nd or 3rd best Solo Class.  Especially after level<br/>\n26 and 27.  And even before that you can easily solo any blue with a well<br/>\nplayed bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, Mage&#39;s, Necro&#39;s, Druids<br/>\n&gt; all have a slight disadvantage in that they can solo, so they might<br/>\n&gt; not pick up the group acceptable behaviors along the way, while Bards<br/>\n&gt; are generally forced to group and thus forced to figure out HOW to<br/>\n&gt; group.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above.  Bards are, hands down, one of THE best solo classes in the game.<br/>\nWe are also one of the best GROUP classes.  My bard can out-solo a magician<br/>\nany day of the week until a magician hits level 40 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour points are valid regarding players who solo rather than group.  However<br/>\nI dissagree that casters have a harder time learning to solo.  Bards are<br/>\neasily as powerful (and in many cases far more powerful) as any caster at<br/>\nSolo play except perhaps the Necromancer and Druid classes yet we learn to<br/>\noperate in groups just fine.  Many people, even bards, don&#39;t realize just<br/>\nhow powerful we are as a Solo class.   Even Druids and Necros have a hard<br/>\ntime soloing hill giants.  Yet a bard can do it easily enough starting at<br/>\naround level 30 if we have 2 giants.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree completely that it&#39;s the player, not the class, that makes ANY<br/>\ncharacter good, or bad, in a group.  I have grouped with good magicians, bad<br/>\nmagicians and the whole range in between.  Same goes for EVERY other class<br/>\nin the game, including bards.  In fact, I&#39;d honestly say, I&#39;ve met more bad<br/>\nbard players than any other class barring Necros.  (And they DO have a<br/>\nharder time learning to group because nobody wants a necro -until recently-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath since Beta 2</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
