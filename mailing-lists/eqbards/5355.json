I know I haven&#39;t<br/>\nseen an increase for a while. One thing I have noticed however is that you<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to take damage from a fall for it to go up. I went up 5 skill<br/>\nlevels scooting around Everfrost off the riverbanks and taking no damage but<br/>\nI&#39;d increase my skill level in it. Now, it could very well be that you have<br/>\nto take damage to increase it but I was taking so little damage that the<br/>\nextra skill point was compensating for it. Another good place to practice<br/>\nSafe Fall up to about 30ish is to go up a ladder and walk back off it. Can<br/>\nget the skill up rather quickly there. (Just be sure to keep Hymn playing<br/>\ncause you will go though health just as quick. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: Mike Roach [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Wednesday, August 18, 1999 12:27 PM<br/>\n8)To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n8)Subject: [eqbards] Bard Skill Caps<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)I hate to ask this question again because I know we have gone<br/>\n8)over this<br/>\n8)topic before on the list, but we have not discussed it for a while and<br/>\n8)people might have some new data on it.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)I just made 24th a few days ago and got the &quot;Safe Fall&quot;<br/>\n8)skill...I trained it<br/>\n8)up to 40 and I don&#39;t seem to be able to take it any higher,<br/>\n8)at least during<br/>\n8)my initial trials - I fell from a high enough height to do<br/>\n8)damage to myself<br/>\n8)over and over (about 20 times or so) until I was down to 1<br/>\n8)bubble of XP and<br/>\n8)it would not raise above 40.<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)Are we capped at 40 for Safe Fall?
