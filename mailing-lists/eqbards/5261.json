Then one of my friends pointed<br/>\nsomething out, something that I&#39;ve been noticing more and more. Even though<br/>\nbards don&#39;t have specific things, I think they can use more stuff than<br/>\nanyone. I think it&#39;s the staff of writhing or observer that is NEC WIZ MAG<br/>\nENC and BRD. BRD? WTF? Many more things are like that too. Why can a bard<br/>\nuse it? I think that&#39;s our benefit that goes right along with our JOAT<br/>\ntrait.<br/>\n\tMy thought anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Iceman007Z@...\">Iceman007Z@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Iceman007Z@...\">Iceman007Z@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Friday, August 13, 1999 9:58 AM<br/>\n8)To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)Subject: Re: [eqbards] Glowing Wooden Crook<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Iceman007Z@...\">Iceman007Z@...</a><br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)OK Im confused Im a Level 23 bard on Eci and I have never<br/>\n8)tried to use 2<br/>\n8)handed becasue It was to my thought we could not do so but<br/>\n8)yet we had it in<br/>\n8)our skills ...It allows us to Wield a 2 HB Glowing Wooden<br/>\n8)Crook but not to<br/>\n8)raise our Skill in it ? what kind of crap is this ?
