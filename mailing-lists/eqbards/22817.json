","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-674760864\">Just following up on an old thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was level 41 last night (42 now) and me and a ranger friend, Deerwen, <br/>\n(level 45) fought a bunch of spectres last night.<br/>\nSince we were near Oasis we checked out the Spectres and found them <br/>\nuncamped. He was concerned about how to break the camp. I told him not to <br/>\nworry about it. He waited by the inn near the sro zone and after I got a <br/>\nsow from him, sang my aria and ran out to the island in the middle of the lake.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to Lament the spectre closest to the edge that runs down towards <br/>\nthe water. Resisted. Ack! Here he comes with 4 of his friends. Hmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust so I don&#39;t accidentally run someone over, I head southwest towards the <br/>\n2 dervish camps. Usually there aren&#39;t people out there and I&#39;ve solo&#39;d sand <br/>\ngiants out there before safely as there&#39;s a nice flat stretch of land near <br/>\nThe Corner. I pull them away from the water and charm the one that resisted <br/>\nmy lament. His buddies turn and attack the traitor. By this time Deerwen <br/>\nhas pulled one of them away with a dot/snare and kites it to keep it occupied.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recharm mine a few times and when he gets real low, I switch to one of <br/>\nthe healthy ones. My new pet dispatches my old one and we got exp. Woot. <br/>\nBTW, I&#39;m armed with my mandolin just singing Hymn while waiting for charm <br/>\nto break as I&#39;m getting lifetapped (or whatever spell that is that spectres <br/>\nuse) and am taking a little bit of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI go through the process and switch before each faithful pet dies. After I <br/>\ntake care of my 4 I went over to help my friend with his 1. I start <br/>\nScreeching at it and we kill it as it runs in fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while I did have help, I probably could have taken them solo. Though <br/>\nhaving SOW on was pretty nice. May have to go out and buy some potions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was very fun and exciting for the 2 of us. The following pulls we&#39;d get <br/>\nmaybe 2 or 3 and we&#39;d employ the same tactics, fear kiting the last one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, most of the spectres you can charm with Song of Sirens. But every now <br/>\nand then there&#39;s a tougher one and I had to switch over to Bewitching Bravura.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m on my way to check out Velious a bit more. Pretty nice place <br/>\nfor us bards. Reminds me a lot of Kunark where you have lots of good mobs <br/>\nroaming the lands.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong<br/>\n42nd level Balladeer on Bertox<br/>\nRed Sky<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Sorry about switching &quot;tenses&quot; in the story. My English teacher always <br/>\npointed that out to me. Oh well. :-b<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:48 PM 6/29/00 -0700, John Tatsukawa wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Ah, good to know about the &quot;suicide&quot; aspect of my proposal.

The<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Spec island when fully populated has at least 4 (one each cornor) and 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(tower lower and 2 upper).  At 33, given the social range, you will get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;multiple spectres.  Also, your hp is no where near high enough to sustain<br/>\n&gt; &gt;any amount of damage from them.  At level 45, it was damn hard for me to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;solo spectres there.  The problem being getting multiple pulls and resists.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;By 47, it was loads easier to pull singles and I still used Lament alot.
