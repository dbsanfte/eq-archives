Who would think to sell these<br/>\n&gt;things back to a vendor when they are mainly to be used to get quest items.<br/>\n&gt;Especially on the test server where there are probably not enough people to<br/>\n&gt;find this out (or the people who found this out waited till the patch came<br/>\n&gt;down to make mega cash like the pie tin sketch incident). They also almost<br/>\n&gt;slipped up on the Shin Gauntlets. Trying to sell them to a vendor will get<br/>\n&gt;you a price of 432 plat but the vendors won&#39;t buy them...<br/>\n&gt;\tIncidentally, anyone know where Greater Dark Bone Skeletons spawn?
