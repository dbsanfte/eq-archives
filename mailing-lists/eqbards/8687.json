Although he wouldn&#39;t tell me how many points I&#39;d put into<br/>\nthe skill, he wanted cash to raise it further.  Now I&#39;m used to that meaning<br/>\nthat there were already a few points in that skill, but perhaps a skill that<br/>\nI gained several levels ago that I had not practiced still might require<br/>\ncash to raise.  So I paid him a few gold and put about four points into the<br/>\nskill.  Then I ran over to the PvP area of Qeynos and fired up DDD with a<br/>\nHORN equipped.  Whatdya know, it started playing the animation and<br/>\nincreasing.  My first increase was to (35), however, not 5 or so.  At level<br/>\n26, that may be the baseline skill level regardless of my practice level<br/>\nthough...<br/>\n<br/>\nSO.  What this means is, either there was some bug that had caused my Brass<br/>\nskill to halt its increasing that I fixed by putting another couple of<br/>\npoints into Brass OR I&#39;d never put any points into it.  Either way I suppose<br/>\nI&#39;m happy.  I got to stand in the newbie zone playing Screech and watch the<br/>\nrats and snakes ping pong off of me for an hour or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 26th song bard on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
