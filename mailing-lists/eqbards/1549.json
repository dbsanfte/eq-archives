Kill a lot of frogloks, and<br/>\n&gt;you should come out with a nice collection of woven armor.  (I&#39;ve been in <br/>\n&gt;Guk for hours and found not a thing, then found 3 woven gloves in a row.)  <br/>\n&gt;Take the woven to Qeynos where there are lots of<br/>\n&gt;monks and higher demand for the stuff.  Sell any gloves you find for<br/>\n&gt;as much as you can, O&#39; 8pp or more.  I made 60 pp with a few packfulls from <br/>\n&gt;Guk to Qeynos, and that was with people telling me<br/>\n&gt;my prices were more than fair.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i have to disagree about killing in guk right now, because you will be hated <br/>\nat higher levels when you wish to return to lower guk, when you really hope <br/>\nto go to guk.  blackburrow, paw, and misty thicket are all the places id <br/>\nsuggest to go to get exp and money.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
