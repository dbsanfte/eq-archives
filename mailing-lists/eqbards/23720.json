Sure FoH and AL (that sploiting<br/>\nShada!) have found ways to kill these mobs with less people, but I would<br/>\nhave to say the majority of guilds have not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me the challenge is NOT gone when it still takes a guild of 50<br/>\npeople with many Donals&#39; 6 hours to kill two dragons.  Its not as &quot;heat and<br/>\nstir&quot; as you seem to think.  Can&#39;t even begin to tell you the hours we&#39;ve<br/>\nspent haha.  It takes a cleric 30 seconds to cast his bp - its not like its<br/>\ninstantaneous. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes I believe I said I DID read the whole post.  I know they will plan to<br/>\ndownlevel the mobs.  I just hope they actually do it.  It has nothing to do<br/>\nwith loot but everything to do with conquoring challenges.  I just like the<br/>\nchallenges to be fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, maybe Paradigm sucks and we have no strategy, dunno.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana/Tani<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Finger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike_finger@...\">mike_finger@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, February 05, 2001 2:41 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Changes on Test for all Classes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The nerf on the Donal&#39;s makes perfect sense to me.  It is too <br/>\n&gt; powerful an<br/>\n&gt; item.  They have also mentioned that were going to look at <br/>\n&gt; tuning down those<br/>\n&gt; high velious mobs that require the BP.  I wish people would <br/>\n&gt; read the ENTIRE<br/>\n&gt; post and not just the parts that upset them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see why everyone is so mad about this change.  They <br/>\n&gt; put in an item<br/>\n&gt; that ended up being more powerful then they expected, so they <br/>\n&gt; are tuning it<br/>\n&gt; down.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kinda takes the challenge out of the mob doesn&#39;t it?  Get a <br/>\n&gt; cleric in your<br/>\n&gt; group with the BP and one warrior can take any, and I mean <br/>\n&gt; ANY mob that does<br/>\n&gt; not outright kill  the warrior in 30 seconds.  As longs as <br/>\n&gt; your cleric can<br/>\n&gt; click fast enough.  Kinda ruins the game.  There is more to <br/>\n&gt; this game that<br/>\n&gt; the ph4t l33t.  Otherwise it would be dead now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Plus, the way they were talking about nerfing it, still makes <br/>\n&gt; it a powerful<br/>\n&gt; item.  The cleric could still completly heal the party in 3 <br/>\n&gt; minutes (no<br/>\n&gt; change here from the original BP), after that the first person has 4.5<br/>\n&gt; minutes (or whatever they set as the buff time) before they <br/>\n&gt; can have the BP<br/>\n&gt; used on them, again.  Not bad, in my opinion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, flame all you want.  I don&#39;t care, I support the <br/>\n&gt; change.  It&#39;s good<br/>\n&gt; for the game as a whole.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
