I have a Silvery war axe,Barbed<br/>\nwhip and Dirk right now also. The PGT has a lower dmg ratio than any<br/>\nof the above mentioned weapons, but I kind of like the dmg barrier it<br/>\nprovides for a limited time. My main question is whether or not the dmg<br/>\nbarrier and extra strength negate the agility loss when it procs? My agil<br/>\nis base at 110 base and I have not bought mush agil increasing items.<br/>\nThanks for any suggestions, I&#39;d like to hear what people think on the PGT.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
