The Maestro was dual-wielding<br/>\nEvensongs.  We almost got him the first time (down to &#39;Mae&#39;),<br/>\nbut then he started flying around attacking nukers, and<br/>\nclerics who had sat down to med.  The melee folks couldn&#39;t<br/>\nkeep in range, and he actually lifetapped back up to &#39;Maest&#39;<br/>\nas we died.  The second time I went LD just as the fight<br/>\nstarted, and when I got back there were only 5 tanks left<br/>\nstanding with him at &#39;Maes&#39;.  Our damage wasn&#39;t enough to<br/>\novercome his lifetap and again he was gaining hp.  It was<br/>\nalmost 5 am at this point so we called it a night.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuad attacks for 150-250 hurt.  A couple tanks died within<br/>\n3 seconds of getting him aggroed on them.  Combined with his<br/>\nAE lifetap and buggy pathing, he was actually harder than<br/>\nInnoruuk (who is widely regarded as the most difficult<br/>\ngod/dragon at the moment).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would&#39;ve liked to have seen how Valoran (Rokenn&#39;s guild)<br/>\nwould do against him in this configuration.  Unfortunately,<br/>\nthere was a server reboot today.  Hopefully that will fix some<br/>\nof the pathing and pet problems (we died to a pet train in<br/>\nbetween the Maestro attempts).<br/>\n<br/>\nDual wielding Evensongs...  Talk about too much of a good<br/>\nthing...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
