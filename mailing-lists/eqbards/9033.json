So later I went and visited the <br/>\ntemple and the npcs there were apprehensive like you, and would not talk to <br/>\nme. Using faction song of course fixed that, and then after making a couple <br/>\nlambent gems I noticed my faction had gone up enough that they would talk to <br/>\nme again. It&#39;s not a huge loss, just don&#39;t kill the npc in MM more than a <br/>\nfew times and you should be fine. If not, go kill some Shadowed Men, they <br/>\nwill fix your faction eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 48th Chorus (*sigh*, damn quests...)<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
