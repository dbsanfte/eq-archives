The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>\n&gt; L48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; beat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; come close to the damage you can do with a claw and dirk from what I can<br/>\n&gt; see. As well, that means you would also only be able to play one other<br/>\n&gt; party buff song, and our best attack song at that level is berzerker&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; which is horn.  If any other L48+ bard has figured out a way to do more<br/>\n&gt; damage with instruments I&#39;d appreciate hearing it.<br/>\n&gt; -----------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; just curious as I am much lower level than you and thus my experience may <br/>\n&gt; not be quite as extensive, but are you working damage upon multiple mobs at <br/>\n&gt; once into the equation?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sure, one on one, I have no doubts you are correct.  But I wonder about <br/>\n&gt; group on group.........<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope I&#39;m not factoring in multiple mobs.
