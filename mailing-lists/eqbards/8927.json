You <br/>\n&gt; &gt;have to have your upper-most left inventory slot free.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Several bards on the concert hall have reported this -<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with that slot open you (should) get your stone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve never seen this problem.  I think these<br/>\n&gt; solutions are more speculation than anything.  Verant in the<br/>\n&gt; most recent patch stated that sometimes quests would not give<br/>\n&gt; any reward and they have fixed this (supposedly).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would chalk it up to coding bugs, and not pick-your-favorite-slot<br/>\n&gt; open in your inventory.  Again, I&#39;ve had every type of Lambent Gem<br/>\n&gt; fall into a backpack slot after it was made 100% of the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Harmonic Distortion, 40th unchained melody.<br/>\n&gt; League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ???
