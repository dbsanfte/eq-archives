Don&#39;t any of the programmers on the list find it odd that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t appear to have some kind of source control system that would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allow patching of the currently running code so they didn&#39;t have to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; live with partly finished changes?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re proposing they bring down the servers again to repatch.  <br/>\n&gt; They may have decided that disruption was not worth the<br/>\n&gt; benefit of temporarily removing a nerf to one of the strongest<br/>\n&gt; classes in the game.

They brought the servers down to patch for some<br/>\ncrash bug last weekend. The patch note when they came back up said<br/>\nthey&#39;d also put in the partially completed necro changes as these were<br/>\npart of the code base they&#39;d fixed the crash bug in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, in large software projects, you tend to go with tested<br/>\n&gt; executables rather than pieces.  The executable they tested<br/>\n&gt; had the necro pet nerf in it.  Rolling back just that one<br/>\n&gt; piece of code may have caused unanticipated and untested<br/>\n&gt; problems in other sections of the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tested? I&#39;d be willing to bet the only part of that patch that was<br/>\ntested was the part addressing the crash bug. Also, my experience with<br/>\nlarge projects is usually that they use some sort of version control<br/>\nsystem where merging in the fixes for one bug is easy to do by checking<br/>\nout the last major revision. Patching the current code base, where there<br/>\nare also many partial or untested changes is more a sign of no version<br/>\ncontrol system, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
