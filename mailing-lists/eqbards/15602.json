Also, if they said before they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t add it because of memory limitations, are they going to have to<br/>\ndelete some things to add in the Iskar textures? <br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nThough the system requirements will be increased for the expansion, EQ<br/>\nproper must continue to work for the originally published specifcations. As<br/>\nsuch, we&#39;ll have to see how much texture memory we have left after adding<br/>\nthe Iksar-related stuff before we can commit to how much individuality can<br/>\nbe added. Anything that a character can equip or wear must exist in all<br/>\nzones, and as such we are restricted by the lowest common denominator of the<br/>\nold EQ system requirements. <br/>\nNow, on Kunark, the land, and creatures in the zones will have more varied<br/>\nand complex textures than you see in the world now. This is possible because<br/>\nthose items can only be viewed by people who bought the expansion thereby<br/>\nagreeing to the new system requirements. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Gordon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
