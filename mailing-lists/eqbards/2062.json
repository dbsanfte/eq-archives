Somebody goofed,<br/>\nmissed a decimal point (100 percent looks so much like 10 percent, eh?) so<br/>\nexpect the rarity of the item to go up soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevikazzam@...\">Kevikazzam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 18, 1999 4:51 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dragoon Dirk (off topic somewhat?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kevikazzam@...\">Kevikazzam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello all!<br/>\n&gt; Well i got myself a Dirk , Love the stats , love the effects<br/>\n&gt;.......now if the damn thing would just work right. My question is , how<br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt;did it take everyone out there to get your piercing skills up ? This is<br/>\n&gt;mainly to the foolish people like me who didn&#39;t think to rotate weapons and<br/>\n&gt;keep all skills maxed .....( whoops). I have been in a group and solo for a<br/>\n&gt;day and a half now using my dirk, and my skill level is 7! ( still gotta go<br/>\n&gt;to the guild and throw a point into pierce) So i have 2 more questions 1)<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt;i throw a point or 2 in to pierce does it make leveling faster from that<br/>\n&gt;point onward ? and 2) because pierce isn&#39;t the bards intial attack type ,<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt;perhaps its preffered weapon type ( is that worded ok?? , it might not be )<br/>\n&gt;does it make piercing harder to learn than 1h slash ??<br/>\n&gt;Ok , many thanks .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ulaien Firesong<br/>\n&gt;lvl 20 bard of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;More than 5,000!
