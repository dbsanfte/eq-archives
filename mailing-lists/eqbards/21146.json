Unfortunatly in your (and<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure lots of people&#39;s, since I hear this all the time) veiw, what others<br/>\n&gt; players have/do affect your enjoyment.  (And I don&#39;t mean directly as in<br/>\n&gt; training half a dungeon on your head, but rather indirectly in that you<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to feel price in your accomplishments and feel your accomplisments are<br/>\n&gt; lessened when others achieve them.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other people have different veiws (in this case they just wish to have the<br/>\n&gt; items/experience of being on the planes/whatever).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The unfortunate part is their veiw conflicts with yours (and again, I dont<br/>\n&gt; mean to point at YOU but rather you as a group who share similar veiws).<br/>\n&gt; Theres not much that can be done about this, as both groups of people have<br/>\n&gt; the right to play the game.  You (and your comrades) know how you got your<br/>\n&gt; planar gear, let that be enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
