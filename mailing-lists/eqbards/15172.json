Klug&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sklug@...\">sklug@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was getting ready to play EQ last night right<br/>\n&gt; after dinner and thought I would post the results<br/>\n&gt; of my Lullaby testing after the latest patch.<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the scenario.  I encountered a 2nd (nearly<br/>\n&gt; 3rd) level young human named Duncan in his lair.<br/>\n&gt; He is the common spawn in the &quot;child&#39;s bedroom&quot; of<br/>\n&gt; the Estate of Klug. Not wanting to ruin my Wife of<br/>\n&gt; Klug faction, I decided I&#39;d use Lullaby to nod the<br/>\n&gt; mob, so that I could run away and continue<br/>\n&gt; adventuring.  Now keep in mind that I&#39;m 31st<br/>\n&gt; level, which is WELL beyond the level where I<br/>\n&gt; should have any problems with Lullaby functioning<br/>\n&gt; at peak efficiency.  Well, my first attempt was<br/>\n&gt; resisted entirely...the mob continued to attack<br/>\n&gt; me, saying, &quot;You will not escape me so easily,<br/>\n&gt; Daddy00!  More stories!!!&quot;  My second attempt<br/>\n&gt; appeared to work, but just as I was running away<br/>\n&gt; (down the stairs) the mob woke up and began<br/>\n&gt; attacking me again, &quot;Daddy00, I&#39;m scared of the<br/>\n&gt; fire alarm!&quot;  Again, I fired up Lullaby.  Again,<br/>\n&gt; the mob appeared to nod off, and I actually almost<br/>\n&gt; made it to the zone, when it woke up again.  I ran<br/>\n&gt; back up the stairs to avoid aggroing anything<br/>\n&gt; else, and Lullabied again.  Only this final one<br/>\n&gt; stuck.  Now that&#39;s only one out of four attempts,<br/>\n&gt; for an overal resist rate of 75%!  I think this is<br/>\n&gt; intolerable, and I may have to stop playing EQ if<br/>\n&gt; Verant doesn&#39;t fix this obvious nerf.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Laluni Songhammer, 35th level bard of E&#39;Ci.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Steven S.

Where&#39;s John Kim&#39;s analysis vs this type of mob?<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was up until 1 am last night with a similar problem with a mob who is<br/>\nunder level 1. I was wielding my 1HB Pacifier (+2 CHA) {Can be bought in<br/>\nmost shops}, but she continued to aggro on me for two straight hours. The<br/>\nzone guards (Mother or Mother-In-Law) are not seen after dark and running to<br/>\nthe zone wasn&#39;t an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was able to maintain my own &quot;Wife&quot; faction, I must say that my<br/>\n&quot;Work&quot; faction has been dropping recently. If anyone knows of any quests<br/>\nwhich would increase my factions with both, I&#39;d love to hear it. (Nothing on<br/>\nAllakhazam&#39;s site) I&#39;ve heard good results of Mask of Deception against Boss<br/>\nmobs, but believe me, it doesn&#39;t work with &quot;Wife&quot; mob. :-P<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
