GMs are there to help you with in-game<br/>\n&gt; problems.  They cannot<br/>\n&gt; modify the database or give you a different item. <br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t even interact<br/>\n&gt; with Developers.  GMs cannot fix this type of<br/>\n&gt; problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are /feedback and /bug commands to take care<br/>\n&gt; of these types of<br/>\n&gt; problems.  These commands will be routed to the<br/>\n&gt; Developers who can fix the<br/>\n&gt; problem.  Or email your complaints to Verant<br/>\n&gt; directly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When you order pizza delivery, and your pizza is<br/>\n&gt; running late, who do you<br/>\n&gt; call?  You probably dial 911.  Instead, you should<br/>\n&gt; think about who can<br/>\n&gt; actually help you with the problem.  Call the pizza<br/>\n&gt; company.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why should this matter to us?  Well if IDIOTS fill<br/>\n&gt; the petition queue with<br/>\n&gt; RETARDED petitions, it takes the GMs longer to<br/>\n&gt; handle real petitions.  How<br/>\n&gt; would everyone on Innoruuk feel if their petitions<br/>\n&gt; took 30 minutes longer to<br/>\n&gt; handle because some IDIOTS felt they could get the<br/>\n&gt; database changed by<br/>\n&gt; filling up the petition queue?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand your frustrations, but don&#39;t frustrate<br/>\n&gt; everyone else with your<br/>\n&gt; actions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Thu, 07 Oct 1999 10:27:14 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: New Bard Quests!
