They are volunteers.<br/>\nDoing events is not part of the volunteering contract.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) it is not that easy to move a guide from one server to another. I&#39;ve<br/>\ngot a friend who is a cross-server GUide. She took a while to get set up<br/>\non them. Its a special case when a Guide is a &quot;SWAT&quot; Guide and can do<br/>\nsuch things on more than one server.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvents are already staggered between servers. Each server decides for<br/>\nitself when its going to hold an event, and makes the planning, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Reece, Tom CPT- 25IDL G4<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, June 06, 2000 3:16 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;But if Verant is planning a special event then it should be fairly easy for<br/>\n&gt;them to require all/most of that server&#39;s GMs/guides to be online at the<br/>\n&gt;time of the event .  Plus if they are short GM/guides then they can stagger<br/>\n&gt;the events between servers and have GM/guides from one server temporarily<br/>\n&gt;move over to another one to help out with the event until its over. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
