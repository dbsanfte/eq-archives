( never knew it had <br/>\na name till a few days ago ) I plan to do it if i create another char , which <br/>\ni know i will. but that being said , i won&#39;t give myself ruby at lvl 1 . I&#39;ll <br/>\ndo it at the level my new char could do it himself. See I hate hunting for <br/>\nruby now , and as far as i&#39;m concerned i never want to do it again. Even in <br/>\nmy next life.  Sitting in that throne room or wherever , not getting much <br/>\nruby . and all that bad stuff , i hate it.... but i want ruby so i endure . <br/>\nBut never again.  ( race war server excluded ) I personally see nothing wrong <br/>\nwith this , my char will get the ruby i have , only when he can get it <br/>\nhimself. I just would like to see people&#39;s views on this, but i really see <br/>\nnothing wrong with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah , and as a random mini-rant . I read an interview with brad where he <br/>\ntalks about his views on exploration and how it makes the game better. <br/>\ngetting away from crowded spots etc etc. My view is , how the heck do you <br/>\nknow where to go and what you can kill ? I go somewhere with a full group and <br/>\ni see something that cons red to me , how do i know if its 2 -3 lvls above me <br/>\nor 20 ? Some people might say attack it and find out , and if it goes bad <br/>\nrun. but as fun as looking at new places is and finding great huntings spots. <br/>\nthe risks of dying and losing a lot exp really stinks. And so maybe  as a  <br/>\nbard i can get out with my life , chances are i will lose at least one party <br/>\nmember, well gee i don&#39;t like to do that to people. He talks about how much <br/>\nhe likes permafrost , well the guy helped make the game , of course he knows <br/>\nwhere to go and what his group can take and what would destroy him. I don&#39;t , <br/>\ni explore , but i very rarely hunt in unfamiliar very uncrowded places. ( <br/>\nrathe mtns scare the crap out of me ) <br/>\n<br/>\nOk thats that just wanted to say it<br/>\nUlaien Firesong <br/>\nlvl 32 bard of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
