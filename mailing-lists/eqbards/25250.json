The proc message seems bugged so I never know if it goes<br/>\noff unless I see the message that the effect wore off and the mob rarely<br/>\nlasts that long. (I have spell effects turned off.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom group member reports however, it goes off almost every fight. Hits<br/>\npretty good too. I usually have it in my primary and a blackjack in<br/>\nsecondary. Weak weapons at 52 I know, but I don&#39;t play enough to wheel and<br/>\ndeal for upgrades in GFay.
