Do you suffer the effects of Chains until<br/>\nit wears off or can you move at normal speeds?   This is a viable tactic to<br/>\nuse if you resume moving at normal speeds.  If you suffer the effects of<br/>\nChain, it doesn&#39;t appear to be a viable option to me unless you assume the<br/>\neffect of the Chain will wear out before the original root would.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 13<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 28 Sep 1999 12:33:45 PDT<br/>\n   From: &quot;Lost Child&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lostchild@...\">lostchild@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Patch Update today<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is pretty easy to tell whether Selo Accelarado breaks the root or the <br/>\nroot just wore off by itself.  If Selo breaks the root, the ROOT Icon will <br/>\nstill remain for the duration even when you are freely moving around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if Selo Accelarado breaks root or not, but I am sure Selo Chain<br/>\n<br/>\nbreaks root.  Again, the Root Icon remains for 15 to 20 second even after I <br/>\nwas moving around freely.  And I don&#39;t think it has to do with the level of <br/>\nthe person who rooted you.  I was lv 47 at the time and the wizard who <br/>\nrooted me was lv 49.  I was about to break it with Selo Chain.
