I dont want a bunch of green guards jumping<br/>\nin while I am fighting the commanders or named Shamans.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlace 3: Kerra Isle, I draw the blue Clawknights and Pridesman and<br/>\nPriestesses usually, lullaby here would also bring on hordes of males,<br/>\nfemales, and huntresses.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlace 4: As you noted the outdoor zones, especially the bandits in W Karana.<br/>\nI&#39;d love to use lullaby on the caster groups so we can sweep a bandit camp<br/>\nand move on, but all it takes is a couple of who green grizzlies and things<br/>\nget out of hand fast.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlace 5: I can&#39;t imagine the nightmare this would cause in Crushbone as<br/>\nevery green Centurion in range started stunning me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, these are the situations that come to mind most.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
