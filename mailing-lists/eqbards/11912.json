Quite a few people on<br/>\ntunare had the same idea and yeah, i got picked for train duty. I was quite<br/>\nhappy to do it though if it ment an easier breakin for everybody else. I<br/>\nbasically did everything you suggested except i had no invis (the idea was<br/>\nto attract attention, not avoid it) and the end results where disastrous. I<br/>\ntried doing several patterns, sometimes running in circls around the gate<br/>\nhill and then running far off, othertimes just tagging the stuff inbetween<br/>\nthe corner and the impt tower... etc. All of em resulted in the same thing,<br/>\none full zone of uber pissed mobs looking for something to kill. It just<br/>\nmade a big backlash that fell back with a mighty THWACK on anybody that<br/>\ntried to zone it or was in the corner. I lived plenty long enough to get<br/>\nstuff far away, matter of fact i made it to cazic himself all but once<br/>\n(tried punching him but everytime i got close he dt&#39;d me heh). Several<br/>\nother people tried this including big ogre warriors, troll sk&#39;s etc. End<br/>\nresult was all the same, just stirred everything up with out sufficiently<br/>\nclearing the corner/gate hill.

My bard and necro both have a<br/>\nflawless zone in record to the pof, and the bard got his full suit of<br/>\nimbrued before verant moved it to scorn banshees in the PoH. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish the train method worked, and i am not completly ruling it out, if<br/>\nyou can figure out a way of making it work please SHARE =)<br/>\n<br/>\nGendal Concorden, lvl 50 Bard<br/>\nEnoch Lyciferous, lvl 50 Necro<br/>\nColet Khrusallis, lvl 25 Cleric<br/>\nTalisman - www.norrath.org</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
