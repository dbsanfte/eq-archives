When<br/>\n&gt; we arrived the group was killing 2 boks, after they were dead <br/>\n&gt; 2 people left<br/>\n&gt; and we replaced them. 10 minutes after joining the Lord <br/>\n&gt; spawned with a Yak<br/>\n&gt; and we killed him. I won the roll with a 52  =P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The next time round we had 2 boks spawn and being only level <br/>\n&gt; 40 I was a bit<br/>\n&gt; dubious as to whether Kelins Lugubrious Lament would be resisted. Our<br/>\n&gt; warrior was gonna pull them both but I said wait. Told the <br/>\n&gt; cleric to get<br/>\n&gt; ready to heal me big time, I then attempted the Lament on the <br/>\n&gt; right bok. It<br/>\n&gt; stuck, I turned round and chained the left bok and he came <br/>\n&gt; solo. The group<br/>\n&gt; was impressed and I got comments like wow, great pull mad, <br/>\n&gt; excellent work<br/>\n&gt; and bards are great. I was pleased to see comments like this <br/>\n&gt; as I often<br/>\n&gt; feel that bards are only regarded as crack dealers. It&#39;s good <br/>\n&gt; to let other<br/>\n&gt; people see the value of bards in a group over than mana song.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, pulling the 1 bok enable us to break the spawn and made life<br/>\n&gt; easier, shortly after we finished the 2nd bok another Lord <br/>\n&gt; with the Yak<br/>\n&gt; spawned (I didn&#39;t roll). All in all a good night, got a Yak <br/>\n&gt; and a Burlupp<br/>\n&gt; sack and am less than a bubble to level 41.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Madagan Songweaver, Bard of 40 Songs &lt;Guardians of Light&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; The information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\n&gt; intended for the addressee only.
