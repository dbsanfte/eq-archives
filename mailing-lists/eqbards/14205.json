It seems that half elves have no problem and get<br/>\nultravision when they activate the DE illusion.  So far no wood elf with a<br/>\nMask has responded.  So if you are a wood elf with the Mask of Deception<br/>\nplease let me know if you are able to get ultravision when you activate the<br/>\nillusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I tried it again in Ogguk.  Activated illusion and became blind<br/>\nas a bat.  This time I had Psalm of Cooling memmed instead of Psalm of<br/>\nWarmth.  While Cooling was up, I got ultravision.  As soon as I stop playing<br/>\nI became blind as a bat again.  Faras posted that when he stopped playing<br/>\nCooling that he had to reactivate the illusion to get ultravision back.<br/>\nThis appears to be a bug but it doesn&#39;t affect me because I never had<br/>\nultravision in the first place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth the problem I have and the one Faras mentioned appear to be bugs so I<br/>\nwill post a message on the EQ board and Concert Hall to try and raise<br/>\nsupport to get it fixed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
