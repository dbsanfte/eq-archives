Bachman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 26, 2001 3:47 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Bard% was (Patch message)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem with this song is the concept.  If this is indeed a &quot;Desperate<br/>\nDirge&quot;, that can only be used<br/>\nonce every 40 minutes (the longest timer of any effect in the game, if I&#39;m<br/>\nnot mistaken), it should, in at<br/>\nleast some small number of expected circumstances, have a significant<br/>\neffect.  It doesn&#39;t.  By the time<br/>\nyou get it, the amount of damage it does is inconsequential to the eventual<br/>\noutcome of any fight, and is<br/>\nactually much more likely to be detrimental due to the AE component (which<br/>\nwakes up anything mezzed)<br/>\ncoupled with the ludicrous resists (which wakes up anything mezzed,<br/>\nfrequently without damaging them in<br/>\nthe slightest).  And the level increases that Verant gave to this song are<br/>\nlaughably small compared to the<br/>\nincreased HP total of higher-level MOBs.  They really have no clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am inconvenienced only in that we were theoretically limited to one song<br/>\n&gt; per level and I don&#39;t get one at that level due to 7% of the people.  If<br/>\n&gt; they add in another song at the level that is useful, problem solved.  My<br/>\n&gt; whole point is DDD is pathetic.  Pillar of Frost can be chain cast 7 times<br/>\n&gt; by a 51st level wizard for far more effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
