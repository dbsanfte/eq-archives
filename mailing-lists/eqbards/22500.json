Went to the <br/>\n&gt; yeti caves in<br/>\n&gt; Dreadlands and Lament pulled a single yeti (blue con) outside.  Weaved<br/>\n&gt; Jonthan&#39;s, Chains and Fear.  For the first time in a long time, I solo<br/>\n&gt; tanked a mob to death.  The haste with Jonthan&#39;s is <br/>\n&gt; tremendous.  I would<br/>\n&gt; estimate it is close to enchanter&#39;s SLW.  The only time I <br/>\n&gt; ever got hit was<br/>\n&gt; when fear broke early.  Most fights I would only lose one bub <br/>\n&gt; of health, two<br/>\n&gt; if I was really unlucky.  Tried the same tactic with a <br/>\n&gt; stonegazer cockatrice<br/>\n&gt; with similar results.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So the new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation looks like it <br/>\n&gt; will help us solo<br/>\n&gt; blue mobs tremendously.  If it still included the rune <br/>\n&gt; shield, soloing would<br/>\n&gt; be even easier coz there would be less downtime for healing.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One drawback that I did notice was it didn&#39;t stack with <br/>\n&gt; Berserker (and I<br/>\n&gt; assume our other combat enhancing songs) for other party <br/>\n&gt; members.  Since<br/>\n&gt; Jonthan&#39;s Provocation is self only, other songs like <br/>\n&gt; Berserker should still<br/>\n&gt; affect everyone in the group beside the bard.  This is not <br/>\n&gt; the case.  I<br/>\n&gt; tested it by starting Jonthan&#39;s, then starting Berserker.  I asked the<br/>\n&gt; others in my party if they were getting the message &quot;You go <br/>\n&gt; berserk&quot; as well<br/>\n&gt; as an icon on the screen.  As long as I had Jonthan&#39;s in <br/>\n&gt; effect on myself,<br/>\n&gt; no one else in the party got the benefit of Berserker.  This <br/>\n&gt; sounds like a<br/>\n&gt; bug to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 45 bard  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Create your business web site your way now at Bigstep.com.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the fast, easy way to get online, to promote your business,<br/>\n&gt; and to sell your products and services.
