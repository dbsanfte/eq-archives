I <br/>\nlike reading about bard problems when they are objectively posted. John Kim <br/>\nalways provided an objective and quantified analysis of any problem. These <br/>\ntype of problems/complaints are constructive and helps build a case to get <br/>\nchanges made and make an effective squeaky wheel.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, all of the postings that takes shots at Verant as a company are <br/>\nthe writer&#39;s opinions, and as such are subject to other opinions.

Doesn&#39;t matter how high a level your bard is in <br/>\norder to form an opinion. However, any comments you&#39;d make on higher level <br/>\nsongs are invalid without you performing them yourself. Consequently, you <br/>\nnever hear me talk about any songs above 40+.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If you are content with<br/>\n&gt;primarily functioning as a mana battery, then you don&#39;t have anything to<br/>\n&gt;worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>BTW, the other night I ran into a 54 bard and a 55 bard and asked both of <br/>\nthem separately if they enjoyed playing their bards and whether they only <br/>\nsing manasong. Both said they loved playing them and thought that anyone <br/>\nwho only played manasong didn&#39;t know what a bard was for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;No need for you to get involved with any of the discussions on<br/>\n&gt;these issues.

I just prefer to not have to <br/>\nread all the ranting and potshots. In that regard, I almost wonder if <br/>\nthat&#39;s why John Kim never returned. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
