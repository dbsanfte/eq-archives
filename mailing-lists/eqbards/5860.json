Well I have dropped Lore like Tomahawks and Claw on the floor<br/>\nand its always been there to pickup. Its a good thing Verant is so quick to<br/>\nreplace bug-lost items. My best friend a 47th Monk zoned into Sol B 2 weeks<br/>\nago and arrived totally nekkid, Verant still hasnt replaced his stuff even<br/>\nthough they have promised a complete restore of his charactor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 31, 1999 12:36 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] The thrill of being a bard: was sonorous<br/>\nclounding message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:58 AM 8/31/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Destroyed from what?
