Always 3.  I&#39;ve experimented with 4, but the first one always<br/>\nlapses by the time you get to it again, not to mention, it&#39;s just that much<br/>\nharder that it makes it too much like work.  :)  I&#39;m still playing to enjoy.<br/>\nNaturally, I get the paladin in my group who also has a bard who is level<br/>\n(range is usually 25-45), who can twist 4 songs even through lag spikes<br/>\nwhile charming giants to tank for him solo.  I just /nod and continue to do<br/>\nmy thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo optimize, I try to be consistent.  The following refers to hotkey<br/>\nslots...the order in the gem bar doesn&#39;t matter.  Hymn is always in slot #4.<br/>\nCharm is always in slot #5.  Pixie in slot #6.  Manasong in slot #7.  Selos<br/>\nin slot #8.  My twist is always, #1, #2, #3, and they are whatever is<br/>\nappropriate.  For most groups, they are #1-Anthem, #2-Psalm, #3-Fulfil&#39;s.<br/>\nIf I&#39;m twisting in hymn, then I&#39;ll just twist #1, #2, #4, or whatever<br/>\ncombination of 1-4.  :)  Basically, I try to minimize the stretch.  To round<br/>\nit out, Pet Attack macro is #9, and Assist is #10.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got 34, so I&#39;m not really familiar with my new song yet.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I want to replace hymn with it, though, since it requires a string<br/>\ninstrument, but if it&#39;s during downtime, it&#39;s probably the best choice.  Not<br/>\nsure, haven&#39;t played for a week, and was 34 for only a couple hours before<br/>\nlogging last time, so...heh.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t manasong during battle, at this point.  No battle should take long<br/>\nenough to require it, so it doesn&#39;t get twisted.  I&#39;m adamant about it,<br/>\nsince I spend downtime twisting it and hymn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 2:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Back on-topic - &quot;Twisting&quot; songs...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:59 PM 6/12/2001 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.
