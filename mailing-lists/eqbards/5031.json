It tend to want to put you on the lowest area of the zone<br/>\nwhen you use it which would make it an awful choice for evacing in Unrest<br/>\nbecause you may use to escape from a train in the second floor only to find<br/>\nyourself in the basement next to a mortuary fungus and or a ghost.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are near water and use it, sometimes it pops on the bottom of the<br/>\nwater - UNDER water.  It is ridiculous, I played with it once in Greater<br/>\nFaydark around Felwithe because I thought that would be a safe area.  It is<br/>\nsupposed to have a greater distance with an instrument equipped but I did<br/>\nnot really notice that it did.  The only thing I like about it is the sound<br/>\nit makes when you &quot;pop&quot;, in that sense it is good for a nice belly laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Elijah Meeker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 06, 1999 11:06 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Melifluous motion<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone ever found a use for this song?
