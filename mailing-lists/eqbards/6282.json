NOTHING annoys<br/>\nmy more than level 50 people, bored, sitting in Newbie<br/>\nzones and killing the guards there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, there was a level 50 Warrior sitting in<br/>\nRivervale killing the Town guards.  Not the Wall<br/>\nguards, where the average player who runs to them is<br/>\nlevel 5 to 12, but the town ones...where the only<br/>\nplayers running to them is around level 1 to 3.  <br/>\nI spent 2 hours helping every newbie I could there<br/>\n(with my Cleric, so I could heal them).  Its hard<br/>\nenough for a newbie to start on older servers, without<br/>\nhigh level IDIOTS making things tougher on them for a<br/>\nlark (NOTE:  It was on MM, and No, it was NOT<br/>\nShada...)<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone kills the Inky guards in Nek forest.  That<br/>\nmust make life Soooo fun for the New Dark Elf players.<br/>\n All I&#39;m asking is that you THINK about your actions<br/>\nBEFORE you do something that may have such an impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nWindolas Stormsong (MM)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
