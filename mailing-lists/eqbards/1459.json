Checked all the<br/>\ncentaurs in the camp, none had names on them.  It isn&#39;t much to speed<br/>\nover to N.

Starting<br/>\n&gt; at Level 12, go to Paw. You won&#39;t regret it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         I got enough loot AND experience there (at the same time) to stay there<br/>\n&gt; from Level 13 to until I got Level 19. And on Fenin Ro there is NEVER<br/>\n&gt; anyone there (2 people at 8:00 in the evening one night, amazing).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Before I describe the place let me just say that I finished my banded set<br/>\n&gt; at Level 14, and finished my bronze platemail set at Level 18. I bought my<br/>\n&gt; first combine longsword at Level 15, and my second at Level 17. I still<br/>\n&gt; have 200 plat left over.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         And this was all solo . . .<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Buy about 4 backpacks, you&#39;ll need them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Paw is the home of the Splitpaw Gnolls. You can find it by heading<br/>\n&gt; directly south when you cross into S Karana from the Bridge from N Karana.<br/>\n&gt; You will in time see hills and some rock spires that look like a Paw. There<br/>\n&gt; is a cave which leads to the zone entrance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         At the entrance you will find Gnolls. Probably Level 8-10 or so. Most will<br/>\n&gt; ignore you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Eventually you will meet guards . . . which you can easily solo, and for<br/>\n&gt; good exp. They are level 10-12 maybe. They may have cloth armor. Keep it.<br/>\n&gt; They may have rusty weapons. Get used to destroying them, not worth their<br/>\n&gt; weight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         You will also find Shamans. These are pretty weak, also about level 10-12.<br/>\n&gt; They carry much better loot. Keep gems, they are lightweight and valuable.<br/>\n&gt; The wooden totems sell for a plat a piece. The only weapon you should keep<br/>\n&gt; is the occasional cracked staff, which also sell for 1 plat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Eventually, you will be able to take nobles. They are Level 13-15. They<br/>\n&gt; carry cloth, gems, but also Snakeskin Armor, which sells for about 7 plat<br/>\n&gt; for each piece to other players.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         After that, you will find there are two big rooms which are often camped<br/>\n&gt; and which you should camp if you can. One room has three nobles, one<br/>\n&gt; Captain (Level 16) and High Shaman Lenrel (Level 16 or 17). Lenrel carries<br/>\n&gt; a Runed Totem Staff sometimes. Those sell for about 30 plat to other<br/>\n&gt; players. The other room has two nobles, three commanders (Level 15 or 16),<br/>\n&gt; and High Shaman Ren&#39;Rex. Rex also drops a staff from time to time. Captains<br/>\n&gt; and commanders drop snakeskin often.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Use your lull song ALL the time. There is a place with 4 shamans and 2<br/>\n&gt; guards that I basically lived for two levels. I would lull up to 4 of em<br/>\n&gt; and take the other two one at a time. Worked great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         The real kicker? Gnolls hate water. They won&#39;t swim after you to try to<br/>\n&gt; kill you. And almost everywhere is close enough to water to get there<br/>\n&gt; before you die. So trouble does not mean death.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         There are some other secret places, and other things you will figure out<br/>\n&gt; (some monk quests as well). But this should be good enough.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Oh, and get used to being encumbered. Yes you can carry about 50 over your<br/>\n&gt; weight limit and still win every fight again things that con blue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Good luck!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Musil<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
