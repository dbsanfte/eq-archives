Instead they put soft level limits on items, so that you would <br/>\nnot get the full effect of the item till you reached that soft limit.  On an <br/>\ninteresting side note it seems proc&#39;ing weapons (weapons that cast spell <br/>\neffects, like the Screaming Mace, Tentacle Whip, etc..) will not proc if you <br/>\nare too low a level as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nKarana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
