(to improve my<br/>\nwoodwind skill) and I accidently sang Lagubrious lament, at the friendly<br/>\nfemale dwarf at the end of the dock. She started hitting me really hard and<br/>\nI ran around the boat thinking that I would just kick Selo&#39;s in and wait<br/>\ntill the boat zoned to Ocean of Tears.  Well she knocked me for a loop and<br/>\nkilled me just about the time that the boat was zoning.  I ran back from<br/>\nKelethin and sang the locating lyric which pointed me roughly southwest out<br/>\ntoward the middle of the ocean.  Well I have died underwater a few times and<br/>\nit stinks but what can you do it was my own damn fault.  I kick in Jaxan&#39;s<br/>\nJig O&#39; Vigor and twist that with the locating lyric.  Following along the<br/>\nocean floor I hit an invisible wall, which I assumed was the edge of the<br/>\nzone, and I went along sideways.  I could tell however that it was pointing<br/>\nme toward someplace that I could not get to.  I followed the edge around<br/>\nuntill I everything changed.  Suddenly I wasn&#39;t in the water anymore, but I<br/>\nwas floating nebulously in dark space.  I could see rain however, and I<br/>\ncould tell which way was up.  I squirmed around and tried jumping and a few<br/>\nother things for about 2 minutes when I suddenly appeared smack dab in the<br/>\nmiddle of Butcherblock, near the crossroads.  Well I ran back to the docks<br/>\nagain and hopped on the boat and played the Locating Lyric as the boat took<br/>\noff.  I could see where my body was(because I was spun around)and I jumped<br/>\noff and tried again to find it. Same deal, floating in dark space with rain<br/>\nand back in the middle of butcherblock.  I finally had to /pettition even<br/>\nthough I really hate doing that.  The Guide who came was very nice and he<br/>\ntold me that my body was &quot;below the world&quot;  Good thing I didn&#39;t have to buy<br/>\nall that banded again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSevin on Brell<br/>\n15th Human Bard<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Christine [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 01, 1999 2:14 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Off List Interesting bug<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Christine&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine@...\">christine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On a side note it was cool to see &#39;behind the sets&#39; so to<br/>\n&gt;speak.
