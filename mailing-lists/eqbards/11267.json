Even the lowest level ghoul<br/>\n  frogs see clean through your invisibility.  Whether they attack you<br/>\n  or not due to level is a different story, which is where this whole<br/>\n  thread gets blurry.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You&#39;ve got a few situations, assuming invis is up and working:<br/>\n<br/>\n  MobRed cons indifferent to you, invis worked.<br/>\n  MobRed cons scowls, doesnt attack, invis didnt work, nonagro mob.<br/>\n         (shadowmen fit this bill, they scowl but wont kos players)<br/>\n  MobRed cons scowls and attacks, invis didnt work.<br/>\n  MobGreen cons indifferent to you, invis worked.<br/>\n  MobGreen cons scowls, doesnt attack, your level is affecting this.<br/>\n         (could also be the nonagro mob syndrome, shadowmen for example)<br/>\n  MobGreen cons scowls and attacks, invis didnt work.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some creatures have permanent see invis, some creatures anything<br/>\n  that is not &#39;Invis to Undead&#39; doesn&#39;t work, some creatures &#39;Camo&#39;<br/>\n  line of spells doesn&#39;t work, some creatures have see invis spell<br/>\n  cast on them, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I never rely on our invis song to get me by creatures I don&#39;t<br/>\n  consider living or alive.  Plus the undead scare the crap out<br/>\n  of me even if they are L10.  Surround sound speakers and subwoofer,<br/>\n  make those zombies jump out at ya ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
