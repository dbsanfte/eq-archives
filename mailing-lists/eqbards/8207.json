At 10th level wisps are still<br/>\nred even the monk will lose.  At 13-14 though they still provide xp, some<br/>\ncon blue, and a melee type with h2h maxed could beat one.  I could beat one<br/>\nat 14th with just bellow and at the same time could punch normal critters<br/>\nfor around the same damage 7-8 points.  I would doubt that a 13th level<br/>\nwarrior would have trouble beating a wisp with his fists if they could hit<br/>\nmagical critters.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 07, 1999 4:12 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Elf Hide Gloves<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;True, but at the level you are fighting wisps for example <br/>\n&gt;a cap of 100<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahh I missed the lower level aspect to the story.  I thought<br/>\nwe were discussing higher levels.  Even at 19 when you first<br/>\nstart seeing your caps move to 100, H2H still is very lacking<br/>\nas my 100 H2H does not beat a level 1 monk with 5 points trained<br/>\nin H2H.  So even if a level 10 warrior had a 55 hand to hand and<br/>\nmagic fists he still wouldn&#39;t be able to beat up wisps, where<br/>\na monk of similar or lesser level could do it with little problems.  <br/>\nMagic fists or not, no melee type can win with just fists, except <br/>\na monk, in the lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 38th unchained melody.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
