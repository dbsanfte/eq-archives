But that wasn&#39;t the time I brought the group.  I ended up bringing 6 50-55s and<br/>\nscrewed it up, aggroing the whole pile on me.  They killed all of them, leaving him for last.  He respawns<br/>\nin about an hour, so we just took out the greens as they respawned.  I then used Sneak to get behind him<br/>\nand did the trade-in.  You have to kill his Doppleganger, I&#39;m sure you could leave him if you wanted to,<br/>\nbut what the heck, he&#39;s there and he&#39;s mad.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a more efficient method  :)  You want a<br/>\ngroup because he blinds.
