A<br/>\n&gt; huge train came up to the zone.  I couldn&#39;t just stand and do<br/>\n&gt; nothing so I hit the lullaby.  It worked.  On more than 4<br/>\n&gt; mobs.  At one point, I must&#39;ve had a dozen or more gnolls<br/>\n&gt; stacking away the Zzzzz&#39;s.  So it would seem there is no 4 mob<br/>\n&gt; limit as had been previously stated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t attack a single one.  They all attacked me because<br/>\n&gt; they hated my song.  They only managed to take a bubble of my<br/>\n&gt; health in about 5 minutes because my AC was 388.  All the<br/>\n&gt; lower level folks loved it.  They got all the experience and<br/>\n&gt; took virtually no damage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got a ton of faction for it.  The guards and merchants in<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos now view me amiably (used to be apprehensive).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
