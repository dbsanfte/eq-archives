There is endless discussion about<br/>\n&gt;&quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing two songs<br/>\n&gt;at once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some sort of<br/>\n&gt;special trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves starting<br/>\n&gt;one song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song and<br/>\n&gt;quickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and then<br/>\n&gt;stopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing the<br/>\n&gt;effect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of button<br/>\n&gt;pressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have failed<br/>\n&gt;entirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have the<br/>\n&gt;icon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I hardly ever<br/>\n&gt;actually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually higher<br/>\n&gt;when I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any effect of<br/>\n&gt;either song!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over zealous but<br/>\n&gt;very talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a lot of you<br/>\n&gt;take seriously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I for one am going to save my fingers the busywork . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Musil<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
