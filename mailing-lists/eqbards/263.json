No reflection on other guilds<br/>\nintended.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea would be that anyone seeing the name of that guild would know the<br/>\nbearer could be trusted implicitly and appealed to for possible help.  I&#39;d<br/>\nlike to see it allow worthies of other classes and any race, but maintain a<br/>\nflavor of bardic oversight and origination.
