I can beat a white/yellow derv usually by myself.<br/>\nBut most casting desert or island madmen (or Derv&#39;s) that con green are<br/>\nfairly dangerous for me for some reason. They never seem to run out of mana,<br/>\nthey never seem to get interrupted by me successfully hitting them while<br/>\nthey&#39;re casting and they simply refuse to die. I don&#39;t even want to talk<br/>\nabout the ones that sit there and heal themselves while I&#39;m hacking their<br/>\nbody parts off. If you get into trouble with a caster, you&#39;re simply SOL<br/>\nbecause you can&#39;t seem to outrun their spell range fast enough. (By trouble<br/>\nI mean down to the last bubble or so)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, there&#39;s always the chance that it&#39;s just my tactics that<br/>\nstink. *shrug* But I still despise fighting a caster alone.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
