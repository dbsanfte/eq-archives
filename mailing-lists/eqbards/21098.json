Either they&#39;d fix it or I&#39;d be done with<br/>\n&gt; EQ.  That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what customer service is about.  No it still wouldn&#39;t be a higher<br/>\n&gt; priority.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was only counting the people I know in RL personally.  I doubt anyone<br/>\n&gt; knows an appropriate sample size in that way.  From seeing the boards<br/>\n&gt; though, there are hundreds of posts on bard song bugs, very few on having<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s own corpse poof.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
