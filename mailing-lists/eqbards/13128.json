I am very sorry to say that the pathing is <br/>\nso messed up at the top of that temple that if you stay out of melee range <br/>\nof the lizzies (and off the steps, any steps) you can effectively cheat by <br/>\nusing ranged attack.  Since the lizzies get &quot;stuck&quot; in place, by being out <br/>\nof their melee range just sit back and use casters or whatever to kill em.  <br/>\nVery very poor sport.  I don&#39;t do this.  I have seen a bard climb the roof, <br/>\nlev off, and run around aggro&#39;ing all the lizzies around the temple then <br/>\nstand on steps at top of temple.  The lizzies come to him, ignoring all <br/>\nothers.  He climbs roof, then rest of group slays lizzies which do not even <br/>\nfight back.  I have seen it and thought it a shame.  I even grouped in a <br/>\ngroup that did this, before I realized what was really happening.  Maybe it <br/>\nis just the Cazic-Thule server that this phenom happens, but i would <br/>\nrecommend trying Lullaby somewhere else with two bards to be sure it is not <br/>\nthe poor pathing in the temple.<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewduer Fflamson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Slowly but surely, we killed off the intial 10 mobs.  However, this took us <br/>\n&gt;so<br/>\n&gt;long that as we got down to the last few mobs, new ones spawned along the <br/>\n&gt;steps.<br/>\n&gt;I just kept singing Lullaby the entire fight.  Eventually we killed off all <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;mobs.  All told, I think we were fighting lizards continuously for over 15<br/>\n&gt;minutes.   We all stood around in disbelief at what we had just <br/>\n&gt;accomplished.<br/>\n&gt;Final tally was Us:15 Lizards:0.  Everyone started hooting and hollering <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;patting each other on the back.  Everyone was out of mana but no one was <br/>\n&gt;below<br/>\n&gt;60% health.  Everyone agreed that the reason for our success were me and <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;other bard keeping all the mobs out of the fight.  To say the least I was<br/>\n&gt;ecstatic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In hindsight, I wished I would have turned on the log file function prior <br/>\n&gt;to the<br/>\n&gt;fight so I could have collected some test data for the ongoing Lullaby <br/>\n&gt;issue.<br/>\n&gt;Like so many of us, I was convinced the song was broken.  It may be that <br/>\n&gt;two<br/>\n&gt;bards singing Lullaby (one continuously and the other weaving it in) <br/>\n&gt;negated the<br/>\n&gt;problem of mobs still attacking after the initial resist.  Even if a mob<br/>\n&gt;resisted my song the first time, he still had to resist the other bards <br/>\n&gt;song.<br/>\n&gt;I think it also helped that my charisma was 149 and the other bards was 145<br/>\n&gt;(with sympathetic aura buff).  All I can say is that last night was the <br/>\n&gt;most fun<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve had playing EQ in a long time and that I&#39;m further convinced that a <br/>\n&gt;bard<br/>\n&gt;and enchanter in the same group make a lethal combination.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
