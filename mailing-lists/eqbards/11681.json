I ended up giving someone a piece of my mind last night.  I was charming hill giants in rathe<br/>\nmountains (ok, it&#39;s boring, but I needed some cash).  There was one relatively inactive group there when I<br/>\ngot there.  They were slowly pulling HGs, and were hanging out by the lizard camp.  So I headed back to<br/>\nthe large area in the corner tucked in the back of the hill.  I pulled a couple giants and was doing my<br/>\nthing.  I had killed one and had pulled the next, and they were beating on each other happily, when I spot<br/>\na druid in wolf form heading toward them.  Oh great, I thought, someone to come in and disrupt my chores.<br/>\nWell, the druid moved closer and closer to the pair, finally stopping right at their feet.  Well, wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nyou know, the giant came un-charmed, and of course the one I hadn&#39;t charmed started beating on him.  Chaos<br/>\nensued as I tried to re-charm (which is time consuming with that 80% resist rate at my level).  He ran to<br/>\nhis group, which was unprepared, and had a casualty.  I managed to recharm, and eventually succeeded in<br/>\nfinishing the job.  Well, this was all unfortunate, but then the druid sends me a nasty tell saying,<br/>\n&quot;Dammit!  Stop training HG&#39;s onto us!&quot;  And additionally, &quot;I hate that bard HG kiting crap!  It gets<br/>\ninnocent people killed!&quot;  Well, needless to say I chewed him out.  Amazingly (unlike other similar<br/>\nencounters) he came around and we agreed it would be ok if I stayed in my corner (which I had been doing<br/>\nanyway) and didn&#39;t train the giants around.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I eventually stopped anyway, because a 45th level wizard came in and was doin a pretty good job<br/>\nclearing the area of all but the occasional single pop of HGs (can&#39;t do much with just one!   :)  This was<br/>\nfine.  Fairly done, and the biggest drawback to using charm in the first place.  Lack of mobs to charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust though I&#39;d share, since it was so rediculously moronic.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhamer of E&#39;Ci, an occam&#39;s razor away from 31st level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBard wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; /begin rant<br/>\n&gt; They were just a bunch of conspiracy theorist idiots then.
