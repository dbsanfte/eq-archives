Unless you<br/>\nare planning on getting Dragon faction (and perhaps that could even be<br/>\nrepaired) you should go to Skyshrine and camp the Sentry and Guardian Armor.<br/>\nAt 49 you&#39;ll even get some XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - you could go to Icewell Keep and &quot;beg&quot; for armor drops if you can&#39;t<br/>\nget higher levels to let you group with them (if you aren&#39;t pro-Coldains -<br/>\nyou may even get a group as people always like a mana battery even if you<br/>\nare low level wise).<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n56 &lt;-Level<br/>\nDragons of Kel&#39;Dar - Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
