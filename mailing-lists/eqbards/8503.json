A warrior in banded will outlast (against the same mob) a<br/>\nbard of equal level in better armor simply because the warrior will have<br/>\nlike TRIPLE the hitpoints, and that will make a ton of difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is true with rangers vs. warriors - for example, my ranger in<br/>\nmostly rubicite will not be as good of a tank as a warrior my level in<br/>\nbanded - just because of the hitpoint difference. I would say this<br/>\ndifference would be much more pronounced if you use a bard in the example,<br/>\nbecause bards have even LESS hitpoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m just talking about taking damage - sure, bards can use songs to<br/>\ncounter their disadvantages. But, my point is that better armor will not<br/>\nmake a bard a better tank than a warrior of equal level.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia d&#39;Allaney</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
