Say each buff lasts 60<br/>\nminutes.  Say you meditate back one bubble a minute.  That<br/>\nmeans you can keep a maximum of 60 buffs up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many buffs you can cast going from FM to OOM is pretty<br/>\nirrelevant since buffing is almost always done during<br/>\ndowntime.  What matters is how many buffs your mana<br/>\nregeneration rate allows you to maintain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the type of analysis Verant failed to do (and is<br/>\nfailing to do) every time they go off on one of their &quot;but<br/>\nbards use no mana!&quot; tangents.  No we don&#39;t use mana, but<br/>\nbecause of the short lifespan of our songs and the<br/>\n(relatively) long &quot;casting time&quot; for our songs, it&#39;s pretty<br/>\nmuch the same thing as using mana.  In fact, you can think of<br/>\nour songs as spells that last 12 seconds, require 5 bubbles of<br/>\nmana to cast, and our mana regen rate gives us back 5 bubbles<br/>\nevery 3 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
