I&#39;m currently working<br/>\ntoward getting some other weapons myself - my husband is holding a staff of<br/>\nwrithing for me - for when I get to 28 (that&#39;s the level it will proc,<br/>\nright?). And eventually, I hope to have an obsidian shard, but that might be<br/>\na ways off. I finally have a dragoon dirk in my ranged slot, [thanks to a<br/>\nguild member who said he just had it rotting away in the bank] - and the<br/>\nother weapon I use currently is a water crystal staff. It&#39;s a tad heavy -<br/>\npulls my stamina down unless my enchanting husband is there to cast<br/>\naugmentation on me. But the fun thing is this: Frequently in battle, both<br/>\nthe whip (lifetap-necro spell) and the staff (shallow breath-enchanter<br/>\nspell) have proc&#39;d at the same time... quite fun to see both messages &quot;...<br/>\nbeam a smile... ahh you feel better&quot; and &quot;______ begins to choke&quot;. Guess I&#39;m<br/>\nquite the enchanting necro bard... hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrangwen Incantare - 26th Level Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nThe Lavender-Eyed Lady of Song<br/>\nThe Rathe (another VERY crowded server)<br/>\n======</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
