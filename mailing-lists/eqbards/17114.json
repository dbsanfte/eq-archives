We killed Vox last night<br/>\n&gt; with 30ish<br/>\n&gt; people.  2 clerics, 1 bard, nobody died.  Last time we killed her we also<br/>\n&gt; had no deaths.  Nags was almost as easy.<br/>\n&gt; My guild is a great bunch of people, but I have trouble believing<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re that<br/>\n&gt; good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else have an easier than normal time?  Possible dragon nerf?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elwyn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!<br/>\n&gt; 1.
