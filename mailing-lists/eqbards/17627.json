There might have been one, but it was slight if so, none of the<br/>\nthirty or so groups I tried it on showed any change.  Anyone see a change in<br/>\nany other targeted instrument songs?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, did anyone else notice that their own footsteps increased in volume by<br/>\nabout a factor of 10 with the patch?  I had to turn the sound down so that<br/>\nenvironment noises like the crickets in Innothoule were silent before I<br/>\ncould stand the sound of my own footsteps.  I still don&#39;t hear anything of<br/>\nother people&#39;s/mob&#39;s footsteps.  I asked around and it seemed that about two<br/>\nthirds of the people experienced something similar.  15 of us in Steamfont<br/>\n/bugged it for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 12, 2000 10:01 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] New songs!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nlol that&#39;s the only thing we could think of too.  i seriously hope it is<br/>\nchanged to Party soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This song appears to be most useful in power-levelling <br/>\n&gt; twinks, something I<br/>\n&gt; thought Verant wasn&#39;t big on.
