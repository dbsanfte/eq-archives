Well, you can but the<br/>\nsecond song never makes it into inventory. If you are going on a song run<br/>\nfor yourself and a friend bard I&#39;d suggest buying your&#39;s, scribing it, and<br/>\nthen buying your friend&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for what Lament does, for a very brief period of time the creature will<br/>\nact as if it doesn&#39;t know you are there. This is good for those things that<br/>\nare &quot;KOS&quot; (Kill On Sight) that attack you when you get close. Also if you<br/>\ncome across a group of four creatures, play it on three, then attack the<br/>\nfourth, the other three are much less likely to help out their comrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rodney Morris [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rodmorris@...\">rodmorris@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 23, 1999 11:09 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Kelin&#39;s Lament<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Rodney Morris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rodmorris@...\">rodmorris@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I made the trip to the Elven land last night to purchase<br/>\nKelin&#39;s Lament (I purchased Cinda&#39;s Carillion too, to save<br/>\nanother trip).  I hope everybody is aware that unscribed songs<br/>\non your person will disappear upon your death.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I tried using it (lament, that is), and besides &quot;&lt;creature&gt;<br/>\nlooks sad&quot; or just pissing it off and making it come at me, I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t figure out what it does.<br/>\nAlso I noticed that it only lasts a single beat if it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone tell me what Lament does, and what it&#39;s useful for?<br/>\n<br/>\nMully<br/>\n10th Level, Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nAre you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nFriends tell friends about ONElist!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
