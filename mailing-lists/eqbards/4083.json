I have an Enchantress I group <br/>\nwith whenever possible, with her Charms, MR reducing spells, and speed buffs <br/>\nwe make a deadly team.  Also Enchaters are one of the two classes that can <br/>\nbuff Charisma :) Plus she loves the Animal Cookies I bake her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Well, I was teamed with a level 16 Enchanter with a pet so maybe you<br/>\n&gt;      would need a small party.  We were very careful to only take on one <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;      a time and did use the NPC camp for backup, but the exp. and the loot<br/>\n&gt;      was great!  Most of my suggestions assume at least a small party, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;      not much for soloing since Bards are ever so much more efficient with<br/>\n&gt;      groups.  I also tend to push my limits... I die on average of 2 or 3<br/>\n&gt;      times a level.  (can you say reckless?  That guy in &#39;Lethal Weapon&#39; <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;      my hero... :)  )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      BTW the Bard/Enchanter mini team rocks!  You can take on MOB&#39;s that<br/>\n&gt;      would normally reduce you to baking ingredients.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      Bujold  18th<br/>\n&gt;      Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
