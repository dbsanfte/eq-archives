For example, with STR it is obvious that each point of STR<br/>\nallows you to carry 1 more point of weight on your person, however the<br/>\ndamage bonuses that STR give are not as obvious and may only jump in 5 or 10<br/>\npoint increments.  Another example, I hear that having a CHA above 120 does<br/>\nnot seem to affect NPC selling prices any further, i.e., CHA of 150 gives<br/>\nyou the same selling price as CHA 120 - although I have no hard data to back<br/>\nthis up.  If you play around with stat increasing items and look at how they<br/>\naffect your attack numbers and AC numbers you will also notice that there is<br/>\nanother mysterious formula working there and that changes are not applied in<br/>\na directly 1 to 1 ratio.  You may also notice that some of those stats go up<br/>\nwhen you level as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t do all the number crunching but tend to trust those of us<br/>\non this list that do, especially those of us who are of a higher level than<br/>\nmyself - however, with a CHA of 95 one night, I got a enchanter to boost me<br/>\nup above 100 and did notice that my songs such as root and binding were<br/>\nresisted less. Maybe a coincidence, but I was sold, I immediately set out to<br/>\nbring my CHA up above 100 with items.  In my mind it helps, but I can&#39;t be<br/>\nsure - I RP a lot anyway so just having a high CHA fits in with the<br/>\ncharacter that I role-play so I like it regardless - Plus I buy stuff for my<br/>\nfriends now because between my CHA and my carillion I get the best prices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I missed you last night, we&#39;ll have to try and get together again<br/>\nsometime...its been a while...<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nBard of the 24th song (I got my sparkles last night!)<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 11, 1999 6:29 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Charisma vs Mob Resist Part 2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK, call me stupid but I&#39;m still not sure how to interpret <br/>\n&gt; this.  The way I<br/>\n&gt; read it, your Charisma stat has no impact whatsoever on your <br/>\n&gt; chances to<br/>\n&gt; resist a spell directed at you.  Makes sense to me.  The <br/>\n&gt; second sentence<br/>\n&gt; &quot;..interact/affect creatures&quot; seems to indicate that a higher <br/>\n&gt; charisma means<br/>\n&gt; you have a better chance of affecting mobs with your songs, <br/>\n&gt; i.e. less chance<br/>\n&gt; for them to resist.  This reopens the issue I raised last <br/>\n&gt; week.  Example:<br/>\n&gt; Two 20th level bards attempt to use Lullaby song against a <br/>\n&gt; 23d level mob.<br/>\n&gt; One bard has a charisma of 85.  The other bard has charisma <br/>\n&gt; of 100.  Singing<br/>\n&gt; and instrument skills both the same.  Based on how I <br/>\n&gt; interpret Butler&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; comment, the bard with the 100 charisma has a better chance <br/>\n&gt; of putting the<br/>\n&gt; mob to sleep.  If charisma has no effect on mob resistance, <br/>\n&gt; then both bards<br/>\n&gt; would have an equal chance of putting the mob to sleep.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would really like to know the correct answer to this issue. <br/>\n&gt;  I wear items<br/>\n&gt; that increase my charisma for the sole purpose of increasing <br/>\n&gt; my chances of<br/>\n&gt; affecting mobs with my songs.  I have other items I can wear <br/>\n&gt; that increase<br/>\n&gt; other stats as well as improve my AC.  If charisma doesn&#39;t affect mobs<br/>\n&gt; resistance, there is no reason, for me to wear the charisma <br/>\n&gt; increasing items<br/>\n&gt; unless I am selling stuff to merchants.  I guess wearing the <br/>\n&gt; charisma items<br/>\n&gt; to reduce my chance of missing notes is a reason to wear them <br/>\n&gt; but I could<br/>\n&gt; live with missing the notes in exchange for the benefit the <br/>\n&gt; other items<br/>\n&gt; give.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     one&#39;s saves. Your charisma is related to how well you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Bard&#39;s singing skill has a check against charisma. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess this explains where the talk about charisma affecting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; missed notes started.  And the talk about charisma not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; affecting resists is a misinterpretation (your charisma does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not affect *your* resist rate).
