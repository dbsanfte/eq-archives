That&#39;s where I and my level <br/>\n14 Shaman husband are hunting right now.  There are planty of blue <br/>\nand even mobs (and yellow and red to keep the adreneline pubmping) to <br/>\nbeat up on.  We&#39;re  fighting just north of the lake, not too far from <br/>\nthe river.  I got about a bubble and a half of exp in around an hour <br/>\nof fighting last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also got a chance to practice a technique I learned from this <br/>\nlist.  My husband pulled a goblin skirmisher and just as he was <br/>\nreaching me, a goblin battlemaster decided to join in.  We fought the <br/>\n2 for a bit, but as the battlemaster was red to me and beating on me, <br/>\nthings were not going well.  I decided discretion was the key here <br/>\nand started to run toward the zone (I had SoW, so didn&#39;t need to fire <br/>\nup Selo&#39;s).  As I ran, with one mob behind me and one still fighting <br/>\nmy husband (who was doing fine with the one) I remembered some <br/>\ndiscussions about crowd control and running circles with mobs in <br/>\ntow.  So I made sure I had my mandolin equipped and made a wide turn <br/>\nback while healing myself.  Once the battle was done I deposited the <br/>\nextra mob back where we were originally fighting and we finished him <br/>\noff.  So much better getting exp on the 2 mobs than zoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdagia, Bard of 12 Bellows, Druzzil Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
