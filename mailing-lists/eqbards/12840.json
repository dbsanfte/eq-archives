Second<br/>\n  one on our server to my knowledge.  I know the bard with the first<br/>\n  drop.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Members of the Pantheon killed him after they themselves had perished<br/>\n  twice to the bugger and us once.  I swear the guy was doing donuts<br/>\n  around the plane looking for people to kill.  That, and the 4 mob<br/>\n  train he was carrying around with him didn&#39;t help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Needless to say, I was the only bard on the plane at the time.<br/>\n  Unfortunately, I have to wait until Maestro drops another, since<br/>\n  the weapon was &#39;accidentally&#39; looted by someone who cannot use it.<br/>\n  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you use your evensong over your yk, Shada?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
