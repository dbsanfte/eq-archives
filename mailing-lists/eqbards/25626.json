I am having tons of fun and<br/>\nhavent been online in EQ for weeks and have not ordered SOL (So Out of<br/>\nLUCK?), but if DA get boring I proberly will be back.<br/>\nSofar DAoC have been perfect for my limited playtime.. It runs flawlessly on<br/>\nmy Athlon 600MHz with 256MB ram, SBlive and a 256Kbit ADSL connection.<br/>\nOnly way DAoC lacks in comparision to EQ is:<br/>\n- Graphics they are a bit more dull than EQ IMO... Better in some ways, but<br/>\nboring landscape and mobs..<br/>\nWell they still update mob models. So there is hope :)<br/>\n- Difficualty level. I fear that DA is too easy for my liking, but I guess<br/>\nthat only time will tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker semi retired Minstrel on bertox<br/>\nMusiker Midgaard Skald on Lancelot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Christopher Sanders [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christopher.sanders@...\">christopher.sanders@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 5. december 2001 15:17<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Another issue...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would assume dx8.1.  I installed it, no problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My first impression, I&#39;m really disappointed, overall.  I now <br/>\n&gt; hate the way I<br/>\n&gt; look...and I see no way to change that, guess it&#39;s back to <br/>\n&gt; the old models<br/>\n&gt; for me, and I so wanted to see everyone on horses.  :(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hate the bard animations.  Like someone said before, way <br/>\n&gt; too fast.  Still<br/>\n&gt; strumming the drum, too.  I really, really, *REALLY* hate <br/>\n&gt; that when I sit, I<br/>\n&gt; sit on my knees like a prim little princess...I&#39;m *very* <br/>\n&gt; ticked about that.<br/>\n&gt; I see most everyone else does as well...it&#39;s fine for the female<br/>\n&gt; models...but the male models really do need the indian style <br/>\n&gt; sit model back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; According to specs, my machine is sufficient to load most of <br/>\n&gt; the new models<br/>\n&gt; (15, so it says), as well as the new, hi-res textures.  Well, <br/>\n&gt; I hope they<br/>\n&gt; make some improvements, or some system tweaks come out, because it was<br/>\n&gt; borderline unplayable, when I went with the recommended <br/>\n&gt; setup.  Perhaps I<br/>\n&gt; just need to defrag my hard drive...don&#39;t know, but nothing <br/>\n&gt; else performs<br/>\n&gt; that badly.  I actually had times when I was turning, and <br/>\n&gt; everything would<br/>\n&gt; stop for 7-10 seconds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Load times...load times are rotten, horrid, and unacceptable. <br/>\n&gt;  No need to<br/>\n&gt; set /afk anymore, just hit a zone line...you&#39;ve got plenty of <br/>\n&gt; time to go to<br/>\n&gt; the bathroom and freshen your drink.  When I went to quit, <br/>\n&gt; from /camp to<br/>\n&gt; character select literally took 4 or 5 minutes.  Not seemed <br/>\n&gt; like.  Took.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My system?  1.0 Ghz, 256 MB Ram, Geforce 256 DDR, SB Live <br/>\n&gt; Xgamer, are the<br/>\n&gt; important parts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, maybe I do have to tweak my system.  I believe I still have my TnL<br/>\n&gt; disabled, so I&#39;ll try that, as well as playing with the settings and<br/>\n&gt; defragging...so I&#39;ll admit, it could be me...but we&#39;ll see.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t been to Luclin yet.  As soon as I realized my songs <br/>\n&gt; were messed, I<br/>\n&gt; just logged.  It took me from 6pm to 11:30pm to patch.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It can only get better from here...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Atonal<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nygaard, Jeff [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff.nygaard@...\">jeff.nygaard@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 05, 2001 8:51 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Another issue...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, which one is it? Do I need directx8.0 or directx8.1? I <br/>\n&gt; still do not have<br/>\n&gt; SoL yet, but I should have it by weeks end, BUT I want to log <br/>\n&gt; onto EQ to<br/>\n&gt; check and see if Dain has spawned in Icewell Keep. I&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; waiting for<br/>\n&gt; over a week now to see this short little sob and he has yet <br/>\n&gt; to show his<br/>\n&gt; face. I need him to spawn to complete my 9th Coldain Ring <br/>\n&gt; quest. On my way<br/>\n&gt; out to work this morning I was going to see if Dain was up, <br/>\n&gt; so I tried to<br/>\n&gt; log in real fast, but I couldn&#39;t get the patch to start. I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; time to play EQ last night. Yesterday at work, I tore myself <br/>\n&gt; away from my<br/>\n&gt; work and emailed to my home address DirectX8 and my newest <br/>\n&gt; sound and video<br/>\n&gt; drivers. I just need to install them now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, so now for my question, is the reason I couldn&#39;t log on <br/>\n&gt; this morning<br/>\n&gt; because I have not downloaded DirectX yet? If so, which <br/>\n&gt; DirectX do I need<br/>\n&gt; 8.0 or 8.1?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the help!
