When I<br/>\nlogged on, there were less than 15 people in the zone.  The entire time I was in<br/>\nMistmoore, my packet loss percentage never went below 25%.  A guildmate was also<br/>\nin MM and I asked if they were having problems as well.  They stated they<br/>\nweren&#39;t having any problems and suggested I quit the game completely and log<br/>\nback in.  Tried that but it didn&#39;t do any good.  Decided to go ahead and play<br/>\ndespite the lag.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGot into a fight in the GY and packet loss zoomed up to over 50%.  Was fighting<br/>\na pledge familiar that started to run away.  Tried to cast chains on it but, due<br/>\nto the lag, it ran down the cave and soon brought a train of ancilles back with<br/>\nhim.  I ended up dying and appeared at my bind spot in GFAY.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got to GFAY, I had absolutely no lag problems whatsoever.  Packet loss<br/>\nwas 0% and the lag number was very low.  LFAY was the same as well.  As soon as<br/>\nI zoned back into MM, packet loss went back up to over 25%.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing since April and I have never had lag problems like I did last<br/>\nnight.  Any idea what was the cause? I know MM is considered a buggy zone but<br/>\nthere weren&#39;t that many people in MM and the other five people in my group were<br/>\nhaving no problems whatsoever.  Don&#39;t think it was my connection (cable modem)<br/>\nbecause I had no lag problems when I was in GFAY and LFAY.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
