Every class has it&#39;s purpose and the<br/>\nreason necros have good pets is because they suck in groups. It&#39;s true they<br/>\ncan&#39;t dish damage even at high level there not that great in groups. About<br/>\nall they have are their pets and a dd that has a long ass receast time and<br/>\nis basically bad not to mention it&#39;s fire based which means most places it<br/>\nwill get resisted. The dots take over 2 minutes to use so basically I got my<br/>\npet left over and a undead nuke spell. So basically if I&#39;m not hunting<br/>\nundead I&#39;m screwed in groups. Especially in Solusk dungeons where my best<br/>\ndot and my best dd are automatically resisted. So now I&#39;m left with a pet.<br/>\nSee why necros pets are so powerful now?<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, January 27, 2000 8:01 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Thu, 27 Jan 2000, Naeeldar wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Um who said&#39;s a pet isn&#39;t supposed to be better then another class?
