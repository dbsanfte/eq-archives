This is already<br/>\ndone in rare cases - like to get the screaming mace. It&#39;s voluntary that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking spawn points random - or a certain item drop within a zone on any X<br/>\nlevel critter will also go much farther to help the problem of camping than<br/>\nany change they have made so far. No drop is just a bandaid - it&#39;s not a<br/>\ncure for the disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers will always take the shortest route to the cheese.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers will always want something if it exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are not BAD things - you just need other options that are more<br/>\nattractive to them than passing down and twinking their newer characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nServers go thru growth cycles - it&#39;s predictable from the day one goes up,<br/>\nall you can do is provide other outlets for goods and money to take them<br/>\nback OUT of the economy. A player that is intent on becoming filthy rich<br/>\nand having the best items in the game WILL do so - and there is really no<br/>\nreason for him not to - it&#39;s called a goal. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well I dont have any perfect sollution to the degradiation of worth.
