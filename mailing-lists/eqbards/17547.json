There&#39;s a<br/>\nstrong possibility you&#39;ll never want to use your weapons again<br/>\n(well, until you run into a spite golem :).  Before the Chant<br/>\nseries was fixed, the only other real alternative was the<br/>\nPsalms for the damage shield.  Binding also is useful at times<br/>\nsince it doesn&#39;t break snare nor mez.  It *may* prevent some<br/>\nlower level slowdowns from sticking however.  But in most<br/>\ncases when facing multiple mobs, slowing down 5 mobs until the<br/>\nenchanter can get them mezed is more useful than slowing down<br/>\njust the one mob that the group is fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
