Songs that<br/>\nare totally useless or are too weak at the level you get them can be<br/>\nutterly devastating in the 30s and 40s. Also, once you get tracking at<br/>\nL35, let me tell you folks, we got the last laugh on any other class.<br/>\nSure it would have been nice to have tracking at a lower level, but in<br/>\nthe 40-50 range, a bard is powerful enough to solo many rare spawns, and<br/>\nyou can track them down [fingers her Pegasus Feather Cloak off Quillmane<br/>\n;)]!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was L8, I was terribly frustrated with being a bard, complete<br/>\nwith my patchwork leather and storebought shield and storebought<br/>\nlongsword. I then heard of a new bard mailing list, that gave me alot of<br/>\nhelpful tips and explained many things I didn&#39;t understand. It explained<br/>\nwe could twists songs, and how to set up a hot key bank to make<br/>\nswitching to instrument much more painless. The list was eqbards. ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nI was off the list for a couple months while moving, sorry to make a<br/>\nstir with coming back! However, it&#39;s my goal to help share some of the<br/>\ngreat tricks I&#39;ve learned through my bizarre and amusing travels, just<br/>\nas so long ago someone explained how we could play more than 1 song at a<br/>\ntime. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
