The closest I&#39;ve<br/>\nheard to these bugs being fixed is, &quot;after E3.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTalonus<br/>\nTraveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The following is from a recent post on EQVault.  The original poster asks<br/>\n&gt; some questions that I&#39;m sure we would all liked officially answered.  I<br/>\n&gt; especially like his suggestion for changing the effects of the 11th level<br/>\n&gt; song to where it gives a charisma boost.<br/>\n&gt; Also, does anyone know if anyone from Verant subscribes to this list.<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; Original post:<br/>\n&gt; Not complaining but does anyone know when some bard bugs are going to be<br/>\n&gt; fixed? I&#39;&#39;ve never gotten a straight answer outta GMs, and guides never seem<br/>\n&gt; to know so here goes...First, resistances. Some people say they work, others<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t. My personal experiences are ones saying they don&#39;t. I still have the<br/>\n&gt; same amount of resistance to magic as I did before using these songs.<br/>\n&gt; Second, when will the broken, or seriously underpowered songs be fixed, ya<br/>\n&gt; know the level 11 one, and the level 14 one. The level 11 one seems to be<br/>\n&gt; either seriously underpowered or broke. I&#39;d personally love just to have it<br/>\n&gt; up my charisma some instead of what it does currently, and for the 14th<br/>\n&gt; level one, well replace it, it doesn&#39;t work as all people know. Third, when<br/>\n&gt; will that lovely weapon bug be fixed. Its the one where bard songs get<br/>\n&gt; &quot;stuck&quot; until we either zone, camp, or forecfully miss a note when using a<br/>\n&gt; weapon that casts a magic spel.(e.g. polished granite tomhawk, and screaming<br/>\n&gt; mace), Fourth(entering small complaining), is there a purpose to capping<br/>\n&gt; many of our skills so low? I&#39;ve heard from people with hide and sneaking<br/>\n&gt; double of our cap of 40, saying that it doesn&#39;t work well. I know we&#39;re not<br/>\n&gt; supposed to master anything, but we should at least be able to get a good or<br/>\n&gt; very good rating in em, cause a jack of all trades would train to the point<br/>\n&gt; where a skill would be actually useful eh? Last, is it a bug that monsters<br/>\n&gt; tend to attack us even when they are in battle with other people? Example,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m standing around, watching some people fight a gnoll flamepaw. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; neither attacking, nor standing very close, but the monster suddenly starts<br/>\n&gt; using spells on me. Instead of trying to kill the people killing it, it<br/>\n&gt; starts to cast drowsy, walking sleep, and root on a poor bard who was<br/>\n&gt; standing around doing nothing. I&#39;d hate to see what happens at higher levels<br/>\n&gt; to bards sitting around heh.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
