My comment wasn&#39;t really directed at you in<br/>\n&gt; particular but in general when I see people post &quot;Blah Blah since<br/>\n&gt; Beta 1&quot; as part of their sig line, it usually comes when they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; contradicting someone else&#39;s opinion... To me, it seems like they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; saying, &quot;I&#39;ve been around longer than you, so I know.&quot;  I really<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t buy into that philosophy and personally don&#39;t think there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; anything more special about a Level 60 Bard compared to a Level 25<br/>\n&gt; Bard.  Or someone who&#39;s been playing since 4000 BC vs. someone who<br/>\n&gt; bought the game yesterday.  Obviously, not everyone who uses a<br/>\n&gt; similar sig is implying the same thing and that&#39;s where some more<br/>\n&gt; information would have been important to illustrate what I meant.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for what looked like a cheap shot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Kunark since... well, Kunark came out. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lyrnia Jongleur<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Bard of Norrath since Beta 2&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
