One pulse of<br/>\nSelo&#39;s and everyone in your party who was in range has just had their<br/>\nSelo&#39;s wiped away. Their SoW icon is still there, but the speed boost<br/>\nfrom it is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that EQ does is not let speed-related effects stack at<br/>\nall.  If you have SoW, and you get rooted, SoW is gone.  If you are<br/>\nrooted and sing Selo&#39;s or get SoW cast upon you, the root is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
