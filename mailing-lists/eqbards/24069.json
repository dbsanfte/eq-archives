It mostly seems to be<br/>\n&gt;rhetorical debate; or perhaps the comment that people are exaggerating too<br/>\n&gt;much.  Keep in mind that  - like analogies exaggerating the opposite of what<br/>\n&gt;you are arguing is also a rhetorical device.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well it started out by someone saying dirge was useless due to recast time and<br/>\nresists.  i said what resist problem, i never have any, and it is useful in some<br/>\nsituations including pvp.  then someone said pvp people don&#39;t matter because<br/>\nthey are an insignificant minority, to which i pointed out that of all the people who<br/>\nplay everquest, there are MORE pvp players than there are bards, and that it was<br/>\nvery easy to dismiss a minority as insignificant when you were not in that minority.<br/>\n<br/>\nthen it kind of morphed into whether bards were overpowered or not and whether or<br/>\nnot you can factor in difficulty of play into balancing class power or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t mean this as a flame to Whee, (by singling him out); but the<br/>\n&gt;argument (if I&#39;m not following it correctly I apologize in advance) seems to<br/>\n&gt;be that the thread is Whee one side and everyone else (who participating in<br/>\n&gt;the thread) on the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>actually blitz i believe agrees with me on the difficulty of play thing, and that bards<br/>\nare not underpowered, altho i think he thinks they are balanced, while i think we are<br/>\noverpowered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1) DDD - are you saying that this IS a useful song?  That 99 pct of the<br/>\n&gt;Bards are wrong - that it is VERY useful; or simply that it is very slightly<br/>\n&gt;useful and we are &quot;ridiculously exaggerating&quot; by saying something is<br/>\n&gt;&quot;completely&quot; useless instead of &quot;very marginally&quot; useless.  Not MUCH of an<br/>\n&gt;exaggeration there if you ask me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>out of that 99 percent, how many have actually thought about good ways to use<br/>\nthe song and how many are simply agreeing with someone who told them at one<br/>\ntime &#39;&#39;this song is useless&#39;&#39;.  i pointed out 2 good ways to get quite a bit of damage<br/>\nout of this song (one of which was in an enchanter group, where many people think<br/>\nthey are useless).  the song has been compared to harm touch, and i think it compares<br/>\nfavorably to harmtouch with respect to damage/refresh time.  i don&#39;t see anyone saying<br/>\nharmtouch is useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) The PvP thing was argued a bit - but someone pointed out how Verant has<br/>\n&gt;made it very clear they claim they are specifically tuning this song to<br/>\n&gt;balance bards across the board.  There has been no indication that this is a<br/>\n&gt;PVP.  While it could be a &quot;stealth component&quot; of the tuning a) I doubt it<br/>\n&gt;and b) it&#39;s not taking the issue at face value especially considering the<br/>\n&gt;whole &quot;Class Balance&quot; threads<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>most of the argument about pvp centered around whether or not a minority<br/>\nof customers could be arbitrarily considered insignificant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3) Bards are over powered.  You haven&#39;t really spent much time arguing<br/>\n&gt;that - and I&#39;m not quite clear on your argument for that.   Perhaps it is<br/>\n&gt;due to soloing ability.  I despise soloing and never do it.  Personally - if<br/>\n&gt;you were to judge EQ as a solo game; it is VERY poor.  Any single-player RPG<br/>\n&gt;game rings around EQ as a single-player game.  If I felt like single-player<br/>\n&gt;gaming I&#39;d play BG2.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i almost never solo.  i mean we are over powered with respect to other classes in a group<br/>\nsetting, more so in broken groups than cle/enc/war groups, but the fact that we can<br/>\nmake a group without a cleric, enchanter, OR warrior able to go deep into sebilis or<br/>\nhowling stones or karnors seems pretty powerful to me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
