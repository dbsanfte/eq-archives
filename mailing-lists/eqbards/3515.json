I have been known to solo<br/>\non occasion but most often can be found fighting with my sister Jyora, her<br/>\nbetrothed Tyldaryn and my own beloved Theodoric.  The four of us have a<br/>\npersonal vendetta against all orcs and will pause to slay any that cross our<br/>\npath.  Whereever I am is my least favorite place to die at the hands of evil<br/>\nand at the moment, we fight in the icy halls of Castle Permafrost.  If I<br/>\nrecall correctly, the gods have been kind to me in that I have always had<br/>\ngood friends at my side to protect me as I retrieved my belongings and hence<br/>\nhave neer died in doing so.  However I do not believe I have been so blessed<br/>\nas to pass even a single measure of skill without paying for it with my life<br/>\nat least once.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I refer to the practice of playing several songs at once to gain<br/>\nthe benefits of all as Juggling.  I personally have no use for a Dragoon<br/>\nDirk as the long sword and the axe are my weapons of choice, though my<br/>\nbeloved has one that he seems quite fond of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that is everything.  Feel free to ask if I have missed any of your<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiani MystWeaver<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 4:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Greetings All!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Welcome~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Good to meet you - we all wanna know:<br/>\n&gt;what level you are;<br/>\n&gt;do you party or solo;<br/>\n&gt;fav blue to kill;<br/>\n&gt;unfav place to die in;<br/>\n&gt;most number of deaths getting a corpse back;<br/>\n&gt;most number of levels with no death (if any :);<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;please also submit a suggestion for the term to describe playing two songs<br/>\n&gt;at once (don&#39;t say &#39;twisting&#39; &lt;g&gt;); run out and buy a Dragoon Dirk; and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tell<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;us what in your &#39;bio&#39; screen when ppl inspect your equipment.
