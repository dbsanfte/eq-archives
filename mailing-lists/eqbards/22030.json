Until we start encountering MOBs above level 51, we can break any area<br/>\n&gt; where we aren&#39;t going to get more than 3 MOBs in a pull (charm MOB 2 against MOB 3).  Even 4 MOB pulls<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t impossible, as long as the group knows to unload on the first one to take it out as fast as<br/>\n&gt; possible.  Once an area is broken, the MOBs are all single targets, and at that point, what do you need an<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter for?  In the cases cited, the Enchanter might make the initial break a bit easier (although not in<br/>\n&gt; all cases), but once beyond that point, the Bard is more generically useful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I mean effective as in how many mobs you can pull.
