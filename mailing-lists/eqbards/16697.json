It<br/>\n&gt;was merely an annoyance  that you had to wait a few seconds for some<br/>\n&gt;buffs to recycle.  I have no idea their system for cast time/recycle<br/>\n&gt;time on buffs, its seems totally random and thrown together (that would<br/>\n&gt;be a shocke eh?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Examples:  From lvl 9 to 19 cleric buffs are Holy Armor (lvl 4) and<br/>\n&gt;Center.  At 19 you get Spirit Armor and Daring.  Center has a medium<br/>\n&gt;recycle time and longer cast time then Holy armor.  However, Spirit<br/>\n&gt;Armor has a REALLY long cast and recycle time, yet daring is short in<br/>\n&gt;both cases.  I guess I fail to see the need to limit the power of spirit<br/>\n&gt;armor (gives 12 ac)...<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Matt DeBarger<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
