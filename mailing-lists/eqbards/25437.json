The class specific<br/>\narmor quests were designed to be completed by players and groups of players<br/>\nin the mid 30&#39;s to 40&#39;s.  And it&#39;s fun to actually go around and get the<br/>\nitems and do the quests (as opposed to &quot;/auc WTB: full lambent&quot; in Greater<br/>\nSpamdark or East Commonspam.  Full lambent is decent stuff for bard until he<br/>\ncan get to 48-52 and be doing Plane of Hate raids.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada: I too used to hear that having sta at 100+ would circumvent the bad<br/>\neffects when your sta bar id depleted.  I think that they have (stealth<br/>\nnerf) changed this recently.  Only last week, I had first hand experience<br/>\nwith a 56 warrior who has sta way over 100 and when his sta bar depleted,<br/>\nyou could see a noticeable slow down in his attack speed (and when he got a<br/>\nsta replenish buff, you could see it get noticable faster.) Even so, I would<br/>\nreccommend to ppl starting bards that they max out sta then put the rest in<br/>\ndex or str (forget cha - your cha is prolly fine and easy enough to boost<br/>\nwith jewel craft bracers etc.) Sta adds hps and every little bit helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nVirtuoso<br/>\n&lt;Mercenary Force&gt;<br/>\nSomewhere on Innoruuk... <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mercenaryforce.com\">http://www.mercenaryforce.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Onur Yildirim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:onur.yildirim@...\">onur.yildirim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 01, 2001 10:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Natural stats for a 31st level bard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHiyas,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first and still the only character in eq is a bard and because I am a<br/>\ncasual player I could just advance to the 31st level in some 6 months. We<br/>\nfounded a guild in Morrell Thule and the guild is faring hell better than me<br/>\nin comparison. Still as a newly founded guild we do not have a higher level<br/>\nor even a equal level bard, so I do have many questions concerning bards and<br/>\nhow should a bard played. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a curious and inexperienced bard speaking here so pls do not hesitate<br/>\nto help. :P</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
