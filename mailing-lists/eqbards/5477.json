If your group is<br/>\nbeing a good little group and all attacking the same target,<br/>\nthe others should fixate on you.  Back off to separate them<br/>\nfrom the one lone target.  Now target any of the ones you&#39;ve<br/>\nseparated and Pixie Strike it.  Back off again to separate<br/>\nthat one from the others (though at this point there really<br/>\nshould only be one other, otherwise you should be using<br/>\nLullaby).  Pixie Strike the remaining mob, then position<br/>\nyourself so you can easily target the two mobs you&#39;re pausing<br/>\nwhile getting a good view of the mob your group is fighting.<br/>\nWith lower level blues, I don&#39;t have a problem keeping two<br/>\nStruck while Chaining the mob my group is fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also a good tactic to separate out mobs for your<br/>\nenchanter to mesmerize if you have one.  It works especially<br/>\nwell if the enchanter can mesmerize the extras outside of<br/>\naggro range, so when they become un-mesmerized they either<br/>\nstand there or go away.  (Which incidently is probably why<br/>\nPixie Strike doesn&#39;t clear the hate list - if it did, we&#39;d be<br/>\nunstoppable.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
