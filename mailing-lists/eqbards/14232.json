I used<br/>\nit at first just to try it out and I liked the speed.  I saw the &quot;you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the will&quot; message frequently (I am only 21, it procs at 25).  Well, I<br/>\nput it back in to the bank for a while.  The other day I brought it back<br/>\nout in place of my tentacle whip because it is a difference of 2 or 3 in<br/>\nweight and I was on a fairly strict weight limit.  As I used it over the<br/>\nnext couple hours I didn&#39;t see a single &quot;will&quot; message.  I dual weiled the<br/>\nGHL last night for about 20 minutes and still didn&#39;t see any messages.  The<br/>\nother day I heard the Mistwalker&#39;s procs were nerfed to %25 of what it was.<br/>\n Does anyone know if the GHL has been nerfed also?  I enjoy the speed of<br/>\nthem, but if they are nerfed they become rather usless with a base of 3 damage.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
