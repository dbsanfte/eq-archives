go to<br/>\nwhich classes.  only thing i can think of as an example may be the cloak of<br/>\npiety, which would go to melee before casters.<br/>\n<br/>\none officer maintains the system but it is not his responsibility to know<br/>\nwho went to each raid.  we have 1 person who leads a raid (rotated between<br/>\nofficers, since leading a raid is no walk in the park), takes names, forms<br/>\ngroups, and e-mails that information to the officer who tracks points.  some<br/>\nraids are set points (trak=1 point, VS=0.5, PD=1.25, etc.).  other raids are<br/>\ncalculated depending on what drops and how many people are there (total<br/>\npoints of items dropped/number of people = how many points for that raid).<br/>\nthey have some type of script to easily update it on the web page.  some<br/>\nitems are set points (trak BP=20, VS legs=15) and other times items must be<br/>\ndetermined on the spot because they are new (like in VP).<br/>\n<br/>\nwell it sounds complicated but it is very straight-forward once you are<br/>\ninvolved in it.  almost everyone who sees a point system for the first time<br/>\nhates it or distrusts it or says they would never use it.  i can not say<br/>\nenough how much I LOVE IT.  it is very objective and very fair.  there are<br/>\nso many times something drops that there is not a lotto at all, and most<br/>\nlottoes are 2-3 people tops.  there was a pick-up nagafen raid once where 35<br/>\npeople were in on GoFM.<br/>\n<br/>\noh well, you could probably write a thesis on our damn system, which i came<br/>\nclose to, so i will stop now =)<br/>\n<br/>\nShada, 1.85 DKP<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; So you guys use a point system?  I seem to remember talking <br/>\n&gt; about this in a<br/>\n&gt; thread a while back.  We have discussed using points on and off but it<br/>\n&gt; always comes down to the fear that they won&#39;t be assigned <br/>\n&gt; uniformly and also<br/>\n&gt; that nobody would want the responsibility of maintaining such <br/>\n&gt; a thing.   We<br/>\n&gt; use more of a deferment system.. aka peer pressure.. which <br/>\n&gt; seems to work<br/>\n&gt; most of the time, though.  Do you like the point system? Can <br/>\n&gt; you use point<br/>\n&gt; for any item you want or does it have to be an item that is <br/>\n&gt; &quot;clearly&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; your class?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
