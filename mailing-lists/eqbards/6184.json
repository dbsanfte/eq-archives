His loot is kinda crazy - dwarf pickles and a recipe. And a<br/>\nfishing spear - crazy stabber wep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe recipe is an item needed for the Grobb Cleaver quest - hell how can this<br/>\nbe a spoiler if the quest guy tells you he wants it?  Ok, so maybe the<br/>\nlocation of this guy is the spoiler part.  And how is a troll/ogre supposed<br/>\nto get to the boats in east freeport any ways???  Could prolly sell the<br/>\nrecipe to some oger/troll interested in a Grobb Cleaver.<br/>\n<br/>\nMight be time to go  back and pay him another visit - esp if they nerf druid<br/>\nkiting and we cant pull avo&#39;s any more. bard 24, mage 25 with pet, 25 druid<br/>\n- druid finds and kites the avo down to basically very low hp then pulls him<br/>\nto the pet.  I barely have enough time to target and attack before the avo<br/>\nis dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise get into groups in HighKeep Lookout room and guard room for lo to<br/>\nmid 20&#39;s. Warrior room for later 20&#39;s and into 30&#39;s.
