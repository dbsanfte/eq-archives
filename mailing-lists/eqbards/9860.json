I for one<br/>\nam looking forward to the break.  Since I&#39;m in the US Army, I&#39;m off through<br/>\nMonday.  Combine that with my wife having to work(evil grin) and that means I<br/>\nget to play EQ all day tomorrow and Friday.  This will be the first time in a<br/>\nlong time I get to play for more than two hours at a time.  Just might get the<br/>\nchance to finally make 27th level and play around with the Charm song some.<br/>\nAlready printed out the song analysis that John Kim posted a few weeks back so I<br/>\nhave it to refer to.  Got my song scroll already in my backpack and I&#39;m even<br/>\ngonna go ahead and make my pet hotkeys now in anticipation of gaining that song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor you E&#39;ci bards (Kitasi, Faras, Aloro, Laluni, et.al.), look me up if you are<br/>\nonline.  Maybe we can all get together and work on getting quest components for<br/>\nour armor.  I&#39;m getting tired of MM and was thinking about heading to Solusek.<br/>\nAn enchanter friend who is 35th level has already agreed to help me fight giants<br/>\nin order to get some lambent stones as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTake care<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
