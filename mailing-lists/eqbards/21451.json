Why are people so<br/>\nupset about this being fixed?  It has historically been referred to as<br/>\nthe &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find it.  Well,<br/>\nits been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work that way and<br/>\neveryone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask them to fix<br/>\nbugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* bug!&quot;  A bug<br/>\nis a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of<br/>\nour overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.
