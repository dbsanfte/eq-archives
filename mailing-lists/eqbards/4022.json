You&#39;re being added to the respective hate lists<br/>\nfor helping your puller (via your songs).  Or the mob makes a<br/>\nbeeline for your puller, and just before he gets there he sees<br/>\nyou helping your puller (via your songs) and switches to<br/>\ntarget you.  Either way, things end up attacking the bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only solution I found was for the entire party to zone to <br/>\nclear everyone out of any hate lists.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
