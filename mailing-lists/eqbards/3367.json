Here&#39;s hard facts on the Mistmoore Battle Drum - same<br/>\nweight (0.5) as a hand drum, but definitely gives some increase in speed over the<br/>\nhanddrum when using selo&#39;s, and a documentable feature would be when using either<br/>\nGuardian or Elemental Rhythms it boosts resist by 5 points MORE than a handdrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat exactly is this noticable effect you refer to with the Lute of the Gypsy<br/>\nPrincess? There is no difference at all with Hymn of Restoration, nor with any<br/>\nother song as far as I can tell. I am Level 27. Feel free to quntify your<br/>\nstatement with something more useful then &quot;it does extra stuff&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; well the lute does have an effect, and it is pretty noticeble. ditto with<br/>\n&gt; the drums. I am pretty sure a lvl limit is in effect here though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gendal Concorden, lvl 39 bard </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
