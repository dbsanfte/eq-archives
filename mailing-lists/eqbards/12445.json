Lots and lots are<br/>\ngonna be seeing dragons - cus they are &quot;old enough&quot; and their guilds are<br/>\n&quot;big enough&quot; or they make alliances.  The first power guild on Innoruuk -<br/>\nearly Talquinn who are now Legions of Darkness (LoD - Elyana&#39;s guild) don&#39;t<br/>\nshare secrets.  My new guild The Pantheon has developed some methods of<br/>\ntheir own and are now able to muster raiding parties in short order.  Our<br/>\nNew Year&#39;s Eve run was the 3rd nite we went in and successfully cleared<br/>\neverything to the lair even though we were missing some key members of our<br/>\nteam and had guests along.   (Oh yeah - we have 3 of the 5 Skarlon swords<br/>\ntaken on our server ;p) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe times they are a&#39;changin&#39;...  I am damn glad to be there and to get the<br/>\nchance to see this stuff before it&#39;s &quot;/shout Level 50 Bard looking for a<br/>\ndragon party - will play mana song in combat!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI - I did not notice trouble with lag - both my songs played just fine.<br/>\nPerhaps there is more trouble when you melee and try to weave two songs.  My<br/>\ntanks were not feared one time nor was I.  Perhaps next time, when the<br/>\ndragon is well under half health, I will melee some - but in the beginning I<br/>\nprefer to defer any risk to my group. If they lose me to an angry dragon,<br/>\nthey lose a huge amount of MR.  My death hurts the whole group.  I worry<br/>\nmore about them all staying in song range so that they don&#39;t lose my buffs<br/>\nso I move around to keep them in range.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, speaking of lag, one time I was weaving mana song and heal song: mana<br/>\npulse, heal pulse, mana pulse, heal pulse.  An enchanter in the group said<br/>\nhe was not getting the mana effect because he was lagged.  Has this happened<br/>\nto anyone or is he just giving the standard caster line: &#39;play mana song and<br/>\nnothing else?&#39;  Now I play mana, mana, mana, then heal til I get the icon,<br/>\nthen mana til my icon drops, then heal til I get icon then back to mana.  Is<br/>\nit possible that a bard can weave songs faster than his party can get the<br/>\neffects?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, I think people are turning off the spam including the bard<br/>\nspam.  And so I get &quot;Sylly, play mana song&quot; a lot.  And I smile sweetly and<br/>\nsay &quot;Already am!&quot; And then quick start the song in case I forgot to switch<br/>\nafter combat ;p  Maybe its just me but I am a lot less sensitive to these<br/>\n&#39;friendly reminders&#39; now.  I sure wish that song had an icon - hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 40th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tPeter Hollmer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phollmer@...\">phollmer@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, January 05, 2000 5:39 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Digest Number 628<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI really wish Elyana still subscribed to this list.<br/>\n\t\tShe was doing both dragons, weekly, at lvl 42 - and<br/>\n\t\tthey never failed.
