(Charm<br/>\nis actually better on two-pulls, since the MOB is helping you out - unless it&#39;s a caster - but the<br/>\npractice is worth it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMez something, then just sing your normal song cycle until it breaks.  That gives you a feel for how long<br/>\nthe thing lasts in relation to your normal twist.  Mez never drops early unless the MOB is DOTted or hit,<br/>\nand it lasts a long time.  When mezzing a lot of stuff, I usually don&#39;t bother to fight; if I&#39;m down to<br/>\none (sometimes two if I&#39;m feeling ambitious), I may try switching targets to the MOB that everyone&#39;s<br/>\nattacking in between mezzes.  Try not to face the MOBs you mezzed, you&#39;ll hit them!  Three or more extra<br/>\nMOBs, I just mez, one or two, I usually mez and twist in a few songs.  The top-down view I find is by far<br/>\nthe best way to handle mez.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of Twilight has an interesting feature that&#39;s sometimes useful and sometimes a big pain in the<br/>\npatootie:  it moves the MOBs.  What&#39;s annoying is that, while it SAYS the MOB stumbles towards you, what<br/>\nit actually does is move the MOB on a line from where you&#39;re facing to further behind you.  So if you&#39;ve<br/>\nturned around, you&#39;re actually pushing them away.  Very useful for keeping MOBs from falling off of<br/>\nbattlements or yanking them out of rocks, but be careful when turning around that you don&#39;t push them into<br/>\naggroing other MOBs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a druid and a paladin are fine, although I assume you meant that as the core and not as the whole<br/>\ngroup.  I wouldn&#39;t try just three people in any of those places (except maybe Sebilis zone-in or Karnor&#39;s<br/>\nfront).<br/>\n<br/>\nBest places to practice are the zone-outs.  So moat or front of Karnor&#39;s, zone-out in Sebilis or Chardok.<br/>\nIf you mess up, it&#39;s a quick jump out.  (Keep fear memmed just in case, heh.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say you can handle close-to-zone with average 51 in Karnor&#39;s, 53 in Seb or Chardok.  55 in HS, I have<br/>\nno idea where the zone-out is if there is one.  At higher levels you can go in further.  (It also depends<br/>\non how well-camped the areas are, the more heavily camped, the safer.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 56 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Daniel P.

Of course  one thing to consider -<br/>\n&gt; when you have a Shaman you don&#39;t just have healing - you have slow mob...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I WAS four blue bubs away from 53 - but due to an un-rez&#39;d death (long story<br/>\n&gt; involving my own stupidity...) I&#39;m not back to five - so I&#39;m looking forward<br/>\n&gt; to 53.  I&#39;m in a small guild where we have a core group of people around<br/>\n&gt; 47-51.  We do have a 54 cleric but he is either rarely on - or on alternates<br/>\n&gt; not in guild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The core group in addition to me is Four Druids between 46-53; two 49/51<br/>\n&gt; Paladins; and a 49 Ranger.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Two questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Do you all think that a Bard/Druid/Paladin group can handle the &quot;hard&quot;<br/>\n&gt; areas?  What minimum levels should my partners be?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Any advise on where to go &quot;practice&quot; my crowd control skills and the<br/>\n&gt; groups efforts in general without worry about group wipes?  I&#39;m guessing<br/>\n&gt; Chardok zone-out.  On Xegony it&#39;s usually pretty empty and you can hunt at<br/>\n&gt; the zone out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 56 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Daniel P.

Maybe I&#39;ve been unlucky<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the group&#39;s I&#39;ve had; and also - I haven&#39;t got 53 yet - so I&#39;m relying on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Charm or Pixie Strike - but the point I think is still there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         But maybe - I&#39;m just mediocre...
