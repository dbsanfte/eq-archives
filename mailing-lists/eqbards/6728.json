This leads me<br/>\nto speculate that IF it is true that the raider&#39;s cap has been changed to<br/>\nHalfling only, THEN it is likely that there may be 2 versions of it.  All<br/>\nspeculation - but we should verify with info from players who have the cap<br/>\nnow from before the patch and players who obtain it henceforth.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 17, 1999 3:07 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Leatherfoot raider cap quest spoiler request<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you mean that now only a halfling can complete the quest <br/>\n&gt; and get the<br/>\n&gt; reward or is the cap now only wearable by a halfling?
