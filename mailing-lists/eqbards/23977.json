It used to be a pain when /consent = loot,<br/>\ncause you had no option but to drag the person along with you, which<br/>\ninvariably led to him cancelling autofollow when hit by a mob you usually<br/>\noutrun, cancelling autofollow when he fell too far behind, etc ad nauseum.<br/>\nNow that /consent = drag, it takes about 25% of the time and effort it used<br/>\nto.  Pulse locate, selos, autorun.  If I have to maneuver, pulse, selos,<br/>\nautorun...then drag back.  Now the worst part is how fast you gotta hit drag<br/>\nwhen running...it takes no time at all to get out of drag range.  Feel like<br/>\nI&quot;m playing the old arcade &quot;Track and Field&quot;.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse, with my lvl 20 halfling druid, I appear at a circle, and more often<br/>\nthan not, I get 2 or so tells asking if I can port, whether I&#39;m anon or not<br/>\n(usually am).<br/>\n<br/>\nOMG...I rambled again...I&#39;ll shutup for a couple mins.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, btw, it took me way too long to get 1 bubble into 30 yesterday.  I was<br/>\nin a full group in OT, beating up stuff yellow/red to me, constant pulls.  I<br/>\nalways thought hell levels were made out to be worse than they are...now I<br/>\nsee they&#39;re worse than I thought...hehe.
