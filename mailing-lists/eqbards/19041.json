They cast it alot.  It was NOT toned down<br/>\nin the patch (the instance I am talking about occurred yesterday)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Oozes and the casters in the dungeon have all been fixed though.  Oozes<br/>\nused to have a 900dmg DOT and the casters were casting 50th level spells<br/>\n(they&#39;ve been reduced down to the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s that they should be at)<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall Dalnir is a total bore.  (90% of it is green at 40th).  The boss mob<br/>\nand his PH are absolute hell (though 40+ casters with pets can take him<br/>\npretty easily).  A really good group with a full cleric might be able to do<br/>\nit too.  An enchanter is a must unless you&#39;re just going to pet/root/nuke<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Randy Keith&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kalekona@...\">Kalekona@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 27, 2000 12:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Dalnir: any bard toys?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Well, they did patch saying that Dalnir mobs were casting spells WELL<br/>\nabove thier ability.
