Just FYI, he *was* 23rd once...<br/>\n&gt; His current equipment:<br/>\n&gt; All armour is bronze except for:<br/>\n&gt; Blackened Iron Crown, Bracer of Erollisi, Purity Belt, Banded Sleeves, 2 <br/>\n&gt; strength rings, 2 strength earrings, Grotesque Mask, so AC and STR aren&#39;t a <br/>\n&gt; problem.  He&#39;s actually not overloaded, either, so that&#39;s no big deal.<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s also got a combine Longsword and a Dragoon Dirk for combat, and no <br/>\n&gt; magical instruments, though he does carry one each of the normal ones.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s got two &quot;sets&quot; for songs for combat:<br/>\n&gt; Set 1: Outdoors/open areas (Instruments only)<br/>\n&gt; A) Chords of Dissonance<br/>\n&gt; B) Hymn of Restoration<br/>\n&gt; C) Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord<br/>\n&gt; D) Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; E) Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>\n&gt; F) Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>\n&gt; G) Guardian Rhythms<br/>\n&gt; H) Elemental Rhythms<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Set 2: Indoors/tight quarters (combat bard)<br/>\n&gt; A) Anthem de Arms<br/>\n&gt; B) Hymn of Restoration<br/>\n&gt; C) Jaxon&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor<br/>\n&gt; D) Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; E) *varies*<br/>\n&gt; F) Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>\n&gt; G) Guardian Rhythms<br/>\n&gt; H) Elemental Rhythms<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, last night I logged on, I was on Faydwer, and didn&#39;t want to leave the <br/>\n&gt; continent (not having a whole bunch of time to get a bind somewhere else), <br/>\n&gt; so I went to Unrest.  Found a group in no time (hurrah for bards), group <br/>\n&gt; was 1 Necro, 1 Cleric, 1 Ranger a Warrior (I think) and me.  No problem - <br/>\n&gt; the Warrior, the Ranger and the Necro&#39;s pet can tank, while the Cleric and <br/>\n&gt; I support.  The Warrior was pulling.<br/>\n&gt; The Warrior died on the first pull (trained/rooted), the Necro decided to <br/>\n&gt; leave.  The Ranger got an XP res.  We filled in the missing spots, while <br/>\n&gt; waiting for the Warrior to return, with another Necro and a Wizard.  This <br/>\n&gt; time, (since they seemed to think I can&#39;t get rooted) I was assigned to <br/>\n&gt; pull duty.  I&#39;m not very familiar with the area, so after scouting the <br/>\n&gt; whole ground floor (emtpy), I hear about the two new members and zoom back <br/>\n&gt; to check them out.  When I get back, the Warrior appears and starts looting <br/>\n&gt; his corpse.  Suddenly, we get an &quot;Inc RED&quot; from the Ranger.  He dies.  Um - <br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t I pulling?  Anyway, naturally, we had to wait for the Ranger, so <br/>\n&gt; while we were waiting, I scouted again, this time up to the second <br/>\n&gt; floor.  &quot;Hey, guys, what&#39;s a &quot;Khrix Fitchoff&quot; &quot;BAD BAD BAD!!! Don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; touch!  That&#39;s what killed the Ranger!&quot;  &quot;Um - okay - he&#39;s not bothering <br/>\n&gt; me.&quot;  I guess Necro&#39;s don&#39;t mind Bards.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, we decided to camp the ghoul magi room.  We all get there (except <br/>\n&gt; the Ranger, who is still on his way back), and all of a sudden &quot;A Skeletal <br/>\n&gt; Monk hits you for 75.  A Skeletal Monk hits you for 49.&quot;  I looked around, <br/>\n&gt; no monk.  I ran to the other side of the room - how nice, a ghoul.  We <br/>\n&gt; start smacking it down (I&#39;m just healing at this point) and the ghoul gets <br/>\n&gt; out of the room - no one can seem to get a snare or root to stick.  Oh, how <br/>\n&gt; nice, just outside the room are two MORE ghouls, and a werebat.  And <br/>\n&gt; EVERYTHING is beating on the poor Bard.  FLEE. DIE.<br/>\n&gt; Okay, I get back, and first thing I hear is &quot;Don&#39;t run, next time.&quot;  Gee, <br/>\n&gt; thanks.  Run back to Unrest, find my corpse, loot and get back into Magi <br/>\n&gt; Room.  Ranger starts to come for his bodies (yes, two - his first time <br/>\n&gt; back, Khrix killed him) and Khrix goes aggro on him AGAIN.  For some <br/>\n&gt; reason, Khrix REALLY hates the Ranger, so we decide to go outside.<br/>\n&gt; On the wall, the usual bard hate summons us a Skeletal Monk and Undead <br/>\n&gt; Knight - no pull necessary.  I was just standing there, and blammo - there <br/>\n&gt; they were.  As we&#39;re beating on them, a wave of lag hits the zone, <br/>\n&gt; disconnecting our party one by one.  I jumped in to take the monk off of <br/>\n&gt; the Ranger (the only one left tanking at this point) and he manages to <br/>\n&gt; finish off the Knight by himself, while I get the monk down to half (not <br/>\n&gt; bad for a Bard, actually).  He and I play ping pong with the monk, but he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; too chicken to solo the monk the rest of the way (we&#39;re both at two <br/>\n&gt; bubbles) so he backs off to let the monk beat on me while he heals <br/>\n&gt; himself.  Naturally, I died.<br/>\n&gt; Come back, lost the Warrior, everyone else is disconnected.  Wizard decides <br/>\n&gt; to leave.  Go collect my corpse, and the cleric starts reassembling a party <br/>\n&gt; from what&#39;s left in the zone - a lot of people got disco&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; apparently.  Nice lag-storm.  At least I was the only one in the party who <br/>\n&gt; died.<br/>\n&gt; We juggle 3 or 4 people who decide to leave immediately for other <br/>\n&gt; groups.  Oh well.  I&#39;m very disappointed and frustrated - no <br/>\n&gt; positive  experience yet, and not even a chance to loot a bracelet.  We <br/>\n&gt; finally flesh out the party with a Druid and a Shaman (who decides <br/>\n&gt; shrinking is cool).  So the 6 of us tiny people go take the round room by <br/>\n&gt; the back door, since it&#39;s not camped.  I can&#39;t seem to find anything to <br/>\n&gt; pull, so the Ranger gets sow&#39;d and pulls a nice bunch of ghouls, DBS&#39;s and <br/>\n&gt; a Werebat.  Amazingly, we survive (I was only healing so that was the only <br/>\n&gt; song I was using).  Next pull, I fire up my combat songs - DOH!  Wrong <br/>\n&gt; songs!  &quot;A Ghoul Magi&#39;s Pet winces,  A Ghoul Magi Winces, A Carrion Ghoul <br/>\n&gt; Winces, A Carrion Ghoul Winces&quot;  RUN!!!!!  ZONE!!!!  Safely zoned.  Come <br/>\n&gt; back, apologize, we try one more time.  This time, we collect a train.  I <br/>\n&gt; die first, so does the necro, party disintegrates.  My corpse is still in <br/>\n&gt; the house, and there&#39;s no one willing to help.  Fortunately, it&#39;s just <br/>\n&gt; inside the back door, so I go, corpse it out to the back wall.  As I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; bending down to pick up my stuff, &quot;A Carrion Ghoul hits you for 30! A <br/>\n&gt; Carrion Ghoul begins to cast a spell! You are Stunned. You are Rooted!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Everytime I tried to run, I clicked on my corpse again and opened it up, <br/>\n&gt; and couldn&#39;t seem to get my view reset.  My girlfriend left the room at <br/>\n&gt; this point, sick of the invectives I was throwing at the screen.  So, I <br/>\n&gt; die, two feet from my other corpse.<br/>\n&gt; All told, 4 deaths, so I head back to BB and camp - time to go play a <br/>\n&gt; character who can actually gain experience.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So - there you have it.  Any suggestions before  I delete him?  I think if <br/>\n&gt; I can just get to 23rd, things will be much easier, with chains...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talies the frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
