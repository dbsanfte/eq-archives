Sorry this is so long, but there are a lot of bugs. <br/>\n<br/>\n(his answer)<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize but it is taking a bit longer than I&#39;d hoped to look into these issues. As some will notice, at least one issue has been resolved with another being considered publicly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll get back with you soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust one note, has anyone tried the two psalms mentioned recently? Just a few weeks ago a bug was corrected that was causing secondary effects on bard songs to fail. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Gordon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
