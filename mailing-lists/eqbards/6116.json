Of course on my other char I started killing treeants from<br/>\n21-30. Through all those levels but level 30 I gained exp the same amount.<br/>\nUsually a level a day if I put in a good amount of time. However 30 did take<br/>\n3 days at the treeants so it was quite obvious 30 was a hell level.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me it doesn&#39;t get any better currently my other char ( a necro ) hit<br/>\n35 about 3 weeks ago. For some reason I chose that level to die over and<br/>\nover. Everytime I got within two bubbles of leveling I would go and die two<br/>\ntimes in a row. In fact overall I probably died at least 12 times :(.<br/>\nLuckily I usually got a res. Still it&#39;s a pain to get through but the<br/>\nsatisfaction is good when you finish the level.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: CYR, Thierry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, September 07, 1999 9:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] level hell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;CYR, Thierry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcyr@...\">tcyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If it makes you feel any better i&#39;ve died 3 times in lev 30 and have been<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;it for over 3 weeks now, going on my 4th week.

I dinna want it to be so.  THough I think it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; noticable in Unrest since the mobs are mostly blue to me now.  Perhaps 25<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is one of those inbetween levels where most things are green or even =(.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Time to check Mistmoore then.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; At 31 you lose about a bubble per death (vs. about 1/4-1/3 at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 30 and 32).  If you tend to have a high number of deaths per<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; level as I know many of you do, this can really screw you up.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Whereas before you were taking 5 steps forward and 2 steps<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; back for a net gain of 3 steps a night, at 31 this can turn<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; into 5 steps forward and 6 steps back for a net loss of 1 step<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a night, even though you are gaining experience and dying at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the exact same rate as before.  I hear this holds true for all<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hell-levels + 1.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ack, now I am getting depressed my friend.
