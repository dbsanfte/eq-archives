The few replies<br/>\nit generated were all positive.  Let me know what you think and maybe it is<br/>\nsomething else we can post on the official EQ message board.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to see a new /who command added to the game.  The command would<br/>\nwork like this.  You type in /who &quot;zone name&quot; and it tells you who all is in<br/>\nthat zone.  As it stands right now, you can only find out who is in the zone<br/>\nyou are currently in.  This command would be a tremendous benefit to every<br/>\nplayer in the game, especially those without teleport and gate capabilities.<br/>\nHere is a prime example of its usefulness.  You log in to play and are in<br/>\nHighpass.  Not much action there so you decide you want to go to either<br/>\nCazic Thule or Permafrost.  Getting to Cazic requires you to cross six<br/>\nzones.  Getting to Perma requires you to also cross six zones.  If you are a<br/>\nclass that has to run the entire distance, lets assume its gonna take you<br/>\nabout 30 minutes to get to either place.  You decide to go to Permafrost but<br/>\nwhen you arrive there isn&#39;t anyone in their for you to group with.  You just<br/>\nwasted at least an hour of playing time (30 minutes to get there plus the<br/>\ntime to now run to Cazic).  Time spent needlessly running is not fun, no<br/>\nmatter which class you play.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA /who command that allowed you to see the zone population of zones outside<br/>\nthe zone you are presently in would prevent a situation like this occuring.<br/>\nWhile still in Highpass, you type in /who permafrost.  You could then send<br/>\n/tell messages to someone in the zone near your level to see if you can join<br/>\ntheir group.  If you don&#39;t have luck with Permanfrost, you can then type in<br/>\n/who cazic and try there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of any way this would affect any class balance issue.<br/>\nAssuming that class balance is not affected in any manner by adding this<br/>\n/who command, the only reason I can think of to not implement it is that it<br/>\nis too hard to code.  <br/>\n<br/>\nComments?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
