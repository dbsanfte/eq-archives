Second, they cost mana.  Third, they<br/>\ncost time.  Sometimes you group 3 with 2, but if you do, make sure you<br/>\nrealize how much mana all these buffs really cost.  A cleric casting<br/>\nguard and valor and symbol on 6 people is going to be spending a LOT<br/>\nof time just rebuffing people.  This is going to make the going <br/>\nreally slow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe scenario you list here, has 2 problems before you can think that<br/>\na symbol would help.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Shouldn&#39;t be pulling when the room spawns.  That&#39;s just bad<br/>\nplaying.  Rooms spawn at set times, which can easily be figured out.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Evac&#39;er shouldn&#39;t die like this, even if it means they preform<br/>\na little less optimally than they can.  Instead of having the cleric<br/>\nfull buff everyone in the party and make sure everyone is fully,<br/>\nhealed before any pull, just let the evac&#39;er sit back<br/>\nand ride it easy, using mana safely, never draw the attention of monsters,<br/>\nalways ready to evac.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll probably see better experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, yes everyone should be fully buffed when you go take something<br/>\ndangerous.   But rarely are you trying to get xp and do something<br/>\ndangerous at the same time :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;ok, inc&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;crap you pulled 2&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;damn 3!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;room spawn!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;evac! evac!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;cant - onikage just died!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;LOC!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree with the last thing you said 100% - everyone should get the best<br/>\n&gt; buffs available.

BAH!<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; This reminds me of some clerics who say &quot;...only the tanks<br/>\n&gt; get symbol<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; buffs...&quot; Now what kinda logic is that?  Your casters have<br/>\n&gt; the lowest<br/>\n&gt; \t\thp/ac<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; and so who do you decide to help first?  The ones with the<br/>\n&gt; most hp/ac???<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; Pretty dumb is you ask me<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tNo, not dumb at all.  Casters are the last ones who should<br/>\n&gt; get HP buffs.<br/>\n&gt; \t\tCasters should do their best to avoid taking damage.

The cost is 5gp up to 12pp for the<br/>\n&gt; higher level<br/>\n&gt; \t\tbuffs.  Buffing casters, who shouldn&#39;t be taking damage, is<br/>\n&gt; a serious drain<br/>\n&gt; \t\ton a Cleric&#39;s resources.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tAt higher levels with Complete Heal, having a Symbol on a<br/>\n&gt; tank is even more<br/>\n&gt; \t\teffective.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tThe only thing dumb is saying always/never.  If you are<br/>\n&gt; trying to break a<br/>\n&gt; \t\tspawn, or going through a dangerous area, then giving all<br/>\n&gt; members a Symbol<br/>\n&gt; \t\tis a good idea.
