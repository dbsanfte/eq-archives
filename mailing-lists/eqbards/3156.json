I&#39;ve<br/>\nused both, and I defintely prefer the whip. Why? The whip usually sells<br/>\nfor 100pp compared to the PGT which sells for around 200pp. Big help<br/>\nthere. You say you can afford the PGT, and you want that cool berserk<br/>\neffect though? That effect is useless. When you first get it in your<br/>\nhigh teens its somewhat helpful, but when you move into your mid-20s its<br/>\nuseless and a detriment sometimes. Right now I gain 20 str, and lose 12<br/>\nagi(as I grow in levels I see to lose more agi; I originally lost only 8<br/>\nagi). That 12 agi loss is a BIG thing, and that magic skin you get maybe<br/>\nlasts you a round or two in battle. Stuff that I hunt at 25 can easily<br/>\nhit for over 100hp if it gets a good hit off(alligators in cazic fo<br/>\nexample), and the whole proc is gone 5 secs after it went into effect.<br/>\nSure it may have saved me from damage, but I could&#39;ve avoided that hit<br/>\nwithout the agi loss. Get the barbed whip, its better in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalonus DuPrey<br/>\nTraveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am in need of a new weapon to replace my aging combine longsword and 2 choices<br/>\n&gt; that come to mind are a Barbed Whip or a Polished Granite Tomahawk. Both of<br/>\n&gt; these weapons have plusses and minusses and I was wondering if anyone here had<br/>\n&gt; an opinion of which, if either, is better and why. Or if you know of any other<br/>\n&gt; weapons that can be bought (I hate camping) for around 100-200pp feel free to<br/>\n&gt; expound on their virtues as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Taelin, Songweavers of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S. A piercing weapon would work too. I already use a Dragoon Dirk as my<br/>\n&gt; secondary weapon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Congratulations <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KNICKS@...\">KNICKS@...</a>.
