I got a reply from one of the most well known players<br/>\non E&#39;ci.  He verified that sharksin drums are a legitimate item.  He has the<br/>\nrespect of a lot of people so I&#39;m inclined to trust whatever he says.  So if<br/>\nany of you high level bards want to get a Sharkskin Drum there is a spoiler<br/>\nbelow on how to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler space<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re in Estrellas main room, facing her spawn with the mermaid room to<br/>\nthe right and the left of you...Turn left and go into that room, on your<br/>\nright, slightly elevated, is a little &quot;hole in the wall&quot;. Go in there. Now<br/>\nto your left is a tube going UP. You need to go up this tube. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the top of the tube when you start going forward is a dangerous room for<br/>\nan unprepared party. You&#39;ll be facing an open hallway of sorts that leads<br/>\ninto a big round room which has a big block in the middle of it, and a<br/>\ncathedral ceiling. At the top of that room..the VERY top, is Undertow. <br/>\n<br/>\nBE CAREFUL. When you get to the top of the tube and start going forward<br/>\nagain STOP. The room you are about to enter has a trap in it. Immediately<br/>\nupon entering the room go LEFT and hide back in the corner. If you&#39;re lucky,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll only aggro 1 or 2 piranahs. (refer to my ascii drawing below). Pull<br/>\nthe rest of the fish in the ceiling, and then on the other side of the room<br/>\n(if you were to take a right from the tube) is a mermaid placeholder. The<br/>\nrare spawn of this carries the drum.<br/>\n....__<br/>\n.../.U.&#92;<br/>\n...&#92;...../<br/>\n__| |___<br/>\n|.............|<br/>\n|.............|<br/>\n|.............|<br/>\n|X_|-|D_|==(caves here with another spawn. can&#39;t draw it in ascii =)<br/>\n......^<br/>\n......|| <br/>\n<br/>\nThe arrow at the bottom is pointing to where you enter the room. The X is<br/>\nwhere you should camp from, the D is where the mermaid with the drum is, and<br/>\nthe U is the room where undertow is at the top. Be wary when pulling this<br/>\nroom...2 high level seahorses patrol the bottom. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of spoiler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGot my SharkSkin Drums tonight.  Many thanks to the Twelve Year Guild on<br/>\nCazic-Thule.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe SharkSkin Drums are found on a named Mermaid called Coralyn Kelpma. She<br/>\nspawns past Estrella, just to the right of the 5 StingTooths in the Ceiling<br/>\nand right outside of the Seahorse Caves. A normal Gloomwater is her<br/>\nplaceholder. We came upon her by accident as she spawned 20 min after we<br/>\nkilled her placeholder. I had never heard of her before. Now I wonder what<br/>\nher rare loot is. Grin. She looks like she is equipped with a lute when she<br/>\nhas these.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
