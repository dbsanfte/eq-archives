I was just thinking it might be neat to have a +/-<br/>\nrating for EQ characters, kinda like they have for hockey.  <br/>\nFor those that don&#39;t follow the sport, your +/- rating in<br/>\nhockey is the number of goals your team scored while you were<br/>\non the ice, minus the number of goals the other team scored<br/>\nwhile you were on the ice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you could inspect a player and see the number of<br/>\nexperience-giving monsters killed while grouped, divided by<br/>\nnumber of group members who&#39;ve died while grouped.  i.e. avg<br/>\nnumber of monsters killed per death incurred.  So if a cleric<br/>\nhad a tendency to let group members die, you could avoid him<br/>\nwithout having to experience several deaths for yourself.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNutty idea, doesn&#39;t fit into roleplaying, but fun to think<br/>\nabout.  Though a number like this would focus attention away<br/>\nfrom self-improvement (or self-preservation as the case may<br/>\nbe), and more towards group cooperation.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
