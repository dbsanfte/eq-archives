The<br/>\n&gt; question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>\n&gt; abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>\n&gt; had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>\n&gt; (Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>\n&gt; would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>\n&gt; a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maev Lorekeeper<br/>\n&gt; Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s part of the reason I don&#39;t play on Tarrew Marr anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhayde t&#39;Blaak.<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Maev.
