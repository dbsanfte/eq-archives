But the paladin gets to heal and loh which allows him<br/>\nto go after &#39;&#39;bigger&#39;&#39; targets with less downtime.  i personally think the sub 40 game<br/>\nis now very unbalanced towards hybrids, but maybe now that the game is &#39;&#39;mature&#39;&#39;<br/>\nand such a large portion of the player base is post 40, it just doesn&#39;t matter.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
