Fully aware that as your stats go up,<br/>\nyou reach a point of diminishing returns.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW my Agility was 99 when I hit myself with the 51 song.  Agility dropped<br/>\nto 54.  Total AC loss was either 60 or 65 (16 from the song and the rest due<br/>\nto Agility loss).  Based on your previous reply, going below 75 Agility is a<br/>\nmajor penalty to AC.  A mob would have to have an Agility score of 120+ in<br/>\norder to avoid going below 75 when hit with the 51 song.  So the question<br/>\nthen is what kind of Agility score do typical 45+ mobs have?  If the typical<br/>\n45+ mob has less than 120 Agility, then the 51 song could have a major<br/>\nimpact on increasing the amount of melee damage your party does (assuming<br/>\nthe loss of 50-60 pts of AC is significant).  If the typical 45+ mob has<br/>\nmore than 120 Agility, then obviously this song won&#39;t decrease their AC by<br/>\n50-60 pts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext question.  Lets assume you have a snarer and slower in your group and<br/>\nas a result don&#39;t need this song for those purposes.  Lets also assume the<br/>\nsong debuffs the mob&#39;s AC by 50-60 pts.  Would it be better to use this song<br/>\nstrictly for the AC debuff or instead add in a chant for the extra damage?<br/>\nFor the AC debuff to outweigh the extra damage from a chant, the AC debuff<br/>\nwould have to account for around 150 extra melee damage done to the mob over<br/>\nthree ticks.  Over three ticks, would it be safe to assume that the tanks<br/>\nwill get in 3-4 extra hits due to the AC debuff and as a result do well over<br/>\n150 damage?  If so, think this song will become a permanent fixture to my<br/>\nplaylist for a while.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 06, 2001 11:56 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Largos Absonant Binding (lvl 51)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that 30 agl only added 3 AC is pointless.
