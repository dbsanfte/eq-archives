We were pulling stuff near a zone<br/>\nboundary (Burning Wood I believe),<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyway - the strategy we were using was - the Enchanter would cast<br/>\nImmobilize - sick the pets on them And Dot and DD away.  I joined up with<br/>\nthem and equipped my MM Battle Drum and Chanted and Bellowed away.<br/>\n<br/>\n    They noticed that after I came - the Mobs Root Broke much more often.<br/>\nWe experimented with &quot;Just Singing Mana&quot; and then very selectively singing<br/>\nthe songs - and had trouble coming to conclusion as to what caused it to<br/>\nbreak root.  (I&#39;m using the term root generically - again we were actually<br/>\nusing the Enchanter Immobilize spell).<br/>\n<br/>\n    The only theory that we came up with that seemed to make sense was that<br/>\nany time a spell hit there was a chance it would break.  Since the bard DOTs<br/>\nduration are so much shorter than the Druid&#39;s and Enchanter&#39;s - I would have<br/>\nto guess that is why it broke much more often after I arrived.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyone have any insight on this?  If this is true it adds an interesting<br/>\nwrinkle to the balance issue (i.e. Verant considering Bards more &quot;powerful&quot;<br/>\nin many regards due to we don&#39;t need mana.  A side-effect of &quot;casting&quot; makes<br/>\nthe short duration of our songs much less &quot;powerful&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\n    Also - using this strategy - I wasn&#39;t sure what the best third song was<br/>\nto the two chants - settled on the 21 hp&#39;s I get from Bellows - any opinions<br/>\non this as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n40th Level - Xegony Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
