Last weekend her call to purchase a Dirk in Crushbone was<br/>\n&gt; finally answered, and last night she earned the right to scribe the<br/>\n&gt; 12th song.  She&#39;s currently calling E. Freeport home, and she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; finding the adventures there entertaining, but she has suddenly found<br/>\n&gt; herself without any burning immediate goals.
