There are a large group of us that have leveled fairly slowly,<br/>\nbut enjoyed every minute of it.  We roleplay quite a bit and even our<br/>\nEQVault board is fun to join in on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a character on the Rodcet Nife server that I created when<br/>\nit first came up.  Several of my RL friends were scattered on other<br/>\nservers and we decided to start fresh characters on RN so we could get<br/>\ntogether.  That server has also been quite fun, though I suppose I feel<br/>\na little more loyal to Bristlebane.  I&#39;ve noticed ALOT of former old<br/>\ntimers from Fennin Ro, etc have moved to Rodcet Nife for the very<br/>\nreason you spoke of... they&#39;ve done the powergame thing and they want a<br/>\nchange.  Almost like retiring to Florida.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I would highly recommend either board if you&#39;re looking for a<br/>\ngood environment.  Are they Doodz-free? no, but then again none of the<br/>\nboards really are.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck in your choice in finding a starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jantis<br/>\nCompany of the Silver Star<br/>\nBristlebane Server<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
