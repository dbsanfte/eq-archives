However, Togors is much more efficent <br/>\nManawise.  Sure you can chain stun a mob into submission, but at a <br/>\nstaggering mana cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur slowdowns do not affect casting time in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, a lot of fights are counted in seconds at lower levels.  However when <br/>\nyou start fighting mobs that double attack for 120 and have 8,000 hit points, <br/>\nslowdowns are increasingly nessecary.  A Mob with Togors is like hitting <br/>\nthem with a continuous six second stun for 175 mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not trade Togors for anything.

The faster you can kill a mob, the less important<br/>\n&gt; slowdowns become.  Anyone know if it affects casting rate?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Stuns OTOH are more a means of damage control, rather than<br/>\n&gt; reduction.  That makes them more like heals and rune - they<br/>\n&gt; are still valuable even if it takes only 10 seconds to kill a<br/>\n&gt; mob.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
