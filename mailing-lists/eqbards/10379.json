It worked very<br/>\nwell, even though I don&#39;t have my brass skill maxed quite yet... a few<br/>\nmissed notes, but I just kept on going (my brass is getting there - it&#39;s in<br/>\nthe 70s now, whereas on Sunday it was only in the 40s or so). Anyway, in<br/>\ngroups or solo, I find that this Medley works very well, as long as you pull<br/>\nthings to someplace semi-secluded. I switch to the bellow when anything<br/>\nstarts to run, as its an easy way to finish it off. Sometimes, when grouped,<br/>\nI have found that the group is so good that I don&#39;t need to use the Heal<br/>\nuntil after we&#39;re done fighting, unless we ended up pulling more than we<br/>\nwanted... say two red&#39;s or more. In the case where we don&#39;t need heal, I use<br/>\none of the strength songs (like Anthem), or I even the L20 song (Largo&#39;s<br/>\nMel. Binding).<br/>\n<br/>\nI must tell you guys that last Sunday nite I got L20 (finally), and, just to<br/>\nsee if I could do it, I decided to go solo some things with the Medley<br/>\n(Cod/DDD/Hymn) and, to my delight and surprise, I got 21 by Friday nite<br/>\nalmost the entire level by myself!!!! (this is exciting as it took me a<br/>\nmonth to go from L19 to 20 partly due to real life interferance, and also<br/>\ndue to the fact that there is a big difference between just finding a group<br/>\nand finding a GOOD group.... AND when I tried to solo before, I could find<br/>\nnothing experience giving that wouldn&#39;t kill me - even if it was blue).<br/>\nAnyway, it is really a powerful song combo, and the first two can be<br/>\nsuccessfully weaved with Hymn or other songs to help your group or your solo<br/>\ncareer immensely!! (my husband can attest to how excited I was at being able<br/>\nto solo things with the combo, too - I kept raving while playing how easy it<br/>\nwas, once I learned how to do it).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; instruments saying, &quot;That is VERY different way to fight, my friend!  Your<br/>\n&gt; singing must be extremely bad to hurt so many, so much!...grin&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah - it is fun, huh!<br/>\n<br/>\n===== Brangwen Incantare, Bard of the 21st song ======<br/>\n============================================</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
