The higher level song apparently takes over, which was<br/>\na good thing in this case, otherwise she&#39;d still be waiting for me. I left<br/>\nmine on to test, and when we got out of range, I got the message &quot;You Slow<br/>\nDown&quot;. And indeed I did slow down to normal running speed, no boot icon<br/>\ndisplayed, even though I was still singing my Selo&#39;s. We were out of range<br/>\nfor several seconds one time and my Selo&#39;s never kicked in. Now, if I was<br/>\nplaying something else and switched to Selo&#39;s it would activate if I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nin her range. So my conclusion is that the weaker song is cancelled until<br/>\nthe next time it is started outside the stronger singer&#39;s range. If it is<br/>\ntrue, I suspect that other Bard songs probably don&#39;t stack, either, like the<br/>\nheal song. Anyone else test this?<br/>\n<br/>\nOperaman<br/>\nMeandering Maestro<br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. The best experience was gliding up the Highpass ramp in E Karanas, me<br/>\nplaying Selo&#39;s, Sylly levitating us with Aria. Nice to have a taste of the<br/>\nfuture, if only for a little while. Thanks, Sylly!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
