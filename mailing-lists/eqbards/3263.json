Hola everyone!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;m currently a drunken bard on Rodcet Nife and\r<br/>\nhave obtained lvl 42.  Anxiously, awaiting lvl 43\r<br/>\ndamage song even though it is currently semi-bugged, but tis exciting none the less.  Why may I ask is it exciting?  Well, for most of my career in barding, I have felt well rounded with a plethora (Pepe, how many is in a plethora?)of tricks to boot.  But after the level 32 mana song craze, things have just trickled off.  I don&#39;t know if it was that they hadn&#39;t intended the levels to be obtained that high so quickly or they just decided to let high level bards sift into mediocrity.  I assume the prior for they are trying to scoot some new songs in now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTake for example, the level 42 song: Berserk Cresendo.  Great song, 17 str and a extra 5% attack speed from the Celerity song...  but it won&#39;t stack with anything!  I went back to the celerity/anthem stack because three stats boosted (str/agi/dex) and still 20% increase in attack; it far outways the Berserker song.  So yes, another high level song that is up to par with another anti-disease song.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHehe, bellows are doing 22 a pop.  Tuyen&#39;s got boosted, but is resisted so often it is more efficent to just continue bellowing.  More often though, I just run straight buff songs with Mystic Shielding cause 22dmg a pop is just enough to cause a creature to have dandruff.  So, the lvl 43 song needs to be the one that finally balances us out in the high levels again.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNow, I was at a loss recently to find things to solo while my crew isn&#39;t on.  Still not soloing much, but I did find a fun way for two bards (or a bard and a &#39;snare&#39; casting profession) to beat the crap out of a single critter they couldn&#39;t do head on.  The first bard plays a stack of chains/bellows.  Slows the creature down just as fine as snare spell.  The second bard sneaks up and turns on fear song.  The creature inches away trying to flee, while you pummel it to death, all the time keeping it locked down with chains.  We&#39;ve killed high level 30&#39;s without ever being hit once.  And it&#39;s not that boring kite stuff either, it&#39;s much more pleasant to do. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo that&#39;s my ranting and tips for the day.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMarchandt D&#39;lere\r<br/>\nDrunken Bard of Freeport\r<br/>\nGuildmaster: Legion of Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
