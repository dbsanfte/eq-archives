They<br/>\nget rogue skills along with a mix of songs from all the casting classes.<br/>\nThey have some enchanter type spells, some druid/shaman type spells, and<br/>\neven some dots which you could throw in under Necros. I&#39;m sorry but because<br/>\nof the huge mix from all the classes bards are obviously a hybrid by this<br/>\ndefinition.

If you<br/>\n&gt;want to call it a priest, then I&#39;d say a priest is<br/>\n&gt;a hybrid. If Clerics, Druids or Shamen aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;hybrids because they&#39;re priests and get their powers<br/>\n&gt;from their dieties, then a Bard isn&#39;t a hybrid either<br/>\n&gt;because their power comes from music. NO other class<br/>\n&gt;does that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You&#39;re claiming that &quot;preists&quot; aren&#39;t hybrids because<br/>\n&gt;of *where* their abilities come from. Thinking along<br/>\n&gt;those lines you simply can not disagree that a Bard<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t be a hybrid because of where HIS abilities<br/>\n&gt;come from like no other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The fact is that they have multiple abilities from<br/>\n&gt;other different classes just like a Bard does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
