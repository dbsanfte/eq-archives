The problems with eta&#39;s are I<br/>\nget flamed if we don&#39;t meet them.<br/>\nMost of you have been paitent and curteous (sp??) and I HATE to disappoint.<br/>\nNo we did not have any converstaions about bards today. I spent 90% of my<br/>\nday going over some new content so it goes in correctly. Now before I get<br/>\nthe &#39;why are you putting in new content before the old stuff is fixed&#39; let<br/>\nme share with you that the people who are putting in new content are NOT the<br/>\nones who are fixing the old stuff (usually).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I get to test all of it. I have a wonderful group of testers who<br/>\nwork VERY hard. This is the project we have been working on for almost two<br/>\nweeks now and there is an end in sight. Next are Bards (not just lulaby) and<br/>\nthen the iksar quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nGordon asked me today about bards. I told him I was overworked and I&#39;ll get<br/>\nto it. Guys please bear with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like a broken record here. I don&#39;t repost because I have nothing new<br/>\nto say. I&#39;m not looking for any &#39;poor ester is overworked&#39; nonsence, it&#39;s my<br/>\njob, I LOVE my job, but I can&#39;t do everything at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ is at my disposal as soon as I have things to bring him. He tells me that<br/>\nevery time he sees me in the hallway.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou guys are not nags. You are not whining (well the ones I actually listen<br/>\nto are not) and I think you have some valid concerns. I have never played a<br/>\nbard so I have a learning curve here and it is going to take a bit for me to<br/>\novercome that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note to a VERY long post, the but with the disapeparing text<br/>\nbuffer (which is one I want fixed!!) are you guys getting it a lot? I am<br/>\ngoing to post it&#39;s own thread, but we are seeing it mostly with bards...<br/>\n/sigh<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease know that I am not ignorning or blowing anyone&#39;s issues off. These<br/>\nthings take more time than I realized.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
