Although I always enjoy this type of<br/>\ndiscussion, I think we will have to wait until the expansion comes out<br/>\nbefore we will know what Verant has in store for the bards and other<br/>\nclasses.  Its too bad that Verant is tight lipped when it comes to<br/>\ndiscussion of class mechanics.  In addition to new songs, I am hoping that<br/>\nwe will get new skills like parry and riposte (with caps high enough to be<br/>\nuseful) at some point after 50th level.  If the only thing we get are raises<br/>\nto the caps of our current skills, then I for one will be quite<br/>\ndisappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how useful it would be, but maybe the bard community (mailing<br/>\nlist and Concert Hall board) should bang heads together and come up with a<br/>\nlist of song ideas and skills that we would like to see get added with the<br/>\nexpansion.  The way I interpreted GZ&#39;s response to our questions, Verant<br/>\nseems to be having a hard time coming up with new song ideas.  Maybe we<br/>\ncould help them out some.  I volunteer John Kim, Shada and Rokenn to take<br/>\nthe lead on this:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nSnipped the original post in kindness to the digest subscribers</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
