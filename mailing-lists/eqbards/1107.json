This<br/>\n&gt;particular staff is a 1 handed blunt weapon and can be equipped by<br/>\n&gt;Necromancers, Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians and Bards. It has a damage of<br/>\n&gt;9, a delay of 33 and has the effect of chaotic feedback(which does 48<br/>\n&gt;points of damage when successful).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t been impressed with most weapons I have seen so far, but this<br/>\n&gt;sounds like a real treat. Any idea where to find one?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would be willing to train my 1H Blunt to use this, since it has a very<br/>\n&gt;nice magical effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Working on using EQLizer for some complete weapon analysis, will post soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Musil<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ever since I went through all the trouble to get myself a Screaming Mace, <br/>\nand then finding out it screws up bard songs I&#39;ve decided to stay away from <br/>\nweapons that have an added magical effect (even though ppl are saying there <br/>\nis a way around it).<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t mind getting a crystalline sword though =)<br/>\nAnyone?
