It just seems that when I see people running from <br/>\n&gt; a dragon, they are in the bardless groups.  Of course I don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; what their resists were at.  But that isn&#39;t important.  What I really <br/>\n&gt; want to know is how extensively has anyone tested this?  Or is this <br/>\n&gt; soft cap stuff all just hearsay from a friend of a friend that works <br/>\n&gt; for Verant?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But you know, I don&#39;t think that this is a real threat anyway since <br/>\n&gt; we are the ones that will push everyone over 175.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Beatdrop<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In eqbards@y..., Jeffrey Sue &lt;jsue@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the point was not that you would be feared or ae damaged or <br/>\n&gt; whatever.  the point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was that you would get the same effectivity at about 175 as at <br/>\n&gt; about 245.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the way to test this is to have someone get to about 176 in resists <br/>\n&gt; and compare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; effectivity with someone at 245 in resists.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 06:50 PM 2/22/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Sorry Sylly, my question was mainly for the group.
