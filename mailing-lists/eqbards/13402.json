I was<br/>\nfighting Ogre Bouncers inside Oggok last night with my Ykesha and I believe<br/>\nthe number of times it fired over the course of about 4 hours of play was<br/>\neither 2 or 3 - that&#39;s a very serious drop, perhaps an order of magnitude.<br/>\nThe last hour or so I loaded up all of my DEX equipment and played Chant of<br/>\nBattle and had a DEX of 186 and didn&#39;t proc once.  After killing Bouncers I<br/>\nran over to Cazic-Thule and beat on some lizzies and gators for testing<br/>\npurposes (also 186 DEX) and got not a single proc while there (around 20<br/>\nsolo kills).<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
