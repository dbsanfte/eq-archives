I TOTALLY agree about the belt ... on the issue of the spear I<br/>\nwoulnt have minded that either.. My peircing(as well as all applicable wep<br/>\nskills) are maxxed I normally duel wield 2 obsidian shards believe it or<br/>\nnot( no flaming me for it they proc on AVERAGE 5 times PER MOB I have<br/>\nunbuffed dex of almost 160) now its true the one rogue that was there would<br/>\nprobably have put it to better use BUT I would probably have used it if I<br/>\nhad got it.<br/>\nso we did random with those who could use it..<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEN came the belt and I forgot who the casters name was but he yelled since<br/>\nit was an all all that EVERYONE randoms for it.. now THAT is crossing the<br/>\nline.. I would LOVE LOVE LOVED to have that belt..i WOULD use it and I WANT<br/>\na haste sash as I do not have one yet..<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree bard are very deserving of a roll  in the belt.. a caster on the<br/>\nother hand.......

The<br/>\n&gt;question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>\n&gt;abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>\n&gt;had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>\n&gt;(Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>\n&gt;would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>\n&gt;a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maev Lorekeeper<br/>\n&gt;Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
