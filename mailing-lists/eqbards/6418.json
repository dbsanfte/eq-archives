When chained/snared the<br/>\ncreature will still attempt to run even if it&#39;s movement velocity is zero.<br/>\nThis makes fear/root a whole lot less useful for safe kiting of creatures<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\nBard of Kelethin<br/>\nHonour Guard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 13 Sep 1999, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok I am confused, how is this any different from Fear/Root?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I personally believe that chain/fear is a valid tactic, why not?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do not have the occasion to use this combo often as I mostly adventure in<br/>\n&gt; groups but it did save my hide once in Unrest vs. a con Yellow barbed bone<br/>\n&gt; caster and even though I would not have known to try it if I had not learned<br/>\n&gt; it from this list, I was still amazed and ran around telling all my friends<br/>\n&gt; that I solo&#39;d a barbed for days to come.

Its sad when a level 14 npc is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; pounding the hell out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of a 31th level pc. I just decided to not take any chances <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with him.
