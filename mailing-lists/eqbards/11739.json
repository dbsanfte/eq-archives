Moonflower spent 7 hours shuttling back and forth<br/>\nbetween groups holding something called the &quot;Cav&quot; room, the &quot;Sage&quot; room<br/>\nand the &quot;Executioner&quot; room. Here is the bad part. The Assassin was<br/>\nkilled once the entire time. Someone shouted &quot;Mask&quot; and because I was<br/>\nthe only one there that could use it they told me to loot it. So I am<br/>\nstanding over the body going click, click, click when suddenly i get the<br/>\nmessage &quot;Someone is already looting that body&quot; ...POOF !!!  Nobody would<br/>\nown up and all agreed &quot;That was dirty. The Mask was Moon&#39;s&quot;. The<br/>\nAssassin was never seen again and later some one opined &quot;The assassin<br/>\nspawns up the stairs&quot;. Hunh ? ...any ideas because just being in lower<br/>\nGuk gives me sweaty palms :) I died just getting to the rooms when the<br/>\nperson who was leading me in had her invisibility to the dead go down<br/>\nright in the middle of a pack of Greater Ice Bones. When Moon saw that<br/>\nshe calmly walked to the middle of the floor of a tower where she would<br/>\nbe easy to see and knelt down and bowed her head. It took only one round<br/>\nand wasn&#39;t very painful, really :)<br/>\n  This was also my first experience sing my new Clarity song. I finally<br/>\nmet someone I had only read about here ! You know, the guy who tells you<br/>\nwhat to do. He insisted I couldn&#39;t weave Clarity with anything else. I<br/>\nexplained, while I might not be able to weave 3 songs with it I<br/>\ncertainly could 2 and cited this board and John Kim, et al as my<br/>\nauthority. Heheh, all night long I am sill getting group tells &quot;Is that<br/>\na Heal song I see !&quot; ..got so bad I started slipping in Fulfils Chant<br/>\nand Chains below his radar to help the group. They really love their<br/>\nClarity song don&#39;t they :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Moonflower Bllue, 32nd Bard<br/>\n  Cazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
