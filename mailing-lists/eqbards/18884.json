Most folks get invis to undead after any live froogies have<br/>\nbeen killed at the zone and down the hall going to the waterway.  Then they<br/>\nrun past any undead froogs to get in deeper to where the good toys drop. So,<br/>\nits zone, hall, waterway then bedroom.  At bedroom is both undead and live<br/>\nstuff and 2 halls that go past the vampire bat room.  Most folks wait until<br/>\nthe bedroom campers kill any loose live stuff then get invis to undead and<br/>\nrun down left hall - past bat room then down left hall but HUGGING the right<br/>\nside of it to get past the Greater Ice Bones Skels.  Past that is the bridge<br/>\nto the tower.  On left is a 3 spawn od undead froogs - casters and above<br/>\nsome gargs.  On right is a hall to the live side and the bug rooms and more<br/>\nbasalt gargs.  If you wait in the bedroom until the campers kill all the<br/>\nloose undead stuff, you might be able to invis down the right hall and pass<br/>\nthe bat room and pass the bugs (deadly black widows) and get out to the<br/>\nbridge to the tower.  Either way - it can be real easy if the zone is<br/>\nheavily camped like at a busy time - or very deadly if not over crowded.<br/>\nCross the bridge to the tower and go down the hall past a ladder then make a<br/>\nleft and look for the next ladder.  That 2nd ladder goes up to the<br/>\nassassin/supplier room.  Keep you back to the wall in the assassin room - he<br/>\nback stabs for huge amount.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get invis to undead potions to supplement your invis or go with<br/>\nsomeone who can cast it.  Or go with someone who can revive you and duel him<br/>\nin the zone and have him drag your corpse to the room (and revive you<br/>\nthere.)  Or let your high level friends do the questing - the finished<br/>\nLambent pieces are trade-able. heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mention dark bones - the NK gryfeenes drop the charm needed for the<br/>\nLambent bracers. Have to do that 2 times or do it with a buddy who will<br/>\ncarry the extras stuffs for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Papa Legba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 19, 2000 1:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Some Guk questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I finally dragged Elfson away from Kunark (went from 20-26 in about two<br/>\n&gt; weeks!).  Feeling confident, (25 was the first level I reached without<br/>\n&gt; dying since 5, 26 was the second) I began my search for some lambent<br/>\n&gt; armor.  After some unsuccesful searching, I decided to come here with<br/>\n&gt; some questions...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically with all these peices, I&#39;d like to know is there a specific<br/>\n&gt; mob (IE the Shin Knight down the hall from the preist room) or will any<br/>\n&gt; mob of that type drop the item I need.  Also any other advice you could<br/>\n&gt; offer for getting them would be great. (like where to find them) (Most<br/>\n&gt; of these peices are out my reach right now, but my guild has lots of mid<br/>\n&gt; 30&#39;s casters dying to get me to 32, so they are very eager to help me<br/>\n&gt; get my lambent, (I assume they want me to get my butt back to ROK for<br/>\n&gt; more levels))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dark Boned Bracelets (Greater DB skelly in Unrest)<br/>\n&gt; Shin Greaves (Shin Knight, upper guk)<br/>\n&gt; Shin Gauntlets (Ghoul Shin Knight, lower guk)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also since I am in Guk, I am trying to get the Mask of the Deceiver.<br/>\n&gt; The person camping it on Saturday was willing to let me loot it, but I<br/>\n&gt; could never find the room.  How do you ge there?  Will I make it with<br/>\n&gt; invisibility?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well thanks for the help :)<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt DeBarger </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
