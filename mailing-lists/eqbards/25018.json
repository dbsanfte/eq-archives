I am not talking class balance issues<br/>\nhere.  If you can think of any quirks, annoying or otherwise, add them in<br/>\nto the list.  Then head to the quality assurance message board (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro\">http://boards.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro</a> ) and let<br/>\nEster know.  If enough people post to her, she may make a statement about<br/>\nit and hopefully fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Many months ago Ester told us that the caster animation that bards make<br/>\nwhen using the chants would be fixed.  Nothing has been done.<br/>\n2) The sound effects on Shield of song is annoying to most people.  Can&#39;t<br/>\nwe get rid of this?<br/>\n3) There is no text message for Shield of Song.<br/>\n4) Though not directly bard related it is a bit.  Around the time of the<br/>\nDX7 patch the off/low/med/high particle effect settings became broken.  Off<br/>\nnow displays what low used to be.  The &quot;new&quot; low is no different from<br/>\nmedium and high.  I bumped a post about this nearly six months ago.  Ester<br/>\nsaid they would look in to it.  Nothing has been done.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
