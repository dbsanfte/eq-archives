I can not use the same songs in the same way as<br/>\n&gt; you.  My sleep song puts EVERYONE but my party to sleep, including other<br/>\n&gt; players, in fact any NON Party song effects mobs and players.  This is a<br/>\n&gt; real disadvantage to me I believe.

I actually happen to miss<br/>\nthis component of combat tactics from Diablo and UO.  You had<br/>\nto think carefully about how you used area effect spells/songs<br/>\nsince you could fry your teammates or passerbys.  Of course it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help that area effect songs don&#39;t have pretty graphics<br/>\nto show you their extent like area effect spells do.  (Then<br/>\nagain, people complain enough already about the lag bards <br/>\ncause. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we could suggest Verant replace one of the &quot;useless&quot;<br/>\nsongs (e.g. Charisma or Identify) with a targeted lullaby<br/>\nwhich only works on a single mob?  I died yesterday because<br/>\nI ran across a newbie (level 5) being beat up by two bandits.  <br/>\nI started my lullaby to make it a fair one-on-one fight, and<br/>\nshortly afterwards a wandering guard killed me.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
