At my last job a bunch of folks knew the first dev team<br/>\nwell and one fellow in particular knew the fellow who wrote the linux<br/>\nclient. As a funny side note, there was a group of big gun network<br/>\nprogrammers in town who thought UO was a great idea and offered to help with<br/>\nthe network code for *free* just to make sure it was done well. The offer<br/>\nwas turned down...and the rest, as they say, is history.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
