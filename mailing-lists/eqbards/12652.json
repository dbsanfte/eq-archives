I now have the honor of being in and having been in 2 of the<br/>\nvery best guilds on Innoruuk.  SotM and TP are incredibly similar in the way<br/>\nthey have developed a real &#39;family&#39; feeling.  There are some really fine<br/>\npeople in both guilds and I am really lucky to know them all.  For those of<br/>\nyou who have not guilded, I strongly recommend that you try it.  And there<br/>\nis no greater feeling in the world (game) than to go into a Dragon Lair with<br/>\nfull confidence in your team. Win or lose - live or die - the feeling of<br/>\nbeing on a great family team is the best.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need an extra bard... hehe let me know!  I&#39;d be glad to tag along for<br/>\nfun!  Silvera is my heroeinne from a long time ago so I got a lot of respect<br/>\nfor you guys!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 40th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. double yak-attack now ;p - costly though - thank the gods for lev 50<br/>\nrezz&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tMiriana [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, January 05, 2000 8:54 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Harmonic&#39;s Distorted view of Dragon Raids (and<br/>\nsome P.S.&#39;s for Sylly)<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I couldn&#39;t resist the pun on your last name Harmonic :P.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

Yeah Sylly, we got both Naggy and Vox yesterday, but both are back.<br/>\nTonight&#39;s plan is Naggy again, and we have an agreement with someone else<br/>\n(I have no clue whom, was worked out by my guild leader) to let them get a<br/>\ncouple of days to try Vox with.  If they fail, we&#39;ll kill Vox this<br/>\nweekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.P.S. The only reason we put pressure on ML and Storm to yield to us<br/>\nwas because one of our members was bound on the pedestal where Vox sits<br/>\nfrom a previous Vox killing and gated back without remembering to rebind.<br/>\nHence, getting him back was a high priority of ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLevel 50 Cleric<br/>\nKalera<br/>\nLevel 35 Bard<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
