Have you now changed your mind on this? If the<br/>\ncheck happens when the secondary weapon delay expires then that<br/>\ncontradicts the first sentance I quoted above.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, with the typical fight, putting a 10 delay weapon in either hand<br/>\nwith a bard at high levels, assuming an under one minute fight, would<br/>\nprobably yeild something like this, assuming all 6 dual weild checks<br/>\nsucceeded (ya right)<br/>\n<br/>\nmiss<br/>\nmiss<br/>\nhit for 1<br/>\nhit for 1<br/>\nhit for 75<br/>\nhit for 25<br/>\nmiss<br/>\nmiss<br/>\nmiss<br/>\nhit for 1<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least that&#39;s how most of my fights looked.
