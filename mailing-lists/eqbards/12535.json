You can imagine how pissed off I was when I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lost exp after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the fight. Why? You ask.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, his pet killed me, causing me to die from a NPC, which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same as dieing via a normal mob. The duel was void and I lost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1/2 bub exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (this was back at level 29 or so, he was 31). So, I must stress, NEVER<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fight a mage in a duel because if you die you can kiss<br/>\n&gt; &gt; goodbye to your exp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (if the pet gets the last hit and kills you).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ========================================================================<br/>\n&gt; To UNSUBSCRIBE from this community, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">eqbards-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; and reply to the confirmation email we send you.<br/>\n&gt; ======================================================================== </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
