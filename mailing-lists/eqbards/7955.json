(Though I have had trouble in<br/>\nRunnyeye).  Been using it in perma with no problems.  The thing you<br/>\ndescribe below I&#39;ve had happen to non-bard characters as well.  It&#39;s like<br/>\nyou&#39;ve killed too many of that type of monster, and they all decide to open<br/>\na can of whoop-ass on you.  Had that happen to me most recently in<br/>\nsteamfont while fighting earth elems.  All of a sudden, I see a whole swarm<br/>\nof them moving toward me (slowly, in that menacing earth elem way), wasn&#39;t<br/>\nsure what was going on until too late.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:28 PM 10/5/99 -1000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I assume you intended to say &quot;reels in pain&quot;, which off the top of my head I<br/>\n&gt;think is the message you get when you bellow.  DDD and CoD gives you the<br/>\n&gt;&quot;wince&quot; message.  You mentioned you were in Highkeep fighting the pickclaws.<br/>\n&gt;Probably don&#39;t need to tell you this, but singing DDD or CoD in the basement<br/>\n&gt;will sometimes, due to the z-axis bug, affect get the guards who are on the<br/>\n&gt;floor above you.  Learned that the hard way last time I was there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The more I think about the z-axis bug, the more I realize that it really<br/>\n&gt;puts a hamper on our effectiveness.  I almost never have DDD or CoD<br/>\n&gt;memorized unless I&#39;m in a wide open area in outdoor zone.  Don&#39;t assume just<br/>\n&gt;because you are outdoors the z-axis bug won&#39;t bite you.  One time I was in<br/>\n&gt;the Beholder Maze fighting evil eyes and minos.  My group was camping along<br/>\n&gt;the wall in the gorge where the Lord evil eyes appear.  I sang DDD in every<br/>\n&gt;fight.  We were having a great time when all of a sudden just about every<br/>\n&gt;muddite and mino in the entire zone came rushing into the gorge. Everyone of<br/>\n&gt;them starting attacking me so I can only assume that one of them got<br/>\n&gt;affected by DDD through the mountain walls and started up a train.  If<br/>\n&gt;Verant can&#39;t/won&#39;t fix the z-axis bug, I would likely welcome a nerf<br/>\n&gt;reducing the radius of DDD and CoD so we could use it more often.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; A Goblin Warrior winces!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; A Goblin Warrior is hit for 15 damage non-melee<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Faras &quot;harp-music playing in the background&quot; Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Steven S.
