Up until last night, I<br/>\n&gt; would get a message...&quot;You have been cured of your affliction&quot; or something<br/>\n&gt; like that each time my song successfully pulsed against poison or disease,<br/>\n&gt; and after a few successful pulses the poison or disease would drop on group<br/>\n&gt; member Soandso.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well last night I never saw that message, and no group member ever was cured<br/>\n&gt; by my song.  I am just wondering if you guys have noticed the same thing?<br/>\n&gt; If any of you are in a position to quantitively test this over the weekend,<br/>\n&gt; please do so so we can get a bug report submitted ASAP if it is in fact<br/>\n&gt; broken.
