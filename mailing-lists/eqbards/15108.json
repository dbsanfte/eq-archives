And, wisdom definately seems to<br/>\nmake a difference with it improving. The easiest way I&#39;ve found to deal<br/>\nwith sense heading is to not waste time on it until you can dump 20 odd<br/>\npoints into it. That usually means around L5 or 6. Then start mashing it<br/>\nwhile medding or resting. At least with wisdom casters like my druid and<br/>\ncleric, this method seems much less painful than I remember it was for<br/>\nmy bard. IIRC, with my bard I used to fish and practice sense heading.<br/>\nIt went up a lot slower and the fishing wasn&#39;t worth the time spent on<br/>\nit, unlike in beta when not only could fishing be slightly profitable<br/>\nbut you also had a cool social scene around the docks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Feb 18/00, Naeeldar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Atually I&#39;ll probably use that a lot on my troll shaman ( currently level<br/>\n&gt; 21 ) because his intell is so low.

Then they&#39;d probably fill in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;missing songs with find true east, find true west and find true south.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Note that the spell they replaced with True North, Sense Magic, is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lvl 1, MAYBE lvl 4/5 spell. It did NOTHING before. Now, if you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;young, it will be a useful spell. Sure, you don&#39;t want it if you are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now lvl 49 (except to train that skill perhaps) But how many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;people still use Flame Lick at lvl 49 either?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think Verant really did improve Sense Magic, for the levels that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spell is put in at. I work to max Sense Heading first thing when I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;create a new character. 1) it takes forever. Only in lvl 8, when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I had to travel across the continent and used SEnse Heading every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;time it came up, did my bard FINALLY max Sense Heading. And even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;maxxed, its not very consistent yet. At levels 1-4, your MAX<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sense heading, after all, is 10-25... And sometimes it can be useful to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know.
