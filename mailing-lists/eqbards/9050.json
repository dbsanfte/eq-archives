As well I should point out that I am a druid but I just<br/>\nstarted a bard and I love her.  she just made level 6 and I think that<br/>\nthe best thing about being a bard is having something to look forward<br/>\nto at each level instead of every 5 like most classes.

I made over 350pp there<br/>\n&gt; tonight, and each of my friends there made over 200pp (I was<br/>\n&gt; soloing a couple hours before the others showed up).  I think<br/>\n&gt; my guild raked in close to 2000pp for the night, as well as 8<br/>\n&gt; or 9 lambent stones.  Now if they&#39;ll just fix Genni...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This place is a high level bard&#39;s dream.  Lots of open space<br/>\n&gt; to run around in, great cash loot, merchants nearby so you can<br/>\n&gt; sell the heavy weapons, etc.  The only down side was that I<br/>\n&gt; died once.  I had two giants fighting each other, then charm<br/>\n&gt; was resisted 4 times in a row, I accidently let Accelerando<br/>\n&gt; drop, and got chain-stunned 3 times, which was long enough for<br/>\n&gt; both giants to kill me.  My group wasn&#39;t able to get within<br/>\n&gt; range to heal me in time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
