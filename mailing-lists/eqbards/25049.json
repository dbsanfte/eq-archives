I&#39;ve reloaded it so many times I think it might be an interupt<br/>\nproblem. I also have seen a strange &quot;out of virtual memory...automatically<br/>\nincreasing resources...&quot; message every time I play. These only occur on<br/>\nthe SB system and only With EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the systems are rock solid and now work great with my iDSL<br/>\nconnection (was too far for ADSL). I just have to shut down EQ with Task<br/>\nMgr or reboot :(.<br/>\n<br/>\nTzeetch on Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Brett Keown &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brettke@...\">brettke@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI run W2K and it is great :) not only do I have great performance from&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nthe game, but I have a great platform to work from when not gaming<br/>\nthat&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nis solid as a rock.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; I am a &quot;little&quot; biased)<br/>\n<br/>\nI too had lots of problems with Windows ME as an upgrade to an&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nolder box.
