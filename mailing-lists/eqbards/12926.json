Bard mes (Pixie Strike) and Chain can fail<br/>\nat any moment after it&#39;s applied.  Enchanter mez and<br/>\ndruid/ranger Snare have a fixed minimum duration.

Unfortunately, since bards have to refresh<br/>\nthe song more frequently (and it can fail at any time), the<br/>\nchances of bards running into this problem are much much<br/>\nhigher.  If I were designing the game, I would never use the<br/>\nsame failure rate for both bard and enchanter.  It would<br/>\neither be outlandishly low for one, or outlandishly high for<br/>\nthe other.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
