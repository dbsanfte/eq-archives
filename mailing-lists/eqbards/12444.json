I was not happy, however I lost very little exp and got a<br/>\nrevive so all was well, we all regrouped and this time held the basement<br/>\nproperly, this was until the ghost room group trained and we all fled for<br/>\nthe zone, I think we lost a few there, I made it out this time though, the<br/>\njaps then left after this so we had the ghost room to take now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe first took the ghost room and the ghost dropped a ring but we never<br/>\nlooted<br/>\nbecause a TT popped and ran and caused a train from the torture room, this<br/>\nis<br/>\nwhere I died trying to run for the zone, had a damn hag on me and would of<br/>\nmade<br/>\nit if I hadn&#39;t been dropping health rapidly, in the end a dusty werebat got<br/>\nme =(<br/>\n<br/>\nWe was very disorganised at first, but we then established some order and<br/>\nmy friend, a level 45 cleric joined us and that made the group, it was a<br/>\nvery well balanced group we had 2 warriors, 2 clerics a wizard and me so<br/>\ndealing dmg was not a problem, most mobs barely last 10 seconds, especially<br/>\nhags. 1 cast from our cleric and they were down to 10% health. With my mana<br/>\nsong the casters were never OOM or very low on mana either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 2 ph&#39;ers we got a ghost, and he dropped the boots. We all rolled<br/>\nand my friend the 45 cleric won, 20 minutes later another ghost, he had the<br/>\nring,<br/>\nI won. The loot worked like this, there were 2 rolls, one for ring and one<br/>\nfor boots, if you won the ring roll then you are not in anymore but your<br/>\nstill in the boots, and vice versa. Another 20 minutes went by and another<br/>\nghost, and again boots. Now was my chance, and I rolled a Glorious 99,<br/>\nwoohoo. The<br/>\nboots were mine, 3k&#39;s worth of loot all mine. It was 1am by this time but I<br/>\nstayed to help others get boots, 20 minutes later was a PH hag, so killed<br/>\nthat and then the next spawn was a ghost, this went horribly wrong, he ran<br/>\nand pulled the whole basement.......and most of it was on me *sighs* I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t last long, but I was not bothered, I had a 45 cleric res on it&#39;s<br/>\nway, the group went back and found the ghost had been looted by someone, so<br/>\nwe never knew what loot it dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was now past 2am and I was very tired, I got invis undead and made my<br/>\nway out, only to have it fail infront of a hag and I then died again!!<br/>\n*sighs*<br/>\nI got yet another res and all was well, made my way out and camped. I think<br/>\nI died 4 times in total, but got 3 resses, despite this I actually made<br/>\nalmost 2 bubs exp so I am delighted. I used to hate unrest and the exp was<br/>\nshoddy, seems to pick up when you&#39;re killing loads of tough blues.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, well enough of my rambling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 32 songs - Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe information contained in this message may be CONFIDENTIAL and is<br/>\nintended for the addressee only.
