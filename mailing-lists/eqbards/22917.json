So not only is selos busted, but<br/>\nall the people trying to root/snare better have lotsa tanks around or<br/>\nthey&#39;re in trouble when root busts after a nuke.  Hmm selos is not the only<br/>\nbusted thing. Come on Verant, make an emergency patch, i cant run around<br/>\nslow for a week 8(<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately we broke the bard drums with this patch. That&#39;s already fixed<br/>\nand ready to go in with the next patch. <br/>\nWe understand the effects of not having drum bonuses for bard movement songs<br/>\n(and that is the only thing that appears to have been affected). <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, we&#39;re sorry about the error. We will have it fixed with the next<br/>\npatch. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, honestly, if this is the only thing that needs to be changed, we will<br/>\nprobably not be putting up an emergency patch to fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J.
