How many times have you had<br/>\na group together in say Sebilis - and didn&#39;t go deeper because you didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave the right classes?<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO - this is a terrible flaw of EQ and needs to be rectified.  Improving<br/>\nCrowd Control capabilities of Bards helped; and improving healing for<br/>\nShamans and Clerics could be another.  Perhaps there are other better ways<br/>\nthat don&#39;t involved &quot;nerfing&quot; clerics indirectly...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kenneth E.

The thrust of a lot of<br/>\nthese letters seems to be that a single Druid or a single Shaman should have<br/>\nenough healing to stand in<br/>\nfor a Cleric, with maybe some downtime tradeoff.  I really can&#39;t agree with<br/>\nthat.  If that were the case,<br/>\nwhat would be the point of a Cleric?  What most people don&#39;t bother noticing<br/>\nis that any combination of<br/>\ntwo of the other healing classes is already quite sufficient (with the<br/>\nexception of rez).<br/>\nShaman/Druid/Paladin, put any two in a party and you&#39;re pretty much good to<br/>\ngo.  There&#39;s a ton of Druids<br/>\nout there, the problem is that most of them don&#39;t want to or don&#39;t know how<br/>\nto heal.  That won&#39;t get fixed<br/>\nby giving them more healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 56 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
