They are<br/>\nsticking with EQ because of the friendships they have made in the game<br/>\nwithin their guild.  My entire guild (50+ players) is chomping at the bit to<br/>\nplay NWN.  As soon as NWN is released, all of us will quit EQ.  We have at<br/>\nleast five people who are going to create their own dungeons/campaign<br/>\nsettings and set up persistent servers.  I&#39;m not exactly certain how the<br/>\ntechnology end of it will work, but players will be able to link their<br/>\ncomputers together to set up a semi-persistant world. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Big Daddy Legba [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 08, 2000 3:39 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Official confirmation from Ester<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever if my guild said &quot;Hey Elf, we&#39;ve decided to move the guild to<br/>\nxxxxxxxx (anarchy online, asheron&#39;s call, UO2, Diablo2, Icewind Dale,<br/>\nwhatever)&quot;  I would leave in a second.
