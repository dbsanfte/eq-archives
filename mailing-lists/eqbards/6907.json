As most of you are aware, the song<br/>\n&gt;currently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already<br/>\n&gt;identified.  All you have to do is right click on it.  The only situations I<br/>\n&gt;have heard of the song providing any additional information is when it is<br/>\n&gt;sung while holding a head.  The name of the person who the head used to be<br/>\n&gt;attached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you are turning in<br/>\n&gt;the head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses for this song.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Although your other ideas are nice, I must disagree with your assessment of<br/>\nthe Libretto.  I have used the Libretto on NUMEROUS occasions to determine<br/>\notherwise hidden information.  Examples:  <br/>\n1) Ran across a ring lying on the bottom of a lake.  Silver, and bonus to<br/>\ncharisma... Quest item?  Hrm... Used Libretto to learn former owner&#39;s name.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Discovered that there are three different kinds of jum jum stalks, but<br/>\nthey all look the same until you identify them.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Only way to tell what Nybright necklaces you already have if you&#39;ve<br/>\nforgotten.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Found a gold earring dropped on the ground in Unrest.  Libretto told me<br/>\nit was a Pirate&#39;s Earring, which I later discovered to be part of another<br/>\nquest....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, don&#39;t dis the Libretto just yet...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your other suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>\n&gt;power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or toned<br/>\n&gt;down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A little too powerful, even at only 75%.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would rather see an intelligence booster at this level.  Be really nice<br/>\nfor trade skills ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would be a MUCH higher level (35+) if at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal<br/>\n&gt;bard songs.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now THAT would be handy...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think this<br/>\n&gt;one would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can include it if<br/>\n&gt;thats what everyone wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;rant&gt; I&#39;ve said it once, I&#39;ll say it again - I don&#39;t want to bind.  I want<br/>\nNPCs that I can pay to bind me :(  I&#39;m sick of spending an hour in a zone<br/>\nshouting and shouting myself hoarse.  Erudin, Feerott/Oggukk, and<br/>\nInnothule/Grobb are some of the worst places to try and get bound.  &lt;/rant&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m in the Army and will be going out on a field exercise this Thursday for<br/>\n&gt;the next week.  Assuming this message generates a lot of positive response,<br/>\n&gt;someone else will have to facilitate discussion on this issue until then.  I<br/>\n&gt;will write up the petition when I get back next week if we all come to an<br/>\n&gt;agreement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good luck, and we&#39;ll keep the C-rations warm for ya ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nCheck out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
