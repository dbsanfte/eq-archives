Then used heal to heal up some before dealing with<br/>\nthe 2 or 3 extra wardog nippers.  So, heal in battle is not &#39;useless&#39; - it<br/>\nhelps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGet a med qual bear skin and 15gp (maybe more - better take 25 or 30 gp just<br/>\nto be sure) find Chanda Miller in the Qeynos Hills and tell her &#39;baobob sent<br/>\nme&#39; and she will talk to you about how she can make you some bear skin<br/>\n&#39;clothes&#39; - have her make you some boots.  The stats are good - very close<br/>\nto banded and they are not heavy.  Also - you can sell them in far away<br/>\nplaces to casters who are looking for ac.  I sold a set this weekend for<br/>\n15pp - some guy was auctioning for boots and I sold him mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 20th level<br/>\na.k.a.
