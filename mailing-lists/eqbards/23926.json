If I&#39;m trying to plug a<br/>\n3-foot hole in a dam with 3 sticks of chewing gum, handing me a fourth stick of gum doesn&#39;t help.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nmemmed this song a few times in an attempt to find some song combination that could let me aggro the<br/>\nprimary MOB; I have never once had it land for any damage.  It is always resisted.  Increasing zero by 25%<br/>\nstill gives you, well, zero.  Even if this were utterly resist-proof (and as a once every 40 minutes<br/>\n&quot;desperate&quot; song, I think it easily could be), it still does so little damage on a high-end MOB that you<br/>\nwon&#39;t see the hit bar move.  Why would anyone waste a song slot on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t care, except that Verant probably thinks they&#39;ve done us a favor, and will count this towards<br/>\ntheir belief that we&#39;re &quot;balanced&quot;.  And if this is they way they&#39;re going to balance all the REST of the<br/>\nstuff, well....<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJeffrey Sue wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; At 11:20 AM 2/21/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all I can say is (excuse my language) what a fucking joke. 10 points per<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level above level 45?
