Finally, Chant grants an AC bonus whereas Anthem does<br/>\nnot.  So to me that makes it the better choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d swap Psalm of warmth/cooling for Chain if I&#39;m getting an<br/>\nunusually large number of resists (some mobs are more<br/>\nresistant, sometimes they&#39;re buffed by a casting mob).  <br/>\nWhether or not the mob dual wields/double attacks and how much<br/>\ndamage it does per hit on average also plays a factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I was not that impressed with the additional<br/>\ndamage I did with the str buff of Anthem or str/dex buff of<br/>\nChant.  Since most mobs typically get a hit in at least once<br/>\nevery 3 seconds on average, in order for Anthem/Chant to be<br/>\nbetter than Psalm, I&#39;d have to be seeing my average damage go<br/>\nup about 4-7 points every 3 seconds, which it doesn&#39;t.  So<br/>\nwhen I solo, I usually go with Warsong + Hymn + Psalm + Chain<br/>\nin that order of preference if I can manage it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
