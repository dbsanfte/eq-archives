Plus, I never play EQ with any other processes running.  Yeah, I&#39;m a<br/>\ndinosaur.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Asside from that little nastiness there is the issue of personal privacy.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not *my* fault that some moron out there is hacking EQ.  That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Verant&#39;s problem.  The fact remains that they could scan my memory and<br/>\n&gt; active tasks and just shut down EQ if it has whatever they&#39;re looking for.<br/>\n&gt; If it doesn&#39;t I play as normal.  This way no data is being transmitted from<br/>\n&gt; my computer that may be sensitive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think Verant is caught between a rock and a hard place here.  If they pull information up to their own<br/>\nservers, they get hammered by the arguments you&#39;ve presented, but if they deny people access to a service<br/>\nthat they&#39;ve paid for without some form of proof, they get sued from the other side.  I&#39;m quite certain<br/>\nthat the reasons they wanted to pull the data up were to:  1) have proof if they chose to ban a player and<br/>\n2) give them the ability to review the data to make sure that they weren&#39;t making a mistake.  Given the<br/>\nnumber of clients they have, the number of machines that are running EQ at a given time, and a whole slew<br/>\nof practical resource limits, I couldn&#39;t pulling much of anything up, and even if it contained something<br/>\nthat perhaps it shouldn&#39;t have, they wouldn&#39;t have the ability to understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the point is moot, I&#39;m really just wrestling with the philosophical and technical implications<br/>\nhere.  I&#39;m not disagreeing with you, just trying to get a handle on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 47 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
