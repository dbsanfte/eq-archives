I&#39;m usually able to taunt the mob off with using just <br/>\n&quot;chains&quot;, but worse comes to worse, I just throw in a screech and keep <br/>\nchaining for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharm definitely is the best taunt, but it could be confusing for the <br/>\nnewbie. Are you still able to whack a mob to an inch of it life, charm, <br/>\nthen have the newbie get exp?

So they have 1 mob that is pissed off at them instead of 4-5<br/>\n&gt;other ones to beat on them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, the taunt factor is so high after being mezzed like 30 times by your<br/>\n&gt;friendly neighborhood bard, that they ignore the little newbie poking them<br/>\n&gt;for like 5-6 pts and take swings at the big mean bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve run through zones seeing newbies fighting something that must have<br/>\n&gt;been yellow to them (like bandits in West Karanas) and will sit and just<br/>\n&gt;&quot;chain&quot; the creature for them.
