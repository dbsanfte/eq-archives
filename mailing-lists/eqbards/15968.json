Our &#39;real tanks&#39; have haste sashes and get augment or Swift Like the<br/>\nWind.  The songs I would not be singing would have been my (personal) swift<br/>\nsong (warsong or berzerker) and mystical shielding.  The lack of MR is the<br/>\ndownside - with it we were resisting nicely but without it we took more hits<br/>\nwas not a killer factor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wait&#39;ll Cazic or Innoruk start to death touch people.

We (group who&#39;s member got the DT) camp out as soon as<br/>\nthe first DT hits.  We try pretty hard not to agro the bosses while we are<br/>\nclearing.

There is no sense to having the<br/>\nbard and the puller in the same group. No bard songs while pulling. No bard<br/>\nsongs pre-pulling since they are casting invis, etc. There is no benefit to<br/>\nit. Not for the way we do things.  If its only 1 group involved, I am<br/>\nusually begging to be the puller (and we are fighting blues). &quot;Hey!  Let me<br/>\npull!  I wanna use my Lament song.  I can pull singles.
