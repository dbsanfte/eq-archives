Its possible, but<br/>\n&gt;unlikely.  The problem with ADM didn&#39;t involve its playing time, it stills<br/>\n&gt;plays like it did before, it just actually does something now while its<br/>\n&gt;playing.  And yes, if I changed a subroutine I knew was used by other<br/>\n&gt;processes I sure as hell would make sure what I did didn&#39;t break those <br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt;processes.  If I didn&#39;t I would soon be looking for a new job.  In fact, <br/>\n&gt;now<br/>\n&gt;that I think of it, that is my new job.  I spend 80% of my time making sure<br/>\n&gt;that exactly that sort of thing does not occur.  Something Verant obviously<br/>\n&gt;cannot be bothered to do.  Come on remember those three DoT&#39;s that when<br/>\n&gt;implemented would only work if you cast them on yourself, their testing<br/>\n&gt;record speaks for itself and it is mute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt;\tQuality Analyst in RL<br/>\n&gt;\t(I keep the rest of the programmers honest, or at least awake)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Katy Westerman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually, I can see why it slipped by.  They were changing ADM, and<br/>\n&gt;whoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>\n&gt;coded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>\n&gt;it.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>\n&gt;*every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>\n&gt;the patch would be rather long in getting out.
