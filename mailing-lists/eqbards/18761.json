My friend, Windsong, was delighted to pick up the Enduring<br/>\nBReath piece. It meant she could get rid of her Fishbone earring (that<br/>\nshe paid dearly to trade for.) Sure, you have a song. 1) It means you<br/>\ncan play nothing else 2) it skips beats in lag conditions 3) if you<br/>\ngo LD you&#39;re dead. She&#39;d MUCH rather the safety of the Fishbone<br/>\nEarring when she&#39;s playing in Kedge and other underwater dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, similarly, she likes Summon Drink. She never remembered to hit<br/>\nthe Forage button, preferring instead (ever since she was 30, that I<br/>\ncan recall) to buy stackable food and drink while in town. and you don&#39;t<br/>\nforage nearly as much water as food anyway. Now, she treats her bard like<br/>\nher cleric, and doesn&#39;t need to buy water at all. She logs in, summons 5 or<br/>\n10 drink. When she gets low, she goes to her inventory and clicks on her<br/>\nboots again. What&#39;s more, I haven&#39;t heard her complaining about the AC<br/>\neither.<br/>\nShe traded for the boots, she wanted them so much -- and they had better AC<br/>\nthan what she was wearing before.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould she complain if they upped the AC? Of course not. But she&#39;s not<br/>\nup in arms either about the AC they have now.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to realize: A ranger is more of a tank than a Bard is. It was,<br/>\nI believe, intended to be that way. RAngers get taunt. Bards do not.
