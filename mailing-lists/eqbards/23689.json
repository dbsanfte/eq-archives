I got the boots, BP and a Martune rapier. I&#39;ve only<br/>\nbeen back once for just a few hours, it was mostly clean and we just went to<br/>\nlend a hand to the crew finishing up after some folks had to camp. No bard<br/>\nstuff dropped either time from the Maestro.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh btw, I&#39;ve found wisps really really hate clerics. I haven&#39;t seen the like<br/>\nsince they turned down bard hate. Twice last night in WC my L10 cleric was<br/>\nganged by wisps. I started on one, another dove in when the first was mostly<br/>\ndead, then it was about dead a third and then a fourth jumped in! I only saw<br/>\nthe one wisp when I started the fight. I had to run. Later, I started on<br/>\nanother one and in about 2 minutes, I had five live wisps chase me to the<br/>\nzoneline after I killed the first one! Have you ever seen a wisp train? I<br/>\nhad zoned in and out between fights so there couldn&#39;t have been any leftover<br/>\naggro.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
