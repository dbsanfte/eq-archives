When I say, stone spider on track, or<br/>\n  nox on track, the druids are reporting the same exact thing at the<br/>\n  same exact time.  That&#39;s 20 vs. 100.  I wouldn&#39;t mind our tracking<br/>\n  cap lower whatsoever, to 75 or even 60.  They could then raise <br/>\n  druids to 40.  This is such a non-issue, tracking ranges are <br/>\n  not affected greatly by slight skill differences.  A ranger can,<br/>\n  however, track Djarn from the bat cave, where I cannot.  So that&#39;s<br/>\n  the difference between 100 and 200.  Otherwise, I can see everything<br/>\n  else the ranger can.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
