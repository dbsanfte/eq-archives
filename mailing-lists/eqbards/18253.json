We have been going there off and on the last<br/>\nfew nights.  We took 34 people last night on an expedition to see how far we<br/>\ncould go.  The Black Reaver we pulled had four reincarnates before the Lord<br/>\nspawned though. We got 3 Jade Reavers, a warrior only spear that just rocked<br/>\n(sorry I suck at remembering stats) and a SK mace that is something like<br/>\n19/25 +10 INT or something insane like that. From what I&#39;ve heard the Reaver<br/>\ncan reincarnate up to 13 times before the Lord spawns, I was hoping for it,<br/>\nthat is a fun fun fight!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we spent some time clearing the yard trash, we moved up to the<br/>\nbuilding past the gazebos.  We had a single rogue with us which was a good<br/>\nthing, we had to gate him to Rivervale to train lockpick up to 200 because<br/>\nthe door to that building requires a 200 skill in picklock.  Let me tell you<br/>\nits scary as hell for 34 people to go into a room that only one person can<br/>\nget us out of. We pulled into that room for a bit then moved forward. Our<br/>\npuller found a transparent ramp so we all en masse went up there.  We got<br/>\nhigh enough on that ramp that falling off = death by falling damage before<br/>\nwe got to a house.  Inside the house we got a 15 mob pull, we lost 2 people<br/>\nbut rezzed up and moved to the second house.  At that point about half the<br/>\nparty thought it was too late and wanted to leave so we levitated off the<br/>\nbridge down to the courtyard (major train action there) and fought our way<br/>\nout.  All in all that was probably the funnest thing I&#39;ve ever done in EQ,<br/>\nwe had a great time!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Oh, I got Sionachie&#39;s Partisan this morning. Thing looks nutty. Piercing,<br/>\n&gt; 9/19 +6 CHA +2 INT +5 Magic. From a Caller of Sathir in Karnor&#39;s. We also<br/>\n&gt; got a gold shield with a dragon emblem (I forget the name of this<br/>\n&gt; item) from<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok WOW!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 51 Minstrel of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
