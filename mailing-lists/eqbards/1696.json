All I want to know is how you can take out a whole camp using<br/>\n&gt; it? <br/>\n&gt; I tried this but it did not seem to work. I fought the orcs in east <br/>\n&gt; commonlands in their camps for quite a while. If i used the song on one<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; then attacked it, when it left camp, the rest of the orcs followed. Can <br/>\n&gt; somebody just explain all the uses of it?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tDon&#39;t attack the creature you use it on.  For example, if there are<br/>\nfour orcs, lament three of them and then attack the fourth one.  After you<br/>\nattack, back out of the camp so when the lament wears off on the other three<br/>\nyou will not be in their attack radius.  Once you finish off the first one,<br/>\nstart the process over again.  You need to /con the creatures first to<br/>\ndetermine which ones are most likely to resist the song.  I usually target<br/>\nthe lower levels and attack the higher levels.  You can equip your<br/>\nlute/mandolin to increase your chances of success.  Be advised that if the<br/>\ncreature resists the song then he is likely to attack you.  If there are<br/>\nother creatures nearby that haven&#39;t been lamented yet then they are likely<br/>\nto attack you also.  Need to have the drum handy so you can start up Selo&#39;s<br/>\nif you find yourself in that situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tUsing the tactic just described, I have been able to draw out 1 or 2<br/>\ndervish cutthroats at a time and leave 3-4 of them still standing in their<br/>\ncamp.  Makes life much easier for your party.  The harder thing to<br/>\naccomplish is convince the rest of the party to practice some patience and<br/>\nlet you do your trick.  Its been my misfortune to sometimes group with<br/>\npeople who just prefer to engage in a massive frontal assault and take them<br/>\nall on at once.    <br/>\n<br/>\n\tGaltin<br/>\n\tE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
