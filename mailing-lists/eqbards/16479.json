There<br/>\nwere 3 other melee types in our group so I used Berzerker and Denon&#39;s<br/>\nDischord with my brass horn.  A level 21 rogue came by and asked me: &quot;do you<br/>\nfight them with just your horn?&quot;  Sometimes it&#39;s great to be a bard!  I wish<br/>\nthere were more of these kinds of song combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess they wanted us to play more than one song in a battle (at least<br/>\nthat&#39;s what they say now) but no one in their right mind would *want* us to<br/>\nhave to switch instruments as well as songs.  That&#39;s just something that<br/>\nbards found they could do after the thuing was coded.  Had they understood<br/>\nthe day-to-day mechanics of being a bard, I can only think that they would<br/>\nhave paid more attention to songs and had more good combinations that do<br/>\n*not* require an insane amount of button pushing and instrument dropping on<br/>\nthe ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jasonf@...\">jasonf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 50 Verses of<br/>\n&gt; Victory will swap in for Berserker.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [48 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
