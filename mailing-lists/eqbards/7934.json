If you don&#39;t learn the lessons of what the<br/>\nclass can and can&#39;t do between levels 1-5, you&#39;re going to<br/>\nlearn them between levels 6-10, when you get experience loss<br/>\nfor the deaths accompanying those learning experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the twinker this is usually not a problem because the<br/>\ntwinking accelerates his level progression more than the<br/>\nexperience loss hurts.  For the folks grouped with him though,<br/>\nthis can be another matter, as they end up grouped with a<br/>\nplayer who either does not know how to play the class to best<br/>\nadvantage (e.g. bards doing nothing but bellowing during a<br/>\nfight, then healing after), or gets them into situations<br/>\nlikely to get them killed because hey if one of them is a<br/>\nclose match for me, three of them should be no problem for my<br/>\ngroup of six.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
