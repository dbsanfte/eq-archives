I looked at the ballot in<br/>\nquestion.  Granted, if you are in a hurry and/or your mind was elsewhere,<br/>\nyou may have made a mistake.  To me, the real crime is that there was a<br/>\nsample ballot in the local newpapers and samples posted in the building.<br/>\nEven with all of this information at the ready, some folks still found a<br/>\nway to mess up.

I can think<br/>\n&gt; of a hundred retorts - but it&#39;s not appropriate here...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as the ballots - a poorly defined user-interface is a poorly<br/>\ndesigned<br/>\n&gt; user interface.  The intelligence or educational level of the user isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; going to compensate for that.  We have the same type in here in Cook<br/>\n&gt; County - as the Republicans point out - BUT for everything except judicial<br/>\n&gt; retention - you never go left-right-left-right - all the candidates for an<br/>\n&gt; office are on one side of the ballot - and the opposite side is blank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I AM college educated - and voted many times - and when I got to the<br/>\n&gt; judicial part (which has options on both side) - it IS very confusing -<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; I realized I screwed it up.  But I figured &quot;It&#39;s just judges - most people<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t vote on those - who cares&quot;.  And it didn&#39;t matter - to remove a<br/>\njudge<br/>\n&gt; it requires 60 percent of the voters to vote no - and not a single has<br/>\nlost<br/>\n&gt; their job in many many years (great system there)...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That ballot in Palm Beach Florida was very poorly designed.  I guess that<br/>\n&gt; guy can always get a job working for Verant...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Joanna Wright [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Centiera@...\">Centiera@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, November 12, 2000 7:04 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] RE: Test Problem fixed<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hehe, the real irony here is the same type of ballot<br/>\n&gt; card is used in Al Gore&#39;s home county.
