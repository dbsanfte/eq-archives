Invariably I&#39;d die 3 or 4 times and<br/>\n&gt;end up barely breaking even for the evening.  Biggest problem for me at<br/>\n&gt;those levels was that if anyone in the group screwed up, the instant result<br/>\n&gt;was 1 dead bard.  Didn&#39;t matter what the screwup was, bad pull, out of<br/>\n&gt;control pet, linkdead tank, etc. End result was 1 dead bard and possibly 1<br/>\n&gt;or 2 other deaths.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well, the only way every mistake ended up with 1 dead bard is if that bard either<br/>\nwasn&#39;t paying attention to the individual situation or didn&#39;t know how to adapt to<br/>\nthe situation.  just as one example, what did you do when there was a bad pull?<br/>\ni would break out weapons and just bellow at my current level of 21.  at 23, i might<br/>\ntwist bellow and chains.  another thing that is important is knowing when to run for<br/>\nthe zone and to just do it once the call goes out.  in the 18-21 level range you should<br/>\nbe able to tank some on single pulls even with bronze armor.  if there is a 3 or 4 mob<br/>\npull and the only tank goes ld, then just call out for everyone to zone and go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Soloing at 27+ has been possible, even fairly comfortable, but that long<br/>\n&gt;stretch from 18th to 23rd was painful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Kitasi </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
