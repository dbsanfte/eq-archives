In my<br/>\n&gt; experience with the older zones, the only mobs that could see thru invis<br/>\n&gt; were undead and any mob that could cast the See Invis spell.  I&#39;ve walked<br/>\n&gt; completely thru Mistmoore with invis song up and everything I saw conned<br/>\n&gt; Indifferent.  Almost all of the mobs that were in there were yellow or<br/>\n&gt; higher to me.  I realize there were a few other mobs that could see thru<br/>\n&gt; invis but they were the exception not the norm.  Now it seems that for the<br/>\n&gt; most part invisibility in Kunark is almost worthless.  I&#39;ve been fighting<br/>\n&gt; the giants in Frontier Mtns and everyone one of them see thru invis even<br/>\n&gt; though they are lower than 35th level.  So red mobs in Mistmoore can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; me but blue mobs in Frontier Mtns can?  Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  Also,<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; the time a warrior is high enough level to get the armor that gives this<br/>\n&gt; effect, almost everything he will be fighting can see thru invis because<br/>\n&gt; they are a high level mob.  So I would imagine a lot of them view getting<br/>\n&gt; Invisibility in their armor almost as much as we view getting Summon Water<br/>\n&gt; as worthless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 18, 2000 12:14 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] GZ answers some bard questions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; level 25 is &quot;nifty&quot; to get something like this.  level 53 to get these is<br/>\n&gt; completely useless.  a warrior getting invisibility at level 53 however is<br/>\n&gt; something they would absolutely DIE for.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Up to 60% OFF food!<br/>\n&gt; Buy Now and Shipping is Free.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4016/10/_/451022/_/958691928/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4016/10/_/451022/_/958691928/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
