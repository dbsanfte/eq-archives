The greens tend to not hit as much and when they do hit<br/>\nthey dont do as much damage.  The shield of songs tends to absorb mutiple<br/>\nhits from these creatures.  This allows you and your party to handle far<br/>\nmore green critters than you would normally think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMyself, a druid and a cleric derailed a train of about 8 of those<br/>\nstraithbone healing spiders in Kaesora last night, and ended the battle with<br/>\nboth of them at half mana.  These creatures are green, but can eat a higher<br/>\nlevel party without a real tank if you are not careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note my normal hunt group is now ready for Howling Stones!<br/>\n<br/>\nLago</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
