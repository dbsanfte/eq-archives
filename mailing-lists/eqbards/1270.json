I believe they were called elf-hide gloves and<br/>\ntroll-hide belt. They each raised 2 different stats 5 points each. These<br/>\n2 pieces of armor sound like a must have but I have no idea where to<br/>\nfind them. Anyone know?<br/>\n    BTW: I prefer to use fast light weapons over minos...Once we get<br/>\ndual weild it will save lots of stamina using the light weapons also<br/>\n(combine scimitar and combine longsword is what I have my heart set on).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -Flatliner (lvl 9 bard on tunare)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
