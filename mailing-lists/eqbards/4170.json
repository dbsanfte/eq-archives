Given a symptom that has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; neutral cause and a negative cause, you are going to share in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the misery handed out by those bitter about the negative<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cause.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re indistinguishable to you. What business is it of yours? None. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve stated over and over how twinking can negatively impact<br/>\nthe gameplay of non-twinkers.  That makes it my business.  If<br/>\nall of a sudden your pay was cut by 25%, but you were unable<br/>\nto determine exactly who was responsible for the decision,<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t you say it&#39;s your business?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If there&#39;s a symptom of something that has a GOOD cause (prevents me from<br/>\n&gt; going and camping with my new character all over again) and a negative<br/>\n&gt; cause, YOU may share in the misery, but I won&#39;t. Not once have I felt any<br/>\n&gt; pain due to a twinked person.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most everyone agrees the servers are overcrowded.  If 20% of<br/>\nthe players are twinked, and they clear out 30% of the mobs in<br/>\nan area because they are more effective, that leaves 70% of<br/>\nthe mobs for the other 80% of players.  See the pain?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had friends do the same thing as you.  But I daresay,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most twinked characters are secondary (or third, or fourth,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc) characters made by players who want to build up a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different class/character quickly, with little regard for all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the toes they&#39;ll be stepping on on the way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh yes, look at all those toes I stepped on by not camping for tomahawks..<br/>\n&gt; oh my god. I guess I better go camp those items (with my new char), making<br/>\n&gt; everyone wait longer and the game less and less fun for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Reread the first line in my message you&#39;re quoting.  I have no<br/>\nproblem with giving equipment to other characters when you&#39;re<br/>\ndone using it.  All I was saying is that that sort of twinking<br/>\nis indistinguishable from the evil sort, and as such you are<br/>\ngoing to catch some of the flak aimed at the evil kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The alternative is to stop crying and whining over things that are most<br/>\n&gt; likely not hurting you and most likely do more good than harm.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your choice seems to be to shoot all the innocents just in case there&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; bad guy in there. What an honorable decision, yes, you shot the bad guys..<br/>\n&gt; nevermind those people who are actually making the situation better.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find it odd that you&#39;re so upset about this.  If you&#39;re one<br/>\nof these innocents, the *only* problem you&#39;ll have which can&#39;t<br/>\nbe handled by the /ignore command is people withholding help<br/>\nfrom you.  Why should people be obligated to help you?  I<br/>\nsense a double-standard - twinkers should be free to play the<br/>\ngame the way they choose, but other players shouldn&#39;t be free<br/>\nto withhold help from twinkers?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if it bothers you this much, you can stop it immediately -<br/>\nput away your twinked items until they&#39;re appropriate for your<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
