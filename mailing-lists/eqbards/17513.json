I feel more comfortable twisting buffs<br/>\nand debuffs than damage songs (especially those nasty AEs...got me into<br/>\ntrouble more than once when I was young).  Most of this comes from the fact<br/>\nthat my group mainly consists of myself and a warrior.  When in larger<br/>\ngroups, I tend to just go with what I know: Celerity/Chant/Chains in battle<br/>\nand Clarity/Hymn in downtime with a lute, Charm if there&#39;s one or two extra<br/>\nmobs, Pixie for more.  I get really confused if there&#39;s a snarer or an<br/>\nenchanter, usually switching Chains or Celerity for Fufil&#39;s but leaving them<br/>\nmemorized just in case.  In larger groups, the mobs go down so fast that<br/>\nresists didn&#39;t really seem necessary, and in the smaller groups, buffs<br/>\nseemed more needed than resists or damage songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started to wonder if I&#39;m working up to my full potential.  I&#39;m getting<br/>\nto the point now where Charm is not as useful and my buffs don&#39;t play nice<br/>\nwith everyone else&#39;s.  I&#39;m starting to feel a little useless except as a<br/>\ncrack dealer.  Can anyone help me out here?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobynn Merrilin, level 40 wood elf bard, E&#39;ci<br/>\nCheck out the E&#39;ci server webpage! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/eciserver\">http://www.geocities.com/eciserver</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaty Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.           <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\nCS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
