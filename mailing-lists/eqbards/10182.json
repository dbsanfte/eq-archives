Here&#39;s<br/>\nmy opinion on the questions you asked.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My questions are these:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Is what I am doing wrong?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tNope.  Play the character the way you want.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tNope.  Would be nice if more people played this way but to each his<br/>\nown.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I am a twink?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tI wouldn&#39;t worry about.  You know you aren&#39;t a twink so thats all<br/>\nthat matters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this character.  And, I<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   never thought twice about it until I was reading some recent posts. Will<br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt;   be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tIts your money, spend it how ever you want to.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
