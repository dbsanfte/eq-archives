The mob in question is a<br/>\nFailed Crypt Raider. He drops the coin, an illegible cantrip (no drop lore)<br/>\na tattered scroll (lore and written in some language I have) and sometimes<br/>\nhe&#39;ll drop additional loot. The first time we took him down he also dropped<br/>\na spear of mortification. (dam 6, delay 23, effect: stun, shaman only). He<br/>\nseems to be on a 40 min spawn cycle where the rest of the dungeon is on a 20<br/>\nmin spawn cycle, and he spawns just out back of the library.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was blue to me at 42, as were most of the mobs in this area, but they are<br/>\nevenly spaced can be done in a group of 4 with no troubles. For those of us<br/>\nwho have evil friends, you only need watch out for the spiders at the<br/>\nentrance area. None of the skeles or specs gave detrimental faction hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got 2 coins, so if anyone on trbiunal wants to trade the scorpoid coin,<br/>\nlet me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nBard of the 43rd season<br/>\n[the Tribunal]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
