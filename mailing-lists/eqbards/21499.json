I saw it and became<br/>\ncurious.  Come to find out they are hyping ut as not only a RTS controller,<br/>\nbut a a role playing controller as well.  Hmmmmm....  It even comes with 3<br/>\npre-configured control sets for Asheron&#39;s Call (magic user, fighter with<br/>\nmagic, and warrior or something to that effect).<br/>\n<br/>\nSooooo, my question was, has anyone tried this thing with EQ?  If so, how is<br/>\nit?  I know that several people on the list use other game controllers to<br/>\nplay, wondered if anyone had checked this one out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nWeiland<br/>\nPerpetually 30 something bard of E.
