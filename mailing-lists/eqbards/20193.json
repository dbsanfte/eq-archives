Each class gets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ten representatives.  The class fansite web boards will be used to vote on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the representatives.  For example, bards have The Concert Hall, rogues<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have The Safehouse, etc.  The administrators for those sites would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsible for setting up a poll for each class to determine who they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to represent them.  I think that it would be fairly easy for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; community of each class to come to a consensus on who they want.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; primary character is a bard so I&#39;m most familiar with that community.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are several well known bards who post on the Concert Hall board and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the eqbards mailing list.  These bards would be prime candidates as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; official representatives for the class.  I think it is also safe to assume<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that other classes have equivalent players.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>those message boards are a fairly small cross section relative to the number of<br/>\nplayers in eq.  true there are a bunch of people who just lurk and never post, but<br/>\ni&#39;d say there are really only 20-30 regular posters on the backstage board.  this<br/>\nis not counting the random people who come in and post a question, but don&#39;t<br/>\nrespond or participate a lot in other threads/discussions.  also, there is a tendency<br/>\non most class boards to be fairly to very anti verant, anti change, etc., which really<br/>\ndoes not represent the majority of the players.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2)  Type of forum.  This could be set up as a moderated mailing list or a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; secure message board on the Everquest website.  Either way, the only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people with access to the site are the player representatives and Verant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; employees.  There would have to be a rule established that all discussion<br/>\n&gt; &gt; between Verant and the representatives is considered confidential and not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for public release unless Verant grants permission.  Any player who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; violates this rule is removed from the council and a replacement selected.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you mean until they get upset about something.  after verant got burned with the<br/>\ntest server situation, i&#39;m not sure they&#39;ll trust players with sensitive information, even<br/>\nwhen covered by an NDA again.  most of the spoilers being posted from the test<br/>\nserver were posted or originated by people who were under an NDA with verant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This just covers the basic framework.  The details can get fleshed out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; later if Verant thinks its a good idea.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As you are well aware of, a lot of players are frustrated with Verant for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a perceived lack of customer service.  In my opinion, Verant can improve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their relationship with their player base by instituting an official<br/>\n&gt; &gt; player&#39;s council.  This would go a long way in helping to prove that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant cares for the players.  Its a win-win situation for both sides that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can be easily implemented.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for taking the time to consider this proposal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tom Reece<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aka Galtin Randayn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 39 bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; E&#39;ci server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Make a prediction on something you know is going to come true and <br/>\n&gt;get rewarded for it at AllPredict.com. <br/>\n&gt;Let&#39;s AllPredict the future at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5641/13/_/451022/_/962324520/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5641/13/_/451022/_/962324520/</a><br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
