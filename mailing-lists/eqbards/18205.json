He said came<br/>\nacross it while they were fighting their way out of some ancient city filled<br/>\nwith golems.  They lost many strong troops on that expedition. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo kidding!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 50 songs<br/>\n... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\np.s. we also located the guy who talks about getting to Veeshan.  Stuff was<br/>\nposted on casters realm by others:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hail Emporer Ganak.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreeting..It has been long since I have been aware of this plane..Who are<br/>\nyou, and what do you want of I, Ganak, slayer of Jaled-Dar?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wish to know of Veeshans Peak?! You are either very brave or very<br/>\nfoolish! There is nothing there for the uninvited but a fiery death. I have<br/>\nbeen away from this plane of existance for a long time yet sill I feel the<br/>\npresence of the ancient wurms. I am sure they sense my presence as well,<br/>\nbeing as I hold the only [key to the Chambers] of the Ring of Scale.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s. If you are exploring and you find zone portals (assuming that you can<br/>\ntell it&#39;s a portal before you zone) you might wanna duel down and pop in<br/>\nnekkid, just in case it&#39;s a one-way portal guarded on the inside by some<br/>\nmean and nastys.  Although it&#39;s looking like the really scary ones: fight<br/>\nyour way in, one-way in and some other way out, insta-spawn mobs on evac<br/>\nspells, keys to get in - nobody knows how to get out are not something you<br/>\nare going to just stumble into.  It&#39;s been a long time since I have been<br/>\nthis scared!
