Not very <br/>\nuseful, when I&#39;d rather AE sleep or Pixie Strike monsters.<br/>\nIf we are taking on a group of monsters I would rather<br/>\nthem all (save one) be sleep, than all of them attacking<br/>\nme at a 25% or so reduced speed.  A quick pixie strike<br/>\nagainst a few extra holds them long enough to deal with<br/>\nlater.  However, I would prefer group on one, and I always<br/>\nshy away from group vs group confrontations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for chains, and I&#39;m still touchy on this one, I think<br/>\nthat bards should chain for the first 3/4&#39;s of the monsters<br/>\nlife, then call for a snare just before the monster will turn.<br/>\nThe reduced heat with chains is VERY noticable, and allowing<br/>\nlazy rangers/druids to snare in the beginning, so they dont<br/>\nforget about it later, is poor tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe monsters that I fight now, hit for 60-80, and have thousands<br/>\nof HP.  The battles don&#39;t go so quick, that chain + snare will<br/>\nconflict.  In fact, I can chain about 6 times, before I call for<br/>\na snare (obviously more effective placeholding than my chains).<br/>\nBut the chains decrease the damage the party tanks are taking <br/>\ndramatically.  Having a snare on a monster is utterly useless<br/>\nuntil it decides to run.  This was my point in an earlier thread<br/>\nwhich turned into a &#39;I hate snare&#39; conversation, which is just<br/>\nnot true.  Snare has a purpose, but chains do as well.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nlet a ranger/druid tell you to stop chains in early battle,<br/>\njust so they can put a snare on the monster so they don&#39;t forget<br/>\nlater on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 34th wisdom via experience.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
