I don&#39;t want to spoil anyone&#39;s fun so I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;mention the name of the mob or the zone, I was just wondering if any of you<br/>\n&gt;have killed him firsthand. If so, what level would you recommend for <br/>\n&gt;soloing<br/>\n&gt;him or for a party killing him. Also, what faction hits do you take (if you<br/>\n&gt;remember)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can answer this for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) the spawn time on this NPC is 6 hours with no placeholders.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The earring is his rare drop. I&#39;ve happened upon him 6 or 7 times, he&#39;s <br/>\nnever had it.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) You take bad faction with the area (don&#39;t remember the factions offhand <br/>\nbut its the same as the factions you&#39;d take for killing a guard in that <br/>\nzone).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember now what level I was when he conned white to me, but it was <br/>\nin my 20&#39;s somewhere. He is pretty easy for his level, but at least on our <br/>\nserver, its impossible to find him uncamped (and even when he appears <br/>\nuncamped, if you hang around til he spawns you&#39;ll find a few druids and <br/>\nwizards gate in just in time to kill him then gate out again).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 50 Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
