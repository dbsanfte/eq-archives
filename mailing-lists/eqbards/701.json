I play a<br/>\nwood-elf and a half-elf , putting most of the extra points into strength on<br/>\nboth characters and there isnt a difference in playability that I&#39;ve seen so<br/>\nfar.  The wood-elf is my favorite though only for convenience sake since you<br/>\nget forage and hide right off the bat where as half&#39;elves dont.  If you like<br/>\nbeing human go for it, never played one yet as I dont like the lack of night<br/>\nvision.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
