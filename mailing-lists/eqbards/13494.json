This might keep you guys<br/>\nbusy until expansion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy points about neglecting 46- level characters is still valid however.<br/>\nSince this game has been out, players have consistently begged Verant to add<br/>\nmore quality quests to the game.  With the exception of the class armor<br/>\nquests, most of the other quests for low and medium level characters flat<br/>\nout suck and aren&#39;t worth the time and effort.  Is it too much to expect<br/>\nthat as the game evolves over time, Verant will make improvements to all<br/>\naspects of the game?  You yourself stated the 50 level players are bored so<br/>\nthats why they start twink characters.  It sure would be nice if those<br/>\ntwinks had something different to look forward to (new items and quests).<br/>\nAs it stands now, all they get to do is the stuff their 50th level character<br/>\nhas probably already done countless times over.  How boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; One thing what do you think us 46+ players had to play with? Guess what<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; low levels are having a ton more fun then us high levles why do you think<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; many of us twink? They have to do something about high levels because they<br/>\n&gt; are the most unhappy there are only two zones excluding planes that people<br/>\n&gt; do sol b and guk. DO you have any clue how crowded it is? We were doing<br/>\n&gt; bothg planes and both dragons at the same time on E&#39;ci and guess what<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; is still 80+ people in guk and sol b. This is a major problem and they<br/>\n&gt; need<br/>\n&gt; to fix the problem not add stuff for low levels who are just complaining<br/>\n&gt; that they don&#39;t get anything new added. Perosnally I could care less if<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t add anything new for me but I do care that it&#39;s crowded as hell<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; high levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Friday, January 21, 2000 4:48 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Someone posted a link on the new Concert Hall message board of the new<br/>\n&gt; bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;quests on the PoA.  There are six bard quests and each quest requires you<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;obtain three items to get the reward.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Abashi posted earlier that 200+ class specific items were included in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;new patch.  It appears that most, if not all, of these 200+ items are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;related to the PoA quests. Each class gets six quests.  Thats 84 new<br/>\n&gt; items.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I only looked at the bard quests, but assuming all class quests require<br/>\n&gt; &gt;three components, thats 252 quests components (84 x3).  Some of the quest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;used the same components so this number is probably a lot lower.  Most of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the quest components were items I had never heard of so I don&#39;t know if<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are dropped only in PoA or in other zones.  I assume the 200+ class<br/>\n&gt; specific<br/>\n&gt; &gt;items Abashi referred to were the 84 quest reward items and the 252+/-<br/>\n&gt; quest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;components.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rant on:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have no problems with Verant adding more stuff for the 46+ players to<br/>\n&gt; do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That gets them out of the zone where I&#39;m at.  What I do have a concern<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is the apparent lack of attention given to players less than 46th level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With the exception of the class armor quests added a few months back and<br/>\n&gt; new<br/>\n&gt; &gt;loot found in Paw, almost every new item/quest that has been recently<br/>\n&gt; (past<br/>\n&gt; &gt;few months) added to the game is geared toward the 46+ player.  I am not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;aware of any new items/quests added to the game geared toward medium<br/>\n&gt; level<br/>\n&gt; &gt;characters.  Perhaps my observation is subjective, but it seems to me<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Verant is focusing on keeping the 46+ characters happy at the expense of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;45- characters. Am I out of line thinking this way?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Caveat: Its quite possible that the new PoA quest component items are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;usuable until they are traded in and obtainable in zones outside of PoA.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Its also possible that these items are ideally suited for use by medium<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;high level characters.  If this turns out to be true I&#39;ll eat my words.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rant off<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;32 bard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hey Freelancers:  Find your next project through JobSwarm!  <br/>\n&gt;   You can even make money in your sleep by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
