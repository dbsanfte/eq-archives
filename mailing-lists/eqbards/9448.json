I don&#39;t feel much<br/>\ndifferent that when I was around 15-17ish (getting dual wield was a great<br/>\nachievement to me &lt;g&gt;) Then 20 was great for invis and I could explore some<br/>\nand learn who can &quot;see invis&quot; -- ugh Borxx and his dazed buddys.  And then<br/>\nthe 26,27,28 songs (fear, charm, mez) I felt like a real bard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah -=&lt;*32*&gt;=- and uber-bard now - well kinda.  I see someone (caster)<br/>\nsitting and so I toss an invite.  And I get &quot;ack! u r green to me!&quot; (like<br/>\nthey think I wanna go deep into the dungeon with them) So I go, &quot;hey I&#39;ll<br/>\nheal med then dis u - unless my mana is too green for u? &lt;smiles&gt;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it is different.  I can&#39;t (solo) fight anything that will give me xp<br/>\nin any sort of efficient manner unless I am with a good group.  The places<br/>\nfor my level are pretty hard now (Old Guk, Nagafens) and I can&#39;t join just<br/>\nany group.  The chances are pretty high that I will die and if I do, it&#39;s<br/>\nprobably impossible for me to get my own stuff.  So, I gotta be in a group I<br/>\ncan trust enuf to consent and it&#39;s gotta have a cleric.  First off to keep<br/>\nme alive and secondly to rez me when I do die.  Although I seem to be<br/>\ngetting past this die-ing business.  I have not died with my regular group<br/>\nin sometime now.  Either we are not stretching our limits like we used to or<br/>\nwe have just gotten a bit better. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think the next step is getting to know more players who are my level and<br/>\nknow who I can safely group with.  I had a good expedition into Permafrost<br/>\nto the King room - with a &#39;pick-up&#39; group - but I knew the leaders and they<br/>\nwere pretty high levels.  We killed some stuff and got the champion to spawn<br/>\nand got him too.  Everyone had one all ready or could not use so I got my<br/>\nCrysBlade the old fashioned way!  I looted it!  Then the Ice Giant Priestess<br/>\nwas pulled and we had more than we could handle.  Thank thee Gods that our<br/>\ndruid had the good sense to evac when he did -  Loading, Please Wait... You<br/>\nhave entered Butcher Block, never thought I would be so happy to be there!<br/>\n<br/>\nLater last night, my reg group has camped the assassin room in old guk.  I<br/>\nmeet our Shadow Knight at he zone and she guides me thru upper - something<br/>\nsees thru my invis and attacks me like always and without my guide I&#39;d<br/>\nprolly be running back to the zone.  But at least now, in lguk, I can find<br/>\nthe bedroom and can hug the wall past he greater dark bones and from there<br/>\non to the assassin room.  So we spend a few good hours in there and I did<br/>\nget mine!!  Now WOO HOO!!!  That is almost as great as getting my speed<br/>\nsong!  Hehe, the guise is great - for some reason - I really wanted one!<br/>\nAnd hack, slash and killing my way up to 35 - how I did it boggles my mind<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  but it was really fun to &quot;be there&quot; in one of the really hard places<br/>\nand loot one of the treasures of the game.  And now, here&#39;s what I have been<br/>\nworking on for 35 levels -- so ok - where can I buy some milk and muffins in<br/>\nNeriak???<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/desylly1.jpg\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/desylly1.jpg</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tFriday, October 29, 1999 4:07 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] since harpers.net is no more<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t\tOn Fri, 29 Oct 1999, James Schuldes wrote:<br/>\n\t\t&gt; <br/>\n\t\t&gt; Hmm, I just went and looked at the song listing there and<br/>\nthought hmm, it<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t*boggles at the thought that you could get to level 35 and<br/>\nnot<br/>\n\t\tknow this*  :-) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
