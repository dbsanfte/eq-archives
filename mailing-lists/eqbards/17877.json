All folks <br/>\n&gt; engaging in the event were told to un-mem any DoT <br/>\n&gt; spells/songs, and leave any weapons that proc DoT&#39;s either in <br/>\n&gt; the bank, or unequipped.  Seeing as I was the organizer, I <br/>\n&gt; left my beloved Kisch in the bank (-=sigh!=-) and whooped out <br/>\n&gt; the ol&#39; Obsidian Shard.  The Shard (from all I have read is <br/>\n&gt; SUPPOSEDLY a simple 30pt DD proc. right?  Well, imagine my <br/>\n&gt; suprise when a few ticks (not sure hopw many) after it procs, <br/>\n&gt; I get the old &quot;The Obsidian Shatter effect has worn off&quot; <br/>\n&gt; message.  Question:  Was there an update to this weapon that <br/>\n&gt; I missed?  (haven&#39;t used it in over a month)<br/>\n&gt; btw... No matter what Abashi says, Necro and Bard fears STILL <br/>\n&gt; work in the Arena&#39;s PvP zone, and in a Duel(he even replied <br/>\n&gt; to a post of mine about it saying they disabled it).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=B=-<br/>\n&gt; Barrd Talespinner  (aka NOR Bard)<br/>\n&gt; Count of the New OutRiders<br/>\n&gt; Troll-Smacker Emeritus<br/>\n&gt; 28th Season of filling The Rathe with song<br/>\n&gt; Creator of BS Titles<br/>\n&gt; And One Helluva Nice Guy  ;o)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; High rates giving you headaches?
