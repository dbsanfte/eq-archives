Also, stick to the full<br/>\nscreen mode,<br/>\nI really noticed shorter &quot;grey time&quot; for my song buttons.<br/>\n<br/>\nGorson 21 yr-old Bard<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you stop a song, you have to wait for the button to<br/>\n&quot;ungrey.&quot;  The speed of that animation depends entire on the<br/>\nframes per second you&#39;re getting.  If you&#39;re on a slow system<br/>\nor lagged due to spell animations, it&#39;s going to take longer.<br/>\nOn my original K6-200 system, it was impossible to play more<br/>\nthan 2 songs at a time because the buttons took over a half<br/>\nsecond to ungrey.  Right now on my 550 MHz system, I play in<br/>\nD3D mode, even though glide mode produces cleaner output with<br/>\nless jerkiness.  The D3D mode has a higher fps, and the slight<br/>\ndifference is very noticeable when I start pounding at the<br/>\nsong buttons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is probably my biggest gripe about the interface.  It<br/>\nmakes sense when applied to spellcasting (the spells usually<br/>\nremained greyed for several seconds after casting, so an<br/>\nextra quarter second doesn&#39;t really matter), but is really<br/>\nstupid when applied to our songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
