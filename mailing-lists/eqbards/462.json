When<br/>\nyou try this out on a group, tell the spellcasters to go to their Persona<br/>\nscreen so they can monitor how much mana they regenerate per pulse both with<br/>\nand without the Jig playing.

Now it does not perform like the high level song of <br/>\n&gt; course, but many of my friends swear by it. We noticed this in beta and it<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; was widely debated, but many have told me they see a difference. Next time<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; you are in a group, try it while the casters are medding and see if they<br/>\n&gt; can <br/>\n&gt; tell a difference.<br/>\n&gt; Brilinnia, a Bard on Xegony<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
