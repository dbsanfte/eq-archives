We<br/>\narrived in cazic at the very over populated hour of 9:30 pm est, and<br/>\nneedless to say, EVERYTHING was camped. After getting in contact with the<br/>\nAoF group, we put our selves on the list and ported over to MM to earn some<br/>\nexp while waiting. 3 hours later, we get the tell saying they are leaving so<br/>\nwe port back and prepare ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were a little slow getting to the room since we had to rebind ourselves<br/>\nin Ogguk and by the time we got there the room was fully spawned. But, using<br/>\nthe &quot;Ever So Handy&quot; directions(tm) from the list, we had no trouble breaking<br/>\nand clearing the spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe pulled the sewer room first and learned that alligators have an endless<br/>\namount of HP. After that we pulled the avatar room trying very hard to kill<br/>\nthe avatar PH last. After a 10 minute wait, I went back in and pulled the<br/>\ntop room over the avatar globe. And then we set to pulling the sewers while<br/>\nwaiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few bad pulls led to evacs, as did some miscomunications, but when all the<br/>\ndust settled the score was Us 2, avatar 0. We walked away with 1 set of<br/>\nclaws and the ravenscale BP we were after. ( if only it had been ruby = P  )<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t expect the camp to go that smoothly. Knowing the BP is the rare<br/>\ndrop, I expected to be there a few days at least before seeing the BP. We<br/>\ngot extremely lucky. We were hoping to get some boots off the cenobite also,<br/>\nbut he didn&#39;t make any appearances, so our rogue capitulated to buying them<br/>\nrather than camp them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the point is now I need advice on our next camp spot. which is...<br/>\n(drumroll)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ghoul Executioner in lower guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know he&#39;s a level 37 ish warrior. But that&#39;s about it. Any info on the<br/>\nother spawns in the room (how many) and his relative str when spawned with<br/>\nthe hood vs with the axe would be greatly appreciated. Also, I have yet to<br/>\nfind a stellar map of lower guk. (although I&#39;m working on one) I can get to<br/>\nthe store room easily and can navigate the live side, but the dead side is<br/>\nstill very much a mystery. Any directions on getting to the exe would be<br/>\ngreatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nbard of the Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
