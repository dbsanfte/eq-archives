I did the Qeynos to HighKeep to Freeport runs last night and started <br/>\nback again. I am making a list of names and locations as I go and will post <br/>\nit as a spoiler maybe when I am reasonably sure it&#39;s complete.<br/>\nAlso, Xegony has a L50 bard now. I will try to ask him some of the questions<br/>\n<br/>\nwe talk about, what songs does he use most, what equipemnt does he prefer <br/>\netc, when I see that he is somewhere he can talk. He was in gukbottom last <br/>\nnight when I noticed he was 50, not a cozy spot to stop and chat. Is anyone <br/>\ninterested in this enough for me to post his answers?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nSquire Master, Order of the Rose<br/>\nThe Right and Noble Order of Excalibur<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAttention ONElist list owners.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nCheck out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.
