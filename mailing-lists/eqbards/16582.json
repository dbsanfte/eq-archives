I don&#39;t want to strip them of that<br/>\n  title.  That&#39;s my issue I&#39;m torn between.  I don&#39;t want to have to<br/>\n  exceed their values, but I think the fact our duration is so, so<br/>\n  low that we need some compensation.  Alternatively, one click =<br/>\n  6 buffs basically.  So Verant may be counting the easy of use, and<br/>\n  the multiplicity factor in there as well.  But still, 6 secs...<br/>\n  ugh ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really don&#39;t know what the solution is.  I just want us to <br/>\n  represent everything a balanced party would be looking for with<br/>\n  some unique skills.  I don&#39;t know that super buffs would do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
