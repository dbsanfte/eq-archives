There are very few highlevel &#39;knowledgable&#39; bards<br/>\n  on Innoruuk.  The few that are out there were swept up into<br/>\n  the top guilds, the up and coming bards (that show promise)<br/>\n  are being pulled into said guilds as well.  Perhaps to be <br/>\n  powered up to a level where they become more useful.  Bards <br/>\n  have always been sort of outcasts, but now the true power is<br/>\n  shining through.  Lots of people are playing 2nd toon bards,<br/>\n  as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
