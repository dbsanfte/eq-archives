We have lots of quests involving sons / daughters. but you <br/>\nhave no idea how old they are , we have no idea how old anyone is. Some <br/>\npeople might say this is a good thing , i think it sucks. I personally would <br/>\nhave loved starting out as a teenager , and every ten levels getting a new <br/>\nlook. being grown up or even old by lvl 50.  So in that whole crappy conning <br/>\nsystem you could tell a red from a RED just by looking at them ( i know this <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t apply to most monsters and animals and such) .<br/>\nI personally wish this game was more immersive , sometimes it can be , but <br/>\nother times it just isn&#39;t at all. I would like to be able to feel why the <br/>\ndark elves are evil , and why they hate the wood elves and such.
