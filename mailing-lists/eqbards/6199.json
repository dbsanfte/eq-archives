When I last tried to play the<br/>\ngame at home P200 with a modem (not helped by the fact that I&#39;m in England),<br/>\nI managed to &quot;outrun&quot; _my own_ Accelerando. I&#39;d be constantly playing<br/>\naccelerando with a drum, but quite often I&#39;d get the slow down message. I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking that the Accelerando effect plants itself where you are playing it<br/>\nevery tick, and has a big enough range that you can&#39;t normally outrun it. It<br/>\nwas a bit freaky to actually outrun my own song even though all the song<br/>\neffects were still going (I actually lost the icon and everything until the<br/>\nnext pulse).<br/>\n<br/>\nBragi - Bard of 13 songs (who really thinks he ought to upgrade his home<br/>\nmachine)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
