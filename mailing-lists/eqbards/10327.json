These constant nerfs are becoming the rule of<br/>\nthumb. Why the hell Verant feels the need to yank the rug out from under a<br/>\nclasses collective feet is beyond me. Quit messing with established skills.<br/>\nTry fixing the damn monster AI instead. Oh that&#39;s too hard? It&#39;s easier just<br/>\nto screw with several thousand players characters?

The way Verant<br/>\n&gt; described it was the way FD was supposed to be working prior to the patch.<br/>\n&gt; There was a bug in the code that caused it to work not as Verant thought<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; did, but as Yeti and others had observed it to.  According to GZ after the<br/>\n&gt; next patch it will work 100% below level 35 totally and as reported after<br/>\n&gt; that, IF there are no other bugs in the code that are in effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He also said interestingly that the reason it did not work before the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>patch<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; as advertised was that the code for them forgetting was supposed to be an<br/>\n&gt; exact copy of the code for forgetting a mob that had hopelessly outrun<br/>\n </span></blockquote>them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (as we often see in effect in w karana with bandits).  The code however<br/>\n </span></blockquote>was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; copied before they fixed the bug in the code for outrunning and the<br/>\n&gt; corrected outrunning code was never pasted back into FD.  So the answer is<br/>\n&gt; basically yes, Yeti is right, and Verant thought they were right and only<br/>\n&gt; discovered they were not when they found the bug in the previous code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Rokenn Swiftsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 18, 1999 1:49 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ-Bards@onelist.com\">EQ-Bards@onelist.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQBards@onelist.com\">EQBards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] OT: Feign Death nerf (long)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am reposting this from the Monk MB<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://server3.ezboard.com/feverquestmonksfeigndeathnerf.html)\">http://server3.ezboard.com/feverquestmonksfeigndeathnerf.html)</a>.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have known Yeti since Beta 3 (when he was known as Orcus).

The changes are<br/>\n&gt; significant, a nerf, and their news message was misleading.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you.&quot; - No,<br/>\n&gt; they came back based on aggro radius. If you saw them wander away to a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>safe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; distance, you could get up without training anyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If not, they would come after you at some later point. This might happen<br/>\n&gt; within a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later&quot; - This was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; random, but the result of game mechanics understood by experienced<br/>\n </span></blockquote>feigners.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; A feigned upon mob has you in its aggro list. If someone else re-aggros<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mob to a lesser degree than the original feigner, it will return to the<br/>\n&gt; feigner. Feigners knew this! If the mobs were in front of them in a room,<br/>\n&gt; they knew no one would disturb them and all was fine. If the mobs were<br/>\n&gt; scattered around the dungeon by a train wandering home, they knew to zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;.... Four times means about 20 percent ....&quot; - These numbers seem totally<br/>\n&gt; inaccurate. I had to feign 11 times on a green guard and 10 times on a<br/>\n&gt; knight while testing in Freeport. If ANY of your feign attempts fails<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(xxxx<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; has fallen to the ground) then the mob comes running back. NO OTHER SKILL<br/>\n&gt; takes 4 or more successful skill checks in a row to perform a single act.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; you have multiple mobs, it is almost impossible to fool them all. If even<br/>\n&gt; one is not fooled, it will build a train as it runs to you - quite<br/>\n </span></blockquote>possibly<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from so far out of sight that you don&#39;t even know you are killing other<br/>\n&gt; players.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Feign used to be predictable. If you were successful against a mob that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>can<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be fooled (some couldn&#39;t be - this was a matter of experience and feigners<br/>\n&gt; knew which mobs to avoid), it would never come back unless re-aggroed by<br/>\n&gt; another player. Verant implies otherwise, but it is NOW that the skill is<br/>\n&gt; totally unpredictable, with mobs that are far out of sight deep in the<br/>\n&gt; dungeon randomly returning, based on percentages apparently much worse<br/>\n </span></blockquote>than<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; those Verant gave and which are useless against multiple mobs. Stand up,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; a feigner doesn&#39;t know if he is killing people far out of sight, or has<br/>\n&gt; safely cleared aggro.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Before a player had to re-aggro a mob in such a way that the feigner was<br/>\n&gt; still higher on its aggro list (such as by coming very close, but doing no<br/>\n&gt; damage), and in this case it was usually only the feigner that was in<br/>\n&gt; danger. Now every time a feigner stands up mobs can come training from<br/>\n&gt; everywhere, and if he feigns again because he sees them coming, they will<br/>\n&gt; attack anyone nearby or in their path home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Feign pulling is still possible, although harder. Feign twinking/leveling<br/>\n&gt; others is still possible, and should actually be easier. Feigning to avoid<br/>\n&gt; death or trains now results in far more trains.
