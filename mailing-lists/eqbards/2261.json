After one particular tough battle, one of the party<br/>\n&gt;members stated that the fight would have been a lot easier if he hadn&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt;rooted the entire battle.  I then told him that had he informed the group<br/>\n&gt;that he was rooted, Roop or I could have easily broken him free with Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I thought that Selo&#39;s only broke a root spell on the bard who<br/>\nsings it, not on the party members. Any confirmation on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you&#39;re absolutely right about multiple bards in a group. Also, an<br/>\nentire group of bards is pretty interesting in a fight when you get to the<br/>\nlvl 15 and above range. You MUST coordinate your songs, but if you take the<br/>\ntime to do so, you can do some amazing things in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne fun thing to try with a group of two or three bards is to learn how to<br/>\nstack CoD. You CAN do this, but you have to time it so that the pulses come<br/>\nat slightly different times. If you work it right, your opponent will wince<br/>\nuntil he dies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nListen and Live.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nJythri duan Cliar<br/>\nPencerdd of The Soerbaird<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
