Copied from the thread:<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n* Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (15) - Resist rates so high that song is <br/>\nunusable. Level 50 bards get 50% resist rates on level 1 mobs. Resist <br/>\nrates for many sub 30 bards well over 80%. Resist rates were more <br/>\nreasonable prior to patch that added secondary resist check. Also, <br/>\nthe song affects pets on pvp servers. Also, the song is considered <br/>\nhigher than enchanter enthrall spell. Action: Look into resist rates <br/>\non song & adjust.<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Bill Mann&quot; &lt;dabard@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Amen!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Haven&#39;t read the thread - but personally - I&#39;m more concerned with <br/>\nLullaby<br/>\n&gt; &gt;being looked at than any of the issues posted here...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Slyde 41 of Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
