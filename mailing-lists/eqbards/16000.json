However I tend to solo, a LOT<br/>\nand in EQ that&#39;s pretty much stopped me cold (unless I wanna play a<br/>\nnerfomancer or a druid - which I dont).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I like best about AC is that I *Can* solo whenever I like.  If I&#39;m<br/>\nin a grouping mood and my friends are online (I generally play AC while I<br/>\nwait for the normal time we play then switch) I log into EQ.  If they&#39;re not<br/>\nonline or I just want to solo I play AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too would LOVE to see a blend of these two games.  They&#39;re both fantastic<br/>\nand if a company took the strengths of both they&#39;d steal everyone&#39;s<br/>\ncustomers fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC - Size, scope, skill system, scenery graphics, friendly CS staff,<br/>\nin-depth notes on any changes made<br/>\nEQ - Character/NPC graphics, interface, communications<br/>\n<br/>\nWish I worked for a game company ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  They fixed the Quarrel bug in the last patch ;)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Renee Cole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nat_ive@...\">nat_ive@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 13, 2000 10:12 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Digest Number 802<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Renee Cole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nat_ive@...\">nat_ive@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Archers aren&#39;t really all that over-powered.  I play a &quot;Ranger&quot; that I<br/>\n&gt; created.  He&#39;s specialized in archery & axe.  I find myself using the axe<br/>\n&gt; FAR more often in dungeons and the bow more often on the surface.  Archers<br/>\n&gt; are supposed to be powerful in open areas where they can peg you from 300<br/>\n&gt; yards.  Underground the tanks rule.<br/>\n&gt; ------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I played AC for 4 mos.  In that time, I got a Sho melee sword fighter with<br/>\n&gt; creature and item 4 to level 30.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Things I liked about AC:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Totally customizable characters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -The GM staff and Turbine are not paranoid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Camping is almost not an issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -You can get experience off of anything you kill, albeit less the higher<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; go if the critter is low level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -The death penalty doesnt hurt as much as EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -The ability to solo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Things I didn&#39;t like about AC:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -The interface<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -The chat system<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -The posing for combat (got my mage killed plenty).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -The graphics<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In addition, the game is becoming more crowded.  The higher in level you<br/>\ngo,<br/>\n&gt; the more difficult it becomes to find places to hunt that will give you<br/>\n&gt; decent experience. (sound familiar?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mages and archers are very powerful.  I&#39;ve had an archer 5 levels below me<br/>\n&gt; out kill me in dungeons using the quarrel bug, which has been in existence<br/>\n&gt; since beta.  They can&#39;t take the hits that a melee fighter can, so they<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; stand back and let you tank while they suck up the experience.  Since<br/>\n&gt; everyone who touches a monster gets experience from it, there is no &quot;kill<br/>\n&gt; stealing&quot; per se.  Your only recourse is to leave him to it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I decided to leave AC and return to EQ, my patriarch, our monarch<br/>\n&gt; (level 40 archer), and some other vassels in the allegiance all came with<br/>\n&gt; me.  So far, they like it better than AC.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t to say I totally hate AC, or that I don&#39;t see the problems EQ<br/>\n&gt; has, just, for me, EQ has more depth to it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I too, would like to see a nice hybrid of the best of the MORPG&#39;s I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; played. Done right, it could be an awesome game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Treehugger and Songmaker<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
