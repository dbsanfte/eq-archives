Galtin!!<br/>\nI have been playing Musiker the woodelf bard since day one Bertox was made (Even<br/>\nplayed in beta, so I dident fool much around with classes)<br/>\nHe is now 27th level and the only other char I have played above level 4 is a<br/>\nlevel 10 troll SK (on a bertox) and the ranger lvl 8 I started out with playing<br/>\non Fennin Ro, but living without Accelrando just isent worth it, hehe.<br/>\nI think your observations are true and would like to add that I also have had<br/>\ngreat fun doing the lambent quests. Sneaking into LGuk at 26th is hair raising,<br/>\nI just wished that the armor was no drop too. So everyone one would know that I<br/>\nhad gathered all the pieces myself.... I really dont understand why only the<br/>\ncomponents are no drop. Now that I only lack to get the gauntlets boots and<br/>\nhelmet (doubt I will be wearing that bird *g*), I have slowed down and is<br/>\nconcentrating on gaining some levels. More of these quests would be great as it<br/>\nis a good way for us casual players to get upgrades. I did the langeseax quest a<br/>\ncouple of times and got a LoW which I traded for a crystalline blade (dam11<br/>\ndel38 I think). I sold it to get money for the rubies to my lambent BP when I<br/>\nhad aquired all the other parts. Now Im using a Silvery axe and the good ole<br/>\ndragoon dirk. The morale is though - it is possible for the casual player to<br/>\nmake money  (still have 500+PP in bank) and get good items. You just have to be<br/>\nmore creative *g*. A good guild is also a way for players like us to get to the<br/>\nbetter equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways quests are fun when the reward is good, but there has to be some kind of<br/>\ncontrol with the rewards, I mean look at how the langeseax quest has degraded<br/>\nthe worth of a quite fine Warrior weapon. The quest was/is great fun to do, but<br/>\nI dont think people should be able to do it over and over again (Yes I have done<br/>\nthe quest 8 or 9 times which yelded 2 LoW&#39;s).<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum &lt;The Guardians of the Divine Light&gt;, WEL bard of the 27th<br/>\nsong, Bertoxxoulus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fran6.com/Divine_Light/\">http://www.fran6.com/Divine_Light/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 10<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 28 Dec 1999 09:45:34 -1000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Do I ever have a chance at making high level?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with everything Crier said.  One thing I would like to add is a<br/>\ncomment on obtaining good items.  Like the original poster, I don&#39;t get to<br/>\nplay that often.  My bard is my only character and I&#39;ve been playing him<br/>\nsince April.  When I do play, I only get to play for a couple hours at a<br/>\ntime.  I&#39;m only 29th level, but I assume that what Crier said about high<br/>\nlevel mobs ripping you to shreds if you don&#39;t have good equipment is true.<br/>\nWith that out of the way...<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, players like me and the original poster are handicapped when it comes<br/>\nto obtaining the really good magic items.  In order to obtain those items,<br/>\nseveral factors come into play.  First off, if you want to get the items by<br/>\nyourself, you have to be able to camp the spawn long enough.  Many of the<br/>\nitems are rare drops so that could mean anywhere from a couple of hours<br/>\nduring one playing session (if you are extremely lucky) or several hours<br/>\nover multiple playing sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\n2d factor: IMO its a lot easier to camp the good magic item spawn sites when<br/>\nyou are in a well balanced group of players who all know how to work<br/>\ntogether effectively.  This is difficult for the casual gamer because most<br/>\nof the friends he makes in game usually end up surpassing him in levels.<br/>\nEnd result is that casual gamers tend to join pickup groups most of the<br/>\ntime.  In my experience, I die more often in these types of groups because<br/>\neveryone seems to have their own agenda.   There is a side bonus to this<br/>\nhowever.  Because you are usually camping with new players all the time, you<br/>\ndo have the benefit of continually making new friends, which is always a<br/>\ngood thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n3d factor:  The people who are able to acquire good items are usually not<br/>\ninclined to sell them, preferring trades instead.  This hampers the casual<br/>\ngamer assuming factors #1 and #2 come into play.  This hasn&#39;t hampered me<br/>\ntoo much in my mid 20s because all my money I have earned since 25th level<br/>\nas gone to acquiring gems for the lambent armor.  Once I get all my lambent<br/>\npieces, I want to upgrade my weapons.  I&#39;m still using a dragoon dirk and<br/>\nthulian claws.  I haven&#39;t seen anyone selling weapons better than those in a<br/>\nlong time.  Lot of people willing to trade them for items of equal power<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lambent quests are perfect for the casual gamer.  These quests allow us<br/>\nto get good items at our own pace.  If Verant would only put in more quests<br/>\nfor mid to high level weapons and other non-class armor equipment I would be<br/>\na happy camper.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line is even though IMO casual gamers get the short end of the stick<br/>\nwhen it comes to getting good items, I still have fun playing.  Like others<br/>\nhave said its not a race to get to 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
