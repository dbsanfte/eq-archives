Anyone have suggestions of places I<br/>\ncan solo successfully at 25th level?  At 23d level, I couldn&#39;t solo rooks in<br/>\nSK.  I think I might be able to do it now.   This assumption is based on<br/>\nbetter combat skills/hit points plus I now have the Psalm of Warmth.  Is it<br/>\nsafe to assume that weaving Psalm of Warmth with two other songs will do<br/>\nmore damage than a Bellow?  How much do mobs get burned for per hit?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
