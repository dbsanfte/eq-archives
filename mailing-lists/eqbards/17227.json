Our STR tends to not be on<br/>\npar with a real tank&#39;s, because of the other stats we have to be conscious<br/>\nof, but the higher a bard&#39;s STR, the harder we&#39;ll hit with a given weapon.<br/>\nAre you referring to a different STR bonus?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe critical hits are nice, but I tend to consider them as procs.  The<br/>\nCrippling Blow is nice, but my understanding is that Warriors need to be<br/>\nbelow a certain Health threshold for this to kick in, which they usually<br/>\nwon&#39;t stay at (if they&#39;re that low, a healer is gonna be healing them).  Is<br/>\nthat understanding incorrect?  And yes, I&#39;ll concur that monks and rogues<br/>\nare just badasses (I consider them to be the melee version of a nuker).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The fact that we get Dual Wield and that other hybrids get Dual<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wield/Double Attack (plus Kick, Bash,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Slam, whatever) means that they ALL do significantly more damage than we<br/>\n </span></blockquote>do.  And don&#39;t even begin to talk<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;about the three pure melee classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kick/Bash/Slam contributes even less than a bellow every third twist would,<br/>\nfrom what I&#39;ve seen, when speaking of outright damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I logged some fights between level 43 and 45 just to get a feel for things,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and I estimated that Bards do<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;about 50% of the melee damage that other hybrids do, and about 25% of the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>melee damage of the three pure<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;melee characters.  That was including my dual Ykesha procs.  Btw, using<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;similar weapons&quot; is not really a<br/>\n<br/>\n50% of a ranger&#39;s damage is not insignificant in my mind, considering he<br/>\ngets double attack.  Again, though, you used the magic word &quot;estimated.&quot;<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for numbers (if you still have the logs around) -- I want to<br/>\nknow that X class at level L does Y damage per second against a mob of level<br/>\nZ, gathered from N fights.  I&#39;m stubborn/anal that way ;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;good measure; weapon selection is part of the ability to do damage, and the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fact that weapons are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;class-limited gives advantages to classes with good class-specific weapons.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, Bards don&#39;t GET<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;any...  The amount that a Bard contributes to melee shrinks drastically as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>he and his groupmates go up in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good point on the weapons.  (Except for rangers, of course... they&#39;re<br/>\ntypically dual wielding Ykeshas and EBW&#39;s just like us, until they get their<br/>\nplanes weapons.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;PS - Given that Verant&#39;s design intent re: Bards was to make a class that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>significantly augmented groups,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and that they balance this by making them weak soloers, one would like to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>think that Bards would be one of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the first classes that a large (4-6) group would look for.  We&#39;re way down<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on any list that I&#39;ve seen.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What does that tell you?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I often hear shouts in Guk and Sol to the effect of &quot;Enchanter or<br/>\nBard wanted.&quot;  I get invites often for dragon raids, planes raids, and Kedge<br/>\nouttings.  Of course, it&#39;s usually because they want one of the Clarity<br/>\nforms or to break a room.  Also, there are more bards coming of age these<br/>\ndays, and a group generally won&#39;t have more than one bard (unlike tanks or<br/>\ncasters).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, the new Chant upgrades should make life a bit easier for the<br/>\nkiting-solo bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
