A Stun.  This would be awesome...but most likely broken since we need no<br/>\nmana.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  this one is a little bizarre..dunno if they can do it...a group Damage<br/>\nShield that has a 2ndary effect (example: a Lightning-based Damage shield<br/>\n[shield of static? &lt;grin&gt;] that does X damage and the attacker has to save or<br/>\nbe stunned for 3 sec or something.)<br/>\n<br/>\n...i am big on the idea of a stun...<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Bards need a party buff that directly adds to attack (ala grim aura, fire<br/>\nfists)  .  Probably would do other stuff too...dunno how to present that as a<br/>\nviable idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  we&#39;re missing the 39 song?  How about a self-only vampiric regeneration<br/>\nsong...where heal like 10% of the damage we do( in melee).  dunno what the<br/>\nefficiency would have to be to make the song useable...John(tm)?<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Really bizarre...a flute based song...that summons a pet (preferably a<br/>\ngiant rat) that should be a reasonable power level (like the shaman pet...12+<br/>\nlevels behind shaman)  You could balance this by: making the song have to be<br/>\nrunning continuous, with a 5 min repop on the button.  Or, have it drain mana<br/>\n(like the shaman spell frenzy) and die when bard is at 0 mana.<br/>\n...i was shooting for a pied piper type thing here.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  I want an upgraded AE mez...with a built in DOT. &lt;Grin&gt;  It drops the dot,<br/>\nand then they have to make their Mez save...ok this one is stupid...but it<br/>\nsounded good before my morning coffee.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaleid<br/>\n23rd song Half elf bard<br/>\nGlyphed Aegiss<br/>\n27th level Dark Elf Magician and slayer of Travis Two Tone<br/>\n(up to apprehensive in mistmoore...if i remember correctly)<br/>\n&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. In reference to the mage-pet-root thread, we practically have 3 pets...the<br/>\nair pet is horrendously awful.  No earth pet is the rule when there is a<br/>\nneccesity for snare.  This does become complicated if the pet is the primary<br/>\ntank...because the earth pet has 1.5X the hit points of the water pet and<br/>\nprobably 2.5X the fire pet.   But the general rule is to not use earth in<br/>\ndungeons at all, or when snare is being cast...any magician should follow this<br/>\nrule...the earth pet is the &quot;soloing&quot; pet basically.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>\nadultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>\n-- Jon Stewart<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
