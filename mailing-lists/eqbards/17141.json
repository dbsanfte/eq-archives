If you&#39;re not doing anything to taunt the mob (ie, debuffing,<br/>\n&gt; healing its opponents, etc), it&#39;s going to be based purely on the amount of<br/>\n&gt; damage you are doing and your proximity.  Hence, if Player A is doing just<br/>\n&gt; 5% more damage than Player B, with proximity being equal, and nothing<br/>\n&gt; factored in except damage, the mob is going to focus on Player A.

You have to get in there and parse the<br/>\ndata to figure out average damage/time.  Then there will be no<br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
