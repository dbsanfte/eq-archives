My cleric mate<br/>\nand I set death records and lost level records til some higher level friends<br/>\nof ours set us down in Garton&#39;s tower in MM and force feed us exp til we got<br/>\nout of that range. We all started going to Kedge Keep about then too, no one<br/>\nwas there so it was really cool to have bascially your own private dungeon.<br/>\nSpent from the high 30s to 50 in KK. I believe strongly this was the dungeon<br/>\nV has alluded to as having the best exp modifier in the game. It better, the<br/>\nloot completely sucks: just fish aned scales. Rare drops are exactly that in<br/>\nKK. I do have the sharkskin drum and maybe my luck is bad but we pulled that<br/>\nspawn routinely for most of the levels we spent in KK and we didn&#39;t get it<br/>\ntil things were starting to go green to us there. <br/>\nThe brakes really kick in on leveling above 50. It really goes slow. Right<br/>\nnow, we going to Howling Stones when we can find folks to go. That seems to<br/>\nmove the exp bar better than anything else we&#39;ve tried.<br/>\n<br/>\nLullaby I have used on the last 2 years mainly to crowd control extremely<br/>\ngreen stuff. I should put the screenshot I have of me and about 20 froggies<br/>\nin Upper Guk somewhere. I think our dispell song is completely random about<br/>\nwhich buff it takes off and thus I never use it. Clerics get upset if you<br/>\nstrip off your symbol accidently. Twilight is a great song! I use the &#39;come<br/>\nhither&#39; part of it as much as I use the mez portion!<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal, I&#39;ll give you an armor quest! You catch big Bril in a zone with a<br/>\nbank and I&#39;ll give you the 3 or 4 pieces of lambent I have in the bank, if<br/>\nyou want them. I think I have arms, legs, boots, and a bracer at least. It&#39;s<br/>\njust taking up space and I don&#39;t know anyone in my circle of friends nutty<br/>\nenough to start a bard anyway. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
