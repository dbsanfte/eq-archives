Granite, cauldrons, 2<br/>\ndiamondine earrings, Mistmoore shield, Sacrificial dagger, Nightshade wreath, 2<br/>\nCrested Spaulders, and more gypsy lutes and werewolf talons than we could use<br/>\n;P.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were headed back up to the bath to wait for Xicotl and I saw the Dhampyre on<br/>\ntracking, so we headed that way.  Oops, undead saw through invis, so we were at<br/>\nzone regrouping and then...he was trained to zone, and folks zoned out.  I<br/>\njumped in, killed him, looted, and.....Yay! a Hooded Black Cloak to call my<br/>\nown!  Felt good to get it myself :).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looked to me as if the drop rates were increased in Mistmoore; maybe we were<br/>\njust there a long time hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we finished we decided to wander over to that camp and try our luck.  My<br/>\nhusband Knight (54 paladin) started pulling the Teir&#39;Dal Elites, which were all<br/>\ngreen to us.  Good faction adjusts though, I remember Emerald Warriors was one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we pulled Priestess Llandra, who is blue to us both.  The two of us chased<br/>\nher all over Lesser Faydark with chains/fear.  The fight took at least 5<br/>\nminutes.  Man she has a lot of HP!  I wasn&#39;t sure if she was a quest mob or<br/>\nnot; I looked today and she is.  She dropped about 9 gold hehe.  Clerics of<br/>\nTunare was one faction that improved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n54 Bard of Jus Divinum<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
