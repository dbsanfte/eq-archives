I have been having some problems with folks on auto-follow and my Selos<br/>\ndrum.  With 2 PC&#39;s side-by-side, I see the follower getting &quot;lost&quot; and<br/>\nspinning in circles quite a bit at times.  So, I have taken to swapping in<br/>\nmy lute for long distance running with someone on auto-follow and that seems<br/>\nto help.   Also, I have problems with folks if I try to follow them and have<br/>\nselo&#39;s song with selo&#39;s drum going as they start running.  Typically, I say:<br/>\n&quot;You lead, I&#39;ll speed.&quot;  They do a quick 360 degree spin to look around, see<br/>\nthey wanna go 90 degrees left or right of the way they are facing and take<br/>\noff like a rocket.  They instantly vanish from my sight thus starting a<br/>\nsession of: &quot;Lost you!&quot;; &quot;What&#39;s your loc?&quot;; &quot;Did you move?&quot;; &quot;What&#39;s your<br/>\nloc now?&quot;; &quot;Stop moving, damnit. Gimme your loc now.&quot; So, maybe a &#39;slower&#39;<br/>\ndrum for group travel would be worth carrying around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Scott Malin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Thanos0000@...\">Thanos0000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 05, 2000 2:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Weekend update...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Anyhow, I screamed:<br/>\n&quot;KILL THIS NOW!!!!&quot; And a few short moments later, looted the Sharkskin<br/>\nDrum.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Wow, congrats!
