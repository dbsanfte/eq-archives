I was really hoping that the patch made special<br/>\ninstruments give a bonus to our songs.  Guess we can hope that something<br/>\ndidn&#39;t go right with the patch and that Verant will fix it.  One thing I<br/>\nwill test the next time I get the chance is the Carillon song with a Mino<br/>\nhorn against a mob that is KOS to me.  With a normal flute, you can&#39;t<br/>\nimprove your faction high enough to get out of the KOS range (according to<br/>\nthis list).  Maybe with a magical Mino horn, you can now raise KOS mobs to<br/>\ndubious or apprehensive.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKinda wish our instruments used 1HB skill instead of hand to hand.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever used a 1HB weapon before and need to work on that skill:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I think that&#39;s why they made our instruments magical.  They<br/>\n&gt; could make our punches magical via magical gloves, but having<br/>\n&gt; a non-magical instrument equipped overrode that.  So I think<br/>\n&gt; they fixed it by just making all our instruments magical, then<br/>\n&gt; made a big deal about it in the patch message.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
