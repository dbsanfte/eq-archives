It is too powerful an<br/>\nitem.  They have also mentioned that were going to look at tuning down those<br/>\nhigh velious mobs that require the BP.  I wish people would read the ENTIRE<br/>\npost and not just the parts that upset them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see why everyone is so mad about this change.  They put in an item<br/>\nthat ended up being more powerful then they expected, so they are tuning it<br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\nKinda takes the challenge out of the mob doesn&#39;t it?  Get a cleric in your<br/>\ngroup with the BP and one warrior can take any, and I mean ANY mob that does<br/>\nnot outright kill  the warrior in 30 seconds.  As longs as your cleric can<br/>\nclick fast enough.  Kinda ruins the game.  There is more to this game that<br/>\nthe ph4t l33t.  Otherwise it would be dead now.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, the way they were talking about nerfing it, still makes it a powerful<br/>\nitem.  The cleric could still completly heal the party in 3 minutes (no<br/>\nchange here from the original BP), after that the first person has 4.5<br/>\nminutes (or whatever they set as the buff time) before they can have the BP<br/>\nused on them, again.  Not bad, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, flame all you want.  I don&#39;t care, I support the change.  It&#39;s good<br/>\nfor the game as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 05, 2001 2:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Changes on Test for all Classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Well honestly, the nerfs to Donals are NOT justified, in my opinion,<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; they have stated that many of the Velious mobs were designed with those<br/>\nBPs<br/>\n&gt; in mind.  They hit for ungodly amounts and quickly and have insane amouts<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; HP themselves like 200k.  If they downscale these mobs then maybe I would<br/>\n&gt; support the nerf but if not, well the increase in CR time alone will begin<br/>\n&gt; to make the game unpalatable to me.  But then I&#39;m in a bad mood today :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Halana/Tani<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.
