While sitting <br/>\ncalmly on the deck of the boat on my way to Faydwer, I suddenly found myself <br/>\nsitting on a rock in the middle of OOT surrounded by Sirens and Aqua-goblins <br/>\nwith the boat nowhere in sight. I have been stuck there for 2 days now. I <br/>\npetitioned immediately of course, but there were no GM&#39;s on then. I have <br/>\nlogged back in morning, afternoon, and evening but only once saw a GM log <br/>\non. They were on less than 5 minutes and logged off again without answering <br/>\nmy petition. I&#39;ve tried to catch the boat in passing, but don&#39;t stand a <br/>\nchance of catching it. I don&#39;t want to abandon my bard, my guild has <br/>\ninvested too much into helping me catch up with them in levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nZendarin<br/>\nThe Wandering Minstrel<br/>\nFrustrated on Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
