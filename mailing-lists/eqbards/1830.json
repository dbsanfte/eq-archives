As a whole this list is an informative<br/>\nand intelligent list about bards, not the sale of accounts.  I think we<br/>\nare all very well grounded in reality.  I myself have reached lvl 18 and<br/>\nthink that my grasp on reality is good enough (until I die 6 times in a<br/>\nrow to a SF in S Ro =). <br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin - Bard of Kelethin - 18th Rank - Karana<br/>\nAariel - Mage of Felwithe - 14th Circle - Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
