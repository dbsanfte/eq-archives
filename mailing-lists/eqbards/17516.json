I went over to<br/>\nsee about getting a Mask of Deception, only to find two 10th level<br/>\ncharacters ahead of me waiting.  I headed up to the spider room to fool<br/>\naround and maybe kill the Giant Heart Spider.  I was barely able to solo the<br/>\nGiant Heart Spider with weapons, then died to the two others in the room.<br/>\nWith instruments however, I was able to take on all three, kill them all and<br/>\nsurvive with a bubble of hp&#39;s left.  Having Hymn at full power is critical<br/>\nwhen facing poisoning mobs.  I was very surprised to be able to do it, but<br/>\nfigured while I was there I better experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
