It&#39;s<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; valid arguement for changing the way that group experience is shared.  It<br/>\n&gt; should be based on level, not on total xp gained.  The reason it was set<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; the way it is was that Verant felt, and I tend to agree with them, that<br/>\n&gt; friends would be grouping alot and would want to level at the same rate so<br/>\n&gt; they divided xp the way they did so that friends would level at around the<br/>\n&gt; same rate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This worked, but the problem is that most people do not, in fact, group<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; their &#39;friends&#39; regularly and thus groups of strangers are penalized for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; hybrid&#39;s experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately experience sharing is embedded deeply into the client and<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not sure if Verant is willing to totally re-write the game engine to fix<br/>\n&gt; something that was put in intentionally.  I&#39;m not sure I would expect them<br/>\n&gt; to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The hybrid penalty is a HUGE problem.  If it worked like it did in AD&D,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fine, that would be one thing.  The problem is not that a class is<br/>\nslower<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level, but rather that having a hybrid in your group makes the whole<br/>\ngroup<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level slower.  This unfairly penalizes your group members for what is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; supposed to be your penalty.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
