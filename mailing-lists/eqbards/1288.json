Now I am starting to get<br/>\nused to it, but what troubles me is the fact that every orc just loves to<br/>\ntarget me.  For instance I was watching a group fighting in the castle, I<br/>\nfigured well I can&#39;t kill any before someone steals the kill so I stood<br/>\nand watched.  Standing by the table in the throne room, I was suddenly<br/>\nattacked by 4 orcs in the throne room.  Now I wasn&#39;t fighting, nor was I<br/>\nseverely injur, but the orcs decided I was a bigger target than the rest<br/>\nof players actually attacking them.   So like usual I get mauled by a<br/>\nRoyal guard, 2 emmisaries and a Lego.  Now that wasn&#39;t too bad and I could<br/>\nhave gotten away until DVinn ran by and thought I was a better target than<br/>\nthe guy who was fighting him.  Now I ask why would a mob want to fight me<br/>\nover the person attacking it????  It makes no sense to me and the fact<br/>\nthat I am in no way a tank makes it way too difficult for me to stay<br/>\nalive.  Now I would either like the ability to fight better or for Verant<br/>\nto tone the aggro towards bards just a little.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW has anyone noticed a faction hit message whenever something dies<br/>\naround you??  I was hunting Gnolls in Highhold pass and was constantly<br/>\ngiven a faction hit message everytime something died.  This occurs whether<br/>\nI attacked it or not.  I was singing anthem or hymm at the times when this<br/>\noccured and none of my party members attacked anything at all.  What<br/>\ngives?<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin - Bard of Kelethin - Honour Guard - Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
