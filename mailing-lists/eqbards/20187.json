I just trust<br/>\nthat most people know when to give up and run :)  But I am normally the<br/>\nfirst in a group to say run.  If we have an SK or Shaman in the group I<br/>\ndon&#39;t tend to pull but if not the because of my speed I pull.  I tried<br/>\nfollowing a ranger around for a while with speed song but in the end I got<br/>\nbeat because I was always behind (autofollow)...<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have only ever had on conflict in a group.  This was around level 10 and<br/>\nour group of 6 was in CB.  Someone else had killed Crush and shouted he had<br/>\na tunic on him to loot.  I just sent a tell to the guy saying that the<br/>\ncorpse was unlootable at that time.  So he went over and looted the corpse<br/>\nand gave me the tunic - man was I just proud!  Then a guy in the group<br/>\nstarts to go off about how he wants to tunic too.  I just pointed out that<br/>\nthe tunic was given to me.  But he would not shut up.  So after a while of<br/>\ntalking about it he said he wanted the tunic for an alt and I said great I<br/>\nwanted the tunic for me ;)  Then he had to log... awwwww<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have yet to be in a group that was ever really camping anything so maybe<br/>\na lot of arguments have not come out of that yet.  In the groups I have been<br/>\nin most people don&#39;t seem to care to loot to start with.  And if they do<br/>\nit&#39;s basicly a Free for all - so long as autosplit is on.  From there if<br/>\nsomething it looted that you would like you just have to ask....<br/>\n<br/>\n  (I think I lost the plot of this)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can see in some of the more dangers places a strong leader would be a<br/>\nnecessity!  And that one person would be who everyone listens to.  But I am<br/>\nstill little in the scheme of things and have yet to find that area....<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jacana Mourningsong, Wood Elf Bard, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
