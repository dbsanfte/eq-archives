However, singing<br/>\ninvis isn&#39;t strictly necessary. there are few live mobs on the dead side,<br/>\nand in the case of most (bats, bugs) they see through invis anyway. As for<br/>\nthe invis song interacting with caster invis, this seems to change with the<br/>\nweek. Sometimes it works no problem in my group, sometimes it causes huge<br/>\nproblems. At this point, we seem to have given up on caster invis. Bard<br/>\ninvis is much easier...<br/>\n   a) it never drops at the wrong time (being refreshed every 6 seconds is a<br/>\ngood thing)<br/>\n   b) inherant see invis<br/>\n   c) forces party to go slow, so party sticks together<br/>\n   d) doesn&#39;t waste caster&#39;s mana or spell slot<br/>\n   e) takes 3 seconds to get the whole party invised, vs 6 casts of regular<br/>\ninvis.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) my experience has shown that you can have invis and invis to undead at<br/>\nthe same time, although the order is important. I think you need to cast<br/>\ninvis first, then invis to undead. However, this was about 20 levels ago, so<br/>\nthings may have changed recently.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Perhaps a Princess...
