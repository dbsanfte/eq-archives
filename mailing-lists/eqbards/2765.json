You purchase a Dragoon Dirk now for 40 plat, in a couple of months<br/>\n&gt;when you get tired of it you won&#39;t get much of a return because of players<br/>\n&gt;getting them and flooding the market.  This has already happened with Mino<br/>\n&gt;Axes - they used to sell for over 10pp a piece when I first started.  Now<br/>\n&gt;you can get them for 3 - 4pp.  Combines you can always sell back for about <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;20% loss, and can sell to another player for a little less than what you<br/>\n&gt;paid for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do not think the Dragoon Dirks will devalue as much as the mino axes did, <br/>\nsince they are lore items you can not lug 20 of em to Qeynos to sell :)    <br/>\nAlso I have always resold my combine weapons on Feydwer and for MORE then I <br/>\nbought them.  When people have whined about it I would point out that I am <br/>\nsaving them at least two hours of time round trip, plus they do not have to <br/>\njourney through very hostile territory (esp for combine blunt and piercing <br/>\nweapons).<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Brewer of Societus Argenti<br/>\nAmerginn - Test server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
