Some 30-35 level friends of mine were camping ogre bouncers<br/>\ninside Ogguk.  I asked them if that was a smart thing to do so they told me<br/>\nto come on inside, join in on the fun, and see for myself.  The party<br/>\nconsisted of a ranger, monk, shaman, two druids and me.  The ranger pulled<br/>\nogre bouncers one at a time to the Feerott zone border.  Every bouncer we<br/>\nfought conned red to me but we never had any problems taking them down.<br/>\nEven if we had run into trouble, the zone was just around the corner.  We<br/>\nhad little downtime and because we were constantly killing red mobs, the EXP<br/>\nbar moved noticeably (even in a hell level).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the kicker though.  Every bouncer we killed dropped a standard long<br/>\nsword and round shield.  These are regular store bought items.  Because they<br/>\nare regular store bought items, when you sell them to a merchant, you get<br/>\nmore PP for them than you do FS weapons.  I got 9PP for every long sword and<br/>\nI think 5PP for every shield.  There is a non aggressive ogre merchant right<br/>\nthere at the zone.  She wouldn&#39;t trade with me as a wood elf but when I<br/>\nactivated the DE illusion from the Mask of Deception she would.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\ntry singing the Carillon to improve faction as a wood elf so don&#39;t know if<br/>\nthat would have worked.  Anyway, I spent about an hour there before I went<br/>\nto Cazic and easily made over 75PP in no time at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had never ever considered adventuring in Ogguk before (figuring it was<br/>\nsuicide) but am now looking forward to trying it again.  I&#39;m relatively<br/>\nbroke from buying all the gems for my lambent armor so figure Ogguk will be<br/>\na great place to build up my cash reserves. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would pass this info along in case anyone wasn&#39;t aware of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci    <br/>\n30 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
