Their lich line<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;of spells convert hp to mana at a ratio approaching <br/>\n&gt;1:1 at level 49 (c.f. 3:1 for manastones), and their <br/>\n&gt;lifetap spells convert mana back to hp while damaging<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;the mob.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you have to incorporate downtime recovery<br/>\ndon&#39;t you?  I certainly think so.  IMO the most<br/>\nefficiency i&#39;ve ever seen over time is a constant<br/>\nstream of fighting without downtime (like 3-4 hours<br/>\nwithout any downtime. :)  Necro&#39;s do shine here. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;All fear does is increase your survival time - I <br/>\n&gt;*have* accounted for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fear lets dot&#39;s do full instead of 2/3 damage.  That&#39;s<br/>\npretty significantly more than survival time, that&#39;s<br/>\nincreased damage over time in addition to the reduced<br/>\ndamage taken over time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;No it isn&#39;t as clear cut.  But my main point is that <br/>\n&gt;being in a group cannot make the group *worse* than <br/>\n&gt;you are solo (stupidity excepted).  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup I agree here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Given that necros are great soloing, a group with a <br/>\n&gt;necro cannot be any worse than the necro is solo.  <br/>\n&gt;Since necros are regularly able to solo some of the <br/>\n&gt;toughest mobs in the game (outside of the planes), <br/>\n&gt;that means any group with a necro will be able to <br/>\n&gt;take on the toughest mobs in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree, a necro can still solo the ghoul lord room<br/>\nwith FD and pet where adding more people (unless they<br/>\nhad FD as well) would only hurt.  The above statement<br/>\nis true for most instances but not quite all.<br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
