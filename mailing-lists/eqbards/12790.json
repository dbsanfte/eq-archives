I don&#39;t think that<br/>\nthis conflicts with any ideals that Verant has as they&#39;ve already<br/>\nestablished precedents. They give you server statistics so you know how<br/>\ncrowded each server is, why not zones?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Verant really wanted to at least restrict usage of this, they could set<br/>\nup a &quot;board&quot; in each city that you go to (just like the message board). You<br/>\nclick on it and see a window that lists the number of people in each zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding &quot;omnipotence&quot; concerns, if Verant was worried about that, there<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be a &quot;who&quot; function to begin with. Regarding &quot;anonymity&quot;, someone<br/>\nwould have to search each zone in order to find the person. IMHO if Verant<br/>\nintended &quot;anon&quot; to really hide whether you&#39;re in a zone or not, they<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have anon people show up in a regular /who of the zone you&#39;re in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well, time to go a hunting!
