Thanks for all the great replies, fellow Bards! If I were to reply<br/>\n&gt; individually, I&#39;d surely fill up everyone&#39;s mailbox with a  lot of &quot;Thank<br/>\n&gt; you!&quot; Notes, so I will just say thanks to everyone in this one message!<br/>\n&gt; THANKS!!! Some more info, and then another interesting question follows...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some more info: The &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; was looted off one of the<br/>\n&gt; Gypsies slain in Mistmoor. I can not say which since I was not there to do<br/>\n&gt; the slaying (smile). A group of mid to low 30&#39;s took her, and the person<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; got the lute had travelled with me and msgd me to see if I wanted it. HECK<br/>\n&gt; YEA I wanted it, even if it DIDN&#39;T have any &quot;mystical powers&quot;. I still<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; Verant SHOULD make some magic instruments, or perhaps bardic weapons that<br/>\n&gt; count as instruments, or instruments that have better effects than<br/>\nstandard<br/>\n&gt; ones, but I digress.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I paid 15 plat for the Lute, and even if it is useless, I shall<br/>\nkeep<br/>\n&gt; it to add to my collections. (smile) I tested it some more with the<br/>\nHealing<br/>\n&gt; song and there&#39;s no difference in the numbers between it and a normal<br/>\nLute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, many thanks for the help finding Nostrolo the bard in S. Karana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, on to another question:<br/>\n&gt; I had a Paladin last night tell me after a battle to play the Jig O Vigor.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure why, since Stamina replenishes a heck of a lot faster than HP.<br/>\n&gt; And you know what he told me? The Jig O Vigor actually HELPS INCREASE THE<br/>\n&gt; RATE OF MANA RESTORATION!  I thought at first that this was bull, and over<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; few hours tried to test it with some mages. They all agreed that it did,<br/>\n&gt; indeed, help (however slightly) them restore mana!  Has anyone else tried<br/>\n&gt; this? Does everyone else KNOW about this already and I am just now leaving<br/>\n&gt; the stoneage? Any input??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you all for the great discussion!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tim<br/>\n&gt; Tallonn Stringfellow - Bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
