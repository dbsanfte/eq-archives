I am new to this list, but not a new bard nor a new player to Everquest.  I currently have a 31st level Bard on Innoruuk, Rosha.  I have been playing him since March 26th, just not in a hurry to level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, with the latest patch, I have noticed a problem with the level 31 song, the levitate one.  Now when I play it, it starts, I rise, I get the message I feel as if I am about to fall, followed by You are already floating.  This repeats for 2 cycles.  Immediately after the 3rd cycle of the song, I then fall to the ground, the icon disappears.  On the next cycle, it all repeats.  It does this even if twisting, so it seems to me that it now only allows continuos levitation for two song pulses.  I did just acquire this song, so I don&#39;t profess to be an expert, however, it did not function like this prior to the patch.  Just a word of caution using this song now, and be on the lookout for other changes!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRosha Crist</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
