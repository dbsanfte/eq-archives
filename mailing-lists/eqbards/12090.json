If you&#39;re at full health, it&#39;s<br/>\nlike the hp buff from Daring or Skin like Stone; except once<br/>\nyou drop below the buff effect, it goes away.  If you&#39;re<br/>\nsignificantly below full health, it&#39;s like a heal that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nshow up on your hp bar.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this means is that if you have to decide on one and only<br/>\none buff - a hp buff or heal spell or Rune - the others are<br/>\npreferable to the Rune line.  Of course, if you can have<br/>\nmultiple buffs, then Rune away to your heart&#39;s content.  It&#39;s<br/>\na very handy spell (since it can double as a last-ditch heal -<br/>\nsomething the Skin spells can&#39;t do), but don&#39;t let the<br/>\npsychological factor of &quot;Hey, I&#39;m not taking damage!&quot; fool you<br/>\ninto thinking it&#39;s better than the others.  You *are* taking<br/>\ndamage, you just can&#39;t see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
