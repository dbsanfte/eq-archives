I was wondering if it is the rare or the common drop and<br/>\n&gt; about how much it sells for.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s the booby drop from the ghoul lord.  Usually when you go to<br/>\n  fight the ghoul lord, you aren&#39;t after the helm.  So when it appears,<br/>\n  it&#39;s like:  Aww man, he dropped the friggin helm, that sucks.  So,<br/>\n  to answer the question, the SSB is the common drop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Last evening I was on my way out of North Freeport and just as I was about<br/>\n&gt; to zone I caught someone auctioning one for 400pp, so I went and grabbed it.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if this is a good price but I didn&#39;t care much because I was<br/>\n&gt; able to turn around and sell my medium steel helm for 333pp so I pretty much<br/>\n&gt; broke even on the deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I dunno even for a guess as to the price of these helmets.<br/>\n  For what it does I guess 400pp is reasonable.  Never seen <br/>\n  one sold however, nor traded.  I have given 2 away to guild<br/>\n  members, and I still have one in the bank.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the Crested Helm, <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Very rare drop, you&#39;ll probably see 10 spaulders before the helm.<br/>\n  This is a most sought after item, even by higher level people.<br/>\n  The Caitliff in MM drops this, but he is an uncommon spawn, with<br/>\n  a rare helm drop which equals hours and hours or camping unless<br/>\n  you get lucky on the first few shots.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the Crown of the Froglok Kings, and<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I heard of a L40 full group holding the tower on live side.<br/>\n  Anything less than that I think you&#39;d be asking for trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the Lambent Helm? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  of the two pieces for this, the opaline helm is carried on <br/>\n  deepwater goblins.  They are much harder than they look.<br/>\n  During Sylly&#39;s event last week, two deepwater goblins were<br/>\n  pulled and Sylly, A level 50 cleric, and myself were almost<br/>\n  slain.  Nasty critters.  Again, if you happened to loot a<br/>\n  helm on the first try when L50s were farting around pulling<br/>\n  the DWs, then you got lucky.  We killed 5 that night, and<br/>\n  saw no helm.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Which is easiest -&gt; hardest?  (minus the luck factor)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lambent, Crested, Froglok, in that order I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n  HARDEST:<br/>\n  Froglok requires you penetrate a fairly tough dungeon, and <br/>\n  engage in a fairly decent fight with the king and guards.<br/>\n<br/>\n  HARDER:<br/>\n  Crested helm, the Caitliff isn&#39;t hard, he&#39;s just hard to get<br/>\n  to drop the helm.<br/>\n<br/>\n  HARD:<br/>\n  Lambent helm, practice and patience.  No dungeons, easy zone<br/>\n  if things go wrong, most pieces acquirable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
