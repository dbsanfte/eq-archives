Within an hour of <br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; into EQ again, my guild gave me a small gift:  a red scale and a <br/>\nwhite<br/>\n&gt; scale.  So I managed to finish my Epic Saturday afternoon!  Getting <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; white scale last means you make three trade-ins in a row; pretty<br/>\n&gt; nervewracking if you ask me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I knew we had some red scales in our vault.  My guild leader traded <br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; Velious haste cloak for the white scale.  I have no idea where he <br/>\nfound<br/>\n&gt; one; I had assumed that every white scale on Innoruuk had been <br/>\nsucked up<br/>\n&gt; already.  He wasn&#39;t on to say.  I doubt it was from Gorenaire, <br/>\nsince the<br/>\n&gt; only guilds capable of killing Gorenaire have Bards who still need <br/>\nthem,<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;ve heard nothing about the Scalegiver dropping whites.  Maybe <br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; pickup Vox raid.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s very cool.  As a mostly melee Bard (blasphemy to some <br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; you, I know), this is a big improvement right across the board.  <br/>\nAnd I<br/>\n&gt; actually managed to raise Brass Instruments twice today singing a <br/>\nBrass<br/>\n&gt; song in combat!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3.5 blue bubbles in 5 hours in Sebilis.
