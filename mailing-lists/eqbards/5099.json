With the PSX, Sony owned the hardware, not<br/>\nthe software.  With EQ, Verant owns the hardware *and* the<br/>\nsoftware.  If all the companies making PSX games decided<br/>\nthey were going to code it so it wouldn&#39;t work with emulators,<br/>\nthere wouldn&#39;t be a whole lot you could (legally) do to stop<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me put it this way:  If the courts decide that you can<br/>\nlegally use the EQ graphics on the CD any way you want, do you<br/>\nthink any company would be stupid enough to invest the time<br/>\nand money creating art for an online game when they know their<br/>\ncompetitors could legally just rip it off to use in other<br/>\ngames?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
