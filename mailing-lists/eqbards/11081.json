The orc would only ding him for<br/>\n&gt;1-2 points every few hits.  He was healing at a normal 1 point<br/>\n&gt;every 6 seconds so he was effectively taking no damage.  He<br/>\n&gt;could barely hit the orc because it was red to him.  So the<br/>\n&gt;result was a stalemate as these two hacked at each other for<br/>\n&gt;almost 10 minutes.  He could&#39;ve breezed through L1-5 without<br/>\n&gt;any downtime if he&#39;d stuck with even-con mobs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
