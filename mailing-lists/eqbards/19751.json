I must be presenting myself in a way that makes me sound cowardly.<br/>\n&gt; But I&#39;m glad to know I&#39;m not the only one who thinks this is a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe.  It might seem cowardly to some.  To a bard, it&#39;s common sense since<br/>\nyou&#39;re the first one to die when things go bad. ;P<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how I try to start a group.  First, I don&#39;t suggest taking on easy<br/>\nthings to get started.  Even though it makes good sense, it&#39;s not very<br/>\ninspiring if your leader is a coward. ;P I just set things up so it ends up<br/>\nthat way for the first fight. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore the first battle, I make sure that everyone is full mana and full<br/>\nlife.  I suggest roles for each person in the group and get people&#39;s<br/>\nconsensus about who will do what (eg person to /assist in multi-mob fights,<br/>\nprimary damage absorption tank, puller, healer, nuker, who will keep up<br/>\nwhich buffs on whom, etc.)  I also usually briefly explain basic<br/>\ncommunication and mechanics (eg. INC, MR?, how to set up an /assist hotkey,<br/>\netc.) since most of the time, I&#39;ve grouped with newbies or people who don&#39;t<br/>\nhave much experience grouping and it always helps communication when<br/>\neveryone understands a common vocabulary of abbreviations. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first battle, I try to set things up so that the group is taking on<br/>\none yellow or maybe a few blues and I try to make sure there is very little<br/>\nrisk of anything else joining in. (eg if pulling from a camp, fight far away<br/>\nfrom the camp but not in the path of any wandering creatures.)  Taking on a<br/>\nfew blues or a yellow usually doesn&#39;t seem easy to most individuals -- when<br/>\nsolo, multiple blues or a yellow con is tough for most classes even though<br/>\nit should be easy for a fully working group. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the battle is over, I check on everyone&#39;s mana and health.  If<br/>\neveryone played well, everyone&#39;s health and mana should recover around the<br/>\nsame time and there will be little downtime.  Usually, that doesn&#39;t happen<br/>\nunless I&#39;m grouped with good players.  Normally, the group ends up waiting<br/>\nfor one person&#39;s health to recover while everyone else is uninjured or the<br/>\ngroup ends up waiting for a caster to recover their mana while everyone else<br/>\nis ready.  It&#39;s natural.  Casters often don&#39;t know how much damage a good<br/>\ntank can absorb so they overburn to finish a fight quickly, like when they<br/>\nsolo.  Also, some tanks don&#39;t know to back off and spread around the damage<br/>\nfiguring that they are a tank and should be taking all the damage, like when<br/>\nthey solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnalysing the first battle, I diplomatically suggest a different strategy<br/>\nfor anyone who is taking too much damage or burning too much mana and set up<br/>\nthe first battle scenario again (easy fight that still gives XP) until<br/>\neveryone is fairly well balanced.  This has the added advantage that I, as<br/>\nthe bard, don&#39;t die if the group sucks because we keep on taking easy fights<br/>\nover and over that still give some XP. ;)  Usually, within one or two<br/>\nbattles, the group is working well as a team and we start to take on tougher<br/>\nfights.  That&#39;s normally when I try to develop an escape plan for the group<br/>\nif things go bad but I often forget since we are normally having a lot of<br/>\nfun by then. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aanluil &lt;Imperturbable Fellowship&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You were looking for a last name, right?

I&#39;m terrible with names. :)  I guess it would be pronounced<br/>\nan-loo-il.  I was thinking of Lumiaria for a last name since it kinda flows<br/>\nwith the first name and sounds elvish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAanluil &lt;Imperturbable Fellowship&gt;<br/>\nBard of 20 mystical tunes<br/>\nErollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
