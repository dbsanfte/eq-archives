The song actually casts an aura of enchantment on<br/>\nyourself, attuned to a particular faction.  You choose a target to set that<br/>\nfaction, and there&#39;s a glow on them as the magic touches them, but they&#39;re<br/>\napparently not enchanted in any way and don&#39;t react negatively.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe higher the price the more you save, into the many platinum of savings.<br/>\nIt also helps to load up with as many charisma enhancing items as you can<br/>\nscrounge.  I now have a silk evening shirt and a cats-eye amulet as my<br/>\nshopping clothes and am watching out for appropriate earrings and other<br/>\nitems.  They all make a difference that&#39;s real easy to test.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
