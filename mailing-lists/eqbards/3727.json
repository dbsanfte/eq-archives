Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>\n&gt;good then.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You got some poor advice.  There is no magical road to money in trade<br/>\nskills.  There are a few trade skills where you can make a profit, but<br/>\nnormally require hundreds of plat and many hours to build up your skill<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\n[trade skill failures clipped]<br/>\n<br/>\nForget trade skills.  You are never going to get rich there.  You need to<br/>\nkill mobs with decent loot.  The two legged mobs almost always have better<br/>\nloot than the four legged ones.  Two great areas for your level are<br/>\nBlackburrow and Crushbone.  Since you are in Freeport, you might not want to<br/>\ntravel that far.  Instead there is Befallen and all the Derv camps in WC,<br/>\nNorth and South Ro.  You will get rusty weapons, and pieces of armor,<br/>\nsometimes even a bronze weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nCollect every single thing from the corpses to sell.  You may want to invest<br/>\nin some backpacks.  Once you are way overloaded, sell everything.  It is<br/>\nimportant to find a merchant that will give you a good price.  With Selos,<br/>\nyou can run a bit farther for better prices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter an hour or so, you will will have your bp&#39;s full of junk.  It will all<br/>\nsell for about 1-3gp.  But if you have 20 items, that can come out to 3-6pp.<br/>\nSometimes you will get lucky and find a bronze weapon that sells for 1-3pp.<br/>\nPlay for 3-4 hours and you can earn near 20pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Frankly, it looks like Verant wants lower level folks to be dependent on<br/>\n&gt;handouts from higher level folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How can you possibly believe that?  My bard never got a handout.  At level<br/>\n13 I have full banded, a Combine LS, and 10pp in the bank.  For all of us<br/>\nwho started from day one, we had no one to give us handouts.  Don&#39;t insult<br/>\nus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I find it rather sad that I can barely<br/>\n&gt;get necessities on my own each level up to level 10 and now that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;level 11, I really need banded to survive and I can&#39;t afford it, nor does<br/>\n&gt;it look like I will ever afford it soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I assume that you did waste some of your money learning all the trade<br/>\nskills.  That is a hole you will have to work out of.  But with hard work,<br/>\nyou can overcome this.  Just concentrate on getting one piece of banded at a<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
