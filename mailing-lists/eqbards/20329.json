And, I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; imagine another item I&#39;d rather get, so I&#39;d be pretty pissed off if<br/>\n&gt; it wasn&#39;t the necklace on him, heh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, if you&#39;ve seen The Kly and have not looted the necklace, then<br/>\n&gt; chances are it&#39;s been moved.  If you have only seen The Kly Overseer,<br/>\n&gt; then you haven&#39;t done enuf time. :)  We&#39;ve killed over 160 Overseers<br/>\n&gt; and have seen 6 The Klys, including a stretch of 16 hours or so<br/>\n&gt; without any at all and 2 The Klys back to back.  (Of course this is<br/>\n&gt; mostly 4 - 6 hour camps stretched over several days.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please let me know if you have seen &quot;The Kly&quot; and he did not drop the<br/>\n&gt; Necklace as I was intending to go back very soon.  The trade offers I<br/>\n&gt; get for the necklace are just too great to pass up and my neck spot<br/>\n&gt; is now open.  So far, I&#39;ve gotten 1) GE Boots and Impskin Gloves, 2)<br/>\n&gt; Froglock Bonecaster&#39;s Robe, 3) Arbitor&#39;s Combine Longsword, Runed<br/>\n&gt; Lava Pendant, Slime Coated Harpoon, 4) Cobalt Gaunts and Rothyl&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Channeling Crystal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\n&gt; Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not a huge milestone anymore, but one for me, nonetheless....
