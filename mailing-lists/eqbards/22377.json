It was usually only where high resistances were<br/>\nneeded, like Kithicor.  I was around level 29 or 30 at the time so I wasn&#39;t<br/>\na battery.  It was set up like this:<br/>\nSlot 1: Anthem<br/>\nSlot 2: Elemental Rythms<br/>\nSlot 3: Primary hand<br/>\nSlot 4: Secondary hand<br/>\nSlot 5: Inventory slot<br/>\nSlot 6: Inventory slot<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on how fast you get you can do it like this:  While moving the<br/>\nprimary weapon out of the primary slot start up your instrument song, drop<br/>\nthe primary weapon on the drum in the inventory then drop the drum on the<br/>\nsecondary weapon.  Keep the secondary weapon in your cursor, don&#39;t put it<br/>\nin the inventory.  Once it pulses start another song and swap the secondary<br/>\nweapon and the instrument, drop the instrument on the primary weapon and<br/>\nequip it.  Once you get good at this you can try taking out one of the<br/>\ninventory slots in the hot bank and replace it with a third song.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Steve<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:23 AM 11/13/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Ok, so I hit 35 (yeah!) and am fighting with a monk alt whose main is a bard<br/>\n&gt;(an awesome one at that) and he&#39;s giving me hints here and there... &quot;less<br/>\n&gt;talking more twisting!&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Anyway, he tells me that I should be not only running three to four songs<br/>\n&gt;but also switching out weapons and instruments while doing this.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Do you all actually do this? I tried this and its HELLA hard!  So my<br/>\n&gt;question is.. do you all actually do this and if so HOW.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;I have #1 bank set up with 2 melee slots and 4 inventory slots, and #2 bank<br/>\n&gt;set up with 6 songs... I just can&#39;t seem to hit a song, switch to #1, switch<br/>\n&gt;out weapons for instrument in time to hit #2 and do a new song without<br/>\n&gt;missing a beat.  Am I doing something wrong or is this one of those things<br/>\n&gt;that just takes practice?  And yes, I&#39;m using shift+1 to switch hotkey<br/>\n&gt;banks...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Tani, 35th Bard<br/>\n&gt;Halana, 57th Shaman<br/>\n&gt;Paradigm<br/>\n&gt;Solusek Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
