Hybrid casting is such a tiny<br/>\nfraction of their overall balance that adjusting upwards has an<br/>\ninsignificant effect on their overall power level.  Basically they are<br/>\nadmitting that hybrid spells are pretty much just fluff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nIts typical Verant-speak.  They answer questions like a presidential<br/>\ncandidate, don&#39;t accept blame, make vague promises, and try not to offend<br/>\nanyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could mobs possibly be balanced both before and after a significant<br/>\nchange?<br/>\n<br/>\nIts like when they gave hybrids all that extra mana.  How possibly could<br/>\nhybrids been balanced on both sides of a significant upgrade?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt never ceases to amaze me that a company that A) makes this much money, B)<br/>\nis very dependent on good relations with its customers has never bothered to<br/>\nhire a competent PR person.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
