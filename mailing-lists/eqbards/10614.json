Then ALL my songs were resisted, he interrupted all of<br/>\n&gt;my spells, and chained me when I tried to run.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;We went back with 5 tanks and this time the thing charmed our lead<br/>\n&gt;tank, sang some horrible AE song, and made all the warriors nod off!<br/>\n&gt;then when we thought we had him, he teleported away, with us losing<br/>\n&gt;health to the AE song the whole time. Still we just about had him when<br/>\n&gt;he let out some Dirge, and POOF killed 4 of the tanks&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Uldar Ulfangson<br/>\n&gt;Level 31(yay) bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 25<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Wed, 24 Nov 1999 11:56:43 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: Chris Musson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...\">oblivious_the_mighty_confused@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Bards as NPCs to fight<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It seems a reasonably obvious assumption that the reason why there are <br/>\n&gt;no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; froglok bards etc.  or any bards other than in guildhalls or mail <br/>\n&gt;delivery is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that there is NO combat AI for NPC bards.  they are treated as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Warrior/rogue/monk with our poor melee skills.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my (slapped together) justifications for this:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.  When charmed, we Punch, or melee with whatever we have equipped.  I <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not seen or heard of a bard play a single song while charmed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.  the Mail delivery bards just stand there and punch when they are <br/>\n&gt;attacked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
