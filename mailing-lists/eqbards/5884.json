In an earlier post last week,<br/>\nJohn (30+ bard) stated that in Unrest festering hags sometimes conned<br/>\nindifferent to him while invis.  I know for a fact festering hags can see me<br/>\n(22 bard) when I sing Invis (one nuked me for over 350HPs:-).  That leads me<br/>\nto believe that the level of the mob compared to your level has an impact if<br/>\nthey can see through the song (at least in Unrest).  Caveat: its possible<br/>\nthe hag that attacked me cast See Invis before she attacked me but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink its safe for me to test that theory at this stage of my career.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; That&#39;s not how it works.
