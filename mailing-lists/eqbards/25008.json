Others may disagree...heh.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGeForce 3 is the newest and best out there.  If your budget is a bit<br/>\nsmaller, check out the GeForce 2 line.  Buyer beware!  Some of the &quot;bargain&quot;<br/>\ncard manufacturers creatively label their cards such as they&#39;re not<br/>\nuntruthful, per se, but you could end up with a slightly different card than<br/>\nyou thought you were getting, the difference usually being a slightly<br/>\ndifferent clock speed.  Do your homework, read some reviews, pick a<br/>\nparticular model, and don&#39;t look back.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought a GeForce256 DDR a little less than a year ago.  It&#39;s still a<br/>\nsuperb card, I haven&#39;t found a game yet that&#39;s too much for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cook Miller-ETOP03 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:etop03@...\">etop03@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 1:27 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] OT - Equipment question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not directly related to<br/>\nbarding.  Bards do provide a lot of input into what is seen in game<br/>\ngraphically, so this can be an important topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 16 MB AGP<br/>\ngraphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a better<br/>\ngraphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram -<br/>\ndone.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards<br/>\nthey use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything else<br/>\nof note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and some<br/>\nplaces in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t scrape me<br/>\noff on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all the help,<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger 42 bard<br/>\nRobiinton Masterrhealer 32 cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
