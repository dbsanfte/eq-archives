Badly. Basically there is a web page with a form<br/>\n(no I&#39;m not going to link it here, but I&#39;ve seen it) that allows you to<br/>\nlogin as anyone and read/write/delete their email. Be afraid. And if you&#39;ve<br/>\ngot a message to yourself with like your VISA number in it, I&#39;d think twice<br/>\nabout it ;) &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was independently confirmed by a friend of mine who is also a Network<br/>\nadmin.  I&#39;ve been to one of the &quot;sites&quot; and it appears that the hack has<br/>\nbeen removed/blocked.<br/>\nCurrently, Hotmail is not responding, so my guess is that Microsoft finally<br/>\ngot wise and shut it down.  In any case, be aware, and I guess if you&#39;re on<br/>\nHotmail, you&#39;re probably not reading this anyway (or if you are, then it&#39;s<br/>\nfixed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Service,<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nAssistant Moderator<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Micro = small, Soft = limp&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
