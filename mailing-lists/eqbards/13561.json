At later levels having grown up in Sol B and Lower Guk from 35-45<br/>\nyou get into sort of a mindset of pull-kill, pull-kill, pull-kill.  Higher<br/>\nlevel players sometimes don&#39;t use their imaginations about things to do!<br/>\nHere are some suggestions of interesting things for high levels to do for<br/>\nexperience:<br/>\n<br/>\nKedge Keep.  I&#39;m not sure if 50s get great exp there, but 40-48s sure do.<br/>\nDefinitely a fun place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOcean Of Tears.  The Seafury Cyclops in OOT that give exp to 50s and spawn<br/>\nas fast as Moss Snakes.  There&#39;s the Allizewsaur, a level 50 &quot;dinosaur&quot;<br/>\nroaming an island there.  He spawns pretty quickly and is pretty tough to<br/>\ntake down - so hard in fact a level 50 necro with a pet actually uses more<br/>\nthan half mana to do it.  Now THAT&#39;S tough.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGuards in Neriak, Oggok and Grobb.  Heck for that matter if you don&#39;t care<br/>\nabout faction there are guards everywhere.  You want a thrill?  Go set up<br/>\ncamp down deep inside the town of Oggok and pull Bouncers.  It&#39;s fun and<br/>\nchallenging.  Heck Harmonic hit 50 killing Bouncers.  Invis your way into<br/>\nNeriak&#39;s Third Gate and pull gaurds.  Makes you feel like a kid again!<br/>\n<br/>\nCastle Mistmoore.  There are mobs in there that give experience to 50s.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrownie Guards in Lesser Fay.  They were red to me last time I saw &#39;em at<br/>\n41.  I&#39;d be pretty surprised if 50s didn&#39;t get exp there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaw has been tweaked again to be just slightly easier.  Do 45-50s get exp<br/>\nthere?  Little to none probably, but good 40-45 I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, don&#39;t forget some of the other places.  I too get into a mindset of<br/>\n&quot;damn, solb packed.  I&#39;ll run to lguk and check it out.&quot;  But there are<br/>\nother things to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n[44 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: workplane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know but believe me what do you low levels need a change of<br/>\n&gt; pace? You have<br/>\n&gt; multiple dungeons. I don&#39;t care for a change of pace all I want is to be<br/>\n&gt; less crowded and they can change that with more zones. You guys<br/>\n&gt; have so many<br/>\n&gt; options of zone that it&#39;s not even funny but lets say for 46+ we<br/>\n&gt; have the 3<br/>\n&gt; planes now and sol b and guk. But wait there are people 30+ in guk and sol<br/>\n&gt; b. So all we really have is 3 zones. Now for 30ish people you<br/>\n&gt; have a variety<br/>\n&gt; of outdoor zones, for dungeons you have permafrost, CT, Unrest, MM, Sol A,<br/>\n&gt; Guk, Lower Guk, Sol B. See the problem? I play a mid level char a 50 char<br/>\n&gt; and a low level char and there are no problems with the low or mid levle<br/>\n&gt; chars. High level chars there is a problem though. It&#39;s not like were<br/>\n&gt; complaining we need a change of pace we want something new for the hell of<br/>\n&gt; it we don&#39;t but you are. Seriously what problems do you have at mid or low<br/>\n&gt; levels? Not many high levels are plagued with overcrowded. Hell I love the<br/>\n&gt; lower guk zone and I&#39;d be happy if they just duplicated the zone<br/>\n&gt; a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; times. Seriously though how about you list me a couple of problems you low<br/>\n&gt; mid levels have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
