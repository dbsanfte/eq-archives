I do not understand how a lvl 24 bard not know the<br/>\nusefullness of playing multisongs.  Last night I was group with a bard and 4<br/>\nother plp.  This bard is a lvl 24.  She will play Bellow while fighting only<br/>\nthen Hymn after battle.  I asked her that she know that we can play 3 song<br/>\nat a time right and she said yeah and that was it.  When I started playing<br/>\nmy Anthem, Psalm, and healing during battle the group was so impress.  They<br/>\nwere like wow you can play 3 songs at a time?  I was like yes.  I told them<br/>\nthat if they ever group with a bard expect at least 2 songs at a time.<br/>\nThere is no excuse not to play more than 1 song.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\nChampions of Norrath, The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
