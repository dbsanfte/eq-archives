I don&#39;t think they believe that their PvP environment will be<br/>\nperfect, but they think it will be good.  I like the concept behind it and<br/>\ngenerally I abhor PvP because it is all about PK for the most part.  Two<br/>\nthings they are doing will make a huge difference.  Like the Team PvP<br/>\nservers, only races openly at war can PvP one another without consequence.<br/>\nThe big difference is, there will not be a way to tell the difference<br/>\nbetween PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s on sight.  If you see an Orc on the road ahead and<br/>\nyou are an elf, you know that he is dangerous to you, whether he is a player<br/>\nor an npc.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir consequence system is brutal against PK&#39;ers.  If you kill a race that<br/>\nyou are not at war with, even a mere 5 or 6 times you will suffer enormous<br/>\nproblems.  These problems will include having npc bounty-hunters showing up<br/>\nto kill you at random.  Playing a PK character would rapidly become<br/>\nunplayable as every time you logged in you were ambush by these npc<br/>\nenforcers.  Even if you kept your PK-ing to a race yours was at war with,<br/>\nyou would always find yourself in enemy territory where few would feel any<br/>\ncompunction against killing you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t really interested much in Horizons initailly due to it&#39;s PvP<br/>\nsystem, but they have convinced me to give it a chance.  They feel their PvP<br/>\nsystem will promote the &#39;risk game&#39; like Player competition while severely<br/>\npunishing to the point of oblivion anyone who PK&#39;s for the joy of hurting<br/>\nothers.  Time will tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
