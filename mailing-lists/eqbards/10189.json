I have read previously on this list<br/>\nthat our song does stack with an Enchanter&#39;s Clarity spell.  Does anyone<br/>\nhave hard number with what percentage increase there is?  Is it in fact<br/>\nEnchanter Clarity + Bard Clarity?  The one thing that I&#39;ve been told that I<br/>\nhad no previous knowledge of is that Bard Clarity stacks with Bard Clarity.<br/>\nIs this so?  If so, is it Bard Clarity + Bard Clarity, or a lesser<br/>\npercentage of increase.  What about three or more bards in a group, etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\nEverQuest - Pretend it&#39;s a game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
