We have determined for the most part<br/>\nthat internet bandwidth is not necessarily the main factor involved in EQ&#39;s<br/>\nspeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the EQ graphics are all stored on your local Hard Disk, another factor<br/>\nis your hard drive size.  You never want to have your Hard Drive completely<br/>\nfull, after it is about 60 or 70% full you will begin to notice performance<br/>\ndegradation because the disk head has to travel all over the surface of the<br/>\nwhole drive to access data, this slows things down significantly and you<br/>\nwould mainly notice it in slow zoning times.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could sacrifice the CPU upgrade in lieu of another 60megs of RAM, this<br/>\nwould probably help you significantly.  ALL windows OS&#39;s run terrible with<br/>\n64 megs of RAM, you will be incredibly suprised at the performance increase<br/>\nof your machine with 128megs of RAM.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince EQ is purely a 3D driven game, you would do good to upgrade your video<br/>\ncard, if by &quot;16&quot; you mean it is a 16 meg card, then you should think about<br/>\nmoving to a 32 meg card.  Problem with this is that I think most of the new<br/>\n32 meg video cards these days are AGP bus cards which require a capable<br/>\nmotherboard that I suspect you do not have based on your explanation of your<br/>\ncurrent configuration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in summary, I would put this priority on your upgrade considerations:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. 128MB RAM (primary importance)<br/>\n2. Faster CPU (go as far as you can afford)<br/>\n3. Faster Motherboard (100+MHz frontside bus - this choice may also affect<br/>\nCPU choice above)<br/>\n4. 32meg AGP video card (depends on if you upgrade the motherboard above)<br/>\n5. Swap that winmodem out for a good 3COM modem with internal processing<br/>\n(low priority)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could spend probably from $100-$1000 on this depending on how far down<br/>\nthrough the list you go.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Webber, Jessica [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WebberJ@...\">WebberJ@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 12, 1999 9:41 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Hardware question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WebberJ@...\">WebberJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Question for anyone here who can successfully stack 3 or 4 <br/>\n&gt; songs in crowded<br/>\n&gt; zones:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are you using for hardware? (processor, ram, video ram, free<br/>\n&gt; DASD/virtual mem - whichever is smaller, modem, typical connect speed,<br/>\n&gt; anything else I may be forgetting)  I know I could use a bit <br/>\n&gt; of a hardware<br/>\n&gt; upgrade, just wondering how little I can get away with. Also, <br/>\n&gt; what in-game<br/>\n&gt; sacrifices have you made in the options to be able to <br/>\n&gt; weave/mix/twist so<br/>\n&gt; successfully?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; FYI I&#39;m using P200 MMX, 64ram, 16 video, 100 mg free all allocated to<br/>\n&gt; virtual memory, 64 winmodem that usually connects at 44.  I <br/>\n&gt; forgot to write<br/>\n&gt; down my option settings, but I know I&#39;ve got single layer sky & sound<br/>\n&gt; realism all the way up.  The rest I&#39;d have to check when I get home.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Note: this is not to restart a debate on modems or anything <br/>\n&gt; else.  Please<br/>\n&gt; think of it as a survey & don&#39;t pounce on anyone who handles the game<br/>\n&gt; differently from you.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance to any who help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Evulia of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Kingbird of Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  home to the world&#39;s liveliest email communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
