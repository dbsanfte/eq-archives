We have heard snippets of &quot;we<br/>\nwere shocked that players got level 50 in xx days played...&quot; makes me think<br/>\nthat they (Verant) are concerned with &#39;how hard&#39; it is to make levels, etc.<br/>\nLike why have hell levels? If they want to have some kind of milestone, it<br/>\nshould be a positive re-enforcement - not a negative.  If they want to<br/>\nretain players, that is. More than half of my friends who I started this<br/>\ngame with have pretty much ended their EQ careers because it got to be just<br/>\ntoo hard (and too boring) to make progress.  In short, it was no fun any<br/>\nmore.  A few others have made level 50 - the level of nothing to do. And so<br/>\nthey re-start chars in other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are 2 scenarios:<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ-X: hard to play.  Serious players make lev 50. It takes you 6 months of<br/>\nconcentrated playing. You start a couple twinks and play them to upper 20&#39;s<br/>\nand a new game comes out somewhere else that is more fun than then next 10<br/>\nlevels killing aviaks. So you semi-retire your 50 and maybe do occasional<br/>\ndragons.  But then you get sick of all the guild email about stuff you don&#39;t<br/>\ncare for and you quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ-Z: fun to play.  Still quite a challenge but acceptable to the people who<br/>\nwant to play 2 or 3  hours at a session and still do pretty good.  So they<br/>\nmake level 50 in 5 months.  And then start a new char of a different class<br/>\nor try a char on a Race War team or PvP server.  Things are challenging but<br/>\nstill fun - not frustration.  So they get this next char to 50 in 3 months.<br/>\nAnd then they decide to start another char and see if they can do it without<br/>\ntwinking and do some role playing. Now they are good for another couple<br/>\nmonths.<br/>\n<br/>\nRetention rate of your customer base is gonna depend on the fun factor - and<br/>\nthat will be the &#39;absolute&#39; of all absolutes.  This is after all the<br/>\nentertainment business.  When it&#39;s no longer entertaining, you are out of<br/>\nbusiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, December 13, 1999 1:07 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Re:Re: Guise of the Deceiver<br/>\n(Longish)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe problem with adding/removing things purely on the basis<br/>\nof<br/>\n\t\t&quot;fun&quot; is that for the most part, it looks at only the<br/>\nrelative<br/>\n\t\tside of things (will the players be happier after the change<br/>\n\t\tthan before?).  Unfortunately, the prisoner&#39;s dilemma and<br/>\n\t\ttragedy of the commons are very real, and thus create<br/>\n\t\tsituations where stuff that makes the players unhappy can be<br/>\n\t\tbetter for the game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
