[Sylia Windlehands] in Kelethin stole my last one.<br/>\n&gt; Aloro: &lt;looking nervously around&gt; You mean the bard guildmistress there?<br/>\n&gt; The one who trained me in the fundamentals of music?<br/>\n&gt; Wethyl:<br/>\n&gt; Aloro: What do you want from Sylia Windlehands?<br/>\n&gt; Wethyl: Slay her and bring me the pick she carries.
