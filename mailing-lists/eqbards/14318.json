I actually work with 4 of them :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that I can never get him to hotkey a &#39;I&#39;m gonna mez, stop<br/>\nsinging!&quot; button.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe button he has is, &quot;I have mezzed, don&#39;t wake them up!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a WEE bit too late...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, with enough browbeating over lunch, I&#39;ll prevail!  I hope...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a guild, btw, called Bitter Strength, that only includes our<br/>\ncharacters...Say Hi if you&#39;re ever on Sol Ro :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n know I should remake the thread but... I DON&#39;T WANNA.. I feel better now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are serious Golias the simplest and best answer really is to talk to the<br/>\nenchanter about it, after all your going to draw most of the attention anway.<br/>\nHowever if you really don&#39;t feel like talking about it and just want to do it<br/>\nadjust your song list to take out DDD and do something like CD,Psalm (heat or<br/>\ncold),Hymn.  Ask the Enchanter to mez after the line of wince messages.  So far<br/>\nthat&#39;s been the only way I&#39;ve been able to do it.  If there is an enchanter I<br/>\nusually either join the melee or use instruments to buff and heal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
