The mask of deception, my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understanding is that this rots a lot on most servers. I also see a<br/>\n&gt; lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lower level bards with one. When I have 19th level invis song is it<br/>\n&gt; possible<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get to the Assissin room (provided it&#39;s camped) and wait<br/>\n&gt; patiently and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; politly for one to drop?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The level 19 invis song will only get you dead, fast, on the way to<br/>\n&gt; the Assassin room.  Almost every frog you&#39;ll see will be undead.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not tough to get to the Assassin room, but you will need invis<br/>\n&gt; to undead.  Unless, of course, lguk is super camped.  On my server,<br/>\n&gt; PreKunark you could walk anywhere you wanted on dead side lguk,<br/>\n&gt; without fear of getting attacked - population averaged 90 - 100 most<br/>\n&gt; nights.  Now it&#39;s more like 65 - 75 and the frog&#39;s life expectancies<br/>\n&gt; have climbed. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, I had read conflicting reports that the invis song worked against the<br/>\nundead.
