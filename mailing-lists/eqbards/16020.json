I think they did a good job and MAYBE<br/>\nneed to move another 200.  In my opinion, its not that the server is crowded<br/>\n- on Solusek Ro now, other than Sunday afternoon, we are consistently in the<br/>\ntop third of the least crowded, non PvP servers.  The problem, in my<br/>\nopinion, is that we have too many high level players.  After the &quot;split&quot; I<br/>\ncan now log in to a 1200 person server (well within reasonable expectations)<br/>\nbut the population of lower guk is still close to 100, sol b 70 and the<br/>\nplanes 30-50.  I think perhaps John was right that we need to learn how to<br/>\npull from the planes in order to support more people - that would help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as for Verant giving us more servers in order to keep population at<br/>\nunder 1000, frankly, I don&#39;t see it happening.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the whole server split makes me sad.  I lost a lot of good friends<br/>\neven moving 200 people.  I suppose that&#39;s the way it goes<br/>\nthough................<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Perhaps a Princess...

It was a nice gesture. They need to remove a LOT<br/>\nmore people before you can consider it a split.
