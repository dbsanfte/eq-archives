Our invis song<br/>\n&gt; works against undead of just about all but see invis types<br/>\n&gt; and the ones in Lower guk. That is not a need for invis to<br/>\n&gt; undead but a fix for the Lguk zone.. Or a clarification as<br/>\n&gt; to what they are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have tested with those who have invis to undead and<br/>\n&gt; standard invis..

Whether or not<br/>\nyour invis on a type of mob seems to depend on your level.  I<br/>\nsuspect our invis is really (invis) + (invis to undead - 10<br/>\nlevels) or something like that.  Clerics and paladins could<br/>\ncast invis to undead to roam inside Unrest rather early on,<br/>\nwhich my song didnt&#39; become effective until the low 20s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is the case, then our invis does not work in LGuk by<br/>\ndesign.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
