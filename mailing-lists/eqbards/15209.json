At 47 I got 7 hp/tick without a lute<br/>\n(6 hp/tick after subtracting natural regen rate), and 13<br/>\nhp/tick with a lute (12 hp/tick after subtracting natural<br/>\nregen rate).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe spell shield is there, albeit minor.  Bellow yourself and<br/>\nsee how much damage you take (unfortunately, you don&#39;t seem to<br/>\nget the &quot;hit by X points non-melee damage&quot; message when you<br/>\nBellow yourself).  It reduced the damage I took by about 15<br/>\nwith a lute equipped; tough to tell since it was mixed with<br/>\nthe client updates.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It does not stack with any of our damage shield songs, but it does stack<br/>\n&gt; with VoV and CoB so now you can give 55 STR 30 AGI 15 DEX 8 HP Regen Attack<br/>\n&gt; Speedup and a small rune when twisting during battle at level 50, not bad at<br/>\n&gt; all!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The test I did with the Allizesaur (involving over an hour of<br/>\nweapon swings, about 30 minutes for each case) found no<br/>\ndifference between 87 str and 161 str.

Before, I was a<br/>\nbit disappointed that druids were about as good a healer over<br/>\ntime as we were, and they could do it with just a single cast.  <br/>\nNow we can easily outperform their healing over time.  Also,<br/>\nit was getting annoying having to sing Hymn for almost two<br/>\nminutes to fill up a single bubble on a buffed tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe healing aspect of this song makes it a winner not just for<br/>\nus, but for all the other players as it&#39;ll help cut down on<br/>\ndowntime some more.  If there is some method to Verant&#39;s<br/>\nmadness, it seems to be towards nerfing our enchanter-like<br/>\nabilities, and making downtime reduction our specialty.  <br/>\nUnfortunately, that would seem to be a rather boring job...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
