Then I started <br/>\nremeniscing (sp?) about back when I was a kid in 5th grade lookin through <br/>\nthe school library and I came across some mythology books (Greek, Norse, <br/>\netc). This is when I first started getting into fantasy literature.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell - I noticed that EQ doesn&#39;t have any satyrs (half-man, half goat) like <br/>\nthe greek god(?) Pan. I remembered the story about him seducing maidens with <br/>\nhis pan pipes/flute (whatever you want to call them), and thought it would <br/>\nbe neat if Verant were to add this to the game. Maybe a rare mob in Lesser <br/>\nFay or out on the Karanas. If you could kill him and get his pipes, you <br/>\ncould they would be useable as a wind instrument and give you +50 CHA! Just <br/>\nkidding, a charisma bonus would be reasonable though for pixie strike and <br/>\nsuch.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 50th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
