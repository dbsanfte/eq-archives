Therefore I am joining pickup groups and dieing more than I<br/>\nprobably would if I had a regular group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it annoying that we don&#39;t get bind affinity, mainly because we are<br/>\nthe weakest of all melee classes, however we are one of the bes classes at<br/>\nagro&#39;ing mobs onto us, I think Verant should consider either giving bards<br/>\nbind affinity OR, give us a song that allows us to Feing Death, monks are<br/>\nvery similar to bards, being weak (lack of AC & hp&#39;s), and they deal a hell<br/>\nof a lotta dmg, so they tend to take alot of dmg, however they can just<br/>\nfeign death and they are fine, I rarely see a monk has been killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant say that having melee&#39;ers bound outside a dungeon is unfair because<br/>\nthey can just get killed and zone back in and join in on the fight again,<br/>\nthis is not the case with bards, we have to mem songs (as we all know this<br/>\ntakes a good 5 minutes). And how are we gonna be any good unless we pick up<br/>\nALL of our equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it an insult that when fighting in Cazic, Guk or the Sol&#39;s I have to<br/>\nrun all the way from Freeport or Arena just to get back to my corpse,<br/>\naswell as mem my songs and loose an hours worth of hard earned exp. To be<br/>\nhonest it is starting to **** me off and as I die about 5 times (at least)<br/>\nevery level this is wasting my valuable playing time, hence the reason I<br/>\nhave now started up a cleric, it&#39;s great, I get bind, gate etc and if I do<br/>\ndie, I&#39;ll only have to spend 20 seconds memming my spells. + at later<br/>\nlevels I&#39;ll be able to res myself  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy playing my bard and have got to level 33 through alot of hard work,<br/>\nI have great equipment for my level and am VERY keen to get to level 40+<br/>\nbut I jus can&#39;t see it happening, I don&#39;t know how you level 40+ bards on<br/>\nthis list do it.  I spoke to a level 50 bard on my server (Tegamen, I<br/>\nthink), he was wearing some imbrued and had some great equipment. So I<br/>\nasked him if he had any tips on how to level fast, he replied &quot;Don&#39;t die&quot; I<br/>\nsaid that I find it very hard not to die, he replied &quot;Trust me, Bards got<br/>\nthe bad deal&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess thats sums it all up then, I am still determined to reach level 50,<br/>\nit&#39;ll just take me a few years  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan Songweaver, Bard of 33 Songs &lt;Lords of Chaos&gt;<br/>\nMeklon, Level 7 Cleric of Innurok &lt;Lords of chaos&gt;<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I agree.
