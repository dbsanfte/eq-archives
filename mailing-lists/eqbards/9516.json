It&#39;s pure greed, plain and simple.<br/>\nThis always happens in games of this nature : High level players abusing<br/>\ntheir powers.  I wish there were effective and sensible ways of keeping<br/>\ncertain level ranges away from each other.  Like an island for characters 1<br/>\n- 15, then a two hour boat ride to the next island (16 - 30), etc, etc.  It<br/>\nwould definitely go a long way to restoring some sense of balance to the<br/>\neconomy and keep incidents like Kitasi described from happening (but it<br/>\nwould probably create a whole new slew of problems as well).<br/>\n<br/>\nBlindly rambling...<br/>\nDesmei Sightblinder<br/>\nLvl 30 Bard [Povar]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
