There is a minor faction hit<br/>\nassociated with killing Krazen but I have seen<br/>\npeople camp for a week without becoming KOS. <br/>\nHe is VERY easy to take down and drops lots of<br/>\nplatinum so now that pottery is nerfed, Krazen is the<br/>\nnewest get rich quick scheme. (Although people have<br/>\nbeen killing him for quite a long, its the<br/>\nformer potters joining the sadists that has created<br/>\nthe mess) I wish Verant would do something about it<br/>\nbecause it has gotten out of hand.
