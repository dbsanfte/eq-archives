Here&#39;s a quote I just got off <br/>\nEverlore about today&#39;s patch...  OK, granted it&#39;s not just a nerf to us, but <br/>\nall the &quot;battle bards&quot; will definitely be affected by it...  Now watch as <br/>\nthey make it so that ONLY bards using haste songs and FBSS&#39;s will fight <br/>\nSLOWER...<br/>\n<br/>\nAbashi:<br/>\nIn any case, I doubt that it will be as valuable after tomorrow. We found a <br/>\nbug with the way &quot;haste&quot; items stack with &quot;haste&quot; spells. Basically, even <br/>\nthe worst haste item combined with the worst haste spell would put the <br/>\nwearer at the haste cap. This basically invalidated the better haste items <br/>\nand spells, and explains why people have been saying that the newer haste <br/>\nitems aren&#39;t any better than the FBSS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is being fixed in tomorrow&#39;s patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOlgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 45 Missed Notes<br/>\nE&#39;ci<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
