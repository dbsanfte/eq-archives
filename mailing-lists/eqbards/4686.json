In Halas, the banker is in some<br/>\nsort of tavern, and a lot of people like to sell to the<br/>\nmerchant there.  The mail delivery quest guy is behind the<br/>\ncounter there so I usually end up selling to the merchant from<br/>\nbehind the counter.  I tried Carillion once and got no<br/>\nmessage.  Hmm, odd.  I moved to the side a bit.  Still no<br/>\nmessage.  After moving around some more, I figured out that<br/>\nthe area the merchant is standing in is slightly recessed.  <br/>\nIf you are not standing in the recessed area, that is you are<br/>\nstanding one step up, you are at a sufficiently different<br/>\nZ-axis level that you cannot cast on nor talk to the merchant!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s even more wonderful is that we have this restriction in<br/>\ncombat, whereas mobs do not.  If you&#39;re fighting on a slope,<br/>\nyou have to stand *very* close to the mob to be able to hit<br/>\nit, while the mob can hit you fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
