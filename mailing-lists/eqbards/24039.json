(Which must mean you have a shaman and an<br/>\nenchanter, at least from my experience), merely play clarity and melee.  You<br/>\nwill add (30%?, I forgot the percentage) to all the caster&#39;s power, and<br/>\nprovide some melee damage.  That is a near worst case scenario (IE that is<br/>\nthe bard baseline of power, you should never dip below that), and in that<br/>\ncase you are more than holding up your 16.5% (1/6) of the group&#39;s power.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow often are you in an ideal party?<br/>\nHow often does no one go LD or AFK in an entire session?  (Chances are you<br/>\ncan fill in for them)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd this to our ability to solo (which is a component of the net power of a<br/>\nclass, since there are times you won&#39;t have a group), and I think bards at<br/>\nleast balanced power wise, probably slightly over powered. (I consider it my<br/>\nreward for having a hard class to play).<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd this to our importance on big raids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd this to our travel abilities (Best non caster travelers clearly, I&#39;d say<br/>\n3rd best traveler overall)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my guild was folding (been a member since I was 16), I got 4 offers to<br/>\n&quot;Come see what our guild is like.&quot; in the first day.  One from a person who<br/>\nnew me directly, the other 3 from guild leaders who were merely told I was a<br/>\n50 bard who knew how to play. (I&#39;m not some super bard, my equipment sucks<br/>\nand I still have tons to learn, trying to point out how valued bards are).<br/>\nThis is partly a function of the rarity of bards, but obviously we are<br/>\nvalued...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
