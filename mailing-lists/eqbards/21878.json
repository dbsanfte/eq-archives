We said in beta, why do we strum a stick? they<br/>\n&gt;said, it&#39;s beta we&#39;ll fix it. Release, we still strum a stick, they say we<br/>\n&gt;forgot to do the drum. Drum gets likened to the barb shield thing, it&#39;s too<br/>\n&gt;big, maybe we can fix it later. Something like a year later, new lands (and<br/>\n&gt;all that modeling) still a stick. Nostrolo&#39;s tamborine gets turned into a<br/>\n&gt;tamborine instead of a stick, all drums are still sticks. Give me odds the<br/>\n&gt;next addition and the chance to recitfy the drum thing and avoid the large<br/>\n&gt;d/l (cited as a main drawback to fixing) still won&#39;t have a drum. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;played a bard for 2 years as of next month, and that seems like a damn long<br/>\n&gt;time for something to be outstanding. It says they either don&#39;t care or they<br/>\n&gt;are simply unable to deal with the volume of problems they have. Granted I<br/>\n&gt;am a perfectionist, and spent 15 years in Nuclear Maintenance to make it<br/>\n&gt;worse. We tracked outstanding issues based on severity AND the length of<br/>\n&gt;time the issue was outstanding. The NRC is very interested in cycle times.<br/>\n&gt;The point was long cycle times says the management of the facility was<br/>\n&gt;lacking in commitment and efficiency, and would get a plant on the Watch<br/>\n&gt;list as fast as a real incident. Gaming is not nuclear power of course, but<br/>\n&gt;the same indicators apply to any industry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;........<br/>\n&gt;Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (one bubble on 53)<br/>\n&gt;Excalibur, Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
