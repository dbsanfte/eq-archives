If you are good at it, you can have three songs in effect<br/>\nat one time.  Is this considered an exploit?  I don&#39;t think so because if it<br/>\nwas you probably would have heard something official about it from Verant a<br/>\nlong time ago.  Also, I don&#39;t think it should be an exploit for the<br/>\nfollowing reason.  Lets say I am in a combat and I am singing the Chords of<br/>\nDissonance.  Halfway through the battle I decide to switch to the Hymn of<br/>\nRestoration because I have taken a lot of hits.  I start singing the Hymn<br/>\nand soon both the Chords and the Hymn are in effect.  I am doing nothing<br/>\nwrong at this point because I am just the game exactly as it was designed to<br/>\nbe played.  No way can anyone say I should wait until the effect of the<br/>\nChords completely dissipate before I start singing the Hymn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question I have is this:  Is the ability to twist multiple songs<br/>\nsomething that Verant has programmed into the game on purpose? Or, is the<br/>\neffect of twisting a potential byproduct of lag?    <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nBard of the 6th Circle<br/>\nE&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tDavid Rubino [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tigger@...\">tigger@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tFriday, April 23, 1999 10:26 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] Re: Bard Songs<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: David Rubino &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tigger@...\">tigger@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Simple answer . . . you can&#39;t sing more than one at a time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To figure out why, trying singing Happy Birthday and Three Blind Mice at<br/>\n&gt; the same time to your friends and family.
