Out of my group, only the<br/>\nenchanter and I were left, me at a bubble and half and she at<br/>\na bubble.  There were about a dozen people still alive, maybe<br/>\na half dozen of them melee so I joined in the melee attack.  <br/>\nThen the priest of Nagafen respawned (this was our 4th<br/>\nattempt) and attacked me.  I quickly got knocked to *NO* red<br/>\nshowing on my hp bar.  I figured the middle of Vox&#39;s lair<br/>\nwould not make for good corpse recovery so I walked away to<br/>\nfind nice place to die.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason the priest stopped attacking me.  I found<br/>\nmyself next to the enchanter (at a half bubble now) so I<br/>\nswitched to healing both of us to give her a better chance of<br/>\nbeing able to gate out.  I got myself up to a bubble, her to a<br/>\nbubble and half, took another Vox AE breath attack, dropped to<br/>\nhalf bubble, and walked further out of range.  The priest<br/>\nattacked me again, so I took a couple swipes (I think I<br/>\npunched that time :), dropped to *NO* red showing again,<br/>\nturned and walked away so I&#39;d die outside of Vox&#39;s lair, and<br/>\nthe priest left me again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found the enchanter again, healed both of us a bit.  I was<br/>\nexpecting to get summoned at any moment but for some reason it<br/>\nnever happened.  A couple of the returning casters brought<br/>\nsome goblins and giants, so I went to pull those off them.  <br/>\nLost the enchanter at this point (she fell into a pit and<br/>\nended up gating out).  I was still expecting to be summoned so<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t trying to engage the giant and goblins, just pull<br/>\nthem off the others so they&#39;d have time to run/gate/whatever.  <br/>\nSo every new goblin that came in I&#39;d rush to attack, which<br/>\nslowly led me to the king room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know what to do.  Like Crier, I had never considered<br/>\nthe possibility of me living while everyone else died.  I<br/>\nfigured Vox was impossible in our current state, especially<br/>\nwith the priest there (remember, living was completely new to<br/>\nme so it didn&#39;t occur to me until later that all these casters<br/>\nwere coming in full mana :).  I kept attacking goblins that<br/>\nwere being pulled in, which brought me to the flag room.  <br/>\nThere, someone with a giant on them ran past me (I was walking<br/>\nthe entire time :), and the giant latched on to me.  So I<br/>\nshouted &quot;giant to zone&quot; and walk/jumped to the zone.  Somehow<br/>\nI made it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we started off fighting Vox alone, but ended up fighting a<br/>\nbunch of other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, bards make pretty good tanks with 2260 hp.  Don&#39;t think <br/>\nI could&#39;ve tanked Vox alone though.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
