As I can&#39;t tell a<br/>\nsignificant difference in the amount I get missed between 100 and 130 I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth giving up AC for agility beyond that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
