However some smiths of the<br/>\n&gt; gigantic races have<br/>\n&gt; fashioned Tuning Forks, far too unwieldy as a weapon<br/>\n&gt; by anyone but bards,<br/>\n&gt; whom by some divine ability can swing the things<br/>\n&gt; with the skill only a<br/>\n&gt; musician can wield.   Foreign by the way it is<br/>\n&gt; weighted so heavily in the<br/>\n&gt; bottom area, near the fist, ordinary practioner&#39;s of<br/>\n&gt; bashing skill find it<br/>\n&gt; crude and ackward.  However, in the hands of a bard,<br/>\n&gt; innate musical<br/>\n&gt; abilities give these individuals the power to swing<br/>\n&gt; it as a weapon, each<br/>\n&gt; strike an ominously deadly chrous of a truly<br/>\n&gt; deafening melody.<br/>\n&gt;        (:::The item has a high damage value, for the<br/>\n&gt; weapon is only valuable<br/>\n&gt; as a &quot;last ditch&quot; weapon, the inherent spell effect<br/>\n&gt; of the weapon a<br/>\n&gt; detriment in everyday hunting, most bards still<br/>\n&gt; relying on dual wield or<br/>\n&gt; instruments:::)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unicorn Horn Scimitar<br/>\n&gt; Uses 1H Slash (using resource Glowing Unicorn Horn,<br/>\n&gt; only gives L Lightstone<br/>\n&gt; light)<br/>\n&gt; 6 27<br/>\n&gt; WT: 1.4<br/>\n&gt; Unicorn Horn<br/>\n&gt; Race: Any<br/>\n&gt; Class: Brd, Pal, Ran, War<br/>\n&gt; Magic: Casts a Greater Lightstone glow, combat Hymn<br/>\n&gt; of Restoration<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only made from a smith with the average ability to<br/>\n&gt; create banded, using the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Glowing Unicorn Horn&quot; and sufficient ore to fashion<br/>\n&gt; a handle.

The soul<br/>\n&gt; of the unicorn itself can come from glowing yet<br/>\n&gt; still living horn, the<br/>\n&gt; weapon virtually weightless (but for the smith&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; handle) and depending on<br/>\n&gt; the wielder&#39;s Charisma, there is a random chance for<br/>\n&gt; Hymn of Restoration at<br/>\n&gt; the level 14 Bard equivelent upon each swing of the<br/>\n&gt; weapon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dark Horn<br/>\n&gt; Piercing (Using resource Dark Unicorn Horn, 15 Wt)<br/>\n&gt; 7 29<br/>\n&gt; WT: 8<br/>\n&gt; Unicorn Horn<br/>\n&gt; Race: Any<br/>\n&gt; Class: Brd, Thv, Shd, War<br/>\n&gt; Magic: +60 Hide, +40 Sneak<br/>\n&gt; Unusually heavy in one&#39;s hand, with straps of thick,<br/>\n&gt; polished leather to<br/>\n&gt; give it grip, the thing actually makes a sphere of<br/>\n&gt; darkness around itself.<br/>\n&gt; Created weapon by a tailor of the reinforced<br/>\n&gt; ability, along with sufficient<br/>\n&gt; hides and a Dark Unicorn Horn.
