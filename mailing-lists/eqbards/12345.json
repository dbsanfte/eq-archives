Every time I only<br/>\nlost about a half bubble.  I certainly never lost a full bubble.  Never once<br/>\ndid I drop to having more then a little over a bubble to go.  I finally just<br/>\ndecided to ignore the XP bar all together and went to my tried and true<br/>\ncomfortable home of Sol A and just camped the Efreeti and EXG to get a<br/>\ncharred guardian shield and platinum armband for my brother&#39;s druid.  I<br/>\ndinged in no time after that :-).  God that last bubble took forever... I<br/>\nnever want to do that again.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 35th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 04, 2000 10:27 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Question about experience penalty (OT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I concur with your findings - hell levels tend to insulate you from death<br/>\n&gt; penalties and getting killed by a red is less xp loss than dying to a blue<br/>\n&gt; or green.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FWIW:  got sucked into a Paladin&#39;s quest last nite.  Go to Erud&#39;s Crossing<br/>\n&gt; and kill some damn fish. Ok, quest fishie hangs out with Killer Shark&#39;s -<br/>\n&gt; ugh.  Playing a just 27 wiz, I killed the Plague Shark by chain casting my<br/>\n&gt; big nuke but agro&#39;d the Killer who snarfed me.  Got snarfed 2 times and<br/>\nlost<br/>\n&gt; a half of a bub and then some (lost my level too.)  P.o.&#39;d, I camped him<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; get Sylly (40 bardette) and brought her over for CR and what have you.<br/>\n&gt; Somehow she managed to get killed too but thankfully showed _very_ minimal<br/>\n&gt; XP loss.  This is due I do believe to both being in a Hell level _and_ by<br/>\n&gt; getting killed by a red (I was told Killer Sharks are 45 mobs - and if<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; are how come the Planes players don&#39;t camp em for rebuilding xp? Ya, ya<br/>\n&gt; fighting underwater is hard.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, while it&#39;s hard to gain XP in a Hell Level - it seems that each time<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; are killed - there is less loss than in other levels.  FYI - I have heard<br/>\n&gt; that the Hell plus One levels are one-bub death penaltys for each time you<br/>\n&gt; die - maybe only 46?  Or 41 and 46?  I don&#39;t remember 31 nor 36 to be<br/>\n&gt; particularily bard - well, 31 was cuz I wanted 32 so badly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 03, 2000 1:27 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Question about experience penalty<br/>\n&gt; (OT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; dying is higher when something kills you that cons<br/>\n&gt; green/blue to you versus<br/>\n&gt; something killing you that cons yellow/red.
