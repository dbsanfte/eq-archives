(I apologize<br/>\n&gt;     if these have been asked before) BTW, this is by far the most<br/>\n&gt;     interesting and mature Everquest list that I have seen so far.  Must<br/>\n&gt;     say something about the type of person that enjoys playing a bard.<br/>\n&gt;     (join the EQ_clerics list for a bit and you&#39;ll see what I mean...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area<br/>\n&gt;     effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a step<br/>\n&gt;     by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group<br/>\n&gt;     of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     2.  Did anyone else notice how quiet it was last night on the<br/>\n&gt;     Everquest servers?  They only had about 60%  of their normal<br/>\n&gt;     population.  Guess there is a strong correlation between playing<br/>\n&gt;     Everquest and being a Star Wars fan...   :smiles knowingly.<br/>\n&gt;     I expect that the next few days may be a good time to grab some<br/>\n&gt;     experience at those place that always seem to be over camped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     3.  I am a Level 10 human Bard.  I usually party with an Enchanter<br/>\n </span></blockquote>FINISH!!!! Arrrrgghh, you need to tell me where you&#39;ve been hunting. I am<br/>\n16th level and JUST started upgrading to banded yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nRolande, drunken angry poor Bard of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
