The range is<br/>\nmuch too small and while it lasts longer than most songs you can twist, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to risk it. Keep it incase someone misses a timer and<br/>\nstarts to drown, you can get it going fast enough to save them since there&#39;s<br/>\nlittle chance someone will be able to cast enduring breath on them fast<br/>\nenough.<br/>\n<br/>\nStamina is a major problem in kedge since it goes down and doesn&#39;t come back<br/>\nup unless you get hit with Invigor so the stamina song should be cycled in<br/>\nthere during a battle for a few zaps. Lancers on the top level hit very hard<br/>\nfor their level, a decent group should be able to handle single pulls at<br/>\n30th level. My ranger did lancers from 35-42 but I only risked them solo at<br/>\n38th level (it&#39;s possible at 35 but I didn&#39;t want to risk it.). My necro<br/>\ncan&#39;t quite manage it at 30th level although a Mage can solo with their 29th<br/>\nlevel earth pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatching the spawns move about is key, it&#39;s not rough to single pull there.<br/>\nThere is a high level PH on the top level, it can be a Piercer (35ish),<br/>\nImpaler (40-42), or the Fierce Impaler (42-43, drops Gloomwater or Darksea).<br/>\nPulling around the high level fish isn&#39;t tough, lull shouldn&#39;t be needed<br/>\nalthough it might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the sharkskin drum ... only seen that mob once and it didn&#39;t have the<br/>\ndrum. It&#39;s kind of deep, very much a 45+ area of that zone. I love kedge and<br/>\ncan&#39;t wait till I&#39;m going into Unrest to steal people from the basement camp<br/>\nto go swimming with my bard.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
