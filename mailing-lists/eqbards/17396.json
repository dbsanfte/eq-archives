I do lurk though :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a problem with system lock ups while playing EQ.  I have a new <br/>\nGateway P3 800 (coppermine), 256 ram, Geforce 256 DDR (by creative), <br/>\nSBLive!, and a cable modem.  I get a system lock up for no apparent reason.  <br/>\nI can be just waiting for a boat at the docks....LOCKS up.  I have <br/>\ndownloaded the latest drivers and and reinstalled Direct X 7, and this fixed <br/>\na funny sound problem (the one where everything sounds ok only when <br/>\nsitting).  I do get flashes of lines or boxes on the screen.  Even just <br/>\nstanding with no songs going.  The game plays ok with these flashes (if you <br/>\ncall that ok).  I have changed all the resolutions in the game control box, <br/>\nI have turned on and off all the effects, and nothing seems to matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is disappointing to upgrade to a rig that should run the bejeeezous out <br/>\nof EQ, then have it do crashes and whatnot.  OTH, the game loads FAST, and I <br/>\nzone darn quick now too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, someone say they have an idea of what I can do!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewduer Fflamson 48 Bard, Cazic-Thule server,  Knights of Loyalty<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
