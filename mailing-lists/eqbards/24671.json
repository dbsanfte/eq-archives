You are LUCKY <br/>\nyou missed Hate on Monday, Slyde.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, real story... there was only one bard in Hate on Monday (both <br/>\nsides) and a Bard BP dropped in the other group. Since Onahoo was the <br/>\nonly one up there, he ran over and got it. Also... when DC dropped <br/>\nthe Mae, he had a Seven stringer... once again, it went to Onahoo...<br/>\n<br/>\nI, also, was not in Hate on Monday... Monday night was a &quot;make up&quot; <br/>\nnight with my wife because I played WAY too much over the weekend. <br/>\nLast night was also a family night, so I missed that too...<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of last night, I was playing my magician, and saw quite a <br/>\nfew of you guildmates collecting in Freeport. Working on a Paladin <br/>\nsword? I was going to offer to help, but knew no one, and you were <br/>\nnot online.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe well,<br/>\n<br/>\nGaelthorne<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
