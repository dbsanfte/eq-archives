I&#39;m fairly certain that when you sing DDD<br/>\nor CoD, anyone standing within the radius who isn&#39;t in your group gets a<br/>\nmessage saying something to the effect &quot;Galtin sings a song but you it does<br/>\nnot affect you&quot;.  They could gradually move away from you until they no<br/>\nlonger get the message.  You could then compare /loc grids to see how far<br/>\naway the radius extends.  If you were somewhere like the aviak village in<br/>\nSK, you could even confirm how far the radius extended along the z-axis.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also stated you use DDD all the time, even in indoor zones.  I thought<br/>\nthe general concensus of this list was that singing DDD in dungeons was very<br/>\nrisky due to the z-axis bug.  I will admit that I took that as an absolute<br/>\nand as a result rarely use this song.  Would really like to know all the<br/>\n&quot;safe&quot; areas to sing DDD/CoD.      <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Careful not to confuse a monster swarm with area effect bugs.  I use DDD<br/>\n&gt; all the time, even in indoor zones.  (Though I have had trouble in<br/>\n&gt; Runnyeye).  Been using it in perma with no problems.  The thing you<br/>\n&gt; describe below I&#39;ve had happen to non-bard characters as well.  It&#39;s like<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve killed too many of that type of monster, and they all decide to<br/>\n&gt; open<br/>\n&gt; a can of whoop-ass on you.  Had that happen to me most recently in<br/>\n&gt; steamfont while fighting earth elems.  All of a sudden, I see a whole<br/>\n&gt; swarm<br/>\n&gt; of them moving toward me (slowly, in that menacing earth elem way), wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; sure what was going on until too late.  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;The more I think about the z-axis bug, the more I realize that it really<br/>\n&gt; &gt;puts a hamper on our effectiveness.  I almost never have DDD or CoD<br/>\n&gt; &gt;memorized unless I&#39;m in a wide open area in outdoor zone.  Don&#39;t assume<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because you are outdoors the z-axis bug won&#39;t bite you.  One time I was<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the Beholder Maze fighting evil eyes and minos.  My group was camping<br/>\n&gt; along<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the wall in the gorge where the Lord evil eyes appear.  I sang DDD in<br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fight.  We were having a great time when all of a sudden just about every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;muddite and mino in the entire zone came rushing into the gorge. Everyone<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;them starting attacking me so I can only assume that one of them got<br/>\n&gt; &gt;affected by DDD through the mountain walls and started up a train.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Verant can&#39;t/won&#39;t fix the z-axis bug, I would likely welcome a nerf<br/>\n&gt; &gt;reducing the radius of DDD and CoD so we could use it more often.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A Goblin Warrior winces!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A Goblin Warrior is hit for 15 damage non-melee<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Faras &quot;harp-music playing in the background&quot; Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Steven S.
