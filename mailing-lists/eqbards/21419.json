Then I did an experiment with<br/>\nmy original bard on Sol Ro.  I walked around several zones asking some<br/>\ngroups if I could join.  7 out of eleven said they weren&#39;t interested for<br/>\nvarious reasons, I was too high a level, I was too low a level, they didn&#39;t<br/>\nreally need another member, etc.  I then ran around the same groups with my<br/>\nenchanter and every single one had room for me.  My enchanter was the exact<br/>\nsame level at the time as my bard.  Two of the groups reasoning seemed<br/>\nsomewhat logical, but for 4 of them it was patently obvious they had no<br/>\ninterest in a bard.  I had my friend try with his warrior who was one level<br/>\nhigher and he only got refused by 2 groups.  There are definitely some<br/>\npeople who will only group with a character they think will make them able<br/>\nto get more xp/loot/etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 14, 2000 11:13 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Abashi&#39;s response to a very well thought out post<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:26 PM 9/14/00 +0200, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can just see this (try to think about it) ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If bards are the best grouping class in all Everquest,<br/>\n&gt;every group should love to have one.<br/>\n&gt;But in the reality of Norath, a bard can hardly find a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>say what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So something is wrong, and i know that&#39;s not the &quot;a bard can hardly find a<br/>\n&gt;group&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>maybe that&#39;s &#39;&#39;you can hardly find a group&#39;&#39;, but i definitely have no<br/>\nproblems finding<br/>\na group with my bard.  maybe you need to make some friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Nothing to say more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
