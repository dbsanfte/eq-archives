I&#39;m 24th level and fighting<br/>\nin the aviak village now.  Of the 24 songs songs available to me, I have the<br/>\neight songs memorized which I think help me/my party the most.  They are:<br/>\n<br/>\nSelos: In case we need to flee<br/>\nTeleport song: In case we need to get to the ground quickly from the top<br/>\nroost.  Trying to run all the way down the ramp is too risky<br/>\nHymm: to heal the party<br/>\nChain: slow down attacks and helps pull aviaks off of casters (darters and<br/>\nabove don&#39;t flee so you don&#39;t have to worry about that)  <br/>\nLullaby: in case we get more than we can handle<br/>\nAnthem: speed up attacks<br/>\nLament: in case we only want to fight one aviak at a time.  comes in handy<br/>\nwhen the top room is full.  <br/>\nBellow or warsong: situation dependent.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery one of these songs can help you in the situation I described (aviak<br/>\nvillage).  No way I&#39;m gonna give one of them up to memorize Jig.  I would<br/>\nimagine that higher level bards have an even more difficult time deciding on<br/>\nwhich eight songs to memorize.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think there is a distinction between educating other classes on how<br/>\nbest to group with a bard versus telling them how to play their character.<br/>\nIn other words, telling them to use /assist on the puller so they don&#39;t wake<br/>\nup mobs you are sleeping with the lullaby song is not telling them how to<br/>\nplay their class (IMO).  The first thing I always do when I group with<br/>\npeople I&#39;ve never grouped with before is ask them how often they play with<br/>\nbards.  If they say rarely, I have a standard response I give in an attempt<br/>\nto educate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn closing, I guess we can agree to disagree.  If any bard out there is<br/>\nwilling to give up one of their eight song slots to play Jig for any reason<br/>\nother than stamina gain, its your choice.  For me personally, I won&#39;t do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  If they continue to insist I play the Jig, I tell them that would require<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to replace one of the eight songs that could actually benefit the group.<br/>\n&gt; If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they continue to insist I sing Jig, then I will leave the group.  Their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; peace of mind does not outweigh my desire to not die.  Losing a valuable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; song slot to play Jig when I know it has no effect increases my chance<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dying.  Also, I never tell anyone how to play their character.<br/>\n&gt; Therefore, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t appreciate it when someone who has never played a bard tells me<br/>\n&gt; how to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play mine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In any area where the MOBs take a long time to take down, I usually have<br/>\n&gt; Jig <br/>\n&gt; memorized.  If my fatigue bar gets to 1/2, it&#39;s pretty certain that the<br/>\n&gt; tanks <br/>\n&gt; are down, also, and I really don&#39;t want to suffer the speed penalties of<br/>\n&gt; group <br/>\n&gt; fatigue in an extended fight, so I twist it in for awhile.  Even in other <br/>\n&gt; circumstances, I will swap Jig in during downtime between fights if<br/>\n&gt; requested.  <br/>\n&gt; Why not, if it makes people feel better.  I don&#39;t think that we require<br/>\n&gt; all <br/>\n&gt; eight slots to be full of precisely the right songs in order to win<br/>\n&gt; fights, and <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never died thinking to myself &quot;if only I had song X memorized, I<br/>\n&gt; would have <br/>\n&gt; lived&quot;.  I&#39;ve died for 100 other reasons (at least)!  ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for your second point, I *always* tell other people how to play their <br/>\n&gt; characters, especially if they are unused to Bards.  I&#39;ve died FAR more<br/>\n&gt; often <br/>\n&gt; from other player&#39;s lack of playing sophistication than from having the<br/>\n&gt; Jig <br/>\n&gt; memorized.  I do try to make my instruction impersonal and<br/>\n&gt; non-judgemental, but <br/>\n&gt; I would be a fool to assume that other players know what they&#39;re doing.  <br/>\n&gt; (Actually, I&#39;ve been that fool many times over, I just finally learned the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; lesson.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And yes, if they are NOT being impersonal and non-judgemental, I DO leave.<br/>\n&gt; Even <br/>\n&gt; if they are mistaken in thinking that I&#39;m an idiot (I leave that to others<br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; judge), I don&#39;t want to fight with a group that believes that that is the<br/>\n&gt; case.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 27 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
