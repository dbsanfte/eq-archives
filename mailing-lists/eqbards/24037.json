AS SOON AS IT LANDS, sit your butt<br/>\ndown, and camp.  You have 18 seconds leeway before charm breaks (hopefully),<br/>\nand 12 seconds for the mobs to run around and come agro on you.  With the<br/>\npathing in Dalnir, you can make it maybe 1/3 of the time, especially if they<br/>\ndecide to take the really long way around.<br/>\nSecond option:  curl up in a ball and wait to die.
