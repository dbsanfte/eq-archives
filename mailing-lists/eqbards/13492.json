Guess what you<br/>\nlow levels are having a ton more fun then us high levles why do you think so<br/>\nmany of us twink? They have to do something about high levels because they<br/>\nare the most unhappy there are only two zones excluding planes that people<br/>\ndo sol b and guk. DO you have any clue how crowded it is? We were doing<br/>\nbothg planes and both dragons at the same time on E&#39;ci and guess what there<br/>\nis still 80+ people in guk and sol b. This is a major problem and they need<br/>\nto fix the problem not add stuff for low levels who are just complaining<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t get anything new added. Perosnally I could care less if they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t add anything new for me but I do care that it&#39;s crowded as hell  for<br/>\nhigh levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, January 21, 2000 4:48 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone posted a link on the new Concert Hall message board of the new bard<br/>\n&gt;quests on the PoA.
