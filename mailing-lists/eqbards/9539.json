Most everyone was fleeing<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the zone and when it was just me and 2 mobs left I stepped back into<br/>\nsafety<br/>\n&gt; of west c.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then med, healed who ever needed some and we popped back in - but it was<br/>\nnow<br/>\n&gt; &quot;day time&quot; such as it is in Kith.  People did their CR and kinda explored<br/>\n&gt; but nothing was found.  I ran to RV for some banking and when I popped<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; in for the next night fall (9pm spawn game-time rumor) but alas - nothing<br/>\n&gt; happened.  So I joined my reg group and headed for Lguk.  Saw a system<br/>\n&gt; message saying something about the event being over (although the<br/>\nreference<br/>\n&gt; was to a different zone.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So - that&#39;s all I know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not over in Qeynos Hills, all sorts of new undead.<br/>\nSkeletal spearmen, level 6-7, they always have a rusty<br/>\nspear and buckler (worth 4+ gp for the pair).<br/>\nSkeletal Corporals, Level 7-8, with a rusty battle axe.<br/>\nSkeletal Soldiers,  level &lt;5 (green to my Lvl 8 bard),<br/>\nvarious rusty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got clobbered by a skeletal monk, and had a Warbones<br/>\nspawn on my head.  All in all, Paw is still better for the<br/>\nnext 3 bubbles.  In the course of 5 bubbles of exp around<br/>\nthe outside, and in the first 2 rooms, I&#39;ve picked up 12 pp<br/>\nworth of rusty/cloth/wooden shields.  Plus it&#39;s usually<br/>\ndeserted (only bards seem to have the ability to exploit<br/>\nthat area at that level.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPadraic, bard of the 8th song. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
