To bad about the <br/>\n     blackened armor, it is just heavy enough and thin enough that I don&#39;t <br/>\n     think it is worth it.  It looks great though.  The one area where I <br/>\n     disregard looks if my weapons.  Still using the pitiful looking <br/>\n     Dragoon dirk. (I just feel silly threatening MOBs with a sewing needle <br/>\n     in my hand...) Matched with a combine Scimitar it&#39;s looks damn silly <br/>\n     but I&#39;m a quisinart(sp) in combat (with dual wield fast weapons are <br/>\n     imperative, IMHO)  The Orange, er Bronze armor looks much better if <br/>\n     you can find some good arm armor of a different type.  I use barbed(?) <br/>\n     armplates.  The Water staff thingie looks great, I saw one this <br/>\n     weekend, but it&#39;s stats are rather low.  Just can&#39;t afford the damage <br/>\n     loss.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Bujold, 19<br/>\n     dead and disgusted in befallen<br/>\n     xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________ Reply Separator _________________________________<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] BQ (Bards Quarterly) A few words about bards and<br/>\nAuthor:  Non-HP-lordartos (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>) at HP-ColSprings,mimegw5<br/>\nDate:    8/2/99 7:08 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nSo I&#39;ve been running around in full bronze plate for a <br/>\nfew levels, when suddenly I look at myself and <br/>\nrealize, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m ornge&quot;.  So I&#39;m thinking of buying <br/>\na set of blackened.  I hear it&#39;s less ac and heavier, <br/>\ncan any one verify? (yes I&#39;m saving up for silver but <br/>\nEGADS that&#39;s spendy)  If it&#39;s not too huge a dif I&#39;ll <br/>\nwear the pieces that show any way.  Also, I picked up <br/>\na Water Crystal Staff this weekend in Lake Rathe. <br/>\nWanted to raise my 1h blunt any way, so now I&#39;m duel <br/>\nweilding it and a PGT, which looks awesome.  HUGE <br/>\nstamina sucker though.  I get inspected a lot more now <br/>\ntoo, seeing as how we&#39;re the only non caster class who <br/>\ncan use it, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the only person on E <br/>\nMarr duel weilding it :).  Any way, am I crazy or does <br/>\nanyone else use lesser items in favor of how they <br/>\nlook?<br/>\n     <br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n     <br/>\n_____________________________________________________________ <br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nCreate a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n...and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
