Dead enchanter.)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a big difference here:<br/>\n<br/>\nEnchanter scenario:<br/>\nLots of mobs come.  Mobs jump whoever is closest until Enchanter AE Mez/Stun<br/>\nfires off.  Enchanters can be resisted, but the Enchanter resist rate is FAR<br/>\nless than a bard resist rate; perhaps when they get around to fixing Lullaby<br/>\nand Pixie, that&#39;ll change.  I very rarely have to charm anything off of the<br/>\nenchantress I play with (I charm very quickly when I see her getting<br/>\ntagged).  Enchanters also have a relatively quick-casting Stun line that<br/>\nallows them time to reapply the mez for those resisting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard scenario:<br/>\nLots of mobs come.  Mobs jump whoever is closest until the bard&#39;s next song<br/>\npulses (anywhere from 0.01 seconds to 3.00 seconds, depending on where in<br/>\nthe twist the bard is).  Then all extra mobs proceed to gank the bard.<br/>\nSometimes, it does take a couple pulses.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
