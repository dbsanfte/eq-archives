Firstly he<br/>\nlikely wouldn&#39;t want to, and secondly it may be against a<br/>\nconfidentiality clause in his contract.  ;)<br/>\nBesides, it would ruin all the fun we have of throwing ideas<br/>\nback and forth. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The following formula would be true according to my above examples:<br/>\n&gt; Weapon dmg * 2 + skill lvl/strength bonuses. Every couple levels, as my<br/>\n&gt; skills increase, my max dmg goes up as well.<br/>\n&gt; So, with my current skill levels and strength factors, it would be<br/>\n&gt; Weapon dmg * 2 + 9<br/>\n&gt; Barbed whip - 7 * 2 + 9 = 23<br/>\n&gt; Silvery axe, dirk, ashenwood spear - 6 * 2 + 9 = 21<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You haven&#39;t stated your &#39;skill lvl/strength bonuses&#39;.  Personally<br/>\nI HATE magic numbers (I&#39;m a programmer), so throwing in a &#39;9&#39; is<br/>\nunsatisfactory without explanation, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now here&#39;s where I became confused and threw a wrench into my whole<br/>\n&gt; formula.<br/>\n&gt; I equipped a new weapon, which has a dmg of 11.<br/>\n&gt; But, so far (haven&#39;t had oppurtunity to test it a whole lot), its max<br/>\n&gt; dmg peaked at 35<br/>\n&gt; Certain weapon - 11 * 2 + 9 = 31. So how was I hitting for 35?<br/>\n&gt; Obviously my formula is not correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Obviously.  Firstly you didn&#39;t say what skill that weapon used,<br/>\nso i can&#39;t check my own formula.  But assuming it is a 1H or<br/>\npiercing weapon, my formula gives max damage of 34.  Pretty close,<br/>\nif not correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have a problem with a dmg * (something) + something else.<br/>\nPersonally the idea of dmg * (something + something else) is more<br/>\nappealing to me, as it gives greater return as &#39;something&#39; and<br/>\n&#39;something else&#39; (say STR and skill) increase.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe inconsistent results you recieved also suggest that whatever<br/>\nformula you used to get your magic number &#39;9&#39; is wrong.  Did you<br/>\nactually use a formula, or did you just say &quot;dmg * 2 - max = 9, <br/>\nso the modifier must be + 9&quot;?<br/>\nThe fact that it doesn&#39;t work suggests that the modifier is not<br/>\njust a linear addend.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, what is the correct formula? I haven&#39;t a clue anymore. I sure would<br/>\n&gt; like to know though. Knowledge is power afterall =)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As posted earlier by myself, i believe the formula is something like:<br/>\n<br/>\ndmg * max( (skill in weapon + STR)/100 , 2) + 1<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, circumstantial evidence posted in this newsgroup suggests<br/>\nthat this is not all there is to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I have difficulty believing that the Offence skill has<br/>\nno bearing on how much you hit.  OK, maybe it&#39;s used for the chance<br/>\nto hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else got any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nRocket<br/>\nMully, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
