Now a friend who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1207306102\">My goodness, what kind of answer is that??  I too was a bard like you who<br/>\ncared little about AC and more about stat modifiers and looks.  Now a<br/>\nfriend who playing a leevel 50 ranger at the time mad mention of how a  <br/>\njump of 10 AC points mad a difference of 1 full bubble of health when<br/>\nsoloing a Greater Kobold in Sol B I was entrigued.  So that knight I<br/>\nstarted swapping some stat modifiers for some better AC items.  Did I<br/>\nnotice a difference with 20 more natural AC??? Hell yes.  I may not be a  <br/>\nprimary tank or even a secondary or even a tertiary tank, however I do<br/>\nknow that if I am in a group and there is a multi mob pull that I will be<br/>\nthe one dealing with all the mobs beyond the first one.  So does AC help<br/>\nin this situation?? The answer is yes.  What natural AC does for you is it<br/>\nreduces the maximal damage that can be inflicted upon you and it also <br/>\nreducs the chances of a creature inflicting maximal damage upon you. <br/>\nThese are good things considering the fact that I have only 827 hitpoints<br/>\nat level 36.  That&#39;s like 10-20 melee rounds before I die to a mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust something to consider if you think that AC is not important.  It is<br/>\nimmensely important for all classes even us non-mainline tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the original topic, I think and have always had the feeling that GZ<br/>\nhas been out of touch with bards.  The only benefit from the singing boots<br/>\nthat I see is the fact that I don&#39;t ever have to buy food and water.  Sure<br/>\nin the long run that will be a wonderful godsend, however losing 3-5 AC<br/>\npoints on 2-3 pieces of armor is a very big consequence.  I would gladly<br/>\ntrade most effects, modifiers and procs for a good healthy dose of AC any<br/>\nday.  Would I tank with that AC? Heck no, but at least I could take an<br/>\nextra hit or two =).  My assumption is that GZ is expecting all bards<br/>\nusing the Singing steel to be wielding symphonic harmony weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin<br/>\nBard of Kelethin<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 18 May 2000, Kevin L.
