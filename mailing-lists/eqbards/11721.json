I had done upper guk a little bit at low levels<br/>\n(12-13) so I figured hey, how hard can it be to find your way around.  Of<br/>\ncourse everyone who knows how to find their way around guk is now laughing<br/>\nat that remark.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, a very nice group found me in the room with the wine kegs and lead<br/>\nme to the dead side of lower guk.  I told them why I had made the trip and<br/>\nthey were very helpful, and pulled the live shin knights to get me the<br/>\ngloves even though most were green to them.  My strategy was to remain invis<br/>\nduring the lives and I would hide during the undead pulls.  Very successful,<br/>\nand if you just wait by the hallway once you zone in to lower guk its quite<br/>\nsafe (assuming you put all your stuff in the bank before you went).  The<br/>\ngloves drop with alarming frequency, the legs dropped after about 15<br/>\nundeads.<br/>\n<br/>\nI almost got a basalt carapace that another group offered me however there<br/>\nwere 2 undead froggies in my way and no way was I going to impose on that<br/>\ngroup by asking them to clear them.  All in all it was a lot of fun, even if<br/>\nit did take me 40 mins to get back out (got lost again in upper guk).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and btw: the best dungeon currency is non-summoned food and water.  I<br/>\nbrought along 2 packs full of milk and muffins.  The other service that is<br/>\nuseful is trading out plat for the lesser denominations, however I didn&#39;t<br/>\nthink about that until I was already there.  Next time I go I&#39;ll be sure to<br/>\nload up.<br/>\n<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Tork@Nameless&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
