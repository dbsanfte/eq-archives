One ice giant, one<br/>\nice giant priest, and two giant spiders eventually overwhelmed<br/>\nme.  I couldn&#39;t get AE Fear off because the combined damage from<br/>\nthose monsters killed me in less than 5 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing happened about 30 minutes later as well, but<br/>\nthis second evac was a complete success as Screech feared almost<br/>\neverything in that room without resist.  No deaths in a no win<br/>\nsituation, I like those odds.
