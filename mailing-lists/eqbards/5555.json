As for the attack<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       speed and AC adjustments, I&#39;ve never noticed any tangible<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       benefits.  Currently never memorized.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bah - as long as you keep it Chained, why should they<br/>\n&gt; complain?  Chain is superior to snare because it slows down<br/>\n&gt; attack speed.  It&#39;s also a pretty good taunt, and ask any<br/>\n&gt; healer - they&#39;d rather the bard in banded/plate be taking<br/>\n&gt; damage, not the druid in leather.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, a bard cannot be trusted to keep something chained. Things<br/>\nsometimes resist (just once) and boom, they&#39;re around the corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a snarer in the group, the bard should /not/ be using chains<br/>\nunless you don&#39;t mind runners. Where I adventure, one runner means evac or<br/>\ndeath.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, the chains act as a major taunt, which is sometimes good but<br/>\nnot always. A snare is a very weak taunt. A ranger/druid can snare a mob<br/>\nand never have it aggro on him very easily. Additioanly, snare (NOT<br/>\nensnare) last a guaranteed, set time varying with level. Once they&#39;re<br/>\nsnared, there&#39;s no chance of that mob breaking free until that set time<br/>\nhas passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; 23 -- Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain.  Great &quot;taunt&quot; and as a bonus, it can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       used to snare runners if you don&#39;t have a snare caster in the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s better than relying on casters to snare/root because you<br/>\n&gt; can chase mobs while singing this song - they can&#39;t while<br/>\n&gt; casting snare/root.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s MUCH better to rely on casters to snare. Why? Because chains has<br/>\nto be cast while the runner is trying to run -- one failure and it&#39;s time<br/>\nto evac. Snare can be cast on all the mobs at the beginning of the battle,<br/>\nwithout making the mobs attack the snarer. You then no longer have to<br/>\nworry about mobs escaping. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to summarize.. snare can be cast /before/ mobs try to run, without<br/>\ngetting the attention of an engaged mob and is reliable.<br/>\n<br/>\nChains must be used while the mob is trying to run and has multiple<br/>\nchances at resist. One resist and it&#39;s evac time. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if there&#39;s nobody who can snare in the group (rooters only),<br/>\nthen chain away. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a bard who chains snared mobs is likely to get kicked out of many<br/>\ngroups after getting them all killed a few times.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
