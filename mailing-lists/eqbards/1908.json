As it stands I&#39;m doing the<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; opposite, cuz I figure since I have a veryfast weapon to play with I&#39;d<br/>\nbest <br/>\n&gt; give it all the chances I can to do as much dmg as possible by using it in<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; my primary. I might&#39;ve just confused the issue ;) What I&#39;d love is to<br/>\nstick <br/>\n&gt; another Dvinn&#39;s dagger in my secondary hand... *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nA combine LS is 6/28, or 0.214 damage over time ratio.<br/>\nA dragoon dirk is 6/23, 0.261 damage over time ratio.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your chance to succeed at dual wielding is x%, then your<br/>\ntotal damage over time ratio is<br/>\n<br/>\n(primary weapon ratio) + (x% * secondary weapon ratio)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless x is 100%, you will thus always want the weapon with<br/>\nthe better ratio in your primary hand.  (When x is 100%, it<br/>\ndoes not matter which is in which hand.)  An exception is when<br/>\nfighting spellcasters, when you might want the faster speed to<br/>\ninterrupt them.  But since the dirk has the better ratio AND<br/>\nis faster, it&#39;s a no-brainer - put it in your primary hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; But do folks agree that it&#39;d technically (using Vulcan logic here) be best<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; simply to do Anthem with 2 bellows, repeat? This is for me at lvl 20 btw. <br/>\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t even heal, leave that for after the battle. The aim is to zap the<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; critter as fast as possible from what I&#39;ve seen. And remember - this is <br/>\n&gt; hypothetical. Why I&#39;ll never deny that sometimes there&#39;s a need and a <br/>\n&gt; desire to be all efficient about this game, most of the time I&#39;d rather <br/>\n&gt; have fun even if it involves more risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare the time it takes you to zap the critter as quickly as<br/>\npossible, to the time it would take if you put healing in<br/>\nthere.  If in that time difference, the mob could do more<br/>\ndamage than you could heal throughout the entire fight, then<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t make sense to heal during the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t an easy figure to obtain (since to figure it out<br/>\nyou have to kill the mob, which means you can&#39;t do it again<br/>\nthe other way).  So you&#39;ll just have to rely on your judgement<br/>\nas to which is better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll also use Guardian or Elemental Rhythms if we&#39;re fighting<br/>\na spellcasting mob.  Has anyone else noticed that Elemental<br/>\nRhythms actually increases your magic resist the same as<br/>\nGuardian (at least up to L20)?  The only advantage of Guardian<br/>\nis that it gives me 1 extra AC, and that didn&#39;t happen until I<br/>\nwas L20.  Before then, Elemental was either the same or<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
