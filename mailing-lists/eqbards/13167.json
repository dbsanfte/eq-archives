I missed that in the equation above.

Heck, I even had<br/>\nto stop weaving songs and attacking from time to time, or BOTH<br/>\ngiants would&#39;ve been attacking me.  :(  The really odd thing<br/>\nis that I haven&#39;t had this problem (mob everyone is attacking<br/>\ndeciding I should die first) with normal mobs.
