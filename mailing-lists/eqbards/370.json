(such as making a <br/>\nhotkey to say &#39;Hail and well met friends I am such and such the <br/>\nBard&#39;, or a bow button...or a /loc...or a /who...etc...etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the snake fang worth using?  I have a very high skill in one <br/>\nhanded slashing and am getting tired of it, thinking of changing but <br/>\nreally dont know what skill to get.  (im 10th level btw)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have a URL for some EQ maps?...yes the vault and stratics <br/>\nhave a few...but im looking to put together a book of maps for a <br/>\nbuddy of mine, and need a few more maps (such as the troll newbie <br/>\narea, etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat level do you get Boistrous Bellow at?  And exactally how much <br/>\ndamage does it to per &#39;tick&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed if I go to any bard guild hall, they seem to sell me <br/>\nitems cheaper than any other shops...plus they buy for a few more <br/>\nsilver than the other places.  Is there a spell out there which will <br/>\nmake the shopkeepers (regular ones) buy and sell cheaper?  I assume <br/>\nthere is being we are the most charasmatic bunch on Norrath ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk one last question to all you fantasy loving freaks out there <br/>\n(sorry couldnt think of another question at this time...)<br/>\n<br/>\nscroll downnnn.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT IS THE MEAN VELOCITY OF AN UNLADEN SPARROW?  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\ni couldnt resist :P<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
