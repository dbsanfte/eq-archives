Above 20, most people are in guilds and<br/>\nare fairly likely to be with at least one other guild member in a party<br/>\nwhich tends to make people a little less greedy with loots - or so I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nso far.  I have a very small guild (14 people - all levels 20-35) and yet<br/>\nsomehow we always end up having at least 3 of us in a party (most of the<br/>\ntime its 5 or 6).  We tend to do the master loot and split method.  We have<br/>\none person, usually a warrior type loot all the corpses.  If people are<br/>\nlooking to keep items like FS and the like, we do that alphabetically.  The<br/>\ncoin however, we split whenever a party member is leaving or right before a<br/>\nnew member joins so that nobody misses out on what they&#39;ve earned.  If<br/>\nsomething rare comes up we find out who wants it and do the random roll<br/>\nthing.   Almost everyone outside of the guild that we&#39;ve ever grouped with<br/>\nhas agreed that this is a much more efficient way of looting, as it keeps<br/>\naway from the hard feelings of FFA, the bugs that incur during auto split<br/>\n(i.e. looter gets 2pp, member 2 gets 2gp, member 3 gets 2sp, etc.), and the<br/>\nadded burden to weak party members (like myself).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just my little bit of input<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland &lt;Disciples of Truth&gt;<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I finally got to meet Elwyn the other day, oddly enough I have run into<br/>\nhim several times since then.  Funny how that works.
