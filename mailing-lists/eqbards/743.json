Here&#39;s a recap of what I found last<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 12 May 1999, John Kim wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just timed this last night.  With a combine longsword (delay<br/>\n&gt; 28), I swing 5 times in roughly 14.0 seconds.  This is<br/>\n&gt; consistent with my previous findings that the weapon delay is<br/>\n&gt; just the recycle time in tenths of seconds (so 28 delay means<br/>\n&gt; 2.8 seconds between swings).<br/>\n<br/>\nNo change here.  No song, 28 seconds to swing 10 times.  (I<br/>\nchecked all of these with a stopwatch three times.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; With only the whistling warsong playing, it dropped to about<br/>\n&gt; 12.5 seconds, or about 25 delay (so my combine longsword is<br/>\n&gt; working like a well-balanced longsword :-).  Roughly a 10%<br/>\n&gt; speedup (my bard is L15).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis dropped to 23.7-23.9 sec for 10 swings, or about a 24<br/>\ndelay.  My singing skill was maxed when I tested it the first<br/>\ntime, so the only difference I can think of was that my bard<br/>\nwas about level 15.6 the second time, compared to 15.2 the<br/>\nfirst.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; With only the anthem playing, it<br/>\n&gt; was about 12.5 seconds, maybe 13.0 seconds (my stopwatch<br/>\n&gt; results for this one had about a half second of scatter).  So<br/>\n&gt; again the speedup is about 10%, maybe a hair slower than the<br/>\n&gt; warsong.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo change here.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Jonathan&#39;s Whistling Warsong definitely does speed up your<br/>\nattacks.  Enough so that it&#39;s obvious to me just watching it,<br/>\neven without a stopwatch.  The speedup seems to be dependent<br/>\non level, or both level and skill (or maybe it&#39;s charisma?<br/>\n:-).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I&#39;ve noticed with all my characters that they seem to have<br/>\nan easier time fighting in the second half of a level than in<br/>\nthe first.  The difference in the above timings support this.<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that some calculations are made based on the<br/>\nyour exact level (e.g. 15.4) instead of just the integer<br/>\nportion.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
