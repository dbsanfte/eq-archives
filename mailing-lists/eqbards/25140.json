I&#39;ll probably dump the Vox<br/>\nhorn next time I&#39;m near a bank too. Looks like I will keep my Lath Drinor in<br/>\nmy offhand. I was using it and a Croaking dagger. I have been seeing melee<br/>\nhits for up to 80 some. Klaget said he saw a 90 while we were in Skyshrine<br/>\nlast weekend, so the epic really helped out my melee. Before, my best hits<br/>\nwere in the 50s max.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde: Gratz on the new weapon! I have never seen one of those and we have<br/>\nspent alot of time in HS south. <br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal, I personally don&#39;t have a char around 35, I have a 45 wiz and a 24<br/>\ncleric. Some good friends of mine are around 40 though (or were this past<br/>\nweekend, may be higher now). If we&#39;re not on, try looking for Delania/Chubb.<br/>\nChubb is a shaman pl&#39;ing his rogue, Delania, on a second account. He&#39;s<br/>\nusually in CoM. Tell him you&#39;re a pal of mine looking for a group. Chubb<br/>\nkeeps saying he wants his own bard! We may be able to group when I play my<br/>\nwiz, which I am going to concentrate on getting her out of 45 in the near<br/>\nfuture. Link to our guild message board:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub8.ezboard.com/bvenatorsapentia.\">http://pub8.ezboard.com/bvenatorsapentia.</a> Drive by and say hello to all the<br/>\ncrazy people! <br/>\n<br/>\nScales: Work on your epic quest and do all the one group, one person parts.<br/>\nHaving that stuff done ups your chances of getting priority on a scale drop.<br/>\nAs to guilds, well VS doesn&#39;t really have the numbers on at any one time to<br/>\nkill a dragon. What we do have is alliances with other guilds in the same<br/>\nboat. Alliances are sorta like marriages though so you do have to do some<br/>\nchecking on the partner first. The easiest way is to make friends in other<br/>\nguilds and help anyone you can do their epic battles. I know we are on a<br/>\nserious Gore watch right now for Reorn to get his Frost tome. If I&#39;m on,<br/>\nI&#39;ll try and look for you guys when we get our next shot. I can&#39;t promise<br/>\nyou will get the scale but meeting people who can and do kill dragons<br/>\nregularly is a good thing! When we went to kill Trak for me the second time,<br/>\nit looked almost like a HL lemming rush. I was not minded to turn any one of<br/>\nmy friends away and so many wanted to come help. We like killing dragons,<br/>\nand we like helping people we know to be good people do their epic quests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
