He&#39;s been one of the longest-lived 50th level bards, and a <br/>\nconstant contributor to the bardic community.  As a show of fellowship, and <br/>\nto see that he leaves with a bang, not a whimper, we, the Bards of Norrath, <br/>\nare staging an event in honor of his retirement: Jackalstock.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe premise is simple.  Anyone who wishes to come is welcome, be they bard <br/>\nor other well-wisher.  We&#39;ll all make newbie halflings and meet at the <br/>\nPriest of Discord in Rivervale on Tunare at 12noon PST on Saturday, February <br/>\n12th, 2000.  From there, we&#39;ll proceed to High Hold Pass, where we&#39;ll be <br/>\nbound.  Once everyone is gathered, mandolins will be distributed (so we&#39;ll <br/>\nbe happy halfling bards) and we will proceed to East Karana.  We&#39;ll all <br/>\ngather at the top of the gorge, and leap lemminglike into the great beyond.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wish to attend, please create a character with a name beginning Jx, <br/>\nfollowed by the name of your bard or other main character.  Thus Aloro <br/>\nbecomes Jxaloro, Demari becomes Jxdemari, etc.  This aids in identifying <br/>\neach other.  Please do not turn /roleplay or /anon on, so we can tell who&#39;s <br/>\nattending and find when everyone&#39;s in place.  Further, please don&#39;t PvP so <br/>\nwe can bind you.  Please be at the Priest of Discord in Rivervale on the <br/>\nTunare server at noon PST on Saturday the 12th, ready to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you who remember Gnomestock &#39;99, this is a similar event <br/>\ndesigned to offer the Bards from different servers a chance to socialize and <br/>\nhave some silly fun, while offering up our lives in JackalX&#39;s memory.  This <br/>\nis more a wake than a funeral, so expect booze and merriment.  Once we&#39;ve <br/>\nleapt (as many times as we feel appropriate) we&#39;ll gather at the Tiger&#39;s <br/>\nRoar, one of the finest taverns in Norrath, for frolicking and carousing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you there!<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
