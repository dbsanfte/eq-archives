It all seemed to start happening when I<br/>\nfirst entered sol b.  I&#39;d chain the kobolds and they&#39;d<br/>\nrun off.  As I&#39;m trying to recast I get about 6<br/>\nresists in a row.  It is really unreliable.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow whether it is certain mobs that are causing<br/>\ntrouble or not.  I now let the rangers snare--I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen playing around with Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>\ninstead for the slowdown attack.  Whether Chains got<br/>\nbugged about that time or whether it is just the<br/>\ncertain mobs, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; What level are you and what mobs are you using it<br/>\n&gt; on?  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; found it no less reliable in duration than our<br/>\n&gt; charm/fear/mez<br/>\n&gt; &gt; songs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hehe, I mentioned that I had EXTREMELY unpredictable<br/>\n&gt; results with chains and<br/>\n&gt; that is NEVER stuck for the full duration a couple<br/>\n&gt; weeks ago and practically<br/>\n&gt; got flamed out of this egroup :).  Talk about an<br/>\n&gt; uber-thread (started with<br/>\n&gt; something about lazy snarers).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend online invitations with Yahoo!
