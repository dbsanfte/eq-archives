The group who can play for hours<br/>\nstill gets the benefit as they are going to be there for hours anyhow, your<br/>\ngroup gets their limited playing time suddenly made nearly pointless while<br/>\nhad the group that&#39;s going to be on for 6 hours simply let you have their<br/>\ntwo hours they would miss only 1/3 rd of their available time, you are<br/>\nforced to lose half your time which may well make the room unviable for you.<br/>\nResult is you move on to find something you can actually enjoy your two<br/>\nhours at and the long termers get the whole room anyhow for the full time.<br/>\nEventually the short timers will find everything shared and will quit in<br/>\nfrustration as they never get a turn at getting a useful chance to do a room<br/>\ninstead getting many turns that are not very useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 16, 2000 11:27 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Worldly Issues & &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 16 Mar 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The postings made it clear its worse than that.  If a room has two named<br/>\n&gt; spawns a second group can freely waltz in and demand to be allowed to camp<br/>\n&gt; one of the named spawns.  If its a room with two different items that<br/>\n&gt; different classes in your group wants, suddenly part of your group has<br/>\n&gt; nothing to gain from camping the room and will likely leave in disgust<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; this happens two or three times.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I think most of you guys are looking at worst-case<br/>\nscenarios.  e.g. you really really want this item and have<br/>\nbeen spending hours camping it, someone comes in and demands<br/>\nto share the spawn, and he gets the item on the next spawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at the big picture, the mobs still spawn at the<br/>\nsame rate, the number of rare items dropped per day is still<br/>\nthe same.  The only thing that&#39;s changed is who has access to<br/>\nthem.  The &quot;group at the camp owns the spawn until they leave<br/>\nor die&quot; system favors those with lots of playtime - folks who<br/>\ncan get a room early while the servers are uncrowded, and hold<br/>\nit until late at night.  With the new rules, people without as<br/>\nmuch time to play, or heaven forbid people dungeon crawling,<br/>\nwill have access to camped spawns.  Yes someone might demand<br/>\nyou share your SMR camp and get it ahead of you, but now you<br/>\ncan demand someone share their SMR camp with you, instead of<br/>\nwaiting 2 weeks for a free spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, the transition is going to be rather harsh.  <br/>\nPeople who try to be nice and respect the old rules are going<br/>\nto get screwed because they&#39;ll never want to &quot;impose&quot; the new<br/>\nrule on others, while others will impose it on them.  Folks<br/>\nwho break difficult spawns are also not going to be adequately<br/>\nrewarded (though my philosophy is to kill everything ASAP, and<br/>\nif someone who can&#39;t handle it demands to share, just invis or<br/>\nmove back and let him at it).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the fundamental problem is still overcrowding and static<br/>\nnamed mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
