Other bards who are<br/>\n&gt; able to wear the small bronze plate are much more viable at my level than<br/>\n&gt; I,<br/>\n&gt; simply because they have the ability to absorb more damage than I do with<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; banded mail.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tWhy don&#39;t you just buy the small bronze plate armor instead of the<br/>\nmedium.  It weighs less than medium size and that is very important for<br/>\nwood-elves since their starting strength is lower than human and half-elven<br/>\nbards.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy suggestion is moot if you are a human or half-elf bard but your<br/>\nfirst statement led me to believe you were a wood-elf.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGaltin<br/>\n\tE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
