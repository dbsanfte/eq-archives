Try this.  Take<br/>\neverything off and note your ac.  Put on the item and<br/>\nnote your ac.  Now repeate with a level 1 of your<br/>\nclass/race.  You&#39;ll get the same ac boost.  When I<br/>\ntested I took a partial set of bronze I had laying<br/>\naround and levelled a warrior from 1 to 15 and then<br/>\nchecked again with a 19 warrior and a 27 warrior IIRC<br/>\nand everyone got the exact same benefit from a fixed<br/>\nset of armor.  I&#39;ve also tested other things like<br/>\nsilver jacinth rings on level 50&#39;s down to a level 19.<br/>\n I have yet to find a level or skill based difference<br/>\nfor a given piece or pieces of equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\n-David<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, something besides just the item determines it&#39;s<br/>\neffectiveness.  Because the same 5ac item has gone<br/>\nfrom (at level 10) roughly 7AC value to over 12 AC<br/>\nValue at level 34.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething is causing it to be &#39;worth&#39; more at higher<br/>\nlevels.  Whether it be level dependent or skill<br/>\n(defense maybe?) dependent, I have not determined.<br/>\nBut there is definitely something making armor<br/>\n&quot;Better&quot; as you grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
