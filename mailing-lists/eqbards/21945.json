Was very <br/>\ninteresting that my cleric&#39;s stun/holy might would stun giants, yet the <br/>\nenchanter stuns would never stick. We may have to experiment with WTYH at <br/>\nsometime as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for AOE stun based around the caster, now I understand why you were <br/>\nsaying they could mez more utilizing stun than they could with just AOE mez.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed something that could very well be a bug. My wife (druid) <br/>\nwould pull froggies to us. I&#39;m sitting next to her so I see what she is <br/>\ntargetted on. I push my &quot;/assist &lt;char_name&gt;&quot; button and interestingly, <br/>\nfind that I&#39;m targetted upon a different frog. (Of course &lt;char_name&gt; is <br/>\nfilled in with her character&#39;s name)<br/>\nIt has wreaked a little havoc having our necro Dot&#39;ing the wrong frog. It <br/>\nhappens intermittantly to us during pulls. I&#39;ve asked my wife to keep her <br/>\nautoattack on even when returning to the camp to see if that helps, but it <br/>\nhas made no difference. Sometimes we have the right frog, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
