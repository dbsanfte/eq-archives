There&#39;s some overlap, as bugs<br/>\nin the current release should be fixed in the next one as well as for the<br/>\ncurrent one (via maintenance releases), but keeping all that staffed and<br/>\nunder control is a difficult job.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that Verant barely had the staff to not quite finish the<br/>\ninitial release and they&#39;re now completely swamped attempting to maintain<br/>\nit, including finishing details and fixing bugs, and on top of that they&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to figure out what they can realistically do next.  Along with that<br/>\nthere&#39;s the ongoing operation of the servers, since this sort of game play<br/>\nrequires their ongoing work and support.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said means I understand the bind I figure they&#39;re in, but that<br/>\nstill doesn&#39;t entirely excuse the lack of communication.  Their<br/>\ndocumentation is abysmal.  The game is complex and rich to the point that<br/>\nit&#39;s very hard to tell bugs from game features, which means that people can<br/>\neasily waste many hours of game play trying to do or use something that&#39;s<br/>\nbroken rather than appropriately obscure.  There&#39;s little excuse for<br/>\nletting that situation continue.  Among all their people they should be<br/>\nable to dedicate one or two to keeping people from beating their heads<br/>\nagainst blind alleys (to mix a metaphor).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a bard and a tailor (and in another personna a warrior and a smith), I&#39;d<br/>\nsettle for some effects not working for a while if I simply knew which were<br/>\nbroken and which I haven&#39;t understood but should work out in game.  There&#39;s<br/>\nenough there to have plenty of fun while I wait for fixes and finishes, but<br/>\nI resent wasting on wild-goose chases any of the too much time I already<br/>\nspend in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
