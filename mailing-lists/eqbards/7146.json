Merely running past an ongoing melee that I am not involved in seems to then later adjust my faction when the melee concludes. As you stated, so far I have not disliked the behavior because the faction adjustments are in my favor, but it definitely seems to be a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack from lurker mode because a silent bard is as useless as lipstick on a troll.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeledal<br/>\nBard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt; 09/24 1:46 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 24 Sep 1999 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This doesn&#39;t explain situations I&#39;ve seen where another group is<br/>\n&gt; fighting a mob (not one of the ones they are ignoring) and it stops part<br/>\n&gt; way through the fight to run over and take a whack at the bard in<br/>\n&gt; another group.
