Still whats 50P?  At lvl 35 I usually make at least 200P a night<br/>\n(keep in mind when I play I play for like 5 hours).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings me to a question for all of you out there.  When fighting<br/>\ncasters I normally go to full pixie strike mode.  I can usually get about<br/>\nhalf the spells interupted (including almost all heals as they are fairly<br/>\nslow cast).  When fighting mellee mobs I normally play Chant of Battle (drum<br/>\nsong), Binding (our enchanters LOVE me for this, as it seems to taunt all<br/>\nthe mezzed mobs to me when they break) and something else (hymm, damage<br/>\nshield, rhythm, depends).<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think I would now be better served throwing the drum in my hand and<br/>\nsinging rhythm, chant of battle and either guardian rhythms or Curtaling<br/>\nchant or hymm (with mandolin) against casters?<br/>\n<br/>\nI may experiment this weekend, but I&#39;d like some input first.<br/>\n<br/>\nElfson Allegro<br/>\n35 Half Barbarian Bard  Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
