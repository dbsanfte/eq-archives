I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-653023100\">Heya everybody!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not quitting EQ (yet) but Asheron&#39;s call is my number 1 game if my RL<br/>\nfriends aren&#39;t logged into EQ.  Thought I&#39;d share this with ya&#39;ll.  I know<br/>\nit&#39;s WAY Off Topic but I thought I would share.  I know some of my fellow<br/>\nbards are just as frustrated as I was with EQ so I thought I&#39;d post this<br/>\nvery viable alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I tried out Asheron&#39;s Call beta and really hated it.  The graphics<br/>\nsucked, the interface was kludgy etc.  So when final came along I didn&#39;t get<br/>\nthe game.  I was totally un-impressed.  Needless to say my tune has changed<br/>\nnow.  I tried it out this past two weeks while I was on a business trip...<br/>\nAll I can say is &quot;I&#39;m impressed&quot;.  I&#39;m not going to go into all the nitty<br/>\ngritty but I&#39;ll post some of my impressions that I got from the past 2<br/>\nweeks....<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Better support.  The GM&#39;s and Advocates (guides) really care about their<br/>\nplayers.  They respond very quickly compared to ours (EQ).<br/>\n2)  Better support.  They post regular updates as to what&#39;s been fixed, why<br/>\nit was fixed and what to expect from it.<br/>\n3)  Better support.  They listen to the players.  Usually when a bug is<br/>\nreported it&#39;s fixed by the next patch, if not the one after.  There&#39;s not a<br/>\nsingle bug left in the game that was reported from beta (*cough*)<br/>\n4)  Amazing landscape graphics!  The graphics are much better than EQ for<br/>\nscenery.  I was stunned.  The sun looks like the sun, not a big yellow ball<br/>\nin the sky.  Night time is a sky full of stars with the moons in the sky.<br/>\nBetter than that dark blue sky with a big white ball in the sky ;)<br/>\n5)  Combat interface is more realistic<br/>\n6)  Graphics for characters/npc&#39;s aren&#39;t quite as good as EQ but they&#39;re<br/>\nimproving those now too.<br/>\n7)  A _truely_ dynamic world.  Events occur regularly that involve the<br/>\nentire playerbase.  Everyone has an impact upon the world around them.<br/>\nAllegiances (Guilds) can even form Kingdoms, laws etc.<br/>\n8)  Ability to truely customize your character.  A Skill system similar to<br/>\nrole master or AD&D Revision 3.  Rather than the &#39;cookie cutter&#39; classes<br/>\nlike original AD&D you have a set of skills to choose from which allow you<br/>\nto make a truely unique character.<br/>\n9)  Ability to customize your character&#39;s appearance.  About 100 different<br/>\nvarieties of faces.  Can change hair styles, color and shade.  Can change<br/>\neye color and facial features.  Can change between a wide variety of beards.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not all golden and sunshine though.  There are drawbacks to it as well:<br/>\n1)  No zone-wide shouts (there are no zones)  AC staff has stated they&#39;re<br/>\nworking on a &quot;Yell&quot; command that will be heard in an area (probably 10 times<br/>\nthe radius of &quot;say&quot;)<br/>\n2)  Tougher learning curve.  Asheron&#39;s call is a lot more in-depth and takes<br/>\na little more effort than EQ to just &quot;jump in&quot;.<br/>\n3)  Only 3 races, all human.  (kind of like Human, Erudite and Barbarian).<br/>\nThere are no non-human player races in AC, but they do state that it&#39;s<br/>\npossible that portals may start opening to other worlds so who knows?<br/>\n4)  No Bard Class :(   Nor any bardic skills really.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.  Please don&#39;t flame this is NOT a bash against EverQuest.  It&#39;s just<br/>\na post letting everyone know that Asheron&#39;s Call is a viable alternative<br/>\n(and a lot less frustrating).  I think the best thing I&#39;ve noticed about<br/>\nAsheron&#39;s Call so far is that the game designers actually communicate with<br/>\nthe players.  There also doesn&#39;t seem to be some horrible fear of players<br/>\ngaining levels.  The best example of this is that in Asheron&#39;s Call, good<br/>\ntactics are applauded and rewarded rather than causing a cry of &quot;Exploit&quot;<br/>\nfollowed closely by a Nerf.  In Asheron&#39;s call it&#39;s entirely possible (with<br/>\ngood tactics) to take down creatures four-five levels higher than<br/>\nyourself... solo. And the Game Masters applaud people who figure out how,<br/>\nthey don&#39;t nerf a class just because one or two people figure out how to<br/>\nplay it effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
