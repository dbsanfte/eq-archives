Picked up a slightly used Ashenwood Spear today (no<br/>\nhaste left), but when I&#39;m singing the Anthem de Arms, someone in my group<br/>\nwhose weapons have a slower delay than mine are attacking much faster than I<br/>\nam.  (I&#39;m del 22, she had a del 28 weapon).  It was almost as if she had<br/>\nhaste cast on her or something, and I wasn&#39;t getting any effect at all from<br/>\nthe song.  This went on for a couple hours, so I know she didn&#39;t have<br/>\nanother spell on her. :)  When I solo, my del decreases normally.  Maybe I<br/>\nAM attacking faster, but I still can&#39;t figure out WHY someone with a slower<br/>\nweapon than me would be attacking A LOT faster than I am.  It appeared as<br/>\nthough her del had dropped down to at least 15, if not lower!  I don&#39;t mind,<br/>\nwe chewed through mobs really fast :) it just strikes me as odd.<br/>\n<br/>\n(oh, and I WISH there was a way to recharge items like the spear. :))</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
