I actually blew into the correct end (small end). Now I&#39;m<br/>\nfinally ready to perfect the DDD/CoD/Hymn combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, using a tip from the experts here, I trained my brass skill to max in<br/>\nthe Shady Swashbuckler cave in the tunnel from E Commons to N Ro. Woke up<br/>\nthis morning, scrolled up the messages and saw I was maxed at 95! I think<br/>\nthis is almost as safe as the Arena for uninterrupted instrument training.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, a huge THANK YOU to Harmonic Distortion for letting me tag along<br/>\nyesterday. I&#39;ve got a ton of screenshots of him killing Froon and Choon with<br/>\nCharm (I added my _hefty_ melee skills to help finish off the winner &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\nHe also saved my bardic butt with chain/fear when I got Froon on me before<br/>\nwe were ready. I now have the two Runes from these beasties in the bank<br/>\nwaiting for the day when I&#39;m ready to pursue the rest of the lambent quest<br/>\nitems.
