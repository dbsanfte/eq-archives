On Xegony; when<br/>\nI&#39;m in a place like Sebilis - I hear people &quot;dissing&quot; (on /ooc or /shout)<br/>\nVox raids where it often takes three or more chances to wipe her out.  The<br/>\npeople doing the dissing are often members of larger power guilds - who<br/>\nspent a lot of time killing Vox at a time in the past and now the guilds are<br/>\nall too-high (even with second chars to do it)<br/>\n<br/>\nMore &quot;Mature&quot; players often respond in kind pointing out how many wipeout<br/>\nsaid power-guild (or their predecessors - or the ones that member belonged<br/>\nto at the time) had when they first went after Vox.<br/>\n<br/>\nVox/Nag is usually the first Raid experience for a lot of people; so you<br/>\nhave inexperienced people.  A great many raids are pickup raids; so you&#39;ll<br/>\nhave people not used to fighting with each other fighting together.  Or<br/>\nnewer raids made up of newer players getting to the 46-52 range for the<br/>\nfirst time; and inexperienced raid leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven on a &quot;twink&quot;; an experienced raid leader will probably want to fight<br/>\nsomething else; He&#39;ll want his 53+ friends to help; and there are places<br/>\nwith more loot etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for us bards doing it for scales - higher chars are very useful not just<br/>\nfor buffing; but I&#39;ve seen a Vox raid get wiped out (back in my 46-52 days)<br/>\nwhen Ice Giants spawned while Vox was engaged.  If a group or two of 53+ had<br/>\nbeen in reserve to handle that - it wouldn&#39;t have been an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Roach@...\">Mike.Roach@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 24, 2001 9:27 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] How are people getting the white scales?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, I can&#39;t attest to the skill of the current Vox raiders on E&#39;ci since I<br/>\nhave not been on one yet but it seems to me that from what I observe (and I<br/>\nkeep my ears open) many of the Vox raids on our server end in wipeouts and<br/>\nfailures, at least ones that people I know are involved in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAhh well, how much to white scales sell for on E&#39;ci these days, anyone know?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
