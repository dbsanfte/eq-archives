It aggrivates me to no end to see twinked players <br/>\n&gt;because obviously it&#39;s not fair to the rest of us who actually work our <br/>\n&gt;behinds off for what we have,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>PLEASE explain to me how (unless you are +pvp) what they have has ANY<br/>\nbearing on you whatsoever? The &#39;it&#39;s not fair&#39; portion fairly reeks of &quot;I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t, you can&#39;t&quot;. Right or wrong, this in no way equates to &#39;fair or<br/>\nunfair&#39; since this is not a competition. Last I checked - no one got a<br/>\ncookie for being first to anything here. My neighbor has a caddie - I drive<br/>\na bug - it&#39;s &#39;not fair&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but also because I feel they&#39;re missing out <br/>\n&gt;in part of the game completely. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s so nice to know that the happiness monitor is paying attention<br/>\nand on duty. Really - if THEY are missing out - uhhhhh - is this also any<br/>\nof your or my concern? While I happen to believe in your statement myself,<br/>\nthat is a personal choice - and there is nothing any of us - or Verant for<br/>\nthat matter can substantially do to stop this short of totally<br/>\nrestructuring the way things work. Thankfully - unless you are +pvp - it<br/>\nremoves a huge part of the equation of &#39;affecting others&#39; unfairly or<br/>\nadversely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt great when I was able to afford <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;buying that last piece to my banded armor set. I didn&#39;t get to do that <br/>\n&gt;until after level 10. Yet I see people level 5 walking around with pieces <br/>\n&gt;(or complete sets) of plate armor. If someone offered me a set of plate <br/>\n&gt;would I accept it? Nope. It would totally take away from the game that I <br/>\n&gt;play. If someone offered me a little something for a favor I did them - <br/>\n&gt;sure I&#39;d take it. But not if it was way out of bounds for the favor. It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;not a matter of pride or passing up a great offer - it&#39;s about making the <br/>\n&gt;most out of EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well - my story is much the same, most of my contemporaries have moved onto<br/>\nbronze, I&#39;m still in banded, and likely will be till rubicite, if I ever<br/>\ndecide to move on at all. I am under no compunction to ever advance past<br/>\nwhere I am now - some of us are NOT explorer - adventurer types. I&#39;m happy<br/>\nthat everything in my homeland doesn&#39;t want a piece of me on a stick at<br/>\nthis point - that was my sole level goal. I look at this more as a world to<br/>\nlive in - vs a hack and slash to hit 50 on and finish. Matter of fact - I<br/>\nspend a LOT of time in town, I just wish &#39;clothing&#39; didn&#39;t look like a<br/>\nskimpy one-piece bathing suit on me. I did make it to Qeynos today to get a<br/>\nsilk evening whachmacalit - the one with +5 charisma - guess what, looks<br/>\nlike I&#39;m back in my swimsuit top *sigh*. Npc&#39;s can have nice clothes, why<br/>\ncan&#39;t I?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Twinked players are missing out on so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that depends - is this their first character? Believe me - after<br/>\nplaying UO for 2+ years, and EQ now for a few months, newbieness looses<br/>\nit&#39;s attraction after you&#39;ve already been there done that. Even if THIS<br/>\ncharacter hasn&#39;t - YOU have. Working up thru the lower ranks becomes so<br/>\nmuch repetitive work - and it&#39;s a lot the same for most classes -<br/>\nnewbieness is newbieness all over Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould I give one of my new characters equipment my old had outgrown, hmmm -<br/>\ndepends what it is. Probably, if it&#39;s nothing outlandish. My husband has a<br/>\nhabit of &#39;playing&#39; around with a lot of different classes - although I tell<br/>\nhim when he gets frustrated to wait a bit, all classes are much the same to<br/>\nstart (i.e., you die a lot) he still does it. I will usually give him a<br/>\nsuit of patchwork and a real weapon - ewwww....bigtime twink there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if I ever got my hands on the REALLY nice stuff - I&#39;d still pass it<br/>\ndown, but I&#39;d wait till that character was approaching appropriate level<br/>\nfor it. Not even for any high moral ground, but because all the twinking in<br/>\nthe world isn&#39;t gonna keep a lvl 1 from dieing with GREAT regularity. These<br/>\nfolks that do it before Lvl 5 are really much braver than I. I can see it<br/>\nnow, <br/>\n<br/>\na) Make Newbie<br/>\nb) Give Newbie 5 packpacks of armor and weapons<br/>\nc) Equip Newbie<br/>\nd) Newbie gets his butt handed to him by first bat he sees<br/>\n<br/>\nSERVER DISCONNECTED<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT!  Quick, redial, redial - what someone cut an OC LINE! ARRRRRGGGGGHHH!<br/>\nWHAT DO YOU MEAN VEESHAN IS DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.<br/>\n<br/>\nScratch one very expensive set of equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen enough of these deaths to know that no armor or weapon in the<br/>\ngame is gonna make up for experience points - YOU IS STILL GONNA DIE - that<br/>\nis one thing Verant did very, very well - twinking may be visual, but it<br/>\ndoes NOT makeup for experience points - or knowledge of how things work.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
