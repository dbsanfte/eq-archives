Clerics are a hybrid of<br/>\n&gt; warrior and spellcaster (healing spells).  This is proven by the fact that<br/>\n&gt; they can use heavy metal armor and strong blunt weapons, and can usually<br/>\n&gt; hold their own in battle, yet being a very effective magic class at the<br/>\n&gt; same<br/>\n&gt; time with healing spells.
