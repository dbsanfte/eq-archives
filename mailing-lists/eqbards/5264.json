With many lore items,<br/>\n&gt;8)and even a few<br/>\n&gt;8)non-lore items you receive a message about the item.  For<br/>\n&gt;8)instance, one ogre<br/>\n&gt;8)I happened upon once mentioned someone had given him a human<br/>\n&gt;8)head as a gift,<br/>\n&gt;8)and he wished to know whose it was.  With that song I was<br/>\n&gt;8)able to tell him<br/>\n&gt;8)the name of the disgusting little pet head he carried around<br/>\n&gt;8)with him.  The<br/>\n&gt;8)song is often useful for getting clues with quest items.  I<br/>\n&gt;8)once found a key<br/>\n&gt;8)and used the song to tell me it was a High Hold Strongbox<br/>\n&gt;8)key.  Many of the<br/>\n&gt;8)messages you get from items using this song have not been<br/>\n&gt;8)implemented yet<br/>\n&gt;8)(that&#39;s what pending lore means!).  Bards get a song to learn the lore<br/>\n&gt;8)behind the item, and though the lore might often be<br/>\n&gt;8)pointless, of course<br/>\n&gt;8)bards should know it!  So the song is good.<br/>\n&gt;8)<br/>\n&gt;8)Regardless, I use this song more often that Mellifluous<br/>\n&gt;8)Motion!  Now THERE&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;8)a song I see no purpose for!  It seems to function like the<br/>\n&gt;8)old D&D spell<br/>\n&gt;8)Blink, but for it to be useful at all I think it would need its pulses<br/>\n&gt;8)shortened.  Otherwise it&#39;s just a joke-song, and often a<br/>\n&gt;8)cruel joke at that.<br/>\n&gt;8)<br/>\n&gt;8)Roop </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
