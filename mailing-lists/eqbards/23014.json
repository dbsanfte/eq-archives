It has gotten better than<br/>\nit was in the early 20&#39;s that&#39;s for certain.  But in the 8-12th level range<br/>\nI was constantly amazed at what I could do with a little tactical<br/>\nforethought.  Nowadays I&#39;m mostly amazed at what I can&#39;t do that it would<br/>\nseem I should be able to.  I&#39;m the only hybrid in the guild that can&#39;t stand<br/>\nup to a mob that&#39;s barely green to me and not lose 4 bubbles of health.<br/>\nAdmittedly I can fear chains it, but even then I usually take 1-2 bubbles<br/>\ndue to resists.  Our druid can kill 4 of the same mob all at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a group I see my flexibility increase, I can fill nearly whatever role<br/>\nthe group is missing, but in most of the groups I&#39;ve been in they aren&#39;t<br/>\nmissing any key element.  They usually have a healer, a tank, a nuker, and a<br/>\ncrowd controller.  The next two slots generally get filled with whatever is<br/>\navailable and if its me it means I&#39;m expected to play manasong nearly<br/>\ncontinuously.  Oh and help tank.  Fortunately most groups don&#39;t actually<br/>\nthreaten to kick me out when I refuse to just play manasong in actual<br/>\ncombat.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 11, 2001 2:18 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Proposal to change how bard haste songs stack<br/>\nwith enchanter/sham an haste spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHehehe.. well of course I&#39;m talking out my butt cuz i&#39;m only 39.. maybe it<br/>\nreally gets WORSE.  <br/>\nOr maybe the hard periods are different for every player.. dunno :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHally/Tani<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.

My hard period was around level 23-26.  Of <br/>\n&gt; course, back then<br/>\n&gt; Lullaby was an actual song, not a flashy method of suicide.  <br/>\n&gt; Levels 8-12<br/>\n&gt; were my favorites for a long while I think, Lament and Bellow <br/>\n&gt; were extremely<br/>\n&gt; useful back then and Warsong was still pretty new.
