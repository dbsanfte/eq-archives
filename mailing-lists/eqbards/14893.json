Got too rilled<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  up with posting rants and projects at<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n\t\t\t\t <br/>\n\t\t\t\t  I was testing chains with an enchanter<br/>\nfriend and a shaman friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  Test subject was ice giants.  L43 ice<br/>\ngiants hit max 116, and have<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  on occasion quad attacked me.  Triple<br/>\nattack is not unheard of, and<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  they almost always double attack.  It&#39;s<br/>\nvery easy to see speed <br/>\n\t\t\t\t  differences with these npcs because if<br/>\nthey are not slowed down<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  they usually wipe you out in a few rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  With chains on, will Togors/Shiftless will<br/>\nstick to the npc?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  To test this, I pulled an ice giant with<br/>\nchains and kept chaining<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  it until the shaman or enchanter would<br/>\nslow it down.  I then stopped<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  using chains.  The ice giant was swinging<br/>\nat the speed I would expect<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  for those spells applied.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  With Togors/Shiftless already on the npc,<br/>\nwill chains break it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  I pixie striked an ice giant out and let<br/>\nit chase me around<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  until the shaman or enchanter would cast<br/>\non it.  Then chains<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  were applied and were left to wear off.<br/>\nThe ice giant did<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  not return to it&#39;s typical crushing speed.<br/>\nIt stayed at it&#39;s<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  slowed pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  Which is more powerful?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  Well all the tools I&#39;ve seen to analyze<br/>\nthe spells conclude that<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  chains and shiftless deeds are equivalent<br/>\nin the attack speed<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  amount, and togors falls a little behind<br/>\nthem.  This just isn&#39;t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  the case.  With togors/shiftless on an<br/>\nnpc, I can count seconds<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  before they attempt to swing.  With<br/>\nchains, it&#39;s kinda like a <br/>\n\t\t\t\t  small visual decrease but nothing fancy.<br/>\nChains is nice for <br/>\n\t\t\t\t  the mobility effect, but can be outdone by<br/>\nother atkspeed spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  I also camped the live side king a week<br/>\nand a half ago and had similar<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  results with both a shaman and enchanter<br/>\nin the group.  Chains just<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  didn&#39;t seem to impact the speed component<br/>\nat all, yet it provided<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  the negative movement component just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  I need someone to confirm these<br/>\nconclusions.  I&#39;d prefer the tests<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  be done on ice giants, because it is<br/>\nglaringly evident when they <br/>\n\t\t\t\t  attack if their speed is normal, chained,<br/>\nor togors/shiftless.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tGet what you deserve with NextCard Visa.<br/>\nZERO.
