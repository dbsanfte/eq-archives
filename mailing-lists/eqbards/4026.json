I&#39;ve played bards in AD&D for about as long as I<br/>\nhave been playing, only to have other people that I RPG with snigger and ask<br/>\nwhy I would want to. EQ, like some of the other MUD&#39;s I have played over the<br/>\nyears, really does a good job at making the bard fun to play. It&#39;s great to<br/>\nrandomly group with people who say things like &quot;You bards kick ass&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;Travelling with a bard in the party is a pleasure.&quot; Now if we could just<br/>\ncharm lots of mobs at lower levels I&#39;d be in heaven.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay on to more serious business. I completed the Ogre Head Quest in<br/>\nButcherblock last night by dropping off the heads of two named Ogres<br/>\n(Corflunk and Zarcoomi) to Byzar Bloddforge in Kaladim. As a reward I<br/>\nreceived a Blackened Iron Crown<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Blackened.Iron.Crown.html)\">http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Blackened.Iron.Crown.html)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nwhich I thought was pretty nifty. This morning I was browsing Everlore and<br/>\nsomeone had remarked that this item had been sold at auction for 250pp. I<br/>\njust about passed out with dreams of avarice. Anyone have an idea if this is<br/>\neven near to being true? If so I am camping in BB for a while longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn<br/>\nBalladeer or the 11th Verse, small trinkets dealer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 20, 1999 12:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Center of attention<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, one thing I like about this group is you all<br/>\n&gt; actually LIKE playing a bard.  That may sound silly<br/>\n&gt; but a lot of message boards out there are just<br/>\n&gt; whinning about the class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I had heard about the &#39;tauting&#39; effects of our<br/>\n&gt; songs, but for the most part, it never bothered me,<br/>\n&gt; sure I get the mobs attention, and even take a lot of<br/>\n&gt; dammage, no biggie, just make nice with the cleric.<br/>\n&gt; Well, after turning 21, Guk and Unrest have become<br/>\n&gt; whole new places.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First guk, near the scryer room my party of six where<br/>\n&gt; bashing every froglock in sight, gaining massive exp<br/>\n&gt; and loot.  So we say, what the heck, lets go in the<br/>\n&gt; room.  Well, on knight comes after us, so I use my<br/>\n&gt; melodic binding song that I love so much.  Big<br/>\n&gt; mistake, from behind one of our tanks I saw no less<br/>\n&gt; than 15 assorted froglocks come up the stairs, and who<br/>\n&gt; do you think they were headed for?  Well, after about<br/>\n&gt; 5 minutes of root, root, root, root, I was taking the<br/>\n&gt; long walk back from freeport.  Get back, grab my<br/>\n&gt; stuff, play anthem for my friends in battle, and what<br/>\n&gt; do you think happened?  Again, I&#39;m dragged down under<br/>\n&gt; a sea of amphibious flesh.  So after a while, I say,<br/>\n&gt; heck, I&#39;ll head over to good ole unrest, what could be<br/>\n&gt; safer?  Get there, find some good friends I could<br/>\n&gt; trust, and we get to slayin undead.  One of the dry<br/>\n&gt; bones makes a run for the house, silly bard that I am,<br/>\n&gt; I chase him, again, still singing a song, forget which<br/>\n&gt; one.  Withing seconds the doors fly open and carrion,<br/>\n&gt; monks and the reclusive ghoul magi beeline right at<br/>\n&gt; the wide eyed me, who didn&#39;t even have time to type in<br/>\n&gt; a profanity.  So I come back from butchers block.<br/>\n&gt; Fighting a while, see a wisp to the left of the house,<br/>\n&gt; facing the back.  Someone in my guild needed a light<br/>\n&gt; stone, so I run to grab it, while singing my little<br/>\n&gt; anthem.  All of a sudden, the hag 3 floors up starts<br/>\n&gt; casting on me from a window, and I wake up at home<br/>\n&gt; among the trees.  That sucked.  Does this mean we<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t use any of our aoe or buffs anywhere near a<br/>\n&gt; dungeon?  Well, at least my calves are built up from<br/>\n&gt; zone running :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Llewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n&gt; 21rst song<br/>\n&gt; E Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
