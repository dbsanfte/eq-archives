I&#39;ve heard that all faction can now be fixed<br/>\nexcept that which has no positive faction quests of any sort.  And the negative PoG factions (aside from<br/>\nthe ones inside PoG itself) can be fixed by running around Crushbone with AE songs on (to get to dubious),<br/>\nthen giving a ton of muffins to Pandos (that guy&#39;s a pig).

Pulling in PoG is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; breeze when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have lightning speed. In my experience, many things have SoW<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or better, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the bard will have the best time making it back to the ambush<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unharmed (or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dead).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also..
