Immediately after you zone<br/>\nand start turning, the game loads (I&#39;m guessing) zone info to<br/>\ndraw buildings and terrain in your field of view.  It hits the<br/>\ndisk then.  I suspect having a slower hard disk (mine is 7200<br/>\nrpm with a 6ms seek time) may actually be an advantage when<br/>\nthis happens, as the CPU isn&#39;t as tied up handling the data<br/>\nfrom the disk.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also happens when I go to the FP bank.  From the area where<br/>\nthe jeweler and cleric&#39;s guild are, you have to go through a<br/>\nseries of sharp turns to get to the bank area.  I usually end<br/>\nup doing a 180 on that first turn, as the game loads in the<br/>\ninfo for the buildings in the new area.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
