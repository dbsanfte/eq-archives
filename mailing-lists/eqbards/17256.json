I cant imagine who thinks you need 150+ cha to be effective.  I dont<br/>\nhave that kind of cha and do as well as can be expected.  It&#39;s good to be<br/>\nthinking ahead and high str and cha that you have rolled seem just fine to<br/>\nme.  I am considering that sta might be worth while as it is rather hard to<br/>\nadd later on where both str and cha can be boosted with items as well as agi<br/>\nand dex.  Stamina in stats adds to you hp and ac I think (or is it only<br/>\np?)  - yes we have a sta song and depending on your weps (and friends to<br/>\nbuff you) you can use that.  In EQ today, Level is God, AC Is King, and<br/>\nresists are your best friends.  All the other stats are marginal after you<br/>\nget them to a decent level (around 100 or so).<br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure to send me a /tell next time you are online and I might have some<br/>\nstuff to help get you started.

I went with 95 str and 90 cha. I have been going<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; cha over other stats. I got +7 cha +5 dex rings and the earings that add<br/>\n+5<br/>\n&gt; cha and +2 ac. thats 114 cha. I am more of a team player then a soloest! I<br/>\n&gt; was wondering if thats enough cha. Or should I go back and remake my bard<br/>\n&gt; with more cha and less str, because I was told by a bard in the game you<br/>\n&gt; need 150+ cha to do anything with your songs like charm and croud control<br/>\n&gt; above 30+ in level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is this true?!?!?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vandle Of Innorrk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
