I think 42 is ok if you go with an <br/>\nexperienced raiding party and if they need bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know for a pick up Naggie raid that we only had 3 wizards, which my guild <br/>\nsaid was way too little (and it turned out to be true). I&#39;m not sure how <br/>\ndifferent Vox is, but I don&#39;t believe anyone in my group died from breathe <br/>\nweapons from Naggie. They all got clawed to death as it took us way too <br/>\nlong to kill him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of different things required for a successful dragon raid and <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have to rely on the raid leader to know what he/she is doing as well <br/>\nas the pull group.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust remember, if you go on a large raid, listen to everything the raid <br/>\nleader says and obey her/him. Also, do not go on the raid expecting to <br/>\nreceive experience or loot. Make sure you know ahead of time that you <br/>\nunderstand what the raid leader&#39;s rules for loot are so that you aren&#39;t <br/>\ndisappointed. Some will make seemingly arbitrary decisions (only warriors <br/>\nshould roll for such and such an item), but that&#39;s their rule, just be <br/>\naware of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, realize that if the raid doesn&#39;t go well, you&#39;ve got to stay and help <br/>\nfor corpse recovery. Not glamorous, but the most important people are the <br/>\nclerics and the people who supply them with mana (enchanters/bards), necros <br/>\nfor corpse recovery, and someone to transport you guys out when all is said <br/>\nand done (wizzie/druid).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you find a good guild who have some fun people you can hang out with <br/>\nand are experienced at organizing raids.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf Mistsong<br/>\n49th level balladeer, Ahead of Musiker for a little bit :-P<br/>\nRed Sky<br/>\nBertox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:03 AM 5/18/01 +0200, Henrik Holm wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Yeah I think that sounds about right.
