That was my question, how often does a level 47+ person ever get<br/>\n&gt; hit for 10 points or less?  Anyone out there who can answer that?  As it is<br/>\n&gt; a 10 pt damage shield would stop pretty much only the 1 pt hits I get.  I<br/>\n&gt; seldom get hit for more than 1 and less than 10.  Do hit point shields<br/>\n&gt; prevent damage from fire shields and the like?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  You guys are reading into the numbers too closely.

Or are used in some formula.  Hymm says<br/>\n  Healing: 1, Anthem says Strength: 5, for example.  We all know <br/>\n  Hymm doesn&#39;t heal one point, nor does Anthem only give 5 strength.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I will do a little research and repost the info I have found.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
