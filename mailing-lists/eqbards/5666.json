Also<br/>\nit may have had spirit sight cast on it by another nearby mob. Aside from<br/>\nthis I know some Undead see invis just fine whil others not at all. I have<br/>\nhad Festering hags not see me if they are green to me, and then a blue one<br/>\nsees me and scowls. I have walked all the way into the ghost room unmolested<br/>\nand other times a greater skel or hag will see me. In lower guk all the<br/>\nghouls see invis just fine, while in upper all that can see me is the Warden<br/>\nand the Lord. I never trust past experience with invis in any area I dont<br/>\nknow as gospel. Unrest is one of those places you never know whats going to<br/>\nhappen next, I dont care how long you have played there.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, August 26, 1999 8:48 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Mid-level songs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 26 Aug 1999, Talies the Wanderer wrote:<br/>\n&gt; At 08:23 PM 8/25/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Almost every time I think something saw through my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;invisibility, I scroll back and the message immediately before<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I was attacked is &quot;you become visible.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hrm - there has always been some error with the cause and effect timing.<br/>\n&gt; Notice how whenever you are bashed, your song ends *before* the monster<br/>\n&gt; bashes you?
