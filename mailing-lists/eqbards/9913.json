I just got the song a few nights ago, and while<br/>\nfighting in Rathe Mts. I&#39;ve noticed sometimes I&#39;ll fire it up on giant<br/>\nskelies (blue to me) and nothing, no message, no fear.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tI do love it when it works though!  Especially on red clops, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOne word of warning, don&#39;t use it unless you know which way the<br/>\nthing is gonna run.  Was in Cazic at the steps to the temple, and feared<br/>\none, hoping it would run up the steps, get brave, and run back down.  Nope,<br/>\nit ran right into the maze and brought back 2 friends.  Fortunately the<br/>\ngroup had 2 enchanters, so they could control them till we killed them all.<br/>\nLast time (hopefully) I&#39;ll make that mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien - Karana<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
