Since I&#39;m gonna try my hat at soloing for a while, think I<br/>\nmight start having this song memorized.  Its too bad that it won&#39;t teleport<br/>\nthe entire party to the same random location.  Do you guys think this is<br/>\nsomething that we should ask Verant to consider changing somewhere down the<br/>\nroad?  Since it would help the entire party, and doesn&#39;t impact solo play at<br/>\nall, it shouldn&#39;t be a class balance issue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  of the village.  Since I won&#39;t get levitate for a long time, was<br/>\n&gt; wondering<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I sing that song<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while at the top of the village (or any high altitude location), will I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; appear at the same altitude over the ground, and as a result take lots<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage due to falling?  Or will I end up on the ground wherever the song<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sends me to? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 21 - Mellifluous Motion<br/>\n&gt; Effect: Random teleport<br/>\n&gt; Instrument: Wind, enhances distance teleported(?)<br/>\n&gt; Target: Party<br/>\n&gt; Does not stack with: N/A<br/>\n&gt; Taunt: ??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Quantified: ??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Comments: Teleports you and your party members a random distance in a<br/>\n&gt; random direction.  The distance seems to be dependent on level and whether<br/>\n&gt; or not you&#39;re using a wind instrument.  It might&#39;ve been marginally useful<br/>\n&gt; as a group escape tool, except it teleports each group member to a<br/>\n&gt; different random location.  It will not teleport you through walls or<br/>\n&gt; closed doors.  It will place you at ground level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
