Though it nets no<br/>\nreal cash to speak of, I thought what the hell. I have some<br/>\nthoughts/questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Bards should inherently be good at this skill and maybe should have bard<br/>\nonly recipes or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. AND THIS IS A RANT...why the hell are there no recipes for taking the<br/>\nskill past 135? I tire of the &quot;not yet implemented&quot; excuse. Grrr....we are<br/>\nstill in beta if something like a trade skill is not complete. RANT COMPLETE<br/>\n<br/>\n3. What is the recipe for Bog Juice? Surely some fellow bards have taken up<br/>\nbrewing. And while I have brewed everything and searched high and low for<br/>\nthis recipe I cannot find it...though I hear the quest for this is broken<br/>\ntoo. grrr<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Did 19 prove to be a difficult level for you that made it passed? I seem<br/>\nto be wallowing in low 19.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nCleaver, Fennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
