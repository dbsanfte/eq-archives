They reset it for you?  One of my guild leaders, who <br/>\n&gt; has spent a <br/>\n&gt; great deal of time studying Kedge, figured out that there are <br/>\n&gt; specific MOBs <br/>\n&gt; who, if killed, cause an additional guardian to spawn.  <br/>\n&gt; Seeing a dozen isn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; at all unusual if you wait too long after a server reset.  If <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll reset <br/>\n&gt; that, it&#39;s an interesting thing to know.  Right now, we just <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t bother with <br/>\n&gt; Phinny if it&#39;s been more than a few days since the last reset.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kenross Cantoforjado, 47.6 songs, Innoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
