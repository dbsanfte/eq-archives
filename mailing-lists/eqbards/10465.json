When they are in Melee and doing an Autoattack the bow is<br/>\n&gt;not being used. I think they can&#39;t even use the button when autoattacking.<br/>\n&gt;So the Ranged slot is linked solely to a button that cannot be used in<br/>\n&gt;combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tTo map this out for instruments how would it work? If we have an instrument<br/>\n&gt;in the instrument slot and weapons in the melee slots do we use the weapons<br/>\n&gt;in combat and automatically use the instruments when we are not fighting?<br/>\n&gt;(hey!) Are the instruments enabled in combat? What if we have two weaps and<br/>\n&gt;a lute equipped and we use ADM(lev 22) which requires a stringed instrument?<br/>\n&gt;How about bonuses obtained from certain instruments like the increased<br/>\n&gt;healing rate of the Seven Stringed Lute? What if the rumors of weapons that<br/>\n&gt;grant instrument abilities come to be? Those super beneficial effects would<br/>\n&gt;be rendered not so spectacular since I believe the biggest thing from all of<br/>\n&gt;this is because we have to weapon switch. Also what is the difficulties in<br/>\n&gt;dropping a new slot on the screen? Would it have the same impact as the<br/>\n&gt;whole barbarian shield thing requiring a 10+meg download?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tIt is difficult to say since there is no other class that must have an item<br/>\n&gt;in a certain slot to produce a constant effect. Sure you have the bows and<br/>\n&gt;ranged attacks but that is a one-keypress-one-use sort of thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tPersonally I thought the whole ranged slot was hokey to begin with. Just<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t make sense to be able to pull a bow out of your (select inventory<br/>\n&gt;location), fire the bow almost immediately, and then start swinging.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tActually after typing this out, and assuming the graphic change wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;bad, I think this would work well (just ignore the above ramblings):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tIf we have an instrument in the instrument slot and weapons in the melee<br/>\n&gt;slots we use the weapons in combat and automatically use the instruments<br/>\n&gt;when we are not fighting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tWe would still need to switch instruments though...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tGood Journey,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;8)From: RaceFace [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;8)Sent: Sunday, November 21, 1999 6:48 PM<br/>\n&gt;8)To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;8)Subject: Re: [eqbards] Skill Caps<br/>\n&gt;8)<br/>\n&gt;8)<br/>\n&gt;8)From: &quot;RaceFace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bean@...\">bean@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;8)<br/>\n&gt;8)<br/>\n&gt;8)I /feedback&#39;d this a while ago.
