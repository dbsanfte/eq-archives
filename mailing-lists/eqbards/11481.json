BUT she soon found my range of my weapons and my minimum range<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the bow (meaning she was too close for me to fire). and she was always out<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of range or too close for me to fire the bow. Now that said She on the<br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hand could run me down even snared if she was singing the celos<br/>\n&gt;&gt; acceleration. HOW is it even possible for a melee type to beat a Bard they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have to face you to hit you,cus they have an AOE with a huge range<br/>\n&gt;on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it, they can hit you with a DD well out of the range of the bow you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; root them cus the sow song breaks it. if they stand toe to toe with you<br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ghet stomped pretty bad but all they have to do is back off a bit and run<br/>\n&gt;&gt; from you for a sec or two to regen. In my opinion the bards are the most<br/>\n&gt;&gt; unbalanced class in the game.  I can easily take down a wizzy or necro<br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; out much problem if I can ever get a root off on em a warror is a joke<br/>\n&gt;once<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you hit em with snare and have plenty of arrows,  I have not tried to<br/>\n&gt;fight<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a druid or shamen yet but, at least I feel it is possible for me to beat<br/>\n&gt;em.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am not so sure about a bard. anyone got any advise.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kaymen Darkwater<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 20th Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Tribunal<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
