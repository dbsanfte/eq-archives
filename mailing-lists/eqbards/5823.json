Things that 2 days ago<br/>\nI could charm, fear, or chain with now problem were<br/>\nnow getting 3 or 4 resists in a row.  Things like<br/>\nlizard men in cazic and aviaks out at KFC (Karana<br/>\nFried Chicken).  All things that conned blue to me,<br/>\nbut were seemingly unimpressed with my vocal a talent.<br/>\n Am I out of my mind?  I didn&#39;t have any charisma<br/>\nitems one (except for my veil) so my charisma was only<br/>\n95.  Could that be it?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more humourous note, I was passing through the<br/>\nRathe Mountains and saw that big skele so I chamed<br/>\nhim, he was standing by an orc shaman so I told him to<br/>\nattack it.  The fought, the charm wore off, and before<br/>\nthe skele came at me, the shaman cast SOW on it. <br/>\nCouldn&#39;t believe it.  So I recharmed the skele who<br/>\nthen made short work of the shaman.  Me and my pet ran<br/>\ndown the road where couple of trolls where camping<br/>\nlizard men.  As soon as they heard the big feet o<br/>\nstompin, they scattered.  Had to send them a tell to<br/>\nlet them know he was my pet.  My biggest complaint<br/>\nabout the charm song is that it&#39;s so freakin fun that<br/>\nI spend 50% more time goofing off.  Oh well.  One more<br/>\nquestion, do you not get exp for a creature your pet<br/>\nkills? Twice I had a rook kill another rook and got no<br/>\nexp for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven<br/>\n&quot;I level like old dwarves make love, slow and sloppy&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
