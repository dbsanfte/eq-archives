But I really doubt if this is Bard<br/>\n&gt; Dancing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have seen the anim of the Male bard that looks kind<br/>\n&gt; of like a Pied Piper jumping on eggs when the male<br/>\n&gt; bard plays the flute. I can only assume this is the<br/>\n&gt; dancing that people are talking about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do we have another DANCE anim ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Laters,<br/>\n&gt; Songer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Send instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
