There are other<br/>\nweapons that would do just as well.  You might want to<br/>\ncheck out the bard weapon section of maximumeg as the<br/>\ncomments and going price listed there will help you<br/>\ntarget the weapon you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours in Song<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Lilyana Dearheart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lilyanatwin@...\">Lilyanatwin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello fellow Bards!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am new to the list and I would like to say that it<br/>\n&gt; is wonderful the<br/>\n&gt; information that is shared among the bards of EQ. I<br/>\n&gt; am a lvl 11 Bard on the<br/>\n&gt; Karana server and I need some information please.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My bard is a half-elf and I currently have a full<br/>\n&gt; set of bronze armor and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; equipped with a Turtle-shell Helm and I have a<br/>\n&gt; barbed leather whip and the<br/>\n&gt; screaming mace for weapons. I currently have the<br/>\n&gt; standard instruments, the<br/>\n&gt; drum for the spidersilk quest and a mandolin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My question is this....what kind of armor, weapons,<br/>\n&gt; and instruments would be<br/>\n&gt; worthy of investment for me at this point?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My finances are slightly better, though not great,<br/>\n&gt; than a normal lvl 11 as my<br/>\n&gt; bard is my secondary character, albeit quickly<br/>\n&gt; becoming primary because I love<br/>\n&gt; being a bard!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any help and advice would be greatly<br/>\n&gt; appreciated....Thanks!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; V/R,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Melodii (Bard of 11 seasons)<br/>\n&gt; Lilyana (Paladin of 17 seasons)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account<br/>\n&gt; today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
