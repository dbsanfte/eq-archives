First, consider<br/>\nit a NON-combat song in many ways.  If you sneak up on a goblin camp, and<br/>\nspy four of the beasts, grab your lute and make three &quot;sad&quot; while they<br/>\nloiter about.  If you approach and attack the fourth, you will notice the<br/>\nother three &quot;sad&quot; goblins will not join the fray.  You can then back off a<br/>\nbit and fight the sole goblin, effectively picking each one off one at a<br/>\ntime in this manner!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd who says Bards aren&#39;t built for Soloing?<br/>\n<br/>\nMust say the song came in handy in the Qeynos sewers, as a way to pacify an<br/>\nespecially mean-looking NPC as I swam past.  And O how I used it on my<br/>\njourney from Kelethin, really made the Highold Pass a Cakewalk Pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
