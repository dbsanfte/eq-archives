Evolution of the language is<br/>\nnot a bad thing, it is a necessity of life, get used to it.  With thinking<br/>\nlike this we would still be speaking Middle English, at best, and having<br/>\nserious discussions would be extremely dificult, if not impossible.  Logic<br/>\nlike you profess would make progress equally impossible.  Would you still<br/>\nhave us refer to computers as Babbage computational engines?  I think not.<br/>\nLanguage evolves, into many branches, in many directions.  Some things<br/>\nbecome part of the mainstream language, others are cast aside as being<br/>\ntrivial to the general public.  <br/>\n\tThere is no rudeness involved, no malice, simply a desire to<br/>\ncommunicate more quickly.  There is no conspiracy, period.  People do not<br/>\nsit around dreaming up jargon in order to keep others in the dark, they<br/>\ncreate it to make it easier to communicate with those who understand it,<br/>\nbecause those are the people they most need to communicate to.  <br/>\n\tWhen an intelligent person encounters a term he doesn&#39;t understand,<br/>\nhe asks or looks it up.  The only stupid question is the one that isn&#39;t<br/>\nasked.<br/>\n\tOh and by the way, IBM is an acronym as well.  But tell someone you<br/>\nwork for International Business Machines and see how many people in the<br/>\ngeneral populace make the connection.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM systems difficult<br/>\n&gt;and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>\n&gt;companies moved away from secret code. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
