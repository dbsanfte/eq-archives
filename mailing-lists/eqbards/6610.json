This &quot;fear&quot;, due to the current<br/>\nway the Plane of Fear works, is that 1) they will automatically die and lose<br/>\nhard earned experience and 2) most likely not be able to recover their<br/>\ncorpse. Thats some bad mojo and rightfully so.  I agree something needs to<br/>\nbe done about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I will use myself as an example.  I&#39;m a 22d level bard.  Suppose I was<br/>\nconsidering camping the basement in Unrest or the castle in Mistmoore.  I<br/>\nuse these places as examples because I would almost certainly die if I went<br/>\nto these locations.  My reservation about going to these places is for all<br/>\npractical purposes the same &quot;fear&quot; that the 46+ level players are having.<br/>\nThe only difference is that I have a better chance of recovering my corpse.<br/>\nIf my corpse is deep in the basement, I couldn&#39;t do it myself but I could<br/>\nget the assistance of someone much higher level than me to protect me while<br/>\nI was recovering my corpse.  46+ characters don&#39;t have the luxury of someone<br/>\nhigher helping them retrieve their corpse so, IMO, thats the only difference<br/>\nbetween me camping the basement in Unrest versus them camping the Plane of<br/>\nFear.  You could argue that this luxury makes a world of difference and<br/>\nmakes the entire analogy invalid.  I could be totally offbase here so take<br/>\nit with a grain of salt.  It does make for an interesting, allbeit<br/>\noff-topic, discussion:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, the Plane of Fear, as well as all others, should have something magical<br/>\nabout them that takes into account that the Norrathian laws of physics and<br/>\nmagic don&#39;t apply in the planes.  Thats pretty much how it works in most<br/>\nfantasy games I&#39;m aware of.  Verant even stated when the Fear plane opened<br/>\nup that magic worked different in there.  In order to do that, they need to<br/>\nadd the magical fear, hate, etc. element (or something along the same line)<br/>\nI discussed in my original post.  Obviously if they were to do that, they<br/>\nwould have to do some major tweaking of how the planes work.  Offensive<br/>\ncapabilities of the mobs would need to be reduced to the point where, when<br/>\ncombined with the ideas I proposed, a players chance of survival is<br/>\nnear/equal that of what it was before the Plane of Fear was tweaked to the<br/>\npoint of where it is now.  Bottom line is that characters should, with a lot<br/>\nskill, good planning, and a little luck, have the chance to go to the Planes<br/>\n(or anywhere for that matter) and afterwards sit around the campfire and<br/>\ncelebrate their accomplishment.  Verant will get it fixed eventually (we all<br/>\nhope).   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy brain hurts after this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Heh what your suggesting would make the zones worse then it is now.<br/>\n&gt; Believe<br/>\n&gt; me being thrown halfway across zone is enough don&#39;t need anything else<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; that added.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Just an idea, but perhaps Verant could reduce the toughness of the<br/>\n&gt; combats<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in the Planes so people have a better chance of survival but also make<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Planes somehow reflect what they are.  For example, in Fear, the players<br/>\n&gt; &gt;magic resist rate gets periodically checked to see if they become scared.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Could be at anytime, in combat or while they are sitting around.  If so,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they start fleeing in a random direction.  In Hate, make it where a<br/>\n&gt; player<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can, if they fail their resist, become consumed by irrational hate and<br/>\n&gt; start<br/>\n&gt; &gt;attacking anything nearby, monsters or players.  In Fire, players are hit<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;constant heat that affects health and/or stamina.  In Air, constant gales<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that cause damage.  I came up with these on the fly so I&#39;m sure there are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other things that could be done similar to these.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t think this is a problem I will have to worry about for another<br/>\n&gt; year<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or so.  By that time, who knows how the game will work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;22 bard </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
