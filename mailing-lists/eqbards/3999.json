This combo is quite effective, though I might want<br/>\nto try wielding a barbed leather whip in the secondary.  Mostly I cannot<br/>\nsay enough about the dragoon dirk, it is an awesome weapon that will serve<br/>\nyou for quite a while.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTreilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 20 Jul 1999, Elena Glenn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Elena Glenn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braveheart@...\">braveheart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How would a combination of a tentacle whip and a Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>\n&gt; be?  I have both, and was planning on using them at level 17 for dual wield.<br/>\n&gt; Which shoud be the primary weapon, or is there a better combo?  I also have<br/>\n&gt; a Dragoon Dirk.

Then last nite i was given a Tenticle whip by a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;guildmate and WOW !!!!! I was hitting about every 2 sec. in fighting a<br/>\n&gt; Giant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spider I was getting 3 to 4 swings to every 1 of the spiders.  I must say<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that if ye have the means(17pp) pick one up.
