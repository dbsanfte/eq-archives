At the same time it also effects our DOT songs (lvls 2,18,30,38,46,49) after having int higher that 100 increases damage by 5%. I think the next magic number is around 120ish then 144ish. I have not been able to get enough int to test these. But at 99 and less int lvl 30 38 and 46 songs with selos drum played once in a twist does 315 dam at lvl 46. With 100 int it did 331. There are TWO songs at this point that use mana, lvl 39 charm and lvl 43 dirge. At lvl 43 a bard has just enough mana to play Dirge song once. <br/>\nBTW - most parts to the bard planer armor has a int bonus not a wis bonus. Hmmm... could be a hint :) <br/>\n<br/>\nPinene Myrcene <br/>\nLvl 48 Bard<br/>\nLeader of the Wandering Minstrels -- Bristalbain<br/>\n<br/>\nMy primary offense these days is in songs - Chant series and when able the CoD, DDD, CoC medly - with planar/dragon instruments.  So, if int is a good boost then I am gonna rob my wizzy twink of his int gear!  &lt;j/k&gt; One reason I give some creedence to this is the blurb in the original user manual that said INT was a component in bard song effectiveness.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
