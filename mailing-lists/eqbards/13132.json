The Archon Temple is fun to hold and great<br/>\nexperience when held in a sportsmanlike fashion, however, I am only human<br/>\nand have used these pieces of information to save my cute bardic ass a few<br/>\ntimes when I&#39;ve gotten into a jam.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Archon Temple is very buggy pathwise.  There are two primary ways in<br/>\nwhich groups exploit this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) A puller is SoWed and (with or without levitation) runs down the tiers<br/>\nand away from the Archon&#39;s steps to pull.  He punches a lizard in the nose<br/>\nand runs back to the group at the base of the steps.  Generally speaking<br/>\nthat lizard hasn&#39;t followed him back, it is somewhere away from the Archon<br/>\nsteps, aggrod and &quot;frozen&quot;.  Quite often groups will curse the bad pathing<br/>\nand run to the lizard to defeat it (nothing wrong with that).  However, if<br/>\nthe puller stands *on the steps* themselves at the Archon Temple top, the<br/>\nlizard will unfreeze and run to the puller at the steps.  To be perfectly<br/>\nclear: You MUST stand upon the steps for the mobs to come to you.<br/>\nTherefore, the puller&#39;s presence on the steps becomes something of an on/off<br/>\nswitch for mob activity and movement.  The exploit part of this occurs once<br/>\nthese lizards have come to the puller at the steps.  If the puller to whom<br/>\nthe lizards are aggrod removes himself from the steps they will once again<br/>\n&quot;freeze&quot; due to the pathing bug.  The group can now fire at will with little<br/>\nchance of the lizards leaving the steps to actively engaging them in melee.<br/>\nOther melee members of the party can sometimes melee the lizard on the steps<br/>\nin safety - it&#39;s as though the hate list of these buggy lizards doesn&#39;t<br/>\nreorganize itself.  Regardless of the damage others do to them, the lizards<br/>\nremain aggrod on the first guy that bonked them on the head.  If the lizards<br/>\n*do* engage in melee, the entire party can move away from the steps to the<br/>\nfirst 90 degree corner (either seems to work) and the lizards have another<br/>\nvery good chance of freezing when the party reaches the corner.  A group<br/>\nthat knows how to work the pathing of the lizards up there can have a *very*<br/>\nsafe time of taking out lizzies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in groups that had the puller deliberately go out and smack as<br/>\nmany lizzies as possible to create a 12 liz train to the Archon.  Once<br/>\nthere, the puller stands on the steps and takes a bit of abuse while all the<br/>\nlizards catch up.  Then the puller does his best to arrange the lizards into<br/>\nas closely knit a group as possible on the steps, then jumps from the steps<br/>\nfreezing them all in place.  Wizards and Mages then AE the whole bundle down<br/>\nat their leisure.  I quickly departed these groups because this is BORING as<br/>\nhell, and actually not any faster (I&#39;d argue slower) than a good<br/>\nold-fashioned fight or three.  The only reason I was invited was as a mana<br/>\npump for the casters.  Basically I was to stand around watching and playing<br/>\nClarity continuously.  Forget it - the Throne Room is more fun and better<br/>\npotential loot in that case.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Mobs that are aggrod to a party cannot reach the actual flat top of the<br/>\ntemple.  If (when) trains of lizards occur, simply run up the sloped walls<br/>\nof the Archon&#39;s Temple and you will be both out of melee range and out of<br/>\nspell range.  The mobs will remain aggrod on you, but will mill around on<br/>\nthe Archon steps.  Casters can cast on the lizards from here in relative<br/>\nsafety (this is an confirmed exploit by Verant, you can get BANNED if caught<br/>\ndoing this).  Large races will either need a levitation (maybe a shrink<br/>\nwould work too) or old Guise of the Deceiver in order for them to reach the<br/>\ntop.  If the situation with the lizards gets unmanageable, simply camp out<br/>\nup here and come back to clear their aggro lists.  All members of your party<br/>\nmust camp for this to work.  I have camped overnight on the top here many<br/>\ntimes.  Lizards simply cannot get up here, and the two or three times that<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen it they 32k (suicide) themselves.  I have *never* heard that<br/>\nrunning to the top to escape lizards is an exploit, only that casting from<br/>\nhere is.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse your knowledge wisely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what you are saying is that because pathing is screwed up at the top of<br/>\n&gt; the temple, mobs standing on the steps will not move down to the bottom of<br/>\n&gt; the steps and attack anyone standing there?  That may explain why I rarely<br/>\n&gt; got attacked.  I was standing at the bottom of the steps along with the<br/>\n&gt; cleric and enchanter.  The other three characters were on the steps<br/>\n&gt; meleeing. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
