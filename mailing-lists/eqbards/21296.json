Both David Allen,<br/>\n&gt;the president and CEO, and Doug Shuler, the art director and visual<br/>\n&gt;designer, were extremely personable and open to suggestions from those in<br/>\n&gt;attendance.  Having known Doug personally for several years, I am confident<br/>\n&gt;this was not a put on to garner interest.  Both were praiseful of much that<br/>\n&gt;Verant has accomplished, but both were also equally horrified and confused<br/>\n&gt;over the way Verant treats its customers.  It was that treatment, over and<br/>\n&gt;above everything else that inspired them to go out and put together a team<br/>\n&gt;to make a game that was willing to treat its players the way they wanted to<br/>\n&gt;see them treated.  I hope they get it right.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
