When the quest<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; finally fixed a couple months back, people were creating 1st level mule<br/>\n&gt; characters to kill the koalindl fish at the Temple of Life in Qeynos.<br/>\n&gt; This<br/>\n&gt; allowed them to avoid the major faction hit with their main character.<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; mule character then gave the fish to the main character ( I admit I did<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; but only because my faction got screwed earlier by trying to complete the<br/>\n&gt; quest legitimately before it got fixed).  To complete the quest now, the<br/>\n&gt; same person has to acquire all the quest components.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the best way Verant could handle this is to make quest components<br/>\n&gt; NO<br/>\n&gt; TRADE and keep magic items NO DROP.  That way, you could put quest<br/>\n&gt; components in the bank until you got them all and eliminates using mule<br/>\n&gt; characters to collect the items.  This would also allow Verant to start<br/>\n&gt; giving better rewards for quests because it ensures that the player<br/>\n&gt; completes all the necessary steps and earn the reward.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another thing, although not specifically bard related except in that<br/>\n&gt; bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably do more quests than anyone else simply because they can, is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; constant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I went to the bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 containers from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I would have to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does Verant think<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solution to everything is to make an item no drop.  Bizzarely the<br/>\n&gt; Bozemite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the use for is now<br/>\n&gt; No<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Drop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires considerable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; faction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go figure.  Why<br/>\n&gt; should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across Norrath to get<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put it in the<br/>\n&gt; bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weigh<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10 lbs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; \tKitasi the questly nerfed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
