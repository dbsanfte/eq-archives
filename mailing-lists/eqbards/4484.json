On mobs it will pulse with the animation<br/>\n&gt;that looks like selo&#39;s accelerando on us, and this will irritate the<br/>\n&gt;creature causing them to attack me but thats all i can tell. I tried<br/>\n&gt;dualing a friend and it wouldnt even pulse on them, though it was<br/>\n&gt;irritating the snakes and bats around me. For that matter, i couldnt even<br/>\n&gt;get the dissonance to hurt them. Bellows hurt them, and i could wack all<br/>\n&gt;day on them with my weapons, but no aoe song hit them. Didnt try fear now<br/>\n&gt;that i think of it... this happened before todays patch but after the last<br/>\n&gt;patch. Anybody know what was going on here? I am going to try this again<br/>\n&gt;today after this patch and see what happens... </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
