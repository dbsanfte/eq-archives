Where will you go at 48,49, & 50?  For 45, 46, 47,and to 50<br/>\neven, I killed alot of spectres - mostly solo (I&#39;d say 80-90% of my 45 was<br/>\n&#39;solo&#39; - ie ungrouped helpers at times buffing & healing but one heck of<br/>\nalot of fear/chaining.)  Until 47, single pulls are hard unless the spots<br/>\nare heavily camped.  Oasis, Feerott & OOT are the prime spectre spots.<br/>\nSoloing them is a possibility at 45 but risky.  With a partner, should be<br/>\nquite easy.  Another partner spot is Cyndreela outside the TV in the PoF<br/>\ncave (but that is like guard camping except you fight a caster instead of a<br/>\nmelee class. Kill, heal/med, rinse, repeat.)  Other wise, outside Permafrost<br/>\nIce Giants,  OOT seafury cyclops, rathe mts hg&#39;s, Lower Guk King Room, Ghoul<br/>\nLord Room, Frenzied. Kedge Keep with ppl who know what they are doing and<br/>\nthe correct classes but this is an unlikely pickup group spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 17, 2000 11:54 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Final Hell Level....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Anyone got any tips on good hunting places at level 45?
