In the back of the<br/>\nbuilding with the bank, there is a marshall.  Talk to him and<br/>\nhe will start you on the path to beginning this quest.  You<br/>\nmay need to kill some monsters in Misty Thicket first to raise<br/>\nyour faction enough that he&#39;ll give you the quest though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo complete the quest requires you to kill a lot (a LOT) of<br/>\ngoblins and orcs and turn in their warbeads and belts.  After<br/>\nyou have turned in enough, the marshall will give you a squad<br/>\nring.  The numbers I&#39;ve seen tossed around are about 400<br/>\nnecklaces and/or 50 belts.  Killing Mooto is supposed to help<br/>\ntoo, and killing Gunrich is supposed to hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ring holds a single healing charge (80 or 85 hp).  You<br/>\nactivate it by targeting yourself, then right-clicking on the<br/>\nring.  I have not tried using it to heal someone else.  This<br/>\nis not that useful once you get around L15-20 or so, but at<br/>\nlower levels it, as someone on the monk list put it, &quot;could&#39;ve<br/>\nsaved my life like a million times.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo recharge the ring, take it to the cleric&#39;s guild.  In<br/>\nRivervale, the cleric guildmistress (Hendri Mcrubble or<br/>\nsomething like that) recharges the ring.  Simply give her the<br/>\nring and she will return it charged.  I am told that any<br/>\ncleric guildmaster/mistress will recharge it, though you may<br/>\nneed good faction with them first (see next paragraph).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou do NOT have to have as much faction to recharge it as you<br/>\ndo to get the ring in the first place.  My bard bought a ring<br/>\nand tried to get it recharged, and the guildmistress wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ngive it back.  My druid found his ring on the ground before he<br/>\nstarted the quest.  Based on what the guildmistress said to my<br/>\nbard, I tried asking for a heal first (she says something<br/>\nabout [healing] and [curing] if you hail her).  She refused<br/>\nsaying I wasn&#39;t trustworthy enough.  I started the quest,<br/>\nkilled a few goblins, and raised my faction with<br/>\nGuardiansoftheVale a bit.  When I visited her and asked her<br/>\nfor healing again, this time she gave me a quest to get<br/>\npiranha teeth (don&#39;t bother - it&#39;s broken since piranha don&#39;t<br/>\ngive teeth as loot right now).  I guessed that this meant I<br/>\nhad enough faction for her to like me, gave her the ring, and<br/>\nshe gave it back to me recharged.  My druid has used it and<br/>\nrecharged it about a dozen times so far in less than one<br/>\nlevel.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now you know why people are always /auctioning &quot;Buying<br/>\nRunnyeye warbeads and Deathfist belts&quot; in Misty Thicket.  :-)<br/>\nI&#39;ll add that Misty Thicket is probably the nicest (and<br/>\nsafest) hunting grounds in the L1-12 range when it&#39;s not<br/>\ncrowded.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
