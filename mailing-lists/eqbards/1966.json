I had no idea he was doing this when I&#39;d been to CB<br/>\nbefore, and I remember being mowed down by a train of Dvinn, Crush, etc.<br/>\nwhen I was in CB at lower levels. It&#39;s a pretty nasty thing of him to<br/>\ndo. ;p He sometimes has Tergon&#39;s Spellbook, a lore item. I believe this<br/>\nis for a quest. &gt;Emisarry - The orc with a mission...To whack you over<br/>\nand over and over with his spear. Really, he&#39;s &gt;quite good at his<br/>\njob...&gt;Ambassador D&#39;vinn - Dark Elf with an attitude. This is THE bad<br/>\nguy of the whole area. Not sure &gt;what level he is, but it usually takes<br/>\na group to nuke him. Awesome dagger (Dragoon Dirk) to be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;found when he falls though (Hint: If you&#39;re not on his hate list, don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>attack orcs near him...He might &gt;ignore you if you&#39;re not fighting!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDvinn seems to also have a racial hatred toward Wood Elves, as does Dorn<br/>\nin the 2nd Northern Ro Dervish Camp. Maybe the hatred is toward bards,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m inclined to believe it&#39;s actually Wood Elves. Perhaps all Dark<br/>\nElves (NPCs) have this dislike? BTW, Dvinn ALWAYS has the dagger, so at<br/>\nleast you know if you actually do beat him, you will get it. It is also<br/>\nnow a Lore Item, which is a good change to reduce overt camping in my<br/>\nopinion. DVinn often has the Black Heart for the Paladin Quest, but not<br/>\nalways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to Crushbone the other day at Level 19, and Crushbone was a blue<br/>\ncon but to me was like fighting 2 dervish thugs at 17th or 18th, I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t take him alone. The Prophet was VERY easy to kill. Dvinn -<br/>\ndon&#39;t even consider it. I paired up with a L24 druid the first go around<br/>\nto get a Dragoon Dirk, and the only reason Dvinn died was because the<br/>\ndruid was a monster. DVinn was 19th-20th everytime we spawned. Even<br/>\nsplitting the exp with a L24, I got literally a quarter bubble exp off<br/>\nof him. The Dragoon Dirk however is an awesome weapon, and is even<br/>\nbetter then the Combine long sword I used. It seems with alot of these<br/>\nthat bronze armor puts you over the edge in taking hits from them, I was<br/>\nstill in 90% banded when I went, and wielded a Combine LS and a FS LS.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;These two are found elsewhere and are of note, because they can get<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hard to kill at lower levels... &gt;Trainer - Found WAY on top of the hill<br/>\noverlooking the castle.

He appears to be cooperating with the orcs. Good &gt;reason<br/>\nto ice him. &gt;If you give a slave a copper piece, he will read the number<br/>\nof his shackles so you can match the keys up....<br/>\n<br/>\nWOW! I didn&#39;t know about the copper. Now I can go use those keys I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen collecting in the bank. Great tip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a very rare spawn called &quot;the warlord&quot;, he can have a<br/>\nBracer of Battle. It&#39;s a very good piece of armor I hear in its own<br/>\nright, but you also need it to complete the quest for the screaming<br/>\nmace, along with the shiny brass shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
