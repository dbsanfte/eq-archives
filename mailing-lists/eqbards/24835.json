I&#39;m level 50 and still haven&#39;t maxed out my <br/>\nhand to hand, it&#39;s pretty pathetic. I&#39;m sure other bards have, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong weaving should be done at level 2. At that point you should be weaving <br/>\nChant of Battle with Chords of Dissonance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 12, in a group, you could be weaving Anthem de Arms, Chords of <br/>\nDissonance and Hymn of Restoration (depending on your situation). It&#39;s been <br/>\na long time since I was level 12, however, perhaps someone else has better <br/>\nadvice as far as song selection. Consider Bellow as bard&#39;s kick. Very <br/>\nuseful, especially if you&#39;re solo, but if you&#39;re in a group just weigh <br/>\nwhether the few extra points of damage is more useful than buffing your <br/>\nentire party.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the last person to recommend any particular stats and don&#39;t really have <br/>\na strong opinion about &#39;em. I would think that CHA affects your ability to <br/>\nLament creatures. CHA becomes much more important when you gain the ability <br/>\nto Pixie Strike or Charm creatures. I&#39;ve valued STR, but only because I&#39;m <br/>\nlugging half my house with me due to working on tradeskills of some sort, <br/>\nso while not overly important to the usual bard, it&#39;s important to me. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWindleaf Mistsong<br/>\nLevel 50 balladeer<br/>\nRed Sky<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:43 AM 5/25/01 -0700, Stacey wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;When we get duel weild will we be able to play an<br/>\n&gt;instrument and use a weapon at the same time?
