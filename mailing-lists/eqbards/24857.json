On our server he dies<br/>\nwithin minutes of being up 99% of the time<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you figure out when he dies, clock it and be there before he spawns<br/>\nagain.  Example: we killed him at 9:30-10pm or so last week sometime, he was<br/>\ndue to be up a around 11:30/noonish the next day, i logged in at about 10 to<br/>\nnoon and my guildies had allready killed him. while i was there a gnome from<br/>\nanother guild logged in to check on him (got nuked like hell too).  Another<br/>\ntime when we just finished killing him i hit tracking and saw a player named<br/>\nPhinniechecker (or something like that on track.  So as you can see, its a<br/>\nhighly competed spawn.  You often see an influx of players running to KK<br/>\nabout an hour before he&#39;s up.  If one guild fails him, someone will take<br/>\ntheir place to pop him<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nAyonae Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rebecca Small [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsmall@...\">rsmall@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: May 29, 2001 9:06 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: How are people getting the white scales <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh I know we can take Phin to the cleaners, the trick is he has to be up<br/>\nfirst!
