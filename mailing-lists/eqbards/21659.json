The last one was sent incomplete :(<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to interrupt your day with off-topic prattle, but I did want to <br/>\naddress something important.<br/>\nSome of you may have heard already, but for those who didn&#39;t, a player on <br/>\nBrell Serilis (my current home server) was banned for a roleplay story she <br/>\nwrote and posted to a non-Sony affiliate board.  Please don&#39;t respond with <br/>\nyour &quot;they deserved it&quot; or &quot;Verant should be bombed!&quot; flames, I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto start a thread about it.  If you&#39;re interested in the full story, Lum <br/>\nseems to have most of the details at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lum.xrgaming.net/\">http://lum.xrgaming.net/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what I wanted to do, as co-moderator of this list, was to warn <br/>\nyou that anything you say can (and will, apparently) be held against you by <br/>\nVerant.  This list is designed as a private list for subscriptions, etc, <br/>\nbut is open to the public for archive reading.  Consider this a word to the <br/>\nwise.  I may even add this to the list FAQ :(<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
