Last","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-291552817\">Some of them turn green at 46.  These are the ones in the cave in Feerott.<br/>\nThis seems to be a good spot to pull from if the spawn is well spread out.<br/>\nLast night, I was pulling for my group and a level 47 SK was pulling to solo<br/>\nand we had a pretty good pace going.  I had 2 rogues and wiz, mage, pally in<br/>\nmy group.  The specs died fast and we had a nice pace even with the other<br/>\nguy pulling for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was using lament to reduce their agro in hopes of pulling singles.  Also I<br/>\nwould lament, agro, then run but not out of line of site.  Again, this was<br/>\nto try to prevent them from teleporting thru the agro ranges of the others.<br/>\nThey seem to path well if they have line of site to you. If not, they will<br/>\nteleport and bring friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we know for sure that a horn will enhance our screetch song?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like 46 is a break point for resists on spectres for Denons<br/>\nDischord.  At 45, I tried it and got more resists than I liked so I went to<br/>\nother songs.  At 46, I tried it again thinking 2 brass songs Denons and<br/>\nScreetch (yes I am lazy and dont like to swap instruments) would be good<br/>\nidea.  Lots better success - very few resists compared to 45 and no brass<br/>\nskill increases (I was maxxed already) so it must have been a level<br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the last pull was 4 or 5 spectres and it was just me and 1 rogue.<br/>\nToo many resists and I yelled &quot;ZONE!&quot;  &quot;Right on your arse!&quot; was the<br/>\nresponse and we Selos zoned into Rathe with less than a bub of hp for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
