Also does<br/>\n&gt;it make you ineligible for Selo&#39;s drum and Horn of War?<br/>\n&gt;A few improvements in your equipment I might add if you dont mind which<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re probably already aware of.<br/>\n&gt;Wear Imbrued gloves (assuming you have them), the lambent ones are just<br/>\n&gt;awful looking. If you&#39;re ever able to get a Tranix crown, wear that over<br/>\n&gt;Imbrued (assuming you dont have one). Imbrued helm also looks awful =).<br/>\n&gt;Crested spaulders -better ac and hp, dex useless since your weapons dont<br/>\n&gt;proc. Hooded black cloak if you&#39;re lucky enough to obtain one - the 45<br/>\n&gt;hp outweighs the extra 2 ac on cloak of shadows in my opinion.<br/>\n&gt;Diamondine earrings - 122 charisma is plenty so you can afford to lose<br/>\n&gt;the opallines, especially if you choose Tranix over Imbrued.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m still trying to figure out why your dex is so high. Imbrued BP (13),<br/>\n&gt;bracer (3), Gloves (5), Belt (10), Pauldrons (7 or 9?), Cloak (5). Also<br/>\n&gt;how much hp does the bolster belt give you? I&#39;m assuming roughly 30 hp.<br/>\n&gt;Please let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maev Lorekeeper<br/>\n&gt;Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
