And in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; both runs I has taking as little as 1/8th a bubble from<br/>\n&gt; dragon breaths.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FR/CR was 220+ in both cases.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I wasn&#39;t there, I can&#39;t say.  And I can&#39;t call you a liar.<br/>\n&gt;   But it&#39;s my opinion that you are exaggerating quite a bit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve been next to a dragon three times, CR 222, FR 170 and<br/>\n&gt;   I took 400, yes four-hundred, points of dmg regardless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   And 1/8th of a bubble?  Rokken, come on man gimme a break.<br/>\n&gt;   You cannot expect me to believe that. heh.  Your fish is getting<br/>\n&gt;   a little too big.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
