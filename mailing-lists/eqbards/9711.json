He said I was<br/>\n&gt; insane - that they were &quot;worth 100&quot;.  I try to explain simple economics -<br/>\n&gt; that item is worth what people are willing to pay for it.  I was willing<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; pay no more than 100pp.  He launched into a diatribe about how difficult<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; would be for me to kill a Hill Giant at my level (I was 25 at the time -<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; was 35).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I said fine - and if someone else would pay 100 - then good for them.  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know whether he found a bard who paid the 100 or not.  I expect he<br/>\n&gt; did.  Probably the kind of bard I got into an argument with last night.<br/>\n&gt; He<br/>\n&gt; never twisted songs.  And only played Jig of Vigor - never Hymn between<br/>\n&gt; battles.  He insisted it increased mana recovery by 10-15 percent.  When I<br/>\n&gt; told it didn&#39;t he laughed and said &quot;That old rumor&quot;.  He insisted that he<br/>\n&gt; tested it and it did work...<br/>\n&gt; Interestingly enough - one of my guildmates - a 28 cleric insisted that it<br/>\n&gt; did speed his mana recovery.  This guy lives in bumblef***  Wisconsin and<br/>\n&gt; goes linkdead on average once every 30-45 minutes.  PL was bad for me last<br/>\n&gt; night for me (I have DSL and usually get really good connectivity) - and<br/>\n&gt; given the quality of his connection - I would assume he gets REALLY bad<br/>\n&gt; PL.<br/>\n&gt; It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Jig does help with refresh in these cases...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS by bumblef* Wisconsin I don&#39;t mean to denigrate Wisconsin as a whole -<br/>\n&gt; but do have to point out that the Packers lost to the Bears yesterday (:<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jared J.

Good luck to you you will<br/>\n&gt; need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 110<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;pp to by gems to do quest.  Maybe another 100 pp if you buy your<br/>\n&gt; lambert.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Lambert stones are acutiong around 100 pp ( i will not pay that im to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;cheep )<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Daniel P.

I have in the neighborhood of 850pp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;not too thrilled with my armor.  Mostly some banded still a lot of<br/>\n&gt; barbed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;etc.  A few pieces of bronze.  I&#39;m at level 26 btw - so I&#39;m almost at<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;point where I can think about questing for Lambent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;    But anyway - I got to the armor store in E Freeport and look at<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Steel Plate.  I notice that they mostly offer 1 or 2 AC points above<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;equivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.<br/>\n&gt; Question<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is - is it worth it?  How important is one or two AC points?  How<br/>\n&gt; important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is 2 or 3 but giving up STR or whatever bonuses.  I have Blackened Iron<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Shoulders.  It says &quot;Magic Item&quot;.  What does this actually provide?  Is<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Steel Pauldron the equivalent?  Pretty annoying you can&#39;t tell without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;buying and then you can sell it at a fraction of what you pay for it if<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;make a mistake (obviously forcing you to check website like<br/>\n&gt; EQualizer...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;    Anyone have any other suggestions on what to spend money on?
