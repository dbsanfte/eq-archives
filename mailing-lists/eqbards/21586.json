Instruments, especially the Dragon grade ones eg: Selo&#39;s Drums,<br/>\nare still the &quot;uber&quot; bard weapons for both damage as well as buffs and<br/>\nresists.&quot;&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nVerant should have made an instrument good enough so that even Shada would<br/>\nuse it (instead of swords &lt;g&gt;) -- now that would be &quot;Uber&quot; - truly.  The<br/>\nmention of it being an &quot;off-hand weapon&quot; is from Aftathott&#39;s evaluation of<br/>\nthe wep and it&#39;s proc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat good is &quot;The Vision&quot; when it makes you blind to some basic things:<br/>\nBards, songs, instruments.  Because instruments are class specific to bards,<br/>\nthey should be _the_ defining items for us.  Some combination of songs and<br/>\ninstruments should be the focus of the bard&#39;s power and be the basis of our<br/>\npower - imho.  I guess I should be mad or dissappointed at Verant but I am<br/>\nsome where between &quot;numb&quot; and uninterested.  Was it said in the design<br/>\nmeeting: &quot;Yes, let&#39;s *make* bards compete with warriors for their quest<br/>\nitems - that fits with the part of the Vision where...&quot;, or was it: &quot;Shit!<br/>\nTell them to delay the update!!  We forgot to make a quest for bards - let&#39;s<br/>\ngive &#39;em some kinda sword with musical notes floating around...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly, the bard!~ <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel Sniderman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuzzbone@...\">fuzzbone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, October 01, 2000 11:20 AM<br/>\nTo: EQ Bards<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bard Uber-Quest Weapon<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - Saw the blurb on EQVault - info on the guild Afterlife website at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=sss\">http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=sss</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
