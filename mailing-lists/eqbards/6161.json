I try and help out by doing a little damage with DDD,<br/>\nCoD and Hymn with horn and lute and I start seeing the experience messages<br/>\nto my horror. I did give 3pp to everyone in their group though to try and<br/>\nmake up for it :).  Anyhow yes Cod, DDD, and hymn is a lot more powerful<br/>\nthan melee.. You can test it for yourself in South karana.  Pull a rook<br/>\nand try to melee it using whatever songs you wish.  Then try the same<br/>\nthing with the aoe damage.  You will notice a tremendous difference.  I<br/>\nwas soloing 2 rooks at your level using those songs without having to kite<br/>\nat all.  If you do get into trouble, toss on selos, and run and heal (or<br/>\nif your feeling risky you can kite with CoD too.. its rough though running<br/>\nbackwards with selos in an octagon pattern works).  There are of course<br/>\ndangers with using the area effect songs but its usually well worth it. I<br/>\nbelieve at your level its about 30 damage every 5 seconds aoe which is<br/>\npretty dang good :).  If I see you in Solusek again maybe I&#39;ll join you..<br/>\nthe exp in Cazic isnt nearly as good as stealing your kills though ;).<br/>\n<br/>\nCelandro Spellsong<br/>\n29 Bard Povar<br/>\nThe killstealing bard ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------In reply to -------------------------<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1999 09:01:08 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Instruments vs. Melee quandry<br/>\n<br/>\nHail all,<br/>\nI am level 24, armed with a dragoon dirk and a Polished Granite tomahawk.<br/>\nRecently  a level 29 bard stopped by our group in SolA with a train<br/>\n*laughs*<br/>\nand ended up getting the kill with his horn on several goblins. I was<br/>\nflabergasted (given that we have a level 28 warrior and level 26 cleric<br/>\nand<br/>\nwizard).
