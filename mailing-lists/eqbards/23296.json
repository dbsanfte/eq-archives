The thrust of a lot of<br/>\nthese letters seems to be that a single Druid or a single Shaman should have enough healing to stand in<br/>\nfor a Cleric, with maybe some downtime tradeoff.  I really can&#39;t agree with that.  If that were the case,<br/>\nwhat would be the point of a Cleric?  What most people don&#39;t bother noticing is that any combination of<br/>\ntwo of the other healing classes is already quite sufficient (with the exception of rez).<br/>\nShaman/Druid/Paladin, put any two in a party and you&#39;re pretty much good to go.  There&#39;s a ton of Druids<br/>\nout there, the problem is that most of them don&#39;t want to or don&#39;t know how to heal.  That won&#39;t get fixed<br/>\nby giving them more healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 56 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Well my secondary is a cleric so let me chime in...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am kind of torn on this.  I think there needs to be better alternatives to<br/>\n&gt; clerics to imporve EQ at high levels.  BUT, from my cleric&#39;s perspective,<br/>\n&gt; druids and shamans get a lot of nice spells that we don&#39;t get.  So there has<br/>\n&gt; to be a big difference in our healing ability to make up for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Both classes get SOW, which makes life so much better.<br/>\n&gt; Druids get ports.

Now with lvl 60 tanks, lvl 60 buffs and better equipment, the<br/>\n&gt; spell is unbalancing.  And it lives Verant in a quandry.  Mobs that are<br/>\n&gt; meant to be challenging could become comically easy for a group with a<br/>\n&gt; warrior/cleric, or mobs that are meant to be challenging could become<br/>\n&gt; impossible for a group without.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now what to do about it?  Improving druid/shaman healing is probably good<br/>\n&gt; for the game.  But where does it leave clerics?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is similar to the bard/enchanter discussion about mez.  I think their<br/>\n&gt; solution to it was fine.. Bards (especially once you get SoT) are a<br/>\n&gt; tolerable replacment for an enchanter, but definitly not even close to<br/>\n&gt; equal.  WIth the current healing issue I hope they do the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
