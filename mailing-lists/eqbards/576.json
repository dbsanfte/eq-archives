I&#39;ve been in some very good large groups, including one<br/>\nlast night with 2 dwarf clerics, a gnome warrior, a wild-elf druid, and an<br/>\nelf caster.  We hunted orcs in the edge of the Oasis of Marr, a very<br/>\ndangerous place.  We were quite successful in terms of both experience and<br/>\nloot, while ridding the world of some of the endless supply of orcs.  Being<br/>\nhuman I was the tallest of the group and neither the least nor the most deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood groups are usually happy to have a capable bard along.  Group buffs,<br/>\nfast running, and quicker group healing are much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThrush, Human Bard of Freeport in Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
