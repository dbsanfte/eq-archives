Very shortly after joining my guild I was on as<br/>\nmy rogue and knew none of the guildmembers who were on-line.  So I invited<br/>\nall of them to come to Freeport and have a drink with me.  Two of them were<br/>\nIN freeport and didn&#39;t respond.  I got one to come in from Oasis and another<br/>\nfrom S Karana.  We did nothing but drink, emote, and crack eachother up for<br/>\nalmost two hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was about 4 months ago.  I&#39;ve recently been on as my bard in the same<br/>\nguild fighting with 3 guildmates in Lavastorm.  And it wasn&#39;t until I read<br/>\nyou post that I realized two of them are alts of the two that joined my<br/>\nrogue for a drink and the third is one of their RL sisters.  Finding great<br/>\nplayers beats any loot, I say.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Scott Malin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Thanos0000@...\">Thanos0000@...</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My ranger character (my bard is still stuck at 17th) had a <br/>\n&gt; good night about<br/>\n&gt; a month ago. I was in Steamfont collecting micro servos for a <br/>\n&gt; Trueshot bow<br/>\n&gt; when the Mino hero pops and starts killing the under 10 crowd <br/>\n&gt; around the<br/>\n&gt; caves. I was 39 at the time so I have SoW and figure I&#39;ll try <br/>\n&gt; kiting him. I<br/>\n&gt; got him to 1/2 health but I was nearly out of arrows and <br/>\n&gt; figured I might<br/>\n&gt; need to drop him on a guard when a 44th level druid swoops in <br/>\n&gt; and offers to<br/>\n&gt; help. Within 30 seconds there&#39;s a dead mino and the druid <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want any<br/>\n&gt; part of the shackle. I couldn&#39;t believe my good fortune. I <br/>\n&gt; needed to get off<br/>\n&gt; at that point but I made a point to go to Greater Faydark to <br/>\n&gt; celibrate my<br/>\n&gt; druid savior (he was a woodelf so I figured to do it in his home zone)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I go and buy 9 bottles of something expensive, not sure what <br/>\n&gt; wine it was<br/>\n&gt; then setup by the newbie lift. I /rollplay and begin to shout <br/>\n&gt; my story to<br/>\n&gt; the zone. Finally near the end I call out to a first or <br/>\n&gt; second season (I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t even use level and circle doesn&#39;t seem right for <br/>\n&gt; non-casters) ranger<br/>\n&gt; and druid to come to the top of the lift to drink a toast in <br/>\n&gt; the name of my<br/>\n&gt; savior. I didn&#39;t say I was going to give them a Mino axe, <br/>\n&gt; buffs and maybe<br/>\n&gt; some coin, I think I had a FS Scim for the druid, so you can <br/>\n&gt; imagine the<br/>\n&gt; reaction ... nothing. I shouted for several more minutes and <br/>\n&gt; finally got a<br/>\n&gt; 2nd level ranger. I gave him the axe, buffed him as well as I <br/>\n&gt; can and gave<br/>\n&gt; up, selling the extra wine back to the vendor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;sigh&gt; at least I now have a Hero Bracers<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Underbrush<br/>\n&gt; 43rd level ranger of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Reedwind<br/>\n&gt; 17th level bard<br/>\n&gt; Terris-Thule<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
