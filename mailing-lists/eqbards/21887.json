I see how it is...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlrighty, as to why working as intended isn&#39;t good<br/>\nenough: Simple answer is gameplay.  I&#39;ve heard horror<br/>\nstories of people trying to use the 51 (52?) travel<br/>\nsong only to have one member get hit and fall to their<br/>\ndeath.  I&#39;ve also heard this song won&#39;t stack with<br/>\ndead man floating which would fix the problems with<br/>\nthis song right there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a lot of these songs should do (45th song, the<br/>\ntravel song, etc) is create more than one spell icon. <br/>\nThe upper level haste song that has the DS on it<br/>\nshould have the damage shield component seperate. <br/>\nFrom what I&#39;ve heard, the DS is lost so quickly thus<br/>\ncanceling the whole song effect that upper level bards<br/>\nsimply switch to an earlier haste song.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why these &quot;working as intended&quot; songs were a<br/>\ngood idea but bad reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbashi&#39;s comments about our singing steel pissed me<br/>\noff even more.  Exactly what are we balanced against<br/>\nright now?  The warrior Cobalt is something I&#39;d love<br/>\nto have. Don&#39;t most of the pieces have healing<br/>\nproperties in the form of self buffs to them?  I&#39;d<br/>\nreally love to know what moron thought the helm,<br/>\npants, and boots effects were balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why lots of the older bards are still<br/>\nchaffing at the whole lullaby issue is indeed how it<br/>\nused to work.  But it&#39;s also how Verant decided to<br/>\nhandle that whole issue.  We have the head magic guy<br/>\nat the time publicly stating it seems messed up. <br/>\nWe&#39;re told to wait patiently which we do, for 6 to 8<br/>\nmonths. In that time the break another song but fix<br/>\nit.  Then they break that song again and refuse to fix<br/>\nit.  Then they have a mouthpiece come out and say<br/>\nshe&#39;ll get to the bottom of this who promptly tells us<br/>\nsome lame excuse about how it&#39;s never supposed to have<br/>\nbeen useable after 30th.  So where&#39;s the upgrade of<br/>\nlullaby around 29th???<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a bard that was around when you could use<br/>\nlullaby as it used to be, you&#39;re more than likely<br/>\npretty pissed off right now.  The reason is because 2<br/>\nclasses (shaman and cleric) has essentially had their<br/>\nown lullaby issue come up and it either got fixed or<br/>\nis getting fixed.  Mark of Karn was nerfed, they<br/>\nsuggested fixes, and Verant went with the one the<br/>\nclerics wanted. BTW, the fix wasn&#39;t one of the options<br/>\nVerant gave them.  All that got done in about a week. <br/>\nIt seems now the shamen have gotten Verant to look<br/>\ninto their uber weapon.  How much you wanna bet they<br/>\nget a fix close to what the shamen as a whole will be<br/>\nhappy with? <br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;m one of those bards who got to play with<br/>\nlullaby, you&#39;re asking if I&#39;m so livid, why do I play<br/>\na bard?  Mainly cause none of my secondaries are close<br/>\nto 45.  However, I&#39;ve heard is said you can get a<br/>\nwarrior to close to that in 2 months or so.  Mine&#39;s<br/>\n13th in 3 of my regular play days.  Oh, and with<br/>\nbandages, I&#39;m soloing.  I figure a shaman is probably<br/>\ncloser to being a bard but I just don&#39;t like how<br/>\nfemale barbarians look.  Hehe, and I am a true bard<br/>\nwhen it comes to astetics :P (I saw an absolutely<br/>\nperfect combo.  Runed mithril tunic with BI leggins,<br/>\narms, boots, gloves and a leather helm.  The half-elf<br/>\nwearing it looked great. Mithril BP, arms, and<br/>\nleggings with singing steel bracers, gauntlets, helm<br/>\nand boots looks awesome too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to sum up, Abashi is full of it, I&#39;m bitter,<br/>\nand I think it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to make choices<br/>\nin armor that cut down your AC but 100 to 150 points<br/>\nor so in the name a fashion :)  Another valueable post<br/>\nfrom me, lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  I do remember dragonrealms too.  I was a warrior<br/>\nmage there.  It was 9.95 a month but you could upgrade<br/>\nto 29.95 a month to get access to better hunting<br/>\nareas, and your own house.  Was a good game but the<br/>\npeople who ran it angered me to no end and I left when<br/>\nan alternative came out (taps foot waiting for Anarchy<br/>\nOnline&#39;s release date).<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  Something else I remembered while proof reading. <br/>\nThere was a post on whineplay from a bard complaining<br/>\nabout a stealth nerf on selo&#39;s.  Reports were<br/>\nconflicting about it so I blew off that issue. <br/>\nYesterday I noticed selo&#39;s acceleration got noticeably<br/>\nfaster.  Kinda like someone broke something and just<br/>\nfixed it maybe? /rude Verant<br/>\n<br/>\nCentiera D&#39;Winter<br/>\n45th Half-elf Bard<br/>\nCesca<br/>\n13th Half-Elf Warrior<br/>\nLitharia<br/>\n23rd High Elf Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nPS- I have 3 friends who are female barb shamen so I&#39;m<br/>\nnot anti-female barb, it&#39;s just not something I&#39;d like<br/>\nto play. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
