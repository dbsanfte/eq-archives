If so, what is done?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Most suggestions I have ever given in Plane raids were dismissed<br/>\n  as &#39;nah, that wont work&#39; or &#39;people are gonna die, just face it&#39;<br/>\n  I don&#39;t buy that at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Innoruuk, they force the bards to stop playing any songs unless<br/>\n  necessary during pulls.  They also do not let bards in the melee,<br/>\n  rather they hang back with the casters.  Could be that it&#39;s over-<br/>\n  protecting an asset, or could be that they don&#39;t realize a bard&#39;s<br/>\n  full potential.  If you don&#39;t listen or think you have a better<br/>\n  idea, you are blacklisted.  EQ Politics, yuk!<br/>\n<br/>\n  My first idea for PoF was... send me in full buffs, full everything.<br/>\n  Reso, Rune IV, Camo, Invis Animals, Invis Undead, Invis, +AGI, +DEX<br/>\n  +STR, +STA, Talisman, Guard, buffs buffs buffs buffs.....  Nekkid<br/>\n  me, with a normal drum, and selo&#39;s memmed, and I haul ass.  Hit the<br/>\n  ground running, and collect all the mobs and train them away from <br/>\n  the portal, away from the SE corner, into the middle of nowhere then<br/>\n  curl up and die.  Immediately following that let everyone zone in<br/>\n  however they wanted to.  (I&#39;ll leave breaking the plane discussion<br/>\n  out)  Since I wasn&#39;t L50, that idea was dismissed as bullshit.  To<br/>\n  this day, I think that sacrifice would still work.  The main problem<br/>\n  you have upon zoning is a shiverback or scarling sitting there <br/>\n  pounding the crap out of you, and then your client gives you control.<br/>\n  By that time you are dead.  Loading, please wait... to another Loading,<br/>\n  please wait.  If a bard could clear that garbage, and avoid a DT<br/>\n  from Cazic, I think the portal trash would stay clear long enough<br/>\n  for players to zone in.  This is purely hypothetical as no one <br/>\n  wanted to listen to little me.  8)   As for pulling, I wish. hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
