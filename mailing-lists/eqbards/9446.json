I was looking at the song<br/>\nanalysis and it indicated that lullaby didn&#39;t effect more then 4 targets.<br/>\nAbout a week back my party got ambushed in East Karana by a bunch of spirit<br/>\nstalkers while my party was engaging undead reavers (3 of them).  I struck<br/>\nup lullaby with my lute and sure enough, I got 10 head nods messages (7<br/>\nstalkers and all 3 undead reavers).  There was so much chaos so I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nif it took or not, but it at least allowed us enough freedom to dispatch of<br/>\nthe gnolls and then eventually the stalkers.  I definitely felt like more<br/>\nthen 4 were really sleeping...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran<br/>\nLvl 21 Bard [Prexus]<br/>\nLendyl<br/>\nLvl 21 Mage [Prexus]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
