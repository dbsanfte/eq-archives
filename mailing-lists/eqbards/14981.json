None of the Mistmoore pathing problems<br/>\nI know of are caused by this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn MM, the main problem is that mobs don&#39;t take a straight<br/>\nline route to get to you.  Anything you pull from or in front<br/>\nof the ballroom runs through the ballroom, out the back,<br/>\nthrough the negotiator room, and then towards you.  On the<br/>\nway, it picks up all the mobs in the ballroom, the negotiator<br/>\nroom, and the gargoyles in between.  (There are other pathing<br/>\nproblems, but this is the big one.
