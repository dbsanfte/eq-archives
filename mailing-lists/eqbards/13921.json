This is very difficult<br/>\nin a long friend&#39;s name. But this is an excellent suggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I want to remove someone from my friend list I just type <br/>\n&gt; /friend soandso<br/>\n&gt; and it removes them, just type the name of the person you <br/>\n&gt; want to remove<br/>\n&gt; after the /friend<br/>\n&gt; Works for me, might be a bit tedious but it saves deleting files etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Madagan Songweaver, Bard of 35 Songs - Veeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The difficulty was in the length of the phrase, not ignorance of how to<br/>\nremove a standard friend name.<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal post:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there anyway to delete your entire /friend list and start <br/>\n&gt; over?  I typed<br/>\n&gt; in /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; seen in a long<br/>\n&gt; time.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed <br/>\n&gt; in addition to<br/>\n&gt; players.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, <br/>\n&gt; or /groupsay<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; instead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the <br/>\n&gt; phrase I typed<br/>\n&gt; to my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire <br/>\n&gt; list, there<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; a few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made <br/>\n&gt; numerous attempts<br/>\n&gt; at removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces <br/>\n&gt; before I type<br/>\n&gt; in any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my <br/>\n&gt; friend list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ <br/>\n&gt; directory this<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; delete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>\n&gt; friends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
