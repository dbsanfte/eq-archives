It is possible that the mage is his<br/>\nfriend but then I would think that friend would be more prone to listening<br/>\nto him than ignoring. I got the impression that the mage wasn&#39;t his friend<br/>\nIRL since the group leader talked to him and not Galtin.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGiving the mage something simple to do may work but I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s<br/>\nnot simply hitting keys that quells this desire to do something. Often it<br/>\nrequires actually seeing results or actually helping the party. Throwing<br/>\ndaggers with a skill level of 1 and missing almost every time can be rather<br/>\ndiscouraging.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: Roop Dirump [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Friday, June 04, 1999 6:31 PM<br/>\n8)To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)Subject: [eqbards] Drunk and mad and dumb<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)From: &quot;Roop Dirump&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roop@...\">roop@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)You guys plain miss it!!!<br/>\n8)<br/>\n8)I don&#39;t know how many responses I&#39;ve read where people say,<br/>\n8)&quot;FIRE&quot; them.<br/>\n8)Look, read back to the original post?
