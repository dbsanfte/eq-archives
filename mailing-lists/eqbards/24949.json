The guards really are indifferent and if Goonda<br/>\nhas been killed or pulled away you can saunter on thru their camp just<br/>\nfine.<br/>\nProblem normally is that Goonda is Scowls and all the ogres will help him<br/>\nas<br/>\nsoon as he aggros on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found out the hard way.  I was walking amongst the guards hailing them<br/>\nwhen Goonda returned from chasing someone and promptly the previously<br/>\nindifferent ogres slaughtered me.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Kit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garramone@...\">garramone@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, 31 May, 2001 11:56 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Ogres in W.

Now...last I<br/>\n&gt; checked, amiable and indifferent didn&#39;t make them want to<br/>\n&gt; kill you..or I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; REALLY be dead in most cities.
