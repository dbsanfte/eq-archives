My <br/>\nfirst RPG.  But I read these great books as a kid, and Fflewduer was a kind <br/>\nof silly bard that had noble roots (King of a small realm).  I wanted my <br/>\nbard to be like that.  All derring do and loyalty to the hilt.  So I chose <br/>\nthat name for my bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen starting a game like EQ, I was confronted with choices covering race, <br/>\nclass, sex, stats, and name.  I figured I wanted to be a bard because they <br/>\ncould do so many things and I didn&#39;t have a clear idea of what to get out of <br/>\nEQ.  I chose as best I could the most general of possiblities so not to <br/>\nlimit myself.  A half elf gets to start in 3 different towns, a bard can do <br/>\nmost quests, I spread my points around not knowing too much, but skimping on <br/>\nCharisma (only 5 points there).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway there you have it.  BTW, it is possible to use several different <br/>\nemail services that don&#39;t have my name in the email, but why hide?  I like <br/>\nme.  I like my bard.  I have a good time.
