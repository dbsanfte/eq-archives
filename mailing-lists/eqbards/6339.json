The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-181060896\">Yeah, it happens to all of us, and to other classes as well.  However, I<br/>\nreally think that Enchanters and Bards are the two most misunderstood classes.<br/>\nThe reason for that I think is that Enchanters and Bards (bards even moreso I<br/>\nthink) are really quite different from ALL of the other classes.  Our<br/>\nabilities are quite unique.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut WE shouldn&#39;t underestimate the other classes either.  We shouldn&#39;t feel<br/>\nthat just because we run the best, most versatile and most subtle class &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\nthat we know everything there is to know about the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:<br/>\nI have a 23rd level Wizard friend (damn nice guy) that is pretty darn handy at<br/>\nmelee.  I&#39;m not sure what stick he&#39;s carrying now, but if he&#39;s OOM or if the<br/>\nfight isn&#39;t that tough and he doesn&#39;t wanna burn the mana he&#39;ll step up to the<br/>\nplate and start swinging.  That guy hits for over 20 points a whack with that<br/>\ndamn thing, and his skill is high enough so that he genuinely contributes to<br/>\nthe melee damage.  &#39;Course if he gets hit a couple of times he has to bow<br/>\nout - not many HPs himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 20th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nJason A.
