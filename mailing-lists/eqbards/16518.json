Max hit on non-plane Norrath is like 400 dmg per strike,<br/>\n  and that&#39;s rare.  Max hit on planar realms is in the thousands.<br/>\n  Kunark gonna be a bunch of L40 mobs?  Hell no.  Everything is <br/>\n  gonna have DT, and melee in the 500-1000s... I have no doubt about<br/>\n  it.  I was right about the L60, and about the spells per level,<br/>\n  so my track record here is pretty good =)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Gordon says that some of the new mobs will make Vox/Nag look like lawn<br/>\ntrash you bet we need better songs.   When many of the other classes are<br/>\ngetting group buffing spells our songs need to keep pace with this power up.<br/>\nMany of the classes are getting insta-kill spells at 60th (Wizards:<br/>\nDistentagrate.  Necros/Clerics: Banish Undead, Magicians: Banish Summoned)<br/>\nThis is the level of power 60th lvl groups will have.  Makes me think I<br/>\nundershoot on my song ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
