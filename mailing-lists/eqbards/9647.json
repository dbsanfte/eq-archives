I did this for a while in Unrest along the wall between the back<br/>\ndoor and the porch.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see a strange dungeon back there... though if you walk up the stairs<br/>\nand look left (where you are looking at the other side of the wall you&#39;re<br/>\npeeking through) it is just the normal first floor of the house. I have no<br/>\nidea where this part of the dungeon is, though while peeking through the<br/>\nwall you can see a bookshelf there... presumably the entrance to this place.<br/>\nThough I&#39;ve been through down to the basement down there, I&#39;m still not sure<br/>\nwhere it is... I think maybe it is the hag pit by where the tentacle terrors<br/>\nare, by the dwarven ghost.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, be careful while doing this though... the hags WILL see you and<br/>\nblast you through the walls. (Often, if you&#39;re camped at the back of the<br/>\nhouse you&#39;ll see their spells burst out of the walls - they really are in<br/>\nthe basement though, not the first floor where you&#39;d think.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDaleia</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
