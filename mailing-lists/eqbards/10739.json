Naturally the gobs all headed that way<br/>\n&gt; immediately.  Also since SoW can last for 25+ minutes its pretty easy for<br/>\n&gt; SoW casters to still have speed underground and cause huge trains so that<br/>\n&gt; only the bards get their speed taken away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I can forsee in the future, no more binding inside dungeons.<br/>\n  There is no real need for it.  And it&#39;s only used to exploit <br/>\n  the game:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) Find the mob you want, tag it, gate to zoneline, and fight<br/>\n     it there in a safer environment.<br/>\n <br/>\n  2) Raid of Vox/Nagafen.  Need I say more?  hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  3) Shortcuts back into deep dungeon areas to kill X mob<br/>\n     instead of running through a fully spawned dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Those are the things I&#39;ve seen, I bet there are 3 more<br/>\n  uses for the binding in dungeons which exploit one thing<br/>\n  or another.  There is really no good reason to bind in <br/>\n  a dungeon to defend doing it.  I mean they can bind right<br/>\n  outside the entrance, which is something non-casters wont<br/>\n  be able to do anyway.  No binding in dungeons would elimate<br/>\n  the ability for casters to psuedo-train in the same fashion<br/>\n  as Verant has deemed SoW/Selos users.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
