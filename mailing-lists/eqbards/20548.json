Also mages are much less mana dependent for<br/>\ndamage so they often need to med less.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour friend might be a great paladin (more than might, I will grant you she<br/>\nis).  However if you are hearing those not a legal target messages and she<br/>\nblows up corpses, she does not know how to play her mage.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile bards and mages dont mix all that well (our songs dont help their<br/>\npets, we dont need their summoned bandages and our charm spells can<br/>\nsometimes play havok with pets), mages are not a weak class at all.  Perhaps<br/>\npeople dont have good experiences with them very often since mages often<br/>\nsolo most of their careers, thus have bad group skills and bad dungeon<br/>\nskills.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I gave up my troll warrior, I switched to a mage and always played in<br/>\ngroups (mostly in dungeons like Old Paw and Guk).  People were amazed how<br/>\nmuch damage a mage could bring to the group without saying &quot;OOM&quot; the whole<br/>\ntime.  Also back in that day (pre people having 3 lvl 50 characters to twink<br/>\nwith) every tank would bow down before you when you gave them a stack of<br/>\nbandages for free.  I never had my pet cause a train that killed us.  (On<br/>\nthe occasion my pet would be naughty, I would say &quot;ETS&quot; to the group and<br/>\ngate out).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short (TOO LATE!), mages much like most classes are viable if played well<br/>\nand seemingly a horrid class if played badly.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
