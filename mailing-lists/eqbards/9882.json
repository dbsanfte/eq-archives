I for one<br/>\n&gt; am looking forward to the break.  Since I&#39;m in the US Army, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m off through<br/>\n&gt; Monday.  Combine that with my wife having to work(evil grin) <br/>\n&gt; and that means I<br/>\n&gt; get to play EQ all day tomorrow and Friday.  This will be the <br/>\n&gt; first time in a<br/>\n&gt; long time I get to play for more than two hours at a time.  <br/>\n&gt; Just might get the<br/>\n&gt; chance to finally make 27th level and play around with the <br/>\n&gt; Charm song some.<br/>\n&gt; Already printed out the song analysis that John Kim posted a <br/>\n&gt; few weeks back so I<br/>\n&gt; have it to refer to.  Got my song scroll already in my <br/>\n&gt; backpack and I&#39;m even<br/>\n&gt; gonna go ahead and make my pet hotkeys now in anticipation of <br/>\n&gt; gaining that song.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For you E&#39;ci bards (Kitasi, Faras, Aloro, Laluni, et.al.), <br/>\n&gt; look me up if you are<br/>\n&gt; online.  Maybe we can all get together and work on getting <br/>\n&gt; quest components for<br/>\n&gt; our armor.  I&#39;m getting tired of MM and was thinking about <br/>\n&gt; heading to Solusek.<br/>\n&gt; An enchanter friend who is 35th level has already agreed to <br/>\n&gt; help me fight giants<br/>\n&gt; in order to get some lambent stones as well.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Take care<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;        Thinking about putting your business on the Web? <br/>\n&gt; MindSpring Biz has helped over 100,000 businesses get their .com.<br/>\n&gt;              Join MindSpring Biz and save $50!  <br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mindspring4\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mindspring4</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
