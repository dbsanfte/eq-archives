Save the loot off your kills and sell","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1203247979\">Welcome to being a bard!<br/>\n<br/>\nEach level you get 1 song (later on some levels you<br/>\nget more than 1 but not for a long time.)  Save the<br/>\nloot off your kills and sell it to a vendor.  Run some<br/>\nof the quests and save.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe level 3 song - Jig of Vigor - can be every<br/>\nhelpful.  It restores stamina - which you lose when<br/>\nyou fight and when you jump alot.  Jumping while you<br/>\nrun is an old trick for running a bit faster.  Jig<br/>\nhelps you do that when you need to escape from a bad<br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 3 &quot;views&quot; you can selected with the F10 key.<br/>\n One has a smaller view screen and lots of option and<br/>\ncontrol boxes.  Another is all grapgical and no text<br/>\nor controls. The third one is called &quot;fullscreen&quot;  or<br/>\nfull screen overlay.  It fills your screen and has<br/>\ntransparent boxes for essential items (text, spell<br/>\ngems, health, group, self and buff icons.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sound to me like you have the &quot;screens same<br/>\nresolution&quot; checked.  Use F10 to find the view with<br/>\nall the controls showing.  Use the &quot;options&quot; button to<br/>\nget settings for general, display, keyboard, mouse and<br/>\nchat.  In display - look for &quot;screens same resolution&quot;<br/>\nand change that setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nVirtuoso, somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\nMercenary Force<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- compugeeke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:compugeeke@...\">compugeeke@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi, nice to see this group here!  I just got the EQ<br/>\n&gt; Trilogy and <br/>\n&gt; installed everything, seems to run ok.  I now have a<br/>\n&gt; level 3 Bard <br/>\n&gt; with whom I&#39;ve been practicing singing.  He is now<br/>\n&gt; up to &quot;Feeble&quot; <br/>\n&gt; does this mean i can start singing?  Do I need to<br/>\n&gt; learn songs?  How <br/>\n&gt; do i do that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, is the game supposed to run in full screen? I<br/>\n&gt; have it on <br/>\n&gt; 800x600 and it doesnt fill the screen.  And at<br/>\n&gt; higher resolutions the <br/>\n&gt; game screen gets smaller.  Mind I have tweaked<br/>\n&gt; voodoo3 drivers <br/>\n&gt; running in XP so i can use Glide with other games so<br/>\n&gt; that could be <br/>\n&gt; the culpret.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -fohat, on Firiona Vie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nCheck out Yahoo!
