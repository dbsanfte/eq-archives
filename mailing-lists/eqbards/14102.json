I guess I&#39;m smarter than the average<br/>\n&gt;   bard.  But clumping me in the powergamers cliq is your own false<br/>\n&gt;   take on this.  If you&#39;re looking for someone to blame, don&#39;t look<br/>\n&gt;   this way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   All I can tell you right now is your tune will change.  Mine did.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Congratulations.  I truly wish I had your luck, skill, free time... or<br/>\nwhatever the difference between your 50 and my 37.  But, I believe you&#39;ve<br/>\nmisunderstood me.  The only comparison I made with your statement and that<br/>\nof a powergamer is being selfish.  I don&#39;t equate fast leveler with<br/>\npowergamer.  Maybe some residual irritation of the guy in BB carried over<br/>\nhere?  Which, btw, his comments about you having no business in BB at level<br/>\n50 sound familiar to a certain statement about a level 25-30 having no<br/>\nbusiness in lguk.  There is no blame that I attribute to you at all, nor to<br/>\nany level 50, powergamer or not.  Each person is free to play the game as<br/>\nthey wish and go where they&#39;re able.  Verant is responsible for the<br/>\novercrowding problems, NOT a level 30 player in lguk.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I sent that tell to you in BB, I would have been curious as to what a<br/>\nlevel 50 can find to do in BB... not as a &quot;Get out of my zone!&quot;, but as a<br/>\n&quot;Is there something I don&#39;t know about here?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, more than likely,<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t have said a word.  A level 50 is free to travel anywhere they<br/>\nchoose in the game.  As is a level 25 even if he _is_ due for a fast death,<br/>\nbarring obvious Verant imposed restrictions (Planes).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as my tune changing, if you mean I will start to look at those who<br/>\nhaven&#39;t made it to my level as not deserving of playing in my favorite<br/>\nhunting ground, then you are sorely mistaken.  No matter how crowded it<br/>\ngets, that is an attitude I will never carry.  I may petition and complain<br/>\nto Verant, but _never_ even think someone else is less deserving of being<br/>\nthere than me.  Until Verant fixes it, it&#39;s a problem we will all share.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
