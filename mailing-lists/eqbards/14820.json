Many thanks to the Twelve Year Guild on<br/>\nCazic-Thule.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe SharkSkin Drums are found on a named Mermaid called Coralyn Kelpma. She<br/>\nspawns past Estrella, just to the right of the 5 StingTooths in the Ceiling<br/>\nand right outside of the Seahorse Caves. A normal Gloomwater is her<br/>\nplaceholder. We came upon her by accident as she spawned 20 min after we<br/>\nkilled her placeholder. I had never heard of her before. Now I wonder what<br/>\nher rare loot is. Grin. She looks like she is equipped with a lute when she<br/>\nhas these. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have tested the Drums. They are infact better than the Mistmoore Drums. I<br/>\ndo not have Selos drums to test against. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the test results from a 47 bard singing Elemental Rythms. The<br/>\nnumber represents the point increase for the cold/fire/magic resist. <br/>\n<br/>\n+28 = no instrument just singing <br/>\n+50 = normal hand drum <br/>\n+58 = Mistmoore Battle Drums <br/>\n+61 = SharkSkin Drums <br/>\n<br/>\nJudging from this Mistmoore drums give a 16% increase over normal drums. And<br/>\nSharkSkin Drums give a 22% increase over normal drums. Testing with a couple<br/>\nother songs also shows a slight increase when using the SharkSkin vs using<br/>\nthe Mistmoore. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Addition Selos speed seems slightly enhanced (actually easier to see a<br/>\nslight slow down when going from Sharkskin down to Mistmoore). I feel very<br/>\nhappy running with these. A visually subjective test with Encumbrance seems<br/>\nto indicate they are at least as good as Mist Drums in dealing with<br/>\nEncumbrance and Selos running. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in All great Drums and ultra-rare. I shall keep these over the Selo&#39;s<br/>\nDrums, even though Selos is likely better. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Icon looks like a lute. When equipped it looks like a lute as well. The<br/>\nnice thing about this is that when running with selos I actually strum a<br/>\nlute instead of a flute. Unfortunately I may mistake the icon for the Lute<br/>\nof the Gyspy Princess sometimes when switching instruments as they appear<br/>\nthe same.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI Don&#39;t really read this onelist.  Just posting for a heads up and to place<br/>\nin the Archives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck getting yours. I love Kedge! <br/>\n<br/>\nRADIA DELFIN <br/>\n47th <br/>\nCazic-Thule <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet 100% FREE Internet Access powered by Excite<br/>\nVisit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freeworld.excite.com\">http://freeworld.excite.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
