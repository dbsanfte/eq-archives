For<br/>\nturning in four Spiderling Silk to the GuildMistress there, you get some<br/>\ncash (I forget how much, not a whole lot), faction, and a free drum.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the other quests are fairly mundane, if not useless. But, recently,<br/>\nVerant has implemented the &#39;FedEx&#39; quests, delivering mail all over<br/>\nFreeport. If you know you&#39;re going to be traveling between cities, check<br/>\nwith the local FedEx Bard. These quests will usually net you between 1 and 9<br/>\ngold. Lately, I&#39;ve been based in Qeynos. I&#39;ve also been spending time in<br/>\nSurefall Glade (They REALLY like followers of Tuanre there!) I&#39;ve been<br/>\nworking on my Fletchery Skill (and I get some awesome prices there). Anyway,<br/>\nthe FedEx bard there just happens to want mail delivered to Qeynos. I&#39;ve<br/>\nonly completed this quest twice, but a total of 3 gold for two trips I was<br/>\nmaking anyway, really isn&#39;t all that bad. Maybe not so big a deal if you&#39;re<br/>\nhigher in level, but down here at 10, every gold counts...<br/>\n<br/>\nLulen<br/>\nBard of the 10th Chorus<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Raoul de Grunt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_corbolu@...\">eq_corbolu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 02, 1999 04:38<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Quests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Raoul de Grunt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_corbolu@...\">eq_corbolu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone tell me the use of qeusts?
