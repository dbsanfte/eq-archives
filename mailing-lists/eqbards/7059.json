I still don&#39;t think that people should be<br/>\n&gt;allowed to bind right by the action places. Why? If that was the case you will<br/>\n&gt;see a lot more kamikaze pilots around. People will NOT see death as a major<br/>\n&gt;thing.<br/>\n&gt; Travelling back to your corpse is IMO the only REAL penalty by dying. At<br/>\n&gt;higher levels and in the right parties the clerics resurrect line of spells,<br/>\n&gt;reduce the travelling time to a &quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT...&quot;. Lastly it would ruin<br/>\n&gt;the erie feeling of being in an unknown zone far away from home, which I kinda<br/>\n&gt;like.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I must disagree here, I don&#39;t see any of my caster friends becoming kamikaze<br/>\npilots because they&#39;re bound close by.  I also have to say that the penalty from<br/>\ndeath is not the run,  but the exp loss which translates into time lost.  If I<br/>\ndie twice in a night, that negates my entire 2 hour play window, experience<br/>\nwise.  Add to that the ADDITIONAL penalty that only melee player must pay, which<br/>\nis an additional half hour of downtime to return, while the party is gaining<br/>\nexp.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, that equates to (30 min out of 2 hours)   an additional 25 percent exp<br/>\npenalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line, for me anyway, is that I play EQ to have fun and play with my<br/>\nfriends.  Running by myself, for half an hour over the same, familiar terrain,<br/>\nwhile my friends are having fun together, is crappy.  And it irks me that not<br/>\nall players have to suffer through this.  Either we all bind in cities only, or<br/>\nwe all bind anywhere.  Don&#39;t single out the melee classes for less play time and<br/>\nless exp for the same monthly fee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAhem.  Sorry...starting to foam at the mouth :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGolias, Solusek Ro!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
