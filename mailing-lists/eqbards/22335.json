Those EE&#39;s often have some poor person victimized. I<br/>\nthink the last time I used Lullaby was on a poor ranger the EE had pet&#39;ed. I<br/>\nhit the EE so it sic&#39;ed the ranger on me, ran around til I got far enough<br/>\naway to have time to mem Lullaby, then just kept the guy locked down til the<br/>\ncharm wore off. He was one grateful elf.<br/>\n<br/>\n As to the RenFest in Texas, we couldn&#39;t make it but the Queen and King<br/>\n(Excaldi and Gawaine), of our guild were there:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.stratics.com/content/info/eqfest/costumes.shtml\">http://eq.stratics.com/content/info/eqfest/costumes.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\n With a monk pulling, we usually make sure he is out of song range or I stop<br/>\nsinging to avoid agro transfers. Monks die alot on pulling, usually due to<br/>\nlow MR. If a monk is pulling a caster mob especially, the FD must go off<br/>\nbefore the mob starts casting a spell. Many times the monk dies due to<br/>\nspells being in progress when he FD&#39;s, the spell hits and breaks FD, and the<br/>\nmob starts recasting before he can FD again. If we aren&#39;t trying to split<br/>\nmobs, and we know he&#39;s pulling casters, I&#39;ll sing something with an MR boost<br/>\nand stay in his range, just to ease the damage rate on the monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
