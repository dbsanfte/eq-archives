Its scarin<br/>\n&gt; the crap out of me. I was seen 3 times in less than an hour this morning<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; Permafrost, fortunately I had my Jboots activated and had the speed to get<br/>\n&gt; to the zone. My skill in Wind is 200, I maxed it a few days ago. I use<br/>\ninvis<br/>\n&gt; to navigate all sorts of places in upper and lower Guk, and Permafrost. I<br/>\n&gt; always used to disband from my party just so I wouldnt have to worry about<br/>\n&gt; my Invis fading on me because it was always 100% reliable before this last<br/>\n&gt; patch. Now I dont know anymore, at least I know the caster Invis is going<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; work a little while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s pretty odd because I have _never_ found Clouding to be 100%<br/>\nreliable from the time I got it all the way to L49 (just can&#39;t be<br/>\nbothered getting 50 now.) My skill has always been maxed for my level<br/>\nbut I still got those blink into view messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nShow your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\nWith a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
