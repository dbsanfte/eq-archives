The developers from both<br/>\nof those games have promised a new PvP system which will largely eliminate<br/>\ngrief PKers but still promote PvP (i.e. guildwars).  UWOO has guaranteed<br/>\ntheir new system will work.  Remains to be seen though.  Also, I&#39;ve never<br/>\nplayed UO, but from what I&#39;ve read on the UWOO mailing list, grief PKing in<br/>\nUO now has been largely solved.  No idea how it was solved though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhenders@...\">jhenders@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 08, 2000 10:21 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Horizons (was Official confirmation from Ester)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t Horizons another one of those games where the developers think<br/>\nthat in spite of UO having nothing but problems with PKs and grief<br/>\nplayers, and EQ showing the overwhelming majority prefer a PvP<br/>\nswitch, that they can come up with the perfect, abuse free forced PvP<br/>\nenvironment?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
