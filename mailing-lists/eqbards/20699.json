He conducted numerous tests on all of the songs.  Much of the<br/>\nsong data on Rokenn&#39;s song analysis was provided by John.  He stopped<br/>\nposting on this list for whatever reason a couple months ago.  John was also<br/>\nthe bard who ran extensive tests on the Lullaby song several months ago and<br/>\nposted his test results on the Whineplay forum (Kitasi ran similar tests and<br/>\nincluded his results in the same thread).  After countless bumps, Abashi<br/>\nfinally acknowledged the post and stated Verant would look into the<br/>\nsituation.  That was before Kunark was released IIRC.  Has been several<br/>\nmonths and several patches but still no fix to the song.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that a few people seem to have lamented the &#39;loss&#39; of John Kim<br/>\nfrom the list.  Having never read any of the fellow&#39;s posts, I can only<br/>\npresume that he was a prolific tester?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I&#39;ve seen over the past year, Rokenn has done an outstanding job<br/>\nof testing and retesting with each new patch the various effects of our<br/>\nsongs.  Just wanted to say that your efforts are greatly appreciated and<br/>\nit&#39;s people like you that make this list what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime consuming and job threatening! ;)  (j/k)<br/>\n<br/>\n(feel free to change the topic when replying)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
