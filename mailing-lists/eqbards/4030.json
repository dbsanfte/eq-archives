If you don&#39;t know there is no need to make me look like a fool<br/>\nbecause you are bored.

Would <br/>\n&gt; the whip be more<br/>\n&gt; effective if at, say, level 25 it proc&#39;d 80% of the time <br/>\n&gt; compared with the<br/>\n&gt; 20% (or whatever) it does at lower levels?<br/>\n&gt; I have no idea about this, just wondering...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ummmm....Yeah, anything that does something 80% of the time <br/>\n&gt; instead of 20%<br/>\n&gt; is going to be a BIT more effective....around 60% more effective....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Best Place to Buy Movies - Reel.com<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/reel1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
