It&#39;s rarely crowded, has good loot, TONS of goblins to<br/>\npull, great exp and I found myself to be a very valuable member of the<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne group in paricular was bard (me), 2 monks, 2 rangers and 1 warrior. We<br/>\nwere about level 30 and camped in the bar. The carnage that we created was<br/>\nunbelievable. We finished every single fight at full health, including one<br/>\nwhere we had a mix of 8 inferno, fire and flame goblins, including 2 wizzies<br/>\nand 2 shamen. It was by far one of the best displays of how powerful bards<br/>\nare. I sang Hymn with lute, anthem and psalm of warmth and we were<br/>\nunstoppable.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

In Sol A it is a big taunt.  If I play Hymn and my two other songs I<br/>\ndefinitely get the bulk of the attention.  The last 6 times we have had<br/>\ndeaths in our Sol A groups, on 5 of them the deaths have gone like this.<br/>\n1st death: me, 2nd death: other bard (lower level), 3rd death: other melee<br/>\nperson.  The two bards have died a combined 15 times in our Sol A guild<br/>\ngroups.  The other guildmembers have died a grand total of 6 times combined.<br/>\nEvery time there is a bad pull or we get trained its the bards that pay the<br/>\nprice.

You know how to be a bard better than they do.  Hymn is<br/>\nNOT that big a taunt.  Especially in today&#39;s dungeons.  They&#39;re _hardly_<br/>\ndangerous.

Yes I could give us all a<br/>\nspeedup,<br/>\n&gt; but since the only other person even meleeing is a cleric it wouldn&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; much.  My finger-twiddling is much better spent on Chant of Battle if the<br/>\n&gt; enchanter is there to Alacrity.  If he&#39;s not then Anthem gets back in the<br/>\n&gt; mix.  If bards excel at anything its that we can fill in as a substitute<br/>\n&gt; just-about-anything.  Problem I&#39;m starting to find is that I&#39;m only able<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; get into groups that are lacking something if there isn&#39;t a person looking<br/>\n&gt; to group who&#39;s better at that thing as a primary role.  When I do get in<br/>\n&gt; lately its always as a tank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last 3 nites:  Don&#39;t chain, we&#39;re darknessing.  Don&#39;t anthem we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; alacritying.  Don&#39;t Chant we&#39;re skin like something or othering.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nHymn<br/>\n&gt; or you&#39;ll get too much attention and die.  Didn&#39;t leave much of anything<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; me to do but swing, bellow and go owie.  Occasionally we&#39;d pull a wizard<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; shaman gobie and I&#39;d throw the resistances in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Towards the end of the night I get asked in group tell, &quot;Can&#39;t you do<br/>\n&gt; anything but Bellow?  I thought bards had all kinds of cool songs.&quot;  My<br/>\n&gt; reply?

Add onto this that there is a speed<br/>\n&gt; beyond which a weapon can&#39;t get any faster. And Swift Like the Wind,<br/>\n&gt; in higher levels, isn&#39;t even used on people with haste sashes. Not<br/>\n&gt; worth it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So. Sometimes a minor speedup is good enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quicken is very definitely a combat buff. And fairly high mana. Grouped,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d put it on my main tank and let a bard handle the speedup for the<br/>\n&gt; rest, preferring to use mana for crowd control, or other circumstances<br/>\n&gt; rather than keeping everyone Quickened.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just because it is better does not mean that it is always the best<br/>\n&gt; use of the enchanter&#39;s mana.

Quite deadly when used in conjunction with Languid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Pace/Tepid Deeds. Combine these 2 spells when possible.. talk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about breaking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the odds. Slows down your opponent, increases your attack rate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This spell doesn&#39;t stack with Augmentation, but as such it provides over<br/>\n&gt; &gt;double the attack speed for the target and is usually preferred anyway.<br/>\nThe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other important thing is that this spell helps increase combat skill gain<br/>\n&gt; &gt;since you are making more skill rolls with your attack.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;----------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So, when SLTW &quot; provides over double the attack speed &quot; - it hardly<br/>\nmatters<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if VoV does a 35.271% increase or a 36.983% increase.
