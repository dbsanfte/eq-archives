Right now there s a trade off for each, which is fine.

Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  My idea is<br/>\n&gt;change the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to me (Stats<br/>\n&gt;might be the factor) to be the better song to use over Warsong and Anthem.<br/>\n&gt;I have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, there should be<br/>\n&gt;no debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Right now there&#39;s a trade off for each, which is fine.  What I would like<br/>\nto see though is Anthem returned to playable status, but the increases<br/>\nadjusted accordingly.  Basically I&#39;d like to see it balanced to an<br/>\nenchanters quickness series (quickness, alacritity, celerity, swift like<br/>\nwind),  granted our songs can effect up to 6 people so there needs to be<br/>\nsome balancing, but the fact that a 35th bard cannot compete with the<br/>\nspeedup ability of a 24th enchanter is just silly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  No thanks, there&#39;s some skills that a player just has to have.  This is<br/>\nakin to a caster knowing when he can cast in combat & not be interrupted, or<br/>\nknowing how long to wait before casting so not to magetaunt a critter off a<br/>\nfighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rouges<br/>\n&gt;do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   I haven&#39;t checked into this, but considering the skill is the same, I<br/>\nwould think it should carry over.  Actually I&#39;m still of the purist attitude<br/>\nthat you shouldn&#39;t know, what hide SHOULD do is be an equivilent of monk&#39;s<br/>\nfeign death, but have an extra restriction that you have to be out of LOS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand<br/>\n&gt;point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a<br/>\n&gt;coin.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Remove casters to bind anywhere, allow everyone to bind in taverns/inns,<br/>\nprovide an npc at inns that binds for 5p.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was not using a<br/>\n&gt;crossbow or bow?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   EQ&#39;s bards are quite different than any other RPG&#39;s bards.  Another pass<br/>\non throwing weapons might be in order though, recoverables is one thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only weapons that can be<br/>\n&gt;used as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of<br/>\n&gt;singing songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a lot of ideas<br/>\n&gt;here would help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   In theory they could be out there & just not found, there really are alot<br/>\nof items that still havent been found.  In practice, given the way objects<br/>\nhave been structured it&#39;s quite doubtful you&#39;ll see this if not for a LONG<br/>\ntime.  I&#39;d just be happy for a plethora of magical instruments, not to<br/>\nmention MORE good songs that are playable & not sung only.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
