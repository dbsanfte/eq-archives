If its green<br/>\nand slowing the spawn, your advanced powergamer will kill it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thing about druid faction and teleports is a bit over rated - ihmo!<br/>\nThe 3 most frequently used rings have no druids at them:  Lavastorm,<br/>\nButcherblock (hmm or does it???) and Feerott.  I spent a bunch of levels<br/>\nwith evil race players in my regular group.  We have tele&#39;d in to rings<br/>\n_with_ druids and yes we get attacked.  And yes we run for the zone.  No<br/>\noffense but your perspective is one from having played mostly or perhaps<br/>\nonly &#39;goodie&#39; races.  Come to the dark side and see.  A few guards, druids,<br/>\nor merch&#39;s chasin&#39; you is just how it goes.  It happens and you zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour wood elf philosophy is a good one ;p Keep telling your self that &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so I am not really on the dark side - ie I am not KOS in Qeynos or<br/>\nFreeport or any of the goodie cities - but my picture is on the wall in the<br/>\npost office of Ogg hehe I will tell you that!  But both Qeynos and Freeport<br/>\nhave quests that are &quot;goodie&quot; that can or absolutely will make you KOS to<br/>\ncorrupt guards and merch&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark races seem to have a lot more variety of stuff to kill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tReece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tMonday, December 27, 1999 12:56 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Killing Giants in your low 30ies<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, any bard who kills treants is making life unnecessarily hard on<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\nI have been told killing treants lowers your faction with druids (and don&#39;t<br/>\nwant<br/>\nto test it to find out:-).  Assuming that it is true, if you decide to kill<br/>\ntreants you most likely wont be able to use the druid rings for group<br/>\nteleporting.  I&#39;ve got a druid friend who promised me free teleports for<br/>\nlife<br/>\nbecause I located and recovered her corpse out of the lava in Sol A.  No way<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\ngonna give that up in exchange for the money and EXP treants give.  Too many<br/>\nother places in the game for that.  Plus, I&#39;m a wood elf from Kelethin.<br/>\nSeems<br/>\nkinda evil to go around killing sentient trees when the foundation of your<br/>\nhometown is distantly related to them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n29 bard  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wow, I really am beginning to feel like the only person left playing EQ<br/>\n </span></blockquote>who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; doesn&#39;t kill druids, treants, guards, dwarves at the docks, gnomes, etc...<br/>\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t anyone care about faction anymore?
