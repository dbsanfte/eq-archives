Which would then help them in those marathon buff<br/>\n&gt; sessions pre-dragons, etc.  And can it be stacked with Clarity song?  Does<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a popular misconception.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour max mana has absolutely  N O T H I N G  to do with the<br/>\nrate at which people can cast spells.  Buffing a group will<br/>\ntake just as long whether you have 500 mana or 2000 mana.  A<br/>\nL45 cleric with 500 mana can cast as many superior heals per<br/>\nhour as a L45 cleric with 2000 mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly your mana regeneration rate (Clarity, manastones, etc)<br/>\ncan change the time it takes to cast a spell N times.  All the<br/>\nextra mana does is give you more flexibility to &quot;save up&quot; mana<br/>\nfor a rainy day when things turn bad and you have to do a mana<br/>\ndump.  The cost of this of course is that you spend extra time<br/>\nmedding to gain back that extra mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it stack with 2 bards playing it in the same group?  If you stop playing it,<br/>\n&gt; does their mana volume decrease?

Once they&#39;ve cast their first spell and used<br/>\nup that bit of extra mana they&#39;ve saved up, there&#39;s no point<br/>\nto playing Elegy anymore.  (Well, supposedly int decreases<br/>\nyour resist rate and wis decreases your fizzle rate, so maybe<br/>\nthere is a reason.  But there is no mana-based reason to<br/>\ncontinue playing it after the first couple spells have been<br/>\ncast.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
