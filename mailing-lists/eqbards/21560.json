This enhancement allows a caster to <br/>\nperform a number of funtions with one key, same as weaving.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, yes, missed notes would mess the timing up. I wonder if you could <br/>\nthen just press the &quot;social&quot; key again to interrupt the current macro or <br/>\nwhether you&#39;d be stuck waiting for your it to end? Something to definitely <br/>\ntest.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Sounds like you might be able to set up some weaving via the social keys<br/>\n&gt;with this new &quot;pause&quot; command. It&#39;ll be fun to test!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*Pauses in Socials*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause<br/>\n&gt;takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number<br/>\n&gt;of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For example, a social consisting of:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/sit off<br/>\n&gt;/cast 1<br/>\n&gt;/pause 100<br/>\n&gt;/sit on<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds<br/>\n&gt;after you&#39;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as<br/>\n&gt;another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the<br/>\n&gt;pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the<br/>\n&gt;same line.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/sit off<br/>\n&gt;/pause 100,/cast 1<br/>\n&gt;/sit on<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to<br/>\n&gt;note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from<br/>\n&gt;another, and MUST be specified first on the line.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
