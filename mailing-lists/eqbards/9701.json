He said I was<br/>\ninsane - that they were &quot;worth 100&quot;.  I try to explain simple economics -<br/>\nthat item is worth what people are willing to pay for it.  I was willing to<br/>\npay no more than 100pp.  He launched into a diatribe about how difficult it<br/>\nwould be for me to kill a Hill Giant at my level (I was 25 at the time - he<br/>\nwas 35).<br/>\n<br/>\nI said fine - and if someone else would pay 100 - then good for them.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know whether he found a bard who paid the 100 or not.  I expect he<br/>\ndid.  Probably the kind of bard I got into an argument with last night.  He<br/>\nnever twisted songs.  And only played Jig of Vigor - never Hymn between<br/>\nbattles.  He insisted it increased mana recovery by 10-15 percent.  When I<br/>\ntold it didn&#39;t he laughed and said &quot;That old rumor&quot;.  He insisted that he<br/>\ntested it and it did work...<br/>\nInterestingly enough - one of my guildmates - a 28 cleric insisted that it<br/>\ndid speed his mana recovery.  This guy lives in bumblef***  Wisconsin and<br/>\ngoes linkdead on average once every 30-45 minutes.  PL was bad for me last<br/>\nnight for me (I have DSL and usually get really good connectivity) - and<br/>\ngiven the quality of his connection - I would assume he gets REALLY bad PL.<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Jig does help with refresh in these cases...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\nPS by bumblef* Wisconsin I don&#39;t mean to denigrate Wisconsin as a whole -<br/>\nbut do have to point out that the Packers lost to the Bears yesterday (:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jared J.

Use your invise song and hit guk and perma<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt;get shin and icy greves respectively  if you spend some time  ~ 2 hour in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;both dungons for me you can reqest looting rights for the armor. As it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lore and heavy it is bad loot to most of the casters hunting there and<br/>\nthay<br/>\n&gt; &gt;willing let you loot and watch your back. Good luck to you you will need<br/>\n&gt; 110<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pp to by gems to do quest.  Maybe another 100 pp if you buy your lambert.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Lambert stones are acutiong around 100 pp ( i will not pay that im to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cheep )<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Daniel P.

I have in the neighborhood of 850pp.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not too thrilled with my armor.  Mostly some banded still a lot of<br/>\nbarbed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;etc.  A few pieces of bronze.  I&#39;m at level 26 btw - so I&#39;m almost at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;point where I can think about questing for Lambent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    But anyway - I got to the armor store in E Freeport and look at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Steel Plate.  I notice that they mostly offer 1 or 2 AC points above the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;equivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.  Question<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is - is it worth it?  How important is one or two AC points?  How<br/>\nimportant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is 2 or 3 but giving up STR or whatever bonuses.  I have Blackened Iron<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Shoulders.  It says &quot;Magic Item&quot;.  What does this actually provide?  Is<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Steel Pauldron the equivalent?  Pretty annoying you can&#39;t tell without<br/>\n&gt; &gt;buying and then you can sell it at a fraction of what you pay for it if<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt;make a mistake (obviously forcing you to check website like EQualizer...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    Anyone have any other suggestions on what to spend money on?
