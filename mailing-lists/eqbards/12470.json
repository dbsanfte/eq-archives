One thing I CAN say - having played a bard for<br/>\nso very long (and enchanter - both group oriented classes) I find my basic<br/>\nnature and tactics carry over.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what other class you may play - I guess if you play a bard long<br/>\nenough, you observe what NOT to do with other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust hit 20 last night in unrest - memmed my new spells - and which one did<br/>\nI use most?  Stun. My party was shocked and amazed that a wizard LIKED to<br/>\nstun, hehehehe. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as powerleveling - I guess my only experience there is on the<br/>\nhelping side with my bard. A 20something bard - at the right camp, with<br/>\nlullaby - is a newbies first and bestest friend. My husband calls himself<br/>\npermanewbie - he tends to get really frustrated around lvl 15 and start all<br/>\nover again. Many is the time I&#39;ve used the generic bandit camp in lesser<br/>\nfaye to help lower level friends train - starting, oh...bout lvl 7 or 8 -<br/>\njust as soon as they can hit the blasted things. Pull with a bellow and<br/>\njust lullaby, bard hate at it&#39;s finest. Since they can&#39;t hit me, they can&#39;t<br/>\nhurt me - and they hardly ever switch targets to that little bug biting<br/>\ntheir backside. Can do the same thing in Crusbone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while we may not be the best powerlevelers in the game ourselves - we<br/>\nare a very powerful tool to help folks crawl out of the plain vanilla<br/>\nnewbie levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - it never hurts to have lvl 50&#39;s remember you in the months to come<br/>\n*smile*.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:55 AM 1/5/00 -0800, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Actually, clerics have more options than just healing.

They just buff you up some, especially getting their<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; damage shield, then heal you while you fight reds.  My friend shot up<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; his guildmate from 8-12 in a few hours...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  My point is with a bard you dont just click one button to do something.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Powerleveling a bard is useless, if they dont know what they are doing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Most bards I see don&#39;t know what they are doing anyway.  (ie: bellow)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  With clerics, it&#39;s easy - they heal.  With wizards, it&#39;s easy - the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  blast.  Powerleveling a class who has to adapt and think is much more<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  difficult, which was the thing I was getting at. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
