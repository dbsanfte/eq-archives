There are a lot of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1544704350\">Agreed - there&#39;s not only a lot of trust - but agreement on philosophy.<br/>\nYour argument about warrior needing the weapon for example.   There are a<br/>\nlot of factors at play.  How good were the weapons the warrior and the bard<br/>\nwere using before that weapon dropped?  If warrior had  weapon only<br/>\nmarginally worse than the new one that dropped - but the bard was wielding<br/>\nSSOY&#39;s - I&#39;d say the bard &quot;needed&quot; that new one a lot more than the warrior.<br/>\nSure the warrior is going to make a &quot;lot better use&quot; than the other.   Does<br/>\nthe guild look at item as pretty much belong to the guild and hence - the<br/>\nwarrior surrenders that prior &quot;uber&quot; item to the bard who then stops using<br/>\none of his SSOY&#39;s?  Or does this new weapon that the warrior get allow him<br/>\nto sell his prior one on the open market and get even better item?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother point.  If all you ever do is large raids with your guild - I agree<br/>\nthat the warrior is in a much better place for that item.  But if you do<br/>\nsingle group ops (even with all guild members) the Bard will OFTEN be in a<br/>\nposition where his melee skills will make or break the group.  This is why I<br/>\nthink the argument that haste items never go to bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild, for example, has a lot of Rangers and a goodly number of<br/>\nShadowknights.  I&#39;ve been in groups with only two tanks - none being a<br/>\nwarrior - and my melee was pretty important to taking down mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - it gets very frustrating - need or not - to go on raid after raid -<br/>\nand seeing people getting new and cool stuff - and you going long periods of<br/>\ntimes without it.  This is a big reason for points system - some people seem<br/>\nto ALWAYS roll low.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that the raid leaders aren&#39;t doing a good job taking these<br/>\nthings into consideration.  Unless you are a new guild - I&#39;d guess they are<br/>\ndoing a great job of it - or I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have a lot of dissension in the<br/>\nguild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just commenting that these issues can be VERY complex - and if the<br/>\nleaders are like the majority of the EQ community (including it seems at<br/>\ntimes Verant) who don&#39;t truly understand the Bard class - we&#39;re gonna get<br/>\nthe short end of the stick.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde Katzenjammer<br/>\n54 Bard - Xegony<br/>\nDragons of Kel&#39;Dar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 08, 2001 10:07 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWow!! I&#39;m impressed you have a raid leader who can be trusted to be this<br/>\nfair.  Even with our point system the melee (prime looters) often just take<br/>\nitems to twink with, forget to announce loot, etc.  If our old hunt leader<br/>\nhad been in charge of loot, OMG half of us never would have gotten anything<br/>\nother than throw down equipment.  Not sure it would be much better now to be<br/>\nhonest.  Very impressive that your guild stays together! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana 60th Shaman<br/>\nTani 51st BRD<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
