Can anyone give me some information on the crowd control capabilities <br/>\nof classes other than Enchanters and Bards?  Have any of you developed <br/>\nany crown control techniques that let you handle oh, say, 5-MOB pulls?  <br/>\nI&#39;m really sick to death of hearing &quot;we can&#39;t do that, we have no <br/>\nEnchanter&quot;.  Really sick of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  My guild is toying with the idea of trying Venril Sathir.  I <br/>\nunderstand he has a single-target 1500 point lifetap (repeatable), and <br/>\ndoes 350 or so damage a pop.  The two techniques I&#39;ve seen suggested are: <br/>\n 1) chain Rune3ing (new word) the tanks, so the lifetap can&#39;t get them; <br/>\nand 2) chain nuking with a big battery of wizards (my suggestion was to <br/>\nhave a Ranger tanking VS, with all the Clerics chain healing him - should <br/>\nbe able to keep the guy aggroed enough to allow everyone else to remain <br/>\nuntouched, don&#39;t you think?)  (slight cynicism here)  My question is, <br/>\ndoes anyone know if poison resist helps against this lifetap the way it <br/>\ndoes against Maestro?  It is reported to be &quot;unresistable&quot;, which I <br/>\nsuppose is possible, but it may just appear that way because most <br/>\npeople&#39;s poison resist is pretty low.  Anyone know?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 52 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
