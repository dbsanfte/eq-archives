It&#39;s something that&#39;s been bugging me lately if we can&#39;t fight as well as a fighter.. and can&#39;t use our more powerful atk songs for fear of being overrun isn&#39;t there a problem. I&#39;m not saying we aren&#39;t useful I know we are I&#39;ve kept more powerful groups alive in hostile areas for months.. but is it just me or are we being TOOO limited in our role options?  Can some of you higher ups explain?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 9 Sep 1999 13:04:07 -0400  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> wrote:\r<br/>\n&gt; From: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Last night while I was testing out the CoD and DDD with my guildmate we\r<br/>\n&gt; were in duel mode.
