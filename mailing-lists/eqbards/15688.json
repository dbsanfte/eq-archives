No effect.  I have tried every setting in EQ at high low and mid<br/>\nlevels.  I have tried changing sound levels in my volume controls, all 6 of<br/>\nthem.  I have turned all the other sounds off and turned the volume way up<br/>\nto see if I can hear any hint of a sound as something walks past me, no<br/>\nluck.  I have an Aureal 3D card and have always had these problems.

Go to the<br/>\nControl Panel, then Multimedia.  There should be a group box at the top<br/>\nlabled &quot;PlayBack&quot;...click on the Advancded Properties button.  Click on the<br/>\nPerformance tab, then check your hardware acelleration.  If the slider bar<br/>\nis all the way to the right (&quot;Full&quot;), then drop it left one notch.  Then<br/>\nclick on the OK buttons till everything is closed : )<br/>\n<br/>\nI did this the other day, and the sounds seem to be working _a lot_ better<br/>\nnow.  (BTW....have a SBLive! Value with a Cambridge Soundworks DTT2500<br/>\nspeakers....now only complaint I have is the sub woofer...setting it to what<br/>\nit should normally be at, it works fine...but my mage friend starting<br/>\nsummoning stuff and the walls start shaking :).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Khelan, Bard of the 19th song<br/>\nGuildMaster of Divided Loyalties<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Papa Legba&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt; 03/03/00 12:49PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Papa Legba &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the exact same problem with my SB live card.

I know that recently<br/>\n&gt; all of my combat sounds started sounding &quot;really far away&quot; - Like they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; happening to someone standing near me, but not to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But if I sit down, the sounds are suddenly right??  I guess they have the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;center of source&quot; as the center of the model - not the model&#39;s head?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
