I&#39;m only human, I <br/>\nmake mistakes, as we all do.  As I so rapidly recanted my warning to <br/>\nHarmonic, so do I now recant one of my two warnings to Steelwolf, aka <br/>\nAriell Thunderwolff.  I am not perfect, and I&#39;m afraid that I leapt to the <br/>\nwrong conclusion when I saw the method that the message had been <br/>\nposted.  Ariell apparently made a mistake in his transmission - he intended <br/>\nto send a quoted version, not to make it look like Harmonic had sent it.<br/>\nSo, with that in mind, I do apologize to Ariell.<br/>\nUnfortunately, Ariell chose (of his own volition) to unsubscribe earlier <br/>\ntoday, so I am CC&#39;ing this message to him.  If you wish to say anything to <br/>\nhim, or protest his choice, please feel free to email him directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn spite of this, I do still stand by my original decision.  Posting <br/>\nprivate email to this list is bad form.  Doing it as a method of flaming or <br/>\nto provoke someone else into flaming back is not allowed. Period.  We&#39;re <br/>\nall adults here, and this is an open, public forum.  There is no need to <br/>\nplay &quot;He said she said!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s all learn to get along, and get back to talking about cool Bard stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
