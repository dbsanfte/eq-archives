I found a great<br/>\nguild, one that suits my playstyle and attitude.  But almost all of the<br/>\nguild members are on the US West coast and don&#39;t log in until I&#39;m logging<br/>\nout.  Making things more difficult is that the 4 or 5 that play the same<br/>\nhours I do are either Iksars or 10+ levels higher than me.  Part of my<br/>\nreason for wanting to join a guild was to make grouping easier.  If this is<br/>\na concern of yours then you might be better off checking which guilds have<br/>\nthe most comparable level players on when your on, rather than which guilds<br/>\nhave the most members enrolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 coppers<br/>\nEvulia &lt;Sisterhood&gt;, bard of 11 songs, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
