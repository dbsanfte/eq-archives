Please comment,<br/>\nrefine, etc.  First issue however is a RFC:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Nameless went down (again :P) GM-Hideaki<br/>\n(Nameless GM boss) was in channel Wazzap Hideaki! and<br/>\nasked if anyone was a bard, I piped up and he said he<br/>\nand GZ were brainstorming (who was immediately<br/>\nupstairs from Hideaki) on bard song ideas for<br/>\nexpansion.  He for my input on the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. How would we feel about a PARTY BIND song, using a<br/>\nvery expensive reagent and mana cost.<br/>\n--I told him that we did not want a bind song if it<br/>\nwas identical to casters, however if the song allowed<br/>\nyou to bind anyone anyplace (melees included) then we<br/>\nwould certainly welcome it, especially at higher (51+)<br/>\nlevels since expansion zones are rumored to be mammoth<br/>\nin scale.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. How would we feel about party invis vs undead.<br/>\n--I asked, &quot;doesn&#39;t clouding provided limited invis vs<br/>\nundead?&quot;  His unequivocal answer was &quot;no.&quot;  Feel free<br/>\nto inject more impolite comments here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a> but I&#39;m trying very hard to help<br/>\nsince I really care about bards.  I told GM-Hideaki<br/>\nwe&#39;d like an upgrade to Clouding that combined invis,<br/>\ninvis vs undead and sneak (meaning no spell graphic)<br/>\nsince this would give us an ability no single caster<br/>\ncan provide (both invis types) and the no spell<br/>\ngraphic would be a boon to +PvP servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to a compendium of ideas.  I am not making any<br/>\njudgements on them, but I did take the liberty of<br/>\ncombining similar ideas and/or taking the most well<br/>\nwritten version of an idea and posting that.  I will<br/>\nattribute all song ideas to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> unless<br/>\nyou explicitly email me (privately if you want,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gww6e@...\">gww6e@...</a>) to say otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Upgraded charm.  Everyone and his brother (over 35<br/>\nresponses) wanted this and hey, I do too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Upgrade to clouding.  Nuff said, and I think I<br/>\nsummed it up that we&#39;d like a song that can provide<br/>\nboth types of invis.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. An improved damage shield.  This appears to be<br/>\ndrawing interest:<br/>\n<br/>\nDenon&#39;s Sonic Reflection<br/>\nBrass<br/>\nGives all party members a damage reflection shield.<br/>\nCausing a portion of the damage done to them in combat<br/>\n(melee & non-melee) to be reflected back at the<br/>\nattacker).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6. An improved AE DoT with added effect (stamina drain<br/>\nbeing a common thread, the other was a lifetap<br/>\naffect).  Question at large: do mobs have stamina and<br/>\nif so, does it impact their ability to fight?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Upgrade to selo&#39;s OR remove hard speed cap.  I<br/>\npersonally want the cap removed vice burning another<br/>\nspell slot on an upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Upgrade to clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nCassandra&#39;s Clarified Elegy<br/>\nProvides clarity2 (whatever that might be) +<br/>\n(limited?) elegy effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Upgrade to MR debuffing abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nDenon&#39;s Fog of War. AE snare. AE slow attack speed. AE<br/>\nDot. AE magic debuff (30 pts at least). effect of fog?<br/>\n<br/>\n10. One-way teleport (self only?  to bard guild?).<br/>\n(Please no flames on this, I can already see it<br/>\ncoming)<br/>\n<br/>\n11. Mem blur song.<br/>\n<br/>\nFitful&#39;s Forgetful Improv<br/>\nVoice<br/>\nCauses the target to become so fixated on the improv<br/>\nthat it forgets whatever else it was dong.  Drawback:<br/>\nBard possibly left on hate list.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Upgraded Atk Song<br/>\nSince we are out speed buffed by enchanters, a<br/>\nstraight addition to Atk with an added component. <br/>\nMost commonly heard suggestion: rune type shielding. <br/>\nOther suggestions: massive ac bonus, massive<br/>\nregeneration effect, massive MR buff.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. A proc song<br/>\nThe Chromatic Scale<br/>\nLevel: 36th<br/>\nSkill: Singing<br/>\nDescription: A chromatic scale is all the notes an<br/>\ninstrument is capable of producing, generally played<br/>\nstarting from the lowest to the highest and then back<br/>\ndown; slurred up (ligato), tongued down (staccato).<br/>\nThe Chromatic Scale when song by the bard would act<br/>\nmuch as the Vampiric Embrace necro spell in that it<br/>\nimparts a proc to melee attacks however the twist is<br/>\nthat there would be 5 different types which randomly<br/>\nkick off: magic, fire, cold, disease and poison based<br/>\nattacks. These would be DD&#39;s - there by filling in our<br/>\nmissing DD ability, but in a uniquely bard fashion<br/>\n(group based, becomes more powerful as you add members<br/>\nand err... randomly good -- maybe. hehe).  Verant of<br/>\ncourse would come up with some cute little chromatic<br/>\nsparkles to surround us and multi colored blasts as<br/>\nthe proc goes off. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: For those D&D fans, recall the Chromatic* line of<br/>\nspells. <br/>\n<br/>\n14. A bard additive song<br/>\nCinda&#39;s Companion Cantata<br/>\nLevel: 49th+<br/>\nSkill: Variable (see below)<br/>\nDescription: A cantata is a composition scored for<br/>\nmany parts at once, incorporating both voice and<br/>\ninstrumental accompaniment, hence this song would<br/>\nallow bards in the same group to ally their voices in<br/>\nsong to intensify the effects of a common song - to<br/>\n&quot;stack&quot; the same song, perhaps with at<br/>\n100*(2-((6-n)^(1/6)))% effectiveness, where n is the<br/>\nnumber of bards playing cantata. Yes, this could be<br/>\nexceptionally powerful, what with twisting and all,<br/>\nbut this could easily be limited to only effect the<br/>\n&quot;top&quot; bard song in the spell list of the lead singer,<br/>\nwhilst the &quot;recovery&quot; period of stopping the song<br/>\nwould be such that twisting wouldn&#39;t be possible if<br/>\nyou were a cantata player.<br/>\nExample: A group composed of 1 warrior and 2 bards<br/>\nstops to rest. Bard 1<br/>\nbegins to sing Hymn, only to be joined in song by bard<br/>\n2 with Cinda&#39;s<br/>\nCantata - boosting regeneration by their now intensity<br/>\nmusic (by the SWAG<br/>\nformula above that would be a +69%).<br/>\nFull stacking numbers would be:<br/>\nn    +%<br/>\n---    -----<br/>\n1    69<br/>\n2    74<br/>\n3    80<br/>\n4    88<br/>\n5    100<br/>\n<br/>\n15. Song of Silence<br/>\nSolon&#39;s Song of Silence<br/>\nEffect: NON-PARTY: Silence.<br/>\n<br/>\nPBAE, fixed radius, 2 tick negate casting.<br/>\nNPC has one chance to resist intial and to break free<br/>\neach tick there after. Lute for enhanced effects. Save<br/>\nversus Magic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?  I pulled a few of these from the eqbards<br/>\narchives (btw the onelist search facilities need some<br/>\nserious help).  Please no flames on this and I thank<br/>\neveryone for the mountain of responses.  If I missed<br/>\nyour email, I apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-Tork@Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
