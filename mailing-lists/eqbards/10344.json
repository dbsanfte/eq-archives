It is inevitable<br/>\n  that the server population will on average be higher level than it<br/>\n  was the day before.  Verant changing zones that used to at one time<br/>\n  be safe, and now are dangerous for even L50 people is risky I will<br/>\n  admit.  But all you people who complain about Kithicor, need only<br/>\n  have to wait until 7am in the morning when all the undead go away<br/>\n  to make a crossing.  It&#39;s a matter of patience.  Could they have <br/>\n  picked a different zone to screw with?  Sure.  But the average number<br/>\n  of players in Kith at any given time was like 4, now it&#39;s always <br/>\n  populated with at least 10 - 15 people.  And so will Paw become.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Players who are newbies don&#39;t have the items to make witty attacks<br/>\n  on mobs.  I am talking about the upper level people advancing on a<br/>\n  high level mob.  Feign Death is part of that example where they<br/>\n  could have modified the monster&#39;s intelligence and not the player&#39;s<br/>\n  ability.  That point got washed away in your response. I&#39;m<br/>\n  level 40+ now, does that make me a powergamer?  Innoruuk server is<br/>\n  pumping out L50s like there is no tomorrow.  90 people in lguk,<br/>\n  70 people in solb, I mean jeez....  Last time I was in North Qeynos<br/>\n  the snakes took over.  I saw a few L5 people and that was it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Verant will raise the bar, that cannot be stopped.  They have to.<br/>\n  There is a much more mature player base now.  However, I would <br/>\n  like them to evaluate the impact more than they have in the past.<br/>\n  Kithicor Woods was probably a dumb move.  Infected Splitpaw will<br/>\n  be an excellent move.  You know, I love Everfrost.  It&#39;s one zone,<br/>\n  divided into like three level areas of difficulty.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n  mind seeing zones get virtually divided this way more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s ODD I cannot &#39;get over&#39; the USE of &#39;ticks&#39; and CAPITALIZATION.<br/>\n  Emphasizing is a great way to make certain points hit home, overdoing<br/>\n  it makes me, for one, feel like you are YELLING and FRUSTRATED.  It&#39;s<br/>\n  like it&#39;s my fault Verant is upgrading, so you take it out on me.<br/>\n  &lt;sniff&gt;  Hell, you didn&#39;t even sign your name, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
