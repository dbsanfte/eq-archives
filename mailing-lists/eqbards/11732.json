And if you have an enchanter in your group, the group<br/>\nshould fund his/her jewel craft since once that skill is mastered, it can<br/>\nfund your whole group for the rest of your career.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards have a wide and ever growing array of talent.  And these talents serve<br/>\nto enhance the ability of the whole party.  In your youth, your abilities<br/>\nwill be most helpful to those who wield the steel during combat by adding<br/>\nstrength and dexterity as well as shielding from magical attackers and to<br/>\nheal everyone after combat.  Later on you will learn the mana song and your<br/>\ncasters will be delighted (in the early years some casters will insist on<br/>\nthe stamina song - well even though it wont truly help their mana regen - it<br/>\nwill make them happy if you play it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I suggest that you try to get a regular group of bard, enchanter,<br/>\nhealer, tank, tank, optional (healer/druid/shaman/wizard.)  Later on, having<br/>\na druid or wizard will be helpful when you want to leave a dungeon or<br/>\nhunting spot as a group (group gate) either at the end of the hunt or if the<br/>\nmonsters are getting rather insistent that you leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are a bard and will always have the fellowship of other bards no matter<br/>\nwhat guild you have.  But with a guild with lots of other people in lots of<br/>\nother classes, you will have a much better time of getting into good groups.<br/>\nThe only good times I have had with multiple bards in the party have been<br/>\nwhen both have the mana song and then if there is an enchanter as well, the<br/>\ncaster will be thrilled with the rate that their mana regenerates.<br/>\nSometimes much faster than the monsters regenerate and you end up waiting<br/>\nany way.  But my point is - a good group needs a variety of classes.  Each<br/>\nclass has a specialty.  The bard&#39;s talent lies in helping the others do<br/>\ntheir jobs better.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and good hunting,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 38th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tScott Nicholson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tSaturday, December 11, 1999 8:39 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] E&#39;ci Bardic guild?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Scott Nicholson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tGreetings, my experienced colleagues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t_Rhimshot bows_<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI am Rhimshot, a bard of but the 17th song.
