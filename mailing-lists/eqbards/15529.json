I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the textures for the buildings as much as<br/>\nplayer textures.  There isn&#39;t really a noticeable pause when there&#39;s only 1<br/>\nor 2 people by the bank, but if there&#39;s even 10 people, the pause is a lot<br/>\nlonger (relatively, it pauses maybe half a second.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much ram in on your video card?  I have 32M.. that might be why my<br/>\npauses are shorter.. it keeps more textures in Ram..  just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It also happens when I go to the FP bank.  From the area where<br/>\n&gt; the jeweler and cleric&#39;s guild are, you have to go through a<br/>\n&gt; series of sharp turns to get to the bank area.  I usually end<br/>\n&gt; up doing a 180 on that first turn, as the game loads in the<br/>\n&gt; info for the buildings in the new area.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
