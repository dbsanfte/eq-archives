The big burly types should be the ones<br/>\n&gt; soaking the damage and such, not us.  Of course, before they make any<br/>\n&gt; changes like this, they should also fix that tiny little bug that makes us<br/>\n&gt; the primary target ALL the time :(<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m interested in why you think &quot;The Bard was never intended to be a<br/>\ngrunt-class.&quot;  Why do you say that?  We can use all the &quot;grunt&quot; weapons except<br/>\nthe big two handers.  We have strength as a major attribute, just like the<br/>\ngrunts.  How are we not a &quot;big burly type&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;m just one of the &quot;battle bards&quot; getting all wound up here, but I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t understand why people think we shouldn&#39;t have plate just because<br/>\nAlan A-Dale in Robin hood didn&#39;t :)   There&#39;s a specific set of advantages and<br/>\ndisadvantages we have, and clearly plate is meant to be one of the advantages.<br/>\nBards don&#39;t get double attack, kick or archery, but we get dual wield and<br/>\nplate.  Rangers don&#39;t get plate, but they get double attack, archery and<br/>\nkick.   And so on and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
