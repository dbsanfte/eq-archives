After hitting the bank and grabbing an extra<br/>\nflute, I high tailed it into unrest to recovery my possessions. After<br/>\ngetting my corpse and pulling it to the wall I discovered a potentially<br/>\nfatal bug for bards out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my mino horn equiped and was playing the invis song (as I often do<br/>\nwhile looting my corpse) As I retrieved my items I picked up my original<br/>\nmino horn from my corpse. At that precise moment, Shaurii&#39;s happened to<br/>\npulse and...<br/>\n<br/>\nShaurii&#39;s Sonorus Clouding stopped and said you must have a wind instrument<br/>\nequpied.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the???<br/>\n<br/>\nI finished recovering my stuff and decided to test this extensively. Here<br/>\nare my limited conclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have Mino Horn A equiped and playing Shaurii&#39;s, then you pick up Mino<br/>\nHorn B and place it on your pointer, then your song pulses, your song will<br/>\ndrop citing your lack of a wind instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs of yet I have not tried any of this with actual flutes yet, but I was<br/>\nable to replicate this bug over and over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the moral of the story is, if you are looting while invis in a dangerous<br/>\narea, be careful about picking up that wind instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
