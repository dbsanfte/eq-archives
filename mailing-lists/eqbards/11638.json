The leader of the group, a 46 woodelf<br/>\nranger, impressed me with his organizational skills.  He had us (well, the<br/>\nothers who were more or less soloers acting together) working together<br/>\nwith some decent tactics going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, once the guise showed up, he got extremely pissed and left<br/>\nmidfight.  I was rather confused as to why my song graphics weren&#39;t<br/>\nshowing up till I realized what had happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a barbarian warrior shows up, doesn&#39;t tell us he&#39;s new to the area,<br/>\nand falls off the walkway.  I sat up there watching him die, eventually<br/>\nsomeone went down and had a spell cast on them (by one of the NPCs).  I<br/>\ntell the wizard Get ready to evac, and about 30 seconds after the<br/>\nwarrior&#39;s death, the room is mobbed by about 5 frogloks (more on the way,<br/>\nI&#39;m sure), along with a handful of greater darkbone skeletons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, sackless on CT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
