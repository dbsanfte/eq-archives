I&#39;m not saying we<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t useful I know we are I&#39;ve kept more powerful groups alive in<br/>\n&gt; hostile areas for months.. but is it just me or are we being TOOO<br/>\n&gt; limited in our role options? Can some of you higher ups explain?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems mobs go up in level a lot faster than PC characters, to the<br/>\npoint where fighting blue mobs in the late 40&#39;s requires 2 to 4 people<br/>\nin a group at the best of times. (except things like spectres) A bard<br/>\ncan chain and fear a Solusek Kobold if all goes well, but that&#39;s really<br/>\na special case, and if it breaks chains and brings back a friend, you&#39;re<br/>\nzoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, at least in my experience, at higher levels our songs aren&#39;t<br/>\nreally that effective in PvP either. The same duel that started this<br/>\ndiscussion at L45 would likely see the cleric resisting both chain and<br/>\nfear often enough to cause the bard extreme problems, especially if the<br/>\ncleric was a smart PvP player. Clerics, played well, are extremely<br/>\ndeadly at PvP, as their flash of light spell is very fast to cast and<br/>\nseems to be very difficult to resist. I had an unbuffed resist of 65<br/>\nmagic resist and he blinded me multiple times. A friend of mine at L35<br/>\nbeat a L40 warrior in a duel by blinding him, rooting him then blasting<br/>\nhim. He had to run and hide to med to get enough mana to finish the<br/>\nwarrior off but was able to do that because the warrior was blinded and<br/>\ncouldn;t see where he went.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried a bunch of tactics at L48 against a friend of mine who was then<br/>\na L45 warrior in the freeport arena and I found that he resisted way too<br/>\nmuch for me to have a lot of confidence in winning if we were seriously<br/>\ndueling. And this was _before_ the recent changes that increased<br/>\nwarrior&#39;s magic resist. He even removed the resist+ items he was wearing<br/>\nto see if that helped. I had a charisma of 113 at the time so I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink you can make our songs much more effective than they were for me<br/>\nthen. Using a horn for fear increased it&#39;s effectiveness, but the worst<br/>\nwas the unreliability of chain. (plus the fact that sitting and/or<br/>\njboots break it instantly)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne tactic I had hoped would be effective was using lullaby with CoD and<br/>\nthe L48 song, but lullaby has no discernable effect on PC chars at all.<br/>\nThis combo doesn&#39;t even seem to work all that well on mobs, which is<br/>\nreally too bad as nodding them off while your dots kill them would be a<br/>\nnasty way to do them in.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
