I suppose it helped that we were all<br/>\nguildmates, but I&#39;d never fought with any of them before.  We (12 bard, 11<br/>\nwarrior, 14 cleric, 15 druid) were hunting around and on either side of the<br/>\nLavastorm/Najena zone line.  In Lavastorm I was mixing<br/>\nhymn/elemental/bellow, then hymn/anthem/bellow in Najena. For the most part<br/>\nwe had one mob at a time, but at one point the warrior pulled an ogre guard<br/>\n& three large skeletons came with it.  The skely&#39;s were blue to my so, with<br/>\nlute equipped I started weaving hymn/CoD.  My theory was that the warrior<br/>\ncould do a lot more damage to the ogre than me except that she was getting<br/>\nstunned left & right by the skellys.  Better for me to get stunned, right?<br/>\nI no sooner pulled them off her when I hear on of my party scream  &quot;ON BARD<br/>\nON BARD&quot;  The cleric then proceeded to pull the skelly&#39;s off me.  I&#39;ve never<br/>\nfelt so loved!  :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, of course they completely defeating my purpose and extending the<br/>\nfight....<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, twink of twelve tunes, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
