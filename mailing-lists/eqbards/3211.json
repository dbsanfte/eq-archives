I have a stam of 65, which make me slow down a lot after 2 fight<br/>\nin a row.  If there is a third mob I am dead for.  But with claw I have<br/>\nfought 4 barbed skeleton in Unrest and still have stam left over.  Second<br/>\nthing, even though the proc give you a shield of 50-150hp, but with the mob<br/>\nthat I hunt at lvl 22 they can do more than the average dmg to me which goes<br/>\nthrough the shield but when I used the claw I find that I get hit very<br/>\nlittle.  As I increase in lvl the mob will hit a lot harder and I need all<br/>\nthe agi I can get.  Third, the weapon is very slow compared to the Claw.  I<br/>\nhit like 4 times per melee without the dual wield.  In the end the dmg is<br/>\nthe same or better and it helps a lot against magic users which most of the<br/>\nmob that u hunt at high lvl used magic.  This is my personal preference.  I<br/>\nthink the guy I traded it with was very happy with the trade and so was I<br/>\nand I can always get another tomahawk at my lvl rather than wait till lvl 30<br/>\nto get a claw.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\nHammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\nChampions of Norrath, The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam DeMarino [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psycotix@...\">psycotix@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 09, 1999 1:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Demon Claw (Bladed Thulian)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Adam DeMarino &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psycotix@...\">psycotix@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy god trading a tomhawk for a claw?!
