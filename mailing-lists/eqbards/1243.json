Even<br/>\nrangers have spent a long time waiting around lfaydrk to get this named NPC<br/>\nwasp on tracking to no avail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about the Crookstinger is that its stinger can be used as a magic<br/>\nattack weapon:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The crookstinger is found an a named Wasp in Lesser Faydark. This is a good<br/>\nlow level magic weapon as it can be obtained at &lt;10 levels. It has a damage<br/>\nof 4, a delay of 21 and also has a weak poison effect. &quot; - taken from:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/crookstinger.html\">http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/crookstinger.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems logical to me that attacking lots of giant wasps is what causes<br/>\nthis NPC to spawn although I have never thought of it before.  Be careful to<br/>\nkeep this thread within our little bard list or suddenly in a few days you<br/>\nwill hear &quot;auctioning crookstinger dagger, 3pp, give tell&quot; all over the<br/>\ngfaydrk zone ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Faras the drunkard bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn<br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 5:45 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: EQBards<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Pulsating brood clutch (off-topic)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom CPT - 30th Signal Bn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ReeceT@...\">ReeceT@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry about posting off-topic but for some reason I have <br/>\n&gt; email access but<br/>\n&gt; not Internet access. As a result, I can&#39;t post this question <br/>\n&gt; on EQVault.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night while adventuring in Lesser Faydark, my party was <br/>\n&gt; attacked by the<br/>\n&gt; Spider Queen (can&#39;t remember her last name).  I had never <br/>\n&gt; seen this NPC<br/>\n&gt; before so perhaps this is part of a new quest.  I do know we <br/>\n&gt; killed a lot of<br/>\n&gt; giant spiders so that may have caused her to spawn.  Anyway, <br/>\n&gt; after we killed<br/>\n&gt; her, I looted an item called a pulsating brood clutch.  <br/>\n&gt; Right-clicking on<br/>\n&gt; the item only displayed the name and the weight.  Didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; mention anything<br/>\n&gt; like Lore/Magic item.  I asked around and no one had ever <br/>\n&gt; heard of this<br/>\n&gt; item.  I went to a shop and was offered 7PP for it.  Thinking <br/>\n&gt; it may be a<br/>\n&gt; quest item, I decided not to sell it.  I also looted a poison <br/>\n&gt; sac from the<br/>\n&gt; Queen. The icons for the two items are similar, both looking <br/>\n&gt; like a kidney.<br/>\n&gt; My guess is if this item is not a quest item, it can be used <br/>\n&gt; by a rogue to<br/>\n&gt; create poison, although I don&#39;t think this skill has been <br/>\n&gt; implemented yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any information on this item?  I need the PP <br/>\n&gt; but if its<br/>\n&gt; part of a quest would like to try and solve it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a related note, I saw three other named NPCs in Lesser Faydark last<br/>\n&gt; night.  One was Crookstinger, a NPC wasp, another was a named <br/>\n&gt; fairie whose<br/>\n&gt; name I can&#39;t recollect, and the unicorn Equestrielle.  In <br/>\n&gt; addition to the<br/>\n&gt; Spider Queen, I had never seen any of these NPCs before.  <br/>\n&gt; There were several<br/>\n&gt; groups in the area attacking both wasps and fairie creatures. <br/>\n&gt;  The general<br/>\n&gt; consensus of everyone in the area was that killing these <br/>\n&gt; creatures caused<br/>\n&gt; Crookstinger and the named fairie to appear.  No one was foolish/brave<br/>\n&gt; enough to attack the unicorn.  Its good to see that Verant <br/>\n&gt; has started to<br/>\n&gt; beef up some of the zones.  Has anyone notived similar <br/>\n&gt; additions in other<br/>\n&gt; zones?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
