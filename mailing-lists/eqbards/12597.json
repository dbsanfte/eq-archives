When I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1464322902\">After reading on this board that pixie strike can interrupt spell casters<br/>\nattempts at casting a spell, I have tried using this song for this purpose.<br/>\nWhen I see the text message that the mob is starting to cast a spell, I<br/>\nimmediately stop what I&#39;m playing and start up pixie strike.  In just about<br/>\nevery situation where I have tried this, the mob is still able to<br/>\nsuccessfully cast the spell before the pixie strike goes into effect.  How<br/>\nhave you guys gotten this to work? Do you continuously pixie strike at the<br/>\nexpense of weaving other songs or is there a better way to time it?  All our<br/>\nsongs take 3 seconds to go off.  Assuming we start the song as soon as you<br/>\nsee the message &quot;mob starts casting a spell&quot;, we should be able to interrupt<br/>\nany spell that takes 4 second or longer to cast.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, how long does it take for the mob to get a heal spell<br/>\noff?  My group was fighting glyphed warders in Mistmoore the other night and<br/>\nit kept healing itself, even though I kept trying to pixie strike it.  It<br/>\nreally irritated me because my strike usually kicked in right after they got<br/>\nthe heal off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, will pixie strike interrupt a spell even if the mob successfully<br/>\nresists?  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
