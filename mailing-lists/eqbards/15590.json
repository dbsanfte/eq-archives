Last night, I made the mistake of consenting<br/>\n&gt; someone to drag Tani&#39;s corpse out of the Scryer room in Guk.  Well, long<br/>\n&gt; story short, all my armor and weapons were stolen (punishment for<br/>\ntwinking,<br/>\n&gt; heh) by this guy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are all sorts of complicating sidelines to this story which I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; spare<br/>\n&gt; you.  Although I know it was always a risk, I just never thought someone<br/>\n&gt; would be so mean and viscious.  The items are just items, but people that<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; that stuff just plain suck!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Guess I&#39;ll have to make a contest to see how much of my quest stuff I can<br/>\n&gt; get back in one week.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope you&#39;re all having a great day... and DON&#39;T CONSENT SOMEONE YOU DON&#39;T<br/>\n&gt; KNOW!!!<br/>\n&gt; (most of you have probably figured that out - guess I get to wear the<br/>\nnaive<br/>\n&gt; banner for the week)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tani 20th nekkid Bard<br/>\n&gt; Halana 50th Shamana<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; MAXIMIZE YOUR CARD, MINIMIZE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
