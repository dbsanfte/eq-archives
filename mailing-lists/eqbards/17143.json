I&#39;ve never understood why being able to be bound<br/>\nanywhere by a caster was taken out during Beta.  When they did it EVERYONE<br/>\ncomplained.  To this day my single biggest bitch about EQ is the fact that<br/>\ncasters can bind themselves anywhere but can only bind melee classes in<br/>\ntown.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I ask &quot;Why&quot; even of my friends on the Dev team the only answer I get is<br/>\nthat &quot;it was the way we wanted it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I think it&#39;s extremely lame that Verant takes the attitude that<br/>\n&quot;Walking back to the dungeon to get your corpse adds to the realism&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fail to understand how &quot;Getting to your corpse&quot; can add to realism?<br/>\nYou&#39;re dead, how on earth do you walk anywhere? ;)  Getting to the DUNGEON<br/>\nin the first place is the realism.  Binding there should be allowed (IMHO)<br/>\nif you can get a caster to do it.  It was that way for the first 3 phases of<br/>\nBeta.  They took out binding anywhere during P3.5.  I remain unconvinced<br/>\nthat there is any real reason for this and it&#39;s extremely irritating.  The<br/>\n_only_ reason they did it was to slow down players ability to level.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant has a serious case of US (Verant) vs. THEM (Players).  The fact that<br/>\nwe leveled faster than expected was distressing to them so rather than<br/>\nbalance the xp awarded they made us unable to bind near the zones.  Go<br/>\nfigure.  Verant took the easy way out and thus made melee classes 10x less<br/>\nfun to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ L<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Papa Legba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 4:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] On binding<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Binding has become the poster child for what is wrong with Verant.  95%<br/>\n&gt; of the EQ players would be happy/inddiferent to Verant adding some<br/>\n&gt; equivalent of Lifestones (yes I&#39;ve been cheating on EQ with AC, viva La<br/>\n&gt; Diferance!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The programming would not be hard (an NPC who you give 1P to).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why not do it?  &quot;Its not part of our vision.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt DeBarger<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; LOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
