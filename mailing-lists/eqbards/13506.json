It&#39;s nice<br/>\nbecause you can sing it. This song is also extremely useful vs. druids<br/>\nor mages. Get rooted or snared, maybe a DoT like creeping crud (little<br/>\ndog barking icon), or even Tashani or Malise? all can easily be debuffed<br/>\noff yourself. If you need to get rid of it faster you can pumice<br/>\nyourself. I use the target debuff because you can use it on both<br/>\nyourself and a monster, and the other only works on yourself only (and<br/>\nparty) and I believe requires the lute to be equipped to function (it<br/>\nalso strips 2 buffs though).<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thudnerwold, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I do not mean to raise an alarm especially on a song that was never<br/>\n&gt; particularly useful.  However I just had been hit with a Steal<br/>\n&gt; Strength<br/>\n&gt; spell by a SK when passing through South Karana.  I took the<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; test one of our more useless songs.. after 10 pulses it never managed<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; remove the spell.  I ask our stronger kin to please test these results<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; make sure the song was not killed again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Adon </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
