The next time I log on, I&#39;m<br/>\ngonna submit a bug report.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBug report wording:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 23d level bard with maxed out singing and string skills.  I was<br/>\nfighting evil eyes in Beholder when I got hit with the Shallow Breath spell.<br/>\nI started singing the 22d level bard song which is supposed to remove<br/>\nnegative spell effects.  I got the &quot;static pulse&quot; message which indicates<br/>\nthe song is active.  The Shallow Breath DOT was not removed.  If the song<br/>\nworked properly the Shallow Breath DOT should have been removed.  Several<br/>\nbards on the EQBard Onelist have reported the same experience with this<br/>\nsong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that cover just about everything needed in a bug report?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; Has anyone tried playing the 22d level song while under the influence of<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; negative spell, with a lute equipped, and themselves targetted (by<br/>\n&gt; hitting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the F1 key or left-clicking on their name).  The times I have tried to<br/>\n&gt; use<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes.  I&#39;ve tried targeting myself, targeting a party member,<br/>\n&gt; targeting the mob who cast the spell, having it playing when<br/>\n&gt; the effect is cast, with both positive and negative spell<br/>\n&gt; effects.  Nothing.  Given that the level 40 song was broken<br/>\n&gt; until we complained about it, I do believe that there&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; slight chance that it&#39;s within the realm of possibility that<br/>\n&gt; the level 22 song is also broken.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
