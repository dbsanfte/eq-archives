Instead, he&#39;s gotten it before me, and thus dumped<br/>\nthe camping congestion his item caused onto me when I go to<br/>\nget them.  Like I said, cutting in line.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo use your terminology above, a line progresses at x minutes/<br/>\nperson.  So (given a fixed number of people) a line will<br/>\ndissipate in the same amount of time no matter how the order<br/>\nis shuffled.  But you can&#39;t deny that people in the middle<br/>\nhave a legitimate gripe if someone in front gives their<br/>\nfriends (secondary characters) in back a cut to the front.<br/>\nCalling them jealous because someone behind them got to go to<br/>\nthe front is just plain stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I see far more often happen is that a player will give his lower level<br/>\n&gt; characters, or friends, his hand-me-down items once he has better - which<br/>\n&gt; is a GOOD thing in terms of NOT having to camp for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup, this stuff I don&#39;t have much problem with, though as I&#39;ve<br/>\nsaid it should be limited to items appropriate for the level<br/>\nif you don&#39;t want to lessen the gaming experience.  I do it<br/>\nwith abandon just to save them some of the grief I went<br/>\nthrough to get some of my items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And yes, too many people simply have not learned the difference between<br/>\n&gt; single-player, and multi-player games. That is at the heart of a lot of<br/>\n&gt; problems online worlds have. Perhaps society is just tuned into ME ME ME,<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;ve met folks that had utter and total disregard for PEOPLE around<br/>\n&gt; them, treating them all no better than your average NPC. It&#39;s a big sandbox<br/>\n&gt; folks, we can all play nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like I said in the other OT thread, I think this problem will<br/>\nstart to disappear as virtual worlds start to gain legitimacy,<br/>\nand people start to think of them more as a theme park like<br/>\nDisneyland, instead of a game.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
