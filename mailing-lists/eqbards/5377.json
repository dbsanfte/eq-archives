What I generally do<br/>\nis spend about 4 hours there and leave with 3 FS weapons, a couple pieces of<br/>\nbronze armor, some jade or other stones, some words, 1 rare drop like the<br/>\nthick apron, or savants cap and about 10pp or so in coin.  I have 100STR and<br/>\nI am not a monk so I can go right up to my weight limit, usually can carry<br/>\nover 30units of weight worth of crap before I start to go over the limit and<br/>\nnotice adverse affects on my stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then go to Kelethin and sell the bronze for about 2pp per AC point, sell<br/>\nthe rare drop for what I can get for it (around 20pp) and then sell the FS<br/>\nand misc loot to my bard guild who I am amiable with and I have a 110CHA.<br/>\nAt 3-6pp per FS weapon and 10-20 or so per bronze plus the rare drop plus<br/>\nthe cash coin I looted, I can make around 50pp - but don&#39;t get me wrong, I<br/>\ndo have to work for it...and it does take about 4 hours and some luck.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am level 24 an I can only seem to maintain around 300 plat and I am still<br/>\nin mostly banded armor and wielding a Dragoon dirk and a Pugius dagger so<br/>\nI&#39;m not really bragging.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras &quot;the blue collar bard&quot; Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 19, 1999 9:38 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] EQ plat was: Elf Hide gloves : was trading the<br/>\n&gt; stei n comments<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think a lot of you people gushing about how easy it is to <br/>\n&gt; make money via<br/>\n&gt; loot are exaggerating.  I have a 23rd monk that works his <br/>\n&gt; butt off and he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; never had more than about 125pp in the bank at any one time.  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve spent time<br/>\n&gt; in unrest.  Where&#39;s the money there?  FS weapons?  The cash <br/>\n&gt; drops aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; *that* great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired <br/>\n&gt; of reading about<br/>\n&gt; how others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aggrevated,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yoyodyne on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Chris Kuenster (Entex) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 19, 1999 9:21 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] EQ plat was: Elf Hide gloves : was <br/>\n&gt; trading the stei n<br/>\n&gt; comments<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Aye, its all relative. Plats are very easy to get even <br/>\n&gt; after level 20. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have never had less than 100 in the bank since then and <br/>\n&gt; almost always over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1000. Today I am buying Blk Pearl Plat earrings and will <br/>\n&gt; have up to 1000 to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blow on failures and if they all fail the only thing thats <br/>\n&gt; a pain is getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4 more BPs to play with. Replacing the 1000 is really easy. <br/>\n&gt; This is why I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; love the bazaars, I trade basically useless Plats for <br/>\n&gt; awesome items I or my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends can actually use, what a great concept.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
