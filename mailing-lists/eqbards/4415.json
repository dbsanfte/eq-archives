I ll save the surprise of the lake for you... swim along the bottom, though... heheh. Ah well, can t swim across zones.

Can you zone to/from the<br/>\n&gt;Ocean Of Tears? Who needs a stinky boat - I&#39;m swimming from Freeport to<br/>\n&gt;Butcherblock!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll save the surprise of the lake for you... swim along the bottom,<br/>\nthough... heheh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well, can&#39;t swim across zones.  If we could, that&#39;s the way I would<br/>\ntravel through the ocean o tears for sure!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;PSS: Does anyone else think that there should be a merchant or a bar in the<br/>\n&gt;boat? I&#39;d love to see some drunken Bards roaming around the deck.. playing<br/>\n&gt;silly songs.. falling off.. trying to swim while drunk..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was drunk and fell off the boat once.  It almost seems like there was<br/>\nmeant to be an NPC bartender down there, doesn&#39;t it?  Ever notice you cannot<br/>\ntrade, while on the boat?  Or drop anything?  Casters can&#39;t cast spells...<br/>\nbut bards can sing songs?  (That should be something to keep in mind if you<br/>\nplay on the racewar server... denon&#39;s anyone? hehe)  However that crazy code<br/>\nworks for boats, probably won&#39;t allow NPCs.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;PSSS: Does anyone else think it would be the greatest thing to have an<br/>\n&gt;undead ferryman that you had to give a copper or silver to in order to get<br/>\n&gt;across the rivers around Antonica? Could even make it some Spectre type<br/>\n&gt;thing like the river Styx.. The things you think about while running nekkid<br/>\n&gt;from Freeport to Qeynos screaming Selo&#39;s eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A fine idea!  But really, the ferryman should be somewhere on one of the<br/>\nplanes!  Anyone else jacked up about the plane of FEAR opening tomorrow?  I<br/>\nfor one am going in there naked with a drum and a minotaur horn... scout<br/>\naround a little!  Fear would be entered through Oasis I presume.  O how the<br/>\nspectres will be running around the beach tomorrow I have a feeling!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
