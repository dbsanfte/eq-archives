Of course as usual none of the<br/>\nchanges were listed in the patch message (Gordon if you read this put a big<br/>\nyellow post-it note on your computer monitor that reads: &#39;ANY BARD CHANGES?&#39;<br/>\n*grin*).  Anyway here is the good, bad, and the ugly:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Good<br/>\n-Piercing weapon skill cap has been raised to be in-line with our other<br/>\nweapon skills.<br/>\n-Psalm of Purity & Psalm of Vitality now cure poison and disease.  The<br/>\ndrawback is on a cure pulse you lose the resist bonus.  Seems a fair trade<br/>\noff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bad<br/>\n-Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain was stealth nerfed hard last night.  In an effort to<br/>\nbalance Selo&#39;s Assonait Strane VI put a hard limit on movement speed debuffs<br/>\nserver side.  Unfortunately the hard limit was based of the spell line with<br/>\nthe worst movement speed debuff, the necromancer Darkness line.  This nerf<br/>\nnot only affected our three movement debuffs (Chains, Strane, & Largo&#39;s<br/>\nAbsonant Binding) it also hit the druid/ranger Snare line.  It testing last<br/>\nnight Chains did not stop feared or fleeing (non-feared) mobs till about 25%<br/>\nhealth at 52nd level, it used to stop them cold at 50%.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ugly<br/>\n-Gordon posted the following to the Bard Issues thread on the Sony Gameplay<br/>\nforum, my notes are proceeded by *:<br/>\nAbashi<br/>\nStation Member posted 06-06-2000 06:11 PM         ┬á┬áThis thread will need to<br/>\nbe closed due to its size soon. When someone reposts the issue, I&#39;d prefer<br/>\nit if you could remove the items that we&#39;ve commented on, or at least<br/>\nindicate its status.I&#39;ve gotten word on many of the issues from various<br/>\nmembers of the team:<br/>\nPurity and Vitality are fixed in code. It should be live now. If it isn&#39;t,<br/>\nit is on test and will be live at the next client patch.<br/>\n*This is live, yeah!<br/>\n<br/>\nKellin&#39;s has been referred to our testing department.<br/>\n*About time, lets hope they fix lullaby this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyssa&#39;s Concord is confirmed and agreed as bug. The client programmer has it<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n*This should also fix the problem with Psalm of Warmth & Cooling as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelo&#39;s Constant Chain is in testing.<br/>\n*Grrrrr, lets hope they fix the movement debuff on this fast the testing<br/>\nreferred to is about early breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngstlich&#39;s Appauling Screech: Fear spells do not cause NPCs to stop<br/>\ncasting. Works as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolidarity of Vision: Works as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohthan&#39;s Provocation: We&#39;ve reduced the fizzle rate and added the message.<br/>\nRemainder works as intended. Changes are live.<br/>\n*These changes did not go live.  It still fizzle way too much and has no<br/>\nadded message.<br/>\n<br/>\nNiv&#39;s: Works as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of Travel: Opinions requested and placed on the board. I believe the<br/>\nconsensus was to remove the invis component, yes?<br/>\n*To quote Gordon &#39;Ack!&#39;, a thread has already started to keep Song of Travel<br/>\nas is.<br/>\n<br/>\nLargo&#39;s: Range has been increased. Changes are live. Still looking into PvP<br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n*No feedback or testing on this yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nNillipus&#39;: Works as intended currently. We&#39;re open to removing the damage<br/>\nshield component if you wish. Thoughts?<br/>\n*To quote Gordon again, &#39;Ack!&#39; This is a specialized song that has some<br/>\ngreat uses. I personally hope they leave it alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSong of Twilight: Works as intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssonant Strain: fixed as requested.<br/>\n*Fixed and nerfed<br/>\n<br/>\nBombastic Bellow: Fixed and live.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Broken Quest Issues&quot; are not broken quests. They are preexisting<br/>\nstories for future expansion.<br/>\n*Not sure if this applies to Fabian or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kunark Armor&quot;: Well my list says &quot;fixed&quot; but I don&#39;t have what they ment by<br/>\nthat.
