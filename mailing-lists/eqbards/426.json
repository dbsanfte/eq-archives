Sure Crushbone is <br/>\nthere but generally jerks also.  Steamfont would be great but the mino hero <br/>\nhas a tendency to roam around and hurt me before I can run in time.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nheard of Dagnor&#39;s, but also heard it&#39;s slightly barren.  Chessboard in BB, <br/>\nwell, tired of wizards kill stealing while me, or my group takes all the <br/>\ndamage. Basically just want any information you can give, or should I think <br/>\nabout moving to Freeport?<br/>\n<br/>\nBryne<br/>\nSongweaver<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
