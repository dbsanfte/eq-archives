I&#39;ve always enjoyed talking to you Talani,<br/>\ndidn&#39;t mean anything personally.  Besides, this list is dead at least we<br/>\nare talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had only 1 shaman for a long time, but he is insane.  If we had 6 he<br/>\nwould not know what to do.  They have 2 now, to ease his pain somewhat.<br/>\nI was not bored with my bard, if you are referring to me.  I was not<br/>\nbored with the game, I was going through a strange time in my life, I<br/>\nquit because of RL not the game.  I was only 59, so I still had a long<br/>\nbit of exp&#39;ing to do, which is when bards are useful and fun.  If I<br/>\ncould go back, I would have left for those 10 weeks and not deleted, but<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think I would ever play again, and deleting was a way to ensure<br/>\nthat (guess it didn&#39;t work).  I play for fun and casually now, I do not<br/>\nwant 60 nor be in AL again, I can not and do not want to raid 6 nights a<br/>\nweek for 7 hours a night.  I can raid for less, the only quais-mandatory<br/>\nraids (you can&#39;t really force someone to come eh?) are the 2 nights of<br/>\nclearing North ToV, but then I would be where I left, the bottom of the<br/>\ntotem pole, which is not a good thing to be in AL.  It&#39;s not for casual<br/>\nplayers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time I quit there were 4 bards in the guild: me, Thott, Jaco,<br/>\nSyren all 60 but me hehe.  As of a week ago, there was 1 bard, Thott.  I<br/>\nquit, Syren moved and had no ISP for 4 months, and Jaco quit because he<br/>\nwas tired of being in the buff group.  So for 4 months AL had 1 bard<br/>\n(Syren just came back this week).  If bards were as needed as many<br/>\nthink, would AL of all guilds only have 1 bard for 4 months and have<br/>\naccomplished what they have?<br/>\n<br/>\nShada/Erisi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 24, 2001 9:13 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Be very afraid....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nowie =/<br/>\nhehe<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I can see your points Shada, but I have to also say that I still do<br/>\nbelieve Bards are useful on raids.  People say shaman are useful on<br/>\nraids..<br/>\nsure, 3 shaman are, but 6?  If there are 6 shaman on our raids I just<br/>\nsit<br/>\nthere and play Diablo on my other comp. (Hope nobody from my guild is<br/>\nreading this!)  And again, I haven&#39;t played a bard on 40+ person raids.<br/>\nI<br/>\ndo know that our main Necro switched to the bard character of someone<br/>\nwho<br/>\nhad left the game (Iridis), and he is constantly amazed at how much more<br/>\nuseful bards are than necros in group raids.<br/>\n<br/>\n*shrug*<br/>\nMaybe its that we all just get bored after a while?<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana/Tani</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
