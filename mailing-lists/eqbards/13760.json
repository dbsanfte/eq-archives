When they have too little to do, a lot of them end <br/>\nup bailing out of Guk, etc., and choose to do &quot;interesting&quot; things.  <br/>\nOne example of an &quot;interesting&quot; thing that someone chose to do this <br/>\nweekend:  a level 30ish player was in Blackburrow apparently trying to <br/>\nsee how many MOBs he could kill in as little time as possible.  The <br/>\ndifference between Blackburrow with 20 players of an appropriate level, <br/>\nand Blackburrow with 20 players of an appropriate level and one level 30 <br/>\nkilling everything in sight is vast.  At another point in the weekend, <br/>\na level 25 or so was helping three level 6-8s power level.  They sure <br/>\nwere cranking through all the gnolls, and I mean ALL the gnolls.  Same <br/>\nproblem.  I&#39;m sure it was amusing for these guys, but it really sucked <br/>\nfor the rest of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Naeeldar makes the point that there are less crowded zones to hunt <br/>\nin.  That&#39;s fine for binding classes, but who wants to have to cross six <br/>\nzones to retrieve a body?<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\nAangie, warrior 16, Innoruuk<br/>\nBisibiku, enchantress 12, Innoruuk<br/>\nSalana, shaman 9, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
