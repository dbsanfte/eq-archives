Fairly easy to charm kite<br/>\nthings on the beach below, and now there is less of a danger of getting<br/>\ncremated by ae drake spells since the patch. Before then I was afraid to<br/>\neven sit around for any length of time. If someone would train 2 drakes by<br/>\nyou, and I mean even *close* to you, you&#39;d be hit by their ae prolly 2x<br/>\neach, and at avg of 400+ per shot, that&#39;s 1600 of your hps gone right there.<br/>\nUnbuffed at 55 I have a good bit less than that!   /mourn Pava<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPava<br/>\nCT</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
