You ARE awfully cute.  :)  I&#39;ll have to try that with my<br/>\nfavorite complaining Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - /em blushes fiercely<br/>\n   Awww your a sweetie to say so....<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am sure your cleric would just love you for that little trick....<br/>\n<br/>\n  Only one this time, but it was Kelin&#39;s Lute!  Also got an Imbrued Bracer,<br/>\nwhich I will proudly  wear,  even though the Lambent is better.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - You&#39;ll have to stop by some time with your clothes on so I can see :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is the Sarnak Fort good for level 24s?  I want to find someplace in Lake<br/>\nof Ill Omen where my Warrior  can sit for a few levels.  She&#39;s too darned<br/>\nslow to move around.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - I hunted at the Lake till level 27(makes that song so long ago...) so<br/>\nexp around the whole area is good.  If you want a full group of 24 and up<br/>\nthe back door of the fort would be fine.  If you have a damn good group<br/>\nstorm it (we did - and I remember dragging corpses too..).  If you can only<br/>\nfind one or two people the water ruins are a great pull spot.  The ones that<br/>\nare a marker of sorts for the FM zone.  There&#39;s plenty of blues to yellows<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you have any questions about the lower levels of Kunark let me know :)<br/>\nI have been living there since 16.  And 11 of those levels were spent at the<br/>\nLake.  The other two in Frontier Mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jacana Mourningsong<br/>\n  Wood Elf of the 29th Song<br/>\n  &lt;Crimson Dragons&gt; on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
