Even on Veeshan I never had a<br/>\nproblem.  Pickup groups were nearly as good as some of our guild groups,<br/>\nsome were worse but none were as bad as some of the things you&#39;ve related on<br/>\nthis board ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO Pickup groups are awesome because you get to learn new tactics to go<br/>\nwith other people who you aren&#39;t used to grouping with.  Maybe I just adapt<br/>\non the fly better.  Maybe you just have some really lousy players on your<br/>\nserver ;)  Dunno.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with a pickup group.<br/>\n<br/>\nBiggest Key in a pickup group:  Talk about who&#39;s going to do what before you<br/>\nhead anywhere in the dungeon.  Don&#39;t wait till AFTER you start breaking the<br/>\nroom to discuss who does what.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cyr, Thierry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 08, 2000 3:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Guise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; well let me explain myself then, i was assuming he was going to guk alone<br/>\n&gt; considering he had invis potions, i myself hate pickup groups (remember<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; threads named Group from hell? well i&#39;ve had 2 in a row). So unless you<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; to guk with a group, hope there&#39;s someone in the tower allready so ya can<br/>\n&gt; join up with them, or ya might end up like me last night, with a warrior<br/>\n&gt; getting to the bridge, yelling uh oh and training all the wizards and the<br/>\n&gt; gibs to the BR. needless to say i didnt make it to the zone. So ya i hope<br/>\n&gt; for him that unless he has a group allready, that the ass is camped or<br/>\nhe&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; never get it alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 08, 2000 2:59 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Guise<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 02:21 PM 8/8/00 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sure he can form a group, but most chances are the place is camped,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;secondly, if he just wants to go in and out, if its camped means he can<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there for only a couple spawns as most often the masks rot away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; the room may be camped most of the time, i just disagreed immensely with<br/>\n&gt; the part i quoted, i.e. &#39;&#39;first, hope that the ass/supp is camped&#39;&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
