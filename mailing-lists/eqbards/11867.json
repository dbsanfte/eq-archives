What they don&#39;t understand is that to do so is<br/>\nalmost always a death sentence for ME.  And frankly, I&#39;m tired of being the<br/>\nsacrificial lamb.   If you&#39;re not a healer, you can&#39;t understand the power<br/>\nof a heal taunt  - Bards can, cuz practically every song is as big of a<br/>\ntaunt as heal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOften, I join a group as the healer, and because I&#39;m a<br/>\nshaman, my group wants:<br/>\n1.\tHeals<br/>\n2.\tChloroplast/Regen<br/>\n3.\tBuffs (Str/dex/agi/hp/sta/ac)<br/>\n4.\tSlowdown/Quicken<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tNow, I am not a wisdom freak - 150ish, so Togors (slowdown)<br/>\nand Quicken 2-3 party members takes 2 bubs of mana.  Buffing same three with<br/>\ntwo buffs takes me down to 1.5 bubs.  Chloroplast takes almost a full bub<br/>\nalone - per person!  Now where is the mana for heals? So sometimes, you have<br/>\nto choose, can&#39;t give everyone what they want or cast things in the order<br/>\nothers think you should.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnyway, my point, I guess is that while I AGREE personally<br/>\nthat a shaman should Togors before DOTing, DOTing takes less mana and is<br/>\nmuch faster casting...and sometimes the malise is worth it on high resistant<br/>\nmobs if it helps the casters do full damage instead of 12.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tStressed at work (and guessing you can tell that by how<br/>\ncranky this email sounds :-))<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tTani 17th Bard<br/>\n\t\tHalana 40th Shaman<br/>\n\t\tSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom:\tDave Gaines [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\t\t\tSent:\tWednesday, December 15, 1999 12:46<br/>\nPM<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\t\t\tSubject:\tRe: [eqbards] Song Taunting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFrom: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\tWhile I agree perfectly with this post, you<br/>\nare contradicting yourself<br/>\n\t\t\t\tquite well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t1.
