I have a<br/>\nmessage to this list originally by Ryan Honeyman (Harmonic) that I printed<br/>\nout back early September and that has yellowed with age near my computer.<br/>\nIn it he describes what he feels to be the best jewelry setup for Bards.<br/>\nAfter taking a hard look at the comprehensive jewelry table at<br/>\nwww.castersrealm.com I found that I couldn&#39;t disagree with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose a bard that thought he/she was a tank would make vastly different<br/>\nselections, and to be honest the jeweler thought I was nuts having her make<br/>\nthis setup.  She didn&#39;t even know that there *was* a Gold Star Ruby ring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the setup described below and am very pleased with it, but was<br/>\nwondering what others differing viewpoint on the subject was, and if better<br/>\njewelry is perhaps available in dungeons that I should consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current stats in mostly Lambent are:<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR 106<br/>\nSTA 75<br/>\nAGI 104<br/>\nDEX 138<br/>\nWIS 60<br/>\nINT 79<br/>\nCHA 121<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier Sharpsong - 34th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the text from Harmonic&#39;s old message 8/10/99:<br/>\n<br/>\n--- --- ---<br/>\nI have looked over all the jewellery that an enchanter can make.<br/>\nI also realize there are earrings, rings, etc available to higher<br/>\nlevel players from dungeons.  This is my take on the best player<br/>\nmade jewellery in the game for a bard, and what I currently wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nface:    platinum star ruby veil, cha9 dex9<br/>\nneck:    golden black pearl choker, agi7 dex7<br/>\near:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>\near:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>\nfinger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>\nfinger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>\n<br/>\nmost bards, have a good charisma and strength base to start<br/>\ndex is extremely important, and agility is to some extent.<br/>\nintellegence and wisdom are completely useless in day to day<br/>\nbardic activities, although I have wis/int gear for trade skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nthis combo gives, dex30, agi7, int4, str8, cha19<br/>\nand this is the best you can get player made, best in the game imo.<br/>\n<br/>\ncouple this with elfhide gloves, ac4, dex5, agi5  (brd rog only)<br/>\nand troll hide belt, ac5, str5, sta5 (brd rog only)<br/>\n<br/>\nyou have a extremely well balanced bard, statistically speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 33rd charm master.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk<br/>\n--- --- ---</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
