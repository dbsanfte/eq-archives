IG&#39;s<br/>\ncharm well for me and I&#39;ve never had huge amounts of charisma. Currently<br/>\n114. The Story (forgive me if you&#39;ve heard it before): the one and only Vox<br/>\nraid I ever went on was a followup to a failed raid. All the IG&#39;s and stuff<br/>\nwere randomly repoping. The leaders thought we had them all killed and we<br/>\nwent for Vox. She came out into the hall rather than us getting her in the<br/>\nlair as planned so it got confused pretty quick and then an Ice Giant Magi<br/>\njoined in the fray from behind. My tanks went down in the first wave and<br/>\nthen my cleric, who was bound in the king room at least. So me all alone<br/>\nabout to go melee Vox when the cleric said try to charm the IG. I figure I&#39;m<br/>\noverdue for dead anyway and charmed it and sent it after Vox. We killed Vox,<br/>\nand the IG magi when he was no longer useful as a pet, and I lived. Terrible<br/>\nloot drop on Vox but it was one of the funniest, make it up as you go things<br/>\nI ever survived! <br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony: server population was 2500 last night :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
