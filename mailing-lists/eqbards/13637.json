He stated this when Paw was upgraded so you<br/>\ncan take his &quot;mid level&quot; as someone suitable to play Paw. As Brad has<br/>\ndirect access to the customer database, I think this provides a perfect<br/>\nexample of the uselessness of web polls. The only thing that poll tells<br/>\nyou is that 6% of the people who go to everlore and bothered to take the<br/>\npoll (and only voted once) have a 45+ character. I hope you can<br/>\nunderstand the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
