I was an <br/>\namateur bard in the SCA for 10 years, and played a harper on several <br/>\ndifferent Pern MOOs back when I was heavily into text-based online gaming. <br/>\n So the Bard was a natural character choice for me.  Also, I liked the idea <br/>\nof a class that was designed to compliment a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have occasionally had trouble finding a group to party with, but most of <br/>\nthe time groups are very happy to have me join unless they already have <br/>\nanother bard with them.  Most players around my level on Solusek Ro are <br/>\nvery aware of the benefits of having a bard in the party -- especially the <br/>\nmonks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
