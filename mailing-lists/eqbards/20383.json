All went smoothly<br/>\n(despite the fact that I had an idiot cleric), and Naggy was soon dead,<br/>\ndropping a CoF and an orb among other things.  When it came time to<br/>\nrandom the cloak, the rule was this--anyone who was a tank was in, and<br/>\nanyone who would not actually use it should remove their name from the<br/>\nlotto.  Being a bard, not a true tank, I removed myself from the lotto. <br/>\nThe other bard on the run, however, did *not* remove herself.  As a<br/>\nresult, the two people who had brought me put my name back on the list,<br/>\nagainst my wishes.  Random happens and guess what?  The little bard has<br/>\nwon her first random ever (yeah, you heard right, in 15 months of EQ, I<br/>\nhave never won a random).  Woo!  Brand new CoF.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don it, it is lovely, and then I hand it back.  Of all the people<br/>\nthere, all the tanks who have been on 9, 10, even more Naggy runs and<br/>\nseen nothing even close, it went to a bard, who can barely use the haste<br/>\nin comparison with their double-attacking, quisinart selves.  My<br/>\ninstructions were to re-random it, and not let the other bard in either. <br/>\nPerhaps that was harsh, but if it was to go to a bard instead of a real<br/>\ntank, it should be the one who won, not the greedy latecomer (she did not<br/>\nshow up until about time to random the mith greaves...hmm).  <br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily for me, an orb also dropped, and the other bard already had one<br/>\n(as this particular group does bards before casters for orbs), so I got a<br/>\nnice toy anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want to know is how many people here agree with what I did, and<br/>\nhow many think I am just plain nuts (or both)?<br/>\n<br/>\n-High Lady Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\nGuildmistress, Hearts of Valor<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heartsofvalor.com\">http://www.heartsofvalor.com</a> (temporarily down, will be up soon)<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit Swiftarrow&#39;s Song at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freespeech.org/karisma\">http://www.freespeech.org/karisma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
