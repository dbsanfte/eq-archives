(And<br/>\nre-writing tips I have gotten from others - credit where credit is due -<br/>\nJohn Kim and Harmoinc and others.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tThe rumor is they are linked to your charisma.  Boost it when you<br/>\nplan to use these.  Both are Target songs - you need to mouse click or<br/>\notherwise (F8) designate a target.  Many times, you see multi mobs so close<br/>\nthey are hard to distinguish from each other.  If your tanks are good and<br/>\nassisting, you can look for the un-damaged mob and work on him.  But at<br/>\ntimes, it&#39;s mouse click hell.  Once you get one, and you need to switch to<br/>\nanother, move back a bit so the first one will come towards you and separate<br/>\nfrom the melee.  He will be lots easier to find for the 2nd round of control<br/>\n(mezzing prolly.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tCharm will make a _very_ short term pet (compared to other classes<br/>\ncharmed pets). You can give it the standard pet commands: /pet attack, /pet<br/>\nback off, /pet guard me, /pet guard here, /pet sit down, and more.  Make<br/>\nsome hot keys because you will be hard pressed to type the commands before<br/>\nthe charm wears off.  Charm is a useful solo tool if you have 2 mobs of<br/>\nroughly equal strength (and not too resistant to your charm) - you can make<br/>\nthem fight each other.  Party members can&#39;t damage charmed mobs (but they<br/>\ncan waste all of their mana trying - so coordinate.) When the charm wears<br/>\noff, the mob attacks you.  You can only have 1 pet at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.\tPixie will mezmerize the target. Also, fairly short term (compared<br/>\nto the enchanter spell.)  Pixie is good for party crowd control.  If your<br/>\ntanks are well behaved and smart enough to assist each other (attack the<br/>\nsame mob), you can keep the 1, 2, or maybe 3 &quot;extra&quot; mobs who are trying to<br/>\njoin the melee busy (mezzed) while the tanks fight only one active mob.  If<br/>\nyour tanks are mavericks and switch from mob to mob and attack a mezzed mob<br/>\n- it will wake up and fight. When the mez wears off, the mob attacks you.<br/>\nYou can mez as many as you can target and sing to - although 2 is pretty<br/>\nstandard, 3 is very good and do-able, I am sure John Kim and Harmonic can do<br/>\nmore but that&#39;s uber-bard class clicking and twisting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn the past week or so, John Kim posted a detailed analysis - check<br/>\nthe archives.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI might as well mention the 3rd crowd control tool:<br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tLullaby - this is the Area Effect crowd control song.  It makes mobs<br/>\nwho do not resist nod their heads and as long as they are not attacked and<br/>\ndon&#39;t resist, they are effectively out of the fight.  It seem to interrupt<br/>\ncasters quite well.  Drawbacks are: AE can spill over and agro mobs that<br/>\nwere not in your melee to begin with.  Mobs can resist and do snap in and<br/>\nout taking a nip or two now and then.  A train runs thru your AE and you get<br/>\na free ride - to zone if you can make it!  Lullaby is good for a large crowd<br/>\nof low resisters - the target control songs are better choices for bigger<br/>\nmobs in more dangerous places.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 30th song (less than half a bub to go!)<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tBard [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, October 06, 1999 6:47 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Mesmerize vs. Charm<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Bard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOkay, I give up...  what&#39;s the difference between Song of<br/>\nthe Sirens and<br/>\n\t\tPixie Chase?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-=B=-<br/>\n\t\tFeelin&#39; stoopit<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t??
