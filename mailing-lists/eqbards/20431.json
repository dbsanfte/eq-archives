Never been there.  I&#39;ll check it out though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy big question now is what songs to use when.  I discovered at 11 I could<br/>\nsolo better twisting only hymn & warsong w/o instruments as opposed to<br/>\nhymn/warsong/CoD w/o instruments (weapons beat instruments hands down at<br/>\n11).  This is probably due to dropping songs while twisting 3 in less than<br/>\nperfect conditions.  Knowing this I&#39;ve got to really focus on the two most<br/>\neffective songs and what to throw in as a third if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy big plan for 12 while soloing is still hymn & warsong.  I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nBellow beats CoD (especially with weapons) so I&#39;ll through that in as a<br/>\nthird song.  Or should I focus more on offense and sing warsong & bellow and<br/>\noccasionally hymn?<br/>\n<br/>\nGrouping really depends on the group & whether we&#39;re likely to be fighting<br/>\nsingles or multiples.  But here&#39;s what I did at 11.  Any suggestions for 12?<br/>\n<br/>\nHymn - during battle if no healer, between battles irregardless<br/>\nCoB - if caster heavy group and I&#39;m not tanking<br/>\nwarsong - if caster heavy group and I am tanking<br/>\nanthem - melee heavy group<br/>\nCoD - in battle & with hymn if additional mobs show up and start picking on<br/>\na caster, or when pulling to get a mobs attention faster, or in battle if<br/>\nI&#39;ve switched to my lute to heal someone<br/>\nJig - between battles when you get a caster that swears it&#39;s affecting mana<br/>\nand you&#39;re too tired to argue.  Usually I&#39;ve got Lament in that spot anyway.<br/>\nI rarely use either.<br/>\nE Rhythms - in place of CoB in caster heavy groups where I&#39;m not tanking, in<br/>\nplace of hymn otherwise.  CoB/Hymn would still be that third song I&#39;d try to<br/>\nfit in if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now where should Bellow be used?  And do you see anything drastically<br/>\nwrong with what I&#39;ve been doing?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, twink of twelve tunes, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
