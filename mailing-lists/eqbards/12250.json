So training at level 18 should<br/>\nhave started you with a skill of 18 instead of 11. Granted that an extra 7<br/>\nskill points is no comparison to 35 but those 7 that you get are more<br/>\nimportant, I think. I have always trained my skills to 21 when I had the<br/>\nextra points. The skills seem to take off faster from 20 than they do from<br/>\n10.<br/>\n\tI think the reason we got brass at level 11 is because the current song for<br/>\nlevel 11 isn&#39;t the original. For the life of me I can&#39;t remember what the<br/>\nold one back in Beta4 was but I think it might have been a brass song.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Valharick@...\">Valharick@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Valharick@...\">Valharick@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 29, 1999 10:36 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Bard Song Analysis Spreadsheet Available<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Valharick@...\">Valharick@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/29/99 5:05:45 PM Pacific Standard Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I just hit lvl 11 and got my brass skill.
