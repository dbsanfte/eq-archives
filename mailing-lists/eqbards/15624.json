Step 1<br/>\n&gt;would be empowering the GMs to actually do things based on the<br/>\n&gt;info they have available in these grey areas, instead of<br/>\n&gt;parroting &quot;I&#39;m sorry, there&#39;s nothing I can do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heh, only in part to cover having written a big treatise based on something<br/>\nyou didn&#39;t imply :o) I want to add to it a bit.<br/>\nThe problem with enforcement of game laws by actual humans is several-fold,<br/>\nto start, nobody (currently defined as OSI and Verant and I am sure this is<br/>\ntrue for AC as well ) can afford to have their support staffed by mature,<br/>\nresponsible people trained in conflict mediation and resolution, because<br/>\nsaid folks (with or without the training) largely need to earn a living<br/>\nwage. So they end up hiring people who think the job is cool enough to<br/>\naccept a low salary. And while I am sure the two populations (mature,<br/>\nresponsible/accepts cool over money) have some intersect, I don&#39;t believe it<br/>\nis going to be a huge pool to draw from.<br/>\nThe &quot;cool&quot; aspect is another problem, how &quot;cool&quot; is a job if no one knows<br/>\nyou or sees you doing it? This leads to GM/player fraternization, which<br/>\nleads to the *perception* of favoritism whether favoritism exists or not.<br/>\nEven if you ignore the worst excesses *cough*UO&#39;s Smurf/GM sex<br/>\nscandal*cough* you still are going to have major problems when staff is<br/>\nmaking judgement calls that favor one player over another. People will<br/>\nfairly want due process. How&#39;s THAT for overhead costs?<br/>\nThis is in part why I was only a Smurf during a time I wasn&#39;t, er,<br/>\nagitating, and why I never accepted creating story through &quot;official<br/>\nchannels&quot;, the stuff I was doing was volatile enough that all perceptions of<br/>\nfavoritism had to be avoided.<br/>\nSo, as much as I despise sharing a zone with jerks, as much as I really<br/>\ntruly, in my heart of hearts just want everyone to have high quality fun, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see a way to regulate social behavior except the sum average of<br/>\ncollective agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz/Tengu</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
