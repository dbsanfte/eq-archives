I know lots of bards that swear by chain-kiting but I think<br/>\nits a waste of time.  If your brass skill is decent you won&#39;t have any<br/>\nproblem keeping a high blue mob feared... sure it will take some time to<br/>\nkill but its actaully faster than chain-kiting.  If you find you spend most<br/>\nof your time with groups though, don&#39;t worry about this too much even.  I<br/>\nwould focus more on the charm/mes method of crowd control more - its very<br/>\nuseful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGear wise, you should go for the DE mask.  Mostly because Lower Guk Assasin<br/>\nroom is kickass exp in the 30s.  The Lambent quests should be all VERY easy<br/>\nfor you to do yourself with a group.  You just have to convince them that<br/>\ngoing to West Karana is FUN.<br/>\n<br/>\nTani, 58th Bardette<br/>\nHalana, 60th Shaman<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Katye and Brandon [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:landmax13@...\">landmax13@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, December 30, 2001 4:18 PM<br/>\nTo: Bard List<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Next question, what to pursue?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, just got out of 30 hell.. bound in FV, been hunting in OT with <br/>\ngroups.  Training up my brass (excellent, finally) on the docks at night <br/>\nwhen finished adventuring....<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I am a pretty kicking battle bard in a group.  Fighting and twisting <br/>\nIm good at , have been gifted some good gear, armor and weapons ... good <br/>\nenough at least.  Have been gifted MM drums, SS boots and Gauntlet....  so <br/>\nI do just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, am weak on crowd control (no cha gear yet) and kiting.  Very weak on <br/>\nkiting...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I need to train kiting and will be doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nGear wise, I&#39;m thinking about starting to try for lambent stuff.  Read a <br/>\nguide about being a low level and sneaking around and asking for no drops <br/>\nfrom high levels to get the gear, and considering that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel a high priority for me is a dark elf mask as well.  Has good cha <br/>\n(13) and dark elf should not be KOS with guards in OT...<br/>\n<br/>\ndon&#39;t have good instruments other than drums.  Have a minotaur horn for <br/>\nwind, but no special lutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions, itemwise?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nRaub Zaumbie<br/>\n31st lvl songster<br/>\nE.
