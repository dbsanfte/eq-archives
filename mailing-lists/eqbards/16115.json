If you do, I&#39;ll tell you why<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bah, I am a kill stealer extraordinaire!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in fear with friends the other night, I showed up late, they were in<br/>\nthe middle of a pull so I wasn&#39;t grouped right away.  My group of me, myself<br/>\nand I got the experience on the spider even though all the other 20 people<br/>\nhitting it were in groups. I joined a group the next fight, that group got<br/>\nthe first experience they had gotten all night.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I didn&#39;t stop there, just to prove that all should fear the bard, I<br/>\nswitched groups, where, *gasp* experience flowed like milk and honey.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch gloating ensued until I saw:<br/>\n<br/>\nCazic Thule says, ANTHEM!<br/>\n<br/>\nOuch!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd nope it wasn&#39;t the awesome damage of the planes weapons that work this<br/>\nmagic. That particular night I was using a Short Sword of Ykesha and an<br/>\nObsidian Shard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, you might consider this to be one of those rare situations I&#39;m not<br/>\nsupposed to bring up so I will ask you this, if not for the bard, who is<br/>\nsupposed to entertain the group? Who is supposed to guarantee a good time<br/>\nfor all those along on the journey? Who is supposed to be the one to dance<br/>\nwith the phoboplasm in hopes of coaxing the elusive imbrued bracer from its<br/>\ngrasp (try /dance, /rude, etc with a phobo next time you fight it, you&#39;ll<br/>\nsee what I mean)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs bards, we are the best equipped to handle those duties for the group and<br/>\nno other class will ever be able to do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I sit down and think about it some more I&#39;m sure I can come up with other<br/>\nreasons. Unfortunately I&#39;m too mind numb from helping a cleric with one of<br/>\ntheir stare-at-the-dirt-waiting-for-an-uberrare-spawn-and-call-it-a-quest<br/>\nthings to be able to think too straight at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 50 bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. - I&#39;m not really a kill stealer, while the events described above or<br/>\ntrue, and while I did gloat about killstealing from those I was with, it was<br/>\nall in jest. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
