I saw a hermit in<br/>\na house in South Karanas, but the door was locked. I thought maybe if I<br/>\ncould get someone to open it for me, I could finish the quest. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought. I may try it this weekend, and see what happend. I most<br/>\ncertainly am not ready for it, if the reqard is a level 30 song, I am<br/>\njust about level 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, by the way, I ahve been making the Freeport to Qeynos trip<br/>\nfrequently since level 7. I made the trip from Qeynos to South Karana<br/>\nat level 6, I think. Travelling is fun.
