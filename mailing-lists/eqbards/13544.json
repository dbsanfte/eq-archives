Travel","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-260192578\">Well, having spent this past weekend living in the new plane, I just<br/>\nthought I&#39;d share some of my experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plane is divided into 10 islands.  Travel from island to island is<br/>\ndone by either levitating (if you&#39;re coming from a sufficiently high<br/>\nisland) or through teleport devices.  The devices are all locked however,<br/>\nand you need to get keys to get from island to island.  Other people have<br/>\ncovered the quests available in the plane, and this is mainly to give you<br/>\nan idea of what to expect combat-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsland 1<br/>\nSurprisingly enough, the island you start at is lowest in elevation, so no<br/>\nfloating to other islands from here.  The island consists of 6 fairies, 1<br/>\nfairy princess, and a key master.  The key master sells two keys, the &quot;key<br/>\nof swords&quot;, which costs 420 plat, is the route my post covers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, in case you don&#39;t want to dish out 420 plat per person<br/>\ngoing through, you can kill the fairies on the island, each of which drop<br/>\n3 swords and 3 feet (the 3 feet are to obtain the other key).  After<br/>\nkilling all the fairies (or as many as to get the number of keys you<br/>\nneed), you need to kill the fairy princess (red cons to a level 50).  Upon<br/>\ndoing so, a halfing appears.  Do not hail him, doing so makes him poof.<br/>\nHave everyone who had a sword from a fairy hand it to the halfing, and<br/>\nthey will receive a key of swords.  Use this key on the proper portal to<br/>\nbe transported to:<br/>\n<br/>\nIsland 2<br/>\nThis island contains Noble Dojorn, as well as creatures called<br/>\nbladestorms.  From here on out, the creatures have as many hit points and<br/>\nhit just as hard (or harder) as your run-of-the-mill dragon (thankfully<br/>\nminus the AE fear and damage).  None of this needs to be killed to reach<br/>\nisland 3 though, just levitate while sow&#39;d or speed song across a small<br/>\ndistance to (we&#39;ll come back to island 2 in a minute):<br/>\n<br/>\nIsland 3<br/>\nIsland 3 is larger than the previous islands, with many different types of<br/>\ncreatures.  Watchful Guards (evil eye looking things), and A Gust of Wind<br/>\n(air elementals) are among the 6 or 7 creature types on this island.  Each<br/>\ncreature drops an animal figuring along with whatever else might be found,<br/>\nand each member of your party should get one of those, should they desire<br/>\nto go further.  Killing the &quot;boss creature&quot; on the island, the Gorgalask<br/>\n(sp?), causes the halfing to spawn again.  Turning in the figurine&#39;s<br/>\n(again, don&#39;t hail him) will net you a &quot;key of beasts&quot; which will take you<br/>\nto Island 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow back to what I skipped about Island 2.  Noble Dojorn is the first of 3<br/>\n&quot;bosses&quot; for the plane.  He hits for over 300 and casts the same AE rain<br/>\nspell that bladestorm does (3 ticks of 270+ damage).  As far as I could<br/>\ntell, casters were more or less unable to hit him.  Bargash was present<br/>\nfor our slaying of Noble Dojorn, after which he chuckled and said &quot;The<br/>\noverseer will dominate you.&quot; which takes us to:<br/>\n<br/>\nIsland 4<br/>\nThere are two creatures besides Mr. Overseer on this island.  Essence<br/>\nHarvesters and Soul Carriers.  Here is the breakdown on how the island<br/>\nworks:<br/>\n<br/>\nEssence Harvestors - Yellow, Indifferent con Pegasus. <br/>\n<br/>\nSoul Harvestors - Red, Scowls con Pegasus that pop 2 at a time when an<br/>\nEssence Harvestor is killed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSoul Tamers - Red, Scowls con Pegasus that pop 1 at a time when you kill a<br/>\nSoul Harvestor. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSoul Carriers - Yellow, Indifferent con Griffons. <br/>\n<br/>\nEssence Carriers - Red, Scowls con Griffons that spawn 2 at a time when<br/>\nyou kill a Soul Carrier. <br/>\n<br/>\nEssence Tamers - Red, Scowls con Griffons that spawn 1 at a time when you<br/>\nkill an Essence Carrier. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis means you pull 1 level 52 creature, kill it, cause 2 almost dragon<br/>\ndifficulty creatures to spawn, and those, in turn, when killed, cause yet<br/>\nanother dragon difficulty creature to spawn.  5 for 1, nice eh? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does the Overseer dominate?  750 melee damage, 750 AE....  No, those<br/>\nare not typos.  We decided not to try him just yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything hits for 350-ish,  after this, I feel like I could clear<br/>\nFreeport of Merchants. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
