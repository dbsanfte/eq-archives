My wife started her first character, a warrior, when I<br/>\nstarted my bard and my brother-in-law started his third character, a<br/>\nPaladin, all at the same time.

Missing a note and dropping<br/>\n&gt; one of the MR<br/>\n&gt; &gt; songs can be to devistating to risk that possibility.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tMy usualy strategy for this, is to make those 2 the most important.<br/>\n&gt; In other words, I&#39;ll try and do 3 songs, but if I miss a note on anthem,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll skip it and restart 1st MR song, then 2nd MR song, then try Anthem<br/>\n&gt; again.  Or if I miss a note of 2nd MR song, restart 2nd MR song,<br/>\n&gt; go back to<br/>\n&gt; 1st MR song and repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I used to try this, but in my parties, which are usually tank heavy, so much<br/>\nis flying by in the chat window that I&#39;m already at information overload.<br/>\nMaybe I should turn on some of those filters...  Nah, I can&#39;t stand to miss<br/>\nsomething :-).
