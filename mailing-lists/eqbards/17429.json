If you mean Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain, then I feel I have to inform you<br/>\nthat this is a voice only song and no instrument will affect it&#39;s<br/>\nperformance.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrategy wise, let the warrior do the tanking and the taunting, let the<br/>\nenchanter do crowd control and stuns vs casters, let the Shaman do the<br/>\nhealing during battle, you should handle after battle healing and let the<br/>\nnecro dish out the damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour main role will be meleeing with the warrior and the pet. I would twist<br/>\nPsalm, anthem amd guardian vs melee mobs subbing in chains at the end of the<br/>\nfights. I would chain sing pixie vs wizzies. Vs shamans I&#39;d mix pixie with<br/>\nanthem and sometimes psalm. Screech is a last ditch attempt at getting some<br/>\nmobs off your back when you have to flee. Generally with an enchanter you<br/>\nwon&#39;t really need to charm, however on big pulls it can be really helpful to<br/>\nsave mana for everyone by letting the mob do the work for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour party has a fairly wide level range which could be a liability for you.<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest doing the predator / foreman area for a bit, then move on to the<br/>\nsinge room ( the room with 3 doors and a secret wall. we usually call it the<br/>\nsinge room even though singe doesn&#39;t spawn here) After the singe room if the<br/>\nshaman hasn&#39;t caught up a bit, try camping the efreeti / captain or maybe<br/>\nthe bar, but the bar can get out of hand quickly. Once you are averaging<br/>\nlevel 30, I&#39;d head over to the high shaman or the king. The king crack can<br/>\nbe very tough, especially on a low level healer, so be careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Elijah Meeker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 06, 2000 2:20 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] More Grouping with an Enchanter advice wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know we recently talked about it but I am having trouble figuring out an<br/>\nexact  strategy at 27.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarrior, 25<br/>\nShaman, 21<br/>\nNecro, 27<br/>\nOccasional Druid,Mid-thirties<br/>\nEnchanter, 29<br/>\nBard, 27<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can probably guess, our group is put together based on a all being<br/>\nfriends and not on any strategy (I do plan to get the shaman caught up a<br/>\nbit).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trouble I am having is what to do play given the Enchanter and that,<br/>\ngiven the mix, I should probably be using weapons.  We have been hunting<br/>\nHill Giants but are moving into Sol A and so the rules are going to change a<br/>\nbit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem is voice, but of course the Enchanter can do the speed buffs.<br/>\nDDD, CoD and psalm of warmth are weak with voice<br/>\nChains is weak using voice, and again, the Enchanter can cover that<br/>\nHymn is unfortunatly too weak without the lute to get the mob off the<br/>\nEnchanter if she debuffs however, so we are thinking of me singing Chains.<br/>\nI can practice charming, which might be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut basicly I have been singing weak DoTs, weak damage sheild and weak Hymn<br/>\nto taunt off the Enchanter and feeling like I am being less than optimal at<br/>\nmy job. Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a positive note, pulling Flame Goblin Wizards while playing<br/>\nElemental/Guardian  with the Mistmoore Drum ROCKS, however I have had to<br/>\nstop making chains my &quot;tag&quot; song, by the time he shows up I have switched to<br/>\nweapons and the other night he droped me from one bubble down to dead with<br/>\nno time for a screen refresh...PA_BOOM!
