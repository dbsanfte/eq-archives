Clouding worked without a<br/>\nhitch for me.  Not only against the mobs around the lake, but the trains<br/>\nfrom inside the castle.  We were around the tower from the entrance.  I<br/>\nwould con the mobs that came walking back from the zone, granted I didn&#39;t<br/>\ncon every mob, but all those I did were indifferent.  Sounds like the<br/>\nwandering buffer is the more likely explanation or somehow the Camo was<br/>\noverriding the Clouding&#39;s protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin Loreweaver<br/>\nBard of the 23rd Song<br/>\nMith Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.

When I was in my mid-to-upper 20&#39;s - I<br/>\ncould sing it and get from the zone to the Graveyard completely unmolested.<br/>\nThe Initiates and what have you that spawn along the way would never be a<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Starting a couple weeks ago - they would go agro on me when singing<br/>\nClouding and when Regular (not Superior) Camouflage is cast on me.  This is<br/>\na major train generator.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It seems to me they upgraded these mobs see invis.  Someone I grouped<br/>\nwith theorized that some wandering mob casts see invis on them - but who<br/>\nknows?<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde 35 of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
