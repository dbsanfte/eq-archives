It seems we bards have become\r<br/>\nthe &quot;pony express&quot; of norrath.  Kelethin, Freeport, HighHold Keep,\r<br/>\nand Qeynos have become the mail stops. There may be more but those were\r<br/>\nthe only ones I undertook last night. There did seem to be trouble with\r<br/>\nthe Feeport mail stop.  I believe there are also two new quests in \r<br/>\nQeynos but I could be mistaken and merely never triggered them before.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAdon singer of the Glories of Veeshan \r<br/>\nBard of Povar\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 30 Jun 1999 04:34:20 -0400 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> wrote:\r<br/>\n&gt; From: Jessica Hankins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polyhymnia@...\">polyhymnia@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; I was inside HighHold Keep, and there&#39;s a new bard out front, a female in\r<br/>\n&gt; leather.
