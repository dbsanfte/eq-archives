This is basically what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nDay 1: Cleared Fairies and Azaracks, camped on Gorgalask<br/>\n<br/>\nDay 2: Cleared Gorgalask and Pegasus, camped on Pegasus<br/>\n<br/>\nDay 3: Recleared Pegasus, realized it was already 11PM, did some poking<br/>\naround on Spirocs and jumped off, leaving a necro and cleric on pegasus<br/>\n<br/>\nSome spoilers for how we handled pegasus/griffons below, as well as some<br/>\nbasic info on spirocs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf Griffons and Pegasus, Griffons are noticibly easier.  Both of them<br/>\nsplit into two sub 55 red cons&#39;s (tested w/ Bard Charm) which, when<br/>\nkilled, each spawn another &gt; 55 cons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe method we use to kill them is fairly simple.  1 group consisting of 2<br/>\nwarriors, 2 clerics, and 2 enchanters, and 4 melee/cleric groups, with<br/>\npure casters not really helping except with pets.  That 1 group is known<br/>\nas the &quot;mez group&quot;.  We kill the first one, and when it splits into 2,<br/>\neveryone attacks the same target except for the mez group.  The 2 warriors<br/>\nfrom the mez group attack the other target, tanking it while the clerics<br/>\nheal and the enchanters chain cast rune 3.  The bards keep trying to charm<br/>\nthe first split to give the mez group 18 second breathers.  Meanwhile,<br/>\neveryone else kills the other one and the subsequent triggered spawn.<br/>\nFinally, everyone kills the remaining spawn that the mez group has been<br/>\ntanking the whole time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeper of Souls (the boss) is on par with Innoruuk in difficulty, so not<br/>\ntoo bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpirocs.  All I will say about spirocs is you don&#39;t have to combat drop<br/>\nin.  It&#39;s perfectly safe to run around most of the island.  The agro range<br/>\non the spirocs is like 0.1 ft, with the exception of The Spiroc Guardian<br/>\nand The Spiroc Lord.  Despite them consing scowls, they don&#39;t generally<br/>\nattack unless you run right up to a roost.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got a ton of drops, just nothing for clerics or bards :(.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
