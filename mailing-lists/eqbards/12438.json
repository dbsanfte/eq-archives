You will be lucky to even get twisting in.<br/>\n     With my P3-450, 128MB, TNT2 Ultra machine with<br/>\nall options<br/>\n     off... detail, pc names, effects, my misses, your<br/>\nmisses,<br/>\n     your hits, all spell, all song, I still got<br/>\nlagged something<br/>\n     horrible.  It&#39;s the location server trying to<br/>\nupdate 30 people<br/>\n     in a very tight area, nothing you can do about<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) You will get more attention than you wanted,<br/>\nstarting and stopping<br/>\n     a song draws attention, an adhorrent thought so<br/>\nas it tripled me<br/>\n     for 135.  Cazic Thule thought so when I twisted<br/>\nand he clobbered<br/>\n     me in the 170s.  That said, oh well, you gotta<br/>\ntwist, so twist<br/>\n     the right stuff ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;buncha stuff snipped&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bust your ass so we can fight together at full power<br/>\n(L50) again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
