I have a personal policy I stick<br/>\nto, if you start telling me how to play my bard then I am leaving.  I left<br/>\nboth groups and never looked back.  I am a damn good bard that doesn&#39;t need<br/>\nto be told what to do.  Grrrrr.  I actually had a rogue in my group the<br/>\nother night that told the casters to shut up for me.  lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Steve<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Well, it finally happened to me.  I haven&#39;t played in a lot of pickup<br/>\n&gt;groups, but have done a bit.  And until now, I&#39;ve not heard this phrase<br/>\n&gt;uttered.  I thought I had escaped it.  But noooooooooo... the pickup group I<br/>\n&gt;got last night was the WORST I&#39;ve had in EQ that I can remember.<br/>\n&gt;.........edit......<br/>\n&gt;The wizard &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing manasong?&quot;... me... &quot;uh, I am&quot;...<br/>\n&gt;her...&quot;well just play it all the time&quot;.... me ... &quot;nope&quot;... her... &quot;well you<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t a very good bard are you?&quot;... me... &quot;nope&quot;<br/>\n&gt;.........edit......<br/>\n&gt;Ok so I was a little sarcastic, but I wont even get into the pulling<br/>\n&gt;techniques used by the ranger... Needless to say, I took the advice of<br/>\n&gt;someone here and with a &quot;OMG I think my roommate just dropped something bad<br/>\n&gt;.. heard a crash have to go check it out&quot;.. I logged... but wowowowow...<br/>\n&gt;what an experience. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
