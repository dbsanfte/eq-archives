Well, last night hallmarked my first planes run _ever_ on a live server!  Hehe no big deal but it was to me.  I haven&#39;t done a planes run in months and it was really nice to do one again.  Especially since I deleted my bard on Test during the incredible Pwipe fiasco.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to Hate with my guild last night (Isengard on Saryrn server) and within 1 hour I scored both the 6 note blade and Evensong off the Maestro of Rancor.  I had to log out shortly thereafter without seeing a single piece of Imbrued drop but hey, I was happy nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nCiao!<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\nBard of Norrath<br/>\n(who is VERY happy to be planes ready once again)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
