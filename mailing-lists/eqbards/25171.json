On the other hand,<br/>\nthe newbies didn&#39;t play for two nights before they figured out that the the reason everyone else was so<br/>\nmuch faster was the &quot;run&quot; button.  Nor did they wander into Nek forest thinking how cool it was that there<br/>\nwere Guards to protect them, only to spend the next 3 hours retrieving corpses.  Nor did they spend hours<br/>\nof time on boats importing derv rings to GFay (1pp apiece).  Nor were they ecstatic to buy their first<br/>\npiece of Banded at level 18 (15pp for a bracer, thanks price fixing).  Nor did they train Smithing to 125<br/>\nbefore cntl-click (you had to move the slider down to pick one thing off a stack).  And the list goes on.<br/>\nI did rather lazily level my Warrior to 38 in 12 days, with no help but twinked equipment, and my Druid to<br/>\n24 in 3.5 days, ditto, so a lot of it is equipment, knowledge, and better hunting areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 59 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; hehehehe well thats really not so bad.
