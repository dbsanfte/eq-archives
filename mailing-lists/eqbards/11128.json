Use<br/>\nit with a drum for extra resists, use it with a horn for extra<br/>\nbuffs, use it with a lute for extra healing.  The lower level<br/>\nsongs would only confer one effect, while the higher level<br/>\nones would combine more and more effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou lose out on the flexibility of the current system, but the<br/>\nconstant button mashing (CBM?) is verging on ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;ll dig up my copy of Bard&#39;s Tale...<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
