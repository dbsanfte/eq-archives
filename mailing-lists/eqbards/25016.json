Three without losing any effects, sometimes four with one effect<br/>\ndropping for a few seconds<br/>\n2. It works best if you hotkey every song you want to play, and instead<br/>\nof looking at them to see if you can click song number 2 yet, just let<br/>\nyourself fall into the rythm of it.<br/>\n3. For battle it&#39;s anthem, chords and hymn; sometimes subsituting in<br/>\nelemental rhythms if I don&#39;t need healing or dot. Solo battle I usually<br/>\ntwist anthem, warsong, and hymn, dropping hymn for a pulse of chords<br/>\nonce in a while. Out of battle I&#39;d rather not be twisting, my fingers<br/>\nneed a rest and I like to chat, so I&#39;ll just leave hymn going. When<br/>\ntravelling I just put in the drum and play selo&#39;s, maybe twisting it<br/>\nwith one of the buff songs for some extra str when I&#39;m encumbered.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At 01:59 PM 6/12/2001 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.
