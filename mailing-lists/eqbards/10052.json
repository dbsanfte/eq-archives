I never gave<br/>\n   away crafted armor when it was the hot thing to make.  I always<br/>\n   made said person at least pay my cost, and even then I wouldnt<br/>\n   sell it to anyone below level 15.  There&#39;s no way a level 10<br/>\n   should be carrying several hundred plat around to purchase this<br/>\n   kind of armor anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I may reward a bard I know with some Lambent, but they are mostly<br/>\n   level 30+.  There really arent enough bards out there to drive<br/>\n   the price of lambent up, so I would expect to pay the cost of<br/>\n   jewels, maybe 25pp for the stone, and add 25-50 % markup for the<br/>\n   effort to acquire nodrops.  These items arent worth much more than<br/>\n   that.  And it&#39;s not like the guy is gonna say: Fine, I&#39;ll just<br/>\n   find another bard who wants it.  Bard armor and items in general<br/>\n   dont unload that easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I would assume Verant wanted you to start getting lambent armor<br/>\n   around level 30 - 35.  Some places even a full group of level 35s<br/>\n   cannot do.  At level 40, me and one level 40 druid got all the items<br/>\n   we needed on our own, including the gypsy lute.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I feel your pain, lower level bards.  You get bronze now at such<br/>\n   an early age and so cheap, after wearing it for 5 - 10 levels you<br/>\n   desparately want an upgrade path and there is none.  Such is the<br/>\n   price you pay for being given cheap mid level items.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\n   there.  And there&#39;s nothing like earning your own stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Harmonic.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
