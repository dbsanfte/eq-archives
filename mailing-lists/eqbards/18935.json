I <br/>\nmentioned to my wiz that I heard on this list some people mentioned <br/>\n5k-6k and others even 1.5-2.

I <br/>\njust wish them luck in selling it and try not to LMAO to them <br/>\ndirectly. :)  I was lucky to receive boots from a guildmember as a <br/>\ngift (I feel so twinked! :) but I would not pay 5k for either gaunts <br/>\nor boots.  There aren&#39;t THAT many Bards out there to keep the price <br/>\nthat high, even if some are naive enough to pay it.  I&#39;d pay 1.5 - <br/>\n2k, maybe as high as 2.5k if I go long enough without (or I&#39;m <br/>\nplanning a trip to Kedge).  Otherwise, I&#39;ll wait until I can get them <br/>\nmyself, or am able to loot some Imbrued.  (I finally have a large <br/>\nenough buffer in 47 to tempt me to Hate next trip I am invited on :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I sold my Lambent Boots for 400 pp.  I would think 5 X that <br/>\nprice is reasonable for the Singing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
