I know that<br/>\n&gt; a Mino Axe is a good 1h-slashing weapon, however I don&#39;t feel it fits in<br/>\n&gt; with my &quot;bardic attitude&quot; if you understand my meaning. Its a massive,<br/>\n&gt; slow, big axe thing from a minotaur, and I&#39;m a bard who likes to travel,<br/>\n&gt; sing his songs and bring mirth. I was using a bronze long sword, now<br/>\n&gt; switched to a plain old Axe (smaller and quicker than a mino), So I ask<br/>\n&gt; you all Whats a good weapon that is not imposing like a mino axe for a<br/>\n&gt; level 8 bard, or even for any level bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Luini<br/>\n&gt; Innoruk<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 4:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Soerbaird and Verant not effective threads<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Could these horses be any deader???<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Come on guys, this mailing list is for the discussion of things<br/>\n&gt; relating to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bards.
