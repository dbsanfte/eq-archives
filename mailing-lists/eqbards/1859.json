Sucker bets.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo maximize your dual wield skill, and to take fullest advantage of combat<br/>\nsongs, use weapons of 30 delay or lower.  Sure, it looks impressive to hit<br/>\nfor 20 with a bastard sword or mino axe when you only hit for 14-16 with<br/>\nanother weapon.  But it&#39;s as much as a full second and a half slower per<br/>\nswing than the weapons I listed above..and they all have about the same<br/>\nefficiency, give or take a few decimals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever weapons have similar efficiency but there&#39;s a wide variance in the<br/>\ndelay factor, you&#39;re best served to opt for the faster weapon.  Quick and<br/>\ndirty way to determine weapon efficiency is to divide the Damage by the<br/>\nDelay.  That number you can use to compare with other weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince dual wield checks to see if it goes off every swing cycle, more speed<br/>\nmeans more chances to dual wield, netting a HUGE increase in damage over<br/>\ntime by using a faster weapon.

I have used many of the 1H<br/>\n&gt;slashing weapons and have become very fond of my 2 combined longswords.<br/>\n&gt;I was using the Mino Axe combo, but noticed that even though I did more<br/>\n&gt;damage per hit,  I missed ALOT more than with my Combines. My question<br/>\n&gt;is this: Until I get some of the higher level 1H slashing MAGIC weapons<br/>\n&gt;(i.e. Demon Claw, Crys swords, etc.) I have been looking high and low<br/>\n&gt;for the Combined Bastard sword.<br/>\n&gt;    I was informed at one time that it was only sold at the gypsy camp<br/>\n&gt;in Lavastorm MTNS, but I made a trip there today and they did not exists<br/>\n&gt;there. (the swords, not the camp). I have also visited the gypsy camp in<br/>\n&gt;Oasis and in one of the Karanas. Does anyone know of any other gypsy<br/>\n&gt;camps, or more specifically, the gypsy camp that sells the Combined<br/>\n&gt;Bastard sword?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galaline<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to &quot;INDIE-GRRL,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
