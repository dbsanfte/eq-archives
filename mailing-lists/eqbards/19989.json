Several people from one of the higher level guilds on Saryrn were<br/>\ntalking about it tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t heard if this happens if they buff/heal people fighting.  If you can<br/>\nbuff/heal safely then bards, clerics, shaman won&#39;t be much affected since<br/>\ntheir primary roles are heals/buffs/resists rather than raw combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I wonder if the coding they have that prevents spells from<br/>\n&gt; working on higher<br/>\n&gt; level mobs was somehow used here.  Just a thought, but it would be nice of<br/>\n&gt; them if a weaker dragon simply dodged everything a 53+ player<br/>\n&gt; swung/cast/throw at them.  Kinda takes away from role-playing if you can<br/>\n&gt; kill a tougher dragon, but get death touched by a weaker one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But there I go again using the R-P word.  I might get banned for this if I<br/>\n&gt; keep it up.  ;^)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Peace<br/>\n&gt; Evulia, twinked out and still stalled at 11, Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm, I wonder exactly what this means?  Will they banish the higher<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels?  Port them away?  Maybe kind of like a DT?  I don&#39;t think I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quite understand this, well, we&#39;ll see what happens when someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tries it... heh.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~Beatdrop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
