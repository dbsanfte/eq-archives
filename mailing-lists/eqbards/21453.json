All those fast spawning<br/>\nkunark dungeons we are supposed to due are now going to be much harder, as<br/>\neither the groups will be killing things slower or spending more mana to<br/>\nkill things at the same pace.  Either way total combat time (battle +<br/>\nrecovery) will be longer as more mana will be spent (more mana for haste or<br/>\nmore mana for healing/damage spells).  The PvE balance is about to get a<br/>\nhuge push, to the detrement of the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Katy Westerman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katy-w@...\">katy-w@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 19, 2000 6:59 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Prepare for another nerf... =8^P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *snip haste stacking bug being fixed*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not a poke at you specifically, Olgwinn, just an observation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was reading the Concert Hall board last night.  Why are people so<br/>\n&gt; upset about this being fixed?  It has historically been referred to as<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find it.  Well,<br/>\n&gt; its been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work that way and<br/>\n&gt; everyone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask them to fix<br/>\n&gt; bugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* bug!&quot;  A bug<br/>\n&gt; is a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of<br/>\n&gt; our overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.
