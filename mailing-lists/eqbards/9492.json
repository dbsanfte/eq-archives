Most all of the good NPC&#39;s were killed and I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt;anyone got rewarded except for those who got to loot the undead and<br/>\n&gt;dark elves (read greedy high level bastards).  The high levels weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;all bad, though, some would leave the loot if they couldn&#39;t use it and<br/>\n&gt;broadcast to the zone where it was...so some greedy high level<br/>\n&gt;(who probably couldn&#39;t use it) would come and pick it up.  Bitter?<br/>\n&gt;Nah.  Actually I only died once in the whole thing, when I was blinded<br/>\n&gt;by Innoruk&#39;s hate.  Friend of mine died at least 3 times and lost exp<br/>\n&gt;everytime.  My guess for the portal is Kithicor or Nektulos forest.  I<br/>\n&gt;doubt they&#39;d put a portal in a town, even if it is Neriak.  I just<br/>\n&gt;wish I had something to show for my 3 hours of running around the<br/>\n&gt;continent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Robynn Merrilin, still 24th, E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Katy Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\n&gt;CS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject lol.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
