I wondered what happened to you! I have been on this list for at<br/>\nleast a year, but I try not to bore folks unless I have something to<br/>\ncontribute. There&#39;s a couple bards from Xegony here: Slyde and Darkfoxx come<br/>\nto mind first, but I apologize to the others I can&#39;t call to mind instantly.<br/>\nEvercrack is a disease, we were moving and not playing for abouut a month<br/>\nand we were itching to get back. I may never finish getting rooms painted<br/>\nwith Velious out!<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of Velious, we went last night, visited or toured about 7 zones<br/>\ntotal. Reminded me why I love being a bard! Outdoor exploration! We were<br/>\ngrouped but outdoors ended up going off in different directions, so I made<br/>\nthe fast runs around the zones walls to look for connections to other zones.<br/>\nWe&#39;d already been to the Coldain city and found mostly lots of folks wanting<br/>\na rez. Our cleric was longsuffering but rez&#39;ing everyone that asked. We only<br/>\nkilled things that attacked us first since faction is unknown and that was<br/>\nall mostly green stuff. I bought the 34th song from the gnome pirate camp, I<br/>\nonly saw it and no other songs for sale there, along with all the other<br/>\nclass spells. So far, I like the new interface options, the higher<br/>\nresolution options, and my machine wasn&#39;t as bogged as I feared it would be<br/>\n(400 Celeron).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t already, check the Concert Hall boards, a new lute was found<br/>\nthat gives Illusion Howler.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
