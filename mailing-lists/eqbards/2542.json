Think of Loc as the incredibly generous minor god of geology who answers<br/>\nall prayers to him (/loc) by giving the person in question their<br/>\nco-ordinates (which he used when drawing up the blueprints for Norrath)<br/>\nNow, can we get away from nit-picking personal prefernces in gaming-styles<br/>\nand back to more bard-ish stuff?<br/>\n3. A truly hardcore RP&#39;r would quit the game and never play again once he<br/>\ndied (or, if he really liked the game and believed re-incarnation were<br/>\npossible on Norrath, would never inform anyone -even friends- of his new<br/>\ncharacter&#39;s identity.)<br/>\nLike maybe...  &quot;What is the benefit/loss (if any) in the various instrument<br/>\ntypes?  (ie: Lute vs Mandolin)?&quot;  (Still waiting on an answer to that one)<br/>\nAlso, I looked over the bard site that was mentioned in an earlier letter,<br/>\nand I must say I found the site quite informative.
