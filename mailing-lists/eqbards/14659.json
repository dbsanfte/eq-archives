I saw the &quot;mob glances<br/>\naround nervously&quot; message every time we fought something.

The message on screen that popped up numerous times during the<br/>\n&gt; fight<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was the &quot;scintillating colors&quot; message.  I&#39;ve always assumed this was<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; message enchanters get when they successfully stun.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Believe me, he was using tashan(i)(a).  If you run across an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter who doesn&#39;t, boot him from your group.  :)  It has a<br/>\n&gt; ridiculously short cast time, is almost never resisted, and<br/>\n&gt; costs next to no mana.  In return, it debuffs MR by about<br/>\n&gt; 20-45 points.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
