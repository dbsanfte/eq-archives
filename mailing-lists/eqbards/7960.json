This was a nerf, and it <br/>\nis a nerf that Verant has demonstrated is not necessary (since they have the <br/>\nability to ask for player consent).  Incidentally, the term &quot;malicious&quot; binding <br/>\noverdramatizes (and underestimates) the problem.  The problem for me has alway been <br/>\nkindly but unasked for binding.  Casters repeatedly make the assumption that I must <br/>\nwant to be bound to the city that they consider &quot;closest&quot; to where the group is <br/>\nheaded, and will often bind me without asking.  Yes, if I was in a steady group, I <br/>\ncould work this out.  Some of us are not so lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for all of the contributors to this list who have insisted that Verant will <br/>\nnever change their policy, rendering this discussion moot, I suggest that you take <br/>\nsome basic business courses.  Verant offers a consumer product with a large variety <br/>\nof options; if their customer base really dislikes one of the options, VERANT WILL <br/>\nCHANGE IT.  They would be idiots not to!  And, as consumers, we would be idiots not <br/>\nto complain when we see something we dislike.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree of my four characters are my Bard and two pure melee characters.  I do not <br/>\npick characters on the basis of the Bind spell, I happen to like melee characters <br/>\nenough to play them anyway.  But I still think the way that Bind currently works is <br/>\nboth unfair and logically insupportable, and it should be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 27 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
