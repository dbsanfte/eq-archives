I wish I had known about it sooner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am Telania, prior 15th lvl bard lady.::pouts::  I died shortly after hitting my new mark in HighPass.. (them dumb Orcs).  I was thinking of heading to Unrest with my RL hubby who is a 14th lvl WE Warrior.  But after reading about Unrest I dont&#39; think we&#39;re ready.  Sounds like we need to mature just a tad bit more.. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nANYWAY, now that i&#39;ve side tracked.. where is a good spot for my lvl to be?  I&#39;ve taken other suggestions like one, <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;go to kerra isle! Good loot and easy&quot;. uh, They like forgot to mention Trains.  Died quiet harshly I might add. eh<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I will ask my brethen..
