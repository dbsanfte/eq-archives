I had a verifiable bug windows box to send in and they<br/>\nwalked me step by step thru what I could have done via hacking the program<br/>\nfile to cause the game to page fault.  When I pointed out that even I had<br/>\nbeen stupid enough to do that they could easily tell from the register<br/>\nvalues and ban me.  They said that&#39;d be too late I&#39;d have already been<br/>\nrez&#39;d.  What the heck difference would it make to be rez&#39;d only to be banned<br/>\na few days later?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso their comments to you were pure bunk.  They (Verant GM&#39;s and guides)<br/>\nare very aware that a corpse can fall into a wall in one part of a zone and<br/>\nappear out the other side somewhere else entirely.  This is really bad in<br/>\nAk&#39;Annon.  I had a friend who died from the falling bug where you tried to<br/>\nget out of the water and fail, falling to your death.  I could see her<br/>\ncorpse under the water near the mines of malfunction where she died.  I had<br/>\nit targeted while she looted it... at the zone point into Steamfont where it<br/>\nwas sticking thru the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Illian [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 06, 1999 12:43 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a similar experience when my wife&#39;s character died from a 131hp fall<br/>\nnear Blackburrow in Everfrost after zoning out of Permafrost (and if you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know, that is across the zone).  I got into with the Guides and the<br/>\nPrexus GM for days after they refused to ressurect her and I too was<br/>\nbasically &quot;accused&quot; of dragging the corpse in an indirect way.  Of course,<br/>\nin the process it sounds like one of my mistakes was actually succeeding in<br/>\nfinding her corpse with my bard while waiting for our petition to go<br/>\nthrough, although had I not found it, I don&#39;t think it would have made a<br/>\ndifference.  Here are some excerpts from some e-mails from Cailleach, the<br/>\nPrexus GM, regarding the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Greetings!  GM Cailleach here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In regard to your wife&#39;s character&#39;s death, please let me explain the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resurrection<br/>\n&gt; &gt; policies. The reason I&#39;m doing this is so that you will see the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; restrictions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guides are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; under and hopefully, why they are under them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Resurrections are provided only for deaths where it can be verified by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; guide, with the tools available to them, that the death was due<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to a bug.  In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; refusing to perform a resurrection, they are not calling anyone a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; liar, but they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are indicating to you that they must be able to verify the bug<br/>\n&gt; &gt; objectively,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without resorting to anyone&#39;s word on it.  If they were to rely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solely on ANY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; player&#39;s word, it would be a very short step from there to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing favorites<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with players, or just APPEARING to do so.  This is a very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difficult situation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to recover from, as you can guess.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In order to prevent even the appearance of favoritism, Verant built the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; policies and procedures for guides so that they would have to be able to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; determine by the location of the corpse, the appearance of the corpse,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; some other completely objective method to confirm the existence of a bug<br/>\n&gt; &gt; causing the death, they have to refuse.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any situation reported by one player against another is also this way.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; have to personally witness the situation, OR have a report (created by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the player, using the /report &lt;playername&gt; command) that we know is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not subject to tampering, so that we can take action. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personally encourage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; players to send me a /tell when they have an emergency that requires one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of us to come and witness something.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In this situation, what I would have preferred to have the guide do is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; find the corpse, let you know where it was located, make sure it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; invisible to you, and maybe explaining the procedures a bit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better.  I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imagine why the corpse was warped so far away unless that is the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>so-called<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &quot;safe point&quot; of that zone, though I don&#39;t believe it is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>AND Another<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Of course it upsets you, Jeff, but remember that we have to have objective<br/>\n&gt; verification.  Now, keeping that in mind, think about this from the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>guide&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; point of view.  Their first observation is the corpse in its final<br/>\n </span></blockquote>location.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They<br/>\n&gt; were not present to see where the character had been prior to the death,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nor<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is there any mechanism by which they can check that.  All they see is a<br/>\n&gt; corpse in a location OTHER than the safe point (which they know very well<br/>\n&gt; because it is where they &quot;zone into&quot; an area), which gives NO indication<br/>\n&gt; whatsoever as to how the death occurred.  SO, what they would have to do<br/>\n&gt; is to accept your word for it which they are PROHIBITED from doing, not<br/>\n&gt; because you would lie to them, but because if they believe you, an honest<br/>\n&gt; player,  and DON&#39;T believe a known scammer, in a situation where there<br/>\n&gt; is no objective proof one way or another, the known scammer-type has<br/>\n&gt; a legitimate case for claiming favoritism.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but it&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please keep in mind that the guides don&#39;t have the benefit of having made<br/>\n&gt; all the observations you made by being there and therefore their<br/>\n </span></blockquote>conclusions<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; aren&#39;t going to be the same as yours without allowing for the scenario<br/>\n&gt; above.  I&#39;m very sorry, because I do understand about having precious<br/>\n&gt; little time to actually enjoy the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cailleach<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Taneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 30th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kimes, Dean W.
