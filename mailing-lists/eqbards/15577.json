The line is from<br/>\nHamlet and is uttered by Hamlet&#39;s mother Gertrude.  It is actually &quot;The lady<br/>\ndoth protest too much, methinks.&quot; with &quot;too much&quot; implying that the<br/>\nprotester isn&#39;t being truthful.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, the remark wasn&#39;t a slam to EverQuest bards and was actually used in<br/>\npoor context.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn EQ you might use the remark when someone powerloots an item and then<br/>\nscreams to the zone for thirty minutes that he&#39;s innocent.  &quot;Methinks he<br/>\ndoth protest too much.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[47 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just read on the EQVault main page Brad&#39;s recent post on the official<br/>\n&gt; Gameplay forum.  He talks mainly about the lifespan of EQ.  At<br/>\n&gt; the very end<br/>\n&gt; of the post is the following comment:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (I didn&#39;t realize that until someone here pointed out to me, that we<br/>\n&gt; complain the most about things we care about. Many here have since denied<br/>\n&gt; it, but I think &quot;They doth protest too much&quot; to paraphrase &quot;THE BARD&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; Agreed.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks very much for your comments.<br/>\n&gt; -Brad<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t had the time to read the Gameplay forum to get the full<br/>\n&gt; context of<br/>\n&gt; the thread but the way I interpret it someone posted that bards<br/>\n&gt; protest too<br/>\n&gt; much and that Brad agreed.  Am I misinterpreting this or has our class now<br/>\n&gt; gained the reputation at Verant as a whining class?  If the<br/>\n&gt; original poster<br/>\n&gt; was referring to John Kim&#39;s post concerning lullaby I don&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; how that can<br/>\n&gt; be interpreted as a protest.<br/>\n&gt; Of course, the quote &quot;Thou doth protest too much&quot; could be a reference to<br/>\n&gt; William Shakespeare, which my Alabama high school education did<br/>\n&gt; not give me<br/>\n&gt; too much exposure to:-)<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
