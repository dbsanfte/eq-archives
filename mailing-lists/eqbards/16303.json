We were at the other dragon on the Innoruuk server.<br/>\nWow, was yesterday one really messed up day :).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe buff up for Vox and run in, 20 seconds into the fight, 80% of<br/>\nour healers get bugged by her fear or went LD.  That&#39;s right -&gt; 80% &lt;-.  I<br/>\ngot fear bugged with 90% mana along with 3 or 4 others and a few went LD.<br/>\nWe had 3 functioning healers that entire battle.  Well, we still got Lady<br/>\nVox down to a sliver before our damage output dropped to nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA little CR, pause for a snack.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOur second run we only had 2 healers get bugged (which is about<br/>\nthe average and we had 2 casualties total.  That&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed<br/>\nto happen :P.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHarmonic came along as a guest this trip, so he got to see both<br/>\nthe guild at its worst and best :).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tActually, Vox was very similar in items.  Nag&#39;s CoF -&gt; Vox&#39;s RBB.<br/>\nNag&#39;s scale -&gt; Vox&#39;s scale.  2 GPK&#39;s -&gt; 2 weight reducing pouches....<br/>\nerr... Nevermind :).<br/>\n<br/>\n\tVox just got really lucky with her fear bugging the healers, I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever seen so many people get fear bugged in so short a period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana<br/>\nLegions of Darkness<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
