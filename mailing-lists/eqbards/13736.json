If you are pulling casters you don&#39;t have<br/>\nthe luxury of hanging around since their [any mob&#39;s] rules for casting don&#39;t<br/>\nfollow normal PC rules (range at start of cast, los, range at end of cast,<br/>\netc).  Secondly, in most situations the puller&#39;s job is already dangerous<br/>\n(or tedious - pulling is work in as much as twisting is work for us bards).<br/>\nOf the good pulling classes (rangers, monks come to mind initially you could<br/>\nargue for SK&#39;s with feign or a cleric with DA to break a really nasty<br/>\nspawn), none have the ability to deliver a high damage strike.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now on to a little tid bit that might make it a little easier for some<br/>\npeople to get their helms:  The paladin quest mob the netmaster (ugly little<br/>\ngoblin) spawns in LR and walks around the lake.  His placeholder is often an<br/>\naqua gob shaman, but occasionally is a warrior dw gob.  I don&#39;t know the<br/>\nspawn point of these guys, but I do know they all &quot;collect&quot; in the cove in<br/>\nLR went walking around.  The geometry of the zone is kinda funky back there<br/>\nand you have a thin strip of land that is actually in the zone, but the art<br/>\nlooks like it extends back maybe 20-30 more feet before a cliff face is met.<br/>\nAnyhow, they come walking up and around the shore line and will always enter<br/>\nthis cove.  Spawn time is long, maybe 2 hours or so but if you&#39;re hunting in<br/>\nSK or doing giants in RM its probably worth your time to check every so<br/>\noften.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Date: Wed, 26 Jan 2000 01:12:37 -060<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Jeff Illian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeff@...\">jeff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: Deepwater Gobs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Simply a perfect case of the puller not pissing off the mob enough.
