When I<br/>\ngot there, a 50th level wizard was in the castle camping the gypsies so he<br/>\ncould farm battle drums for his friends.  I asked him if I could purchase a<br/>\ngypsy lute from him if one got dropped.  He said I could have it for free<br/>\nassuming I got there before it decayed.  I started up the invis song and<br/>\nmade my way to the piano room.  I would have to say that was the most scared<br/>\nI have ever been in my whole EQ life.  No one was camping the courtyard so<br/>\nas I made my way to the castle I walked past numerous ancilles, deathly<br/>\nushers, gargoyles etc.  There must have been at least 20 mobs from the<br/>\ngraveyard gate and castle gate.  Fortunately, my invis song stayed up the<br/>\nentire time.  Made my way where the wizard was sitting and started waiting.<br/>\nI ended up sitting there for over an hour watching the wizard take out<br/>\nnumerous gypsies and other mobs.  To my misfortune, not once did a gypsy<br/>\ndrop a lute.  While fighting a werewolf, a wandering mob joined in and the<br/>\nwiz had to gate out.  He then decided to go somewhere else.  I made my way<br/>\nback down to safety.  I wasted an hour I could have been doing something<br/>\nelse but it was still fun due to the risk involved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n29 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
