Some people have spent time or money, or traded valuable items<br/>\naway to get their current Guise.  It would be completely unfair to take this<br/>\nitem away from them.  Remember the Box of Abu Kar (sp?).....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What they should have (and should do still) is<br/>\n&gt; put in a Bar/Trl/Ogr item that has unlimited charges of shrink...something<br/>\n </span></blockquote>like<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Moggok&#39;s bracer of not being a big fata**&quot; or some such nonsense.  The<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guise<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; was intended to be Brd/Rog only.  They should also put in an ultravision<br/>\n </span></blockquote>item<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for da hummies.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These are all good ideas for replacement items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, i also think that if the Manastone is &quot;too Powerful&quot; it should be<br/>\n&gt; removed entirely (maybe turn it into a diamond so that the people who<br/>\n </span></blockquote>camped<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for it get some ROI)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, do you take something away from someone who may have invested much<br/>\ntime and effort into getting?  I&#39;d say only if it was game inbalancing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While i&#39;m at it...JBoots should have to be worn to be used IMSO.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Leaving the old items on the people that already had it stratifies the EQ<br/>\n&gt; population...Punishing those who did not start early, or were not lucky<br/>\n </span></blockquote>enough<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to acquire the items before they were removed.  In the case of the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Manastone,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it makes casters (specifically clerics and druids) that have them better<br/>\n </span></blockquote>than<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; those that don&#39;t, and with the manastone gone, the casters that don&#39;t have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; will always be &quot;inferior&quot; to those that do.

There is no perfect solution.  Verant now believes (as I do)<br/>\nthat items should not be taken from players who already have earned them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
