Beside the fact that Clerics skill is inherently (sp?) low, <br/>\nsomething like 3 or 4 points per level toward blunt skills, which is <br/>\ncomparable to a caster, I have personally meleed a cleric in a duel and <br/>\nfound it laughable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI walked up to Nektulos zone in E Commons to find a Dark Elf Cleric <br/>\nharrassing a friend of mine. He was 20th level as was I, my friend was 16th <br/>\nlevel. He kept challenging her to a duel, but she wouldn&#39;t accept so I <br/>\ndueled him for her. He smited me down to 2 bubbles of hp before he was oom, <br/>\nafter which i proceeded to rape him in melee (he was full health at the time <br/>\nhe went oom). He zoned out almost dead; I still had 2 bubbles hp. I was not <br/>\ntwinked either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad, Follower of Quellious<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 47th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
