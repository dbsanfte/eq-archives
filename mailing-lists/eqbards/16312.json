Most of you probably noticed the network glitches last<br/>\nnight.  Well, guess when they happened for us?  We finally<br/>\nmanaged to break into fear on our third try without everyone<br/>\ngetting killed at zone-in.  We&#39;d looted most of our equipment<br/>\nand were forming groups.  The monk brings in the mobs he&#39;s led<br/>\naway, so all we have to do is kill these 3 shiverbacks and<br/>\nscareling and the enchanter already has the scareling mezed,<br/>\nand...<br/>\n<br/>\n40% of the group goes LD.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, at least we managed to break in on our fourth<br/>\nattempt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; \tActually, Vox was very similar in items.
