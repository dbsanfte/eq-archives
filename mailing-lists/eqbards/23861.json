It is fairly common for my<br/>\ncleric to play himself and me (bard) when I go to bed early on weeknights.<br/>\nThis is after we&#39;ve gotten to the room we&#39;re going to work out of and things<br/>\nare reasonably routine. Macros are probably the single best reason we can<br/>\npull this off with as much success as we do. I have song macros setup and so<br/>\nwe&#39;ll load my account on the extra pc that is closer to him so that both his<br/>\nkeyboard and that one&#39;s are right there close and he doesn&#39;t have to reach<br/>\nacross the room. He uses me to melee or mana battery as the situation<br/>\ndemands. We&#39;ve had a friend with the same situation play his enchanter and<br/>\nrobo his mage. Typically we do this a)because we can&#39;t find the class we<br/>\nneed for a particular area, b)we&#39;re gotten in somewhere deep, gotten setup,<br/>\nandnow it&#39;s time for me to go to bed (weeknights) and they want to stay for<br/>\nanother hour or 2. Not enough time to get a replacement in whereever and<br/>\nthat&#39;s always got some risk involved as well. Our groupmates know what&#39;s<br/>\ngoing on and the group has input into whether it&#39;s ok or whether the place<br/>\nwe&#39;re in is too dangerous.<br/>\nWhen we play 3 characters between us, its the 55 cleric for buffs and heals,<br/>\nthe 38 necro, and the 35 wiz. The necro and wiz are in the same group with<br/>\nour friends similar level characters and the cleric just is there to save<br/>\nall our butts. He plays the nec: put on dots and get the pet on the mob and<br/>\nI play the wiz. Both these chars need med time so we rarely feel pushed,<br/>\nespecially since one friend&#39;s twink is an enchanter. The wizard typically<br/>\nhas to wait til the mob is down by 1/3 to 1/2 life before casting, (unless<br/>\nI&#39;m fm and using stuns) so that&#39;s time to get the nec&#39;s dots on and pet<br/>\nengaged. I will say I find wizarding a tad boring after being a bard and<br/>\nhaving tons of options. With 2 characters in the group we both watch<br/>\neveryone&#39;s hp and either of us can reach the cleric pc to launch a heal.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been owning areas in Kaesora this way; that is a great place for exp<br/>\nin the 30s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas in Hate recently, Maestro dropped Evensong and hand for warrior quest,<br/>\nno lute again! I&#39;m cursed! No Imbrued dropped all day either. My 1H Blunt is<br/>\nnow 18; other bard said he had an Evensong already.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
