I&#39;m sorry if my appology about my english is bothering<br/>\n&gt; you but I said that because I mean it. The fact is that I got a few mails<br/>\n&gt; about my language and they weren&#39;t very pleasent to read. If you think my<br/>\n&gt; english is good enough then I can say just one thing. Thanks god at least<br/>\n&gt; one. Beleive me this is the first mail in which my english is mentioned as<br/>\n&gt; something good. So I&#39;ll never write that appology about my language again.<br/>\n&gt; I hope I didn&#39;t iritate you to much, If I did then I&#39;m sorry I just wanted<br/>\n&gt; to help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Janko<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 24 Aug 1999, Jamie wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jamie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bribed@...\">bribed@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does it ever bother anyone else that people who say, &quot;Sorry if you<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand, English isn&#39;t my first language,&quot; often speak more<br/>\ncoherently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than about 70 -80% of the people whose first language it is?
