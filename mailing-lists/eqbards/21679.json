Also was always in a group so we just pulled them out of the<br/>\ncells.  I assume what you were doing was opening the doors, targetting one<br/>\nof the mobs, closing the doors, and then chanting until the mob died.<br/>\nCurious what happens when the first chant hits.  If it is a caster mob, does<br/>\nit cast through the door?  Melee mobs?  What about the mobs in the other<br/>\ncells that you didn&#39;t target?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 05, 2000 9:57 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>; &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Mistmoore Jail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they&#39;ve been nerfed since.
