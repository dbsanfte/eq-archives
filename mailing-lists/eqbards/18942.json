I logged on last night and had two different guildmates send <br/>\nme tells saying they had some Singing Steel boots for me if I still <br/>\nneeded them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never join a guild for the sole reason of getting nice items <br/>\nfor free.  I have nothing against people helping other people out, <br/>\nbut I believe there&#39;s a lot to be said for being able to acquire my <br/>\nequipment by my own means.  Singing Steel Boots aside (which I <br/>\nmentioned I received as a gift), the only other item I have which I <br/>\ndid not a) loot, b) buy, or c) trade for myself is an EB BP and I <br/>\nfeel I&#39;ve been pretty well equipped throughout the life of my Bard.  <br/>\nWhen I received the BP as a wedding present, I was capable of gaining <br/>\nit myself by a), b) or c).<br/>\n<br/>\nI see my guild more as a means to help me get to the places to <br/>\nacquire equipment rather than a guild that will take all of the work <br/>\nout of it.  I don&#39;t mind twinking (my level 10 Shaman has almost full <br/>\nTotemic), but I still take some pride in having acquired that <br/>\nequipment myself in another character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen and heard of far too many guilds, for my taste, where <br/>\npeople join for the sole purpose of getting twinked.  Level 10 <br/>\ncharacters join and demand &quot;phat lewt&quot; or they threaten to quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m more of a &quot;loner&quot; or maybe, even tho I have given away many <br/>\nitems to people, I don&#39;t want to feel obligated to reciprocate every <br/>\ntime I get something of value on my own.  But, whichever reason, I&#39;d <br/>\ndefinitely prefer to purchase, trade, or loot the Singing Steel <br/>\nGaunts on my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
