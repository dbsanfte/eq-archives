I wish you played on my server we need more<br/>\npeople like you on this server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider my self one of the lucky ones... Since cazic thule (i am 40th now<br/>\nSTILL)  I got a regular (i mean 99% of the time regular) group Me 40th bard<br/>\n40th enchanter 45 (he passed us the looser hehe) Pure barb warrior 40 shaman<br/>\nwe work SO well togeather now that 2 and even sometimes 3 red to me at 40th<br/>\nmobs (so at least 43rd levle) mobs can be dropped with NO zoning or dieing.<br/>\nShaman and chanter med constandly.. shaman usually hits one dot then heals<br/>\nand meds chanter stun is LOW LOW mana and he mez charm meds what ever needs<br/>\nto be done.. We work so well togeather it almost makes me feel guilty for<br/>\nthe exp we are getting from red mobs because it is so easy..<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the occasion  I play earlier than them and need to find another group<br/>\n(till they get on) I out of habbit am yelling commands... NORMALLY  ill send<br/>\nBIG hints like if I see a cleric standing up and we have been fighting for a<br/>\nwhile ill ask  clerics name &quot; whats your mana status... umm 40%.. im ok med<br/>\nmed med&quot; :) or HEAL so and so..<br/>\netc... sometimes this will agrovate some groups but as you all know.. I am a<br/>\nbard I CAN be picky about my groups...<br/>\n<br/>\neven at 40th I feel I am pretty well known for being a BARD not a pure tank<br/>\nor a pure mana singer.. I get tells constantly to group even when I have<br/>\nbeen in zone for hours already :)   Since I left my current guild I get NO<br/>\nLESS than 4 or 5 guild invites a day during prime time....<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen I have 2 or more tanks in group my weapons go in a bag... and out comes<br/>\nlute drum etc depending on situation....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would add my 2 cents of total agreement ... and have had<br/>\nsimilar experiences as you :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldar 40th bard<br/>\nNuldar 40th Necromancer(if I remember back the 4 months since I have played<br/>\nhim)<br/>\nTarew Marr.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, December 15, 1999 11:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Song Taunting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  So, the other day in SolB - the usual bat/bug group formed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Made 48th as I predicted, but I found that I was controlling<br/>\n&gt;  the group more so than I have ever before.  And well, some<br/>\n&gt;  L50 people decided to be &#39;back seat bards&#39; - which I promptly<br/>\n&gt;  disbanded them.  Had to tell the shamans to stop piercing the<br/>\n&gt;  bats for 5 and 6 dmg, and sit their pretty arses on the floor<br/>\n&gt;  to med.  Had to get the cleric on the floor a few times too.<br/>\n&gt;  Had to plan spell attacks, since the shaman was trying to<br/>\n&gt;  malaise the bat and poison it, before drowsying it.  Just<br/>\n&gt;  little things like that tend to make me wonder how these<br/>\n&gt;  people made L45+.  I mean if you wanted to swing a sword<br/>\n&gt;  or pierce with a spear, you shoulda decided that 40+ levels<br/>\n&gt;  ago.  If medding is boring, or you wanna raise your X skill<br/>\n&gt;  then I politely ask that those people either cease or leave.<br/>\n&gt;  Sounds strict, but when you have people&#39;s lives in danger,<br/>\n&gt;  and monsters that can hit in the 100s, I&#39;d like the cleric<br/>\n&gt;  to be medding for heals rather than bashing something with<br/>\n&gt;  a hammer and doing &lt; 10 dmg, mostly wiffing.  Then you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;  got these clerics that must nuke no matter what, &lt;rolls eyes&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;  Wasn&#39;t a good night, like the one before, to say the least.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Some idiot wanted me to twist manasong in battle, when we only<br/>\n&gt;  had one caster and no snarer.  heh.  Chains alone basically is<br/>\n&gt;  a job in itself on these LDCs and lava beetles.  The same idiot<br/>\n&gt;  got fussy cause I wasn&#39;t playing the &#39;healsong&#39; for him during<br/>\n&gt;  multiple mob pulls.  (Without an enchanter, I become a shotgun<br/>\n&gt;  pixie striker - and that is in fact a full time job)  Making<br/>\n&gt;  two lava beetles disappear from battle with pixie strike is<br/>\n&gt;  a huge challenge.  But this dude kept ranting about how I should<br/>\n&gt;  be healing him at 6 or 7 hp per tick, heh.  So he takes a hit<br/>\n&gt;  for 102 and I heal back 7 of that - whooptiedoo! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The next pull, I agree to show him what happens when I just<br/>\n&gt;  &#39;speed him up and heal him&#39; as he put it.  2 sonic bats, and<br/>\n&gt;  1 lava beetle show up.  I start berserk, no problems.  They<br/>\n&gt;  stick on the tanks.  I twist healsong, and instantly I am<br/>\n&gt;  swarmed...  down two bubbles in less than 3 seconds.  Already<br/>\n&gt;  proven my point, then begin to attempt to recover this f&#39;up<br/>\n&gt;  with pixie, the guy is asking where the speed and heal are.<br/>\n&gt;  After all the things were killed, I located the hotkey bank<br/>\n&gt;  with my Disband button and clicked it for him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  o Manasong seems to have very low taunt if any at all.<br/>\n&gt;  o Berserk may or may not get the attention of creatures,<br/>\n&gt;    it seems to depend on how close I am to the unconfronted<br/>\n&gt;    mobs.<br/>\n&gt;  o Hymm is absolute instant aggression.<br/>\n&gt;  o I would imagine Binding, and other AE songs like Lullaby<br/>\n&gt;    would create a fair amount of aggression too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
