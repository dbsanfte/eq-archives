It IS like playing a totally new <br/>\n&gt; game now and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was finally able to twist 4 songs.  :)  But one of the <br/>\n&gt; changes I noticed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with this PC is for the worse.  Actually two changes are, <br/>\n&gt; but I think I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;live with the fact that everywhere I go I hear women screaming, bears<br/>\n&gt; &gt;roaring, wisps whizzing, etc.  I guess that&#39;s supposed to <br/>\n&gt; make you feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like you&#39;re in a zone full of dead bodies and monsters.  Bit <br/>\n&gt; nerve racking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;though, and I can no longer track by ear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But anyway, that&#39;s the problem I can learn to live with.  <br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s killing me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now is, I THINK, lag.   See, lag spikes on my old PC <br/>\n&gt; basically just made<br/>\n&gt; &gt;movements slow and choppy.  What&#39;s happening now is my <br/>\n&gt; screen completely<br/>\n&gt; &gt;locks up for about 20 seconds, during that time I&#39;ll hear <br/>\n&gt; about 5 seconds<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of the me piercing something repeatedly, followed by 5ish <br/>\n&gt; seconds of me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;screaming in agony repeatedly, followed by 5 seconds of the mob<br/>\n&gt; &gt;barking/growling/etc, and so on.  It&#39;s like the client is <br/>\n&gt; playing all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sound effects of the battle in order of effect rather than <br/>\n&gt; chronological.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And I can do NOTHING while this is going on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I tried going back to all my old PCs settings (no particles, <br/>\n&gt; about a 15&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;clip plane, most chatting off, etc) but if it helped any, it <br/>\n&gt; only made<br/>\n&gt; &gt;these lag spikes less frequent.  It didn&#39;t make them any <br/>\n&gt; more manageable.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Oh and I&#39;m calling these lag spikes for lack of a better explanation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Since the screen stops updating for such a long time I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; know what the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;status bar would be showing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyone have any insight on this?  Is this what lag is <br/>\n&gt; &quot;supposed&quot; to look<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My new PC is a 1GHz P3, with 128 RAM & 64 video RAM.  (Nice <br/>\n&gt; toy, eh?  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thought so &lt;g&gt;) Old PC, if I recall correctly, was a 200Mhz <br/>\n&gt; P2, with 64 RAM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;& 32 video RAM.
