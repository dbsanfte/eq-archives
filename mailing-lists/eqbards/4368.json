On Rallos Zek we<br/>\ncan&#39;t stop steal killers using this method.  You can still inflict damage on<br/>\ncharmed mobs, ince it is at that time considered someone&#39;s pet.  I once<br/>\ntried to teach a group of lv 20 steal killers a lesson by charming the mobs<br/>\nthey were attacking (they stole kill from my girlfriend&#39;s character earlier<br/>\nthat day).  Needless to say I was laughed at.  On the up side, you CAN charm<br/>\na PK(or fear them for that matter) and have your level 50 wizard friends zap<br/>\nthe hell out of a player they could otherwise not hit since they have a<br/>\nlinkdead &quot;flag&quot; set upon becoming charmed or feared.  Now THERE&#39;s some bard<br/>\nrevenge for you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
