From an<br/>\nindividual standpoint, since the difficulty of the mobs in<br/>\nHate and Fear are roughly the same, you end up getting much<br/>\nfewer drops in Hate than in Fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way, Hate has the ability to support a lot more<br/>\npeople than Fear.  But since it&#39;s not camped like LGuk or<br/>\nSolB, we&#39;re nowhere near saturating it.  Unfortunately, the<br/>\ndrops are tuned assuming saturation.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
