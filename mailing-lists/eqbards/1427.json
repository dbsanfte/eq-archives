They suffer penalties to AC and skills<br/>\nwhen they weigh too much.  It does not apply to any other class, as long as<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t fatigued or encumbered.  At that point, stats drop, which does<br/>\naffect your dodge chances.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, STR helps your damage dealing, and hit potential, as well as<br/>\nload bearing.  Very heavily weighted stat for any melee class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTA is not worth boosting.  The hitpoint increase you can obtain by maxing<br/>\nyour stam out as a bard is horrible, around 1 hp per level.  That&#39;s only 50<br/>\nextra at 50th level, or about a quarter hit from the mobs you fight then.<br/>\nNot worth it.  The problem with getting fatigued in combat is easily worked<br/>\naround.  Use lighter weapons.  Any weapon with a weight of 5.0 or less will<br/>\ndo the trick.  Use things like barbed whips or well balanced scimitars, you<br/>\nwill stam out rapidly.  Using items like Jambiyas, Demon Claws, Rapiers,<br/>\netc, you end the same fight with over half stamina.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgi helps avoid hits, obviously, and adds to the damage reduction side of<br/>\nyour AC as well as being a factor in your dodge chances, and helps Safe Fall<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nDex helps you hit more often.  For non bards, it also helps parry, block,<br/>\nand riposte skills some.  For &#39;real&#39; casters, it can increase resumed<br/>\ncasting chances, combined with Channeling.  It has NO effect on &#39;twisting&#39;.<br/>\nNone.  Nada. Zilch.  ANY bash will stop your song, period, there is no way<br/>\naround it.  Normal hits do not.  Missed notes are entirely due to your skill<br/>\nin the instrument the song is based on, and singing.  With 135 item boosted<br/>\nDex, I miss notes as often as I do with my base 95.  But I hit a lot more<br/>\noften, so it&#39;s a good stat.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest I can figure, after 40 odd levels of barding, is that Charisma is a<br/>\nvery very mild stat for anything other than shopping.  Even wearing a<br/>\ngrotesque mask (-9 CHA) and skunk sprayed, dropping my CHA down to 52, my<br/>\nresist rate is still insignificant.  Boosting it up to 140 via a Shaman&#39;s<br/>\n44th level Charisma spell likewise had little effect.  It may have more<br/>\nimpact in the future as Geoffry tunes the class a bit more, and gets some<br/>\nmore coding time to do things the way they had planned, but don&#39;t hold your<br/>\nbreath.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf all the stats to drop points into, I lean on STR the most.  Max it out,<br/>\nand spend the rest on Dex and Agi, depending on race.  Intelligence, Wisdom,<br/>\nand Stamina are a waste of points.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 3:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] New Bard...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The main reason I don&#39;t advocate increasing Str is based on some Monk<br/>\n&gt;research that seems to confirm that increased weight regardless of str<br/>\n&gt;adversely affects the dodge skill to a great degree.  therefore wearing the<br/>\n&gt;best lightest armor may help you totally avoid a blow that would otherwise<br/>\n&gt;hit you for reduced damage in heavier armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: John Robertson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 1:41 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] New Bard...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;John Robertson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Well here are my thoughts...<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;         Put 10 in Dex, 5 in Int, and the rest in Agi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is an almost religious topic among bards, but in my opinion, put all<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;points you can into strength.
