(Surfing gone)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone on the E&#39;ci message board expressed a similar opinion about PoA<br/>\n&gt;being a major money sink.  The poster theorized that the following will<br/>\n&gt;start happening:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;46+ level characters generally have more money than they know what to do<br/>\n&gt;with.  Because PoA is a big money sink, this cash reserve will eventually<br/>\n&gt;get low and possibly run out.  As a result, 46+ characters will have to go<br/>\n&gt;back to lower level areas and camp high value items that they don&#39;t need in<br/>\n&gt;order to sell them for cash so they can get back into PoA.  This will have<br/>\n&gt;two likely side effects.  First, lower level characters who don&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt;high value item will have problems because they will have to compete with<br/>\n&gt;46+ level characters for the spawn point.  Second effect is that now it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>will<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;become easier to buy these items for cash.  Prior to the patch (when<br/>\n&gt;platinum was plentiful), most people would only trade a high value item for<br/>\n&gt;another high value item that they could use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;IMO, this could turn out to be an unexpected side benefit from the PoA.  A<br/>\n&gt;lot of people, myself included, are not inclined or don&#39;t have the time<br/>\n&gt;required to camp for high value items.  As a result, it was difficult for<br/>\n&gt;those type of players to obtain the item on their own or to purchase it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>from<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;someone.
