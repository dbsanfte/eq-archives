Their names<br/>\nwould show up as a different color, say yellow since that will visibly stand<br/>\nout.  Yellow tagged characters can only be used on Test during specific<br/>\ndate/times to test specified areas of the game.  They don&#39;t gain experience<br/>\nand they can&#39;t loot any items.  They don&#39;t need EXP or items because they<br/>\nare there for one reason only, to test changes made to the game.  Once the<br/>\ntest period is complete, those characters can&#39;t log in to the Test server.<br/>\nYellow tagged characters also would not be allowed to group with normal<br/>\ncharacters.  This scenario should alleviate any concerns of the regular Test<br/>\nserver players who earned there levels the regular way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; BTW about getting a character buffed to your present level on test? dont<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hold your breath...they havent done anything like that since the<br/>\n&gt; population<br/>\n&gt; &gt; explosion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The test server is for testing, if they don&#39;t understand that -<br/>\n&gt;   then I won&#39;t bother wasting my time.  It does seem that those <br/>\n&gt;   few people who play on the test server and invested time into<br/>\n&gt;   a character feel bad about importing a L50 character into it.<br/>\n&gt;   I completely understand your position, but I&#39;ve earned all my<br/>\n&gt;   levels already, there&#39;s no surprise or falsity in copying my<br/>\n&gt;   bard to test.  You kind make it sound like you&#39;ve earned your<br/>\n&gt;   levels on the test server, so everyone else would have to.  I<br/>\n&gt;   don&#39;t want to play there, I simply want to test there.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
