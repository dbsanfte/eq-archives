Since<br/>\n&gt; EQ apparently has a major problem with distinguishing <br/>\n&gt; vertical difference,<br/>\n&gt; any creature on the bottom of the ocean can attack you as <br/>\n&gt; though you were<br/>\n&gt; standing on it&#39;s head.  Very annoying, because that means <br/>\n&gt; that you can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; attack it, but it can attack you.  *ahem* Nice double standard here,<br/>\n&gt; programmers.
