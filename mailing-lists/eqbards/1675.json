I actually saw a post stating that monks should have bind<br/>\nat high levels, some idea that a high level monk was so in touch with<br/>\nhis chi that he could bind it to a spot :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBind should stay the purview of the pure casters, as should gate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen, Journeyman bard of Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
