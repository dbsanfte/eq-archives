I personally do not care about so-called<br/>\n&quot;spoilers&quot;. I would not be reading this list if I did not want info about<br/>\nthe game. The game absurdly poorly documented, making things like this list<br/>\na god send. Here I can learn things that otherwise would take me pointless<br/>\nhours of frustration that could be spent actually having fun in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally will post any and all useful information here that I think<br/>\nwill help all of you have more fun with the game. I strongly encourage<br/>\neveryone else to do the same. If you don&#39;t like &quot;spoilers&quot; (in other words<br/>\nif figuring stuff out on your own is part of the fun to you) then simply<br/>\ndon&#39;t read the material here. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo Jyzan here asks a great question, one which I would like to know the<br/>\nanswer to, since I have been looking for ore for ages. I now know I can buy<br/>\nit in Steamfont, and I am hoping there is somewhere on the mainland I can<br/>\nbuy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if someone knows the answer, don&#39;t send it privately to Jyzan, send it<br/>\nto all of us so that those of us who want to smith don&#39;t spend HOURS<br/>\nlooking for ore (which is NOT fun to me, I don&#39;t know about anyone else).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Musil<br/>\n<br/>\nRP Note: In a role-play sense it is perfectly legitimate to tell an<br/>\naspiring smith a few tricks of the trade, and where to go to purchase his<br/>\nsupplies and practice his art.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 07:55 AM 5/7/99 , you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;John Robertson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greetings all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Could someone here tell me locations to buy ore, besides the windmill in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Steamfont?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Email me privately at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnr@...\">johnr@...</a> if you think the rest of the list<br/>\n </span></blockquote>does not want to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;see this (they probably don&#39;t).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jyzan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;With more than 14 million emails exchanged monthly.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist is truly helping connect the world!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
