This<br/>\n game is as fun as you want it to be.  If you dont have fun unless you&#39;re<br/>\n &quot;safe&quot;... well... I feel for you.  If you dont have fun with anything but<br/>\n bashing NPC skulls well... I guess I feel for you too.  But you can find<br/>\n your sort of fun in EQ, same as the rest of us.  I just wish you&#39;d quit<br/>\n bitching about the rest of us getting to have OUR fun too.<br/>\n <br/>\n (generalized you there, please dont take it personally.) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwhoa! way outta left field there don&#39;t ya think? If you contstrued any of my <br/>\ncomments as &quot;bitching&quot; please don&#39;t respond to them. Bitching wasn&#39;t what i <br/>\nintended , and it isn&#39;t what i did. As far as only being safe , that isn&#39;t <br/>\nwhat I like , i was simply stating my view that exploring and hunting can be <br/>\neasier said than done. And where you dug up any of those ideas about me <br/>\nbashing skulls , or harping on your fun . I just don&#39;t have a clue. On an <br/>\nequally related note , i never asked you to feel for me , nor would i ever <br/>\nwant you to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes i did take that personally , and putting something like that at the <br/>\nend of such comments is utter bull. You had an intelligent post up until the <br/>\nend, therefore an intelligent person will know how someone will take it, <br/>\nregardless of the footnote.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUlaien yada yada yada</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
