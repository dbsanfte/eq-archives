Most of them are 18-40s resulting in players with more mental<br/>\nabilities than all of the kewldewds combined... which still isnt saying much<br/>\nnow that I think about it.  point is, playing with older players is much<br/>\nmore enjoyable from an intellectual point of view.<br/>\nPenaden Songweaver<br/>\nand proud member of the Lost Order of Akalabeth<br/>\n<br/>\nLlewrend Lynnhaven wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Llewrend Lynnhaven &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lordartos@...\">lordartos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Only 26 here, but one thing I have noticed is that<br/>\n&gt; bards genrally are more mature players and better<br/>\n&gt; role-players than most other classes.  Granted this is<br/>\n&gt; a genralization, but we are not the power gamer type<br/>\n&gt; character, we are the group type, the glue type.  I<br/>\n&gt; like that.  One reason I don&#39;t want other races to<br/>\n&gt; have bards is because I also like being rare.  In my<br/>\n&gt; guild of 40, I&#39;m one of two.  I like that :)<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your anytime, anywhere sports store.
