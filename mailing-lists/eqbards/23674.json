We had a<br/>\nchanter, cleric, wizard, paladin and yes... 2 bards.   At least 4 times the<br/>\ndamn paladin kept telling us to just sing mana during fights.  Me and the<br/>\nother bard were practically crying at the ignorance. Other bard was doing<br/>\nlev 50 haste, nivs and clarity, and i was before he starting crying, doing<br/>\nchant of battle, hymn of restoration and clarity... and yet kept hearing<br/>\nplay mana play mana.  Maybe if he let the full mana cleric/chanter stun<br/>\ninstead of him chain stunning we wouldnt of had that issue now would we.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nInsulted bard of Ayonae Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
