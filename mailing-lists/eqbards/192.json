To verify this for yourself, start running with Selo&#39;s<br/>\nAccelerando, then stop singing. Note the delay before you slow down.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo play two songs at once, or even three (which I call juggling), start a song,<br/>\nwait for the effect to kick in (look for the words describing the song or for<br/>\nthe effect icon to appear), then stop the song and start another one.  By<br/>\nskillfully starting and stopping your songs, you can have more than one &quot;active&quot;<br/>\nat a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
