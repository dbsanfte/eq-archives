It isn&#39;t that big of a deal but I&#39;m just curious<br/>\nif everyone else is experiencing the same thing.  If I&#39;m the only one<br/>\ngetting the order of messages out of whack, then my email server is most<br/>\nlikely the culprit.  If it is affecting everyone else then it probably has<br/>\nsomething to do with how Onelist forwards the messages.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a grad student working on my degree in information systems and when I<br/>\ncan&#39;t figure this kind of stuff out it bugs the crap out of me.  Thanks<br/>\nahead for anyone who can shed some light. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
