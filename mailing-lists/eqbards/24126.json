People are getting into arguments here<br/>\nabout whether songs are &quot;Completely Useless&quot;.  I think we do have a few of<br/>\nthese - (Cassandra&#39;s Ellegy).  To me &quot;Completely Useless&quot; means that - other<br/>\nthan making up a whacky hypothetical situation there is absolutely no<br/>\nserious use of the spell. - I&#39;m terming these Useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people have argued certain songs (DDD, Lyssa&#39;s Concord) are completely<br/>\nuseless - while others point out rare, occasional uses for them (Some have<br/>\nfound these songs very useful - maybe my examples aren&#39;t good here - but<br/>\nstay with me for a second).  This category of songs would be &quot;Only Very<br/>\nmarginally useful&quot;.  I&#39;m terming these Marginal,<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we also have the issue of songs that become useless as you get to<br/>\nhigher levels.  This is more problematic - because if a lower level bard<br/>\nDOES need them.  Some of these no one would argue against.  Most higher<br/>\nlevel bards get SS Gloves - so the Enduring Breath song becomes Useless.   I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think anyone would seriously argue against 16 level bards getting that<br/>\nsong.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther songs become useless at higher levels because the effect doesn&#39;t scale<br/>\nenough.  IMHO this is the problem with DDD.  Verant agreed but there<br/>\nresponse was IMHO clearly dramatically insufficient.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a fair argument about how many, say Shaman spells are no longer<br/>\nuseful - Casters get SO many more spells - they&#39;re designed to become<br/>\nobsolete when the new comes in.  Many of our songs become Marginal when<br/>\nperhaps they could be tuned better to not be so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the issue really boils down to - what percentage of our songs are<br/>\nMarginal, and should they / could they be tuned to make them less so without<br/>\nunbalancing the game...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
