It gives you 4 hit points per proc, 4 hp is a joke.  I<br/>\nusually like to throw the crystal staffs (except fire) in to this also but<br/>\nat least they have a bit better base damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even though they are junk, every once in a while I will switch to them<br/>\nif I am in a full group and we are handling everything well.  ...I just<br/>\nenjoy seeing the procs =)  Right now I am looking forward to 25 when my<br/>\nGnoll hide lariet will come out to play, by then I should have 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:10 PM 1/26/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I noticed that during the Dual Wield thread, some of you fine Bards said that<br/>\n&gt;you use a Tentacle Whip.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have one, but have never used it, due to the low damage and low proc.  <br/>\n&gt;Instead<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m using one Barbed and one Dragoon Dirk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Do you feel that the low delay makes it viable?
