Head south through the pass, perhaps stop off at a few<br/>\ndervish camps for derverision.  Head to SW corner, enter Innothule, hand<br/>\nleft, and visit lovely Guk, so beautiful this time of year.  Course, I had<br/>\nfun for a while at the bottom of Oasis lake killing aqua goblins, but you&#39;re<br/>\nprobably too high level now, as am I.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take all the advice and head west to the Karanas, well, you&#39;ll soon<br/>\nenough get bored more than likely.  If you have a few magic weapons, I&#39;d<br/>\nrecommend jaunting through Blackburrow to Everfrost Peaks.  There&#39;s<br/>\nsomething there, something very interesting.  When you find the frozen<br/>\nriver, look for a break in the ice, and get aquatic ayre ready.  Bring a few<br/>\npeople with you, and swim north, up the river (Here&#39;s where you see how<br/>\nbrave those barbarians really are!).  Eventually you&#39;ll come up to a dry<br/>\ncavern, a maze, and you should find a few Ice Boned Skeletons to slaughter.<br/>\nStack guardian and elemental when you tangle with them, and carefully<br/>\nexplore.  What an infernal place hidden under those peaks!  Be warned, I<br/>\nonly explored alone and don&#39;t know much of it, but I do know I saw a one<br/>\nSulon McMoor, who looked quite deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: CMai &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CMai@...\">CMai@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Hello Everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a lvl 17 bard trying to find a good place to hunt.
