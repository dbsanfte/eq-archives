It costs a spell component. Unfortunately, it is for the <br/>\nself only and will absorb up to a certain amount of damage. Later on they <br/>\nget Leatherskin, and later an even better one.<br/>\nNow the cool thing about Enchanters is they have a similar spell that they <br/>\nCAN cast on others, and it is very effective. It also gives the same message <br/>\nthat your magical skin absorbs the blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 11th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
