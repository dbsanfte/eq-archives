Take left side<br/>\ntunnel to vampire bat room.  Then take tunnel on left but inside that tunnel<br/>\n*hug the right wall* (greater ice bone skels will agro on you if you don&#39;t -<br/>\nthey see thru all invis).  Past the GIBS, you get to the bridge to the<br/>\ntower.  Cross and go towards rear.  Look for the 2nd ladder you see (off to<br/>\nthe one side iirc).  The assasin/Supplier room is up that 2nd ladder.<br/>\nSecond way if the BR is camped hard and all the deadly black widows are<br/>\ndead, take the right tunnel and from the vampire bat room go right thru the<br/>\nbugs - longer way but no GIBS (only bugs heh).  It eventually pops out on<br/>\nthe side of the bridge to the tower.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tProlly 35 to 45. The named&#39;s are tough.  Mean back stabs - keep your<br/>\nback to the wall at all times.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.\tGo at popular times to get the feel for the area and have lower<br/>\nrisk.  Then go back at slower times to try to get a group.  I think the mask<br/>\nis regarded as a class specific novelty these days - since its bard rogue<br/>\nonly.  You may be able to get loot rights just by asking and waiting.  Oh<br/>\nyeah waiting.  Welcome to EverCamp.  2 hour spawn time iirc? <br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, I have not been to Guk in a month or more.  Guess I need to go back.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 48 songs<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tAdam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, March 15, 2000 9:57 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Ghoul Assassin Advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are my humble questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I can get to the bedroom (who can&#39;t) but I don&#39;t know the exact way to<br/>\nthe assassin&#39;s room. How do I get to the room? I have several maps, but they<br/>\nare all a bit sketchy in the assasin area, and I&#39;ve heard there are ladders<br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Does anyone know what level group usually camps the room, or what the<br/>\ncommon loot practices are? (eg. if I go for the mask, will I be excluded<br/>\nfrom the other loot since I can use the mask, or is it not even counted<br/>\nsince it&#39;s no drop) It&#39;s not that I care, I&#39;ll go either way, I&#39;m just<br/>\ncurious.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Is there anything in particular I need to watch out for?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nthe Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
