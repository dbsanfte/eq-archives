To get from<br/>\nNeverwinter to Longsaddle (for instance)  you could take the short route<br/>\nthrough the Lost Hills (which were PvP) or the longer way (which was not<br/>\nPvP).  That way, whenever you set foot in the Hills and did a &lt;whatever the<br/>\ncommand was&gt; to see who all was in the area, if you saw certain guild names<br/>\nlike MECH, UDL, KAAOS, etc. you knew you were rolling the dice and taking<br/>\nthe chance of getting jumped.  Sure, it wasn&#39;t &quot;realistic&quot;, but it let the<br/>\nplayer make the decision every time they decided to make the trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 08, 2000 3:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Horizons (was Official confirmation from Ester)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Isn&#39;t Horizons another one of those games where the developers think<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that in spite of UO having nothing but problems with PKs and grief<br/>\n&gt; &gt;players, and EQ showing the overwhelming majority prefer a PvP<br/>\n&gt; &gt;switch, that they can come up with the perfect, abuse free forced PvP<br/>\n&gt; &gt;environment?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, and no.  I don&#39;t think they believe that their PvP environment will<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; perfect, but they think it will be good.  I like the concept behind it and<br/>\n&gt; generally I abhor PvP because it is all about PK for the most part.  Two<br/>\n&gt; things they are doing will make a huge difference.  Like the Team PvP<br/>\n&gt; servers, only races openly at war can PvP one another without consequence.<br/>\n&gt; The big difference is, there will not be a way to tell the difference<br/>\n&gt; between PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s on sight.  If you see an Orc on the road ahead and<br/>\n&gt; you are an elf, you know that he is dangerous to you, whether he is a<br/>\nplayer<br/>\n&gt; or an npc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Their consequence system is brutal against PK&#39;ers.  If you kill a race<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; you are not at war with, even a mere 5 or 6 times you will suffer enormous<br/>\n&gt; problems.  These problems will include having npc bounty-hunters showing<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; to kill you at random.  Playing a PK character would rapidly become<br/>\n&gt; unplayable as every time you logged in you were ambush by these npc<br/>\n&gt; enforcers.  Even if you kept your PK-ing to a race yours was at war with,<br/>\n&gt; you would always find yourself in enemy territory where few would feel any<br/>\n&gt; compunction against killing you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t really interested much in Horizons initailly due to it&#39;s PvP<br/>\n&gt; system, but they have convinced me to give it a chance.  They feel their<br/>\nPvP<br/>\n&gt; system will promote the &#39;risk game&#39; like Player competition while severely<br/>\n&gt; punishing to the point of oblivion anyone who PK&#39;s for the joy of hurting<br/>\n&gt; others.
