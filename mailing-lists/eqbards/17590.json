The problem<br/>\nis you have to get exeactly the right number and class of people for the<br/>\nfight.  Too few your damage just isn&#39;t keep up with his melee + ae<br/>\nlifetaps.  Too many and you&#39;re no longer adding anything to the fight,<br/>\njust more HP for him to gain when he lifetaps.  My guild has fought the<br/>\ncurrent Maestro with Six Note + Evensong, and we were able to kill him<br/>\nwith 4 casualties, all melee.<br/>\n\tI went oom at least 5 times during that fight.
