Someone was trying to get me to<br/>\npurchase one for 300pp, which seemed excessive for something I wanted mearly<br/>\nas a novety item.  Can anyone confirm the stats to be 4 dam/21 delay/proc:<br/>\nweak poison?  The seller was advertizing it to be proc: poison.  Big<br/>\ndifference there, but I still don&#39;t think it warrents 300 pp. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the and... part: how do you guys handle poiletly exiting a group?<br/>\nIf I can&#39;t get together with my normal crew/guild then I do like everyone<br/>\nelse and join up with whoever is around.  Sometimes this works wonderously<br/>\nand I add the best to my friends list for later, but most of the time its<br/>\njust so-so.  This I can handle, its part of the game.  Rarely however, you<br/>\njoin up with a completely backwards group and you know you&#39;re either going<br/>\nto die or things are going to be horrifically slow.  I always have a<br/>\ndifficult time leaving on poliet terms (since I really DON&#39;T want to just<br/>\nsay &quot;You guys are gonna get me killed, I&#39;m outta here.&quot; or, &quot;You guys don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to play and refuse to listen to my suggestions.&quot;) but...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree with the previous statment that bards make excellent battle<br/>\nfield commanders; for some reason we (this list at any rate) have invested<br/>\nthe time to learn how to make the peices work well together insofar as<br/>\nlearning other classes&#39; roles in the fray.  Twisting songs can be a chore at<br/>\ntime, but I have temedous fun with song selection, trying new song orders,<br/>\netc.  I feel above the fight in a lot of ways even if I&#39;m throwing punches<br/>\nor swinging a sword.  I hate to tell someone how to play their character but<br/>\nwhen you hear a 20th level warrior in oasis saying &quot;My taunt&#39;s at 15, I<br/>\nnever use it.&quot; or seeing the enchanter wade into the melee while trying to<br/>\ncast you feel compelled to say something if for nothing else than self<br/>\npreservation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone&#39;s on Veeshan, feel free to give me a tell, I&#39;m always up to<br/>\nsomething!<br/>\n<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Sicarius and Scummy @ Veeshan&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
