My SK friend (lvl 36) said don&#39;t bother saving bone chips for<br/>\nhim anymore as his pet was useless.  I didn&#39;t inquire further.<br/>\n<br/>\n(please don&#39;t take this next section too serious, I&#39;m not)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to caster pets for melee classes, that would be a joke.  Assuming same<br/>\nrules as other pets, a level 50 would summon a lvl 39 pet.  This caster pet<br/>\nwould hit the full resist cap for no effect on creatures 45+.  You wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe able to control what spells the pet casts, the stupid pet would get to<br/>\nmake this choice.  And remember how one blast-happy wizard can cause the<br/>\nwhole party to die, one blast-happy stupid pet would be even more trouble.<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t take long for tanks to realize they are better off without pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you really need is a pet cleric that follows you around and casts heal<br/>\non you in combat.  That&#39;s what every tank really wants.  Knowing Verant,<br/>\nyou&#39;d probably get stuck with a pet bard that doesn&#39;t even know how to sing,<br/>\nmuch less twist.  And if it could sing, it would only Bellow in battle and<br/>\nplay Jig to speed up mana regen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut seriously, pets are very nice under the right circumstances.  Pets come<br/>\nwith a lot of baggage that make them less valuable than a tank in almost<br/>\nevery way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
