I first thought, <br/>\n&gt;   maybe the server is in fact telling the object it is stunned<br/>\n&gt;   but expiring it so quickly that nothing happens.  But wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   you see:  You are stunned.  You are unstunned.  at the same <br/>\n&gt;   time?  I would think so.  Or maybe telling an object to stun<br/>\n&gt;   for 0 seconds is just skipped since a 0 second stun is obsolete.<br/>\n&gt;   That could be, then no messages would display.

Pixie Strike and Lullaby would<br/>\ndefinitely fall under that category since they often do not<br/>\nlast their full duration.  Assuming that&#39;s the case, the 0 sec<br/>\nStrike would be:<br/>\n<br/>\nStrike not resisted<br/>\nStunned<br/>\nRoll to see if mob breaks out<br/>\nSuccess - mob breaks out<br/>\nUnstunned<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even a 0 second stun on yourself should be accompanied by<br/>\nthe &quot;You are stunned&quot; message.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it would seem something is just causing the song not to<br/>\nwork at all, either unrelated to resists, or done via a hidden<br/>\nresist check for which we get no messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
