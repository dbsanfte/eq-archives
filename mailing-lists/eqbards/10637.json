If it&#39;s true then the quest is either<br/>\nbroken or I completed it incorrectly as this is what I thought I&#39;d done:<br/>\n<br/>\nFabian&#39;s Strings: Sansa Nusk in the Bard&#39;s Guildhouse is trying to make lute<br/>\nstrings for Fabian.  This is a difficult task because<br/>\nFabian uses special strings made out of Troll Gut, and Sansa is all out.<br/>\nSansa will ask you to bring her troll gut so she can make<br/>\nstring for Fabian.  I have been told that Troll Gut can be found on  a ghoul<br/>\nnamed Zahal the Vile in North Karanas.  It might also be<br/>\nfound on some trolls wandering in the Karanas, but I am not sure of that.<br/>\n(Submitted by Doriath)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; troll guts.
