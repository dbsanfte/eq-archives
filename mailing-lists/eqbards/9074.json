If I am playing heal and a mob runs through our group<br/>\ngetting pulled to another group, I will get all the Faction +/-&#39;s for that<br/>\nmob being killed. I think this was because in Beta the<br/>\nbards songs affected everyone (grouped or not) within a certain radius. I<br/>\nthink this area effect code is still in the game but with<br/>\nan additional check (i.e. in radius + in group) for PC&#39;s but for aggro mobs<br/>\nI think they effectively get &quot;hit&quot; by our songs (thus we<br/>\nget those faction hits for mobs we never touched).
