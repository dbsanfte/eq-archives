I typed<br/>\n&gt; in /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; seen in a long<br/>\n&gt; time.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed <br/>\n&gt; in addition to<br/>\n&gt; players.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, <br/>\n&gt; or /groupsay but<br/>\n&gt; instead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the <br/>\n&gt; phrase I typed<br/>\n&gt; to my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire <br/>\n&gt; list, there are<br/>\n&gt; a few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made <br/>\n&gt; numerous attempts<br/>\n&gt; at removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces <br/>\n&gt; before I type<br/>\n&gt; in any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my <br/>\n&gt; friend list.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ <br/>\n&gt; directory this will<br/>\n&gt; delete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>\n&gt; friends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds.
