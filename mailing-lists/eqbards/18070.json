I placed my order the day the store opened,<br/>\nand of course I paid for overnight just in case.  Well...when I found out<br/>\nthat<br/>\nthey had just started taking orders and that it wouldnt SHIP until the<br/>\n11th...<br/>\nI was one of those &quot;WHy the hell did you charge me overnight then you<br/>\ngoits!&quot;<br/>\npeople.   Well...Turns out I was lucky as hell.  Mine shipped and got here<br/>\non the<br/>\n14th.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey DID send a shipment confirmation e-mail to me, so I wouldnt worry<br/>\nabout that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they should offer to cancel orders that havent shipped and let you<br/>\ngo buy it in stores on monday if you want to.   The upgrade came with a<br/>\ncloth map ( pretty crappy craftmanship comared to the Ultima cloth ones<br/>\nthough...)<br/>\nbut it didnt come with a new manual.   If the retail one comes with a new<br/>\nmaual with iskar history/art/whatever....it will make me mad.<br/>\nI love aving those little things...:( *sniff*  oh well...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor comfort I&#39;ll say that it hasnt done me any good to have it.<br/>\nThe only thing I see is that now on the server select screen it says<br/>\n&quot;Kunark Enabled&quot;  Thats it.  If you have a level 50 you could be<br/>\nexp&#39;s now...but other than that its nothing big.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with your orders though.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Oh!  the upgrade also comes with a card advertising the<br/>\nnew line of EQ toys...and you can cash it in for a free SharkJaw<br/>\nCutlass toy..:)  pretty cool...however it wont ship to you until<br/>\nSEPTEMBER 30th!<br/>\n<br/>\nAUGH...oh well..:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------ ~ -------<br/>\nRobert McDonnell                                                 .   .<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mindspring.com/~sigma7\">http://www.mindspring.com/~sigma7</a>                               /  V  &#92;<br/>\nICQ: 6694071                                                   /(linux)&#92;<br/>\n                &quot;I think I can fly...probably just falling&quot;      ^^ ^^<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;What does<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that tell you.. sweet deniability ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have concrete proof it is a conspiracy.
