Did this many many times in the early days when only a handful<br/>\nof Uber ones were 30+. Generally, later levels you want a see invis to know<br/>\nif someone just went past your camp: a) they may be scouting a KS, b) if<br/>\ntheir invis blows you know who brought that major train. For songs, I like<br/>\nto think we have a song for every occasion, sometimes more than one. Some<br/>\nI&#39;ve never used or used only once or don&#39;t use now, but maybe the right<br/>\nsituation just hasn&#39;t presented itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlowing Stone Band: comes out of Sol A, near the Goblin King?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrain Bite Quest: It&#39;s a 39th wizzy spell quest. Note I listed my wizzy in<br/>\nmy sig, as she&#39;s just recently done 30 to 40, she knows more about exp at<br/>\nthat range than my bard, who was over that level when Kunark came out. My<br/>\nbard did the mid 20s to low 30&#39;s in Upper Guk, camping Ghoulsbanes with<br/>\nguildmates. I love the croak a dying frog makes!<br/>\n<br/>\nNailed down for Clarity: it&#39;s easier than you think. My regular groupmates<br/>\nall have these wonderful emotes to remind me when I&#39;ve forgotten to turn the<br/>\nclarity on for them. Most involve *choke*, *gasp*, etc. And one is my<br/>\ncleric, who is at his computer right beside me. /poke becomes literal. From<br/>\na strategy standpoint, it&#39;s our usual practice to send the monk out to pull,<br/>\nespecially in case of unknowns. I pull when it takes superior speed!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe 54 Bard<br/>\nBrilinia Ilisidi  40 wiz<br/>\nBrillinia   16 cleric<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
