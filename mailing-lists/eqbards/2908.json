I&#39;m a very &quot;young&quot; (level 3) wood elf bard on the <br/>\nQuellious server.  I&#39;ve left Kelethin because of the <br/>\nextreme lag, same with Freeport (not to mention that dry <br/>\ndesert air was murder on my delicate elven skin ;).  So <br/>\nas of last night, I&#39;m bound to Rivervale.  Eventually I <br/>\nintend to make it clear across Norrath.  Yes, I have <br/>\nwanderlust -- is it not a good thing I&#39;ve chosen bard as <br/>\nmy profession? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are all so knowledgeable ... I&#39;m learning a lot from <br/>\nreading all your posts.  Even though I only have 2 songs, <br/>\nI&#39;ve already started playing with the juggling I read <br/>\nabout here (never woulda thought of that myself).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the advice I&#39;ve read so far will help me when I&#39;m <br/>\n&quot;grown up&quot; a little (a lot?) more.  So I&#39;d like to ask <br/>\nall of you for advice for a beginning bard.  I know some <br/>\nof the decisions I make at the start will end up <br/>\naffecting my success later in my life.  So any pointers <br/>\nwould be well appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nWynsong<br/>\nWood Elf Bard, Level 3<br/>\nRivervale, Quellious<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~~~ Remember that our illusion of control is just <br/>\nthat ... an illusion ~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\nICQ#1976509</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
