Here&#39;s part of a thread from Usenet in which EQ<br/>\nProducer Brad McQuaid responds to the dungeon upgrade: <br/>\nFrom the Druid&#39;s Grove:<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSaturday night Test was treated to a rare GM event in which high level (high<br/>\n20&#39;s to mid-30&#39;s) gnolls were in South Karana running around killing people<br/>\nlike most typical GM events seem to be. I did not participate but today some<br/>\nfriends told me that afterwards SplitPaw had been revamped in much the same<br/>\nway that Kithicor has and to come check it out. I have not had a chance to<br/>\ndo so much yet but I can say that the level has been increased to about a<br/>\n30-50 lvl dungeon from what I have seen and heard with gnolls conning blue<br/>\nto me at 40th at the first bridge area. Not sure if it has been reitemized<br/>\nbut I am hoping it will be, if so it will be another nice upgrade to a zone<br/>\nthat Verant has made recently. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed -- lower level players rarely went to Paw, probably because of it&#39;s<br/>\ndistance. So, now that most of our players are approaching mid-level, we&#39;ve<br/>\nchanged the zone&#39;s population (and treasure) in hopes it will be more<br/>\npopular now. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\nBrad McQuaid<br/>\nProducer, EverQuest www.everquest.com<br/>\nVice President, Verant Interactive Inc.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------- <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 35th Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
