The level 15-25 portions of Permafrost are all<br/>\nin tight, twisty passages, and the goblins really train there<br/>\n(10+ goblins is not uncommon, 20+ is not unheard of).  The<br/>\nnumbers make it impossible for an enchanter to target them one<br/>\nby one, and the close quarters make it pointless for them to<br/>\nuse area effect mesmerize since it also mesmerizes themselves<br/>\n(only spell I know that works like the bard&#39;s L43 song).
