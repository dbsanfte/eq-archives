While fleeing a bad fire giant pull that had already killed 9 ppl<br/>\nand our group gater, I was summoned into some &quot;hole&quot; in the zone that<br/>\nwas like a grey nothingness, then fell from there into some lava and<br/>\ndied. From what we could work out, when the fire giant summoned me I<br/>\nappeared in a wall and then fell through it to an area of lava that<br/>\nwasn&#39;t generally accessable in the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are still a lot of places in zones where you can fall through the<br/>\nedges of some of the surfaces into non-existant zone areas, with very<br/>\nunpredictable results. We found a couple in Cazic, especially around the<br/>\nperimeter of that open area on the long tunnel to the back temple in<br/>\nCazic as well as up on the roof above the well. We always report them so<br/>\nthe GM is used to hearing from us. If you&#39;ve ever had someone die and<br/>\nthier body show up at the zone instead of deep in the dungeon where they<br/>\nreally died you may be seeing the fix put in when they find these holes.<br/>\nI think they are vertices that aren&#39;t properly joined in the world<br/>\nbuilding softway or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
