It was very<br/>\napparent that nothing that is related to bards is even remotely &#39;high<br/>\npriority&#39;.  Bards are at this point pretty much &#39;one hit wonders&#39;.  If it<br/>\nwere not for manasong the only groups we&#39;d be getting into would be those<br/>\nwith our friends.  Bards have become the most &#39;group oriented&#39; kiting<br/>\nenabled class imaginable.  Every reason I had for playing a bard in the<br/>\nbeginning has been systematically taken away, other than the role-playing<br/>\naspect.  But hey!  my druid can hold a mandolin as well as anybody!<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously though.  I played a bard because of the tactical flexibility.<br/>\nThere was actually a choice of which songs to use in which circumstances and<br/>\nat what times.  When was it better to Lullaby, when to Chords?  When was it<br/>\nbetter to Anthem, and when Psalm?  Those days have gone by as each and every<br/>\ntactical option is deleted or made unusable.  I never Chain unless alone<br/>\nsnare is now far better and only level 1!  I never Lullaby unless it&#39;s to<br/>\nhelp some newbie, and even then it&#39;s pretty pathetic.  I&#39;ve given up trying<br/>\nto Pixie anything, better to just charm it and be &#39;protected&#39; when the spell<br/>\ngoes off.  Verant has successfully taken 90% of the things I loved about<br/>\nbards and killed them.  All because of some &#39;balance&#39; issue that never<br/>\nexisted.  If bards were so powerful, how come we&#39;ve always been among the<br/>\nrarest classes in a game that&#39;s all about power???<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi, lvl 31 tailor, retired bard<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Adam Wasserman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wassermana@...\">wassermana@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 11, 2000 9:44 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Abashi finally responds... sort of<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the only answer we can respond with is that these songs need to be<br/>\nreevaluated now, not later.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W.

At least once in my presence in full view of many<br/>\nothers at the infamous &quot;snake testing&quot;.  Obviously bards just aren&#39;t a &quot;high<br/>\npriority&quot; for anything.
