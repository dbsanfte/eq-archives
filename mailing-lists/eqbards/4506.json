Mithril Armor (Where and how I find any of these<br/>\npieces) Adamantite Armor(Double for this info I like to know if its better<br/>\nthan Mithril).<br/>\n<br/>\nPs. I think I&#39;m gonna just roll on stocks and Not get a Last name to be<br/>\nunique =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks To all in Advance,<br/>\nChancez Bard of the 22nd Chord on BristleBane. <br/>\n&quot;Do Not Fear What You Can Not Understand&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n´┐¢ You Wouldn&#39;t Change Me If You Could ´┐¢<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________<br/>\nFree email with personality!
