Verant will quickly realize that closer bind<br/>\npoints unbalance the caster/melee class and therefore (and yes, I&#39;m<br/>\nkidding) they will put all the new bind spots directly on mobs&#39; paths and<br/>\nspawn points.<br/>\n<br/>\nLavastorm = No - I think they&#39;ll crank up the xp modifier for Najena, and<br/>\nmake it worth being bound in FP for the light races to take the risk.<br/>\nOther<br/>\nthan that, it&#39;s too close to Neriak.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I figure with both Najena and Solusek in there it stands a chance of<br/>\ngetting a bind point.  Unless you can bind in Solusek...dunno I&#39;m just a<br/>\nnewbie.<br/>\n<br/>\nSouth Karana = Unk - No if they reason that Arena is only 2 zone lines<br/>\naway.<br/>\nYes if they decide it&#39;s too hard to get a bind in Arena, since there is<br/>\nnormally nobody in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I was also thinking of folks hunting in the Karanas who currently use<br/>\nhighpass or qeynos because they&#39;re too young to safely reach the arena.  I<br/>\nthink someone else also mentioned this.<br/>\n<br/>\nLfay = No - Only 1 zone away from Gfay, and the spires.  Although the<br/>\npathing is broke, they could probably even get away without increasing the<br/>\nxp modifier for Mistmoore.  It&#39;s always been relatively popular despite<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\nfaults.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Yeah, you&#39;re probably right.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeroot = No - Only 1 zone away from Cazic Thule.  Too close.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Didn&#39;t know you could bind in CT.  &lt;/shrugs&gt;  I&#39;m just a newbie.<br/>\n<br/>\nInnothule = Yes - Despite being only 1 zone from Upper Guk, it is a good<br/>\nmidpoint between arena and Freeport.  Will perhaps be a &quot;camp&quot; of some<br/>\ntype,<br/>\nwith light aligned guards?  The points for, taking into consideration the<br/>\nzones around it, to me seem to outweight the points against, regarding the<br/>\nproximity to Lguk.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Actually I had this on my &quot;not so likely&quot; list originally.  Don&#39;t know<br/>\nabout your server, but Guk&#39;s pretty active on Tunare from what I hear.  If<br/>\nbind points are going in to encourage travelling to underused zones,<br/>\nInnothule would probably be quite low on the list of possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of Odus = No - Between Erud for the lights, and Paineel for the darks,<br/>\nnothing needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Due to the boat ride, I still hold Erud&#39;s Crossing could get one.  Most<br/>\ntimes I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve been alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Befallen is avoided, not because of binding issues, but because it&#39;s a<br/>\ndeath trap with little reason to try.)<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Avoided??  Why Belfallen is full of lockpicking rogues! ;^)<br/>\n<br/>\n*** In my opinion, if Belfallen were closer to a newbie&#39;s bind point it<br/>\nwould get used more.  I haven&#39;t fought in it much, but it didn&#39;t seem to be<br/>\nany more of a death trap than Blackburrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverfrost = Yes - A dark aligned camp would be most likely, since light<br/>\naligned folks can bind in Halas.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Good point.  Forgot about the evil folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia, newbie of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
