What happens if you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;target a mob from a distance but the rest of your party is standing near <br/>\n&gt; &gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mob? Will they also take damage?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gatin of E&#39;ci (who won&#39;t have to worry about this issue for quite some <br/>\n&gt; &gt;time)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; hmm nope, like any damaging magic in the game (on the regular non-pvp <br/>\n&gt; servers anyways) you cannot harm other players with it unless you are <br/>\n&gt; dueling. So far i&#39;ve killed myself twice with this song - once because I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know any better, the second time I was lagged to hell and the mob <br/>\n&gt; warped next to me when it hit (ouch).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Kelethin of the 48th Chorus<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
