So I<br/>\n&gt;would expect some variability in your mana regeneration times<br/>\n&gt;regardless of whether or not the jig was playing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There&#39;s also the possibility the jig may be interacting<br/>\n&gt;unintentionally with meditation failures, causing an increase<br/>\n&gt;in regeneration rate.  e.g. if &quot;succeeding&quot; at meditation<br/>\n&gt;means you gain, say, 5 points of mana, and the jig reduces the<br/>\n&gt;time for a meditation pulse from 8 sec to 6 sec (though I<br/>\n&gt;still think this is a client refresh illusion), then it would<br/>\n&gt;increase the regeneration rate because the success/fail check<br/>\n&gt;would be made more frequently.  That would decrease<br/>\n&gt;regeneration times at early levels, but show no difference at<br/>\n&gt;later levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
