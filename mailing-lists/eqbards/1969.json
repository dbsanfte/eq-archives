The spawn is quite rapid and we can usually alternate with a <br/>\nsecond group for the 3 on the tower and both groups have as much action as <br/>\nthey can handle. There are also some aviaks on the Arena island. This is a <br/>\nfairly isolated spot so there may not be much competition depending on your <br/>\nserver, on Xegony it is quite popular. You will need a group but we have <br/>\nfought them from mid teens to low 20&#39;s so far with everyone getting exp. The <br/>\nentrance to Lake Rathe zone is in the corner of south karanas past Paw and <br/>\nthe aviak town. Also, the aviaks in Lake Rathe do not appear to give a <br/>\nfaction adjustment. There are many other islands in Lake Rathe to explore <br/>\nalso.<br/>\nGood Journeys,<br/>\nBrilinnia of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
