Not all that good, but I believe <br/>\nit is needed for a monk headband quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoblin Patriarch drops the frost totem which is <br/>\nneeded for the Crafted armor (boots) quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nKing *something* drops the Symbol of Loyalty to Vox.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a bracer, AC 7 (same as plate), very light, some<br/>\nbonuses to Save vs Cold, and wearable by ALL races and<br/>\nclass. However, if you do get one, give it to the monk<br/>\nor all the other non plate-wearing classes first, it<br/>\nmakes the most sense. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will need a level 30 or higher group to clear the <br/>\nroom, once you clear it, you can hold the room with <br/>\njust a high 20s group IMO. I&#39;m convinced that if you fight your way and<br/>\nclear everything before the King<br/>\nroom, you can lure them out and nod them (so you are <br/>\nout of range from the Ice Giants) and take them more<br/>\neasily. However, the one time I tried that, something<br/>\nwent horribly wrong and it became a pull of 20 goblins<br/>\nor so. It wasn&#39;t pretty. What normally happens is that<br/>\nyou invis pass the weaker gobs and pull the King room<br/>\nstraight. I don&#39;t like this method since one of my<br/>\nparty members always dies but that seems to be the <br/>\ncommon strategy in there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\n<br/>\nDarrian Ashoka</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
