Grouping is where the fun is at.<br/>\nHowever, it&#39;s not fun to be decent at some things (DD and heal) for 30<br/>\nlevels, then suddenly have half your ability taken away (DDs resisted) and<br/>\nyour other main ability fade away slowly (no heals above greater heal).<br/>\nYes, you can still be very useful. But no longer can you be, to a group,<br/>\nwhat you&#39;ve been for 30 levels (a nuker or healer as needed). That&#39;s a<br/>\nhard change to make -- especially when Verant keeps waving in your face<br/>\n&quot;you&#39;re the second/third best nukers in the game!&quot; but decline to mention<br/>\nthat&#39;s IF you&#39;re not resisted.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of like how they go &quot;you have the best root in the game! it roots AND<br/>\ndoes damage!&quot; Sure.. at level 30, that 10dmg with a root is really worth<br/>\nthe extra 40% resists..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, getting pretty off topic here.. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI see you read the editorial on EQvault about druids too.  My druid is using <br/>\nensnare.. and THAT gets resisted quite a bit, as does immolate (I stopped <br/>\nusing it)  Basically, in places like Solusek, I&#39;ve been using things like <br/>\ndamage shields, lightning (give me a break 99 damage? HAH), crud,  and <br/>\ntremor where appropriate.  I&#39;ve been grouping with mostly the same ppl since <br/>\nlevel 7, too.  Thank goodness they are friends, or my druid would soon not <br/>\nhave a group.  Still at level 30 too.  (I hate to see what the higher levels <br/>\nare like.. UGH!)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow.. as for ON TOPIC.. my bard finally made level 20 last night!! woohoo!!  <br/>\nNever thought I&#39;d see the day, since my poor bard has died at least 3 times <br/>\nevery level since 15.  It was getting so bad, my regular group started <br/>\ncalling me &quot;bard bait&quot; heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheres no doubt Verant needs to do some more tweaking on the classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Treehugger and Songmaker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
