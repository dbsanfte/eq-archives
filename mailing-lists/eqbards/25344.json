I can see,<br/>\nSylly, how it sounds like sour grapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMenuette did a superb job of making some of the points I hinted at but made so<br/>\nvaguely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMenuette: &quot;The contests are totally without meaning to people who either play<br/>\nto have fun or have limited time available to pursue the game.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI completely agree with you, Sylly, that some enjoy the challenge or the simple<br/>\njoy of the experience of an event in EQ.  I also have a great deal of respect<br/>\nfor everyone who seeks out whatever fun they can :).  That, to me, is what it&#39;s<br/>\nabout.  So there can be meaning there, but I don&#39;t think that breed is the most<br/>\ncommon one in EQ :).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeneuette: &quot;The contest is a fanstastic reward for all those who are playing to<br/>\nwin, and have the time and resources to do so.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a game that is difficult to impossible to &#39;win&#39;.  Here is one rare<br/>\nevent where there are &#39;winners&#39;.  And yet the event is designed so that those<br/>\nwho are -already- &#39;winning&#39; can win some more.  More reward to the already<br/>\nmaximally rewarded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t for a moment say that those like Thott have not earned their rewards. <br/>\nI, as co-founder of a guild that is moving towards the end game, understand<br/>\nclearly the challenges and sacrifices and brain power required to get to the<br/>\nend game in EQ.  So I have the utmost admiration and respect for their<br/>\naccomplishments.  I also have some insight, as a member of the community on<br/>\nMithaniel Marr, into how fast Afterlife burns out and through members in<br/>\npursuit of winning EQ.  But now I digress... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMenuette: &quot;You also can&#39;t convince me that with those rules it will find the<br/>\nbetter &quot;Bard&quot;.  It will find the Bard with the best in-game resources.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is really the core of my discontent with these contests.  I would love<br/>\nto see tests of skill and bravery that would reward people who have spent their<br/>\ndays played, whether they be in the 10s or the 100s, honing all the skills<br/>\navailable for their class.  And I mean in game, not a con.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is the better bard?  Is it the one who has chosen the right songs to whip<br/>\nout to save a desperate situation in a group or raid, or the one who has a<br/>\nprimal weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I know Verant&#39;s answer.  And I flat out disagree with it.  You and I<br/>\nseem to agree Sylly, that there should be other events.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so vehement in my dislike of this one because it is the only game in town,<br/>\nand those who are already &#39;winning&#39; the game win here too.
