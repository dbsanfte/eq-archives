Well, old Fred starts whacking on<br/>\n&gt; Merv but Merv don&#39;t care about some lame greenie whacking at him and keeps<br/>\n&gt; chasing me.  So, I just keep on kiting and eventually Fred nibbles him down<br/>\n&gt; and KS&#39;s him off me.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now I am thinking, hmmm, I bet I could do this with a party member and we<br/>\n&gt; would get he kill and the xp??? Might have to try it sometime.  I think that<br/>\n&gt; Merv might view things a little differently if a party member is slashing<br/>\n&gt; his tail feathers or not?  Or charm Fred when he has Merv down to low health<br/>\n&gt; - I guess that would have worked too.

If the griffon was already low<br/>\nenough and fred killed it, you would have gotten XP, and could have<br/>\nlooted it and run for the zone. Since fred does not die in this<br/>\nscenario, no faction hit. Have to test if you get faction hits from your<br/>\npet dying to an NPC, not sure on this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly, no offense, you seem to have trouble charming? (just from your<br/>\npost here) One misconception I think many Bards have is that you sing<br/>\ncharm, it works and you sit back and watch the show. This is not true.<br/>\nI&#39;d say charm fails at LEAST 50%, maybe 75% some times. The trick is to<br/>\nweave charm and selo&#39;s(with drum) so you can run backwards from the<br/>\ntargets and re-sing charm as many times as needed. During a particularly<br/>\nbad run yesterday I had to sing charm NINE times before I charmed my HG.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n35th Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
