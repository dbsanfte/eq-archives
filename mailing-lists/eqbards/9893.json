The systems we use most are FFA, and a homebrewed<br/>\nsystem.  I loot all the coin and split it as we go, if there&#39;s<br/>\nan item I give it to people in alpha order making sure each<br/>\nperson gets about a FS weapon&#39;s value in items before going<br/>\non.  The coin splitting is a bit tricky since it requires I<br/>\nwait until I get an amount of coin that&#39;s divisible by the<br/>\nnumber of group members and add any remainder to subsequent<br/>\nloots, but then math has always been a strong point with me.  <br/>\n:-)  I usually split coins every 2-3 mobs, so it&#39;s difficult<br/>\nto &quot;miss out&quot; due to never getting to your turn.  We destroy<br/>\nall silver and copper too unless someone wants it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis requires everyone to trust the looter, but it&#39;s worked<br/>\npretty well.  We&#39;ve had 4 hour playsessions and by the end<br/>\neveryone was within 2-3 plat of me (mostly roundoff errors -<br/>\nif I&#39;m in a 6 person group and have looted 4pp and 17gp, I&#39;ll<br/>\njust go ahead and split 6 pp).  The only complaint I had was<br/>\nfrom someone who said he liked the thrill of looting a kill<br/>\nhimself and the uncertainty of knowing what it had.  OTOH,<br/>\nseveral people actually like being relieved of the burden of<br/>\nhaving to loot coin and destroying the silver and copper.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
