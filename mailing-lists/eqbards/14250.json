Don&#39;t any of the programmers on the list find it odd that<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t appear to have some kind of source control system that would<br/>\n&gt; allow patching of the currently running code so they didn&#39;t have to go<br/>\n&gt; live with partly finished changes?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re proposing they bring down the servers again to repatch.  <br/>\nThey may have decided that disruption was not worth the<br/>\nbenefit of temporarily removing a nerf to one of the strongest<br/>\nclasses in the game.  OTOH, when the bard proc bug showed up<br/>\nagain, they did an emergency patch two days later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in large software projects, you tend to go with tested<br/>\nexecutables rather than pieces.  The executable they tested<br/>\nhad the necro pet nerf in it.
