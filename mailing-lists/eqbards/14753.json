I<br/>\nhave never been harassed as much as I have in the last couple of months. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mind answering questions- that I will always do, but I have never<br/>\nasked someone to give me money or equipment for no reason- that constitutes<br/>\nwhining :)-and i just hit &quot;ignore&quot;. Sad, really, because I love to surprise<br/>\nnewbies by giving them some money or an item -I especially like the little<br/>\nguys who buff me and ask for nothing- I realize they are practising, but<br/>\nwhen they ask for or expect nothing in return, that&#39;s when being a nice guy<br/>\nkinda makes you feel good- but now I try to avoid the big  cities.<br/>\n<br/>\nScanna Swiftsinger<br/>\nlvl 36<br/>\nBertoxx<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Daniel P.
