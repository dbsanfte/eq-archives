My guild was in there last night,<br/>\nand I think the max number of people in the zone the entire<br/>\ntime was 22.  At one point, there were 10 people in the zone,<br/>\n8 of them were from our guild, and 2 were some folks camping<br/>\nthe room next door.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of its buggy nature, I don&#39;t think MM mobs ever got<br/>\nthe upgrades other mobs got.  I was pulling singles for a<br/>\nL30-40 group, and they were knocking everything dead within 6<br/>\nsong cycles (roughly 20 seconds).  Most of the MM mobs are<br/>\nblue until about L43.  In comparison, I was in a L40-46 group<br/>\nthe previous day killing greater kobolds in Sol B, some of<br/>\nwhich turn green at L46 (so only a 3-4 level difference from<br/>\nthe MM mobs).  The fights took about a minute.  Because you<br/>\ncan kill MM stuff 3x faster than kobolds in Sol B (which most<br/>\nalready regard as a rather easy) for just slightly less<br/>\nexperience, the exp you get in MM is insane.  A couple of the<br/>\nfolks I was pulling for said they&#39;d gotten 4 bubbles in the 3<br/>\nhours we were there.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
