I was finishing reading this list<br/>\nat the time and eager to get home to play.  Time was<br/>\n4:30.  4:45 said employee was in the parking lot with<br/>\na 9mm threatning to kill our HR director.  4:55 SWAT<br/>\nTeam arrives.  5:00 I walk out to my car and go home<br/>\nanyway, no damn sniper is going to keep me from cazic<br/>\ntonite. :P  Anyway, I think I was pretty safe, anymore<br/>\nthan a hundred yards and a 9 is pretty inaccurate,<br/>\nright?  Besides, I think he had a low 1hd missle stat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Ryan Honeyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slasher@...\">slasher@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Well, at least your not bitter<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; LOL<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheer me up! &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s because I read the list at work.
