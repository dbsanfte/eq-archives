The only way we can do this is by testing.   Two people of equal<br/>\nlevel dual.  The first time,  the &#39;testee&#39; is in full bronze.  Record every<br/>\nmiss and hit and the damage amount.  Now have the &#39;testee&#39; remove all the<br/>\nbronze armor and try to get his AC up with banded and buffs.  His AC HAS to<br/>\nbe with in 3 points of when he was in bronze.  Record every miss and hit and<br/>\nthe damage amount.  This will give you your answer one way or the other I<br/>\nthink.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a>.<br/>\n&gt; hp.com]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, July 26, 1999 4:17 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRE: [eqbards] Dragoon Dirk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      Now wait a minute.  How in the world is a discussion of which weapons<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      are good for bards off topic???  Lets not get carried away here.<br/>\n&gt; True <br/>\n&gt;      the twinking/lottery thread was way OT but lets not let that scare us<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      off of talking about stuff that is useful to all of us, especially <br/>\n&gt;      those of us under 20 who rely on this list for advice to avoid making<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      painful errors.  If I hadn&#39;t joined this list I might still be<br/>\n&gt; singing <br/>\n&gt;      one song at a time...  )  <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;      For example I asked if Bronze Armor stopped more damage then banded <br/>\n&gt;      over and above the AC increase. (which is very modest compared to its<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      weight.)  Not one answer.  This is a relevant Bard topic because we <br/>\n&gt;      can&#39;t afford to put all our extra points into Strength and the <br/>\n&gt;      decision to wear Bronze plate is a tough one.

The WB <br/>\n&gt; Rapier is 6 dam 23 delay, but no stat bonuses and wieghs over twice as<br/>\n&gt; much. <br/>\n&gt;   Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>\n&gt; considering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  The Dirk, IMO, is the most <br/>\n&gt; unbalanced weapon in the game.
