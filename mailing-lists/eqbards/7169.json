When the link-dead player returns, the group members will be<br/>\nnotified as well.<br/>\n- Pets with greater than 20 hit points cannot receive hit point buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team <br/>\n<br/>\nMade me wonder, if I&#39;m charmed will my groupmates get a message that I&#39;m<br/>\nlink-dead?<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
