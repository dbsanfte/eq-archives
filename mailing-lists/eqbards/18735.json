At least if you plan<br/>\non ever doing a kedge raid. The problem with the song is it prevents<br/>\nenduring breath from being cast on people in your party, which makes<br/>\nthem totally reliant on the song, and no one in their right mind would<br/>\nbet their life on that. Like levitate, endure breath song is one of<br/>\nthose songs that should have been made self only for all the real use it<br/>\ngets in parties, compared to the real hassle it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt still doesn&#39;t make up for the crap AC though. As usual the live team<br/>\nhas has no concept of balance between classes. Look at SK weapons. From<br/>\nan absolute dearth of them prior to the expansion, you now can&#39;t turn<br/>\naround in Kunark without tripping over a new one. Meanwhile Abashi is<br/>\nstill maintaining that caster items are out there somewhere, you just<br/>\nhave to keep looking. (somehow pretty reminiscent of the recent<br/>\nstatements he made on spell drops)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs well, the druid armor is nothing to write home about. The arms have a<br/>\ndot druids capable of getting them stopped using over 10 levels ago and<br/>\nhas 1 more AC than their planes arms. The bracer has 2 more AC and a<br/>\nsimilarly lame spell, share wolfform. Ya, having that as a mana free<br/>\ncast is ___so__ useful. I&#39;d certainly be discarding my 9 wisdom verm<br/>\nbracer for that in a second. As well, they couldn&#39;t even be bothered<br/>\nmaking the druid armor a different color. It looks almost exactly the<br/>\nsame green as vermiculated and ranger chain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear that the ranger breastplate in the beta for Kunark had effect:<br/>\nGate. That&#39;s going to be nice, for Rangers anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
