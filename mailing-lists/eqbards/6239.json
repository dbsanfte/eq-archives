As things stand, the most desirable items are<br/>\nmonopolized by those with higher level characters (usually too<br/>\nhigh for the mob), almost to the exclusion of others.  I have<br/>\nthree paladin friends, and we spent well over two weeks trying<br/>\nto camp for ghoulbane.  But most of the time we had to hunt<br/>\nelsewhere because a bunch of level 45-50 non-paladins were<br/>\ncamping the spot because they&#39;d traded away their last<br/>\nghoulbane and &quot;needed&quot; another.  (Their excuse was that<br/>\neverything else in the L40-50 areas was camped.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the player-to-player trade (or twink) aspect of an RPG<br/>\nstarts to interfere with the adventuring aspect, something is<br/>\nwrong.  After playing this game, I&#39;ve decided a &quot;shows up only<br/>\na few times a day&quot; system is really stupid when a mob that&#39;s a<br/>\nchallenge to you is a pushover for someone else, and there&#39;s<br/>\nno system to enforce taking turns.  I think a better system<br/>\nwould be to allow each character to loot each special mob once<br/>\nin a lifetime, and put lower level looting limits on the mobs<br/>\n(to prevent the use of mules).  No more kill stealing for nice<br/>\nitems, no more harvesting to trade/sell on EBay/twink, no more<br/>\ncamping the same place for a week (and blocking out others) so<br/>\nyour entire guild can be outfitted with the rare item, and no<br/>\nmore having to wait 3 days for a rare mob to show up.  The<br/>\n&quot;rare&quot; mob could always be there, and rarity of an item could<br/>\nbe determined by how frequently he drops the booby prize.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me, as you get some of the nice continuous effect<br/>\nsongs like invisibility or levitation, you will wish you had a<br/>\npair of jboots.  My friends have started poking fun at me<br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve been asking for SoW a lot lately.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
