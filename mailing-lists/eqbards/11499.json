It could last 10 seconds, or<br/>\nabsorb 10 hits.<br/>\nTo me it looks like a multiple use song like what you people was suggesting<br/>\nour songs should be like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gives a Str buff, a protective skin (not sure on effect), to me it looks<br/>\nas though it heals 1 point of dmg and dmg&#39;s the enemy with 1 point of dmg<br/>\nper tick. Kind of like a life tap spell. Not sure about the last bit<br/>\nthough, might be that it gives bonus hp&#39;s to a max of 25 (skin like wood<br/>\nbuff sorta thing.<br/>\nAll these details are very vague, best wait for it to be properly tested.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadagan, bard of 30 songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Did a lava corpse recovery last night, dumb monk&#39;s first visit in the<br/>\nzone and he falls in the lava and dies, I can&#39;t locate the corpse till he<br/>\ngets back so I wait, when he gets back I tell him to follow me but be<br/>\ncarefull and watch your step, what does he do? He falls in again, lucky my<br/>\ngroup could levitate him and he got out, and I got his corpse so he was ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStill though, if you&#39;re fighting more than 1 monster, you better have<br/>\nmore than 1 healer.  An optimistic number would be 30 damage saved by<br/>\nusing this song.  How much mana does 1 tick of manasong regen?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just sounds like a disappointingly low effect for a level 47 song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Rokenn Swiftsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rokenn@...\">rokenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Remember though this effect the entire party, not just one person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rokenn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Dave Gaines &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave@...\">dave@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] RE: Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 8 Dec 1999 11:06:52 -0500 (EST)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I would assume it would reduce any attack by 10 damage also?
