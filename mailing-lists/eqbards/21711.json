She was 14 *seasons* old.  Now in a normal world, this could mean<br/>\nanything from 3 and a half (4 seasons a year!), to  a whole lot older.  I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s safe to assume from the generalized descriptions that the<br/>\ncharacter is not 3 and a half, but to assume that it&#39;s the story of the<br/>\nrape of a minor is reading a whole lot into the story.  Fact is, it tells<br/>\nme a whole lot about how the &quot;higher ups&quot; think - as Freud said, sometimes<br/>\nthe cigar IS just a cigar!  14 seasons could mean 14th level - and judging<br/>\nby the effectiveness of the poison she used, I&#39;d have to say she was at<br/>\nleast that!<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Double standards, Verant.  Or does GM Zatosia have special permission to<br/>\nbe particularly gruesome?  Frankly, if I were you, I&#39;d be sending that GM<br/>\nin for some counseling, or be worried about another Columbine in your own<br/>\noffices.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Intellectual property: If you truly want to force the issue, Wizards of<br/>\nthe Coast would be more than happy to discuss the issue of intellectual<br/>\nproperties with you.  Names are not the only thing that can be considered<br/>\nintellectual property, and frankly, you&#39;ve stolen a LOT from WOTC<br/>\nproperties.  Also, prosecuting ONE instance, while ignoring or encouraging<br/>\nliterally thousands of others is discrimination in the most basic<br/>\nsense.  You are choosing who to prosecute, and only applying the rules<br/>\nwhere it suits you. This is not fair to anyone concerned.  If you are going<br/>\nto ban someone for use of &quot;copyrighted materials&quot;, then you need to jump on<br/>\na lot of cases - not just this one that happens to offend your<br/>\nsensibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Derivative work: You are ENTIRELY off-base calling those stories<br/>\n&quot;derivative works.&quot;  Who is your lawyer?  Lionel Hutz???<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cordery.freeserve.co.uk/lionel/)\">http://www.cordery.freeserve.co.uk/lionel/)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n From the U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Circular 14:<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freeadvice.com/gov_material/copyright-office-derivative-works-ci\">http://www.freeadvice.com/gov_material/copyright-office-derivative-works-ci</a><br/>\nrcular-14.htm)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;A &quot;derivative work&quot;-that is, a work that is based on (or derived from)<br/>\none or more already existing works-is copyrightable if it includes what the<br/>\ncopyright law calls an &quot;original work of authorship.&quot; Derivative works,<br/>\nalso known as &quot;new versions,&quot; include such works as translations, musical<br/>\narrangements, dramatizations, fictionalizations, art reproductions, and<br/>\ncondensations. Any work in which the editorial revisions, annotations,<br/>\nelaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original<br/>\nwork of authorship is a &quot;derivative work&quot; or &quot;new version.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, these stories, while making references to characters in a copyrighted<br/>\nwork, are not, in fact, derivative works, unless you count GM Zatosia&#39;s<br/>\nheroin-addict nightmares.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, this was an unfair ruling, completely discriminatory, and far<br/>\nmore inflammatory than the stories ever were.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen are you going to learn to live and let live, instead of burning<br/>\neveryone woman with a wart and a black cat?<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
