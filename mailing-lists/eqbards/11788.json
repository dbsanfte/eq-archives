I have not actually used all my extra cha stuff since I<br/>\ngot my guise and that might really help.  I could try for a cha buff from an<br/>\nenchanter but if there is an enchanter - wtf am I doing the charming for? <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what seems to be the stumbling block for me is the weaving.  I have a<br/>\ncharm pallette set with charm and selos hot keyed and am getting better at<br/>\nusing it.  Even so, when charm sticks, it seems that I just barely have<br/>\nenough time to cast charm, cast selos and then need to immediately re-cast<br/>\ncharm (cuz it broke and they are both charging at me now.)  The duration of<br/>\nmy charm seems very very short.  I can barely charm, target mob, hit /pet<br/>\nattack hot key, f1-f1 retarget pet before it breaks and I am scrambling for<br/>\na re-cast of charm.  But like I say - I am getting better!  And I really<br/>\nshould try all my  cha stuff now - not just the stein.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have found that fear + chain is really good for soloing but it<br/>\nreally helps to run them in the right order.  I have been doing Avo&#39;s and<br/>\nCentaurs in South Karana lately.  I track a target and get close.  Then fear<br/>\nthem and auto-attack.  Now chain then fear again.  If I do this a few times,<br/>\nit gives me sufficient &#39;lead&#39; on the mob in hp loss.  Once I get a bub or so<br/>\nahead of him, I will wince him with Denons.  But once I go to 3 song<br/>\nrotation, I expect to take some hits.  Prolly should be doing: fear, chain,<br/>\nfear, denon, fear, chain, fear, denon.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I never learned to kite things.  I don&#39;t have the patience for those<br/>\nlong drawn out solo fights.  I much prefer to be in a party with good tanks<br/>\n- I don&#39;t mind melee myself if we have good casters.  So, I have not put the<br/>\ntime in to learn how to do solo stuff. I&#39;d try a couple and spent too much<br/>\ntime either dieing or zoning and then give up and go get in a group<br/>\nsomewhere or grab a partner. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJason Rochelle [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, December 14, 1999 6:42 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] RE: Simply Charming...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSylly, no offense, you seem to have trouble charming? (just<br/>\nfrom your<br/>\n\t\tpost here) One misconception I think many Bards have is that<br/>\nyou sing<br/>\n\t\tcharm, it works and you sit back and watch the show. This is<br/>\nnot true.<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;d say charm fails at LEAST 50%, maybe 75% some times. The<br/>\ntrick is to<br/>\n\t\tweave charm and selo&#39;s(with drum) so you can run backwards<br/>\nfrom the<br/>\n\t\ttargets and re-sing charm as many times as needed. During a<br/>\nparticularly<br/>\n\t\tbad run yesterday I had to sing charm NINE times before I<br/>\ncharmed my HG.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n\t\t35th Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
