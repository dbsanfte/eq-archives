By the time you get","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-281309980\">Continuously playing Pixie Strike is about the only way to interrupt a<br/>\ncaster&#39;s song unless maybe you are on a super-high speed connection. By the<br/>\ntime you get the data from the server indicating that an enemy caster is<br/>\ncasting a spell it is probably already 1 second into the spell. There is<br/>\nalso the little bit of delay it takes for the client to send your song<br/>\nrequest to the server.<br/>\n\tWhenever a group I am in goes up against a caster I usually just switch to<br/>\nsolid Pixie Striking. Doing this I can interrupt about 80% of the spells on<br/>\naverage, sometimes the caster doesn&#39;t even get a spell off.<br/>\n\tAs for your Mistmoore experience I have witnessed this. What seems to<br/>\nhappen is that, since the server is *way* faster than you in processing<br/>\ninformation, it has the NPC start casting the next spell immediately after<br/>\nthe Pixie Strike hits them (since they are most likely constantly being hit<br/>\nby the rest of your group) and the delays I mentioned above in addition to<br/>\nthe delay we have to restart the song results in them being able to get the<br/>\nspell off. Generally I only see this if they weren&#39;t in the middle of a<br/>\nspell when the last Pixie Strike hit them.<br/>\n\tLastly, a resist will not interrupt their spell. I have seen many of these<br/>\nas well. I grin gleefully as it begins to cast a heal, knowing that my song<br/>\nis well on its way, only to see the resist message followed shortly by them<br/>\nlittle blue sparklies. :/<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre, The Divine Alliance (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 05, 2000 7:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Pixie strike versus interrupting spell casters<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading on this board that pixie strike can interrupt spell casters<br/>\nattempts at casting a spell, I have tried using this song for this purpose.<br/>\nWhen I see the text message that the mob is starting to cast a spell, I<br/>\nimmediately stop what I&#39;m playing and start up pixie strike.  In just about<br/>\nevery situation where I have tried this, the mob is still able to<br/>\nsuccessfully cast the spell before the pixie strike goes into effect.  How<br/>\nhave you guys gotten this to work? Do you continuously pixie strike at the<br/>\nexpense of weaving other songs or is there a better way to time it?  All our<br/>\nsongs take 3 seconds to go off.  Assuming we start the song as soon as you<br/>\nsee the message &quot;mob starts casting a spell&quot;, we should be able to interrupt<br/>\nany spell that takes 4 second or longer to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, how long does it take for the mob to get a heal spell<br/>\noff?  My group was fighting glyphed warders in Mistmoore the other night and<br/>\nit kept healing itself, even though I kept trying to pixie strike it.  It<br/>\nreally irritated me because my strike usually kicked in right after they got<br/>\nthe heal off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, will pixie strike interrupt a spell even if the mob successfully<br/>\nresists?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n30 bard<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
