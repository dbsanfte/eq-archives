I&#39;ve found it<br/>\nincredibly unreliable compared to just Screeching, since our Evac&#39;er has<br/>\noften done far more damage or healing than Dirge by the time we realize we<br/>\nneed to Evac.  In the old days, even Lullaby would have been more reliable<br/>\n(ie, back when the resist rate wasn&#39;t such crap, and it wiped the hate<br/>\nlist).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example to the (unusually) low taunt of Dirge: we decided to blitz the<br/>\nSol B king room with full spawn, since we had an enchanter with us.  I told<br/>\nthem I&#39;d lead with Dirge as we ran in, which I did.  You&#39;d expect that at<br/>\nleast one mob would have rushed me, but all 3 latched onto our warrior as he<br/>\nran in (ie, he hadn&#39;t even taunted or hit anything yet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
