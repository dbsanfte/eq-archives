I just dont get making<br/>\nhigh level players perma-camp boss mobs in green dungeons for stuff they<br/>\nneed to go where they are supposed to go (keys for example.) But them again,<br/>\nit would be even worse if those dungeons actually had groups playing in<br/>\nthem.  I mean how pissed would you be  if your group fought for over an hour<br/>\nto finally get to the church in Kaesora and see some level 54 there soloing<br/>\nall the mobs while he waits for Xalgoz.  &quot;Damn, another crappy rogue poker.<br/>\nDamn, he dropped that crappy blade.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Mann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dabard@...\">dabard@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 22, 2000 8:24 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] RE: Bard epic<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGrats :o)<br/>\nOn a side note:  I was able to get the Quest Giver NPC to give me the quest<br/>\nthe other night :o)  I was afraid that I wouldn&#39;t be able to get him to talk<br/>\nto me until I was 45 or 46.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n44th<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
