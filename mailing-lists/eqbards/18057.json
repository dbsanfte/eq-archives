I may check out other views while running in a wide open area (like the Karana plains) or in an easy fight.  I use my keyboard for all movements, and to do most things.  I only use the mouse to target people/npcs when I can&#39;t use auto-target, and to switch between weapons/instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\n28th on The Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
