They, when selling allowed me to drive a bargain, usually 2-3p less than what was normal for each piece, then I would sell the leather.  I also sold collars and earrings to finance alot of this.  Remember Bards are a Social class.  The other thing I did to make money was Travel and learn all the zones, and spawn points from Qeynos to Freeport, and later on G. Faydark, by doing this I would sit in Qeynos and advertise going to Freeport or Beyond at Bardspeed, expert guide, get there Fast and safe.  People payed me up to 3p per head (average 1p per head) for the speedy safe trip. Sounds silly but It worked. And with /follow you can do it easier than I did.  This took away some levelling time, but it allowed me to finance the equipment to level much easier and more efficiently.<br/>\n<br/>\nJaezebel Bladesong, Gypsy Bard of the 19th Stanza        <br/>\nInnoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Michal Hobson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: EQBards &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Tuesday, June 22, 1999 4:57 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [eqbards] Cash flow problems</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
