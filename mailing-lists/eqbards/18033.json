I have<br/>\nhelped break the spawn several times and hardly ever<br/>\ndo we pull to guards. My point is that it doesnt have<br/>\nto be that way. The reason I stay in HK is that the<br/>\ninevitable deaths (see comment on not pulling to<br/>\nguards) do NOT require a long corpse retrieval run. I<br/>\nLOVE being able to be bound in the zone I&#39;m fighting<br/>\nin.  Yes there are some REALLY dumb ppl in HK, but if<br/>\ni end up in a group with one of them, I amazingly am<br/>\nneeded elsewhere soon...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and on bristlebane, KSing in HK is NOT ok. (It<br/>\nstill is ok at the orcs alas)  Anyone who pulls other<br/>\nthan their spawns and doesnt apologize and offer the<br/>\nother group the next spawn is ostricized and I will<br/>\nleave a group that is taking the ramp or the stairs<br/>\nwith out being asked by the group it belongs to.<br/>\n--- &quot;Kevin L.
