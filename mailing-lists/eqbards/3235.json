A violin can normally<br/>\njust play one note at a time.  However, if you get *very* good<br/>\nwith your fingers you can play two notes at a time.  There is a <br/>\nstory about Nicolo Paganini (an amazing 1782-1840 violinist) that <br/>\nhe once wrote a love ballad for a violin duet, however could not <br/>\nfind a partner to perform the other part.  So he just played both <br/>\nparts on the same violin at once!  (sounds almost impossible to me!)  <br/>\nIt is possible for virtuoso players to play three, and rarely  <br/>\n(songs must have special characteristics) four notes at once.  More<br/>\nthan four is not possible, since at that point your out of strings!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the progression of 2 for a professional, 3-4 for virtuoso<br/>\nmatches exactly ... I think of the ability to play multiple songs<br/>\nin these terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo-at-once:<br/>\ndouble-stop<br/>\n<br/>\nThree-at-once:<br/>\ntriple-stop<br/>\n<br/>\netc...<br/>\n<br/>\nSince my daughter is the violinist and I play woodwinds (which don&#39;t have<br/>\nthis technique), I couldn&#39;t help but think when my Bard first managed to <br/>\nkeep two songs up that:<br/>\n<br/>\nHa! This woodwind player can finally double-stop!<br/>\n<br/>\nStarling<br/>\nWorking on her triple-stop (but finger not likely to comply)<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
