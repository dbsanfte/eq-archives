Some only use weapons.  Some do both depending on the<br/>\noccasion.  Who&#39;s to say which is the right way?<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to melee unless a situation calls for instrument-only (like I need<br/>\nthe extra healing power of the lute, or the added MR debuff during mezzing<br/>\nwith the piccolo).  Whether anyone likes it or not, being a bard isn&#39;t<br/>\npurely about the instruments by any means.  As you grow up, you&#39;ll pick up<br/>\npieces of equipment that will radically change your playing style.  I&#39;m not<br/>\ntalking about songs, I&#39;m talking about your gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, when I got my harmonic dagger, I noticed how often it stuns.<br/>\nAnd it hits like crazy.  If I stun something 3 or 4 times a battle, to me<br/>\nthat&#39;s pretty worthwhile, since each stun is 5 seconds long.  A little later<br/>\nI got my breath of harmony.  Does anyone who owns one of these refuse to<br/>\nmelee?  Heck, it sings Niv&#39;s for you!  Those two weapons cemented my desire<br/>\nto melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last week I got another piece of equipment that changed my song lineup.<br/>\nBlazing vambraces of Fennin Ro.  They right-click a 9 point damage shield<br/>\nwith no casting time (jboots style, that can be cast on anyone), that stacks<br/>\nwith psalm of cooling.  18 point group damage shield now?  Wow, you better<br/>\nbelieve that&#39;s something I sing :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget that while I&#39;m meleeing (and making paladins jealous with my<br/>\ndamage, usually), I&#39;m also singing.  My opinion is that the percentage I<br/>\nlose on my songs by not using an instrument is easily made up for by my<br/>\nmelee damage, sword-based Niv&#39;s and dagger-stuns.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo each her own.  The best bards I know are the ones who are adaptable; the<br/>\nones who can change their entire playing style at the drop of a hat.  There<br/>\nare plenty of wrong ways to play a bard, but is there only one right way?<br/>\nNot to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaelrei<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And a lot of bards; granted there are a lot of people who LIKE using their<br/>\n&gt; weapons and more power to them (this is a game after all) - but I&#39;m amazed<br/>\n&gt; by the number of group members who tell me that they&#39;ve never seen a bard<br/>\n&gt; not using weapons during a fight (and I&#39;m talking at places like<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sebelis)...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
