That means if you&#39;re an all-around<br/>\njerk, you can&#39;t be banned.  But if you try to do something to<br/>\nthwart that jerk within the PvP- game mechanics, you can be<br/>\nbanned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI simply cannot believe that that is what they intended when<br/>\nthey came up with the policy - to keep the jerks in the game<br/>\nwhile banning the people trying to stop the jerks.  So I<br/>\ndisagree with that interpretation, and would say dropping a<br/>\ntrain on someone hogging a spawn is not a bannable offense.<br/>\nYou may have trouble convincing a GM that that was what you<br/>\nwere doing though.  Best to have many witnesses on your side.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
