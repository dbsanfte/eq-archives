Fact of the matter is you&#39;re correct,<br/>\nSylly.  By selling items on E-Bay, a real world valuation of virtual items<br/>\nhas been created.  In some states this would be enough to charge the person<br/>\nwith theft.  It gets worse by far though.  Because the theft took place<br/>\nacross state-lines, unless all parties involved live in California, there<br/>\nare also several federal laws that would be violated.  Imagine the scene in<br/>\nSan Diego were the FBI to burst into Verant headquarters with warrants to<br/>\nseize evidence in the form of computer log files, backup tapes, etc.  I<br/>\nbelieve you&#39;re right Sylly, eventually someone will take real legal action<br/>\nand actually bring something like this to trial somewhere.  The can of worms<br/>\nthis will open will likely shake the MMORPG worlds up pretty bad.  Every<br/>\ntime Verant fails to police this on their own, they accelerate the coming of<br/>\nthat fateful event.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to see someone who is a real life attorney or has some bucks to<br/>\nhire one go after these loot item stealers.  Subpoena Verant for the real<br/>\nlife name of the loot thief and file both criminal charges and civil suit.<br/>\nThat sot&#39;s local newspapers would have a field day with a story like that.<br/>\nThe thieves (and/or the farmer&#39;s) have established &quot;real - life&quot; value of<br/>\nthese items by selling them for cash on e-bay.  &quot;Your honor and esteemed<br/>\nmembers of the jury, I beg your patience in this matter but I must show you<br/>\nwhat grievous mental anguish my client would suffer if she were to have to<br/>\nendure another Ykesha camp.  Now this may take a few hours so get<br/>\ncomfortable and watch....And remember she had TWO of the items stolen!  OMG!<br/>\nLord with a Sword!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s only a matter of time before this will happen.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
