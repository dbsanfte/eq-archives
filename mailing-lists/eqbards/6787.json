You must have made this yourself because anyone trying<br/>\nto sell it would have been laughed out of Qeynos.  Last time I saw someone<br/>\nwearing studded was like 4 months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should ditch the studded.  You should at least be in mesh, it has the<br/>\nsame AC and is much lighter.  And get Banded Armor.  Banded is only a point<br/>\nor two less than bronze and it weights less.  I banked the few bronze pieces<br/>\nI had as they were too heavy.  Banded with a few mesh pieces is much easier<br/>\nto carry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you upgrade from Studded, come back and tell us how your AC compares.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
