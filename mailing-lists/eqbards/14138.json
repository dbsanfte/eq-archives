I <br/>\nam experimenting with a few different classes, but I have 2 bards at level 5 <br/>\n(started half-elf bard in Kelethin &lt;only place to start a half elf bard <br/>\nthere&gt;). I have 2 bards because I started a half elf bard first on the first <br/>\nweek of release and couldn&#39;t get any Medium size armour in Kelethin.  So <br/>\nthat bard tweaked (hehe a level 5 tweaking a level 1) my Wood elf bard and <br/>\nshe leveled up quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is if some folks find that they get bored on their regular server, <br/>\ndoing the same old same old, then try a pvp server.  I have decided to try <br/>\nto make an Troll Shadow Knight now.  His mission will be to kill casters <br/>\n(most casters are Human and Elf based).  He will be a sort of anti-PK pk&#39;er. <br/>\n  His MO will be to shadow step and hunt down those medding casters  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, ok....that is just an idea based on frustration, but it does add a whole <br/>\nnew dimension to the game.  If you have friends or guildmates that you could <br/>\nconvince to meet you with you on a pvp server, then you could watch each <br/>\nother&#39;s backs, and hunt PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s alike.  And be hunted :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now level 40 on Cazic Thule server, and quite sick of waiting lists and <br/>\nthe like.  I also have a hard time with the Hill Giants, because I get them <br/>\nfighting and some group or other will move in and kill em off for me :(   I <br/>\njust want a short diversion.  Nothing permanent.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else have a secondary character on the pvp servers?<br/>\n<br/>\nFflewduer Fflamson 40 Cazic-Thule<br/>\nAria 5 Vallon Zek<br/>\nBrushof SK lvl 1 Vallon Zek  (should he be a REALLY bad Troll and lay waste <br/>\nto medding casters?)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
