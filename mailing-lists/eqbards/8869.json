It seemed that clearing the Griffawns did help the <br/>\npoping of Griffennes and Griffons.  It is amazing what 2 35th lvl bards with <br/>\ntracking can do in a wide open zone.  Ziann had the biggest train of the <br/>\nnight (5 griffawns), but I found the most Hill Giants (5).  We netted 2 <br/>\nlambent stones, 3 Griffenne charms, and a Downey Feather for the Sharden. It <br/>\nwas a blast.  Going to get arms and a bracers (is Genni is around) tonight <br/>\nWoo hoo!<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\nMaster Craftsmen of Societus Argenti</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
