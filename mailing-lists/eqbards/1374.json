I was wondering about npc&#39;s with no faction standing (say a bat, or a<br/>\n&gt; wasp for example - I would also think even Mistmoore Gargoyles fall under<br/>\n&gt; this category), if you use the song on something that is &quot;ready to attack&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; does it make the creature &quot;indifferent&quot; or &quot;apprehensive&quot;?? Or does it only<br/>\n&gt; work on npc&#39;s with faction ratings? It would be cool to be able to walk into<br/>\n&gt; an evil city using this song, kinda like an evil enchanter could disguise<br/>\n&gt; him/herself and walk into Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that since it affects the entire faction, you SHOULD be able to walk<br/>\ninto an evil city and start changing their factions... but:<br/>\n<br/>\na) I have a suspicion you have to modify their faction before combat gets<br/>\nstarted, so for aggressive NPCs, you&#39;d better sing at them before they see you.<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Cities usually have many factions.
