It<br/>\nis not the problem with thin walls or ceilings as in some dungeons, but<br/>\nliterally an infinite affect area within the z-axis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far as I can recall, this problem began as a result of a quick-fix Verant<br/>\npatched in to prevent wizards from levitating , climbing a mountain and then<br/>\nnuking giants and such from such a great height that the giant could not<br/>\nfight back.  By implementing the unlimited z-axis, the giant is now able to<br/>\nstrike the wizard from the ground no matter how high in the air the wizard<br/>\nis.  Nice, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is also why combat in water areas is buggy, the z-axis of real space<br/>\ndoes not exist for mobs underwater, meaning in essence the same scenario<br/>\nexists as described above.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 06, 1999 3:22 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bellow and DDD/CoD<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wonder if our AE songs like DDD and CoD actually have a infinite<br/>\n&gt; cylindrical AE instead of a sphere around the singer?  For <br/>\n&gt; example, the<br/>\n&gt; infinite cylindrical AE will affect anything within the radius of the<br/>\n&gt; cylinder that is in front/behind you, above you (no matter <br/>\n&gt; how high), and<br/>\n&gt; below you (no matter how low).  With a sphere, the AE would <br/>\n&gt; be an equal<br/>\n&gt; radius from you in all directions.  I have always been under <br/>\n&gt; the impression<br/>\n&gt; that the radius of our AE sounds was a sphere.  I have also <br/>\n&gt; always been<br/>\n&gt; under the impression that the effect of the z-axis bug was that mobs<br/>\n&gt; separated from you by the ground/wall but still within the <br/>\n&gt; radius of the<br/>\n&gt; sphere were still affected.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone confirm this?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Heheh I can CONFIRM that it reaches all the way to the <br/>\n&gt; ground from the top<br/>\n&gt; &gt; floor of the birdhouse!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the zone is hvly camped and the spawns are getting <br/>\n&gt; actively pulled -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no problems.  If not, you get attacked by invisible birds <br/>\n&gt; (cuz they stand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ground and hit u)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; One half a but to 31 woo hoo!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you were somewhere like the aviak village in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; SK, you could even confirm how far the radius extended <br/>\n&gt; along the z-axis.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    150 SONGS FREE!
