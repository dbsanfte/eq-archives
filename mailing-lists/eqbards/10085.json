Hello Harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving never actually &quot;earned&quot; a piece of armor since level 11 (given a full<br/>\nset of bronze from a lev 48 I met one night in Rivervale and given a full<br/>\nset of steel plate at level 24 by a member of my regular group who got sick<br/>\nof seeing me in bronze - yes she is that rich) I was real happy to see the<br/>\nLambent quests.  I now have a full set of Lambent minus the helm - which I<br/>\nwill prolly get as soon as I can figger out how to deal with DW Gobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my Lambent was gotten with lots of help from other friends.  And I<br/>\nhave been glad to help them do their quests.  I been in lots of Grimfeather<br/>\nhunting parties and for that risk get nothing but the xp and the satifaction<br/>\nof helping my ranger freinds get their stuff.  Its fun to do thses things -<br/>\nespecially if you have a good group.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Lambent gloves were a gift from another player who&#39;s secondary&#39;s I guess<br/>\nI helped along the way.  I traded my steel greaves for Lambent ones to a<br/>\nguild mate who then gave the steel ones to another guild mate. And my worst<br/>\nenemy&#39;s primary (or really i guess it&#39;s her seconadary now ;p) gave me a<br/>\nLambent BP just last night - just because.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Kenross - I&#39;ll be gald to help you get some Lambent - gimme a tell when<br/>\nyou are on!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point I wanted to make is Bards really need partys.  To get their<br/>\nquest stuff and to go to the exciting places (Nagafen&#39;s Lair, Old Guk, the<br/>\nPlanes.)  First, these places require groups.  Next, to be survive-able,<br/>\ngood groups.  Third the really hard places require multiple groups.  The<br/>\npeople (who are competent) that plan Dragon raids or Plane raids - take<br/>\ntheir guilds   pretty much exclusively.  There are reasons for this - they<br/>\nknow how to work together & they have people that they can trust (for<br/>\ncooperation, skill, CR & loot sharing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me, that to be a real success in this game, and get to go to<br/>\nthose places, you need to learn how to group along the way.  This means much<br/>\nmore that the mechanics of which songs and stuff. It means making some<br/>\nfriends and meeting the people along the way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 36th Song<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kenneth E.

However, I apologize for the seemingly lack of<br/>\n&gt;   respect, but you&#39;ve got to realize I&#39;ve played this game<br/>\n&gt;   as a bard longer than you have -- and I hear all the L20 bards<br/>\n&gt;   complaining because the Lambent quests are too hard.  The fact<br/>\n&gt;   that they think they should get Lambent because they are something<br/>\n&gt;   special, irritates me.  I worked really hard for my armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic, Mister Know it All, Bard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Despite the sniping, you&#39;re both expressing frustration over the same thing:<br/>\nyou are both seeing<br/>\nplayers wearing Lambent armor at levels below those intended by the game<br/>\ndesign, and neither of<br/>\nyou like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the risk of sounding like my (&quot;when I was a boy&quot;) father:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was around level 20, tiring of wearing patchwork leather,<br/>\nfound-ringmail and a few pieces<br/>\nof ultra-expensive banded (the four Master Smiths on my server had a<br/>\nprice-fixing cartel), I<br/>\ncalculated that a full set of Banded Armor would cost me about as much as it<br/>\nwould to become a<br/>\nSmith, so I made a set for myself.  That was my first sweeping armor upgrade<br/>\nsince cloth at level<br/>\n4 and patchwork at level 8.  (I&#39;m a tailor, too.)  I am now level 33, and I<br/>\ndo not own a single<br/>\npiece of Lambent.  I intend to start questing for some next weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are not a twinked character, and you are level 22, you cannot expect<br/>\nto have Lambent Armor<br/>\nunless you have at least a few high-level friends.  This is irritating,<br/>\nsure.  (At level 33, I<br/>\nget pretty irritated seeing players in their teens with better armor/weapons<br/>\nthan I have, and I<br/>\nhave some pretty good ones, due to some friends semi-twinking me while I was<br/>\nin my 20s.)  But the<br/>\nfact is that you are playing the game as designed.  If it makes you unhappy,<br/>\nthere are things you<br/>\ncan do about it (joining a Guild comes to mind).<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t, though, you should take some solace and some pride in the fact<br/>\nthat you are making<br/>\nyour way through this game the way it was intended, by earning things for<br/>\nyourself at the level<br/>\nat which they are appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not that you &quot;don&#39;t deserve it&quot;; it&#39;s that the other players you&#39;re<br/>\nlooking at haven&#39;t<br/>\nearned it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 33 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
