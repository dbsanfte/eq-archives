Two ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-891078238\">At the insistence of my higher-level friends, who want me to get Level 32 as fast <br/>\nas possible, I&#39;ve been hanging around High Keep for several levels now.  Two <br/>\npoints of advice:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Don&#39;t bother to show up in prime time (7pm-1am EST); you will almost certainly <br/>\nhave to go on a waiting list to get into either room (warrior/raider), and it can <br/>\ntake several hours for your number to be called (and, trust me, people wait that <br/>\nlong).  Plus, the Keep is so crowded at that point that all of the spawns outside <br/>\nthe rooms will be camped, so you will be in a party of six with very few spawn <br/>\npoints under your control.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  At your level, you would prefer the raider room.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two advantages of HK are:  steady exp, and almost no chance of death (provided <br/>\nyou space the spawns out a bit).  I&#39;ve died a whopping two times in six levels, <br/>\nonce when I was bored and went out soloing, and once when the raider room dumped <br/>\ntheir entire room spawn on my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe keep is very small.  Go down the stairs to the bank, turn left, go down the <br/>\nnext two sets of stairs to the first basement room where people are fighting.  <br/>\nNothing there should bother you.  Go left down &quot;the ramp&quot;, the warrior room is on <br/>\nthe right, the raider room is further down the hall.  That&#39;s it.  Keep Selo&#39;s <br/>\ngoing in case you get whacked and by some fluke a room is not camped.  There are <br/>\nguards upstairs who will follow picklaws down into the fighting area if someone <br/>\nlets them run, so AE songs are not totally safe (but I use them anyway).  <br/>\nChain/Fear works swell, btw.  Just be ready to run if a guard starts hitting you <br/>\n(know how to get back out).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would estimate that you can pick up a bubble of exp once every two to three <br/>\nhours, depending on the group you&#39;re in (level 30 excepted).<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 30 songs (still), Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Be sure to say &quot;Hi&quot; to me if you come by.  I expect to be there until lvl 32, <br/>\nthen I get dragged off by my level 40 caster buddies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJames wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manickd@...\">manickd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Im level 32 now! Not too sure where to fight or what to kill. If any one has<br/>\n&gt; any clue that would be great. To be honest I know of lower guk, but I hate<br/>\n&gt; that place with a passion!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was told that High hold keep would be good in the warriors room, fighting<br/>\n&gt; pickclaws?  I dont know my way in HHK at all. I am on Innourkk server. Can<br/>\n&gt; any one show me the way there or another spot to fight? Or some detailed<br/>\n&gt; info :) thanks all........<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
