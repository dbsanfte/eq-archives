Targeted<br/>\none, conned blue.  Five of them, one of me, so I did<br/>\nthe smart thing, I charmed one then ran like hell.  My<br/>\nmotto to this point has been, if you can&#39;t be safe, be<br/>\nfast.  But for the first time since I got the speed<br/>\nsong, something odd happened.  At level 30, with the<br/>\nMistmoor Drum, I was getting hit from behind.  A lot. <br/>\nFor 30-50pts each.  That was a new and frighting<br/>\nexperiance.  I&#39;m hoping it was a bug.  Zoned out with<br/>\nhalf a bubble and a racing heart.  Anyone else take on<br/>\nthese little inviso guys?  I hear there&#39;s more stuff<br/>\nnow in our spooky liitle woods, can anyone verify.<br/>\n<br/>\nLlewrewnd Lynnhaven</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
