I suppose if you were grouped with a druid who<br/>\n&gt; could put a damage shield on you, and you played Hymn during<br/>\n&gt; your battles, you could use the whip&#39;s lifetap effect to<br/>\n&gt; extend combat long enough that the monster mostly kills itself<br/>\n&gt; trying to hurt you.  But the frequency with which it procs is<br/>\n&gt; not great enough to offset the low damage ratio.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
