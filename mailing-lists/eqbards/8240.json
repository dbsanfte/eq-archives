There is a group here who believe it is the enormous number of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; items<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ever growing in the character databases that Verant is concerned about.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By<br/>\n&gt; &gt; making them No Drop they were trying to keep the number of in game<br/>\n&gt; objects<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down.  An interesting speculation and a reason why it took so long to<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the bank set up to accept No Drop items perhaps.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tThe problem with that theory is that there&#39;s only such much any one<br/>\n&gt; person can keep.  8 characters x 8 bank slots x 10 backpack slots = 6400<br/>\n&gt; items, plus the items on the 8 characters, per account, per shard.  Of<br/>\n&gt; course this is exluding stackable items, but light-stones aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; stackable.<br/>\n&gt; Stackable items can only increase this by 20 fold, assuming that<br/>\n&gt; everything<br/>\n&gt; you owned was stackable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tBien<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tDid I type 6400??
