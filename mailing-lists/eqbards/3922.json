Perhaps with enough plate armor and<br/>\nbuffs,<br/>\n&gt; you might be equal to them but the best one? ehh, maybe (haven&#39;t seen it<br/>\n&gt; yet) but I will try to keep an open mind ;]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will emphasize that a bard MUST be in a forceful (and I mean full party<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; strong fighters) to simply play instruments. If the party has only 3<br/>\n&gt; members, a lot of casters, it is important to whip out the weapons and<br/>\n&gt; fight. However if you have rogues backstabbing and warriors taunting ,<br/>\n&gt; rangers, monks . . . . basically a coordinated group somewhat evenly<br/>\ntaking<br/>\n&gt; damage, I stand strong in my position that a lute healing 60 points (10<br/>\n&gt; points per group member) of damage per pulse (and remember this will<br/>\n&gt; increase in levels) is quite helpful and an efficient battle tactic (I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; TONS of personal examples).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However the topic makes me ask, do you think EQ should allow bards to<br/>\n&gt; specialize? For example Mr Tank Bard gets to have a better attack skill<br/>\n&gt; where Ms Luteplaying Bard gets a better string skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I for some reason have this strange image of a 250+pd tank who is<br/>\nconstantly<br/>\n&gt; getting knocked in the head, his fingers broken, with a lot of burly<br/>\nmuscle<br/>\n&gt; around his neck decked out in plate being a tad bit weaker in the musical<br/>\n&gt; talent. Whereas the little fragile bard who does nothing but play songs<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; try to avoid being hit, could just play masterpieces but fight wimpier?<br/>\nTo<br/>\n&gt; the best of my knowledge it is &quot;fairly easy&quot; to max out your skills in<br/>\n&gt; instruments and attack, no matter what your play style. I DON&#39;T want to<br/>\nTAKE<br/>\n&gt; AWAY the BARD&#39;s SKILLS. I just think that specialization might allow one<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; roleplay and create the type of bard they want to be, therefore making a<br/>\n&gt; more rewarding game experience. Possibly the specialization could come out<br/>\n&gt; in a year or so with the expansion pack when the bard is already 50th<br/>\nlevel,<br/>\n&gt; something to look forward to?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a thought, yea or nay comments welcome 8)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do WOMEN ASTRONAUTS have such BAD HAIRCUTS?<br/>\n&gt; What happens if you CLEAN your self-cleaning OVEN?<br/>\n&gt; The DR. has answers:&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.drscience.com/u\">http://www.drscience.com/u</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
