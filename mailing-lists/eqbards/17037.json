I think the main<br/>\nproblem with the bard class is the low skill caps.  I think a good deal of<br/>\nour difficulties would be helped by raising our caps especially on dodge<br/>\nwhich I am about to hit.  Making our Hide/Sneak work like rogues would be a<br/>\ngood idea as well.  Only bards and rogues get both as class skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nHide : Invis even on undead, cannot move capped at 75 I think<br/>\nSneak :  Will let you crawl behind mobs.  Also capped at 75 I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogues can do both at once to be invis all the time to everyone.  SoW&#39;d<br/>\nsneak is about like normal walk.  Sneak cannot be used with hide or with<br/>\nbard invis by bards.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Corey de Danann [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corey@...\">corey@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 29, 2000 3:08 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Forage gets better!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Corey de Danann&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corey@...\">corey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHey all!  Good news for those us who like the Forage skill!  I was happily<br/>\nrunning along today hitting my forage button as I always do, when I go the<br/>\nmessage: You have become better at Forage (41).  Yippeee.  They have raised<br/>\nthe skill cap on forage.  I had to log out before I found out what the max<br/>\nwas, but I thought I&#39;d pass that along to you all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLlyrean Daoine&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nBard of the 23rd Ballad, on E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!  <br/>\n1.
