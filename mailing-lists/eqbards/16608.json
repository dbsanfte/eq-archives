(8<br/>\nminute spawn). because of his damage shield he is the perfect spawn to<br/>\npractice all instrument attack on.  Pull him with Dennons Dischord, fight at<br/>\nhis front door NOT by the chimney (reason in a sec). If you can pull him<br/>\nbefore he casts his damage shield you can punch him as well, else just use<br/>\ninstruments. Often he pulls ahead at first but all but once I caught up and<br/>\ntook him. My combo was DDD,CoD,Largos Binding, Heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlusses:<br/>\nGood, consitant exp, 2sp-2pp, often fine steel weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinuses:<br/>\nCONSTANTLY camped, some mornings logging in at 3AM he was camped. My<br/>\nstratagy was to keep my Bard camped at his front door and play another<br/>\ncharacter until it was free. Looking for Aviaks while you wait is tedium<br/>\ndefined. On Povar people were very polite and would /tell when they were<br/>\nthrough, I also was offered to share the spawn, which frankly is a drag for<br/>\nboth, that is until we hit the next minus:<br/>\n<br/>\nGnoll, white to red at 25. Spawns outside walls near fireplace, objects to<br/>\nyour presence. This is why I pull from the side of the house next to the<br/>\nwall door and take him to the houses front door to fight. I have had him<br/>\nspawn in the middle of a fight and attack an enchanter sitting in the wagon<br/>\nwho mezzed and gated. Even when the mez wore off he ignore me while I<br/>\nfinished the hermit. Your milage may vary.<br/>\n<br/>\nmisc:<br/>\nSell weapons at the centaur village, do the winds of Karana quest while you<br/>\nwait for him to open up. Doing the quest will give you lots of practice<br/>\nasking Teir&#39;Dal necromancers if you can talk to the bards before they kill<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCrag Spiders, East Karana:<br/>\nMore excitement, longer downtime. Hunt the mountain to your left as you exit<br/>\nthe ramp.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso East Karana will have some Undead Reavers and even doggies that give<br/>\nexp at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nPluses:<br/>\nOn Povar it&#39;s a really friendly zone with lots of comraderie. Jerks usually<br/>\nonly passing through to South Karana.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinuses:<br/>\nA Broon droon Proon being kited while you are AFK.<br/>\n<br/>\nAviaks, Lake Rathetear.<br/>\nLook around for one of the lesser camped bird houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure there is lots more, but that is a start, good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
