In that time, I&#39;ve almost always had fantastic and<br/>\ninformed parties.  Even the parties where people have other characters that<br/>\nare HIGH (over 40th) level bards have never been a problem.  The average<br/>\nmaturity level of the player on Prexus is higher, they are just better<br/>\ninformed, OR I&#39;ve just been EXTREMELY lucky for 30 levels.  No one has ever<br/>\nquestioned me when I say that I don&#39;t get a song that helps mana regen until<br/>\nlevel 32.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe also it is my approach.  If I join a party where I haven&#39;t played with<br/>\nthe people before, I immediately announce my song line up and the role that<br/>\nI will play in different situations (weaving MR, tanking, buffing, pulling,<br/>\nlullaby, emergency chain, etc.).  Occasionally someone might have a<br/>\nsuggestion such as please don&#39;t charm because it messes up my nuking, or<br/>\ndon&#39;t lullaby because I mez, but for the most part I&#39;ve already taken those<br/>\nthings into consideration before announcing my song lineup.  I&#39;ve always<br/>\nbeen treated as an equal and never left out of the buffing or looting and no<br/>\none seems to miss a heal on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple times, I&#39;ve partied with another bard but usually they let me call<br/>\nthe shots for what songs each of us should be playing (you weave MR and I&#39;ll<br/>\npixie for example).  When we do find ourselves weaving the same songs, we<br/>\nquickly come to an arrangement of roles.  So far in my experience, there are<br/>\nalways more ways for a bard to contribute then there are bards in the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did get scolded once though:<br/>\n&quot;What happened to the Solesek Champion?  WTF?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Ooops, hit the charm hot key instead of anthem.  Sorry&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Take that off your hot key now please&quot;<br/>\n&quot;No prob, already gone 8)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA side note:  I usually always ask that any bard (including myself) only<br/>\nweave 2 MR songs when doing MR.  Missing a note and dropping one of the MR<br/>\nsongs can be to devistating to risk that possibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 30th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: scott brisko [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 07, 1999 11:55 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] utter fustration (but with a humorous ending) -<br/>\n&gt; OT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> (scott brisko)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Beside my bard I play about 2-3 other characters ranging from<br/>\n&gt; levels 5 to15<br/>\n&gt; and I find myself in many groups where I end up playing &quot;backseat bard&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; the bard already in the group.

I was in a group with a 31 Bard who argued with<br/>\n&gt; me - that he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tested it.  He tested it by timing how long it took for the<br/>\n&gt; casters to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; full mana after a battle.  When I asked if the casters always made sure<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; used up their mana - his response &quot;What difference would that make?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another case I was with another bard - and a Druid.  I asked<br/>\n&gt; the Bard why<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was doing Jig?  Because the Druid asked him.  I told the Druid that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t (the usual blah-blah-blah).  Her response (I can&#39;t remember exact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; words - but to the affect) - She had a 41 level Bard character - so she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obviously knew more about it than I did (I was level 27 at the time).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Pardon me for having a life!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Back to your initial complaint..  You were in a no-win<br/>\n&gt; situation - if you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried to point out their flawed thinking - you would have<br/>\n&gt; looked like sour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grapes.  Those people were especially ignorant - given that since Anthem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t stack - you couldn&#39;t have been doing what he was if you<br/>\n&gt; wanted to!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway - good luck to you - and hopefully you&#39;ll find better groups!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: G.W.
