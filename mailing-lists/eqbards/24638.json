I&#39;m impressed you have a raid leader who can be trusted to be this<br/>\nfair.  Even with our point system the melee (prime looters) often just take<br/>\nitems to twink with, forget to announce loot, etc.  If our old hunt leader<br/>\nhad been in charge of loot, OMG half of us never would have gotten anything<br/>\nother than throw down equipment.  Not sure it would be much better now to be<br/>\nhonest.

Plain and <br/>\n&gt; simple.  You<br/>\n&gt; just need to trust your raid leaders to be fair :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bards are a tough class to decide on loot rights.  For <br/>\n&gt; weapons any other<br/>\n&gt; melee class can use them better than us (since they all have <br/>\n&gt; dual attack),<br/>\n&gt; thus isn&#39;t the guild served best by having them go to the <br/>\n&gt; real melees.  No<br/>\n&gt; to mention, a portion of a bard&#39;s life he isn&#39;t even using <br/>\n&gt; weapons.  This<br/>\n&gt; definitly includes most large mobs, which really make a or <br/>\n&gt; break a guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Example:  We killed Wuoshi.  He(she?) dropped the Crscent <br/>\n&gt; Blade (a SWEET<br/>\n&gt; 1HS) and An Emerald Scimitar (very good ratio, but slow as <br/>\n&gt; hell, +100 mana).<br/>\n&gt; The raid leader (clearly) awarded the crscent blade to one of <br/>\n&gt; our warriors<br/>\n&gt; who does have his epics yet and gave the scimitar to a druid <br/>\n&gt; who isn&#39;t in<br/>\n&gt; our guild but id on at least half our raids (we have about 10 <br/>\n&gt; players who<br/>\n&gt; are members of small guilds, but might as well be in our <br/>\n&gt; guild for raid<br/>\n&gt; purposes).  However, the warrior was asked to give his lammy <br/>\n&gt; (replaced by<br/>\n&gt; the crescent blade) to me, since I did not get the scimitar. (then we<br/>\n&gt; discovered bards can&#39;t wield lammy&#39;s, heh)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A similar case can be made for armor.  Would the guild not be <br/>\n&gt; better served<br/>\n&gt; by having a tank with a higher ac?  THough bards do take a <br/>\n&gt; beating too...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However bards can&#39;t be totally shafted by loot either.  1.  <br/>\n&gt; No raid leader<br/>\n&gt; wants to shaft anyone.  2.  (at least on my server) Good <br/>\n&gt; bards are rare, and<br/>\n&gt; most guilds don&#39;t have enough (I go on raids with at least 3 <br/>\n&gt; other guilds,<br/>\n&gt; and we have a group of 4 bards who regularly join us from <br/>\n&gt; those same guilds.<br/>\n&gt; The 6 (2 from my guild) of us have discussed forming a union, <br/>\n&gt; hehehehe)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I like point systems and if I was in charge of a guild, we <br/>\n&gt; would use one.<br/>\n&gt; However, there is something nice about just doing &quot;whats best <br/>\n&gt; for the guild&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elfson Allegro 55 (WOOHOO!!!) &lt;The Circle of Eternity&gt; Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
