I did my first Vox run ever last night, and<br/>\nthe puller failed his FD and brought 5 mobs.  1 Priest of Naggy, 1 IG<br/>\nMagi, 2 regular IGs and a frozen terror, or something like that.  I tried<br/>\nalmost continually, and was not able to stick a single charm on *any* of<br/>\nthem.  My un-buffed CHA is something around 139, my level is 49, and<br/>\ntheir MR could not have been *that* high, as casters lower level than I<br/>\nwere sticking spells fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nOoh, and for anyone who likes reading &quot;I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t happen to me&quot;<br/>\nstories...our very last IG of the five (and a regular IG, too) was down<br/>\nto the &#39;c&#39; in his name, when *poof* he disappeared from the king room,<br/>\nwhere we were fighting.  Not two seconds later, we hear &quot;Cali!&quot;, and our<br/>\nwarrior is gone.  She had just enough time to say &quot;he is under Vox&quot;<br/>\nbefore she died.  I was next, only the IG had moved back towards us, a<br/>\nbit.  In fact, he was stading right over a polar bear trap.  So, I got<br/>\nsummoned, hit once, fell through through the floor, got summoned again,<br/>\nhit again, fell again...you get the picture.  I tried to /q, but it<br/>\nobviously did not work in time, as I came back to Firiona Vie. <br/>\nFortunately, I caught a tele to the mainland and ran all the way back up<br/>\nto Perma, arriving right about the time the GMs summoned my corpse (and<br/>\nall the other people who were trapped in walls and such other weird<br/>\nstuff, down in Vox&#39;s lair).  Needless to say, it will be a *loong* while<br/>\nbefore I try Vox again...<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
