I had never been, having no interest in<br/>\nwaiting lists and such. But things are very different now with everyone<br/>\ngone, I was in high demand *grin*. I joined a Throne Room group and quickly<br/>\ndied. Seems the healers didn&#39;t really know about Bard hate and the first<br/>\nmulti pull I got smacked. Had a little Come To Jesus Meetin in group say on<br/>\nmy way back, and after some group changes (including the Enchanter leader<br/>\nwho, if she had been doing her job would have been out-taunting me :o)<br/>\neverything went fine. Got 28th and a bit of safety exp (yay! Staff now procs<br/>\nChaotic Feedback!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was planning on going after an Obsidian shard next, but with reports of<br/>\nthe stuff being found in Kunark I decided to head there and see if I can do<br/>\nas well or better. Headed to Kelethin and bought Pixie Strike,<br/>\nthen....boarded the shuttle to Kunark. The boat, oh my goodness, all I could<br/>\nthink of to say in guildsay was &quot;um, wow&quot;. And, it seems it is possible to<br/>\nfall through the boat right at the ramp part, which I did *grin*<br/>\n(Accelerondo has some culpability in the equasion).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it&#39;s 3AM, I don&#39;t expect much in the way of official help. So I swim to<br/>\nthe shore and petition for help. I don&#39;t at ALL mind exploring but I was<br/>\ntired and just wanted to log out. However, I got hooked by the swaying of<br/>\nthe trees, the wonderful (empty) ruins and seeing a mountain, I did what I<br/>\ninstinctivly do in real life , I climbed it...to find a HUGE Iskar statue,<br/>\narm outstreched with palm up, clearly telling all who would listen to return<br/>\nhome. The sky seemed (er, was) close and I was lost in the beauty when ,<br/>\nGuide (or GM, I didn&#39;t check) Gourmand came to my assistance and summoned me<br/>\nto FV. *cheers* Nice fellow as well, which was great after my last Guide<br/>\nexperience.<br/>\nI camped on the docks, Ready to start my exploration. I can&#39;t wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo! Anyone have suggestions of where to go? I look forward to exploring, but<br/>\nI have no aversion to level specific spoilers :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, 28, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
