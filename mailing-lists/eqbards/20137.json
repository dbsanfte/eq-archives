I think it is easier to get them at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; live side, just dance right in (bring muffins, milk and bandages in case<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group you are going to be a parasite upon needs em) and ask nicely if<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might loot the gauntlets if they don&#39;t need or can&#39;t use them. On both<br/>\n&gt; &gt; servers I got them within minutes of arriving.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nope, no live-side issues. Took a swipe at a single froggie that attacked<br/>\n&gt; our cleric, he ran and didn&#39;t die while I was in the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How about this in the leaching catagory. The mask of deception, my<br/>\n&gt; understanding is that this rots a lot on most servers. I also see a lot of<br/>\n&gt; lower level bards with one. When I have 19th level invis song is it<br/>\npossible<br/>\n&gt; to get to the Assissin room (provided it&#39;s camped) and wait patiently and<br/>\n&gt; politly for one to drop?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Accurate impartial advice on everything from laptops to table saws.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/13/_/451022/_/962288274/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4634/13/_/451022/_/962288274/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
