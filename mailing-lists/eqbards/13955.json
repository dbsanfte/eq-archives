The ideas<br/>\nwe came up with to encourage dungeon crawling still work in<br/>\nthe above scenario - the L50s have to crawl rather than camp.  <br/>\nSo I would say that these are orthogonal problems that can be<br/>\nsolved separately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; You do have to share the mobs with other groups.

If there are 20 people in a dungeon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with 100 mobs that respawn every 30 minutes, then that&#39;s 5<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mobs per person per 30 minutes.  Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; camping one spot or sweeping through.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where do you pull to?

And what&#39;s the problem with not having &quot;any<br/>\nsafe rooms to fight in or pull to&quot; if you&#39;re trying to<br/>\ndiscourage camping and encourage crawling? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
