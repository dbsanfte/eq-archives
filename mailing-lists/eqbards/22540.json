I thought the animated version was ok, but certainly <br/>\n&gt; not of that<br/>\n&gt; caliber.  Gandalf is being played by Sir Ian McKellen <br/>\n&gt; (Magneto from X-Men),<br/>\n&gt; Liv Tyler plays Arwen, Sean Bean (Sharpe of the Sharpe&#39;s series) plays<br/>\n&gt; Boromir, Elijah Wood plays Frodo, Samwise is played by the Sean Astin<br/>\n&gt; (Rudy), Saruman is played by Christopher Lee, Bilbo by Ian <br/>\n&gt; Holm, Gimli by<br/>\n&gt; John Rys-Davies, Galadriel by Cate Blanchett, Wormtongue by <br/>\n&gt; Brad Dourif.<br/>\n&gt; The cast alone makes this an immense undertaking.  Throw in <br/>\n&gt; the fact that it<br/>\n&gt; will be three movies, one for each book in the trilogy and I <br/>\n&gt; think it will<br/>\n&gt; be very exciting.  more info available at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tolkienonline.com/\">http://www.tolkienonline.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Legba Work [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 17, 2000 10:15 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Dark Age of Camelot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t matter, it would be like so one remaking the white <br/>\n&gt; album, (or<br/>\n&gt; redoing Psycho, say...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I found the animated movie to be nearly perfect (I really love it that<br/>\n&gt; much).  Computer generated monsters will never be as scary as the Ring<br/>\n&gt; Wraiths were.  What are the chances whoever is playing <br/>\n&gt; Gandalf (anyone have<br/>\n&gt; a cast list yet) is as much of a bastard as he was in the <br/>\n&gt; animated version?<br/>\n&gt; And somehow I can&#39;t see being Mini Me (I forgot his real <br/>\n&gt; name) being as<br/>\n&gt; appealing as Pippen was...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ll see and again I hope I&#39;m wrong :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------~-~&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Create your business web site your way now at Bigstep.com.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the fast, easy way to get online, to promote your business,<br/>\n&gt; and to sell your products and services.
