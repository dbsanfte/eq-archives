The statement is ludicrous on its very face.  If that <br/>\nwere true, in a game dominated by the mechanics of level advancement <br/>\nand ability to overpower foes, then there would be more than the flat <br/>\n(100/14)% bards.  There are not.  It is not because bards are some <br/>\ngreat secret either.  Sure a lot of people don&#39;t know all that bards <br/>\ncan do, but that is because it takes far, far more work to play a <br/>\nbard than any other class.  Probably why I like them, they are much <br/>\nmore challenging.  Anybody can hit autoattack and the occasional <br/>\ntaunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone says Bards are overpowered, they&#39;re making a comparison <br/>\nof a well played Bard vs. a well played &lt;whatever class&gt;.  That <br/>\ncomparison _ignores_ that Bards are inherently more difficult to play <br/>\nwell.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>\nplaying the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>\ndifferent comparisons, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re saying, &quot;That&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and you&#39;re responding <br/>\nwith, &quot;That&#39;s silly, anyone can see that it&#39;s one of the smaller <br/>\nfruits.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
