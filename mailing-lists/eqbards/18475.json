They power game<br/>\nand they&#39;re darn good at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I think a lot of they&#39;re bad rep comes from a few bad apples. <br/>\nUnfortunatly they don&#39;t kick those bad apples out because they would<br/>\nlose power if they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey held one of the biggest server events I&#39;ve ever heard of every<br/>\nmonth (its on hold because of ROK).  Basically one week of a good vs<br/>\nevil war, the zones from Neriak to Grobb become a battle ground of mass<br/>\nPvP warfare, pretty fun stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere leader (Krimson) seems pretty set on improving their relations<br/>\nwith the rest of the server.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
