I d","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-411054842\">It&#39;s pretty easy to see why us bards would be rather pessimistic about another mana drain song since our current one has been said to be rather useless. I&#39;d admit myself that I&#39;ve never used the song.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose, however, with other classes having a mana drain spell, that in combination, it would be more effective. The only concern would be whether it&#39;s treated as a debuff, which would mean that our song wouldn&#39;t overlap with theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad Denon&#39;s Dissension wasn&#39;t more like the way our Clarity song works, as a pulse (which would allow for stacking) instead of a debuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d agree that the mobs in Velious would have huge pulls of mana to pull from, but if the fights are longer (since they&#39;d have equally large hit points) then maybe the mana drain could become more essential. This would be limited by how fast the mobs regain their mana as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell it&#39;ll give us something else to chew on.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Nov 13, 2000 at 08:49:19AM -0600, Mott, Mike J. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; \t&quot;NPC&#39;s have limited mana - they just have much more to start out<br/>\n&gt; with.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tAgreed!
