The first tick when the song<br/>\npulses, then three more ticks after that. This applies to Chords of<br/>\nDissonance, Denon&#39;s Dissension, Denon&#39;s Discord, Chords of Cessation, and<br/>\nthe three new Chant series songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI, a &#39;tick&#39; is 2.5 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other note, and this seems to be overlooked by a lot of bards.  The bard<br/>\nDoT songs stack.  2nd, 18th, 35th, 48th, as well as the single target Chant<br/>\nsongs, can all be combined.  With two bards, this is a very valid tactic,<br/>\nsplitting the load between them, greatly amplifying the amount of damage<br/>\nthey do in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nExperiment with and without instruments, I think you&#39;ll find that you can<br/>\nlive with just punching mobs instead of using sharp, heavy, or pointy<br/>\nobjects, letting your music do your work for you.  But, I agree, sometimes<br/>\nit just feels good to wade in there and hack and slash.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the real subtle benefits of the Bard class.  Each and every<br/>\none of your songs grows more potent as you level, and never becomes truly<br/>\nobsolete.  There&#39;s a situation to be found for using each and every one.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike pure casters, who generally receive an upgrade to an existing spell<br/>\nevery few circles, making the old spell useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 18, 1999 4:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Questions about lvl 18 song<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Fri, 18 Jun 1999, Keith G.
