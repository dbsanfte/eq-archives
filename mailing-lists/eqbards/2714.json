We appear to have gotten<br/>\nthe promised L43 song Desperate Dirge, and a L50 song, whose name I<br/>\nforgot to write down. (sorry) I managed to check everywhere but Erudin<br/>\nlast night so there may be more.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Dirge, it will also damage you as well as the monsters it&#39;s<br/>\ntargetting, so watch it if you attempt to actually use it if you are<br/>\ndesperate and low on health. It took about a RL hour to fully regain my<br/>\nmana after using the song.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe various chants supposedly had their damage increased, but at least<br/>\non testing on myself, it appears that it has actually decreased. Chant<br/>\nof Flame used to do about 30, 10 over 3 ticks. Now it appears to do 22,<br/>\n11 over 2 ticks. Also, Chant of Flame, at least, appears to be resisted<br/>\nso much that I&#39;m finding it questionable whether it&#39;s worth keeping<br/>\nloaded. Like many spells that have 2 effects, it appears that this<br/>\ndoubles the chance for the mob to resist the song, and in my tests<br/>\nyesterday, I rarely saw it actually take. It&#39;s too bad too, because if<br/>\nwe bards could lower fire resistance significantly it would allow the<br/>\nhigher level Druid&#39;s who&#39;ve been complaining that their only good in<br/>\ndungeon direct damage spells were useless to have a better chance of<br/>\nhitting too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Jun 30/99, G2 Dan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drockwell@...\">drockwell@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;G2 Dan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drockwell@...\">drockwell@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I recall seeing a chant of flame and a chant of frost in the Freeport guild<br/>\n&gt; last nite, all high, way up there, you&#39;ll make it someday level though..<br/>\n&gt; theres a few others as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Abhi Visuvasam &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abhi_1999@...\">abhi_1999@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greetings,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can anybody tell me what new songs the patch delivered<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the vendors?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
