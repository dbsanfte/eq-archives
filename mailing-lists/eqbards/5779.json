It was so nice to<br/>\nsee a positive result to an unhappy situation. I personally have not had<br/>\nthat situation occur but I have restarted from scratch before, and it was<br/>\nHARD.  Of my own choice at lvl 22ish I pretty much gave up all the items I<br/>\nhad and restarted building my collection of goodies. My reason was a good<br/>\none I think, and I have never once regretted the loss of my plate, or my<br/>\nwell balanced weapons ( HOW did I get them so young you ask? Well  I was<br/>\ngifted them by a more powerful player and without going into the details my<br/>\nhonor required me to return them) At any rate good luck to you!<br/>\n<br/>\nElyana Silvanae<br/>\nBardess of the 36th Chorus<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
