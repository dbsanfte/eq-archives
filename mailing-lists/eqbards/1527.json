The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1358980507\">The mana using song (And that&#39;s the one I refered to a while back) was<br/>\nplanned on being an AOE Direct Damage song, doing 400 damage to up to four<br/>\ntargets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe catch was, it used almost all the mana a typical bard of that level<br/>\n(42+) would have.  Since bards don&#39;t get meditate, even with Clarity it<br/>\nwould take a long while before the bard was able to sing that song again.<br/>\nEssentially, it&#39;s not a song, it&#39;s a spell, in the conventional sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy this restriction?  Bards are not meant to be nukers.  This is a last<br/>\nditch, use it when the chips are down, make or break, type of song.  At that<br/>\nlevel range, 400 damage isn&#39;t a whole lot, any caster worth his salt can do<br/>\nthat with a quarter bar of mana.  This is a way to give a bard some higher<br/>\nlevel punch, without drastically changing the face of the class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Brian Dickens &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:briandickens@...\">briandickens@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 04, 1999 9:00 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Mana for Songs?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: Brian Dickens &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:briandickens@...\">briandickens@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Was this change even implemented on the test server yet?
