Most rangers and druids have gotten a bit lazy<br/>\nwith snare and just snare at the beginning of a fight.  Unless<br/>\nthe mob is high red (i.e. you&#39;ll have a hard time getting<br/>\nChain or snare to stick), I&#39;d recommend Chaining for a good<br/>\nportion of the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk it through with the snarer and try it out - some mobs die<br/>\nso quickly it&#39;s not worth it, others you can Chain only to<br/>\nabout half hp before stopping in order to give the snarer<br/>\nenough time to snare.  Others have so many hp you can Chain<br/>\nalmost until they&#39;re about to run, and the snarer will still<br/>\nhave enough time to snare.  Once I figured out when I needed<br/>\nto stop Chaining, I&#39;d give a quick &quot;Chain off&quot; message in<br/>\ngroupsay, and the ranger would have enough time for 3-4<br/>\nattempts at snare.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, a 30%-40% speed debuff is not just equivalent to<br/>\nincreasing your attack speed by 30%-40%, it also means<br/>\nregeneration/Hymn and meditation/Clarity are 30%-40% more<br/>\neffective, casters have 30%-40% more time to cast without<br/>\nbeing interrupted, and you have 30%-40% more time to react to<br/>\nchanging combat situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
