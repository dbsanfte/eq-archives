Kim:<br/>\nJust to clarify what it means to &quot;buff without<br/>\nexceeding your mana regen rate...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSay each buff costs you one bubble. Say each buff<br/>\nlasts 60 minutes. Say you meditate back one bubble a<br/>\nminute. That means you can keep a maximum of 60 buffs<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many buffs you can cast going from FM to OOM is<br/>\npretty irrelevant since buffing is almost always done<br/>\nduring downtime. What matters is how many buffs your<br/>\nmana regeneration rate allows you to maintain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the type of analysis Verant failed to do (and<br/>\nis failing to do) every time they go off on one of<br/>\ntheir &quot;but bards use no mana!&quot; tangents. No we don&#39;t<br/>\nuse mana, but because of the short lifespan of our<br/>\nsongs and the (relatively) long &quot;casting time&quot; for our<br/>\nsongs, it&#39;s pretty much the same thing as using mana.<br/>\nIn fact, you can think of our songs as spells that<br/>\nlast 12 seconds, require 5 bubbles of mana to cast,<br/>\nand our mana regen rate gives us back 5 bubbles every<br/>\n3 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
