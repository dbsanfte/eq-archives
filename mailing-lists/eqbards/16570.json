I don&#39;t mind if Clouding gets an undead<br/>\n&gt;   invis component, but do not suggest another song be Invis V Undead.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not anymore!  Now that they have increased the radius on it, this song<br/>\nROCKS!  For 2 weeks straight I did nightly comando raids into Paw for the<br/>\nKisch.  Each time, my group of 6 got to the Tesch by using my invisi song,<br/>\nkilled him and then invisi&#39;ed around to all the other named spawns and<br/>\nkilled them too.  It worked fantastic.  No worries about someone&#39;s invisi<br/>\ndropping at the wrong time and with the see invisi component, this song is<br/>\nactually useful now!  Especially in Paw where there isn&#39;t a darn thing in<br/>\nthe whole place that can see invisi.  The only time we ever had a problem<br/>\nkeeping all 6 of us within the range of the songs effects were when someone<br/>\nfell off the bridge.... and in those cases, we all just jumped off the<br/>\nbridge and modified the order in which we took out the spawns that night...<br/>\nMy guild now looks at this song as one of those definative songs of the bard<br/>\nclass.  Something that no other class can do... reliable group invisi that<br/>\npretty much is guaranteed to never fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d LOVE to have an undead version of this song for places like Lower Guk.<br/>\nIt would sure as heck make life easier.  As it is now, we all carry around 2<br/>\nor 3 shaman potions in case Invisi to undead starts to drop early....<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
