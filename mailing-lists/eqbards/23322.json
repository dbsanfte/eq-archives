There IS still a secondary resist.  My experience<br/>\nin Sebelis is that it resists so much its worse than Charm as far as the<br/>\nneed for a heal.  At 52 with very good people my experience is still think<br/>\nyou need either a cleric or a shaman (slowing mobs) to do the crowd control<br/>\nin Sebelis.  With an mediocre group you need a chanter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a lot better luck in Karnor.  The mobs are low enough level difference<br/>\nthat the resistance is not as much an issue (at 52 - at 50 Pixie was<br/>\nresisted a lot) I was able to keep mobs mezzed enough to stay in business.<br/>\nHowever this was with a VERY good group - but we had a LOT of mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 22, 2001 11:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] OT Complete heal (was Numbers on Bards)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:51 PM 1/21/01 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yes with the RIGHT group (ie bard and shaman instead of cleric and<br/>\n&gt;enchanter) and four other people who are VERY good - you can go without the<br/>\n&gt;enchanter/cleric combo.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you don&#39;t have to have everyone be that good.  just the important spots.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My own personal experience with myself doing crowd control - if I don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;either cleric healing power - or shaman slowing power - I&#39;m going to get<br/>\n&gt;killed trying to do crowd control in Sebelis.
