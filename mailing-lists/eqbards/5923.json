One in particular is a great short cut.  From NK cross the wooden<br/>\nbridge and Zone into EK.  Then hop off the bridge and swim under it - swim<br/>\ndue West like you are going to swim between the legs of the bridge and you<br/>\nfall beneath the world but ad moved to a safe spot:  you pop out at the base<br/>\nof the High Hold ramp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tKimes, Dean W.

Eventually<br/>\nyou run out of<br/>\n\t\tterrain to stand on the back of and fall to the bottom of<br/>\nthe world.  The<br/>\n\t\tserver will then relocate you to &#39;a safe point&#39;,<br/>\ninfortunately in<br/>\n\t\tButcherblock &#39;a safe point&#39; is apparently several miles<br/>\nabove sea level.  I<br/>\n\t\tpromptly fell for 32000 points of damage.  And no, at least<br/>\nin EQ, you don&#39;t<br/>\n\t\tdie before you hit the ground.  Interestingly it did take me<br/>\nseveral seconds<br/>\n\t\tto hit the ground, too bad I don&#39;t have levitate yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOn a side note it was cool to see &#39;behind the sets&#39; so to<br/>\nspeak.  Made me<br/>\n\t\tfeel like I was in an old Hollywood western in some<br/>\nstorefront ghost town.<br/>\n\t\tIf anyone is curious and wants to see this send me a reply<br/>\nand I&#39;ll tell you<br/>\n\t\thow to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\tKitasi of somewhere behind E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
