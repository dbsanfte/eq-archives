The charisma hit was no fun,<br/>\nit<br/>\ntakes me to 98 chr, but I will probably strade a +3str earing for a +?<br/>\ncharisma earing and be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have about 400pp now (though barefoot :o) still have to sell the PGT,<br/>\nand<br/>\ntrying to decide on armour choices, I can&#39;t play a lot, and when I do<br/>\nwill<br/>\nprobably solo, so my money situation is not going to skyrocket, here are<br/>\nmy<br/>\npartially informed ideas, all suggestions are very welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nArms:<br/>\nKeeping my Barbed Armplates: (AC 7. +2 Dexterity), Steel Vambraces: (AC<br/>\n8)<br/>\nonly get me 1 AC<br/>\n<br/>\nBack:<br/>\nFigure I will keep my Lizardscale Cloak: (AC 8 + 5 to Dexterity), at<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n17 I did comedy standup (died once, lizzies do NOT get social commentary<br/>\nhumor) for about 2 hours at Cazic Zone until someone sold me it for<br/>\n80pp. I<br/>\nthink I made a third of that banking at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nChest:<br/>\nI still have a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic: (AC 12, +8 to heat, cold and<br/>\nmagic<br/>\nprotection.) which frankly is still nice for pulling with it&#39;s<br/>\nresists..but<br/>\nthat AC hit is hurting...so, not having 1kpp for a Brigandine Tunic (and<br/>\nhowever much for a Mithril) I am thinking Steel Breastplate (AC 17)<br/>\n<br/>\nFace:<br/>\nUntil my dream of a Mask of Deception dreams come true I am going to<br/>\nstick<br/>\nwith my bronze mask, I don&#39;t see a huge benefit to steel<br/>\n<br/>\nFeet:<br/>\nOf course I would love Dwarven Work Boots: (AC 8 STR+3, DEX+5) but<br/>\nthough I<br/>\nhave no idea what they go for I am guessing it is too rich for my blood,<br/>\nso<br/>\nSteel Boots (AC 8) seems the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHands:<br/>\nGah, I love my Elf Hide Gloves (I checked, it is no one I know :o) (AC<br/>\n4. +5<br/>\ndesterity, +5 Agility) but if I can keep my dex and agi above 100 I am<br/>\ngoing<br/>\nto go for Plate gauntlets (AC 9), or, I suppose, if they don&#39;t cost a<br/>\nfortune Shin Gauntlets ( AC 7. +5 poison)<br/>\n<br/>\nHead:<br/>\nI have a Blackened Iron Crown (AC 5. +5 Strength, and +5 each to poison,<br/>\nfire, cold, disease and magic resistances) but am thinking I would start<br/>\nsaving for the (Crested Helm: AC 10. +6 st, +3 char) or at least a Fine<br/>\nSilk<br/>\nTurban (AC 10, SV Fire +10) though, and I know this places me in the<br/>\nextreme<br/>\nminority, I *like* the Bird-Head look of a metal helm on a Wood Elf.<br/>\nThere<br/>\nis also a Griffon Helm (AC 10. +9 str, +5 agil).<br/>\n<br/>\nLegs:<br/>\nI am thinking of keeping my Barbed Legplates (AC 8. +2 Agility) until I<br/>\ncan<br/>\nget Silver-Plated Leggings (AC 10. +3 strength, +5 agility)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeck:<br/>\nAck, finally goingto give up that Spiked Collar (AC 3. +3 to Strength)<br/>\nand<br/>\ngo with a Steel Collar (AC 6)<br/>\n<br/>\nShoulders:<br/>\nLove the Bloodstained Mantle: (AC 6. +3 to strength, +10 magic<br/>\nprotection)<br/>\nand I am rueing the day I sold the Crested Spaulders (AC 11, +6 stamina)<br/>\nI<br/>\nhad bought for *80pp* of a hurried fellow in Freeport bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nWaist:<br/>\nSticking with the Thick Leather Apron(AC 8), at 26 I figure the Thick<br/>\nBanded<br/>\nBelt:(AC 8, +15 strength) is a looong way away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWrist:<br/>\nI have one Silver Plated Bracers (AC 7 +5 disease resistance, +5 poison<br/>\nresistance) I figure I need another. No real contenders here...<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapons:<br/>\nFinally, to replace my Dragoon Dirk I will start looking for an Obsidian<br/>\nShard (Damage 6, Delay 25, Effect of Obsidian Shatter)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith jewlery this should dramatically raise my AC and keep my stats all<br/>\naround 100. Am I correct in thinking that this is the best approach at<br/>\n26?<br/>\nAny hints on prices would be greatly appreciated, and would make a lot<br/>\nof<br/>\npeople on Povar happy because I wouldn&#39;t keep offering to trade them a<br/>\n350pp<br/>\nitem for a 1-2Kpp item *laughs* criminy that is embarassing :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any replies, I greatly appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Has there ever been any sort of mention why at level 26 you get<br/>\nboth<br/>\nScreech and Instill Doubt? Was it just bad planning and they figured the<br/>\nlesser of all evils was to give them at the same level? Seems odd...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
