I cannot remember if we covered all of these questions, and I<br/>\nhave missed about a week&#39;s worth of posts, so please bear with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI split the frenzied room in Lower Guk last night with Lament (to the amazement of<br/>\nsome group members, by the way, who said the frenzied _always_ comes - go bards!!). <br/>\nI am level 48 and the frenzied is only about 45 I think.  I have pulled Sol B king<br/>\narea; it is no problem with Lament.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not tried to split the Lord room in Lower, although it is quite open and<br/>\nwould be easy to try.  The King room is a different story.  Seems you would have to<br/>\ninvis into the room to get into a position to even try.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the group of 4 fire giants in Sol B - I know they cannot be mesmerized.  Is<br/>\nlament the same spell type and thus also not applicable?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question relating to pulling. John, you have used pumice extensively.  What<br/>\nis its range?  I hear it is quite large.  Now that debuffing causes a mob to aggro,<br/>\ncould you use the pumice as a ranged weapon with which to pull?<br/>\n<br/>\nComments and suggestions about pulling higher level areas are welcome 8).<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I felt sick to my stomach as I saw the second resist messages flow when I<br/>\ntried out Pixie and Lullaby in Lower Guk Frenzied area last night.  They seem<br/>\nuseless songs now.<br/>\n<br/>\n//Maravana Vireo of the Jus Divinum<br/>\n//Level 48 Bard of Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
