Great to hear everything worked out so well!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While we&#39;re on the topic of hardware...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you decide to buy an Intel P4, you&#39;re most likely gonna be happy...if,<br/>\n&gt; that is, you don&#39;t mind spending more.  Historically, Intel processors are<br/>\n&gt; more expensive than AMD processors.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And a bit more reliable (less out-of-the-box failures with Intel)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Additionally, if you select Intel P4, you will be required to<br/>\n&gt; also purchase<br/>\n&gt; a new type of memory (RAMBUS - if my memory serves...heh).  This memory is<br/>\n&gt; much, much more expensive than the typical memory you see advertised today<br/>\n&gt; (eg: $65 for 256MB RAM).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, RAMBUS is much more expensive, however, Intel is working with it&#39;s own<br/>\nand 3rd party motherboard manufacturers to get SDRAM and DDR SDRAM (double<br/>\ndata rate) mobo&#39;s working w/ P4, last I heard, expect them to be out before<br/>\nChristmas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The bottom line is, do your homework before you buy computers or computer<br/>\n&gt; parts.  Pricewatch.com is an excellent source, and I have the<br/>\n&gt; Google toolbar<br/>\n&gt; as part of my browser.  :)  Know what you&#39;re buying, and what<br/>\n&gt; your money is<br/>\n&gt; being spent on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, don&#39;t forget the &quot;arcane&quot; science of overclocking.  :)  With proper<br/>\n&gt; cooling, you can get an 800Mhz processor to 1Ghz.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both pc&#39;s I&#39;ve tried overclocking have caused problems w/ Everquest.  PIII<br/>\n600 overclocked to 800mhz, locks up after any 8 minutes in old world zones,<br/>\nany 3 minutes in Kunark, never tried w/ velious. AMD hrm...I think it was a<br/>\n500 clocked to 675 or 700 or so...would lock up on ANY direct3d<br/>\ninput/output.  Worked great if I never accessed anything using directx,<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Feel free to email me directly for directions to the best (IMHO)<br/>\n&gt; overclockers info/support site on the internet.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you try this, good luck, hopefully better than mine :)  (a friend of mine<br/>\nhas a piii-7xx(?), overclocked to 1.2ghz, plays all manner of 3d games, and<br/>\nloves it, he&#39;s also running 1gb of ram...and about a dozen fans in his case)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Atonal<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cook Miller-ETOP03 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:etop03@...\">etop03@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 25, 2001 3:26 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] New Video Card and more Ram - the results for me...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; See you in Norrath,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Piemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n&gt; Level 42 Bard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Congrats on the upgrade :)  Glad it worked out for you :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\nBard stuck on bar 40<br/>\nSolusek Ro Blood Tide</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
