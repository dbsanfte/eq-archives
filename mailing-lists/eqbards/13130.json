Please help me by reading and<br/>\n&gt;correcting my errors.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      First, some basic rules:<br/>\n&gt;      (Common sense stuff, really)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible).  While we do often stray off the<br/>\n&gt;path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the material &quot;of-interest&quot; to<br/>\n&gt;our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are acceptable, because Bards<br/>\n&gt;have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are not.  Discussions of<br/>\n&gt;Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt not to spoil<br/>\n&gt;someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put spoiler space<br/>\n&gt;(several blank lines) to let people know in advance.<br/>\n&gt;      Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person doing so will <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;immediately reviewed for warning, removal or banning.<br/>\n&gt;      On a related note, if you notice that your topic is straying from the<br/>\n&gt;original thread, please change the subject header.  Example: RE: Mistmoore<br/>\n&gt;Battle Drums becomes: re: Fighting undead as a Bard (was RE: Mistmoore<br/>\n&gt;Battle Drums) For those of you receiving the digest version, if you can<br/>\n&gt;make an attempt to change the subject field to something appropriate, that<br/>\n&gt;would help those of us not digesting our mail better pass it ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please<br/>\n&gt;be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read through, and then<br/>\n&gt;make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you simply MUST insult,<br/>\n&gt;badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old list-term for a thread that is<br/>\n&gt;being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when a thread has<br/>\n&gt;degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid for this list, or<br/>\n&gt;when the subject matter has become too inflammatory to be discussed.<br/>\n&gt;Kabongs generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5) No Attached Files!  If you wish to share with us your latest picture,<br/>\n&gt;some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply include a link within<br/>\n&gt;your email to an appropriate place online.  If you have no access to such,<br/>\n&gt;email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post it for you, and<br/>\n&gt;follow up to the list with the URL.  Small infractions will probably be<br/>\n&gt;overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our European readers who<br/>\n&gt;have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot; posts to a minimum, and<br/>\n&gt;try not to quote more of the message than necessary (although you should<br/>\n&gt;always make sure that the message you are sending is properly referenced,<br/>\n&gt;so that people reading the messages out of order are not completely<br/>\n&gt;lost.  And try not to abbreviate too much, or use strange &quot;slang&quot; or<br/>\n&gt;incomprehensible euphemisms.  Plain, clear speech is much more effective,<br/>\n&gt;and will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages...  Also, use spoiler headings and/or<br/>\n&gt;spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or weapon details.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Okay, enough rules.  Now for some Frequently Asked Questions!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, &quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;MM&quot;, &quot;GZ&quot; -<br/>\n&gt;What do they all mean?!<br/>\n&gt;A: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the EverQuest Glossary at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm</a> (shameless plug).  Briefly,<br/>\n&gt;those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do<br/>\n&gt;damage every few seconds for a while, instead of all at once), &quot;Direct<br/>\n&gt;Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their damage at once),<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon,  &quot;MM&quot; is Mistmoore, a<br/>\n&gt;mid-to-high level zone near Lesser Faydark, and GZ is Geoffrey Zatkin, the<br/>\n&gt;Verant Designer in charge of spell balance (and thus a frequently consulted<br/>\n&gt;individual when it comes to our songs....)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: What is &quot;twisting&quot; (or &quot;weaving,&quot; &quot;stacking,&quot; or &quot;harmonizing&quot;), and how<br/>\n&gt;do I do it?<br/>\n&gt;A: &quot;Twisting&quot; is the most common name (although much deprecated by those in<br/>\n&gt;favour of more &quot;period&quot; terms) for singing multiple songs at once - or at<br/>\n&gt;least making it seem that way.  The short explanation is to stop one song<br/>\n&gt;and immediately start another one, repeat as necessary.  Since most song<br/>\n&gt;effects have a duration of about 6 seconds, you have time to weave as many<br/>\n&gt;as three (and I&#39;ve even heard tell of four!) songs at once before the first<br/>\n&gt;wears off, gaining the effects from all of them at once.<br/>\n&gt;The long explanation, complete with illustrations, can be found here:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.erols.com/gww6e/eq/HOWTO-twist-bard-songs.html\">http://users.erols.com/gww6e/eq/HOWTO-twist-bard-songs.html</a><br/>\n&gt;     (thanks Tork@Nameless).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level?  What does this song do?<br/>\n&gt;A: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest Bard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;Guild  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)</a> has a list of<br/>\n&gt;spellsongs, however, most people seem to prefer detailed statistics, so let<br/>\n&gt;me refer you to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/index.html\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/index.html</a> (The Bardic Song<br/>\n&gt;Analysis page), compiled by Rokenn Swiftsong.  Also, the Soerbaird is a<br/>\n&gt;wonderful site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com/\">http://www.soerbaird.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;(Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: What do instruments do?<br/>\n&gt;A: Some songs have associated instruments.  Playing this instrument will<br/>\n&gt;generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is also related<br/>\n&gt;to  your relative skill with the instrument.  Also, instrument skill is<br/>\n&gt;partially responsible for failure rate of related songs.  To avoid missing<br/>\n&gt;notes, even when singing, keep your instrument skills maxed out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>\n&gt;A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the world.<br/>\n&gt;          The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found in Mistmoore), which increases <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;effects of most drummed songs by 20%<br/>\n&gt;          The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found in Mistmoore) which <br/>\n&gt;has no<br/>\n&gt;discernible special effect.<br/>\n&gt;          The Gypsy Lute (different from the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, in<br/>\n&gt;that it is for a specific quest), which has no known special abilities.<br/>\n&gt;          Brahm&#39;s Horn (found in the Gorge of King Grobb) which has no <br/>\n&gt;known<br/>\n&gt;discernible effect.<br/>\n&gt;          Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute which adds +9 DEX, +15 CHAR, +9<br/>\n&gt;AGI.  Found on the Maestro of Rancor in the Plane of Hate. (Shada - any<br/>\n&gt;known bonus to songs?)<br/>\n&gt;          Drums of Selo&#39;s March (Found on Cazic Thule?) which increases the<br/>\n&gt;effects of most drummed songs by 30%.<br/>\n&gt;          McVaxius&#39; Horn of War (unknown) which adds +9 INT, +9 DEX, +15 <br/>\n&gt;CHA<br/>\n&gt;and increases Brass song effects by 15%.<br/>\n&gt;          Minotaur Horns found on minotaurs in Steamfont and the Gorge of <br/>\n&gt;King<br/>\n&gt;Grobb are *wind instruments* (not Brass) with no known special<br/>\n&gt;effect.  They are, however, lighter than flutes.<br/>\n&gt;          The Lizard Scout Fifes are rumoured to be non-magical wind<br/>\n&gt;instruments, but this still remains to be proven. (Would someone please<br/>\n&gt;test this for me?)<br/>\n&gt;           Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo is a wind instrument.  Not sure if it<br/>\n&gt;has any added effect.  Found on Cazic Thule.<br/>\n&gt;           The Unicorn Horn (found in Lesser Faydark), acts as a Greater<br/>\n&gt;Lightstone while held, as well as a wind instrument. It also has 5 charges<br/>\n&gt;of Purge.  It does not have any discernible effect on songs.<br/>\n&gt;          Small Brass Trumpet which acts as brass.  Supposed to have a<br/>\n&gt;greater effect than other brass instruments.<br/>\n&gt;          There are other instruments (notably those on the Plane of Hate)<br/>\n&gt;that have yet to be fully tested.  I&#39;m still waiting on reports for those.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>\n&gt;A: Weight and cost.  Mandolins are lighter, but a little more expensive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: What&#39;s with all these instrument parts I keep seeing? (Unfinished horn,<br/>\n&gt;lute strings, mouthpiece, raw bamboo, etc.)<br/>\n&gt;A: Nobody knows.  Rumour has it, there was to have been another tradeskill:<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Instrument making&quot;, but nothing has ever been confirmed.  In the meantime,<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t accidentally buy an unfinished horn, because believe me, they just<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t play the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an instrument while<br/>\n&gt;swinging a sword?<br/>\n&gt;A: Unfortunately, no.  While instruments are off-hand only items, they are<br/>\n&gt;also considered two-handed.  Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much more fun to bash<br/>\n&gt;monsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; level?  Where should I<br/>\n&gt;hunt at this level?<br/>\n&gt;A: Okay - time to ask the list ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>\n&gt;A: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the screen you have 6 empty<br/>\n&gt;boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it.  This is the &quot;hotkey&quot;<br/>\n&gt;box.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your keyboard, but<br/>\n&gt;you can reconfigure that through the options settings.  Songs, spells, the<br/>\n&gt;spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made &quot;hotkeys&quot;. To<br/>\n&gt;create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want and HOLD it<br/>\n&gt;down.  After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and attach itself<br/>\n&gt;to your pointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the appropriate hotkey<br/>\n&gt;slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you press the associated<br/>\n&gt;hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or action in that slot.<br/>\n&gt;Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your hotkey bank is<br/>\n&gt;simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap items in combat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>\n&gt;A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General<br/>\n&gt;inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag slots will NOT) into<br/>\n&gt;your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with an<br/>\n&gt;instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever.  PRACTICE THIS<br/>\n&gt;MANEUVER!!!  You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at least once, and<br/>\n&gt;more likely several times, so practice practice practice!  And if you *do*<br/>\n&gt;accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and<br/>\n&gt;run like crazy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff class&gt;?<br/>\n&gt;A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, Master of None.&quot; This<br/>\n&gt;means that, while we can do so many different things (sneak, dual wield,<br/>\n&gt;pick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be masters in any of<br/>\n&gt;them, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 for Forage and 75<br/>\n&gt;for Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be incredibly good at these<br/>\n&gt;skills.  Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q:  Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana regeneration speed<br/>\n&gt;for your party members?<br/>\n&gt;A: No.  Here - let me emphasize that: NO!!!!!  What the Jig does is<br/>\n&gt;increase the rate of  Stamina Regeneration every six seconds and hence the<br/>\n&gt;display of the Stamina, Health, and Mana bars to show this<br/>\n&gt;increase.  Without the song playing the bars are refreshed every eight<br/>\n&gt;seconds.  The ultimate effect of this is that the mana bar &quot;moves&quot; every<br/>\n&gt;six seconds instead of every eight seconds so it APPEARS to be moving<br/>\n&gt;FASTER.  In actuality - it is moving 75% of the distance it would move if<br/>\n&gt;it waiting the other two seconds.  So bottom line, it LOOKS like it is<br/>\n&gt;regenerating faster but it does not.  If you don&#39;t otherwise have a need to<br/>\n&gt;regenerate stamina, you are wasting a memorized song slot.  Or you can just<br/>\n&gt;use GZ&#39;s short answer: &quot;Urban Myth - Jig only gives fatigue back.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(Geoffrey Zatkin, Archmage of Norrath [And Verant Game-designer], November<br/>\n&gt;18, 1999, in a letter to Rokenn Swiftsong)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of <br/>\n&gt;Clarity)?<br/>\n&gt;A: &quot;There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an icon<br/>\n&gt;on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>\n&gt;seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - this<br/>\n&gt;means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep the<br/>\n&gt;song effect going indefinitely.<br/>\n&gt;Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the<br/>\n&gt;Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again.<br/>\n&gt;Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it<br/>\n&gt;does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your screen.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(Geoffrey Zatkin, December 2, 1999, in &quot;Arch Mage Answers&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html</a> )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q. Why can I never gain any experience in 2-handed slash or 2-handed blunt?<br/>\n&gt;A. Although Bards have these skills, and even though they appear on the<br/>\n&gt;trainer, you can never train 2-handed skills as a Bard.  This is apparently<br/>\n&gt;a piece of virtual duct-tape to allow GMs and Guides to play Bards and<br/>\n&gt;still wield 2-handed equipment (like their special staff).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q. What are the most important stats as a Bard?<br/>\n&gt;A. Well, because no matter what I answer, someone will disagree with me, I<br/>\n&gt;will say this:  No matter what your starting stats, odds are, you will<br/>\n&gt;eventually be able to balance any deficiencies out with magic items and<br/>\n&gt;jewelry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Q: Why are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 49?<br/>\n&gt;A: &quot;When we was [sic] finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave some<br/>\n&gt;room for expansion during the evolution of EverQuest.  Because Bards get<br/>\n&gt;one song per level, if we had given them all fifty songs there would have<br/>\n&gt;been no room for expansion - aside from taking away older songs.<br/>\n&gt;Expect to see new songs coming soon.  These songs will not be anything that<br/>\n&gt;radically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions that help<br/>\n&gt;keep the Bard interesting at high levels.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;(Geoffrey Zatkin, November 15, 1999, in &quot;Arch Mage Answers&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html</a> )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Okay, well, this FAQ is pretty long as it is - and I&#39;ve run out of<br/>\n&gt;ideas.
