Guildsay and /who are all telepathic powers that all","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1993640785\">I don&#39;t mean to criticize one person&#39;s view of Roleplay - but I think you<br/>\nhave limited your imagination...<br/>\n<br/>\nGuildsay and /who are all telepathic powers that all Sentient beings on<br/>\nNorrath have innately.  When you swear a blood oath to someone (the<br/>\nGuildmaster) you have the ability to communicate telepathically with him (or<br/>\nher) and everyone else who has sword a blood Oath to that person.  This<br/>\nblood oath is more powerful than Religion and Race.  Roleplaying this could<br/>\nrequire a ritual before the /guildinvite is issued.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwitching Characters can also be explained.  In Norrath one has a Soul that<br/>\ntranscends the physical body.  The Soul can only posses one being at a time.<br/>\nAn individual is aware of the other beings his (or her) Soul Posses and has<br/>\nthe power to choose which to posses at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome hard-core roleplayers may reject these and call them rationalizations<br/>\nand I respect their point-of-view.  But I don&#39;t see them as mutually<br/>\nexclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Computer Game is limited by the technology.  There are so many things that<br/>\nare possible in a TRUE RP setting (i.e. paper-and-pencil RPG) that are<br/>\nimpossible in a Computer RPG.  These elements I would argue are necessary<br/>\nfor the game to work and be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever - things like &quot;1 more bub to level!)  I&#39;m getting 20 percent package<br/>\nloss!  I&#39;ll be on at 10:00 PM Central Time?  How was your vacation&quot;?  I can<br/>\nsee RP&#39;ers not wanting to hear those...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Elijah Meeker [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emeeker@...\">emeeker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 27, 2000 8:35 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] new guild and new server?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well I&#39;d love to have you on Tunare, but the guild I&#39;m in<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t RP enough.<br/>\n&gt; Still if you do move to Tunare, give me a tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have pondered what I see as an anti-RP pressure in EQ a lot. I think it is<br/>\nbecause the game itself requires so much logistics discussion. Logistics can<br/>\nbe diffcult enough when you are exchanging raw data much less gussying it<br/>\nup, and so  people tend to be dirrect, which tends to sound pretty OOC.<br/>\nGuildsay also breaks the RP framework, because there is no premise at all of<br/>\nsharing a physical (okay virtual Phisical) location. How do you RP for more<br/>\nthan a short span when one person is in the Field of bone as an Iksar and<br/>\nanother in LGuk as a High Elf? Then add that the High Elf wants the Iksar<br/>\nplayer to quit playing a secondary and come help... Not that it isn&#39;t<br/>\npossible to counter the effect, just that it is hard work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
