Fights are far too small in sample size individually for the<br/>\nwhole&#39;s difference to hold true unless it is large.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample I did run through.  20 fights vs blue aviaks with a ranger of equal<br/>\nlevel.  I out damaged him on one fight.  Odds say that would mean I was 25%<br/>\nbehind him assuming a sample size ration that was present, 20-1.  It was<br/>\nclose, he did 33% more damage than I did.

Although they normally outperform you, the random<br/>\nnumber generator gave them a few really bad rolls.  That&#39;s the only way<br/>\nyou&#39;d ever be able to outdamage someone who generally outdamages you.<br/>\nThat&#39;s where the &quot;20% over 50 fights&quot; (the exact numbers are hypothetical,<br/>\nof course) comes from.  As the duration of the test sample (ie, the more<br/>\nrounds of combat), the damage dealt falls more inline with what was<br/>\nexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you&#39;re correct on the level difference contributing to the skew.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nnoticed melee damage depends on the level difference between myself and the<br/>\nmob.  For the test to be most accurate, you&#39;ll need a partner that&#39;s the<br/>\nsame level, with the same weapon and weapon skill.  Since the SK would use a<br/>\n2H, that one&#39;s gonna be harder to test... John?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;d LOVE to see the logs if you perform this test.  It&#39;s something<br/>\nI&#39;ve been meaning to do with a warrior friend, once he hits 50 (almost<br/>\nthere).<br/>\n<br/>\nRaiel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!  <br/>\n1.
