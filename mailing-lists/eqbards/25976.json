Figures they <br/>\nwould not put in any effort to make the damage portion of our songs <br/>\nstack w/o having the debuff portion stack.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone had a chance to yet locate the new level 58 song?  The patch <br/>\nmessage makes it look like it will be a quest??<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder off what uber mob the ancient songs will drop.  Lcea <br/>\nwould be the logical candidate but she doesn&#39;t seem to be difficult <br/>\nenough for a mob to drop ancient songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosha &quot;Spellsinger&quot; Cristi<br/>\nLvl 60<br/>\nInnoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
