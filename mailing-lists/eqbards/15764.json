I heard they used to<br/>\n  drop a lot more often but this is absurd.  Yesterday I logged on at 11am CST<br/>\n  in lguk and joined a Savant group, sent a tell to the list holder of the<br/>\n  Lord group and started killing frogs.  I was finally called for my turn in<br/>\n  the Lord group at 6pm CST, 7 hours later.  Shortly after I arrived one of<br/>\n  the people ahead of me on the list fell asleep after an 18 hour camp and the<br/>\n  guy after him got a Yak.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The group changed a couple times in the next hour so by 8pm I was on the top<br/>\n  of the list for a Yak, 2 hours after joining the group.  We then camped the<br/>\n  room and I finally gave up with no Yak (5 SSB&#39;s) at 2:30am, 7 and a half<br/>\n  hours and no Yak.  By the time I left I was the only original group member<br/>\n  left.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Meanwhile people continue to berate me for wielding a staff of writhing at<br/>\n  42nd level.  What&#39;s a bard to do, has it always been this tough of a camp?<br/>\n  This is totally absurd.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Faras<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
