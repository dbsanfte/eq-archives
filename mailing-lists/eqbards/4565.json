The two high lvl <br/>\n&gt; nukers pretty<br/>\n&gt; much ate the lord up quickly and then the two boks that where <br/>\n&gt; left where<br/>\n&gt; easy prey. well not easy but we did it :). However, if the <br/>\n&gt; guk knight would<br/>\n&gt; have spawned, we probably wouldnt have even attempted it. However, an<br/>\n&gt; enchanter of lvl 45+ just makes this a whole heckuva lot <br/>\n&gt; easier, and you<br/>\n&gt; really cant go wrong with two groups :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
