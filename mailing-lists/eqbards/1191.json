First of all, how <br/>\n&gt;exactly do you drink the alcohol you purchase?  I know it is a silly <br/>\n&gt;question but I have never tried before.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You right click on it while it is in your inventory. I don&#39;t remember if it <br/>\nHAS to be in your main inventory or if it can be in a container.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Secondly, being lvl 5, I just got my Selo&#39;s song and purchased a drum.  <br/>\n&gt;However, every time I equip the drum and attempt to play the song, it tells <br/>\n&gt;me to stick to singing until I learn the instrument.  Is it a thing you can <br/>\n&gt;practice at the guild?  The missed note got me stomped by a hill giant <br/>\n&gt;yesterday.  Do they always attack on sight?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have to go to your guild and train at least 1 point into percussion. <br/>\nMatter of fact, ANY time you get a new skill (dual-wield, strings, dodge, <br/>\netc..) you&#39;ll want to do this. And yes, homers KOS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thirdly, where is a good place to hunt at lvl 5-10?  I tried to go to the <br/>\n&gt;second zone out of Freeport and all there was were Kodiaks, young Kodiaks, <br/>\n&gt;and of course my friend the giant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well there are plenty of things to hunt in either of the commons zones, but <br/>\nboth hold some potentially lethal creatures (griffons come to mind <br/>\nimmediately). You could also try North Ro. I also found that Kithicor was a <br/>\ngreat place to hunt if you go past the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Bear with us newbies, I realize that most of the people that respond on <br/>\n&gt;this list are anywhere from lvl 18-50, but you have the stories and the <br/>\n&gt;knowledge to pass down through your posts.  Its very much like an extension <br/>\n&gt;of the game.  That is what we as bard&#39;s do for a living!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Everyone was a newbie at least once and has needed help at one time or <br/>\nanother! =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 11th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
