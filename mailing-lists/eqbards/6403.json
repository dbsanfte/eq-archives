I still get nervous when traveling<br/>\ndown that &^%$&^% ramp.  For the record, I made it through high-hold 15 or<br/>\n20 times before I went on my dying streak.  For some reason, I kept running<br/>\ninto those bandits, just opposite the keep.  Took me a LONG time to get<br/>\nstraightened out on what path to take out of there.  after about 6 or 8<br/>\ndeaths, I quit going that way, and usually go through<br/>\nrivervale,misty,runnyeye,gorge to east k.  And I usually wander through<br/>\nmisty, giving some newbies a bit of help on the way.
