Master Bard lady in freeport has granted me my 15th song.  Now to just find it.. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading the success of many on here.  It&#39;s great to read all the info about songs, hunting grounds, and so forth and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I&#39;ve been trying to juggle my songs when I&#39;m grouped with my darling husband Shaeloren (warrior).  I hardly even use bellow until there at the end if it&#39;s needed.. i.e. when Shae&#39;s health is low and i&#39;m tanking while he heals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI seem to use str,heal,and bellows the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut mostly the str&heal part.  I feel like i&#39;m cheating myself here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got everything set up on hot keys..so it&#39;s easy to swithch.. weapon,songs,instruments..  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am no strategist(sp?) by any means... I mean, I discovered by boo boo that i could juggle songs.. eh<br/>\nShae tries to help me work out which songs do us good for battles..but he&#39;s no bard.. and having him sit right beside me and he pops up..Use such in such.. well.. i&#39;ve bitten him a few times with some piercing looks.. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nhe&#39;s decided to let me play my bard the way I want to.  I love Tel.. I&#39;ve been every race,class there can be.  I love my WElf Bard lady! =)  But, Like I said Strategy is not my field.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShae can lay down plots and what and how we can do and will do things easily.  (thanks to uncle sam)..=)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I make any sense?  Oh I hope so! hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Bard signing off!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAngelfire for your free web-based e-mail. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com\">http://www.angelfire.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
