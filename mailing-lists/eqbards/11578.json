On a few<br/>\noccasions, I was about to close the sale when high level twinking their<br/>\nsub-level 10 bard would sweep in and give an outrageous offer for 100pp<br/>\nplus.  I&#39;ve always been of the opinion that if they want to pay that much,<br/>\nthen more power to them, but I&#39;m not paying that much.  I&#39;m just hoping<br/>\nthose idiots will be around when all the bards I know have lambent and I&#39;m<br/>\nfarming SG&#39;s...  Of course if it is a bard asking for the stone off the SG I<br/>\njust killed, when then I say give to him/her for free :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran Dreamweaver<br/>\n&lt;Clan Jax&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 30th song<br/>\nPrexus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Roach [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.roach@...\">mike.roach@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 09, 1999 9:35 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Lambent Stones on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.roach@...\">mike.roach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a problem with obtaining lambent stones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m running around NRo/Oasis/SRo regularly now and shouting out<br/>\n&gt; for lambent<br/>\n&gt; stones assuming people will be cool and just give them to the<br/>\n&gt; poor bard who<br/>\n&gt; needs them for his armor quest like most people do with all the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the<br/>\n&gt; no-drop quest components for all the other classes.  I assumed wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying<br/>\n&gt; to cash in<br/>\n&gt; on lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>\n&gt; cheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>\n&gt; saying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>\n&gt; refuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent<br/>\n&gt; over 1000pp<br/>\n&gt; purchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not<br/>\n&gt; going to hand<br/>\n&gt; some greedy bugger more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Soooo, I am now camping SG&#39;s in oasis every opportunity I can but<br/>\n&gt; I killed 4<br/>\n&gt; last night and did not find a single one.  I am joining pickup groups for<br/>\n&gt; the purpose of giant hunting and I often have to convince my group members<br/>\n&gt; that they should let me loot a stone should we find one.  I just don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still need about 7 lambent stones total for the rest of my<br/>\n&gt; armor and I am<br/>\n&gt; certainly not willing to pay another 200-1000pp to obtain them, I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; have that kind of money anymore after buying the other components.  But I<br/>\n&gt; have been looking for my next stone for 4 in-game days now and<br/>\n&gt; have killed 5<br/>\n&gt; giants and am still empty-handed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations apart from soloing in<br/>\n&gt; the Rathe mts and charming giants to kill each other?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Faras<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
