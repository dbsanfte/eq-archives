DEX is important for bards, but not for other melee classes<br/>\nunless they have procing weapons.  AGI is good to a point, around 100, but<br/>\nafter that the increase in AC is not as large as just getting good AC items<br/>\nthemselves.  the rogues, monks, and warriors are all swapping out items for<br/>\nAC and STR.  they are picking jagged bands over fire emerald plat rings, for<br/>\nexample.  a favorite of the monks are plat fire opal rings, 5AC 55hp.  they<br/>\nare getting away from player made jewelery, which for the most part has no<br/>\nAC but only stats.  i&#39;m thinking of messing around with this a little<br/>\nmyself, as with 147 STR, 149 DEX, and 119 AGI i have room to play with.  i<br/>\nam going to go for some more CHA and AC, my CHA is a pitiful 103 (i&#39;m coming<br/>\nover to the good side, Harm).  i fear i may go into a seizure if my STR goes<br/>\nunder 140, but i&#39;m going to risk it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\nTyria Sarkin, L36 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Weiland Spellsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail and well met everyone!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One question today:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My guildmates, namely 2 monks, 2 paladins, and our resident <br/>\n&gt; rogue have begun formulating a rather distressing theory of <br/>\n&gt; late.  They seem to all be of the opinion that the only real <br/>\n&gt; stats that matter are AC and STR (and agility for the monks). <br/>\n&gt;  Now before anyone begins to think these people are soft in <br/>\n&gt; the head, these are all very intelligent players.  The monks <br/>\n&gt; are 30 and 38 respectively, the paladins are 33 and 35, and <br/>\n&gt; the rogue (the guild&#39;s most valuable asset by far) just <br/>\n&gt; chimed hell level one (30) last night.  Can their theory be <br/>\n&gt; right? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
