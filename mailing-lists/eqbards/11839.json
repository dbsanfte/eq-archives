Maybe it&#39;s the skill that<br/>\nneeds to improve (when you first get a brass song) or they actually have<br/>\nsome code that bases resists on how old the song is?  Also the level of the<br/>\nsong compared to the mob?   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut yes - I use the earliest songs when I want the least resists. And<br/>\nperhaps the mobs are more resistant to the type of magic of the newer song<br/>\nthan the older one?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have been a bad bard &lt;tsk tsk&gt; lev 37 and 38 songs are waiting for me<br/>\nin the bard guild still.  Not like the old days where you really looked<br/>\nforward to making a level and getting a good song.  &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.<br/>\n<br/>\nHI HARM!!!!!
