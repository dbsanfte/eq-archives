According to Verant&#39;s own definitions all Melee classes have Dual<br/>\nWield.<br/>\nIn fact, of melee and hybrid&#39;s only Paladins and Shadowknights don&#39;t have<br/>\ndual wield.  This is a totally bogus excuse for changing this spell.  This<br/>\nis another in a long line of ridiculous comments from VI.  When was the last<br/>\ntime you heard somebody at level 50+ desire a ranger in a group over a<br/>\npaladin?<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>\nof Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s <br/>\ncurrent function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>\ndesirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>\nduration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>\nvalue decreased.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
