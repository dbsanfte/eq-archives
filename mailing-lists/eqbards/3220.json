At a<br/>\n&gt; higher level, when you dual wield skill is higher, using two weapons would<br/>\n&gt; be more effective.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course it is a Catch-22.  You are not going to be able to dual wield<br/>\n&gt; effectively at high levels unless you practice at lower levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Date: Fri, 9 Jul 1999 10:58:29 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Shield or dual wield?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Fellow Bards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          I&#39;ve been off for awhile so excuse me if this topic has been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     beaten to death already.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          Which is better;  using a good shield (SBS or darkwood for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     example) or using dual wield?  I&#39;m approaching 17th and have even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     procured a Dragoon dirk in anticipation of dual wield but my friend<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     feels it is more advantageous to carry my SB shield saying that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     additions damage form the occasional (why?) second strike does not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     outweigh the defensive bonus of the shield.   I end up tanking about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     half the time so this is an important question.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          My friend was on beta so I usually trust his judgment. (And he<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     also one of those power gamer types that always calculates<br/>\neverything<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     to the nth degree.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;          So let me know what you all think.
