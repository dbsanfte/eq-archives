Bachman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbachman@...\">kbachman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes my faith in humanity gets restored:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Saturday night, I woke up camped at Mistmoore.  I had spent a long<br/>\n&gt; time the previous weekend waiting for gloves that never showed up, and<br/>\n&gt; figured I would stick my head inside to see if I could get lucky.  I<br/>\n&gt; zoned in, and what did I see at the top of the ramp but a named Gypsy<br/>\n&gt; carrying a Lute (and her pet).  She conned blue to me.  Now, I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; prepared to whack a blue and a pet, so I /ooc&#39;ed to ask if <br/>\n&gt; anyone would<br/>\n&gt; be willing to help me out.  As she started to leave, two guys <br/>\n&gt; showed up<br/>\n&gt; and started to hit her.  &quot;Great!&quot;, I figured, here&#39;s the help I asked<br/>\n&gt; for, so I piled on.  Through some miracle, I actually got the<br/>\n&gt; experience, and looted the Lute of the Gypsy Princess.  This <br/>\n&gt; is cool, of<br/>\n&gt; course, but not particularly useful - I had really wanted the <br/>\n&gt; Gypsy Lute<br/>\n&gt; for my armor - but, as a Bard, I was very happy to get it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did /tells to both of the others to thank them.  One sent <br/>\n&gt; back a short<br/>\n&gt; grumble, the other said, essentially, &quot;Sure, anytime you want me to do<br/>\n&gt; damage to something so you can KS it from me, just ask.&quot;  Apparently<br/>\n&gt; they weren&#39;t responding to my /ooc.  After some /tells back <br/>\n&gt; and forth, I<br/>\n&gt; determined that they had been camping the music room for four hours,<br/>\n&gt; their group had just been trashed, and the two of them had gone back<br/>\n&gt; into MM to get the Lute that they knew was at the top.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what do I do?  I gave him the Lute.  Kind of a bummer, I go from<br/>\n&gt; being really elated at my extraordinary stroke of fortune to being<br/>\n&gt; depressed at being thought of as a KSer, but it seemed the honorable<br/>\n&gt; thing to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I&#39;m wandering away, I get a /tell from the guild leader of their<br/>\n&gt; guild, who was a member of the group they were in.  He tells <br/>\n&gt; me to come<br/>\n&gt; back; they were retaking the music room and, in thanks for my<br/>\n&gt; consideration, he intended to have them give me the first <br/>\n&gt; lute that they<br/>\n&gt; found.  And they did!  Not only that, but it was the Gypsy Lute that I<br/>\n&gt; had really wanted anyway!
