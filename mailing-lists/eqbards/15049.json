Since he&#39;s a consistent L50 mob, it offers a unique<br/>\nopportunity to collect data without having to worry about<br/>\nlevel variation in the target.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreliminary stats for last night&#39;s combat activities (87 str,<br/>\n126 dex):<br/>\n<br/>\nYkesha (8/24) in primary<br/>\n9223 damage<br/>\n508 hits (56.0%)<br/>\n399 misses (44.0%)<br/>\n20 procs unresisted<br/>\n22 procs resisted<br/>\navg dam/hit = 18.2<br/>\nmelee damage = 4.24 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>\nmelee damage = 7.56 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>\nmelee damage + procs = 4.93 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>\nproc rate = 1 per 51.8 sec<br/>\n<br/>\nWakizashi (7/21) in primary<br/>\n9006 damage<br/>\n551 hits (55.8%)<br/>\n437 misses (44.2%)<br/>\navg dam/hit = 16.3<br/>\nmelee damage = 4.34 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>\nmelee damage = 7.78 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>\n<br/>\nDragoon dirk (6/23) in secondary<br/>\n4932 damage<br/>\n654 hits (54.5%)<br/>\n547 misses (45.3%)<br/>\n65.0% dual wield rate (this sounds way too high)<br/>\navg dam/hit = 7.5<br/>\nmelee damage = 1.79 dam/sec (including misses)<br/>\nmelee damage = 3.28 dam/sec (hits only)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs expected, the Wak has a slightly higher damage output over<br/>\ntime than the Yak, but the difference is probably<br/>\nstatistically insignificant at 2% (the parser doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncalculate deviations - I may have to write my own :).  Add in<br/>\nthe proc from the Yak even with a &gt;50% resist rate (dino was<br/>\nred) and the Yak is generating 14% more damage than the Wak,<br/>\nwhich with this sample size probably is statistically<br/>\nsignificant.  So for me, the Yak is clearly the better weapon<br/>\nin my primary hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll also note that the secondary weapon damage is much<br/>\nlower even after you account for the less than 100% dual wield<br/>\nactivation.  Other studies have found that your secondary<br/>\nweapon does not get certain bonuses your primary weapon gets.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone tell me how the parser figures out that my<br/>\ncharacter is a L46 wood elf?  I didn&#39;t see that anywhere in<br/>\nthe logfiles.  :)  And before you ask which parser this is, I<br/>\nonly used the parser for the total damage, hits, and misses.  <br/>\nThe rest of the values I calculated in a spreadsheet.  The<br/>\nparser calculated average damage based on time in combat,<br/>\nwhich doesn&#39;t account for things like PL, target out of range,<br/>\netc.  I normalized it based on hit attempts, then used the<br/>\nweapon delay to generate equivalent average damage over time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
