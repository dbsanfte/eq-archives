Off to the ruins Derv<br/>\ncamp they run. &quot;Hey, there&#39;s only one derv in the<br/>\ncamp, let&#39;s get it before the others spawn!&quot; one<br/>\nof them says.. I look at said derv. Euridite Caster.<br/>\nI con said derv. Blood boiling red. &quot;Um, it&#39;s red<br/>\nto me and it&#39;s a caster. I&#39;d rather not.&quot; I say.<br/>\n&quot;Ok, who wants to pull?&quot; they ask. &quot;We&#39;re all going<br/>\nto die&quot; I think to myself. Before I can say anything<br/>\nelse, I see a fireball flying towards said derv<br/>\ncaster. At this point I honestly think I heard<br/>\nlaughter coming from the derv. *BOOM* Wizard number<br/>\none is at half health. The other wizard casts a<br/>\nspell. I decide I may as well do my part since we&#39;re<br/>\nhere.. I cast a spell.. &quot;Your target has resisted<br/>\nyour Furor spell!&quot; Doh! Again this happens. I turn<br/>\nto healing my group members who, after two more casts<br/>\nby the Derv are at 1/4 health each. &quot;RUN!&quot; they say.<br/>\nWow, the first intelligent decision I&#39;ve heard.<br/>\nDivine Aura on, boots start walkin&#39;.. Wizard one goes<br/>\noff the radar. Wizard two goes off the radar. Cleric<br/>\nwith brain enters tunnel with full health. I waddle to<br/>\nthe e.commons zone to get myself out of the derv&#39;s<br/>\nmind. I come back and wait at the platform meditating<br/>\nwhat little mana a level 9 cleric gets that I&#39;d spent<br/>\non healing them and using DA. Wizard number two comes<br/>\nback to n.ro zone (see him on group list). I&#39;m waiting..<br/>\nWaiting.. Wizard number two&#39;s health starts going<br/>\ndown. I stand, look around.. nope. Not here. Wizard<br/>\ntwo dies. Not a word said to the group as to where he<br/>\nwas to give him help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard one /tell&#39;s me.. &quot;Hey, why did you disband?&quot; I<br/>\nreply that &quot;I&#39;m going to move on. Do some travelling I<br/>\nthink.&quot; Wizard one /tell&#39;s me.. &quot;Aw man, we really need<br/>\nyou!&quot; I don&#39;t reply. You can guess what I was thinking<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s how I get out of bad groups. If you&#39;re<br/>\nnot wanting to be in a group with the people because<br/>\nthey&#39;re a bad group, you really shouldn&#39;t worry about<br/>\nwhat they think of you because you&#39;re not going to be<br/>\nlooking for them again anytime in the near future.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
