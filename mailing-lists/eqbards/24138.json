You effectively argue that we are<br/>\n&gt;powerful - and even &quot;not-underpowered&quot;.  The power you describe here is one<br/>\n&gt;that makes it easy for us to get into groups - especially given the small<br/>\n&gt;number of bards in general.  The Druids and Rangers in my guild get<br/>\n&gt;frustrated at how much more difficult it is for them to get in groups in,<br/>\n&gt;say Karnor - while I get often get tells asking me if I&#39;m a group (even when<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t have LFG flag on).<br/>\n&gt;Arguing semantically even further - I could argue you have made not a single<br/>\n&gt;argument towards power - only versatility - but that would pretty much be<br/>\n&gt;arguing for arguing sake - I think you DO make a good arugment that bards<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t underpowered and are consistently powerful vis-├á-vis other classes.<br/>\n&gt;On the other hand, I have yet to see an effective argument by you or anyone<br/>\n&gt;else that bards are &quot;Over&quot; Powered.  To be &quot;Over Powered&quot; would imply that<br/>\n&gt;the class needs to be &quot;nerfed&quot;.  If we were overpowered - you would often<br/>\n&gt;see people say &quot;we can&#39;t start this group until we have a bard&quot;.
