GK&#39;s in Solb?) started dropping<br/>\nNaggy/Vox loots - heh!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character<br/>\nover<br/>\n&gt; the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; heard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia, you had a high level Bard on test, didn&#39;t you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I read on the Gameplay board this morning that Brad is taking suggestions<br/>\n&gt; on:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeard that they tried a load from tape and it brought back all the GM Buffed<br/>\n& Itemized Level 60 chars from the Kunark beta as well. (more on that<br/>\nbelow.)  It restored every character recently created not just current<br/>\ncharacters or something like that.  On live servers they are able to restore<br/>\nchars from tapes they keep.  Not sure of the current cycle but about 6<br/>\nmonths ago a friend got restored but the save point was from a few days<br/>\nprevious.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>\n&gt; stinks nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt stinks - big time!  Think about this happening on a live server or on all<br/>\nlive servers. I guess that is why they have a test server but it also points<br/>\nout (yet again) the woefull lack of professionalism in Verant&#39;s procedures.<br/>\nAre they no more than a bunch of &quot;Cowboy Coders&quot; ??? They can&#39;t even do<br/>\nreliable tape back-ups??? Here is a valuable resource - test server and the<br/>\ntesters.  The design of the game is such that you need to invest large<br/>\namounts of time to get to high levels. To go for a year and allow folks to<br/>\nbuild their chars and test the new things without adequate protection is<br/>\nsimply gross negligence.  To say &quot;its just a test environment and you knew<br/>\nthat you could be pwiped at any given time without notice...&quot; is just<br/>\nlegalise B.S. to cover their ass for their own incompetance.  I can see that<br/>\nlevel of  error allowable on in-house, alpha level environment or even<br/>\nclosed beta.  To have run the closed beta on the test server - was a huge<br/>\nerror on their part (thank you 20-20 hind site) but it smacks of their<br/>\n&quot;penny-wise, pound-foolish&quot; attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the test server and the testers there are truly valuable resources, then<br/>\nthey should have had adequate safeguards in place to allow them to recover<br/>\ntheir test world to a previous save point.  This really hurts they<br/>\ncredibility and shows what little respect they have for testers who are<br/>\nhelping them.  Imagine how they regard the ones who merely play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I heard that in the beta GM&#39;s would &quot;buff&quot; their friends (testers) -<br/>\nmake them level 60, give them any weps, any armor, and then they would try<br/>\nstuff.  I heard that folks saw these guys in this uber-garb but with weps<br/>\nequipped in the wrong hands and stuff.  When they (GM twinkies) tried to<br/>\nfight mobs, they got owned.  But not cuz of their gear that was for sure.<br/>\nThey just did not know what they were doing: ie &quot;could not fight their way<br/>\nout of a paper bag, much less clear the way to Trak&#39;s lair.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is merely rumors. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
