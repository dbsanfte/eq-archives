That scared me off Lament for quite awhile myself.  For that reason,<br/>\nLament isn&#39;t especially useful when trying to break an area that you can&#39;t handle if things go wrong,<br/>\nunless you&#39;re willing to eat a death.  It is VERY useful trying to break an area that would be really<br/>\ndifficult and mana-exhaustive but doable.  Chef in Sebilis is an example.  There are five MOBs there.<br/>\nWith mez, a solid group can handle all five at once.  It isn&#39;t pretty, it takes a long time to recover<br/>\nafterwards, and it doesn&#39;t break the room up very well for later respawns, but it can be done.  It&#39;s much<br/>\nbetter if you can take the room apart in pieces, though - one, two or three at a time.  Which Lament lets<br/>\nyou do.  Basically, it lets you get smaller pulls a large part of the time, which helps a lot with<br/>\ndowntime and mana management.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 57 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher Sanders wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Outdoor pulling is no problem, when grabbing wandering mobs, but correct me<br/>\n&gt; if I&#39;m wrong, but we are *not* dungeon pullers, correct?
