","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-423398036\">When I was your level, I had a snakeskin tunic and some patch with the odd<br/>\nbit of looted leather and was just beginning to get some banded pieces.<br/>\nBut....knowing what I now know, here&#39;s a few tips.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want to balance your str, agi, & dex stats with boosters like studded or<br/>\nspiked collars, derv rings, magic rings or earrings, magic bracers if you<br/>\ncan afford or acquire, rusty-spiked shoulders, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGet your agi and dex to 100. Then get your str up as high as you can.  Look<br/>\nat armor and wear the best AC-to-weight ratio pieces if you have a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBear gloves from Ged Twigborn in Kithicor Wood (look out for the skellies<br/>\nand ghouls - he wanders right past them - also those Shraylock Orcs are near<br/>\nthe other end of his route, and the odd griz walks about.)  Bring him a HQ<br/>\nbear and 25gp - have exact change - take like 30gp in case he raises price<br/>\nbased on faction/charisma.  Unless of course you have a HQ LION and 96gp -<br/>\nthen get those.<br/>\n<br/>\nBear Boots for sure & possibly other items from Chanda & Baobob Miller in<br/>\nQeynos Hills at the Surefall Glade tunnel.  Go talk to Baobob first, then he<br/>\nwill tell you how to get Chanda to talk to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nPolar bear cloak from Karg in Everfrost.  You will need a ranger to track<br/>\nhim and you will have to be pretty carefull out there - skellies and ice<br/>\nbone skellies not to mention the snow leopards.  He wants a polar bear skin<br/>\nand 5pp for his cloak.  If you have lots of pp, buy as many cloaks as you<br/>\ncan and go sell them in Freeport, N. Ro & Oasis.  Yes for some odd reason<br/>\nthe desert dwelling casters get real cold? (It&#39;s one of the few things they<br/>\ncan wear for ac and they will pay 15pp and sometimes more.  They like the<br/>\nbear boots too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDerv rings for dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are magic earrings for str but they go for like 40pp each - made by<br/>\njewelers. That&#39;s a lot of wisps! <br/>\n<br/>\nSnakeskin tunic is good for you since you will be hunting snake for quite a<br/>\nfew more levels.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso go see Menkes Tabolet in South Qeynos - near docks he wanders around.<br/>\nHe will make you a snake fang necklace sv +2 poison.  Heck, he will make you<br/>\nas many as you can carry - get a bunch and head up to East Commonlands and<br/>\nsell to guys who get bit by snakes near the Ro tunnel.  When you are sitting<br/>\nthere watching the hp drop slowly even after the snake is dead, suddenly 1pp<br/>\nfor sv +2 poison starts to look pretty good!  Also, they been spammed with<br/>\nauctions for things at 4pp to 40pp and would like something to buy that they<br/>\ncan afford - this is a good thing to sell em - also a baby rare if they are<br/>\nfrom Freeport or Neriak.  Never had any left by the time I&#39;d get to Fay but<br/>\nI&#39;d bet they&#39;d sell good there too.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour str affects 2 things:<br/>\n<br/>\nhow much weight your can carry - which says what mix of ac you can have<br/>\n<br/>\nhow much damage you can possibly deliver<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - you if you are like me - want to add stuff to max str.  Get used to the<br/>\nidea that you cant haul much loot without encumberment.  My #1 hot key is<br/>\nAnthem.  I tried using dimensional pockets and spirit pouches but lost too<br/>\nmany things:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;SYSTEM MESSAGE&gt; Log out now -- the server is coming down for maintenance!<br/>\nYou have been warned!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly enters the world...<br/>\nHmm, what happened to my Chitin Shield?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\nBard of the 21st song<br/>\nSelling Swords and Such<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:email@...\">email@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:email@...\">email@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, August 18, 1999 5:23 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Bard armour<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:email@...\">email@...</a> (Melaniel)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWell it&#39;s mostly armour I think.  As a lowly wood elf who is<br/>\nsomewhat<br/>\n\t\tweak, I&#39;m finding it more and more difficult to cope with<br/>\nall the<br/>\n\t\tarmour and weapons I carry, and still be able to pick up<br/>\nsome loot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMy str is somewhere around 80 (memory failure!).  And before<br/>\nI even<br/>\n\t\tset out to hunt I&#39;m carrying all but 10 of it.  Now ok, I&#39;m<br/>\nkitted out<br/>\n\t\tin some fairly decent armour, mostly banded and ringmail,<br/>\nand a piece<br/>\n\t\tof bronze, so I&#39;m well protected.  But it&#39;s rather heavy!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of<br/>\narmour I can<br/>\n\t\tget that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives,<br/>\nor<br/>\n\t\tsomewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can<br/>\neven go<br/>\n\t\tout and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income<br/>\nif cheap<br/>\n\t\tisn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThanks all<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-- <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSaldara<br/>\n\t\tHigh Elf Wizard (20), Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMelaniel<br/>\n\t\tWood Elf Bard (11), Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tStart a new ONElist list & you can WIN great prizes!<br/>\n\t\tFor details on ONElist&#39;s NEW FRIENDS & FAMILY program, go to<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
