Success!  We got a book for our Palidan, Druid stick - Ally, Selo&#39;s Drums - Sylly, Scourge Hammer - Arif, GPK - not sure, Fire Emerald Ring - Ataras. Also, Crown of King Tranix, Mith Arms, Mask.  Pretty nice haul for a change.  We suffered 4 deaths on Nag and the fight was fun.  He got out on to the bridge and fell off into the lava - ugh!  We backed off quickly and he clambered out and fought on the far side of the bridge until he died.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am pretty excited with Selos drums  and will be giving them a good workout.  Looks like PoF tonight - going to be a lot of hair standing on end and begining chanters I suspect &lt;eg&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nBardette of 50 songs<br/>\n... somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
