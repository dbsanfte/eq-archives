I haven&#39;t experimented with it<br/>\nreally, but I&#39;m hoping someone else maybe knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd... I&#39;ve been playing with CoD/Hymn for wisp slaying.  If I&#39;m reading<br/>\nright, CoD is considered to be a DoT - if that&#39;s the case, how long does it<br/>\nlast?  What I&#39;ve been doing is wince... wounds... wounds... repeat.  Almost<br/>\nsounds like directions for a shampoo. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly... Crookstinger: what poison does it affect with and where can you<br/>\nget it?  I LOVE weapons that proc even if they aren&#39;t that great, like the<br/>\ntent whip, since I&#39;m finding myself twisting songs and instruments far more<br/>\nthan melee&#39;ing in a (good) group.  At least I never have to yell OOM.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-GW<br/>\n&lt;Scummy and Sicarius @ Veeshan&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
