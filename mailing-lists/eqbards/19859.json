He says they merely forgot to take them<br/>\nout but are gonna leave them there but not add any more of them.  He says<br/>\nthey wanted Kunark to be a place that would require you to have needs to<br/>\nreturn to the other continents - not be a fully populated place that you<br/>\nwould not ever have to leave. Anyways, that&#39;s his story.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nMinstrel somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I have this stone bridge in North Karana - for sale really cheap!  You<br/>\ncan charge ppl to cross it and make your money back in no time at all!<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s. Jacana, and all others on Inny, feel free to /tell me if you need<br/>\nsome transport.  If I am not too busy, I can usually have my wizard on the<br/>\n2nd PC teleport.  He&#39;s only 31 so it&#39;s one-way from FV to North K, Tox or<br/>\nGhetto Faydark.<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.s.s.  He (my 31 wiz) was standing on the FV bridge one day - on the side<br/>\nnear the merchants and such.  I hear this noise of a fight and glance at the<br/>\nother screen and see the guards telling something that they dont tolerate<br/>\nfoul creatures, etc. etc.  So, I wonder who trained a spider all the way to<br/>\nthe bridge and dont pay any attention.  A moment later, I hear my wiz<br/>\ngetting attacked!  So now I look and see the Ancient Jarsath hitting him for<br/>\n110.  Ouch!  While he fumbles for yonder or gate, the AJ kills him and then<br/>\nI realize that he was standing at his *bind point* !!!!  So, I power off the<br/>\nPC and hope for the best.  When I got back on, he only took one death -<br/>\nthankfully!  But the AJ somehow chewed his way past all four bridge guards<br/>\nand I guess one of the patrolling scouts finally took him out.  There were<br/>\nhalf a dozen or so pc corpses strewn along the bridge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Cheryl Kiraly&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cheryl@...\">cheryl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 18, 2000 7:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Bard Training in Kunark<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Just curious - are bards the only guild that do not have a trainer there?<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; saw many other trainers along the way and even someone to sell songs....<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jacana, Wood Elf Bard of the 17th song, Innoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
