If I had waited to find balanced <br/>\ngroups, I would<br/>\nnever have gotten to 53.  I have made a considerable portion of my 53 <br/>\nlevels with just a<br/>\nwarrior at my side.  We welcome others to group with us without regard for <br/>\nclass because<br/>\nfor the most part we don&#39;t need any specific class.  I really get annoyed <br/>\nat the &quot;we have<br/>\nto have a healer&quot; types.  I am the first to admit that I am a cleric junkie <br/>\nbut with careful<br/>\nplanning, (and more careful pulling), our healing songs, and a stack of <br/>\nband aids we are usually fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I am posting, I might as well get screamed at for this <br/>\nobservation.  With any healer<br/>\ntype other than a cleric, I can heal the party up faster than they can heal <br/>\nus and then med<br/>\nup enough mana to be ready to go again.   At first I marked it up to a bad <br/>\nplayer but as I have<br/>\npartied with more folks, this observation still holds true.  Scream away at <br/>\nme, tell me that<br/>\nI am crazy.  No worries from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;i find it too hard to wait around for a balanced group, so i grab whoever <br/>\n&gt;happens to<br/>\n&gt;be around and drag em off to sebilis.  well actually most of the time i <br/>\n&gt;just live in<br/>\n&gt;sebilis and pick up whoever happens to be hanging around the zonein.  so <br/>\n&gt;we usually<br/>\n&gt;have at least on hole in the group, sometimes more, heh. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
