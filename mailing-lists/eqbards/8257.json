To recap, I have never killed a live froglok so they are<br/>\nnot KOS towards me.  In theory, that combined with the invis song will allow<br/>\nme to go through Upper Guk safely.  However, once I get into Lower Guk the<br/>\nundead frogloks will still attack me.  I discussed my plan with my<br/>\nguildmembers last night and some of them told me that even with Invis to<br/>\nUndead, my chances of safely going to Lower Guk to loot a Guise were not<br/>\ngood.  I was told told that the undead frogloks can sometimes see through<br/>\nInvis to Undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone familiar with Lower Guk give me some advice with this plan?  I<br/>\ndo not intend to attack anything while in Lower Guk.  As soon as I enter the<br/>\nzone, I will announce that I would like to purchase looting rights for the<br/>\nGuise.  Until I get a positive response,  I will stay by the zone border.<br/>\nOnce I get a positive response, I will get invis to undead cast on me.  Once<br/>\nI loot and pay for the Guise, I&#39;m leaving Lower Guk.  How far away is the<br/>\nspawn point for the Guise from the zone border?  can someone give me the<br/>\ndirections I should take?  Invis to undead doesn&#39;t last very long so thats a<br/>\nbig factor.  Would I have time to run back to the zone border if attacked<br/>\nwhile looting?  <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, how much should I offer for the looting rights? I was planning on<br/>\nstarting at 50PP and bartering from there.  I can spend up to 300PP but<br/>\nobviously would like to get it as cheap as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n24 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
