An informal timing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-906099987\">Hmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the general impression from several group members that I have had, is<br/>\nthat Jig dramatically increases the speed of mana regen.  An informal timing<br/>\n(without stopwatch) went like this:<br/>\nempty mana bar<br/>\ntwo bubbles filled, no song<br/>\nstart jig<br/>\nthree bubbles filled, in about the same length of time as the first two<br/>\n<br/>\nthree or four different meditators have reported this effect to me.  So, I<br/>\nhave taken to running restoration until heals are nearly to, or all the way<br/>\nto full, then switching to jig, to get the spellcasters mana up quickly.  My<br/>\nimpression is that there is a fair amount of speed increase.  (I have also<br/>\nbeen using the forage timer for some of this - i.e. click on forage, start<br/>\nsong, wait for forage to stop, compare with not having song running)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to get some guys in my guild to do some more extensive testing,<br/>\nwith stopwatches, this week, and report the results.  Oh, yeah, if this<br/>\nworks the way I think it does, by shorting out the timer on meding, then<br/>\nlevel/skill should not matter at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough<br/>\n14th Song Wanderer of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 20, 1999 8:19 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Sat, 19 Jun 1999, Roop Dirump wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Er, back to my original question about Jig and Mana, sorry.<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone done<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any definitive tests on this?

This is<br/>\n&gt; one of the more difficult things to test since you need a<br/>\n&gt; partner who is as sharp as you are at this type of thing (and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure the cleric was, although she said she was using a<br/>\n&gt; stopwatch, so...).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My guess as to why people are saying bard songs slow mana<br/>\n&gt; regen down is because Restoration tends to fill up the health<br/>\n&gt; bar so quickly, and they&#39;re used to comparing their mana regen<br/>\n&gt; with their health regen.  Suddenly the health is shooting up<br/>\n&gt; there while the mana appears to lag behind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
