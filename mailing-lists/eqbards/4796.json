The stat improvement for the<br/>\ntwo seem to be different, but in my low 20s, Chant was giving<br/>\na greater str boost than Anthem.  Anthem only speeds up your<br/>\nattacks by about 10% (I&#39;ve heard 0.3 sec as well).  Chant will<br/>\nalso give the same boost to dex and give a minor AC boost as<br/>\nwell.  Without a drum I&#39;d say Anthem is better, but with a<br/>\ndrum it&#39;s Chant.  I just usually keep Anthem loaded instead<br/>\nthough because I&#39;m too lazy to switch songs.  :-)  The<br/>\ndifference is not that great IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it a bad idea to use AE songs in High Keep?  For example - could I have<br/>\n&gt; used Largo&#39;s to slow their attack speeds?  Or would I have met all kinds of<br/>\n&gt; new monsters from Area Effects? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No idea.  Try it and tell us.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If a red mob resists the bellow - is it worth it to try again or does one<br/>\n&gt; resist mean that they will always resist?  Does how badly damaged the mob<br/>\n&gt; matter?  Say you see a resist in the top half of his health - so wait til<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s under 50% hp before trying another?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my observations, level matters, but otherwise it&#39;s<br/>\ncompletely random.  There may be some flakiness with the<br/>\nrandom number generator, or some same mobs of the same /con<br/>\ncan have different magic resists, because the only other trend<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed is that you will get a long string of resists way<br/>\nmore often than you&#39;d expect if it were truly random.  (This<br/>\nis coming from a guy who delved pretty heavily into statistics<br/>\nand random processes characterization for his master&#39;s<br/>\nthesis.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo try hitting it with a song 4-5 times.  If they&#39;re *all*<br/>\nresisted, then give up.  The only exception is chain, while<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten to stick on reds from 20%-50% of the time.  When<br/>\nthe mob starts to run, you will want to chain it - it costs<br/>\nyour spellcasters mana to root it, whereas your chains are<br/>\nfree so the resists don&#39;t matter to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; red to me. Half the reds resisted my bellows consistently.  It didn&#39;t seem<br/>\n&gt; like I was contributing much with pierce for 2 points of damage and taking<br/>\n&gt; the occasional hit for 32 points of damage. So, I stepped back from the<br/>\n&gt; melee and played some songs with instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the group is spreading damage evenly, another thing you can<br/>\ndo is play Hymn while switching your drum with a lute.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nbother to put the second instrument in an inventory slot -<br/>\n&quot;hold&quot; it with the mouse, and switch when you change to a song<br/>\nthat uses a different instruemnt.  This by the way is also how<br/>\nyou can use DDD, Dissonance, and Hymn with the appropriate<br/>\ninstrument for each song, and is yet another reason not to use<br/>\nthe mouse to switch songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most of my experience has been with a partner and we both gotta melle.  Or<br/>\n&gt; me as tank and 2 casters doing the nuking.  Or full party&#39;s but more<br/>\n&gt; co-level and all but the casters are in the melee because we don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; &#39;real&#39; tanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My enchanter friend hit 29 last night, and with her clarity<br/>\nspell, the downtimes were noticably shorter.  Can&#39;t wait til I<br/>\nget the clarity song.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So have some fighters with big swords was a new and<br/>\n&gt; interesting experience. I spent the whole night in a room full of reds when<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t survive a camp of greens &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup, they are both very different fighting styles grouped with<br/>\ntanks and grouped with casters.  You could almost think of an<br/>\nodd analogy between the two styles and sex...  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
