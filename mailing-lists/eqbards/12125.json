Twice (in a row, no less) I<br/>\nswitched targets from the pet to a kobold midintimidation (after pushing<br/>\nbutton, before kick attempt) and landed the kick.  I was quite proud of<br/>\nmyself, to say the least.  Skill was 53 at the time of kicking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was grouped with a warrior, shaman and SK for about 10 hours there<br/>\n(early flight home for me), and made 3 bubbles worth of level 40<br/>\nexperience.  The place was nearly empty early in the morning, and the<br/>\npulls were fast and fierce.  My job was crowd control when multiple came<br/>\nin, melee/buff/chain with just one, and mana/hymn between.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been starting to use binding again on a regular basis (when grouped<br/>\nwith ranger/druid), and I believe it grows in effectiveness with levels as<br/>\nwell.  It&#39;s still nothing compared to enchanter/shaman slowdowns, but came<br/>\nin handy with pickup groups who wouldn&#39;t target just one mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
