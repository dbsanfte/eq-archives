I *think* I punched for 6 once, but I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure...average seems to be 2 to 4, with lots of misses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; After realizing that I switched over to pure hand-to-hand, thinking that the<br/>\n&gt; Lute was the problem.  I still didn&#39;t notice any skill-ups, but I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; fight very long this way before giving up (without the Lute it was hard to<br/>\n&gt; take down the reavers).  Perhaps I didn&#39;t see any skill-ups because my hand-<br/>\n&gt; to-hand skill is pathetically low to begin with?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, another thing to consider is the delay on hands is kinda slow, compared<br/>\nto a dirk or longsword. (30 delay is what I&#39;ve heard before.)  So, less punches=<br/>\nless chances to hit=less chances for skill to increase.  And yes, I believe it<br/>\ndoes<br/>\ngo raise slower the lower the skill is.  I used to punch a lot back in the<br/>\nteens/20s,<br/>\nand the skill would hardly move - I was never able to maxed it.  Recently, at<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n30, I&#39;ve been using the lute in Cazic to lullaby some monster huge pulls, and<br/>\nwhile punching away (for 2 to 4 damage at a time, grr) my skill shot up 10<br/>\npoints or so, way faster than it had before.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyone with more experience in the support-bard role have any tips for a<br/>\n&gt; battle-bard?  I was pretty impressed at how effective I am at higher levels<br/>\n&gt; with just songs...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, lullaby just gets better and better...I hadn&#39;t used it for a few levels,<br/>\nbecause it was such a hassle finding a spot where I wouldn&#39;t sleep people<br/>\nin other groups. (On Rallos Zek)  But lately, with Cazic having 10-15 people<br/>\non average, I&#39;ve pulled it out again, and have been rather amazed how well it<br/>\nworks. 5+ lizzies, almost no resists, very few of them waking up early...its<br/>\nbeautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\nLull has proven useful lately too.  Nice trick: Invis up, sneak past what you plan<br/>\n<br/>\nto pull, lull the stuff thats within agro radius that you don&#39;t want to fight yet,<br/>\nthen<br/>\nhave your puller pull the mob.  This way, with almost no risk, you have 3 fewer<br/>\nmobs incoming...<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lohengrin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
