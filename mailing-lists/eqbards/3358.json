Hola everyone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m currently a drunken bard on Rodcet Nife and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;have obtained lvl 42.  Anxiously, awaiting lvl 43<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Take for example, the level 42 song: Berserk Cresendo.  Great song, 17 str <br/>\n&gt;and a extra 5% attack speed from the Celerity song...  but it won&#39;t stack <br/>\n&gt;with anything!  I went back to the celerity/anthem stack because three stats <br/>\n&gt;boosted (str/agi/dex) and still 20% increase in attack; it far outways the <br/>\n&gt;Berserker song.  So yes, another high level song that is up to par with <br/>\n&gt;another anti-disease song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>urk, not what i wanted hear. just got lvl 40, and i do the chant celerity<br/>\nstack too ( i assume you mean chant of battle instead of anthem, cause<br/>\ncelerity and anthem dont stack for me). maybe throw in the damage shields<br/>\nof the psalms, maybe the fyils or whatever&#39;s chant if we need a lower magic<br/>\nresistance, maybe bellows depending on my mood. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, I was at a loss recently to find things to solo while my crew isn&#39;t on. <br/>\n&gt; Still not soloing much, but I did find a fun way for two bards (or a bard <br/>\n&gt;and a &#39;snare&#39; casting profession) to beat the crap out of a single critter <br/>\n&gt;they couldn&#39;t do head on.  The first bard plays a stack of chains/bellows.  <br/>\n&gt;Slows the creature down just as fine as snare spell.  The second bard sneaks <br/>\n&gt;up and turns on fear song.  The creature inches away trying to flee, while <br/>\n&gt;you pummel it to death, all the time keeping it locked down with chains.  <br/>\n&gt;We&#39;ve killed high level 30&#39;s without ever being hit once.  And it&#39;s not that <br/>\n&gt;boring kite stuff either, it&#39;s much more pleasant to do. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i just grouped with another bard on tunare (keyana) and we had a blast with<br/>\na cleric and paladin. the 4 of us where taking on 4 spectres at a time (pal<br/>\nwas 36, cleric was 43, bards where 39 and 40). we just went right up on top<br/>\nof the isle of spectres in the lake in oasis and camped and killed as they<br/>\nspawn. The fear/chain combo was what made this possible. that and the<br/>\ncleric and paladin where estatic over the dual chorus of clarity :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
