However, if mobs<br/>\nwere breaking root at anywhere near the frequency they&#39;re<br/>\n&quot;breaking out&quot; of Lullaby and Pixie Strike, the casters would<br/>\nstring GZ up by the... ahem.  Anyhow, the fact that Pixie<br/>\nStrike works much better if you successfully get one to stick<br/>\nleads me to believe this is a bona fide bug, and not a high<br/>\n&quot;second resist&quot; effect.  If it were just a &quot;second resist&quot;<br/>\neffect, then it shouldn&#39;t matter whether or not you&#39;ve gotten<br/>\none Pixie Strike to stick.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
