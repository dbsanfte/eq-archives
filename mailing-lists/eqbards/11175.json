I believe the reason there is no icon<br/>\n&gt;is to allow the song to stack with the song of another bard. Testing<br/>\n&gt;conducted by many Bards&Caster pairs clearly indicates this song has a<br/>\n&gt;3-pulse duration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ariell Thudnerwolf, Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Snicker Furfoot, Esq.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Clarity)?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A: There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an <br/>\n&gt;icon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; song effect going indefinitely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your <br/>\n&gt;screen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; text3.html &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
