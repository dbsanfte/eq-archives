I cannot begin to count the<br/>\n&gt; number of times I&#39;ve zoned, started running and turned, the<br/>\n&gt; disk (SCSI) grinds to load data, and instead of turning 90<br/>\n&gt; degrees I get whipped 180 and hit the zone again.  I switch<br/>\n&gt; back to Glide every now and then when I get frustrated with<br/>\n&gt; this problem, but the framerate hit I take always makes me<br/>\n&gt; switch back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll probably just end up buying a TNT2 or a GeForce. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
