For myself, up to this point I have<br/>\nonly used one bank (6 hot-keys) of macros.  I have not setup the other five<br/>\nbanks.  If I have confused anyone, I use the term bank to refer to the six<br/>\nbuttons you can hotkey in the lower left hand portion of your screen.  You<br/>\ncan hit Shift-# to switch banks or you can use your mouse to cycle through<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my first bank, I have two inventory slots and two melee slots macroed so<br/>\nI quickly switch from weapon/shield to an instrument if the situation calls<br/>\nfor it.  I have hot-keyed Sense Heading and Foraging to take up the other<br/>\ntwo slots.  I hotkeyed Sense Heading so when I am fleeing I dont have to<br/>\nworry about switching macro banks.  I have Foraging hotkeyed so I can<br/>\ncontinually click on it in between combats.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t worried about macroing songs because I can click on them with my<br/>\nmouse just as easy as hitting the hotkey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m beginning to think that I should place /assist on my main macro bank but<br/>\ndon&#39;t like the idea of moving Sense Heading or Forage to another bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does everyone else have their hotkeys setup?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
