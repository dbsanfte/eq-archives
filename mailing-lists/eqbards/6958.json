(5/19)  I think it looks<br/>\n&gt; much cooler than a sword, and I&#39;m thinking of dropping<br/>\n&gt; my tommy to go with the better looking barbed leather<br/>\n&gt; whip.  Also, the silvery war axe (in perma) looks<br/>\n&gt; better than the PGT, and it&#39;s 6/22.  Your right<br/>\n&gt; though, not a lot of good swords between 20 and 35.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As far as damage over time, I think the best weapons we can use until we<br/>\nhave a hope of getting the EBW or Ykesha, would be the claw in primary,<br/>\nand one of the silvery weapons (6/22) in secondary. The 1H war axe seems<br/>\nto be the easiest to get. I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a scimitar too but they<br/>\nseem really rare.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I have is that I think the claw/war axe combo looks pretty<br/>\nbad. A much better look, IMHO, is a claw and dagger, and the best dagger<br/>\nwe can use is the venerable Dragoon Dirk, at 6/23.  These are basically<br/>\nthe best if you follow the fast delay is best theory. You can get an<br/>\nObsidian Shard (6/25) which also gives you the obsidian shatter effect<br/>\n(30 pts) once and a while. With the depressing number of times we hit<br/>\nfor 1 and 2 pts it&#39;s nice to see that 30 pt proc occasionally so that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve settled on, the odd time I play my bard any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t follow the fast delay is best theory, some weapons you<br/>\ncould use would be the Crystalline Blade/Gladius combo, for a pair of<br/>\nshort swords. This looks ok, but is a slow combo and the gladius<br/>\ncertainly isn&#39;t the best weapon you can get by a long shot. A barbed<br/>\nwhip is one faster but wouldn&#39;t look as good. I don&#39;t know why all the<br/>\nhigh end blades all seem to be short swords instead of long swords, but<br/>\nit&#39;s probably just lazyness on the designer&#39;s part.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
