Someone posted a link on concert hall for a proggie<br/>\nthat lets you macro in eq using a MS sidewinder, i gotta check it out soon,<br/>\nmy joystick is getting pretty dusty. Might want to suggest that to them,<br/>\nsupposedly you can type while its macroing (example: heal/mana in downtime)<br/>\nso that means you just twist during fights and stuff, not in downtimes<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: October 12, 2000 1:43 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] bards in guilds...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nParadigm has 5 bards I believe, all 55+ and of course they all rock :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, every one of them laughs at me for playing Tani.

Kaldivar 53 not really enjoying high level life <br/>\n&gt; (hard to get<br/>\n&gt; good groups, exp so slow, etc. etc.) so he has been leveling <br/>\n&gt; up a warrior<br/>\n&gt; and playing other classes.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lately, I have been playing 52 Cleric and 51 Enchanter.  <br/>\n&gt; Learning these<br/>\n&gt; other classes is more interesting to me at the moment.
