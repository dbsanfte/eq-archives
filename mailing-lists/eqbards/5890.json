If you are given /consent to loot a<br/>\ncorpse and you try to loot a container with a no-drop item in<br/>\nit, it used to be that the container would disappear.  The<br/>\ncontainer still disappears, but if you stop looting and loot<br/>\nagain, it will be back.  Seems they fixed that bug, though in<br/>\na clumsy way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I highly recommend people keep their weapons in regular inventory slots,<br/>\n&gt; which can be hotkeyed.
