Buying that enchanter spell was a two step process - had to<br/>\nBenevolence the guards - then use minor illusion to go indifferent to the<br/>\nmerchant. Least it&#39;s not 3 zones deep into darkie territory like the<br/>\nenchant metal spells in Neriak.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t feel too badly bout dying to them tho - I&#39;ve had to help lvl 50<br/>\nfriends get their corpses out of there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;WELL!<br/>\n&gt;Not very friendly, are they?<br/>\n&gt;To make a long story short (because it&#39;s time to go home ;) as I was <br/>\n&gt;running back and trying to decide to help this poor newbie who was nearly <br/>\n&gt;in tears, afraid he was going to lose his corpse and stuff, as well as <br/>\n&gt;getting my own stuff back, when I suddenly remembered something someone had <br/>\n&gt;told me about the Charismatic Carrilon... and how it would make some <br/>\n&gt;unfriendly people friendly.....<br/>\n&gt;After comforting the bereaved young one, I travelled quickly to the site of <br/>\n&gt;the Brownie Village, and snuck as close as I thought I could without <br/>\n&gt;enraging any Brownies... Firing up my new song, I was rewarded with a glow <br/>\n&gt;and the appropriate message, and when conning, sure enough, the Brownie <br/>\n&gt;guards were indifferent.<br/>\n&gt;I wasn&#39;t sure how long the effect lasted, so I flanicked and peed... er.. <br/>\n&gt;panicked and fled with the contents of the little guy&#39;s corpse., while <br/>\n&gt;dragging my own.  A few moments later, he was reunited with his stuff, and <br/>\n&gt;shortly thereafter, I was as well.  What a deal ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talies the Wanderer </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
