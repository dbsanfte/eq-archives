I have fond memories of saving my party<br/>\nmany many many times with Lullaby and  discovering just how much damage you<br/>\ncould do with an instruments only three song Chords, DDD and heal combo to<br/>\nall those orcs and gnolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then it seems like we have been stealth nerfed into oblivion, although<br/>\nI still have tons of fun with Lago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny of you guys remember the discussions that happened about just &quot;what&quot; the<br/>\nlvl 32 song was.
