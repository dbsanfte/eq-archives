At first was <br/>\n&gt;using my Selos drum and out running the mobs thus losing them. So <br/>\n&gt;I switched to weps and was slow enough but noticed something.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;When you get attacked or attack something, while playing SSoT <br/>\n&gt;(song of travel), the effect drops immediately. And you have to <br/>\n&gt;re-key it to get going again. It looks like it will be un-workable <br/>\n&gt;for fighting mobs if it drops as soon as you key anything else. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Anyhow, I was trying to pull some named spectre/skell thing who <br/>\n&gt;had a pet and was getting whacked pretty good so i started to run. <br/>\n&gt;But with the song dropping and the pet on me, I did not quite make <br/>\n&gt;it far enough away. I got low health and a random froogie agro&#39;d <br/>\n&gt;and I died - ugh. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
