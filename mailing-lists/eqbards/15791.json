All in all it was disappointing. The <br/>\nfact that I died 3 times and am currently separated from all my equipment <br/>\n(Estrella is sittin on it) doesn&#39;t help any. I wouldn&#39;t suggest anyone trying <br/>\nto find their way outa that place on your first visit. Its quite the maze. <br/>\nAnyways a few interesting things. I was told that they use ice based spells <br/>\n(well, true but they also use fire based and magic based suck as creeping <br/>\ncrud). So be prepared with the apropriate songs. Also found our water breathe <br/>\nsong stacks fine with enduring breath (but eb can&#39;t be cast on you if the <br/>\nsong icon is still on). This was the first night I&#39;ve used the cancel magic <br/>\nsong much (thorns and the like on the mermaids) and I noticed there is no <br/>\nconfirmation message (nothing like the spell message &quot;feels slightly <br/>\ndispelled&quot;). Be nice to get that lil thing remedied, I like to know if its <br/>\nbeind resisted or what.<br/>\nAnyways on to the main reason for this post. <br/>\nThis goes out to all yall MM&#39;rs. Tomorrow we&#39;re gonna try a large scale CR <br/>\nbut if it doesnt go well i&#39;d like to have some insurance. What I&#39;m looking <br/>\nfor is a necro with the summon corpse spell. I&#39;ll give 100 plat to whoever <br/>\nfinds the necro and 200 plat (plus 150 for the spell component) to the necro <br/>\nhimself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks yall.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
