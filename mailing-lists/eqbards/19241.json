It is easy to charm one<br/>\nand have it attack a second one.  There are four spawn points in there and a<br/>\ngoblin tower with three spawns just over the ridge as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nHail<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMy bard is 28, and if I have to spend another day running around<br/>\nchickenville in SK looking for Harriers and Avocets during primetime I am<br/>\ngoing to go nuts.  I enjoy the charming in the outdoors and made it through<br/>\nlevel 27 and half way in to 28 with out a scratch on me =).  Does anyone<br/>\nknow anything outdoors (especially static spawns) that is worth going after<br/>\nat this level using charm?  The chickens were nice because the spawns were<br/>\nstatic in the village.  I know there is Choon and Froon but they are<br/>\nusually camped.  Though the centuar spawns in the stables are static I<br/>\nfound it to be a bit risky.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
