Does it really sell for that much?  It&#39;s ridiculously<br/>\neasy to acquire for any party in their low 30s or higher (as<br/>\nlong as they have a bard or enchanter that knows what they&#39;re<br/>\ndoing).  My guild is not the camping or powergaming type, but<br/>\nwe managed to pick up one of these axes for just about<br/>\neveryone in a few hours fighting in that area of Permafrost<br/>\nfor experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe spawn in the area is all linked, so it&#39;s very difficult to<br/>\ncrack (thus the need for a bard or enchanter).  But once you<br/>\nbreak it it&#39;s pretty easy.  Our biggest problem turned out to<br/>\nbe soloers coming in and trying to steal/beg a turn from an<br/>\narea they clearly couldn&#39;t have handled on their own.  We<br/>\ninvited them to join our group (we had 8 people there in two<br/>\nparties), and made sure every one who did join got a special<br/>\nitem before they left.  But a couple of them refused to join,<br/>\nyet hung around calling us names for not giving them a turn.  <br/>\nSometimes I just don&#39;t understand people...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe axe is a wonderful item for a bard.  6 dam 22 del and only<br/>\n2.5 wt.  It solved all my stamina problems - I can now solo<br/>\ntwo and a half blue mobs in succession (with a cleric healing<br/>\nme of course) before I start to run low on stamina.  It also<br/>\nhas the cool medieval axe look, instead of the stone-age axe<br/>\nlook of the PGT.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pugius<br/>\n&gt; is an EXCELLENT piercing weapon for Bards in their teens who decide to go<br/>\n&gt; with piercing, however, one thing eludes me:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where is this weapon found?!?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend in<br/>\n&gt; Unrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>\n&gt; told they do not exist.

Somehow I saw three of them my first week in<br/>\nUnrest, and I&#39;ve never seen any since.  It drops the Pugius as<br/>\nthe common drop, and the Gladius (7/29 short sword) as the<br/>\nrare drop.  I know some of the folks on this list know where<br/>\nit spawns.  Dunno if they&#39;ll share that info though.
