I suddenly feel<br/>\n&gt;guilty about my Mino Axe - Luini has a great point. Before EQ, I always<br/>\n&gt;thought the bard to be far more roguish than warriorish. After all, they<br/>\n&gt;struggle in the streets, searching for musical success, they linger about in<br/>\n&gt;bawdy bars, and are generally lounge-abouts. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you think in this vein, perhaps something more like a dagger is<br/>\n&gt;appropriate. I find the giant snake fang works well, but seems a little<br/>\n&gt;&quot;crude&quot; from a roleplay standpoint. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In swords, I find the bastard sword might be a worthy choice for roleplay,<br/>\n&gt;but not that great for combat. It seems to me axes wouldn&#39;t really be a good<br/>\n&gt;roleplay choice - they&#39;re cumbersome, have exposed blades (usually) and are<br/>\n&gt;&quot;aggressive&quot; weapons (a sword/staff can be used for sparring and parrying,<br/>\n&gt;but an axe is built to rip skin). I think a bard, who probably doesn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt;fulfillment from combat, rather from performing, and carousing, would carry<br/>\n&gt;an unobtrusive weapon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I realize I didn&#39;t truly answer the question, but with EQ, we must choose -<br/>\n&gt;do you want to use a weapon for roleplay? Or for combat effectiveness?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This leads me to ask the inevitable - why is it that bards can wear plate,<br/>\n&gt;chain and even banded? How can ANYONE play an instrument in that attire? I<br/>\n&gt;know when my comrades perform in public they switch to less combative<br/>\n&gt;apparel. But I wonder if the bard is a class that was fully thought out by<br/>\n&gt;the creators of EQ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;More questions than answers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dendall, Ollave of the Aegis<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com\">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: A.Rubman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 1:56 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Ok a new thread<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;A.Rubman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greetings, name&#39;s Luini figure since I don&#39;t know much about the<br/>\n&gt;Soebards I won&#39;t talk about them, instead I have a question. I know that<br/>\n&gt;a Mino Axe is a good 1h-slashing weapon, however I don&#39;t feel it fits in<br/>\n&gt;with my &quot;bardic attitude&quot; if you understand my meaning. Its a massive,<br/>\n&gt;slow, big axe thing from a minotaur, and I&#39;m a bard who likes to travel,<br/>\n&gt;sing his songs and bring mirth. I was using a bronze long sword, now<br/>\n&gt;switched to a plain old Axe (smaller and quicker than a mino), So I ask<br/>\n&gt;you all Whats a good weapon that is not imposing like a mino axe for a<br/>\n&gt;level 8 bard, or even for any level bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;Luini<br/>\n&gt;Innoruk<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 4:28 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Soerbaird and Verant not effective threads<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chlebek@...\">chlebek@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Could these horses be any deader???<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Come on guys, this mailing list is for the discussion of things<br/>\n&gt;relating to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;bards.
