A few<br/>\nexamples: (mostly second hand...)<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\tBellow first came out doing 35 or so points a shout, 50&#39;s at level 20.<br/>\nYou can almost drop a red creature without having to even run from it. It<br/>\nwas an exploit because the song was too powerful. I hear some, however,<br/>\nthought it perfectly natural... They soon toned it down to where it<br/>\ncurrently is.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tEver notice how a creature can hit you no matter how high or low it is<br/>\nfrom you as long as the horizontal distance is within an attack range? Good<br/>\nexample is to run something under the East Karana bridge and get up on it.<br/>\nThe distance from the water to the bridge is well beyond a swing from even<br/>\nBroon but you can still get hit. You can&#39;t attack back however. The reason<br/>\nfor this was that some people were casting levitate on themselves, moving<br/>\noff a high point, and nuking creatures below with spells. Verant changed<br/>\nthings so that these creatures could attack back regardless of how high up<br/>\nthe player is. Fortunately, the KOS range doesn&#39;t seem to be like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.\tJumping. Heh. You used to be able to jump continuously all over the place<br/>\nwithout running out of stamina. With this you could keep ahead of most<br/>\ncreatures without needing accelerando and you could just straight Bellow<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tI Heard some damage spells came out that did large amounts of damage for<br/>\ninsanely small amounts of mana. The persistent damage spells were common<br/>\nsince it isn&#39;t a 1 mana = 1 damage ration sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe way I look at it is if there is no way *ever* for the creature to hit<br/>\nyou, you are exploiting. I&#39;ve been hit plenty of times while kiting. Your<br/>\ndecision though.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ian Murphy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zigmo@...\">zigmo@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 1:31 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Re: Kiting - Is it bad?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ian Murphy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zigmo@...\">zigmo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading the messages about kiting but I have never done it. As of<br/>\nyet, I don&#39;t really have strong enough songs to perform it effectively.<br/>\nMy question is: why is it an exploit? Certain songs/spells have a ranged or<br/>\nradius effect. What if I&#39;m out singing (don&#39;t have a lute or mandolin yet)<br/>\nthe Chords of Discord (hurts my throat) and killing beasties. While looting<br/>\na corpse I&#39;m set upon by a beastie that I feel is too tough for me. I begin<br/>\nto run from it. Getting lost, I run around in circles reading messages that<br/>\nthe beastie winces and I occasionally take damage. Let&#39;s say that I<br/>\naccidentally kill the beastie before it kills me.<br/>\nHave I exploited a bug or not? I was running away the entire time. Is it my<br/>\nfault that the beastie is so enraged it will follow me to the ends of<br/>\nNorrath (or the nearest zone wall)? If this is exploiting a bug, what is<br/>\nthe bug? Is the bug the fact that I have a song that can damage beasties at<br/>\nrange or that I can run as fast or faster than some or that beasties chase<br/>\nyou?<br/>\nWhat if I had a missle weapon and was singing Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Running<br/>\nbackwards, I am faster than some beasties. By throwing daggers or axes at<br/>\nthem I stay out of range and they take damage. Taking damage they will<br/>\ncontinue to follow me in which case, I will continue to lob whatever I can<br/>\nat them. Is this exploiting a bug? It seems like the same situation, but is<br/>\nnow OK.<br/>\nI am confused and a little scared. Who decides where the fine line between<br/>\nclever and exploitation is? I fear to try new things only to discover that<br/>\nI&#39;ve &#39;cheated&#39; and will now be banned.<br/>\n<br/>\nJourneyman Plastos<br/>\nstill wearing the sandals<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:04 AM 4/27/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;King, Darrin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dking@...\">dking@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kiting is an &quot;exploit,&quot; apparently, officially.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Read the new Guide section on the offical website.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_guidefaq.html\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_guidefaq.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Check this quote about exploits:<br/>\n&gt;Farming - using broken spells or specific spell effects to kill, drag, or<br/>\n&gt;lure monsters, thus gaining experience/loot from them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Boom.
