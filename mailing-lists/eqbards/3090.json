Usually I&#39;m grouped<br/>\nwith the same people, a habit I&#39;m trying to break since they<br/>\nare mostly West coasters and have this annoying habit of<br/>\nkeeping me up until 3 am.  :-)  The number of good people I&#39;ve<br/>\nmet has far exceeded the capacity of my friends list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In my group I tank when needed, and often pull, but the main thing I would guess<br/>\n&gt; people like is the hymn during battle and particularly during downtime, and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally since getting chain at 23rd I use it heavily, as it noticably slows<br/>\n&gt; the attacking monster.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, using Chain and Hymn tend to be exclusive.  Use<br/>\nChain every 3 pulses and the monster will fixate on you after<br/>\nabout two rounds, making Hymn less effective since you&#39;ll be<br/>\nthe only one taking damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it&#39;s important to take note of bad group members. If you have a sole<br/>\n&gt; cleric in your group that never heals and uses all his/her mana on smite, while<br/>\n&gt; you are being beaten to a pulp, do not be so forgiving. That is a TERRIBLE<br/>\n&gt; cleric. Does the wizard overnuke in the beginning of every single battle then<br/>\n&gt; scream for heals? Overnuking every battle is a sign of a poor wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, suggest to them how to be more effective first.  If they<br/>\nstill don&#39;t change, then boot&#39;em.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One of the keys to enjoyment I have found is that when you make mental note of<br/>\n&gt; people that work well with you and you like to play with, tell them so, and<br/>\n&gt; group with them again. Team-oriented players tend to know who other<br/>\n&gt; team-oriented players are, and they all end up in groups together. There is<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s another thing I&#39;ve noticed.  A lot of people are afraid<br/>\nof criticizing how someone else is playing, and so they never<br/>\neven make suggestions that could improve the person&#39;s play.<br/>\nI&#39;d venture to guess that most people only play one or two<br/>\ncharacters, and thus have little or no idea what the issues<br/>\nare that affect the &quot;other&quot; classes (I&#39;m guessing this is why<br/>\na lot of casters seem to be pretty arrogant about tossing<br/>\nspells at stuff melee classes are fighting).  What may be<br/>\nobvious to you when playing as a group may not even register<br/>\nto the other guy.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
