Is twisting a<br/>\nrequirement, can you possible get to 50th level without twisting.  A) I<br/>\nthink twisting might be a slight exploit (Not that I get mad if anyone else<br/>\ndoes it), B) the messages that bards spam in the chat window gets so<br/>\nannoying, and hard to read, I miss a lot of important messages from friends<br/>\nand party members.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it best just to pick the song that best suits what you are doing, and<br/>\nleave it there until something else is needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWenaddar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tLora Roa [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, July 07, 1999 5:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [eqbards] Twisting<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Lora Roa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Depends on whether you&#39;re talking head/eye work or hand/eye twitch speed.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got no problem with concentration.  I do have a problem with having<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;work out my wrists&quot; to learn a repeated pattern.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found some other classes to require concentration, so far not the<br/>\n&gt; twitchiness of Bards, and yes, with hot keys.  I enjoy having to think in<br/>\n&gt; battle.  However, a Bard (unlike other casters) has to twitch to keep up 2<br/>\n&gt; buffs/restores even when resting, and twitches to weave a buff/Selo when<br/>\n&gt; travelling and twitches insanely if twisting and trying melee.  So while<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; other casters, my fingers fly for short fight, they then get to rest while<br/>\n&gt; the party rests.  On Bards I&#39;m finding thats not so.  Seems party<br/>\n&gt; expectations and usefulness are determined by the Bard managing to twist<br/>\n&gt; continously.  Some mid-level Bards feel free to tell me if I&#39;m wrong ..<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; this is what I&#39;m reading here.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a carpal tunnel &quot;dodger&quot; with the ergonomic keyboard, trackball mouse<br/>\n&gt; & pad, proper height chair .. etc ... and a diagnosable mild coordination<br/>\n&gt; problem to boot.  As long as I don&#39;t play &quot;twitch&quot; games (a.k.a. most 1st<br/>\n&gt; person shooters) I do fine.  I guess I&#39;ve just been a little surprised by<br/>\n&gt; the Bard&#39;s need to twist constantly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 03:09 PM 7/7/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Bob Stewart &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstewart@...\">bstewart@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;At 02:02 PM 7/7/99 -0500, Roop Dirump wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Not only that, I think EVERY class has to do something with hot keys<br/>\n&gt; during<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;a battle!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Comparing to real complications, consider a battle cleric, such as played<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by a friend of mine and as I&#39;ve tried some myself.  During combat, while<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you&#39;re hitting and perhaps being hit, you have to keep an eye everyone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;health and if someone is getting too low, target, cast, then return to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;target you were hitting.  Make that worse by using your own damage spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sometimes, balancing that against potentially vital healing.  And you get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to decide what&#39;s &quot;too low.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Makes playing a bard and twisting songs seem easy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;\tBob<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
