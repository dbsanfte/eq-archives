I made over 350pp there<br/>\ntonight, and each of my friends there made over 200pp (I was<br/>\nsoloing a couple hours before the others showed up).  I think<br/>\nmy guild raked in close to 2000pp for the night, as well as 8<br/>\nor 9 lambent stones.  Now if they&#39;ll just fix Genni...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis place is a high level bard&#39;s dream.  Lots of open space<br/>\nto run around in, great cash loot, merchants nearby so you can<br/>\nsell the heavy weapons, etc.  The only down side was that I<br/>\ndied once.  I had two giants fighting each other, then charm<br/>\nwas resisted 4 times in a row, I accidently let Accelerando<br/>\ndrop, and got chain-stunned 3 times, which was long enough for<br/>\nboth giants to kill me.  My group wasn&#39;t able to get within<br/>\nrange to heal me in time.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
