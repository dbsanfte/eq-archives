Bards<br/>\nare not worthless they just don&#39;t get the treatment the class deserves and<br/>\nthat other, better internally represented ones do.  Our issues are never a<br/>\npriority and we generally get the brush-off even after testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ isn&#39;t a horrible game, quite the opposite.  Verant&#39;s customer service and<br/>\ngeneral attitude on the other hand are horrible.  How would you feel if you<br/>\nbought a loaf of bread that was stale and the grocery store told you &quot;sorry,<br/>\nthat&#39;s just the way that bread is&quot;.  Verant does the equivalent to their<br/>\ncustomers every day.  The guild doesn&#39;t dislike EQ, but they would never<br/>\ninvest the time they put into it in another Verant game.  We have been<br/>\ngradually losing members over this for some time now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
