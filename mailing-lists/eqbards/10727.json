It&#39;s tough to describe for those of you who missed it, but<br/>\n&gt;try and picture 60 drunken Gnomes outside the Freeport gates, waving<br/>\n&gt;lutes and charging en masse to Lavastorm.  And boy, did we annoy the Dark<br/>\n&gt;Elves in Nektulos!  (Did you ever notice that Dark Elves have no sense of<br/>\n&gt;humor?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I actually managed to make it to the Temple of Solusek Ro ledge, where I<br/>\n&gt;was able to fling myself into the lava along with perhaps twenty others<br/>\n&gt;that I saw up there.  There was, sadly, a fair amount of attrition along<br/>\n&gt;the way (not unexpected).  I tried to get back two more times, but kept<br/>\n&gt;getting chomped by piranhas in the Nektulos river.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My roommate, who generally raises an eyebrow at this game, watched most<br/>\n&gt;of it and found it hilarious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wanted to thank Aloro, et al, for organizing this, and the E&#39;ci higher<br/>\n&gt;level players who spent several hours helping all of us idiots with<br/>\n&gt;teleports, binding, SOW, beer and lutes.  I&#39;d appreciate it if you E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;bards could pass on my thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
