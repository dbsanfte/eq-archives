Every<br/>\ndeath cost me about a week of play time.<br/>\nOne group I was in, let me die 3 times, with no one else near death (2<br/>\nclerics!), so i bailed.  I&#39;ve nearly lost 20th, now,<br/>\nand have pretty much retired my bard.  (Who ever said 20 wasn&#39;t a hell<br/>\nlevel???).  I&#39;m playing my DE Enchanter now (up to 9th level)<br/>\nLeveling the enchanter is much easier than it was with the bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would LOVE to continue playing my bard, but I can&#39;t figure out how to get<br/>\nexperience, and keep it, especially in pick-up groups.  Unfortunately, most<br/>\nof my guild has surpassed me in levels, and I no longer get xp if I group<br/>\nwith them.  I would love to power-level up to around 25 or so, and join my<br/>\nguildmates, but I have been unable to find anyplace that is not camped to<br/>\nthe hilt on Solusek Ro.  The aviaks are consistently camped, both in South<br/>\nKarana and Lake Rathe.  Solusek A is a death trap.  Likewise, with Unrest<br/>\nand the Cauldron.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone out there has some novel ideas on how to find stuff to solo power<br/>\nlevel with, I would love to hear it.   But, for now, MacGrough is retired<br/>\n(sitting in ButcherBlock after 2 deaths in Cauldron).<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough Mich&#39;Rathe<br/>\n20th Song Bard - Solusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\nAazure<br/>\n9th Spell Enchanter - Solusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: G.W.

Willman, IV&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gww6e@...\">gww6e@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Couple of people have posted and been struggling during the same levels I<br/>\n&gt; had difficulty with the first time around, so I thought I&#39;d drop a few<br/>\ntips<br/>\n&gt; on how and why you should peserve (its amazing what you see in hindsight):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The general concensus is that the time from 19th to 26th is quite<br/>\n&gt; fustrating; you&#39;re at the point were the disparity between your melee and<br/>\n&gt; your tank friends melee prowess begins to show, and yet your songs don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; adiquately compensate for that lost.  Its difficult to find a good group<br/>\n&gt; during this time because this is also the weed out period - worse that<br/>\nhell<br/>\n&gt; levels, the 20&#39;s test your commitiment to that class in my opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At anyrate, your position is clear (push past these levels as quickly as<br/>\n&gt; possible) and while boring, doing the noterious deepwater goblin pets of<br/>\n&gt; Lake Rathetear will get you though it, and will get you out of your rut.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; just checked today as I sold at the ogre camp, 2 pets still run by every 2<br/>\n&gt; mins.  As someone here stated before [referring to hell levels], &#39;Quantity<br/>\n&gt; over quailty.&quot;  Just set up camp right near the ogres on the hill if<br/>\nyou&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; solo, or right at the tree in the gut if you&#39;re in a group and go to work.<br/>\n&gt; You have a convient zone line if something goes wrong and a food and water<br/>\n&gt; vendor literally next door.  You can kill the bandits on the other side of<br/>\n&gt; the gut handily for lunch money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trust me, stay on it, you&#39;ll get through it in about a week with modest<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; time doing the pets and then suddenly your 20&#39;s songs, powered by your new<br/>\n&gt; higher levels, will be more effective and desired in a group (for the<br/>\n&gt; record, besides selo&#39;s, the song I ALWAYS have mem&#39;d: chain, even if I<br/>\n&gt; grouped with 3 rangers and 2 druids you couldn&#39;t pay me to forget the<br/>\nsong.<br/>\n&gt; Just like insurance, ya hope you never have to use it but you don&#39;t leave<br/>\n&gt; home without it.).  I suppose there is an argument to go through these<br/>\n&gt; levels the traditional way, but I did that the first time around -- it was<br/>\n&gt; painful and in the end the only valuable lesson/tactic/govering principle<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; drew from the experience was &quot;Ain&#39;t doing that again!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have fun and good luck,<br/>\n&gt; -GW<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Tork@Nameless&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
