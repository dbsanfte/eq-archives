This has been thoroughly researched by many of us on this <br/>\n     list.  It seems to effect how often the bar is refreshed but does not <br/>\n     actually improve the speed of mana regeneration.  We have conducted <br/>\n     many tests with stopwatches and such.  In fact we have beat the <br/>\n     subject to death..  (he he)  It doesn&#39;t help at all.  Period.  We WISH <br/>\n     it did, in fact it would be a great way to cure the level 15 to 32 no <br/>\n     one wants to party with Bards blues but, sigh, it is not to be.

Well, what this means is:<br/>\n     <br/>\n- If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana <br/>\nregen <br/>\n  (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>\n- If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should <br/>\nincrease at the <br/>\n  same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one) <br/>\n     <br/>\nJust the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even <br/>\nmore critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this <br/>\ninformation, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t <br/>\neven try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still <br/>\nan upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of <br/>\nJaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>\n     <br/>\nAnyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-)<br/>\n     <br/>\nSynedra of Veshaan<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n     <br/>\nONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n     <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
