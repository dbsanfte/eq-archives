They are afraid if they did this - things would<br/>\nstart appearing &quot;generic&quot;, etc.  He pointed out the upcoming zones (I<br/>\nbelieve there are a couple of lower level ones they are working on) and<br/>\n&quot;other things&quot; (which would probably be the server split).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand - perhaps this is a cop-out.  On the other - he does have a<br/>\npoint.  Perhaps a single duplication wouldn&#39;t be bad; but the zone<br/>\nduplication itself could end up being a cop-out.  Instead of really<br/>\naddressing the issue - just keep dup&#39;ing the zones - and out of necessity<br/>\nyou&#39;d always be in the same place - and it all WOULD like the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile their track record in bringing up new servers has been dismal; I<br/>\nbelieve the server splits are probably the best solution.  Once a server<br/>\ngets to a certain threshold of average prime-time utilization - split it<br/>\ninto 2.  But you damn well better make sure all members of a guild end up on<br/>\nthe same server...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they could do this in a timely fashion - that would really solve the<br/>\nproblem...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde 33 of Xegony (Not as bad as Fennin Ro - but bad enough!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Papa Legba&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 26, 2000 10:07 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] My overcrowding solutuion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Papa Legba &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:legba@...\">legba@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This comes from a flippant comment from one of the VErant guys when<br/>\n&gt; talking about over crowding.
