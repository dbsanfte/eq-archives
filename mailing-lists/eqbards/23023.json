But our requests, <br/>\nto be reasonable to Verant, also have to take into account the game balance <br/>\nand try to maintain it&#39;s integrity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe haste suggestions that have been put out there are enticing. I haven&#39;t <br/>\nhad much to say about this thread since I&#39;ve only recently gotten back into <br/>\nconsistently grouping with other people (really, really bored to death with <br/>\ncharm kiting the same old places). My understanding of Verant&#39;s position on <br/>\nthe current state of haste is that it is balanced,  which would seem to <br/>\nindicate that have little inclination to change it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were to be able to give them a compelling reason to change it, which <br/>\nwould improve overall playability but still retain the challenge of the <br/>\ngame, then you would help position your argument to differentiate itself <br/>\nfrom the tons of the bad &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be great&quot; ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
