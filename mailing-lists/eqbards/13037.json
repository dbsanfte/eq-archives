I haven&#39;t seen any clues to either of these<br/>\nitems.  Of course it could well be like the component for the summon corpse<br/>\nspell started out.  They should be in the game, but if GZ even has a<br/>\ndifferent client than every live person out there, chances are there a lot<br/>\nmore things they think they put in that never made it to the live servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll redouble my efforts in looking for them but none of the usual suspect<br/>\nmerchants have them.  maybe if you do one of the quests 30 times you will<br/>\nget one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 12, 2000 12:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Reports of GZ&#39;s test on Veeshan server last night<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf all the people I know on E&#39;ci, Kitasi has done more quests than anyone<br/>\nelse.

I have noticed that a few wierd people sell<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; bardic instruments (Krak in South Karana??) so maybe you need good faction<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; with some of them to get a quest?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIndependent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n        You can even make money by referring friends.<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
