If you were fighting in a dungeon, why would<br/>\nyou leave yourself bound in a city and make the easiest way of getting<br/>\nback to your corpse a cleric res?  That would be silly, especially since<br/>\nyou pointed out that corpse retrieval is much more of the issue.  If you<br/>\nwere in a group, and they need you to help out with retrieval, why would<br/>\nit be in your best interest to waste 30 minutes of the group&#39;s time and<br/>\n600 mana for the druid to go over their, pick you up to the nearest gate,<br/>\nand wait as you run the rest of the way back.<br/>\n\tNo one is saying there aren&#39;t other options other than running<br/>\nfrom freeport to lower guk at the later levels.  However, if you have the<br/>\noption of binding yourself right outside the dungeon, you&#39;d be silly not<br/>\nto do it.  After all, you can&#39;t gate, so the bind is only really useful if<br/>\nyou die.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; With my druid I don&#39;t bind close to where I&#39;m fighting either. Usually<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a druid gate within 2 or 3 zones of where I am, and I&#39;m used to<br/>\n&gt; running that far as a bard anyway so it&#39;s no big deal. Currently my<br/>\n&gt; druid is bound in quenos and fighting on Faydwer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tDruids and wizards are the only exceptions I can think of to this,<br/>\nbecause they are pretty much self sufficient in getting back to the<br/>\ndungeons they&#39;re fighting in.  But more often than not, they are bound to<br/>\nplaces they can&#39;t be easily with their teleports (right outside Permafrost<br/>\nand the Molten Cloak room in Sol A come to mind).  One is so they can<br/>\naccess the zone that is furtherest from a teleport point, the other is<br/>\ndeep in a dungeon so they don&#39;t have to fight all the way down to check on<br/>\na single spawn.<br/>\n\tAs a druid, being bound in butcher is no different than being<br/>\nbound right outside a dungeon.  Since that&#39;s true, why not make it easier<br/>\nfor your party.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Windryder<br/>\nLvl 50 Cleric<br/>\nLvl 14 Bard<br/>\nInnoruuk Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
