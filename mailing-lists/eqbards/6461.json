As Athren Notechaser experienced (and reported <br/>\non this list) this also means that if you have SoW up and are rooted, you <br/>\ncannot break the root with Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next obvious question is, will Selo&#39;s still break roots when there&#39;s no <br/>\nSoW?  Anyone who has done so since the patch, please reassure me on this... <br/>\n= )<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
