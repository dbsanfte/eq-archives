I&#39;ve read thru Necromonitor plenty of times (nice heavy <br/>\ntraffic there), among other sites and tho I think they are whiny, I also <br/>\nbelieve they have plenty to whine about (thx nerf #45696083590 VERANT!). <br/>\nSeriously, they should start cataloguing necro nerfs. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t <br/>\nstart one as I would have probably deleted him by now out of frustration <br/>\nwith Verant&#39;s &quot;enhancements&quot;. Bards have issues, but not as many because we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have quite the number of spells at our disposal that could possibly be <br/>\nbroken, nor do we have a built-in tank to bitch about. The difference is <br/>\nwhen one of our songs is busted our bitching is rightfully magnified by <br/>\nvirtue that we have only 1 or 2 songs per level compared to every other <br/>\nmagic-capable class in the game. Anyways, my post was in response to a <br/>\nrediculous waste of bandwidth on a stupid subject.

Im subscribed to both the bard and necro mailing<br/>\n&gt;list, and well, to make it plain and obvious for you, the bard msg board is<br/>\n&gt;way more of a whiny tune then the necro one. And I&#39;ve been a bard way <br/>\n&gt;longer<br/>\n&gt;then a necro so dont think im saying this because im a necro. I just find<br/>\n&gt;there&#39;s more whining on this board, you wouldnt beleive how many threads<br/>\n&gt;i&#39;ve deleted sometimes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Rakka 51 necro<br/>\n&gt;-Minkin 36 bard<br/>\n&gt;Sol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
