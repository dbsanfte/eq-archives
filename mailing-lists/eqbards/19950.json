That is part of playing on Test. It is one of the things you agree<br/>\nto. I played on Test for a while (Faesong started there got a bubble or so<br/>\nfrom 17 before I decided to recreate her on Sol Ro) It was accepted that<br/>\nVerant could do anything they wanted with<br/>\nTest. Its not a production server. They HAVE done player wipes before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Heacock   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a><br/>\nMeara Daring, level 28 Enchanter, Master Jeweler, owner Meara&#39;s Boutique of<br/>\nMystiques, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaerain Wanderer, level 20 Soldier of Tunare, Phoenix, Solusek Ro /<br/>\nFaesong, level 17 HalfElf Bard of Solusek Ro, Phoenix, Solusek Ro (Qeynos) /<br/>\nJidranth, lvl 8 Iskar Warrior, Solusek Ro, Phoenix /<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
