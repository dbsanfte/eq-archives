Everyone would earn their own items.  THis<br/>\nway there would be little trouble with lvl 50&#39;s coming blitzing through<br/>\ndungeons.  It still would happen (if they needed a certain item for<br/>\nthemself), but would not be common.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is coming from a player who has benefited greatly from (re)starting<br/>\nthe game late in the cycle, thus having equipment well beyond my level<br/>\ncapability.  (I am a 17 bard is as much bronze as I can wear, BS mantle,<br/>\nfs spear, dwarven mace, tent whipe, jagged bands).  I would not mind<br/>\ngiving that all up for banded/lether a combine sword (which I&#39;ve made<br/>\nplently of money to buy had I wanted one)...  In fact sometime i think I<br/>\nshould have started on a new server since I wouldn&#39;t have the option to<br/>\nget this stuff...<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
