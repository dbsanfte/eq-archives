Two people playing 4 characters is <br/>\na little ridiculous to me, especially on any serious raid. For one of those <br/>\npeople to be the guild leader makes me shudder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have made the same decision had I been in your shoes Brilinnia. I <br/>\nhope your guildleader hopefully has learned a lesson from this incident and <br/>\nthat your guild can continue to travel the breadth of Norrath in camaraderie.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:10 AM 2/12/01 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Looks pretty simple to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Chanter #1 is being played, and died doing his job.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Chanter #2 is there only because someone has multiple computers with<br/>\n&gt;multiple accounts, and is doing nothing, and continued to do nothing despite<br/>\n&gt;the fact that your group was being overrun, and was even gated out safe and<br/>\n&gt;sound.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m a bit surprised that the leader of a guild that attracts people such as<br/>\n&gt;yourself would be the center of such a disagreement.

We had 2 groups together in<br/>\n&gt;Howling Stones North Tower. One group had a L44 chanter, a 50s shaman, a 50s<br/>\n&gt;warrior, 50s cleric all played by 2 people plus a 50s wiz. The chanter<br/>\n&gt;really didn&#39;t function as a chanter and we&#39;d asked them not to bring her<br/>\n&gt;along as we had a real working chanter in our group. We got to the last<br/>\n&gt;corner before the Crypt keeper&#39;s room and when the monk pulled it, the whole<br/>\n&gt;room came. We killed the Crypt Keeper but had alot of mobs on us. Our<br/>\n&gt;chanter was doing his best to pause/mez what he could. Then the hallway<br/>\n&gt;started to respawn and we had 8 -10 mobs. Our chanter died, I was doing what<br/>\n&gt;I could but out numbered by live awake mobs. We called for gates and the<br/>\n&gt;other groups wiz got them out. We all died. The necro in our group looted<br/>\n&gt;the chanter robe (Siren&#39;s?) off the keeper before he died and I got the key<br/>\n&gt;before I died rather than have it poof. The aftermath was they wanted to<br/>\n&gt;lotto the robe between the chanter twink and the chanter who died doing CC.<br/>\n&gt;We felt this would be very wrong yet they didn&#39;t see it. We felt the twink,<br/>\n&gt;while there when the robe dropped, was not being played, else we probably<br/>\n&gt;would not have been wiped out. We also all know that char is a twink, not a<br/>\n&gt;primary. I think that robe on a twink would hurt our guild&#39;s credibility<br/>\n&gt;somewhat as the twink belongs to the head of the guild. It&#39;s also our<br/>\n&gt;opinion you can&#39;t function as a good chanter unless the person is giving the<br/>\n&gt;character their whole attention. I&#39;d like to hear the opinion of others on<br/>\n&gt;this. Were we out of line?<br/>\n&gt;The result was I said we&#39;d walk on the guild if they insisted on lottoing<br/>\n&gt;it. They agreed to give the robe to the other chanter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\n&gt;Excalibur, Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
