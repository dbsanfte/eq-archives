I&#39;d only try weaving a second song with Lullaby in<br/>\ncertain situations (casters nuking the party = Lullaby/Rhythm,<br/>\neveryone but me at low hp = Lullaby/Hymn).  Pixie Strike was<br/>\nconsistent enought that I&#39;d frequently weave two other songs<br/>\nwith Strike, or even keep three low-blue mobs asleep (same as<br/>\nyou can do with a L4 enchanter spell, so there&#39;s no balance<br/>\nissue).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn its current buggy state, the consequences of letting a<br/>\nStrike exire are so dire (basically 15-30 seconds trying to<br/>\nget it asleep again) that I won&#39;t risk weaving more than one<br/>\nsong with it, which as you point out makes the song rather<br/>\npointless in lieu of Lullaby.  As I said before, I&#39;m finding<br/>\nthat I take so much damage trying to get the first Strike to<br/>\nstick that it&#39;s often more effective just to charm the mob,<br/>\nor let it beat up on a real tank the entire fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
