When you can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1539990229\">I think the disagreement comes from the different backgrounds.  I&#39;m <br/>\nsure AL heavily recruits the top raid classes (Warriors, Rogues, <br/>\nClerics).  When you can pick and choose what classes you want present <br/>\non a raid and there&#39;s only a certain number of people you want to <br/>\ntake, then Bards are not needed (after 1), nor missed.  Most guilds <br/>\nare not in that position... the &quot;uber&quot; guild I went on a few raids <br/>\nwith (Yelinak, Dain, etc.) before I semi-retired didn&#39;t have 19 <br/>\nRogues to pick from, they kinda made use of whoever was available.  I <br/>\nwas in the group with the tanks taking damage.  I played Rondo + <br/>\nPsalm with Puretone (and meleed til Epic proc).  When I was swapping <br/>\nhotkeys around prior to one battle and accidentally burned Puretone, <br/>\nthe raid leader said, &quot;There goes ?k damage&quot; (I don&#39;t remember the <br/>\nexact # - maybe 8k?).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you&#39;re in AL or FoH or the ultimate top dog guild on a server <br/>\nwho has access to whatever number of class/level player they want, <br/>\nthen Bards aren&#39;t needed.  But, if you&#39;re in a guild that will make <br/>\nuse out of you if you show up, then Bards can have a significant role <br/>\non the raid.  By significant, I mean doing something other than <br/>\nbuffing and watching or pumping mana during the whole fight.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nclaim that a Rogue in that spot wouldn&#39;t be better... just that we&#39;re <br/>\nnot completely worthless like some classes....<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, does the VP Mage Staff block Rondo or Psalms?  If not, isn&#39;t <br/>\nmore DS always better??<br/>\n<br/>\nDark<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At the time I quit there were 4 bards in the guild: me, Thott, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jaco, Syren all 60 but me hehe.  As of a week ago, there was 1 bard, <br/>\nThott.  I quit, Syren moved and had no ISP for 4 months, and Jaco <br/>\nquit because he was tired of being in the buff group.  So for 4 <br/>\nmonths AL had 1 bard (Syren just came back this week).  If bards were <br/>\nas needed as many think, would AL of all guilds only have 1 bard for <br/>\n4 months and have accomplished what they have?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shada/Erisi </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
