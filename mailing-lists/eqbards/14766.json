There&#39;s a buggy wall somewhere<br/>\non the dead side, where live side mobs can aggro on you.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen three live side trains, mostly stuff from the elder<br/>\nroom, run into the savant/executioner/cavalier area.  One<br/>\nhappened to a group I was in (I was leaving and saw it all run<br/>\npast me, then I saw my group all die), and I assure you we<br/>\nwere not pulling from the live side.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend and I were working our way to the mino elder once<br/>\nfrom the dead side.  We were having a close but in-hand fight<br/>\nagainst two frogs (I was charming one) in the hall before the<br/>\nroom leading to the mino elder.  Somehow the elder aggroed on<br/>\nme through the wall, and teleported on top of me.  Things went<br/>\ndownhill quick from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
