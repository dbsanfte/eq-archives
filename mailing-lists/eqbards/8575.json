Don&#39;t know them too<br/>\nwell but they they are roughly equal near 30.  Saw Cappenvarra charm them<br/>\nand fight among themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nBroon - wuss clops lives in Eastern Plain of Karana - starting spawn spot in<br/>\nriver North of wooden bridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nDroon -  Broon&#39;s older bro - when broon is blue to you droon is yellow (I<br/>\nstarted fighting Broon high 20&#39;s and lo 30&#39;s - a mob of mixed 20&#39;s can<br/>\nprolly take broon)<br/>\n<br/>\nProon - papa of Broon and Droon - deeeeeeeeeeeeep red (40+) just zone or<br/>\n/tell merlain come kill proon PLEASE!!! zoning<br/>\n<br/>\nBroon hunting 101<br/>\n<br/>\nGet a partner: tanks are good, druids are good, rangers too, never had a<br/>\ncaster to try it with but prolly ok but risky for caster.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind Broon in river and pull him out (trust me). Kill him: chain or snare,<br/>\nfear and bellow and melee, chords if you have a clear spot to fight.  Loot<br/>\nfast! Make sure you are well away from his spawn spot because Droon respawns<br/>\nin river real fast and can jump u b4 u are healed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet Droon go unattacked and he will vanish in a minute or two.  Mean while<br/>\nrun to the Highhold ramp and camp at the mouth of the lower canyon.  Prolly<br/>\npolite to warn zone to stay clear of the lower canyon.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery 8 minutes Broon will respawn in the lower canyon and come lumbering<br/>\nout.  Chain/snare, Fear, DoT, Melee, Kill, rinse, repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoot is crap - small coins and occasional rusty.  Well your weps would be<br/>\nrusty too if you stood in the river most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time I did loot a Top Knot Cap (ac 3 non-visible when worn) from a clops<br/>\nbut for the life of me I cant remember which clops - I do think it was in EK<br/>\nzone and near HH ramp.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJason Osborne [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jasono@...\">jasono@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tTuesday, October 12, 1999 10:11 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Call for help!
