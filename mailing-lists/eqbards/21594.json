I sometimes get too<br/>\nengrossed in the &quot;technical&quot; aspects of the game!   Now that I think about<br/>\nit, some of the most enjoyable hunts I have participated in are those that I<br/>\nsit back and be a bard, just sing, play my instruments and get comments like<br/>\n&quot;Damn!  You were doing so much damage I couldn&#39;t taunt him off you!&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;Wow!  Look at my resistances!  I am resisting everything cast at me!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhen I play my bard in a &quot;pure&quot; manner...i.e. no weapons just<br/>\ninstruments..it is extrememly satisfying.  However, I am not saying give us<br/>\nan &quot;uber-weapon&quot; with an &quot;uber-instrument&quot; combined.  A weapon with a &quot;base&quot;<br/>\ninstrument magnification...for example a &quot;percussion&quot; hammer that does 1hb<br/>\nplus same magnification of a hand drum...would allow those who like to be<br/>\nbattle-bards to wade in with a weapon and still have instrument effects.<br/>\nThis would not take away from the awesome power of a &quot;Selos Drum of the<br/>\nMarch&quot; at all..since by far the selos drum would be better.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJust my two copper pieces.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
