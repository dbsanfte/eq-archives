It seems to me<br/>\nthough that the whip is a big stamina drainer and I&#39;ll probably be looking<br/>\nto replace it soon, it was a gift though, so I cannot complain too much.<br/>\nI&#39;ll probably end up keeping the mace and the dirk for a long while as<br/>\nthey seem to do the job pretty well and a lot of the &#39;better&#39; stuff seems<br/>\nto cost more than I&#39;ve gathered throughout my career.  The dirk I bought<br/>\nfor 40 if I recall correctly, the mace for 230 (though I have heard that<br/>\nthe mace can sometimes go for a lot more.)<br/>\nUnless I&#39;m really focusing on raising my piercing, I just leave the dirk<br/>\nin my off hand (as it&#39;s the fastest of the three and thus has the best<br/>\nchance of being useful) and swap the mace and the whip in my primary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTimmian Trueheart<br/>\nErollisi Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Douglas Drew &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Douglas.A.Drew@...\">Douglas.A.Drew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings all,<br/>\n&gt; Hail and well met everyone ) I&#39;m a new member to this list and I play a<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 18th Song. I was wondering if anyone had any preferences as to<br/>\n&gt; what weapons you Duel Wield. Currently I am using a PGT and Combine<br/>\n&gt; Scimitar. The only other character I have is a Cleric so I really don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have much experience with melee weaps and though I expect I will be playing<br/>\n&gt; instruments most of the time, I was wondering what you all use.  Any<br/>\n&gt; suggestions? Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Konus<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 18th Song<br/>\n&gt; The Rathe </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
