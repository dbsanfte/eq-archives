On the other hand,<br/>\n&gt; the newbies didn&#39;t play for two nights before they figured <br/>\n&gt; out that the the reason everyone else was so<br/>\n&gt; much faster was the &quot;run&quot; button.  Nor did they wander into <br/>\n&gt; Nek forest thinking how cool it was that there<br/>\n&gt; were Guards to protect them, only to spend the next 3 hours <br/>\n&gt; retrieving corpses.  Nor did they spend hours<br/>\n&gt; of time on boats importing derv rings to GFay (1pp apiece).  <br/>\n&gt; Nor were they ecstatic to buy their first<br/>\n&gt; piece of Banded at level 18 (15pp for a bracer, thanks price <br/>\n&gt; fixing).  Nor did they train Smithing to 125<br/>\n&gt; before cntl-click (you had to move the slider down to pick <br/>\n&gt; one thing off a stack).  And the list goes on.<br/>\n&gt; I did rather lazily level my Warrior to 38 in 12 days, with <br/>\n&gt; no help but twinked equipment, and my Druid to<br/>\n&gt; 24 in 3.5 days, ditto, so a lot of it is equipment, <br/>\n&gt; knowledge, and better hunting areas. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
