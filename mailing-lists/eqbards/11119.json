Here&#39;s what GZ said regarding Selo&#39;s breaking root a<br/>\nlittle while back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElwyn: It has been the case (since release) that playing Selo&#39;s when in an<br/>\noutdoor zone, would &#39;break&#39; the effects of the root spell.  With a recent<br/>\npatch, this is no longer the case.  Was it a bug that it broke root<br/>\noriginally, or is it a bug that now it doesn&#39;t?  When could we expect a fix<br/>\nfor this if it is a bug?<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ: Selo&#39;s breaking root has been back and forth since Beta 1.
