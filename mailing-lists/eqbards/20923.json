John Kim and myself have broken the things<br/>\ndown statistically to the point where it was readily apparent that the<br/>\nresist rates were down to tenths of a percent with variances of +/- 2 tenths<br/>\nof a percent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is ABSOLUTELY no way they can claim they don&#39;t know what we think is<br/>\nwrong with these songs and still be truthful.  They ARE ignoring us.<br/>\n(Harmonic is gone right?  If not, my apologies Harm)<br/>\nWell maybe they aren&#39;t ignoring us, but in that case they are purposely<br/>\nlying to us instead.  I prefer to assume the former.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi Faegehearper<br/>\n<br/>\n1) They aren&#39;t ignoring us. Instead they just have no idea that we think<br/>\nthere is a problem that needs to be looked at. Abashi is a busy man, I&#39;m<br/>\nwilling to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that he missed our<br/>\nposts or forgot them.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) If we can make them aware of what we think is wrong, then we can get them<br/>\nto look at it and there is a possibility that we can get it fixed. This to<br/>\nme is good news. The only problem is how to get our thoughts looked at. I<br/>\nsuggest we write up a concise description of the problems. (insane resist<br/>\nrates on pixie strike and lullaby and ineffectiveness of snare since the<br/>\npatch) then we post it to the bug board and the gameplay board, as well as<br/>\nemailing it to abashi.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
