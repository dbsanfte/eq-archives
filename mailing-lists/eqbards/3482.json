At level 25 in Permafrost I was able to sleep at<br/>\nleast 4 ice goblins while my party beat the ice cubes out of a fifth. They<br/>\nwould occasionally wake up and slap me but they would usually go right back<br/>\nto sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, one thing I will note is that I&#39;ve heard time and again how we only<br/>\ncan sleep up to 4 creatures at a time. In Permafrost I fired up Lullaby<br/>\namidst a train of 11 mixed goblins and got a &#39;nods&#39; message from 9 of them.<br/>\nI can&#39;t confirm if they were actually sleeping or if I was just receiving<br/>\nthe wrong message since my party was actively getting the hell outta Dodge.<br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGood Journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8)-----Original Message-----<br/>\n8)From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a>]<br/>\n8)Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 1:43 PM<br/>\n8)To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n8)Subject: [eqbards] Lullaby and good night go to..

I grant<br/>\n8)that it should have limited duration and I can accept that it<br/>\n8)should make you<br/>\n8)unpopular.  BUT I personally think it is FAR below what it<br/>\n8)should be.  For one<br/>\n8)thing it&#39;s duration is FAR shorter then the Laments even with<br/>\n8)a lute. Two as a<br/>\n8)constant song even a creature that breaks out should be<br/>\n8)subject to the song<br/>\n8)again every pulse otherwise like Lament it should be a single<br/>\n8)pulse song just<br/>\n8)area effect.  I&#39;m not asking for a god song mind you but I<br/>\n8)also don&#39;t think<br/>\n8)the creature should really want to kill the bard more then<br/>\n8)the person pounding<br/>\n8)on it. Let me give two case examples.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
