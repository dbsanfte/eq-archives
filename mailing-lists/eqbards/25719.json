First of all - AOE slow.<br/>\nThose mobs are gonna be hitting low HP casters - so slows important.   AT 48<br/>\nSelo&#39;s Cessation has a slow, a snare, and a DOT.  Drop the DOT for better<br/>\nslow and snare at 54.  Denon&#39;s Discord gives some AoE Dottage.  And you can<br/>\nthrow in the level 2 AOE Dot for yucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the best thing for pulling?  You can only sing it during daytime - but<br/>\nreally the only use of Song of Highsun (56) is for PBAOE pulling.  It gates<br/>\nmobs back to their spawn points and DOESN&#39;T clear agro.  The mob will come<br/>\nback with as many friends as he can find between you and his spawn point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt night - sing Song of Midnight - Selo&#39;s and Fears mobs - they&#39;ll run away<br/>\nFAST and come back with friends as well...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Katye and Brandon [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:landmax13@...\">landmax13@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 07, 2002 8:09 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] bards in AoE groups<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom what I&#39;ve heard (not experienced yet) you probably won&#39;t even be<br/>\npulling, the wizards will with dd spells...<br/>\n<br/>\nyou will be the mana provider and straggler chaser more than likely...<br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s supposed to be just incredible XP for higher levels, have a cleric<br/>\nfriend who is doing it and getting enough to make it worthwhile for him at<br/>\n52...<br/>\n<br/>\nRaub<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:52 PM 01/07/2002 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have any of you guys ever been into AoE groups? i bet you have ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;well i have been invited many times but never had the opportunity to join<br/>\n&gt;one, though they say bards are needed. now i am not sure how aoe groups<br/>\n&gt;exactly work and what a bards role in such a group is, so any advice is<br/>\n&gt;welcome.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i only know the bard should pull a lot of mobs, which get chainstunned by 2<br/>\n&gt;chanters and then smoked by 3 AoE nukers. but do i sing anything else? any<br/>\n&gt;special hint?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;so long<br/>\n&gt;tobi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
