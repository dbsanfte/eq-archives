Why are people so\r<br/>\n&gt; upset about this being fixed?  It has historically been referred to as\r<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find it.\tWell,\r<br/>\n&gt; its been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work that way and\r<br/>\n&gt; everyone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask them to fix\r<br/>\n&gt; bugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* bug!&quot;  A bug\r<br/>\n&gt; is a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of\r<br/>\n&gt; our overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.  Could happen.\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*snip*\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhy you ask are we concerned ohh let me count the ways. Verant has a history of EVERY time they nerf a power (not always a spell mind you) that relates in anyway to a bards powers of breaking the bard.  Don&#39;t believe me allow me to cite a few examples.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSpell refresh in order to prevent chain casting a delay was set to all casters where the spell while depressed would not actaully effect.  Result Bard song worked one beat.. This was at times called the scream heard round norrath as hundreds of bards across the servers valiantly fired up arias aire and plumeted to the ground after the first time out because the song would not refresh.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSecondary chain casting fix in order to prevent chain casting items and spells.. items stoped procing with bard song active.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are tons more but these make the point best.  Verant&#39;s test staff is  let me make this clear universally view as incompetent because there has never been a patch that actaully works as intended.  Further Verant has done nothing but weaken and nerf the bard since day one always claiming balance that is also considered by most bards to be unfounded.  The only true benifit I can recall has been the addition of see invis to our invis song since it did not stack. and that was 4 patches to get right</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
