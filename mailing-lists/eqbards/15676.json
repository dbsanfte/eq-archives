All the overcrowding<br/>\nand camping IMHO made for really sloppy play.  If things had<br/>\nnever gotten that bad, you would only see Ykeshas and such in<br/>\nthe hands of people who knew what they were doing (or knew<br/>\nsomeone who knew what they were doing).  Mistmoore is a lot<br/>\nlike that - buggy enough to be deadly if you were stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, here&#39;s a tip with Pixie Strike.  Once you target a<br/>\nmob and start a targeted song, you don&#39;t have to keep it<br/>\ntargeted.  You can switch to a different target, attack,<br/>\netc. and the Pixie Strike will still hit the mob you had<br/>\ntargeted when you started the song.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;ll usually do if I&#39;m doing both crowd and runner<br/>\ncontrol is Strike, but retarget the mob everyone else is<br/>\nfighting and monitor it&#39;s hp bar.  When it gets near the point<br/>\nwhere it&#39;d start to run, I switch to a PS/Chain cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Pixie Strike<br/>\n- wait for the nods message (so I still have it targeted if<br/>\nit&#39;s resisted, since it fails way more than Chain)<br/>\n- target the mob that will run<br/>\n- start Chain<br/>\n- immediately switch back to the mob I&#39;m PSing<br/>\n<br/>\nrepeat<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral classes also have quick-casting stun spells which can<br/>\nbe used to stop runners.  These can usually give you enough<br/>\ntime to get a Chain or root cast.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
