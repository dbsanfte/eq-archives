Today (or<br/>\n&gt; pretty close, their records got messed up) marked my 6 month anniversary<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; a Guide on the Tarew Marr server.  It also marked my last day as a Guide,<br/>\n&gt; as I felt that I could no longer in good conscience support a company that<br/>\n&gt; chooses to treat it&#39;s customers in so heavy-handed a manner with no<br/>\n&gt; consideration for the consequences.  This refers to both the recent<br/>\nbanning<br/>\n&gt; issues (more than just Mystere were banned over this), and the Bard issues<br/>\n&gt; thread.  It is my belief that Everquest truly IS their world, and as such,<br/>\n&gt; I have no place being in it.  I haven&#39;t paid Verant a dime in 6 months,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not about to start today, so this was my last day on Norrath as a<br/>\n&gt; player, as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really believed that I could make a difference in Everquest as a Guide -<br/>\n&gt; not just by summoning corpses, but also by being a good source of input<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; things that needed to be fixed or changed.  I&#39;m well-versed in diplomacy<br/>\n&gt; (being the Herald for my local LARP Kingdom), and I was very eager to make<br/>\n&gt; the world a better place.  Unfortunately, from day one, my rose-coloured<br/>\n&gt; glasses suffered some pretty potent tarnish.  While in IRC, being given<br/>\n&gt; instructions on what NOT to do as a Guide (&quot;no hunting, no looting, and<br/>\n&gt; above all, no fighting with players!!!&quot;), I was also online on my other<br/>\n&gt; computer (Love having two windows machines!).  As I was playing my<br/>\n&gt; enchanter, I heard the shout that there was a &quot;Giant GM&quot; on the loose in<br/>\n&gt; the Arena, so I invis&#39;d myself and ran there. (why the invis? I dunno...<br/>\n&gt; Just didn&#39;t want to attract any attention to myself, and didn&#39;t realize at<br/>\n&gt; the time that GMs can see invis all the time.)<br/>\n&gt; When I got there, I saw the giant GM - 3 stories tall, at least!, and he<br/>\n&gt; was in the process of giving a warning to a rude player who was exploiting<br/>\n&gt; the arena (charming the lower level guy every time he tried to retrieve<br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; corpse).  While I grant that the player was being rude, and certainly<br/>\n&gt; deserved the warning, what happened next was totally uncalled for.  The GM<br/>\n&gt; followed up his verbal warning with a spell (some kind of knockback that<br/>\n&gt; does damage), nearly killing the offending player.  I was stunned.  I<br/>\n&gt; immediately did a direct tell to a GM in the IRC room asking for<br/>\n&gt; clairification on this, and at first, until they heard the GMs name, they<br/>\n&gt; acted somewhat shocked.  When they realized it was a programmer GM, they<br/>\n&gt; suddenly backed off and said that &quot;well, GM&#39;s know what they&#39;re doing -<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not our place to question that.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; This, incidentally, was less than two weeks after several guides were<br/>\n&gt; banned for fighting players in the Arena.  Even the Guides who were brand<br/>\n&gt; new and just following their leader were suspended, and removed from the<br/>\n&gt; Guide Program.<br/>\n&gt; Basicallly I guess what I&#39;m saying here is that *even then*, the hypocrisy<br/>\n&gt; ran rampant, and that sort of attitude really ticks me off.  I&#39;m not going<br/>\n&gt; to turn into any sort of Tweety, but I&#39;m also not going to candy-coat<br/>\n&gt; it.  Verant&#39;s version of social engineering made me sick to my stomach,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; I refuse to be a part of that orwellian nightmare.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another interesting note is that when I posted my letter of resignation to<br/>\n&gt; the Guide board (which wasn&#39;t nearly as vitriolic as this one - but it did<br/>\n&gt; include the phrase &quot;rampant hypocrisy&quot;), it was deleted inside of 3<br/>\n&gt; minutes.  I had to severely water it down before I posted it again to<br/>\n&gt; ensure that it would stay up there.  Way to control information, Big<br/>\n&gt; Brother Verant.  Ignorance is Bliss.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will remain on the list as an active moderator, and to share Bard<br/>\n&gt; stories, perhaps even get some input on Bards for my new project, but my<br/>\nEQ<br/>\n&gt; career is over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sweet Songs and Light Laughter,<br/>\n&gt; Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt; formerly<br/>\n&gt; Jalviv the Just of Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
