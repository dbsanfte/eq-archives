Bards are good at being <br/>\n&gt; social. In fact,<br/>\n&gt; I built them to be so. This is my current one - I have played <br/>\n&gt; a lot of EQ,<br/>\n&gt; and tend to change my opinion every few weeks. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elwyn Heartstring<br/>\n&gt; Level 48 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
