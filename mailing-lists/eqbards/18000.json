In HK there are 5 spots in order of increasing difficulty: Lookout room (2 spawn), Guard","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-695419956\">Ahhh good old HK, man oh man have I spent hours and hours in there...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn HK there are 5 spots in order of increasing difficulty: Lookout room (2<br/>\nspawn), Guard room (3 or 4 spawn), Warrior room (3 or 4 spawn), Ramp (1 or 2<br/>\nspawn) & Raider room (4 spawn).  At 27, you can get exp in War room or<br/>\nRaider room.  Depending on how many in the group and who well they have the<br/>\nspawn separated in time, you can be fighting singles or multiples.  A full<br/>\ngroup with some decent healing can prolly handle even a 3 spawn if they<br/>\n/assist and kill quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though you hear alot of casting from other rooms (up stairs, etc), AE<br/>\nis quite safe to use in HK pickclaw rooms.  never once have I pulled or<br/>\nagro&#39;d an &quot;accountant&quot; or any of the names you hear casting from the<br/>\npickclaw rooms.  Sometimes mobs will get trained to the guards and the<br/>\nguards will chase resetting mobs down to the ramp even and then you have to<br/>\nbe carefull.  More than once, I chased a train up to the guards and oppsie!<br/>\nI had Largos playing and Capt Bozek took exception to his part time worker<br/>\n(me).  But down in the rooms with with multi-mobs, AE is fine as long as you<br/>\ncoordinate with the others in your group.  Ie, if use /assist and dont<br/>\ncancel each others spells (chain vs snare vs darkness, largos vs other<br/>\nslowing spells, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a good healer, you might want to try all instrument attack: CoD,<br/>\nDDD, Largos and swap lute and brass horn. Or CoD, Hymn, DDD.  The psalm of<br/>\nwarmth and the damage shield is a good thought.  When I was tank heavy, I<br/>\nplayed chant and guardian with a drum for tank stats and ac and mr as you<br/>\nget some caster gobs too.  And I would tell my group to look at their stats<br/>\nwhen i was playing with drum equipped so they could see the great effects<br/>\n(little did they know that agi dex were not really doing all that much.) So,<br/>\nin retrospect, Anthem with the wep speed buff is maybe better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, something I think that gets overlooked is Jig.  If your group is<br/>\nswinging heavy weps and losing sta, they may not realize what happens -<br/>\ntheir dmg goes down as their speed gets slower.  Yes, they keep swinging but<br/>\nthey get slower and slower.  So, find out if they are dropping below a bub<br/>\nof sta and have jig ready to weave in for a few ticks and you can keep their<br/>\ndmg output maxxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 27, you have 3 songs that can do damage: CoD (2), BBB (12) & DDD<br/>\n(18).  You could go with all 3 and instruments and see:  18 + 15 + 23 for 56<br/>\nmax dmg per tick or 560 dmg per minute.  You probably need a good healer to<br/>\nkeep you alive if there are 2 or more gobs in the fight.  So, perhaps have 2<br/>\ntactics, all instrument max damage for single mob fights and party buff/dmg<br/>\nshield & largos to slow for multi-mob fights.  Also, it will depend on the<br/>\nroom you are in.  In the raider room mobs will resist more.  In the war room<br/>\nor guard room, they will be lower levels and your songs will stick better.<br/>\nYou need to have a different strategy for fighting reds vs fighting blues -<br/>\ngenerally you switch to more melee and party buff/heal for the yellow and<br/>\nreds (and dmg shields are not usually resisted so they are always good).<br/>\n<br/>\nSee <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/songdmg.asp\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/songdmg.asp</a> for est damage numbers for<br/>\nsongs at various levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some ideas for you - good luck and let us know what works best for<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 19, 2000 11:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Highpass Keep<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I know we have covered this before but I have been looking for a while and<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t find the thread.
