Most of the mobs are<br/>\nnot casters and I&#39;ve never had a problem with agro there. There are several<br/>\nmobs to watch out for though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorry Wraiths are enchanters. They will Gravity Flux. I usually throw<br/>\nguardian into the mix vs them just to make sure no one gets tossed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTentacle Tormentors will AE dispell. They are highly annoying and also have<br/>\nthe knockback spell that Tentacle Terrors seem to delight in using against<br/>\nme when I was a young bard in Najena. My guild went on Tuesday and by<br/>\nsinging Verses of Victory, Guardian Rythmns and Niv&#39;s my group went 6 for 7<br/>\non exp with TTs. I attribute it to us being the only group that was hasted<br/>\nthroughout the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhoboplasms also dispell, but I&#39;m pretty sure they are targeted.<br/>\n<br/>\nScarelings (nicknamed asslings) are annoying to fight because they run<br/>\naround a lot, but they aren&#39;t that tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmygdalian Knights are casters also. They are always trying to mana drain<br/>\nme, but I always seem to resist. They have skele pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually I&#39;ll sing Guardian, Nivs and another song dependant on my group in<br/>\nhate. Often times that third song is haste because we seem to be short on<br/>\nenchanters. During downtime it&#39;s usually just mana song, with the occaisonal<br/>\nPsalm of Vitality to shirk off disease. (from fetid fiends)<br/>\n<br/>\nHate is much harder. First off, in Hate you are usually fighting in a very<br/>\nsmall space. Shoving 30 people into a room the size of the bard&#39;s guild in<br/>\nqeynos makes for some interesting fights. Secondly the mobs in Hate are much<br/>\ntougher.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a bard the most important piece of advice I can give you is DO NOT SING<br/>\nwhen Revenants are being pulled. Revs HATE bards. They are tough to mez and<br/>\nwill come after you with a vengenance. Once they are all safely mezzed you<br/>\ncan fire up your songs, just be careful because they will probably gun for<br/>\nyou when mez breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the other Hate mobs don&#39;t seem to have a predilection for bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll link you to the guide to Hate written by a guildmate of mine which<br/>\nborrows from another guide written by a different friend of mine. The<br/>\ndescriptions of the mobs are dead on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pages.prodigy.net/maximanova/Hate_Guide.htm\">http://pages.prodigy.net/maximanova/Hate_Guide.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have virtually no exp in air, so I&#39;ll leave that to someone else to<br/>\ncomment on.<br/>\n<br/>\nDraelon Stormsong<br/>\nSemi Retired Minstrel<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mott, Mike J.

I have seen various bards comment about not singing<br/>\nduring pulls etc. while in the planes, but what I would really like is a<br/>\nsynopis of &quot;bard tactics&quot; while in Fear, Hate and Sky.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few of you guys up for the task?
