What I do<br/>\nwant is to be Bound anywhere, not have that ability to do it myself. I want<br/>\nto be able to go to guk and get my buddy to bind me at the zoneline, same as<br/>\nhe would do to me in the city. As a warrior, without equip I am useless<br/>\n(reality). No songs, no invis, nada. So instead of respawning and ready to<br/>\nget back to having fun playing turns into the 20 minute &#39;use the force<br/>\nKragan&#39; blind mans run during night from FP to Lower guk. I get attacked by<br/>\na giant or spectre along the way, I die if I cant hop fast enough.  For fun<br/>\n(Hah) one day, make a human at nightime and try to run from FP to Guk, its<br/>\nrates no where up there with &#39;tanking 4 mobs to save party&#39; or &#39;being able<br/>\nto play that extra 20 mins for the rare to spawn&#39;. Rates right beside &#39;all<br/>\nthe kewl doods messaging me when I am hungover&#39;.<br/>\nBinding is the province of the casters, but being bound anywhere should not<br/>\nbe thier right alone. You know as well as I that at the higher levels, no<br/>\ntank means no party in dungeons. So while I am not playing for that 20 mins,<br/>\nthey are not playing for that 20 mins.<br/>\nI would even support a change in binding so that it can only occur outdoors,<br/>\nand make that stick for everyone. For example, use the same code idea as for<br/>\nSoW. Can&#39;t cast SoW indoors, cant cast bind indoors. Will some people have<br/>\nto adjust? For sure, but it is not as hard a move as it seems. The ones that<br/>\nwill bitch are casters that usually set a bind point to a particular mob so<br/>\nthey can farm it (EE, EXG, Ancient, you get the idea). They arent being<br/>\nforced to make the long runs back, just a zone in to be back. The upside to<br/>\nthis would be more total playtime for everyone. Tanks die, go get them at<br/>\nthe zone entrance, carry on with trying to have fun. And the xp penalty does<br/>\nhurt, and you cant make that up in a real hurry either. Died last night in<br/>\nlord room and lost almost a full bub of final hell (45) xp. Took a good 6<br/>\nhours to regain that.<br/>\nDieing is one thing, but dieing and making the run back can only further<br/>\naggravte one at times. Especially if a caster dies as well, has time to get<br/>\nbody back, remem all spells, and is ready for more play while you are still<br/>\nrunning across first zone.<br/>\nI guess what it all boils down to is this; Only casters get to bind, but<br/>\nallow everyone else to be bound anywhere. As it stands now, if I die twice<br/>\nin an evening and have to make the long run, I no longer feel like playing<br/>\nthe melee class, and switch chars to a caster class where if I die, it takes<br/>\n2 mins to get back to body.<br/>\nJust my two plats<br/>\n<br/>\nKragan<br/>\n45 Warrior<br/>\nMith Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
