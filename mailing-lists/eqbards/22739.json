Players, especially clerics,<br/>\nforce link death/camp out all the time when major raids go bad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 07, 2000 3:39 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Fighting on after linkdeath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds to me like an exploit that I wouldn&#39;t care to discuss. :-P<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:34 PM 12/7/00 -1000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The following happened recently on E&#39;ci.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A group of folks were in the Hole to help someone with their epic quest.<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t know the details of the quest, but you have to talk/give something to<br/>\n&gt;one of the NPCs there.  So a cleric by mistake aggroed the quest NPC.  If<br/>\n&gt;the groups killed the mob, they wouldn&#39;t be able to complete that portion<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the quest.  So no one else attacked the NPC while it was beating up on the<br/>\n&gt;cleric.  Since no one else was on the NPC&#39;s hate list, once the cleric died<br/>\n&gt;the NPC would not be aggro anymore and they could finish the quest.  The<br/>\n&gt;cleric (59th level with an AC over 1100) thought he might have a chance of<br/>\n&gt;surviving if he went LD.  So he turned on autoattack and then typed in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>/quit<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to go LD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now here is where the funny part starts.  The cleric had Complete Heal<br/>\n&gt;loaded in the first spell gem.  Apparently when you go linkdead, the game<br/>\n&gt;automatically switches you over to NPC AI.  If you can cast spells,<br/>\n&gt;apparently the only one the AI will cast is whichever one is loaded in the<br/>\n&gt;first spell gem.  So as everyone else watched the NPC beat on the cleric,<br/>\n&gt;every once in a while (when he wasn&#39;t stunned) the cleric was able to get a<br/>\n&gt;CH spell off.  He was able to cast CH enough that he didn&#39;t die before his<br/>\n&gt;character disappeared from the server.  To say the least he was quite<br/>\n&gt;pleased when he discovered he didn&#39;t die after going LD.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So what I was wondering is could bards use this knowledge to somehow help<br/>\n </span></blockquote>us<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;survive a fight after we go linkdead.  Fear sounds like a good option but<br/>\n&gt;then again it could potentially screw over the rest of the group by causing<br/>\n&gt;a train.  The new Shield of Songs is a possibility as well.  Third option<br/>\n&gt;would be whatever song that you think would best help your party kill the<br/>\n&gt;mob(s) you were attacking before you went LD.  That would be situationally<br/>\n&gt;dependent on where you were fighting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyone got other suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
