What I find hard to believe, perhaps a better term is accept,  is that charisma has no affect on a mob&#39;s chance to resist your song.  Based on what Brad told you, a 20 bard with 85 CHR has the same chance as a 20 bard with 105 CHR to put a 23 level mob to sleep.<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps I made the wrong assumption that high charisma indicated you were better at singing and playing your instrument.  If high charisma&#39;s only reduces your chances of missing a note, I&#39;m beginning to wish I hadn&#39;t put any extra starting points into it.  That&#39;s something I could live with.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  I wonder if it works the same for enchanters, i.e. no change to mob resists but less chance for spell fizzles?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Charisma effect on magic resists<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Now I didn&#39;t say that Charisma had absolutely no effect. One of the main<br/>\n&gt; attributes for a bard is charisma and it is rumored, or solidified by now,<br/>\n&gt; that charisma provides our mana for the Dirge. It is also said to be<br/>\n&gt; important in our chances to successfully sing a song and maybe the duration<br/>\n&gt; of effects. What Brad said was that your charisma does not factor in at all<br/>\n&gt; in the chance that the MOB will resist some or all of the effect. All I know<br/>\n&gt; is that I got a lot more missed notes after donning the ribcage, yet my<br/>\n&gt; bellows were still doing max damage almost all of the time.<br/>\n&gt;         And you are not believing that Brad knows what he is saying or that I<br/>\n&gt; actually talked with him Thursday night? =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Good Journey,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                 Sineras Silverlyre (Cazic-Thule) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
