At first there was some controversy - then we<br/>\nfound he was a someone who was friends with some of the game designers and<br/>\nultimately did get a job working for Verant - I just saw this on EQ Stratics<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Capozzi: A Harley Riding Grunt Who Likes to Read<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Capozzi is a Game Designer on the EverQuest Live team. He, along with<br/>\nseveral others, provides content for the game in the forms of quests, text,<br/>\nhistorical background and much more. As he puts it, &quot;I like depth and story,<br/>\nI feel they are needed to draw you into the game. Give me a rich world to<br/>\nenter, and the tools to let me feel like I&#39;m really there, and I&#39;m a happy<br/>\ngamer. Give me a shallow game, no matter how good the gameplay, and I feel<br/>\nlike I&#39;ve been short-changed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn grew up moving from place to place, largely in the eastern United<br/>\nStates, and spent the thirteen years prior to joining the Verant team in the<br/>\nTampa Bay area of Florida, where he was a small business owner. He put four<br/>\nyears into college (mostly sociology, computer science and literature<br/>\ncourses), and did five years as what he refers to as a &quot;grunt&quot; and then<br/>\n&quot;grunt NCO&quot; in the United States Marine Corps. The latter is what he<br/>\nconsiders his greatest accomplishment - making it through a five-year hitch<br/>\nin the Marine Corps with all his original body parts. The Marines, John<br/>\nsays, were &quot;founded in 1775 in a tavern! The Corps always had its priorities<br/>\nstraight. ;)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven back in school, John was a gamer, starting out with the pen and paper<br/>\nand board games of the time, and moving on to the electronic versions as a<br/>\nnatural progression. He credits himself for having addicted dozens of other<br/>\nhigh school students to these, simply by demonstrating his own skills. Steve<br/>\nJackson&#39;s Pocket Games, he says, got him suspended from school for a week,<br/>\nfor that reason. John claims, &quot;Right away, I knew I wanted to wield that<br/>\nsort of power over my fellow men.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of John&#39;s favorite games over the years have been the Civilization<br/>\ntitles, D&D Gold Box games, System Shock, Thief, Fallout, all the<br/>\nMechwarrior titles, Gemstone, and of course, EverQuest. It&#39;s clear that he<br/>\nprefers games that challenge the mind as well as the hand-eye coordination<br/>\nskills.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn managed to make some time for other hobbies over the years, including<br/>\nworking on and riding vintage Harley Davidson motorcycles, and lots of<br/>\nreading. Some of his favorite authors are Roger Zelazny, William<br/>\nShakespeare, Larry Niven, George R. R. Martin, Jerry Pournelle, Tom Clancy,<br/>\nErnest Hemingway, Robert A. Heinlein, and last but not least, the anonymous<br/>\nauthor of &quot;Lather, rinse, repeat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith such a rich background in literature and concern for detail in games,<br/>\nJohn is making a valuable contribution to the EverQuest Live team!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
