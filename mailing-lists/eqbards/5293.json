No question about it, you will get<br/>\nspoiled.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormal MOB&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nIce Goblin: fighter type, L15-&gt;24, Rawhide, Ringmail<br/>\nIce Goblin Mendicant: Priest type, L16-20<br/>\nIce Goblin Diviner: Wizard type, L16-20<br/>\nIce Goblin Priest: Priest Type, L21-23<br/>\nIce Goblin Evoker, Wizard type, L21-23, cloth load<br/>\nIce Goblin Prelate: Priest type, L24-26, very rare medium Bronze load<br/>\nIce Goblin Wizard: Wizard Type, L24-26<br/>\nIce Goblin Elite: Fighter type, L25-28, common medium bronze load.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard types tend to have higher cash loads. All are capable of carrying<br/>\nWords, Runes, or Grimoire pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nExceptional MOB&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nIce Goblin Archeologist: L21-23 fighter type, abnormally strong for level.<br/>\nLoad: Dented Braass Mask, Archeologist&#39;s Pack<br/>\nIce Goblin Preacher: L23-25 Priest type, abnormally strong healer (60%<br/>\nheals). Load: Runed Circlet, Cold Iron Morningstar, very rare Bronze. Fine<br/>\nSteel Morningstar not uncommon.<br/>\nIce Goblin Alchemist: Level unknown. Load: Mammoth Cloak, Mammoth Leggings<br/>\nIce Goblin Patriarch: L28+, abilities unknown. Load unknown.<br/>\nThe Sage: L28+, abilities unknown. Loaed unknown.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow the place is laid out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is only one path until you reach the flag room. So until you see the<br/>\nflapping flag in a room, you can&#39;t get lost. L15 to 18 PC&#39;s should stick to<br/>\nthe zone edge and lure to there. Root MOB&#39;s, as there is a bug that will<br/>\ncause MOB&#39;s to teleport.<br/>\n<br/>\nL19-21 can fight in the flag room. The spawn is fast here (15 minutes or<br/>\nless), so two groups can simultaneously occupy the room. There is a safe<br/>\nplace off to the right as you enter. This alcove like area does not get<br/>\nspawned on and is out of the MOB&#39;s sight as they get trained through the<br/>\nroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nL20-22 can go to the left side of the room by the cave like exit there and<br/>\nfind the door on the left. This leads to the house. Insode the first door is<br/>\nthe foyer, with two spawn points. There is a closet on either side of the<br/>\nroom. Throught he door straight ahead, there is dead end and a lone spawn on<br/>\nthe left, but the right passage leads to the house. Three spawn points in<br/>\nthe main room here, and typically two casters. This room is a good place to<br/>\nuse as a base camp for hitting the Archeologist, so I&#39;ll go there next.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo through the door in the main room. Here you will find another room, but<br/>\nthis one has a busted wall. This IS an archeologist we are talking about,<br/>\nand he&#39;s been hard at work tracking his way deeper into an ancient Combine<br/>\nEmpire city. Just behind that wall, a goblin spawns, and luring it will draw<br/>\nanother. Now pass through the broken wall into the short tunnel. Here, you<br/>\nwill find a few more goblins, luring the front will bring three. Now that<br/>\nthe tunnel is clear, you will find you way into a large open area. There is<br/>\naplatform in front of you, with three goblins on it. to your left is a<br/>\noverhanging bridge with one goblin on top and two further back underneath.<br/>\nLuring from this room is an art. What you get depends on what you attack.<br/>\nFirst, the Archeologist spawns on top of the snow mound just right of the<br/>\ntombstone on the raised platform. Do not directly attack that spawn. Attack<br/>\nthe spawn to its right. This will bring four: the three from the platform<br/>\nand the one on top of the bridge. So, that&#39;s the Archeologist spawn. Now,<br/>\nfor more fun, if you lure under that bridge on the left next, lure from the<br/>\nright. If you lure the left of that two, you will get jumped by five or six,<br/>\nbut the one on the right is just out of attack range of a number of spawn<br/>\npoints, so you get two, and can grab the rest back there later. Now, right<br/>\nof the platform, there is a passage. There is no spawn behind the door<br/>\nthere, so go ahead and look inside. I won&#39;t wpoil that interesting sight. It<br/>\nmay have a purpose... Anyway, further down that hall are more spawn points<br/>\nworthy of a group of L21-23, so you can push deeper. I don&#39;t know how deep.<br/>\nI though it only went back to two hollowed out caves, but an ally tells me<br/>\nthe passage continues.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, the Preacher. Back to the main room of the house. There you&#39;ll find a<br/>\nhallway. Just run up that hallway, and you&#39;ll find a large room. Two spawns<br/>\non your immediate right as you enter, and three on the dais. This IS the<br/>\npreacher room. Many Casters spawn here, so it can be lethal to break. There<br/>\nare three weak spawns at the far rear behind the dais, but they do not join<br/>\nin when you attack the preacher. Prelates can spawn on the dais, as well as<br/>\nwizards. Priests are frequent spawns especially on the two floor spawns. At<br/>\nthe extreme rear of the room is a door. Behind that door is the Dire Wolf<br/>\nroom, and we don&#39;t exactly know what that leads to or entails. Early<br/>\nexperiences placed a Giant Dire Wolf (L47) down there, and we were not<br/>\ninterested in investigating further.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we were also wanting that Alchemist, right? Okay, back to the Flag room.<br/>\nTake the right exit from the flag room and you&#39;ll fight a few spawns and hit<br/>\na gate. Open the gate like a door and pass by the gate on the left. Do this<br/>\ninvis and /con ALL the spawns in front of you. They range up to at least L25<br/>\nMOB&#39;s. Now, after clearing this out, you&#39;ll see a door and a rock on the<br/>\nleft of the door. Go to the rock and click on it like a door. It will slide<br/>\nopen. The Alchemist spawns behind that rock. Only one other spawns with it.<br/>\nNow, behind the door, there are several groups of spawns, but I have not<br/>\npushed deep into that region, so I can&#39;t say much more about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, back to the gates. Past the second gate (the one to the left as you<br/>\npass the first) is a good room for L24-28. The top level spawn is high blue<br/>\nand even up to yellow. It takes good teamwork to hold this room at L24. At<br/>\nthe bottom of this room, though, is the Patriarch, the Sage, and the Elites.<br/>\nA few will be yellow to L24&#39;s but most red, and the five spawns are close<br/>\ntogether. There is further danger here: behind the door in the bottom of the<br/>\nroom is an Ice Giant Diplomat. Attacking anything close to the door can<br/>\nbring it out and kill everyone in the dungeon. BE CAREFUL. I do not know how<br/>\nto break the bottom spawn yet. An Elite has spawned on one of the higher<br/>\nspawn points, but it was a 1/10 rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s it, that&#39;s everything I know for certain. I can report that the<br/>\nearlier reports of a wandering Giant Dire Wolf is now false: that Dire Wolf<br/>\nwas disabled in June and now seems to no longer wander, and it may not exist<br/>\nat all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you have fun in Permafrost, I know I have. I made L20-24 in that<br/>\ndungeon and I have no indication I won&#39;t get 25-28 there, too. I really<br/>\nwould like to try Unrest, but the exceptional MOB loads in Permafrost are<br/>\nwanted by all in my company. Good luck, and good hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\nArkand Eagleseeker, Spirit Guide to the Haven<br/>\nBarbarian Shaman of the Tribunal, SMotC<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n                     ADDENDUM TO PERMA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following comes to me third or fourth hand. I do NOT know the source.<br/>\nThe info seems correct, but I can not confirm at this time. I wish I could<br/>\ncredit the author, but that info was stripped off long before I saw this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis information pertains to what I called the Patriarch room. This is<br/>\nactually the Throne room as you&#39;ll see by the alternate spawns. When I<br/>\nvisited, I only saw the Patriarch, 3 Elite Goblin Guards, and &quot;the  Goblin<br/>\nSage.&quot; We were not of a level to attack even that, the weakest of the spawns<br/>\nthere. I had a ranger on tracking, and he did not report the Ice Goblin<br/>\nHonor Guard.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSymbol of Loyalty to Vox is common drop for King Thex`Ka IV in permafrost<br/>\n(the ice goblin king). He is a fairly rare spawn, and symbol is a very high<br/>\ndemand item because everyone can wear it, including monks and mages. To kill<br/>\nhim, you need a good level 30-35 group, because the spawn points are<br/>\n(common/rare spawn): <br/>\n1) Elite Goblin Guard/Elite Honor Guard <br/>\n2) Goblin Patriarch/High Priest Zaharn <br/>\n3) Goblin Sage/none <br/>\n4) Elite Goblin Guard/Elite Honor Guard <br/>\n5) Elite Goblin Guard/King Thex`Ka IV <br/>\n<br/>\nElite goblin guards are normal mid-high twenties warrior mobs, drop medium<br/>\nbronze plate and fine steel weapons, elite honor guards are about level 30<br/>\nand drop silvery axes (both 1H and 2H, 2H is rare drop), warriors as well,<br/>\nthe sage is NASTY, he just LOVES to rain fire and ice on groups, he can<br/>\nsingle-handedly take out an unprepared group when backed up by<br/>\npatriarch/zaharn who are level 30 or so clerics - with LOTS of mana.<br/>\nPatriarch drops frost goblin totem (for crafted boots), High Priest Zaharn<br/>\ndrops Zaharn&#39;s Coronet (AC5 +3 STR +25 mana, priests only, no ogres or<br/>\ntrolls), sage drops nothing. King Thex`Ka IV spawns on the point closest to<br/>\nthe big double door, level 30 meleer, quite mean, although not nearly as bad<br/>\nas the spellcasters (he did almost kill our level 29 wiz when he overburned<br/>\nthough). common drop on him is symbol of loyalty to vox, rare is white wolf<br/>\nhide cloak (AC7 +3 STR +3 DEX... goodbye lizardscale). I personally wear<br/>\nrubicite bracer because it goes well with other armor I have (especially<br/>\nwhen in DE mode), bracer of erollisi on the other wrist. To find the room<br/>\nwith those goblins, enter permafrost, follow passage to flag room, follow<br/>\nright wall in flag room to the big iron fence type gate, go through it to<br/>\nsee a small iron fence type door. Past that door is a big room, mostly<br/>\nconsisting of ledge and area under it where the juicy goblins spawns. Oh,<br/>\nthere is an ice giant diplomat past big double doors in back of the room,<br/>\nkilling him triggers spawn of goblin that has a chance of being the goblin<br/>\nchampion that drops crystalline blade (11/38 1HS... primary only, lore). The<br/>\ndiplomat is level 35 wizard, not very tough, drops throwing boulders. Do<br/>\nNOT, repeat, do NOT go past the doors, there are VERY aggressive ice giants<br/>\npast the diplomat, never seen a mob with aggression radius so wide, whenever<br/>\nyou turn around the corner, a pair of ice giants charges, one level 33, the<br/>\nother level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA look at lower guk!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis starts in the Dead side of the Lower Guk at the Tower Entrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your left you&#39;ll see 3 tal wizards, the one in the middle will<br/>\noccasionally spawn as &quot;a ghoul ritualist&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy drops a Black Embroidered Cape (worn on shoulders), 4 ac, plus 15<br/>\nmana, plus 20 hp, and black embroidered sleeves as the rare drop, which have<br/>\nthe same stats.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGo into the tower, pass the first ladder and make a left, you&#39;ll see another<br/>\nladder there, in a room with three froggies.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo named frogs spawn in there:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ghoul Assasin, common drop Guise of the Deceiver, 4 ac, plus 13<br/>\ncharisma, plus 7 magic resist mask which has Illusion: Dark Elf.  Only bards<br/>\nand rogues can wear the mask but anyone can use the effect from your<br/>\ninventory.  His rare drop is a Serrated Bone Dirk, 8 damage, 26 delay<br/>\npiercing weapon which procs encompassing darkness, rogue only.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ghoul Supplier, common drop is a Light Burlap Sack, an 8 item holding<br/>\nbackpack which reduces weight by 70%, and his rare drop is one sweet as hell<br/>\nbelt, the Thick Banded Belt.  8 ac, plus 15 str, weight 0.5, ALL/ALL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWalk down the stairs to the right of the ladder, clear the frogs, and you&#39;ll<br/>\ncome to a room with 5 frogs in it.  In one of these spots spawns a Ghoul<br/>\nSavant.  He drops the black enameled mace as the common drop, 8 damage 28<br/>\ndelay mace, and black enameled chestplate as his rare drop, an AC25 black<br/>\nplate chest, good stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo down the stairs, you get to the third floor.  Head straight right and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll enter a room with 4 jail cells and a platform in the middle.  On top<br/>\nof the platform spawns the Ghoul Executioner, his booby drop is an<br/>\nexecutioners hood, 5 ac, plus 4 str plus 9 dex leather hat, very nice for<br/>\nrogue.  His rare drop is of course, the executioners axe, 25 damage, 50<br/>\ndelay, effect: Haste, warrior only 2h slashing weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso to the right of the staircase you&#39;ll find a room with a book case in<br/>\nit.  In there spawn the Ghoul Sage and Ghoul Scribe.  The sage drops a belt,<br/>\nforget the name right now, that has 2 ac, plus 4 int, plus 8hp, and a rare<br/>\ndrop hat (forget the name), that gives 4 wis, 9 int.  The scribe&#39;s common<br/>\ndrop is a Parchment of Flayed Skin, most likely some quest item, and I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what his rare drop is. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo the left of the stairs you&#39;ll find a room with 3 frogs and a bed in it,<br/>\nin there spawns the Ghoul Cavalier. His common drop are adamantite epolets,<br/>\n9 ac plus 7 wis plate based shoulders, and his rare drop is the Dark Reaver,<br/>\na 20 damage 42 delay SK only slashing weapon, which procs steal strength.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso to the left of the staircase you&#39;ll find another room with 3 frogs that<br/>\nleads to the lobby, which you can also get to by dropping off the bridge<br/>\nwhere the 3 tals are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the lobby, follow the path the hall and you&#39;ll get to a jail room with<br/>\n4 cages, and 3 halls.  If you go straight, you&#39;ll have to clear out about 10<br/>\nfrogs ranging from wans to dars and their mage equivalents. Very tough<br/>\nfrogs. If you&#39;re good you can do these in pulls of 2.  Keep heading in and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll get to a long room with a trap in the center.  Avoid the trap.  If<br/>\nyou do fall in, it just drops you down a bit, you can make your way back up<br/>\nthe ladder NP.  On either side of the trap there is a room.  The left room<br/>\nhas a pillar of water in it, swim up that and you&#39;ll find the Reanimated<br/>\nHand, with 1 dar guard.  The common drop off the hand are serpentine<br/>\nbracers, 1 ac, plus 3 dex, plus 9 agi, plate looking, awesome bracers.  The<br/>\nrare drop sucks, adamantite band, plus 75hp, minus 10 magic resist.    The<br/>\nright room will lead to a ladder, not sure whats down there, and will loop<br/>\nback around into a little bedroom where the Ghoul Arch Magi spawns. His<br/>\ncommon drop are silver silk leggings, not sure on exact stats, but they have<br/>\n4 ac and I believe some plus int.  His rare drop is either a Robe of the<br/>\nArchmage or a Shiny Metallic Robe, don&#39;t have stats as I haven&#39;t seen this<br/>\nitem myself, apparently it&#39;s great though.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep heading straight, you&#39;ll run into maybe 10 more frogs, and you&#39;ll get<br/>\nto the Ghoul Lord.  Don&#39;t even attempt this without a full group of level<br/>\n45+, or 2 full groups of levels 40+, this bugger is NASTY.  Doubles for 125,<br/>\nHarm Touches for close to 500, and has over 8000 hitpoints.  He also has 2<br/>\nguards in his room, either dar knights, bok knights (level 43 to 46) or jin<br/>\nwizards (43 to 46).  Fighting all 3 of these combined is basically suicide<br/>\nunless you have a killer high group, so you&#39;ll need to pull 1 of these solo.<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to get into the intricasies of Aggro Radius pulling, but if<br/>\nyou have a skilled puller he should be able to figure it out.  The ghoul<br/>\nlord&#39;s common drop is a skull shaped barbute, a 13 ac, plus 35 hp, plus 10<br/>\nmagic resist plate helm, and his rare drop is the Shortsword of the Ykesha,<br/>\n8 damage, 24 delay 1h slasher which procs ykesha, a 70 damage DD spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take the left path of the prison type room you get to some froglok<br/>\nslave camp, and if you take the right path you get to a serious maze like<br/>\narea with 40+ frogs crawling all over the place.  This way leads to the<br/>\nGhoul Sentinel (drops brigandine tunic) and the Frenzied Ghoul, which drops<br/>\nthe flowing black silk sash.  From what I&#39;ve gathered this path is harder<br/>\nthan the path to the ghoul lord, so you don&#39;t have a prayer unless you&#39;re<br/>\nwith at least one full group of 45+.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
