I don&#39;t want a binding song, I don&#39;t<br/>\n  want an invis to undead song either, that wastes our slots<br/>\n  for things that really aren&#39;t a problem.  Everyone needs to<br/>\n  think about what would make you a better choice in a group<br/>\n  or a song you wish you had for multiple occasions.  Something<br/>\n  useful, and maybe realistic, but be creative.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Solon&#39;s Song of Silence<br/>\n  -----------------------<br/>\n  Level:    39th<br/>\n  Target:   Point Blank AE<br/>\n  Skill:    Wind<br/>\n  Save:     Vs.

I mean some really<br/>\n  powerful songs.  I look at enchanter who can charm L50<br/>\n  mobs on the planes and I&#39;m like wow, or warriors who hit<br/>\n  for 100+ dmg consistantly - and I&#39;m like wow - what do<br/>\n  I do?  Nothing someone else can&#39;t do better.  Screw that.<br/>\n  We need some unique, and very powerful party songs.  <br/>\n  Our songs should be better than any buff or an shaman/<br/>\n  enchanter ability since our song is limited to such a<br/>\n  low duration.  +66 STR from a L50 shaman lasts over an<br/>\n  hour, but my STR buff lasts 6 seconds, it should be worth<br/>\n  it to have a bard in the party.  Right now, it&#39;s just<br/>\n  kinda neat.  We need to do most things better when it <br/>\n  comes to the Party.  I don&#39;t want to melee, I don&#39;t care<br/>\n  about unique weapons.  If you want 987654321 STR and want<br/>\n  a 100/10 sword then you shoulda been a warrior.  I want to<br/>\n  stand in my group and use my instrument to play one or two<br/>\n  songs that are absolutely /outstanding/ and /unbeatable/.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I mean +50 AC, +75 STR.  I mean absorb melee dmg up to 200<br/>\n  HP per round.  Have you all seen those things that hit for<br/>\n  750?  I want an anti-DT song.  How about a +HP song?  Like<br/>\n  +500 HP as long as I&#39;m singing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Too powerful?  Go to the Plane of Sky, where one mob can<br/>\n  kill you before you get to turn around.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Too powerful?  I&#39;ll be able to crush those green mobs that constantly<br/>\n  annoy the sh*t out of me.  So what?  I gain nothing from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Everyone here is thinking about what&#39;s the norm in the current<br/>\n  game.  Max hit on non-plane Norrath is like 400 dmg per strike,<br/>\n  and that&#39;s rare.  Max hit on planar realms is in the thousands.<br/>\n  Kunark gonna be a bunch of L40 mobs?  Hell no.  Everything is <br/>\n  gonna have DT, and melee in the 500-1000s... I have no doubt about<br/>\n  it.  I was right about the L60, and about the spells per level,<br/>\n  so my track record here is pretty good =)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
