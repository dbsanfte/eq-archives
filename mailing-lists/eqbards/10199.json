I must say I am<br/>\npleased to finally see a great source of information about bard songs,<br/>\nespecially one that is continuously updated and revised.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I was REALLY hoping to find in the song analysis database<br/>\nwas more information about the actual damage statistics caused by DoT<br/>\nsongs such as CoD and DDD with instruments and without.  Considering I<br/>\nrarely use weapons any more except in certain circumstances, knowing the<br/>\ndamage that I am doing with these songs would help me better evaluate<br/>\nwhich is better to use in a given situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that you can get a friend to duel you and do the tests on them but<br/>\nit would help to know the damage formula, especially when the damage<br/>\nincreases with levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really surprised the damage statistics have been so hard to find<br/>\nconsidering that when it comes to weapons and spells, the amount of damage<br/>\nthey each can do in a set time is how everyone compares them.  (Throw in<br/>\nmana used versus damage caused for spells of course)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has more information on this I would greatly appreciate it if<br/>\nyou could post it or point me to a URL containing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabryel<br/>\nBard, Level 27<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
