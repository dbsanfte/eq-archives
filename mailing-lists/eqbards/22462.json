They are truely good advice.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnfortunately, this camp is proceeding like a bad Plane raid. My paint had<br/>\nreally bad AC apparently (3 gallons for one small bedroom!), so it was not<br/>\ncompleted before the whole zone got trained on us (3 guys and a very large<br/>\nmoving truck). We managed to trap a good bit of the train in the Basement<br/>\nand Garage, but they will have to be cleared at some point too. I did learn<br/>\nnot to have a druid or a mage, even a tall one, help you paint. They got<br/>\npaint all over my ceilings! My cleric was invaluable in hanging the<br/>\ncurtains/blinds though, he had all the reagents and did a wonderful job. I<br/>\nstill need to use Binding on some of the curtains (too long). The monk has<br/>\nbeen great as well, splitting up the box spawn enough to get the small, more<br/>\ndelicate spawns pulled before the repop. As usual, I&#39;m in charge of what<br/>\ngoes where as everyone knows bards are the ones to talk to about fashion and<br/>\norganization. As a result, I can barely start on one box before the group<br/>\nmembers present start yelling for help in another part of the zone. The<br/>\ncleric has Root, he just can&#39;t seem to decide where to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur biggest problems are the spawns with the really good loot just haven&#39;t<br/>\npop&#39;ed: the New Mattress, the Undented New Range, and the Backordered New<br/>\nFurniture. Apparently, they are rare. Some of the box spawns can&#39;t be<br/>\ncleared til these big guys finally pop! Hymn is becoming invaluable, as<br/>\nsleeping on the floor is really hard on the hit points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleric is working hard now on getting us back online at home; maybe we<br/>\nwill get to play again in another week!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
