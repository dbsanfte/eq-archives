But hey..  I&#39;ve got a guy in my guild that play three<br/>\ncharacters simultaneously and two or three others people that play two<br/>\nsimultaneously.  That takes multiple accounts and multiple computers.  When<br/>\na guild officer creates a mule, it&#39;s handy that it&#39;s not on the same account<br/>\nso that he can trade items with himself.  Two computers and DSL will work<br/>\njust fine for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the next time your significant other is giving you grief about EQ, tell<br/>\nthem it *could* be worse.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n[47 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Brangwen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brangwen@...\">brangwen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Druzzil Ro Migration Update<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jasonf@...\">jasonf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see.  In fact a couple of guild officer&#39;s mule characters were<br/>\n&gt; left behind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with loads of runes, pages, gate potions, dragon loot, fbss&#39;s, ykeshas,<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that he had stored..  yech.  So I&#39;ve got to say this wasn&#39;t for the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thought that they were moving all the players chars?? or was this a<br/>\n&gt; separate account???
