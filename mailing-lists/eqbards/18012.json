Turns out<br/>\nhe was the leader of the Raider group...perfect. Well the second heads up<br/>\nwas that he was using a PGT and barbed whip at 30, but hey, sometimes people<br/>\njust like a certain combo. It was when he said &quot;I will sing Hymn and Jig&quot; I<br/>\nthought &quot;uh oh.&quot; But I really wanted a group...I died shortly thereafter,<br/>\nhowever the rest of the evening went smoothly. BTW, his name makes it on the<br/>\nsilly name list but I think I better not mention it :o)<br/>\nAnyway, Highpass strikes me as clockwork exp, spawn is 14 minutes (from<br/>\nfirst gobby to first gobby, 3 total) and when you get a group that can<br/>\nhandle it you just kill/wait/kill/wait. I suppost that is what it is like in<br/>\ncampsites all over Norrath, I have just never played the game that way, I<br/>\nthink I can stand it for a few nights though, then I will have to go find<br/>\nsomething dangerous again...(my guild calls me DangerBard or<br/>\nDangerEnchanter, depending on who I am playing, I just like hunting<br/>\nsomeplace I am KOS or that has some other challenge than waiting between<br/>\nspawns).<br/>\nSo, that is the Highpass report for today. We shall see what tomorrow<br/>\nbrings.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, 27, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
