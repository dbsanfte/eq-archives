In fact, I borrow a better computer when doing<br/>\ndragon/plane raids because turning off all chats, effects, names,<br/>\n*everything* I still crash.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can twist three songs on either continent, but it requires a good bit<br/>\nmore attention on kunark, which is my new home (can we say carpal<br/>\ntunnel?).  I really do seem to be at a disadvantage for my<br/>\nbehind-the-times system, often.  Nothing like having processor overload<br/>\nkill you when you *were* half a zone ahead with selos on. :)  I also have<br/>\na hard time charming, as the timing is skewed by how sluggish my machine<br/>\nis at that moment (hence my current hatred of charming).  Forget trying<br/>\nto type an important message to a groupmate in Karnor&#39;s--by the time I<br/>\nhave the words &quot;snare it&quot; out, I have missed out on 2-3 songs, since the<br/>\ntiming has to be so close down there.  ::sighs:: I *swear* I will upgrade<br/>\nsomeday.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, though, anyone have any suggestions to ease the stress<br/>\non my system that I may not have thought of (besides leaving kunark ;P)?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\nGuildmistress, Hearts of Valor<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heartsofvalor.com\">http://www.heartsofvalor.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVisit Swiftarrow&#39;s Song at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freespeech.org/karisma\">http://www.freespeech.org/karisma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
