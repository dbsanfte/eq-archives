I had a charisma of 118 and bought it from<br/>\n&gt; Kelethin, my home city, I got it for about 757pp.  My<br/>\n&gt; ranger friend checked what his price would be just to<br/>\n&gt; see, and it was over 900 for him.  Also I noticed that<br/>\n&gt; it isn&#39;t size specific.  No medium or large to it.<br/>\n&gt; Pretty cool, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure you won&#39;t be too happy about this when you look more closely<br/>\nat it... Kelethin sells MEDIUM plate (and chain and leather and banded<br/>\nmolds) for some reason.  Wood elves can wear medium, but they SHOULD wear<br/>\nsmall.  For small plate, you have to buy in Rivervale or Kaladim or Akanon.<br/>\nIf you check the races that can wear the plate, I think you&#39;ll find it&#39;s the<br/>\nmedium races.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless there has been a wonderful change lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
