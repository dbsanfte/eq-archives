Bard and enchanters<br/>\ngo together like peas and carrots.  The only other class as beneficial to a<br/>\nbard&#39;s continued health is a cleric.  But with a good enchanter, the less<br/>\nyou need a good cleric around (still nice to have though). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find is that with a good enchanter in the party, I get to use songs<br/>\nthat I normally don&#39;t get to play with that much because I had to worry<br/>\nabout crowd control.

I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, and thought I&#39;d post on a<br/>\n&gt; subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the incompatability of enchanters<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game that work together as<br/>\n&gt; poorly as these two?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
