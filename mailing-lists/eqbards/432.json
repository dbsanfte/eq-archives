I started a character and put 20 points into<br/>\ndex and 5 points into strength.  By level 8 I was sick of having to go back<br/>\nand sell so often so I started over and put all my points into strength.  At<br/>\nfirst I wasn&#39;t sure it was a good idea because I seemed to be missing a lot<br/>\nof notes but now at level 12 I rarely ever miss a note.  I think putting it<br/>\nall into strength is the way to go.  Having a 100 strength comes in handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nArden<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
