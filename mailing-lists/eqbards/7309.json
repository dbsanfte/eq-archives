Or so it seems.<br/>\nEvery time I get rooted I think...  well my lucks run out this time... and I<br/>\nplay Selos, and am free...*shrug*  But I reached a point where coinsidence<br/>\ndid not make sense.  When Im confused on something, I post.  Tonight, I will<br/>\ntry my darndest to get rooted.  perhaps I can find a friend to accompany me<br/>\nto the Arena to test.

No song text (&quot;your feet fail to move faster!&quot;), no song sprites, <br/>\nno effect whatsoever.  No matter the status of my Selo&#39;s at the time the <br/>\nroot was applied, I was rooted and could not use Selo&#39;s to break it.  This <br/>\nheld true for green ghouls as well as blue and white.  In fact it was <br/>\nidentical to what happened if I had SoW cast on me... well, with SoW I could<br/>\n<br/>\nstill move a little bit, but at a horribly slow crawl... how they live with <br/>\nthat I will never understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night in Unrest I ran into some trouble, and was once again unable to <br/>\nbreak roots using Selo&#39;s... I was in a full group with 2 clerics and in the <br/>\nfirst two fights received not ONE heal while the damn monsters made bard <br/>\npuree - I actually died within one minute of arrival in Unrest and again <br/>\nwithin one minute of retrieving my corpse, then one more time at the end of <br/>\nthe evening (in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron), a new record for my worst experience in <br/>\nEQ.  Grrrrr... Anyways, twice I was rooted and unable to break it.  Root is <br/>\na bit tricky to test as it is highly variable: sometimes it fails quickly, <br/>\nsometimes it holds for the rest of your life. = )<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying Devil&#39;s Advocate, my PL was horrid, and my screen was full of spells<br/>\n<br/>\ngoing off (smite smite smite HEAL PLEASE smite smite HEAL PLEASE smite HELP!<br/>\n<br/>\nsmite LOADING PLEASE WAIT), so this may not be a valid test.  If anyone can <br/>\nconfirm through repeated testing (please observe that a single anecdotal <br/>\nexample of how you played Selo&#39;s and the root went away is not a valid <br/>\nsample) that Selo&#39;s does now break root again, please let us all know.  <br/>\nOtherwise I think we can safely assume that this is either 1) a bug which <br/>\nVerant will fix &quot;someday&quot; (i.e. they want Selo&#39;s to break root, but it <br/>\nclearly is not a priority for their programmers), or 2) the way they always <br/>\nintended it to be (i.e. Selo&#39;s breaking root was a bug which has been <br/>\nfixed).  Since Verant doesn&#39;t talk to us peons, as always we must rely on <br/>\neach other to find out how our (or IF) our songs work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which, is there any word on Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody?  Does<br/>\n<br/>\nit do anything?  If so, what?  I&#39;d like to hear that someone has tested it <br/>\nrecently (since the most recent patch is always preferable) and can confirm <br/>\nor deny the rumors floating around.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay your feet ever be fleet,<br/>\nAnd your voices ever be sweet<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
