I still think that the 24 song for the most part is now useless.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1)  OK long range ultravision is nice but at 24th level and beyond how many<br/>\nplayers with normal vision need it?  By then they have long had an alternate<br/>\nlight source (i.e. Lightstone) that they can use.  Granted it might help<br/>\nwhile the party is running across a zone but since most playtime is spent<br/>\ncamping group members are generally close to one another and therefore don&#39;t<br/>\nrequire long range vision.  Human bards are probably the only race that<br/>\nmight need that song but how many human bards are even out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Grouping with pet classes.  You have to consider the times when see<br/>\ninvisibility is used in a dungeon.  Most of the time its used in conjunction<br/>\nwith invis to get from the zone to wherever you want to camp (and vice<br/>\nversa) and bypass all the mobs along the way.  If you need to invis to get<br/>\nthere, then pet classes shouldn&#39;t summon their pet until they get to where<br/>\nthey are camping. Bottom line is that for the most part invis and see invis<br/>\nare used in conjuction with one another and therefore the pet is gonna die<br/>\nanyway.  Only situations where I can see using see invis without invis is if<br/>\nyou know a mob buffs himself with invis or if you think another group is<br/>\ninvis and might KS from you.  If thats the case just have one of the casters<br/>\ncast the see invis and free up one of your song slots.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line is that Clouding now performs the same primary function as the<br/>\nlevel 24 song so IMO it would be nice if they gave us a new 24 song that we<br/>\ncould actually use on a regular occasion. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; That song grants Ultravision + see invis (L24), and still has value.<br/>\n&gt; What if you are in a group with a shaman, necromancer, or mage but want<br/>\n&gt; to sing party see invis? Are you going to kill their pets with your<br/>\n&gt; invis song to do it? You get the picture. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They did a nice job of giving our invis song a huge bonus which was<br/>\n&gt; sorely needed, let&#39;s not complain about the fact that we now have 2<br/>\n&gt; songs that grant us this highly desirable (in my opinion) ability.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
