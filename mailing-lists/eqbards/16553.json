The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-38929997\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; So you&#39;re basically having the bard waste an extra song slot<br/>\n&gt; (still need Chain in case something goes wrong with snare)<br/>\n&gt; because the ranger/druid is too lazy to wait for you to give<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;Chain off&quot; message?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 100% deferral to snare is not the optimal solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, in your fantastic analysis of my song line up, I suppose that is<br/>\nexactly what I am doing, wasting a spot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But don&#39;t you see, that very same argument works against snare<br/>\n&gt; just as well as chain.  If all it takes to deal with a runner<br/>\n&gt; is a nuke and a DoT, then it doesn&#39;t matter if you overwrite<br/>\n&gt; snare with chain.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are out of context here.  The nuke-DOT comment has nothing to do with<br/>\nthe snare/chain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the one hand, you claim you almost never use chain,<br/>\n&gt; deferring to druid/ranger snarers and shaman/enchanter speed<br/>\n&gt; debuffers.  On the other hand, you speak as if with expertise<br/>\n&gt; about how reliable chain is against high level mobs.  Do you<br/>\n&gt; see the credibility problem here?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Credibility MY ASS!  You really think I always have a druid or ranger in the<br/>\nparty?  I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been relegated to the role of<br/>\nstopping runners.  The only person who has any credibility in this<br/>\ndiscussion is the one who has had to use chains as the parties ONLY means of<br/>\nstopping runners AND has seen the other side with a druid or ranger doing<br/>\ntheir job.  If there is a credibility question perhaps it is you since you<br/>\nalways party with a druid... Try without one sometime.  It gives you a whole<br/>\nnew perspective on chains.  Sorry, I take huge offense when someone<br/>\nquestions my credibility.   Are you trying to say that I make this stuff up?<br/>\nHmmm, perhaps because I&#39;m 5 levels lower then you are I&#39;m just stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I&#39;ve had it wear off immediately from a L2 beetle.  It<br/>\n&gt; happens from time to time.  95% of the time in my experience,<br/>\n&gt; it works fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to see a log analysis here.  In my experience its more liek 40% to<br/>\n50%...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Try the live side.  Most people avoid the maze and noble/king<br/>\n&gt; area for some reason (probably so set into the camp mentality<br/>\n&gt; that having to run around confusing corridors is terrifying<br/>\n&gt; for them).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Live side on Prexus is just as camped as the dead side...  Got about as much<br/>\nchance getting to see the evil eye or crusader as you do getting in a lord<br/>\ngroup.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
