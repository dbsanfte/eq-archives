They have so few<br/>\noptions, that there are only a narrow range of situations<br/>\nwhere they can really do well.  Bards and enchanters OTOH are<br/>\nso flexible they can (given enough intelligence) usually turn<br/>\nany situation into their favor.  It boils down to what you<br/>\nmean by &quot;difficult.&quot;  Do you enjoy solving problems with just<br/>\na few tools, or do you enjoy having a wide assortment of weak<br/>\ntools and puzzling over which will work best to solve the<br/>\nproblem at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, one could argue that not-so-intelligent players<br/>\nwould prefer the few-tools approach since it involves fewer<br/>\npermutations per situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
