I didn&#39;t see finding mobs as a big problem with<br/>\nKithicor.  I&#39;m usually able to keep a steady stream of mobs<br/>\nfor my groups to fight.  Just run out to fetch a new one<br/>\nbefore the one you&#39;re fighting is dead.  When it becomes day,<br/>\nlet the paladins find undead using their sense undead spell -<br/>\nit points them at the nearest undead (which doesn&#39;t work when<br/>\na necro or SK pet is nearby).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem keeping up your mobs/hour ratio in Kithicor is<br/>\nthat the mobs are just way too tough for their level.  The<br/>\nharm touches insure you&#39;re going to have at least a minute or<br/>\ntwo of downtime after the fight.  Most of the mobs are casters<br/>\non top of that, and all can debuff or disease you, thus<br/>\nrequiring even more downtime.  If a party member gets feared,<br/>\nhalf the time he&#39;s gonna die.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is that it&#39;s an outdoor zone.  There are no<br/>\nstructured halls for people to find shelter in, so everyone<br/>\npulls to the zones.  One group screws up, and everyone on that<br/>\nside has to get out.  The undead are not very particular about<br/>\nwho they attack either, so pulling is a problem, as is having<br/>\nother people&#39;s pulls jumping on you in a tough fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
