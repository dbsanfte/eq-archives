Then, last night in Unrest, we had a particularly<br/>\ntough combat with a Skeletal Monk, and the Necro in our party hit it with a<br/>\nDoT - darned if the blasted corpse didn&#39;t vanish!  And it was my loot, too<br/>\n:(  Things went downhill from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - um - the Bard-related point here is that, apparently, DDD *is*<br/>\ntreated as a DoT, so I imagine Chords are, too, thus Bards may in fact be<br/>\naffected by the Kiting changes.  Hrmph - good thing we&#39;re so awesome at<br/>\neverything else ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
