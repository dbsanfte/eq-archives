How do they steal a player?  DO they<br/>\nsneak into your guildhall in the middle of night, creep into DuckFoo&#39;s<br/>\nroom, hold a nocked Ashenwood bow to his head and tell him to leave?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey convince DuckFoo that joing their guild is better for him than<br/>\nstaying in his old guild.  DuckFoo then decides that the gains for<br/>\njoining the new guild outweight the loyalty he holds to old guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nWheres the problem here?<br/>\n<br/>\nIts with DuckFoo or with his old guild.  Either DuckFoo is leaving<br/>\nbehind good friends, and trustworthy companions for the allure of more<br/>\npower.  Or, his old guild was not providing him with what he wanted from<br/>\na guild.  In the first case I say &quot;Shame on DuckFoo, and you deserve<br/>\nwhatever happens to you.&quot;  In the second, I&#39;d say its a good thing<br/>\nDuckFoo left and everyone is probably better off.  I don&#39;t see where the<br/>\nnew guild has done anything wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you aren&#39;t getting from a guild what you want, then you should<br/>\nleave.  All the better if its to a guild which will give you what you<br/>\nwant/need.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I want to be in a guild with people I like and I&#39;m friends<br/>\nwith.  Hopefully also with a decent amount of people my level, so I can<br/>\nmore esaily find groups.  Other people may want other things.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
