I took his suggestion and spent the night fighting a<br/>\nconstant stream of beatable blues, it was wonderful. The money is not great,<br/>\nbut due to the constant blue spawn exp is really really good. More<br/>\nimportantly (for me) you are not fighting the same mob over and over:<br/>\nHarpies, clockworks, lesser drakes, Mino Slavers, Lords and Heros...*laughs*<br/>\nyeah, I saw the Lord just as he spawned in the cave, that didn&#39;t last long<br/>\n:o) The Hero spawned right afterward: *poof* gone. I avoided the elementals,<br/>\ntoo many hitpoints for the trouble. I AM going to Unrest, but not till this<br/>\nbanquet is over :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nTsengu, Nameless<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
