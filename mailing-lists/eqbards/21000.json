I <br/>\nhonestly think that, when we talk about Chains, he thinks we&#39;re talking about the <br/>\nearly-break modification they made, and when we&#39;re talking about Lullaby, we&#39;re <br/>\ncomplaining about there being a secondary resist, period, or perhaps that we&#39;re <br/>\nstill complaining about the lack of a secondary resist message.  If he <br/>\noff-handedly assumes that this is the case each time he sees a new thread, and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t bother to read the thread, then we&#39;ll NEVER get him to get a clue.
