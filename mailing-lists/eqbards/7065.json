I actually<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have any trouble getting into the city because I<br/>\nentered the cave from the top.  Just inside the city didn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to be a problem.  I zoned back out, and was immediately<br/>\njumped by two red guards.  Mind you, I had Accelerando with a<br/>\ndrum running just before I zoned, and I restarted it<br/>\nimmediately upon exiting.  Being server AI-driven, they were<br/>\neasily able to keep up with me and whack me from behind while<br/>\nI navigated the twists and turns that are at every zone point.<br/>\nWhen I finally got out of the cave, a third guard jumped into<br/>\nthe fray.  I managed to get away from them and zone into EC<br/>\nwith two bubbles of life.  This was with my drum and all my<br/>\nbanded armor.  Without my equipment I most likely would&#39;ve<br/>\ndied.<br/>\n<br/>\nA monk on the eq_monk list used to be a big advocate of what<br/>\nyou suggest - binding in Grobb (or whatever the troll city is)<br/>\nfor fighting in Guk and Innotule.  He&#39;d use sneak (it works<br/>\nbetter for monks) to get past the guards outside the zone.<br/>\nThen one day, Verant caught on that this was going on, and<br/>\nadded a wandering guard just inside the zone.  He lost almost<br/>\na full level from being killed over and over just as he<br/>\nrespawned, until he finally managed to zone out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the strategies you suggest are viable at low levels<br/>\nbecause you just don&#39;t have enough hit points to take the hits<br/>\nfrom the guards should they attack you.  At high levels it&#39;s a<br/>\nmoot point because a cleric can revive/resurrect you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you die you typically lose about an hour&#39;s worth of<br/>\nexperience.  Running the extra 4 zones takes about 10 minutes<br/>\nfor a bard (I&#39;ve timed it - with Accelerando and a drum, most<br/>\nzones take from just under a minute to about two minutes to<br/>\ncross in your mid 20s, W and S Karana and the ramp to Highpass<br/>\nin EK being the exceptions).  That means even if you&#39;re<br/>\nre-killed only 1 time in 5 doing the bind-in-an-evil-city<br/>\ntrick, you&#39;re worse off than if you&#39;d bound in a safe city and<br/>\nmade the full run every time.  The numbers are different for<br/>\nall the other non-binding classes since they can&#39;t run as<br/>\nfast, but that also means they&#39;re at more risk of re-death<br/>\nsince they can&#39;t outrun the guards.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really wouldn&#39;t recommend you do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
