The songs<br/>\n  grant infra (Warmth) and ultra (Cooling) visions, and<br/>\n  also increase the appropriate resistances.  By shielding<br/>\n  your group from multiple monsters, you can inflict huge<br/>\n  dmg while killing them one at a time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Soloing with it is tough because you probably want to<br/>\n  concentrate on speeding yourself up, while slowing down<br/>\n  the enemy.  Twisting it in (if possible) might help I<br/>\n  would imagine.  It would be particularly effective against<br/>\n  npcs that hit very fast.  Any creatures wielding daggers<br/>\n  or rapiers would essentially kill themselves on your dmg<br/>\n  shield along with you whacking them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  However, toe to toe, one on one, I would recommend at <br/>\n  level 25, warsong + anthem + chains.  This would increase<br/>\n  your attack and decrease the enemies attack.  Again, this<br/>\n  is toe to toe, and I imagine since you are curious about <br/>\n  damage shields that you would be in melee range.  Otherwise,<br/>\n  you could creatively kite an npc with selos+bellow or chains+<br/>\n  bellow.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I found it extremely difficult to solo monsters at L25, and<br/>\n  get decent exp from things.  Around this level I hit highkeep<br/>\n  and powerlevel&#39;d off of pickclaws.  Extremely good exp even<br/>\n  in full groups with people 5 levels over you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just my opinion, for you sensitive bards on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
