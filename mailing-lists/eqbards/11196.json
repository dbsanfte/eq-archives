We fought our way to the doorway of the room then healed and<br/>\nmedded up.  Our ranger peeked inside the room to see how many spawns were up<br/>\n(a group had been there earlier) and saw that the room was full.  What<br/>\nhappened next was something very rare in groups, we set up a gameplan.<br/>\n    Everyone (that didn;t have one set already) mapped out an /assist hotkey<br/>\nfor our puller and we discussed who would cast what and when they would cast<br/>\nit.  Since the major worry was that the whole room would rush us and folks<br/>\nwould get the stuffing beat out of them by multiple MOBs before one could be<br/>\nkilled, I told them about Lullaby.  With that info, (and when we were<br/>\nhealed, buffed, and medded) our puller targetted the most dangerous MOB and<br/>\nwe all rushed in!  I fired up Lullaby (everything in the room con&#39;d blue to<br/>\nme), Lull&#39;d the other gobbies, and we surrounded the MOB  our puller ran to<br/>\nand hit the /assist hotkey.  Four or five MOBs later (with a group of 4 or 5<br/>\nupper 20&#39;-very low 30&#39;s... no nukers or pure tanks, just me, a couple of<br/>\ndruids, and a ranger or two) a few of us were around 1/2 hp, the druids were<br/>\nalmost OOM, but we stood victorious!  Later in the night, however, our<br/>\npuller grabbed a bit more than we could handle (8 or 10, I believe) and I<br/>\nsaw so many resisited Lullabies that I thought someone was playing a joke on<br/>\nme.  Corpse recovery soon followed.<br/>\n    The moral of the story?  When it works, it works WELL, and when it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t... LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>\n(btw, yes it was waaaay more powerful in P4.  Damn the nerfs!)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nBarrd Talespinner<br/>\n30th on The Rathe<br/>\nBaron of the guild of the New OutRiders<br/>\nOne Helluva Nice Guy    ;o)<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: firehawk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Saturday, December 04, 1999 12:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Use for Lullaby at L17...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;firehawk&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Very cool suggestions.

He&#39;d go pull 2-4 and come<br/>\n&gt;&gt; back. He&#39;d use lullaby to keep them all asleep except for the one he was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; attacking. The paladin with us used /assist to target the correct<br/>\n&gt;&gt; target, then tanked it. At the beginning of the fight, I AE&#39;d the mobs<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with Infectious Cloud, a Disease AE DoT. Next pulse he&#39;d put them right<br/>\n&gt;&gt; back to sleep, nixing me off the hate list so I could heal or med<br/>\n&gt;&gt; without being mobbed. By the time the first target was dead, the other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2-3 targets would have been chewed to half health by the AE everytime.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It was quite a sight.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Two things to keep in mind however, his stats were much higher than a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; new player on a L17 because he was outfitted with better equipment, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; he&#39;d also played with many bards all the way to L50 in group on his<br/>\n&gt;&gt; primary character, so he&#39;d been able to see Bards in action and ask many<br/>\n&gt;&gt; questions about the techniques and tricks of others.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ariell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
