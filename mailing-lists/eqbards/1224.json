A Froglok novice cast a passing shot at me: poison.  I sighed relief as I made it out, and immeditely started singing Hymn of Restoration--but before I could sit down... I pass out unconscious!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hovered it seemed a very long time, looking down on my crumpled form, waiting for the poison to kill me... yet I was still singing Hymn of Restoration!  Who would win?  The infernal poison or the bard miraculously singing a rather complex song in his sleep?  A minute passed.  I came to my feet!  Only to swoon into unconsciousness again!  It was madness!  But I will say that this bard never missed a beat in his song and survived!<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
