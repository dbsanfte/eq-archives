You","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1348032228\">Again, I take 2 days off from checking e-mail, and I am flooded with <br/>\nposts :).<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think people should be allowed to bind other people <br/>\nanywhere.  You don&#39;t design a game around the people who can play 6 or <br/>\nmore hours a day, you design it for your average person who plays 3 or <br/>\n4 hours tops, and probably not every day.  For those people, running <br/>\nthrough many zones to get a corpse is by far more of a waste of time <br/>\nthan many of us can imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople talk about the necessary &quot;penalty for dying&quot;.  Fighting your <br/>\nway from Innothule swamp down to the scryer room in upper guk at lvl <br/>\n18 is a penalty.  Losing 3 or 4 hours of exp is a penalty.  Being <br/>\nforced to run through 3 or 4 zones naked is a waste of 30 minutes.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t mind being forced to spend hours getting back to my corpse in a dungeon, or hours making up the experience.  It&#39;s all part of the <br/>\nenjoyment of the game.  However, running from Freeport to Guk, and <br/>\nforcing my group to wait nearly an hour every time I die is just <br/>\nplain dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing able to bind anywhere will mean melee classes are slightly less <br/>\nafraid of dying, true.  But so what?  All it means is that Revive will <br/>\nbe used for its intended purpose (bringing someone back deep into a <br/>\ndungeon when the group wins with casualties).  In fact, if classes <br/>\nwere allowed to bind anywhere, the absurd rules regarding corpse <br/>\nressurections would never have been needed.  One of the primary <br/>\nreasons the rule was changed was that people were leaving duel corpses <br/>\nfor the purpose of being teleported places.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverquest&#39;s status quo is constantly changing.  I remember a time when <br/>\nVerant stated that it was their intent for Selo to always break root.<br/>\nWell... ahem.  Need I say more?  I still don&#39;t know if the current <br/>\nselo/root interaction is a feature or a bug.  Just because Verant has <br/>\ntaken one stance in the past doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right, or shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimary my belief that the way melee classes are treated vs casters<br/>\nis unfair.  There&#39;s no reason inherently in the game that justifies<br/>\nwhy you can only bind others in city zones while you can bind yourself<br/>\nanywhere except as a convenience for lazy programming because they<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like changing it in a way that would prevent malicious <br/>\nbinds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiriana Windryder<br/>\nLvl 50 Cleric<br/>\nLvl 12 Bard<br/>\nInnoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMiriana Windryder<br/>\nPriestess of Tunare<br/>\nInnoruuk Server<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGot Toast?   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etoast.com\">http://www.etoast.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
