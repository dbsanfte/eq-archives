With a skill lvl of 180 in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-90593105\">Ok, does anyone know the *real*, *actual* formula for the maximum weapon<br/>\ndmg?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to explain why i&#39;m confused over this issue.<br/>\nWith a skill lvl of 180 in piercing and 1h slash, and 175 in offense...<br/>\nAnd my strength remained at 116...<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a barbed whip - 7 dmg 28 delay, my maximum dmg was 23.<br/>\nWith a dragoon dirk - 6 dmg 23 delay, my maximum dmg was 21.<br/>\nWith an ashenwood short spear - 6 dmg 22 delay, my maximum dmg was 21.<br/>\nWith a silvery war axe - 6 dmg 22 delay, my maximum dmg was 21.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, all my 6 dmg weapons were maxing at 21. And the barbed<br/>\nwhip, 7 dmg, was maxing at 23.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following formula would be true according to my above examples:<br/>\nWeapon dmg * 2 + skill lvl/strength bonuses. Every couple levels, as my<br/>\nskills increase, my max dmg goes up as well.<br/>\nSo, with my current skill levels and strength factors, it would be<br/>\nWeapon dmg * 2 + 9<br/>\nBarbed whip - 7 * 2 + 9 = 23<br/>\nSilvery axe, dirk, ashenwood spear - 6 * 2 + 9 = 21<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here&#39;s where I became confused and threw a wrench into my whole<br/>\nformula.<br/>\nI equipped a new weapon, which has a dmg of 11.<br/>\nBut, so far (haven&#39;t had oppurtunity to test it a whole lot), its max<br/>\ndmg peaked at 35<br/>\nCertain weapon - 11 * 2 + 9 = 31. So how was I hitting for 35?<br/>\nObviously my formula is not correct.<br/>\nReminding you again, my skill levels and strength stayed constant<br/>\nthrough out this experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what is the correct formula? I haven&#39;t a clue anymore. I sure would<br/>\nlike to know though. Knowledge is power afterall =)<br/>\n<br/>\nJ.M., you&#39;d probably have the most insight into these matters, and<br/>\nyou&#39;ve become the Brad McQuaid of Bards, hehe. So if you know the weapon<br/>\ndmg formula and would like to share, I&#39;d be most interested.<br/>\nIf any other bards, or non-bards for that matter, have some kind of<br/>\ninsight into this matter I&#39;d sure appreciate any light you could shed on<br/>\nthe subject. I don&#39;t want to pin this on J.M., just because he&#39;s a<br/>\ncelebrity now =)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
