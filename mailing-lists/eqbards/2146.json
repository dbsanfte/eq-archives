Like there&#39;d be a lot of characters that still needed/wanted bronze<br/>\nat the point their character would survive in Sol B.<br/>\n<br/>\nMedium bronze is much easier to obtain in Permafrost now. It was dropped<br/>\nby elite ice goblin guards for one. They still conned blue to me when I<br/>\nwas there at L40, thought very little else did.  They aren&#39;t as hard as<br/>\nthe greater kobolds, but still way harder than the ice bones in Unrest<br/>\nthat have been dropping bronze for small races since L22 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppearantly Dresla in Najena used to also drop the occasional piece of<br/>\nbronze plate as well, as I know someone that found it on her, but in the<br/>\nthree days I spent there I saw her drop two pairs of Journeyman boots<br/>\nand an Ashenwood spear but no medium bronze.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to wonder why small bronze plate was so easy to obtain at lower<br/>\nlevels. It seems like that dungeon was designed by Monty Haul compared<br/>\nto anywhere else playable by people in that level range. Now, however, I<br/>\nspend my time wondering why the lovely Black plate chest we found has a<br/>\nclass list of every plate wearer but the bard, an why the bard was<br/>\nremoved as a class who could use the cerrated bone dirk. Oh well, at<br/>\nleast I got a nice face mask that lets me look like a dark elf, though<br/>\nthe effect wears off when you zone so it&#39;s not really all that useful<br/>\nfor visiting a dark city or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
