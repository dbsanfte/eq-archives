I _frequently_ use charm in lower guk if things<br/>\nget out of hand and we get 1 or 2 too many monsters attacking us.  I simply<br/>\nstep out of the fight, charm one and have it attack another un-engaged mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ties up 2 NPC&#39;s while the party deals with the rest.  If we have an<br/>\nenchanter I dont need to worry about it as much but it&#39;s still a VERY useful<br/>\ntactic.   However, it&#39;s a VERY useful tactic that GOES AWAY once the NPC&#39;s<br/>\nwe fight are over level 37.  Bet your ass I want charm upgraded.  It&#39;s FAR<br/>\nmore powerful outdoors but then again there are 26 new zones going in in the<br/>\nkunark expansion.  MANY will be outdoor zones.  So even THAT aspect of Charm<br/>\nwill still be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hate it when a bard who hasn&#39;t explored all the uses for the more<br/>\npowerful songs we get disses one as &quot;it&#39;s not useful&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll state rather bluntly that there isn&#39;t a single song in our lineup<br/>\n(except maybe the Chant series and some of the psalms) that I don&#39;t/haven&#39;t<br/>\n_needed_ to use at one point or another.  They&#39;re all useful.  Sure some<br/>\nmore than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd NO, I DONT want form over function.  I don&#39;t really care if my song<br/>\nLOOKS cool.  I want it to be something I can USE.<br/>\n<br/>\nOOOO FLASHY LIGHTS<br/>\n<br/>\numm no offense... who needs the light show if it doesn&#39;t make me more<br/>\neffective in the team?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
