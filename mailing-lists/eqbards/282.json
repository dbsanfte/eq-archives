I awoke today to find 55 new mesages <br/>\nin my mail and not even 1/4 of them are what this is suppose to be <br/>\nused for. If you have a problem with someones guild or how they are <br/>\nplaying the game Stop following them around and do what you want. <br/>\nThis is meant to be fun and some people want to do it differently <br/>\nthen others. Hell if there is a guild out there that i really like <br/>\nand have fun with i could care less about paying 100 pp to get into <br/>\nit. This is what you make of it. I am a 14th lvl Bard and currently <br/>\nworking on blacksmithing in my free time. I am doing this to get the <br/>\nprized armor and hopefully make alot of loot. But i do plan on <br/>\nstarting a guild and probly will charge ??(alot) to get into it. The <br/>\nreason being is that i will make banded for anyone in my guild at <br/>\ncost.  Does that sound like a bad thing?? Just curious why so many <br/>\npeople complain about pp&#39;s to join guilds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso for some of you having problems finding some of the songs,(i <br/>\nwont say which ones cause i dont like to spoil anything in this game <br/>\nfor anyone else) there are some songs on a merchant inside the <br/>\nHighhold. This is quite a trip for some of you but well worth it. The <br/>\nviews are wonderful from the hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn and around the beautiful city of Qeynos(sonyeq)is where I frequent <br/>\nand if any bards would like to trade stories or just go out and <br/>\nadventure or even need some help with a problem, give me a shout.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly  HAVE FUN<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Hunting<br/>\n<br/>\nMaraxus of Qeynos    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kleit@...\">kleit@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Not appropriate<br/>\n&gt;Date: 26 Apr 1999 13:57:06 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kleit@...\">kleit@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While i am not a member of the soerbaird nor have i ever met a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>member, i still think that the opinions put forth ford and greg are <br/>\nnot fit to print.  this is an information source not a general gripe <br/>\nboard.  please let the rest of us make up out minds about people when <br/>\nwe meet them. i am a journalist in that other realm known as earth <br/>\nand what you wrote would there be called libel.  please be civil my <br/>\nbrothers.  we are all here to have fun.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Olczyk of Qeynos<br/>\n&gt;tarew marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Start a new hobby.
