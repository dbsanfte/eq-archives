Is this area in the southeast corner where they are<br/>\nlocated?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note...<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the Login Server down?  My son is home sick and can&#39;t seem to log in.<br/>\nI&#39;m at work so I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s doing anything wrong.  I installed<br/>\nEvermon here and tried to check, but can&#39;t connect.  However, I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhether this is because the server is down or Evermon won&#39;t work thru the<br/>\nCompany&#39;s firewall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the good info on the Rathe Mtns,<br/>\n<br/>\nTomerrilin <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, February 28, 2000 12:27 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Rathe Mtns.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 28 Feb 2000, Perhaps a Princess... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are also giant skeletons to the left just after you come in from<br/>\n&gt; Feerott.
