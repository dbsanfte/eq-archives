PoG drops the items, Giants simply do not drop the items (needed<br/>\n&gt; for questing) at a rate anywhere close to PoG *and* some gems are still<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; found yet.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would guess that Verant made a mistake in PoG - I am guessing that they<br/>\n&gt; thought it would be uber-hard - or at least as hard as the &quot;other ways&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; get the similar items.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They continue to fail to understand what motivates the players.  On top of<br/>\n&gt; that, they do not structure the &quot;reward system&quot; to support the &quot;content&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (role play, history, lore, etc) or background story.  In some ways, it is<br/>\n&gt; interesting that players can &quot;choose&quot; who to side with but it is a joke<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; them to ignore the fact that the majority of players will follow the<br/>\n&gt; course<br/>\n&gt; of least resistence toward the path of the most loot. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reeves, Patrick W [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pwr3@...\">pwr3@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 24, 2001 9:42 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; True.
