The way the game is designed, the bard will<br/>\nusually end up taking the brunt of the damage in the party.  <br/>\nWe may not dish out much damage, but we sure take a lot of it.  <br/>\nIt is better for the entire party if the person taking the<br/>\nmost damage is encased in good armor.  The last few days of<br/>\nplaying at L17 have made this clear to me (I seem to be the<br/>\nmost common target for my paladin friends&#39; lay of hands).  <br/>\nI&#39;m starting to experiment more with holding off my initial<br/>\nattack until the monster(s) are fixated on someone else.  I&#39;m<br/>\nalso going to start spending most of my money upgrading all my<br/>\narmor, something I&#39;ve been neglecting up til now.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
