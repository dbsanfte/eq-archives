(in terms of<br/>\nweapons?)<br/>\nHas anyone tried to make a group of 6 bards doing that AOE song and just<br/>\nwalk around in a dungeon?  I&#39;m just curious how effective that group<br/>\nwould be?<br/>\nWhat do you guys do with all your practices (hmm maybe I should see<br/>\nquestion 1)?  It seems most of our skills going up pretty well on their<br/>\nown with  alittle priming...<br/>\nI was using the Discord song to just kite fire beetles for real nice xp<br/>\nat lvl 3, is this considered an abuse? (I actualyl try to never take<br/>\nadvantage of games &quot;flaws&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, thanks to all the bards who helped me this weekend!  You guys<br/>\n(and gals) are the best!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
