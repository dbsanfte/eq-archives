But I never successfully used Lullaby to pull a mob<br/>\nthat someone had soloed to almost-dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nPixie Strike is reputed to clear the hate list too.  My<br/>\nexperience has been that it hasn&#39;t, but twice it *may* have.<br/>\nThe first time I was playing around with death beetles and had<br/>\njust hit one with strike when I had to run to help some<br/>\nfriends.  The beetle never &quot;caught up&quot; to me later.  The<br/>\nsecond time, I&#39;d used it on a mob I&#39;d 80% killed.  Someone<br/>\nelse finished the mob off and got the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have seen a noticeable change in the way this song behaves.  Grouped with a<br/>\n&gt; rogue, we made quite a team with this song and a backstab... no longer.  Try<br/>\n&gt; dueling the caster again.  I cannot see any melee class winning a duel with<br/>\n&gt; a caster!  Casters rule EverQuest, plain and simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to stop short of agreeing with you until I see how<br/>\nthe level 35 song works.  It supposedly drains mana.  If it<br/>\nworks like the other debuffs, it shouldn&#39;t interfere with<br/>\nmesmerize.  So you should be able to hit a caster with Pixie<br/>\nStrike and drain their mana without them ever waking up.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
