The philistines<br/>\nclearly don&#39;t like good music!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Dunno your level or type of group you play with, but you are in error (not a<br/>\n&gt;direct personal attack, maybe just misinformed). A friend of mine (Druid 50)<br/>\n&gt;and myself (Warrior 45) are able to clear out the Princess, Butler, Maid,<br/>\n&gt;Vampire, and gypsy (late, cant think of the exact names) spots in about 15<br/>\n&gt;mins. Only had to evac once and that was due to someone having a look see,<br/>\n&gt;and not conning the will sappers who see through invis. Pulled quite an<br/>\n&gt;impressive train, and hope he could appreciate how big it was. Maybe take<br/>\n&gt;some comfort his death impressed others =)<br/>\n&gt;As to bards in there, way back when a lot of us were around 35 we took a<br/>\n&gt;party in there containing two bards, a cleric, druid, warrior and necro. No<br/>\n&gt;one died, and it was great fun playing around inside the castle. Just take a<br/>\n&gt;group of people that you trust not to dork out on you, and that you have<br/>\n&gt;played together a lot, and you will do fine.<br/>\n&gt;Do it at the lower levels, cause once you hit 45 plus, place turns into<br/>\n&gt;green hell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Have fun out there<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kragan<br/>\n&gt;Mith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n<br/>\nSaldara<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard (27), Mith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nMelaniel<br/>\nWood Elf Bard (14), Mith Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
