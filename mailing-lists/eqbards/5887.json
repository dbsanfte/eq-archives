I learned<br/>\nthis the hard way when my sister handed me a Paw of Oppalla and asked<br/>\nme to identify the ring inside (which she knew was a waste of time<br/>\nanyway).  I didn&#39;t have a spare inventory slot and the paw fell on the<br/>\nground.  When I picked it up, no ring.  I petitioned and the guide I<br/>\ntalked to responded basically, &quot;You should have known that would<br/>\nhappen,&quot; and &quot;No, I can&#39;t restore the item.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPurna</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
