When I first got EQ - I<br/>\nplayed a Warrior for a few levels to learn the Interface with no intention<br/>\nof it being my permanent char.  When I read up on the classes - I like the<br/>\nmusician angle (especially with the instruments).<br/>\nAs I got deeper in the game - I really enjoyed the class.  Being a support<br/>\nchar fits my personality.  The fact that I&#39;m an underused class leading to<br/>\ninvites on raids and such - and being the only bard in the guild (there was<br/>\nanother one for a while but he either quit or plays other chars in other<br/>\nguilds not sure)<br/>\nAnd if not for the last patch - I was starting to think things were actually<br/>\nimproving vis-├á-vis Verant&#39;s attitude towards us...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
