Here is some of the advise that he<br/>\n&gt; gives me.  I&#39;m not loot hungry so I probably won&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; it and it seems like you are not either, but it will<br/>\n&gt; atleast help you get your banded.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First of all make sure you are hunting a loot heavy<br/>\n&gt; zone.  What I mean is since you are lvl 11, the best<br/>\n&gt; place for you would be either Crushbone(Kelethin) or<br/>\n&gt; Splitpaw (South Karanas) or of course the Derv camps.<br/>\n&gt; I myself am not a big derv fan, because of all the<br/>\n&gt; camping.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Next make sure you find a party that is high enough<br/>\n&gt; level to not care about loot in that zone.  For<br/>\n&gt; example find a party of lvl 16+ that will take you in<br/>\n&gt; as an understudy.  That way they will  let you loot<br/>\n&gt; practically everything that comes their way, because<br/>\n&gt; they probably care more about the exp.  Make sure you<br/>\n&gt; let them know, that these are your intentions.  This<br/>\n&gt; is a an effective, but seldom used technique.  I have<br/>\n&gt; done it a few times and I made about 15-20pp a night.<br/>\n&gt; But it got old.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finally don&#39;t leave out anything, sell everything.  I<br/>\n&gt; have seen a lot of people get shoulder pads, or<br/>\n&gt; legionnaire belts or rustys, and I&#39;ve seen them just<br/>\n&gt; leave it on the corpse.  DON&#39;T!  It all adds up.  Just<br/>\n&gt; keep collecting and selling, keep collecting and<br/>\n&gt; selling.  It takes discipline, but in about 3-4 days<br/>\n&gt; you will be able to afford a full suit of banded.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh and one last thing, if you are hunting in<br/>\n&gt; Crushbone.  Make sure you sell at the Warror&#39;s guild<br/>\n&gt; in kelethin, they give great prices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok I hope that helps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Farewell,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sedaien Reyvon<br/>\n&gt; lvl 20 Bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 22 Jun 1999 03:54:29 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Michal Hobson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Cash flow problems<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hail and well met again,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I am requesting the assistance of some of you yet<br/>\n&gt; again.  Tonight I<br/>\n&gt; finally made the 11th rank.  We were in W. Commons<br/>\n&gt; killing the Derv&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; when lo and behold a werewolf arrived and decimated<br/>\n&gt; all but 2 of us,<br/>\n&gt; myself and a ranger friend.  Upon zoning to E. Commons<br/>\n&gt; and then<br/>\n&gt; returning to the Bard&#39;s guild, I came to the<br/>\n&gt; realization that I needed<br/>\n&gt; &quot;real&quot; armor.  Up to this point, I have been wearing<br/>\n&gt; all leather.  It<br/>\n&gt; is affordable and light but is not as effective<br/>\n&gt; against the Derv&#39;s and<br/>\n&gt; such.  I NEED BANDED!!!<br/>\n&gt;     And now on to my problem, where do I pick up the<br/>\n&gt; plat to buy this<br/>\n&gt; wonderful armor?  I seem to only make around 5 pp a<br/>\n&gt; night at best.<br/>\n&gt; Would joining a guild help me in this situation?  If<br/>\n&gt; so does anyone no<br/>\n&gt; any good guilds on Erollisi Marr?  I&#39;ve taken to<br/>\n&gt; fighting darkweeds but<br/>\n&gt; there is far too much downtime.  The orc cents in my<br/>\n&gt; area have very<br/>\n&gt; little loot, so soloing in this area is pretty<br/>\n&gt; worthless.  The derv&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; have lovely loot, but I am afraid of grouping with<br/>\n&gt; people I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n&gt;  Especially in a zone like W. Commons.  Tonight they<br/>\n&gt; actually attacked<br/>\n&gt; the werewolf!!<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday someone in my group decided, despite my<br/>\n&gt; warnings, to walk up<br/>\n&gt; and slap Lord Shin Ree.  What should I do?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you in advance for your advice,<br/>\n&gt; Weiland of Freeport<br/>\n&gt; 11th Rank Bard of Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do fashion and football have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
