My guild and another one had a guildwar<br/>\nin the Lake Rathe Arena last night so for the first time in weeks I left<br/>\nKunark and returned to Antonica.  Guess its time to head to Qeynos, which I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been to in several months of playtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I learned last night that a 38 bard doesn&#39;t fare to well against a 45<br/>\nmage in PVP.  I got rid of the pet fairly easily with fear but the mage kept<br/>\nresisting my chains and fears all the time.  When I got to 50% health, the<br/>\nmage was still at 75% health.  I switched to bellow, bellow and elemental in<br/>\nhopes that I could interrupt spells and if a spell did get off, elemental<br/>\nwould reduce the damage.  That didn&#39;t work out to well either when I got hit<br/>\nby back to back DD spells.  My duel against a 37 cleric though was a<br/>\ndifferent story.  I won that one fairly easily.  All I did the entire fight<br/>\nwas chains/fear/bellow.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Talies the Wanderer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 15, 2000 10:19 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Patch Message - FABIAN!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Patch Day*<br/>\n<br/>\nHello everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The <br/>\nHole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number <br/>\nof changes and additions were made in today&#39;s patch.  Most of the changes <br/>\nare in regards to quests:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The &quot;Fleshy Orb&quot; quest has been completed<br/>\n- We&#39;ve received word that &quot;Fabian&quot; has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br/>\n- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br/>\n- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br/>\n- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost <br/>\nCircle.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few items have also been changed this week:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br/>\n- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a <br/>\nshort casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<br/>\n- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when <br/>\nyou log off (See Below.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br/>\n<br/>\nWe received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to <br/>\n&quot;spam&quot; other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to <br/>\ndisconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages <br/>\ncaused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out <br/>\nspell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the <br/>\ntargetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have <br/>\nto stand still to use them now.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Gunthak Harpoon*<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon <br/>\n&quot;rentable&quot;, meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one <br/>\nof our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it <br/>\nmust be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats <br/>\non this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical <br/>\ncomposition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in <br/>\nobtaining it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the <br/>\nnext time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect <br/>\nweapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it <br/>\nwithin the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Chat / Login Process*<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning <br/>\nthat players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of <br/>\npeople in the chat server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The EverQuest Team<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nOld school buds here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5545/10/_/451022/_/961100562/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5545/10/_/451022/_/961100562/</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
