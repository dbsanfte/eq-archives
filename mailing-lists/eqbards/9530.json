I was on my necro the other day doing a quest and in<br/>\nUnrest the zone had only 19 people in it during prime time. Then CT is just<br/>\nas empty to. Then you go and look at Lower Guk and Sol B and see it pakced<br/>\nwith 50+ people in it. Thanks to the new kith zone and PoH the high levels<br/>\nare finnally starting to spreadout. It&#39;s a lot better that it&#39;s a high level<br/>\nzone then a low level zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaldaek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimes, Dean W. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, November 01, 1999 5:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I had heard a few complaints from newbies that they were now cut off from<br/>\n&gt;travelling to their guild in Qeynos, but since Kithicor was as safe as ever<br/>\n&gt;during the day hours I find this unjustified.  It was good to see Verant<br/>\n&gt;making some real storyline related changes to a zone.  I just wish they<br/>\n&gt;could effectively do those sort of things at a lower level, say in the 25<br/>\n&gt;range instead of 40.

From<br/>\n&gt;what I saw in Beta it was no match for EQ despite the problems in EQ.<br/>\n&gt;There were some really sweet weapons a bard could use on some of those<br/>\n&gt;undead apparently.  sadly I was unable to get any even though most of the<br/>\n&gt;people I saw fighting them would have zero use for them.  Its a bit<br/>\n&gt;irritating to watch a 50th level paladin scooping up no drop piercing<br/>\n&gt;weapons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Kevin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wethington@...\">wethington@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 1:33 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Undead drops in Kithicor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Kevin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wethington@...\">wethington@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Methinks you are being a bit harsh on Verant.  The Kithicor and Lake Rathe<br/>\n&gt;events are probably testing grounds for some kind of changes to the zones.<br/>\n&gt;Verant has so few people on the Test Server that they have to do things on<br/>\n&gt;live servers to see how things will actually work.  Trust me Verant has 1.5<br/>\n&gt;million reasons per month to want you to be happy.  With the retail release<br/>\n&gt;of Asheron&#39;s Call yesterday I think Verant is going to be very aggressive<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;retaining and growing their current player base.
