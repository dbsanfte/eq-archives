My suggestion to<br/>\nyou is to practice using whatever buff song you have (probably Anthem or<br/>\nthe Warsong if you&#39;re solo) and right after you get your message about the<br/>\nAnthem, hit the button for the Bellow.  When you see the monster glow, hit<br/>\nthe button for the Anthem again.  Remember, you have to actually hit it<br/>\ntwice: once to stop the current song in progress, and once to start a new<br/>\nsong.  Also remember that your buffing song is more important, so if you<br/>\nare stunned or miss a note more than once, switch back to the Anthem (or<br/>\nWarsong).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some friendly helpful suggestions,<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Wanderer<br/>\nCheck out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
