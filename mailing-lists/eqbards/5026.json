If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone has one can I buy it from them?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What if someone who can&#39;t equip it loots<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it off the creature that drops it? Does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that mean it is forever unusable?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s my experience with the most annoying NO DROP setting..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My wife was killed, gave me /consent to loot her body and I was unable to<br/>\n&gt; loot 2 backpacks she was carrying because they had NO DROP items in them.<br/>\n&gt; (Don&#39;t recall what they were at this time)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A semi-newbie quest in Freeport to kill Lydl the Great results in being<br/>\n&gt; able<br/>\n&gt; to pickup a book from his body that is NO DROP. My new wizard and a friend<br/>\n&gt; kill him (I die in the process) and my friend loots the body so it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; disappear while I make my way back. He&#39;s not a Wizard and can&#39;t complete<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; quest. He also can&#39;t give me the book.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only solution around this, as was suggested by someone else on this<br/>\n&gt; list, is to give the item to a mob and then kill the mob to loot the item.<br/>\n&gt; You can give NO DROP items to NPC&#39;s because of the need to be able to do<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; for quests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; LORE items I understand, the NO DROP items have gotten a little carried<br/>\n&gt; away. BurnedOut Lightstones for example. Why can&#39;t I give those away to<br/>\n&gt; someone? They&#39;re not a quest, they&#39;re not valuable loot, what the hey?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\n&gt; Join our community member news update at <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
