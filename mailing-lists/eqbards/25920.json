It&#39;s one big, huge<br/>\nmaze of a castle: hallways, courtyards, and rooms. A number of the mobs are<br/>\ntriggered, which makes them hard/impossible to split. The weird thing is the<br/>\nmobs proc a spell on the players that turns you into a random mob. No stat<br/>\nchanges that we&#39;ve seen, you just look different. All the mobs look<br/>\ndifferent to every player too so you can&#39;t say &#39;I&#39;m on the zombie thing!&#39;,<br/>\n&#39;cause each person in your group sees a different mob. If you&#39;ve got folks<br/>\nthat need a crash course on assisting a main tank, this is the zone! We&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten some nifty odd drops in this zone, warrior helm with +25% taunt,<br/>\nstone with +10% alchemy. We&#39;ve crawled thru it a couple times, found Grieg<br/>\nhimself but lacked the strength to kill him. We did kill the Servitor of<br/>\nLuclin and a couple other nameds. This zone seems to be designed for a<br/>\ncrawl, not as much setup and camp. We&#39;ve done both though and I found the<br/>\nexp there to move in 59, that means it was pretty good. Grieg&#39;s has 2<br/>\nentrances: from Dawnshroud where most of my tracking sees green and some<br/>\nblues at 59 and from Scarlet Desert where tracking shows all blue.<br/>\nMaiden&#39;s Eye is cool, I like killing Xin&#39;s and especially the 4 armed purple<br/>\nthings. The exp there is really good. Umbrial is pretty neat, just went<br/>\nthere Tuesday night and got some decent armor drops. We&#39;ve had a lot of fun<br/>\nkilling vamps in Tenebrous Mtns, too.<br/>\nI probably was afk in Shar Vahl, I spent time last week running multiple<br/>\ntoons and doing the Rallic pack quest multiple times. Great pack, easy<br/>\nquest: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/luclin_rallicpack.htm\">http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/luclin_rallicpack.htm</a> <br/>\nSpeaking of quests, my wiz finished her 7th Coldain Shawl the day Luclin<br/>\ncame out! I spent A lot of time doing tradeskills with her last fall. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t wait to see what heinous things the 8th and 9th shawls will require.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe 60 Bard<br/>\nBrilinia Ilsidi 52 wizard w/ her own personal Flappy<br/>\nBrillinia Klagetsdautter 36 cleric<br/>\nVenator Sapentia, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
