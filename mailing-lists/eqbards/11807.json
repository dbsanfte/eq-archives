I&#39;m not trying<br/>\nto take away anything from your experience - perhaps broaden your horizons<br/>\njust a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess in my apparently inept way - I&#39;m advising you to stop and smell the<br/>\nflowers.

If you enjoy fishing,<br/>\n&gt;  baking, brewing, telling stories around the campfire, then that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  your POV.  I&#39;m not gonna waste 10bux a month to essentially IRC<br/>\n&gt;  with pretty graphics.  I want to advance, I want to have some<br/>\n&gt;  goodies, and I want to show those goodies off to people because<br/>\n&gt;  I spent the time to earn them.  I want to be a powerful element<br/>\n&gt;  to plane attacks and dragon raids.  I was in a group last night<br/>\n&gt;  that dinged two L49 people to L50.  L50 people are turning out like<br/>\n&gt;  mad.  I&#39;m feeling the crunch too.  Nagafen&#39;s Lair and Lower Guk<br/>\n&gt;  are becoming so crowded that it&#39;s rare to even see monsters, let<br/>\n&gt;  alone fight them.  I know for a fact that there are at least 100<br/>\n&gt;  L50 people on Innoruuk and we add one more avg each day it seems.<br/>\n&gt;  When 1/16th of your server&#39;s population is 50, and probably another<br/>\n&gt;  3/16th is L35+ that spells trouble and crowding.  Trying to squeeze<br/>\n&gt;  a quarter of the server into two zones really hurts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The whole premise behind your posts is what makes you, yourself<br/>\n&gt;  happy.  I honestly find your selfish ripostes to comments about<br/>\n&gt;  the whole community very weak and one sided.  What I didn&#39;t miss <br/>\n&gt;  is your careless attitude, however.  Whatever makes silky&#39;s 10<br/>\n&gt;  dollars count isn&#39;t why I play the game, btw.  And while I respect<br/>\n&gt;  anyone&#39;s opinion including yours, you are very much lacking the<br/>\n&gt;  delivery of your opinion in an organized, non-offensive manner. <br/>\n&gt;  It&#39;s like you&#39;ve got something to prove about yourself, and at<br/>\n&gt;  the same time you trying to disprove any statement that comes <br/>\n&gt;  down the pipe.  It&#39;s a rare day to see you post complimenting <br/>\n&gt;  anything.  I suppose I can continue wishing. 8)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>with the subject submissions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
