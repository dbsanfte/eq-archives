While for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most part I still have fun, on the nights when I join up <br/>\n&gt; with the world&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most inept group or worse can&#39;t find a group I begin to <br/>\n&gt; think about hanging<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the lute up and calling it quits.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is my biggest problem with the game.  I&#39;m level 28 and up until<br/>\n&gt; this point, my boyfriend and I could just go around and hunt in a pair<br/>\n&gt; and make decent exp.  Together, we have acquired a full set of crafted<br/>\n&gt; for him and an almost complete set of lambent for myself (I&#39;m missing<br/>\n&gt; the helm, bp, and boots right now).  Yes, for some of this, we joined<br/>\n&gt; a larger group or, in his case, bought 2 or 3 pieces that we couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get ourselves.  Lately, we&#39;ve had a wizard from my guild join us, so I<br/>\n&gt; basically have a regular 3 person group.  This is not enough to do<br/>\n&gt; much of anything anymore.  At our level (my 28, wiz 28, bf 30) ,<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s not much to kill outdoors and breaking into a decent spot in a<br/>\n&gt; dungeon requires a full group.  So, here&#39;s my little grouping<br/>\n&gt; mini-rant.  Two nights ago, we took over the Permafrost king room from<br/>\n&gt; a level 50 who was looking for a cloak.  I sat in a preacher room<br/>\n&gt; group until the rest showed up; the rest being my 2 regulars and a<br/>\n&gt; friend of the wizard who had grouped with us a couple of times before.<br/>\n&gt; We waited at least 2 hours to take the room over, not counting the<br/>\n&gt; time it took them to get a teleport from Unrest to North Karana and<br/>\n&gt; run to Permafrost.  Once the room was secured, we were fine.  An honor<br/>\n&gt; guard spawned with a 2 hander and we let the wiz&#39;s roll, since they<br/>\n&gt; had helped us out before and hadn&#39;t really gotten any of the good<br/>\n&gt; stuff.  The non-regular won, and shortly thereafter, deserted us while<br/>\n&gt; we were trying to find his replacement.  Note to self:  my regular<br/>\n&gt; group is not enough to hold the room.  The high priest spawned and<br/>\n&gt; killed all 3 of us, starting with the nuker.  After corpse retrieval,<br/>\n&gt; with the help of a really nice level 47 druid from my guild, it was<br/>\n&gt; 12:30am and I was back where I started for the night.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is typical of my experiences lately.  Either we can&#39;t find enough<br/>\n&gt; people to take a room in a dungeon or we can, but can&#39;t find a room to<br/>\n&gt; take.  And once we finally take the room, someone has to leave so<br/>\n&gt; we either have to find a replacement quickly or leave the room<br/>\n&gt; ourselves.  At least most people who have to leave warn us enough<br/>\n&gt; ahead of time that the new person arrives as soon as they disband. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve started to feel like I&#39;m wasting my time playing. Sure,<br/>\n&gt; occasionally I&#39;ll have a really great time (Gnomestock was a blast,<br/>\n&gt; and once I was in a group killing the diplomat in Permafrost which was<br/>\n&gt; great), but those times are few and far between now.  Even being in a<br/>\n&gt; guild doesn&#39;t seem to help much...Does anyone have any ideas on how to<br/>\n&gt; make this feel more worthwhile?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A very discouraged Robynn Merrilin, on E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Katy Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.  <br/>\n&gt;          <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\n&gt; CS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Independent contractors: Find your next project gig through JobSwarm!<br/>\n&gt;         You can even make $$$ by referring friends.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/jobswarm2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
