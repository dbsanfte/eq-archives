Their items will deteriorate and will break.  This is a<br/>\nfact of life.  Car engines last immensely longer if you change the oil every<br/>\n3000 miles religiously and yet I know many people who don&#39;t.  Just because<br/>\nwear can be prevented does not mean it will be, especially if you have to<br/>\nrun all the way to a city to get it done.  Some people will take excellent<br/>\ncare of their equipment, others will be too lazy or forgetful to do so and<br/>\nwill suffer for it.

It lets you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;keep items rare while keeping the mobs common.  It also stops<br/>\n&gt; &gt;harvesting dead in its tracks.  The only really bad part is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that you can&#39;t continuously camp a mob until you get the item<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you want, but then, that&#39;s really the root of all these<br/>\n&gt; &gt;problems isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mhh if I understand this as:<br/>\n&gt; You can only loot a named mob ONCE, regardless of what it have.<br/>\n&gt; I can see a couple of problems with it:<br/>\n&gt; - Some mobs you can tell if its the rare or the common drop it carries.<br/>\n&gt; So youll have people killing it until its drop is rare and then looting<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust create dummy objects which are &quot;mundane&quot; but have the<br/>\nsame graphic as both drops, and load one of each all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; - Even on mobs where the drop isent visable this could be used, unless the<br/>\nmere<br/>\n&gt; examination of the body would count as a loot? Imagine being attacked<br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt; trying to loot your ghoulbane *ouch*..<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of any occasion where we&#39;ve killed something,<br/>\nbeen able to examine it, but died/had to leave before we could<br/>\nloot it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This would make items very rare indeed, but also open up for some serius<br/>\nflaws<br/>\n&gt; IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying it&#39;s without flaws.  What I&#39;m saying is that<br/>\nthe flaws seem to be more acceptable IMHO than the flaws that<br/>\ncome with the current system - extreme mob rarity, camping,<br/>\nharvest, selling on ebay, etc.  It&#39;d be more in keeping with<br/>\nthe fiction as well - you kill Dvinn and for all intents and<br/>\npurposes he&#39;s dead in your universe, no need to kill him again<br/>\n(though you could choose to to help someone kill him in their<br/>\nuniverse).  If you didn&#39;t get the dirk from him, you could<br/>\nalways trade for it, except now you know that any item you<br/>\ntrade for is not going to have been attained via harvesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think the only viable way to get items out of circulation is to make<br/>\nthem wear<br/>\n&gt; out. If its possible to mend them it should be done by NPC&#39;s and be priced<br/>\nupon<br/>\n&gt; what &quot;level&quot; of equipment we are talking about and price comparable with<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; indgrediants casters use. In a way so that the expences per played hour is<br/>\n&gt; around the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, if you make it possible to repair wear<br/>\ncompletely, then it&#39;s the same thing as not having wear except<br/>\nwhen people get hit by bugs or make stupid mistakes.  And that<br/>\nalready happens for item destruction (items eaten in trade<br/>\nbugs, accidently selling/giving items to NPCs, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nPartial repair is the same thing as a slower wear rate, just<br/>\nmore inconvenient since you have to take time to repair stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; As it is today melee classes havent got any expenses other than food and<br/>\ninitial<br/>\n&gt; costs of equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, likewise for the casting classes.  Once you buy the<br/>\nspells, that&#39;s it.  Yeah there are some reagent costs, but<br/>\nmost are trivial by the time you&#39;re high enough level to use<br/>\nthe spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
