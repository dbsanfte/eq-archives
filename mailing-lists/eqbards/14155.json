They continued to<br/>\nsuck<br/>\n&gt; in Unrest. Ditto, Cazic. Sol-B. And Lower Guk.  People just don&#39;t change<br/>\n&gt; much.  You get the kind that is so focused on loot that unless they are<br/>\n&gt; getting loot - they are sure someone else is stealing it from them.  They<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t trust others because they project their own personality traits.  On<br/>\n&gt; our server, we have recent reports of a guy in lower guk stealing off a<br/>\n&gt; party member who has died and has given consent to drag. Instead of<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; better at high levels - it seems like it gets worse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In reality, it&#39;s just the same idiots but instead of level 5, they are<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; 50.  Do you honestly expect that someone is going to have major<br/>\npersonality<br/>\n&gt; changes in like 6 to 9 months simply by playing a computer game? Granted<br/>\n&gt; some do, but for the most part - they don&#39;t. Any power they get just<br/>\n&gt; enhances already ingrained traits.  Simply a guild does not cure this<br/>\n&gt; either.  There are plenty of guilds with bickering about loots.  But if<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; are guilded and you are with your guild group, at least you know what to<br/>\n&gt; expect and you maybe have some standard loot rules.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; &lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bardette of 43 songs<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Cranfill, Wendy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 01, 2000 12:43 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Ok I need advice...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Cranfill, Wendy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendy_Cranfill@...\">Wendy_Cranfill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night....

I<br/>\n&gt; am experimenting with a few different classes, but I have 2 bards at level<br/>\n5<br/>\n&gt; (started half-elf bard in Kelethin &lt;only place to start a half elf bard<br/>\n&gt; there&gt;). I have 2 bards because I started a half elf bard first on the<br/>\nfirst<br/>\n&gt; week of release and couldn&#39;t get any Medium size armour in Kelethin.  So<br/>\n&gt; that bard tweaked (hehe a level 5 tweaking a level 1) my Wood elf bard and<br/>\n&gt; she leveled up quickly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The point is if some folks find that they get bored on their regular<br/>\nserver,<br/>\n&gt; doing the same old same old, then try a pvp server.  I have decided to try<br/>\n&gt; to make an Troll Shadow Knight now.  His mission will be to kill casters<br/>\n&gt; (most casters are Human and Elf based).  He will be a sort of anti-PK<br/>\npk&#39;er.<br/>\n&gt;   His MO will be to shadow step and hunt down those medding casters  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, ok....that is just an idea based on frustration, but it does add a<br/>\nwhole<br/>\n&gt; new dimension to the game.  If you have friends or guildmates that you<br/>\ncould<br/>\n&gt; convince to meet you with you on a pvp server, then you could watch each<br/>\n&gt; other&#39;s backs, and hunt PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s alike.  And be hunted :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am now level 40 on Cazic Thule server, and quite sick of waiting lists<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; the like.  I also have a hard time with the Hill Giants, because I get<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; fighting and some group or other will move in and kill em off for me<br/>\n  I<br/>\n&gt; just want a short diversion.  Nothing permanent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone else have a secondary character on the pvp servers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fflewduer Fflamson 40 Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt; Aria 5 Vallon Zek<br/>\n&gt; Brushof SK lvl 1 Vallon Zek  (should he be a REALLY bad Troll and lay<br/>\nwaste<br/>\n&gt; to medding casters?)<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 1 Feb 2000 18:02:48 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Valharick@...\">Valharick@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Mask of Deception and ultravision<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yep Ive got the new mask and it gives me UV just fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 1 Feb 2000 13:12:48 -1000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Mask of Deception and ultravision<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well this is definately strange because it isn&#39;t working for me.  I was in<br/>\n&gt; Ogguk fighting bouncers near the zone when I activated the illusion.<br/>\nThere<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t a light source there so it became very dark.  When I told my party I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t see anymore, the shaman buffed me with Ultravision and I could<br/>\nthen<br/>\n&gt; see very well.  The ultravision buff from the shaman gave everything a<br/>\n&gt; bluish tint to it so thats how I knew that the DE illusion wasn&#39;t working.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The end result is that I hardly ever activate the illusion anymore.

I cannot remember if we covered all of these questions,<br/>\nand I<br/>\n&gt; have missed about a week&#39;s worth of posts, so please bear with me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I split the frenzied room in Lower Guk last night with Lament (to the<br/>\namazement of<br/>\n&gt; some group members, by the way, who said the frenzied _always_ comes - go<br/>\nbards!!).<br/>\n&gt; I am level 48 and the frenzied is only about 45 I think.  I have pulled<br/>\nSol B king<br/>\n&gt; area; it is no problem with Lament.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have not tried to split the Lord room in Lower, although it is quite<br/>\nopen and<br/>\n&gt; would be easy to try.  The King room is a different story.  Seems you<br/>\nwould have to<br/>\n&gt; invis into the room to get into a position to even try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, the group of 4 fire giants in Sol B - I know they cannot be<br/>\nmesmerized.  Is<br/>\n&gt; lament the same spell type and thus also not applicable?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another question relating to pulling. John, you have used pumice<br/>\nextensively.  What<br/>\n&gt; is its range?  I hear it is quite large.  Now that debuffing causes a mob<br/>\nto aggro,<br/>\n&gt; could you use the pumice as a ranged weapon with which to pull?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Comments and suggestions about pulling higher level areas are welcome 8).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finally, I felt sick to my stomach as I saw the second resist messages<br/>\nflow when I<br/>\n&gt; tried out Pixie and Lullaby in Lower Guk Frenzied area last night.

Lake is no problem, even get the group all sing &quot;Come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sail away&quot; on the boat.  (I love getting the messages to stop spamming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the /ooc channel). &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ugh! I&#39;m one of those people who find this stuff to be annoying. I mean,<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re doing it on /say or /group that&#39;s fine, but IMO (nothing humble<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; it) it is obnoxious to broadcast this stuff and revel in the complaints.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But in your favor, at least you&#39;re doing it on ooc where I can turn this<br/>\n&gt; off. :-P I really hate when people do this stuff on shout, which is<br/>\n&gt; necessary for train updates. *Windleaf ducks the pie thrown by Papa*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am not saying this to bash Verant, to try to get you to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quit or try to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get you to convince me to keep playing (I have neglected too<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much RL for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this game).  Verant as a whole did a great job with this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game.  Perhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thats the problem, it is so tantalizing close to greatness that its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; short-comings glare so brightly.  Most of the people playing are fun,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; polite, and enhance the experience.  However they only make the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obnoxious players a little harder to ignore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve gone through this type of depression before. But once I got DDD at<br/>\n&gt; level 18, I switched to all instruments for soloing and had an absolute<br/>\n&gt; blast. Also, for me, nothing gets me back into the game like shopping.<br/>\n&gt; Getting a new weapon or piece of armor always gets me going, and once you<br/>\n&gt; hit level 20, you can start hunting gargoyles on Spectre island in OOT<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; a partner. At level 23 you can start soloing them with your all instrument<br/>\n&gt; attack and earn enough money to seriously upgrade your weaps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well until Diablo II makes it to the shelves, &quot;See you around&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been waiting for this for a few years and will be shocked when<br/>\nBlizzard<br/>\n&gt; finally does release this. It&#39;s gotten to the point where I&#39;m pretty<br/>\n&gt; non-chalant about it. I was real excited for this to be released early<br/>\nlast<br/>\n&gt; year. Let&#39;s see if they do indeed release it as expected.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Windleaf, 28th level balladeer, Bertox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 18<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 1 Feb 2000 22:07:11 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Valharick@...\">Valharick@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Mask of Deception and Ultravision<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Im a half elf btw :) sorry forgot to mention that<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 19<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 02 Apr 1999 04:04:55 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwolf@...\">steelwolf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Mask of Deception and Ultravision<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you use Psalm of Warmth? A tank told me last week he hates when bards<br/>\n&gt; use this, because it kills Ultravision, whether it be the spell or the<br/>\n&gt; guise effect (he is a 50 warrior with a guise of the deceiver). I forgot<br/>\n&gt; to check this, and he wasn&#39;t 100% sure which song it was. He simply said<br/>\n&gt; &quot;the song that puts up the wimpy damage shield that&#39;s a cold resist<br/>\n&gt; buff&quot; ;P. I&#39;ve noted a large number of bards like to play this song for<br/>\n&gt; the damage shield in the L30s range.
