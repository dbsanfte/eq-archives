So are all caster buffs going to end when the caster logs off<br/>\nso they can&#39;t park an enchanter nearby just to clarity and log him on and<br/>\noff?  Plain and simple this is stupid.  It&#39;s another example of where<br/>\nprobably some bard was sitting AFK on the planes and now we all have to be<br/>\nnerfed because someone abused the situation.  Heaven forbid they should<br/>\nhandle this by putting in an auto logoff when someone is inactive for more<br/>\nthan 10 minutes like most games do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Tatsukawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:john@...\">john@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 1:22 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>; &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Change to bard song mechanics on Test!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsor has asked everyone to switch to a different thread on this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/003015.html\">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/003015.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have to agree with Lago on Verant&#39;s reasoning that this is to keep us <br/>\nfrom going AFK indefinitely.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:58 PM 10/31/00 -0700, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Of course this will make Aria and Clouding instant death songs in many<br/>\n&gt;situations.
