If you have an instrument <br/>\nequipped and pickup in your mouse pointer another instrument of the same <br/>\ntype (ie string, wind, brass,percussion) you will lose the instrument bonus. <br/>\n  if you pickup an instrument of the a different type (say Lute equipped, <br/>\nhorn on mouse pointer) you get the full instrument effect.  Having an <br/>\ninstrument in your inventory of the same type has no effect on the song you <br/>\nare playing (ie no fire beetle eye/lightstone effect).<br/>\n<br/>\nRokenn Swiftsong - Karana server<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Bard Song Analysis<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
