First time a friend I was grouped with hadn&#39;t<br/>\ngotten any sleep and ran the wrong way (towards the mobs<br/>\ninstead of away :), and the second and third times we had a<br/>\ntrain dumped on us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which, the Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD strategy works<br/>\npretty well grouped with another tank.  Just get the other<br/>\ntank to understand to distribute the damage and you should be<br/>\nfine.  I was grouped with a cleric last night and tried<br/>\nplaying a couple different ways before also settling on<br/>\nHymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD, albeit in a slightly different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I tried Verses and weapons.  We both ended up at half hp<br/>\nfighting a ghoul zol, with the cleric nearly OOM.  Scratch<br/>\nthat.  Next I tried Chain+Verses+CoC, but still had problems<br/>\ndoing enough damage to keep stuff off the cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I settled on Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD, but fighting several<br/>\nmobs simultaneously.  The cleric just kept me healed,<br/>\noccasionally stunning.  The first time I had to do this was<br/>\ndue to a train.  We had the water ele and a zol dumped on us<br/>\n(the rest passed us while we were invis).  We finished the ele<br/>\nand zol with the cleric at 40%, but we were fighting in the<br/>\nhalls and a mino joined in, followed shortly by the returning<br/>\ntrain (zol, 2 wans, urd, yun, and shin).  That&#39;s when we<br/>\nbailed (well, after we paused at the bottom of the ramp,<br/>\nfearing stuff while waiting for someone who&#39;d gone afk to get<br/>\nback).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards, we had a bit more control over the situation and<br/>\nwere able to fight pretty successfully.  Mino elder (green but<br/>\nfights like a blue) + mino (green) + 2 wans went down pretty<br/>\neasily.  2 zols was pretty easy too.  The highlight of the<br/>\nnight was when all the wandering mobs just decided to converge<br/>\nat where we were standing.  We killed a zol, 2 wans, 2 urds +<br/>\npets, and 2 minos simultaneously.  I only got exp for a zol<br/>\nand urd, but the cleric was 47 and got experience for most of<br/>\nthem.  It was starting to look bad and the cleric had just<br/>\ngiven me a LOM message, when things started dropping dead. :)<br/>\n2 players vs 7 low blue/high green mobs and we won.  Fun fun<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Chords of Dischord &lt;g&gt;.  It would be bad to have Inny die to the DoT bug and<br/>\n&gt; see his corpse poof.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s why I never use it on named mobs unless the only<br/>\nway to kill the mob is if I use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
