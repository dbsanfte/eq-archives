Admittedly, that<br/>\n&gt; was not the aim.  I was merely waiting for a GM to help me with a<br/>\n&gt; corpse lost due to a crash.  (If you&#39;re wondering, I maxed out my<br/>\n&gt; fishing skill, and I was level 9 at the time).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The gold from the fish gave me enough to buy a sewing kit, and I<br/>\n&gt; ventured out to get some ruined cat pelts to replace my armour.
