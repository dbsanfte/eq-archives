I have had two types of<br/>\ninvisibility spells cast on me.  One is the magic user type that just shows<br/>\n&quot;Invisibility&quot; when you right click on the icon.  The second one is the<br/>\n&quot;Invisibility to Undead&quot; that clerics and paladins can cast.  I was always<br/>\nunder the impression that our invisibility song functioned like the magic<br/>\nuser type Invisibility spell and as a result was no good against undead,<br/>\nwhich I assumed had the innate ability to See Invisiblility (otherwise why<br/>\nhave a distinct spell for it).<br/>\n<br/>\nThese leads into another question, John stated that sometimes the hag casts<br/>\nSee Invisibility on the mobs and thats why they still attack you when you<br/>\nsing the song.  What about other types of mobs?  Do any creatures out there<br/>\nhave the innate ability to See Invisibility or do they have to also cast the<br/>\nSee Invisibility spell?<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tJohn Kim [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tWednesday, August 25, 1999 1:51 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] End of Kiting?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Wed, 25 Aug 1999, Mike Roach wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Look at this nonsense I pulled of EQVault, of course people are pissed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant NEVER tells us when they nerf our abilities...I lost the invis vs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; undead affect of the clouding song and nobody told me until I nearly<br/>\n&gt; died<br/>\n&gt; &gt; finding out by mistake:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I visited Unrest last week and had no problems using Clouding<br/>\n&gt; to sneak past undead.  I explored a good portion of the<br/>\n&gt; basement using it, then I spent a good 3-4 hours pulling from<br/>\n&gt; the basement using the song to scout ahead before pulling. The<br/>\n&gt; song most definitely still works against undead - I would con<br/>\n&gt; them and they&#39;d be in different to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Like I said, sometimes the hags cast see invisible on<br/>\n&gt; themselves and other mobs.  Or if you end up with a buggy mob<br/>\n&gt; aggressive to you (which shouldn&#39;t happen anymore with the<br/>\n&gt; teleporting mob fix they put in), it and anything it alerts<br/>\n&gt; will remain aggressive to you even if you&#39;re invisible.<br/>\n&gt; Another possibility is that they changed the song so that the<br/>\n&gt; invisibility to undead effect does not kick in until you reach<br/>\n&gt; a higher level.  I&#39;ll have to as a bard friend that just got<br/>\n&gt; the song to test it for me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
