Go into a newbie zone and pick a <br/>\nfight with an orc pawn or a gnoll pup.  They cant hurt you because of your <br/>\nac and your hp rebuilds faster than they can damage you.  But you will be <br/>\npunching them for 1 point of damage.  Now you should be getting into groups <br/>\nwhere they are attacking monsters that are so much higher than you that your <br/>\nnormal weps are having trouble damaging them.  Your role in that case will <br/>\nbe equiping an instrument and playing songs. So magic gloves and hand to <br/>\nhand combat with monsters that you can barley hit with a Dirk or Combine are <br/>\nnot gonna do any good.  Even lower level monsters that your regular weps can <br/>\nhit will be hitting you and your party pretty hard.  If you are in the <br/>\nmelee, you will be at risk of getting stunned and not having your songs be <br/>\nused all of the time.  And you will get beat up for no gain.  My 2cp &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n     <br/>\nYou would be better off standing off outside of melee and supporting your <br/>\nparty 100% of the time (no stuns to interupt you).<br/>\n     <br/>\nSylly.<br/>\n     <br/>\np.s. I could be wrong - I have only had 2 or 3 partys and monster combos <br/>\nwhere I was able to do this stand off support role.  but I have done the h2h <br/>\ncombat thing and it was pitiful!<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n                -----Original Message-----<br/>\n                From:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a>]<br/>\n                Sent:   Monday, July 26, 1999 1:28 PM <br/>\n                To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n                Subject:        RE: [eqbards] Magical Gloves?<br/>\n     <br/>\n                From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RON_TALBOT@...\">RON_TALBOT@...</a><br/>\n     <br/>\n                     The other day someone offered me Black iron gloves.
