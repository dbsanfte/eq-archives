Because your song pulses<br/>\nevery six seconds chances are high a mob will run by and get a double dose<br/>\nsince it affects two people.  If the Pally hits his target while its nearby<br/>\nhe isn&#39;t likely to do that much more damage than the puller did when they<br/>\nagro&#39;d it originally.  With a group of six every pulse is six spells cast as<br/>\nfar as the mob is concerned.  Anybody else know a class that can agro a mob<br/>\nat the rate of a buff per second ad infinitum?  And they wonder why bard<br/>\nhate was disproportionate.  we discovered this by pulsing a song and seeing<br/>\nhow many shaman buff had to be cast to offset the pulse with the three of us<br/>\njust standing there and taking it.  The answer sadly was 6.  They had to<br/>\ndouble the number to get it to leave me.  If we were both in melee range it<br/>\nwould switch at 5.  It was ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 27, 2000 2:40 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] My overcrowding solutuion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 27 Jan 2000, Kimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was thinking of the KS&#39;ing crowd, though indirectly.  A druid or other<br/>\n&gt; tracker could just sit by while people wandered about killing stuff and<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; the single named mob showed up race to it and have a fair chance of<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; there first as the people who cleared the way for it have moved on to<br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; areas and are likely in a fight when the special spawns.  If there are<br/>\n&gt; twelve different specials it would make it that much harder for the<br/>\n&quot;tracker<br/>\n&gt; in the shadows&quot; to just rush over and nab the special when it popped up as<br/>\n&gt; likely several specials would be popping up at any given time if the place<br/>\n&gt; has a fair amount of explorers in it.  Since the container guy doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmove,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, having 12 different specials would make it 12x harder<br/>\n(assuming no change in rare spawn frequency) for a kill<br/>\nstealer to get the special item.  It also makes it 12x harder<br/>\nfor the group to get the special item.  They cancel out.  <br/>\nWell, maybe the group gets to see who the kill stealer(s) is<br/>\nbefore they lose the item.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, that was why I said maybe the named mob should just<br/>\ndrop on top of your while you are fighting.  It doesn&#39;t reward<br/>\nthe parasitic opportunists that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of mobs dropping on top of you...  My paladin friend<br/>\nwas soloing a bit in LGuk a couple nights ago.  He was<br/>\nfighting in the halls (dead side).  He&#39;d fight one mob, other<br/>\npeople&#39;s pulls would ignore him.  I joined him.  Other<br/>\npeople&#39;s pulls saw the bard singing a song, and decided they<br/>\nhated the bard more than the person pulling them.  Bleh.  I&#39;d<br/>\njust assumed all this time that mobs other people were pulling<br/>\nwould attack you if they saw you fighting another mob (the<br/>\n&quot;help a friend&quot; AI).  I didn&#39;t realize it only happened to<br/>\nbards.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
