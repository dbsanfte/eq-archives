Typically it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;about 2 entire twists (30 seconds or so) before I get mobbed.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 2)  We have far more AC than an enchanter<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3)  We have far more HP than an enchanter<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 4)  We have far more melee ability than an enchanter<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 5)  We have higher dodge skill than an enchanter<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 6)  We can cast while being hit (an enchanter cannot)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 7)  We can outrun anything that comes near us (outdoor) they cannot.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (technically we can indoors too if you use jig and jump the whole way)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;1)  I usually get jumped before we even have time to realize there<br/>\n&gt;are more, and react; sometimes I get as many as 3 pulses.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And i know bards that don&#39;t get mobbed at all. This seems to be entirely<br/>\nstyle/location dependent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2-5)  Exactly my point.  The poster stated that we had different ways to<br/>\n&gt;handle the mobs, outside of AC, and then used an Enchanter as an<br/>\n&gt;example.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No I stated that you said you needed AC because you were always getting<br/>\nhit, and that Verant obviously doesn&#39;t take that view. Because the Enchanter<br/>\ncan get mobbed just as badly, and has way less AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I was pointing out that the Enchanter has the tools necessary that mitigate<br/>\n&gt;the need for AC under these particular circumstances.  We have been able to<br/>\n&gt;wear steel class armor for this reason since at least release; the game<br/>\n&gt;mechanics have not changed in regards to the bard getting jumped in a<br/>\n&gt;multi-mob scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Enchanters and Bards BOTH have tools to mitigate the need for AC. Frankly,<br/>\nI&#39;m not asking that Enchanters be given more AC. That&#39;s one of the drawbacks<br/>\nof playing a pure caster. Just like it is a drawback of bards that, as you<br/>\ngo up in level, you become less and less able to really tank -- taking the<br/>\ndamage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;6) Rune.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To begin with, at least up to my level, we get enough Rune to absorb ONE<br/>\nblow from<br/>\nan enemy (perhaps two. Depending on its level relative to you) And if you&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to cast mez, you&#39;re certainly not going to waste time Rune&#39;ing<br/>\nyourself<br/>\nfirst.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, Rune doesn&#39;t stop stunning. And doens&#39;t allow you to cast while<br/>\nbeing<br/>\nhit (People keep saying &quot;Cast this on the cleric so they cast through while<br/>\nbeing<br/>\nmobbed. It doesn&#39;t work that way.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;7) At my level, the only time the enchanter can&#39;t outrun the<br/>\n&gt;outdoors mob is if there is no druid, ranger, or shaman in the group,<br/>\n&gt;or the mob can keep pace with SoW.  If they want it, it&#39;s rather easy<br/>\n&gt;for an enchanter at my level to have JBoots, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At my level, rangers don&#39;t have SoW, Shamans can be hard to find, and I<br/>\nreally do get into groups<br/>\nwithout druids sometime. And bard song is a LOT faster than SoW to begin<br/>\nwith.<br/>\nEven at lower levels you can tell this difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n(However, for the most part, if someone is beating on me, I stand and hope<br/>\nfor a<br/>\nheal/die. Running is not that effective unless the group has called for a<br/>\n&quot;Flee&quot;<br/>\nand running just makes the job of the tanks/clerics more difficult in<br/>\ngetting them off of you. I will back off a couple of paces after something<br/>\ntauntish has been done. To see if its still on me. But I don&#39;t try<br/>\noutrunning.<br/>\nIts not effective enough often enough. And can easily get other stuff on<br/>\nya.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
