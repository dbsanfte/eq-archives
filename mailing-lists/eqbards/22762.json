My finger wiggling guild brother Rhube was fighting in the caves there last night and told me about the claws.  He&#39;s pretty sure I&#39;d like them too.  He said the bear pelts they were getting actually had stats on the pelts when you looted them.

Might have to go there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMe and some guild brothers found a nice spot in the Great Divide.  Actually<br/>\na few nice spots, but this one we stayed at the most.  There are some caves<br/>\nwith bears in them at about neg 6000, pos 2400ish if I remember the loc<br/>\ncorrectly.  There are a few cave openings for multiple camp spots.  A little<br/>\nways up the mountain from the caves is the Labrynth Dungeon.  Outside the<br/>\ncaves are wurms of various types.  Lots of mobs.  Got a Velium Spear off a<br/>\nwurm and got claws off the bears, not much if any coin.  There are two named<br/>\nbears:  Icetooth and Bloodmaw.  I heard via ooc that Bloodmaw is a major<br/>\nmiscon and he was tough to the groups attacking, but no personal experience,<br/>\nso beware.  Icetooth we did see and kill.  He was white and then blue to me<br/>\nat 38.  We had broken the cave and were keeping the spawn under control<br/>\nwithout problem.  If we got two, shaman rooted or I charmed or we used druid<br/>\nharmony pull - not a problem.  If had a lull in our room, we simply walked<br/>\nback out a little and pulled one in.  But back to Icetooth - he dropped a<br/>\nbetter claw 11 damage, 29 delay, Magic lore, primary only.  I like it a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral impression:  I really like it a lot and am having fun.  Just not<br/>\ngetting enough sleep this week.

The necklace<br/>\ncan also drop off the oracle or mystic.  The centurions can only drop the<br/>\nearrings.<br/>\nThe Oracle also drops the Ry`gorr armor.  At least the boots, bracer,<br/>\nsleeves,<br/>\ncoif and collar (that&#39;s what<br/>\nwe&#39;ve seen so far at least)..   It looks VERY VERY cool on a bard.
