I started getting <br/>\nrepeatedly spammed about &quot;Quelin tries to cast a spell on you, but you are <br/>\nprotected&quot; every time her song pulsed. A groupmate asked what song I was <br/>\nsinging as he was getting spammed by me. Turns out the other bard had <br/>\njumped into the pond to swim and since we weren&#39;t in the water our songs <br/>\nweren&#39;t sticking. But I don&#39;t think this had anything to do with the patch, <br/>\njust the way spells work with water.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:22 PM 5/31/01 -0400, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.stone@...\">mike.stone@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;How was the patch?
