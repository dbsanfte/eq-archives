Could not<br/>\nafford it but I had the speed to go take a look and see what I needed.<br/>\nAlso by 8 I had been back and forth a few times. I always bought every song<br/>\nabout as soon as I could.  What is the point of being a bard if you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave all of your songs?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first good sword was a short sword I bought off Olyvia Bladefinder (sp?)<br/>\nin the cottage in West Karana. I think it was 4pp? That served me well and I<br/>\nstill have it in my bank.  Before that and even after, I used a giant snake<br/>\nfang that I got in Blackburrow Paw from a giant snake who died a brave and<br/>\nhonorable death. Also, I managed to save the 3 or 4pp for the Mino Axe and<br/>\nkept the best 1HB wep from my kills (BB gnolls prolly).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe lament song will be a good one for in about 2 more levels and then up.<br/>\nIt will help your groups pull singles from orc and derv camps - instead of<br/>\npulling the whole camp.  Well, most of the time it will!  Lament the lowest<br/>\ncons and pull the higher ones.  Be ready to run becuz sometimes they will<br/>\nall come!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt your age you can be hunting the first and mid parts of BlackBurrow Paw.<br/>\nIf you have a good group, you should take them to Split Paw - a bit better<br/>\nloot and less competition - just a bit further away and you don&#39;t want to<br/>\ndie there cuz of the long run.  By 15 to 18 - you should be cleaning Split<br/>\nPaw out for Snake Skin armors.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\nBard of the 34th song<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tWebber, Jessica [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WebberJ@...\">WebberJ@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, October 27, 1999 9:15 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n\t\tSubject:\t[eqbards] Newbie questions<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WebberJ@...\">WebberJ@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;m a flat broke minstrel of the 8th verse bound to Qeynos<br/>\nand I&#39;m wondering<br/>\n\t\tif it&#39;s worth my while to try to earn enough PP and make<br/>\ntrek back to<br/>\n\t\tKelethin to purchase Kelin&#39;s Lament.
