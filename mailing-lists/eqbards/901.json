Ever since I got bellow, I can only think of a<br/>\nhandful of times it&#39;s been resisted by a yellow.  A lot of<br/>\ntimes I can use it on reds as well, though high reds (stuff<br/>\nthat singlehandedly nearly wipes out my party) usually resist<br/>\nit, but I still get a fair number in.  Interestingly, those I<br/>\ndo get in are often near the low end of the damage range,<br/>\nwhich supports the guy&#39;s claim that resist and damage are<br/>\nlinked.  Last night I was flabbergasted because a green wisp<br/>\nresisted bellow three times.  That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve had a<br/>\ngreen resist it, and suspect Verant cranked up their magic<br/>\nresist to make it harder to farm them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the other way to test is to go fight a skunk and get<br/>\nthat nasty -30 chr, and try things then.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; resistance or &quot;fizzling&quot; a problem with some of you?

When you first get a new skill, you will<br/>\nmiss notes a lot.  I *think* dex is tied into how well you can<br/>\nhold a song when you&#39;re hit.  I have to restart my song every<br/>\n3-4 hits fighting blue-yellow mobs (stuns excepted) at 90 dex.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
