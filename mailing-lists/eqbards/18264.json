Bellow is doubly bad therefore... as is melee.  As has been <br/>\nmentioned, some DoTs also have DD components, and these risk breaking the <br/>\nroot.  Basic DoTs like ours do not break root... but do remember root has a <br/>\nchance of failing every tick, based on the magic resist of the target.  <br/>\nSometimes it will just break early.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been working with rooters and using DoTs for 30 levels now.  Back when <br/>\nI was around 20th level I&#39;d have my enchanter friend root one or two <br/>\nmonsters and I&#39;d do DDD/CoD, arranging myself so I&#39;d reach all the targets <br/>\nwith my songs while remaining out of melee range.  These days I use the <br/>\nChants, and I&#39;ve never observed any correlation between my DoTs and <br/>\ndecreased duration of roots.<br/>\n<br/>\nAloro Silvertongue (E&#39;ci)<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
