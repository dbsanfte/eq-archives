Its possible, but<br/>\n&gt; unlikely.  The problem with ADM didn&#39;t involve its playing time, it stills<br/>\n&gt; plays like it did before, it just actually does something now while its<br/>\n&gt; playing.  And yes, if I changed a subroutine I knew was used by other<br/>\n&gt; processes I sure as hell would make sure what I did didn&#39;t break those<br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; processes.  If I didn&#39;t I would soon be looking for a new job.  In fact,<br/>\nnow<br/>\n&gt; that I think of it, that is my new job.  I spend 80% of my time making<br/>\nsure<br/>\n&gt; that exactly that sort of thing does not occur.  Something Verant<br/>\nobviously<br/>\n&gt; cannot be bothered to do.  Come on remember those three DoT&#39;s that when<br/>\n&gt; implemented would only work if you cast them on yourself, their testing<br/>\n&gt; record speaks for itself and it is mute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi<br/>\n&gt; Quality Analyst in RL<br/>\n&gt; (I keep the rest of the programmers honest, or at least awake)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Katy Westerman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I can see why it slipped by.  They were changing ADM, and<br/>\n&gt; whoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>\n&gt; coded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>\n&gt; it.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>\n&gt; *every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>\n&gt; the patch would be rather long in getting out.
