The Kithicor <br/>\n&gt; and Lake Rathe<br/>\n&gt; events are probably testing grounds for some kind of changes <br/>\n&gt; to the zones.<br/>\n&gt; Verant has so few people on the Test Server that they have to <br/>\n&gt; do things on<br/>\n&gt; live servers to see how things will actually work.  Trust me <br/>\n&gt; Verant has 1.5<br/>\n&gt; million reasons per month to want you to be happy.  With the <br/>\n&gt; retail release<br/>\n&gt; of Asheron&#39;s Call yesterday I think Verant is going to be <br/>\n&gt; very aggressive in<br/>\n&gt; retaining and growing their current player base.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; envy them having<br/>\n&gt; to compete against Microsoft.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Side note: everyone in the zone was saying &quot;I hope hope <br/>\n&gt; leave it this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake rathe when the pets were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spawning like crazy and everypne was saying &quot;I hope it <br/>\n&gt; stays this way&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH of which Verant <br/>\n&gt; KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Makes you wonder if they really WANT us happy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Uldar Ulfangson<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 25th bard, Rodcet Nife<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
