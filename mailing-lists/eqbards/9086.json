I&#39;ve not only had them do this, but they became so<br/>\nlocked on that they never switched off me until they died despite being<br/>\nsmacked, shot, burned, frozen, bent, folded, stapled, and mutilated by the<br/>\ngroup they were originally fighting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is bard hate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo other class has to endure this, or the the fact that merely casting<br/>\n(singing) in the general vicinity of a fight may get you a faction hit<br/>\nwhether you want it or not.  Neither my Druid, nor my Paladin, nor my<br/>\nEnchanter, nor my Shaman has EVER had a MOB leave its fight or ignore those<br/>\ndoing damage to it in favor of targetting them.  Especially not while I was<br/>\nstanding around not involved in their fight.  Occassionally I might get hit<br/>\nwith a spell from a MOB in another fight, but they would immediately return<br/>\nto their combat.  NEVER, NEVER did they turn their backs on their attackers<br/>\nand run over to beat on me without provocation EXCEPT when playing my bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis too is bard hate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wayne Sheppard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrwayne@...\">mrwayne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    From: Talies the Wanderer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Re: Re: BARD HATE<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But what explains this?<br/>\n&gt; Sitting in Crushbone, not singing, not fighting, just watching, &quot;An orc<br/>\n&gt; oracle begins to cast a spell.

Out<br/>\nof nowhere, the mob (forget what it was) cast a spell on me then continued<br/>\nto fight the other party.  My group or I had did nothing to draw the mob.<br/>\nWas this Bard Hate too?  NO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before, mobs have some randomness in who they attack.  Every<br/>\nclass will experience this.  I don&#39;t think Bards are more heavily weighted<br/>\nthan all other class.  Unfortunately Bards also draw mobs with their songs<br/>\nthat pulse every 6 seconds.  So they get both the random mobs and the<br/>\nsong-drawn mobs.  This is why it seems so much worse for Bards than any<br/>\nother characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
