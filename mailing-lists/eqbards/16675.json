Kinda sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to suggest/comment on new bard songs; a lot of the ideas <br/>\nhere are good, and I have a hard time deciding what to suggest given that <br/>\nnone of us has any idea what kind of MOBs a level 51-60 Bard might be <br/>\nfacing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that you say the following in your letter:<br/>\n1)  Given our small melee-based skill set, our lack of crits, etc., our <br/>\nbad defense, our relatively under-powered high level armor (in AC), our <br/>\nlow hit points, and our lack of pets, our melee component is roughly 1/5 <br/>\nthe melee of a pure melee class.  That means that our casting should be <br/>\nabout 80% as good as a pure caster.  In some circumstances, it should be <br/>\nclearly better.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  They seem to believe that our songs should be underpowered <br/>\nbecause 1) we do not use mana, and 2) we can sing party-wide songs.  This <br/>\ndoes not compensate for the very short duration of our song effects, nor <br/>\nthe fact that we can keep at most three effects going at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were asked to list the things we&#39;d like to see them &quot;fix&quot;.  They <br/>\nshould be referred to the Bard Petition on the Gameplay board, and to the <br/>\nLullaby thread.  My list:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Lullaby.  When a level 43 Enchanter can mez 17 kobolds, with a less <br/>\nthan 10% resist rate, and a level 45 bard gets resist rates of 70% <br/>\nagainst the same, this song stinks.  It doesn&#39;t do what they say it <br/>\nshould do; even if it did, it should be better than that.  If they don&#39;t <br/>\nwant us to stop gigantic trains, they should shrink the AE radius of the <br/>\nsong, not make it useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Pixie Strike appears (to me) to have the same resist problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Numerous songs are instrument-based, but instruments appear to have <br/>\nno effect on the song at all.  Lullaby and Psalms in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  Our songs don&#39;t scale up in proportion to either PC or NPC <br/>\nHPs/damage dealing.  They should.<br/>\n<br/>\n5)  Is there a reason that the Psalms don&#39;t stack with each other?  This <br/>\nmakes them so over-specialized as to be useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n6)  For multiple effect songs:  if they are going to cut the power of <br/>\neach component in half (so it doesn&#39;t take away from the parent class&#39;s <br/>\nabilities), and then cut it by N (where N is the number of component <br/>\neffects), the MOBs should NOT get full resists against each component, <br/>\nany one of which causes the whole song to fail.  Either a component <br/>\nshould work if the specific resist is failed against that component, or <br/>\nMOBs should get a single &quot;average&quot; resist check.  Multiple component <br/>\nanti-MOB songs are pretty worthless now.<br/>\n<br/>\n7)  If a party-based song has multiple components, they need to keep in <br/>\nmind:  1) not every party member benefits, 2) if our songs have stacking <br/>\nconflicts with a lot of different spell/buff effects, the songs have to <br/>\nbe pretty strong to make them useful, 3) we can only keep up three song <br/>\neffects at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my take on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKenross Cantoforjado, 46 songs, Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
