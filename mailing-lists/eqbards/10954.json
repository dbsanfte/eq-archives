He then got himself killed and subsequently lost connection <br/>\nfor 24 hours due to a power outage.

And yes I had that pang of jealousy<br/>\n&gt;that we all succumb to, but really what are you in the game for?  If it<br/>\n&gt;were not for the good friends that I have made I would have left this game<br/>\n&gt;a long time ago.  I bet you remember how wild some of your adventures were<br/>\n&gt;and not the 3 hour camp that you did to get a &lt;insert item name here&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for making items no drop, it would appease my jealous streak, but it<br/>\n&gt;will also quell my good nature towards my friend.  As a present to my<br/>\n&gt;friend who working on a new cleric, I camped 6 hours straight to get her a<br/>\n&gt;set of barbed arms.  The camp was horrible, but I did love the thanks I<br/>\n&gt;received from her... If items don&#39;t stroke my ego, then let my friends do<br/>\n&gt;it for me.  In all truth I really wish some of the other quests were not<br/>\n&gt;no drop so I could give gifts to my friends for their kindness and<br/>\n&gt;understanding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt;Bard of Kelethin<br/>\n&gt;Honour Guard, Karana<br/>\n&gt;Happily engaged to the dubbed &quot;Queen of Death&quot;. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
