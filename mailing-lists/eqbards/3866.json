Well, when i recieved the sneak skill two<br/>\nlvls ago, i put 3 points into it hoping to try it out...nothing.  The<br/>\nhide skill is not allowing me to use it.  So i thought maybe if i put<br/>\nsome more points into the sneak skill it would cycle the button through<br/>\nfaster.  It didn&#39;t.  So far i have put 8 skill points into sneak and<br/>\nhave not been able to use it once.  Is this normal?  or do you all think<br/>\nthat maybe mine is screwed up?<br/>\n<br/>\nTadian of Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
