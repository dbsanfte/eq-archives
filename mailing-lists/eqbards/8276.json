I&#39;m certain that with either my charm or my cash,<br/>\nsomeone will let me loot the Guise.  My main concern though is not getting<br/>\nkilled while I&#39;m down there.  Any suggestions on how a 24 bard can pull this<br/>\noff?  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Step number one, if you get down there and a group is camping the mob that<br/>\n&gt; drops the guise<br/>\n&gt; (Assassin? I don&#39;t remember) is to just ask if they would mind if you<br/>\n&gt; looted it.  Be creative,<br/>\n&gt; offer to sing them a song or something in exchange for it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chances are, they&#39;re nice people who all have masks anyway and just want<br/>\n&gt; to pull Serrated Bone<br/>\n&gt; Dirks and they&#39;ll happily let you loot the mask if you entertain them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If they&#39;re jerks about it, then offer to pay.  If it was my group though,<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;d happily let you<br/>\n&gt; loot it for free.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
