Which is +3 from a<br/>\nnormal lute. 3/18 is about 16.666...%. So the lute increases stringed songs effects by roughly +16 - +17%.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; So standing level 50s will get 19 back while hymm is playing.<br/>\n&gt; Sitting level 50s will get 21 back while hymm is playing. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
