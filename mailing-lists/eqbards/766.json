I&#39;ve never had a bad experience in either, but the former is <br/>\ndefinitely as safe as you can get if you&#39;re careful. There&#39;s very little <br/>\nchance of getting trained or something spawning right where you&#39;re <br/>\nstanding. Just remember, in the gorge go CRAZY high up on the wall. You&#39;ll <br/>\nbe fine, trust me. Be anal about it, take 20 minutes to do it if you <br/>\nwish... unless you have extreme bad luck or make an awful mistake you&#39;ll be <br/>\nalright.<br/>\nJust my opinion. It&#39;s not the fastest or the most convenient way but it&#39;s <br/>\nthe safest as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally used Lament to escape certain death, very fun ;) I was basically <br/>\ncrawling as a beastie whacked on me. Managed to keep it from getting close <br/>\ncuz I lamented it every time it did. Must&#39;ve looked odd to the crowd of <br/>\nbemused onlookers. But while I was fumbling in my inventory to equip my <br/>\ndrum I accidentally dropped a backpack I was carrying full of juicy loot. I <br/>\nwent back for it, like the fiend that I am - with about 15 hp&#39;s or so (this <br/>\nis AFTER I had zoned), but didn&#39;t find it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I pulled a MASSIVE PSYCHO TRAAAAAAIN on everyone there out of spite!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust kidding ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tA.Rubman [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tSaturday, May 15, 1999 2:53 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eqbards] Bardic Travel Question<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;A.Rubman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Naturdoc@...\">Naturdoc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep hearing two opposing statements about travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;m fast, I can outrun a griffin (sometimes), but then I hear if<br/>\nI want to go to Qeynos there are two options.
