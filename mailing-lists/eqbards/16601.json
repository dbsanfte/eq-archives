The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-613810559\">This would fall under the category of a crowd control song and function very<br/>\nsimilar to Lullaby.  Everyone knows all the problems associated with<br/>\nLullaby.  The only difference between this song and Lullaby is that the mobs<br/>\nwould follow you around while with Lullaby they just stand there (if you get<br/>\nit to stick).  Now if this song made it where the mobs didn&#39;t attack the<br/>\nbard when he stopped playing it then it has some merit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong similar lines:  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ultimate crowd control song would be one that is a combination of<br/>\nLullaby, the Charismatic carillon, with a mem blur component added in just<br/>\nfor shits and grins.  This song would be the ultimate train derailer.  Group<br/>\ngets in trouble, bards fires up this song, mobs stop attacking, mem blur<br/>\nkicks in to erase hate list, carillon kicks in to make the bard non-KOS to<br/>\nthe mobs (would require an improved version of Carillon).  While the song is<br/>\nplaying, the rest of the party can move to a safe location.  Bard quits<br/>\nplaying and safely walks away.  Effects of song go away if mob gets attacked<br/>\nby anyone, party or non-party.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea for a high level song is a straight up improved version of<br/>\nCarillon that makes the bard non-KOS to everything in the zone (raises you<br/>\nat a minimum to Indifferent against everything except undead).  This would<br/>\nmean that bards could pretty much go anywhere in the game with relative<br/>\nsafety.  All they would have to do is tweak the code for Carillon and this<br/>\nsong would be ready for release.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin (playing AC now but still keeping up to date on all the bard issues)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: A.
