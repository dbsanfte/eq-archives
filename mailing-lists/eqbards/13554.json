I was in Rathe hunting giants when I got the message that two spots were opening up, and could we please","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1357437103\">A couple guildmates were in a full group at the lord.  I was<br/>\nin Rathe hunting giants when I got the message that two spots<br/>\nwere opening up, and could we please hurry since they couldn&#39;t<br/>\nhold the room with just 4 people.  So I zoned to Feerott,<br/>\nwas booted to the server selection screen, zoned to Innothule,<br/>\nwas booted to the login screen, you&#39;re all probably familiar<br/>\nwith this by now...<br/>\n<br/>\nA guild ranger who was already in Guk took the 5th spot.  I<br/>\ngot there and joined just as a patrolling dar spawned on top<br/>\nof us.  That gave us a L45 paladin, L45 cleric, L42<br/>\nshadowknight, L42 ranger, L44 bard (me), and another bard that<br/>\nwas anon and blue to me.  Not a very strong group for the lord<br/>\nroom, but you take what you can get.  Immediately after we<br/>\nkilled the dar, the lord spawned with a sword.  The other bard<br/>\nand I hadn&#39;t had time to coordinate our songs, heck I didn&#39;t<br/>\neven have any buffs on me.  I guess someone got excited and<br/>\npulled the lord, and we were committed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ghoul lord slashes you for 135 damage.<br/>\nThe ghoul lord hits you for 105 damage.<br/>\nYou have been struck by the force of Ykesha. (75 points)<br/>\n(and yes, that&#39;s one combat round)<br/>\n<br/>\nOuch ouch ouch ouch ouch...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleric went OOM, everyone finished at 1-3 bubbles, and the<br/>\nSK had to use his harm touch at the end to get the lord to<br/>\nstop beating on us and start running.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won the lotto for the sword.  At 10 minutes, it&#39;s the<br/>\nquickest rare item camp I&#39;ve ever done.  It just beat out my<br/>\nWakizashi camp. :)  That one took about 15 minutes - cleared<br/>\nour way to the maid room, killed the maid that was already<br/>\nspawned, and I won the lotto for the fang which I combined<br/>\nwith a butler fang the guild got the previous night. (And yes,<br/>\nI stuck around afterwards to help others get stuff.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sword takes a lot of stamina.  Nowhere near as bad as with<br/>\nmy old barbed whip, but enough that I&#39;m almost out of stamina<br/>\nat the end of a long fight.  The proc is nice.  First fight<br/>\nafter getting the sword, it proced 6 times.  :)  Later when we<br/>\nhad two guild groups there, I noticed when it proced a lot, my<br/>\ngroup would get the kill; when it didn&#39;t proc much, the other<br/>\ngroup would get the kill.  Spiffy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Rokenn for helping us hold the room throughout the<br/>\nnight (got two more Yaks which went to guild rangers to stop<br/>\nthem from using their train-causing ebonys), and thanks to<br/>\nAriell for giving me her old Mistmoore drum to replace the one<br/>\nI dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
