My exgirlfriend has a highelf enchanter and we<br/>\ntested that rumor out. I had her meditate for 15 mins to make sure she had a<br/>\ntotal bar of mana. had her cast chaotic feedback a major DD spell on her<br/>\nself till she was out of mana. then i we timed how long it took her to<br/>\nmeditate. it took about 5 mins for her to get a full mana bar back at lvl 18<br/>\nwith her wearing 0 int and mana giving items. we did it again and this time<br/>\ni sang the Jig and timed it once again this time it took about 4 mins<br/>\n13seconds to get the mana bar back up. so it does help slightly. My theory<br/>\nis the reason why it helps slightly is because when you are sing the Jig you<br/>\ndont consume food or drink. so perhaps the programming has taken the time it<br/>\nwould take for it to do checks on wheather you ear and drink or not and<br/>\napplied that to the meditating process. Frankly whether it helps or not. I<br/>\nsing it anyways during spell caster down times. It is the song i use with<br/>\nmost of my Bad Poems has almost become a tradition in my guild that when i<br/>\nam singing that song i am telling a bad joke or poem.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaerian Valmont of Povar<br/>\nJester to Erollis Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Chris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cjeffrey@...\">cjeffrey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrisj@...\">chrisj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 21, 1999 7:06 AM<br/>\nSubject: Fw: [eqbards] Re: songs question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Daniel P.

Neither<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;twisted&quot; at all - they just each kept one song going the whole time.<br/>\nOne<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing Hymn the other doing Jig.  I don&#39;t think they even bellowed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I got into a major argument with one of the bards about the Jig thing.<br/>\nIt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was funny that laughed off &quot;the old rumor that Jig DOESN&#39;T increase mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recovery&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The interesting thing about it - one of my best bud&#39;s and guildmates - a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleric - felt that it WAS helping him.  This is a VERY knowledgeable<br/>\n&gt; player.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I explained to him the &quot;apparent speed&quot; issue - and he still felt it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; increased mana recovery.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The thing to keep in mind about my bud - he lives in a remote part of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wisconsin - has TERRIBLE connectivity - goes linkdead constantly.  He<br/>\n&gt; ALWAYS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has bad PL/ping.  So I suspect that in the case of these people bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; connectivity - the jig song actually may help.   Jig may essentially<br/>\nforce<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more frequent server updates.  For those of us lucky enough to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; broadband access - or clean dialups - more frequent server updates makes<br/>\n&gt; no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difference - so we KNOW jig doesn&#39;t help.  But perhaps for the others -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; perhaps it negates the lag caused by the bad connectivity?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just one bard&#39;s theory here..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Slyde<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brett@...\">Brett@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, November 20, 1999 9:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] Re: songs question<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Jason Rochelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jasroc@...\">Jasroc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On a different topic, I grouped in HHK last week and there was already<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bard in the party, using weapons. I had to ask her 3 times what she<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; singing (so I could sing other songs so as to not conflict) and she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finally said &quot;well, mostly bellow, and chains if they run&quot;. Then after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; each combat, while the party members were injured, she would sing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor&quot; so that the cleric could get mana back faster<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; heal. I sent her a private tell explaining jig doesn&#39;t aid mana<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recovery, and she informed me that she KNEW it did, because a level 32<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wiz told her it did. I suggested she try to test it sometime, she said<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the wiz&#39;s word was good enough for her. How frustrating! I refuse to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; play Jig for anyone, no matter how many people tell me it helps. I ran<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test myself, and came up with ZERO increase in recovery, so I feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confident when I say to the casters &quot;Jig does not aid mana recovery&quot;<br/>\n(I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should make a hotkey for that :).
