If you give people time to engage with the story outside of the<br/>\ngame it really raises their involvement in whatever /does/ happen. It&#39;s<br/>\neasier to suspend disbelief, even in the face of idiot vandals, if you have<br/>\nbeen thinking about the story all day.  If you give people a larger (and<br/>\nplausible) meaning to their actions outside of the standard game mechanics<br/>\nvery little has to &quot;go right&quot; in order for everyone to have fun.<br/>\nFraming is everything.  The in-game actions can even be as minimal as<br/>\nstraight ahead, no frills combat and if you have framed it right people will<br/>\nfeel as if they have been part of something epic. Which they have, because<br/>\nyou said so, and you are the &quot;author&quot;, the trick is to make it believable.<br/>\nOn Rallos Zek, incursions into the Nektulos by Pale Skins were common, but<br/>\none day a 3rd level Paladin showed up who gave all of us a real /reason/ to<br/>\nhunt him, he knew how to frame his actions and it made absolutely anything<br/>\nhappened after that seem, well, important. Heck, before Verant killed Dark<br/>\nUnity with faction hits, it was really vibrant, with people really getting<br/>\ntheir emotions tied up with what was essentially a concept completely<br/>\ndecoupled from game mechanics (then they coupled it, wrongly, and killed<br/>\nD.U.)<br/>\nAnyway, enough *laughs* yeah, if anyone wonders I have credentials to back<br/>\nup my views, buuuuut, it looks like this career thingy of mine has put an<br/>\nend to those days. I hope Verant figures it out, there is a lot you could do<br/>\nin Norrath.<br/>\n<br/>\nTszaaz/Tengu</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
