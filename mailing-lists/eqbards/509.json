On Faydwer, size small ringmail is VERY<br/>\ncommon, since it loads in Unrest on fairly low level monsters.  You can buy<br/>\nringmail for 4-10 plat a piece easily in BB and Unrest.  Banded will usually cost<br/>\nyou more, depending on the piece.  Banded is better though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJyzan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
