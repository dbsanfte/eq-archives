I got into an argument about this with some guy once -<br/>\nhe thought it was ok that a L49 pet could kill a L50 melee<br/>\nplayer in a straight one-on-one fight.  His reasoning was that<br/>\nduels were a special case.  Pets are balanced because they&#39;re<br/>\ndumb, so in a real fight you would always prefer a real tank<br/>\nto a pet.  I told him if his reasoning was that intelligent<br/>\nplayer + dumb pet was an acceptable combo, then they should<br/>\nallow the melee classes to be able to summon caster pets.  <br/>\nNever got a reply to that one...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve long since given up on petitioning to Verant for any<br/>\nsort of class balance.  It&#39;s obvious they&#39;re heavily biased<br/>\ntowards casting classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
