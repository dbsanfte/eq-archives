If upgrading to ME will help me twist songs better, I&#39;ll do it in a heartbeat.<br/>\nTyunes Statevarius<br/>\nBard of the 45th missed note<br/>\n  Stephen McCloskey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s.mccloskey@...\">s.mccloskey@...</a>&gt; wrote: I just recently upgraded because of the same problem, frame rate.

Right now I feel the TNT card is<br/>\nholding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming out later in<br/>\nthe year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.
