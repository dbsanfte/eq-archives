If your primary goal<br/>\nas a bard is to do damage in the group, you&#39;re missing out on well over half<br/>\nof what the class can do that&#39;s more effective than adding more damage.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t sing dots in a group, I&#39;ll leave the serious damage dealing to the<br/>\ntanks and casters.
