I have <br/>\nben camping out in Befallen&#39;s basement alot lately with my guildmates, <br/>\nmostly big Barb warriors who covet the BBC&#39;s and we get rooted all the time. <br/>\nI have tried it each time and it seems to unstick you or your group members <br/>\nbefore you get that pesky&#39;you can&#39;t do that in here&#39; message. It is hard to <br/>\ntell in the heat of a battle but now they will say ROOTED and when I hit <br/>\nselos we can move again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to jig and being a mini-mana bard, we found this in beta and I am the <br/>\ndarling of the casters my level for it once they figure it out.<br/>\nFor hotbuttons, definitely add assist. You need to get used to the whole <br/>\ngroup concentrating on one mob at a time and assist is the best way. <br/>\nEssential for higherlevel dungeon hunting IMHO. I quit trying sense heading <br/>\nsince it always let me down when I had to know what direction NOW. For 3 pp <br/>\nyou can buy a compass and put it in your inventory hotkey. It never fails. <br/>\n;)<br/>\nHere&#39;s hoping my bard has been restored on Xegony.<br/>\nBrilinnia, currently ghost bard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
