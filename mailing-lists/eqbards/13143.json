The other day I was camping the top of<br/>\n  the temple and Archon with a L30 group (on my L30 character) and we&#39;d<br/>\n  kill the spawns on the steps, mostly in melee, then when our puller<br/>\n  would pull from lower in the temple, we found the lizards would get<br/>\n  stuck on the corner by the stairs down. We found it annoying, but we&#39;d<br/>\n  simply have 3-4 of us go to that corner and kill the lizard then run<br/>\n  back. We did this for a few hours and made great exp.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A guide messaged our group leader and said &quot;thank you for not exploiting<br/>\n  the faulty pathing in this area of the dungeon&quot;. It was actually kind of<br/>\n  nice to have it mentioned, since we were a bit irritated at having to<br/>\n  meet our pulls half-way. I know the temple&#39;s pathing has been bugged for<br/>\n  ages, I guess I just wasn&#39;t aware anyone actually exploited it. Exploits<br/>\n  don&#39;t seem like a very fun way to gain exp to me. I&#39;m not sure if<br/>\n  someone petitioned us in the hopes of moving our group from the spot<br/>\n  (seems unlikely, it was quite late and we had no visitors the entire<br/>\n  time) or they have a check, but it very well could be.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ariell Thudnerwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kyle Sibbald wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; From: &quot;Kyle Sibbald&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ksibbald@...\">ksibbald@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;       I have heard that the GM&#39;s have somehow placed a monitor on the<br/>\n  &gt; top of the<br/>\n  &gt; temple.
