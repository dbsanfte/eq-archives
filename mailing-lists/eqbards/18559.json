He &quot;cheated&quot; to get<br/>\nit.  Not cheated as in broke any rules but definitely cheated the system to<br/>\nget ahead of it.  I refuse to congratulate, hold in awe, or respect someone<br/>\nthat finds pleasure in cheating the system.  And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t have a RL friend or roomate that helped him keep the character at<br/>\nit for longer than normal periods of time.  Just because other people<br/>\nweren&#39;t logging into the account doesn&#39;t mean that other people weren&#39;t<br/>\nplaying it ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad he&#39;s 60.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope he enjoys being there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut... I don&#39;t find it all that surprising.  Nor do I find it something to<br/>\nbe proud of or to respect someone for.  Heh, everyone knows that FoH are a<br/>\npack of powergamers (very very GOOD powergamers).
