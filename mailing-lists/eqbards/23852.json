For instance, if you<br/>\nreally, really want a particular class for a specific function (e.g. manna<br/>\nbattery, evacer, puller) & the only character available is on a player&#39;s<br/>\nother PC, it might just be worth it to the group to have a bard who only<br/>\nsings the manna song, or a wizard who sits around waiting for things to get<br/>\ndicey, or a monk who pulls, feigns, and doesn&#39;t get up again until it&#39;s<br/>\ntime to make another pull. &lt;/shrug&gt;  Any class played that way is a waste<br/>\nof the class, but still, maybe the group really, really, wants that<br/>\nspecific need filled.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nEvulia of Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                                           <br/>\n                   Christopher Sanders                                                     <br/>\n                   &lt;christopher.sanders@exp        To:     &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;&quot;     <br/>\n                   erian.com&gt;                      &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;               <br/>\n                                                   cc:                                     <br/>\n                   02/14/01 09:49 AM               Subject:     RE: [eqbards] Answers to   <br/>\n                   Please respond to               Questions on Loot Rights                <br/>\n                   eqbards                                                                 <br/>\n                                                                                           <br/>\n                                                                                           <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe...the loot fairy is welcome to visit me while I&#39;m away.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only question is, how can a person play more than one character at a<br/>\ntime<br/>\neffectively?  Yesterday in Dalnir, I was doing CC (heh...it&#39;s weird being<br/>\nhigh enough level to say this) for my group, and it was more than enough to<br/>\nkeep me busy.  There is no way I could have played, say, a warrior at the<br/>\nsame time, at least not effectively, much less a class that takes more<br/>\nsituational awareness, like a chanter or cleric (or a bard.  :)  ).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be hesitant to be in a group where the same person was trying to be<br/>\n2 classes in the same group/raid.  Especially in high risk, multiple mob<br/>\ndungeons, where not even Selos has a chance to save my hide.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like things have worked out, though.  That&#39;s always a good thing.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\nNearly 30 after a few days in Dalnir!  Woo!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rebecca Small [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsmall@...\">rsmall@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 14, 2001 9:07 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Answers to Questions on Loot Rights<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer some questions:<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;I&#39;m a little confused by a couple things.  Were all people in both<br/>\ngroups in your guild? [Yes everyone in both groups is technically in our<br/>\nguild] And 2 of the people (including the tag-along<br/>\nEnchanter) were being played by your guild leader? [ The guild leader is<br/>\nthe<br/>\nQueen and her husband the king were both playing 2 characters each. She was<br/>\nplaying the second L44 enchanter and her shaman and the king was playing<br/>\nhis<br/>\nwarrior and a cleric] &quot;Walk on the<br/>\nguild&quot; means leaving the guild? [Yes I mean leave the guild. Our guild is<br/>\nbased on the chivalric values and while this was hopefully only a momentary<br/>\nlapse of clear reasoning, I wanted them to see just how seriously we<br/>\nconsidered this issue.]<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to rules, we have loot rules to this effect that the king wrote that<br/>\nprimaries get first cut. We discussed this at the time with several<br/>\nguildmates and some were kinda divided over the rightness of it. I guess<br/>\nthe<br/>\nmudding factor was the chanter was actually there. We&#39;re a fairly small<br/>\nguild nowadays and this is the first disagreement over loot we&#39;ve had. I<br/>\nreally think it wasn&#39;t greed as much as it was them having been too<br/>\ninsular.<br/>\nThe king has an odd work schedule (doctor) and so they have never been<br/>\ninvolved in Planes raids or high level dungeon raids with anyone else. We<br/>\ntend to hang with other guilds like Venator Sapentia as we have several<br/>\ndual<br/>\nguilded or ex&#39;excal friends in VS and so we get out more you might say.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to multiples, we currently own 4 accounts: we&#39;ve had friends quit with<br/>\ndecent level characters and so we took over the account in one case and<br/>\nadded the third just prior to that for bankspace mostly. We have a 3rd pc<br/>\nin<br/>\nour office in easy reach of either of us so we do play up to 3 lower level<br/>\ncharacters at once usually wizard, necro, and a healer. We play with our<br/>\nfriends alternates who are similiar level and there&#39;s never any issue over<br/>\nloot. We have a third generation of characters started and nearing their<br/>\n20&#39;s now as well. It proves we&#39;re addicted of course but it&#39;s given us a<br/>\nchance to try out alot more character types; we&#39;ve probably got one of<br/>\neverything at this point. I do think there are classes and places where<br/>\nplaying 3 characters is not a good option. A couple of our friends have<br/>\ngotten second accounts from friends or family members as well so now we<br/>\nhave<br/>\nan address book of account names and passwords so we can move people and<br/>\nitems at will. Imagine the surprise of our 40s ranger friend when he logs<br/>\nback on Saturday to find he&#39;s wielding Yaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comments everyone, I wanted a reality check from some 3rd<br/>\nparties and I appreciate the input.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalana: we&#39;ve had the flu, and a 24 hr stomach bug both recently. Got to<br/>\nlove the daycare syndrome, we get every bug known to man. Fortunately my<br/>\ndaughter rarely gets sick herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Valentine&#39;s Day!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (creeping up oh so slowly on 55)<br/>\nExcalibur, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
