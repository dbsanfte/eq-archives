As in, pulling one<br/>\nmob out of many.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI refuse to pull in Dalnir&#39;s now.  Last time I tried, the first lull on the<br/>\nfirst mob was resisted...and it took the long way around to get me.  So many<br/>\ncasters, I was dead faster than I could warn the group.  With that less than<br/>\nstellar record, even contemplating trying to lull 2 or 3 before pulling 1 is<br/>\nless than appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;m missing anything, but just wanted to check here, and make<br/>\nsure.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
