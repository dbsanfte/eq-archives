I was new and got <br/>\nlost too many times to count, wether it was finding town, finding friends, <br/>\nmeeting places, and especially locating my corpse. I had ranger friends who <br/>\nwould tell me &quot;I NEVER us /loc, I&#39;m a ranger!&quot; I thought this was strange at <br/>\nthe time. After a coupla months I came to learn the lay of the land and all <br/>\nof the landmarks in most any particular zone very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nToward the end of beta I came to use it less and less. I also switched to <br/>\nplaying a bard, so finding my corpse was usually never a problem.<br/>\nOnce you learn the world Sense Heading and knowing landmarks and zone lines <br/>\nis really all you need. Many rumors went around that the /loc command would <br/>\nbe ripped out of the game for final, and i didn&#39;t care. I do believe it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have much to do with roleplaying, but i could care less either way <br/>\nif it&#39;s ripped out. It&#39;s a tool that can be used if you want to, just like <br/>\nPlate armor is there if you want to use it. If you don&#39;t like it DON&#39;T USE <br/>\nIT!! There are some new people who feel they need it for things like <br/>\nlocating friends in a zone they aren&#39;t familiar with, finding their corpses, <br/>\netc...SO LET THEM!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only times i have used /loc in final is when a party member is on follow <br/>\nand it gets screwed up (as usual) due to warping/lag and we get seperated. <br/>\nI&#39;ve had friends die from this - a friend of mind got seperated from me due <br/>\nto lag, and was MOBBED by caster bandits in W. Karana. She came back, i <br/>\nlocated her corpse, and she was jumped and killed AGAIN by different bandits <br/>\nafter getting seperated. After looting her corpse a second time and getting <br/>\nseperated a third time we finally ended up using the loc command to reach <br/>\neachother as she was completely lost. I have no shame! Had she not used the <br/>\nloc command to find me it was totaly possible she could have been killed yet <br/>\na third time. I&#39;m sorry, but I try to have as much fun and as little <br/>\nfrustration as possible in this game, and /loc has saved some frustration <br/>\nfrom time to time (including MANY times being dumped off the boat.) Whoever <br/>\nsaid they would rather drown than use the loc command, have &quot;fun&quot; swimming <br/>\naround in OOT next time you get dunked. =) That&#39;s far from fun in my eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I have EVER needed the /loc for a particular location I used the /ooc <br/>\nchannel to communicate that. If you are a hardcore roleplayer, turn ooc off. <br/>\nYou will see ppl use the shout channel for this for sure. My suggestion is <br/>\nto DEAL with it. What are your other options at the moment? UO? Meridian 59? <br/>\nGo for it! I&#39;m gonna have my &quot;fun&quot; in EQ... =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels to you,<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 28th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
