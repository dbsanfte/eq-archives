Then get a tell from your other friends who are lo to mid<br/>\n40&#39;s saying &quot;get your butt over here.&quot;  Make up some flimsy excuse to leave<br/>\nyour group like &quot;hey gotta go - got a shot at some quest crap!&quot; And then run<br/>\nto the Oasis.  When you get there, find that your friends 40ish cleric, sk<br/>\nand enchanter are pulling the dw gobs no problem.  Slay a bunch of them.  I<br/>\nmean like 20 or more. Loot a helm and scoot for the temple. <br/>\n<br/>\nTBH - I don&#39;t know how they broke that spawn.  I think they were doing Specs<br/>\nand maybe someone else trained some dw&#39;s up to the shore. Prolly hadda mez a<br/>\nbunch and they killed em off to break the spawn.  After that - the SK ran in<br/>\nto the water and dragged em up one or 2 at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often see DW pets stuck on the walls behind the ogers (also see em in<br/>\nOasis stuck on rocks) - I wonder if you argo the pet onto you would the DW<br/>\neventually pull.  Like the one in Mistmore? <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. only other DW pull - a ranger swam into the cave and tried to pull.  He<br/>\nwent LD.  His pal went down to cast EndureBreathe on him (not realizing that<br/>\nyou cant cast/heal/buff LD players) and somehow he died - also LD. Oh well -<br/>\nback to something safe - killing Ogers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tWednesday, December 01, 1999 10:33 AM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Re: Icy Greaves<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHarmy,<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;ve been wondering how to do this.
