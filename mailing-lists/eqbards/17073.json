You say<br/>\nyou retired your shaman at level 12.  Yup, those were bad levels.  Also the<br/>\nlate 20s sucked bad.  By level 34 though, you get your pet, your slowdown<br/>\nbuffs and HP buffs ... wow.  I would say a shaman at 50 is one of the MOST<br/>\npowerful classes.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I would say the same of Bards.  Try doing a dragon raid without bards...<br/>\ntry fear or hate without bards... sure you can do it but wow, they make SUCH<br/>\na difference.  By level 50, they are incredibly powerful.  And well, then<br/>\nthere is the whole run fast thing :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the trick to playing any class in EQ is sticking with it through the<br/>\n&quot;rough times&quot; and to try to emphasize your strengths not worry about the<br/>\nclass weaknesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nTani/Halana<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 7:36 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Attack speedups <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dean_kimes@...\">dean_kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All kidding aside, my point is bards are on the<br/>\n&gt; third tier at everything.<br/>\n&gt; We really do not have anything that is on a primary<br/>\n&gt; tier level.  The other<br/>\n&gt; hybrids are also a bit weak on primary but have<br/>\n&gt; additional secondaries to<br/>\n&gt; make up for it.  I&#39;m just not sure being third rate<br/>\n&gt; at nearly everything is<br/>\n&gt; as useful as Verant seems to think it is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree that we&#39;re weak in a lot of areas.  But then,<br/>\nI retired my 12th lvl Shaman because I think that&#39;s an<br/>\nunderpowered class.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo why do any of us play a bard?  I&#39;d say, because<br/>\nit&#39;s fun to outrun that train of orc oracles at 5th<br/>\nlvl, because there&#39;s nothing cooler than starting to<br/>\nheal that 6th lvl group on orc hill and have people<br/>\nsay: &quot;Wow!  Sweet!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about going to the beholder room and being the<br/>\ncharm-proofer. <br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s about passing high lvl druids in the Karanas<br/>\nlike they&#39;re standing still.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about dynamic buffing -- when we buff, nobody is<br/>\nleft out.  We can change buffs in the middle of the<br/>\nfight, we are the stick shift characters of this game.<br/>\n Everybody else&#39;s spells are what the military calls<br/>\n&quot;fire and forget&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s tough to be a good bard...and I play for the<br/>\nchallenge and roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut underpowered?  YES, YES, YES.  They really need to<br/>\nmake us a bit tougher.<br/>\n<br/>\nTyunes<br/>\nex-druid, ex-shaman, ex-necromancer...<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
