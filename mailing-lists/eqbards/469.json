That indicates that expending the initial practice<br/>\npoint to get the String skill gave me a skill level of 8.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, when I first started my character I expended one practice<br/>\npoint in Sense Heading.  The next time I went up a level in Sense Heading,<br/>\nmy skill level was only 2.  That indicated one practice point spent and one<br/>\nskill level gained.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does expending a practice point give you a random amount of skill levels<br/>\nbased on your INT and/or WIS score or does it only give you one skill level<br/>\nper practice point?  If the second case is true, how do you account for me<br/>\ngetting 8 skill points in String while only expending 1 practice point?<br/>\n<br/>\nReason for asking:  I am about to embark on a secondary career as the<br/>\nKelethin brewmaster for E&#39;ci.  I haven&#39;t expended any practice points in<br/>\nbrewing yet.  I want to get my skill up to 10 before I start the learning<br/>\nprocess.  Just need to know if I only need to put a couple of practice<br/>\npoints in it or will I need to expend 10 practice points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin  <br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
