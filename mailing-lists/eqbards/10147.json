IT","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1581761348\">I remember when I couldn&#39;t WAIT for dual wield :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how I understand it:  Every time your primary weapon swings, you<br/>\nmake a dual wield skill check.  IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT THE DELAY IS<br/>\nON THE WEAPON YOU HAVE IN YOUR SECONDARY HAND.. Many people I know use a<br/>\nreally low delay weapon in their primary and the higher damage, higher<br/>\ndelay weapon in their secondary, because they&#39;ll get that many more<br/>\nchances to swing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were you, I&#39;d put at least 5 or 10 practice points into dual wield,<br/>\nas with any other skill it goes up VERY slowly at first.  Once you hit 50<br/>\nor so you&#39;ll watch it go up a LOT quicker.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 23, I&#39;m using a PGT in my primary hand and a Barbed Leather Whip in my<br/>\nsecondary, that is when I&#39;m not using all-instrument attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI got my first piece of Lambent today! :)  Thanks to my roommate and a<br/>\nguildmate who gave me a lambent stone, I got one Lambent bracer, which<br/>\nwill be my ONLY lambent for a long time, I&#39;m sure, till I can start<br/>\ngetting the components myself :)<br/>\n<br/>\n.....................................Selianth Jongleure<br/>\n                                   ..The Divine Alliance<br/>\n                                   ..Bard of 23 Songs (*sigh* still)<br/>\n                                   ..Cazic-Thule server<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth Frantz                 &quot;The musician&#39;s art is to send light<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beth@...\">beth@...</a>      into the depths of men&#39;s hearts&quot;<br/>\n                                    --Robert Schumann<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 15 Nov 1999, Christopher Andrews wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Christopher Andrews&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmandy_drew@...\">cmandy_drew@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello Bards and friends,<br/>\n&gt;    Seeing that I&#39;m nearing lvl 17, i was curious about a few things <br/>\n&gt; really...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) What is a good strategy to use while dual weilding?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2) I&#39;m currently equipped with a PGT (dmg 6 del 24, berserker str proc wt 6) <br/>\n&gt; and SBS (shield of course will go bye bye), and a Pugius Dagger (dmg 5 del <br/>\n&gt; 21 wt 2.?) which I use to hone my piercing skills after the PGT has already <br/>\n&gt; proc&#39;d. [BTW, i realize that proc means cast, but what does it stand for or <br/>\n&gt; mean? =)] So will weilding both of these drain my stamina too quickly you <br/>\n&gt; think?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
