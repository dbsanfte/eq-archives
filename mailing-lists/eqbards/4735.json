That goes for between battles<br/>\n(Clarity and Restoration) as well as in battles (usually 3, but sometimes 4)<br/>\nand my fingers are tired.  The buttons on my keyboard are wearing out.  My<br/>\neyes are sore from reading all the darn messages which provide the most<br/>\nreliable clue for me to begin the next song.  So besides whining about it,<br/>\nwhat is my point?  I want a new, intelligent client interface!  I want to<br/>\nselect multiple songs to weave/twist/dicombobulate/phase-shift-modulate and<br/>\nthen I want to fight and watch the awesome graphics the game provides.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI know the interface will not support this right now.  The interface treats<br/>\nbards like casters, but that does not mean they can&#39;t alter the interface to<br/>\naccomodate this request.  Add a Harmony Ability (See Definitions below, esp<br/>\n#4a, courtesy of Meriam Webster&#39;s Online Dictionary).  This &quot;Harmony&quot;<br/>\nAbility could take the form of a button on the Abilities menu.  The Bard<br/>\npushes the &quot;Harmony&quot; button and then depresses multiple songs in the order<br/>\nthe Bard wants to play them.  The Server then starts each song and<br/>\nimmediately shifts to the next song until the list is completed and then<br/>\nreturns to the top of the queue.  To stop the auto-playing of songs, hit the<br/>\n&quot;Harmony&quot; button and resume manual control.  Simple enough?  The idea is not<br/>\nwithout precedent.  [The auto-attack feature of the game is a similar form<br/>\nof redundancy elimination (which could also be enhanced, similarly to what<br/>\nis suggested here, to include special attacks like kick or bash or the<br/>\nmyriad Monk abilities).]  There will be some resistance, perhaps even<br/>\nphilosophical rejection, to any form of scripting, but keep in mind that<br/>\nthis change would be completely voluntary for the user.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will make the game more fun.  This will make the game much more<br/>\nrelaxing to play.  This will also make things much more fair for Bards that<br/>\ndo not have an excellent internet connection and/or the good fortune to live<br/>\nin San Diego (I have a very, very fast DSL connection and can easily weave 3<br/>\nsongs and almost 4, while I have spoken to many bards that usually can&#39;t<br/>\nmanage more than 2).<br/>\n<br/>\nNarcissus of Povar<br/>\nButton Smasher Extraordinaire!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMain Entry: har´┐¢mo´┐¢ny<br/>\nPronunciation: &#39;h´┐¢r-m&-nE<br/>\nFunction: noun<br/>\nInflected Form(s): plural -nies<br/>\nEtymology: Middle English armony, from Middle French armonie, from Latin<br/>\nharmonia, from Greek, joint, harmony, from harmos joint -- more at ARM<br/>\nDate: 14th century<br/>\n1 archaic : tuneful sound : MELODY<br/>\n2 a : the combination of simultaneous musical notes in a chord b : the<br/>\nstructure of music with respect to the composition and progression of chords<br/>\nc : the science of the structure, relation, and progression of chords<br/>\n3 a : pleasing or congruent arrangement of parts &lt;a painting exhibiting<br/>\nharmony of color and line&gt; b : CORRESPONDENCE, ACCORD &lt;lives in harmony with<br/>\nher neighbors&gt; c : internal calm : TRANQUILLITY<br/>\n4 a : an interweaving of different accounts into a single narrative b : a<br/>\nsystematic arrangement of parallel literary passages (as of the Gospels) for<br/>\nthe purpose of showing agreement or harmony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
