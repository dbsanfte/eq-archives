I went back to some of my very first <br/>\n&gt; characters -<br/>\n&gt; ones I dropped only after a few weeks or in some cases a few hours of<br/>\n&gt; playing.  When I looked at their stats, I did a OMG!!!  What was I<br/>\n&gt; thinking????  Just for example, my hunam cleric has *alot* of <br/>\n&gt; charisma and<br/>\n&gt; some added strength.  Why?  Well, when you are hauling all <br/>\n&gt; that loot back to<br/>\n&gt; the merchants to get those extra good prices from the high <br/>\n&gt; charisma....<br/>\n&gt; seemed like a good idea at the time when all you had to go on <br/>\n&gt; was what was<br/>\n&gt; printed in the *stoopid*  EQ user manual.  Their character <br/>\n&gt; creation sections<br/>\n&gt; (to this day) really do a bad job of helping people get started.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;FYI:  I&#39;ve known him, in game, since Beta 2.
