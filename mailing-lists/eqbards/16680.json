The 4 (still<br/>\ntrying to get it back to 6) of us play every Thurs (or some other night<br/>\nif THurs is bad) night.  We email during the week to decide on our<br/>\ntarget (s).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for guilds/ multi group events.  They are a LONG way off for us.  We<br/>\nplay once a week for like 5 hours.  We will be lucky to average half a<br/>\nlevel a night pretty soon (right now we can still get a full lvl if we<br/>\nget to our &quot;camp&quot; early, camp meaning where we set up, we don&#39;t camp<br/>\nspecific mobs for long, too boring).  Doing some quick math, that means<br/>\nwe&#39;ll hit lvl 45 more than a year from now (I am factoring in a few<br/>\nmissed weeks for holidays, plus I know we will miss some during the<br/>\nsummer as 3/4 of us have a beach house for the entire summer)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re discussing looking for a guild (on Veeshan).  It wouldn;t really<br/>\nchange our play, except it would make it easier to find two more people,<br/>\nplus we&#39;d be able to help/get help with specific items/mobs.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if it will happen though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, since bards are probably pretty creative, I need to pick my last<br/>\nname.  I am a dwarven cleric named Legba.  Our group is the Wandering<br/>\nHues, and we all take the last name of O&#39;&lt;color&gt;.  Example the warrior<br/>\nis Willae O&#39;Grae.  I was thinking taking blue (for healing).  What do<br/>\nyou all think?  (O&#39;Blue O&#39;Blew O&#39;Blough O&#39;Bluwe etc...)  Think blue is<br/>\nthe right color for cleric?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
