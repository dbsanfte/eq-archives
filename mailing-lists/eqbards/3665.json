Now,<br/>\nlullaby is a bit of a different manner.  I played punching<br/>\nbag for someone one, by doing this to the two orcs<br/>\nthat jumped him, and I believe it was OBVIOUS that I<br/>\nwas not attacking, as I just stood and played, without<br/>\nswinging back :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I would love to see (but probably won&#39;t,<br/>\nfor balance reasons) is for a small set of our beneficial<br/>\nsongs (Chant, Hymm, the Psalms) to work on a<br/>\ntargeted, non-grouped PC.  I consistently invite people<br/>\nsitting and healing to share my song, while I&#39;m healing,<br/>\nbut you can only do that when you&#39;re solo.  I saved<br/>\nsomeone from poison the other day, but I had to group<br/>\nwith him first, and if I&#39;d been grouped he would have<br/>\ndied (I&#39;ve intended to get my bind wounds skill up for a<br/>\nwhile now, I just haven&#39;t had time).<br/>\n<br/>\nTindayen, Journeyman Bard of Povar<br/>\nSwifthawk Apprentice Shaman of the far north<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: SteelWolf &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steelwlf@...\">steelwlf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Use bellow without making an attempt to melee the monster at all, and only<br/>\n </span></blockquote>once<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the person fighting it has it around half life.
