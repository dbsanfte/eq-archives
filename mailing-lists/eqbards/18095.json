When you pull back and then zoom back in, you find the view <br/>\nwill only return to showing yourself from about the knees up. The reason I <br/>\nplay this way is first person views trigger motion sickness. I have to avoid <br/>\ngames where first person is the only view. I do have to switch briefly to <br/>\nfirst person for swimming in Kedge and that darn ladder out of the Mino <br/>\nElder pit in LG. As for keys, you don&#39;t want to know what I use as I got <br/>\nused to some keys from Beta 3 and have never bothered to change my reflexes. <br/>\nI twist songs with the mouse, as my hotkeys are mostly tied up with other <br/>\njunk.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Made L46 last night in KK, and a big ole shark gave me a shiny new helm <br/>\nfor a present. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nKnight Marshall, Order of the Rose<br/>\nExcalibur<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
