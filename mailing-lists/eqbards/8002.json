You<br/>\nreally need a cleric (who can buff you better and heal <br/>\nyou better than the druid can)  Keep the druid off the<br/>\nignites, and keep them on the healing + thistleshields.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt your level use your Lament song to shut down any extra<br/>\nbandits and try to pull them one or two at a time.  Note<br/>\nthat bandit casters usually don&#39;t charge you and will cast <br/>\nfrom afar, you need to be careful with them.  Eliminate <br/>\nthe non-casters by good lament/harmony pulling.  Then<br/>\nrush the casters.  Tactics at this level consist mostly<br/>\nof good pulls, as you have very little songs to your <br/>\ndisposal.  Make sure everyone has _every_ buff, then <br/>\nyou should Twist Anthem/Healing (with lute in hand) and<br/>\ndo _not_ engage in battle, in fact stay behind everyone <br/>\nelse out of melee range, and make sure the warrior/rangers<br/>\nattempt to pull extras you may accumulate off you.  You may<br/>\nwant to delay playing songs until most of the enemies are <br/>\nbeing attacked by your party.  This reduces the mobs from<br/>\nfluctuating onto you in the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve fought bandits, but keeping<br/>\nit simple is best.  And you&#39;ll find many of these tactics<br/>\nyou learn now, hold true until 50 (or at least 38 &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmonic Distortion, 38th unchained melody.<br/>\nLeague of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>\n&lt; Keepers of Norrath &gt;  Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
