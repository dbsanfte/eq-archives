Once both people<br/>\nagree on a duel, it does not end until one person dies or flees (zones).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4. Is it against Verant&#39;s rules to have outsiders buff a player while he/she<br/>\n&gt; is dueling?

No one else may interfere in<br/>\nanyway.  PvP or not, grouped or not, the fight is only between the 2.  I<br/>\ntake that back, if there is another NPC nearby, it might decide to join<br/>\nin.  The no interference rule only applies to other PC&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5b.

Most of the bard songs are<br/>\neither non-party only or party only.  So you probably don&#39;t want to due<br/>\nanother bard until you disband.  On a side note, when you&#39;re in a duel,<br/>\nyou may not heal/buff other people in your group either (unless one of<br/>\nthem is dueling you) until the duel is over.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6. If you&#39;re dueling in a PVP area, can other people enter the fight?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, a duel is strictly one-on-one.  If you&#39;re looking for a brawl, you <br/>\ncan go to one of those PvP area and start fighting without issuing or<br/>\naccepting a duel.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
