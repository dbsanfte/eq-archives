We came across a +pvp guy,<br/>\nwho had almost lost a fight with a spider or snake or something, and was<br/>\nbegging for help, cause he was poisoned and about to go unconscious.  So,<br/>\nthe kindly cleric whipped out a small heal, and poof, she was red.  Oh, man,<br/>\nI was upset.  Cause that meant if I turned on a song, I might go red too.<br/>\nThe +PVP guy was upset as well.  All three of us petitioned, and lo and<br/>\nbehold, I saw my first GM.  Was a druid I guess, cause he popped up as a<br/>\nwolf, and we all freaked, knowing we were gonna die, witha  named wolf right<br/>\nthere.  He changed back to human form, and calmed us down.  He explained the<br/>\nsituation to us, and was quite upset that it was not common knowledge about<br/>\nthe +PVP thing.  He ended up changing the cleric back, after some argument<br/>\nwith the other two GM&#39;s who showed up.  As far as I know, the next patch,<br/>\nthey changed it, so that helping a +PVP did NOT make you +PVP.  The GM&#39;s<br/>\nwere also going on about how many cases of this they had to handle in the<br/>\ndays preceding this, so I think that Verant decided that this was<br/>\noverloading them, and changed it.  So yes, it used to be that way, but as<br/>\nfar as I know, it was changed about week 3 or 4 of release.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacGrough<br/>\n16th Song Bard - waiting impatiently for dual wield!<br/>\nSolusek Ro Wanderers<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Elijah Meeker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Saturday, September 11, 1999 1:27 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Grouping with PVP on non PVP servers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elijah@...\">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;As for turning PvP that&#39;s a bunch of nonsense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I believe, looong ago, that was going to be the original mechanism.
