I finally used it at level 18 in the gorge on some blue<br/>\nmobs after a mini-train hit us.  I have to say it really did save the day<br/>\nas it kept them nodding so that the 3 paladins and 2 wizzies could get the<br/>\nelder muddites, chasm mino&#39;s and other assorted blue monsters dispensed<br/>\nwith.  I was fortunate enough to have explained about this song prior to<br/>\ngoing to the gorge so that the Paladins were aware they needed to taunt the<br/>\nmonsters off me.  I have to say the monsters really really REALLY hated me<br/>\nthat night! We did well until someone trained the zone on top of our heads<br/>\nbut then again, my song or not, nothing could have helped.  Luckily Selo&#39;s<br/>\ngot us out in time (1 bub of health!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am finding as I am going to more and more grouped dungeon settings that<br/>\nthe monsters are concentrating on me more than anyone else in the group. <br/>\nEveryone is asking if I am singing chords or dissonance (which I don&#39;t use<br/>\nfor that reason) because it is so obvious the monsters have it out for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh well I just tell everyone wood elves taste good. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nToxia<br/>\nBard 18th Circle, Prexus Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 13<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 2 Oct 1999 18:16:23 -0400 <br/>\n   From: &quot;Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Garramone@...\">Michael.Garramone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Learning with Lullaby<br/>\n<br/>\none other thing to add, is that using this song the same level you get it<br/>\n(15) will be less effective than a couple levels later.  so don&#39;t give up<br/>\non<br/>\nit.  once you gain a few levels it will most likely save you and your<br/>\ngroup&#39;s life more often than getting you killed.<br/>\nShada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard <br/>\nErisi Dlarit, Level 24 High Elf Paladin <br/>\nTyria Sarkin, Level 22 High Elf Wizard <br/>\nMithaniel Marr Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
