Come to think<br/>\nof it, aside from one really nasty incident involving the king<br/>\nwith a mithril 2h sword (killed me in about 12 seconds), I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t died in Lower Guk in months.  And I&#39;ve been spending a<br/>\nlot of time soloing in there ever since I hit 48.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else noticed a bug where 2h swords often will not<br/>\nshow up in a mob&#39;s hand, their attack messages say hit<br/>\n(instead of slash), but the damage is for a 2h sword and they<br/>\nhave it when you loot them?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
