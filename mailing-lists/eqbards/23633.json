Unless you are<br/>\nbeing attacked by multiple mobs, which with an enchanter doesn&#39;t happen too<br/>\noften, the damage output of the shields is sub-par.  We have several other<br/>\noptions which produce more damage per 6 second pulse.  About the only time<br/>\nwe&#39;ve used the damage shields was in multi-bard groups.  There&#39;s almost<br/>\nalways a better song to play than a damage shield, heck there probably<br/>\nalways is a better song unless you&#39;re just wading thru greenies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 29, 2001 2:26 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont know if I would pick those songs (what level bard? depends on what<br/>\nchoices were available) but they are not that far off base:<br/>\n<br/>\nChains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>\n<br/>\nFufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also reduces the mob&#39;s MR<br/>\n(if anything, lead with Fufils so next thing sticks better.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPsalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk and the damage<br/>\nshield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought,<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Matt DeBarger [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mattdeba@...\">mattdeba@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 29, 2001 11:12 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Soloing bards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh with my cleric (who normally plays only in his regular group, but with<br/>\nmy play I have missed several sessions and need to catch up), I was gfrouped<br/>\nwith a monk and a bard in L Guk (&quot;How long could it take for us to tfind a<br/>\ntank, lets get the ass sup camp while we wait&quot;).  The bard was singing the<br/>\noddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no snarer or slower),<br/>\nCurtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh????  I suggested<br/>\nsinging celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>\nanything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.  Oddly she was<br/>\nquite competent at crowd control.
