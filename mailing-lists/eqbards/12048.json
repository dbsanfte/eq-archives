I&#39;m finding I don&#39;t have time to clarity in<br/>\nbattle either!  But, in between battles, I&#39;d rather weave Clarity and Hymn<br/>\nto get us back to full health instead of asking the healers to spend that<br/>\nmana I&#39;m so busily working on getting back for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn battle, I still find Lullaby to be useful.  Granted, it works like crap<br/>\ncompared to an enchanter&#39;s mez, but I&#39;m finding that it does take at least<br/>\n50% of the MOBs out of the battle... especially the ones that con lower blue<br/>\nto me.  I do not play it when we have Solusek Gobs though, since they seem<br/>\nto be completely uneffected by it AND it pisses them off :-P.  Lullaby also<br/>\nseems to do a good job of interupting casters when we pull those 2 Inferno<br/>\nWizards... even if it doesn&#39;t reliably sleep them.  I actually use it when<br/>\nwe pull Sol Mages now also.  It&#39;s a lot easier to start it up and forget<br/>\nabout it then watching for the glazes over message and stopping and<br/>\nrestarting the song.  I only use Pixie when I want to take a single MOB all<br/>\nthe way out of the battle or space the spawns apart.  And as one more<br/>\nbenificial side effect of lullaby is they attack me instead of the greater<br/>\nhealers and as long as I have a dedicated greater healer (I seem to piss the<br/>\nmobs off much more then any greater healer does), I&#39;m going to leave Lullaby<br/>\nin my song selection.  I have more hit points and without a MOB beating on<br/>\nthem, they can actually cast :-).  Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t leave room<br/>\nfor a Psalm in my play list..<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, out of battle, Clarity and Hymn, in battle, Lullaby, Pixie, occasional<br/>\nchains and Clarity if I get the chance...<br/>\n<br/>\nLament for pulling, Levitate for emergencies (someone ALWAYS falls into the<br/>\nLava... especially fighting CWG&#39;s and EXG&#39;s), and Screech for when we need<br/>\nan Evac (although I&#39;m finding Lullaby is a good Evac song also... especially<br/>\nwhen running to zone).<br/>\n<br/>\nTaneran, also opinionated but willing to try new things ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ryan Honeyman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeyman@...\">honeyman@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, December 20, 1999 9:51 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: Eqbards@Onelist.

Healing, yuk yuk.  That&#39;s a big no-no.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Playing Hymm in battle at your level is like hanging a sign<br/>\n&gt;   on your back that says, Please Kill Me.  You are more likely to<br/>\n&gt;   receive blows in the 30s and 40s at your level.  Healing back<br/>\n&gt;   12-14 points of health each round just doesnt keep up.  Let your<br/>\n&gt;   healer do his job, and supply him with the mana to do it, while<br/>\n&gt;   twisting in anthem or resist/dmg shield.  At level 36, Celerity<br/>\n&gt;   song will make you want to twist in atkspeed again.  Anthem since<br/>\n&gt;   L10 gets really, really old by L36.  But you&#39;ll love Verses of<br/>\n&gt;   Celerity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I tested Lullaby last night on four Gnoll Reavers (L14-ish)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I got no resists (as I shouldnt have).  All nod messages, and<br/>\n&gt;   hardly any of those bastards stayed asleep.  They wailed on<br/>\n&gt;   me the whole time.  It was if I wasn&#39;t even playing the song.<br/>\n&gt;   If lullaby is this broken, I would resort to pixie/charm.<br/>\n&gt;   Although that can be a full time job, if you let it be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Harmonic, opinionated ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
