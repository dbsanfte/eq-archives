I /considered them, and they both &quot;scowled at me ready<br/>\nto attack&quot; I know that normal ghouls no longer attack me at 33, not sure<br/>\nabout the lurking mummies. Mummies and zombies in the desert still<br/>\nattack me as do skeletons and dry/ice boned skels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started Sonorous Clouding and considered them again. The mummy was now<br/>\nindifferent to me, the ghoul to my suprise, still scowled. I walked up<br/>\nto them, and they did not react.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I entered the next room, where there were Dark boned skeletons and<br/>\ndry boned skeletons. They were all indifferent to me, and did not<br/>\nattack, even when I poked one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went lower in unrest, into the pit where Hags, and Dusty werebats are<br/>\nand they were blue to me, but they were all indifferent and did not<br/>\nattack. Got the scare of my life while standing in the pit next to the<br/>\nhag in the center when she said something like &quot;you beliefs and personal<br/>\nactions are an affront to me!&quot; and attacked someone who had entered the<br/>\nroom behind me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in this way, our song is supperior to both invisbility and invis to<br/>\nundead, as it seems to affect them both. Occasionaly on my travels thru<br/>\nunrest I saw an undead that scowled at me, but they never acted like<br/>\nthey saw me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got attacked ONCE. I was standing in a room, I noticed the room was<br/>\ncompletly empty, and them poof, in drops a dark boned skel (green to me,<br/>\nno xp). It attacked immediatly and I killed it. My invis did not fail<br/>\nbefore he attacked. thought this might help to try to find the<br/>\nmysterious level at which SC affects undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n33rd Bard, RodcetNife<br/>\np.s. got my first lambent stone yesterday from a sand giant I killed. I<br/>\nhad bought 4 stones before, this one felt good to loot by myself :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
