For dungeons you<br/>\njust have to usually go a bit deeper.  I would suggest travelling somewhere,<br/>\njust travel until you happen on a good place to get bound.  Try Halas, bards<br/>\nare a bit rare there for some reason, and are always appreciated.  If you&#39;d<br/>\nrather solo, and want an area to hunt without the crowds, try Southern Ro,<br/>\nor even get bound in Erudin.  Dunegeon there bereft of other players, with<br/>\ngreen and blue catpeople to slaughter.  One could even potentially solo in<br/>\nCrushbone at level 12, the only problem being all the competition and<br/>\ncampers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMust agree that teaming with a monk works rather well!  My monk friend is<br/>\ndecked out in full woven armor (a benefit from knowing a bard who spent a<br/>\ngood deal of time in Guk, a fun little madhouse).  We were fighting<br/>\nscarecrows in Karanas, these things conning red to him but yellow to me.  I,<br/>\nwith only a fine steel weapon, could not join in the blows, but with only<br/>\nbellow and sing an anthem whatnot.  We were doing very very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Starting from level 10, though, I found that soloing became increasingly<br/>\n&gt;difficult.  At level 12 it got a big boost from the Bellow song, which<br/>\n&gt;probably increased my combat effectiveness by fifty percent.  But as you<br/>\n&gt; increase in level, you will find yourself much more effective in a party<br/>\n&gt;than solo.  I found that teaming up with Monks works especially well.  Even<br/>\n&gt;if I did nothing but stand there and play the lute twiddling between<br/>\n&gt;healing song and battlesong (and hit with an occasional punch for a few<br/>\n&gt;points), the monks and I together got far more experience than either could<br/>\n&gt;manage on our own, since they fought better and didn&#39;t have to wait so long<br/>\n&gt;between battles to recover.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - Windsong Wanderer, bard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
