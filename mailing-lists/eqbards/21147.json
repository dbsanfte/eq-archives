No raid I ve been on could be called a break since the first few weeks","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-702800251\">Well, getting imbrued armor is always a farm, since they took the pets out<br/>\nof Hate. No raid I&#39;ve been on could be called a &quot;break&quot; since the first few<br/>\nweeks the plane was live.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Fear goes, some people have never been, just got the levels<br/>\nneeded, have to work and such and miss out. What gets me is the people who<br/>\ninsist on putting them down for taking the opportunity to go when they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo newbie_guild_00 has been planning their first fear raid for a month for<br/>\nthis Saturday at 10 am. And Uber_Ass_guild_01 has broken the plane the night<br/>\nbefore. So the fear newbies catch the repop, cause it took alot of effort to<br/>\nmake their plane run happen and they know they might not have an opportunity<br/>\nto go back again for a very long while. They don&#39;t have as much fun as you<br/>\ndid, they aren&#39;t as challenged as you are, but they&#39;re in a new place having<br/>\na new experience so it&#39;s still fun for them to a degree. But you insist on<br/>\nputting them down and labeling them &quot;pharmers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the distinction between the people who intentionally go to farm<br/>\nrepops - make a plan to go into the plane after it&#39;s done and intentionally<br/>\ngo to get loot with no risk - and the people I describe above, I don&#39;t see<br/>\nhow you can tell the difference. Unless you monitor every plane-able<br/>\ncharacter going in and out of fear constantly. In fact, I&#39;ve never met<br/>\nanybody in-game who goes intentionally with this purpose. I think they are<br/>\nmore rare than you would like to believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember back when fear was unbroken on my server. The Uber types who<br/>\nconstantly whine about farmers in fear today, were the very ones who ran<br/>\ninto the plane after the server went down - while it was completely empty<br/>\nand safe - to explore, familiarize themselves with the plane, get their plan<br/>\nready, etc. I don&#39;t see much difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, other people&#39;s planar armor doesn&#39;t affect you at all. If it does,<br/>\nit&#39;s a problem with your perception of your armor&#39;s value and meaning to<br/>\nyou, not a problem with the value and meaning of theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Greg Gillan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ggillan@...\">ggillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Mon, 28 Aug 2000 13:49:48 -0400<br/>\n&gt; To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] Plane of Fear<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Planar armor can be worn with pride, knowing you paid the price for<br/>\n&gt; it many times over in blood.
