Where&#39;s the problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s one of the messages that I posted in response to a bitchy message<br/>\n&gt; over in the Lullaby thread:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bards -<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s important for us to focus on the one aspect of bards that<br/>\nseems<br/>\n&gt; to be *bugged*, not flame Verant because you feel that the Bard class is<br/>\n&gt; underpowered or unbalanced. Those are not the issues that we&#39;re attempting<br/>\n&gt; to discuss with this thread, and quite frankly issues that I feel are<br/>\n&gt; incorrect. I absolutely love being a bard. I feel that I&#39;m powerful enough<br/>\n&gt; and balanced quite well, thank you. However, I would love being a bard a<br/>\nbit<br/>\n&gt; more if Lullaby worked the way that GZ said on Veeshan that it should.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At the risk of multiple nerfs, let&#39;s recap some of our abilities:<br/>\n&gt; We cover ground much faster than any class in the game. Our spells last<br/>\n&gt; indefinitely and require no mana. We can cast while running. We have the<br/>\n&gt; versatility to strengthen our songs by equiping instruments instead of<br/>\n&gt; weapons. We can duel wield some of the finest weapons in the game. We can<br/>\n&gt; wear plate, and our armor quests have always worked and yielded quite nice<br/>\n&gt; (and nice looking) armor. We can tank a bit. We can do some single-mob<br/>\n&gt; mezzing with Pixie Strike. We get party-wide Clarity that costs no mana to<br/>\n&gt; cast. We can heal up to 19 HPs a tick (manaless) for all party members and<br/>\n&gt; at lvl 47+ we can now heal for up to ~35 HPs/tick *for the entire party<br/>\n&gt; simultaneously and without mana*. We are the only class versatile enough<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; change party buffs *during battle* as the battle flow changes (caster<br/>\nshows<br/>\n&gt; up, change to MR songs). We can put up party-wide damage shields that are<br/>\n&gt; also resist enhancers. We get *the best* resist buffs in the game against<br/>\n&gt; fire, cold and magic making bards irreplacable for dragon raids. We can<br/>\n&gt; track, hide, sneak and forage. And more...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ladies and gentleman. We rock. Period.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t enjoy playing a bard then by all means start playing another<br/>\n&gt; class. The Bard class is NOT broken. A song&#39;s behavior is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Crier Sharpsong<br/>\n&gt; 47th Bard on Fennin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; God<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Class<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Envy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You gripe when they moan about us being able to solo Hill Giants<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How do you think they feel when you moan about them?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Stop the vicious circle people.
