I was wearing Banded, Loved the look, hated the<br/>\nhelm.  Of course, I hate anything that covers up my naturally boyish good<br/>\nlooks ;)  But in any case, when I upgraded to Bronze (I&#39;m only 19th, BTW -<br/>\nBronze isn&#39;t considered &quot;twinkie&quot; by this level, since so many people are<br/>\nbuying and selling it) that was the UGLIEST helm I&#39;d ever seen.  I looked<br/>\nlike the Rocketman :P  Fortunately, I had saved my Banded helm, and so I<br/>\nwent back to it - at least it was better than Bronze.  I understand<br/>\nRubicite follows the Bronze model, in which case, I may just dodge Rubi<br/>\nhelms, too :P<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies the Orange-clad wanderer</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
