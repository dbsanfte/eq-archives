At least I sure hope so!<br/>\nWe are playing good against evil and the highest level character is the king.<br/>\nThe king for the good is lvl 46 and the king for the evil is lvl 48. The<br/>\nqueens are lvl&#39;s 41 mag/33 necro respectively. It should interesting<br/>\nespecially considering the player that is the 33 necro is a trip! He is SO<br/>\nfunny!! I&#39;m lined up to fight a lvl 15 mag. Hmmmm....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to be honest I haven&#39;t used Chords of Dissonance to much since I<br/>\nkept forgetting that I still had it &quot;active&quot; when I went around the guards. I<br/>\nkept ending up looking at the sky, deader than a doornail. But I&#39;ll experiment<br/>\nwith it in the next couple of days. My instruments are maxed out on practices<br/>\nright now though so that&#39;s good. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to ya later!<br/>\n<br/>\nMelodii<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Webber, Jessica&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:webber@...\">webber@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Never dueled, so I can&#39;t really be of much assistance, sorry.

We are having an event on <br/>\n&gt; &gt; my server,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karana, on Saturday. We are having a chessmatch at the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; chessboard with duels.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Different level players have been chosen for the role&#39;s of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; King, Queen,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bishop, Rooks and Pawns. I volunteered to be there because my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; guild has a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; major role in the event. I am a Level 11 bard. I figured I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be asked to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; assist in the organization of the event. However, I have been <br/>\n&gt; &gt; chosen as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PAWN! Could anyone advise me on the best strategy to employ <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to possibly come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out of this alive? I know I am probably being vague as to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of the rules of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the game but that is because they are still being determined. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I do know that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charming will not be allowed. Only self-buffs will be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; allowed. DOT&#39;s are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; allowed. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am still in the process of figuring out how to be the best <br/>\n&gt; &gt; bard that I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be and I have a lot to learn. So I look to each of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; you......the experts!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance you could give me!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Melodii (Bard of 11 seasons)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Free E-Cards, Screensavers, and Digital Pictures!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Corbis.com:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3358/7/_/451022/_/955635223/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3358/7/_/451022/_/955635223/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webmail.netscape.com\">http://webmail.netscape.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
