Certain creatures in there are unmezzable<br/>\n(frost spikes...at least our chanter couldnt) and if you lose a corpse deep<br/>\nin (such as when a creature flees, party doesnt zone and someone gets<br/>\nsummoned and killed) you are in for a long CR.  I was in a group with a lvl<br/>\n58 cleric, lvl 54 necro, 56 warrior, 53 bard (me), 54 enchanter and 51<br/>\nshaman and we could handle ONE frost spike at a time...two and we were dead.<br/>\nEverything we fought in there hit for 180+.  Alot of the crushed gems for<br/>\nthe Thurgadin quests dropped for us, as well as the new Cleric|necro<br/>\nimproved invis to undead spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same group went to Chardok the next day and it felt like a walk in the<br/>\npark compared to the keep.<br/>\n<br/>\nLago Bardoon of Bertox<br/>\n53 Minstrel<br/>\nGuild Leader, Defenders of Aleria<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; anyone hunt in Thurgadim? I was lost in there other night and came upon a<br/>\n&gt; curve where i saw a bat on the other side, it conned blue to me at 42 and<br/>\n&gt; ready to attack where as all the dwarves were amiable to me.  So i guess<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a mini dungeon in there. Anyone try it out yet?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And for that matter anyone try icewell keep yet? i zoned in by accident,<br/>\n&gt; hit<br/>\n&gt; tracking and everything on track was red to me except for 1 sentry which<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; blue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Minkin 42 bard<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
