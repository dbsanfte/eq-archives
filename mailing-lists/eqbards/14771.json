I&#39;m not to well versed on the layout of Lower yet (getting there tho!)<br/>\n&gt;but i believe it was the Cavalier group who was pulling.  People like to<br/>\n&gt;get a reputation as being a good puller by pulling crap from live side to<br/>\n&gt;dead side.  Heck, once I was grouped with a Paly (can&#39;t remember his name)<br/>\n&gt;who was a damned good puller.  He bragged that he once pulled something<br/>\n&gt;from upper guk! lol!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elwe Lay<br/>\n&gt;36 Songs<br/>\n&gt;Kinship of Valor<br/>\n&gt;Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pulling the live side stuff to the dead side it kinda fun.  One night I was <br/>\nin a group in the Hand room and one of the wizards managed to get an eye of <br/>\nzom to the live side.  Well the aggro spread to just about everything on the <br/>\nlive side so when I would be out pulling I would auto-pull live side frogs <br/>\nand minos from near the Frenzied room.  It was pretty funny, some of the <br/>\nbattles got a bit out of control but it was great experience :)<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
