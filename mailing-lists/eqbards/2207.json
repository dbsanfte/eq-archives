Definitely not a minotaur axe<br/>\n(delay 37)?  At low dual wield skill level, it will activate<br/>\nso infrequently that the damage it does is negligible, so<br/>\ndon&#39;t be afraid to buy a 21 delay dagger off a merchant for<br/>\n2pp (though if you find someone selling a fine steel dagger,<br/>\nall the better since it is 19 delay).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get it maxxed out, you want something with a good<br/>\ndamage/delay ratio, and perferably with a low delay.  You&#39;ll<br/>\nalso find that dual wield will often drain your stamina faster<br/>\nthan you lose hp.  Lighter weapons will reduce this effect,<br/>\nwhich is more reason to prefer low delay weapons since they<br/>\ntend to be lighter.  (I *think* weapon type affects this too,<br/>\nas I&#39;ve noticed more stamina drop swinging a 5 lb staff than a<br/>\n5 lb sword.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re 17 and still using minotaur axes?  Beg/borrow/buy some<br/>\nmagic weapons - many of the mobs you should be fighting are<br/>\ninvulnerable to normal weapons, especially undead.  For<br/>\ncombine weapons (can be bought at various gypsy camps), my<br/>\npreference is the rapier, spear, longsword, then scimitar<br/>\n(scimitar is the cheapest).  If you have some friends around<br/>\nL20, drop by Crushbone and kill Dvinn for his dirk - it is<br/>\nperhaps the best weapon you can get in this level range.  I<br/>\nmake sure *all* my friends have a magic weapon by L15, even if<br/>\nit means I have to loan one to them.  It is just not worth it<br/>\nhaving half your heavy hitters standing on the sidelines<br/>\nplaying cheerleader if you get an ice bone skeleton, or fire<br/>\nelemental, or any of the other multitude of mobs that require<br/>\nmagic weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
