Did I say<br/>\ncamping?  I said hunting.  Just because a group is &quot;pulling&quot; doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nthey&#39;re camping.  Pulling is the first step in breaking an area to penetrate<br/>\nit.  Just go to a plane raid if you don&#39;t agree.  You&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo this wasn&#39;t flame bait.  But you outright dissed the idea of an upgraded<br/>\ncharm song.  With Lullaby broken and Pixie Strike about 50% reliable Charm<br/>\nis one of our _best_ crowd control songs.  Also, in the expansion there will<br/>\nbe high level outdoor zones as well.  Charm will be very useful there if we<br/>\nget an upgrade.  I don&#39;t know about you but I don&#39;t _always_ want to group.<br/>\nCharm gives us a nice ability to solo which is different from fear/chain or<br/>\nfear/snare.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you insist on getting angry everytime someone points out a flaw in your<br/>\nlogic then you are bound to be miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia Jongleur<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevikazzam@...\">kevikazzam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 22, 2000 6:59 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] good news!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevikazzam@...\">kevikazzam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 3/22/00 4:34:54 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lyrnia@...\">Lyrnia@...</a><br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I really hate it when a bard who hasn&#39;t explored all the uses for the<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt;  powerful songs we get disses one as &quot;it&#39;s not useful&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really hate it when a bard doesn&#39;t know another bard and assumes things,<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; turn making themselves look foolish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I have used charm extensively, but now being 50 i hardly ever use it.<br/>\nBats/<br/>\n&gt; bugs etc  aren&#39;t charmable, and now guk is a joke.

But oh well,<br/>\nreplying<br/>\n&gt; to this is pretty pointless. . I love how because I post my views on how I<br/>\n&gt; would like to play in the expansion it is &quot;wrong&quot;.  I think your post is<br/>\n&gt; obvious flame bait. What level are you ? sign your posts please, I<br/>\nhonestly<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know how to reply seeing as I have no idea where you are coming<br/>\nfrom.<br/>\n&gt;         Bleh , go camp something , that seems to be what makes you happy.<br/>\n&gt; Fine, I was just saying I would like songs with both form and function. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t play to camp anymore, I play for friends, for raids, and to help out<br/>\n&gt; lower level people. I will prolly stay on longer if at least a couple of<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; songs had some sort of RP applicable aspect to them ( the illusion one<br/>\nbeing<br/>\n&gt; a great one ) but I doubt you know what RP is , nor have any interest in<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt;         Good luck , get 50 ( you win ! ) then get 60 ( you win ! ) then<br/>\nquit<br/>\n&gt; and go back to Quake.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ulaien Firsesong<br/>\n&gt; &quot;this is not helping my faith in sticking around in this game&quot;<br/>\n&gt; 50 bard tunare.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
