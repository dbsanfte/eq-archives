My<br/>\n&gt; subjective feeling is that there&#39;s a much higher chance of<br/>\n&gt; getting a second missed note right after you&#39;ve already missed<br/>\n&gt; one.  The random number generator really does seem to be<br/>\n&gt; screwy that way.  We got two 2h-mithril swords off successive<br/>\n&gt; king spawns (i.e. no placeholder in between), and the next day<br/>\n&gt; we got 2 ghoulbanes of successive shin lord spawns (that one<br/>\n&gt; was at 4am and I specifically asked everyone to stick around<br/>\n&gt; just in case the RNG burped, which it did).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
