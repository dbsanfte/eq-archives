Your AC is too low.  Are you still wearing that studded<br/>\nleather armor?  You were wearing that last week so I would assume that is<br/>\nwhat you did your tests with.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned that the (Ogre?) Shaman you fought had an AC only 7 lower<br/>\nthan you.  You should be way higher than him.  First every piece of armor<br/>\nyou put on should give you more AC than the Ogre due to your higher AGI.<br/>\nAnd you were using an AC15 shield while the Ogre was using a 2hander.<br/>\nUnless this shaman was twinked up, you should have a 50-70 AC advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should be in full banded at the bare minimum.  2-3 AC points per piece<br/>\nreally makes a huge difference.  Note there is a hidden multipler based on<br/>\nyour Agility.  So that 2-3 points can turn into 3-5 points per piece.  You<br/>\ncould easily boost your AC by 50 by switching to full banded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso get a few pieces of Bronze.  You should be looking for small Bronze<br/>\nand there should be plenty of that.  Get a few pieces depending on what<br/>\nyour STR can bear.  Bronze is heavy, but the AC is well worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said your STR was 87, 17 above the baseline.  You should have put more<br/>\nof your starting 25 into STR, but we can&#39;t change that now.  To carry the<br/>\nBronze, you need to get some +STR items.  Buy some +3 STR rings.  You can<br/>\nget a Purity Belt (+2 STR) for under 5pp.  You also may want to consider<br/>\nthe Cracked Darkwood Shield (+9STR).  There are many more items to choose<br/>\nfrom.  Once you pass the Bronze Era and start getting better, lighter armor<br/>\n(Ruby for example), you can start switching out the +STR items for better<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther hints would include don&#39;t use backpacks.  They are 3 lbs each.  Use<br/>\nlarge sacks or something lighter.  Destroy heavy rusty weapons and other<br/>\nheavy loot.  Sell often.  If your group is medding, quickly Selo over to<br/>\nthe neaest vendor and unload.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be very suprised at the amount of damage reduction a higher AC<br/>\nwill produce.  Try equiping yourself as a normal bard of your level and<br/>\nthen duel the shaman.  You will win easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWayne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
