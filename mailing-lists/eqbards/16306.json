(thats right: 2+ bubbles)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ll post my eqlog.txt when I get home.... it clearly shows this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  You feel an aura of elemental protection.<br/>\n  Your aura fades.<br/>\n  You are blasted by freezing winds.<br/>\n<br/>\n  wtf?  There is a bug with Bard Song Shields and I now have the log<br/>\n  to prove it.  And you all dismissed it as lunacy ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; \tA little CR, pause for a snack.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  We terrorized gfay in the downtime.  We had punching duels.  (I lost<br/>\n  mine, don&#39;t ever duel a ranger in a punching contest even with their<br/>\n  low H2H skill, he was double/dualing 5-9 dmg consistant enough that<br/>\n  my weak dual couldn&#39;t keep up. Plus he kicked me a lot, damn cheater.<br/>\n  heh.  That&#39;s ok, I was playing VoV ;-)  Got him to a sliver and died)<br/>\n<br/>\n  There were trolls molesting ogres who in turn were molesting wood elves.<br/>\n  It was actually some of the best times I&#39;ve had after dying in a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; \tHarmonic came along as a guest this trip, so he got to see both<br/>\n&gt; the guild at its worst and best :).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Had more fun than I have had in a long time.  Losing was fun, and<br/>\n  so was winning.  I have screenshots, but I didn&#39;t know whether you<br/>\n  all wanted them posted or not, so I just put them in my eq resume <br/>\n  folder ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Killed Maestro the other night too, finally got my evensong after<br/>\n  the first one was ninja looted from me months ago.  He was dual<br/>\n  wielding, 24 people killed him with 3-4 deaths.  Learned a lot<br/>\n  about how to fight him after the first attempt with 32 people<br/>\n  failed miserably.  32 people with his AE lifetap actually made<br/>\n  his hp go up, not down in battle.  Scary.  Cleared 5-6 static<br/>\n  houses (20-30 mobs) and one thing dropped, EM gloves.  That is<br/>\n  another great example of Verant under-rewarding players who&#39;ve<br/>\n  invested time into _their_ world.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Psalm of Vitality does not cure disease.  If anyone wants my eqlog<br/>\n  of that I pulsed it for 1 hour, and Strong Disease was still up<br/>\n  when I returned to the computer.  This applies to Psalm of Purity<br/>\n  as well.  It does not cure poison (although poison is much shorter<br/>\n  duration).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I tested a few other things as well, but I failed to test charm<br/>\n  again.  It could have been a fluke in permafrost, but I could<br/>\n  not clear the dmg list of any of the 3 goblins I tried it on.<br/>\n  I&#39;ll try it again this weekend, on the mobs I use to powerlevel<br/>\n  people (centaurs).<br/>\n<br/>\n  But there is absolutely something wrong with our magical song shields,<br/>\n  and I encourage others to test this against NPC spell casters.  If<br/>\n  I can later today at work during lunch, I&#39;ll log something to post<br/>\n  this bug.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harm.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
