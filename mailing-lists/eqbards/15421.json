He writes good code for the most part and recently completely<br/>\nrewrote a subprogram from scratch to clean it up and improved performance<br/>\nthreefold.  He changed the input parameters to remove obsolete ones as well.<br/>\nUnfortunately he forgot to change the actual calls to the subprogram so<br/>\nnothing worked when he put it through the pipe and it got to me for review.<br/>\nI had to actually go into the code myself and physically show him where the<br/>\nmistake was before he&#39;d even admit the possibility of an error.  Here it was<br/>\na case where he&#39;d look at his code, see no errors and reject all claims to<br/>\nthe contrary.  It never occurred to him that he actually forgot to write<br/>\nsome extremely simple code in another program altogether.  This guy<br/>\ncontinually makes these sorts of errors and these simple errors have<br/>\nobscured his generally sound coding to the point where he is likely to lose<br/>\nhis job if it continues much longer.  Bottom line is, it does no good to<br/>\nwrite brilliant code if that code can&#39;t ever be executed properly due to<br/>\nlack of ability to pay attention to details.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 24, 2000 2:03 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Levels after hell levels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 24 Feb 2000 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.langlois@...\">mike.langlois@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t mean this to be harsh, I just wonder what<br/>\n&gt; causes us to blame the coders rather than the designers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Um, and that sign reversal thing does suck, btw.
