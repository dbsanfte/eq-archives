If the other<br/>\n&gt; group was fighting multiple<br/>\n&gt; mobs and only dealing damage to one (as they<br/>\n&gt; probably should), then the<br/>\n&gt; other mob could easily be pulled off by your song. <br/>\n&gt; Once the mob jumped<br/>\n&gt; you, you started playing your songs the best you<br/>\n&gt; know how.  Anthem or Heal<br/>\n&gt; or whatever song you play is not only pulsing on<br/>\n&gt; you, but also on every PC<br/>\n&gt; around you.  While your songs don&#39;t affect PCs not<br/>\n&gt; in your group, they<br/>\n&gt; still put you on the hate list for the mob (and<br/>\n&gt; faction adjustments).  If<br/>\n&gt; you are surrounded by your group and the other<br/>\n&gt; group, the mob sees you<br/>\n&gt; buffing 12 PCs.  Nothing will get the mob off you as<br/>\n&gt; long as you keep<br/>\n&gt; playing your songs like this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And there are also other factors that can make you<br/>\n&gt; believe in &quot;bard hate&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Zones are buggy.  Songs can go through walls,<br/>\n&gt; unlimited z-axis, and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes all the way to the other side of the zone.<br/>\n&gt;  And many zones have<br/>\n&gt; pathing problems.  You may be affecting mobs and not<br/>\n&gt; even know it.  Five<br/>\n&gt; minutes later, the mob may have finally found a way<br/>\n&gt; to you.  It will run<br/>\n&gt; past other people who are not on it&#39;s hate list<br/>\n&gt; until it gets to you.  You<br/>\n&gt; might not have even been playing your songs for<br/>\n&gt; several minutes.  Of course<br/>\n&gt; you will think that it is Bard Hate, but there is no<br/>\n&gt; such thing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is a bard&#39;s song that cause monsters to attack,<br/>\n&gt; not just being a bard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wayne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter<br/>\n&gt; to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with the subject lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
