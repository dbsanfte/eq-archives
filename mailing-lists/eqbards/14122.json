I&#39;ve got an A3D<br/>\ncard (Turtle Beach Montego) and it&#39;s worked fine since they put the 3d<br/>\nsound in in beta 4. I haven&#39;t updated my drivers since then either. The<br/>\nrealism control in the game defaults to half way IIRC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Feb 01/00, &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sigh.  Every time I hear something like this it reminds me how little<br/>\n&gt; support you get from Verant.  I have an A3d card which Verant claims is<br/>\n&gt; supported.  However, I do not hear the sounds mobs make outside of combat.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s right, no howling wolves, no chittering beetles, and more importantly<br/>\n&gt; no stomping giants.  Every giant in the game can sneak right up on me and<br/>\n&gt; pound away to his heart&#39;s content.  It was 3 months before I even knew I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t hearing these sounds till a friend started complaining about all the<br/>\n&gt; druids running around howling.  He came over and listened to my system and<br/>\n&gt; was shocked.  Needless to say Verant&#39;s support was terrible.  They had three<br/>\n&gt; suggestions.  Get the latest drivers.  Done no change.  Turn down Hardware<br/>\n&gt; Acceleration.  Done, no change.  Get an SBLive card.  ???  They say the card<br/>\n&gt; I have is not only supported, but tested to work as well?  Anybody else have<br/>\n&gt; these problems?  Another guildmate of mine has a different A3d card and it<br/>\n&gt; works fine.  His is from a secondary manufacturer and mine is from A3d.<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;d think he would be the one with the problem?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y* </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
