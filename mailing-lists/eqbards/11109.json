Moving around while<br/>\nthere&#39;s still the root icon on your screen? Being rooted after you zone? This is a bug and always has<br/>\nbeen, and using it to break root is exploiting (not that it really matters to Verant). But I wish bards<br/>\nwould quit treating this as a nifty feature and acknowledge it as a bug. So technically the song is not<br/>\n&quot;un-broken&quot; as you say.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaev Lorekeeper<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nKimes, Dean W. wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a happier note I did some testing of Accelerando last nite vs. Root.<br/>\n&gt; This was prompted because prior to the patch I had made the following<br/>\n&gt; observation accidentally in Kithicor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was running across the zone when a skeleton of some description rooted me.<br/>\n&gt; Accelerando was up and running and of course I stuck in place.  Since the<br/>\n&gt; Mob wasn&#39;t advancing I quickly switched to twisting the two MR songs I had<br/>\n&gt; memmed to hopefully resist some spells until Root wore of.  Two pulses later<br/>\n&gt; when I got the &quot;you slow down&quot; message from Accelerando running out I was<br/>\n&gt; free!  Even though I had the Root icon clearly on the screen I was able to<br/>\n&gt; run to the zone.  Immediately on the other side of the zone I was Rooted for<br/>\n&gt; several minutes.  I tested this again before yesterday&#39;s patch and the<br/>\n&gt; pattern held, Accelerando, if it was on when the Root stuck, would break the<br/>\n&gt; Root when it wore off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After the patch this has again changed.  Last nite I tested some more to see<br/>\n&gt; what other change had been made.  If you are Rooted and Accelerando is not<br/>\n&gt; up, it will not break it.  If Accelerando is running when you get Rooted<br/>\n&gt; however, the very first &quot;Your feet move faster&quot; pulse message will break you<br/>\n&gt; free.  This happened every time I tried it, both with Root and Ghoul Root.<br/>\n&gt; The icon remained on the screen and moving to a new zone caused the Root<br/>\n&gt; icon to again take hold.<br/>\n&gt; For now, as long as Accelerando is running when you get Rooted, relax.  At<br/>\n&gt; the next pulse you should (to use Verant&#39;s wording despite my actual real<br/>\n&gt; testing) be able to move freely.  If Accelerando goes down though you will<br/>\n&gt; not be able to restart it.  If you zone with that Root icon still on your<br/>\n&gt; screen, expect to be Rooted on the other side.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Kitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
