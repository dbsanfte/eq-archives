(&quot;Come on Elfy, you&#39;re our guild only bard and WE WANT<br/>\nOUR CLARITY SONG&quot;).  After a day of very profitable gargoyle hunting (2<br/>\nlvl 20&#39;s, as my roomate decided to join me, 100P a peice in 4 hours), I<br/>\nset out to start buying some base equipment and catching up to my guild<br/>\nmembers.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot into a real good bird bashing group (Fatty SK, Ranger, Warrior,<br/>\nDruid, Enchanter and little old &quot;We don&#39;t care what you do as long as<br/>\nyou sing the heal song&quot; me).  THe enchanter and I talked strategies and<br/>\nwe decided that his mana was best spent hasting the  three melees,<br/>\nbreezing the druid and himself, and the occasional mez.  That left me to<br/>\nsing Binding, Hymm and Chant of Battle (three proccing weapons in the<br/>\ngroup).  After a few fights, it seemed I was unable to sing Chant of<br/>\nBattle when I was hasted AND fighting.  The particles would appear, but<br/>\nno one would get the icon or spell message.  When there was no fight<br/>\ngoing on or I wasn&#39;t hasted the song would work fine.  Does anyone knwo<br/>\nwhat was going on?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond question, when fighting Avocets I could not get binding to stick<br/>\nat all, so I was trying to think of something to replace it with.  I<br/>\nsung guardian rhythms (for the little ac buff).  Any suggestions for<br/>\nsongs to sing when the mob is too high level for my songs to affect<br/>\nthem?  I sing Hymm, Anthem/COB, but I need a third song for that<br/>\nmelody.  I am lvl 21, so no Psalm yet.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWe now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt DeBarger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
