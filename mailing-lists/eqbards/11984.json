Now, usually, I can find 2 HGs, put them together,<br/>\nzone to clear aggro and go hunt wisps for a bit and wait for another to<br/>\npop, but something wonderful happenned yesterday. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found my 2 HGs, let them fight. During the fight I saw ANOTHER<br/>\nwandering near. As soon as my HG won, I turned this new HG onto mine,<br/>\n(very quick fight).  Then, as I was heading for the zone, what do I see<br/>\nbut ANOTHER one. I circle back to pick up my friend, and go after him.<br/>\nVERY close fight where I switched pets twice, then bang, mine wins.<br/>\nGuess what? I&#39;m left with a Yellow HG whose health bar is down so low I<br/>\ncan&#39;t even see red. So I figure what the heck, I move in for melee. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhack! for 98 points<br/>\nWhack! for 98 points<br/>\nYou are stunned!<br/>\nWhack for 78 points!<br/>\nWhack for 92 points!<br/>\nYou are stunned!<br/>\nWhack for 43 points!<br/>\nA HG tries to hit you but you DODGE!<br/>\nYou slash a HG for 1 point!<br/>\nYou bash a HG for 1 point!<br/>\nA HG flees in terror!<br/>\nYou miss!<br/>\nYou miss!<br/>\nA HG winces!<br/>\nA HG says &quot;hit by non-melee 48 points of damage&quot;<br/>\nA HG&#39;s brain begins to smolder (thank you staff of writhing)<br/>\nYou have slain a HG!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo having totally depleted the HGs in NK, I heal up, and head for EK, up<br/>\non the hill between the HHP ramp and the barb village are somtimes HGs.<br/>\nI find two blue ones and send them at it. A close fight again, and then<br/>\nI move in on winner. He whiffs me TWICE, then is a helpless prisoner as<br/>\nI fear, DDD, fear(resist), fear(resist), fear, DDD, whacking all the<br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to NK, where I find a HG and a griffon awaiting my arrival. (BTW,<br/>\nHG blue, griffon yellow, HG wins) I take my HG for a run (across<br/>\nnorthern part away from peoples and track a blue griffenne. WHACK. Then<br/>\nit starts raining and I almost run right into a HG. We (me and my<br/>\nHG)decide we can take him, and we start. a Helpful level 45 or so wiz<br/>\ndecides to help me out as I am obviously running for my life from TWO<br/>\nHGs. and starts blasting the (non-charmed) HG. <br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, what can you do here? I mean, as we discussed earlier, you can&#39;t<br/>\nsend the wizard a private /tell saying &quot;pardon me, but I am charming the<br/>\nHGs to fight against each other. when it wears off it looks like I am in<br/>\ntrouble, but I am not, thank you for your concern&quot; because you get to<br/>\n&quot;/tel... and the HG would be on you. (since you can&#39;t autorun backwards<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he figures out what is going on once he roots one and mine<br/>\nstarts whacking on it. he /tells &quot;me oh, sorry, charm&quot;. I do /r &quot;yes,<br/>\nwant winner?&quot;, he sends &quot;sure&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is how I got 7 HGs in two hours. With over 200plat in cash and<br/>\nprizes. <br/>\nHG resist rate: 50%<br/>\nNumber of times I got hit(while not in melee): twice<br/>\nAverage money: ~26pp <br/>\nLowest money: 2pp<br/>\nHighest money: 54pp<br/>\nNumber of lambent stones: 0<br/>\nXP gained: Hardly any from charm victories, more from melee, total: 1/4<br/>\nto 1/2 bubble.<br/>\n<br/>\nUldar Ulfangson<br/>\n35th Bard, Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
