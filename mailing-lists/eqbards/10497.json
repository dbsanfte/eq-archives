His problem seems to be finding friends to play with.  Stay<br/>\nout of Sol-A - yes - especially if you do not have a good group.  Even if<br/>\nyou do - lo to mid 20&#39;s can be bad if you go to the wrong places.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow where the easy places are.  When my group went (former group I shud say<br/>\n- they are all hi 40&#39;s now and &lt;snif sniff&gt; I am stuck in 36 =( ), we tried<br/>\nthe bar room at 28ish and got spanked badly (cleric, bard, de sk,<br/>\nnecro/enchanter, troll war, ranger).  Later, when we were lo 30&#39;s and had<br/>\nmore experience in knowing what to clear first etc. we could take and hold<br/>\nthese rooms fine and get good xp and good loots. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, SOL-A seems good to me - hard yes, but once you hit the &#39;prime&#39; level<br/>\nit&#39;s good. I see these low to mid 20&#39;s running in and out and wonder where<br/>\nthey are going - I guess I need to explore it more.<br/>\n<br/>\nDungeons you do in groups and try to be at the prime level - too young and<br/>\nyou get spanked; too old and there is no xp and maybe still get spanked by<br/>\ntrains of greenies.  Solo, well you need to be pretty powerfull so that<br/>\nrules bards out unless you are really way above the mobs and still trains of<br/>\ngreenies can kill you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tJasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\n\t\tSent:\tMonday, November 22, 1999 4:08 PM<br/>\n\t\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n\t\tSubject:\tRE: [eqbards] Dungeon advice<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHmm..<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tBefallen would still be decent experience at your level if<br/>\nyou were in a<br/>\n\t\tgroup and fighting on the third floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI&#39;d recommend that you stay outta Sol A. <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWhat that says to me is that the place is<br/>\n\t\tslightly misdesigned.
