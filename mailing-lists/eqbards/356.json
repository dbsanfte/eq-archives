Though most<br/>\n&gt;anyone will dispute me go to the Ocean of Tears(take the boat from<br/>\n&gt;Kaladim or Freeport). The aqua goblins ALWAYS have atleast 1gp on them<br/>\n&gt;because of the bows they carry, and are good exp for 10-11. Then you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>can<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;move onto aviaks(going back to aqua gobs for money), at lvl 12 who will<br/>\n&gt;occasionally carry a bronze weapon. At 12 you can lead the out with a<br/>\n&gt;bellow and strike them from there, and if you get in trouble there are<br/>\n&gt;several areas around the island where the aviaks will not run back to<br/>\n&gt;get their &quot;friends&quot; that will resul in huge trains, and from there you<br/>\n&gt;can bellow them to death or sit their gaining health with a lute. Since<br/>\n&gt;almost nobody hunts in OOT there is hardly anyone to take monstys from<br/>\n&gt;ya. I gained 4 pp and a buble or exp last night playing my lvl 12, and<br/>\n&gt;thats including swimming back and forth when my bags get full. If you<br/>\n&gt;ever need a map Jooren on the Solusek Ro(sorry only there) sells them<br/>\n&gt;for 1pp a piece, which is damm good considering its very helpful if you<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t know your way around and it can&#39;t be found anywhere else to my<br/>\n&gt;knowledge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talonus<br/>\n&gt;Solousek Ro Bard of the World </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
