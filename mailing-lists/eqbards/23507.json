This applies unless the transgression is<br/>\nserious enough to warrant immediate action.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, if you all have a loot and/or behavior policy (which we do) and<br/>\nhis actions violate that policy (this behavior clearly violates our policy)<br/>\nthen no warnings are necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if that sounds harsh, but lying and greed are not the kinds of behavior I<br/>\nwant even peripherally associated with my name.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaravana Vireo<br/>\n57 Bard of Deadly Virtues<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve twice had a guildmate win a roll for an item claiming to want to use<br/>\n&gt; it, only to sell it within minutes of leaving the hunting area.  Both times<br/>\n&gt; other guildmembers wanted the item for secondary characters.  I&#39;ve taken to<br/>\n&gt; grouping with this person only when absolutely necessary, any suggestions on<br/>\n&gt; another way to handle this?  It has caused me some discomfort.  Fortunately<br/>\n&gt; the other bards in my guild are both excellent players and would never<br/>\n&gt; participate in such shenanigans.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
