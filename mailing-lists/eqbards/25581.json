So since I&#39;ve had to play a character <br/>\nfrom scratch with no twinked equipment, I&#39;ll be happy to give some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to stick to the Qeynos area, then I recommend a few places. <br/>\nBlackburrow is a good place to learn about grouping in a dungeon as well as <br/>\nabout trains. Everfrost (which is beyond Blackburrow) is a good place as <br/>\nwell, if you go out towards the tundra and group with a ranger. West Karana <br/>\nis better hunting for you at your level (various lions and bears) I would <br/>\nthink North Karana would be very challenging and it&#39;s far away from the <br/>\ncity, but if you&#39;re having fun there, more power to you. When you&#39;re high <br/>\nenough, hunting the rabid wolves in Qeynos Hills (or if with a friend, go <br/>\nfor rabid grizzlies even better!) and turning in their pelts is decent exp <br/>\nand good faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually prefered to hunt orcs in West Commons by Freeport. Of course, in <br/>\nFiriona Vie server, there&#39;s no auction spam. Northern Ro is also an <br/>\nexcellent place to hunt. I actually think this is my best recommendation, <br/>\nas when you&#39;re done in Northern Ro, you can head to Oasis and hunt crocs.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf Mistsong<br/>\n51 Minstrel, Bertox<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:56 PM 11/29/01 +0000, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:little_wild1@...\">little_wild1@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So, what, I join the list and you all get quiet?
