I was told you could kill as many as you want and<br/>\nstill do the crafted armor quests.

I turned in the crafted greaves components and got the<br/>\n&gt; greaves and exp, and all the centaurs immediately attacked me.  Guides<br/>\n&gt; said too bad, so sad so, I guess it&#39;s back to the birdhouse for me.  I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t attack (my attack key is f12, so I was nowhere near that) and I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t accidentally hit any area spells (the hotkey page I was on<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have any area spells on it).  Plus, they didn&#39;t attack my group<br/>\n&gt; partner after I was dead.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to check if they were<br/>\n&gt; still KOS to me, since I had my body dragged to the bridge and camped<br/>\n&gt; after I got dressed.  I was not terribly happy that the guides<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t res me after such an obvious bug, but with no way to prove<br/>\n&gt; it, I guess they really can&#39;t do anything.  Anyone else have this<br/>\n&gt; happen on other quests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Robynn, back to level 20, E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is another bug I have run into which creeped in in the last patch.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Apparently if you complete the Squad Ring Quest currently, you are<br/>\n&gt; handed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the ring and also immediately moved to KoS status will all residents of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rivervale.  How the heck do they miss this stuff?  Sounds like they<br/>\n&gt; either<br/>\n&gt; &gt; changed the faction hit for getting the ring, say from 5% to 100% (oops<br/>\n&gt; &gt; D&#39;Vinn coder, should been 10%) or they added a faction gain that puts<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; faction &#39;over the top&#39; thus turning it into a negative number.  After<br/>\n&gt; &gt; telling my bardic friend on E&#39;ci how cool the ring was he finally<br/>\n&gt; completed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the quest this morning.  He is currently unable to play that character<br/>\n&gt; after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; immediately dying to Marshal Ghobber and reappearing at his bind<br/>\n&gt; point...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Right in front of the PoD in the middle of Rivervale square.  Needless<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say the overzealous litle Zorros immediately whacked him again... and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; again... and again... before he figured out what must be happening and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pulled the plug.  I saw 4 corpses in the Marshal Ghobber room last nite<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thought little of it chalking it up to the usual <br/>\n&gt; &gt; W...H &quot;Hail Marshal Ghobber&quot;...A &quot;you hit Marshal Ghobber but he dodges&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; syndrome of forgetting to hit ENTER first.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This appears to be a major screwup that has seriously affected quite a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; number of characters due to careless coding yet again.  I&#39;m certain my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friend has lost at least one level if not more before he was<br/>\n&gt; disconnected.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not to mention the incredible amount of work he put into getting his<br/>\n&gt; faction<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high enough to get the ring in the first place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone else experienced this?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any word on how they are planning on fixing this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Katy Westerman                           Don&#39;t lick something unless <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>                         you really mean it.           <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw\">http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~katyw</a>             -Advice from the Naked<br/>\n&gt; CS/Comp Math Major, UC Riverside         Dancing Llama<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject lol. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
