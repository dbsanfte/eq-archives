Even at only 21st I felt safer in there then most dungeons.  I <br/>\nsuccessfully dodged several large trains with out really breaking a sweat.

Screech is helpful <br/>\nsometimes, but doesn&#39;t really help against trains with lots of casters (they <br/>\ntypically stand out of range of screech and fry you to pieces).<br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\nSteven S.
