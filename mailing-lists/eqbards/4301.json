If your pet does the most<br/>\ndamage (would&#39;ve gotten the kill) and becomes uncharmed and<br/>\nthus is not a pet anymore when your friends finish off the<br/>\nother mob, because a non-player did the most damage, the<br/>\ncorpse disappears.  This is not a problem when you&#39;re soloing<br/>\nbecause you&#39;re usually letting your pet make the kill.  But<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re in a group, sometimes your party finishes off the<br/>\nmob before you can recharm your pet, and the corpse<br/>\ndisappears.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat still leaves the question - if your pet does 99% of the<br/>\ndamage and gets killed, and someone else does the other 1%,<br/>\nwho gets credit for the kill?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
