This is another bard/rogue equipable items that casts an illusion <br/>\nof dark elf race on you. It also is +9 to charisma I believe, can&#39;t remember <br/>\nthe exact stats. Alot of the higher level barbarians want these since they <br/>\nalso reduce your size which can be life saving in Sol. They can&#39;t equip it <br/>\nbut they can use the spell on it. It also allows some race/classes to enter <br/>\nthe evil cities. I haven&#39;t played with one myself yet, they are no drop/no <br/>\ntrades, but I know several people who have them.<br/>\nAs far as halflings go, I am sorry but I avoid Rivervale when possible. The <br/>\nresidents are always trying to steal my purse or pinch me or both! And the <br/>\nmusic in Rivervale, argh! Give me HighHold any time, I&#39;ll take my chances <br/>\nwith the Mucktails.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBrilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe<br/>\nXegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
