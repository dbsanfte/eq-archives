Now, last<br/>\n&gt; time I visited the Bard Guild, my trainer didn&#39;t offer me 2hs as a<br/>\n&gt; skill, and I&#39;ve always heard that 2HS is not available to bards<br/>\n&gt; anyway, YET I can and have wielded this thing!  In truth, using this<br/>\n&gt; is not as effective as my Drachnid Leg Tip, but I think it&#39;s because<br/>\n&gt; Bards are NOT ABLE to increase their 2HS skill.  Also, the only time<br/>\n&gt; I do any REAL damage (25-28 per hit!) is when I&#39;m whistling the war<br/>\n&gt; song, otherwise I rarely hit above 10.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any information on this?  Have any bards been able<br/>\n&gt; to establish and improve a 2HS skill?  If so, bards just got a GREAT<br/>\n&gt; soloing weapon!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Rolaleil<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 15th Song<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci Server<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
