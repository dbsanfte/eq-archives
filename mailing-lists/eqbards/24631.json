My current <br/>\nguild is going through the &quot;big guild&quot; growing pains.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent problems are based around things like weighing whether full-time <br/>\nshould get precedence over part-time players (me being a part-time player <br/>\nhave my own opinion on this) and whether certain classes should be excluded <br/>\nfrom particular loots (us bards tend to get shunted aside for the melee <br/>\nclasses as an example).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, at this time, I believe that people who participate in more <br/>\nraids should get a weighted advantage over part-timers, but not to the <br/>\npart-timer&#39;s exclusion. As for class exclusions, as a bard it&#39;s a sensitive <br/>\nsubject to me. I&#39;d prefer no class exclusions myself, just restrict it to <br/>\nthose who could actually use the item. Another bard in my guild left when <br/>\nhe ranted about being told he could not roll for a breastplate somewhere in <br/>\nVelious.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously a sticky situation. Since I&#39;m on the rules committee for my <br/>\nguild, I figured I&#39;d find out how other guilds may have tried to solve <br/>\nthese and other dilemmas. Though, one nice thing is that there are 3 bards <br/>\non the rules committee. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we all feel it&#39;s best to get rules written into stone that are <br/>\napproved by a large majority of the guild (3/4th I believe). All sorts of <br/>\nproblems could be sorted out once we have a set up rules that are not <br/>\nchanged arbitrarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf Mistsong<br/>\n48th level balladeer<br/>\nRed Sky<br/>\nBertoxxulous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
