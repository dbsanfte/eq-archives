No<br/>\nphysical piece of geometry stops them from continuing in a straight line,<br/>\nbut the pathing ends there so they turn and try to retrace their steps.<br/>\nMost likely it is a broken &#39;T&#39; on the end of a normal path and that is where<br/>\nthey stay since fleeing mobs only turn on a path if they have to.  The same<br/>\nthing happens just in front of one of the Tizmak caves in GD.  The Tizmac<br/>\nwill sometimes get on that path and then walk back and forth along a 4or 5<br/>\nstep range till it dies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeffrey Sue [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsue@...\">jsue@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 16, 2001 2:34 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: Play the damn mana song (was: RE: [eqbards] Proposal to<br/>\nchang e how ...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:56 AM 1/16/01 -1000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There are numerous locations in the game where, due to pathing AI, fear<br/>\n&gt;kiting is a completely safe tactic.
