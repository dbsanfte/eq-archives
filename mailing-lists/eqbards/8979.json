The only way to make the<br/>\n\t\thero spawn that I know of is to kill the skeletons who spawn<br/>\nin the set points behind the gear.<br/>\n\t\tIn particular, there is one spot where he spawns instead of<br/>\na skeleton, and that is the &quot;niche&quot;<br/>\n\t\tbeside the big gear.   My gut feeling is that people have to<br/>\nbe killing minotaurs too, but that<br/>\n\t\tusually isn&#39;t a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tHe doesn&#39;t spawn on a set schedule, that&#39;s for certain.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen times when he doesn&#39;t spawn<br/>\n\t\tfor days it seems, and other times, he seems to spawn every<br/>\nfive minutes.  There was a period in<br/>\n\t\tbeta where I got killed by him 4 times in one 2 hour<br/>\nsession.  (Different heros).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tGood luck, kill him for me!<br/>\n\t\tJyzan<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t???
