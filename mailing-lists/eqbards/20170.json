I think that <br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; broad knowledge of class abilities and our support playing <br/>\n&gt; style tends<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make us excellent leaders and I often find people want ME <br/>\n&gt; to lead the<br/>\n&gt; group,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am almost never the one originally inviting or leading, <br/>\n&gt; because I hate<br/>\n&gt; being leader.  Call me lazy or whatever, but I would really <br/>\n&gt; rather have<br/>\n&gt; someone else do it, assuming there is a competent person who <br/>\n&gt; is willing. <br/>\n&gt; However, my groups tend not to see it this way.  No matter <br/>\n&gt; how much I try<br/>\n&gt; to take the back seat, if the original &quot;leader&quot; ever leaves, 10:1 they<br/>\n&gt; all decide that I will be the new leader, no and&#39;s, if&#39;s, or <br/>\n&gt; but&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt; it.  I don&#39;t claim to be very knowledgeable, or a great <br/>\n&gt; leader (though I<br/>\n&gt; *do* tend to take charge in a power vacuum, ask my guild :P), so I can<br/>\n&gt; only think of one reason groups seem to want me to lead--I <br/>\n&gt; know when to<br/>\n&gt; leave well enough alone.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If there is a problem, I will happily fix it and I will gladly resolve<br/>\n&gt; any conflicts or whatnot in a diplomatic way, but if there isn&#39;t a<br/>\n&gt; problem and the group is running great, I keep my mouth shut and let<br/>\n&gt; everyone have fun.  No one especially likes other people telling them<br/>\n&gt; what to do, and when people are comfortable doing their jobs, <br/>\n&gt; the whole<br/>\n&gt; group has a better time.  Not that I have not asked people to change<br/>\n&gt; tactics in some cases, or even kicked out threats to the <br/>\n&gt; group in others,<br/>\n&gt; but I think most people like a leader who is in that in-between<br/>\n&gt; area--neither bossy and overbearing nor too timid if changes <br/>\n&gt; need to be<br/>\n&gt; made.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Karisma Swiftarrow<br/>\n&gt; Guildmistress, Hearts of Valor<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heartsofvalor.com\">http://www.heartsofvalor.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Visit Swiftarrow&#39;s Song at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freespeech.org/karisma\">http://www.freespeech.org/karisma</a><br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; YOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\n&gt; Juno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\n&gt; Try it today - there&#39;s no risk!
