I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how any of you are able to stand it.  I worked on my enchanter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this entire weekend because I actually get to play the game,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instead of assidiously watching the chat window for &quot;missed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a note&quot; messages.  I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; frustrating.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My understanding of this, based on conversations with some <br/>\n&gt; GMs and high<br/>\n&gt; level bards<br/>\n&gt; as well as my own experience is that missed notes is related <br/>\n&gt; to dexterity,<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; charisma.  It&#39;s hard to notice a difference, because it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; surely just a few<br/>\n&gt; percentage points, but I feel like I miss fewer notes with a <br/>\n&gt; grotesque mask<br/>\n&gt; on than<br/>\n&gt; without.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.  <br/>\n&gt; Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.  <br/>\n&gt; For details, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt; programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> <br/>\n&gt; &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
