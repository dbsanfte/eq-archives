Another guild beat us there to kill him so I am once again waiting for an undead bard spawn. <br/>\nFor those of you interested in hitting Sebilis, I recommend going right after you scribe song of twilight because your group WILL expect you to mezz and I have found this song far superior to Charm in dungeons (and pixie strike is resisted too much).  There is an issue with Sebilis though -- that is getting out again.  It stinks that your group will have to clear a path to the portal when you have to leave.<br/>\nMy solution is the gate hammer quest in the Overthere.  I used my deciever mask to do the quest:<br/>\nGive the foreman a piece of jade to stick in his eye socket (or somesuch place P) and he&#39;ll reward you with a hammer that procs gate to the Overthere.  You&#39;ll materialize in the shipyard -- inside the ship being built.  You&#39;ll need mezz to stop the Skele that will immediately attack you.  Throw on the drum, right click your mask and beat feet.<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t been to Sebilis, I highly recommend it.  You&#39;ll meet some of the best players in the game there, and the loot/xp are great.  Just bring that hammer or a gate potion)<br/>\nTyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>\nBard of 55 songs<br/>\n <br/>\ndarkfox021 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blzkrg@...\">blzkrg@...</a>&gt; wrote: Someone on Concert Hall suggested a theory (actually did a bit of <br/>\nwatching to come up with it) that the Undead Bard is on a flat 20 <br/>\nhour spawn cycle and is KOS to Trakanon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is true, the seemingly random spawn times seem to come from <br/>\npeople not knowing when he actually died last (i.e. most of the time <br/>\nthat knowing precisely when Trakanon spawns) and relating his spawn <br/>\ntime to Trak&#39;s death, not the Undead Bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the server pops and both Trak and UDB spawn.  Trak kills <br/>\nUDB.  20 hours from that point, if Trak is dead, the UDB will spawn <br/>\nand stay up.  If Trak dies 18 hours after server pop, the UDB will be <br/>\nup in 2 hours.  If Trak dies 21 hours after server pop, the UDB will <br/>\nbe up in 19 hours (he&#39;d already spawned and was whacked by Trak once).<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nRetired<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In eqbards@y..., &quot;Azerael Ng&#39;Ataman&quot; &lt;azerael@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; He is something akin to Ragefire, he seems to spawn several times<br/>\n&gt; between the &#39;real&#39; Trakanon.
