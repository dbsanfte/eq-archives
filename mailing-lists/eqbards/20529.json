I think lambent is some of the best non-planar stuff you can get, so<br/>\nyou&#39;re always good going for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re looking for something a little different, there&#39;s always a Mith<br/>\nBP, should be easy enough, and shin guantlets from Lower guk usually just<br/>\nrot, so most wouldn&#39;t mind your bard going there and picking them up<br/>\n(they&#39;re no-drop, I think).  The arms that come off the mino Patriarch are<br/>\ngood...  If you hunt in Karnor&#39;s, you might be able to pick him up some<br/>\nsinging steel boots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say do the Lambent quests, they&#39;re usually better AC and stats than the<br/>\nother things you can get, but if you don&#39;t want to quest, there are still<br/>\nlots of other options.<br/>\n<br/>\nBien<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tCyr, Thierry [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thierry.cyr@...\">thierry.cyr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tMonday, July 17, 2000 12:24 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[eqbards] reincarnation time<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; hiya, just killing time at work so i figured i&#39;d ask this question.  First<br/>\n&gt; off let me state that my main character is a necro, lev 52 and that my<br/>\n&gt; bard<br/>\n&gt; lev 36 has been on the shelf for over 6 months. I dunno about all of you<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; i find 50+ levels to be extremely depressing, i feel like im taking one<br/>\n&gt; step<br/>\n&gt; forward 2 steps back. I find that in general all classes become extremely<br/>\n&gt; powerfull over 50 but its brain numbing repetition. I been playing my<br/>\n&gt; little<br/>\n&gt; warrior (almost 14 with 400hp weeee). Its kinda cool to play a warrior, i<br/>\n&gt; did 2 crippling blows in a row for 96 dmg to a kodiak at lev 12, i was in<br/>\n&gt; shock. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But anyways, the reason im writing this is because im thinking of<br/>\n&gt; restarting<br/>\n&gt; my bard, but he&#39;s nekked (i stripped him when i started my necro). You<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; anything that you could suggest to re-equip with that is easy to obtain<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; my big boy necro? i need armor and weapons. He&#39;s got lambent arms or<br/>\n&gt; bracer<br/>\n&gt; still, and shin pants and gloves and his mask still, and i think he has a<br/>\n&gt; barbute too, not sure. I was thinkin of goin to guk to get a carapace<br/>\n&gt; maybe<br/>\n&gt; for a bp till i get him something better. Any suggestions of something i<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; solo easily with my necro to give to him?  and weapons.... all i have is a<br/>\n&gt; fs long sword hehe (if only my wakizashies on my ranger were not no drop).<br/>\n&gt; maybe i could go terrorize the avatar of fear or something, but im hoping<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; avoid the claw. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as i think<br/>\n&gt; its<br/>\n&gt; time to take the dust off that old drummer boy. I think i&#39;d like to go to<br/>\n&gt; hate one day with that bard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your opinions/suggestions will not be taken lightly and will be greatly<br/>\n&gt; appreciated<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Rakka 52 Dark elf Heretic<br/>\n&gt; -Minkin 36 wood-elf Bard<br/>\n&gt; -Tanqueray 14 half-elf warrior<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.
