At this point to the right of the door or thereabouts is<br/>\n  a secret wall, which leads down to the Efreeti.  He is guarded by<br/>\n  two lava elementals.  They have dmg shield that really hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Alternately, you can walk past the spear spike trap, and hug left<br/>\n  wall to fall through a false floor which drops you right on his<br/>\n  head.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
