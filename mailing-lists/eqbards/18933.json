As long as their hosting wasn&#39;t exclusive I guess there&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; no downside but it wouldn&#39;t be very good to see the song list locked<br/>\n&gt; away on a site that hardly anyone goes to due to it&#39;s mostly out of date<br/>\n&gt; info.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check their bard song list, hidden away under strategy and<br/>\n&gt; statistics(tm)-&gt;class articles-&gt;bard spell list.
