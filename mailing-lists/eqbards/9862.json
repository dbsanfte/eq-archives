Selo&#39;s breaking<br/>\n&gt; root *was* very powerful, as you not only broke root but were in Turbo Mode<br/>\n&gt; when it broke.  That said, the song that we wouldn&#39;t keep memmed all the<br/>\n&gt; time and that *should* break root is Disenchanting Melody, and it&#39;s broken.<br/>\n&gt; So let&#39;s hope ADM gets fixed very soon.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
