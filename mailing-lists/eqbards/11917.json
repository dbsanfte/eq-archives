First time I fought Lucan it was a close fight, we&#39;d<br/>\nhad to zone 2 times already and our two highest level players left so I was<br/>\n2nd high man on the totem pole at 43. I couldn&#39;t leave and expect that the<br/>\nrest of the group could survive the reincarnate. Ugh.  My group, got the<br/>\nexperience which was a shock, but even more shocking, I went from<br/>\nindifferent to scowls even in wolf form!! ARGH!  The cleric in my group who<br/>\nwas dubious before the fight also got the faction hit for both kills and is<br/>\nstill dubious, WTF?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can still go to the bard&#39;s guild, I just have to announce a train and make<br/>\nsure I have my drum out when I run through East or West Freeport.  I used to<br/>\ngo invis but the militia scum has added a couple of guards that see invis<br/>\nnow so that strategy no longer works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can&#39;t kill me if they can&#39;t catch me!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 45 Bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
