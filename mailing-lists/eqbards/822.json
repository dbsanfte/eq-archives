As such I am about that age where I have almost<br/>\n&gt; &gt;completed my set of bronze armor. I already have 2 combine longswords, so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pretty soon I&#39;ll be as equipped as I ever really need to be.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To those of you who have reached and passed this point in the game, I <br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like to know what it is that keeps you going? I&#39;ve seen basically every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;zone, got everything I need. In real life this is the time I would <br/>\n&gt;finally<br/>\n&gt; &gt;settle down and spend time with my family.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Just looking for tips on what to do now . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmm... level 17... Ahhh!  Yes, I remember 17.. I had just started doing<br/>\n&gt;the caimans in Oasis and got my first piece of banded armor when a friend<br/>\n&gt;traded the LJ vest for a banded tunic for me.  I was soooo happy I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;see straight.  My first piece of non-leather armor!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Level 17 is also what introduced me to the &quot;you&#39;ll never stay with your<br/>\n&gt;friends&quot; problem, where my non-hybrid class friends could make 1.5 levels <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;my one... or in other words, it was when I discovered that my friends were<br/>\n&gt;very good powergamers and I wasn&#39;t. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, I&#39;m lvl 33.  I still can&#39;t go beyond the bedroom chamber in gukbottom<br/>\n&gt;but my old friends are starting to move beyond the tower there and<br/>\n&gt;occasionally go to MistMoore.  I know Najena like the back of my hand, and<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been constantly in CazicThule since level 19.  I know the solution to<br/>\n&gt;the 30th lvl song quest (I was the first to figure it out almost a month<br/>\n&gt;ago), but I still haven&#39;t completed it because I can&#39;t get a group of<br/>\n&gt;near-40th lvl chars together to help me do it.  But, I have every song up <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;my level other than 30.  I&#39;m only 4 levels behind the top bard on my <br/>\n&gt;server,<br/>\n&gt;and if I ever quit dieing, I might just catch them (8 levels ago they were<br/>\n&gt;10 levels ahead of me).  I still don&#39;t have full plate armor, but then, the<br/>\n&gt;pieces of banded armor that remain aren&#39;t that much less ac than plate, and<br/>\n&gt;they weigh a lot less.  I have a combine LS and a barbed whip, and<br/>\n&gt;despirately wish I could get better weapons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My friends from back when I was level 17?  Well, one started over, one quit<br/>\n&gt;the game over item issues, and the others are either 3-5 levels above me <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t group with me, or took time off an are now 10 levels behind me and<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t group with me.  &lt;walking off shaking her head&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Linako Lindenlyre of Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is from my viewpoint - a former beta-tester who hasn&#39;t jumped into <br/>\ncommercial yet, so correct any misinformation and I thank you in advance  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are 33 and people 3-5 levels above you won&#39;t group with you?!<br/>\nWTF? They must not know that they will get xp (and plenty of it) with you <br/>\naround. OK, I don&#39;t remember exactly the floor and ceiling limit for similar <br/>\nlevel ppl to group. I know up to like 20th it&#39;s a 4 lvl above or below <br/>\nlimit. But after 20th things change. When I was 20th I was able to group <br/>\nwith a 26th level person and get xp. When I was 23 I was grouping with 30th <br/>\nlevel ppl and getting xp. 3-5 level differences at your level will not put <br/>\nany significant dent in anyone&#39;s xp gains. They are just being either <br/>\nignorant, or greedy.
