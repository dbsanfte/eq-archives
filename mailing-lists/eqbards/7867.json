Raw silk begins triviality at 33 (gloves,<br/>\nmask) and is still not all trivial at 39.  Cured Silk does not begin<br/>\ntriviality until after at least 44 where I am now unless it is the masks,<br/>\nhaven&#39;t made one of those in a few points.  Also the raw silk and Cured silk<br/>\nwill sell to vendors for about break even.  I wouldn&#39;t suggest that unless<br/>\ndesperate though since the Cured is selling for 2-3pp per AC point currently<br/>\n(at least on E&#39;ci) and even the raw silk sells at 1pp+ per Ac pt.  Boots are<br/>\nthe biggest sellers for me.  No one seems to want a raw silk tunic, but the<br/>\nCured Silk tunic is so popular (due to giving that buff guildmaster look) I<br/>\nhave been selling them for 25pp with no complaints or question.  The Cured<br/>\npants are also very popular because the AC to wt ratio for them is ungodly<br/>\ngood compared to even mesh.  Pants normally have the worst AC/wt ratio of<br/>\nany piece in an armor set so these are an amazing upgrade even over mesh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi soon to be master tailor <br/>\n\t(assuming bards don&#39;t have another ridiculous skill cap that stops<br/>\nme!)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Katy Westerman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 05, 1999 1:26 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] A trade skill question for the gallery.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Katy Westerman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyw@...\">katyw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have recently begun working on my trade skills (tailoring, brewing,<br/>\nand smithing...I&#39;m a bard, I should trade like one!) and have a<br/>\nquestion about the new cured silk.
