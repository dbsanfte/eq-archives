Maybe I&#39;ve been unlucky with<br/>\n&gt;the group&#39;s I&#39;ve had; and also - I haven&#39;t got 53 yet - so I&#39;m relying on<br/>\n&gt;Charm or Pixie Strike - but the point I think is still there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well i wouldn&#39;t use charm in sebilis without a shaman or cleric, i would use pixie<br/>\nor twilight.  the shaman or cleric just opens up more opportunities for flexibility.<br/>\nnote that you&#39;ve already backed down from the original statement which was that<br/>\na cleric and enchanter are 100% required for any group post 50 (in a kunark dungeon),<br/>\nand that statement was the only thing i had a problem with.  i don&#39;t know how well<br/>\npixie works, they fixed both songs after i had twilight and i always use twilight instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;         But maybe - I&#39;m just mediocre...
