I believe \r<br/>\nmy following suggestion would be the best option and would\r<br/>\ncause the fewest problems.. On the other hand it would mean\r<br/>\nthey would have to actually FIX something else.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThey should make all these specialty items Quest only no drop\r<br/>\nitems.  Ie you find out from the captain in highpass that there is\r<br/>\nthis Really powerful Gnoll leader cutting though the ranks of his guards\r<br/>\nwith a mighty axe.  Now you when you kill him have the ability to loot that axe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNow granted several people will be able to get the quest at the same time.. but only one can loot it at a time and then only once.. no droping no trading etc.  Of course this would mess with the powergamers but then they&#39;re the onese who keep convincing Verant to Nerf classes for no particularly good reason.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
