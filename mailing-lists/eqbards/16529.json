Please comment,<br/>\n&gt; refine, etc.  First issue however is a RFC:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When Nameless went down (again :P) GM-Hideaki<br/>\n&gt; (Nameless GM boss) was in channel Wazzap Hideaki! and<br/>\n&gt; asked if anyone was a bard, I piped up and he said he<br/>\n&gt; and GZ were brainstorming (who was immediately<br/>\n&gt; upstairs from Hideaki) on bard song ideas for<br/>\n&gt; expansion.  He for my input on the following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. How would we feel about a PARTY BIND song, using a<br/>\n&gt; very expensive reagent and mana cost.<br/>\n&gt; --I told him that we did not want a bind song if it<br/>\n&gt; was identical to casters, however if the song allowed<br/>\n&gt; you to bind anyone anyplace (melees included) then we<br/>\n&gt; would certainly welcome it, especially at higher (51+)<br/>\n&gt; levels since expansion zones are rumored to be mammoth<br/>\n&gt; in scale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. How would we feel about party invis vs undead.<br/>\n&gt; --I asked, &quot;doesn&#39;t clouding provided limited invis vs<br/>\n&gt; undead?&quot;  His unequivocal answer was &quot;no.&quot;  Feel free<br/>\n&gt; to inject more impolite comments here<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:firehawk@...\">firehawk@...</a> but I&#39;m trying very hard to help<br/>\n&gt; since I really care about bards.  I told GM-Hideaki<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;d like an upgrade to Clouding that combined invis,<br/>\n&gt; invis vs undead and sneak (meaning no spell graphic)<br/>\n&gt; since this would give us an ability no single caster<br/>\n&gt; can provide (both invis types) and the no spell<br/>\n&gt; graphic would be a boon to +PvP servers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, on to a compendium of ideas.  I am not making any<br/>\n&gt; judgements on them, but I did take the liberty of<br/>\n&gt; combining similar ideas and/or taking the most well<br/>\n&gt; written version of an idea and posting that.  I will<br/>\n&gt; attribute all song ideas to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> unless<br/>\n&gt; you explicitly email me (privately if you want,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gww6e@...\">gww6e@...</a>) to say otherwise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. Upgraded charm.  Everyone and his brother (over 35<br/>\n&gt; responses) wanted this and hey, I do too. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Upgrade to clouding.  Nuff said, and I think I<br/>\n&gt; summed it up that we&#39;d like a song that can provide<br/>\n&gt; both types of invis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5. An improved damage shield.  This appears to be<br/>\n&gt; drawing interest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Denon&#39;s Sonic Reflection<br/>\n&gt; Brass<br/>\n&gt; Gives all party members a damage reflection shield.<br/>\n&gt; Causing a portion of the damage done to them in combat<br/>\n&gt; (melee & non-melee) to be reflected back at the<br/>\n&gt; attacker).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 6. An improved AE DoT with added effect (stamina drain<br/>\n&gt; being a common thread, the other was a lifetap<br/>\n&gt; affect).  Question at large: do mobs have stamina and<br/>\n&gt; if so, does it impact their ability to fight?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 7. Upgrade to selo&#39;s OR remove hard speed cap.  I<br/>\n&gt; personally want the cap removed vice burning another<br/>\n&gt; spell slot on an upgrade.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8. Upgrade to clarity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cassandra&#39;s Clarified Elegy<br/>\n&gt; Provides clarity2 (whatever that might be) +<br/>\n&gt; (limited?) elegy effect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9. Upgrade to MR debuffing abilities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Denon&#39;s Fog of War. AE snare. AE slow attack speed. AE<br/>\n&gt; Dot. AE magic debuff (30 pts at least). effect of fog?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 10. One-way teleport (self only?  to bard guild?).<br/>\n&gt; (Please no flames on this, I can already see it<br/>\n&gt; coming)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 11. Mem blur song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fitful&#39;s Forgetful Improv<br/>\n&gt; Voice<br/>\n&gt; Causes the target to become so fixated on the improv<br/>\n&gt; that it forgets whatever else it was dong.  Drawback:<br/>\n&gt; Bard possibly left on hate list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 12. Upgraded Atk Song<br/>\n&gt; Since we are out speed buffed by enchanters, a<br/>\n&gt; straight addition to Atk with an added component.<br/>\n&gt; Most commonly heard suggestion: rune type shielding.<br/>\n&gt; Other suggestions: massive ac bonus, massive<br/>\n&gt; regeneration effect, massive MR buff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 13. A proc song<br/>\n&gt; The Chromatic Scale<br/>\n&gt; Level: 36th<br/>\n&gt; Skill: Singing<br/>\n&gt; Description: A chromatic scale is all the notes an<br/>\n&gt; instrument is capable of producing, generally played<br/>\n&gt; starting from the lowest to the highest and then back<br/>\n&gt; down; slurred up (ligato), tongued down (staccato).<br/>\n&gt; The Chromatic Scale when song by the bard would act<br/>\n&gt; much as the Vampiric Embrace necro spell in that it<br/>\n&gt; imparts a proc to melee attacks however the twist is<br/>\n&gt; that there would be 5 different types which randomly<br/>\n&gt; kick off: magic, fire, cold, disease and poison based<br/>\n&gt; attacks. These would be DD&#39;s - there by filling in our<br/>\n&gt; missing DD ability, but in a uniquely bard fashion<br/>\n&gt; (group based, becomes more powerful as you add members<br/>\n&gt; and err... randomly good -- maybe. hehe).  Verant of<br/>\n&gt; course would come up with some cute little chromatic<br/>\n&gt; sparkles to surround us and multi colored blasts as<br/>\n&gt; the proc goes off. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS: For those D&D fans, recall the Chromatic* line of<br/>\n&gt; spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 14. A bard additive song<br/>\n&gt; Cinda&#39;s Companion Cantata<br/>\n&gt; Level: 49th+<br/>\n&gt; Skill: Variable (see below)<br/>\n&gt; Description: A cantata is a composition scored for<br/>\n&gt; many parts at once, incorporating both voice and<br/>\n&gt; instrumental accompaniment, hence this song would<br/>\n&gt; allow bards in the same group to ally their voices in<br/>\n&gt; song to intensify the effects of a common song - to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;stack&quot; the same song, perhaps with at<br/>\n&gt; 100*(2-((6-n)^(1/6)))% effectiveness, where n is the<br/>\n&gt; number of bards playing cantata. Yes, this could be<br/>\n&gt; exceptionally powerful, what with twisting and all,<br/>\n&gt; but this could easily be limited to only effect the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;top&quot; bard song in the spell list of the lead singer,<br/>\n&gt; whilst the &quot;recovery&quot; period of stopping the song<br/>\n&gt; would be such that twisting wouldn&#39;t be possible if<br/>\n&gt; you were a cantata player.<br/>\n&gt; Example: A group composed of 1 warrior and 2 bards<br/>\n&gt; stops to rest. Bard 1<br/>\n&gt; begins to sing Hymn, only to be joined in song by bard<br/>\n&gt; 2 with Cinda&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Cantata - boosting regeneration by their now intensity<br/>\n&gt; music (by the SWAG<br/>\n&gt; formula above that would be a +69%).<br/>\n&gt; Full stacking numbers would be:<br/>\n&gt; n    +%<br/>\n&gt; ---    -----<br/>\n&gt; 1    69<br/>\n&gt; 2    74<br/>\n&gt; 3    80<br/>\n&gt; 4    88<br/>\n&gt; 5    100<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 15. Song of Silence<br/>\n&gt; Solon&#39;s Song of Silence<br/>\n&gt; Effect: NON-PARTY: Silence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PBAE, fixed radius, 2 tick negate casting.<br/>\n&gt; NPC has one chance to resist intial and to break free<br/>\n&gt; each tick there after. Lute for enhanced effects. Save<br/>\n&gt; versus Magic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Comments?  I pulled a few of these from the eqbards<br/>\n&gt; archives (btw the onelist search facilities need some<br/>\n&gt; serious help).  Please no flames on this and I thank<br/>\n&gt; everyone for the mountain of responses.
