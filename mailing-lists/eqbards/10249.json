This may be in a city, out on the country along a road, or<br/>\neven out to places like the Ocean of Tears.  In order to get the song, you<br/>\nwould have to do a world-wide quest to visit each of these places and get<br/>\neach one&#39;s verses (which may spawn many sub-quests) that would comprise the<br/>\nfinal song which would be created from the combined verses at the end of the<br/>\nquest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual mechanics of the song would be to begin singing it, and then have<br/>\na dialog or portion of the interface display the choices of where you would<br/>\nlike to be taken (kind of like a ranger&#39;s tracking screen). As a balancing<br/>\nmechanism, once everyone in the party had been teleported they would all<br/>\nroll against their alcohol tolerance skill to see how disoriented the songs<br/>\nintoxicating lyrics had made them. Those that fail will stumble around drunk<br/>\nfor a time until it wears off.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 coppers<br/>\nBernwyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Greg Gillan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GGillan@...\">GGillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 6:37 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Philosophy behind the Bard class<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Greg Gillan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GGillan@...\">GGillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to see a bind song!  hahaha, just kidding.<br/>\n&gt; What I&#39;d really like to see is a memory blur song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elwyn Heartstring<br/>\n&gt; Level 50 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 7:26 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Philosophy behind the Bard class<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Reece, Tom - 25IDL G4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:g4mntofcr@...\">g4mntofcr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kitasi raises some good points IMO.  Although I always enjoy this type of<br/>\n&gt; discussion, I think we will have to wait until the expansion comes out<br/>\n&gt; before we will know what Verant has in store for the bards and other<br/>\n&gt; classes.  Its too bad that Verant is tight lipped when it comes to<br/>\n&gt; discussion of class mechanics.  In addition to new songs, I am hoping that<br/>\n&gt; we will get new skills like parry and riposte (with caps high enough to be<br/>\n&gt; useful) at some point after 50th level.  If the only thing we get are<br/>\nraises<br/>\n&gt; to the caps of our current skills, then I for one will be quite<br/>\n&gt; disappointed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how useful it would be, but maybe the bard community (mailing<br/>\n&gt; list and Concert Hall board) should bang heads together and come up with a<br/>\n&gt; list of song ideas and skills that we would like to see get added with the<br/>\n&gt; expansion.  The way I interpreted GZ&#39;s response to our questions, Verant<br/>\n&gt; seems to be having a hard time coming up with new song ideas.  Maybe we<br/>\n&gt; could help them out some.  I volunteer John Kim, Shada and Rokenn to take<br/>\n&gt; the lead on this:-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Snipped the original post in kindness to the digest subscribers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
