I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-379265370\">Faras,<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we are close in levels, let me tell you what I have that is different<br/>\nfrom you:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Banded Helm - not magic but I would hate to give up the 8AC points for the<br/>\n&gt; much heavier blackened crown with less AC and the same silly half-elf<br/>\n&gt; donut-looking graphic that I am tiring of.  I heard that Hatar (named low<br/>\n&gt; 20s sand giant in Oasis) drops a Fine Silk Turban with 10AC .1 weight and<br/>\n&gt; +10 fire resist that does not have a texturemap on my character, which<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; be cool if it is so, but I have never seen one to verify.  I would love a<br/>\n&gt; crested helm for the looks and bonuses but I don&#39;t know where to find it<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; how much they are<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tAnother option is the Leatherfoot Raiders Cap that gives +10 CHR. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Banded Mask - Dying to get the Guise of the deceiver, guess I should go to<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; bazaar and hope for the best - can&#39;t go to lower guk yet at 24th<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tI think the Guise is NO DROP.  I&#39;m looking forward to this one also.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Banded Tunic - Once again the AC can&#39;t be beat for a reasonable price<br/>\n&gt; unless<br/>\n&gt; I go to a medium bronze breastplate, and then the AC vs weight ratio seems<br/>\n&gt; not worth the upgrade - steel is way out of my price range and obtaining<br/>\n&gt; better items at my level is seemingly impossible unless I buy them - I am<br/>\n&gt; not keen on the bloodstained tunic because again, same graphic as banded<br/>\n&gt; with a reddish tint and less AC with magic bonuses that I am not all that<br/>\n&gt; interested in as a bard - really want some kind of breastplate for a more<br/>\n&gt; refined and respectable look.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tI wear small bronze because I can afford the weight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Banded Bracers - Nice AC to weight ratio, not sure what would be better<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; me at this time<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tAn option is to find a tank friend and go to the Ocean of Tears to<br/>\nget a Bracer of Erollisi.  A 28 monk helped me and we easily defeated the 2<br/>\nNPCs you have to fight to get the bracer.  I heard you have to kill the DE<br/>\nfirst before the pirate captain.  You then have to loot the DE first before<br/>\nlooting the pirate captain in order for their to be a chance to loot the<br/>\nbracer.  Don&#39;t know if this is true or a rumor.  The bracer gives +5 STR.<br/>\nNot certain what the AC is though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Blackened Leggings - purely vanity, love the look of the black banded<br/>\n&gt; pants<br/>\n&gt; on my half-elf, even though they are heavier and 1 AC less than Banded,<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; thing I would trade them in on now would be Barbed Legplates if I could<br/>\n&gt; find<br/>\n&gt; them because they are lighter, same AC as banded, and have AGI bonuses<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tI wear bronze because I can afford the weight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Banded boots -  just waiting for a chance to get some Dwarven work boots<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tSame here<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have 2 Opalline earrings that I am proud to wear because I killed the<br/>\n&gt; mob<br/>\n&gt; and looted them myself, a +5AGI ring and a +2INT ring (with base INT it<br/>\n&gt; takes me forever to increase my skills)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>\tI have 2 Jagged bands which really help me out with the heavier<br/>\narmor.  They also increase AC.  I would place these high on your priority<br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI got the 2 Jagged bands, DE hide gloves, and a trollhide belt for<br/>\ncompleting the Glowing Stein quest twice.  The first stein I traded for the<br/>\n2 Jagged Bands.  The second time I traded the four ingredients for the DE<br/>\nhide gloves and trollhide belt.  If you do this quest look me up and I can<br/>\nhook you up with someone who can trade you some good items for them.  If you<br/>\nneed help with the stein quest, send me a private email.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGaltin of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
