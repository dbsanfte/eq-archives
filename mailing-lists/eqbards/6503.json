So if a druid sow&#39;s you you can remove it. Or even<br/>\nbetter if he for instance is kiting a giant, he&#39;s using sow, and his giant<br/>\nis snared, dispell them both and watch him get out of this one, this has<br/>\nbeen very usefull for us when a couple of high level shamans tried to steal<br/>\nour very nasty named hill giant once. (Brood Bloodbeard).  they had to back<br/>\noff to rebuff themselves hence letting us get more damage.  Its such a pain<br/>\nin the butt when you spend over half an hour on a rare and someone tries to<br/>\nsteal it like that.  We got the kill, got 2pp each from it and a set of<br/>\ngiant toes, great rare verant!   oh and Ocylis ogrebane (or whatever its<br/>\nname is) the cyclops had junk like this too.   Both are 40+ mobs and have<br/>\ntons and tons of hp.  Killing zazamoukth was easier then brood<br/>\n<br/>\nMinkin<br/>\nSol Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tKimes, Dean W.

Barbarian<br/>\n&gt; shield graphics have the same problem and fixing it would require patching<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; huge file and making everyone patch in for about 45 minutes on a 56K line,<br/>\n&gt; longer if slower.  I believe the graphics will get fixed, just don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; it can happen before the expansion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of much greater concern is the SoW change.  Last nite on E&#39;ci druids,<br/>\n&gt; angry<br/>\n&gt; at losing their ridiculous ability to kite creatures that would slaughter<br/>\n&gt; someone 10 levels above them of any other class, were SoW&#39;ing every bard<br/>\n&gt; coming out of Freeport.  I got hit and then 30 minutes later got hit again<br/>\n&gt; by another druid in W commons.  He even went so far as to laugh and say<br/>\n&gt; &#39;Outrun me now nerf-boy!&#39;  Talk about childish.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another thing, although not specifically bard related except in that bards<br/>\n&gt; probably do more quests than anyone else simply because they can, is the<br/>\n&gt; constant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I went to the bank<br/>\n&gt; last nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 containers from the<br/>\n&gt; bank<br/>\n&gt; because if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I would have to<br/>\n&gt; carry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does Verant think the<br/>\n&gt; solution to everything is to make an item no drop.  Bizzarely the Bozemite<br/>\n&gt; Pestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the use for is now No<br/>\n&gt; Drop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires considerable<br/>\n&gt; faction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go figure.  Why should<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across Norrath to get the<br/>\n&gt; other piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put it in the bank<br/>\n&gt; while searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; weigh<br/>\n&gt; 10 lbs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi the questly nerfed<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Roach [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 14, 1999 12:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] alt.games.everquest<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have just posted the following Usenet message on the alt.games.everquest<br/>\n&gt; board that Brad says he browses, please agree or disagree, back me up, and<br/>\n&gt; hopefully I was not out of line in speaking for all of us:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Myself and others who have regular discussions on the ONELIST bard&#39;s forum<br/>\n&gt; are concerned about the recent changes to SoW that is affecting our Selo&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Accelerando.  It seems that once SoW is cast on us we are stuck with it<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; it overrides our Selo&#39;s, you can see how this can be a bad thing.  Please<br/>\n&gt; try to work something out with this, my suggestion is that you allow the<br/>\n&gt; ability for a player to cancel SoW if they choose just like you have done<br/>\n&gt; with the Levitate spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are also perplexed at the minotaur horn graphic turning into a burlap<br/>\n&gt; sack on our character&#39;s Avatar, is this intentional?  We have come to<br/>\n&gt; accept<br/>\n&gt; that our drum looks like a flute and we blow on our brass horns backwards<br/>\n&gt; and hope that this will one day be addressed, but maybe insted of a burlap<br/>\n&gt; sack, you could change the graphic for the mino horn to look like the<br/>\n&gt; graphic for the brass horn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I realize that the bards in EQ comprise a very small percentage of the<br/>\n&gt; overall population but it is that fact along with the fact that we are not<br/>\n&gt; inclined toward overt rants and flames against Verant or any particular<br/>\n&gt; person at Verant that causes us to often feel as though we are being<br/>\n&gt; overlooked.  I believe I understant that the Bard class was the last class<br/>\n&gt; to be developed before final release and as a result there were a lot of<br/>\n&gt; issues (such as the ones regarding how our instruments look and behave on<br/>\n&gt; our Avatars) that were left unfinished.  Granted, issues like this do not<br/>\n&gt; affect gameplay, they do make us feel like the stepchild class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I implore you to try to dedicate some of what I realize is already<br/>\n&gt; burdened<br/>\n&gt; development resources to addressing a number of these issues and providing<br/>\n&gt; us with at least a small amount of information on if and when you intend<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; address the ones leftover from beta (like my flute drum and hari-kari<br/>\n&gt; brass<br/>\n&gt; horn).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Faras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\n&gt; Half-Elf Bard of the 26th song<br/>\n&gt; Crimson Legacy<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Announcing the ONElist Hawaiian Sweepstakes!<br/>\n&gt; Enter to win a trip for two to Hawaii!
