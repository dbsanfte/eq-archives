From what I have read, a lot<br/>\nof folks are using non-KOS players to serve as scouts in PoG in order to<br/>\nlead the puller to the next mob. If there was some way for us to remain<br/>\nnon-KOS while pulling, think this could be a lot of fun since we could both<br/>\nscout and pull. <br/>\nI was thinking that one possibility is for an enchanter to cast mem blur on<br/>\nthe mob as you pulled it back to the camp. Another option would be for the<br/>\nbard to camp as soon as he dropped the mob off at the camp. This would work<br/>\nassuming you can camp out before the raid members killed the mob. Anyone<br/>\nknow if these two options will work? Any other options? <br/>\nIn every major raid I have attended, I almost always end up playing mana<br/>\nbattery or resist buffer. This is all fine and dandy, but getting to be main<br/>\nscout/puller for a major raid sounds like it would be a lot of fun.<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
