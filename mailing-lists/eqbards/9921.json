What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am <br/>\n&gt; wearing the shin<br/>\n&gt; greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I <br/>\n&gt; have never seen<br/>\n&gt; anyone else with legs that are this color.

The <br/>\n&gt; wood elf females<br/>\n&gt; I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged. <br/>\n&gt;  Is this the<br/>\n&gt; normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?
