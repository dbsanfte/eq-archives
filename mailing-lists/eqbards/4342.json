But you prolly need to<br/>\nplay your songs no matter what  but not AE (Area Effect).  You dint say<br/>\nzactly how young you are but the gnolls will go agro on people they see that<br/>\nlook tasty to them.  they can tell how young you are and will attack you if<br/>\nthey think they can win. As you get older they get smarter and if they are<br/>\ntrival to you they don&#39;t attack.  Unless of course their friends have<br/>\nwhipped them in to a frenzy and they are trying to help - ie you have<br/>\nstarted a train.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelos is not an area effect on NPC&#39;s so it should not matter.  But if one of<br/>\nyour party had attacked that gnoll and gotten on its hate list - then when<br/>\nit comes up and see you helping the party - it gets mad at you and attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play an aera effect - like chords in a place like BB - that&#39;s very<br/>\nhigh traffic and multi- level - you will get a LOT of attention real<br/>\nquick!!!  So don&#39;t play AE songs in dungeons - as a rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\nBard of the 18th level<br/>\na.k.a.

Boy was it dangerous!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnyway, when sitting down with my group while all the spell<br/>\nchuckers<br/>\n\t\trecovered from their oh so hard zapping, playing a nice tune<br/>\njust in<br/>\n\t\tcase we needed to run for the exit, it didn&#39;t take long for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n\t\tnearest gnoll to suddenly turn and jump on me.  Not the<br/>\nmeditating<br/>\n\t\thigh elves oh no, ignore everyone else and straight for<br/>\nlittle old me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo what I&#39;m asking is ..... were they just offended by the<br/>\nslightly<br/>\n\t\tdifferent interpretation I placed on Selo&#39;s, or do I have<br/>\nsome sort of<br/>\n\t\tbad guy magnet attached to me!  I deliberately avoided my<br/>\nhymn of<br/>\n\t\trestoration because I&#39;d heard they really don&#39;t like you<br/>\nhelping<br/>\n\t\tpeople, but does this hatred run to any kind of song<br/>\ndisturbing their<br/>\n\t\tclearly very peaceful home?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOh, and if a nice friendly L24 and up bard is hanging out<br/>\nhere who<br/>\n\t\tdonated a bronze helmet to a rather under-dressed me at the<br/>\ndocks in<br/>\n\t\tButcherblock a couple of weeks ago, can I just say thank you<br/>\nvery<br/>\n\t\tmuch, it&#39;s saved my life on a number of occasions :)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThanks everyone, see ya out there!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-- <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSaldara<br/>\n\t\tHigh Elf Wizard, Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMilaniel<br/>\n\t\tWood Elf Bard, Mith Marr server<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tShow your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html\">http://www.onelist.com/store/tshirts.html</a><br/>\n\t\tWith a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
