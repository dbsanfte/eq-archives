He does anything but spawn regularly. He know<br/>\nlonger follows the 6 hour schedule, and at times he won&#39;t spawn for 12<br/>\nor so hours, and then 3 times the next hour. I&#39;ve sat around, watch many<br/>\nfights(lost too many of them to nukers and high level people), and I can<br/>\nsafely say there is no pattern. Even the captain formula(don&#39;t ask)<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work anymore. Getting one of these is pure luck. And yes, it is<br/>\nstrange they spawn there. Too bad the captain is blind heh...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalonus<br/>\nTraveling Bard of Solusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Quick question: Someone mentioned the named fellow in highpass spawns<br/>\n&gt; regularly... what times may this be, if you please? I really want me one of<br/>\n&gt; those Tomahwaks but I&#39;ve spent so much time just sitting around watching<br/>\n&gt; tons of very organized people take care of that chunk of the zone that I<br/>\n&gt; feel I need to resort to more inquisitive methods. Nobody there&#39;s willing<br/>\n&gt; to join me in conversation.<br/>\n&gt; As an aside: Don&#39;t you think it odd that so many gnolls spawn right near<br/>\n&gt; where a captain hangs out and around the corner from a bustling city?
