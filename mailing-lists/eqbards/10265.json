I suppose I have fallen asleep at the keyboard once or<br/>\ntwice myself.  One time in particular I remember being tired and taking the<br/>\nboat ride from Freeport to Butcherblock.  I fell asleep at the keyboard and<br/>\nawoke several hours later to<br/>\n<br/>\nyou are hungry<br/>\nyou are thristy<br/>\nyou are out of food<br/>\nyou are out of drink<br/>\n<br/>\nscrolled up and the buffer has been full of miscellaneous chatter and<br/>\nLOADING, PLEASE WAIT...  I had probably taken the round trip about 12 times.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good thing that you can&#39;t die of starvation in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say as I&#39;ve ever lost my corpse, as I REALLY hate logging and<br/>\nleaving it lying around.  I retrieve before camping whenever possible.  I<br/>\ndid leave it in the Savant&#39;s room in Lower Guk the other night when 1/3 of<br/>\nthe zone was LinkDead at any given time.  It got kinda ugly in there that<br/>\nnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &lt;blushes&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, if you MUST know....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There have been times when I wake up in the morning in r/l and get to the<br/>\n&gt; PC, log in, etc. etc. and there I am nekkid at me bind spot.  Hmmm, wonder<br/>\n&gt; where I died last knight??? I vaguely remember something about<br/>\n&gt; South Karana.<br/>\n&gt; Guess I&#39;ll head that way and check it out.  Zone to HH: you have<br/>\n&gt; no corpses<br/>\n&gt; in the zone. Zone to EK: you have no corpses in the zone. Zone to NK: you<br/>\n&gt; have no corpses in the zone. Zone to SK: you cannot summon that<br/>\n&gt; corpse from<br/>\n&gt; here.  Ahh!  Time to mem Lyssia! =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or I have come back to the screen and the text buffer is spammed with:<br/>\n&gt; you are hungry<br/>\n&gt; you are thristy<br/>\n&gt; you are out of food<br/>\n&gt; you are out of drink<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Look at my health bars and sta is at zero.  And I am either<br/>\n&gt; blocking a zone,<br/>\n&gt; or nose against some far zone wall, or standing idly in the Gfay<br/>\n&gt; wiz spires<br/>\n&gt; (I fall alseep zoning or traveling and either die, hit a wall,<br/>\n&gt; stay at zone<br/>\n&gt; or my wiz fiends have been known to tele me to Gfay and leave me in the<br/>\n&gt; relative safety there ;p)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But even when I am awake, dungeons and me simply get me all mixed<br/>\n&gt; up. I get<br/>\n&gt; lost really easy.  My group gets real sick of leading me and out all the<br/>\n&gt; time.  Run to the zone?  You got to be kidding! Of course, it<br/>\n&gt; dont help when<br/>\n&gt; the route you take in is different from the route to run out and you never<br/>\n&gt; practice the run out (which I do now - when they take me<br/>\n&gt; somewhere new) &quot;ok,<br/>\n&gt; jump down here..&quot;  Jump here? How the hell am I supposed to get out???<br/>\n&gt; (Sol-a, Perma, and Lguk all have spots like that.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And the new places we got to now - you got to have an evac person or be<br/>\n&gt; prepared to fite your way in and back out.  We spent a long knight in Lguk<br/>\n&gt; Frenzied room.  At 3am as we were heading out, we decided to check the Exe<br/>\n&gt; room but someone lost invis in the middle of the jail.  Soon we had more<br/>\n&gt; than 10-15 froogies on us (full party of 6).  We paniced. Someone<br/>\n&gt; said Zone<br/>\n&gt; and we bolted.  Now the number of froggies doubled.  I died real fast.  I<br/>\n&gt; think 3 of the party made the zone.  We should have stood our ground and<br/>\n&gt; fought.  We had an enchanter who 10 of the mezzed.  All we had to do was<br/>\n&gt; kill them one by one. But we paniced and ran and that did half of us in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, to answer your question, MOST of the time I know pretty much<br/>\n&gt; where I am<br/>\n&gt; but if I am ever in doubt I just do /w sylly all and it tells me zactly<br/>\n&gt; which zone I am in and then I am fine =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sylly Songsynger<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 36th Song<br/>\n&gt; &lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>\n&gt; somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s. one time after helping someone get their corpse outta<br/>\n&gt; Runnyeye, we are<br/>\n&gt; Selos back from Gorge to HH ramp and go thru that canyon by the shops.  I<br/>\n&gt; see this corpse laying there and think: hmm, wonder who the fool was that<br/>\n&gt; died here?
