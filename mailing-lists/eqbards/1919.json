It acts like a<br/>\ncombination ensnare/walking sleep.  I&#39;ve not touched largo&#39;s melodic binding<br/>\nsince I got it, so I can&#39;t offer observations or comparisons of both of<br/>\nthese songs.  However being on Rallos Zek, I would prefer the 1 target<br/>\nfeature of chains over the AE of binding.  And like you said, it softens the<br/>\nnasty reactions when a wizard gets a little too trigger happy.  It also has<br/>\nan extremely high hate value, parallel to Bellow from what I&#39;ve witnessed.<br/>\n<br/>\nKa`Lend<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; The problem with this (and I was doing it too) is that Chain <br/>\n&gt; just slows<br/>\n&gt; the mob&#39;s movement speed from what I can tell, not it&#39;s attack speed<br/>\n&gt; like Binding does. And it doesn&#39;t seem to slow the mob&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; movement speed<br/>\n&gt; that much until the mob is low on hp. It can help keep a very fast mob </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
