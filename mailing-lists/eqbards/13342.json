I timed my group&#39;s activities one night.  We<br/>\nspent 10 minutes traveling, 6 hours fighting almost non-stop,<br/>\nthen 15 minutes traveling back.  The last 15 minutes, people<br/>\nwere really griping about how they hated having to waste time<br/>\nrunning back and forth, even though it accounted for less than<br/>\n10% of our total playtime.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
