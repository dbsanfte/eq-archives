I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad idea, but I think you&#39;re<br/>\noversimplifying the difficulty in implementation.  It has already been demonstrated how fragile the thin<br/>\nplane of ground we walk on is.  Certainly with respect to getting things to stay on that ground, and not<br/>\nbelow it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaluni Songhammer of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can think of a couple ways to fix that fairly easily.  Whenever a Mob<br/>\n&gt; spawns, just offset its location by a random number in the X and Y<br/>\n&gt; directions and pop him to the nearest surface.  This would make the game a<br/>\n&gt; heck of a lot more difficult at higher levels where a spawn that pops up on<br/>\n&gt; the other side of a wall is suddenly part of a melee in another room that<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t expecting more trouble because everything was &#39;predictable&#39;  Camping<br/>\n&gt; a spawn in a dungeon would become really tough if anyone was camping nearby<br/>\n&gt; spawns as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just the amusement of have the PGT Mucktail suddenly spawn between the two<br/>\n&gt; medd&#39;ing wizards instead of in front of the tanks would be worth the coding<br/>\n&gt; difficulty.  This cannot be that hard to code, obviously monsters spawn at<br/>\n&gt; fixed locs, just insert a function call to the random number generator to<br/>\n&gt; offset the database coords passed to the spawner and you&#39;d be done.  If<br/>\n&gt; their design is any good, this should be easy to implement.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Kitasi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In all seriousness, Verant has painted themselves into a<br/>\n&gt; corner with the basic game design where nearly everything is<br/>\n&gt; predictable.  The same mobs spawn in the same places carrying<br/>\n&gt; the same items and can be killed using the same tactics.  The<br/>\n&gt; only things that really require strategy are multi-mob fights,<br/>\n&gt; and exploring.  Given the high degree of predictability, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; virtually impossible to make things challenging - once you<br/>\n&gt; figure out how it works, it&#39;s predictable, and no longer<br/>\n&gt; challenging; so they&#39;re stuck with making things tedious.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
