There have been conflicting reports on the Concert Hall if<br/>\nit stacks with Clarity or not.  You get message that both songs went into<br/>\neffect, but some folks have stated they didn&#39;t see any noticeable difference<br/>\nin mana regen.  Anyone know for certain if Soothing and Clarity will stack?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso what happens when you have two bards in the group?  If both bards sing<br/>\nthe 34 song, will you get double the effect?  I gotta feeling that it will<br/>\nwork like Hymn and not stack if both bards are singing it.  Whats gonna suck<br/>\nis if it 1) won&#39;t stack with another bard singing the 34 song AND 2) doesn&#39;t<br/>\nstack with Clarity.  If this is the case, then the two bards would have to<br/>\ngo back to both singing Clarity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
