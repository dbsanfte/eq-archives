I was simply mastering my brewing trade in<br/>\nthe bar by the bank.  During this time, (NOT singing or playing) received<br/>\nfaction notices for people killing freeport NPCs!  Yet I have noticed no<br/>\nfaction difference from the Freeport militia, and even had three or four<br/>\nnotices over a few hours.  Since I&#39;m not using the sewers to navigate the<br/>\ntown, I&#39;m not worried as of yet, unsure if I really had a faction adjustment<br/>\nor not.  Perhaps we receive the notice but don&#39;t actually get adjusted?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand, not singing or playing, even in another building in the market<br/>\nsquare where the battle is taking place!  Best I can come up with, perhaps I<br/>\nhad given a warrior free Fierce Brew and they had gone and slaughtered<br/>\nsomeone under its influence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRoop<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Steve Fogle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steve.fogle@...\">steve.fogle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 8:54 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Petition about faction hit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Steve Fogle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steve.fogle@...\">steve.fogle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I must agree.
