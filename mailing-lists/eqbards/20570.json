For me the few<br/>\n&gt; times I tried it was death unless I could find a<br/>\n&gt; blue &quot;oracle&quot; type caster.<br/>\n&gt; No chains, No fear.  Sure DDD, and CoD do decent<br/>\n&gt; damage but avoiding adds<br/>\n&gt; was impossible nearly at that level range.  Now had<br/>\n&gt; Lullaby been working I<br/>\n&gt; imagine I could have pulled it off, but those levels<br/>\n&gt; were horrific for me<br/>\n&gt; because it was basically:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Log on, do /w friends all, /w armigers all.<br/>\n&gt; If no one in my area, Log off and log on as<br/>\n&gt; secondary.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I found that soloing those levels was nigh on<br/>\n&gt; impossible, and grouping with<br/>\n&gt; pickup groups was even more suicidal.  Invariably<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d die 3 or 4 times and<br/>\n&gt; end up barely breaking even for the evening. <br/>\n&gt; Biggest problem for me at<br/>\n&gt; those levels was that if anyone in the group screwed<br/>\n&gt; up, the instant result<br/>\n&gt; was 1 dead bard.  Didn&#39;t matter what the screwup<br/>\n&gt; was, bad pull, out of<br/>\n&gt; control pet, linkdead tank, etc. End result was 1<br/>\n&gt; dead bard and possibly 1<br/>\n&gt; or 2 other deaths.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Soloing at 27+ has been possible, even fairly<br/>\n&gt; comfortable, but that long<br/>\n&gt; stretch from 18th to 23rd was painful.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Kevin L.

Agreed 100%<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you take a Bard who&#39;s soloed his way to 50<br/>\n&gt; (/laugh), I&#39;d be willing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bet he&#39;s not a very good group player.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually the Bard is the 2nd or 3rd best Solo Class.<br/>\n&gt;  Especially after level<br/>\n&gt; 26 and 27.  And even before that you can easily solo<br/>\n&gt; any blue with a well<br/>\n&gt; played bard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, Mage&#39;s, Necro&#39;s, Druids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all have a slight disadvantage in that they can<br/>\n&gt; solo, so they might<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not pick up the group acceptable behaviors along<br/>\n&gt; the way, while Bards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are generally forced to group and thus forced to<br/>\n&gt; figure out HOW to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; See above.  Bards are, hands down, one of THE best<br/>\n&gt; solo classes in the game.<br/>\n&gt; We are also one of the best GROUP classes.  My bard<br/>\n&gt; can out-solo a magician<br/>\n&gt; any day of the week until a magician hits level 40<br/>\n&gt; or so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your points are valid regarding players who solo<br/>\n&gt; rather than group.  However<br/>\n&gt; I dissagree that casters have a harder time learning<br/>\n&gt; to solo.  Bards are<br/>\n&gt; easily as powerful (and in many cases far more<br/>\n&gt; powerful) as any caster at<br/>\n&gt; Solo play except perhaps the Necromancer and Druid<br/>\n&gt; classes yet we learn to<br/>\n&gt; operate in groups just fine.  Many people, even<br/>\n&gt; bards, don&#39;t realize just<br/>\n&gt; how powerful we are as a Solo class.   Even Druids<br/>\n&gt; and Necros have a hard<br/>\n&gt; time soloing hill giants.  Yet a bard can do it<br/>\n&gt; easily enough starting at<br/>\n&gt; around level 30 if we have 2 giants.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree completely that it&#39;s the player, not the<br/>\n&gt; class, that makes ANY<br/>\n&gt; character good, or bad, in a group.  I have grouped<br/>\n&gt; with good magicians, bad<br/>\n&gt; magicians and the whole range in between.  Same goes<br/>\n&gt; for EVERY other class<br/>\n&gt; in the game, including bards.  In fact, I&#39;d honestly<br/>\n&gt; say, I&#39;ve met more bad<br/>\n&gt; bard players than any other class barring Necros. <br/>\n&gt; (And they DO have a<br/>\n&gt; harder time learning to group because nobody wants a<br/>\n&gt; necro -until recently-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lyrnia Jongleur<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Norrath since Beta 2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Find long lost high school friends:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/7080/13/_/451022/_/964025462/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/7080/13/_/451022/_/964025462/</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter<br/>\n&gt; to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\n&gt; with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you do virtually everything online?  <br/>\n&gt; Why not sign up for LOWER long distance bills too?<br/>\n&gt; At beMANY! you will automatically get LOW  rates.<br/>\n&gt; Click here<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6595/13/_/451022/_/964026127/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6595/13/_/451022/_/964026127/</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please send submissions for the eqbards newsletter<br/>\n&gt; to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a> with the subject submissions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
