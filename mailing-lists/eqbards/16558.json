A song that teleports<br/>\n&gt; all party members in the zone to the bards location.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Name: Melanie&#39;s Call to Arms<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This song would be extremely useful in conjuction with<br/>\n&gt; a binding group leader.  Imagine doing an Efreeti Raid<br/>\n&gt; in SolB and wanting to bring in other members since<br/>\n&gt; some need to leave.  Instead of breaking through again<br/>\n&gt; the group leader would be bound at zoneline, group up<br/>\n&gt; the bard and gate back to his bindpoint.  The group<br/>\n&gt; leader would then group up the 4 new members and the<br/>\n&gt; song would be sung and would teleport everyone back to<br/>\n&gt; the bard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are a few problems with this that may make it<br/>\n&gt; too powerful.  Such as Plane of Sky (never been<br/>\n&gt; myself) where this song could not be used to bypass<br/>\n&gt; the teleporters etc...  Also this song may need to<br/>\n&gt; remove the party members from all hate lists or risk<br/>\n&gt; causing a hellish train through the zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it does remove everyone from hate list the song<br/>\n&gt; becomes MUCH more powerful (too powerful?) in that in<br/>\n&gt; Plane of Hate things go bad.  The bard runs up the<br/>\n&gt; wall away from the fight and sings the song, everyone<br/>\n&gt; teleports up the bard and is removed from hate list.<br/>\n&gt; Therefore removing the need for clerics to camp out<br/>\n&gt; etc...  This song combined with Selo&#39;s would make the<br/>\n&gt; bard extremely wanted in any group, but especially<br/>\n&gt; raids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The song may need to use up mana, although I really<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want all our songs using up mana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please let me know what you all think.  Its just an<br/>\n&gt; idea I came up with when I should be working =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jada MacAldred<br/>\n&gt; Bard of Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!
