Lots<br/>\nof bard songs over lap - so make the most of what you have.  Anthem and<br/>\nWarsong go together really well - Warsong is your musical FBSS (same haste<br/>\neffect in the song as in the sash - if you have both - your wep speed will<br/>\nbe at the maximum.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd learn about the &quot;all instrument attack&quot; - at various stages in your life<br/>\nas a bard, your songs and instruments can/will do more damage than melee<br/>\nweapons.  You need to set up hot keys and learn how to switch from one<br/>\ninstrument to another while switching from one song to another. Sounds<br/>\ntricky but once your get the knack, you will be amazed!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 15 to low 20&#39;s is a great time to be a bard.  Early 20&#39;s is painful but<br/>\ngets better when you get snare, fear, charm & pixie in the late 20&#39;s.  Then<br/>\nthe landmark 32 for clarity song.  Then 35 for tracking is excellent.  Then<br/>\n46 when you get out of that hellish 45!  And 50 is still an excellent ding!<br/>\nBy then you wil lhave killed a few dragons and slain some gods and their<br/>\nminions and have some excellent instruments and weapons.  At 50, with dragon<br/>\n& planes instruments, you can do 1800 dmg per minute or more.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards can do really well with partners - your heal song is great for melee<br/>\nclass who hate the long downtimes: warriors, rogues, etc.  You might want to<br/>\nteam up down in Oasis playing heal song and haste songs and kill off the<br/>\ncorrupt crocks and caimens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo again - welcome and good luck and good hunting!

I have a 15th level bard as my secondary character and<br/>\nhe&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; an awesome change from my ranger and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to play<br/>\n&gt; him most effectivly. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting orcs in Crushbone by<br/>\nmeleeing<br/>\n&gt; them and bellowing at them, it seemed to be working better than bringing<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; Anthem for it&#39;s haste factor. I tried using the 15th level song to mez<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; but it didn&#39;t seem to buy me anything in combat, it did help me escape a<br/>\n&gt; training one afternoon though. Is there another way I should be playing<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; encounters? Is there any place you&#39;d recomend that would be hungry for a<br/>\n&gt; bard to group at my level?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reedwind<br/>\n&gt; 15th level bard<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
