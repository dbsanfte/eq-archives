I always equip my<br/>\n&gt; flute when I want to improve my chances of getting a charm or pixie strike<br/>\n&gt; to stick.  First time I think I&#39;ve seen a post that said the flute didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; help with charm or pixie.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Charismatic, most definitely does nothing.  As the faction rate is<br/>\n  fixed, regardless.  I tested this, thoroughly with a flute a long<br/>\n  time ago.  Just stating, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in question.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since I got my new flute, and made sure it worked like a flute<br/>\n  (tested invis, and it worked) I&#39;ve been going back and trying<br/>\n  out songs to see what if anything this flute or my normal flute<br/>\n  would do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Charm, well since I&#39;m much higher than the highest level mob<br/>\n  I can charm, I think the level difference really plays more<br/>\n  of a role in the resist.  While waiting for a trip to Hate <br/>\n  near the wizpad in South Ro, I tested out my flute on sand<br/>\n  giants.  Out of 10 times trying to charm the giant with a<br/>\n  flute I got 2 resist.  Out of 10 times trying to charm the<br/>\n  same giant without the flute, I got 1 resist.  (got lucky,<br/>\n  as it were since I would expect to see 1 resist in 10, which<br/>\n  is acceptible to me)  I suppose a closer match would have to<br/>\n  be done to test without such a big level difference.  I can<br/>\n  say that when I first got the song, I used a flute exclusively<br/>\n  and never saw any more or less resists when I stopped using <br/>\n  the flute in highkeep charming goblins.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pixie, good old pixie.  A flute doesn&#39;t do a damn thing to this<br/>\n  song heh.  Pixie strike lowers MR by X amount whether a flute<br/>\n  was used or not.  Exactly 9 MR reduction at L50 on myself. <br/>\n  Although it may have changed, cause I could have sworn it used <br/>\n  to do more than that.  Anyway, for the stun component I used the <br/>\n  mean little Ogres guards.  And results over the 2 hours I was <br/>\n  there followed the same pattern, whether I had the flute in<br/>\n  my hand or not, I would only be able to stick 2 or 3 attempts<br/>\n  out of 10 tries during each battle.  The flute, if it was doing<br/>\n  anything, made no significant visual results.  This was as of<br/>\n  last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Harmonic, I will be testing it all over again tonight as well.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
