There are slower piercing weapons with better<br/>\ndamage for rogues, spellcasters don&#39;t really need melee<br/>\ndamage, and bards often don&#39;t have the strength and stamina to<br/>\ndual wield the heavier weapons favored by warriors and<br/>\nrangers.  If there&#39;s any weapon that has BARD written all over<br/>\nit, the dirk is it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would hate to see a bard pay a week&#39;s worth of platinum for<br/>\nit when he could easily get one for himself in about an hour.  <br/>\n(I would prefer even more to see its availability tweaked so<br/>\nthat it *is* worth a week&#39;s worth of platinum, and was<br/>\npossibly abusing the presence of a Verant insider on this list<br/>\nto state that opinion.  If you feel I got carried away, then I<br/>\napologize.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H. Kim<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
