It&#39;s part<br/>\nof what I expect from the game and it&#39;s ALL of the reason my GF is 45 while<br/>\nI&#39;m still 41.  Well, almost all, I usually find a way to die every so often<br/>\nout of pure stupidity :)  Like last night after banking in High Hold, I<br/>\ndecided to check out how green the mobs were to me in the basement.  I<br/>\nwaltzed on down there figuring it was camped and all of a sudden I&#39;m getting<br/>\nbeat on by gobs, which of at least 1 was blue. :)  I didn&#39;t want to train<br/>\nthe groups that were upstairs so I decided to try and fight them<br/>\nunprepared... I &quot;almost&quot; lived, managing to keep 1 charmed and keep the<br/>\nother 2 tied up  for awhile.  Finally 1 mob died, which I got the exp for,<br/>\nand of the remaining 2 mobs, the mob I didn&#39;t charm next decided he liked me<br/>\nmuch more than my new pet.... thankfully, my GF talked a level 50 cleric<br/>\nthat happened to be banking there to rez me... net loss of 1/4 bubble of exp<br/>\nand a little pride. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion to you would be either a) camp out of the beaten (read: train)<br/>\npath or b) move out of the zones where trains are more frequent.  I ended up<br/>\ntrading my Lambent BP for the sleeves and boots because any time I walked<br/>\ninto Sol A, I ended up dead.  The trade was WELL worth it to me.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure your level, but I&#39;d suggest moving to Cazic at the earliest possible<br/>\nconvenience.  4C&#39;s is train free.  And if you&#39;re careful, you&#39;re typically<br/>\nfighting when ready and only what you want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>\nXegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would try that, but the cleric would probably just let me die to prove<br/>\n </span></blockquote>his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; point.

The last 6 times we have had<br/>\n&gt; deaths in our Sol A groups, on 5 of them the deaths have gone like this.<br/>\n&gt; 1st death: me, 2nd death: other bard (lower level), 3rd death: other melee<br/>\n&gt; person.  The two bards have died a combined 15 times in our Sol A guild<br/>\n&gt; groups.
