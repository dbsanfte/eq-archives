It&#39;s a very nice weapon with a great curved<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; serrated look to it that I won a roll for.  I get inspected *a lot*<br/>\nwielding<br/>\n&gt; this weapon, and I get tells from out of the blue from people saying<br/>\n&gt; &quot;soandso told me you have a sharkjaw, what&#39;re the stats?&quot;  When people ask<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; tell them &quot;10/32 weight 2.0, procs Player Inspections&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Crier<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Madagan Songweaver, Bard of 35 Songs - Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ps, been residing in Kedge the last few days, exp is great there and<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good fun.
