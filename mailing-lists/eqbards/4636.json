I&#39;ve recently got to level 30 and in reading the Song List v2.0 on<br/>\nthe Level 30 song it said it was a DoT which lower magic Resistance as well. But it seems to be a Direct Target song  (it has a red<br/>\nicon like Bellow and Chain) and didnt do any noticeable damage. Is this a MR lowering song only? Anyone tested this song yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJackalX<br/>\nTunare , Level 30</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
