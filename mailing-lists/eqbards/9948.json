Is this your 2nd character?   Since you need money, I wouldn&#39;t think<br/>\nso.  Get out and see the world!  I&#39;d recommend Unrest (can always find a<br/>\ngroup), maybe CazicThule or Guk (bring your own group).  Maybe try<br/>\nPermafrost or even Everfrost (join a group hunting mammoths).  You can try<br/>\nRathe Mountains (Giant skellies, monk skeletons).  Most of the places you&#39;ll<br/>\nneed a group, but I&#39;ve always been much more of a group fighter.  If you<br/>\nprefer to play solo, You should probably stay in the Karanas, fighting<br/>\nAviaks or some beetles may give xp at your level.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tBien - Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
