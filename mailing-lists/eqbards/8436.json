He then got my group started in on it (I was the group leader)<br/>\nand everyone was against me claiming I should sing the song and that it<br/>\nworks especially well for manna regen when using the Mistmoore drum (which I<br/>\ndo not have by the way).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to explain the myth to them but no one wanted to hear about it and<br/>\nthis guy just kept saying he &quot;hates to see someone play the character class<br/>\nso poorly&quot;.

He said he was going to tell two of my party members (friends<br/>\nof his) to leave my group so I decided forget this (was now shaking in rage<br/>\nand very insulted by this guy) so I disbanded my group, apologized to the<br/>\nnice people in it, and logged out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could remember this guy&#39;s name so I could post it here but as I<br/>\nsaid I was seeing red at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that there are tons of lies and falsehoods about our abilities<br/>\nthat trolls and generally uninformed people love to spread for some reason<br/>\nor another.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Faras<br/>\n E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
