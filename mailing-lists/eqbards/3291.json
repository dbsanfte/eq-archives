There was a very annoying bard there<br/>\n(level 26, twinked with rubicite, staff of writhing, etc) who<br/>\ndecided he&#39;d practice his brass skill.  First it took him<br/>\nabout 100 tries to start it up.  Each failure was accompanied<br/>\nby the &quot;starts an song&quot; and &quot;misses a note&quot; messages - two<br/>\nlines coming about 4 times a second.  It scrolled all messages<br/>\noff everyone&#39;s screens and our group simply could not<br/>\ncommunicate with each other.  He kept this up for a good half<br/>\nminute, and gave repeat performances every time he decided to<br/>\nswitch a song.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he finally did get his song started, it was the Screech.<br/>\nHe managed to chase the lizards we and everyone else were<br/>\nfighting away.  He also tried Discord, which generates one<br/>\nline of spam every tick.  This wasn&#39;t a problem for him though<br/>\nbecause we were in the courtyard, and if a train got started<br/>\non him, the zone was just 10 seconds away.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease folks, realize that some of our songs can be very<br/>\nannoying both in terms of spam and graphics lag (especially if<br/>\nyou&#39;re L24 or over) for other people.  I practiced my brass<br/>\nskill in Crushbone (when others weren&#39;t around) and fighting<br/>\naqua goblins in the Cauldron, where I was almost always alone<br/>\n(though a few people decided I &quot;needed&quot; help when they saw me<br/>\nat the entrance to Unrest seemingly not fighting while these<br/>\ngoblins were beating up on me).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
