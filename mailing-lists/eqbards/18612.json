Rumour has it<br/>\n&gt;that this lake is supposed to be salty - and this might even be supported<br/>\n&gt;by the river that flows (uphill in some places) from the ocean to the lake<br/>\n&gt;- but if that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be - where is all the water<br/>\n&gt;going?  And why isn&#39;t this whole zone flooded?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway - it started out as an argument about why the water flowed from the<br/>\n&gt;ocean into the lake, instead of backwards - until we remembered that<br/>\n&gt;there&#39;s some NPC that says the lake is salty...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talies </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
