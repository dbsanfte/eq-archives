Kindly they let me loot them<br/>\nso I did.  Each guard would drop a fine steel longsword, a damaged<br/>\nhelm, and a kite shield.  The FS weap would sell for 4.5pp and the<br/>\nmilitia shield would sell for 8pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I hung out with them for a while and made a small fortune ( 100pp).<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted, I havent yet seen another group that would let me have the loot,<br/>\nbut if you can find one...its nice..:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dirk cost me 70pp too.  I tried to find lower but every time I tried to<br/>\nget a<br/>\nlower price people would laugh at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo considering that I was lucky to have enought to get it at all...I decided<br/>\nthat<br/>\nI would go ahead and plunk down 70pp.  and boy is it worth it.<br/>\nI love the dirk, and I love the way it looks...small, quick, deadly..*BG*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, tonight I think Ill start on those pesky Lambent quests..:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Probably the former.
