Thank you SO MUCH for the nice &quot;lift me up&quot;. I have so much to <br/>\nlook forward to! (smile).<br/>\n     <br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;d rather know AHEAD of time, rather than getting there, saying <br/>\n&quot;What the...&quot; and then annoying GMs about it. &quot;My XP bar is bugged!!! <br/>\nSomeone help me!!&quot;. Yeah... sure.... heheheh<br/>\n     <br/>\nAt level 30, I saw it first hand. It WAS slower to level, took several days <br/>\nrather than the typical couple of days. There were many times I would say to <br/>\nmy party, &#39;Guys.... it&#39;s moving... backwards.... argh... someone... help... <br/>\nme....&quot;<br/>\n     <br/>\nThat does bring me to another point: Love how a lot of players, who see that <br/>\nyou are above 30th, call me a &quot;power leveller&quot;.  I kinda squint my eyes <br/>\nbecause, though I understand what they are trying to imply, I have NO idea <br/>\nHOW to &quot;power level&quot;. I kill things that are blue to red for me. I get XP. I <br/>\ngain levels. I do all of this while hunting for rare items and hanging out <br/>\nwith friends. It&#39;s almost as though they insinuate that I &quot;cheat&quot; to level, <br/>\nor have some unfair advantage to levelling. I guess sometimes I DO have an <br/>\nadvantage: it&#39;s called a group. A group of friends. I have ALWAYS made <br/>\nbetter level progress while grouped than I do while solo. Some bards have <br/>\nclaimed great success while soloing. Guess I fit into the geriatric list of <br/>\n30+ year olds who play this game who just CAN&#39;T SOLO. I find it difficult, <br/>\nunexciting, and frustrating. Most of these people (though I admit, less than <br/>\na dozen) who accuse me of &quot;power levelling&quot; have been seen running around <br/>\nsolo. Well, my friends, drop the attitude, and get a group. Be loyal to that <br/>\ngroup, and level yourself. That, or quit being jealous (smile)<br/>\n     <br/>\nAnyway, I am bored, so thought I would rant a bit.

Took me 10 days to get from 45 to 46, <br/>\n&gt;playing every day several hours.  Half-bubble to a bubble for a long game <br/>\n&gt;day is a good thing.  Getting a bubble at 45 is like getting a whole normal <br/>\n&gt;level it feels like.
