Does anyone know<br/>\nif there&#39;s a difference?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I found that:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Playing this song underwater let me breathe, but I still<br/>\nlost stamina as if I were swimming.  I realize we have another<br/>\nsong just for stamina, but doesn&#39;t it seem rather silly that<br/>\nwe need to twist the two just to comfortably stay underwater?<br/>\nDoes the amount of stamina you lose decrease as you get higher<br/>\nin level?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Playing the song on dry land, you lose stamina as if you<br/>\nare swimming.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) You cannot swim backwards.

Inside in the back are two libraries.  One has a man<br/>\nselling wizard spells.  The other has a man selling bard<br/>\nspells (named Justin Rhymes or something, ha ha).  There is a<br/>\nbank in High Hold, so you don&#39;t have to risk any valuable<br/>\nequipment and money on the trip over; although the place was<br/>\nso camped when I went (the mobs there give no less than three<br/>\nhighly desired magic items) that I didn&#39;t even need<br/>\nAccelerando and just walked in.  The layout of HH Pass is<br/>\nrather confusing, and if you don&#39;t mind getting a map online,<br/>\nI suggest you do so.  There are no 90 degree turns in the<br/>\nplace, and it&#39;s very easy to get disoriented.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
