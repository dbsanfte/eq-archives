They take no dmg whatsoever =P<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a 50th rogue friend of mine duel a 49th necro pet. She was dual <br/>\nwielding a bone razor + eyerazzia. The pet was wielding nothing.

Charm is the 39 song and Provocation is the 45<br/>\n&gt;song.  also, the charm does work on 37+ mobs (i charmed a Seafury Cyclops <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;kill another), and it does not require a flute.  i didn&#39;t know about the 5<br/>\n&gt;mana someone else mentioned, i didn&#39;t think to look.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;the provocation song just pisses me off to no extent.  since when does a<br/>\n&gt;bard have to target a fellow player to get the effect of their song?  also,<br/>\n&gt;the player does not have to be grouped with the bard.  AND the song only<br/>\n&gt;lasts one pulse, you have to refresh it like chain or bellow.  this song is<br/>\n&gt;so completely un-bardlike.  another wasted slot in our spellbook as far as <br/>\n&gt;i<br/>\n&gt;can tell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shada Powa, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>\n&gt;Tyria Sarkin, L49 High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt;&lt;Afterlife&gt; Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EQ Casters reports new songs - I&#39;m sure I missed some, but in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just looking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at the pre-50th, I see 2 very interesting entries:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 39th:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jonthan&#39;s Provocation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brass, not required<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Effect: Target: Haste, STR, ATK, Absorb Damage Shield<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 45th:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Solon&#39;s Bewitching Bravura<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wind, required<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Effect: Charm!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
