I had trouble with charm at<br/>\nfirst and now at 35 it works pretty good for me. Also, it took me some time<br/>\nto learn how.  Also, I bought a crude stein +15 cha that I equip for serious<br/>\ncharm sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHot Keys:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - charm<br/>\n2 - /pet attack<br/>\n3 - /pet guard here<br/>\n4 - /pet back off<br/>\n5 (i use for some thing else)<br/>\n6 - /pet guard me (i think - not that important)<br/>\n<br/>\nSay your puller brings 2 or 3 mobs and you have crowd control duty (ie no<br/>\nenchanter)<br/>\n<br/>\nProcess (and this was learned from someone else&#39;s great post here)<br/>\n<br/>\nTarget mob you want to charm (pick the lower con)<br/>\ncharm<br/>\ntarget mob you want it to fight<br/>\npet attack <br/>\nF1 F1 (re-target pet and back out of melee)<br/>\n/g DREAD IS CHARM! (meaning the dread wolf who came with the rotting knight)<br/>\n(important to tell group unless they are well disciplined at /assist)<br/>\nre-charm (when he breaks loose - which will be about now on the first round)<br/>\n(pet will run to u when charm breaks but when you recharm he runs back to<br/>\nfite other mob -- if former pet hits you - back further away)<br/>\nre-charm (now you can get a feel for when to re-charm and try to get him<br/>\nbefore he breaks back to you)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s about it really.  Keys are stay back so you have time to re-charm<br/>\nbefore getting hit. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe pet guard here is for making an escape.  Charm, pet guard here, then<br/>\nrun.  Do not re-charm because it will make pet come to you if it is not agro<br/>\non something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the wide open spaces, try this.  Charm a pet you want to die while being<br/>\npet (greenie who dont give u xp), run, find a mob you want to kill for xp.<br/>\nRun to it so it attacks you. Charm pet u still have chasing you.  Pet will<br/>\nby default be in guard you mode and attack your attacker.  Kite the mob<br/>\nuntil it turn on pet. Charm and recharm the pet along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: JasonF [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 11, 1999 11:46 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Eqbards@...\">Eqbards@...</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Charming Methods<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;JasonF&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JasonF@...\">JasonF@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI need some assistance with Charm.  I&#39;ve had this song for several levels<br/>\nnow and just simply can&#39;t figure out the proper method of using it.  I see<br/>\nmessages from some of the talented bards on this list saying &quot;Yeah, two Hill<br/>\nGiants, no biggie.  I just charmed them against one another and got both<br/>\nkills.&quot;  I would be dead or zonign within 15 rounds if I tried this.  At<br/>\nlevel 31 HGs are still red to me, so let&#39;s take the Choon and Froon brothers<br/>\nas examples because they&#39;re blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how I think it should work (remember, my base INT is only 75):<br/>\n<br/>\n- Set up a hotkey panel with Selo&#39;s, Charm, &quot;/pet attack&quot;, &quot;/pet back off&quot;.<br/>\n- Equip drum and fire up Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n- Sneak up to the bros and Charm one.<br/>\n- Assuming Charm sticks, the other will probably immediately attack it due<br/>\nto its inheriting my factions, but if not, click on the other brother and<br/>\nhit &quot;/pet attack&quot; hotkey.<br/>\n- Click on original charmee.<br/>\n- Start Selo&#39;s.<br/>\n- Watch ensuing battle.<br/>\n- When Charm breaks and brother runs toward me, hit Charm again.<br/>\n- Assuming Charm sticks, the charmee *should* return to previous &quot;/pet<br/>\nattack&quot; status.<br/>\n- Repeat until one is dead.<br/>\n- Once one is dead, the problem shifts to a kite or chain/fear issue to<br/>\nfinish survivor off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried this.  Hell I can&#39;t even make this work with Orc Centurians in<br/>\nEast Commonlands.  Either I totally misunderstand something or I&#39;m just not<br/>\ncoordinated to pull it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrier<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:toren@...\">toren@...</a> with<br/>\nthe subject lol.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
