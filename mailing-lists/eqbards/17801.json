The Orc you left alive went and told all<br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; friends about you and your group (mobs will spread agro when near each<br/>\n&gt; other).  As other players killed the orcs you got faction hits for still<br/>\n&gt; being on their hate list.  If a orc got close enough to you to directly<br/>\nagro<br/>\n&gt; (when you are on a mobs hate list the re-agro range is huge) they would<br/>\nhead<br/>\n&gt; for you, in-route they must have gotten stuck on a tree or from lag they<br/>\n&gt; appeared to teleport into the middle of you.  They were teleporting up<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; Kelethin as a anti-exploit measure that keeps casters from blasting<br/>\ncritters<br/>\n&gt; from a high places with no fear of retaliation.  The only way to clear the<br/>\n&gt; agro is to zone/camp/die, till then the agro will keep spreading.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This happens in the planes all the time, and I had it happen once in lower<br/>\n<br/>\nI had it happen to me twice long long ago in Oasis.  Was about<br/>\nL15 then, and thinking back on it, we must&#39;ve let an orc run<br/>\naway.  It was still aggroed to us, but outside the range where<br/>\nit would come chase us.  It aggroed other orcs, who do what<br/>\nthey normally do (pace back and forth).  As they got near the<br/>\ntop of the far hill, they&#39;d enter the chase-aggro range and<br/>\ncome running to us.  We couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on<br/>\nbecause all these orcs kept running over the far hill for us<br/>\nnonstop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this was happening at the orc lift, it&#39;s likely you never<br/>\nsaw the orcs running towards you because of the Z-axis<br/>\nlimitation (you&#39;ll notice players/mobs at a different height<br/>\ndisappear from view a lot sooner than when you&#39;re just far<br/>\naway).  When they attacked, it forced a client update, and<br/>\nthey appeared to pop on top of you.  And like Rokenn said,<br/>\nbecause one had transferred its aggro to all the other orcs,<br/>\nyou got faction hits for all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
