It&#39;ll be fun to test!<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n*Pauses in Socials*<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause <br/>\ntakes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number <br/>\nof tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, a social consisting of:<br/>\n<br/>\n/sit off<br/>\n/cast 1<br/>\n/pause 100<br/>\n/sit on<br/>\n<br/>\n...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds <br/>\nafter you&#39;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as <br/>\nanother social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the <br/>\npause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the <br/>\nsame line.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:<br/>\n<br/>\n/sit off<br/>\n/pause 100,/cast 1<br/>\n/sit on<br/>\n<br/>\n...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to <br/>\nnote that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from <br/>\nanother, and MUST be specified first on the line.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
