The zones themselves","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1517140623\">Well, in the case of BB and CB I personally don&#39;t think that being able to<br/>\nbind is what causes those zones to be bursting at the seams.  The zones<br/>\nthemselves are VERY close to major cities and very easy to get to.  CB is<br/>\nextremely simple to run to from Kelethin in a minute or less and the major<br/>\nhassle getting from Qeynos to BB is waiting to zone into the from North<br/>\nQeynos into the Hills...but even that trip takes maybe 3 minutes or so tops.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than this reason I can&#39;t imagine what the allure of BB is for so many<br/>\npeople for so long, and even I am not guilty.  I spent levels 5-8 in BB<br/>\nbefore I decided to brave the cross country trip from my starting city of<br/>\nQeynos and other than hunting lions in the Karanas for pelts to make<br/>\npatchwork armor, BB is just about all I did, Gnoll after Gnoll, day after<br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what is the best loot in BB?  A +3STR spiked collar that you can only<br/>\nget off the elites, which you can&#39;t really kill until you are in your teens?<br/>\nHmm, or is it the +2AGI onyx earring?  I dunno, unless I am mistaken that<br/>\ndungeon doesn&#39;t even have any lore items.  Strange...but many many people<br/>\nfrom the west side of Antonica grow up in BB just like players who start on<br/>\nFaydwer grow up in CB.  They are places where one can remain challenged for<br/>\nmany levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that BB could have its own terrorizing D&#39;Vinn type character, but<br/>\none of the things about that place is the size and frequency of the trains.<br/>\nDo all dungeons have huge trains on a regular basis like this?  I have been<br/>\nannihilated by trains in Runnyeye, Guk, CB, and BB - the only dungeon I have<br/>\nnot seen a big train in so far is Unrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nE&#39;ci Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 14, 1999 1:16 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] NPC&#39;s Binding<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:silky@...\">silky@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I don&#39;t particularly want my bard to be able to bind - <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t mind<br/>\n&gt; finding or waiting for a caster - my problem is WHERE <br/>\n&gt; noncasters can be bound.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As someone pointed out earlier - it tends to make folks much <br/>\n&gt; less likely to<br/>\n&gt; explore the world - course he was happy bout that - only 10 <br/>\n&gt; folks in his<br/>\n&gt; dungeon whereas places like BB and CB are bursting at the seams.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you really want folks to get out an explore, you don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; penalize them<br/>\n&gt; with half hour - hour - sometimes longer &#39;downtime&#39;, just to <br/>\n&gt; get back to<br/>\n&gt; their corpse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 08:16 PM 7/13/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;J.M.

You don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;want to know how ugly it got when the idea of the casters <br/>\n&gt; being able to self<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bind anywhere besides in an adventure zone came up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So, I wouldn&#39;t ever expect any of the hybrid classes to be <br/>\n&gt; able to bind.  It<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is not going to happen, it&#39;s something of a concession that <br/>\n&gt; bind even works<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the way it does now.  The idea of inns or static NPC&#39;s that <br/>\n&gt; could bind was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kicked around back in beta, and rejected.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is akin to the exp loss reductions that have twice <br/>\n&gt; occurred, once in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Beta, and once again in Final.  Both times, there was a very <br/>\n&gt; strong negative<br/>\n&gt; &gt;reaction from many members of the development team, a schism <br/>\n&gt; if you will.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But in the name of  the holy grail of &quot;playability&quot;, the <br/>\n&gt; experience loss<br/>\n&gt; &gt;reductions were implemented.   This was partially offset by <br/>\n&gt; the increased<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experience needed for levels after 25th implemented a few <br/>\n&gt; weeks earlier (but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;much too late imho, the damage was done)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In the case of experience loss, the changes were made to <br/>\n&gt; help out the game&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;actual market.  The mass market, RPG newcomer.   The game is <br/>\n&gt; complex by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;design, lightly documented by design, and often daunting, <br/>\n&gt; and far too many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;folks bypass the built in training curve via various <br/>\n&gt; methods, leaving them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;at moderately high levels with very deficient play skills <br/>\n&gt; (and character<br/>\n&gt; &gt;skills).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Those folks tended to die a lot more often than was <br/>\n&gt; necessary all of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sudden, and watching that exp bar keep dropping was pretty <br/>\n&gt; discouraging,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;especially when you didn&#39;t learn from your mistakes.  And <br/>\n&gt; there are the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;inevitable bugs and zone crashes that were fairly common <br/>\n&gt; early in retail and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;still persist.  After a bit of this, people start to  vote <br/>\n&gt; with their feet.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And since the bulk of the player base fell into this <br/>\n&gt; category in one way or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;another, from a business standpoint it was suicidal to stand <br/>\n&gt; by design<br/>\n&gt; &gt;principles in this case.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With the success of EQ, I&#39;m hoping the existing player base <br/>\n&gt; will in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;future be educated enough about RPGs in general, and Verant quirks in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;specific, so that when EQ2 rolls out, the bar can be raised <br/>\n&gt; in terms of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experience and rate of progression/regression.  Hitting the <br/>\n&gt; level cap in 45<br/>\n&gt; &gt;days is appalling to me.  Hitting it in 120 days, no matter <br/>\n&gt; how dedicated a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;player you are, still makes me twitch and drool some.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In the case of Bind Affinity, there&#39;s more than enough bind <br/>\n&gt; capable players<br/>\n&gt; &gt;online on any server at any time to accommodate player <br/>\n&gt; needs.  The only time<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this is not the case is when a fresh server comes online, <br/>\n&gt; and the race to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;12th or 14th level is on, and those few casters that reach <br/>\n&gt; it first are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heavily in demand..but only for a matter of days or even hours.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is still a strong balancing factor.  Synergy.  Interaction.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Now, you ask, why did I compare the experience loss changes <br/>\n&gt; to giving Bind<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Affinity to everyone, either by spell or by NPC&#39;s?  Well, <br/>\n&gt; both rank right up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there as the most requested changes to the game.  One <br/>\n&gt; happened, one won&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Snicker Furfoot, Esq. &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 6:04 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [eqbards] NPC&#39;s Binding<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;Snicker Furfoot, Esq.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snicker@...\">snicker@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; At 02:51 PM 7/13/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scott@...\">scott@...</a> (scott brisko)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What I would like to see is an NPC that could bind for a <br/>\n&gt; fee, and limit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;class based binding to one of a few classes. The <br/>\n&gt; advantage that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;class/es<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;would have is the ability to bind themselves away from a <br/>\n&gt; city, which is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;nice limit for the NPC&#39;s. Make sense to me if you want to <br/>\n&gt; foster a sense<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;being able to explore the world safely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually, that would make a heckuva lot of sense. J.M., <br/>\n&gt; mebbe you could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; suggest this idea:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Inn-running NPC&#39;s could, when given the proper coin, cast <br/>\n&gt; a &quot;bind&quot; spell<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a player. To determine the cost, hail the Innkeeper, and <br/>\n&gt; ask the cost for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; night.  It would make sense, RP-wise, and if you made it <br/>\n&gt; cost, say 1 plat,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; players could still undercut the merchants, but other <br/>\n&gt; players wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; SOL.  This would still encourage players to work together <br/>\n&gt; to get bound in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; certain areas (not every zone has an Inn, most Inns are <br/>\n&gt; inconvenient at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; best. Certain Inns have associated hazards...), but allow <br/>\n&gt; travelers to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; safer traveling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Comments?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Still bound to Kelethin after all these years *grin*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Congratulations MilitaryEFM.
