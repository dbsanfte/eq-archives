I <br/>\n&gt;      personally felt that the attack speed buff we provided from anthem, <br/>\n&gt;      celerity etc should be one of our main attractions.  Since the <br/>\n&gt;      enchanter buffs are better this is no longer the case.  (  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I dunno why that&#39;d be.  The quickness and alacrity spells are<br/>\nfaster than Anthem, true, but they don&#39;t have any stat buffs<br/>\nassociated with them.  Do not underestimate the importance of<br/>\nstr/dex buffs.  At low levels it&#39;s not very apparent, but when<br/>\nyou have a +18 str buff and are past level 20, the effect is<br/>\nobvious - you will be hitting for max or near max damage more<br/>\nfrequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuickness is also short duration, good for one battle.  I<br/>\nseriously doubt any enchanter is going to be casting it on 3<br/>\nor 4 tanks every fight since it costs 80 mana (one of their<br/>\nmost expensive spells to that point).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      SO... replace one the of late teens/early twenties songs with a toned <br/>\n&gt;      downed version of the 32 level mana song.  Maybe half as effective as <br/>\n&gt;      the 32 level song.  This would definitely solve the, what good are <br/>\n&gt;      bards for, problem between about 15th and 32 level.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bear in mind that at higher levels, it takes longer to<br/>\nregenerate mana and hp because you simply have more of them.<br/>\nClarity helps offset this and puts you back at the lower level<br/>\nmeditation/heal times.  Verant may consider it unbalancing to<br/>\nprovide mana regeneration at an earlier level.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
