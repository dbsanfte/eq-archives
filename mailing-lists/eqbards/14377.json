ER == Elemental<br/>\nRythmns?  Was thinking &quot;oh, good maybe I can melee and have huge MR now if<br/>\nsinging this is better than ER and drums...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after I get Aura (its Aria is it not?) memmed I realize it&#39;s not MR buff<br/>\nsong but the target Cancel Magic debuff.  So, I decided to play with it a<br/>\nbit anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike the other debuffs(cancel magic, pilliage enchantment), it agros the<br/>\ntarget now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI attacked some greens in Lavastorm and it seemed to remove their damage<br/>\nshields.  Should try it on some stronger mobs though.  Also, would be<br/>\ninteresting to try it on Dragoons.  I wonder how they get their insane MR -<br/>\ndo they all have runed bone forks?  Or do they have a spell buff on them?<br/>\nProlly just insanely high base stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 03, 2000 2:37 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Patch Message<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 3 Feb 2000, Rokenn Swiftsong wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *Songs*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Syvelian&#39;s Anti-magic Aura: Potency increased.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whee, a reason to use it instead of ER. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
