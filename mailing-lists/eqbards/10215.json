Druid regen must be cast before Hymn of <br/>\nRestoration is used or it will not take hold. Another one that you high <br/>\nlevel ppl might or might not know about - Lvl 48 DoT will cause a shaman or <br/>\nenchanter Yawn Mob spell to not stick while it is in effect(I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat these spells are called, I just say YAWN!) But I have no problem <br/>\ngetting the DoT to stick after they have Yawned the mob. Shaman friend of <br/>\nmine claims he cannot use quickness on me when my speed songs are in effect, <br/>\nbut an enchanter friend has never complained about that (haven&#39;t formally <br/>\ntested it). It&#39;s kinda hard to tell in real-time if all the haste effects <br/>\nare stacking when you wear a sash, use bard speed attack songs, and have a <br/>\nquickness type spell on ya (well it is for me). John? =) The icons show <br/>\nstacked at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would assume that if Chords of Cessation&#39;s slowing effect is messing up a <br/>\nshaman&#39;s Yawn, the lvl 20 chords of melodic binding song may do the same? <br/>\nAgain, haven&#39;t tested it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad &lt;The Companions&gt;<br/>\nBard of Kelethin of the 50th Chorus<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kimes, Dean W.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Dean_Kimes@...\">Dean_Kimes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: [eqbards] Clarity<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 16 Nov 1999 17:07:26 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I highly suspect this is a bug related to the code that prevents bards from<br/>\n&gt;being affected by any mana regeneration boosters.  Because the bard isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;affected when another bard&#39;s song pulses it doesn&#39;t detect a stacking<br/>\n&gt;problem because the bard doesn&#39;t have the effect on him.<br/>\n&gt;Another interesting stacking issue I discovered.  The yaulp proc&#39;d by the<br/>\n&gt;screaming mace stacks with Warsong, but not with Anthem, except: If the<br/>\n&gt;Screaming Mace procs before the anthem you get both effects.  If it procs<br/>\n&gt;after Anthem is already up you get the your &quot;spell did not take effect&quot;<br/>\n&gt;message and the Yaulp does not stick.  I thought that was odd as it was the<br/>\n&gt;only order related stacking I had ever encountered.<br/>\n&gt;That led me to question some of the apparent Hymn stacking we considered<br/>\n&gt;long ago.  If a bard&#39;s song only checks on the opposing bard for stacking<br/>\n&gt;which seems to be true, could two bards in the same group stand outside <br/>\n&gt;each<br/>\n&gt;other&#39;s area of effect but both having and intermediary person inside both<br/>\n&gt;their areas of effect.  If they did would the person in both areas be <br/>\n&gt;healed<br/>\n&gt;doubly?  Something to check.  I know for sure that while I cannot play Hymn<br/>\n&gt;if a higher level bard is, if I walk away from his area of effect I can <br/>\n&gt;play<br/>\n&gt;it even though we are in the same group.  Something for someone with good<br/>\n&gt;analysis techniques like John (tm) to check.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tKitasi<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
