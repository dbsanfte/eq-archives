I&#39;m a 22d level bard with my Wind skill maxed out.  I started<br/>\nsinging the invisibility song and walked throughout Unrest conning<br/>\neverything I saw.  In the yard, death beetles, jack-o-lanterns, and<br/>\ntormented dead all conned indifferently to me.  Didn&#39;t get the chance to try<br/>\nit against a greater skeleton though so don&#39;t know about them.  I can kill<br/>\nthem easily so not too concerned about them.  Inside on the 1st floor, every<br/>\nghoul I ran into conned indifferent.  I walked by a lesser mummy and it<br/>\nattacked me so they are the first thing that saw through the invisibility.<br/>\nCarrion ghouls conned ready to attack.  Didn&#39;t get the chance to test it<br/>\nagainst dark and dry bone skeletons, werebats, or anything tougher.  If<br/>\nanyone has confirmed successes against the tougher creatures then please<br/>\npost it.  Specifically, if someone higher than 22d level can confirm that<br/>\nthe invisibility song works against carrion ghouls for them that would give<br/>\ncredence to the theory that the higher level you are has a direct<br/>\ncorrelation on what mobs can see through the invisibility song.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tChris Kuenster (Entex) [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, August 26, 1999 6:08 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRE: [eqbards] Re: Mid-level songs<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Chris Kuenster (Entex)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:v-ntxck@...\">v-ntxck@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mobs do change levels and acquire new skills if they raise high enough.<br/>\n&gt; Also<br/>\n&gt; it may have had spirit sight cast on it by another nearby mob. Aside from<br/>\n&gt; this I know some Undead see invis just fine whil others not at all. I have<br/>\n&gt; had Festering hags not see me if they are green to me, and then a blue one<br/>\n&gt; sees me and scowls. I have walked all the way into the ghost room<br/>\n&gt; unmolested<br/>\n&gt; and other times a greater skel or hag will see me. In lower guk all the<br/>\n&gt; ghouls see invis just fine, while in upper all that can see me is the<br/>\n&gt; Warden<br/>\n&gt; and the Lord. I never trust past experience with invis in any area I dont<br/>\n&gt; know as gospel. Unrest is one of those places you never know whats going<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; happen next, I dont care how long you have played there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Kim [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 26, 1999 8:48 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eqbards] Re: Mid-level songs<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 26 Aug 1999, Talies the Wanderer wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 08:23 PM 8/25/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Almost every time I think something saw through my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;invisibility, I scroll back and the message immediately before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I was attacked is &quot;you become visible.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hrm - there has always been some error with the cause and effect timing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Notice how whenever you are bashed, your song ends *before* the monster<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bashes you?
