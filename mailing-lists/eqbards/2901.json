I was TOLD that they are on<br/>\n&gt;someone named &quot;The Warden&quot;, who is supposedly the Warden of the jail cells<br/>\n&gt;in Upper Gukk. My group camped there for QUITE a long time this evening and<br/>\n&gt;never saw him once. Does anyone know exaclty where he spawns? Is there some<br/>\n&gt;sort of trigger? We kept seeing Knights and Warriors, but never a Warden.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are ALSO looking for the trollhide belt. Again, I was told this SAME<br/>\n&gt;invidual bears it. Is this true? If not, who has it, and where?
