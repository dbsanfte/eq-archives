If you don&#39;t learn the lessons of what the<br/>\n&gt;class can and can&#39;t do between levels 1-5, you&#39;re going to<br/>\n&gt;learn them between levels 6-10, when you get experience loss<br/>\n&gt;for the deaths accompanying those learning experiences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For the twinker this is usually not a problem because the<br/>\n&gt;twinking accelerates his level progression more than the<br/>\n&gt;experience loss hurts.  For the folks grouped with him though,<br/>\n&gt;this can be another matter, as they end up grouped with a<br/>\n&gt;player who either does not know how to play the class to best<br/>\n&gt;advantage (e.g. bards doing nothing but bellowing during a<br/>\n&gt;fight, then healing after), or gets them into situations<br/>\n&gt;likely to get them killed because hey if one of them is a<br/>\n&gt;close match for me, three of them should be no problem for my<br/>\n&gt;group of six.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
