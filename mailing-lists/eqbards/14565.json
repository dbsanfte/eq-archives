I got lucky and won the roll (around 10 people rolled for the<br/>\nitem).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The warrior pulled a<br/>\n&gt; fierce impaler (rare spawn near the zone)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Thanks largely to the cleric&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Retributions, we were able to kill the fierce impaler.<br/>\n&gt; I am now the proud owner of a Gloomwater<br/>\n&gt; harpoon (piercer, 9/31 +4STR, +25HP, only 3lbs), far and away the best<br/>\nweapon<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve ever had.<br/>\n&gt; So this weekend in Kedge I was the luckiest bard on E&#39;ci. I was the only<br/>\nperson<br/>\n&gt; in the raid who died(twice) but I came out of the raid with two weapons<br/>\nbetter<br/>\n&gt; than the ones I went in with. Two deaths:two great weapons...poetic<br/>\njustice,<br/>\n&gt; kizmet, coincidence or whatever, I&#39;ll take it :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you are a 32+ bard and want to try something new, I strongly encourage<br/>\nyou to<br/>\n&gt; give Kedge a try.  Your presense will be greatly appreciated.  Its one<br/>\nhelluva<br/>\n&gt; zone as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; 34 bard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PS I made 34th level while in Kedge as well.  That was icing on the<br/>\ncake:-) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
