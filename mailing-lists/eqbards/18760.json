I think in your original post you mentioned finding a guild that<br/>\nsuits you - best idea yet!  Last night, I saw a guild named &quot;Miraculous<br/>\nMusicians&quot; (sp?) something close and 5 of them put on a &#39;concert&#39; in<br/>\nKelethin.  (Some names were:  Yeza, Ghent, Muffin, Forte - so look for them<br/>\nif you want an &quot;all bard&quot; type guild.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things on guilds.  I was in Spirit of the Moon as my first guild.<br/>\nTheir focus was on role playing and having fun.  I found myself to be<br/>\nleveling at a faster pace than most of them in my level range (they had some<br/>\nfolks above me moving pretty fast but no where I could effectively group<br/>\nwith them.)  At any rate, after a few weeks of not being able to get guild<br/>\ngroups at the times and frequency that I play, I had to make a change.  It<br/>\nwas an extremely hard thing to do and I took the time to personally speak<br/>\nwith as many of my Moonie brothers and sisters as I could.  I think that<br/>\nhelped alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, my new guild &lt;The Pantheon&gt; has some really great folks<br/>\nin it and the 3 people who were my regular group for levels 10 thru 35.  So<br/>\nI am very happy now.  One key thing is that we are all able to play<br/>\ntogether.  Close enough in level and play every night.  We have about 50-60<br/>\nactive members and only 6 or so are not &#39;planar&#39; (level 46+).  Most are<br/>\n51-52 now and I think a few are 53.  We added folks by grouping with them on<br/>\na regular basis in difficult places (planes, dragons, more planes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key is finding folks you like, who play when and as much as you do and<br/>\ndo the things you like to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and gimme a /tell when you are online.  I play quite a bit and<br/>\nsome odd hours too &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly SongSynger<br/>\nBardette of 51 songs<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nsomewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Miriana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:miriana@...\">miriana@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 15, 2000 12:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Innoruuk stuff (was Race to 60)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 15 May 2000, Kenneth E.

EV/LA get<br/>\n&gt; included in my book simply because EV used to be up there with the other<br/>\n&gt; big guilds, and have been around much longer than OBS, Storm, or Unbidden.<br/>\n&gt; But, if you just count number of people, including EV would include a<br/>\n&gt; whole new tier of guilds (a la Justifiers, Technique)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OBS has about 140 not counting twinks.  I think the others are in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ballpark.  LoD is considered the &quot;uber-guild&quot; of the server, for what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s worth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; LoD has 50 active members or so.  We&#39;re actually one of the smaller<br/>\n&gt; guilds.  And for what it&#39;s worth, we haven&#39;t considered ourselves the<br/>\n&gt; uberguild on the server for quite some time. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
