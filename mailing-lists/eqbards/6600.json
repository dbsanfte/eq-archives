For example, in Fear, the players<br/>\nmagic resist rate gets periodically checked to see if they become scared.<br/>\nCould be at anytime, in combat or while they are sitting around.  If so,<br/>\nthey start fleeing in a random direction.  In Hate, make it where a player<br/>\ncan, if they fail their resist, become consumed by irrational hate and start<br/>\nattacking anything nearby, monsters or players.  In Fire, players are hit by<br/>\nconstant heat that affects health and/or stamina.  In Air, constant gales<br/>\nthat cause damage.  I came up with these on the fly so I&#39;m sure there are<br/>\nother things that could be done similar to these.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is a problem I will have to worry about for another year<br/>\nor so.

I feel for<br/>\n&gt; those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who were slaughtered, but I think we should all be afraid to go there.<br/>\n&gt; It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t be hopeless, but it should be feared, not merely viewed as a<br/>\n&gt; new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; place to get xp and cool items.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Umm. Do you somehow get the idea it&#39;s not currently hopeless? If you<br/>\n&gt; want a real plane of fear that works like the current one but is a bit<br/>\n&gt; cheaper on system resources they should just make a gate that kills you<br/>\n&gt; and deletes your body when you use it. We currently have the same basic<br/>\n&gt; effect. There&#39;s a big difference between really scarey and unplayable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
