No Bards.  And even with six bards in the guild level 45 and up, <br/>\n&gt;we&#39;re having a hard time arguing<br/>\n&gt;the point.  We&#39;re *supposed* to be the most powerful *grouping* class in <br/>\n&gt;the game, but our songs have been<br/>\n&gt;nerfed to the point where, even in a *full* group, someone else does it <br/>\n&gt;better.  Have you seen the<br/>\n&gt;discussions on other boards where people are asked to list their ideal <br/>\n&gt;parties, or the player type they<br/>\n&gt;would choose to group with first?  If we&#39;re the best grouping class, we <br/>\n&gt;should be way up on those lists,<br/>\n&gt;shouldn&#39;t we?
