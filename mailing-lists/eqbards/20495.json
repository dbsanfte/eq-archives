I have played several <br/>\ncharacters at that level there.  Just north of the caves by the giant <br/>\ngears, there are several skeletons.  I&#39;ve often played ring around <br/>\nthe skellies there, going from one skeleton to the next, with a mino <br/>\nslaver pull in between (during levels 12-13).  It&#39;s a constant stream <br/>\nof exp.  The loot from the skeletons isn&#39;t bad either.  Almost always <br/>\nsome silver, occasionally gold, chips, and more rarely cloth or <br/>\nleather items.  When you rest, climb high into the hills so a <br/>\nwandering lord or hero doesn&#39;t find you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother fun place is the Nybright sisters camp in Lesser Faydark, <br/>\nnear loc -800, +2500 (I think).  If you gather a dull pearl necklace <br/>\nfrom each sister and give it to the drunkard in kelethin, you get <br/>\nmore exp and some item that sells for around 1pp.  The sisters drop a <br/>\nlot of rusties and the occasional bronze weapon.  I would go over <br/>\nthere whenever I was getting bored in Steamfont.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdagia, Wood Elf Bard of 13 Rythms, Druzzil Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
