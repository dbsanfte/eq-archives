They are a comprehensive list of many of &gt;the weapons in everquest (There are currently over 200 weapons on this list). The chart sorts the &gt;weaponary by it&#39;s damage to delay ratio (Actually it uses the formula {[Damage*2]+1}/Delay   This is &gt;the damage that a weapon generates up until about level 20 or so, when Level and Strength bonuses &gt;start to show.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Ok, I still don&#39;t understand why I seem to be the only one that is<br/>\nnoticing what is wrong with the damned formula for weapon<br/>\nefficiency used just about everywhere. That max damage / delay.<br/>\nYou don&#39;t do max damage with a weapon.. you do _average_<br/>\ndamage. Yes dex and str and skill will make it closer to max<br/>\nmore often, but on those battles where damage efficiency<br/>\nreally counts as anything (meaning a tough foe, if its a real wimp<br/>\nwho cares what you wield, you sing back more health probably<br/>\nthan what it can do to you) you are doing really rarely max damage.<br/>\nNow change the formula to damage+1 / delay and it represents<br/>\nthe average damage. And better yet to ease it out, do the reverse<br/>\ncalculation of delay/dmg+1 and it is way easier to check efficiencies<br/>\nin your head without a calculator ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  And also, I don&#39;t get it why the staff at Verant themselves<br/>\n(JM Cap-whatitwas posted that nice weapon damage evaluation)<br/>\nhave not tried to use any other than damage/delay formula to<br/>\nevaluate weapon efficiency. I mean they have had proof from those<br/>\nsimulations they ran and all that faster weapons are more efficient<br/>\nif they have same dmg/delay ratio. And why the bigger weapons<br/>\nseem to outdo faster ones at real short under 30 second battles,<br/>\nwell I doubt they do if you calculate the damage they do using<br/>\na time frame of 0.1seconds less than x number of strikes from<br/>\nthe slow weapon. So 19.9seconds with 5/20 weapon will do<br/>\n9 hits compared to the 4 a 10/40 weapon gets. Further analysis<br/>\nwould show that big weapons are better if the time used is short,<br/>\nand somewhat longer than x times delay. But then when it gets<br/>\nmaybe about x times delay + delay/2 the faster will pick up again<br/>\nwhen it gets its hits in that it needs to have used the same overall<br/>\ntime. And any longer period of time as proven by the simulations, the faster<br/>\nwill be better and the slower won&#39;t gain any big jumps anymore<br/>\nin damage when it gets it chance to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok I rambled. But this is somewhat on topic, because bards and<br/>\ndual wield and the speed songs are all in favor of fast weapons<br/>\nin my opinion. And there is nothing more fun than seeing you hit<br/>\n4 times between the monsters hits =)<br/>\n<br/>\n    - Ilkka Salmenkaita, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:isalmen@...\">isalmen@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
