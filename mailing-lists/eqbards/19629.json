I deal Roulette and I can tell you <br/>\nthat on a legit wheel, I have seen the same number show up 3 times in <br/>\na row!  Yes, that is right, 1 number of 38 possibles, three times in <br/>\na row.  How&#39;s that for random?  Seen it happen twice.  As you can <br/>\nimagine, 2 in a row happens all the time.  And yes, have seen 10+ of <br/>\nsame colors.  I also deal Blackjack and one night, in a single deck <br/>\ndeal, after 5 shuffles and 1 cut, I dealt all 4 Aces in a row!  <br/>\nAmazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nSee how far off topic we are folks?
