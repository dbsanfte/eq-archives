Killing him does indeed make you faction with the<br/>\n&gt; Freeport Militia bad and yes you can be KOS, but there is an easy way for<br/>\n&gt; you to raise your faction with the people and militia of Freeport.  My<br/>\n&gt; friend was KOS for killing him in hopes of completing the Paladin Quest,<br/>\n&gt; he is not apprehensive.  I also know of Trolls that are amiable in the<br/>\n&gt; city.

The people are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all camping there waiting for him to spawn so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they can kill him. Apparently, the other guards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do not assist him. There is a minor faction hit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; associated with killing Krazen but I have seen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people camp for a week without becoming KOS.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Beware, this will make you KOS to the Freeport Militia.  They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are the guards in West and East Freeport.  The guards in North<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Freeport are all paladins (except Krazen) which is why you do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not become KOS to them.  This is actually part of a bigger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plot, in which the paladins and the militia are both fighting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for control of Freeport.  Nearly anything that raises your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; faction with the paladins lowers it with the militia, and vice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; versa.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually there is one way to raise your faction with the Freeport Militia<br/>\n&gt; without harming you faction with the paladins.  If you go into the tunnels<br/>\n&gt; beneath Freeport you will bump into a human standing beside a a dwarf.<br/>\n&gt; When you talk to the dwarf he will mention how much he misses Kaladim.  To<br/>\n&gt; alleviate his homesickness you give his human friend some dwarven ale and<br/>\n&gt; bang you improve your faction with the Freeport Militia.  BTW if the<br/>\n&gt; Freeport Militia hate you, the people of Freeport will hate you also.<br/>\n&gt; Except in North Freeport since the Paladins run that area.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Treilanin Loreweaver<br/>\n&gt; Honour Guard, Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\n&gt; Join our community member news update at<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
