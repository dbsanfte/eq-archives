Didn&#39;t get feared a single time, resisted most of the damage breaths.  Only problem with going at low levels is, no matter what your cr and mr are, vox will recognize that you&#39;re very low level and will go after you hard sometimes.  I got clawed about 5 times by her one time I was there...had a good cleric so I didn&#39;t die tho, think only one person in group did.<br/>\n<br/>\nErr...so, the point is, if a raid needs bards, you can get in at level 40, but you better have over 200 resists if you don&#39;t wanna die in the first 5 seconds.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Henrik Holm <br/>\n  To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 18, 2001 3:03 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [eqbards] Level for Vox raid?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah I think that sounds about right. I was 46th on my first and only vox<br/>\n  raid sofar. It was a disaster btw..<br/>\n  I have my own theory why the raid failed.<br/>\n  1. There was no minimum MR/CR demand<br/>\n  Thats it..<br/>\n  I myself was one of the people who did not realise just how important those<br/>\n  resists is. I was not clawed once. All damage I took was from breath and my<br/>\n  health dropped by 1/4 each time I dident resist! 4 unresisted breaths and I<br/>\n  was dead.<br/>\n  Mind you I played resist songs with my drum and had my buffed MR/CR well<br/>\n  above 100, but that was not enough.<br/>\n  Next raid I will only go if I can take my MR/CR (or HR if nafgen) to 100<br/>\n  unbuffed. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Musiker, bard o 47th songs, bertox (I better stop fooling around and get<br/>\n  leveling again, Windleaf is ahead of me :P *grin*)<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub9.ezboard.com/bcreatorspath\">http://pub9.ezboard.com/bcreatorspath</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=1598&sortby=character_name&\">http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=1598&sortby=character_name&</a><br/>\n  showroles=1<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: 18. maj 2001 08:46<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] Level for Vox raid?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all,<br/>\n  I hit 42nd lvl last week and am looking for a serious raiding guild on<br/>\n  Rodcet Nife.  I recently posted to one guild&#39;s website and got an answer<br/>\n  back that bards must be 45th lvl in order to be effective on a Vox raid.<br/>\n  Is this correct?
