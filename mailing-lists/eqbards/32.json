Accelerando, i keep this hotkeyed at all times, its the ultimate get out<br/>\nof death free card.also, with your drum , you are the fastest person in the<br/>\ngame, and gam go from qeynos to freeport in about 10 minutes real time :)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Hymn of Restoration , not really practical during a fight, but excellent<br/>\nat reducing your &quot;downtime&quot; or rest period between fights. also a wonder for<br/>\ncounteracting the effects of poison.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow - this is my favorite spell, bar none. why? it<br/>\ndoes 7dmg at lvl 12, my lvl 19 friend says his now does 11 per tick, and its<br/>\na targetted spell, unlike others, it will only affect the monster you target<br/>\n. others are area effect and are very dangerous because they will harm other<br/>\nmonsters . my favorite tactic with this is to attack a wisp, then run off<br/>\n(wisps are slow and you can outrun them without Accelerando) and while the<br/>\nwisp is chasing me, i am bellowing at it and its taking damage. This is not<br/>\nthe fastest way to kill a monster, but wisps are great XP and have nice loot<br/>\nas well, and its a relatively safe way to fight :)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Charismatic Carillon - i always play this whenever i buy or sell from<br/>\nNPCs, because i get better prices. this song pays for itself :)<br/>\n<br/>\nthats all i have for now, i&#39;ll post more as soon as i get some more levels<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kyar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
