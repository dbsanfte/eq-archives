The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-313216111\">DEX and CHA are checked to start a song. Each song has a difficulty%<br/>\nassociated with it. The higher your DEX+CHA is, the more you&#39;ll succeed at<br/>\nsinging. The higher your level is, the more you&#39;ll succeed also. Some songs<br/>\nare harder than others, but will become trivial (still 5% or so minimum<br/>\nfailure rate) with some more levels.<br/>\nFor combat DEX only affects the procs of weapons (and works like strentgh<br/>\nfor ranged weapons, ie. increases the damage dealt upon a successful hit,<br/>\nwhich we don&#39;t care much about).<br/>\nCHA is used to modify the succes rate of the mesmerize / charm and memory<br/>\nblur spells, and thus our songs.<br/>\nSo if you wanna be best at crowd control, raise CHA over DEX. If you wanna<br/>\ndeal more damage do the opposite and use procing weapons. Best bet is to<br/>\nhave 2 sets of equipment.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn the other stats now, namely STR, AGI and AC. The to hit % is ONLY skill<br/>\nbased (ie. depends on the your level and the MOB&#39;s, along with the<br/>\ndefense/offense/dodge/parry/riposte skills), with the exception of AC (which<br/>\nis also factored in that calculation). So raise AC to get hit less (you also<br/>\nneed to get your defensive skill maxed but I guess that each and every bard<br/>\nmaxes them pretty fast, ahem). STR will make the attacker hit for more upon<br/>\na successfull hit and AGI will lower the damage taken by the target. These<br/>\nare not worthless stats, though I think CHA / DEX and AC are 1st priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Message d&#39;origine-----<br/>\nDe: Weiland Spellsong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>]<br/>\nDate: jeudi 13 janvier 2000 23:38<br/>\n´┐¢: EQBards<br/>\nObjet: [eqbards] Disturbing thoughts.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Weiland Spellsong&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:given@...\">given@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nHail and well met everyone!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question today:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guildmates, namely 2 monks, 2 paladins, and our resident rogue have begun<br/>\nformulating a rather distressing theory of late.  They seem to all be of the<br/>\nopinion that the only real stats that matter are AC and STR (and agility for<br/>\nthe monks).  Now before anyone begins to think these people are soft in the<br/>\nhead, these are all very intelligent players.  The monks are 30 and 38<br/>\nrespectively, the paladins are 33 and 35, and the rogue (the guild&#39;s most<br/>\nvaluable asset by far) just chimed hell level one (30) last night.  Can<br/>\ntheir theory be right?  If so, I just spent the better part of 3 months<br/>\ngetting items for AGI and DEX, all the while sacrificing most of my STR gear<br/>\nand quite a bit of AC, for naught.  <br/>\n    <br/>\nFrom what this list has told me, CHA and DEX are our main attributes<br/>\ncorrect?  So what exactly does our AGI work towards?  And if DEX is so<br/>\nimportant in starting songs, then how do I still miss 2 notes per battle<br/>\nwith 130 DEX?  Should I ditch the AGI stuff and move back to STR and even<br/>\nmore CHA stuff?  Any input would be greatly appreciated!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
