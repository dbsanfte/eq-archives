Barbarian shield graphics","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1746868921\">I agree on the points you brought up Mike, but the graphics won&#39;t get<br/>\nchenged until they do an art patch, probably in the expansion.  Barbarian<br/>\nshield graphics have the same problem and fixing it would require patching a<br/>\nhuge file and making everyone patch in for about 45 minutes on a 56K line,<br/>\nlonger if slower.  I believe the graphics will get fixed, just don&#39;t think<br/>\nit can happen before the expansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf much greater concern is the SoW change.  Last nite on E&#39;ci druids, angry<br/>\nat losing their ridiculous ability to kite creatures that would slaughter<br/>\nsomeone 10 levels above them of any other class, were SoW&#39;ing every bard<br/>\ncoming out of Freeport.  I got hit and then 30 minutes later got hit again<br/>\nby another druid in W commons.  He even went so far as to laugh and say<br/>\n&#39;Outrun me now nerf-boy!&#39;  Talk about childish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing, although not specifically bard related except in that bards<br/>\nprobably do more quests than anyone else simply because they can, is the<br/>\nconstant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I went to the bank<br/>\nlast nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 containers from the bank<br/>\nbecause if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I would have to<br/>\ncarry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does Verant think the<br/>\nsolution to everything is to make an item no drop.  Bizzarely the Bozemite<br/>\nPestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the use for is now No<br/>\nDrop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires considerable<br/>\nfaction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go figure.  Why should I<br/>\nhave to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across Norrath to get the<br/>\nother piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put it in the bank<br/>\nwhile searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness it doesn&#39;t weigh<br/>\n10 lbs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi the questly nerfed<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 14, 1999 12:06 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] alt.games.everquest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Mike Roach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mroach@...\">mroach@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have just posted the following Usenet message on the alt.games.everquest<br/>\nboard that Brad says he browses, please agree or disagree, back me up, and<br/>\nhopefully I was not out of line in speaking for all of us:<br/>\n<br/>\nMyself and others who have regular discussions on the ONELIST bard&#39;s forum<br/>\nare concerned about the recent changes to SoW that is affecting our Selo&#39;s<br/>\nAccelerando.  It seems that once SoW is cast on us we are stuck with it and<br/>\nit overrides our Selo&#39;s, you can see how this can be a bad thing.  Please<br/>\ntry to work something out with this, my suggestion is that you allow the<br/>\nability for a player to cancel SoW if they choose just like you have done<br/>\nwith the Levitate spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also perplexed at the minotaur horn graphic turning into a burlap<br/>\nsack on our character&#39;s Avatar, is this intentional?  We have come to accept<br/>\nthat our drum looks like a flute and we blow on our brass horns backwards<br/>\nand hope that this will one day be addressed, but maybe insted of a burlap<br/>\nsack, you could change the graphic for the mino horn to look like the<br/>\ngraphic for the brass horn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that the bards in EQ comprise a very small percentage of the<br/>\noverall population but it is that fact along with the fact that we are not<br/>\ninclined toward overt rants and flames against Verant or any particular<br/>\nperson at Verant that causes us to often feel as though we are being<br/>\noverlooked.  I believe I understant that the Bard class was the last class<br/>\nto be developed before final release and as a result there were a lot of<br/>\nissues (such as the ones regarding how our instruments look and behave on<br/>\nour Avatars) that were left unfinished.  Granted, issues like this do not<br/>\naffect gameplay, they do make us feel like the stepchild class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI implore you to try to dedicate some of what I realize is already burdened<br/>\ndevelopment resources to addressing a number of these issues and providing<br/>\nus with at least a small amount of information on if and when you intend to<br/>\naddress the ones leftover from beta (like my flute drum and hari-kari brass<br/>\nhorn).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nFaras Tar&#39;Linedhel<br/>\nHalf-Elf Bard of the 26th song<br/>\nCrimson Legacy<br/>\nE&#39;ci Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nShow your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\nWith a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
