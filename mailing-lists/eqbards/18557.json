Not worth the<br/>\ntrouble.  The are in the 28-35 level range, see invis, cast and deal quite a<br/>\nbit of melee, they assist one another and the little Firionia Bixies will<br/>\ncome in at the last moment and KS you like the guards do.  Heck they agro on<br/>\nme at 50 and if I have to fight more than 2 I have to run, but I haven&#39;t<br/>\nworked out a method for fighting them because they don&#39;t give me experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend following the river that flows down to FV between the legs of<br/>\nthe giant Iksar statue up into the Lake of Ill Omen.  There&#39;s normally about<br/>\n25-40 people in that zone on Druzzil Ro in the 15-30 range fighting all<br/>\nkinds of creatures.  On Druzzil you can get pickup groups here.  The Swamp<br/>\nof No Hope also adjoins the FV zone, but this is the newbie Iksar zone and<br/>\nit&#39;s generally populated with lower level Iksars killing mosquitos and<br/>\nleeches and would be much harder to get a pickup group in.<br/>\n<br/>\n[50 Bard] Crier (Half Elf) &lt;Seekers of Norrath&gt; ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I just got to Kunark last night (had to finish some Lambent.<br/>\n&gt; Still can&#39;t get a group on the Rathe to<br/>\n&gt; do MM for Gloves or the Gypsy lute)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After a terrible time with the boat, I fell off the skiff.

Fironia Vie seemed to have a lot of<br/>\n&gt; black, yellow and red that could<br/>\n&gt; be charm fought. Or the Swamp of No hope and Warsilik Woods<br/>\n&gt; looked ok as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know frontier Mt.&#39;s is an option but that requires a group I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions will be much appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ranien Aeleroth<br/>\n&gt; Bard of the 27th song </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
