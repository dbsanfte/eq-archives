I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just got back to Freeport last night and need to test it at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 120.  So there&#39;s definitely some faction/race/diety component<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to all this.  The charisma song may be worthwhile in this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; regard (especially since half those damn stuck-up Erudite<br/>\n&gt; &gt; merchants won&#39;t sell to me).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing to note... the swashbuckler is very inconsistent in his prices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was in the market for a top of the line weapon, so I was considering<br/>\n&gt; buying a well-balanced longsword.  I went to the Swashbuckler, and he quoted<br/>\n&gt; me 250 plat and change.  I decided to think it over.  A couple of days<br/>\n&gt; later, I decided I&#39;d go for it, since nobody was selling barbed whips<br/>\n&gt; anymore.  When I showed up at the swashbuckler though, he was asking 280<br/>\n&gt; plat for the same sword!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At first, I thought I was just remembering the price of the sword<br/>\n&gt; incorrectly, but 280 was more than I wanted to pay, so I decided to forget<br/>\n&gt; about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Two days after THAT I found someone who was willing to sell me two barbed<br/>\n&gt; whips (finally).  I decided that the best place to meet was at the shady<br/>\n&gt; swashbuckler, as it was halfway between us.  While waiting for her, I took<br/>\n&gt; at look at his prices, and low and behold... the same longsword was now 230!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have no idea what drives the prices on this guy.  My charisma was the same<br/>\n&gt; in all three cases, and my faction stayed relatively consistent throughout.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jyzan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
