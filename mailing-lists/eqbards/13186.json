I still find it hard to understand the balance that comes from giving classes that can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1306664282\">This issue has been a bone of contention with me for a good while now.<br/>\nI still find it hard to understand the &quot;balance&quot; that comes from giving<br/>\nclasses that can SoW and/or gate (which would get them back to whatever zone<br/>\nthey died in that much faster) the ability to bind themselves anywhere while<br/>\nclasses that have no similar speed-up factors (except for bards) are forced<br/>\nto lumber there way (through up to three or four zones from the nearest bind<br/>\npoint) all the way back to their corpse.  Not only that, but when a caster<br/>\ncomes back from death, they have their primary weapons/defense with them...<br/>\ntheir spells and the mana that powers them.  Warriors, on the other hand are<br/>\nweaponless and armor-less until they loot their corpses.<br/>\n     One of the points that Brad & Co. love to constantly toss out is that<br/>\nif all folks were able to be bound in any zone, this would create an<br/>\nimbalance in the game where folks could fight something, get killed by it,<br/>\nrun right back to their corpses, loot, then kill whatever it was while it&#39;s<br/>\nhps are still low.<br/>\n     ...What!?!<br/>\n     Considering (especially at the higher levels, which is who they are<br/>\nafraid of doing this the most) the amount of experience one looses when they<br/>\ndie versus the amount you could get from any creature you could possibly do<br/>\nthis to, a person would loose MUCH more experience than they could gain.<br/>\nNot only that, but if this were able to happen, why don&#39;t you see newbs<br/>\ndoing this in the newb zones?  Sure, they take on things that could most<br/>\nlikely kill them with reckless abandon, but that is because the exp loss at<br/>\nthose levels is so low, not because of binding (the only time binding<br/>\nbecomes an issue at those levels is when said newb is far, far from their<br/>\nbind-point, and hasn&#39;t been re-bound).  At higher levels, having to run from<br/>\nzone-to-zone-to-zone is more of an annoyance than a deterrent to dieing.<br/>\nThe experience loss is the deterrent.<br/>\n     Another thing that I&#39;ve noticed lately is more and more posts from Brad<br/>\n& Co. wondoering how-oh-how they can get more folks to spread out into the<br/>\nless-crowded zones.  DUH!  Letting all classes be bound in all zones would<br/>\nbe one heckuva good starting spot.  Other ideas?  Faster MOB-spawns and more<br/>\nsolo-able MOBs for all levels in the farther out zones (how often do you<br/>\nfind the hermit in South Karana uncamped?)<br/>\n     Bah!  I could go on and on about this, but I have things to do ;o)~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=B=-<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, January 17, 2000 2:15 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Are we Hybrids?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mike.Langlois@...\">Mike.Langlois@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is a repost of something I posted to the GZ questions thread.<br/>\n&gt;I think we should be re-classed as casters, much like Shamans and Clerics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Comments?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Feel free to burn me at the stake for being a heretic, but some good<br/>\n </span></blockquote>logical<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;responses would be nice as well :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d like to pitch in my two coppers on the Binding Issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I understand that the Dev Team feels that the current bind status (Hybrids<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Melee classes don&#39;t get it) is unlikely to change and is well balanced.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;most part I agree.
