I <br/>\nlike reading about bard problems when they are objectively posted. John Kim <br/>\nalways provided an objective and quantified analysis of any problem. These <br/>\ntype of problems/complaints are constructive and helps build a case to get <br/>\nchanges made and make an effective squeaky wheel.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, all of the postings that takes shots at Verant as a company are <br/>\nthe writer&#39;s opinions, and as such are subject to other opinions.  Does it <br/>\ndo any good for people on this list to talk about how awful Verant is as a <br/>\ncompany?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;One other point to make.  Just because Kitasi (31st level) and I (39th<br/>\n&gt;level) are not high level bards doesn&#39;t mean we are not aware of all the<br/>\n&gt;problems higher level bards have to put up with.  Both Kitasi and I have<br/>\n&gt;been members of this mailing list since it was created.  Because I read this<br/>\n&gt;list as well as the Concert Hall board, I probably know more about the 50+<br/>\n&gt;bard songs than some of the 50+ bards on my server.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I definitely agree on this. Doesn&#39;t matter how high a level your bard is in <br/>\norder to form an opinion. However, any comments you&#39;d make on higher level <br/>\nsongs are invalid without you performing them yourself. Consequently, you <br/>\nnever hear me talk about any songs above 40+.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If you are content with<br/>\n&gt;primarily functioning as a mana battery, then you don&#39;t have anything to<br/>\n&gt;worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>BTW, the other night I ran into a 54 bard and a 55 bard and asked both of <br/>\nthem separately if they enjoyed playing their bards and whether they only <br/>\nsing manasong. Both said they loved playing them and thought that anyone <br/>\nwho only played manasong didn&#39;t know what a bard was for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;No need for you to get involved with any of the discussions on<br/>\n&gt;these issues.  For the other 99% of the bards out there who want full,<br/>\n&gt;working functionality out of the class, then there are still issues to<br/>\n&gt;discuss.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree there are definite issues to discuss. I just prefer to not have to <br/>\nread all the ranting and potshots. In that regard, I almost wonder if <br/>\nthat&#39;s why John Kim never returned. :-(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
