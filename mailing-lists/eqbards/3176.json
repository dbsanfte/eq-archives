A good place that I hunted from level 11-13 (Although in a group...) is North Karana. At level 13-14, you should be able to solo this area fairly well. Make sure you have a magical weapon, as Wisps are a common sight in the area. Avoid Hill Giants and Griff/awns/ons/ennes. If one of these locks on to you, you&#39;re better of running for a zone instead of the guards. I liked to hunt near the gypsy camp, as this is where I saw most of the wisps.<br/>\n<br/>\nLulen<br/>\nBard of the 13th Chorus<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tanthalias <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 19:28<br/>\n  Subject: [eqbards] Where to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just reached level 12, and now the things I used to hunt in Steamfront all con green. Where should I go from here? I could stay here and kill mino&#39;s, but they&#39;re too hard to find (camped most of the time). Where should I go from here? What&#39;s good for level 12?
