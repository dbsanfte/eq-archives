The ability, called ´┐¢Evade´┐¢,<br/>\nis tied to the ´┐¢Hide´┐¢ skill. It is used by targeting a creature and<br/>\npressing the ´┐¢Hide´┐¢ button. If it is successful, it will dramatically<br/>\nreduce how much the targeted creature hates the rogue. The Rogue will be<br/>\ngiven a message indicating success or failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis new ability is, for all intents and purposes, a reverse taunt, and<br/>\nwill help the grouped rogue shift the targeted creatures focus back to the<br/>\ntank after landing all of those hits. This is not like feign death, which<br/>\nmakes the creature forget you entirely, but rather just makes it hate you<br/>\nless. In addition, it only works against the targeted creature.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
