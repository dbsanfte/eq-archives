A lot more dmg too.<br/>\n&gt;So I think the secondary does not matter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your Friendly Rogue and Bard<br/>\n&gt;Hammerpaw and Syren Wind<br/>\n&gt;Champions of Norrath, The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: John Kim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Sat, 10 Jul 1999, Jason Rochelle wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Now let me get this straight.

Your primary<br/>\n&gt;swings all the time.  Every time the delay on the secondary<br/>\n&gt;expires, a dual wield check is made; if it passes, the<br/>\n&gt;secondary swings as well; if not, then another delay begins.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
