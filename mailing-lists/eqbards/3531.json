I have heard people like Shada talk about a purity belt.  What is it, how much is it, and where can I get one?  Also I was wondering, besides rubicite, is there another armor that has the very high AC and yet is light?  Is mesh an option for bards?  What exactly is mesh anyway?  I&#39;ve heard many Looking to buy&#39;s but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever actually noticed anyone wearing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my gripe of the day -- TWINKING HAS BECOME RAMPANT ON EROLLISI MARR!!!!!  I saw a lvl 5 bard yesterday walking through Freeport with a full suit of bronze plate.  That&#39;s just silly.  He said a friend gave it to him, nice gift. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, my real life brother-in-law just started about 3 days ago.  No sooner had his new character spawned at the Freeport gates than some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked if he wanted a 2H instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could tell him how to say thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.  I guess I&#39;m just bent because my bank account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly so there&#39;s no way I could buy plate or any other really cool items yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeiland the Extremely Poor Bard of Freeport<br/>\nErollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
