If R &gt; 1, you die.  If R &lt; 1, you win.<br/>\n<br/>\nR = (M/S)/(B/(D-H)) = M(D-H)/SB = MD/SB - MH/SB<br/>\n<br/>\nR&#39; = M(D-1.2H)/1.2SB = MD/1.2SB - MH/SB<br/>\n<br/>\nR&#39; = R - 0.167MD/SB<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the kill time to survival time curve is shifted down by an<br/>\namount -0.167MD/SB.  In other words, you can barely kill stuff<br/>\nthat&#39;s about 17% harder.  However the easier the stuff is to<br/>\nkill (the lower the tk/ts ratio), the proportionately better<br/>\noff you&#39;ll be, approaching infinitely better at 0.167MD/SB (at<br/>\nwhich point you lose no hp during the fight).  The healing<br/>\nbonus becomes a non-factor since the extra healing rate is<br/>\nexactly canceled out by the reduced time to kill a mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo against barely-killable mobs, the 7-string lute is 17% more<br/>\neffective.  But the more easily killed the mob is, the<br/>\n7-string lute becomes more and more effective, approaching<br/>\ninfinity (the point where your hp doesn&#39;t go down with a<br/>\n7-string lute, but you still lose hp with a normal lute).<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
