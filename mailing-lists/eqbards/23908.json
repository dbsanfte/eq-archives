(www.afterlifeguild.org) It<br/>\n&gt;demonstrates that post 50, all classes increase in power exponentially<br/>\n&gt;except for bards. The reason that all other classes scale that way is<br/>\n&gt;because of the way the mobs increase in power post 50. Bards however<br/>\n&gt;progress in power linearly. An argument can be made that we give some power<br/>\n&gt;for our wealth of abilities, but if you look at the very highest levels, we<br/>\n&gt;lose all of those additional abilities. Fear caps at 51, Charm caps at 53<br/>\n&gt;and Mez caps at 55. That means that a level 60 bard fighting level 55+ mobs<br/>\n&gt;is a liability to the party instead of an asset. We can no longer crowd<br/>\n&gt;control, our haste and slow is vastly inferior to enchanters and shamen, our<br/>\n&gt;melee is pathetic (to say the least).

Add to that the soft cap on resists<br/>\n&gt;and the fact that even with maxed resists many, many spells land anyway and<br/>\n&gt;bards have little to no use in a raid.
