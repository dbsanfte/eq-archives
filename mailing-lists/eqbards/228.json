I have been to websites that tell the names of them and where to get them but they dont tell what they do and I was just wondering before I bought them.  Or if you could direct me to a website that might have all this information I would appreciate you help<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n            Pendar - Bard on Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
