I&#39;d have to disagree that 10 in a row is &quot;hardly uncommon&quot;.  <br/>\nIt _can_ happen and _does_ happen, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s very rare.  In <br/>\nfact, unless they&#39;re fixed tables, I&#39;m sure it only happens about 1 <br/>\nout of every 1,000 rolls.  And THAT is when there&#39;s a 50/50 chance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s take a look at the chances of 5 rare mobs (5% spawn rate) <br/>\nspawning in a row:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe calculation is:<br/>\n<br/>\n100%/20 /20 /20 /20 /20 = .0000312% chance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFive 5% spawns should almost never spawn in a row.  Of course, there <br/>\nis the small chance they will.
