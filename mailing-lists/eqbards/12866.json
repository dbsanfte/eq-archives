A good motto to live by.  Enchanters (good<br/>\nones) I group with cast augmentation with me around, lasts longer and<br/>\nsaves mana and with my anthem/celerity/mcvaxius/verses adds up to plenty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Since so many of our songs are AoE,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I made a post not too long ago running through all our songs and their<br/>\nuses.  Never do I not have something else to sing, 8 slots is far too few.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Problem 3: Bard invis song kills Enchanter pets / breaks charm.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t used invis for the group in forever, last time was Mistmoore in<br/>\nlike mid20s.  Invis isn&#39;t worth keeping mem&#39;d, it&#39;s use is limited to<br/>\npersonal movement through live side lower guk, getting to the solA bug<br/>\nzone, etc.  If a pet is present, give warning that the pet is going to die<br/>\nto prevent your group from being trained on (forcing you to zone, causing<br/>\npet to die).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Problem 4: For some reason, most Enchanters I&#39;ve grouped with are total<br/>\n&gt; jackasses.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Situational, to be sure.  Sometimes you can&#39;t win a roll for the life of<br/>\nyou.  I give orders constantly when groups aren&#39;t performing efficiently.<br/>\nLast night was a great example of a bad group: warrior rogue me cleric<br/>\nwizard enchanter.  Warrior I&#39;ve been with before, great guy.  Rogue is in<br/>\nmy guild.  Other three stank.  Wiz would sometimes do ok, but more often<br/>\nwould start casting when the mob was running, which sure gives them the<br/>\nfinishing blow at the cost of a rather large amount of mana better used<br/>\nearlier in the fight.  Enchanter at first wasn&#39;t doing crowd control, then<br/>\nstarted using mesmerize for it (instead of enthrall).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exasperation set in when the rogue asked three times for buffs and<br/>\nreceived nothing.  I finally had to msg the cleric and ask him to buff the<br/>\nrogue (giving the buffs by name, mind).  The enchanter never once cast<br/>\naugmentation, alacrity or celerity, and his slowdown spells were so<br/>\nsporatic as to be an afterthought.  Of course, he was quite quick about<br/>\nturning himself into a werewolf when THAT enchantment wore off.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, there are always people at any level that don&#39;t know how to<br/>\nutilize their class&#39; specializations.  Bards that bellow, shamans that<br/>\nmelee, enchanters that nuke, all you can do is remember names and avoid<br/>\ngrouping whenever possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anybody have any tips on how a Bard and Enchanter can group together<br/>\n&gt; successfully and work with each other rather against?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At level 20, I would have mem&#39;d:<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem<br/>\nHymn<br/>\nLullaby if no [good] enchanter<br/>\nLargo&#39;s<br/>\nSelo&#39;s if outdoors<br/>\nLament if puller<br/>\nInvis if Unrest/Mistmoore<br/>\nElemental and Guardian if fighting casters<br/>\nChords/Denons for use in 1 mob situations (and when group is full health,<br/>\nuse denon&#39;s for practicing brass btwn pulls)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s always bellow in a pinch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAthren Notechaser, 44th composition in progress<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
