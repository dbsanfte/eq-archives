Let me first say that Steamfont is a great<br/>\nplace to gain experience. I spent alot of my time grouped with a friend<br/>\nwho is a cleric, and we did quite well, dying extremely infrequently.<br/>\nThe trick with groups is that many people do not understand the benefits<br/>\nof a bard on a party. Part of that is because some bards (namely ones<br/>\nthat don&#39;t read this list *smile*) don&#39;t give our class a very good<br/>\nshowing. They may not twist songs, or use their songs effectively. They<br/>\nalso may not have good weapons or have weak armor (examples would be a<br/>\nL20 bard still wearing patchwork leather with some banded). Also keep in<br/>\nmind that your damage in battle will significantly increase when you get<br/>\nBellow. It&#39;s like getting a kick that always hits (unless resisted).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wonders of bards to me seem to be more subtle. We are neither the<br/>\nnuking mage nor stereotypically the tank (although perioidcally I do<br/>\nmore damage then the tanks in our group, and take more hits).Our healing<br/>\nsong is a more subtle heal then that of the cleric, etc. However, given<br/>\na perceptive group they will know the benfit of the bard. Especially<br/>\nonce you leave, and they realize just how long their downtime is without<br/>\nHymn of Restoration healing 8-10 ever 5 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuffice to say, hang in there, and start by finding 1-2 people that are<br/>\ngood to group with, then go from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAriell Thunderwolf, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\nTanthalias wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Lately, I&#39;m having serious trouble finding a group.
