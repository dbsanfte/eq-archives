There is a little unknown<br/>\nfact about them but sinced they nerfed the exp I guess I can let it out.<br/>\nSea furies are just cyclops with a new name. At first they dropped the same<br/>\nwords a normal cyclops did. Verant forgot to upgrade the ac and attack<br/>\nrating heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words I&#39;m not talking about resisted I&#39;m saying a necro without a<br/>\npet unless fighting undead is basically uselss. The dots take way to long at<br/>\nhigh levels excluding planes to be of use. The only thing that it helps<br/>\nmildly with is the ghoul lord which has about 10k hp but even then they only<br/>\ndo half to 3/4 damage. Besides the fact that the only real good dot besides<br/>\nlifetap is heat based which means you can&#39;t use it in half of the high level<br/>\nzones and as it is don&#39;t ask me why but high level mobs in general are more<br/>\nresistable to heat spells then cold. Why do you think high level druids<br/>\ncomplained that they couldn&#39;t use any dd spells because they were all fire<br/>\nbased and now have a cold based spell? Simple fact of the matter is that<br/>\nwithout a pet I&#39;m useless in a group unless in the planes or fighting<br/>\nundead. I can&#39;t nuke, I can&#39;t dot because they are extremly slow unlike the<br/>\nshaman poison dots which work in 40 seconds. I can&#39;t heal very well. So what<br/>\ncan I do? Use a kick ass pet that takes a lot of work to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaeeldar<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

You feel since your DoTs take over 2<br/>\n&gt;minutes (and fights are usually much shorter), it&#39;s useless in<br/>\n&gt;a group.  Melee attacks are basically DoTs.  Melee classes<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t have the pets or nukes which you feel are your primary<br/>\n&gt;contribution to a group.  How do you think they feel?  Sure<br/>\n&gt;they can tank, but you&#39;ve said you can take seafury cyclopses<br/>\n&gt;solo (presumably with your pet tanking), so obviously your pet<br/>\n&gt;can tank just as well as them if not better (green giants will<br/>\n&gt;eat most melee classes solo, much less the seafuries).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;John H.
