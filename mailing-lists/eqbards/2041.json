I<br/>\nwas not aware that she would attack someone unprovoked.  I was in North Ro<br/>\non my way back to Freeport.  I saw her as I was approaching but just assumed<br/>\nshe was another NPC merchant.  I had some stuff to sell so moved towards<br/>\nher.  Next thing I know, whack, whack, I&#39;m dead.  As I went back to retrieve<br/>\nmy corpse I noticed four other corpses in her vicinity.  She was standing<br/>\nright next to my corpse.  I sang the Carillon song and hotkeyed the /corpse<br/>\ncommand.  Her attitude towards me changed to threatening. I inched closer<br/>\nand was able to safely pull my corpse away from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI now know to avoid her.  However, one day I will get my revenge.  Does<br/>\nanyone know if she is part of a quest?  Also, when I do get my revenge, is<br/>\nthere a major faction hit with anyone in Freeport?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGaltin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Robert &#92;&quot;Nokker&#92;&quot; Venters&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dread@...\">dread@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ummm,, does it work on murissa sandwhisper ,,<br/>\n&gt; she KOS&#39;s me sometimes ,, sometimes she don&#39;t ,, I just want to buy water<br/>\n&gt; without having to run to freeport ,,,<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
