Capozzi laid it to rest a while back.  Jig actually has no effect<br/>\n&gt; on mana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Course, if you can indeed disprove him then I&#39;d be thinking J.M. Capozzi<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t really with Verant afterall.  I mean I can&#39;t confirm whether or not<br/>\n&gt; J.M. is legit.  Is this just someone who just joined the list, and knew a<br/>\n&gt; heck of a lot about the game and faked it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I doubt that J.M. is a &quot;fake&quot; but wish you consider it, for<br/>\n&gt; arguments sake.  I have no idea who J.M. is, and have no resource to confirm<br/>\n&gt; it for that matter.  Must say, if J.M. were a fake, he or she would be a<br/>\n&gt; very good fake.  But who are we, as the grunts, to know who makes the game<br/>\n&gt; anyway?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Credits tell us little, as does Verant&#39;s webpage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like how Lionhead did it: they hired an actual journalist with games<br/>\n&gt; experience to be part of their team.  You check their webpage, and you have<br/>\n&gt; a writer from the inside giving you personal insights.  Get an idea how they<br/>\n&gt; actually tick, and it&#39;s very interesting.  You also know who everybody is!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have no idea who makes EverQuest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Roop<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Douglass Family&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frd@...\">frd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I know this thread has been around, Ive been here for quite a while.......<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And Ive usually been the bard, but Ive never had the opportunity to time<br/>\n&gt; it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all of my travelling companions swear by it though.  I had assumed by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;listening to this list that they were either humoring me or it was in their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heads.  It just happened that I had the opportunity myself and I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;suprised by the outcome.  After thinking about it, if it is truely a<br/>\n&gt; refresh<br/>\n&gt; &gt;rate my test may not have been very accurate, I tested bubbles 2-4 because<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they were the easiest to track.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to RON MARTINO<br/>\n&gt; This week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt; To join ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family program, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
