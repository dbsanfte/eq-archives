My enchanter friend and my<br/>\nwarrior were lucky - we got one each on the first two times we killed Dvinn.<br/>\nOn the way out of the Crushbone a level 21 ranger asked for our assistance<br/>\nin killing Dvinn for his heart (the ranger didn&#39;t know about the dirk).<br/>\nWell after killing Dvinn a total of 7 times that night we never saw another<br/>\nDirk.  We tried again later to help our wizard get one and after killing<br/>\nDvinn 9 times (over a two night period) we finally got one.   So they are<br/>\nbecoming more rare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grei@...\">grei@...</a>[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grei@...\">grei@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, July 27, 1999 4:50 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [eqbards] Dragoon Dirk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grei@...\">grei@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; considering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; More that the well balanced is horrifically overpriced. Try selling one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back to a vendor for a more realistic idea of it&#39;s true value. Everyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know who has bought a well balanced weapon regrets it and tells anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; who will listen not to make the same mistake.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The prices on Dirks are going up anyway.  Last night I couldn&#39;t find<br/>\n&gt; anyone willing to sell a Dirk for less than 60pp--and I went straight to<br/>\n&gt; the source too.  Everyone blamed it on the LORE flag.
