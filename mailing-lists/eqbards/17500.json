Even there, hug the corner to your<br/>\nimmediate left as you enter. Your group will need an expert puller to pull<br/>\nfrom the maze or the hallways. Don&#39;t use any AE songs....and if someone<br/>\nshouts TRAIN, RUN, do not WALK to the zone and fling yourself through it. At<br/>\nlevels 23-25 I had very high death rates in Cazic, attributable to out of<br/>\ncontrol trains that spilled back into the courtyard or to really<br/>\ndisorganized groups. If it looks like you&#39;re about to be trapped, get out<br/>\nthat horn or flute and invis yourself as fast as possible. Feel free to look<br/>\nme up in game if you wish.<br/>\nLatharia Cadeirfardd<br/>\n26th Chorus<br/>\nPovar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 8 Apr 2000 15:54:56 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;John Pollock&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjp@...\">jjp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Cazic Advice<br/>\n<br/>\nAll,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just became a newly minted Bard of 20 songs, and have read (a Cleric<br/>\nguide, I believe) that I could start adventuring in Cazic.  The guide listed<br/>\nas one of the plusses that it really gives you an opportunity to hone your<br/>\ngroup skills, which I am looking to do.  I have never adventured there<br/>\nbefore with any of my other characters and I was wondering the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Do I have a reasonable chance of survival in Cazic if I play smart at<br/>\nlevel 20?<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Are Bards in demand in Cazic?  I imagine that there are a lot of rogues<br/>\naround, but are groups normally balanced?<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  What is the typical crowding of Cazic nowadays?  I know it was bad in<br/>\nthe Rubicite days, has it gotten any better?<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  If you think I am crazy to go to Cazic, where do you recommend that<br/>\nisn&#39;t Aviaks, Oasis, or some other Hellicamped area?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much.<br/>\n<br/>\nDilvish<br/>\nBard of 20 songs<br/>\nPovar Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
