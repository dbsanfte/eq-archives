One<br/>\nmucktail carries this shield, the other carries a<br/>\npolished granite tomahawk.  Both only spawn about<br/>\nevery 4-6 hours.  If you enter the pass from the west,<br/>\nit&#39;s the first up ramp on your right.  If your on E<br/>\nMarr and need help tell me.  By the way, it took 4<br/>\nlevel 16-18 to take him down, as he usally is accom.<br/>\nby at least 2 flame paws.  <br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
