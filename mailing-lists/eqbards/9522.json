I&#39;ve managed to find a good group<br/>\nnow that actually listens (!) to me. We&#39;ve managed to take 4 bandits at once<br/>\nwith this song; I think that was what convinced them! Still, during a fight,<br/>\nI say Assist the puller several times, just as a reminder.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuies, Bard 15th Song<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:48 PM 1999-10-28 , you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Operaman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slider@...\">slider@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Everyone said OK. The very next nasty pull I typed MEZ and watched as<br/>\n&gt;everybody chose their favorite Orc and nobody assisted the puller. It was<br/>\n&gt;late so I said my goodbyes and shuffled home. I think it will take a<br/>\n&gt;situation where this song noticeably saves lives before people will be<br/>\n&gt;convinced. Next time I try it I&#39;m going to make sure to Selo out of there if<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t see a lot of /assisting going on.
