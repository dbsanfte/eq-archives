Fierce Brewing was somewhat ridiculous, I agree, but<br/>\n&gt; at least it offset my expenses.  It actually -costs- me money to be a brewer<br/>\n&gt; now, quite a bit since I experiment and have a lot of waste.  No<br/>\n&gt; experimenting, with failures at master level, I&#39;ll end up actually spending<br/>\n&gt; more to make the highest skill or lowest skill drinks than what I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; actually get back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fine, then I should sell to players, lets assume there was an actual demand.<br/>\n&gt; Well, a player can buy the cheapest drink from an NPC bartender over a PC<br/>\n&gt; Brewer, paying 3 times less, or even more if the PC actually wanted to make<br/>\n&gt; a slight profit!  Most brewers give their wares away free, regardless,<br/>\n&gt; really making this truely an expensive hobby, a hobby, not a trade.  With<br/>\n&gt; Fierce Brewing, was nice because I could give away drinks, experiment, and<br/>\n&gt; at least break even.  Was nice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s all philosophy I suppose.  Some think that the only way one should<br/>\n&gt; advance in any way whatsoever is through killing, rinse, killing.  Quests,<br/>\n&gt; diversion.  Trades, diversion.  I think it would make the world much more<br/>\n&gt; diverse if every member of society didn&#39;t have to play the part of the<br/>\n&gt; ultimate hero.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Roop<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and sorry for off-topic ranting too, but bards should be interested in<br/>\n&gt; getting drunk anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just my views here (still off topic, but all us Bards seem to dabble in<br/>\ntrade skills anyway):<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter fighting my way up to level 11, mostly solo, and barely getting<br/>\nenough plat to afford my songs at each level, I was told that I should<br/>\nwork on trade skills to make the money I needed.  Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>\ngood then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started out cooking, and what did I find?  Not only did the food sell<br/>\npoorly, but that most players only eat bread because it&#39;s the cheapest<br/>\nthing to get from the merchants.  Hmmm...ok, so I can only cook for<br/>\nmyself effectively then (and at a loss--but I can always hope that<br/>\ncooking will mean something in the future).  I&#39;m up to 24 or so in skill<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext skill, tailoring.  Here&#39;s something that actually makes a little<br/>\nmoney.  At least enough to pay for the patterns (since I hunt my own<br/>\nskins).  But what did I find?  No market--everyone wants banded armor.<br/>\nPatchwork is useless except for the lowest levels, and most of them<br/>\neither ignore auction, or have already got what they wan.  Ok, I&#39;m still<br/>\nmaking enough off of the merchants to at least get somewhere.  Up to 21<br/>\nin this skill and seeming to be stuck there (still get alot of failures<br/>\nand I can&#39;t do studded yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nTime for blacksmithing to learn to at least make the studs for my<br/>\ntailoring skill.  As far as I&#39;m concern, this is a complete loss for<br/>\nnow...the cash I spent on it set me back as a tailor because I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nafford the patterns for the longest time.  Although I was able to get<br/>\nstuds made up with a little patience.  Skill here, about 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, finally despairing over getting enough cash to even _think_ about<br/>\naffording banded armor, let alone getting a magical weapon (yeah, I am<br/>\nstill using my Mino), I turned to brewing.  Even figured out some of the<br/>\nrecipes without spoilers (though I turned to those after a while), and<br/>\nfound that it was even worse than cooking.  I lost even more cash at this<br/>\nthan I did at cooking (though blacksmithing cost me even more).  I even<br/>\ngot up to 25 in brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what does that leave?  Hmmm, I can spend several days fishing and<br/>\neventually I&#39;ll make enough plat to afford good armor.  Or I can keep<br/>\nhunting lions, wolves, and bears in EC for tailoring, like I have been.<br/>\nI was thinking of trying pottery, but in light of what I&#39;ve been hearing,<br/>\nI&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t try to waste my money on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, it looks like Verant wants lower level folks to be dependent on<br/>\nhandouts from higher level folks.  I find it rather sad that I can barely<br/>\nget necessities on my own each level up to level 10 and now that I&#39;m<br/>\nlevel 11, I really need banded to survive and I can&#39;t afford it, nor does<br/>\nit look like I will ever afford it soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 copper rant,<br/>\n<br/>\nGrei<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nAbandon the search for Truth; settle for a good fantasy.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
