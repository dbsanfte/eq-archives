Many people want a dynamic<br/>\ngame with more &#39;real&#39; feel to it.  The undead invasion definitely accomplish<br/>\nboth those goals.  <br/>\nI&#39;d even like to see a war over the commonlands where dark elf and freeport<br/>\nsoldiers of various levels started spawning and fighting both each other and<br/>\nthe players in the area.  Very realistic, a pain if you want to travel<br/>\nfreely but so what that&#39;s the way it would be if this were real.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ Hills may be a newbie zone but Kithicor really isn&#39;t.  Most of the people<br/>\nwho hunt in Kithicor (never more than 12 at a time on E&#39;ci before now) hunt<br/>\nthe orcs along the west wall and are levels 15-20.  The ranger guild there<br/>\nis new and besieged already according to the storyline so even that part<br/>\nmakes sense.  All the ghoul messenger stuff was a foreshadowing of this<br/>\neventuality so it should not have been much of a surprise that something was<br/>\ngoing to happen in Kithicor.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy of all people would bards complain about this?  I can tell from comments<br/>\non this list that I may not be a master tactician or combat fighter, but<br/>\napparently I am a master traveler.  I found Kithicor exciting in the heart<br/>\nof the event with red undead all around.  I did corpse recoveries for plays<br/>\ntwice my level who were going to wait for daylight until I showed them how<br/>\neasily I could run thru and avoid getting hurt.  I even helped out in a<br/>\nmeager way with a few battles and healing people up in between battles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would take extremely bad luck or carelessness for a bard over 15th level<br/>\nto die in Kithicor even with the undead out and about.  I ran thru about 20<br/>\ntimes dodging undead and never took more than a bubble of damage at a time.<br/>\nYes, I had to keep my eyes open and be really careful, but tension is fun!<br/>\nOnce a zombie commander spawned right beside me, I just hit the Incoming to<br/>\nRivervale button and kept on motoring along.  The reception committee at<br/>\nRivervale made short work of the commander.  If they couldn&#39;t have they<br/>\nwould have zoned and so would I, no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think events like this are good for the game.  They create an atmosphere<br/>\nof excitement and menace.  They make the game feel real.  Most importantly<br/>\nof all they give Bards a chance to shine as we can usually deal with events<br/>\nlike this long before other classes can and provide actual meaningful<br/>\nsupport to people far beyond our experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPick up your tents, put out your campfires, and go out there and experience<br/>\nthe world!  It&#39;s an exciting dangerous place, full of adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
