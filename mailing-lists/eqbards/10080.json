Perhaps you have, but that does not mean you are<br/>\n&gt;special. For your information, I have played Martyn as a bard since Day one,<br/>\n&gt;And even phase 3 beta. If you have played longer than that, good for you.<br/>\n&gt;(applauds)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ive been an addict since p4 beta, not that it matters much in my oppinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My works schedule fluxuates, not to mention I am in no race to make level<br/>\n&gt;50. which explains my level 22 self. I esplore, I goof around. I sing songs<br/>\n&gt;in concert. I roleplay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Being level 40 whatever doesnt make you better than me.<br/>\n&gt;nor anyone else.<br/>\n&gt;that is the tone I objected to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And a level 22 bard is wearing bronze Breasplate, bronze bracers, bronze<br/>\n&gt;boots. blackened iron arms, and legs. and some bit of leather.<br/>\n&gt;I was in leather until level 16, when I replaced it with some expensive<br/>\n&gt;bronze. and then the BI, when I visited runnyeye<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Like I said. I am not a twink. The only thing I have ever been given is a<br/>\n&gt;barbed whip and some advice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have the same &quot;problem&quot; (lvl 24bard played exclusivly since 22th of april) ,<br/>\nbut I dident take harmonics message this way..<br/>\nBard armor should be no drop. as many of the components are. I do get a bit<br/>\nenvius when I see a level 14 bard wearing a lambent BP, but atleast I know I<br/>\nwill get mine eventually.<br/>\nWell I am still wearing banded sleeves, leather boots varius pieces of bronze<br/>\nand some reacently aquired elfhide gloves.<br/>\nI have been given stuff from high level players though. I remember these things<br/>\nmost notably:<br/>\nBloodstained mantle - In unrest a person shouts out if anyone have seen his<br/>\ncorpse. Well I tell him that I can take a look for him with my song. I find his<br/>\ncorpse barely visable at the house. He thanks me heartly and gives me a BS<br/>\nmantle!! At level 16 or so thats a big thing. So needless to say I was estatic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilvery axe - level 20, Permafrost entrance. I just stood there admiring some<br/>\nhighlevels killing the ice giant. When they where resting up I talked with them<br/>\nand they gave me a Silvery axe - Just like that!! At first I hesitated to take<br/>\nit, but my combine scimitar was getting worn and I was there with a ranger using<br/>\nmino axes of all things so he could use my scimie as a good upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that what i am trying to say is that being a nice guy can pay off. When<br/>\nI offer my help I know that what might look simple can be a real bitch. So<br/>\nsometimes I spend a hour helping a guy with not even a thank you as reward. Well<br/>\nsome people are a**holes so dont expect anything when helping, but those who<br/>\narent just saves the day and restores my faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got me a lambent bracer and guess what? I did it without any help from<br/>\npeople I know, which sure feels good. I paid 30pp for the lambent stone (a bit<br/>\ntoo expensive yes, but it was in Highhold keep and it was the only thing i was<br/>\nlacking).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also aquired the shin greavers and the shin gauntlets - The greavers I<br/>\nhad some friends help me get, but the gaunts I was allowed to loot by a complete<br/>\nstranger while i was hanging out at Lower Guk entrance waiting for my friends to<br/>\narrive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo keep the faith and chill :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n****Snipped some fire hazardues stuff***<br/>\nThe everfriendly bard.<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum, bertox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
