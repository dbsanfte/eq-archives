I have several <br/>\nquestions that I&#39;m hoping some more experienced bards may be able to <br/>\nanswer...<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I&#39;ve seen a few instrument parts for sale.  Is there a trade skill for <br/>\nbuilding instruments?  How is this done?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Does it make any difference what instrument you use within a category? <br/>\n I bought a Mandolin rather than a Lute because it weighs less.  I got a <br/>\nMinotaur Horn right off the head of one of the filthy beasts, and I&#39;ve been <br/>\nusing that for a wind instrument rather than buying one.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Can anyone tell me what &quot;Enthrall & Nix S.&quot; means?  That&#39;s all the <br/>\ndescription the Strategy Guide gives for the 15th level bard song.  I have <br/>\ntried to figure it out in game, and all I&#39;ve succeeded in is getting myself <br/>\nkilled.  It seems to be an area effect that makes every NPC in the area <br/>\ndecide to attack me if I&#39;m solo, and I haven&#39;t spotted any effect when <br/>\nturning it on in the middle of a big melee. (Does it bother anyone else <br/>\nthat the game doesn&#39;t provide spell descriptions? It makes me really mad. <br/>\nThere is no in-character justification for this; the senior-level NPC bards <br/>\nwho teach the songs should tell you what they do!)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Any information on the &quot;stuck song bug&quot; and how to cope with or prevent <br/>\nit?  I had only experienced this twice before last night.  Last night we <br/>\nkilled a named Gnoll and I got a magic axe that casts Berserker Strength, <br/>\nand with that equipped I started getting &quot;stuck&quot; songs every couple of <br/>\nfights.  (Seems to get stuck when the Berserker Strength spell kicks in <br/>\nwhile I&#39;m switching songs, or something like that.)  The &quot;stuck song bug&quot; <br/>\nsymptoms are that you aren&#39;t singing (all song buttons are visible) but it <br/>\nshows a song icon active and gives messages as if you were singing that <br/>\nsong. You can click this icon to get rid of it but it comes back again a <br/>\nmoment later. Any song that you try to sing ends immediately. It&#39;s like <br/>\npart of the program thinks you&#39;re still singing the song, but another part <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t, so you can&#39;t stop. The only ways I&#39;ve found to cure it are to log <br/>\nout or zone. It sometimes goes away by itself eventually (might be when I&#39;m <br/>\nstunned by a monster, not sure).<br/>\n<br/>\n5) I haven&#39;t found the level 14 (Identify) or 19 (Invisibility) songs yet. <br/>\nI thought they were in High Pass, but we got there last night and found <br/>\nonly a few songs for sale. (They did have the level 16 water-breathing <br/>\nsong, which is GREAT.) They aren&#39;t at the Kelethin, Freeport, or Qeynos <br/>\nbard guilds, and I haven&#39;t heard of any other city with a bard guild. Has <br/>\nanyone found these? (I won&#39;t be level 19 for a while yet, but I&#39;m still <br/>\ncraving the song.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Windsong</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
