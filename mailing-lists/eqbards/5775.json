Case<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in point is the vodka recipe that is the current hot topic <br/>\n&gt; on the brewers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;list.  People have been trying for weeks to discover this <br/>\n&gt; recipe.  All kinds<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of logical ingredient combinations were tried.  This week <br/>\n&gt; the recipe was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;discovered/leaked by Verant.  One of the ingredients for <br/>\n&gt; vodka is short<br/>\n&gt; &gt;beer.  No way in hell would anyone ever think to include <br/>\n&gt; beer as part of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;recipe for vodka.
