Then there are undead frogs between the zone and the<br/>\nbedroom.  You go past the bedroom and past some live vampire bats (hope that<br/>\nthey are camped) and undead frogs.  Then past the greater ice bone skellies<br/>\n- who will agro if you get near them regardless of your invis or<br/>\ninvis-to-undead.
