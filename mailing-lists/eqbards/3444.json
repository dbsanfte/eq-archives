That&#39;s piercing.  I&#39;m only lvl 12 (and broke) so it&#39;ll be a<br/>\nwhile before I get to play with that.  Can&#39;t help you much on melee skill<br/>\nquestions, though I kinda wish I had kept HTH up as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for songs ending abruptly, every time you&#39;re stunned (at least) your song<br/>\nwill end.  Some critters stun more often than others.  Skels are great at<br/>\nstunning, so they&#39;re tougher than they look. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Fomar Thain &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fomar_thain@...\">fomar_thain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just hit Level 6 last night (very happy to get the<br/>\n&gt; Heal song :) Anyway I have been keeping up a number of<br/>\n&gt; weapon skills. Since level 3 I have kept 1 hand slash,<br/>\n&gt; 1 hand Blunt and Piercing all maxed. I have tried to<br/>\n&gt; keep Hand to Hand maxed as well but it seems to raise<br/>\n&gt; a few points each level and then stop. Does this skill<br/>\n&gt; cap lower per level than the other weapon skills?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second question is about being interupted while<br/>\n&gt; playing. My only other character is a Rogue so forgive<br/>\n&gt; me if my magic user references are wrong, don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; much about them :)  When I got my heal song I took off<br/>\n&gt; after a skeleton that conned white to me. I was<br/>\n&gt; interupted alot. This had not really happened before<br/>\n&gt; at least not this much! Is Intstrument/Singing skill<br/>\n&gt; what helps prevents Bards being interupted like<br/>\n&gt; Channeling is to Magic user casting? If not what is?<br/>\n&gt; BTW I beat the skeleton but was not pretty *grins*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Third (almost done :) on getting a new song about how<br/>\n&gt; long is it level wise or skill wise before you can<br/>\n&gt; count on playing that song well? Is there such a time?<br/>\n&gt; Another thing that surprised me was that I mess up<br/>\n&gt; playing that Heal song alot more than any of the other<br/>\n&gt; songs I have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly I noticed when I bought my Drums at level 5<br/>\n&gt; from the wood elf vendor she sold a Mandolin and Lute<br/>\n&gt; as well. Is there a difference in these two for<br/>\n&gt; playing purposes? Or are they just two options for<br/>\n&gt; string instruments?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many thanks for the help and safe travels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kobias<br/>\n&gt; Lvl 6 Bard<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
