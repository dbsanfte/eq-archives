Good armor, to be sure, but I don&#39;t think anyone<br/>\nis all that &#39;fabulous&#39; for having it,  nor did I think so when it was even<br/>\nmore rarely seen than it is now.  (That could be because I was in Fear, on<br/>\ntest, long before anyone broke it on a live server).

It seems to work<br/>\n&gt; well for everything.  Does it matter if people are duplicating singing<br/>\nsteel<br/>\n&gt; breastplates?  Does it hurt me in any way?  Does it matter if people are<br/>\n&gt; exploiting monsters?  Does it hurt me in any way?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, yes and no.  Me, personally, I could care less.  I&#39;ve completely<br/>\nmoved<br/>\n&gt; beyond planar armor, so I couldn&#39;t possibly care less what people are<br/>\ndoing<br/>\n&gt; in the planes.  But does it effect people?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to argue yes it does.<br/>\n&gt; For the majority of the players, EQ is a game designed 90% around items.<br/>\nIn<br/>\n&gt; a game with no end like EQ, the main way to actually feel that you are<br/>\n&gt; making progress is by acquiring items.  Argue whatever you like, EQ is an<br/>\n&gt; item based game.  Maybe not for everyone, lots of people just like to<br/>\n&gt; roleplay and have fun, but the vast majority of the population likes to<br/>\n&gt; aquire items.  Just look at how many posts you see saying &quot;I just got item<br/>\n&gt; XX&quot; with dozens of replies saying &quot;Wow, congrats!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with this, we all like to get shiney new<br/>\n&gt; toys, its one of the things that makes the game fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, how do farmers affect us?  Well, to most, planar armor is a badge of<br/>\n&gt; armor.  By wearing it, you&#39;re essentially saying &quot;I&#39;ve been to the planes,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve fought hard, look at what I&#39;ve accomplished.&quot;  To this day, planar<br/>\n&gt; armor isn&#39;t exactly common, and wearing it sets you apart from the vast<br/>\n&gt; majority of the EQ population.  It says in its own little way that you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; accomplished something different, maybe accomplished more than a lot of<br/>\n&gt; people.  Planar armor can be worn with pride, knowing you paid the price<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; it many times over in blood.  People who can obtain this armor with<br/>\n&gt; absolutely no effort, in effect, living off the hard work of others<br/>\ncheapens<br/>\n&gt; the value of it.  Suddenly it doesn&#39;t mean so much to be decked out with a<br/>\n&gt; shiney new planar BP, when anyone can go in, and obtain the exact same<br/>\nthing<br/>\n&gt; by sitting on their asses for hours on end while a ranger pulls mobs one<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; a time as they pop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All this being said, this is how the planes are designed.
