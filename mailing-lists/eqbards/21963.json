I&#39;m going to have a talk with my buddy then. :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;They are aoe centered around the caster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can believe I&#39;m going to start pouring over enchanter spells at EQ<br/>\n&gt;Casters right now. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Looks like they do get a single target spell Whirl Til You Hurl that could<br/>\nbe used to stun a single mob, but yes, overall enchanter stuns are aoe.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting that this WTYH spell can be used vs the giants. Was very<br/>\ninteresting that my cleric&#39;s stun/holy might would stun giants, yet the<br/>\nenchanter stuns would never stick. We may have to experiment with WTYH at<br/>\nsometime as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for AOE stun based around the caster, now I understand why you were<br/>\nsaying they could mez more utilizing stun than they could with just AOE<br/>\nmez.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed something that could very well be a bug. My wife (druid)<br/>\nwould pull froggies to us. I&#39;m sitting next to her so I see what she is<br/>\ntargetted on. I push my &quot;/assist &lt;char_name&gt;&quot; button and interestingly,<br/>\nfind that I&#39;m targetted upon a different frog. (Of course &lt;char_name&gt; is<br/>\nfilled in with her character&#39;s name)<br/>\nIt has wreaked a little havoc having our necro Dot&#39;ing the wrong frog. It<br/>\nhappens intermittantly to us during pulls. I&#39;ve asked my wife to keep her<br/>\nautoattack on even when returning to the camp to see if that helps, but it<br/>\nhas made no difference. Sometimes we have the right frog, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Windleaf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
