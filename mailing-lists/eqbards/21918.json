The Current Standings are,<br/>\nwell, current.  the ideas in the Explanation are basically up-to-date,<br/>\nthough rather than pre-kunark mobs that it lists now it is Trak, VS, the 3<br/>\noutdoor dragons, epic weapon quest mobs, and some PoS stuff.  but the Values<br/>\npage is way way way out-of-date (all pre-kunark items listed there).  the<br/>\nbest way to see what current item values are is on the current standings<br/>\nunder some players (i.e. kunark class armor BP=20, legs=15, epic weapon=20,<br/>\netc.).  old DKP values were set values.  now they are usually the same<br/>\n(Trak=1, VS=0.8, Talendor=0.5, etc.) but can vary based on how many people<br/>\nare on the raid and the total value of what drops.  e.g. if VS drops 2 legs<br/>\nit is probably 0.8 per person, if he drops 2 staffs it may be 0.5.<br/>\n<br/>\noh well i am getting too detailed, basically most of the new stuff is<br/>\ndetermined by the officers and known by the guild, so this stuff may be<br/>\nout-of-date but if you have any questions you can e-mail me.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; which guild are you in and what&#39;s their website?  i&#39;d be interested in<br/>\n&gt; checking out the points scheme. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
