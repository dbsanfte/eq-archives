The first<br/>\n&gt; time I shouted for someone to help me find him I was greeted by the reply<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Damn, now I have to hang around and kill him again.&quot; Nice... not.<br/>\n&gt; Another time, I saw him standing near a small hexagonal shaped stone<br/>\n&gt; plinth. Before I could complete the quest, some invisible mage nuked him,<br/>\n&gt; and then laughed at me when I suggested that he could have waited until<br/>\n&gt; *after* I spoke to him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh well, at the time I wasn&#39;t really ready to be wandering around SK. I<br/>\n&gt; should make another attempt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maekew.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) I also just picked up &quot;Lisera&quot;, a lute that a bard in Qeynos needs<br/>\n&gt; tuning. He says that I need to take it to someone named Nostrolo in the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Karanas&quot;. But, I looked and looked and could not FINFD This Nostrolo<br/>\n&gt; person. Is this a broken quest, or have I just missed this fella? Could<br/>\n&gt; someone give me an idea where to look for Nostrolo? Also, is Lisera a<br/>\n&gt; lute<br/>\n&gt; you should KEEP, meaning is IT better than a regular Lute?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
