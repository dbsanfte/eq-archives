Bard, Ench or Necro, SK, War, Clr, Druid.  Around 25 we<br/>\ndid the Bar room (2nd floor), then 27 or so (which was 2 or 3 nights later)<br/>\nwe moved to the Knight room (3rd floor.)  In our low 30&#39;s we did the<br/>\nbasement torture chamber.  Around mid 30, we did the Ghost room with a<br/>\nhigher level druid who wolfed us.  Then we moved on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIirc, I would use the Lullaby song for crowd control in the Bar and Knight<br/>\nroom when we needed it. Our ench was trading off between her Ench and her<br/>\nNecro.  In the house, you can attack things on the 3rd floor from the second<br/>\nfloor.  You see the particle effects from 3rd floor fights all the time when<br/>\nin the bar room.  And you can target and attack thru the floor.  Also, the<br/>\nagro ranges over-lap.  Our rule of thumb for either room was both needed to<br/>\nbe camped to hold the one you were in. So, we paid attention to the &#39;other<br/>\nroom&#39; and were prepared to evac if they left or were chased out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly Songsynger<br/>\n&lt;The Pantheon&gt;<br/>\nMinstrel somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly\">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bill Costlow&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 12, 2000 9:33 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Mistmoore and unrest?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Having recently hit lvl 29, I left the Lake and FM<br/>\n&gt; zones for Mistmoore...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; dying six times in two days and a lvl lower, my party,<br/>\n&gt; in the same boat, has voted to hit Unrest, thinking we<br/>\n&gt; might have better luck there.
