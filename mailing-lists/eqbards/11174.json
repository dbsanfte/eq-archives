My hubby told me they were in Oasis<br/>\npulling DWGobs and if I could get there, they&#39;d let me loot a helm. I<br/>\npractically ran to my computer and logged on immed (I was straightening up<br/>\nthe living room - but there&#39;s no choice - EQ or clean up the living room...<br/>\nhehehe). I had logged out just inside the HGuk zone to Innothule, so I left<br/>\nGuk and headed to Oasis. When I got there, they had me group up with the 50<br/>\nL druid in our guild to help him heal while he and the others pulled and<br/>\nfought Gobs one at a time. They&#39;re comments to me were, &quot;just keep happy<br/>\nfeet up, sis.... in case things get bad.&quot; Just for kicks I bellowed at one<br/>\nof the gobs twice and, of course, he resisted (He didn&#39;t even look at me, in<br/>\nfact, I bet the Gob just thought, &quot;what is that teeny bug scratching my<br/>\nneck?&quot;.....just wanted to see what would happen)... so I switched back to<br/>\nweaving the happy feet and healing. Not too long after getting there, they<br/>\nkilled one with the helm (our higher level bard had already looted one) and<br/>\nlet me loot it! YAY! This is my first piece of anything for the lambent!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am SO excited - I don&#39;t care if people who are under 20 are buying their<br/>\nlambent (the other day I saw a level 16 bard who bought her whole set of<br/>\nlambent and she didn&#39;t seem to care that much about it... it wasn&#39;t that big<br/>\na deal to her... however, when I told her that I am L22, and was going to<br/>\nattain the lambent myself rather than buy it, her comments were &quot;Wow! L22&quot; -<br/>\nshe was more amazed about my level than anything lambent) - its so much more<br/>\nfun to go get the quest components myself or at least assist in getting<br/>\nthem - even if all I do is heal and be ready to run!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe Journeys!<br/>\n<br/>\n==Lady Brangwen Incantare of the 22nd Song<br/>\n====The Lavender-Eyed Lady of Song<br/>\n======Squire Court of The Guild New Outriders<br/>\n========Citizen of the City of Kelethin on Faydwer<br/>\n=========Wife of High Elf Enchanter, Callais Incantare<br/>\n===========Server: The Rathe<br/>\n===============================================</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
