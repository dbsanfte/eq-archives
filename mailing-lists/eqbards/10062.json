One of the things my guild does for each other is sharing cash and/or items, to help each other out. I have a L10 Warrior who has crafted greaves ONLY ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1185200927\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;    I too wish Lambent was nodrop, I&#39;m tired of seeing level 10 bards<br/>\n&gt;    running around in partial or (god forbid) full blue.  I never gave<br/>\n&gt;    away crafted armor when it was the hot thing to make.  I always<br/>\n&gt;    made said person at least pay my cost, and even then I wouldnt<br/>\n&gt;    sell it to anyone below level 15.  There&#39;s no way a level 10<br/>\n&gt;    should be carrying several hundred plat around to purchase this<br/>\n&gt;    kind of armor anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of the things my guild does for each other is sharing cash and/or items,<br/>\nto help each other out. I have a L10 Warrior who has crafted greaves ONLY<br/>\nbecause a guild member had them, and another guild member was willing to<br/>\nshare his extra cash to help pay the cost for them. One of the things I see<br/>\npeople complaining about is that people are being &quot;scabs/stingey&quot; with the<br/>\nmoney/items/spawns.... but I see nothing wrong with people wanting to be<br/>\ngenerous with items that they have NO other use for.... Personally, I want<br/>\nto do the quests for the armor for my bard, because that&#39;s part of the fun<br/>\nof the game.... but I don&#39;t want to take away from those who are just trying<br/>\nto be helpful to their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    There really arent enough bards out there to drive<br/>\n&gt;    the price of lambent up, so I would expect to pay the cost of<br/>\n&gt;    jewels, maybe 25pp for the stone, and add 25-50 % markup for the<br/>\n&gt;    effort to acquire nodrops.  These items arent worth much more than<br/>\n&gt;    that.  And it&#39;s not like the guy is gonna say: Fine, I&#39;ll just<br/>\n&gt;    find another bard who wants it.  Bard armor and items in general<br/>\n&gt;    dont unload that easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with you there... there aren&#39;t enough bards to drive up the price<br/>\nand most bards I know, including myself, would prefer to get the stuff<br/>\nthemselves. But I don&#39;t agree with the markup if it&#39;s for a friend...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    I feel your pain, lower level bards.  You get bronze now at such<br/>\n&gt;    an early age and so cheap, after wearing it for 5 - 10 levels you<br/>\n&gt;    desparately want an upgrade path and there is none.  Such is the<br/>\n&gt;    price you pay for being given cheap mid level items.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt;    there.  And there&#39;s nothing like earning your own stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I don&#39;t understand the attitude here.... My bard was given various<br/>\narmor items at fairly low levels, some by complete strangers who had no more<br/>\nuse for them, some by what was then my husbands guild and is now also<br/>\nmine... and it didn&#39;t make me &quot;beg&quot; for more from people, nor did it make me<br/>\nyearn for things before I should be able to get them.... I was just happy to<br/>\nget them - AND, grateful to those who would be so generous as to share them<br/>\nwith me. It also made me want to help others in the same way, which I have.<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand the attitude of some who would say that I&#39;ve paid a price<br/>\nfor being given items.....???? I know the value of working for things -<br/>\nbelieve me - and it didn&#39;t take Everquest to do it... Real life does that to<br/>\na person all on its own!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrangwen (almost L20 bard)<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
