What are people <br/>\npaying/charging for this song?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help, thanks ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Beatdrop Battledrum<br/>\n51st Minstrel of the Karana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
