Klug&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sklug@...\">sklug@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heh, don&#39;t misconstrue my email as a flame.  I certainly have nothing<br/>\n&gt; personal against you or any other 50th level character.  I&#39;m simply<br/>\n&gt; debating the philosophy behind playing a level 50 character, <br/>\n&gt; and whether<br/>\n&gt; Verant really ever intended people to play maxxed out <br/>\n&gt; characters for very<br/>\n&gt; long.  I merely assert that it may be time for Shada (not <br/>\n&gt; you, but Shada)<br/>\n&gt; to go into the hallowed halls of the legendary bards that <br/>\n&gt; achieved that<br/>\n&gt; pinnacle of power.  If you&#39;ve gotten all the spiffy items, <br/>\n&gt; and done all the<br/>\n&gt; spiffy quests in the game, what&#39;s the point?  Roleplaying?  <br/>\n&gt; Sure, but that<br/>\n&gt; can be done with ANY level character.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, it would be great if they raised the level cap and came up with a<br/>\n&gt; bunch more zones for &gt;= 50th level characters, but not at the <br/>\n&gt; expense of<br/>\n&gt; all the people that aren&#39;t that high.  We ALL knew there was <br/>\n&gt; a level 50 cap<br/>\n&gt; when we started this game, so we can&#39;t use the &quot;we&#39;re paying for this<br/>\n&gt; service&quot; argument.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In any case, this isn&#39;t particularly bard specific.  So I&#39;ll leave the<br/>\n&gt; discussion at that.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
