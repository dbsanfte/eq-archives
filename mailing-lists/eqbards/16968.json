I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; turned down one previous offer because the site<br/>\n&gt; looked like crud, and had <br/>\n&gt; nothing to offer in return.  This one, however, is<br/>\n&gt; offering to build a <br/>\n&gt; database to house the glossary (making updates Ooooh<br/>\n&gt; so easy), at the cost <br/>\n&gt; of losing my banners.  While this may seem like a<br/>\n&gt; no-brainer (especially <br/>\n&gt; considering I make NO money from the banners I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; currently hosting), they <br/>\n&gt; are for friends of mine, and I&#39;d hate to lose even<br/>\n&gt; this piddling little <br/>\n&gt; advertising for them.  Unfortunately, Everlore is<br/>\n&gt; very strict :P  No <br/>\n&gt; banners from outside sources.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t read the contract yet - waiting on a reply<br/>\n&gt; about that now.  But I <br/>\n&gt; am really ambivalent about this (I *knew* I&#39;d find a<br/>\n&gt; way to use that word <br/>\n&gt; this week ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So here&#39;s my dilemma - and I&#39;m not saying that you<br/>\n&gt; guys are going to solve <br/>\n&gt; it for me - I just need some unbiased input here -<br/>\n&gt; Do I take the Lady or <br/>\n&gt; the Tiger?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Talies the Wanderer<br/>\n&gt; Check out the EverQuesting Bard:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
