And it doesn&#39;t seem to slow the mob&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; movement speed<br/>\n&gt; that much until the mob is low on hp. It can help keep a very fast mob<br/>\n&gt; from rushing back and forth to your casters and healers but other than<br/>\n&gt; that it really doesn&#39;t seem that useful in the early phase of combat.<br/>\n&gt; Later and for nailing down runners it&#39;s very effective though so I<br/>\n&gt; always have it memorized. It can combine well with Screech to <br/>\n&gt; chase off<br/>\n&gt; some mobs while keeping one slowly running away while you <br/>\n&gt; attack it but<br/>\n&gt; this is only useful in limited situations (do not ever play fear in<br/>\n&gt; lower guk for instance &lt;g&gt;) Now that it&#39;s working, I&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; using chant<br/>\n&gt; of flame a bit to see how effective it is. As most of the powerful<br/>\n&gt; L39-40 wizard spells are ice based it&#39;s not as useful as chant of cold<br/>\n&gt; will be, but if you have a druid in the party it is nice. From what I<br/>\n&gt; can tell from testing on myself it seems to do DoT of about 30 as well<br/>\n&gt; as lowering fire resist significantly. I&#39;m hoping they fixed the L30<br/>\n&gt; song soon so I can see how well that works.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt;   Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n&gt;             GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n&gt;                  b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 5,000!
