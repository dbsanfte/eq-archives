I never have to worry about<br/>\nsetting up an assist key and can switch the person I assist in a jiffy.<br/>\nOnly thing that could be better would be if the pad was designed to be on the<br/>\ntable. The 1, 2, 3 and 4 buttons are not that well placed.<br/>\nI have also fiddled a bit around with using it for twisting and while I got it<br/>\nworking with something along: 1 delay(X000mS) 2 delay(50mS) 2 delay(X000mS) 1<br/>\ndelay(50mS) repeat.... I quickly realised that it makes it damned hard to switch<br/>\nto a new set of songs as I could risk a delay of several seconds until I had<br/>\nfully control over start and stopping of songs. Further more twisting is so<br/>\ngrown into my fingers that it dont seem like much of a hazzle anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there you have it. With my gamepad - I have the perfect macro program for<br/>\nEQ... As far as I remember it can even emulate mouse movement and clicks, but I<br/>\nhavent ventured into that yet (and proberly wont).<br/>\n<br/>\nMusiker Silverdrum, bard of the 30th song - Bertox, ZONE: work<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Mon, 14 Feb 2000 10:02:12 -0500<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Joshua R.
