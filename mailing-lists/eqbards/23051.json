Last night was the first time someone actually said <br/>\n&gt; to me, &quot;just<br/>\n&gt; play mana song&quot;.  I always thought I wouldn&#39;t get insulted <br/>\n&gt; but I did.  I<br/>\n&gt; told him that he had to be kidding, it&#39;s going to take longer <br/>\n&gt; to kill the<br/>\n&gt; mobs and you will be healing more.  He was the only caster in <br/>\n&gt; the group, so<br/>\n&gt; I choose to buff the melee people.  After a couple minutes of <br/>\n&gt; arguing about<br/>\n&gt; it (he found out I was right) he said, &quot;got to log, bye&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The mana song is a blessing and a curse.  Get a friggin&#39; <br/>\n&gt; enchanter if you<br/>\n&gt; want constant mana regen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Steve<br/>\n&gt; 38 bard<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
