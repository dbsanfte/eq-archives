Unfortunately, you won&#39;t learn<br/>\nthat if you just kill stuff you know.  (Not to mention it&#39;s<br/>\nlikely to be really boring.)<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g. Low level goblins (minus the casters) in Butcherblock are<br/>\nnotoriously weak for their /con.  The casters are weak for<br/>\ntheir /con too, but (correctly) /con several levels higher<br/>\nthan the melee goblins.  (This AFAIK is the only mob where<br/>\n/con between melee and caster correctly corresponds to<br/>\ndanger.)  All those people running around Crushbone trying to<br/>\nkill the low level orcs are wasting their time needlessly<br/>\ndying to high level orc trains.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the answer is, if you can&#39;t get a high level person to<br/>\ndirectly help you, ask for his advice on what to hunt.  Note<br/>\nthat this is one area where people who&#39;ve played/twinked<br/>\nmultiple characters have an advantage, having been through the<br/>\nlower levels several times.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
