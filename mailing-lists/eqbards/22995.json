The answer would<br/>\nseem on the surface to be 2, but in fact assuming they were excellent<br/>\ntaunters with nearly equal damage output it would actually be 4.  Each mob<br/>\nwould die 2 times as fast and the 2 warriors have 2 times as many hp to work<br/>\nwith.  2*2=4.  Now while they cannot kill 4 mobs in the time it took for 1<br/>\nwarrior to kill 1 mob, once you factor in the downtime for healing (Which<br/>\neffectively doubles in this case) they can kill 4 mobs for every 1 the solo<br/>\nwarrior can kill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\nPS\tYou don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve tried to convince my group to let<br/>\nthe damage they take even out amongst the tanks since that makes my healing<br/>\nexponentially more effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cook Miller-ETOP03 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:etop03@...\">etop03@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 3:24 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] How much more group xp should there be?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how much do we need the group xp modifier to be raised to make it have<br/>\nan impact?  Some friends at work today were speculating and I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nfollow their math so decided to do my own.  I know there are some pretty<br/>\ngood math liking folks on this list, so just please use my calculations(and<br/>\nassumptions) as a starting point, not a knife point(hehe).  I have enjoyed<br/>\nthe binding and other posts today.  I hope this one has some good responses,<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere I go:<br/>\n<br/>\nSoloer gets 1 kill and gets 100% xp<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming no xp bonus and no class xp differences to make the math easier - 6<br/>\nperson group gets 6 kills and each person gets same xp as soloer gets<br/>\nkilling one.   With an enchanter pulling, mezzing and setting up next mob,<br/>\nyou might keep up, but not the norm, but for this argument, assume it is<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath:  6(100%)/6 = 100%<br/>\n<br/>\nNow with 2% xp bonus per person(more than one) per kill - 6 person group<br/>\ngets x kills<br/>\n<br/>\nMath:  6(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 110% if 6 mobs killed<br/>\n       5(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 91% if 5 mobs killed<br/>\n       4(100+(5*2)%)/6 = 6(110)/6 = 73% if 4 mobs killed<br/>\n<br/>\nNo wonder those that can solo, do solo, to get levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow assume 10% xp bonus per person per kill - 6 person group gets 6 kills<br/>\n<br/>\nMath:  6(100+(5*10))/6 = 150% if 6 mobs killed<br/>\n       5(100+(5*10))/6 = 125% if 5 mobs killed<br/>\n       4 - 100% if 4 mobs killed<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you do have that good group, you can get same xp(or more if really<br/>\ngood group) and have fun with friends, acquaintances or whoever socializing<br/>\nat the same time.  And for those that have to group, it just makes it<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can only hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiemur<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I can&#39;t help it - I am optimistic. But if they really want to reward<br/>\ngrouping and entice those that solo to group more often, then they need to<br/>\nmake it comparable to soloing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
