If you are going on a <br/>\nraid, and want to be considered for loot (who wouldn&#39;t?) I would definitely <br/>\nget info on how it will be done before going. The only problem with this is <br/>\non Veeshan, FG&#39;s tend to be spur of the moment with people racing to kill <br/>\nthem when they are found to be alive. Basically, on our server FG&#39;s usually <br/>\ndon&#39;t last much longer than an hour or two after they have popped(depending <br/>\non the efficiency of the raiders).<br/>\n<br/>\nBards should be a primary consideration for this item IMO, though I think <br/>\nenchanters should get dibs on it. Monks - definitely. Then anyone else. I <br/>\nhear necros need CHA. For what I&#39;m not exactly sure (my friend told me, but <br/>\nI forget).<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, Madagan - If you are in a pick up group situation on any raid <br/>\nfind out how loot will be distributed. Since half the raids on Veeshan are <br/>\nmixed group/guild/pick-up group-based, I think randoming works out fine. <br/>\nWhat you need to find out is who will be allowed to roll for what. I heard <br/>\nbards were passed over for the last Orb of Tishani in rolling with only <br/>\ncasters allowed to /random. Total B.S. if you ask me...Though I only do <br/>\nraids with my guild, and everything is pre-determined on who gets what, I&#39;d <br/>\nlove to find out made that decision to oust the bard in favor of the <br/>\nenchanter on your FG raid... =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSartori D&#39;Elsiraad&lt;Legion&gt;<br/>\n50th Bard of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Sylly Songsynger&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eqbards] Tranix Crown Disappointment.....<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 13 Apr 2000 09:57:20 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;People should discuss Loot Rules *before* you start the raid so that<br/>\n&gt;*everyone* understands how loot will be distributed:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;all random on all items<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;some guru decides who gets what or who gets to roll for what<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;alpha loot - splits off (double a&#39;s go last) heh, been a while since<br/>\n&gt;HighKeep?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Especially pick-up groups.  Why go if you wont get paid?  In a pick-up<br/>\n&gt;group, I believe that everyone should be allowed to roll for any item they<br/>\n&gt;want.  Also, if stated ahead of time, once you win a roll, you dont roll<br/>\n&gt;until every one wins something.  Thats for pickup groups.  In my guild<br/>\n&gt;groups, we go by our guild policy which is based on highest and best use of<br/>\n&gt;items, etc. and GM or raid leader has final say<br/>\n&gt;  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pantheon.worldshock.com/articles/looting/index.htm\">http://pantheon.worldshock.com/articles/looting/index.htm</a> ).  I think<br/>\n&gt;Miriana posted that link before but there it is again. I am sure there are<br/>\n&gt;other good loot schemes but to me the most important factor is knowing what<br/>\n&gt;the rules are before you play the game.  Do not go on those stoopid pick-up<br/>\n&gt;raids unless you have a clear understand of how loot will be distributed -<br/>\n&gt;ahead of time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sylly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:John_Senior@...\">John_Senior@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, April 13, 2000 10:04 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Tranix Crown Disappointment.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last night on Veeshan a few members from 3-4 guilds participated in a <br/>\n&gt;Fire<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Giant run,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just thought I would post this here and see whether you guys and girls<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think I should of got to roll for this item?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
