Would like to<br/>\n&gt;know which components of AC affect Hit Avoidance and which affect Damage<br/>\n&gt;Mitigation.  I would assume your Defense stat and your Agility affect Hit<br/>\n&gt;Avoidance and the AC from your armor affects Damage Mitigation.  What<br/>\n&gt;happens when you get an AC buff from spells/songs?  Does the extra AC all go<br/>\n&gt;to Hit Avoidance, Damage Mitigation, or split equally between the two?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
