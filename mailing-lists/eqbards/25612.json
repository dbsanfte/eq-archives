If you login, and have problems, uninstall and then<br/>\nreinstall your video card drivers.  If you have a geforce card, keep in mind<br/>\nNvidia released new drivers today (or yesterday..heh, not sure).  If you<br/>\nreinstall drivers, go get the new ones.  You&#39;ll want the newest drivers as<br/>\nsoon as possible, though, regardless of issues, or lack of them.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you *still* have problems, there are a couple things in the everquest.com<br/>\nDev Corner forum.  For example, I have a GeForce256, and I was having<br/>\ntrouble with my video during the DX8 test period.  There was no &quot;fog&quot;, and<br/>\nthings in the distance, even sections of the ground, would pop in when I was<br/>\nin range.  Everything looked washed out, lots of little stuff.  I entered<br/>\nthe line &quot;UseTnL=FALSE&quot; into my eqclient.ini, and it took care of all of<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope the servers are up when I get home...hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAtonal<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Thomas [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Fuzhead@...\">Fuzhead@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 04, 2000 3:28 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@yahoogroups.com\">eqbards@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Direct X<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one quick question about direct X...<br/>\n<br/>\nI downloaded and just installed it... it told me to restart computer so i<br/>\ndid... i there anything else that i need to do to make it active and work<br/>\nwith EQ or is that it?  any help would be helpful i guess hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n    Tom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
