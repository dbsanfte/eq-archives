I was in a group by the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1047604483\">I know very few of you are on Bristlebane, but I wanted to tell a <br/>\nstory of someone who does not seem worthy of grouping with Bards.  I <br/>\nwas in a group by the green pool in cazic thule (where stone golem <br/>\nspawns).  The group leader, a ranger by the name of silverwinde is <br/>\nnot someone I will ever group with again.  The puller pulled the <br/>\nstone golem and three alligators, (dont know if on purpose or not) We <br/>\nproceeded to hack away at stone golem while i mezzed the gators.  The <br/>\ndruid memmed evac &quot;just in case&quot; and we fought away.  The wizard died <br/>\nrather early on, and since i was busy full time with pixie strike on <br/>\nthe three gators, I was not able to keep healing up also, (perhaps i <br/>\nshould be able to I dont know) I twisted it in on ocasion, but did <br/>\nnot keep it going full time.  The stone golem was under a bubble when <br/>\nour druid called out oom, Silverwinde had taken significant dmg and <br/>\nrequired several heals as the other ranger and warrior did not seem <br/>\nto be able to taunt it off him.  He died shortly after druid called <br/>\noom. I was under two bubbles of health at that time and died seconds <br/>\nafter Silverwinde.  Up to this point I had no problem with <br/>\nSilverwinde, we were all trying to make the best of a bad situation, <br/>\nperhaps he should of stepped back or stopped swinging a second to let <br/>\nthe other ranger or the warrior take some damage, but who knows...  <br/>\nAll in all, everyone died, except the druid who used spirit of <br/>\ncheatah and made the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all proceed with CR.  The wiz casts invis on me (since Verant in <br/>\nthere infinate wisdom requires shari&#39;s sonorous clouding to have a <br/>\nwind instrument present) and we proceed down to my body (We being <br/>\nwiz, 2nd ranger and me) I have no clue where silverwinde is and the <br/>\nwarrior is getting a teleport back, so no longer in group.  Druid <br/>\n(only survivor) apologized and had to log.  Wiz casts invis again <br/>\nwhile i loot my body and then says afk. I wait by silverwindes body, <br/>\nask if he wants it drug to zone, ask if he wants me to sing invis <br/>\nwhile he loots, etc... no he doesnt want me to drag, he will get it. <br/>\nThats ok by me. I am just getting ready to run up to courtyard and my <br/>\ninvis wears off so I fire up my song and away I go. Silverwinde shows <br/>\nup about that time and asks me to turn off my song.  I said i would <br/>\nif he would camo me. (MY BIG MISTAKE, I should of just disbanded). He <br/>\nsaid ok, there were no gators nearby, so I dropped invis and he <br/>\nimmediately got hit, then I did.  Im running / swimming for the zone, <br/>\nwhile they all beat on me and I died trying to find the place to swim <br/>\nup. just too many gators all on me.  As Im dying, Silverwinde <br/>\nsays, &quot;I HATE BARD SONGS&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why Im grumpy with silverwinde.  If i hadnt dropped invis at <br/>\nhis request, I would of been fine.  Then to top it off, he says its <br/>\nmy fault.  Yes, I did a foolish thing, but it was at the request of <br/>\nthe party leader, who presumable knew the area better than I. (it was <br/>\nthe first time I had fought down there) And he says &quot;I HATE BARD <br/>\nSONGS&quot;. I was so mad, I just said Bye and logged out.  Now I off for <br/>\nsecond corpse retrieval.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long tale of a personal problem, but I needed to vent <br/>\nto someone, and I figured you would all understand.<br/>\nHarmonie Moonsong<br/>\nBard in training for the 29th chorus<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
