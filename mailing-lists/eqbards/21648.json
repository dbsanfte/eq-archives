[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mike.j.mott@...\">mike.j.mott@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 05, 2000 8:50 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Charming Giants<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGot a question for you guys who do alot of Giant charming.  I seem to have a<br/>\nparticulary hard time getting them targeted on each other. Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy general charm tactics are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n-\tfind a critter, charm it, fire up selos and start looking for an<br/>\nopponent<br/>\n- \tfind an opponent, recharm my pet, re-target the opponent, let my pet<br/>\nget real close to me and give it the attack order<br/>\n-\tFire selos back up....back off to maximum range..recharm as<br/>\nnecessary, doing big circles around critters if charm is resisted <br/>\n- \twhen pet is getting low on health, do a health check....helps if you<br/>\nhave critters that run when they are low on health..as the<br/>\nopponent will run if he is losing<br/>\n- \tEither chant kite, fear kite or pull out the weapons and kill the<br/>\nremaining critter if health is low enough...or find another target and send<br/>\nmy pet back into the fray.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy various problems are:<br/>\n<br/>\n-\tmy initial charm wears off to soon for my pet to make it to the<br/>\ntarget to attack, so I have to redo the entire charm, get close to pet, tell<br/>\nit to attack etc.<br/>\n-\tboth critters run at me, the pet is behind the target and the target<br/>\nkeeps running at me instead of turning to fight my pet<br/>\n-\ttargeting in general.  F8 targets the closest hostile, but what if<br/>\nboth are uncharmed?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions or do I just need to practice more?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaqo Bardoon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send submissions for the eqbards newsletter to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lol@...\">lol@...</a><br/>\nwith the subject submissions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
