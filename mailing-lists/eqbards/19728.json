Its called the Order of Thunder (no<br/>\n&gt;drop) and is found off a named zombie in the Qeynos aqueducts.  Its been a<br/>\n&gt;while since I wore it (got a Cape of the Midnight Mist now) but IIRC one of<br/>\n&gt;the bonuses is +5 charisma.  It also has a small AC boost as well as<br/>\n&gt;function as a light source.  Check out a spoiler site if you want to know<br/>\n&gt;all the stats on it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Galtin of E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
