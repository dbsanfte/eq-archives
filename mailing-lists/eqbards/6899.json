I think that most of<br/>\nus would be satisfied if Verant just gave us an official answer to the<br/>\nquestions that you stated.  If they were to acknowledge that problems<br/>\nexisted and that they were working on it then I would be happy with that.<br/>\nPerhaps instead of a petition for the items you listed we just send them a<br/>\nlist of our concerns.  That would probably have a better chance of getting a<br/>\nresponse than a class petition would.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I stated in the original message, Verant giving bards the ability to bind<br/>\nwill probably never happen.  I threw it out there because if I didn&#39;t<br/>\nsomeone else would have.  I figured it would be best to go ahead and get it<br/>\nout of the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or<br/>\n&gt; toned<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want the combined power of these songs, why don&#39;t you just twist<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; together?  Or are you saying that you&#39;ll like the equivelent of being able<br/>\n&gt; to play an extra song at the same time?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If we were to generate a petition, I think more important issues should be<br/>\n&gt; covered:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Where the hell are our missing songs?!<br/>\n&gt; 2) Why do half our skills cap at such a ridiculously low level that they<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t even worth using?<br/>\n&gt; 3) Is our level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody broken?  If not, what<br/>\n&gt; the hell is it supposed to do?<br/>\n&gt; 4) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>\n&gt; monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?<br/>\n&gt; 5) Why do our songs get stuck due to lag, or when magical effects wear off<br/>\n&gt; (i.e. Guise of the Deciever)<br/>\n&gt; 6) Why the $#%@#$ does my drum still look like a small wooden twig?  And<br/>\n&gt; why<br/>\n&gt; does a mino horn now look like a small burlap sack?<br/>\n&gt; 7) How about some high level bard quests?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
