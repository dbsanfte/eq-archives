I think that is one of the more<br/>\n&gt; boring places to hunt, at least if you&#39;re killing crocs. What level are<br/>\n&gt; you now? Have you tried any other places where pickup groups are<br/>\n&gt; relatively easy to find?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am actively looking to get out of Oasis. I&#39;ve pinged a couple other bards<br/>\nat twentieth or near twentieth level to see what they were up to. Most were<br/>\neither in KFC, or considering Unrest, a few were also in Lake Rathe hitting<br/>\nthe Aviak tower. When I was in Upper Guk last night I would have loved to<br/>\nstay there but the only group of people I could find were part of a guild<br/>\nout. They were nice, but they were not letting me in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am open to any suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBernwyn </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
