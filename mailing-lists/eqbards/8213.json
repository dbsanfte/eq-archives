Weapons are nearly four<br/>\ntimes more effective.  Put another way, a non-monk melee<br/>\nperson will take nearly 4 times as much damage fighting a<br/>\ncreature h2h compared to fighting an equivalent non-magic mob<br/>\nwith weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the reason, I don&#39;t think wisps were behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
