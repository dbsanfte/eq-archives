Yeah, I know, <br/>\nwind songs don&#39;t do much with bonuses (can you levitate 20% better?), but <br/>\nthere are a few cases where it does make a difference (ie. Pixie Strike&#39;s MR<br/>\n<br/>\ndebuff, possibly others).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, after careful testing of my Unicorn Horn and a standard store-bought <br/>\nflute, I have determined that the Unicorn Horn does add an addition 5% to <br/>\nwind-based songs where it can actually make a difference.  Standing in the <br/>\nFreeport bank, I pixie striked myself several times with a store-bought <br/>\nflute and my MR was reduced by 12 points.   Then I pixie striked myself with<br/>\n<br/>\nthe Unicorn horn and my MR was reduced by 15 points.  I believe my starting <br/>\nMR was 48 at the time (I had removed some of my MR gear so that I could hit <br/>\nmyself more reliably).<br/>\n<br/>\n/em envisions hordes of bards scouring Lesser Faydark for Equestrielle<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, maybe not.  Minotaur horns supposedly have a 15% bonus and they&#39;re much <br/>\neasier to find and kill than a very tough 40+ semi-rare mob.  But then it <br/>\nhas that fabulous light source capability and a whopping 4 charges of <br/>\nPurge...  =8^)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, while meeting up with my wizzie friend in NK last night, we<br/>\n<br/>\ndiscovered 5, yes FIVE HG&#39;s roaming around which we quickly charmed and <br/>\nnuked with one load of mana...   Of course the richest one had a whopping <br/>\n2pp on him... =8^P<br/>\n<br/>\nOgwinn Pendragun<br/>\nBard of 41 (yes!  Thank you Varsoon the Undying!)
