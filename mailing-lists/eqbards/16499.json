They didn&#39;t bother.  Any undead you find in a _dungeon_ have<br/>\nthe coward code implemented.  This was because of the ungodly trains that a<br/>\ngreen conned skeleton would cause if for some reason someone would scare it.<br/>\nDuring beta coward code was put on every npc in every dungeon.  The undead<br/>\nthat wander around outside in the wild don&#39;t have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you sure they con indifferent?  I&#39;ll double check it next time I&#39;m in<br/>\nunrest but I don&#39;t recall invis working at all there.  Maybe they snuck it<br/>\nin with the invis/see invis patch?<br/>\n<br/>\nLyrnia<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 21, 2000 11:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eqbards] Clouding vs. Undead<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kim@...\">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 21 Mar 2000, Kevin L.

You could, at level 30, walk around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in unrest pretty much unperturbed by ANY of the undead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simply because they won&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re so far<br/>\n&gt; &gt; above them in level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just because an undead critter doesn&#39;t attack doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re invisible to them.  Try using clouding then CONNING<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the undead.  They still con as &#39;ready to attack&#39;.  Which<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, they /con indifferernt.  That&#39;s how I&#39;ve always tested<br/>\n&gt; whether it worked or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Except for ghouls and a couple other undead I don&#39;t recall at<br/>\n&gt; the moment, coward code doesn&#39;t apply to undead.  All those<br/>\n&gt; silly L5-10 skeletons and mummies still attack me at 49.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s actually one of the reasons necro pets were regarded as<br/>\n&gt; better than mage pets early on - they wouldn&#39;t refuse to<br/>\n&gt; attack something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; John H.
