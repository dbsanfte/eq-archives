I always believed that when you put together a suit of armor, its kind <br/>\nof like a circuit, i could always swear that when i got all my bronze armor <br/>\nat 25 i would take a ton less damage then when i was only missing one piece, <br/>\nsame with my lambent, i never tested it, but thats always just the way it <br/>\nseemed. so while i take less damage with my high ac , i still wonder if i <br/>\nwould take even less damage if i had imbrued legs. <br/>\nbut who knows. anyone else noticed this? , or should i go out and rent my <br/>\npadded cell now ?<br/>\n<br/>\nUlaien Firesong &lt; == nuts<br/>\nlvl 51 bard of tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
