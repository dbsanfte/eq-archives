I was in a group that consisted of a<br/>\nranger, cleric, and two other bards.  I was the lowest level (37th) of<br/>\nanyone in the group.  On everything we fought, the ranger snared and the<br/>\nhighest level bard kept fear song up the entire fight.  We fought gorillas,<br/>\nhornets, and wurms.  The only person in the group who took consistent damage<br/>\nwas the ranger.  The three bards hardly ever got touched.  Was your group<br/>\nusing snare/fear or were you fighting with conventional tactics?  BTW we<br/>\nwere able to kill Gullerback (named gorilla with a helluva lot of HPs) using<br/>\nthis technique.  Took us forever and the cleric had to heal the ranger<br/>\nseveral times but we were never in serious trouble.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Tong [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:biltong88@...\">biltong88@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 09, 2000 6:19 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Hate Lists<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Bard is a bit low level and as such has never  been<br/>\nto Burning Woods - but both my wizard and Ranger visit<br/>\nthere quite often.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen any of us group with our bards ( 40plus ) in<br/>\nburning woods we have an EXTREMELY hard time keeping<br/>\nthe mobs off him/her.
