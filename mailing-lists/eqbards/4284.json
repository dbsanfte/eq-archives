So what? Well, what this means is:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;- If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;regen<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;- If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;increase at the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;more critical member of a party.
