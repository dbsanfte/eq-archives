I think they made the<br/>\n&gt; drawback a bit too much, as I found the only way to use it was to play<br/>\n&gt; it just before a fight, then the wizard can med up the extra int it<br/>\n&gt; gets him and maybe get off one more bolt. All the casters I worked with<br/>\n&gt; quickly decided it wasn&#39;t worth the extra hassle for what it gave you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seems I&#39;m arguing about this everywhere I go.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have this mistaken assumption that more mana = more<br/>\nspells.  That is not the case.  The amount of mana a caster<br/>\nhas determines the number of spells he can cast without<br/>\nresting/meditating.  The mana regeneration rate determines how<br/>\nmany spells he can cast over a given period of time.  You can<br/>\nhave 100 mana or 1000 mana, if your mana regeneration rate is<br/>\nunchanged you will still cast the same number of spells/hour. <br/>\nThus, more mana is advantageous in a single fight; it is not<br/>\nadvantageous over the long term (if you use that advantage in <br/>\na single fight, you pay for it with longer downtime).<br/>\n<br/>\ne.g.  Your party tries to take and hold a room.  The cleric<br/>\nhas 500 mana.  You attack and are only able to clear the first<br/>\nhalf of the room before the cleric is out of mana and must<br/>\nmeditate.  The cleric meditates.  By the time he is at full<br/>\nmana, the portion of the room you&#39;ve cleared has respawned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe typical reaction to this type of scenario is &quot;damn, we<br/>\ncould&#39;ve done it if we&#39;d only had more mana.&quot;  This is not so.<br/>\nSay the cleric had 1000 mana.  You attack and are able to<br/>\nclear the entire room, with the cleric finishing OOM.  The<br/>\ncleric meditates.  By the time he is at 500 mana, the entire<br/>\nroom has respawned, and now the scenario is identical to the<br/>\nprevious.  More mana lets you take the room once where you<br/>\ncould not before (single fight), but it does not enable you to<br/>\nhold the room (long term).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would say the use for the song is if you can forsee a<br/>\nsituation where you need additional mana for a single fight.<br/>\nStart singing it before, let the casters top off, then start<br/>\nthe fight.  That should let them get one or two extra spells<br/>\nin for just this one fight (after they&#39;ve cast the first few<br/>\nspells, you don&#39;t need to keep the int/wis boost up).  Having<br/>\nthe effect last longer would be more convenient, but not<br/>\nadvantageous.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
