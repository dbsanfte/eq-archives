Being the naturally curious sort, he wondered what could<br/>\npossibly be so important that it&#39;d be locked in a cabin in the middle of<br/>\nthe Kithicor woods? So, after determining that the door was impassable<br/>\nwithout a Rogue&#39;s assistance, he took a tour around the house.  He noticed<br/>\na snake heading my way, so he stepped aside to let it pass, when suddenly,<br/>\nhe noticed it slide UNDER the house.  How interesting, he thought to<br/>\nhimself, and crouched down to get a better look.  Apparently the foundation<br/>\nwasn&#39;t very solid, and had been a bit washed away in the omnipresent rains.<br/>\n Crawling underneath the building, he poked around for a moment to see if<br/>\nperhaps the chimney, which was still firmly attached to the earth, would<br/>\nprovide a possible entrypoint.  Forgetting where he was for a moment, he<br/>\nstood up to ponder, and suddenly realized that he was INSIDE!  How could<br/>\nthat be?  He checked for trapdoors or holes in the floor, to no avail.<br/>\nSuddenly he realized the full enormity of the situation.  The door closed,<br/>\nlocked, he on the inside meant only one thing: he was trapped.  *sigh* Good<br/>\nthing he&#39;s a spellcaster, and had Gate available.  The bad news is, he was<br/>\nheading for High Hold Pass, and was still bound to Steamfont.  Sooooo, 4<br/>\nhours later, he FINALLY made it to the Keep and bought his new spell.  No<br/>\nmore wandering in Kithicor for him!<br/>\n<br/>\nTalies and Berthold<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY?&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nIt&#39;s a new program at ONElist.
