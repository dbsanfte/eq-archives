You&#39;ll get to some hills with<br/>\na monument on top.  Gnoll reavers appear all around here (you<br/>\nwill have to group at L17), and undead gnoll reavers appear at<br/>\nnight (they are tougher - good to have some clerics and<br/>\npaladins along).  There are also all sorts of wolves that<br/>\nwander by that are probably green to you but will join in on<br/>\nthe fights, so you&#39;ll have to stay alert and steer fights out<br/>\nof their paths (the spirit stalkers are very neat, and really<br/>\nadd to the spooky atmosphere of the place at night).  There&#39;s<br/>\nalso a hill giant path that goes nearby, but not near the<br/>\nmonument itself.  If you ever do run out of reavers, you can<br/>\nrun a bit and get a lion or crag spider.  This is a good spot<br/>\nfrom about L17-21.<br/>\n<br/>\nHighpass is also good at this level, but if you&#39;re like me,<br/>\nthe camping and kill stealing in that place will make you<br/>\nwant to quit the game.  The only time I had fun there was when<br/>\nall 10-12 people fighting the orcs were friends of mine -<br/>\napparently that was enough people to discourage anyone else<br/>\nfrom trying to camp there as well.  Being friends, we didn&#39;t<br/>\nsteal from each other, and otherwise had a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Loot would be nice, experience would be nice - but<br/>\n&gt; more than either of those - some place I could <br/>\n&gt; explore would be great.

Travellers are far and<br/>\n&gt; few it seems - so if anyone has any suggestions, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; all ears and songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I take it you&#39;re like me and like to sweep through dungeons<br/>\nclearing as you go, instead of camping?  Find a group of<br/>\nlike-minded people and stick with them.  Guk and Permafrost<br/>\nare a blast fighting like this; Najena and Cazic less so<br/>\n(there are good spots for this, but too many &quot;gaps&quot; to really<br/>\nmake it worthwhile).  When you get to a zone, do a /who to see<br/>\nhow many people are there, and if any of them are really high<br/>\nlevel (these are probably harvest campers).  If it&#39;s too<br/>\ncrowded, it&#39;s probably not worth it except for the exploration<br/>\nvalue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; PS: I recently went to King Xorbbs Gorge (Beholder)<br/>\n&gt; and loved it.
