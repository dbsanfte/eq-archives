The rubi chest will give you 4 extra hps of health regen. Shada","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1870642934\">Are you wearing a rubicite chest and the other person not?  The rubi chest<br/>\nwill give you 4 extra hps of health regen.<br/>\n<br/>\nShada<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well i was almost positive that it gave me an xtra 4hps per <br/>\n&gt; tick with hymn,<br/>\n&gt; however another bard of the same lvl tried it out and said it <br/>\n&gt; didnt. So i<br/>\n&gt; might have been getting confused with the natural healing rate, its a<br/>\n&gt; little tricky to judge sometimes with the server actually <br/>\n&gt; *dropping* your<br/>\n&gt; hps below what the client software thinks it is. So when the <br/>\n&gt; servers come<br/>\n&gt; back up i plan on doing some testing. I hope im right, but <br/>\n&gt; its starting to<br/>\n&gt; look like i am wrong. :(<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
