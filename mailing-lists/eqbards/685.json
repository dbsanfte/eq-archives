I tried <br/>\n&gt; to buy two copies of<br/>\n&gt; two songs in Kelthin and paid for all four but only ended up <br/>\n&gt; with one copy of<br/>\n&gt; each.  I petitioned and was told, in essence, tough luck.  <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the great<br/>\n&gt; documentation Verant.  It appears that this has been <br/>\n&gt; corrected a little.  I put<br/>\n&gt; a copy of a song in the bank and tried to purchase another <br/>\n&gt; copy and it would not<br/>\n&gt; sell it to me.  Good work Verant.  I still want my platinum back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do not know if I can buy a song that I have already <br/>\n&gt; scribed.  Has anyone tried<br/>\n&gt; that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Narcissus of Povar, Bard of the 17th Song<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know ONElist has over 300 Star Wars lists?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join one today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
