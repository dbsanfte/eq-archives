I got one down to nearly nothing, then got rooted. I <br/>\nimmediately started selo&#39;s in hopes that it once again save me. I do believe <br/>\nthat it was NO coincidence. Besides, I did also notice that once I got to <br/>\nthe other side (dagnor&#39;s), I was again rooted. Hmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nPava, Bard of the 18th measure<br/>\nSilent Dragons<br/>\nCazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Actually, my friend I think you are mistaken.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;pretty sure I have read even Brad say that selo&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;originally was supposed to break root.  Now, it<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t probably because the sow folks complained that<br/>\n&gt;bards were too powerful which is BS.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I got rooted last night by something and I<br/>\n&gt;couldn&#39;t break it by starting up selo&#39;s.  It did,<br/>\n&gt;however, work against my wizard friend&#39;s root.  Or at<br/>\n&gt;least it appeared to.  And this was by starting up<br/>\n&gt;selo&#39;s AFTER the root was in place.  Since he is 4<br/>\n&gt;levels higher than me I&#39;d be surprised if I was<br/>\n&gt;breaking it on my own with some strange magic<br/>\n&gt;resistance that I don&#39;t know of. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
