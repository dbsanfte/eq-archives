It is not<br/>\ncommon for orcs to spawn above the lift, wth is that?  I&#39;ve spent the first<br/>\n10 levels of 6 different characters on 3 servers in GF and have never heard<br/>\nof orcs spawning above the lift.  What color is the sky in this guy&#39;s world<br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s a bug?  Does he live in the OOT where the<br/>\ncompass is all messed up?  Has anyone ever heard of this before?  By that<br/>\nreasoning no one should ever get rezzed when found dead at a &#39;safe point&#39;,<br/>\n&#39;cause &quot;its fairly common to find dead bodies at a safe point&quot;.  I can just<br/>\nimagine this guy&#39;s response to petitions like &quot;I&#39;m trapped in the cat room<br/>\ncan you get me out&quot;.  Oh, no sorry, its pretty common to get trapped in the<br/>\n&#39;cat&#39; room, look at all the npc&#39;s there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKit<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bill Costlow [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlatyl@...\">atlatyl@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 13, 2000 2:21 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] Other zoning bugs <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was my second petition.  First was at 6th lvl<br/>\nwhen  Orc Centurians were spawning atop the Orc lift<br/>\nin Klelthin.  We retreated from Orc Hill because the<br/>\nvolume was too much for us.  Kept getting faction<br/>\nmessages even tho we weren&#39;t fighting any more....got<br/>\nto the bottom of the lift and rested.  Kept getting<br/>\nfaction messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guards at Kelethin are a bit dense...we were<br/>\nattacked again and again.  We moved to the top of the<br/>\nlift....kept on getting faction messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nResting at the top of the lift, faction messages<br/>\ncontinued.  Cents were spawning among us and<br/>\nattacking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy petition was answered by GM Traikis who told me: <br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s fairly common for orcs to spawn above the lift.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not impressed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe faction messages continued until we all died and<br/>\nthen the orcs stopped spawning around us<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Perhaps a Princess...&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sarah@...\">sarah@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been quite lucky.
