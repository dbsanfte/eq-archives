My /play time with Kitasi is only 22 hours<br/>\nand something.  I have started moving a little better now after spending 6<br/>\nweeks at 16th level, minus the few times I was 17th, or (gasp) 15th, in the<br/>\nmiddle.  16th sure felt like a hell level to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been playing Kitasi more than any other character though by far,<br/>\nmainly because he is perfect for completing quests which is my main focus in<br/>\nthe game 50% of the time.  Bards provide more opportunities for role-playing<br/>\nas well which makes the game more enjoyable for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reason I play my Cleric is also due to lack of finding others,<br/>\nthough usually it is lack of finding other&#39;s to bind me.  Kaladim during<br/>\nprime time last nite, 3 people no binders :(  In fact if my bard could bind<br/>\nI doubt I would play my other characters ever.  I couldn&#39;t get the time of<br/>\nday from anyone in BB last nite as they were all in too big a hurry to get<br/>\nto Kedge.  I had wanted to check it out for looks while there were sure to<br/>\nbe plenty of people cleaning it out, but couldn&#39;t get bound so I headed over<br/>\nto Greater Faydark and stumbled onto a GM event :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the first time lack of a bind was ever beneficial.  I had a blast<br/>\nfighting off the dark elf invaders, was very surprised I could hurt them.<br/>\nWas even more surprised when I actually got the attention of one and they<br/>\nstarted beating on me.  Fortunately I quickly beat feet and ran circles<br/>\naround her.  One big disad GM run critters have over AI critters is response<br/>\ntime.  I could run circles around her and keep bellowing away and she<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get a bead on me.  good thing too cause she smacked me down 3<br/>\nbubbles real quick when she did catch me in melee.  Made some friends with<br/>\nsome folks more your level or higher who had no healers available.  Even my<br/>\npaltry 9 points a pulse felt good to them after sitting and getting 2.  One<br/>\neven rewarded me with a Lambent Stone for saving him from the Dark Elf<br/>\nCleric.  All in all a fun nite despite the zone crash.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKitasi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 29, 1999 1:45 PM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: RE: [eqbards] FW: Bard newbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James Schuldes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgs@...\">jgs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe - actually I think you would also get a laff out of my /played time<br/>\nwhich is I think more than 68 days now.  Most high lev&#39;s would really laff<br/>\nthat I am not PoF able with that amount of time logged in.  In fact, I guess<br/>\nI disprove my own saying that all you have to do to level is put the time<br/>\nin.  I am a really in-efficient player when it comes to time/level over all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike it said, I started a war and played him to level 13. I played him and<br/>\nSylly alternately for about 3 weeks then robbed him and parked him.  I have<br/>\na few hours in other chars just to have a feel for the screens they look at<br/>\nand the stuff they do - like casters.  I have a cleric who is level 8 and<br/>\nslowly getting twinked up.  A big reason I play her is so that I stay out of<br/>\ntrouble when I have online time and my group is not around.  I am getting<br/>\nreal paranoid about dieing and the time required to make up for lost ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ya, if you want to level, you need to focus on one char and be in a group<br/>\nafter lev 12 to 15 when you cant effectively solo any more.  That don&#39;t mean<br/>\nthat is what I did - I went weeks sometimes without a level - because I was<br/>\nexploring or questing. Or adventuring and helping people. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\t\tFrom:\tKimes, Dean W.
