If you are blaring away on your <br/>\n&gt; chants, doing enough<br/>\n&gt; damage that you are overcoming the warrior&#39;s taunt button, thats not<br/>\n&gt; healthy.  I think a lot of bards fall into this trap.. its <br/>\n&gt; like the rangers<br/>\n&gt; who choose high-procing weapons and dex over AC, and wonder <br/>\n&gt; why they die all<br/>\n&gt; the time and why their cleric hates them.

They can make music with song <br/>\n&gt; and their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instruments can make (some) songs better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Look at the songs and if they are string, percussion, wind or <br/>\n&gt; &gt; brass, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will be enhanced (have more power) when you sing them and have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; appropriate instrument equipped.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some instruments give more power than others (in the same <br/>\n&gt; class: wind,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; string, etc.)  The instruments bought in stores (from <br/>\n&gt; &gt; merchants) are the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; base line.  See this for a chart of the instruments:  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqsongs.com/Instruments.htm\">http://www.eqsongs.com/Instruments.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqsongs.com/\">http://www.eqsongs.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bards at your level can learn the &quot;all instrument attack&quot; -- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s actually a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cantana-tada-tina(tm) ;)  You can play a series of songs and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; do more damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to mobs than if you were to use your weapons.  You can learn to swap<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instruments for maximum effect.  For example:  play Chords of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dissonace with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lute; Heal song with lute; swap lute for brass horn and play Denon&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dischord. Rinse, repeat.  Setting up a hot key pallette with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; your melee 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; slot and 2 inventory slots helps with the swapping.  And <br/>\n&gt; once you get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comfortable, you can just leave the swapped out instrument on <br/>\n&gt; &gt; your mouse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cursor.

Are all of our good <br/>\n&gt; &gt; songs going to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be AE?
