Not only do they have a couple hundred more hp, but<br/>\n&gt; their parries, blocks, and ripostes really cut down on the<br/>\n&gt; damage they take.  When fighting in Cazic, the lizards that<br/>\n&gt; take 20-30 seconds to drop my melee friends by one bubble<br/>\n&gt; usually do the same to me in just two or three hits.  You do<br/>\n&gt; *not* want to be playing an area effect damage song that will<br/>\n&gt; make you the primary recipient of damage from all the mobs the<br/>\n&gt; group currently isn&#39;t fighting.  If at all possible, let the<br/>\n&gt; real tanks do the tanking.  The only time I try to take damage<br/>\n&gt; anymore is if it&#39;s a tough fight (to ease the damage the<br/>\n&gt; others are taking), I&#39;m the closest thing in the group to a<br/>\n&gt; tank, or if I&#39;m trying to get a mob off a caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We should mention however that like everything else in the game, these<br/>\naren&#39;t rules written in stone. You have to judge the situation. I<br/>\nremember having some success with DDD and lullaby in Cazic, and even<br/>\nplayed lullaby in Lower Guk once when we got mobbed by the remains of<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s train in the undead tower. Chain and fear can work<br/>\namazingly well in Cazic as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only hard and fast rule I&#39;ve ever really used is _never_ play the<br/>\nfear song in Lower Guk, and there&#39;s probably some bard who has chained<br/>\nand feared down there so even that&#39;s probably flexible. I&#39;ve tried all<br/>\nkinds of stuff I normally wouldn&#39;t try, usually to try to get a mob (or<br/>\nmobs) off the cleric since the charm song stopped working on mobs over<br/>\nL38, as I sometimes seem to be the only one who can be spared from<br/>\nbeating on the primary target in a tough fight, or if there&#39;s no warrior<br/>\nin the group, the hybrid&#39;s weak taunting skills become a liability.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n  Artificial Intelligence stands no chance against Natural Stupidity.<br/>\n            GAT d- -p+(--) c++++ l++ u++ t- m--- W--- !v<br/>\n                 b+++ e* s-/+ n-(?) h++ f+g+ w+++ y*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
