It NEVER broke root.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me one of three things has happened:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) They have changed it since the patch first appeared (I haven&#39;t been<br/>\ntrying it under the assumption it does nothing)<br/>\n2) Level is a factor - and never kicked in for me when I tested it.<br/>\n3) The Root duration is pretty random anyway - perhaps the people when<br/>\npeople thought they &quot;broke&quot; it - it simply wore off at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Steven S.
