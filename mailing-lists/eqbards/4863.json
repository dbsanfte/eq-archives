For the most part I<br/>\nfind the Bard a tremendously enjoyable and challenging character to play<br/>\nwith few complaints.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, I keep noticing subtle changes in the game where it appears<br/>\nthat our class is actually being NERFED instead of having some of the long<br/>\nstanding problems fixed, and this is why I am speaking up.  I have played a<br/>\nBard solidly for 4 months happily, and I wonder why at level 22 I suddenly<br/>\nmiss notes regularly on low level songs I have had for a long time, and I am<br/>\na &quot;Master&quot; at all my instrument skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently the Bard was too powerful in beta and had to be nerfed somewhat,<br/>\nbut it seems to be continuing.  Is this innocent mistakes that get<br/>\nintroduced into the code with patches or is this secret nerfing that Verant<br/>\ndoes not want us bards to know about since we would pitch a major fit if we<br/>\ndid know?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy invisibility song has always worked against undead, but last night in<br/>\nUnrest it seemed that all the mobs I ran past saw right through it and<br/>\nproceeded to attack me none the less - this has NEVER happened to me before<br/>\nin Unrest, unless of course I blinked visible for a moment, which I did not<br/>\ndo last night when these things happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my class change rants:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Do not cap our skills so low, like forage (40), and sneak (70) - absurd.<br/>\nRaise the caps.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Fix our broken songs - there are some that do not appear to do anything<br/>\n(Disenchanting Melody) and others that are silly (random short distance<br/>\nteleport that tends to put you in a basement of a zone or at the bottom of<br/>\nthe ocean - I waited 21 levels to get that?)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Do something about the Z-axis bug - I don&#39;t care how well sound travels,<br/>\nit does not travel through several feet of earth and stone into a basement,<br/>\nthereby drawing out uber-mobs who are hell-bent on destroying the bard, and<br/>\ngenerally do so before he knows what hit him (often then don&#39;t even need to<br/>\nleave the basement to do it!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThese I see are the main issues, but I also wanted to add that we have<br/>\nchosen to play the Verant Bard class, which I think is designed for<br/>\ngrouping.  It is very very hard to solo with a bard and we do our best work<br/>\nin a group.  You have to like that, and you have to play your character and<br/>\nunderstand it to get the most benefit from it.  It is hard sometimes to be<br/>\nsatisfied with some of our abilities because we get a little taste of so<br/>\nmany different kinds that so many other specialized classes do so much<br/>\nbetter than us at them.  The mobs are always greener on the other side of<br/>\nthe zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone cares, my other opinions are interspersed below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Judson Sapp [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JudsonSapp@...\">JudsonSapp@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 04, 1999 11:33 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@onelist.com\">eqbards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Bard Petition<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Judson Sapp&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JudsonSapp@...\">JudsonSapp@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I read a post about starting back up the bard petition.  I <br/>\n&gt; for one do not<br/>\n&gt; like petitions but for some strange reason that seems to be <br/>\n&gt; the way to get<br/>\n&gt; things fixed with this game.  So I wrote the original writer <br/>\n&gt; of the Bard<br/>\n&gt; petition and he wrote me back saying &quot;If you rally some <br/>\n&gt; people to make new<br/>\n&gt; comments, I will overhaul it and submit it to Brad&quot;.  The <br/>\n&gt; ball is in our<br/>\n&gt; court so I was hoping to see a bunch of new comments on <br/>\n&gt; things we would like<br/>\n&gt; to have fixed or changed with the class.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a personal note my Bard character is my favorite to play, <br/>\n&gt; and believe it<br/>\n&gt; or not on the Magician mailing list everyone there complained <br/>\n&gt; a lot more<br/>\n&gt; about there class.  I have to say though that my Mage <br/>\n&gt; character was a lot<br/>\n&gt; more balanced than my bard.  And yet they keep helping the <br/>\n&gt; Mages out by<br/>\n&gt; fixing their complaints.  Maybe the squeaky wheel does get oil.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Suggestions:  As my bard is still new I can offer only a few <br/>\n&gt; ideas to get<br/>\n&gt; the ball rolling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.  Some of our songs seem to do just about the same thing.  <br/>\n&gt; My idea is<br/>\n&gt; change the higher level song to do more.  Ex.  Chant seems to <br/>\n&gt; me (Stats<br/>\n&gt; might be the factor) to be the better song to use over <br/>\n&gt; Warsong and Anthem.<br/>\n&gt; I have seen a lot of debate over this but here is my point, <br/>\n&gt; there should be<br/>\n&gt; no debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree, but I also think these are trivial compared to some of the other<br/>\nissues we should be focusing on getting fixed.  At least Chant and Anthem DO<br/>\nsomething useful, never mind the fact that they are somewhat similar in<br/>\nnature - that is a whole different thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.  I love the idea of a harmony skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think since it is possible with low lag to successfully weave 3 songs<br/>\n(some people say 4) but that when lag is introduced it drops to 2 due to<br/>\nfactors out of the players control, and also the fact that constantly<br/>\nweaving is difficult on the hands, we should get the ability to have some<br/>\nkind of automatic weaving mechanism.  Still, there are other things about<br/>\nthe character that are bugged worse than this - which is not really a<br/>\nbug-fix request when it comes right down to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding <br/>\n&gt; like the rouges<br/>\n&gt; do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I absolutely agree, why should we not?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a <br/>\n&gt; role-playing stand<br/>\n&gt; point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it <br/>\n&gt; also, so flip a<br/>\n&gt; coin.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Binding sure would be nice, but standing firm on that issue makes me uneasy<br/>\nas I feel like I am whining for Verant to help me come to terms with my own<br/>\nlaziness or impatience to deal with the 5 minutes or so it takes to run back<br/>\nto my corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5.  Have you ever played a Role Playing Game where a bard was <br/>\n&gt; not using a<br/>\n&gt; crossbow or bow?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bards would use a crossbow if this game had them, at least in the historical<br/>\nrole-playing sense.  I&#39;m not sure a bow is appropriate, though.  We can<br/>\neither equip our instruments and stand back (in which case we cannot use the<br/>\nbow unless we unequip and stand back) or we can jump in the melee (in which<br/>\ncase we would not use the bow) so I think it is kind of moot to press this<br/>\none.  We already get a nice variety of skills from all the different classes<br/>\nas it is - I say make the skills we have reach higher caps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6.  I love the idea about having a couple of Bard only <br/>\n&gt; weapons that can be<br/>\n&gt; used as an instrument also.  (Singing Sword to increase the affect of<br/>\n&gt; singing songs,  Or a whistling sword for wind)  Who knows, a <br/>\n&gt; lot of ideas<br/>\n&gt; here would help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting idea, paladins get swords like Ghoulbane and we get instruments<br/>\nlike the Battle Drum.  As far as melee goes, we get such a variety of<br/>\nchoices in our weapons that I don&#39;t really care about a class-specific<br/>\nweapon.  We can use weapons that only mage types can use (like the Staff of<br/>\nWrithing) so I&#39;m not so concerned about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this gets the ball rolling and as viewed as a <br/>\n&gt; constructive way to<br/>\n&gt; help solve some bard issues.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fair thee well friends!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com!<br/>\n&gt; If you join ONElist&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
