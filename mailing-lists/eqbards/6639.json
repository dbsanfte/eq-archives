First off,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-302489626\">I have read a lot of posts on this topic, mainly on the EQVault boards.<br/>\nHere&#39;s my take on it:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  I don&#39;t think Verant hates powergamers at all.  First off, let me say I<br/>\nthink that the term powergamer, which I believe was first used as a<br/>\nreference to a type of player in pen and paper RPGs, is actually a misnomer<br/>\nin EQ.  There are a lot of EQ players who have made 50th level.  Are they<br/>\nall powergamers just because they have made 50th level?  Not necessarily so.<br/>\nSome may be true &quot;powergamers&quot;.  Some may be great roleplayers with lots of<br/>\ntime on their hands.  Most probably fall somewhere in between.  No matter<br/>\nwhich type of player they are, they apparently enjoy playing EQ so much that<br/>\nthey are willing to spend enough time playing it to get a character to 50th<br/>\nlevel.  Lets also assume that these players, because they spend so much time<br/>\nplaying EQ, are also the customers most likely to renew their subsciption<br/>\nwhen it runs out.  Strictly from a business perspective, why would Verant do<br/>\nanything malicious to punish the customers that spend the most time playing<br/>\ntheir game?  This will only lose them customers and revenue.      <br/>\n<br/>\n2)  High-level characters don&#39;t have anything to do now.  Verant probably<br/>\nspent around two years developing this game.  Within six months of release,<br/>\nthere are now numerous players who have 40+ level characters.<br/>\nUnderstandably, a lot of these players are getting bored because they don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a lot of new things to do.  I think it is safe to say that the Verant<br/>\nprogrammers, no matter how smart they are and how hard they work, will never<br/>\nbe able to keep pace with the powergamers.  If Verant spends one month<br/>\ncreating a new high level zone, the high level players will have it mastered<br/>\nwithin a couple of days of release.  I think this is something that we just<br/>\nhave to accept as unavoidable and not worry about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I see it, until the expansion comes out, high level players have four<br/>\noptions:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1)  Start a new character<br/>\n\t2)  Play the same character but do the same stuff over and over<br/>\n\t3)  Play a different game until the expansion comes out<br/>\n\t4)  Quit EQ completely<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich option is the correct one to choose is a personal choice.  However,<br/>\nIMO, if a 50th level player decides to quit EQ completely because they are<br/>\nbored, I don&#39;t think that is Verant&#39;s fault at all.  For the most part,<br/>\nVerant delivered what they said they would deliver.  Everyone knew that 50th<br/>\nwas the highest level available until the expansion comes out.  With that<br/>\nsaid, I do think 50th level characters should have the option to temporarily<br/>\nsuspend their account, i.e. not pay the monthly fee, until the expansion<br/>\ncomes out.  When the expansion does arrive, they can reactivate their<br/>\naccount and still have their original character.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing,  before EQ came out,  I averaged buying about 10 computer<br/>\ngames a year.  A lot of them I would not even finish because I got bored<br/>\nwith them.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since April and I am still having lots of<br/>\nfun playing.  As a 22d level bard, I still have alot of things I can look<br/>\nforward to doing in the game.  I haven&#39;t even considered buying a new game<br/>\nsince April.  Couldn&#39;t even tell you the last time I went to Compusa to<br/>\nbrowse.  Always looking on the bright side, playing EQ is saving me about<br/>\n$400 a year:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGaltin of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Naeeldar&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jackal@...\">jackal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heh seems like it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes I agree Verant seems to hate powergamers very much although I doubt<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; the real reasons. Verant seems to believe that the reason most people are<br/>\n&gt; leaving the game ( level 50 people that is or close ) is because we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; beaten the game typically for a powergamer. However I know most people<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; got bored with it because there was nothing else to do with their current<br/>\n&gt; char or areas like Lower Guk or Sol B are just too crowded. If verant<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; add some more high level areas and fix PoF I seroiously doubt this would<br/>\n&gt; continue. On another note almost all the 40+ I know and group with have a<br/>\n&gt; secondary char some even have 3-4.  Hopefully Verant will begin to realize<br/>\n&gt; problems as more and more people leave.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Naeeldar<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
