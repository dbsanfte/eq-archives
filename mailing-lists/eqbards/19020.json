We took 2 groups mixed from 51 down to lo-mid<br/>\n30&#39;s.  All green to 50&#39;s (iirc - maybe a few greenie exp&#39;s but essentially<br/>\nall green).  We worked it like a normal dungeon crawl and tried to move thru<br/>\nlooking for our 51 Wiz who wandered off sight seeing and fell thru a trap<br/>\neither into the jail or near the jail.  After 3 hours, we were kinda tired<br/>\nand decided to gate out - never did find our wizard.  Saw some neat places<br/>\nand got one really nice thing for a druid (forget what it was staff or shawl<br/>\nor something with wis+).<br/>\n<br/>\nDroga is a huge maze.  Get a map if you are so inclined or just explore it -<br/>\nbut it seems endless.  It&#39;s one-way in (because you have to go down the<br/>\npit-trap and cant get out) and you need to find either zones to the mines of<br/>\nNurga or find the passages back to the entrance zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the name of the nifty range slot item?  Sounds like something I need<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Greg Gillan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ggillan@...\">ggillan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eqbards@egroups.com\">eqbards@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 26, 2000 10:14 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eqbards] Temple of Droga<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Anyone have much experience in Droga?
