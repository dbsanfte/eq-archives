I&#39;d fight it until I<br/>\nwas at 2 bubbles, Pixie Strike and Hymn to heal up,<br/>\nrepeat.  It took me something like 3 and a half times doing<br/>\nthis before I finally killed it.  i.e. I lost 11+ bubbles to<br/>\nthe GK&#39;s 5.  You could double the hp I had, or double my<br/>\ndamage output, and I still wouldn&#39;t be able to solo it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst time I heard about Chain/fearing, I thought it was<br/>\ncheesy.  Now I realize it&#39;s just one of the tools given to us<br/>\nto help us overcome our extreme disadvantage in straight<br/>\ncombat.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJohn H.
