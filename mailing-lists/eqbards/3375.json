In-game<br/>\nreasoning does have importance and must be considered, but since we&#39;re<br/>\ncreating an artificial world out-of-game constraints must take precedence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is any chance of persuading Verant to open the bard class to dark<br/>\nelves, the argument must be based on game balance.  Once you have a<br/>\npersuasive position there, inventing the in-game explanations for the way<br/>\nthings are is easy and fun and somewhat unnecessary, since people will do<br/>\nit themselves even if you supply canned explanations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problem with accomplishing your goal is prying information out<br/>\nof Verant.  They may have the killer out-of-game argument for the way<br/>\nthings are or they may not have thought very deeply about it.  Making that<br/>\nsort of determination in the face of Verant&#39;s general lack of communication<br/>\nwill be somewhere between difficult and impossible unless you can find the<br/>\nright nerve to hit and actually get a response as we do from J.M. on some<br/>\ntopics.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I find attempts to communicate with Verant extremely<br/>\nfrustrating.  For the most part people there, including J.M., don&#39;t even<br/>\nacknowledge most questions or suggestions, so you have no clue when they&#39;re<br/>\neven listening, much less what light they may be able to shed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBob</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
