I know in the<br/>\n&gt;future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more clear rules<br/>\n&gt;set up.  Does this happen on other servers?

Its truly sad that these two individuals have made it very <br/>\ndifficult to go on any planes run unless you join a power guild because of <br/>\nloot stealing issues and its made people who are normally very nice into <br/>\npeople who trust no one and are looking for conspiracy at every turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming that most decided that this theft never actually occurred <br/>\nthough because its not plastered all over the solusekro.org message boards <br/>\nso I think you are in the clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthem Dirgemaker<br/>\nLevel 50 bard of Qeynos<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
