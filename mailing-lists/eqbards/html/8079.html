I honestly havent heard anything about kiting since that one<br/>
big patch.  No complaints either way.  Complete silence.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s that big of an issue as you play it to be.<br/>
It was before, but like I said, no one has said a peep on the<br/>
game server, the lists, the web, or by other means.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like the kiting that you refer to just went underground <br/>
and vanished from plain sight.  I consistantly fear/chain in<br/>
outdoor battle with my groups; it reduces dmg taken.  I&#39;ve <br/>
never solo&#39;d with those tactics since high 20s, and even then <br/>
I did it to see if I could.<br/>
