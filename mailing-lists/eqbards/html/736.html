&gt;I also disagree that str is the best stat. I pumped 5 into str, and put the<br/>
&gt;rest in charisma. I almost never fizzle when twisting, and I get incredible<br/>
&gt;prices on items at the store. I&#39;ve also been able to access vendors most<br/>
&gt;other of my type can&#39;t - even without killing to adjust factions.<br/>
<br/>
I took my Half Elf STR, DEX, and AGI up to 95 each, left CHA at 85, and at<br/>
level 30 I&#39;m happy I did.<br/>
<br/>
Almost all my beta experience was as a rogue, and I&#39;m more combat oriented<br/>
than some bard players may wish to be.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, missed notes are seldom, resists are infrequent, and I have the STR<br/>
to wear plate, hit hard and well, the AGI to avoid more hits, and the DEX to<br/>
hit better as well as not get knocked out of songs as much by bashes.<br/>
<br/>
CHA has a minor impact on resist rates, and I mean MINOR.  The biggest use<br/>
for it is lower prices, and with 85 prices are low enough for me, money is<br/>
easy to come by in the 20&#39;s and beyond. </span></blockquote></div>
