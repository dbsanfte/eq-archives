<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378781097">I&#39;ll second that - I&#39;m pretty sure there was some official at Verant who<br/>
made the statement that Selo&#39;s was SUPPOSED to break root - but not SOW.  If<br/>
Laena and my memory is correct - than they &quot;broke&quot; one and &quot;fixed&quot; the<br/>
other...<br/>

&gt; I think this e-mail looks great, but I do agree that we should comment on<br/>
&gt; the changed behavior of Selo&#39;s and SOW.  I had thought that Selo&#39;s<br/>
breaking<br/>
&gt; root was a confirmed feature of the song (I&#39;m positive I remember someone<br/>
&gt; from Verant making that comment once) which is now broken.  This should,<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; least, be investigated.<br/>
