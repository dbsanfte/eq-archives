<b>Subject:</b> Lev 51 Selos got me killed! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-777746071">Last night, I was tracking and pulling in Trakanons. At first was using my Selos drum and out running the mobs thus losing them. So I switched to weps and was slow enough but noticed something.<br/>
<br/>
When you get attacked or attack something, while playing SSoT (song of travel), the effect drops immediately. And you have to re-key it to get going again. It looks like it will be un-workable for fighting mobs if it drops as soon as you key anything else. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I was trying to pull some named spectre/skell thing who had a pet and was getting whacked pretty good so i started to run. But with the song dropping and the pet on me, I did not quite make it far enough away. I got low health and a random froogie agro&#39;d and I died - ugh.<br/>
<br/>
So, if I plan on fighting stuff, I think I am gonna keep L5 Selos memmed too. And I shoulda switched back to drum.<br/>

p.s. yes, i did manage to kill one of my guildies with SSoT as well. she ran out of song range when we were coming out of the mountains. splat! no exp loss for her so she was not too mad. we used the old song and she cast levitate from then on. if you use SSoT, might be good to be in the lead or have a leader that knows not to run away as fast as he can.<br/>

p.s.s. some pics of some of the nameds:<br/>
