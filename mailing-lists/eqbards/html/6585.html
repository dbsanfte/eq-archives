<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482675499">Like someone else previously posted, the Lesser Blade Fiend comes out of the<br/>
basement.  I had the fortune to kill one while camping in the courtyard.<br/>
Someone pulled a train from the basement that included a bunch of nasty<br/>
stuff.  My group watched it run by while sitting along the wall.  The train<br/>
headed to the zone chasing the party that started it.  The Lesser Blade<br/>
Fiend was at the end of the train.  Our party attacked it and killed it with<br/>
relative ease.  It is one of the coolest looking monsters I have seen in the<br/>
game.  It looks like an air elemental with several swords that swirl around<br/>
and around.  Imagine an invisble cuisinart and you get the picture.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; Unrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>
&gt; told they do not exist.  I never see anyone using this weapon, nor do I<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; anyone selling it...is it a limited release artifact now?  Who knows the<br/>
&gt; mysterious secret of the origin of the Pugius Dagger?<br/>
