<div id="ygrps-yiv-871629611">Fohut asked:<br/>
Also, when soloing which do you prefer: Anthem de arms, or Whistling<br/>
warsong?<br/>
<br/>
*** Jonathan&#39;s Whistling Warsong.  Though in another two levels Hymn,<br/>
Chords of Dissonance, and Bellow with a stringed instrument starts to<br/>
become more effective for soloing.  I still use that combo.<br/>
<br/>
Also Also, how hard is it to get that other level 9 song I heard can<br/>
only be gotten in Luclin, &quot;Magical Monologue&quot;  (of course I&#39;ll have<br/>
to buy the exp first) so that i can save my Platinum and not have to<br/>
buy a magic weapon?<br/>
<br/>
*** Good question.  I got to get me that still.<br/>
<br/>
Also Also Also does the bellow that bards get at lvl 12 affect<br/>
creatures that can only be hit with magic weapons, and does that song<br/>
show you how much dammage you are delivering (whereas the chords of<br/>
disonance only say &quot;Large Spider winces&quot; etc)?<br/>
<br/>
*** Bellow is a magic attack, yes.  I believe a somewhat recent patch added<br/>
the damage done by the song to the text box message.  Something like &quot;A<br/>
large spider was hit by 9 points of non-melee damage&quot;<br/>
