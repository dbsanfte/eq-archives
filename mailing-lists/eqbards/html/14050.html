<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160371161">I&#39;ve used a tentacle whip for a loooooong time... I&#39;m currently working<br/>
toward getting some other weapons myself - my husband is holding a staff of<br/>
writhing for me - for when I get to 28 (that&#39;s the level it will proc,<br/>
right?). And eventually, I hope to have an obsidian shard, but that might be<br/>
a ways off. I finally have a dragoon dirk in my ranged slot, [thanks to a<br/>
guild member who said he just had it rotting away in the bank] - and the<br/>
other weapon I use currently is a water crystal staff. It&#39;s a tad heavy -<br/>
pulls my stamina down unless my enchanting husband is there to cast<br/>
augmentation on me. But the fun thing is this: Frequently in battle, both<br/>
the whip (lifetap-necro spell) and the staff (shallow breath-enchanter<br/>
spell) have proc&#39;d at the same time... quite fun to see both messages &quot;...<br/>
beam a smile... ahh you feel better&quot; and &quot;______ begins to choke&quot;. Guess I&#39;m<br/>
quite the enchanting necro bard... hehe.<br/>
