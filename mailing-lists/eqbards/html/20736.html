<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481129232">All I can say is LoIO.  Charming Icebones and Charbones is easy and they<br/>
always stick on the pet.  They also never run away.  Charming couldn&#39;t be<br/>
easier.  It was amusing to be taking on the whole skeleton tower are at 29.<br/>
A group of 25-26&#39;s came up and asked if I neeed help.  I told them, &quot;Not<br/>
really, just practicing.  If you guys want to take over though I&#39;d be okay<br/>
with that.  Just give a holler if you get in trouble I&#39;ll be running around<br/>
here somewhere.&quot;  They hollered about a minute later when they discovered<br/>
that 3 charbones hit really hard. ;-)<br/>

slaughtering cyclopses in Rathe Mountains with it.<br/>
