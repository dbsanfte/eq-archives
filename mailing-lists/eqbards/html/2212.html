&gt; After spending the day there with my group consisting of a level 19<br/>
&gt; cleric, level 17 cleric, level 21 wiz and 19 ranger, I can honestly say<br/>
&gt; that the jig definitely helps with mana regeneration.  However the one<br/>
&gt; thing we applied yesterday was the wonderful notion of who gets the kill.<br/>
&gt; I honestly believe that there is a major flaw with the way loot/exp<br/>
&gt; is awarded to groups.  While I was camped in the tower it never failed to<br/>
&gt; amaze how the looting rights were assigned.  Many times the party I was in<br/>
&gt; was able to ensure that we got the kill by strictly planning for our wiz<br/>
&gt; to nuke only twice.  It did not matter what anyone else did, only that the<br/>
&gt; wiz nuked twice.  That way he was about to do more damage than anyone<br/>
&gt; person who attacked it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the way it&#39;s designed.  I&#39;ve been giving it a lot of<br/>
thought and think it&#39;d be better if it were changed to some<br/>
combination of damage done plus damage received.  The way it<br/>
is now, nearly all the kills are going to spellcaster types,<br/>
while all the downtime is going to the melee types.  One would<br/>
think that experience should be somewhat proportional to the<br/>
difficulty of the fight, and not awarded when you wait a bit<br/>
for someone else to take all the risk, stand up, fire a couple<br/>
spells, loot, then sit down to med again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got some ideas on how to do this without making it too<br/>
hard on the spellcasters, but need to run them by some friends<br/>
first to check for holes.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  This point was driven home when we had a level 24<br/>
&gt; druid camping steal killing from my group (after I asked her to share the <br/>
&gt; spawns).  She would only cast three spells to steal kill.  Now my group in<br/>
&gt; total would have been ablet to do 600 damage in total(she did about 300<br/>
&gt; damage in total), yet she still got the kill from standing on the window<br/>
&gt; sill.  Does this seem wrong to anyone?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of people are asking that group damage be counted<br/>
together, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s really a good idea.  The way<br/>
it is now, sure an individual can kill steal from a group; but<br/>
at least anyone has a shot (in theory) at getting the kill.  <br/>
No one group can exclude others from a site.  If it were<br/>
changed to group damage, a group *could* exclude others from a<br/>
site, at least until an equivalent group started to compete<br/>
with them.<br/>
