<div id="ygrps-yiv-435433464">Tzeeth: I&#39;ve never been on a Nag raid but I finally got Selo&#39;s drums a<br/>
couple months ago from the Skyfire Dragon. Gore dropped a set last time we<br/>
killed her also. I even saw someone auctioning a set in DL a couple days<br/>
ago. Wish I could recall the name for you. Sebasttian even offered me his<br/>
walrus drum when he got the Selos drums from Gore, not realizing I already<br/>
had Selo&#39;s drums and didn&#39;t lotto on purpose. You&#39;ll get drums, don&#39;t sweat<br/>
it!<br/>
As to keeping vox from Ch&#39;ing, our theory is to have all the tanks on the<br/>
same side to cause her to move. The moving is supposed to interrupt her<br/>
spells. We&#39;ve been susccessful with this the couple times I was along.<br/>
I have heard the spawned Trak is the same as the Real Trak in drops and<br/>
power, but I have not fought him personally.<br/>
AS for epic, I am more concerned now with the lycanthrope skull and phin&#39;s<br/>
backbone. Is the warlord in Karnor&#39;s the only mob that drops the skull? How<br/>
rare a drop is it? I really hate Karnor&#39;s and have put this off too long.<br/>
