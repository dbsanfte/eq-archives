&gt; I&#39;ve recently aquired the much coveted (by me at least) charm song. I&#39;ve<br/>

&gt; get the hang of it, however I&#39;m finding the timing of this song to be<br/>
&gt; something I just can&#39;t grasp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Generally I select a target, Charm, swtich targets and attack, Selo&#39;s, Hymn,<br/>
&gt; they back to charm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, I seem to charm too early every single time, the mob breaks<br/>
&gt; charm and I get beat on for a full cycle while I try to get charm going<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the exact timing depends on your ping time. For<br/>
most folks, that varies from playsession to playsession, so<br/>
you&#39;ll have to adapt to it each time.  You may have to stick<br/>
in a short pause before starting charm, but the pause will<br/>
usually be consistent over the time you&#39;re charming a single<br/>
mob.  When my ping times drop below 150 ms, I can consistently<br/>
get in 3 songs before having to recharm (equivalent to weaving<br/>
4 songs).  Lately it&#39;s been up around 180ms, and trying to get<br/>
3 songs in gives the mobs too much time to reach me.  So I<br/>
just pause a bit before the charm (one... two... charm).<br/>
<br/>
Just be aware that because the server runs on a 6 second<br/>
heartbeat (I&#39;m pretty sure), the timing for the first charm<br/>
will probably be different from subsequent charms.  Also, if<br/>
charm is resisted or the mob breaks out early, the timing for<br/>
that charm cycle will be off again.  Once you get a rhythm<br/>
going, it&#39;s pretty consistent though.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could set up a metronome next to your computer<br/>
to figure the timing more precisely.  :)<br/>
