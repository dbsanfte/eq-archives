<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655996152">heh ya it is sad when you are level 54 and you do not have a single level<br/>
51-54 song even memmed.  sure i will have 55 memmed forever, and i know 57<br/>
replaces VoV, but i don&#39;t even know if i will ever hit 57 at this rate.<br/>
sigh, indeed.<br/>

&gt; again. But i<br/>
&gt; didnt even have enough energy to to scream more about the <br/>
&gt; 54/23 nerf... just<br/>
&gt; getting rapidly fed up with all the crap =(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gendal Concorden, lvl 55... and almost 56 but who cares cause <br/>
&gt; 56&#39;s songs<br/>
&gt; suck. Who has time to check what time it is in Norrath <br/>
&gt; everytime they want<br/>
&gt; to use a song? And its not even like the frickan songs are <br/>
&gt; all that usefull<br/>
&gt; anyways. Sigh... ok.... 57 looks usefull but thats a whole lvl away :( </span></blockquote></div>
