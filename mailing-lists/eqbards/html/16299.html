<div id="ygrps-yiv-879392412">Absolutely!  Pun intended.  I have begun playing a shaman that I role-play<br/>
as a bard as a sidelight.  Its actually pretty fun, Mandolin looks really<br/>
odd in the hands of a barbarian though!  Now if I could just convince them<br/>
to put a /play animation in for it.<br/>

True.. even if they didn&#39;t have magical songs, it&#39;d be cool to sit around a<br/>
campfire healing up, while one of your party members plays a lute (which<br/>
actually played a .mid of a lute or something. :)).<br/>
