<b>Subject:</b> The true history of Lullaby, it&#39;s problems, it&#39;s fixes and it&#39;s nerfs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583955786">&lt;Massive Snip of data with a LOT of assumptions.  (For example many bards<br/>
knew Lulaby was 1 pulse duration since it was fixed from having a 3 pulse<br/>
duration)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok the actual history of Lullaby<br/>
<br/>
1)  In beta the following things were true:<br/>
<br/>
- Lullaby had about a 5% resist rate<br/>
- Lullaby had a 3 tic duration.<br/>
- DoT did not break Mez effects.<br/>
<br/>
This caused bards to be able to derail trains of blue, white and even yellow<br/>
mobs with the following songs:<br/>
CoD, DDD, Lullaby<br/>
BAM buncha dead mobs, no risk to bard.  You could go to Blackburrow and<br/>
level once an hour using this.  Obviously a TAD over powered.<br/>
<br/>
The following change was made:<br/>
Made Lulaby a 1 tic song (Beta 3.5)<br/>
<br/>
Bards still able to derail trains by singing lulaby with weapons and<br/>
slashing mobs to death.  Or 2 bards could work in tandem to derail trains as<br/>
before.  Still way too powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Following change was made in final (STEALTH)<br/>
1)  Added 2nd resist to song (35% base)<br/>
2)  Caused DOTS to break MEZ effects.  (GOOD!)<br/>
<br/>
The problem with Lullaby now is that there was TOO MUCH nerf thrown at it.<br/>
The 2nd resist was thrown in at about the same time they made DOT effects<br/>
break MEZ.  Also the fact that the 2nd resist doesn&#39;t work properly (IE:<br/>
Level and Cha do not affect it at all) causes the spell to be nearly<br/>
worthless.<br/>
<br/>
To Fix Lullaby properly there are 2 options:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Get rid of 2nd resist and make the stringed instrument a requirement<br/>
rather than an option.<br/>
2)  Correct 2nd resist so that charisma and level AND using an instrument<br/>
affect it.<br/>
<br/>
These are the only two options really necessary.  I wouldn&#39;t combine them.<br/>
If you require a lute then the 2nd resist is pointless as it&#39;s only purpose<br/>
was to keep a bard from being able to melee down a train 1 opponent at a<br/>
time and rest up in between.  If the instrument is required there&#39;s no way a<br/>
bard could do enough dmg with his fists to kill even 1 creature, let alone a<br/>
train.<br/>
