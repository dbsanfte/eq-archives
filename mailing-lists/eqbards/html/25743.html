<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933658306">Now that is an interesting theory.  I&#39;m going to have to look into it<br/>
since I&#39;m down to Red Scale, White Scale and Trak Guts for Fflew&#39;s Epic,<br/>
not to mention my main partner Azyre&#39;s Down to White Scale and Trak guts<br/>
for her epic as well.  If that&#39;s the case, any really well coordinated<br/>
guild or raid could potentially take and keep that camp &#39;just in the<br/>
nick of time&#39; and whack Trak at 19 hours after server up and then buff<br/>
and be ready for Undead Bard to spawn Trak for 20 hours after.  Guess<br/>
I&#39;ll be putting Deiele down there to watch closely for the next few<br/>
patches.<br/>

Someone on Concert Hall suggested a theory (actually did a bit of <br/>
watching to come up with it) that the Undead Bard is on a flat 20 <br/>
hour spawn cycle and is KOS to Trakanon.<br/>
