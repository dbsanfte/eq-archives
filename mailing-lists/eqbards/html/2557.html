<div id="ygrps-yiv-539710925">I don&#39;t want to be specific about locations but there are certain creatures <br/>
who get caught in walls when you lure them there and then you can slowly, but <br/>
surely, bellow them to death.  I haven&#39;t done it as much as I wanted to <br/>
because it isn&#39;t worth it anymore as the creatures in question are mostly <br/>
blue to me now but imagine how happy I&#39;d have been to have found this spot <br/>
when they were all red.  My point really is--hold on to your helms, <br/>
RPers--who cares how you get your levels as long as you get them and get on <br/>
to the getting of the cool stuff so you can whip Lord Mistmore?  Oh the <br/>
dismay and anger the purple people showered me with as they watched me <br/>
&quot;cheat&quot;.  Far as I am concerned, playing honorably with an object like a <br/>
computer game is just plain silly.  If the bug wasn&#39;t there I *couldn&#39;t* <br/>
exploit it so therefore it is Verant&#39;s fault, not mine, that I--or anyone <br/>
else for that matter--can use it.  It isn&#39;t cheating.  It is using your head <br/>
to take advantage of an opportunity granted, intentional or otherwise.  <br/>
Bottom line: RPers, generally, are exactly as Shanda said--a bunch of wacko <br/>
powermad control mongers who chastise and harrass &quot;normal&quot;--stress the word <br/>
&quot;normal&quot;--people.  They are like the Bob Barrs of Everquest.  Play how they <br/>
want you to play or they will contact a GM(the granddaddies and epitomy of <br/>
powermad RPers)and bring legislation against you.  This is the only problem I <br/>
have ever found with an otherwise outstanding game.  Purple people mind your <br/>
own freakin&#39; business and quit whining to the GMs every time you see someone <br/>
playing the way your dork ass wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
