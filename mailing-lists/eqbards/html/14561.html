You need a magical weapon.  My recommendation is a Dragoon Dirk.  Great<br/>
stats and I used mine until level 38ish.  You will do well with it as your<br/>
main weapon.  When you get dual wield (Lev 17) you can rethink what you use<br/>
as weapons.  But for now, it&#39;s a great wep for you (40pp to 80pp but worth<br/>
it).  Next, you want stuff (armor or jewelry or items) to increase your<br/>
strength and your AC (armor class). Some things that maybe better than<br/>
banded armor would be bronze armor or barbed armors (shoulders and legs.)<br/>
Also, for your next several levels, you can be fighting snakes and bugs so<br/>
anything that buffs your poison resist will help (Chitin Shield is a good<br/>
one, Snakeskin tunic, Snakefang necklace - things you can wear while killing<br/>
snakes.)  By your high teens and mod 20&#39;s you will want to be getting things<br/>
that buff your magic resists (runed bone fork if you can buy, bloodstained<br/>
mantle.)<br/>
<br/>
So there are some ideas.  Dragoon dirk - never leave home without it. Better<br/>
armor. Poison resist items then magic resist items.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and keep us posted!<br/>

&gt; I am a lvl 12 bardess in Prexus (the most sexy one...), i would like to<br/>
&gt; know what should I get with the 150pp I have in bank. I though about a new<br/>
&gt; weapon(still using a FS scimitar), but I dont know what would the best<br/>
&gt; weapon for that price be. I will probably get a barbed leather whip from a<br/>
&gt; friend, so I may also get some other kind of equipment... Please send me<br/>
&gt; some advice on what should I get. right now I am wearing the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FS scimitar<br/>
&gt; Shinny B Shield<br/>
&gt; Dwarven Ring Tunic<br/>
&gt; Banded legs, arms, shoulder, cape, cap...<br/>
&gt; Purity Belt<br/>
&gt; Spiked collar<br/>
&gt; elf hide gloves<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks a lot<br/>
&gt; Ericka. The sexyest bardess in Prexus :)<br/>
