<b>Subject:</b> RE: switching instrument/ranger slot (Was RE: Skill Caps) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-547211313">The problem with the range slot is that it is there for any bards that want <br/>
to use it (throwing knives, shuriken, daggers, Mino Axes!!)...why any bard <br/>
would want to use it - got me. But it&#39;s there and it will not be changed. <br/>
Doubt Verant will go to the trouble of altering the interface to include a <br/>
slot just for us bards. Would be nice though. Personally, I use my range <br/>
slot to hold a Runed Bone Fork, and I am perfectly happy with it there as it <br/>
is literally about as good as a fork (Spork?) for melee purposes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, if ya send another letter, PLEASE ask them to add a<br/>
&gt; &gt; instrument slot<br/>
&gt; &gt; for us - much like folks using a bow - there is ALREADY a way for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; client to switch them out without having to manually juggle.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Folks with weapons don&#39;t disarm to use a bow - casters don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to disarm<br/>
&gt; &gt; to cast - why do WE have to disarm to go to an instrument? </span></blockquote></div>
