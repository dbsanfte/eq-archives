<div id="ygrps-yiv-786446093">re:  crowding<br/>
<br/>
My highest level character is level 40, but I still think that most of <br/>
the crowding problems that I have are due to a lack of things for high <br/>
level people to do.  When they have too little to do, a lot of them end <br/>
up bailing out of Guk, etc., and choose to do &quot;interesting&quot; things.  <br/>
One example of an &quot;interesting&quot; thing that someone chose to do this <br/>
weekend:  a level 30ish player was in Blackburrow apparently trying to <br/>
see how many MOBs he could kill in as little time as possible.  The <br/>
difference between Blackburrow with 20 players of an appropriate level, <br/>
and Blackburrow with 20 players of an appropriate level and one level 30 <br/>
killing everything in sight is vast.  At another point in the weekend, <br/>
a level 25 or so was helping three level 6-8s power level.  They sure <br/>
were cranking through all the gnolls, and I mean ALL the gnolls.  Same <br/>
problem.  I&#39;m sure it was amusing for these guys, but it really sucked <br/>
for the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Naeeldar makes the point that there are less crowded zones to hunt <br/>
in.  That&#39;s fine for binding classes, but who wants to have to cross six <br/>
zones to retrieve a body?<br/>
