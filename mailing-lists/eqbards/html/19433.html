<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086267704"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Oh I totally agree.  I don&#39;t think the events start out as stupid.  I think<br/>
&gt;the actions of the 40+&#39;s that come in and destroy an event clearly <br/>
&gt;far below<br/>
&gt;their level make them stupid.  I would have thought that Verant would have<br/>
&gt;found a way around this by now.  I can&#39;t imagine that the guides/gms don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;complain about it every time they run one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They do.<br/>
Verant does have tools.<br/>
The players complain about the tools used.<br/>
<br/>
(Killing people that come in and attack.<br/>
Teleporting away disruptive players <br/>
Teleporting away -- and locking in a no-exit/no-teleport room<br/>
...are just a few)<br/>
<br/>
Disruptive players find more ways to disrupt faster than Verant can find<br/>
ways to overcome.<br/>
<br/>
And btw, you can&#39;t lock rooms to under level when its taking place in a<br/>
zone where 1) They have to travel through to get to other zones or 2) They<br/>
can fight stuff in for XP. That&#39;s not fair either.</div>
