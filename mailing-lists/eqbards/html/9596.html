<div id="ygrps-yiv-419798368">Hmm, my run thru Kith was in day time hours.  What is in Kith for 30+?  I<br/>
thought the Invasion was a one time thing for the PoH debut.  <br/>
<br/>
As for faster than anything in Norrath, have you raced Grimfeather lately?<br/>
Granted he&#39;s not in Kith but he&#39;s faster than my MM drums.  Also, Shadowmen<br/>
are faster as well - I have heard.<br/>
<br/>
What fun is it if you are not scared? (The whole game I mean.) <br/>

		Kithicor scary?? Errr.....I always thought Kith was pretty<br/>
damn boring. As<br/>
		for scary, who is scared when you are running faster than<br/>
anything else in<br/>
		Norrath can.<br/>
<br/>
		Kith rocks now. Great outdoor zone for lvl 30+. It&#39;s about<br/>
time.</div>
