&gt;Aren&#39;t all exploits caused by a lack of attention to detail on the <br/>
&gt;developer&#39;s part? :)<br/>

&gt;This was just more obvious than most.  As soon as I heard there was an <br/>
&gt;exploit involving this<br/>
&gt;NPC, it took me about 2 seconds to guess what it was.  You&#39;d think it might <br/>
&gt;occur to a developer<br/>
&gt;before it went to live servers.  :(<br/>
