&gt; Oh its worse than that from what I see.  Looks like Lullaby has two effects,<br/>
&gt; a stun and a mez? and the second resist is from the mez.  On higher level<br/>
&gt; mobs I&#39;d expect it nearly never works as there will be three! saves.  I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t imagine why this song is nerfed this badly.  It must be really tough<br/>
&gt; to use at levels over 35.<br/>

for this second save.  It works correctly with Pixie Strike -<br/>
the &quot;your target resists your attempt to mesmerize it&quot; message<br/>
only starts to become common against L35+ mobs.  He may have<br/>
tried to copy it over for Lullaby, tweak it for Lullaby being<br/>
a lower level song, and screwed up there resulting in L1 mobs<br/>
resisting as if they were L40+.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try it on some high level mobs (assuming I survive :).<br/>
