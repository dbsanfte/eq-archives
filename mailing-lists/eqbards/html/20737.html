<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322217751">That&#39;s hysterical!  We have a druid guildmate who refuses to SoW or bind<br/>
anyone who does not give him libations first.  He claims that without the<br/>
proper offering of wine,  the gods may not favor his spell.  If they<br/>
continue to whine, he says ok I&#39;ll try and then casts a damage spell on<br/>
them.  When they get the &quot;protected&quot; message, he sighs and tells them that<br/>
the gods will not let him give them the spell without the proper libations<br/>
first.  I&#39;ve seen several people walk away convinced that this was indeed<br/>
the case and return later with new-bought alcohol.<br/>

less than appreciative:<br/>
<br/>
Warrior: SOW me please<br/>
Fenryr: &quot;Thows a handful of bones on the ground and<br/>
studies them carefully&quot; -- Spirits say give elven wine<br/>
first.<br/>
Warrior: I don&#39;t have any<br/>
Fenryr: Then you must qet some.  The spirits are not<br/>
to be taken lightly.<br/>
Warrior: *&%^!!!<br/>
Fenryr: &lt;shrugs&gt; The Spirits demand elven wine.<br/>
/e warrior finds a druid and asks for SOW<br/>

&gt; My rogue denies being a rogue.  This will be easier<br/>
&gt; as I get more changes of<br/>
&gt; armor/weapons, but for now she usually claims to be<br/>
&gt; a ranger who hasn&#39;t had<br/>
&gt; funding enough to purchase spells.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My bard is an entertainer and world observer.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not uncommon to see her<br/>
&gt; chatting about forests with dark elves or jumping up<br/>
&gt; and and landing in a<br/>
&gt; split while playing her lute with her teeth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; All my characters have a thing about beggars.  I<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; begging takes away from the game.  Terrok and<br/>
&gt; Fenryr<br/>
&gt; &gt; never give anything away, Tyunes likes to surprise<br/>
&gt; &gt; young bards with hand-me-down items.  Ask and you<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t get. Offer to buy or just be polite and<br/>
&gt; Tyunes<br/>
&gt; &gt; will normally help out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Same here.  I given beggars foraged grubs and<br/>
&gt; offered to teach them how to<br/>
&gt; fish though.<br/>
