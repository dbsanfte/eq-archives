&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) Reinstating characters but wiping out all their items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Heard that they tried a load from tape and it brought back all the GM Buffed<br/>
&gt;& Itemized Level 60 chars from the Kunark beta as well. (more on that<br/>
&gt;below.)  It restored every character recently created not just current<br/>
&gt;characters or something like that.  On live servers they are able to restore<br/>
&gt;chars from tapes they keep.  Not sure of the current cycle but about 6<br/>
&gt;months ago a friend got restored but the save point was from a few days<br/>
&gt;previous.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on a test server, i doubt they make tape backups of characters as often as<br/>
on live servers.  and why should they go through all that trouble for just a test<br/>
server?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I can understand their reasons for going ahead with the wipe, but it still<br/>
&gt; &gt; stinks nonetheless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It stinks - big time!  Think about this happening on a live server or on all<br/>
&gt;live servers. I guess that is why they have a test server but it also points<br/>
&gt;out (yet again) the woefull lack of professionalism in Verant&#39;s procedures.<br/>
&gt;Are they no more than a bunch of &quot;Cowboy Coders&quot; ??? They can&#39;t even do<br/>
&gt;reliable tape back-ups??? Here is a valuable resource - test server and the<br/>
&gt;testers.  The design of the game is such that you need to invest large<br/>
&gt;amounts of time to get to high levels. To go for a year and allow folks to<br/>
&gt;build their chars and test the new things without adequate protection is<br/>
&gt;simply gross negligence.  To say &quot;its just a test environment and you knew<br/>
&gt;that you could be pwiped at any given time without notice...&quot; is just<br/>
&gt;legalise B.S. to cover their ass for their own incompetance.  I can see that<br/>
&gt;level of  error allowable on in-house, alpha level environment or even<br/>
&gt;closed beta.  To have run the closed beta on the test server - was a huge<br/>
&gt;error on their part (thank you 20-20 hind site) but it smacks of their<br/>
&gt;&quot;penny-wise, pound-foolish&quot; attitude.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hint:  it didn&#39;t happen on a live server.  i&#39;m sure they do reliable tape backups<br/>
on LIVE servers.  I have heard many stories of people getting character restores<br/>
when they needed it on the live servers.  i&#39;m not sure how valuable a resource you<br/>
can say these testers are, especially when a huge bug went in, and they didn&#39;t<br/>
report it, they went and farmed it.  i think a lot of the players moved there just<br/>
because they wanted to play on an uncrowded server and don&#39;t bother reporting<br/>
bugs and problems.  i don&#39;t understand why running the closed beta on the test<br/>
server was a &#39;&#39;huge error&#39;&#39;.  it seems to me that it was the perfect place to run the beta.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If the test server and the testers there are truly valuable resources, then<br/>
&gt;they should have had adequate safeguards in place to allow them to recover<br/>
&gt;their test world to a previous save point.  This really hurts they<br/>
&gt;credibility and shows what little respect they have for testers who are<br/>
&gt;helping them.  Imagine how they regard the ones who merely play the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if the players on test were truly testers, there for the sake of testing the code, then<br/>
i would agree.  since they are not, it hurts the players&#39; credibility, not verant&#39;s.<br/>
