asked of the bard (7 point heal vs. 100+ point damage),<br/>
compared to debatable requests of the shaman.  Whether you<br/>
malaise or slowdown first really does depend on the mob,<br/>
amount of mana, party makeup, etc.  In general, I tend to<br/>
trust the judgement of the player who&#39;s played the class; but<br/>
then, I have a pretty sharp circle of friends that I group<br/>
with.  Pickup groups OTOH tend to be frustrating at times.<br/>

Btw, has anyone figured out which resist sonic bat stun works<br/>
against?<br/>

&gt; taunt as heal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  I have seen an enchanter turn a battle with one memory<br/>
blur.  Taunt/damage management is an important part of the<br/>
battle that, sadly, most people neglect.  The people who end<br/>
up dying when the taunts go wrong (bards, healers) seem to be<br/>
hyper-sensitive to it, while other classes are often<br/>
completely ignorant of it.<br/>
<br/>
Either playing a different class, or discussing tactics in<br/>
depth with someone who does, can really help you learn the dos<br/>
and don&#39;ts.  I&#39;ve made some dumb-ass suggestions to other<br/>
players based on (IMHO reasonable) assumptions, only to have<br/>
the player tell me that no, that&#39;s not the way it works.  You<br/>
feel stupid and embarassed for a bit, but you end up the<br/>
better player for it.<br/>
