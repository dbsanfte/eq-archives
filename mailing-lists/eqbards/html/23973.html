<div id="ygrps-yiv-93341223">Only a fool would make the argument that all bards are posted here.  That is<br/>
so totally ludicrous as to almost be unanswerable if it were not so<br/>
offensive.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone can see that there are three pvp servers, each on the lower end of<br/>
the population base and easily determine how many people at any one time are<br/>
playing in a potential pvp environment.  Even if those people were all<br/>
playing pvp all the time and never playing pve, their number would still be<br/>
insignificant compared to the overall number of players.<br/>
<br/>
Get a clue, this is NOT a pvp game except for a very, very, very, tiny<br/>
minority.<br/>

<br/>
ok, how many people out of the total subscribers play bards?  by the numbers<br/>
posted here, less than 5%.  by your argument, then bards and their issues<br/>
are <br/>
insignificant because less than 5% of the people who play everquest are<br/>
affected.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s only insignificant if you&#39;re not the one it&#39;s affecting.<br/>
