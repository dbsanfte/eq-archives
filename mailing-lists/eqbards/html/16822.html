  Dirge = cute and useless, nuff said, thx.<br/>

  You remind me a lot of myself when I started posting here.<br/>
  Have to prove everyone wrong.  Have to be all-knowing.  Except,<br/>
  Shada, I always am all-knowing with her.  I mean how smart can<br/>
  a female woodelf be?  /chuckle<br/>
<br/>
  Plus, anyone who cannot make their point without capitalizing a <br/>
  word in every sentance REALLY is irritating because it LOOKS like <br/>
  you are SHOUTING at someone because you are ANGRY.  It&#39;s the equivalent<br/>
  of debating with someone over a topic and then resorting to voice<br/>
  escalation to flood your point across.  The best debates I receive<br/>
  come from: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jhenders@...">jhenders@...</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kim@...">kim@...</a>.  They use<br/>
  proper grammar, they can spell, and they never ever raise their<br/>
  voice (so to speak) in the emails.  Sometimes, I wish I could have<br/>
  the composure they do.<br/>
<br/>
  Need to break out my procmail filters again, and run my eqbards mail<br/>
  through a program that to_lowers everything   /sigh  =(<br/>
