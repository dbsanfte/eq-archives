<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895175073">A.	The quest you refer to is not the one for the level 30 song. Vhalen hides<br/>
another secret...<br/>
<br/>
B.	Of what I understand these are either a quest or an unfinished trade<br/>
skill.<br/>
<br/>
C.	I think that&#39;s just the MIDI song that you hear whenever you play a song<br/>
with the correct instrument. I hear the same thing when I strap on the drums<br/>
and run.<br/>
<br/>
D.	I wholeheartedly agree with Hotkeying inventory. I learned it back at 17<br/>
when I got dual wield and have used it ever since.<br/>
<br/>
E.	I highly recommend this for the out of the way places like Erudin,<br/>
Kelethin, High Hold, etc. Making the run to other continents (especially<br/>
Faedwyr) frequently can make you a gray haired bard in a hurry.<br/>
<br/>
F.	Can&#39;t comment on the song much. I&#39;ve only played it once...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

I play a 17th level Bard Named Radia on the Cazic-Thule Server.  Here are<br/>
some of my bardic thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
A:  (Spoiler) The quest from Vahlen Nostrolo does not seem to yeild the<br/>
Level 30 song.  I have completed this quest twice, both times at 16th<br/>
level.<br/>
The first time a non-bard group member gave Nostrolo the items he needs.<br/>
In<br/>
return he got Chords of Dissonance, the second level Song.  When I<br/>
completed<br/>
the quest again on my own I recieved the Locating Lyric the 4th level song.<br/>
It is concievable that a 30th level Bard completing this quest may get the<br/>
song, but It seems unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
B:  I was wondering about the instrument pieces.  I have asked many bards<br/>
if<br/>
they were able to assemble them to make a Lute or a trumpet or something<br/>
and<br/>
never recieved an affirmative.  I had an idea that a Gnomes Tinker Skill<br/>
may<br/>
be able to be used to put the pieces together.  I talked to one Gnome who<br/>
thought it might work, but have not found a Gnome and tried it yet.  Gnomes<br/>
get tinker at level 16.  But this might be a way to assemble a trumpet or<br/>
perhaps an enhanced Lute.  Of course it is likely to just produce a normal<br/>
Lute one can buy in a store.  If anyone actually does assemble these pieces<br/>
please let us know.<br/>
<br/>
C:  Often when I play my songs my music sounds very strange.  I was<br/>
wondering if any others have experienced this.  It definately sounds as if<br/>
my Mandolin is out of tune, which would give credence to the usefullness of<br/>
Lute Tuners.  But the effects still seem to work full power.  When I ask my<br/>
groupmates if they hear any strange sounding music none has ever had their<br/>
sound enabled.  I am just wondering if other bards have heard this or if it<br/>
is just a sound problem with my Machine.  I have no other sound problems<br/>
and<br/>
the music sounds exactly like a mis-tuned instrument so I was wondering if<br/>
this is a feature of the game telling me to buy a new Mandolin or<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
D:  As others have mentioned set up your hotkeys for quick instrument<br/>
Switching.  It shall make you a much better bard for your group and<br/>
yourself.  The melee weapon slots and general slots can be turned into<br/>
buttons and dragged onto a blank hot key.  Takes about 5 blanks to set it<br/>
up<br/>
nice for easy switching.  Doing this means you shall never have to pop up<br/>
the inventory screen to switch instruments.  MAkes it trivial to switch to<br/>
Mandolin for healing even half a bubble worth.<br/>
<br/>
E:  Buy  songs in advance.  The songs we get are scattered all over.  Buy<br/>
the songs only available in your city levels in advance before you leave to<br/>
go get new songs.  Just store them in the bank.  This makes it so you do<br/>
not<br/>
have to travel back to Kelethin or Erudin to get your song.  Plan in<br/>
Advance, it is not that hard to do.<br/>
<br/>
F:  The 14th Identify (Catalogue) song is not that useful as we know.<br/>
Before it was changed in the last patch though it did give me one piece of<br/>
information out of all the times I have used it.  When I identified a<br/>
Griffon Feather it had a listing of<br/>
Skill:  Archery<br/>
I found this interesting.  I am not a fletcher, but perhaps Griffon<br/>
feathers<br/>
can be used somehow.  I have no idea, besides the clue given with the<br/>
Identify.  After this weeks patch though the Identify song gives even less<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Bards Rule.  Good Luck All.<br/>
<br/>
Prosper,<br/>
