&gt;When I experimented with mesh armor a few weeks ago, wisps<br/>
&gt;that normally dinged me for 1-2 points (with the occasional<br/>
&gt;10-20) in plate were hitting me for 20 points regularly.  I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know if this was due to the type of armor, or because in<br/>
&gt;mesh my AC was 50 points lower.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The type of armor does make a difference. I group with a monk on a regular <br/>
basis (in a 40-ish group) and he routinely takes full damage WHEN he is hit. <br/>
I take full damage maybe half the time (unless my luck is running short =).<br/>
<br/>
This was a big issue toward the end of phase 3 beta. I played a wizard and <br/>
was able to actually tank better than many of my cleric buddies until Verant <br/>
changed the rules of armor, and I quote one of the dev guys in chat after <br/>
that particular patch: &quot;I got sick of casters in their paper suits tanking, <br/>
that was not our original intent&quot;. I was stunned and very humbled by this <br/>
change, and very quickly learned to keep myself out of the front lines <br/>
shortly thereafter. =)<br/>
<br/>
A bard friend of mine who was outfitted in full platewas pulled aside by a <br/>
GM to test the changes in the armor code. The GM gave him various sets of <br/>
armor to try out and would sic critters on him to see the effects of damage. <br/>
The difference between leather and plate was like night and day, and in my <br/>
opinion still is.<br/>
