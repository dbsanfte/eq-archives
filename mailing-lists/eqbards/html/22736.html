<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394257829">Haven&#39;t been following this thread as I had yet to get the song.  Well, now<br/>
I have it :op  One thing of note, this song *requires* a stringed<br/>
instrument.  I am glad to see that at least the healing part stacks.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Cantata of Soothing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;From what I have read, it has been confirmed that the new 34 song does<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; stack with Hymn.  There have been conflicting reports on the Concert Hall<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; it stacks with Clarity or not.  You get message that both songs went into<br/>
&gt; effect, but some folks have stated they didn&#39;t see any noticeable<br/>
difference<br/>
&gt; in mana regen.  Anyone know for certain if Soothing and Clarity will<br/>
stack?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also what happens when you have two bards in the group?  If both bards<br/>
sing<br/>
&gt; the 34 song, will you get double the effect?  I gotta feeling that it will<br/>
&gt; work like Hymn and not stack if both bards are singing it.  Whats gonna<br/>
suck<br/>
&gt; is if it 1) won&#39;t stack with another bard singing the 34 song AND 2)<br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stack with Clarity.  If this is the case, then the two bards would have to<br/>
&gt; go back to both singing Clarity.<br/>
