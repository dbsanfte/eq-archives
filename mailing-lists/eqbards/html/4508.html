&gt; To All Bards Out There,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Im in desperate need of some info here. I myself has a natural curiosity<br/>
&gt; about new things. So my Bard character has an even greater on new and<br/>
&gt; interesting items. With that in mind, I would appreciate any info on how to<br/>
&gt; obtain the followin items. Electrum Bladed Wakazashi (Very disappointed<br/>
&gt; that the Lute quest doesn&#39;t work, even tho I&#39;m not nearly high nuff to try<br/>
&gt; for it yet) Short Sword of the Ykesha (which mob and where drops this item?<br/>
&gt; I heard its in Upper Guk?) Mithril Armor (Where and how I find any of these<br/>
&gt; pieces) Adamantite Armor(Double for this info I like to know if its better<br/>
&gt; than Mithril).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ps. I think I&#39;m gonna just roll on stocks and Not get a Last name to be<br/>
&gt; unique =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks To all in Advance,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have quite a while before even attempting to get the Short Sword of<br/>
the Ykesha.  It is found on a level 50ish ghoul lord down in lower guk,<br/>
and he is quite hard.  Surrounded by 2 level 48 guards = one hell of a<br/>
fight.  Mithril is found in solusek B, and you also have to be high<br/>
level to get that.  Adamantite.. i just know of epolets which are good<br/>
for casters but not bards.  I&#39;d suggest you wait a bit before trying<br/>
this stuff =)<br/>
