<b>Subject:</b> LORE Item looting change <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-705719586">This is something I heard mention of them changing, since people were<br/>
destroying lore items by picking them up while already having on in the bank<br/>
or in a pack.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to clean up after yourselves you could always destroy the one<br/>
you&#39;re carrying, and then pick up the next... but, the mobs should disapear<br/>
in 3 minutes.... I haven&#39;t timed this, but I seem to remember Verant stating<br/>
this going into effect.<br/>
<br/>
Not ALL quest items are NO DROP.  The shadow ball and patch from the<br/>
shadowmen used for Wizards quests are definately not no drop.  And the<br/>
Lambent stones aren&#39;t either.  Was lucky enough to have a level 39 Bard<br/>
friend help my gf (30 mage) and me (26 Bard) kill HG&#39;s.  Was a GREAT change<br/>
from camping MM and Unrest and dying 3 times a night.  I died once to a HG<br/>
and it was probably the most fun I had dying yet.  : )<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On the subject of Lambent quest components, I noticed that the LORE items<br/>
&gt;that I found last night in Cazic off of Alligators were not able to be<br/>
&gt;looted PERIOD if you already had such an item in your inventory.  In<br/>
&gt;particular the Alligators were dropping a &quot;Stein&quot; and a &quot;Shovel&quot;, both were<br/>
&gt;ALL/ALL and had NO stat bonuses.  Obviously quest items.  They were<br/>
 </span></blockquote>frequent<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;drops too.  After everyone in our group had a &quot;Stein&quot; and a &quot;Shovel&quot; we<br/>
&gt;simply couldn&#39;t loot the alligators anymore and instead received messages<br/>
&gt;saying something along the lines of &#39;You already have one such item in your<br/>
&gt;inventory!&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SO - If it is the case across the board that LORE items, once looted by an<br/>
&gt;individual, cannot be looted (or even destroyed!) off of a mob by that same<br/>
&gt;individual, you are going to see a LOT of free lore item calls from groups<br/>
&gt;camping things like the Lizzy Fanatics in Cazic (mudwater runes).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again, my group left a trail of Alligators with Steins and Shovels on them<br/>
&gt;because we COULDN&#39;T loot or destroy these items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone else encountered this LORE item behavior?<br/>
