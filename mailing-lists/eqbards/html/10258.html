&gt; I had an odd experience with training or not training duel wield.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hit level 17 and decided to head back to Kelethin to pick my new song. I<br/>
&gt; knew that I could now use duel wield and that I probably need to point<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; it for it to work, but I forgot to train in Freeport before I left, and<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; when I arrived at Kelethin I forgot to train  there as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now back in Freeport I went to the guild intent on putting some points<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; duel wield before I returned to hunting in Oasis. But to my surprise when<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; scrolled down to duel wield in the skills window I did not see the<br/>
&gt; friendly<br/>
&gt; &quot;no charge&quot; text, but a charge of 1 plat 3 gold. Hmmm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So off I went to oasis, equipped my dwarven axe and combine longsword and<br/>
&gt; proceeded to pound crocs..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have become better at duel wield (35)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I am stumped. I never tried to use two weapons before, didn&#39;t train it,<br/>
&gt; and all of a sudden I am starting out with a skill of 34.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

put into it, starts you at skill 15.  Apparently, at least for this it&#39;s<br/>
2xlevel(maybe for everything also).  A long time ago, I had heard that for<br/>
duel wield, all you had to do was zone, and you automatically gained your<br/>
duel wield skill, I think I tried it and it worked.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well you are able to live without putting a asingle point into the<br/>
&gt; skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It will take forever to get the first few points through actually using<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  I tried to do begging from scratch while waiting for the boat.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think I had to hit that button about 200-300 times before I got the<br/>
&gt; &gt; begging(1) message.  What can I say I took the boat a lot in my youth<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the days when there was only one boat travelling from Butcherblock<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport ^_^.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; like many skills (e.g. warrior&#39;s double attack) i thought we had to<br/>
&gt; put<br/>
&gt; 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; skill point into duel wield to learn the basics.  could be wrong<br/>
&gt; though<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hehe.<br/>
