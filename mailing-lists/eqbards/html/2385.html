command to get yourself out of it without dying.  However, I am not a <br/>
hardcore roleplayer.<br/>
<br/>
A hardcore roleplayer would recognize that a boat crash is one of the <br/>
natural disasters of Norrath, and would play around it.  You ended up<br/>
lost in OOT?  Well, start swimming.  Swim for a few hours, or even days.<br/>
Maybe you will find an island where the boat stops.  Maybe you will die.<br/>
If you die, then you come back to OOT, use your corpse location song to<br/>
find your body, note the direction from a known starting point, retrieve<br/>
it and return.  (Actually, if you&#39;re a real hardcore roleplayer, you die<br/>
and start a new character.  This business about restarting at a binding<br/>
point after dying is simply a game artifact to make the game more playable.<br/>
From a roleplaying standpoint, it&#39;s an abomination.)<br/>
<br/>
However, since the poster already admitted that he petitioned GMs for help<br/>
(another roleplaying abomination) and he asked for advice on this list<br/>
(another roleplaying abomination), I can only assume that he does not fall<br/>
into this hardcore roleplayer camp, and really just wants to get back to<br/>
enjoying the game, with as little frustration as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Can there really be any true hardcore roleplayers reading this list?  The<br/>
knowledge that is disseminated here is not knowledge that your character<br/>
should have access to.  The game provides a roleplaying mechanism for the<br/>
exchange of knowledge: travel the world and speak to your fellow bards.<br/>
This list is simply an expedience for those of us who want a shortcut to<br/>
getting better at the game, roleplaying issues aside.<br/>
