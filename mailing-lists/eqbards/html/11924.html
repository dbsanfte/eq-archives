		Unfortunately, the training stuff away from the zone line<br/>
doesnt work,<br/>
		matter of fact, it seems to have the opposite effect. Quite<br/>
a few people on<br/>
		tunare had the same idea and yeah, i got picked for train<br/>
duty. I was quite<br/>
		happy to do it though if it ment an easier breakin for<br/>
everybody else. I<br/>
		basically did everything you suggested except i had no invis<br/>
(the idea was<br/>
		to attract attention, not avoid it) and the end results<br/>
where disastrous. I<br/>
		tried doing several patterns, sometimes running in circls<br/>
around the gate<br/>
		hill and then running far off, othertimes just tagging the<br/>
stuff inbetween<br/>
		the corner and the impt tower... etc. All of em resulted in<br/>
the same thing,<br/>
		one full zone of uber pissed mobs looking for something to<br/>
kill. It just<br/>
		made a big backlash that fell back with a mighty THWACK on<br/>
anybody that<br/>
		tried to zone it or was in the corner. I lived plenty long<br/>
enough to get<br/>
		stuff far away, matter of fact i made it to cazic himself<br/>
all but once<br/>
		(tried punching him but everytime i got close he dt&#39;d me<br/>
heh). Several<br/>
		other people tried this including big ogre warriors, troll<br/>
sk&#39;s etc. End<br/>
		result was all the same, just stirred everything up with out<br/>
sufficiently<br/>
		clearing the corner/gate hill. I have a tutorial for safely<br/>
entering the<br/>
		PoF at<br/>

		pic, basically just a bunch of common sense.  My bard and<br/>
necro both have a<br/>
		flawless zone in record to the pof, and the bard got his<br/>
full suit of<br/>
		imbrued before verant moved it to scorn banshees in the PoH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		I wish the train method worked, and i am not completly<br/>
ruling it out, if<br/>
		you can figure out a way of making it work please SHARE =)<br/>
