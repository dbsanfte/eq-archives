<div id="ygrps-yiv-891865720">My experience with Largo&#39;s is that it is safe to sing in dungeon settings.<br/>
The radius of the AE is small enough that it will only effect the mobs you<br/>
are attacking.  I have never noticed it aggroing mobs thru walls or in rooms<br/>
above/below you.  I don&#39;t think the z-axis bug comes into play with this<br/>
song.  I have this song memmed all the time when there is a ranger/druid or<br/>
when there is no shaman in the group.<br/>

Is Largo&#39;s safe in Dalnir&#39;s?  I was hesitant to use it given the three<br/>
levels in Dalnir&#39;s.  Has anyone else had this song causing mobs to teleport<br/>
to them or cast on them from different levels?</div>
