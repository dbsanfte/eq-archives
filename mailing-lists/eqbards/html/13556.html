<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112142135">In a low lvl way I agree with you on the soemtimes ignored newer<br/>
players.  A few things have troubled me:  The Paw change may have helped<br/>
the high levels, though I&#39;m not exactly hearing rave reviews about the<br/>
new Paw.  As a young character I loved Paw, our group&#39;s best night was<br/>
there, but it was switched before our next session, so we never go tto<br/>
go back.<br/>
<br/>
I realize it was under used by young players, but none the less, other<br/>
than dervs, it was the best place I knew for lvl 12-15 groups to go for<br/>
money. (and we are the ones who actually need the money).  <br/>
<br/>
This is a small thing, but part of a bigger problem.  Dragons been made<br/>
harder, I see they&#39;re thinking.  Certain guild have gotten really good<br/>
at killing them and its become easy.  What happens in June of 2045 when<br/>
my guild is ready to take on a dragon for the first time?  We wont have<br/>
a shot in hell.<br/>
<br/>
I will never be able to get any of these items which are taken out of<br/>
the game because they are too powerful.  I won&#39;t have the chance to<br/>
build up my finances before these money sinks destroy them..<br/>
<br/>
Stuff like this worries me.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I still like the game, though I&#39;m having more trouble (now<br/>
that I left oasis and derv camps) finding a decent group (or any at<br/>
all).  THis is a real problem for a player on the slow boat to levels. <br/>
Any decent players (at least that I find) tend to play almost every day<br/>
and level much faster than I (playing my bard twice a week if lucky).  I<br/>
was on the verge of abandoning my bard for a solo class this weekend (go<br/>
back to my magician I guess).  The killer straw for me was a monk who<br/>
was looting while a waizard and I died right next to her.  I get back to<br/>
my bind (4 zones away, ugh) ang I get the group message &quot;Sorry guys, I<br/>
could just not et them off you&quot;.  I dont think I ever clicked disband<br/>
faster.<br/>
<br/>
I know we talked about groups last week (I found it fun to hear some<br/>
other group idiot stories), does anyone have any suggestions for a<br/>
decent way to get groups for someone who plays too little to get a<br/>
regular group?<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
