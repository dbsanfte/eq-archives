<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899794674">I accidentally erased the message, but in response to Harmonic&#39;s <br/>
statement that he killed 15 this weekend and didn&#39;t get a helm, hence his <br/>
&quot;sorry Kenross&quot; remark.  Aaaaarghhh!  (hehe)<br/>
<br/>
Looks like I may be stuck doing this one this weekend, when I get back!  <br/>
btw, although my experience is limited to Innoruuk, I think this applies <br/>
to other servers (from my observation of the notes on here):  I really <br/>
like how this class sticks together and helps each other out.  I&#39;ve done <br/>
a lot of favors for younger Bards, and I&#39;ve had a lot of favors done for <br/>
me by older Bards (some of them used to be the younger ones, <br/>
embarrassingly enough...)  I don&#39;t really see the same kinship when <br/>
playing my other characters (warrior, shaman, enchantress).<br/>
<br/>
I check three things when I get on:<br/>
- my friends list<br/>
- my guild attendance<br/>
- what bards are on in my level range<br/>
<br/>
Kenross Cantoforjado, 40 songs, Innoruuk<br/>
(Getting to be quite a few level 50 bards on here)</div>
