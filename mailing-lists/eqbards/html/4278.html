<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217329917">I was playing an alternate character (Erudite Wizard) 12th level.  Me and my<br/>
shaman buddy were bumpin around on Wisp Island and I ran into a bard of 13th<br/>
level who we grouped with, after about 5 min the &quot;light&quot; went on, The Jig!<br/>
So I grabbed my handy (never once used) stopwatch.  3 bubbles of mana regen<br/>
with:<br/>
<br/>
No Song:  170 sec         standard<br/>
Jig singing:  149 sec     12.35%<br/>
Jig with drum 138 sec   18.82%<br/>
<br/>
I did this test twice just for some repitition.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I intend to meet my shaman buddy with my 20+ level bard and do similar tests<br/>
to see if level, singing ability, percussion ability make a difference.<br/>

P.S. - I had always thought it was really in my friends head when they<br/>
always wanted me to play the jig even over restoration, but I guess not.<br/>

&gt;Greetings all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that nobody seems to know how Jaxan&#39;s Jig can be helpful...<br/>
&gt;one of the websites mentioned that it increases the recovery pulse rate for<br/>
&gt;all three bars (not just stamina) from approximately 8sec/pulse to 6<br/>
&gt;sec/pulse.  So what? Well, what this means is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana<br/>
&gt;regen<br/>
&gt;  (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>
&gt;- If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should<br/>
&gt;increase at the<br/>
&gt;  same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even<br/>
&gt;more critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this<br/>
&gt;information, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;even try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still<br/>
&gt;an upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of<br/>
&gt;Jaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-)<br/>
