<div id="ygrps-yiv-900204015">Yes, you will also notice that GZ informed Baelish of caster&#39;s Realm that if<br/>
indeed a bug was allowing the new necro mez to give a full stun occasionally<br/>
it would be fixed immediately!  They have no intention of allowing any<br/>
beneficial bug to exist any longer than it takes them to fix it, but<br/>
obviously bugs which cause our songs to seem to be successful but have no<br/>
effect will go unfixed until we figure out some way to exploit them to our<br/>
benefit.  Am I missing something here?  Apparently Verant has the<br/>
misconception that the Mobs in their program are the customers.<br/>

&gt; Um. I would not call this &quot;going to any length&quot; That warp has been there a<br/>
&gt; LONG time. I am glad to see it finally fixed.<br/>
&gt; Also, they probably have differentprogrammers working on different things.<br/>
<br/>
Yes that&#39;s Brad&#39;s standard excuse. However, even if we grant this, we<br/>
still have to ask when the programmer that&#39;s working on the other zone<br/>
warping bugs, and the zone bounceback bug between qhills and w karana is<br/>
going to finally finish his fix. After all, both these bugs have been<br/>
there and reported since beta. Maybe they could assign those bugs to the<br/>
programmer who is so diligent and fast at fixing those bugs that<br/>
actually are slightly convenient to players instead of the bugs that<br/>
completely disconvenience and annoy players. <br/>
