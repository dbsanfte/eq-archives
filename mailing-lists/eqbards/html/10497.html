<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712572437">I gotta agree with and disagree with you!  Your advice on where to go for<br/>
him is good.  His problem seems to be finding friends to play with.  Stay<br/>
out of Sol-A - yes - especially if you do not have a good group.  Even if<br/>
you do - lo to mid 20&#39;s can be bad if you go to the wrong places.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know where the easy places are.  When my group went (former group I shud say<br/>
- they are all hi 40&#39;s now and &lt;snif sniff&gt; I am stuck in 36 =( ), we tried<br/>
the bar room at 28ish and got spanked badly (cleric, bard, de sk,<br/>
necro/enchanter, troll war, ranger).  Later, when we were lo 30&#39;s and had<br/>
more experience in knowing what to clear first etc. we could take and hold<br/>
these rooms fine and get good xp and good loots. <br/>
<br/>
So, SOL-A seems good to me - hard yes, but once you hit the &#39;prime&#39; level<br/>
it&#39;s good. I see these low to mid 20&#39;s running in and out and wonder where<br/>
they are going - I guess I need to explore it more.<br/>
<br/>
Dungeons you do in groups and try to be at the prime level - too young and<br/>
you get spanked; too old and there is no xp and maybe still get spanked by<br/>
trains of greenies.  Solo, well you need to be pretty powerfull so that<br/>
rules bards out unless you are really way above the mobs and still trains of<br/>
greenies can kill you.<br/>

		Hmm..<br/>
<br/>
		Befallen would still be decent experience at your level if<br/>
you were in a<br/>
		group and fighting on the third floor.<br/>
<br/>
		I&#39;d recommend that you stay outta Sol A. <br/>
<br/>
		What that says to me is that the place is<br/>
		slightly misdesigned.  The level of the creatures is like<br/>
10-20% tougher<br/>
		than they should be.  If they would tweak this zone down<br/>
just a tiny little<br/>
		bit it would be vastly more popular.</div>
