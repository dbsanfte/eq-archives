<div id="ygrps-yiv-274599110">Greetings and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I sure wish you were asking advice on where to go for good experience or<br/>
some tips on Highhold Pass or a fun quest to be doing.  Going for a Mask of<br/>
the Deceiver at level 15 is something I would not recommend doing.  Yes, it<br/>
can be done. And yes there are younger bards that do it.  But 9 times out of<br/>
10, these bards are 2nd characters of experienced players who know where and<br/>
when to go. So, my first bit of advice to you is: don&#39;t bother until you are<br/>
30ish.  There&#39;s lots of other stuff to do and the mask has no real benefit<br/>
to you.<br/>
<br/>
But if you really really really wanna go...<br/>
<br/>
1. yes, go naked or at least commando. Lute or mandolin so you look like a<br/>
bard, drum so you can run.<br/>
<br/>
1.b. get a bind in east freeport and make your runs from there. that way you<br/>
dont have to deal with feerott, bouncers and all the spectres i&#39;ll be<br/>
trainning to the zone &lt;g&gt; (ok, watch out for specs in oasis too but at least<br/>
its not as dark there)<br/>
<br/>
2. gifts to bear: food and drink.  the more exotic the better. alcoholic<br/>
beverages. the more exotic the better. the campers there will have tons more<br/>
plat than you can offer them but will prolly be out of food and water and<br/>
bored as hell.<br/>
<br/>
3.  get a map of upper guk and basically follow the right side of the<br/>
dungeon to the zone to the dead side.  if you zone in - be ready to zone out<br/>
if there is a train.  from the south ro zone into the swamp - follow the<br/>
wall on the left to the zone to upper guk.<br/>
<br/>
4.  go during the most busy time on your server - chances are lower guk is<br/>
over camped and you want as many campers as possible to have killed as many<br/>
frogs as possible.<br/>
<br/>
5.  dont be afraid to talk nicely to people. dont worry if you meet some<br/>
jerks.<br/>
<br/>
6. be prepared to wait from 2 to 8 hours.  if you get a mask you will have<br/>
to get out safely.<br/>
<br/>
7. nab a pair of shin gaunts and shin greaves as long as you are there. and<br/>
if there is a basalt carpace lying around, wth grab one if the campers dont<br/>
mind.  hehe, and these are armor pieces you can wear.<br/>
<br/>
The mask, Yk&#39;s, evil eye bags, flowing black silk sash, etc are all treasure<br/>
for 40 to 50 level players who will have been grinding exp for 180 some<br/>
bubbles.  To get too much of that stuff early just makes the latter parts of<br/>
your career all that more boring.  But it&#39;s your adventure - go for it!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and keep us posted on how your adventure went,<br/>

&gt; Hello all!<br/>
&gt; I have been reading this list for about 3 months now and thanks to you all<br/>
I have a level 15 half-bard and am absolutly loving him. This is a very<br/>
helpful,fun, and informative list. Seeing that I just reached 15 I would<br/>
love to try on a mask of deception. I looked through the archives and did<br/>
not find much. Would anyone please point me in the way of current info on<br/>
this or maybe give me some suggestions as I take on the mission for it this<br/>
weekend. I know that basically I need to find my way down to lower guk and<br/>
ask to loot it off the ghoul assassin there that it is a common drop on. I&#39;m<br/>
scared to death though. Should I go naked and maybe bring a mandolin to sing<br/>
heal for a group? Any advice would be awesome.<br/>
&gt; A fellow bard who feels at home thanks to all the advice that this list<br/>
pours into my inbox each day,<br/>
