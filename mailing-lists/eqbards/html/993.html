<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076309962">hmmm, i have never done the quest, i was just passing along info i got.  you are supposed to ask him about his sad song and lost love i though.  but anyway it leads you to mistmoore where his lost love is.  that is about as much as i know.<br/>

    Well I found the fountain and guy but that loc was inncorrect he is around 100 neg200 I tried to get to pos 5700 but it takes you into the water =) He is part of the newbie quest in qeynos I believe because I asked him about his new composition and he said I was too expirenced. =(  back to looking I guess unless you know where I went wrong?<br/>

        there is a guy by a fountain in south karana (loc 5700, 2600).  starts with him.  no one on my server has it yet though, very tough quest so it seems.<br/>

            I am trying to figure out where the quest begins for the level 30 song, I suspected HighPass Hold library but the man said I was a stranger and would not talk to me, can anyone give me a hint or even tell me where I begin this quest?<br/>
