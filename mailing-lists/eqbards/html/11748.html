<div id="ygrps-yiv-973923120">Well, consider this - you hear about some item that is good to have. You get<br/>
your group and go get it (brand new PoF,  Assn room 2 to 6 hour camp, early<br/>
Dragoon Dirk when DVinn dropped one every time, whatever) and you kill the<br/>
mob and get your loot.  Who is to say that you knew it was a bug?  Aside<br/>
from &#39;duping&#39; items with buggy trade windows or whatever, if the game gives<br/>
it to you, it should be yours - imho.  If they think something needs to be<br/>
changed, I favor the method of not dropping the item any more - ala<br/>
manastones. <br/>
<br/>
All this stuff about &#39;class balance&#39; and whether an item is &#39;bugged&#39; (guise<br/>
lets you get the spell even if you cant wear it - which you need to do to<br/>
get the stats) is a matter of opinion.  If the game lets you do it - it&#39;s<br/>
legal (aside from real cheats like duping).  To make it &#39;illegal&#39; after the<br/>
fact and magically change the items, will just hurt the players who have<br/>
them and not help the ones who don&#39;t. (This is sounding a lot like<br/>
&#39;twinking&#39; good or bad arguments but let&#39;s not go there ;p)  I don&#39;t think<br/>
its fair to change stuff because they think it &quot;should be.&quot; It&#39;s like their<br/>
nerfing of Selo&#39;s and breaking roots - they gave you something and it was<br/>
good - but now they think its too good and nerf it. Now it&#39;s getting down to<br/>
a matter of opinion on what is good, too good, or &#39;obvious bug.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;But Sylly, what about all those DE Pallidans and DE Barbarian Shamans???<br/>
That is not good Role Play!!&quot;  Ahh, enter the rp police.  BAH!  So what if a<br/>
Pally looks like a DE?  That&#39;s a lot better than the Pally&#39;s who don&#39;t heal<br/>
others, who don&#39;t help others, who are just jerks in general.  That&#39;s true<br/>
bad role play - but nothing can be done to stop that so fussing about some<br/>
goofy mask with an illusion spell is hardly going to fix all or even any<br/>
significant amount of bad rp problems.<br/>
