<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004876987"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ok, except that every shaman after the first is unnecessary <br/>
&gt; and every paladin after the<br/>
&gt; first and those under lvl 60 are unnecessary.  is necro mana <br/>
&gt; pump really necessary?  who pumps<br/>
&gt; the necros?  their pet damage is easily replaced by a mage <br/>
&gt; pet, so that alone doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make them necessary.  and since you didn&#39;t even mention <br/>
&gt; druids, i&#39;m assuming they<br/>
&gt; are unimportant as well, heheh.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i knew i forgot someone hehe, i guess druids can go in the middle for their<br/>
heals now.  and no, you are wrong about shaman.  play a level 60 shaman at<br/>
an uber raid sometime.  spend anywhere up to 10 hours constantly buffing<br/>
40-50 people.  i could not and would not ever do it, it is masochism at its<br/>
finest.  having 2, which is what we have, is important just for buff time<br/>
and shaman sanity.  and 1 of ours is going to be playing less, though she<br/>
says that a lot, so the 1 we have is going to be stressed to the extreme.<br/>
anyway, you will see that does not make more than 1 necessary for the raid,<br/>
and i guess you are right, but that is my argument for having 2.  same for<br/>
paladins, we are thinking of recruiting another, we only have 1.  yes level<br/>
60 applies to both shaman and paladins, and most classes for the raids we<br/>
do.  i have never played a necro, but i am guessing the necro&#39;s pump<br/>
themselves with their lich series or whatever it is, plus having<br/>
regen/zlandicar heart/etc.  necro mana pump is good for buffing and if<br/>
cleric&#39;s go OOM, which never happens now because they are all dead, but was<br/>
important before.  and i put them in the middle, not the very important<br/>
category.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i didn&#39;t say they don&#39;t matter when you are in the minority.  <br/>
&gt; i said that you are not<br/>
&gt; insignificant when you are in the minority.  but when <br/>
&gt; considering class balance, do<br/>
&gt; you balance the game according to what 80% of the subscribers <br/>
&gt; are doing or to what<br/>
&gt; 20% or less of the subscribers are doing? it&#39;s almost <br/>
&gt; impossible to do both because<br/>
&gt; of all the hacks needed due to complete heal and levels post <br/>
&gt; 50.  to go off on a small<br/>
&gt; tangent here, it seems that the game was designed as a 1 to <br/>
&gt; 50 game, and when the<br/>
&gt; success was so large and they decided to do an expansion and <br/>
&gt; allow levels 50 to 60,<br/>
&gt; they had to kludge and hack a lot of stuff together.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no doubt.  but what are we all levelling for?  it is a progression to level<br/>
60, and bards gain the lease amount of power through the post-50 levels.<br/>
once they hit 60, they have really gained very little.<br/>
