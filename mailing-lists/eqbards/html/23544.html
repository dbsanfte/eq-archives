<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147164672">Well that is also true of any of the OS&#39;s based on the 9X Kernel (hehe well<br/>
any Microsoft OS).  I&#39;m not a *nix geek (but I play one on TV &lt;g&gt;) but I<br/>
can&#39;t help being critical.<br/>

<br/>
My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has<br/>
inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a less-than-desirable<br/>
platform.  Win2k, on the other hand, apparently has the stability, which<br/>
comes at the cost of speed, due to security features.  I just wanted some<br/>
responses from people with practical experience in the matter.  Thanks!<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been using ME for a couple months now without any problems.  Any idea<br/>
