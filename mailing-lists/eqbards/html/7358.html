<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090004843"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Water Crystal Staff-&gt; Webclaw Murkwave, Named mob underwater in Lake<br/>
&gt; Rathe. <br/>
&gt; you have to fight him underwater, and he is a caster.  he will 32K if you<br/>
&gt; pull<br/>
&gt; him on land. (and i have heard that he 32k&#39;s if you don&#39;t kill him in a<br/>
&gt; certain<br/>
&gt; amount of time)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I&#39;m pretty sure that his spawn point is underwater, however, me and<br/>
2 others (Lvl 20 bard, warrior, wizard) killed him on land, near one of the<br/>
aviak huts (I think in the SE corner of zone).  <br/>
