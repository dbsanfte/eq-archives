 </span></blockquote>Now I&#39;d have to check again to be absolutely sure, but I&#39;m certain a gnome<br/>
was selling the brewing manual, believe at the windmills in steamfont.  I&#39;m<br/>
currently travelling the mainland and may not be back for a few days, but<br/>
maybe someone can confirm before then.<br/>
<br/>
Strange that manual is so hard to find, and on an island that doesn&#39;t even<br/>
seem to sell brewing supplies.<br/>
