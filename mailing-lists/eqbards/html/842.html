&gt; can tell and with no detailed description I have no clue when one is <br/>
&gt; better to use then the other.  Chord of Dissonance gives me no <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought of doing this starting back around L10 or 11, but<br/>
got frustrated because I didn&#39;t have data back from L1-9.  If<br/>
others are willing to fill in the holes for L1-15, I&#39;d be glad<br/>
to compile a list of effects and back out the equations that<br/>
govern them.  Send me (don&#39;t spam the list):<br/>
<br/>
Your level and base stats (str, dex, sta, agi, int, wis,<br/>
and chr - just in case they have an effect)<br/>
<br/>
Chant of Battle<br/>
base str and AC<br/>
+str +AC without drum<br/>
+str +AC with drum<br/>
I forget, is there a dex bonus for this too?<br/>
<br/>
Chords of Dissonance<br/>
Not quite sure how we&#39;d measure this.  I&#39;ve heard it is much<br/>
more effective with a stringed instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Jig of Vigor<br/>
Blah<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
time to walk straight between any two landmarks (use a stopwatch)<br/>
time to run between same two landmarks<br/>
time to run w/ Selo&#39;s w/o drum<br/>
time to run w/ Selo&#39;s w/ drum<br/>
(we&#39;ll assume most people aren&#39;t interested in walking)<br/>
<br/>
Hymn of Restoration<br/>
how many points/tick you heal normally<br/>
how many points/tick you heal with hymn<br/>
how many points/tick you heal with hymn and lute/mandolin<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan&#39;s Whistling Warsong<br/>
base str and AC and weapon delay (right-click-hold on weapon)<br/>
+str, +AC, and time to swing weapon 10 times (remember, the<br/>
first swing when you start the stopwatch is 0, not 1).<br/>
<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Lament<br/>
I just assume that this song has the same chance of success<br/>
against green, blue, white, yellow, or red mobs regardless<br/>
of yourlevel.<br/>
<br/>
Elemental Rhythms<br/>
base fire, cold, and magic resist<br/>
fire, cold, and magic resist w/o drum<br/>
fire, cold, and magic resist w/ drum<br/>
<br/>
Anthem de Arms<br/>
base str and weapon delay<br/>
+str and time to swing weapon 10 times (see Jonathan&#39;s<br/>
Whistling Warsong)<br/>
<br/>
Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon<br/>
I&#39;ve heard this only becomes effective when you have really<br/>
high wind instrument skill.<br/>
<br/>
Brusco`s Boastful Bellow<br/>
What is the max damage you have seen?<br/>
<br/>
Purifying Rhythms<br/>
base poison, disease, and magic resist<br/>
poison, disease, and magic resist w/o drum<br/>
poison, disease, and magic resist w/ drum<br/>
Is this a drum song?  For some reason I thought it was a<br/>
stringed instrument song.<br/>
 <br/>
Cataloging Libretto, Lullaby, and Aquatic Ayre don&#39;t seem to<br/>
change with level (c.f. Kelin&#39;s Lament for Lullaby).<br/>
<br/>
That should cover everything that I can&#39;t test myself.  Feel<br/>
free to send in info on higher level songs.  The template I&#39;ve<br/>
given above should tell you what type of info to send in.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, send it to me only - don&#39;t spam the list.<br/>
