<div id="ygrps-yiv-807223897">Last night, we were fighting the Ice Giants in front of Permafrost.  There<br/>
were 3 other melee types in our group so I used Berzerker and Denon&#39;s<br/>
Dischord with my brass horn.  A level 21 rogue came by and asked me: &quot;do you<br/>
fight them with just your horn?&quot;  Sometimes it&#39;s great to be a bard!  I wish<br/>
there were more of these kinds of song combinations.<br/>
<br/>
I guess they wanted us to play more than one song in a battle (at least<br/>
that&#39;s what they say now) but no one in their right mind would *want* us to<br/>
have to switch instruments as well as songs.  That&#39;s just something that<br/>
bards found they could do after the thuing was coded.  Had they understood<br/>
the day-to-day mechanics of being a bard, I can only think that they would<br/>
have paid more attention to songs and had more good combinations that do<br/>
*not* require an insane amount of button pushing and instrument dropping on<br/>
the ground.<br/>
