<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878319051"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; In all fairness, the folks running EmuQ<br/>
&gt; voluntarily shut the project down when it<br/>
&gt; was pointed out that a server emulator is<br/>
&gt; in effect &quot;stealing&quot; the artwork, models,<br/>
&gt; and textures on the EQ CD.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand how someone making something that allows you to use<br/>
something that you already own - is stealing. Now if it allowed you to play<br/>
EverQuest without owning a copy, I would understand. But I&#39;ve paid $50 for<br/>
this game and should be free to play it wherever/whenever I wish; with my<br/>
original CD of course.<br/>
<br/>
If the makers of Bleem (PSX Emulator) can legally make their emulator, which<br/>
completely eliminates the need to purchase the hardware normally required<br/>
for a PSX game, why can&#39;t someone make an emulator that allows you to<br/>
locally use the product that you have purchased (that you are still required<br/>
to purchase to use) when it doesn&#39;t eliminate the need for the EQ servers?<br/>
<br/>
Unless I don&#39;t fully understand what the EQ emulator did, it sounds to me<br/>
like Bleem would be a precendent that would cause Verant to lose in court.<br/>
PSX hardware and EQ servers - same thing, you still have to purchase the<br/>
games.</div>
