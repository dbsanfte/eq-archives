<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047542283">I have looked over all the jewellery that an enchanter can make.<br/>
I also realize there are earrings, rings, etc available to higher<br/>
level players from dungeons.  This is my take on the best player<br/>
made jewellery in the game for a bard, and what I currently wear.<br/>
<br/>
face:    platinum star ruby veil, cha9 dex9<br/>
neck:    golden black pearl choker, agi7 dex7<br/>
ear:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>
ear:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>
finger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>
finger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>
<br/>
most bards, have a good charisma and strength base to start<br/>
dex is extremely important, and agility is to some extent.<br/>
intellegence and wisdom are completely useless in day to day<br/>
bardic activities, although I have wis/int gear for trade skills.<br/>
<br/>
this combo gives, dex30, agi7, int4, str8, cha19<br/>
and this is the best you can get player made, best in the game imo.<br/>
<br/>
couple this with elfhide gloves, ac4, dex5, agi5  (brd rog only)<br/>
and troll hide belt, ac5, str5, sta5 (brd rog only)<br/>
<br/>
you have a extremely well balanced bard, statistically speaking.<br/>
