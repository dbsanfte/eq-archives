I was doing CC in the hand room in Karnor Castle - and everything&#39;s going<br/>
fine - mezzing on a 2 pull.  I&#39;m still (out of habit) playing first-person<br/>
view even thought I&#39;ve heard all the advice that overhead is better for<br/>
CC...<br/>
<br/>
     Anywho - I try to target the add which is in view in the bottom right<br/>
hand<br/>
of the screen - and all hell breaks loose.  It takes me a second to realize<br/>
that I&#39;ve clicked the &quot;Social/Abilities&quot; box and the interface decided it<br/>
was time for me to move the box.  I frantically try to figure out how to<br/>
get<br/>
it to stop - as a 3rd mob walks in the room.  By the time I get it under<br/>
control the 2 tanks are dead.  I get 2 mobs tied down - we kill one when<br/>
more start spawning.  At this point we don&#39;t have enough firepower (2<br/>
Clerics and a Druid) - and eventually I get a string of resists to mez - so<br/>
we decide to run for the border.   One of the mobs was a summoner - so only<br/>
one of the four of us makes it.<br/>
<br/>
     I told my guildies what happened - only to discover about the alt-L<br/>
command<br/>
to lock the windows.  If you haven&#39;t done the ALT-L do it right away -  I<br/>
wish I had known about it before.<br/>
