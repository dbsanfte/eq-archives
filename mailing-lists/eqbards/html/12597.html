<b>Subject:</b> Pixie strike versus interrupting spell casters <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464322902">After reading on this board that pixie strike can interrupt spell casters<br/>
attempts at casting a spell, I have tried using this song for this purpose.<br/>
When I see the text message that the mob is starting to cast a spell, I<br/>
immediately stop what I&#39;m playing and start up pixie strike.  In just about<br/>
every situation where I have tried this, the mob is still able to<br/>
successfully cast the spell before the pixie strike goes into effect.  How<br/>
have you guys gotten this to work? Do you continuously pixie strike at the<br/>
expense of weaving other songs or is there a better way to time it?  All our<br/>
songs take 3 seconds to go off.  Assuming we start the song as soon as you<br/>
see the message &quot;mob starts casting a spell&quot;, we should be able to interrupt<br/>
any spell that takes 4 second or longer to cast.  <br/>
<br/>
On a related note, how long does it take for the mob to get a heal spell<br/>
off?  My group was fighting glyphed warders in Mistmoore the other night and<br/>
it kept healing itself, even though I kept trying to pixie strike it.  It<br/>
really irritated me because my strike usually kicked in right after they got<br/>
the heal off.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, will pixie strike interrupt a spell even if the mob successfully<br/>
resists?  <br/>
