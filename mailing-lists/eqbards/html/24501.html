I never liked Pixie Strike - while the percentage was de-nerfed -  there IS<br/>
a secondary resist - meaning a mob has TWO chances to resist it.  I got a<br/>
LOT of resists with it (except for mid-to-low blues) and didn&#39;t like it...<br/>
I stuck to Charm and Root.  Others had better results with it than myself.<br/>

What lvl are you?  If you have the 53 song, you can reliably mez 3 mobs.<br/>
With Pixie Strike, you can only reliably mez 2 mobs.  I would never mix<br/>
charming and mezzing and a single bash can really ruin your mezzing.<br/>
<br/>
For me if there is a 2 pull, I will usually charm (though in Sebillis I now<br/>
just mez, since too many of th emobs are over lvl 50).<br/>
If there is a 3 or 4 pull I mez.  If you are getting 5 pulls you better have<br/>
an enchanter or a real good rooter...<br/>
