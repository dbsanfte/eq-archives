&gt; People keep saying this but I don&#39;t find it to be true. I tried tonight<br/>
&gt; with my serpentine bracer. AC 1 AGI 9. I put it on and my AC went up 1.<br/>
&gt; It does affect how often you get missed but has _no_ effect on AC, which<br/>
&gt; is how much damage you take when you do get hit. As I can&#39;t tell a<br/>
&gt; significant difference in the amount I get missed between 100 and 130 I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth giving up AC for agility beyond that point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is almost correct. Agility DOES affect your AC. I don&#39;t have the<br/>
numbers written down but I do know that my AC is affected by how much<br/>
+agility I have (just like my HP are affected by how much +stamina I have).<br/>
However, once your agility reaches 100, it takes a larger amount of agility<br/>
boosting items/buffs to see that AC increase.  If you doubt this at all,<br/>
take off all your +agility items and look at your AC then put them on and<br/>
compare again. For those of you with a base agility that is lower than 100<br/>
you should see your AC increase.<br/>
<br/>
One example I can give and maybe some of you can test this with someone you<br/>
trust, but the dwarven cleric I run around with gets better AC from his BS<br/>
tunic than a bronze breastplate because of the agility boost. Because my<br/>
agility hangs around the 110 mark, my AC went down from Steel/Bronze when I<br/>
tried his tunic on. Had I removed all my other +agility items and tried<br/>
again, the story might have been different. I&#39;ll try this tonight if I can<br/>
remember and let you all know what I find.<br/>
