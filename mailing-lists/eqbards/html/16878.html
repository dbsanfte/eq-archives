<div id="ygrps-yiv-537556795">I cannot emphasize enough how much this list has meant to me in the last few<br/>
months.  The constructive discussions and John Kim&#39;s thorough testing have<br/>
made the difficult job of being a bard in EverQuest less difficult.<br/>
However, I do believe that I will take my leave of it for a while, at least<br/>
until the expansion comes out.  I simply don&#39;t need the kind of bile quoted<br/>
below in my inbox on Monday morning.<br/>
<br/>
Harmonic, you&#39;re rude.  Many of your posts are condescending and arrogant<br/>
and you damage the signal to noise ratio of the list in my opinion.  You<br/>
make personal attacks such as &quot;You forgot to take your medicine today.&quot; and<br/>
you call other players (myself included) fools and worse for having opinions<br/>
that differ from yours.<br/>
<br/>
Your opinion regarding all-caps being used to highlight a word in a sentence<br/>
is WELL known.  It does not, however, reflect general Internet usage.  The<br/>
majority of the Internet is not likely to bend itself to your will, so it&#39;s<br/>
probably in your best interest to attempt to overcome your prejudice of this<br/>
particular nuance of written Internet communications.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks to all of the posters (Harmonic included) on this list that<br/>
have contributed to my understanding of being a bard in EverQuest.  I hope<br/>
that I&#39;ve given some insights as well.<br/>
<br/>
See you in Kunark.<br/>

&gt;   You remind me a lot of myself when I started posting here.<br/>
&gt;   Have to prove everyone wrong.  Have to be all-knowing.  Except,<br/>
&gt;   Shada, I always am all-knowing with her.  I mean how smart can<br/>
&gt;   a female woodelf be?  /chuckle<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Plus, anyone who cannot make their point without capitalizing a<br/>
&gt;   word in every sentance REALLY is irritating because it LOOKS like<br/>
&gt;   you are SHOUTING at someone because you are ANGRY.  It&#39;s the equivalent<br/>
&gt;   of debating with someone over a topic and then resorting to voice<br/>
&gt;   escalation to flood your point across.  The best debates I receive<br/>
&gt;   come from: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jhenders@...">jhenders@...</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kim@...">kim@...</a>.  They use<br/>
&gt;   proper grammar, they can spell, and they never ever raise their<br/>
&gt;   voice (so to speak) in the emails.  Sometimes, I wish I could have<br/>
&gt;   the composure they do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Need to break out my procmail filters again, and run my eqbards mail<br/>
&gt;   through a program that to_lowers everything   /sigh  =(<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And no, I don&#39;t have to prove everyone wrong.  Just those who post their<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinions as if they were the only one possible.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Who said my opinion was the only possible one?  Man, you need to stop<br/>
&gt;   reading into these posts.  So far you&#39;ve done it several times, and<br/>
&gt;   John(tm) even had to make a comment on it.  You forgot to take your<br/>
&gt;   medicine today.  How about not jumping all over people on the list?<br/>
&gt;   Since you&#39;ve been here, you&#39;ve done nothing but argue unproductively.<br/>
&gt;   If you&#39;ve played since Beta 2, we are happy for you, others here have<br/>
&gt;   as well.  You flaunt your knowledge as if you designed the game.<br/>
&gt;   Senior Guide on whatever server or not, I would just chill out and<br/>
&gt;   try to be helpful.  We don&#39;t need any more smartasses =)<br/>
