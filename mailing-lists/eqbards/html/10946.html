&gt; Even though I really like our guild Robynn, I have learned not to rely on<br/>
&gt; them for anything.  I realize your not saying that you do...but if I find<br/>
&gt; myself grouped with a guildmate its usually because of coincidence.  No one<br/>
&gt; from our guild has ever come to my aid because I asked, only if it was<br/>
&gt; convenient.<br/>

weekend running around looking for lambent components on my own (because I think I&#39;m <br/>
high enough level to do so), but my guild interactions included:<br/>
<br/>
1.  I got into two Lower Guk groups with five others in the same Guild (different <br/>
people each time).<br/>
<br/>
2.  Cleric comes from FP to Sol A (when he was headed to Guk) to help me retrieve my <br/>
corpse from the lava at the bottom of the stairs (I needed goblin protection).<br/>
<br/>
3.  Wizard offers me a Lambent Stone, in return I help her kill a named Shadowknight <br/>
and a Skeleton Monk in Upper Guk for her Acumen Mask quest (now that little excursion <br/>
brought back some of the fear I&#39;ve missed lately, let me tell you...)<br/>
<br/>
4.  Same Wizard later offers me another Lambent Stone, in return I help her get a <br/>
drop off of the Shadowmen in Lavastorm.  We both die on the first attempt (they&#39;re <br/>
too closely packed for Lament to work right).<br/>
<br/>
5.  Level 45 Ranger comes six zones out of his way to pull Shadowmen for us.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Level 50 Warrior asks if I can help him heal in Sol A, so I do.<br/>
<br/>
7.  I help his level 26 Enchanter get 2/3 bubble in 30 minutes by Chain/Pixie <br/>
Striking goblins (ungrouped) and singing Mana Song (group) so she and her pet can <br/>
kill them in relative safety.<br/>
<br/>
8.  He takes me to Sol B and gets me some nice exp fighting no-exp-for-him kobolds.  <br/>
(Would have been better if i know where the blankety-blank zone point was.  I died <br/>
right next to it after running in circles for two minutes...)<br/>
