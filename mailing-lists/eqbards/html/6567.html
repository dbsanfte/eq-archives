<b>Subject:</b> Lv 22 and lv 40 songs (was Disenchanting) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-745656240">The level 22 song affects the bard&#39;s party members.  It is suppose to remove <br/>
ill effects on party members and leave the buffs alone.  I have tested it <br/>
with a bunch of ill effects, like boil blood, diseases, root, and so far the <br/>
song doesn&#39;t cancel any of them.  I have seen someone from this list claim <br/>
that the song will remove the resurrect effect, I have yet to try that.<br/>
<br/>
The level 40 song before the patch was an AE song that aggro everything <br/>
around the bard but does nothing to them.  After the patch, it is now a <br/>
single target dispel song.  It will take off the buff on that target one at <br/>
a time.  I belive the order is from the most recent buff to the oldest buff. <br/>
  If you try it on another player it will say he is protected unless you are <br/>
dueling him or on a PvP server.  It removes buffs such as hp buff, damage <br/>
shield, and steelskin. It does not remove serpent sight.<br/>
<br/>
Things we need to know:<br/>
<br/>
1. Which effects will the lv 22 song remove?  If there is any.<br/>
2. Will lv 40 song aggro a MOB when used before attacking? (This one is easy <br/>
to try)<br/>
3. Will lv 40 song removes buffs from self with the bard as target? (easy to <br/>
try too)<br/>
4. Exactly what effects will the 40 song remove?  Will it remove any DoT on <br/>
MOB or self?  Will it move SoW?  Charm?<br/>

&gt; &gt; also if level 22 is cancel magic, then what is the newly fixes level 40<br/>
&gt; &gt; song?  i haven&#39;t tried it yet, but a bard friend of mine says Syvelian&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anti-Magic Aria is a cancel magic song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The L22 song affects your party.  The L40 song is area effect<br/>
&gt;I believe?  One of you level 40+ folks will have to test it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  guess now we need to figure out the difference between<br/>
&gt; &gt; the two.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hard to figure out the difference when we can&#39;t even figure<br/>
&gt;out what the L22 song does.<br/>
