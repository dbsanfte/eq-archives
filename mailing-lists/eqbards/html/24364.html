<br/>
Heh, and I was excited to ding 53 and get Song of Twilight :-)<br/>
<br/>
Was on a failed Vox raid this week and got so fed up with the munchkins (the<br/>
really bad players seem to have made it to lvl 50 now) that I decided to go<br/>
and lvl to 53 so I would never deal with crap like that again...<br/>
<br/>
Of course I immediatly get an invite to Fear (thus no xp) and spend the<br/>
nexty 8 hours clearing it.  We even got to kill the enraged? golem (the<br/>
thing that the broken golem spawns).  Got my tendril and an imbrued bracer<br/>
(from a cube).<br/>
<br/>
But I managed to get enough time at Dog Capt on Saturday to hit 53 :) (sigh<br/>
I leave 52 with neither scale and without Selo&#39;s Drums)<br/>
