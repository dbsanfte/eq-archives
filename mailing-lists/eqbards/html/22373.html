<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435748944">The only web sites I can find that list the components for the Plane of<br/>
Sky Mask of the Songbird Quest show:  Ocher Tessara, Songbird Statuette,<br/>
<br/>
Light Woolen MANTLE.  Now, the Light Woolen Mantle is also used in the<br/>
Songweaver&#39;s Mantle quest, and I have seen some posts that suggest that<br/>
this is a typo, and that what is required is a Light Woolen MASK.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you completed this quest, and if so, what object is needed?<br/>
And do you remember which MOB(s) dropped it?  I heard it&#39;s the<br/>
Shimmering Meteors, which my guild never does because of their really<br/>
annoying knockback effect.  I hate to ask my guild to try killing them<br/>
if it&#39;s pointless.<br/>
<br/>
So far, we&#39;ve never seen a Light Woolen anything.<br/>

PS - Does anyone have a link to anyplace that lists all of the Sky<br/>
components and the quests they&#39;re for?</div>
