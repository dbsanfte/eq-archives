<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569171379">They probable DT for about 300 points max. I did take 2 DT&#39;s as a 35 bard <br/>
and since we have such wimpy hit points, couldn&#39;t have been more than that.<br/>
<br/>
I do highly recommend you get a SoW to pull one out of the canyon, even <br/>
before our drums were broken.<br/>

&gt;probably for about a bub or 2 of health... Just think of how the king HT&#39;s<br/>

&gt;How much does he Harmtouch for?  That&#39;s the primary concern that has kept me<br/>
&gt;from going to get this one.  I have little experience with shadowknights<br/>
&gt;past about 15th level so I have no idea how much their HT does.<br/>
