<br/>
on mith marr, we are totally against having a calendar.  we don&#39;t really go<br/>
to the planes anymore, but i think the other planes-capable guilds are using<br/>
a rudimentary scheduling system on a server message board.  as far as we<br/>
have always been concerned, if something is available, and you can organize<br/>
and take it on, you do it.  if it&#39;s taken, you find something else.<br/>
<br/>
and no there is no right or wrong to farming, but the people who first got<br/>
this armor, who learned the zones, who died and died and died, are the ones<br/>
who will argue that it is important to earn the armor.  farming is offensive<br/>
to us, and we view people who do it as cheap.  like i said, right or wrong,<br/>
that&#39;s how we feel is all.<br/>

&gt; hop on over to<br/>
&gt; www.solusekro.org...<br/>
&gt; where we have TRIED to have such a system.  I agree that they can work<br/>
&gt; remarkably well most of the time, but on Sol Ro, well, lets <br/>
&gt; just say things<br/>
&gt; have become less than friendly many a time.  Problem is there <br/>
&gt; are SO many<br/>
&gt; guild that can do any plane that the reservation system would <br/>
&gt; be 3 to 4<br/>
&gt; MONTHS in advance (and this is for weeknights).  Most guilds <br/>
&gt; do tend to go<br/>
&gt; to a plane for a week though.  Our arguments usually are <br/>
&gt; about one guild<br/>
&gt; &quot;stealing&quot; the plane from another.  Its REALLY fun! (sarcasm <br/>
&gt; intended) :)<br/>
