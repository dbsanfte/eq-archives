<div id="ygrps-yiv-39770894">Some of the smaller races have REALLY high dex, which makes them naturally<br/>
faster - but they shouldn&#39;t outrun you with Acc. on.<br/>
<br/>
Uhhh, you are RUNNING right, not the default walking? (Note:  I HATE THAT -<br/>
everyone runs, why is WALK default?) The only place I&#39;ve been to so far<br/>
that would be a good idea to walk in is kelethin. Probably others that are<br/>
narrow and cliffy - but geeze.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Evulia of Tunare at your service.  I&#39;m just a hair from level 8 and about to<br/>
&gt;begin hunting in Qeynos Hills.  But I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve got any expertise<br/>
&gt;to share just yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do have a question though.  I&#39;ve been travelling with a level 8 halfling<br/>
&gt;druid friend of mine, and whether singing or not, she outruns me by a long<br/>
&gt;shot.  At the time we were both stripped of everything (multi-zone trip, so<br/>
&gt;all posessions went into the bank) and she had not cast any buffs on either<br/>
&gt;of us.  Are wood elves/bards naturally slower than halflings/druids?  I<br/>
&gt;spent some time hunting in Mysty (just long enough that I was ready to<br/>
&gt;attack the guards for killing every mob within an 8 mile radius of the wall<br/>
&gt;just when I had them down to their last breath!) and noticed that while<br/>
&gt;running with Accelerado I was still getting passed by others (presumably<br/>
&gt;using SOW).  Anyone care to shed some light on this?<br/>
