<br/>
i&#39;m not sure but i think around level 45.  a level 43 friend could not use<br/>
them though.  and i never use the effect on the legs or boots since it is<br/>
only 1 per cast, so i am not sure they poof when you log but i would think<br/>
yes.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I have been lurking for a long time on this list and want to <br/>
&gt; express my<br/>
&gt; appreation for all I have learned from everyone here:) Does <br/>
&gt; anyone know what<br/>
&gt; lvl the singing steel effect works? I know summoning water <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t such a big<br/>
&gt; deal, but my evil friends are sometimes out or nearly out of <br/>
&gt; food and water<br/>
&gt; when I hook up with them. Being a baker, I usually have food <br/>
&gt; I can give them,<br/>
&gt; but being able to summon water for them would sure be nice. <br/>
&gt; Does the water<br/>
&gt; poof when you log like mage summoned water? Thanks in advance <br/>
&gt; for the help.<br/>
