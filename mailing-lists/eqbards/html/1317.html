<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391932204">A question about the lullaby spell.  Is its area of effect centered<br/>
on you as the caster, or can you target something some distance from<br/>
you and it is centered on your target?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; I visited Blackburrow today in search of Onyx earrings.  A<br/>
&gt; huge train came up to the zone.  I couldn&#39;t just stand and do<br/>
&gt; nothing so I hit the lullaby.  It worked.  On more than 4<br/>
&gt; mobs.  At one point, I must&#39;ve had a dozen or more gnolls<br/>
&gt; stacking away the Zzzzz&#39;s.  So it would seem there is no 4 mob<br/>
&gt; limit as had been previously stated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t attack a single one.  They all attacked me because<br/>
&gt; they hated my song.  They only managed to take a bubble of my<br/>
&gt; health in about 5 minutes because my AC was 388.  All the<br/>
&gt; lower level folks loved it.  They got all the experience and<br/>
&gt; took virtually no damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got a ton of faction for it.  The guards and merchants in<br/>
&gt; Qeynos now view me amiably (used to be apprehensive).<br/>
