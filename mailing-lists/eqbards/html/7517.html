 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  A couple weeks ago, a cleric, ranger, paladin, and I<br/>
were playing deep inside Sol A.  The ranger made a bad pull<br/>
and we got 5 goblins - not the wimpy cinder or flame goblins,<br/>
but the badass inferno and fire goblins.  Two more from an<br/>
adjacent room came afterwards to make 7.  We decided to cut<br/>
and run.  I played Screech, made sure the cleric gated out,<br/>
then ran ... straight into another group.  I was pretty well<br/>
lost and figured I wasn&#39;t going to survive anyway so I might<br/>
as well go down helping these guys survive our train if<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
There were 6 in their group, and me and our ranger as well<br/>
(the paladin made it to the zone, the ranger had been<br/>
following me when I got lost).  I fired up Lullaby.  They had<br/>
a bard in their group and he was playing Lullaby too.  8 of us<br/>
in total.  I looked around and counted no fewer than 12 fire<br/>
and inferno goblins, with a couple Solusek goblins thrown in<br/>
for good measure.  All these goblins were high blue to me, and<br/>
the ranger and other party were all blue to me, meaning the<br/>
goblins were probably around even /cons to everyone except me.<br/>
8 PCs against 12 even NPCs.  Usually a recipe for a massacre.<br/>
<br/>
They fought, the ranger fought, the bards played.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
think we had a chance, and kept telling them over and over to<br/>
run while I held the goblins as long as I could.  But they<br/>
would have nothing of it, and stayed.  Their cleric healed me<br/>
twice during the entire fight, which lasted a good 10-15<br/>
minutes.  One by one the goblins fell.  I was absolutely<br/>
astounded - we won, finishing off every single goblin without<br/>
a single fatality.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby starts to lose its edge against high blues at higher<br/>
levels, with the mobs usually waking up immediately or before<br/>
the next pulse.  But two bards singing it can keep these mobs<br/>
sleeping like babies indefinitely.<br/>
