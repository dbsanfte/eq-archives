<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286664376">not to brag but i am feeling really good about myself as a wizard now.  i<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure if i was good or bad, but i play exactly like you and Crier have<br/>
described.  guess i picked it up from my wizard friends or it just seemed a<br/>
smart way to play.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have to sing the praises of smart Wizards (there are a few).  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; occassionally get to group with a really bright Hong Kong <br/>
&gt; player who is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; high level wizard.  He plays his wiz in almost a clerical <br/>
&gt; fashion and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; works quite well.  The puller brings a mob and the wiz is <br/>
&gt; medding.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; tanks begin to beat on the mob.  When the mob gets <br/>
&gt; sufficiently aggrod on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the tanks the Wiz stands and casts a nuke *bam* then sits <br/>
&gt; his ass back down<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I watched a wizard from my guild play for a bit in Mistmoore.  <br/>
&gt; He&#39;d made a joke about people commenting to him &quot;Wow!  A<br/>
&gt; wizard that stuns instead of nukes!&quot; but I&#39;d forgotten about<br/>
&gt; it.  Anyway, he was in a melee-heavy group whose healers were<br/>
&gt; a ranger and a bard.  They pulled a mob, he immediately<br/>
&gt; stunned it.  Melee guys beat on it.  Stun wears out, mob is<br/>
&gt; aggroed on the melee guys by now so they take a bit of damage,<br/>
&gt; he stuns it again.  Repeat until mob is dead.  Never aggroed<br/>
&gt; the mobs onto himself, drastically cut down on the damage the<br/>
&gt; group was taking.  The only time he nuked was when they had<br/>
&gt; multiple mobs.  I was impressed.  The class is not as<br/>
&gt; one-dimensional as I&#39;d originally thought.<br/>
