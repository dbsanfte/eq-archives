<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390538462">Well my Shaman is 35, and I have decent armor for my level<br/>
nothing special.  I have an observer staff and am maxed (I think) for my<br/>
level in 2H blunt.  And all I have to say is that buffed up to the hilt, I<br/>
can MAYBE solo a blue in melee (not using DOT and DD)...but I doubt it.<br/>
This is strict melee.  Even when I use my spells, I still need to kite a<br/>
little to be comfortable.  My bard is only 17 and does just fine on a<br/>
blue... I don&#39;t know how she will be at 35 yet. <br/>
<br/>
		I guess my point (do I have one here?) is that my bard kicks<br/>
ass in melee compared to my shaman (can&#39;t say about other hybrid classes or<br/>
about other bards or other shaman).  Shaman are best at niche filling -<br/>
turning the tide of battle in our favor, whether by buffing, debuffing or a<br/>
nicely placed heal or DD.  Maybe bards are best at that too, with a slight<br/>
emphasis on getting in there and fighting.  But if my shaman is taking hits,<br/>
I crumple just about as fast as a wizard :-) <br/>

				If you jump off a 10 story building you will<br/>
die.  That is not a fact.<br/>
<br/>
				You are the only person I know who does not<br/>
know the difference between a<br/>
				fact and an opinion. <br/>
<br/>
				Maybe Bards eventually become better than<br/>
Shamans in melee, but not at level<br/>
				17.  Dual wield was not sufficient to<br/>
prevent me from being pummeled due to<br/>
				the numerous stuns I received.  All shamans<br/>
have slam.  Sure it never goes<br/>
				up, but it is still sufficient to stun a<br/>
17th level bard.<br/>
<br/>
				Bards are better than all hybrids in magical<br/>
power?  Under what microscope<br/>
				did you determine that?  At lower levels its<br/>
obviously true as the other<br/>
				hybrids have no magical power.  Hmm lets<br/>
examine them at higher levels.<br/>
				Paladin get Greater Heal, 400 hp that&#39;s 3<br/>
minutes worth of Hymn with a lute<br/>
				and it takes them less time than that to<br/>
meditate back the mana.  They also<br/>
				get Revive at their utmost level of spell<br/>
use.  Not to mention Lay Hands.<br/>
				Rangers probably have the weakest line of<br/>
spells getting nothing above Heal,<br/>
				though they do get Wolf Form, cool but not<br/>
overly powerful.  Shadowknights<br/>
				spells are fearsome.  The Engulfing Darkness<br/>
DoT line is devastating as it<br/>
				destroys our best defense, Acellerando and<br/>
it stacks with their Heat Blood.<br/>
				They also now have the lifetap series.  All<br/>
this aside their Harm Touch<br/>
				alone is a devastating if slow to recharge<br/>
weapon.  We do have a greater<br/>
				number of spells than the other hybrids do<br/>
though.  Are our abilities<br/>
				obviously better, I would not say so.<br/>
Better in a full group of six maybe,<br/>
				better in small groups, that&#39;s not apparent.<br/>
Even if we were better it<br/>
				certainly would not be 5-6 times better and<br/>
that&#39;s how the other hybrids<br/>
				relate to us in terms of melee skills.  <br/>
<br/>
				Now since I have stated that bards magical<br/>
abilities might not be so much<br/>
				better than some of the other hybrids,<br/>
rangers excluded as their spells are<br/>
				truly weak, feel free to call me a liar.<br/>
That will just be one more<br/>
				definition you will need to look up on<br/>
Merriam-Webster Online, right after<br/>
				&#39;fact&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
				To further turn your argument around: <br/>
				Bards cannot beat any caster consistently in<br/>
pure magical combat. (though<br/>
				I&#39;ve come close with Maxell MR)<br/>
				Bards cannot beat any other hybrid or melee<br/>
type consistently in pure melee<br/>
				combat.<br/>
<br/>
				Neither of those statements however true<br/>
prove we are weaker than those<br/>
				classes any more than yours prove we are<br/>
equal in power.  In my opinion, we<br/>
				are weaker than several of the other<br/>
classes.  The weakness is not generally<br/>
				overbearing but that doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be corrected.  To be honest I<br/>
				think a realignment of our skills would<br/>
suffice to bridge the gap without<br/>
				modifications to our spells other than<br/>
including the missing ones and fixing<br/>
				the broken ones.  An added melee skill like<br/>
Parry which succeeds more often<br/>
				than Dodge, and some raised caps on skills<br/>
that are currently of debatable<br/>
				usefulness would help as well.  Most<br/>
Jack-of-all-trades are seen as<br/>
				self-sufficient characters while we are<br/>
definitely not designed to be very<br/>
				capable on our own.  We do best in groups<br/>
due to the nature of our spells.<br/>
				It is this very grouping nature that further<br/>
undermines the usefulness of<br/>
				our other skills as there will often be<br/>
present others in the group whose<br/>
				skill so far overshadows ours in those other<br/>
areas that we might as well not<br/>
				have the skill at all. There is no benefit<br/>
to having Find Traps and Pick<br/>
				Locks when there is a rogue in the group<br/>
with more than double your skill.<br/>
				If we were meant to be characters who could<br/>
function on their own and do<br/>
				nearly everything, if not well, that would<br/>
be different.  However, we are<br/>
				not.  We are meant to group and for every<br/>
member we add to our group some of<br/>
				our skills become superfluous just as our<br/>
magical powers become more potent.<br/>

				1. Bards are better than all Pure Casters<br/>
and Priests in melee. (MAG, WIZ,<br/>
				ENC, NEC, CLR, SHA, DRU)<br/>
				2. Bards are better than all hybrids in<br/>
magical power. (PAL, RNG, SK)<br/>
<br/>
				The above statements are facts and cannot be<br/>
disputed.  Every Bard should<br/>
				understand these facts.<br/>
<br/>
				If someone tries to contradict one of the<br/>
above statements, I will point<br/>
				them out as a liar.  Especially to those<br/>
Bards who have been on this list<br/>
				quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
				As to the nature of my messages, in the past<br/>
I have made some poor choices.<br/>
				But I&#39;ve tried to do better.  I looked at my<br/>
last five messages and saw<br/>
				nothing out of the ordinary.  I&#39;d be glad to<br/>
discuss any of my posts with<br/>
				you or anyone else in private, not on the<br/>
list.<br/>
