[Good example of bug exploit by grief player deleted.]<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly the problem I have with the developers who think they<br/>
can do PvP &quot;right&quot; as well. AI systems always end up having work arounds<br/>
and bugs and you can guarantee that the grief players will have an<br/>
active community staying on top of every one of them. People I knew who<br/>
banded together to try to &quot;clean up&quot; UO found themselves becoming just<br/>
like those they fought, at which point they ended up leaving the game.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the developer of Horizons does think he can make it all work,<br/>
IMO, he should still institute a switch, for those that don&#39;t want the<br/>
hassle of dealing with PvP. After all, if it&#39;s such a great system, then<br/>
most people would go PvP anyway. What would be wrong with letting people<br/>
have the choice.<br/>
