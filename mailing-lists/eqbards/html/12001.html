&gt; This is what happened to me in Unrest last time. I was in a group with a<br/>
&gt; level 25 Warrior (the puller), a level 22 Shadow Knight, a level 20 Shaman,<br/>
&gt; a level 20 Wizard and a level 23 Necromancer. I had my weapons out and no<br/>
&gt; songs playing when the puller came back with a Dry Bone and two Dark Bones.<br/>
&gt; Before I even started playing a song or attacking all 3 were on me and could<br/>
&gt; not be taunted off me, so I died. This was only my 3rd time in Unrest, not a<br/>
&gt; good start. Somehow I always seem to end up with all the mobs on me even<br/>
&gt; without playing Largos or Lullaby.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where am I going wrong? Or is bard hate really this bad? If it is that bad<br/>
&gt; then how do you all manage?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s another possible explanation.  As we&#39;ve discussed<br/>
here, mobs have a &quot;give up&quot; radius.  If you&#39;re outside this<br/>
radius, they will quit chasing you.<br/>
<br/>
When your puller goes in, sometimes he can activate mobs that<br/>
don&#39;t follow him out.  Unrest used to be pretty bad with mobs<br/>
that got stuck, but I think Verant has fixed most of those.  <br/>
Still, it&#39;s possible that there are still some mobs with this<br/>
problem.  Another possibility is that your puller is<br/>
accidently activating a mob, but because of the mob&#39;s pathing,<br/>
he is running out of the mob&#39;s &quot;give up&quot; radius before he<br/>
reaches your group with the real pull.<br/>
<br/>
When he gets back to your group, these extra mobs are not<br/>
chasing him, but are still aggressive towards him.  In your<br/>
fight, you play a song, and blammo - you&#39;re now on their aggro<br/>
lists as well.  In fact, they&#39;re only mad at him because they<br/>
saw him.  You are buffing and healing him, so you end up<br/>
higher on their hate lists than he.  But since both of you<br/>
are outside their &quot;give up&quot; radius, they don&#39;t come after you.<br/>
<br/>
Your puller goes in, gets these mobs (or any mobs that were<br/>
&quot;told&quot; about you by the stuck mob).  He is inside their &quot;give<br/>
up&quot; radius but you are not, so they chase him.  He pulls them<br/>
to your group.  Eventually, both you and he are inside their<br/>
&quot;give up&quot; radius, but you are tops on their hate list.  So<br/>
they all go after you.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not much you can do to stop this - if anyone in your<br/>
group is on any hate list, the instant you play a song that<br/>
helps them, you&#39;re on the hate list too.  When grouped, the<br/>
bard has to act as if he inherited the worst faction and the<br/>
worst hate of anyone in the group, because that&#39;s the way the<br/>
game treats him.  When I played in Unrest, every time I got<br/>
the inkling something like this was starting, I had my whole<br/>
group zone out and back in to clear any hate lists (took a<br/>
half dozen deaths before my guild believed me - fortunately<br/>
the clerics vouched for me, since they run into this problem<br/>
too to a lesser degree).  Or you can do the pulling (which<br/>
insures any hate lists you get on are entirely your own<br/>
doing).  Fortunately, the problem is mostly limited to zones<br/>
where mobs can get stuck or lost (or your pull is stolen).<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s worse is when another group starts a train that<br/>
includes one of these mobs.  They zone or die, and the mob<br/>
that hates you tells all the others, &quot;Awww, they got away.  <br/>
But hey, there&#39;s this nice juicy bard who&#39;s been causing<br/>
trouble lately...&quot;<br/>
