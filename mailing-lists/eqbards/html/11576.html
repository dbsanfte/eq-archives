<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510837907">Not to get into big discussions or battles on this topic, but I do want to comment.  <br/>
<br/>
It was never intended for anyone else other then bard/rouge to have the mask in fact it is rather silly that anyone else EVER had access to it.  The concept of the Rogue most especially and in part the bard by virtue of &quot;living hand to mouth&quot; was to enable the rogue to get in, scout, steal, and or assasinate without imidiate detection.  Are there benefits other classes liked and wanted obviously.  But then aren&#39;t there things every class wants from another one? <br/>
<br/>
In a Roleplaying sense the Guise of the Deceiver was also abused in its former anyone can get it form.  A paladin would never concent to hide their valor, a cleric would be confident in their god to see them through, etc about the only other classes the MIGHT have had a roleplaying cause for the mask would have been enchanters and magicians and that is iffy.<br/>
<br/>
I understand how those who got used to the advantages of the mask are displeased but in my opinion verant is right and those who have been using the guise were never intended to use it and had access to it&#39;s abilities only through a mistake.  One I might add that was clearly labeled.<br/>

&gt; 		Ok, I play a Barbarian Shaman as well and I have a guise.<br/>
&gt; And I have to say here that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unfair that other races can<br/>
&gt; equip it.  Have you ever tried to zone from Guk or Sol B when there is a<br/>
&gt; Troll, Ogre or Barbarian in your way?  As a Shaman, I can shrink, but for<br/>
&gt; the others, being small was of HUGE importance in a dungeon... not to<br/>
&gt; mention the ultravision benefit.  Anyway, I&#39;m fine with the change, but<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think it was necessary.<br/>
