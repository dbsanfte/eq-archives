<b>Subject:</b> bug with Sneak? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382028002">I have trained up my sneak skill somewhat but am having trouble<br/>
using it. It stays in the depressed position all the time. So<br/>
far I was able to use it once. Is it something bards can only<br/>
use once a week? Does it have to be above a certain level to<br/>
be able to use it? Anyone know the deal?<br/>
