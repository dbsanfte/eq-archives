<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479103243">The reason the sense heading went up quickly after you trained in it is<br/>
because, Sense heading only has a chance to increase when you are<br/>
successful with it. so when your skill was 5 you failed alot and had<br/>
little chance of increas. whe you pumped it up to 15 you succeeded more<br/>
often and therefor got more checks for increase, and it increased more.<br/>
<br/>
Most (all?) other skills have a chance to increase whenever you use<br/>
them, whether you are successful or not. Many times i have seen: You<br/>
failed to catch anything &lt;you got better at fishing!&gt; (10)<br/>

&gt;         I have a question about one of your statements in your previous<br/>
&gt; post:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                 Dumping skill points into it won&#39;t make it level faster by<br/>
&gt; use.  1 skill or<br/>
&gt;                 100, the chances of skilling are the same every swing, all<br/>
&gt; else being equal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         From my experience, I have not found this to be true in the case of<br/>
&gt; non-combat skills.  When I first created my character, I trained one point<br/>
&gt; in sense-heading.  I continually used that skill when moving around.<br/>
&gt; However, it almost never went up.  By the time I was 7th level, my sense<br/>
&gt; heading was only 5.  I got tired of getting lost so I put 5 more points in<br/>
&gt; it to raise it to 10.  Within the next hour or so, my skill in Sense Heading<br/>
&gt; increased to 20. I&#39;m now 15th level.  I can now max out my skill in Sense<br/>
&gt; Heading every time I level within five minutes.  My experience with alcohol<br/>
&gt; tolerance was very similar. </span></blockquote></div>
