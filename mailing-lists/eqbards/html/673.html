<div id="ygrps-yiv-751932391">However, there is a trick to the gorge, a path high up that the denizens of the gorge do not appear<br/>
to know about (I refrain from posting the spoiler but if people want it let me know). You must NOT<br/>
sing Accelerondo, as it is too easy to fall off the cliff (there are some tricky, but very possible,<br/>
corners). When you do fall, you need to beat it back up the cliff stay put, and heal. There is only<br/>
one place where you breifly cannot keep to the cliff.Be patient and everything will go fine.<br/>
<br/>
I went from Kelethin to Qeynos as an eight level bard, I went via Highpass Hold and skidded stunned<br/>
to the zone, it was VERY close. On the return trip I died once in the gorge trying to rush through,<br/>
but succeeded with a calm approach.<br/>
<br/>
The only other trick is, only EVER run the edge of the zone, do NOT take the roads.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I highly suggest you avoid beholder & runny eye, and go thru Highpass<br/>
&gt;Hold.<br/>
&gt;During peak hours, you can walk thru HH unscathed. There are plenty of<br/>
&gt;lvl 20 players camping all the orcs and gnolls that spawn there. Its so<br/>
&gt;safe, you could even look around and explore a bit. Why would you want<br/>
&gt;to risk going thru beholder and getting attacked by 10 things? And then<br/>
&gt;attempting to outrun them? You&#39;re not going to out run a damn thing when<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re stunned. And if an evil eye happens to cross you, you&#39;re screwed.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;ll either nuke you to hell (can&#39;t out run nukes) or it&#39;ll charm you,<br/>
&gt;and let some muddites or minotaurs munch on you. Minotaurs hit HARD, and<br/>
&gt;Muddites can blind you.<br/>
&gt;Thats not even the worst part. If you were to die, you&#39;d have one hell<br/>
&gt;of a corpse retrieval. You might be able to get someone to invis you,<br/>
&gt;but evil eyes can detect invis (I think). </span></blockquote></div>
