<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656066182">In all fairness to Cazic Thule though, he is a ShadowKnight. He has no<br/>
area effect spells special to him even though he is a god. I consider<br/>
his Death Touch to make up for this.<br/>
	I never played in PoF prior to the patch which made breaching the zone<br/>
full-spawned very difficult. Since we started doing PoF however, I&#39;ve<br/>
been on about 15 trips. Here&#39;s the thing about the new random zone-wide<br/>
death touch recently added -- we had a puller and groups not get hit by<br/>
it at all for over 6 hours. This was after the previous puller (not as<br/>
smart) died to about 6 death touchs before giving up. The death touch<br/>
didn&#39;t appear to be random, it appeared to be aggro-based. Just like how<br/>
the bard that really needs to be on their toes during any pulls is the<br/>
bard in the puller&#39;s group. In PoF/PoH we break out all the songs, but<br/>
you&#39;ve got to have all songs off when your puller goes out, because if<br/>
they need to die with a train/feign death and you are buffing then you<br/>
are next and you&#39;ve just trained everyone. My advice - if you are with a<br/>
smart puller that knows when he needs to camp to clear aggro, you ALWAYS<br/>
camp with him. This will make your body count and that of your groups<br/>
much lower. ;)<br/>
