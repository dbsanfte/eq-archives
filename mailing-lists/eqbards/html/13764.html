to make both coexist, either the dungeon crawlers get way too<br/>
little &quot;prize&quot; loot, or the campers get way too much.  <br/>
Duplicating zones would ease overcrowding, but it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
change the campquest state of the game.  Even if you<br/>
duplicated each zone so many times that each party were<br/>
practically alone in their own dungeon, the crawl party would<br/>
only see maybe one special mob per night while the camp party<br/>
would see multiple.  Too little or too much.<br/>
