<b>Subject:</b> Charisma vs Mob Resist Part 2 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-175139210">I have had similar experiences when an enchanter buffs me with the<br/>
Sympathetic Aura spell.  With that buff, barbed bone skeletons and carrion<br/>
ghouls almost never resist the Lullaby and Largo&#39;s Binding song.  Without<br/>
the enchanter buff, they seemed to resist more.  At least it seems that way<br/>
to me.  I would like to collect data on it but its hard to keep track of it<br/>
during combat.  That&#39;s why I raised the question last week when someone<br/>
posted about Brad McQuaid&#39;s comment at GenCon.  To paraphrase, Brad told<br/>
someone that charisma has no effect on a mobs chance to resist.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know who this Butler guy is (I assume he works for Verant), but his<br/>
statement seems to be the complete opposite of what Brad said.  Based off my<br/>
subjective experience, I think Butler&#39;s statement about charisma affecting a<br/>
mobs&#39; chance to resist is the correct way the game handles charisma.  What<br/>
does everyone else think?<br/>

&gt; us on this list that do, especially those of us who are of a higher level<br/>
&gt; than myself - however, with a CHA of 95 one night, I got a enchanter to<br/>
&gt; boost me up above 100 and did notice that my songs such as root and<br/>
&gt; binding were resisted less. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma and<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s saves. Your charisma is related to how well you<br/>
&gt; interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<br/>
&gt; Bard&#39;s singing skill has a check against charisma. <br/>
