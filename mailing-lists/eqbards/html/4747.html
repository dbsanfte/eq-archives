<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897638883">Me too,  The helmet for my race (human) is pretty dorkie so it is only <br/>
     recently that I started wearing it, in combat only.  To bad about the <br/>
     blackened armor, it is just heavy enough and thin enough that I don&#39;t <br/>
     think it is worth it.  It looks great though.  The one area where I <br/>
     disregard looks if my weapons.  Still using the pitiful looking <br/>
     Dragoon dirk. (I just feel silly threatening MOBs with a sewing needle <br/>
     in my hand...) Matched with a combine Scimitar it&#39;s looks damn silly <br/>
     but I&#39;m a quisinart(sp) in combat (with dual wield fast weapons are <br/>
     imperative, IMHO)  The Orange, er Bronze armor looks much better if <br/>
     you can find some good arm armor of a different type.  I use barbed(?) <br/>
     armplates.  The Water staff thingie looks great, I saw one this <br/>
     weekend, but it&#39;s stats are rather low.  Just can&#39;t afford the damage <br/>
     loss.<br/>

So I&#39;ve been running around in full bronze plate for a <br/>
few levels, when suddenly I look at myself and <br/>
realize, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m ornge&quot;.  So I&#39;m thinking of buying <br/>
a set of blackened.  I hear it&#39;s less ac and heavier, <br/>
can any one verify? (yes I&#39;m saving up for silver but <br/>
EGADS that&#39;s spendy)  If it&#39;s not too huge a dif I&#39;ll <br/>
wear the pieces that show any way.  Also, I picked up <br/>
a Water Crystal Staff this weekend in Lake Rathe. <br/>
Wanted to raise my 1h blunt any way, so now I&#39;m duel <br/>
weilding it and a PGT, which looks awesome.  HUGE <br/>
stamina sucker though.  I get inspected a lot more now <br/>
too, seeing as how we&#39;re the only non caster class who <br/>
can use it, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the only person on E <br/>
Marr duel weilding it :).  Any way, am I crazy or does <br/>
anyone else use lesser items in favor of how they <br/>
look?<br/>
