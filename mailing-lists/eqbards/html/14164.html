&gt;That is a brilliant idea, and I honestly love it.  Those messages should be<br/>
&gt;in group say, not plain say imo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Verant will probably never do it.  They rightly feel that building the trust<br/>
&gt;amongst players is important.  You have to get to know others well enough to<br/>
&gt;group with them and trust them to tell you what loot is, which necessitates<br/>
&gt;long-term grouping relationships, which is a positive thing.  If you put<br/>
&gt;these messages in then you diminish the necessary trust relationships<br/>
&gt;between players and somewhat diminish to need for long-term relationships.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But Verant continually surprises me both positively and negatively.<br/>

discuss it.<br/>
