<br/>
The boat dropped me into the water 5 seconds from the ButcherBlock zone.  I<br/>
can verify this because on my second trip I saw the rock that I had swam to<br/>
just before the boat zoned.  Now that I am in the water, I have two choices.<br/>
How would you &quot;Roleplay&quot; this?<br/>
<br/>
I can try to swim to Butcherblock or swim all the way back across the Ocean<br/>
of Tears to the dock to catch the next boat.   I realize that Butcherblock<br/>
is much closer.  So I use my Sense Heading and examine the sun/moon to<br/>
figure out which is East.  Then I head in the opposite direction (because<br/>
the zone was put in backwards).  Soon I realize that I am not making any<br/>
progress.  There is some invisible shield blocking my progress.  The boat<br/>
passes through this shield with no problems.  Well, I&#39;ll swim back to<br/>
Freeport.  After a long swim I find the same shield is blocking Freeport.<br/>
OK, so I&#39;ll hail the boat as it comes by and the boat will stop and rescue<br/>
me.  Here it comes.  Everyone on the boat sees me and is yelling.  But the<br/>
boat doesn&#39;t stop.  No one bothers to throw a rope down to me.  It just<br/>
leaves me in the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
You might think that was roleplaying, but I don&#39;t.  Even if I accepted your<br/>
mythical wave that &quot;knocked&quot; me off the boat, I still can&#39;t do any of the<br/>
other things that I would want to do that would extract myself from this<br/>
situation.  I consider the game&#39;s roleplaying options &quot;broken&quot; at this point<br/>
so I see no problem with using /loc in this situation, even for the die-hard<br/>
roleplayers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I actually /petitioned a GM and got moved to the island with the dock.<br/>

&gt;In my mind I can justify gadgetry that is intended as part of the game or<br/>
&gt;is separate from the game but can in a reasonable way be considered part of<br/>
&gt;the game, such as this mailing list or externally obtained maps.  Mailing<br/>
&gt;lists and maps are straightforward ways for people to exchange information<br/>
&gt;and can be kept somewhat in game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My problem is using programming internals to further my ability to beat the<br/>
&gt;computer program.  That&#39;s not the game I want to play.  It&#39;s too much like<br/>
&gt;disassembling code to decypher the operating system so I can write whizbang<br/>
&gt;programs of my own, or getting playing hints by printing out all the text<br/>
&gt;messages from the software.  That&#39;s playing the computer system, not the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>game.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;/loc and the grid system are program mechanisms, not a game world feature.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is an old, familiar argument.  I&#39;ve had it before about exploiting<br/>
&gt;rule glitches in live roleplaying games.  Some people do because they get<br/>
&gt;more power.  Others won&#39;t because they want to play the fantasy game, not<br/>
&gt;the external rules.  I&#39;m of the latter group and as a game rules designer<br/>
&gt;tried to eliminate the abilities of the former.<br/>
