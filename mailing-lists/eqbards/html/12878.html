<div id="ygrps-yiv-752015811">Invis to undead can be cast by: Clerics, Paladins, Necromancers, and<br/>
Enchanters.<br/>
Make sure any tests done involve Lower Guk Dead Side.<br/>
I&#39;ve used regular caster invis in Unrest and had it work on lots of stuff<br/>
that I though only invis to undead would handel.  But in Dead Side LG, if<br/>
its dead it needs invis to undead.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Invis to undead would be great of course, but I doubt that any of the<br/>
&gt;non-priest classes will get it.  To my knowledge the only non-priest class<br/>
&gt;that gets invis to undead is Enchanter, but they&#39;re a mind-bending class so<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s perhaps justifiable in that regard.<br/>

&gt;&gt; .......Invis to Undead, although a bit late I think it would be useful esp<br/>
&gt;&gt; in places like L Guk, Unrest, Kith Forest etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; A simple song to fill in a missing gap.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; What do you all think?<br/>
