 </span></blockquote>Any idea which is worse, Mynthi or the negotiator?  The<br/>
negotiator managed to charm me at level 36 while I was playing<br/>
one magic resist song (93 resist).  Fortunately, due to bard<br/>
hatred, she only ended up charming the two bards in the party,<br/>
and thus our party only had to put up with two extra attackers<br/>
punching for 1-8 points damage.<br/>
<br/>
The next time we took her on, I had both songs going, plus a<br/>
magic resist buff.  At 185 magic resist, I didn&#39;t get charmed.  <br/>
