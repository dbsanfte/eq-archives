<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394764831">I stumbled on to eldrig one night while evacing from HS. We evac out all at<br/>
1 bubble or less and pop into SF. I hit tracking (like I do every 10<br/>
seconds) and see Eldrig on track an flip out. I scream for heals then go<br/>
pull him to the OT zone line where we finished him off in short order. I was<br/>
a very happy bard.<br/>
<br/>
So far, aside from the big pieces (scales and guts) the most elusive item is<br/>
proving to be the skull from karnor&#39;s.<br/>

Eldrig was my hardest piece.  took me a week every day in skyfire to get<br/>
him.  i hardly ever actually hunted for him.  i showed up every day, let the<br/>
zone know i needed him, and asked a member of each group there to let me<br/>
know if they saw him.  a lot of regulars there so i became known during that<br/>
week, and finally i get a tell one night that he was up.  booked over there<br/>
and nailed him.<br/>

&gt; I was in skyfire the other night trying to get Eldrig to spawn.  The <br/>
&gt; question I have is if he is on the same cycle as Black Scar, and the <br/>
&gt; other named ones?  Seems like black scar, and some other named <br/>
&gt; chromodrac spanwed every time.  Is Eldrig just rare?  (Like the lava <br/>
&gt; walkder?)  Or is there some other trick to get him to spawn?<br/>
