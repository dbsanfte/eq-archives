<div id="ygrps-yiv-159830156">Well I have a seven-string already would have been nice to get a chance at<br/>
the BP c&#39;est la vie - I&#39;ll get another chance I&#39;m sure soon.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what my guildies were up to last night (nothing mentioned on the<br/>
forum early this morning - and haven&#39;t caught up) - but as usual on a<br/>
Tuesday I was RL barding - so didn&#39;t get a chance to join them...<br/>

Last night was also a family night, so I missed that too...<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of last night, I was playing my magician, and saw quite a<br/>
few of you guildmates collecting in Freeport. Working on a Paladin<br/>
sword? I was going to offer to help, but knew no one, and you were<br/>
not online.<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
