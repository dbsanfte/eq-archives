<div id="ygrps-yiv-939935044">: I have looted a blurred map. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s for some quest, I&#39;ve even heard<br/>
: rumors that it has something to do with someone in Qeynos that&#39;s building<br/>
a<br/>
: &quot;titanic bridge&quot; from Qeynos to Erudin. I&#39;ve also heard rumors that the<br/>
: quest actually isn&#39;t working right now.<br/>
<br/>
I know the guy that talks (or used to in beta) about a titanic bridge.  He<br/>
is in South Qeynos, he is located in a wood house directly to the right of<br/>
the clock (when facing it) and through the archway.  Or if you&#39;ve done the<br/>
tax collector quest before his house is oposite the tax collector&#39;s house in<br/>
the door on the left.  I went back to talk to him again in final once I got<br/>
Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillion because in beta he didn&#39;t &quot;trust me enough&quot; to<br/>
start me on the quest when he conned indifferently, but I couldn&#39;t get him<br/>
to talk to me at all.  Good luck, and tell me if you get something to work.<br/>
