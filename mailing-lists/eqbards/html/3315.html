&gt; Bear in mind that our experience is relative.  I didn&#39;t start<br/>
&gt; wearing plate until I had three pieces (breastplate, greaves,<br/>
&gt; pauldron) because I was vain and didn&#39;t like the way bronze<br/>
&gt; chest and banded leggings looked.  :-)  So I went from mostly<br/>
&gt; banded to mostly plate rather quickly.  If you went piece by<br/>
&gt; piece like most people seem to do, you may not have noticed.<br/>
&gt; If you got plate early (so your AC was high enough that mobs<br/>
&gt; were just hitting for less because it was way beyond their<br/>
&gt; &quot;level&quot; range), you may not have noticed either figuring the<br/>
&gt; extra damage was just due to the mobs being tougher.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just so you understand my experience, I had about 4 piece when I first<br/>
donned bronze plate, and I noticed that I was being hit less and the same<br/>
creatures (Carrions, Drys adn Monks) were hitting for the same amount.<br/>
I then went on a purchase splurgefilled out the rest of my bronze except<br/>
for the mask and the gloves and I have only noticed that mobs are missing<br/>
more often and are hitting for aboutthe same amount of damage.  Though I<br/>
have noticed that my dodge has not fired as often as it has before.  But<br/>
that may be due to the higher AC.  Like other skills dodge is only checked<br/>
when the creature successfully hits you.  <br/>
<br/>
Now my other observation has anyone noticed that if a mob hits you while<br/>
you are starting up a song he seems to be hit for max damage?  I noticed<br/>
the difference awhile ago when I picked up bellow.  I used to play one<br/>
song during combat.  Once I got bellow I noticed that hits that landed<br/>
just as I started a song resulted in greater damage.  This is something<br/>
that I have seen while playing my mage character over the last few days.<br/>
If I am hit while casting death beetles almost always hit for 26 or so.<br/>
Can anyone else confirm it?  When I saw it I just thought I was seeing<br/>
things.<br/>
