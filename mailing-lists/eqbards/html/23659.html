&gt;addict to the extreme.  I also like to make a group and go to a dungeon<br/>
&gt;where there just aren&#39;t any people around except a couple groups.  This<br/>

be around and drag em off to sebilis.  well actually most of the time i just live in<br/>
sebilis and pick up whoever happens to be hanging around the zonein.  so we usually<br/>
have at least on hole in the group, sometimes more, heh.</div>
