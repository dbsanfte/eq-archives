<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258902695">Buddy, if that&#39;s the type of guild you&#39;re in, I have two words for ya:<br/>
GET OUT!<br/>
I have had the privledge to be in NOR (New OutRiders) since my early days in NWN (Neverwinter Nights... the real one on AOheLl, not that BG-clone they are trying to sell :o/  ).  As just an example, all of the Lambent armor I have right now (gloves, legs, and arms) came about because of Lambent Stones that guildmates of mine found while hunting and held on to because they knew I would need them.  I can&#39;t tell you how many times I have been /t&#39;s by one of my guildmates to meet them somewhere only to find out that they had Crested Spaulders, or a dwarven chainmail tunic, or an Obsidian Shard, or something else that they wanted to give to me.  Not only that, but I have also given away many, many items to guildmates that I didn;t want and/or need.  (When was the last time you heard of someone giving away a Polished Bone Bracer or a BI Medallion?)  And as far as grouping together goes, just the other night a few of us got together and had a grand old time in the bartender&#39;s room in Sol A.<br/>
    The mission of NOR is to help each other and to help others (&quot;NOR and non-NOR alike&quot; is part of our mission statement) enjoy whatever game we are in.  What is the mission of your guild?  If it&#39;s not something you agree with, or it&#39;s just there so folks can have that extra tag and see the pretty green letters scroll across the screen, then, IMO, it&#39;s not really worth it.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Even though I really like our guild Robynn, I have learned not to rely on<br/>
&gt;&gt; them for anything.  I realize your not saying that you do...but if I find<br/>
&gt;&gt; myself grouped with a guildmate its usually because of coincidence.  No one<br/>
&gt;&gt; from our guild has ever come to my aid because I asked, only if it was<br/>
&gt;&gt; convenient.<br/>
