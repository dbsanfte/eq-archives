<div id="ygrps-yiv-148941581">After looking over the Lullaby data again while posting a huge sledgehammer<br/>
of a question hit me over the head.<br/>
<br/>
Why does Lullaby have a secondary resist???<br/>
<br/>
It sure doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect other than to mez.  Just as a sanity<br/>
check I had an enchanter friend mez the group of fifteen or so newbie mobs I<br/>
had in thrall, or not so much in thrall, 10 times.  He was only level 20<br/>
however.<br/>
<br/>
150 	attempted mez&#39;s<br/>
9	resists<br/>
6%	resist rate<br/>
<br/>
Yep, that&#39;s right he got a whopping 6% resist rate and his spell lasted a<br/>
heck of a lot longer than 6 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
My conclusion was that we are about as good at crowd control with this song<br/>
as we are at picking locks.  The only crowds we can control are the ones<br/>
that we would never encounter in an xp gaining venture, just like the only<br/>
locks we can pick.<br/>
