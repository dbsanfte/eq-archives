<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-679854645">I discovered last night that the Chazic Thule (sp?) dungeon allows Seolo&#39;s<br/>
to work!.  Even at only 21st I felt safer in there then most dungeons.  I <br/>
successfully dodged several large trains with out really breaking a sweat.  I <br/>
was basically killing courtyard trash but still had a pretty good night.  Great <br/>
loot!<br/>

dungeon.  :)  The combination of bard hate, and no way out but to run (with <br/>
no selo&#39;s) makes for a stun-o-rama death cocktail.  Screech is helpful <br/>
sometimes, but doesn&#39;t really help against trains with lots of casters (they <br/>
typically stand out of range of screech and fry you to pieces).<br/>
