<div id="ygrps-yiv-402194490">Well I play on a laptop quite a bit, my speed is fine, but the graphics are<br/>
white in areas far from where I zone in, or log in at, it is perfect for<br/>
travel, cause I know the routes by heart, and questing, and skill raising,<br/>
Ive even camped areas quite well, areas that I know VERY well<br/>

PS- My laptop is approaching a year old.<br/>
<br/>
That New Inspiron is my next choice also and I am counting the days till I<br/>
decide to splurge for it....<br/>

&gt;I asked the same question a while back and couldn&#39;t find much solid<br/>
&gt;information.  I&#39;ve yet to find anyone who has experience with playing<br/>
&gt;EverQuest on a laptop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I type this I&#39;m waiting for Dell to call me back so I can order an<br/>
&gt;Inspiron 7500.  As far as I can tell it will run EverQuest pretty well.  I<br/>
&gt;talked to 989 Systems support and was told the ATI Rage Mobility 3D<br/>
&gt;hardware in the Dell is sufficient for EverQuest even though they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;list it as supported.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ultimately I won&#39;t know until I try it.  Dell has a 30-day satisfaction<br/>
&gt;guarantee, so if it doesn&#39;t work I&#39;m not stuck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll report back how fast Thrush runs on the Inspiron, probably in a couple<br/>
&gt;weeks.<br/>
