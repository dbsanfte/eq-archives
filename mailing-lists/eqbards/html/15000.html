<div id="ygrps-yiv-759018232">Na, he didn&#39;t spawn with a weapon at all. He was just too tough, like I<br/>
said the casters spells were resisted and it only left a bard, Paladin & a<br/>
level 46 necro&#39;s pet +1 lvl 50 healer to finish him off, there was no<br/>
chance.<br/>

Someone disarmed him? Did they grab the bag off the floor? That would have<br/>
been the Yk.<br/>

&gt; The time the Lord wiped us all out he was actually bare fisted, no weapon<br/>
&gt; at all.<br/>
&gt; He was just too tough, the casters said their spells were resisted so it<br/>
&gt; was left down to a bard and a Paladin to deal out the dmg. No chance.<br/>
