<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425952304">I agree with Kitasi here.  I don&#39;t think our quests are all *that* easy.  I<br/>
started doing them at around level 27 and I can assure you that I didn&#39;t<br/>
find most of them trivial.  My set wasn&#39;t complete until about 34th.  Sure,<br/>
some pieces are easier than others, but even if you&#39;re simply looting quest<br/>
items from other people&#39;s kills, it&#39;s still pretty risky.  The Dark Bone<br/>
bracelet from the basement of Unrest, the Basalt Carapace from well inside<br/>
Lower Guk, the Gypsy Lute from the heart of Castle Mistmoore, the Icy<br/>
Greaves from the King Room in Permafrost, these are not easy things to get<br/>
for a lower level bard even if you&#39;re scavanging other&#39;s kills.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The bard quests may be easy at 30th level, but I have not found them<br/>
&gt; particularly easy at 20ish.  On the other hand I completed my<br/>
&gt; fourth shaman<br/>
&gt; piece last week with my 21st level bard, and I did all the<br/>
&gt; required killing<br/>
&gt; myself for 3 of the pieces.  I&#39;ve also done 3 crafted quests,<br/>
&gt; including the<br/>
&gt; slaying required, and 1 ranger piece.  I&#39;m halfway thru about 5<br/>
&gt; bard pieces.<br/>
&gt; If you think our quests are easy try some of the others, they<br/>
&gt; make ours look<br/>
&gt; many levels off for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have had no luck getting the icy greaves despite trying four times now.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve spent about 6 hours in the king room with no luck.  I know<br/>
&gt; others have<br/>
&gt; been more fortunate on this note, but since the critters involved<br/>
&gt; are still<br/>
&gt; far beyond my means for almost all the bard quests, while the critters for<br/>
&gt; some of the other classes&#39; quests are not, I don&#39;t believe ours<br/>
&gt; are as weak<br/>
&gt; as people seem to think.  Our quests are relatively easy for the level<br/>
&gt; Verant seems to think should be doing the quests (30-35).  Other<br/>
&gt; classes can<br/>
&gt; get some pieces 10 levels before this easily although some of their pieces<br/>
&gt; may be fairly difficult.<br/>
