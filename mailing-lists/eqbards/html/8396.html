<div id="ygrps-yiv-380696073">the songs that do not exist are levels 39, 45, 47, 49.  the level 22 song<br/>
exists but has no effects.  i think its a great list, and even though a<br/>
letter was just sent to GZ, it can&#39;t hurt.  hopefully the more they hear<br/>
from bards the more they will look at us.<br/>

&gt; This is a pretty good list, however, we *just* sent a message <br/>
&gt; to GZ with<br/>
&gt; much of this on it.  Let&#39;s wait a bit for some sort of a <br/>
&gt; response before<br/>
&gt; squeaking again ;)<br/>

&gt; I agree, this is to include in a letter which contains some <br/>
&gt; other constructive (<br/>
&gt; I hope ) things, and will be to Brad.  I think GZ needs more <br/>
&gt; specifics than this<br/>
&gt; letter will include.  The goal is to raise the general level <br/>
&gt; of awareness of our<br/>
&gt; class to the team in general.  We&#39;ve all noticed that <br/>
&gt; warriors, rogues, and<br/>
&gt; rangers get alot of tinkering.  My guess...large player base, <br/>
&gt; large amount of<br/>
&gt; feedback (or in the rogue&#39;s case, very broken and <br/>
&gt; embarrassing).  So, since<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re such a small group I&#39;m hoping to do a little PR with <br/>
&gt; the big guy and have<br/>
&gt; him and his team think on us a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone out there have a list of the songs that still aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; implemented?  Are<br/>
&gt; there any?<br/>
