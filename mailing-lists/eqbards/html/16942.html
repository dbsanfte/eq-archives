&gt; God, I hate it when they run. The fighter types then<br/>
&gt; have to chase all around trying to catch the mob so<br/>
&gt; that they can hit it and taunt it off the silly<br/>
&gt; caster<br/>
&gt; who...  (the rest deleted for politeness sake) Its<br/>
&gt; ok<br/>
&gt; to take ONE step back , and then another if that<br/>
&gt; didnt<br/>
&gt; work. but STAY PUT...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please please please understand.  I seek no flames or<br/>
dirges in my (317 hp) direction.  But having earned<br/>
many a bloddy &quot;been there & done that&quot; caster<br/>
tee-shirt, I ask that you consider the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. When a warrior is about to die, s/he goes berserk<br/>
and has a better chance to crit.  All a caster can do<br/>
is bleed.<br/>
<br/>
2. I have seen many a fighter type go into battle with<br/>
80% health and live thru the fight.  This isn&#39;t true<br/>
for casters (and in many cases, stunned bards)<br/>
<br/>
3. Taking one step back is possible, usually though,<br/>
by the time you take that second step back, you are<br/>
dead.<br/>
<br/>
4. Trust is a hard time to come by in EQ.  The new<br/>
&quot;play nice policy (gag) doesn&#39;t cover clerics who use<br/>
all their mana on Spirit Strike thinking that they are<br/>
wizards.  Until a party inspires that trust in it&#39;s<br/>
members, casters will run.<br/>
