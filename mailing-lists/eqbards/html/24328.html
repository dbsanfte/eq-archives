Talies, can we get this Kabong&#39;d as well as maybe have this person removed <br/>
from the list if you think it&#39;s warranted? I&#39;d really hate to see us <br/>
getting spammed with stuff like this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a student at Queen&#39;s University in Canada who is taking part in<br/>
&gt;a research project that is studying Everquest.  After spending<br/>
&gt;numerous hours (or perhaps months would be a better way to put it!)<br/>
&gt;playing the game we have put together a brief survey, which should<br/>
&gt;take no more than ten minutes to complete.  We are trying to get a<br/>
&gt;better understanding of the relationships which develop in the vast<br/>
&gt;land of Norrath.  If you are interested in participating merely cut<br/>
&gt;and paste the questions below and e-mail your replies to<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:7jss1@...">7jss1@...</a> Any comments or questions would be welcome and<br/>
&gt;appreciated.  The survey can also be found at<br/>
