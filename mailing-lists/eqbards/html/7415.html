<div id="ygrps-yiv-179713661">I think either everyone should be able to be bound (not necessarily bind)<br/>
everywhere or everyone should be able to be bound (but not necessarily bind)<br/>
in only cities.  I just wanted to point out that saying bards can&#39;t bind<br/>
because they are hybrids really wasn&#39;t that valid.  Especially if you<br/>
continue it to say that melee-major hybrids can&#39;t bind therefore bards can&#39;t<br/>
bind, because we are not melee-major hybrids we are more caster-major<br/>
hybrids like druids/clerics/shamans.  Really the best thing would be if<br/>
everyone had the same bind rules. Having npc&#39;s albeit expensive ones that<br/>
could bind you to a city would not harm the economy and would stop the<br/>
complaint of not being able to get bound.  There would always be pc&#39;s<br/>
looking for cash or to help out who would still bind for less or for<br/>
donations.  If casters could only bind in cities there would also be a lot<br/>
more of them around in cities so they could mem bind, bind a couple of<br/>
travellers, and recover mana while memorizing their other spells after<br/>
dying.  The way it is now casters have little reason to come into cities and<br/>
I think you will find that cities contain more non-casters than casters,<br/>
while on the whole casters far outnumber non-casters in the world.<br/>

&gt; Not valid, cleric/druids/shamans are as much of hybrids as we are and can<br/>
&gt; all bind.  Verant doesn&#39;t acknowledge this but I think it is pretty<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So you think paladins, rangers and shadowknights should also be able to<br/>
bind?<br/>
(Just trying to understand your position.)<br/>
