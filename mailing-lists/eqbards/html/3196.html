<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574926582">you also might want to consider picking up a 1h blunt weapon, just so you<br/>
can get your skill up in it. i have a dirk and a water crystal staff right<br/>
now, and i&#39;ve managed to get my blunt skill up to 70 (from 10) in a couple<br/>
days. why 1h blunt? you might want to pick up a staff of writhing at some<br/>
point, which has a pretty nice proc effect.<br/>
<br/>
staff of water crystals: 5dmg 28dly, casts shallow breath (DoT, might do<br/>
about 20 damage, and lowers agility)<br/>
staff of slime crystals: assuming same damage, casts sickness<br/>
staff of ice crystals: assuming same damage, casts 40dmg direct damage<br/>
spell</div>
