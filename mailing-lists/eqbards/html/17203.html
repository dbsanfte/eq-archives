<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963497753">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a little while since I&#39;ve posted.  I was previously playing a<br/>
half elf bard, 11th song, named Jerrilia, on Luclin.  Because I enjoy<br/>
trade skills, and Jerrilia was just too dumb for them, I&#39;ve now started<br/>
a new bard, Adagia, who has now made her way to the 10th song, and<br/>
progressing nicely on her baking skills.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I found her adventures last night to be rather amusing.  Over<br/>
and over I kept seeing examples of current discussions on the mail<br/>
list.  I started the evening in Steamfont, near the minotaur caves.  I<br/>
met a higher level druid who was sitting and healing himself (about half<br/>
health).  Although I&#39;m sure he had means to heal himself, I invited him<br/>
to my group so I could play the hymn for him.  While grouped and<br/>
chatting, I found out that he also had a level 10 bard and wanted to<br/>
know if I&#39;d like to group with his bard.  Sure, sounds great - I needed<br/>
a hunting partner. <br/>
<br/>
(twinking) Well before the druid camped, he handed me some lambent<br/>
gauntlets to give to the bard.  His bard was a self admitted twink,<br/>
thanks to the druid.  After a bit, the bard showed up, and it was pretty<br/>
obvious he was twinked.  Here was this level 10 wood elf bard, dressed<br/>
head to toe in bronze.  I gave him the gauntlets, and he very graciously<br/>
gave me his old bronze gauntlets. :)  They look nice on Adagia, but I<br/>
think they are too heavy, I&#39;ll probably just stick to banded for now.<br/>
<br/>
(weaving)  Time to fight. I pull some mob (harpy or something) and we do<br/>
ok, but I notice the only song icons I see are my own.  After the<br/>
battle, I asked the other bard if he knew how to weave songs.  No.  Time<br/>
for a lesson - he does now.<br/>
<br/>
(take your beating)  A few battles later, a diseased rat decides to join<br/>
in and starts hitting us while we were already down on hit points.  The<br/>
rat really liked the other bard and his hitpoints were getting a bit<br/>
low.  I pulled out a harder hitting weapon and started playing the hymn,<br/>
in hopes of pulling the rat off him.  Unfortunately the other bard kept<br/>
running around in circles pulling the rat out of my view so I would<br/>
miss.  He said &quot;attack it!&quot;  and I replied &quot;stay still&quot; and then he<br/>
died.  sigh.  When he came back I explained to him how it is better to<br/>
stay still, stop fighting and take the beating so I could pull off the<br/>
mob.  We didn&#39;t have any more trouble after that.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I had a good time with this bard.  Once he learned a few<br/>
basics we made a great team.  I just chuckled everytime I saw an example<br/>
of one this list&#39;s recent discussions.  Oh, and the best part - just<br/>
minutes after commenting on the lack of minotaur horns on the minotaur<br/>
slavers, and right after saying I needed to camp and could only fight<br/>
one more mob, I spotted a slaver with a horn in his hand!  I now have my<br/>
own horn.  Can&#39;t use it yet, but it was fun getting my first dropped<br/>
bard item.  (The other bard already have one, courtesy of his druid :)<br/>
