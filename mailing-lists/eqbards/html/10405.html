<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550022194">Guyss, and gals... You are not running slower. it just looks like you are.<br/>
especially in large zones. Try sliding your clipping plane back<br/>
and as for dying in Kithico, get used to it. you can&#39;t outrun those things<br/>
very easily<br/>

I noticed all night last night that I was running slower than normal which<br/>
in turn got me killed in the &quot;NEW KITHCOR WOODS&quot; arg :) anyone notice this<br/>
also. I was thinking it was lag but comeon I have a Cable modem lag to me is<br/>
almost nonexistant. Anyone see that same?<br/>
