&gt; I loot and pay for the Guise, I&#39;m leaving Lower Guk.  How far away is the<br/>
&gt; spawn point for the Guise from the zone border?  can someone give me the<br/>

will kos you on the way there (as in, there are live things that don&#39;t<br/>
fall under regular froglok faction and will kos you despite having good<br/>
froglok faction).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Probably not.  If you&#39;re attacked while looting, you&#39;ll have to<br/>
train back through 14 undead frog spawns, 5 greater iced bones, and 1<br/>
vampire bat (which is the one non-undead spawns you&#39;re forced to deal with<br/>
on the way from the upper guk zone line to the assassin spawn).<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
From the zone line... go down the ramp until the path splits, take the<br/>
right fork and follow it to the water.  Swim right along the bottom until<br/>
the path ends, and surface into the bedroom.  You&#39;ll see 2 paths out of<br/>
the bedroom, technically both paths lead to the same room, but take the<br/>
left one and bear left into a hallway, stay along the right edge of the<br/>
hallway and you&#39;ll run past 5 greater iced bones.  You&#39;ll come up to a<br/>
bridge and run straight across into the tower.  The assassin is in the<br/>
tower.  I&#39;m not going to go into the specifics of the tower itself, but<br/>
this should be plenty to get you started.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful.<br/>
