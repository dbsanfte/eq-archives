<div id="ygrps-yiv-840641489"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; on a test server, i doubt they make tape backups of characters as often as<br/>

 </span></blockquote>a test<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; server?<br/>
<br/>

time.  a test server is likely to have *more* of these problems and requires<br/>
more frequent backups. when i write code, i save and keep several<br/>
generations of saves (both souce code & databases.)  test environments have<br/>
a greater chance of things going wrong and require more - not less - robust<br/>
backups.<br/>
<br/>
otherwise you lose time and effort.<br/>
<br/>
who do you suppose is going to test &quot;the hole&quot; now?  GM-Joe will buff his 6<br/>
or 12 bud&#39;s (and do you think one of them will be a bard?) to level<br/>
50-55-60; equip them with full lusterous russet, all the weps they want.<br/>
and ya know what? they will still have the Fanged Skull Stilleto in the off<br/>
hand and none of them will have an /assist key and they will get &#39;owned&#39;<br/>
just like before.  the real testing will be done by the players on the live<br/>
servers - who have normal - well normally acquired - gear and know how to<br/>
play. and try the really creative stuff - charm Cazic; chain/fear<br/>
Vox/Nag/Trak; discover sublties like the rune buff for Venril; 16 buff for<br/>
Vox; etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
no wait, maybe they will port Aradune and his regular group (they gotta be<br/>
mid-30&#39;s by now) over to test and the ranger with the flaming sword will<br/>
lead the way. Aradune tells the group, &quot;can ne1 summon some water for me?&quot;<br/>
A_Bard_00 begins to cast a spell...<br/>
