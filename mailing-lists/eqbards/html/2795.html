=&lt;!--a--&gt; message board: <br/>
First I would like to thank the posters on this forum for all of your<br/>
thoughtful postings.. I would like to address some suggestions brought up by<br/>
Khadgarr; <br/>
1. GIVE SOME DECENT EXP. AND LOOT FOR DOING QUESTS!!!!!!!!!! You have the<br/>
ability to reward other playstyles (i.e. Questing) SIMPLY by taking the<br/>
already existing quests and making them worth more exp. and loot. You could<br/>
then follow that up by making some more interesting quests. <br/>
This is a major focus of the development team at this time, loot should be<br/>
getting better on existing quests slowly but surely. As well as additional<br/>
quests being implimented. The EXP rewards are being looked at as well but<br/>
they present a different challenge and a bit of a catch-22 which I will get<br/>
into below. <br/>
2. Give a small amount of exp. every time someone successfully completes a<br/>
trade skill. <br/>
This is a possibility as well, but i would bet our definitions of &quot;small&quot;<br/>
vary quite a bit. (see catch-22) <br/>
3. Give exp. the first time a person steps foot in a new town/continent. <br/>
This, unfortunately, would require much more programming and data<br/>
restructuring than it would seem.. doubtful at best. <br/>
4. Have loot spawn in a chest in a random room in an Inn every so often. <br/>
5. Have loot spawn randomly in the forest in the middle of no where every so<br/>
often. <br/>
6. Have a special item hidden under a rock in the forest. <br/>
7. Have loot spawn randomly at the bottom of a river. <br/>
All these are basically the same thing, spawning items in the world. We are<br/>
doing this to a VERY limited extent now for certain quests. Could it be used<br/>
more often? Sure. Will it? Most definately. <br/>
8. Make really low level creatures spawn every so often with 4 plat on them.<br/>
<br/>
A low level monster with higher level treasure. Does this happen now? Yes.<br/>
Could it happen more? Yes. Will it? Yes. But once again the definition of<br/>
&quot;more&quot; comes into question.. <br/>
9. Make players answer riddles/puzzles for exp./loot. <br/>
Questions or riddles anwsered or solved are part of some current quests. Can<br/>
these be quests in and of themselves? For EXP reward? Under current<br/>
conditions, no. They would be too abusable. For any kind of loot reward?<br/>
Yes. We could add riddle quests that pay out &quot;Lore Items&quot; (items which you<br/>
have only one of in your possession at any given time) the problem with that<br/>
then becomes, you have to assume that everyone knows the answer (ah.. the<br/>
web is a wonderfull thing) and whatever the reward is has basically become<br/>
&quot;newbie equipment&quot; and if it is worth having, everyone in the game WILL have<br/>
it. So will we have these types of quests for lore items? Yes. But they will<br/>
be fewer and farther between and the rewards probably not as great because<br/>
they potentially could greatly disrupt the balance of the game. Now, riddles<br/>
as a component of bigger quests? Yes, we have more of these going in all the<br/>
time. <br/>
10. Make a maze, and players who get through it get exp. <br/>
Something like this could be implimented with existing geometry, The Gorge<br/>
of King Xorbb or the maze in Cazic-Thule or the Qeynos Aquaducts come to<br/>
mind and there are quests that require you to traverse those things.. But<br/>
could just the act of traversing the maze gain you EXP without interacting<br/>
with any NPCS? No. Not at this time and I doubt that will be changing. But<br/>
could we have more quests that take place within and requiring you to travel<br/>
through these maze like areas? Sure. And we will. Will there be more maze<br/>
like areas added in the future with the EQ Expansion or Paineel and The<br/>
Hole? Bet on it. <br/>
11. The first time that a player casts a particular spell he gets exp. <br/>
This is something that is more complicated than it might seem and would<br/>
require new data structures.. I don&#39;t think we will see this. Now, after<br/>
saying that.. Could we add a small EXP component to Scribing a new spell in<br/>
your book?? Hmmm.. <br/>
12. Make a gambling place (or simply an NPC that plays a gambling game with<br/>
you for a prize). <br/>
There are a few quests that mimic &quot;gambling&quot; but a &quot;gambling place&quot; is<br/>
something we are looking into... <br/>
13. Reward the 1000th customer at a particular store. <br/>
Sounds simple but would require some data restructuring and addional code<br/>
that I dont think we will have. <br/>
14. Make an NPC that appears randomly, gives someone an item/quest, then<br/>
disappears. <br/>
This does happen now. Could it happen more? Yes. <br/>
15. Have bards put on plays in the town square. <br/>
There are NPC bards that sing in some of the taverns and such but we really<br/>
wanted to keep this type of action to a minimium so that extended NPC &quot;spam&quot;<br/>
doesnt clog up an area where player driven events might be occuring. Now,<br/>
that being said, will we have more Dynamic GM run events like this? Yes. <br/>
16. Give exp. to the first person who talks to a new NPC. <br/>
(See answer to # 13 above... ) <br/>
17. Have a drinking contest in a bar. <br/>
18. Have an archery contest in the woods. <br/>
19. Have a contest where the person who hits the bag the hardest gets a<br/>
prize. <br/>
Yes. We will have (are having)things such as this in the form of Dynamic GM<br/>
driven events. (Also I must mention that there are many VERY good player<br/>
driven events happening all the time.) <br/>
20. Randomly have the bank make a money error in your favor. <br/>
hmm.. How about in the banks favor? I think the banks are going to be<br/>
staying as they are but maybe.. <br/>
OK, now the Catch-22 I mentioned about high EXP rewards for quests and other<br/>
non-combat related actions. Given the current basic rules of EQ, non-combat<br/>
EXP gains must always suppliment combat EXP and not replace it. If we were<br/>
to allow players to advance solely by doing quests and other non-combat<br/>
related actions we would generally be doing the player a diservice given the<br/>
current &quot;rules&quot; for EverQuest. In EverQuest, your character&#39;s ability to<br/>
survive is based upon three things. Your Experience Level, your Skills, and<br/>
your Equipment/Spells. (well 4 things really, player knowledge and skill<br/>
count quite a bit as well) Any ONE of these things is not enough. While it<br/>
would be possible to gain EXP and EQ though solely questing, Skills are only<br/>
gained by using them.. using them ALOT. A character who gained his levels<br/>
and equipment solely through questing would always be statistically worse<br/>
than a character who adventured and participated in combat. Now what does<br/>
that matter to someone who just wants to roleplay a merchant and doesnt give<br/>
two hoots about stupid stats and numbers? It doesnt. Until they want to take<br/>
part in GM run quest through the heart of the Plane of Fear and get<br/>
slaughtered while characters of their same level and equipped identically<br/>
survive without a problem. At that point there is no going back. Anything<br/>
that they could possibly gain combat skills off of, due to thier level, will<br/>
kill them in two hits. With EverQuest&#39;s current structure, there are no<br/>
avenues open for that character at that point besides being the town<br/>
dwelling merchant. Is that bad? It would be, for someone who didnt realize<br/>
the choice they were making by completing all those high EXP quests and<br/>
avoiding combat on thier way to higher levels. <br/>
Now that being said, are the current EXP rewards to low? In some cases, yes.<br/>
Are we working to make quests more rewarding in both loot and EXP? Yes.<br/>
Ideally quest rewards would be roughly worth the time invested. In actual<br/>
practice this will be seen more in the quality of LOOT rewarded as opposed<br/>
to great increases in EXP or Faction rewards. <br/>
Is it a perfect system? Nope. But, it IS a good start for Massivly<br/>
Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games of this scale. Just like the D&D red<br/>
boxed Basic Set (or the three brown booklets, depending on how old school<br/>
you are... was a good start for pen and paper role playing. <br/>
Just one (or two) general word(s) of advice, don&#39;t play EverQuest like a<br/>
racing game.. sure you CAN, but it really is MUCH more fun if you slow down,<br/>
meet some people, roleplay and explore. Do some quests because your<br/>
character wants to help the person giving the quest, not for the reward you<br/>
would get for helping. Heck, try that in real life too. <br/>
Well I have yakked on enough, thanks for taking the time to read this, hope<br/>
it helped more than hurt.. <br/>

Can anyone tell me the use of qeusts? I completed the string quest at the <br/>
qeynos bard guild and only got 2 copper, some faction hits and a litle bit <br/>
of exp for about a 1,5 hour walk. That was when i was a low level ( at +- 7 <br/>
), now i am 11 and recently moved to freeport,i love selo&#39;s and the drum, my<br/>
<br/>
shadowknight friend (who&#39;s not as evil as you migth think) was very jealous,<br/>
<br/>
he walked twice as long as i did from qeynos to freeport :)...<br/>
<br/>
But i&#39;m drifting of, can you tell me what the reward for most quests is, <br/>
because walking for 1,5 hour and getting 2 copper is not worth it.<br/>
And getting exp figthing is much cooler than running.<br/>
