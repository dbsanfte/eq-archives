&gt; I too have recently been hunting Aviaks in South K.  I have been in several<br/>
&gt; groups there fighting for the last 3-4 nights.  While I have never grouped<br/>
&gt; with a bard while there, I have paired up (fighting in a group of 2) with<br/>
&gt; several different classes.  Namely, A Druid, A Shaman, A Paladin, A Ranger,<br/>
&gt; and a Necromancer.  In each of these cases I have had a problem that I as a<br/>
&gt; bard have never run into.  I was unable to taunt Aviaks off my partner.  For<br/>
&gt; once I would be the one ending battle with most of my health, while my<br/>
&gt; partner was near death.  This is nice but unsetteling.  Even with Lullabye I<br/>
&gt; would have a terrible time trying to get my share of dammage.  I think that<br/>
&gt; some of this is because at 20th level I am getting a lot of resists from<br/>
&gt; Darters and Rooks.  But it cant be just that.  So I think that there is some<br/>
&gt; other reason that Im not getting mobed as much.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The possible answer to this is faction. If the extra mob hate for bards<br/>
is done intentionally by Verant, it&#39;s possible they base it on faction.<br/>
As it&#39;s been noted the Avaiks have no faction it&#39;s also possible they<br/>
haven&#39;t been programmed to hate any factions either. I would say if you<br/>
took away the magic thing that makes bards and bard songs the top hated<br/>
thing by mobs you would probably rarely end up at the top of their hate<br/>
list by your own efforts, as you would rarely if ever do more damage<br/>
than anyone else in your party. Even the benefits of the heal song would<br/>
be quickly eclipsed by the first heal cast by a cleric/druid/shaman of<br/>
your level.<br/>
