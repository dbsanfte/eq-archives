<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587911368">Hmm sounds like you&#39;re letting your group dictate how to play your class.<br/>
DONT buy into it.  You know how to be a bard better than they do.  Hymn is<br/>
NOT that big a taunt.  Especially in today&#39;s dungeons.  They&#39;re _hardly_<br/>
dangerous.  I can walk the entire length of lower guk, live to dead side,<br/>
and I might actually pull a train of 3 critters.<br/>
<br/>
Play your class the way you think it should be played.  Generally I find out<br/>
who&#39;s doing what and then I go, OK, I&#39;m going to be doing X.  If they argue<br/>
I simply state &quot;You be a (insert class here), I&#39;ll be a Bard.  If you don&#39;t<br/>
like it, lets trade accounts&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That usually shuts them up.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line:  You play your character, don&#39;t let others tell you how :)<br/>

&gt; Our enchanter seems to have no trouble keeping both tanks Alacrity&#39;d thru<br/>
&gt; the night and still does crowd control.  Yes I could give us all a<br/>
speedup,<br/>
&gt; but since the only other person even meleeing is a cleric it wouldn&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; much.  My finger-twiddling is much better spent on Chant of Battle if the<br/>
&gt; enchanter is there to Alacrity.  If he&#39;s not then Anthem gets back in the<br/>
&gt; mix.  If bards excel at anything its that we can fill in as a substitute<br/>
&gt; just-about-anything.  Problem I&#39;m starting to find is that I&#39;m only able<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; get into groups that are lacking something if there isn&#39;t a person looking<br/>
&gt; to group who&#39;s better at that thing as a primary role.  When I do get in<br/>
&gt; lately its always as a tank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last 3 nites:  Don&#39;t chain, we&#39;re darknessing.  Don&#39;t anthem we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; alacritying.  Don&#39;t Chant we&#39;re skin like something or othering.  Don&#39;t<br/>
Hymn<br/>
&gt; or you&#39;ll get too much attention and die.  Didn&#39;t leave much of anything<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; me to do but swing, bellow and go owie.  Occasionally we&#39;d pull a wizard<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; shaman gobie and I&#39;d throw the resistances in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Towards the end of the night I get asked in group tell, &quot;Can&#39;t you do<br/>
&gt; anything but Bellow?  I thought bards had all kinds of cool songs.&quot;  My<br/>
&gt; reply?  Didn&#39;t have one, told them &quot;I am retiring to the OOT to<br/>
contemplate<br/>
&gt; life while beating head on gargoyles for a while.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Swift Like the Wind costs a LOT of mana, and doesn&#39;t last as long as<br/>
&gt; the lower level speed up buff. Add onto this that there is a speed<br/>
&gt; beyond which a weapon can&#39;t get any faster. And Swift Like the Wind,<br/>
&gt; in higher levels, isn&#39;t even used on people with haste sashes. Not<br/>
&gt; worth it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So. Sometimes a minor speedup is good enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quicken is very definitely a combat buff. And fairly high mana. Grouped,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d put it on my main tank and let a bard handle the speedup for the<br/>
&gt; rest, preferring to use mana for crowd control, or other circumstances<br/>
&gt; rather than keeping everyone Quickened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just because it is better does not mean that it is always the best<br/>
&gt; use of the enchanter&#39;s mana. Bards ARE Still needed.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;From Eq Casters Realm:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Swift Like The Wind<br/>
&gt; &gt;---------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt;Target: Increase Attack Speed +160.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Description:Great for tanks when grouped. Increases the amount of times<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;will hit in a round against an enemy. In large/long battles it can make a<br/>
&gt; &gt;huge difference. Quite deadly when used in conjunction with Languid<br/>
&gt; &gt;Pace/Tepid Deeds. Combine these 2 spells when possible.. talk<br/>
&gt; &gt;about breaking<br/>
&gt; &gt;the odds. Slows down your opponent, increases your attack rate<br/>
&gt; &gt;This spell doesn&#39;t stack with Augmentation, but as such it provides over<br/>
&gt; &gt;double the attack speed for the target and is usually preferred anyway.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; &gt;other important thing is that this spell helps increase combat skill gain<br/>
&gt; &gt;since you are making more skill rolls with your attack.<br/>
&gt; &gt;----------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, when SLTW &quot; provides over double the attack speed &quot; - it hardly<br/>
matters<br/>
&gt; &gt;if VoV does a 35.271% increase or a 36.983% increase.  Enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt;speed buffs<br/>
&gt; &gt;are where it&#39;s at.  I use Warsong because my enchanter wont give me SLTW.<br/>
&gt; &gt;She says she does not want me to die that quickly.  But then again<br/>
Innoruuk<br/>
&gt; &gt;killed her and not me ;p<br/>
