<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Lock picking the Hole <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289006459">For me at least - the initial training point got my skill high enough to<br/>
pick The Hole lock every try.  I would recommend keeping an extra pick or<br/>
two in the bank in case you die - a very likely possibility in The Hole.<br/>

I think they covered it - all but you may need to go to bard guild and train<br/>
the initial point to start the skill - can&#39;t remember if you need to or not.<br/>
Pick locks sounded so cool - little did I know where those locks would be<br/>
and such.<br/>
