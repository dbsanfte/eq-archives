&gt;I consistently read all over the net how members of certain melee classes <br/>
&gt;are sick and tired of having to go on 4 or 5 zone spanning runs to get back <br/>
&gt;to their body. Who are these folks kidding? The only zone that is 4 zones <br/>
&gt;away from a bind point is Nagafen&#39;s Lair. (Nag&#39;s Lair-&gt;Solusk <br/>
&gt;A-&gt;Lavastorm-&gt;Nektulos-&gt;Neriak Foreign Quarter.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All of the other zones in the world are usually only 2, sometimes 3, zones <br/>
&gt;away from a bind point. Is it just that folks aren&#39;t aware what the <br/>
&gt;bind-able zones are? Or maybe good aligned characters don&#39;t realize they can <br/>
&gt;be bound in evil cities just like good cities? Is a two zone run THAT bad? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I challenge you.<br/>
Get bound in Erudin at 3am EST.<br/>
Or Arena for that matter.<br/>
And what do you do if a guard has been trained to the entrance of the evil<br/>
city you are bound in?<br/>

an hour.)</div>
