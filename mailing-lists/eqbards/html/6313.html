<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044245287"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have been playing since April and I am only at &gt;level 26 now so I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will be lucky if I hit 50 before &gt;the add-on comes out, so with that in<br/>
mind I have a &gt;long life ahead of my character.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. I&#39;m worse off than this. I&#39;ve been a bard since the third day of<br/>
release, and I&#39;m about half way through 15. I play about 3 hours a day,<br/>
and not too often on weekends. <br/>
<br/>
I have noticed something, and I was wondering if anyone has experience<br/>
this, or if it is just my imagination. I regularly group with a human<br/>
ranger, have been since I was level 4. When I group with her, I get<br/>
little to no experience. When I group with other people, I get normal<br/>
experience. We have been grouped, and we&#39;ll be killing things that we<br/>
can kill, and she&#39;ll talk about how her experience is good, but I won&#39;t<br/>
notice much of a difference in my experince. Is she sucking my<br/>
experience dry or what?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all. I&#39;ll be 16 soon. I am aching to be 17, as I have an<br/>
ashenwood short spear I am dying to dual wield. Too bad my piercing<br/>
stinks now or I would use it now.<br/>
<br/>
Oh. By the way. I tried to reproduce the &quot;concert&quot; that Harmonic<br/>
Distortion did in Blackburrow. It was pretty fun. Gnolls would run to<br/>
me, and I was standing there playing Lullaby while others killed them.<br/>
(Will the range of Lullaby increase as my level increases?) Many people<br/>
were impressed at how they didn&#39;t have to run to zone like they thought<br/>
they would, but the big ones still broke out of the trance and got<br/>
enough hits on me to make me need to zone. Ah well. This song is fun<br/>
and will continue to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
May your feet stand firmly on the ground,<br/>
