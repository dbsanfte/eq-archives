&gt; I kicked on the jboots and lev song and slowly dragged the dino way out<br/>
&gt; into the ocean, back to the seafury island. Here I used him to slay<br/>
Gornit,<br/>
&gt; who had a fine steel war hammer. I gave this too him and OMFG that was one<br/>
&gt; big hammer. But it made me realize that he could now dual wield. So I<br/>
&gt; dropped Dixl and gave him a rusty rapier. I now had a level 50 pet hitting<br/>
&gt; for quad 137. I told him to attack a seafury, he killed it in under 40<br/>
&gt; seconds. I killed a few more, incredible exp. Literally killing a seafury<br/>
&gt; every minute. Only taking a break every few clops to run around twisting<br/>
&gt; [...] <br/>
&gt; I kept this up for about an hour, making nearly a bub of exp. I think went<br/>
&gt; LD and lost half of it!  Oops. Serves me right I suppose, these kind of<br/>
&gt; tactics are exactly the reason our charm song was capped at level 37 to<br/>
&gt; begin with and it most likely is not in my best interest to be exploiting<br/>
&gt; them. Err.. what am I saying. This tactic OWNS! Enjoy it while it lasts, I<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, I can get close to a bubble of exp an hour<br/>
killing the seafuries with just 1 or 2 other people.  Your<br/>
kill rate there with a bard in the party should be non-stop.  <br/>
I (puller) reguarly make my monk friend run out of stamina<br/>
when we&#39;re fighting there.<br/>
<br/>
Also keep in mind that this song was put in with the expansion<br/>
in mind.  Charming a L50 mob post-Kunark should be regarded as<br/>
no different from charming a L35-40 mob now.  Yeah if you<br/>
charm a hill giant in Rathe, let it dual wield, and make it<br/>
kill giant skeletons and cyclopses it rules, but does anyone<br/>
care?<br/>
