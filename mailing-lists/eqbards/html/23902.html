I sort of agree here... although I think the large raid scenario is in a<br/>
class by itself.  As a shaman you might say I&#39;m &quot;very valuable&quot; on a large<br/>
raid.  Last night we tried Dain again (and failed due to HUAS &quot;Head Up A**<br/>
Syndrome) and I did absolutely NOTHING.  Literally.  Halana is 59 = no<br/>
focus, no torpor, no malo... also she does not have a vp hammer, so my buffs<br/>
are low level and mana inefficient.  Clerics have bp heals... and not even<br/>
gonna SEE what happens if I try to slow Dain *grins*<br/>
<br/>
Also, in my guild, bards are invaluable on large raids, but they become<br/>
specialists, twisting resists mostly... which probably feels like<br/>
&quot;uselessness&quot; to a bard who is used to playing varied roles.<br/>
<br/>
I think class value on a large raid depends on a combination of factors:<br/>
level, class, and often, equipment.  In my opinion, Hybrids (including Bards<br/>
here) are made by their gear.    Give a ranger their epic swords and its<br/>
like the game has been reinvented for them.  Give a shaman her epic spear<br/>
and *yawn* goodie, a mediocre dot... changes nothing.  Just a couple<br/>
examples from my limited perspective.   <br/>

&gt; &gt;I think that bards are probably over powered in the pre 50 <br/>
&gt; game and under<br/>
&gt; &gt;powered in the post 50 game.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I see absolutely nothing in this patch that addresses EITHER of those<br/>
&gt; &gt;beliefs. Furthermore, assuming that my personal belief is <br/>
&gt; incorrect, I see<br/>
&gt; &gt;nothing that does the opposite. Based on what I see in this <br/>
&gt; patch, I have to<br/>
&gt; &gt;conclude that bards are perfect and all the other classes <br/>
&gt; are being balanced<br/>
&gt; &gt;to match them, only I&#39;m not seeing any reduction of power in <br/>
&gt; the other<br/>
&gt; &gt;classes post 50, in fact, I&#39;m seeing modest improvements for them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; bards are not really underpowered in the post 50 game imo.  they are<br/>
&gt; only underpowered on large multigroup raids.  why is this?  because<br/>
&gt; bards are best at being flexible and filling in the gaps of <br/>
&gt; abilities not<br/>
&gt; represented in the group.  generally in most well organized <br/>
&gt; large multigroup<br/>
&gt; raids, all abilities ARE represented, leaving little for the <br/>
&gt; bard to do.<br/>
&gt; i would say that bards are overpowered in most single group scenarios<br/>
&gt; (even post 50) and underpowered in most multi group raids which seems<br/>
&gt; as a whole compared to other classes to be overpowered.  paladins/sks/<br/>
&gt; necros/druids/mages/rangers all are underpowered in the large <br/>
&gt; raid type encounters.<br/>
&gt; but they also aren&#39;t any more powerful in single group <br/>
&gt; scenarios or unbalanced<br/>
&gt; group scenarios either.  necros and druids are slightly <br/>
&gt; compensated in that they<br/>
&gt; can solo well for most of their careers if they choose to.  <br/>
&gt; but the other hybrids<br/>
&gt; seem to need some sort of enhancement.<br/>
