<b>Subject:</b> RE: Binding grrrr <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-381641051">Ok, I just don&#39;t understand what all the argument is about<br/>
on this issue.  I think bards are smack dab in the middle of the class<br/>
spectrum. Whether that makes them &quot;hybrid&quot; or not I&#39;m not going to argue.<br/>
Fact is, bards don&#39;t get bind.  Whether they &quot;should&quot; or not is irrelevant<br/>
in my opinion.  We get selo&#39;s, we get locate corpse and invis.  All three<br/>
things make any corpse retrieval easier than any other class that doesn&#39;t<br/>
get bind.  Today I died in Oasis, and ran from the Arena (ack! Forgot to<br/>
bind in Freeport), through the feeerrrroooottttt (spectre was in residence).<br/>
This is a trip I have seen many a higher level than me (17) warrior die on.<br/>
So I&#39;m not complaining.<br/>
<br/>
		I really like this game and despite the amount of grumbling<br/>
I hear about class balance, I think Verant has done a pretty damn good job.<br/>
Sure there is room for improvement, there always is.  But frankly, if you<br/>
want bind and gate, play a class that GETS bind and gate :-).  It&#39;s like a<br/>
Shaman complaining we &quot;only&quot; get Alacrity, not the high end Enchanter swift<br/>
like the wind.  I personally like the fact that NO class (no, not even<br/>
necros) are a master of everything.  Makes interaction more necessary and<br/>
more fun.<br/>
<br/>
		I love this game :-)<br/>
		And I love you all...<br/>
