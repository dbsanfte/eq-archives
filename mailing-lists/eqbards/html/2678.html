&gt;So we are all real good online Bards and have excellent musical abilities to<br/>
&gt;the point of powerful magic, etc.  But what about in /ooc real life? Anyone<br/>
&gt;have any talent or interest?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me too much of my own story - an older brother I worshipped<br/>
never letting me forget that I couldn&#39;t carry a tune in a bucket.  So<br/>
what&#39;d I do? Go off and play a Bard in a live-action RPG ;)  Thing is, I<br/>
fell in love with the class so much that I taught myself to sing, and now I<br/>
perform at Bardics, campfires and coronations - I reckon I must&#39;ve gotten<br/>
past my problems *chuckles*<br/>
I also play drums, keyboards, penny whistle, and can strum a guitar (but<br/>
that&#39;s about the limit there).<br/>
The &#39;other Talies&#39; (My character on DR) is also a Bard, and also a<br/>
performer - two weeks after joining DR, I &#39;performed&#39; a song I wrote for<br/>
the first Bardic competition (then sponsored by Nynis Goldkeeper, a<br/>
trader).  Somehow, I won... And I&#39;ve been a member of the Troupe of the<br/>
Four Winds ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Although I don&#39;t write as much of my own material these days, I do collect<br/>
folk and filk songs, and am working on databasing it all at<br/>
