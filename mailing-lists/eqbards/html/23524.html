Got another question for you.  Some of the songs have &quot;L#&quot; in Column F.<br/>
What does the &quot;L#&quot; entry supposed to indicate?<br/>
<br/>
Might be a problem with Chant of Battle.  When I input any number from 38-60<br/>
for my level, &quot;L38&quot; is listed in Column F.  If I type in 36 or 37, this<br/>
changes to &quot;L36&quot;.  Any number from 22-35 results in &quot;L22&quot;.  Didn&#39;t try out<br/>
any lower numbers.  In addition to the &quot;L#&quot; changes, the amount of the<br/>
STR/DEX buff changes as well.  Now I haven&#39;t tested Chant of Battle any time<br/>
recently to see how much STR/DEX it buffs at level 50, but based on your<br/>
spreadsheet it maxes at L38.  Any other level higher than 38 has no impact<br/>
on the amount of STR/DEX buff.  <br/>
<br/>
In addition, when I input &quot;50&quot; for my level, there are several other songs<br/>
which have a &quot;L#&quot; lower than 50.  For songs 7,9,13 and 17, &quot;L36&quot; is listed.<br/>
For songs 18, 20, 38 and 46, &quot;L38&quot; is listed.  What exactly does that mean?<br/>
<br/>
One other correction.  For level 49 Shield of Songs, you have that listed as<br/>
Singing only with a 20 pt runeshield.  Need to add in Lute and 40 pt<br/>
runeshield as well.<br/>
<br/>
BTW great job.<br/>

<br/>
Sorry about the error, and thanks again Galtin.  The new version is <br/>
out:<br/>
<br/>
FYI: This is an excell spreadsheet that will calculate the effects of <br/>
a song, given your level and instrument bonuses.  It also has useful <br/>
stacking info as well, and is designed to be a reference sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Fixed the bugs in the chant damages, which were 1.5 higher than they <br/>
should have been...<br/>
<br/>
Change:<br/>
The DoT&#39;s (2, 18, 30, 38, 46,48) incorrectly had a 1.5 multiplier.  <br/>
This was fixed.  (Thanks Galtin)<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s Cessation (48) has a -16% attack speed.<br/>
<br/>
Again, right click and do a &quot;Save Target As...&quot;.  Clicking on the <br/>
links will not work.<br/>

Hopefully, a version will pop up at eqsongs.com shortly.<br/>

&gt;    Thank you very much for pointing this out!  Apparently, I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; multiplied by 1.5 twice (actually, the fomula&#39;s were PvE and I <br/>
&gt; thought they were PvP.)  When I remove this factor, I&#39;m within one <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; two points of the numbers reported there.  However, I&#39;ve some other <br/>
&gt; sources of numbers that contradict those (sigh).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry all for the mistake, and expect a new version of this <br/>
shortly :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; The damage values for the 3 chant songs don&#39;t seem to be <br/>
calculated<br/>
&gt; &gt; correctly.  Based on the info on the eqsongs website, at 50th <br/>
level <br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Selos Drum I should be doing the following amount of damage:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Level 30:  31 base damage per tick/42 per tick with Selos <br/>
Drum/125 <br/>
&gt; total for<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 ticks.  Your spreadsheet lists 62 damage total for 50th level <br/>
&gt; with Selos<br/>
&gt; &gt; drum<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Level 38:  48 base damage per tick/65 per tick with Selos <br/>
drum/195 <br/>
&gt; total for<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 ticks.  Your spreadsheet lists 93 damage total for 50th level <br/>
&gt; with Selos<br/>
&gt; &gt; drum.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Level 46:  Same as 38 except your spreadsheet list 95 damage <br/>
total <br/>
&gt; for 50th<br/>
&gt; &gt; level with Selos drum.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the values that are listed take into account the 2/3 PvP <br/>
&gt; penalty.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But even if you factor that in, the values don&#39;t seem to be <br/>
&gt; correct.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also the speed debuff and damage values for Chords of Cessation <br/>
do <br/>
&gt; not match<br/>
&gt; &gt; up with the values posted on eqsongs.  EQsongs lists the damage <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; 50pts per<br/>
&gt; &gt; tick while you list 75.  Eqsongs lists the speed debuff as 16% <br/>
&gt; while you<br/>
&gt; &gt; list 30%. <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry that it&#39;s a little late.  I&#39;ve been working on a side <br/>
&gt; project.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; If anyone knows anything about interrupts generated by a <br/>
keyboard, <br/>
&gt; &gt; please send me an e-mail (hint hint hint).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Changes from the previous version are:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jothan&#39;s Provocation does not have a Dam Ab Shld and has 50% haste<br/>
&gt; &gt; Niv&#39;s doesn&#39;t stick with song of shields.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Song of Twilight effects were listed under song of Dawn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Vov (50) is 30% haste.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Johnthan&#39;s Prov (45) is Self only, voice and it&#39;s effects are <br/>
&gt; &gt; currently unknown.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Melody of Ervaj is now 50.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Celerity (36) is 20% haste.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Major Change: Since there are large holes in the damage tables, <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; &gt; DoT songs (2, 18, 30, 38, 46, 48) now use formulas instead of <br/>
&gt; tables; <br/>
&gt; &gt; these formulas are close, but not necessarily as accurate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As in the last time, right click and do a &quot;Save Target As...&quot; on <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; files.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You can get a .zip version here:<br/>
