&gt; Heh only 200 50.  The diffrence is these 50&#39;s are not the average player we<br/>
&gt; are all huge addicts and play a good 10 hours a day usually. So maybe you<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which is irrelevant from Verant&#39;s financial viewpoint because<br/>
they pay just as much as the person who plays 2 hours a week -<br/>
$9.69 a month.  For some reason you seem to think that the<br/>
fact that you put more hours per day into this game should<br/>
give you some sort of higher priority.  It doesn&#39;t.  All those<br/>
hours you put into the game beyond what the average player<br/>
puts in is subsidized by all the people who play fewer hours<br/>
than the average player.  Without them, this game would be<br/>
costing you on the order of $100/mo.<br/>

conservative estimate) 7700 L1-45 players.  86% of the money<br/>
for this game is coming from non-L46-50 players.  Given an<br/>
either/or choice, do they ignore 7700 players and risk losing<br/>
86% of their income, or ignore 1300 players and risk losing<br/>
14% of their income?  That&#39;s a no-brainer to me, despite my<br/>
main character being L45.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; planes and I guess lower guk and sol b but they have level 30&#39;s in them and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s crowded in with the high levels. You also have kedge keep but the<br/>
&gt; spawns in there is like 4-6 hours on most mobs so 2 good groups can go in<br/>
&gt; and clear the spawns and leave. So you got sol b, lower guk, and the 3<br/>
&gt; planes. Now even when we did all the planes that&#39;s about 30-40 in each<br/>
&gt; plane. That&#39;s not even 10% of the 46+ people online. The dragons are a long<br/>
&gt; spawn so they get done quickly and fire giants are a 8 hour spawn to. So you<br/>
&gt; got all these 46+ people who play a good 10 hours at the least usually 5<br/>
&gt; hours a day. So why do you think were ocmplaining now?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone is arguing that the high level zones<br/>
aren&#39;t overcrowded.  What they&#39;re arguing is that L46+ stuff<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be Verant&#39;s top priority.<br/>
