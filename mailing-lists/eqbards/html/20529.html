<div id="ygrps-yiv-539757165">Well, I think your necro can easily get all the lambent pieces for your<br/>
bard.  I think lambent is some of the best non-planar stuff you can get, so<br/>
you&#39;re always good going for that.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for something a little different, there&#39;s always a Mith<br/>
BP, should be easy enough, and shin guantlets from Lower guk usually just<br/>
rot, so most wouldn&#39;t mind your bard going there and picking them up<br/>
(they&#39;re no-drop, I think).  The arms that come off the mino Patriarch are<br/>
good...  If you hunt in Karnor&#39;s, you might be able to pick him up some<br/>
singing steel boots.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say do the Lambent quests, they&#39;re usually better AC and stats than the<br/>
other things you can get, but if you don&#39;t want to quest, there are still<br/>
lots of other options.<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[eqbards] reincarnation time<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hiya, just killing time at work so i figured i&#39;d ask this question.  First<br/>
&gt; off let me state that my main character is a necro, lev 52 and that my<br/>
&gt; bard<br/>
&gt; lev 36 has been on the shelf for over 6 months. I dunno about all of you<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; i find 50+ levels to be extremely depressing, i feel like im taking one<br/>
&gt; step<br/>
&gt; forward 2 steps back. I find that in general all classes become extremely<br/>
&gt; powerfull over 50 but its brain numbing repetition. I been playing my<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; warrior (almost 14 with 400hp weeee). Its kinda cool to play a warrior, i<br/>
&gt; did 2 crippling blows in a row for 96 dmg to a kodiak at lev 12, i was in<br/>
&gt; shock. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But anyways, the reason im writing this is because im thinking of<br/>
&gt; restarting<br/>
&gt; my bard, but he&#39;s nekked (i stripped him when i started my necro). You<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; anything that you could suggest to re-equip with that is easy to obtain<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; my big boy necro? i need armor and weapons. He&#39;s got lambent arms or<br/>
&gt; bracer<br/>
&gt; still, and shin pants and gloves and his mask still, and i think he has a<br/>
&gt; barbute too, not sure. I was thinkin of goin to guk to get a carapace<br/>
&gt; maybe<br/>
&gt; for a bp till i get him something better. Any suggestions of something i<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; solo easily with my necro to give to him?  and weapons.... all i have is a<br/>
&gt; fs long sword hehe (if only my wakizashies on my ranger were not no drop).<br/>
&gt; maybe i could go terrorize the avatar of fear or something, but im hoping<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; avoid the claw. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as i think<br/>
&gt; its<br/>
&gt; time to take the dust off that old drummer boy. I think i&#39;d like to go to<br/>
&gt; hate one day with that bard<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your opinions/suggestions will not be taken lightly and will be greatly<br/>
&gt; appreciated<br/>
