&gt; If you are running a PII computer and think you need to <br/>
&gt; upgrade to a PIII to<br/>
&gt; play some of these new games, I&#39;d highly recommend dropping <br/>
&gt; the $300 or so<br/>
&gt; (got my GeForce for $275) on a new video card instead and buy yourself<br/>
&gt; another 6 to 9 months before your framerates start to go south.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, what if that PII is only a 300 w/ 64 MB RAM?  Worth getting the card or<br/>
should I stick to my original plan of buying a whole new PC this coming<br/>
winter?  &lt;sigh&gt; It&#39;s like deciding whether to keep sinking money into an<br/>
older car or buy another that you can barely afford.<br/>
<br/>
I always run low res so I can open bags from keypads.  Did someone say that<br/>
you don&#39;t see the improvement as much until you get up to 1024x768?  (Sorry,<br/>
deleted the message)<br/>
