<div id="ygrps-yiv-164362326">I was hunting beholder from the east karana side last week, pulling Chasm<br/>
and Gorge Minos to my other two teammates.  Everything was going great for<br/>
about an hour, until we decided to pull a few evil eyes.  While doing this I<br/>
equipped the drum.  After the first couple eyes we are all sitting there<br/>
resting, and everything from goblins and minor muds all the way up to chasms<br/>
and  evil eyes would come barreling out of the intersection once they got<br/>
within a certain range of us, although our resting area was normally well<br/>
out of the &quot;reaction&quot; zone we had previously been experiencing prior to my<br/>
using the drum.  <br/>
<br/>
I did not attribute it to the drum at that time, but it was definitely the<br/>
same effect.  So bad did it turn out to be that we had to leave the maze<br/>
altogether, because all of the crits seemed super aggressive.  By the way,<br/>
this was well after those couple of days where the creature aggressiveness<br/>
was all messed up.<br/>

However, I discovered inadvertently in the process<br/>
that playing songs that use the drum seem to REALLY anger mobs a lot<br/>
more..</div>
