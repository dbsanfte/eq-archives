<br/>
well, i work in a shop where we deal with this stuff, install it almost<br/>
every day...<br/>
i&#39;ve tried several firewalls, blackice, norton internet security, etc.  NONE<br/>
are completely safe.  Norton and blackice in particular, running on the same<br/>
machine, will find and block quite a few different things.<br/>
<br/>
if you want to be really safe, try a multi-prong attack, using a hardware<br/>
router (we sell several, most popular seems to be the netgear line, RT311,<br/>
RT314, etc.)  These provide NAT (network address translation) to hook<br/>
multiple machines to the net.  The upside here is that your actual IP<br/>
address is assigned to the hardware router, and you use internal<br/>
non-routable (i.e. non-traceable) addresses internally. (usually the<br/>
192.168.0.x range).  on each machine hooked through that router, run a<br/>
software firewall of some sort, black ice, norton, several others.  even<br/>
though the NAT blocks 99% of attacks, if you are still carrying a trojan or<br/>
a few other possibilities, it won&#39;t provide the protection you want.  the<br/>
software firewalls usally block 99% of the remaining 1%.  Use Norton<br/>
Antivirus, MacAffee&#39;s, or something and keep your machine scanned regularly.<br/>
most of all, NEVER open or run a program that comes from someone or<br/>
somewhere you don&#39;t trust, you&#39;ll be happier in the end if you never ran<br/>
that &#39;great swimsuit screensaver&#39; or whatever...<br/>
<br/>
incidentally, a combination of a hardware router and norton internet<br/>
security will run you about $250, depending on where/when you get it.  you<br/>
might get away with as little as $125 or so, or pay up to bill gates salary<br/>
for a really secure setup.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] OT: Recommendation for a home firewall<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if any of you out there are using firewall software in<br/>
&gt; conjunction with EQ.  I currently use Microsoft Internet Connection<br/>
sharing<br/>
&gt; on my home network, but havent installed any firewall software at all, and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; am a bit nervous about that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any recommendations?  I am currently looking at WinRoute Pro as a<br/>
solution.<br/>
