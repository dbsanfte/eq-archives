<br/>
&gt;This is a well-known bug, being teleported into lava somewhere beneath a<br/>
&gt;lava pool (therefore not being able to surface).  Why it hasn&#39;t been fixed<br/>
&gt;is beyond me, it would certainly take a load off the guides&#39; time.<br/>

code is causing this to happen.<br/>
<br/>
First, they have to have a set of circumstances that causes it to ALWAYS<br/>
happen. So they can run through them over and over, figuring out where their<br/>
code is messing things up. Go through line by line.<br/>
<br/>
A problem that happens occasionally can be a LOT more difficult to pin down.<br/>
Even when I know my users are having problems, in a much smaller program<br/>
I work on, it can take me a week or more to find where the problem is,<br/>
going line by line and trying to figure out why the code doesn&#39;t do what<br/>
it seems to be saying The problem could even end up being in entirely<br/>
different<br/>
code that just tangentially affects.<br/>
