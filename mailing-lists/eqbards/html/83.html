<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; It seems that when I play the drum those watching see me as if I were<br/>
&gt; &gt; strumming a flute and rather than the drum I hear the sweet sounds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; strings.  Perhaps some perverse enchanter has cast a twisted illusion upon<br/>
&gt; &gt; us.  Does anyone know if perchance the great powers of magic may some day<br/>
&gt; &gt; set this straight?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope this will be fixed someday.  It has been broken for as long as I<br/>
&gt; remember.  If they just made a model for holding a drum, that would be enough,<br/>
&gt; the strumming motion SORT OF looks like a tapping motion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My guess is that it will be fixed someday, but who knows.  Drums USED to look<br/>
&gt; like flutes, then they looked like chests, now they actually look like drums<br/>
&gt; (in your inventory at least) so things are getting better.<br/>

&gt; &gt; On another topic, recently I attained the 7th circle of skill and after<br/>
&gt; &gt; saving and even sacrificing a bit of personal jewelery was able to purchase<br/>
&gt; &gt; the scroll for the Whistling Warsong of the 7th circle.  Imagine my dismay<br/>
&gt; &gt; when what I thought was newfound power had less effect though concentrated<br/>
&gt; &gt; on me than the old 1st circle song with which we all start has on me and<br/>
&gt; &gt; all others in my adventuring group.  Can anyone encourage me that perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; some day my investment in the new song will be of some value?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The level 7 song is quite useful.  In addition to the changes you mention, it<br/>
&gt; speeds up your attacks somewhat, a small difference at first, but it gets more<br/>
&gt; noticeable later on.  The level 7 song is essentially a personal-only version<br/>
&gt; of the level 10 song, Anthem de Arms.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tip: When you get to level 10, try &quot;juggling&quot; both songs at the same time.  You<br/>
&gt; will notice a nice synergy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Likewise, I find the Jig o&#39; Vigor to be of no use.  Have I missed some good<br/>
&gt; &gt; and valued application?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not really, it&#39;s sort of useless.  Sometimes when running very long distances,<br/>
&gt; you will lose stamina.  Also, if you are without food and drink you may lose<br/>
&gt; stamina at a very increased rate.  Otherwise, it&#39;s not too good.<br/>
