<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I guess its the difference between a single shot effect, and a persistent<br/>
&gt;buff type effect.  A low level cleric can cast Holy Armor and Courage<br/>
&gt;(stacking with one key stroke each), they&#39;re stacked, he&#39;s done typing.<br/>
&gt;The Bard however cannot stack without continuous keystrokes (the twitch<br/>
&gt;part I take exception to).  If we&#39;re supposed to stack persistent songs ...<br/>
&gt;give us a mechanism that isn&#39;t &quot;twitch&quot; driven to do so.  Or stop<br/>
&gt;advertising that this isn&#39;t a twitch game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to take exception to labeling &quot;weaving&quot; songs (how&#39;s that instead<br/>
of twisting J.M. ?) as a twitch activity.  When you&#39;re waiting 4 seconds<br/>
between double keystrokes, it hardly qualifies.  Press 1, wait for effect,<br/>
press 1 (counts &quot;one one-thousand&quot; for recovery), press 2, wait for effect,<br/>
press 2, one one-thousand, repeat.  Note: I don&#39;t actually count the<br/>
recovery<br/>
pause anymore, it seems to be ingrained in the fingers now.  Also, during<br/>
a weave is the only time my left hand leaves the home row, the other<br/>
hand rests in the home position on the numpad.  I&#39;ve remapped keys so that<br/>
I can play with my hands on the wristrest, except while using the trackball.<br/>
<br/>
Now, what I do consider twitch elements are mouselook, and not being able<br/>
to map strafing to individual keys instead of Ctrl + turn keys, because I&#39;ve<br/>
never<br/>
had the hand-eye to master mouselook+keyboard to circle strafe a mob and<br/>
keep<br/>
a lookout around me during a fight, or just to get behind it while it is<br/>
focused on<br/>
a group mate.  My wish list for the interface includes<br/>
<br/>
1.  Individual strafe keys<br/>
2.  Glance Left/Right keys.  I.E.  while you&#39;re holding the Glance left<br/>
     key down, your pov pivots 30degrees to the left, but your movement<br/>
     direction doesn&#39;t change.  Make this available in 1st person POV and<br/>
     the from the back 3rd person POV.<br/>
<br/>
As far as weaving goes, I do it 100% of the time during solo fights, but<br/>
only<br/>
50-70% of the time during a group fight.  I was in a great group with two<br/>
l15 druids (when I was l15 as well) down in paw, and we fought for a good<br/>
30 minutes before we ended up in a hairy fight and I I began weaving.  We<br/>
were so effective before that, that there was no reason to weave.<br/>
