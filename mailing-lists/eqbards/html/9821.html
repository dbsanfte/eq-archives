<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097700236">You would expect this to be the case but I don&#39;t think anyone has ever<br/>
confirmed it to be true.  This topic has been discussed on many occasions on<br/>
this list.  As far as I know, no one has been able to determine if AC is the<br/>
only factor in determining how much damage you receive per hit or if armor<br/>
type plays a role (i.e. deflects part of the blow).  Guess the best way to<br/>
test it is to find a monk with the same AC as you and start collecting data.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This may have already been touched upon, but I&#39;ll say this: I was in full <br/>
&gt; steel plate by 26th level (well the visual pieces anyways). The AC <br/>
&gt; difference is not much, but that is only half the reason for the upgrade, <br/>
&gt; bro. Not only will you have a slightly higher AC than you will with<br/>
&gt; Banded, <br/>
&gt; but PLATE ARMOR inherently absorbs damage better than lower forms of<br/>
&gt; armor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Compare a monk in whatever armor he is wearing (doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; raw-hide or full shiverback &quot;armor&quot; or whatever the planes armor is <br/>
&gt; nowadays) against any plate-wearing melee class when getting hit by a <br/>
&gt; monster. WHEN HIT by the mob, a monk will almost always take more damage<br/>
&gt; per <br/>
&gt; blow than a plate-wearing person, because of the class of armor.<br/>
