<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664976278">Yeah I think that sounds about right. I was 46th on my first and only vox<br/>
raid sofar. It was a disaster btw..<br/>
I have my own theory why the raid failed.<br/>
1. There was no minimum MR/CR demand<br/>
Thats it..<br/>
I myself was one of the people who did not realise just how important those<br/>
resists is. I was not clawed once. All damage I took was from breath and my<br/>
health dropped by 1/4 each time I dident resist! 4 unresisted breaths and I<br/>
was dead.<br/>
Mind you I played resist songs with my drum and had my buffed MR/CR well<br/>
above 100, but that was not enough.<br/>
Next raid I will only go if I can take my MR/CR (or HR if nafgen) to 100<br/>
unbuffed. <br/>

Musiker, bard o 47th songs, bertox (I better stop fooling around and get<br/>
leveling again, Windleaf is ahead of me :P *grin*)<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
I hit 42nd lvl last week and am looking for a serious raiding guild on<br/>
Rodcet Nife.  I recently posted to one guild&#39;s website and got an answer<br/>
back that bards must be 45th lvl in order to be effective on a Vox raid.<br/>
Is this correct?  Please let me know<br/>
