<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422562848">Grouped up with a druid friend last night in FM (which seems to become more<br/>
video buggy by the day) trying to hit Hell 2 (which I did, btw... just<br/>
before some GM-controlled, named Sarnaks came by and laid the Almgithy<br/>
SmackethDown on us  heh!).  When we first got together, he asked me if I<br/>
wanted him to Root or Snare, I told him to try Root first.  I pulled a<br/>
gobbie whipcrack to us, and laid into him while my buddy dropped a Root and<br/>
a Swarm on it.  Here&#39;s where it gets odd:  When I keyed up Screech (to see<br/>
what would happen), it gave me the &quot;Goblin whipcrack flees in terror&quot;<br/>
message, but it just stayed right there pounding on me.  The lil blue<br/>
message flashed over and over, but he never let up.  Please tell me this<br/>
isn&#39;t a :design elemnt made to enhance the gameplay experience&quot; bs.  (When<br/>
using Screech and Snare, it worked just like Screech/Chain, just without all<br/>
the resists ;o)~  ).<br/>
