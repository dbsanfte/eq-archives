<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-139094953">I made 17th level last night and I have a question. How many, if any, extra<br/>
training points should I put into Dual Wield? I am using a combine longsword<br/>
as my primary weapon and I have a choice of either a combine scimitar or<br/>
magic whip, with lifetap I forget its name. Which should I use in the off<br/>
hand. I have been trying to get a PGT but haven&#39;t yet. I did get the Cracked<br/>
Darkwood shield.<br/>
