&gt; &gt; Regardless of whether bards are or are not hybrids, I think Verant&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; publicly expressed logic for why some classes get bind is easy to apply to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bards.  They claim that &quot;casters&quot; get bind because they die more often.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; contend that bards die as often as any single casting class.<br/>

&gt; I have to agree.  I&#39;ve seen where Verant has stated that bind was given to <br/>
&gt; casters in order to make up for their increased death rate.  I am quite <br/>
&gt; convinced that Bards die at least as often as any caster class (does anyone <br/>
&gt; want to argue this point?).  So why don&#39;t we get bind?  Not that I care at <br/>
&gt; this point, having several level 39+ clerics in my guild...<br/>

problem is that when casters die it&#39;s usually due to their own<br/>
stupidity.  When bards die, it&#39;s usually due to someone else&#39;s<br/>
stupidity.  I think I am just fine without bind, but you won&#39;t<br/>
see much opposition from me to getting bind.<br/>
