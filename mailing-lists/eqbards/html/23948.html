<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199485431">Well, Halana has crappy resists.  I&#39;m working on getting her better gear and<br/>
no I wont admit what they are.  Suffice it to say, in VP, when I&#39;m not<br/>
grouped with a bard, I don&#39;t resist AEs at all.  Like any....  i.e. AE<br/>
hits... Halana says, &quot;Healing me!&quot;... next AE, &quot;Healing Skoal..errr oops<br/>
healing ME&quot;.. etc.  Then i die!<br/>
<br/>
If I have a bard in my group.. I live.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand that.  It just seems that when I see people running from <br/>
&gt; a dragon, they are in the bardless groups.  Of course I don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; what their resists were at.  But that isn&#39;t important.  What I really <br/>
&gt; want to know is how extensively has anyone tested this?  Or is this <br/>
&gt; soft cap stuff all just hearsay from a friend of a friend that works <br/>
&gt; for Verant?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But you know, I don&#39;t think that this is a real threat anyway since <br/>
&gt; we are the ones that will push everyone over 175.<br/>

&gt; &gt; the point was not that you would be feared or ae damaged or <br/>
&gt; whatever.  the point<br/>
&gt; &gt; was that you would get the same effectivity at about 175 as at <br/>
&gt; about 245.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; the way to test this is to have someone get to about 176 in resists <br/>
&gt; and compare<br/>
&gt; &gt; effectivity with someone at 245 in resists.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Sorry Sylly, my question was mainly for the group.  I was agreeing <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;with you.  Every dragon/resist necessary encounter that I&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; to, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I have never been feared, resist gravity fluxed, taken minimal <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;damage, etc.  I was just wondering why people are talking about <br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;soft resist cap.  This is the first place that I&#39;ve heard of it.  <br/>
&gt; And <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I was joking about the bard conspiracy.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand your question (soft cap? uber-guild <br/>
&gt; conspiracy?) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been on raids, very recently, and have seen first hand <br/>
&gt; where <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resist songs makes a significant difference.  And this is not a <br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;time<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Has this soft cap on resists been confirmed?  Or are we just <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;relying <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on this uberguild leader that may have a conspiracy against <br/>
&gt; bards? <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not true in my experience.  Bard songs that buff resists do <br/>
&gt; still <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make a<br/>
