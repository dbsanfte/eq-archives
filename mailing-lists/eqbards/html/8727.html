&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the subject of Lambent quest components, I noticed that the LORE items<br/>
&gt;that I found last night in Cazic off of Alligators were not able to be<br/>
&gt;looted PERIOD if you already had such an item in your inventory.  In<br/>
&gt;particular the Alligators were dropping a &quot;Stein&quot; and a &quot;Shovel&quot;, both were<br/>
&gt;ALL/ALL and had NO stat bonuses.  Obviously quest items.  They were<br/>
 </span></blockquote>frequent<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;drops too.  After everyone in our group had a &quot;Stein&quot; and a &quot;Shovel&quot; we<br/>
&gt;simply couldn&#39;t loot the alligators anymore and instead received messages<br/>
&gt;saying something along the lines of &#39;You already have one such item in your<br/>
&gt;inventory!&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SO - If it is the case across the board that LORE items, once looted by an<br/>
&gt;individual, cannot be looted (or even destroyed!) off of a mob by that same<br/>
&gt;individual, you are going to see a LOT of free lore item calls from groups<br/>
&gt;camping things like the Lizzy Fanatics in Cazic (mudwater runes).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again, my group left a trail of Alligators with Steins and Shovels on them<br/>
&gt;because we COULDN&#39;T loot or destroy these items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone else encountered this LORE item behavior?<br/>
