<br/>
I would suggest a bloodstained tunic, lizzie scale mantle and cloack, and<br/>
blackend armor for the rest.  Looks great and if weight is an issue it will<br/>
help alot. Yes the armor is NICE to have..I persoanlly wear a combo of<br/>
charred plate and bronze right now, but i have so many strength enhancers it<br/>
isnt even funny! As a young bard the above items will be abit above your<br/>
level for now..but well within the grasp of a rich bard..so get your mage to<br/>
support you (LOL). Good luck to you Melaniel. May your songs be well<br/>
recieved!<br/>
