Subject: [eqbards] Screech and Z-Axis<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;     I haven&#39;t used it much in a long time - so I don&#39;t know if this is<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; new - or always was there but terrain related...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Anyway - I tried Screeching a Green Mountain Giant in Frontier<br/>
Mountains<br/>
&gt; and Screech basically completely didn&#39;t work.  No resist messages - just<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t take place.  I was close enough to the Mountain to get hit by it -<br/>
&gt; but he was far enough away (due to Height Obviously) to be immune to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I recall using Screech many levels ago against one of the &quot;oon&quot; named<br/>
&gt; Ogres (I forget which one) in my mid 20&#39;s - and it worked nicely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I think this is a problem we should have Verant look into.  I even<br/>
tried<br/>
&gt; to get RIGHT next to the Giant and sing it.  Equipped the Brass and it<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t work...<br/>
