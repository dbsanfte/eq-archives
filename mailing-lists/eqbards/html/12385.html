<div id="ygrps-yiv-418302084">I&#39;d suggest trading it to an enchanter for some really good jewelry.  Last I<br/>
heard they were going for around 800+pp so you would be able to get some<br/>
really good stuff in trade I would imagine.  Perhaps there are some bards<br/>
out there who can set you up with a good enchanter on Nameless.<br/>

I am a level 19(well almost) bard on Nameless.  I am wearing just<br/>
about full bronze.  I have a dragoon dirk and a PGT.  I have one<br/>
jagged band, thick leather apron and BS mantle.  one derv ring and two<br/>
onxy earrings.<br/>
<br/>
I was fighting in Runnyeye and a high level druid killed Borxx and<br/>
sold me the Lens for only 30pp!! So, now I have a Staff of the<br/>
Observers.  I would like to trade this for something good like a nice<br/>
weapon, but I am not sure how much it worth or really how much any<br/>
better weapons might be worth.  And advise?<br/>
