		Subject:	Bard newbie<br/>
<br/>
		Greetings and Hail to all!<br/>
		I am a newbie Half-Elf bard out of Qeynos.  <br/>
		Actually, I got curious about the aqueducts and created a<br/>
new character to explore them.  I was too chicken to take my precious level<br/>
5 warrior down there and was worried he&#39;d drown with all that armor :-)<br/>
Needless to say a level 1 bard is pretty useless in the aqueducts but I got<br/>
some good corpse retrieval practice and saw some sites.<br/>
		I picked a bard because one day I met one at the Qeynos<br/>
milestone in Qeynos Hills. We talked some and when she ran off I told her be<br/>
careful I saw a rabid griz over that way.  To which she replied: &quot;Oh good I<br/>
shall kill him!&quot; I was impressed that such a tiny thing could kill the rabid<br/>
griz that was totally red to me.  This was in my first week of EQ so I was<br/>
easily impressed.  I am now into my 3rd week and I know pretty much<br/>
everything &lt;g&gt; Just kidding.<br/>
		Yesterday, Sylly &lt;my bard - still level 1&gt; decided to go do<br/>
some exploring in Black Burrow Paw.  I found that the mobs in there - all<br/>
lots higher - pretty much ignore me as long as I stay reasonably far away<br/>
from them and remain non-aggressive.  I helped someone find his corpse.<br/>
(There seems to be a bug where corpses are not always found where you die<br/>
but sometimes they appear somewhere else or sometimes are hidden and you<br/>
cant see them but other players can.)  And then the razor fishies et me. :-(<br/>
But using my charisma, I begged some help and got my corpse back.  So far, I<br/>
have found that there are lots of really nice characters who like to help.<br/>
I came out of BB with 2 giant snake fangs and a cloth choker and more<br/>
importantly 2 friends who I hope to meet again.<br/>
		So by then I was getting pretty attached to my bard and<br/>
decided that she should be more than just a throw away character.  I hung<br/>
out in Qeynos and QH for a couple hours and power leveled her up half way<br/>
through 3.  I ran into someone who helped me get started by giving an<br/>
assortment of weapons to try out and a lot of gp to go buy some songs.  I<br/>
gave him one of my giant snake fangs in return and I gave the other to one<br/>
of my wizard friends.  I ended up with a rusty battle axe which was one<br/>
point more dmg than the fang.  And he really wanted the fang and after all<br/>
his help I really could not say no.<br/>
		So, I have some basic questions.  I scribed and memorized<br/>
two songs and I play them and see &quot;your pulse begins to quicken...&quot;  But I<br/>
don&#39;t know if I am doing them right.  I see some mention of not being able<br/>
to fite and make music at the same time until a much higher level.  Also<br/>
some songs are related to a type of instrument or just the skill for that<br/>
instrument?  If it is a percussion song, do I need to be holding a drum for<br/>
it to work? So I have to buy or acquire an instrument for each type of<br/>
song???<br/>
		Any help would be appreciated,<br/>
