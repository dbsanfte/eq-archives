I almost made this same point, but then realized that the seller&#39;s almost<br/>
hidden implication was that the Ykeshas that had dropped prior to the patch<br/>
would remain equippable by classes other than WAR (highly likely) and that<br/>
*those* ykesha&#39;s prices would shoot through the roof.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still wrong though.  :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d tell this guy he needs to retake his ECON 101 class so he fully<br/>
&gt; understood the laws of supply/demand.  If Verant were to change the Ykesha<br/>
&gt; to where only warriors could equip it (and they publicly said<br/>
&gt; they weren&#39;t),<br/>
&gt; then the demand would drop drastically.  Only a stupid warrior<br/>
&gt; would pay 10K<br/>
&gt; for them at that point.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth<br/>
&gt; of loot but<br/>
&gt; &gt; that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and<br/>
&gt; the price<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
