<div id="ygrps-yiv-797391890">Hello fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I manage to accumulate some pp and now is the time to buy<br/>
stuff. ;-) I have my Level 20 song and I now want to optimize my<br/>
stats and stuff a little bit. I was to do exactly what is in this<br/>
message<br/>
then I decided that sharing this and asking for advice (or approval)<br/>
would not hurt since we are talking several 100pp for the jewelry<br/>
and equipment. If you need to know<br/>
<br/>
I use 2 Barbed Leather Whips (delay 28 damage 7) and sometimes<br/>
the Dragoon Dirk. I can&#39;t afford Platinum jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is based on the best of my knowledge. Hope this could<br/>
help others too although creating and choosing our own stuff is cool<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
================================<br/>
Ok first AC versus STATS<br/>
================================<br/>
Should we base our armor on AC or stats? I decided to go<br/>
with the Bronze but I loose a little bit of stats while weighting more.<br/>
<br/>
The armor I own and can wear:<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
Small Bronze: Helm AC 10, Bracers AC 7, Chest AC 17, Arms AC8,<br/>
Legs  AC 10, Boots AC 8 and Cloak AC 8<br/>
Above = Good AC (about 75) and Looks but heavy (about 45).<br/>
<br/>
-OR-<br/>
<br/>
Small Banded: Helm AC 8, Bracers AC 6, Boots AC 6 Cloak AC 7<br/>
Dwarven Ringmail Tunic = AC 12 and 7 against Heat/Cold/Magic<br/>
Barbed Legplates = AC 8 and 2 AGI<br/>
Barbed Armplates = AC 7 and 2 DEX<br/>
Above = Less AC (about 54) but more stats and weight less (about 28)<br/>
<br/>
Other example: Thick Leather Apron AC 8 weight 1<br/>
               or Troll Hide Belt AC 5 but 5 STR 5 STA<br/>
<br/>
=================<br/>
STATS<br/>
=================<br/>
Magic stuff on me:<br/>
---------------------<br/>
Elf Hide Gloves = 5 DEX 5 AGI<br/>
Bloodstained Mantle = 3 STR 10 Magic<br/>
Dragoon Dirk = 2 DEX 3 Magic (I leave it in the range slot)<br/>
<br/>
Soon I will buy this:<br/>
--------------------------------------------<br/>
Troll Hide Belt = 5 STR 5 STA (need to buy one, around 200pp ??)<br/>
Black Iron Crown  = 5 STR and plus 5 to P/D/M/C/H (300pp ??)<br/>
Bracer of Erollisi = 5 AC 5 STR (40pp ??)<br/>
<br/>
Silver Star Ruby Veil = 5 DEX 5 CHA<br/>
Gold Opal Necklace = 9 STA 6 AGI<br/>
Electrum Sapphire Earrings = 4 STR 2 INT (*2)<br/>
Gold Star Ruby rings = 7 DEX 5 CHA (*2)<br/>
<br/>
(The Electrum Star Ruby rings = 5 DEX 7 CHA could be good too<br/>
instead or the chosen rings to have 4 more CHA and minus 4 DEX)<br/>
<br/>
My Base Stats plus the added stats based on Bronze armor set:<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
STR 85 + 26 = 111 (more loots so less overweight + help with weapons a<br/>
bit)<br/>
STA 70 + 14  = 84 (good to improve HP, I think this will give me 14 HP<br/>
more)<br/>
AGI 95 + 11 = 106 (Better at dodge and take less damage / improve AC)<br/>
DEX 90 + 26 = 116 (hit more, play better, 112 with Electrum Star Ruby<br/>
Ring)<br/>
WIS 80 +  0 = 80 (I don&#39;t feel I need this and 80 is not too bad)<br/>
INT 80 + 4 = 84 (Help learn skill faster, so what if it takes longer)<br/>
CHA 85 + 15 = 100<br/>
(Since I&#39;m not sure CHA is that important I decided to had some just in<br/>
case.<br/>
Using the Electrum Star Ruby Ring would give me 4 CHA more for 104).<br/>
<br/>
Poison / Disease 15 + 5 each<br/>
Cold / Heat 25 + 5 each<br/>
Magic 25 + 10 + 3  = 38<br/>
<br/>
Any comments is welcome and I would like to see what other people<br/>
did at different level. Send it to me in private if you don&#39;t want to go<br/>
<br/>
public ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
