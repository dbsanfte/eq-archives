&gt;   There&#39;s only one thing a HQ bear pelt is good for, and you&#39;ve got to<br/>
&gt;   understand that higher level players have at least a little money to<br/>
&gt;   throw around.  Don&#39;t feel bad if you are asking more than what you <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with Harmonic.  The person who bought them from you<br/>
for 7pp was laughing all the way to the bank.  7pp is spare<br/>
change for anyone L35+.  Heck, I give 5pp for binds because<br/>
plat is so easy to come by.<br/>
<br/>
I changed my bind point from North Freeport to West Freeport.  <br/>
Now when I die, I run over to EC and kill bears while waiting<br/>
for a res.  Picked up a HQ bear pelt last night.  :)<br/>
