<div id="ygrps-yiv-466664249">Nope, not a cue for a bad song, but a combat question.<br/>
<br/>
Lately (well for the last month or two) I&#39;ve been noticing just how<br/>
much I&#39;m lagging behind a good Ranger friend of mine in the fighting<br/>
areas.  Basically, while he&#39;s there hacking his way through creature<br/>
after creature, I&#39;m helping while nibbling at its back, tickling it,<br/>
making it giggle and distracting it so he can hit it better.<br/>
<br/>
I love being in the thick of it all, tearing through the bad things.<br/>
I had a great time with a fellow bard once in Rathe Mountains, working<br/>
our way through a big skeleton camp trying to help his cleric friend<br/>
get her quest bit of whatever.  Clearing out the small undead we were<br/>
unstoppable, although just as I was getting into my stride he had to<br/>
sit down and recover his breath.  Typical man!!  (/em ducks)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, being honest with myself, I&#39;ve got no real desire to be standing<br/>
in my friend&#39;s shoes having new holes ripped in my shiny armour, but<br/>
I&#39;d like to be able to add a bit more offensive capability.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m asking for a couple of hints and tips on weapon choice ... I<br/>
think.  That&#39;s probably where I&#39;m lacking.  At the mo, I&#39;ve got 3<br/>
basic weapons I use:<br/>
<br/>
= Bladed Thulian claws (something new I&#39;m enjoying playing with after<br/>
trading for the PGT I stopped using when it became too heavy!)<br/>
<br/>
= Silvery War Axe (off-hand since the rotten claws are main only!)<br/>
<br/>
= Dragoon Dirk (to work up my piercing skill when I level, and to sit<br/>
in my ranged slot when I&#39;ve done that)<br/>
<br/>
Now they&#39;re all fast weapons and very light so I can fight all day<br/>
with barely a pause.  But also low damage, a 12 here, a 16 there, and<br/>
that&#39;s it.  So maybe I should be looking to improve on them, to give<br/>
me a feeling I&#39;m doing more than nibbling.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m hoping to hear from everyone else what weapons you are using,<br/>
and how you feel they compare to what I&#39;ve got and to what other<br/>
supposed (phooey!) hybrids are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully there&#39;ll be something within my price range (which is<br/>
actually very low at the mo after buying the stones to get the new<br/>
armour!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a special hi and thanks to Maravana for her kind and generous<br/>
gift helping me complete my set of Lambent.  Thanks sis, just have to<br/>
call and me or one of my other personalities would be glad to help any<br/>
way I can!<br/>
<br/>
PS I was joking about the song being bad, it&#39;s depressingly catchy ;-(<br/>
