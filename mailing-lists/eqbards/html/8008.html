<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330527783">One of the MAJOR mistakes that the current companies are making - and they<br/>
all did it - UO, EQ and AC - are that they are stuck in the old paradigms<br/>
of singleplayer games AND they are only looking that the CURRENT<br/>
demographics of &#39;the online gamer&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Females represent a very small part of THAT demographic - simply because<br/>
there hasn&#39;t been THAT many games that appeal to US.<br/>
<br/>
Being 40, and female - and an online gamer for years - I know just how rare<br/>
we are. We just simply aren&#39;t what these companies perceive to be the<br/>
&#39;target&#39; audience.<br/>
<br/>
Call it the Laura Croft syndrome if you will.<br/>
<br/>
The answer would be to give us some choice in what we look like, then only<br/>
the ones that would WANT to appear like that would. The 16yr old male that<br/>
plays a female - and thinks that look is his idea of heaven still could -<br/>
meanwhile - REAL women might - but then again, I think I&#39;d pick something a<br/>
little less showgirlish.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Sure, EQ graphics are very sexist.  I&#39;m a female, and knowing what I know <br/>
&gt;about internet and RPG likely customers, I very well might have decided that<br/>
&gt;the current graphics were the right job decision.  Yep, as a female.  Its<br/>
&gt;still sexist, and I still hate the lack of graphics which would appeal to <br/>
&gt;female player.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Women, they look much more like Rangers than their female counterparts.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Heh. So many people say this but in fact the art director was a woman.<br/>
