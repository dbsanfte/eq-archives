<div id="ygrps-yiv-200858594">I believe the implication was that, like with other &quot;nerfed&quot; items lately, Verant would replace the drop<br/>
with a different, but similar sword that would be warrior only, and the older Ykesha&#39;s would be worth a<br/>
mint.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, THAT was a runon sentence.  :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d tell this guy he needs to retake his ECON 101 class so he fully<br/>
&gt; understood the laws of supply/demand.  If Verant were to change the Ykesha<br/>
&gt; to where only warriors could equip it (and they publicly said they weren&#39;t),<br/>
&gt; then the demand would drop drastically.  Only a stupid warrior would pay 10K<br/>
&gt; for them at that point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth of loot but<br/>
&gt; &gt; that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and the price<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
