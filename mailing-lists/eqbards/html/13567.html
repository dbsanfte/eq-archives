&gt; Naeeldar, there are quite a number of places that high levels tend to forget<br/>
&gt; about.  At later levels having grown up in Sol B and Lower Guk from 35-45<br/>
&gt; you get into sort of a mindset of pull-kill, pull-kill, pull-kill.  Higher<br/>
&gt; level players sometimes don&#39;t use their imaginations about things to do!<br/>
&gt; Here are some suggestions of interesting things for high levels to do for<br/>
&gt; experience:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess it depends on what server you are on, but I&#39;ll comment a bit on<br/>
the status of these on my server, The Tribunal, the 4th newest server<br/>
after yesterday&#39;s new one was added.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kedge Keep.  I&#39;m not sure if 50s get great exp there, but 40-48s sure do.<br/>
&gt; Definitely a fun place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, for 1 group. The specials have a spawn time of 6 hours, and one<br/>
good group can swoop through all of them on a couple of hour trip. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ocean Of Tears.  The Seafury Cyclops in OOT that give exp to 50s and spawn<br/>
&gt; as fast as Moss Snakes.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quite commonly camped on my server. A pain to get to, but fun for a<br/>
while. Was a lot more fun before they &quot;nerfed&quot; loot a while back (like<br/>
in August I think) Why does a mob that&#39;s as hard to drop as a Sand Giant<br/>
drop such pitiful loot.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the Allizewsaur, a level 50 &quot;dinosaur&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; roaming an island there.  He spawns pretty quickly and is pretty tough to<br/>
&gt; take down - so hard in fact a level 50 necro with a pet actually uses more<br/>
&gt; than half mana to do it.  Now THAT&#39;S tough.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One group (actually less than one group) can do this guy, and he&#39;s<br/>
pretty well camped nightly on my server because he&#39;s one of the few<br/>
non-plane mobs that will drop high level words pages and runes.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Guards in Neriak, Oggok and Grobb.  Heck for that matter if you don&#39;t care<br/>
&gt; about faction there are guards everywhere.  You want a thrill?  Go set up<br/>
&gt; camp down deep inside the town of Oggok and pull Bouncers.  It&#39;s fun and<br/>
&gt; challenging.  Heck Harmonic hit 50 killing Bouncers.  Invis your way into<br/>
&gt; Neriak&#39;s Third Gate and pull gaurds.  Makes you feel like a kid again!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>On our server most of these are well camped by the 40+ crowd already.<br/>
One pair of players will be outside so anyone else showing up has to go<br/>
inside.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Castle Mistmoore.  There are mobs in there that give experience to 50s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very rarely done because of the hellish pathing problems. Plus all the<br/>
specials are often camped and not good for exp. Actually I haven&#39;t<br/>
noticed any L35+ mobs in there, where are they?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Brownie Guards in Lesser Fay.  They were red to me last time I saw &#39;em at<br/>
&gt; 41.  I&#39;d be pretty surprised if 50s didn&#39;t get exp there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>More like lose exp there. Those guards are insane casters.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Paw has been tweaked again to be just slightly easier.  Do 45-50s get exp<br/>
&gt; there?  Little to none probably, but good 40-45 I&#39;m sure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Crappy dungeon. Bad design, no L35+ mobs until deep inside and way to<br/>
much of a PITA to get to. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyhow, don&#39;t forget some of the other places.  I too get into a mindset of<br/>
&gt; &quot;damn, solb packed.  I&#39;ll run to lguk and check it out.&quot;  But there are<br/>
&gt; other things to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Compared to the wealth of well designed places to hunt at 35- the above<br/>
list is really pretty poor. On my server, where we are just starting to<br/>
get enough high level players to take on Fear (we killed Cazic last<br/>
night for the first time), PoA is unlikely to see much use at all for<br/>
quite some time.<br/>
