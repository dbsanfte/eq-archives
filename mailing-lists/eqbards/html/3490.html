&gt;Hate to bring this up again, but we Bards seem more like the semi-caster<br/>
&gt;shamans and clerics than the Paladins and Shadowknights.  I don&#39;t see why<br/>

&gt;Kitasi the well travelled and poorer for it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a shaman, and we (bards) become significantly better<br/>
fighters at higher levels.  My Barbarian shaman (3rd) with<br/>
100 sta (base) has 69hp (?  I always have inner fire<br/>
cast that brings it to 75, so this might be a bit high)<br/>
my HE (sta 70, base) bard had 66 at the same level.  Shamans<br/>
are limited to banded, where we get plate.  Also<br/>
shamans max at Level * 4 + 4, and at higher levels<br/>
that adds up.  In addition they gain skills slower<br/>
(base int is 60 vs 70 for my bard)<br/>
<br/>
At 13th level, I was soloing orc camps in S. Ro.  I<br/>
had cleaned a camp, including the final Oracle, and<br/>
was resting when a new Oracle spawned.  He conned<br/>
the same to me as the one I&#39;d killed.  At that momemt<br/>
a 13th level troll shaman took him on, and got hammered<br/>
to &lt;2 bubbles before finishing him, I&#39;d barely lost<br/>
1 bubble to the same type of foe.<br/>
<br/>
I truly think we are far closer in combat capabilities<br/>
to the SK&#39;s and Paladins than we are to Druids,<br/>
Clerics and Shaman.</div>
