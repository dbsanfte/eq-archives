If nothing else, I&#39;d /petition and /bug EVERY time before starting the hunt<br/>

In reference to the fear kite tacticts in OT near the skyfire zone -- move<br/>
to the corner between skyfire and frontier mountains.  If you fear mobs<br/>
there, they run up into the corner and run back and forth mostly up in the<br/>
corner. <br/>
<br/>
I had a gm watch me for about 15 minutes up there one evening.  I asked him<br/>
if he considered it an exploit, and he said &quot;Nope, Great tactics!&quot;  Bear in<br/>
mind that the mob was never just running into a wall, it was always in<br/>
motion, and as long as fear wasnt resisted it stayed on this little path<br/>
where it ran back and forth.<br/>
