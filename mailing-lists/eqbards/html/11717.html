<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997916919">Greetings!<br/>
Yesterday I was allowed to tag along with the Esprit de Corps guild on Cazic <br/>
Thule server.  We did an assault on Mistmoore castle.  4 groups of 30&#39;s to <br/>
low 40&#39;s (i am lvl 35) went in the secret way from the crypt up to the <br/>
bedroom.  We cleared all the hallways and the bathrooom, then set up base in <br/>
the bedroom.  Got the black silk gloves off the 10th Deathly Usher I looted. <br/>
  Not as common as I was expecting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I had the gypsy musicians on track, but the groups were reluctant to <br/>
pull them.  They said there were 5 hard mobs between us and the musicians.  <br/>
I believe it.  At one point our 4 groups were completely destroyed.  The <br/>
spawns there are very deadly.  We often were fighting 6-8 mobs.  Perhaps <br/>
part of the problem was the groups learning to work together.  Anyway, for <br/>
those who have yet to get the gypsy lute, be advised that this is no small <br/>
task.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I was able to get the Deep Water Goblin&#39;s Opaline helm on <br/>
the 3rd try.  I knew nothing of these DW Goblins, so be warned that <br/>
attacking one will likely get you 5-6 plus their pets.<br/>
