&gt; I still can&#39;t figure why the other classes that everyone (including<br/>
&gt; Verant) says are hybrids get 5 or 6 melee skills over and above Dodge,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we get only the one.  You&#39;d think we&#39;d get some magical skills to<br/>
&gt; compensate, but we don&#39;t even get the benefit of a swifter memorization<br/>
 </span></blockquote>from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; meditate.  Heck it takes me longer to memorize my highest level spell<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it does our cleric to memorize all eight of his spells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that Bards get screwed by the slow memorization of songs.  But come<br/>
on Kitasi, you know good and well that Bards have better magical abilities<br/>
that compensate for the lesser combat abilities of the other hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to go down this road again, but Bards have a clear Spell<br/>
(Song) advantage over every other hybrid.<br/>
