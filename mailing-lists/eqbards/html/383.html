<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615781260">For the most part every song has it&#39;s purpose for someone (except the ones<br/>
that are broken for now). A bard who likes to aid lots of people in dire<br/>
needs might find Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric a very useful song. Me? I think I&#39;ve<br/>
sung it twice. Lament has great uses especially when soloing camps. Those<br/>
that group all the time and hit solitary creatures or just go busting in<br/>
might not use it. The rythm songs add that extra sense of security when<br/>
going after mobs with special attacks or magic, specially when you stack<br/>
them. A land bound bard may find no use for Aquatic Ayre but a seafaring<br/>
bard might find it indispensable. Would you feel better going into Lavastorm<br/>
with Psalm of Cooling or not?<br/>
<br/>
	I&#39;ve always considered the bard class on EQ to be almost the ultimate<br/>
multipurpose character, &#39;jack of all trades&#39; so to speak. That means that if<br/>
we play our bard one specific way, like a pure fighter for example, we might<br/>
not feel whole.<br/>
<br/>
	Other classes have the same thing. A warrior only has new skills to improve<br/>
on. I seem to recall some of those being rather far apart. Mages get spells<br/>
every four or five levels and some ranks have their &#39;bum&#39; spells. Depending<br/>
on how they play, a mage might stick with a certain spell for quite a few<br/>
levels because the other spells currently don&#39;t meet their needs.<br/>
<br/>
	Personally I would say that levels 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 23 are the big<br/>
ones for bards. Don&#39;t know about higher than that.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

I have noticed something that rather bothers me.  I am currently a level<br/>
11 bard hanging out around the Freeport area.  This is my 3rd character<br/>
since the commercial release, and also the highest level I have reached.<br/>
Previously I have played a Wizard and a Shadow Knight.  I abandoned both<br/>
at 5th level because they are too &quot;high level&quot;.  By this I mean that they<br/>
achieve their greatest &quot;power&quot; at higher levels.  A wizard with no pet is<br/>
not even a match for a magician of similar level until somewhere in the<br/>
teens, root notwithstanding.  The SK was a nice choice, but not even close<br/>
to a warrior&#39;s skill, and with only minor spells until the mid-teens as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Bards, however, struck me as powerful from the beginning.  It seemed like<br/>
my ability to mow through things whether alone or in a party would<br/>
dramatically increase with each new song.  Up until 6th level, each new<br/>
song was fantastic, with the exception of the Jig of Vigor.<br/>
<br/>
However, now it seems the good songs and skills are few and far between.<br/>
The Whistling Warsong was an OK buff, but since it was only personal I<br/>
used it rarely.  At 8th, it was hardly worth the boat ride to get the<br/>
Lullaby, and Elemental Rhythms at level 9 was rather pointless.  Then the<br/>
magic 10 hit, and I learned Dodge and the awesome Anthem de Arms.  AT 11,<br/>
though, I get the USELESS brass skill and the buggy or just plain weak<br/>
Charisma booster.  Not exactly songs to light my fire.  12th, or course,<br/>
yields the Bellow, a much sought after song.  Then I have to look forward<br/>
to another &quot;don&#39;t memorize me, ever&quot; song or two, another Rhythm and the<br/>
Magic Identifier (absolutely useless).  Honstly, the only 2 things I<br/>
really look forward to at all in the near future are the Sleep Song at 15,<br/>
Dual Wield at 17th, and the group invisibility song at 19th, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed these &quot;bum&quot; levels, like 9th, 11th, and I am sure<br/>
others to come?  Are hih level bards even worth it?  I hate seeing posts<br/>
like &quot;I am 19th level and I still use Anthem de Arms and Hymn of<br/>
Restoration almost exclusively&quot;.  It will be a long and boring wait until<br/>
the better abilities come, I am afraid.<br/>
<br/>
What say you high level bards?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?<br/>
