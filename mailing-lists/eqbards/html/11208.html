<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755864587">i don&#39;t like people making decisions for me.  hell yes i would want in on<br/>
that belt.  this whole deal came up on our last vox run, which dropped 2<br/>
mistwalker swords.  the issue, should druids be in on the lotto (RNG/DRU<br/>
only).  beforehand, the organizer said if you can use it, or want to give<br/>
someone who can use it your lotto chance, then you can be in.  when it came<br/>
to the loot, the organizer said it should be rangers only.  some agreed,<br/>
some disagreed.  the organizer finally agreed to stick with what was<br/>
discussed beforehand, even though he disagreed on druids being in the lotto.<br/>
he also said if a crystalline spear dropped, he would be upset if anyone<br/>
besides a rogue would go in on the lotto.  now i really respect the guy, and<br/>
like him, and he makes very valid points, but there are two sides to the<br/>
argument, and i feel i don&#39;t want people telling me what i should and should<br/>
not be able to use when the item says BRD on it.  there was also that<br/>
resurrection staff, which a paladin won.  not a shaman, cleric, or druid.<br/>
all the druids did not bother with the staff, but chose the mistwalker<br/>
lotto.  this was upsetting to many, but fair in my eyes.  one druid and one<br/>
ranger won a mistwalker by the way.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a vein in my<br/>
&gt; forehead.<br/>
&gt; It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed Bolster Belt.<br/>
&gt; This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste effect. The<br/>
&gt; question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given <br/>
&gt; their melee<br/>
&gt; abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant <br/>
&gt; designed us.. if I<br/>
&gt; had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>
&gt; (Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. <br/>
&gt; Surely the item<br/>
&gt; would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or <br/>
&gt; ranger. But is<br/>
&gt; a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>
