<div id="ygrps-yiv-873787296">I know how I would handle it in my guild: this person would no longer be a<br/>
member.<br/>
<br/>
We have a 3 strike policy, meaning that you get two warnings and when the third<br/>
problem is confirmed, you&#39;re out.  This applies unless the transgression is<br/>
serious enough to warrant immediate action.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, if you all have a loot and/or behavior policy (which we do) and<br/>
his actions violate that policy (this behavior clearly violates our policy)<br/>
then no warnings are necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if that sounds harsh, but lying and greed are not the kinds of behavior I<br/>
want even peripherally associated with my name.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve twice had a guildmate win a roll for an item claiming to want to use<br/>
&gt; it, only to sell it within minutes of leaving the hunting area.  Both times<br/>
&gt; other guildmembers wanted the item for secondary characters.  I&#39;ve taken to<br/>
&gt; grouping with this person only when absolutely necessary, any suggestions on<br/>
&gt; another way to handle this?  It has caused me some discomfort.  Fortunately<br/>
&gt; the other bards in my guild are both excellent players and would never<br/>
&gt; participate in such shenanigans.<br/>
