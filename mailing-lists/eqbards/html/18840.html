<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139318400">OK, I&#39;m curious--what is your equipment list?  I&#39;m an<br/>
ac hound and I do have AC belt, rings and ears and I<br/>
won&#39;t be able to get to 800 ac (after my defense is<br/>
maxed).  <br/>

&gt; I understand that everyone likes to have high AC. <br/>
&gt; And we can still get ours<br/>
&gt; pretty damn high.  And I&#39;m not sure why you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get your AC above 850.  As<br/>
&gt; it stands now, at level 40, mine is 803.  And I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have any Imbrued nor<br/>
&gt; do I have an AC belt, AC Necklace, AC Rings, AC<br/>
&gt; Ears.  My cloak is a level<br/>
&gt; 25 item (lizard scale) and my hat is AC 5.   I could<br/>
&gt; easily, if I were<br/>
&gt; willing to give up some charisma and dex, crank my<br/>
&gt; AC to around 900... at<br/>
&gt; level 40... without a single piece of imbrued and<br/>
&gt; only the singing steel<br/>
&gt; boots.  At level 40 it&#39;s hard, even for a warrior,<br/>
&gt; to break the 800AC<br/>
&gt; barrier.  For a bard it&#39;s just as hard, but not<br/>
&gt; impossible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I guess my question is:<br/>
&gt; Is it that you are envious of the warrior/paladin/sk<br/>
&gt; AC or is it that you<br/>
&gt; just want it to be easier to get over 900 AC?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want high AC you have to do what warriors do,<br/>
&gt; give up having high<br/>
&gt; stats so that you get AC and strength.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want high stats you&#39;re going to sacrifice AC.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my 2 cents.<br/>
