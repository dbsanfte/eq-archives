<b>Subject:</b> Another bard guide idea <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-623464096">A lot of us have posted on this list problems we have run into when grouping<br/>
with players who have no idea of the benefits of having a well played bard<br/>
in the group.  Sometimes we are able, through tact and execution, to educate<br/>
them in game.  When this happens, its always nice to get that complement<br/>
when you have to camp for the night.  However, there are always going to be<br/>
those occasions when we find ourselves joining a group with someone who<br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to play with a bard.  I have an idea and think we should go<br/>
on the offensive.<br/>
<br/>
I propose that we on this list work together on creating a guide that<br/>
educates all non-bards on the Do&#39;s and Dont&#39;s when grouping with a bard.<br/>
The guide would include a basic explanation of bard tactics and the<br/>
situations when they are used.  The guide would not need to have a complete<br/>
analysis of our songs, just the key ones.  <br/>
<br/>
Once the guide is completed, we send it out to all the major EQ websites<br/>
labeling it as the Official Playing Guide for Non-bards published by the<br/>
EQBards Onelist community, the definitive authorities on all things bardic<br/>
(or something else along those lines:-).    <br/>
<br/>
Most of the info that would need to be in this guide has already been<br/>
written (or still in John Kim&#39;s head).  Pulling it out of the archives<br/>
though will be a pain. How we go about actually creating the guide can be<br/>
worked out later if enough people, especially the key posters on this list,<br/>
agree that its a good idea. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think.<br/>
