Pass, the spellcasting orcs that other people would fighting<br/>
would turn around in the middle of their fights to cast spells<br/>
on me!  As you probably know, spellcasting mobs are wimps in<br/>
melee and their main threat is their spells.  So basically I<br/>
ended up taking all the bad spell effects and damage for a mob<br/>
that someone else was fighting and got the credit for.  Over<br/>
and over.  Eventually I just ended up turning off my songs<br/>
whenever someone else was fighting an orc medic or apprentice.<br/>

In Befallen, another group was pulling mobs into a room they<br/>
were camping, past my group.  The monsters would invariably<br/>
stop chasing their fetcher and attack me.  I apologized and<br/>
explained it to them several times, but I still got the<br/>
impression they thought we were stealing their pulls.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure this is due to the mob targeting you at some<br/>
point.  Instead of making it so you get faction if you<br/>
contribute to a mob&#39;s demise, they made it so you get faction<br/>
if you&#39;re on the mob&#39;s hate list.  The mob adds you to its<br/>
hate list if it attacks you, which because of the above<br/>
problem is almost always for bards.<br/>
