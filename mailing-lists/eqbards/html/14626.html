<div id="ygrps-yiv-372095036"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my intial post (maybe the second one, it was this AM) I spent a whole<br/>
&gt; paragraph saying how this wasn&#39;t a bash on lvl 50 players, and how I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; be one if I hadn&#39;t stopped playing for like 5 months...  Thats not where<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m getting at all.  My annoyance comes from every time Verant feels<br/>
&gt; compelled to keep the dragons challenging for the current crop of lvl<br/>
&gt; 50&#39;s.  They are not considering the people who aren&#39;t there yet...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I know, Matt.  I had to throw it in though, because as of recently<br/>
  a lot of high level players are giving the majority of good players<br/>
  in that level range a bad rap.  That wasn&#39;t geared to you, just as<br/>
  a general comment to the L1-L40 populace.  I&#39;m one of the friendliest<br/>
  L50s on our server when it comes to helping people out.  And people<br/>
  are surprised, which concerns me.  I would like to dispel this elite<br/>
  visage that people give L50 players.  It simply does not hold true<br/>
  for me.  And it applies to our conversation in that when you make<br/>
  L50 the dragons (all 10 of them, doh /tease, sorry) will still be an<br/>
  option to you, I guarentee it.  I&#39;m me first, badass L50 second ;)<br/>
