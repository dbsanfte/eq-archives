<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No, all you have to claim is that you&#39;re trying to attack the<br/>
&gt;monsters there, and the bigger guys keep taking it every time.<br/>
&gt;In this case, their misguided harassment definition (only<br/>
&gt;harassment if it&#39;s aimed at an individual) works in your<br/>
&gt;favor since they are literally killing everything you attack.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It *shouldn&#39;t* work if it&#39;s at a spawn site and they are camping...because<br/>
camping is completely legal...as is farming.  When whatever camped monster<br/>
spawns, it&#39;s totally up for grabs.  Just because the higher levels get it<br/>
every time doesn&#39;t make it a case of harassment.  It would only be<br/>
harassment if you moved to another location and they followed you, doing the<br/>
same thing :)<br/>
