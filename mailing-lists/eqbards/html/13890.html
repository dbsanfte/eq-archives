doing more damage than me at L44 before I got my Ykesha.  &quot;But<br/>

I don&#39;t entirely blame this one on necros though.  In making<br/>
melee classes so weak, Verant forced themselves into a<br/>
position where to make a (melee) pet for a casting class<br/>
worthwhile, it had to be unbalancingly powerful.<br/>

(two groups, one in each group, all other tanks and clerics in<br/>
the low to mid 40s).  Basically, the necros determined which<br/>
group got the kill - if one went LD or afk or was late joining<br/>
the fight, the other group got the kill.  We had various tanks<br/>
going afk, LD, etc and it didn&#39;t make much difference.  Heck,<br/>
for a while we had 4 people in one group (cleric and 3 tanks),<br/>
and me, a cleric, and L36 necro in the other group.  We were<br/>
getting most of the kills.  If that&#39;s &quot;pretty weak&quot; then<br/>
something is really wrong.<br/>
