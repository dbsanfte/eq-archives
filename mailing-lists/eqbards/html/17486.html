<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804874324">I used the Chants in Hate the other night as well, and had pretty much the<br/>
same results that you did.  On golems and clerics, I switched to buffing<br/>
mode, and on everything else I twisted the Chants.  I noticed that on mobs<br/>
that I was able to stick the Chants on consistently, we always got the<br/>
experience (2 tanks, cleric, druid, bard, and non-nuking enchanter) -- I<br/>
stopped taking counts after we got the first 4 of 5.  Also, that&#39;s the first<br/>
time I&#39;ve ever been summoned by /anything/ in my entire bardic life, and it<br/>
felt GOOD!  (I was getting jealous of seeing everyone else&#39;s name spam by.<br/>
I got summoned 3 times total, actually.)<br/>
<br/>
As long as there is a warrior or ranger in the group, I tend to have little<br/>
problem drawing attention twisting these three songs.  If not, I do draw<br/>
some heat.<br/>
<br/>
Just one note, though: since these are DoT&#39;s, the only benefit of having two<br/>
bards play them is to overcome resist rates (which is definitely a benefit<br/>
that shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly).  Since the songs don&#39;t stack (okay, I&#39;m<br/>
assuming here, since it&#39;s a DoT effect), two bards who are each able to<br/>
consistently stick the songs won&#39;t buy you a lot.  Of course, in the Planes,<br/>
it does seem warranted.<br/>
<br/>
I tested just before going to the Hate and verified that the Resist debuff<br/>
components do stick with the shammie line (combined dropped me 89 points<br/>
with an MM drum).<br/>
