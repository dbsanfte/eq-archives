<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lute of the Gypsy Princess un-nerfed? DOUBLE the ef fect?! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108442298">Welp, I&#39;d like to kill the thread I started regarding the supposed insane <br/>
healing effect of the Lute of the Gypsy Princess. Turns out the guy who <br/>
blurted it out over guildsay was full of shiite as I had suspected. =P<br/>
<br/>
The Lute still (sadly) has no special effect for String songs. I personally <br/>
think they should make it at least 15% more powerful than a store-bought. <br/>
Would be worth the pain in ass it is to acquire, aside from the new quest <br/>
being implemented tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Can I kill the offshoot of my thread? Jig DOES NOT regen mana!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone - have fun tomorrow with the Lambent scavenger hunting. =)<br/>
