<div id="ygrps-yiv-422878861"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I would like to get my hands on one of them there Crested Helms, been<br/>
&gt;wanting one for a long time...can you give me any insight into your group&#39;s<br/>
&gt;level range and what mob in particular drops it?  I is the rare drop, <br/>
&gt;right?<br/>
&gt;I just camped 20 hours this past weekend to get a pair of Dwarven Workboots<br/>
&gt;I had been wanting for a long time and here is what I learned about them,<br/>
&gt;tell me if the crested helm compares:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dwarven Ghost spawns every 20 minutes, sometimes a Festering Hag spawns in<br/>
&gt;his placeholder.  You see the ghost maybe once or twice an hour.  The ghost<br/>
&gt;drops the boots about 1 out of every 9 or 10 spawns.  This means you might<br/>
&gt;see the boots once every 5 hours if you are lucky, sometimes once every 10.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things here.<br/>
<br/>
1) I was camping the secret room in Mistmore for the dark silk gloves for <br/>
Lambent quest.  I had a level 41 cleric and a level 32 warrior with me. I <br/>
believe I was level 36 or maybe 37 at the time.  We&#39;d been there about 2 <br/>
hours when the Avenging Caitliff spawned. We killed him, he dropped the <br/>
Helm.  I won the lotto!! WOO HOO!! The placeholder for that spot spawns <br/>
every 20 minutes or thereabouts, I didn&#39;t really time it.  We stayed another <br/>
hour and never saw the Caitliff again.  I didn&#39;t get my gloves either. :(  <br/>
Went back a couple weeks later, this time it was me at 38, druid 39 and <br/>
cleric 35.  We stayed about 2 hours and never saw the Caitliff, but I did <br/>
get my gloves, finally.<br/>
<br/>
2) The basement in Unrest is GREAT experience for level 35-38.  My base <br/>
group of cleric, druid and me have looted 15 or 20 pairs of boots now (spent <br/>
2 or 3 weeks there for exp), but I had never won the lotto for the boots, <br/>
the winner almost always was one of the people we invited for help.  Last <br/>
night when things didn&#39;t go so well in Sol B, we headed back to Unrest to <br/>
item camp for me a pair of boots. We killed the placeholder, waited 20 <br/>
minutes, the ghost spawned and I got my boots. :)   I never camped the ghost <br/>
more than 4 hours at a time (except once, and in that excruciating period, <br/>
the hag spawned for 2 hours straight instead of the ghost, then one ghost <br/>
spawned then it was back to the hag for another hour and twenty minutes) and <br/>
my group looted at least one pair and usually 2 from him every night I was <br/>
there. This, I think, is just the random number generator at its finest.  As <br/>
it turns out, at level 39 the ghost room is still decent exp, I got 3/4 of a <br/>
bubble in about 2 hours played with two other group members. The other bonus <br/>
is that with 2 39&#39;s and a 36 cleric, you don&#39;t need any helpers for the <br/>
ghost room so no more lotto required. :)<br/>
