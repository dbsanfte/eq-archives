&gt;   I loved using all my songs when I was little, they were extremely<br/>
&gt;   definitive of a bard.  The only songs I play now are Clarity and <br/>
&gt;   Victory.  Sure Psalm songs can give dmg shields, a whopping 9 dmg.<br/>
&gt;   It just doesn&#39;t stack up like it did in the L30s.  What happened<br/>
&gt;   to Lament, what happened to Lullaby, hell what happened to Hymm.<br/>
&gt;   I outgrew all these songs.  And I never use them anymore.  If <br/>
&gt;   I try to Lament something and fail these days, it&#39;s like instant<br/>
&gt;   death.  If I fire up Lullaby in the PoF, I cannot even count to<br/>
&gt;   3 before I&#39;m dead.  Hymm is cool, but at L50 when you are healing<br/>
&gt;   tanks with 2k hp, it really sucks.  Hymm didn&#39;t grow as fast as<br/>
&gt;   I did.  It&#39;s much easier to Clarity a healer, than to even think<br/>
&gt;   about mixing Hymm.  It&#39;s simply not worth the effort.  I love my<br/>
&gt;   Charm song, I never get to use it however as I don&#39;t fight many <br/>
&gt;   things that are L37 or lower.  Yet another song I outgrew.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great rant, and I have to say it echos most of my feelings over the last<br/>
few months as well. Especially for the Bard, high levels just doesn&#39;t<br/>
have the pay off you&#39;d expect. Most other classes become pretty well<br/>
god-like at high levels, even the generalist classes like the cleric and<br/>
druid get respectable damage spells at the end of thier career. Even<br/>
melee classes seem to come into their own. But the bard seems to just<br/>
become a narrow specialist, good for providing huge resists for dragon<br/>
hunts, and a few other limited things, but the payoff for all that work<br/>
and dying seems pretty weak.<br/>
