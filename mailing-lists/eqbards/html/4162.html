<div id="ygrps-yiv-295732674">For those of you who ponder the effectiveness of weapons. EQ&#39;lize just put<br/>
up a nice 1HS and 2HS ratios section on their site<br/>

My mistake it was not a Blackened Iron Crown<br/>
but a Black Ironed Gown +5 cha because of the crisp seams.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; And what if that person that retired their main character, who got<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rubicite? Should they just delete that character and lose the<br/>
rubicite?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; How are they depriving anyone else?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s quite clear that simply twinking a character and CAMPING<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; items to twink another char are quite different.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But these are indistinguishable.  Given a symptom that has a<br/>
&gt; &gt; neutral cause and a negative cause, you are going to share in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the misery handed out by those bitter about the negative<br/>
&gt; &gt; cause.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re indistinguishable to you. What business is it of yours? None.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If there&#39;s a symptom of something that has a GOOD cause (prevents me from<br/>
&gt; going and camping with my new character all over again) and a negative<br/>
&gt; cause, YOU may share in the misery, but I won&#39;t. Not once have I felt any<br/>
&gt; pain due to a twinked person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had friends do the same thing as you.  But I daresay,<br/>
&gt; &gt; most twinked characters are secondary (or third, or fourth,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc) characters made by players who want to build up a<br/>
&gt; &gt; different class/character quickly, with little regard for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the toes they&#39;ll be stepping on on the way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh yes, look at all those toes I stepped on by not camping for tomahawks..<br/>
&gt; oh my god. I guess I better go camp those items (with my new char), making<br/>
&gt; everyone wait longer and the game less and less fun for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t automatically associate all the evils of camping rares to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; twink newbies with simply twinking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The alternative is to ignore the evils.  Rock and hard place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Most people choose to shoot the occasional innocent rather<br/>
&gt; &gt; than let the bad guy get away with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The alternative is to stop crying and whining over things that are most<br/>
&gt; likely not hurting you and most likely do more good than harm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your choice seems to be to shoot all the innocents just in case there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; bad guy in there. What an honorable decision, yes, you shot the bad guys..<br/>
&gt; nevermind those people who are actually making the situation better.<br/>
