&gt; Someone asked about this a short time ago and as I am currently 23 I was<br/>
&gt; excited about hearing any replies, welp, there were none, and I think I know<br/>
&gt; at least part of why. These are some tough levels to solo. And what soloing<br/>
&gt; you can do can be pretty tedious.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I stopped soloing completely long before 23 so I don&#39;t really know<br/>
(anyone think it may be harder for a bard to solo on a young server,<br/>
where banded is still the only armor available to a medium size bard<br/>
until well into the 30&#39;s?) However, I have seen someone claim they were<br/>
able to solo in unrest in their mid 20&#39;s. How they would do it is a bit<br/>
beyond me, especially and manage to avoid yard trash joining the fight.<br/>
(or is unrest so heavily camped now that even the yard trash is rare?)<br/>
