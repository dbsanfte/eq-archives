<div id="ygrps-yiv-196610708">Hi John,<br/>
<br/>
I appologise if you thought I was attacking your post.<br/>
I was simply stating my opinion:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Any group member should be allowed to participate in<br/>
any lotto the group holds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Somebody smarter than me used Baldur&#39;s Gate as an<br/>
example.  Wish I&#39;d have thought of that---made the<br/>
point much better than I did.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly none of us care to have our group members<br/>
tell us that bards don&#39;t need, for example,  an FBSS<br/>
because we have songs to speed us up.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly a rogue would not appreciate someone else<br/>
telling him/her what weapon to use...regardless of<br/>
statistics or other rationale. <br/>
<br/>
Again, sorry if you thought I was attacking your post.<br/>
For that matter, I meant no offense to anybody, just<br/>
expressing an opinion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s another thing to consider.  If you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; going<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to base it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on who will get the best use out of it, are you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; basing it on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; raw numerical improvement, or percentage<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; improvement?  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I understand the discomfort here...and I am NOT<br/>
&gt; &gt; lashing out at anyone, but:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; *** who are we to tell someone else how to build<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; character? ***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The person asked for reasons why a rogue shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; preferential treatment for an EBW.  I gave a bunch<br/>
&gt; of points<br/>
&gt; shooting holes in the &quot;a rogue can use it better<br/>
&gt; than a bard&quot;<br/>
&gt; argument.<br/>
