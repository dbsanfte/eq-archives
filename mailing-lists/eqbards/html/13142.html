<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220972332">This is kind of an interesting thing you brought up, regarding the check<br/>
or flag when people are there. The other day I was camping the top of<br/>
the temple and Archon with a L30 group (on my L30 character) and we&#39;d<br/>
kill the spawns on the steps, mostly in melee, then when our puller<br/>
would pull from lower in the temple, we found the lizards would get<br/>
stuck on the corner by the stairs down. We found it annoying, but we&#39;d<br/>
simply have 3-4 of us go to that corner and kill the lizard then run<br/>
back. We did this for a few hours and made great exp.<br/>
<br/>
A guide messaged our group leader and said &quot;thank you for not exploiting<br/>
the faulty pathing in this area of the dungeon&quot;. It was actually kind of<br/>
nice to have it mentioned, since we were a bit irritated at having to<br/>
meet our pulls half-way. I know the temple&#39;s pathing has been bugged for<br/>
ages, I guess I just wasn&#39;t aware anyone actually exploited it. Exploits<br/>
don&#39;t seem like a very fun way to gain exp to me. I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
someone petitioned us in the hopes of moving our group from the spot<br/>
(seems unlikely, it was quite late and we had no visitors the entire<br/>
time) or they have a check, but it very well could be.<br/>

&gt;       I have heard that the GM&#39;s have somehow placed a monitor on the<br/>
&gt; top of the<br/>
&gt; temple. If someone up there casts a spell or attempts to camp out,<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; monitor thing reports it to a GM. I don&#39;t know if it will report<br/>
&gt; simply<br/>
&gt; being up there.<br/>
