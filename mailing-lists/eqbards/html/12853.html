<b>Subject:</b> Enchanters vs Bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945663495">Hello all!  I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, and thought I&#39;d post on a<br/>
subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the incompatability of enchanters and<br/>
bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game that work together as<br/>
poorly as these two?<br/>
<br/>
Problem 1: Overlapping duties.  Many Bard tasks can be done better by<br/>
Enchanters.  Crowd control, buffs, and mana regen are the big three.<br/>
<br/>
Problem 2: Enchanters make Bard AoE songs more or less useless.  Since so many<br/>
of our songs are AoE, our playlist is more limited than a Los Angeles Top 40<br/>
FM station when grouping with an enchanter.  I&#39;ve just learned on this list<br/>
that Largo does NOT wake up mezzed mobs, so I&#39;m adding that back into my<br/>
&quot;Enchanter Hotkey&quot; bank.  That&#39;s good news.<br/>
<br/>
Problem 3: Bard invis song kills Enchanter pets / breaks charm.  Yeah, this is<br/>
really the Bard&#39;s fault if they do this, and it can happen with other pet and<br/>
charm classes too.  However, there is a unique problem with Enchanters.  The<br/>
other night I got into a group in Unrest by the fountains.  One of the group<br/>
members was a casting Troll.  &quot;Shaman,&quot; I thought to myself.  Suddenly, a<br/>
typical Unrest train comes roaring by bearing half the house.  I kick in the<br/>
invis song to protect the group when the message &quot;Gebaner slashes itself for<br/>
32000 points of damage&quot; pops up, followed by a severe reaming from the<br/>
Enchanter who was in troll form.<br/>
<br/>
Problem 4: For some reason, most Enchanters I&#39;ve grouped with are total<br/>
jackasses.  They are constantly barking orders (usually in all caps) and<br/>
yelling at everybody.  It&#39;s very rare for Enchanters to give instructions ina<br/>
polite fashion, like &quot;Hey guys, please assist the puller so I can mez the<br/>
other mobs.&quot;  They are always self-congratualtory (&quot;Heh heh my ae mez rockz,<br/>
dOOd!&quot;) and showing off (&quot;Look, I&#39;m a table, d00dz!&quot; followed 1 minute later<br/>
by &quot;OOM&quot;).  They seem to be surly most of the time, I can&#39;t imagine them<br/>
having any fun with all their gripes.  And oh, if something goes wrong in<br/>
battle, it&#39;s NEVER their fault.  They point fingers all the time.  It&#39;s very<br/>
rare for an enchanter to say &quot;Sorry guys, I mezzed the wrong mob.&quot;  It&#39;s<br/>
usually &quot;My Mez wore off that mob!!!  Somebody must have attacked it!  Idiots!<br/>
It was probably one of those retarded bard songs!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, Enchanters are a great class.  They can enable any group<br/>
to handle mobs that would be unattainable otherwise.  And there are some good<br/>
apples in the bunch who can play their role well without being a jerk.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have any tips on how a Bard and Enchanter can group together<br/>
successfully and work with each other rather against?  Right now, whenever an<br/>
enchanter is in my group, I feel like an underpowered tank, which is not a fun<br/>
role to play.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
