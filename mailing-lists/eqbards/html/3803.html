 </span></blockquote>Are you serious? On Solusek Ro, Unrest is one of the train capitols of the <br/>
world. I&#39;d guess that during prime time I hear &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE&quot; shouted <br/>
around once every ten minutes or so.  And these aren&#39;t just wimpy gnolls, <br/>
they often include Hags that deal hundreds of points of damage in a single <br/>
nuke.</div>
