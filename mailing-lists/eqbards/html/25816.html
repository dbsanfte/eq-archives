 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m impressed.  I have an awesome connection, great equipment, and have <br/>
been playing Bard for 3 years now.  I still barely manage 4.  I prefer 3, <br/>
as it lets me think instead of just button mashing, and lots of times, that <br/>
think-time lets me adjust my songs on the fly to changing circumstances - <br/>
something that 5-song goober probably can&#39;t manage.  Also remember that <br/>
every time he sings a song, he&#39;s getting area-effect aggro, so multiply <br/>
that times five, and you&#39;re probably seeing a bard who abuses the <br/>
high-level clerics in his guild.<br/>
