<div id="ygrps-yiv-574954502">Hmmm... claws aren&#39;t your style and axes aren&#39;t your style. Hmmmm.... with<br/>
that in mind, here are my suggestions.<br/>

Brazen Brass Kilij<br/>

Dragoon Dirk<br/>
Staff of Writhing<br/>
Crystalline Blade<br/>

<br/>
Any others?<br/>

&gt; Hmmm, is that what these funny looking gloves are made of?  <br/>
&gt; are you sure?<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s disgusting surely they just call&#39;em that, they aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; really made of<br/>
&gt; the skin of a sentient being at all, naw just another <br/>
&gt; marketing ploy like<br/>
&gt; Naugahide right?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have tried for the belt and been laughed off the auction <br/>
&gt; channel.  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; sure why but there were multiple laughers so I backed off.  I <br/>
&gt; did almost get<br/>
&gt; a thick banded belt bizarrely from one of the guys who said I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; chance in Guk of seeing a troll hide belt.  Bizarre, truly bizarre.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought about the claws.  Umm, no def not my style.  In <br/>
&gt; fact, now that I<br/>
&gt; think about it, ick.  I&#39;d rather use my crappy combine scimmy <br/>
&gt; than look like<br/>
&gt; some wolvie clone or mr krueger&#39;s understudy.  Sigh, guess if <br/>
&gt; I insist on<br/>
&gt; cool and useful I&#39;ll just have to wait.  I&#39;d settle for cool though.<br/>

&gt; Since you are hanging out in Guk, try to get your hands on <br/>
&gt; the dark elf hide<br/>
&gt; gloves and the troll-hide belt.  They are bard/rogue only so <br/>
&gt; the demand<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t as<br/>
&gt; high for them.  Those two will give you ten more points to <br/>
&gt; your STR.  After<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; got those two items I was able to start wearing bronze plate <br/>
&gt; and still have<br/>
&gt; room<br/>
&gt; to carry stuff.  My base STR is 76 and with items is now 100.  Another<br/>
&gt; option is<br/>
&gt; the Blackened Iron Crown in Runnyeye. I think it also adds <br/>
&gt; five points to<br/>
&gt; STR<br/>
&gt; plus bonuses to resists.  For weapons, thulian claws seem to <br/>
&gt; be the bard<br/>
&gt; weapon<br/>
&gt; of choice for those in their 20s and will cost around 400PP.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hail all!<br/>
&gt; &gt; After my latest adventure grouping with our guilds new <br/>
&gt; wizard in cleri&#39;c<br/>
&gt; &gt; clothing I decided to foray off and try my hand at soloing <br/>
&gt; once more.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have journeyed to far off Upper Guk where I have been <br/>
&gt; taking on the Heart<br/>
&gt; &gt; Spiders found there.  The experience has thus far been most <br/>
&gt; fruitful both<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; terms of silks and xp.  While I died 4 times the first <br/>
&gt; nite, my ping was<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; an all time record low (for me) and I was able to make it <br/>
&gt; back to my body<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; 27 minutes!  I have found my experience bar moving steadily <br/>
&gt; upward and<br/>
&gt; &gt; expect to make 18th level tonite.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My question is this?  What sort of equipment should I start <br/>
&gt; looking for at<br/>
&gt; &gt; my level to help improve my performance.  A lot of the <br/>
&gt; equipment I have<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt; is already better than I could get on my own as my trade skills have<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually been profitable!  Sssshhh... don&#39;t tell Verant.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m thinking<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; I need most is a primary weapon upgrade, I am currently alternating<br/>
&gt; between<br/>
&gt; &gt; a Dragoon Dirk and a Screaming Mace as primary.  I have <br/>
&gt; about 250pp, but<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; easily make another 100-200 by selling cured silk this <br/>
&gt; week.  I welcome<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggestions that don&#39;t require me to carry a stupid axe ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think my armor is as good as it will be for a while, <br/>
&gt; except maybe for my<br/>
&gt; &gt; helm.  I have Barbed Arms and legs, Crush tunic, <br/>
&gt; Bloodstained Mantle,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bearskin Boots, a sleek black cape, Leatherfoot Raider&#39;s <br/>
&gt; helm, 2 jagged<br/>
&gt; &gt; bands, bracer of erolissi, silver-plated bracer, purity <br/>
&gt; belt (still?),<br/>
&gt; &gt; electrum pearl necklace (upgrade to gold?).  I use a chitin <br/>
&gt; shell shield<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; dual wield depending on the situation.  Any ideas what <br/>
&gt; armor upgrades I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could get without bumping my weight up too much?  I&#39;m a <br/>
&gt; natural weakling<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Str73) so have concentrated on stat boosting armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 	Thanks for the input!<br/>
