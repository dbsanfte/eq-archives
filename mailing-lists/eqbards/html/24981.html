<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-389745718">Talies it&#39;s static effect times. problem is they aren;t standard.<br/>
SS arms give invigor about 30 sec<br/>
ss boots give aria of eagles 5 min levitate.<br/>
ss breast plate gave 30sec song of travel don&#39;t know what it is currently.&#92;<br/>
<br/>
The really stupid part is the message is X piece glows.  Would it have hurt to say sings? hums, heck even rattles?<br/>

&gt; I was just looking around and noticing that there are certain effects on<br/>
&gt; Bard armour that... well.. confuse me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Resonant / Melodic breastplates both bear the effect Selo&#39;s Song of<br/>
&gt; Travel.  How does this work?  Does it stay &quot;clicked&quot; until you zone or does<br/>
&gt; it last a certain amount of time?  I&#39;d really hate to have to start<br/>
&gt; twisting armour ;)<br/>
