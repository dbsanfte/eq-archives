<br/>
I agree.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been using my new tagline from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
Crier Sharpsong<br/>
EverQuest - pretend it&#39;s a game.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; people seem to get awfully worked up over a game... to the point of<br/>
&gt; coming across rude to people, the game ceases to be UN-fun (actually -<br/>
&gt; the game has always been fun for me - its some of the posts on this<br/>
&gt; list that bother me). Anyway, that was  what I was<br/>
&gt; objecting to... NOT whether a person really does deserve or not deserve<br/>
&gt; things etc.... Anyway - I have said enough on this (its a good thing that<br/>
&gt; people don&#39;t HAVE to agree on things or this thread will never end).<br/>
