is you have to get exeactly the right number and class of people for the<br/>
fight.  Too few your damage just isn&#39;t keep up with his melee + ae<br/>
lifetaps.  Too many and you&#39;re no longer adding anything to the fight,<br/>
just more HP for him to gain when he lifetaps.  My guild has fought the<br/>
current Maestro with Six Note + Evensong, and we were able to kill him<br/>
with 4 casualties, all melee.<br/>
	I went oom at least 5 times during that fight.  Medding up just<br/>
enough for a greater heal and tossing it on the lowest tank in the group.<br/>
But, in the end we were able to pull it off.<br/>
