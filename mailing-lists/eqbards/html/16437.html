&gt;heh heh for me I&#39;d rather they snare as a mob approaches 50%.  We have this<br/>
&gt;problem of letting DoT&#39;s do their full damage and many of our fights last 2<br/>
&gt;mins.  Heck we had a stupid darkness snare wear off on a goblin last nite<br/>
&gt;and it was ugly.  The necro even admitted he was lazy by just hitting the<br/>
&gt;mob once with the slowdown and then not giving it a second thought that<br/>
&gt;after 2 minutes it probably wasn&#39;t slowed again.  I am lucky though in that<br/>
&gt;both the druids and ranger that I group with are snare happy if anything.<br/>
&gt;No one would accuse them of being snare lazy that&#39;s for sure!  My guess is<br/>
&gt;you aren&#39;t snare lazy either Faerain!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You would bet wrong. I&#39;ve had snares wear off on me. Although, part<br/>
of the problem is, by the end of the battle, I am medding<br/>
furiously for mana for heals. I have extra mana for snares at the BEGINNING<br/>
of the fight (unless someone pulls before I&#39;ve medded enough mana for<br/>
heals, either. My regular partner doesn&#39;t do that, Anna Faefriend, but<br/>
pickup groups have been bad at not waiting for their healer!) If snare<br/>
is resisted three times in a row, they have me not even Snare, and just run<br/>
it down<br/>
(We&#39;re fighting in Mistmoore) Because they&#39;d rather have my mana for heals.<br/>
(Though I need to train them to tell me when a second critter enters the<br/>
battle so I can astand up and snare that as well)<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention learning to throw snares on things in the first place...<br/>
Despite having it always memmed, I have not had to use it much until<br/>
lately.<br/>
