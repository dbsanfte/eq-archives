&gt; &gt;2) Lullaby is a 1 (to about 1.5) tick song. It is not effective when<br/>
&gt; twisted <br/>
&gt; &gt;with another song. If you plan to use this song as an Area Mezmerize, use <br/>
&gt; &gt;ONLY this song. The length is about 3-5 seconds long only.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Given this I have a question.  Since the song only pulses every 6 seconds,<br/>
&gt; how can you expect to keep a mob mez&#39;d even if you don&#39;t twist it?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Was the &quot;3-5 seconds&quot; a quote from GZ, or from an observer? <br/>
I suspect GZ only said it was 1-1.5 pulses, which would put it<br/>
at 6-9 seconds (which is what I&#39;d estimate it at).<br/>
<br/>
The 25% minimum resist rate is the killer though.<br/>
