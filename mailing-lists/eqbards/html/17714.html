<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599726609">Loaded question;-)<br/>
<br/>
But the point is moot since the decision was made and<br/>
the item given.<br/>
<br/>
...would it be possible to get a few buds together to<br/>
do this again?  Then you&#39;d get the crown....<br/>

&gt; participated in a Fire<br/>
&gt; Giant run, there were about 7 from our guild and 18<br/>
&gt; people in total so we<br/>
&gt; had more than enough, things went well and the first<br/>
&gt; giants were killed<br/>
&gt; easily, our monk puller was doing an excellent job<br/>
&gt; and managed to pull<br/>
&gt; Tranix solo, the crown was dropped and I asked to be<br/>
&gt; in the roll for it,<br/>
&gt; there was only myself and an enchanter there that<br/>
&gt; would use it to it&#39;s full<br/>
&gt; potential. But instead it was decided that the<br/>
&gt; enchanter should get to keep<br/>
&gt; the item and that I shouldn&#39;t get to roll for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was really angry to be treated like this<br/>
&gt; especially as we have just got a<br/>
&gt; new charm song, the tranix crown would of been<br/>
&gt; great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just thought I would post this here and see<br/>
&gt; whether you guys and girls<br/>
&gt; think I should of got to roll for this item?<br/>
