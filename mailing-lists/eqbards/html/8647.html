<div id="ygrps-yiv-550794424">i have also done the maid/butler combo to get my 2 wakis (now rusting cause<br/>
of my two yaks, wish they weren&#39;t no drop) with only myself and a level 50<br/>
druid.  the trick is to stagger the spawn and pull singles when you can.<br/>
since everything is green at 50, if you can invis to a good pulling spot (we<br/>
just hung in the butler&#39;s room the whole time) then you can pull one at a<br/>
time by using a long range spell.  stagger them out and fight one at a time<br/>
for hours.  as far as taking the whole castle i have not tried and wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want to =)  a level 40-45 group with a GGer could handle it if they were<br/>
slow and smart.  when i tried the ballroom in my mid 30s, high 30s, and low<br/>
40s i died all 3 times in full groups.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Actually i can go in and solo the maid, butler, princess, <br/>
&gt; &gt;etc no problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; wow.. I need your secrets &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;There is no one single trick to mistmoore...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; =(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;That being said, a full party of lvl 40-50&#39;s can get decimated <br/>
&gt; &gt;in mistmoore in no time flat. You pull a couple of harm touching <br/>
&gt; &gt;mobs (who knew cooks could harm touch!?!) and you wont even make<br/>
&gt; &gt;it into melee range.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ouch.  That just hurts hearing that.  What is the typical monster/<br/>
&gt; level breakdown inside the castle?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, so it&#39;s doable.  How do I convince a L40-45 group that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; reasonably safe to venture in?  hehe.  Just too many horror <br/>
&gt; stories out there.<br/>
