Personally, I play Anthem and Bellow when partying. Not very <br/>
exciting, I know, but none of the other songs at my level (13)<br/>
inspire me much.<br/>
Chant of Battle is only really useful if you use a drum, but<br/>
then the party loses a sword.  So only an option in a full<br/>
group, with several tanks IMHO.<br/>
And Chords is too dangerous unless you are very confident about<br/>
being able to take on anything that wanders past you and into<br/>
the song&#39;s range.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, after battle you switch to mandolin and heal.  8)<br/>
