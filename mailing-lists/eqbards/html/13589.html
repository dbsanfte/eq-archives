&gt; I think we have covered all the bases in this thread.  I also think its one<br/>
&gt; of those threads where both sides of the argument are correct.  As a 50th<br/>
&gt; level character, Naeeldar&#39;s opinion is the the #1 problem with EQ is that<br/>
&gt; there isn&#39;t enough stuff for 50th level players to do.  I agree with him<br/>
&gt; 100%.  As a 32d level player, my opinion is that the #1 problem with EQ is<br/>
&gt; that Verant seems to be neglecting the 46- players.  By this I mean there<br/>
&gt; are a lot of areas in the game that need to be fixed, i.e. more quality<br/>
&gt; quests, new items for medium level characters, bugs, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One point newer players may not be aware of, is that the game shipped<br/>
with a lot of zones unfinished. Maybe it was before your time but they<br/>
made a big deal of finally itemizing Permafrost last spring, then Sol A<br/>
and then Sol B. Then much later they did Kedge. Now they are finally<br/>
getting around to the planes but really they did the 46- stuff first and<br/>
in terms of quantity have done just as much if not more for 46- players<br/>
as for 46+.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is, as usual, perception. They&#39;ve done more recently<br/>
for 46+. It&#39;s just like the current crop of warrior complaints. Now<br/>
they&#39;ve finally started to fix some problems with Paladins and<br/>
Shadowknights, some Warriors are starting to complain there&#39;s nothing in<br/>
the patches for them, possibly because they weren&#39;t around when Warriors<br/>
got their buffing, and the very first class specific armor quests, and,<br/>
a huge number of Warrior only weapons, both in quests and in drops in<br/>
Sol B.<br/>
