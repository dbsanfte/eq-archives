&gt; How do you use it?  I cannot get it to work...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve used this a lot:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Target an NPC.<br/>
2.  Sing the song.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Counters can get in the way.  You&#39;ll see a failure message (target is <br/>
too far away?  target is not visible?  not sure, but you&#39;ll see one).  <br/>
Stand next to him/her.<br/>
<br/>
2.  It&#39;s a wind-based song, it will be better when you can use your flute <br/>
(which you will really only be able to practice when you get underwater <br/>
song).<br/>
<br/>
3.  It raises the /con level of the target, but it might not raise it <br/>
enough to change the text.  Since I assume that it gets better with <br/>
leveling, and you&#39;re low, this might be playing a part.<br/>
<br/>
4.  It&#39;s possible for your charisma to be high enough that you already <br/>
have the best available price, and changing the /con won&#39;t make a <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
5.  It affects ALL members of a faction within the same zone at the time <br/>
you sing it, so once you&#39;ve done it to one merchant, you&#39;ve probably <br/>
changed the rest already (since, for the most part, they&#39;re all the same <br/>
faction).<br/>
<br/>
6.  If you sing it to a member of another faction, you lose your effect <br/>
with any previous faction you&#39;ve sung it to.<br/>
<br/>
7.  It appears to last until you zone, although it&#39;s possible that it is <br/>
just very long-lasting.</div>
