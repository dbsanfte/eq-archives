&gt; Check out this Druid kiting guide.  It tells you exactly how Druids can solo<br/>
&gt; REDs that are 6 levels above them.  Who needs heals when you never get hit?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about when the bard in your party is getting the snot beat<br/>
out of him?<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t understand why people equate &quot;solo reds&quot; with<br/>
overpowered.  The bard is arguably the worst class for soloing<br/>
mobs (I was stuck with greens and low blues in my low 20s)<br/>
outside of kiting, but I think most would agree we&#39;re not<br/>
underpowered.  The &quot;power&quot; of a class is a multi-dimensional<br/>
thing, like an airplane&#39;s performance envelope.  Being<br/>
particularly good at one does not make a class overpowered.  <br/>
I mean, heck *I* could solo reds with my bard if I wanted to.  <br/>
Does that mean &quot;bards are way overpowered&quot;?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s true that Druids get their last heal spell at 29 (not 34), but after 29<br/>
&gt; they get 4 Regeneration spells that help heal themselves and the party.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which are pretty useless in combat situations, for the same<br/>
reason Hymn becomes less useful in combat the higher level you<br/>
are.  Yet people see that druids get heal and regeneration<br/>
spells, and this feeds their belief that druids are<br/>
overpowered.<br/>
<br/>
At the level I&#39;m at (30), the *only* reason I&#39;d prefer a druid<br/>
in the party is for the transport spells.  Given a choice, I&#39;d<br/>
prefer a mage, wizard, enchanter, or cleric first.  Shaman is<br/>
a close tossup, but they get a ton of buffs that would make me<br/>
prefer one over a druid.<br/>
