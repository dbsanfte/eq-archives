&gt;   We get our advantages, and we get our disadvantages.  I&#39;ll take a<br/>
&gt; lesser kiting ability over spending all night medding ANY DAY (which is<br/>
&gt; about all my cleris seems to do any more).  All I seem to play anymore<br/>
&gt; is my bard.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Btw,  bards are way better kiters than druids. Or I should say,<br/>
it is possible to kite way more effectively with a bard than a druid.<br/>
Very few people seem to know how to do it though. Chords is<br/>
area song remember? You can without too much trouble, kite<br/>
_3_ monsters at the same time. Do not try 4, if they get too<br/>
close together (which will happen, since it is what you are <br/>
trying to do) one or two will split up and run off a bit, then come<br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh, and druid 14lvl dot does 2dam/second. You can kite same<br/>
even with bellow if you get a sow. Or strafe at the same time and<br/>
you don&#39;t even need sow for normal speed monsters. However,<br/>
I kited 3 blue-yellows or low reds when I was around 14-18lvls<br/>
sometimes. It&#39;s not as fun always as melee, so I did not purely<br/>
kite. It took me 5minutes to kill 3 of them. Don&#39;t know how much<br/>
chords does damage, but I bet my butt it does more than 2dam/second<br/>
with a lute at that level. And THEN you add a multiplier for 3 ;)<br/>
Lets just say, I wish I would find the boredom to train my brass<br/>
skill up so I could use Discord. It is way faster to do damage from<br/>
what I tried with bats and rats.<br/>
