<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562276849">I&#39;ve helped people with out so much as a thank you, more like I&#39;m some NPC<br/>
in the game for players to depend upon.  Also, I have recieved tips, though<br/>
rarely, most I think was 5pp once.<br/>
<br/>
But there is nothing wrong with setting up a &quot;business,&quot; as was the original<br/>
idea.  If I am a bard and I make it a point to be at the Kaladim<br/>
dock -every- time the ship rolls in, roughly every 14 hours, I am not going<br/>
to the trouble to do this out of charity.<br/>
<br/>
Most high level characters have reams of pp to spare, let alone 5gp.  One<br/>
bard hauling enough people for such a low fare could make a good venture of<br/>
it.  Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s greedy or anything else, he made an effort to be<br/>
there, he should expect compensation.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise if a bard set up a service between Freeport and Qeynos, and did<br/>
nothing but make the trip back and forth, what do it for free?  I say no, go<br/>
ahead and charge.<br/>
<br/>
Now helping someone out if you&#39;re headed that direction, or bored and want<br/>
to explore, this is an entirely different matter.<br/>

&gt;I always tell people that I work on Doanations or offerings. I have never<br/>
&gt;said I will cjharge 1 pp etcc because I had seen a friend say that and once<br/>
&gt;he got the fare to his corpse he just left and did not even pay for it. If<br/>
&gt;you make the other person feel that you are helping from the kindness of<br/>
&gt;your heart they feel compeled to help you in turn. I once got a Mino Axe<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have never set a price for my services because I find that donations<br/>
&gt;work<br/>
&gt;&gt; out very well.  When I hit level 4 and got the spell someone needed help<br/>
&gt;&gt; right away.  I helped him and got 3PP.  That was a fortune at level 3.  A<br/>
&gt;&gt; few levels later while fighting in West Karana I heard someone cry out<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; help.  I had to run to the zone with Croon and Froon chasing me but he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>got<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; his corpse.  After we met back up I got about 29 PP worth of stuff from<br/>
&gt;him.<br/>
&gt;&gt; That is BY FAR the best I have been paid.  If people ask I usually tell<br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have received between 1GP and 29PP before.  I usually get about 1PP<br/>
&gt;&gt; depending on the difficulty.  I think I&#39;ll stick with this practice.  But<br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am running to somewhere an catch up to someone going the same place I<br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;&gt; invite them and speed them up for no charge.  But if I have to go out of<br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;&gt; way I probably would.<br/>
