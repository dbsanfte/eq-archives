<div id="ygrps-yiv-935227704">Welcome, Jerrilia! Like some here, I am a long-time lurker, occasional<br/>
poster. I started my bard last August and continue to enjoy playing him<br/>
every chance I get. You have a long, rewarding career ahead of you, and have<br/>
mentors like Sylly to consult whenever you need to. IMO the bard is the most<br/>
fun class to roleplay and the most versatile. I&#39;d start one again in a<br/>
heartbeat if I had it to do over.<br/>
<br/>
Lately the topics here have concerned giants and dragons and planes (oh<br/>
my!), because the long-time experts are now all master bards and they&#39;re<br/>
bored with mundane (i.e. &lt; 46) life. =D (no offense, oh minstrel masters!)<br/>
Don&#39;t let their cynicism deter you. It will be a long time before you reach<br/>
50th level and many things will change by then, most notably the Kunark<br/>
expansion. Plus, bug fixes and class enhancements are introduced in patches<br/>
frequently and, for the most part, have been improving the bard class. I<br/>
remain hopeful that the results will keep me addicted for another 6 - 12<br/>
months. YMMV.<br/>
<br/>
John(tm) Kim, for example, is presenting his recent lullaby test results to<br/>
Verant to prove that the 15th (Lullaby) and 28th (Pixie Strike) songs are<br/>
bugged. Someday they will be fixed. Until then you will hear various levels<br/>
of dissatisfaction displayed on the bard boards over the issue, to put it<br/>
mildly. But it&#39;s no reason to quit, unless you&#39;re not having fun. I plan to<br/>
have to have fun, lullaby or no!<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, new holder of the lute. It keeps getting better.<br/>

P.S. Sylly, I admire your attitude. You are (and always have been) an<br/>
awesome role-model for us younger bards.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S. Harmonic, keep the faith, sir. It will get better. Look me up in<br/>
game. We&#39;ll get drunk and try to figure out who the real ladies are on<br/>
Innoruuk. ;)<br/>

Greetings and Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
First off, you have a lot of great times ahead of you!  The bard is a very<br/>
capable and enjoyable class to play even though I do believe that it is also<br/>
one of the more difficult.  As a brad you get to experience things from the<br/>
caster class as well as the melee classes. You will get to do many things.<br/>

&gt; Let me introduce myself.  I&#39;m a new player to Everquest (received it for<br/>
&gt; Christmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>
&gt; shamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What items should I<br/>
&gt; be pursuing in the near future?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard route?  What<br/>
&gt; makes the bard fun?<br/>
