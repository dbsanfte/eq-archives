<div id="ygrps-yiv-629480232">Not to defend them - but don&#39;t forget they have to recoup their initial<br/>
expenses.  Does anyone know how long the game was in development?  Also -<br/>
don&#39;t forget hardware costs.  So yes - it&#39;s possible they have just (or not<br/>
quite yet) turned a profit.<br/>
<br/>
As far as a small company - they are going to need some major venture<br/>
capital to pay developers salaries for several years without income - and<br/>
then buy lots of servers.  Remember when UO and EQ came out?  40,000 ppl<br/>
sign up and expect flawless play and the companies are overwhelmed with<br/>
bandwidth needs.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand - perhaps part of the problem is a company like Sony<br/>
expecting Console-game type profit margins.  That point will be moot in the<br/>
near future as consoles have Internet access - and they vast majority of<br/>
gamers will be console users (think about that!)  I read on a webpage<br/>
somewhere the prediction that console Internet users will surpass PC<br/>
Internet users in the year 2002.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;d buy this except that with the money they have rolling in it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; a big proposition to do the minimal testing/consideration they aren&#39;t<br/>
doing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suspect most of the money is going back to Sony.  At 100k<br/>
&gt; customers at $10/mo, that&#39;s $1 million/mo.  If all the profits<br/>
&gt; were being reinvested in the game, they&#39;d have 40+ employees<br/>
&gt; working on it all with salaries around $100k/year, with<br/>
&gt; per-employee expenses running around $100k/year.  The numbers<br/>
&gt; were about the same for UO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s for this reason that I think the first truly successful<br/>
&gt; persistent MMORPG will be made by a small company, not a giant<br/>
&gt; like EA or Sony or Microsoft.  So far, they&#39;ve all been<br/>
&gt; treating this genre like any other game - code it, sell it,<br/>
&gt; rake in the dough, slap on a few bug fixes.<br/>
