<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ouch, this certainly seems like a sticky situation...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was supposed to<br/>
&gt; happen?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, that&#39;s definately a bug.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck again if I<br/>
&gt; try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to pull my<br/>
&gt; corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You should be able to, but you have to be pretty close for this to work.  You<br/>
will likely have to swim to the bottom for it to work.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; 3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s corpse?  My<br/>
&gt; theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but in the Ocean<br/>
&gt; of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the right<br/>
&gt; direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you are looking<br/>
&gt; for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of Tears zone<br/>
&gt; then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse was in the<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the corpse was in the ocean of tears, your song would not have located it, so<br/>
the corpse is in the BB zone, but it sounds like it wasn&#39;t in the correct zone<br/>
space.  This bug happened to a friend of mine once when he died due to a weird<br/>
treeform bug.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; 4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on the<br/>
&gt; bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is really odd, since players do a swim animation when they are underwater.<br/>
It could have been an NPC, or perhaps a GM, but they swim when they are<br/>
underwater as well as far as I know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to /petition.<br/>
&gt; Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>
&gt; retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I sure<br/>
&gt; hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to retrieve it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GMs make no promises in this regard, but given the circumstances of your death<br/>
(including the bug involved) if you are patient a GM will likely help you.  They<br/>
may not though.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
