<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-604690795">This is from Allakhazam&#39;s site.  If it&#39;s true then the quest is either<br/>
broken or I completed it incorrectly as this is what I thought I&#39;d done:<br/>
<br/>
Fabian&#39;s Strings: Sansa Nusk in the Bard&#39;s Guildhouse is trying to make lute<br/>
strings for Fabian.  This is a difficult task because<br/>
Fabian uses special strings made out of Troll Gut, and Sansa is all out.<br/>
Sansa will ask you to bring her troll gut so she can make<br/>
string for Fabian.  I have been told that Troll Gut can be found on  a ghoul<br/>
named Zahal the Vile in North Karanas.  It might also be<br/>
found on some trolls wandering in the Karanas, but I am not sure of that.<br/>

&gt; clicking on it<br/>
&gt; &gt; to see if it will open like a backpack.  I&#39;m dying to know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t open, just one somewhat heavy item.  Next time I&#39;m in Qeynos I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; see what she has to say, thanks for the info.<br/>
