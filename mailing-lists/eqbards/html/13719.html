&gt; OK I got one for Dean and John.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all know that mobs get a second resist check against pixie strike and<br/>
&gt; lullaby.  Lets say for the first check they get a 25% (1 out of 4) chance to<br/>
&gt; resist and a 33% (1 out of 3) chance for the second resist.  Whats the<br/>
&gt; overall chance that they make just one of the two resists?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since a failure on the first resist is a total failure, distinguishing between <br/>
failure/success and failure/failure isn&#39;t important.  (In fact, I doubt that <br/>
they even make the second resist check if the first one fails - what would <br/>
be the point?)  The numbers are:<br/>
<br/>
Failure on the first:    1/4<br/>
Success/Failure:  3/4 times 1/3, or 1/4<br/>
Success/Success:  3/4 times 2/3, or 1/2<br/>
<br/>
Failure on the first breaks down as:<br/>
Failure/Success:  1/4 times 2/3, or 1/6<br/>
Failure/Failure:  1/4 times 1/3, or 1/12<br/>
These add up to 3/12, or the 1/4 shown above.<br/>
<br/>
As required, these add up to 1.<br/>
<br/>
50/50 shot of failure.  Yucch.<br/>
