I have a Charming macro of...<br/>
  /stopsong<br/>
  /g Charming %T<br/>
  /cast &lt;charm&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I tried a complicated...<br/>
  /pet backoff<br/>
  /ass &lt;Puller Name&gt;<br/>
  /pet attack<br/>
...with various /pause # statements and always ended up with my pet <br/>
just standing around looking stupid.  Tried &quot;/pet who is leader&quot; in <br/>
there too as an additional alert to party members, but have not<br/>
redone <br/>
it since it got trimmed back down to &quot;/pet attack&quot; as I have just<br/>
been <br/>
charm kiting since.<br/>
<br/>
I planned to try the one you said but haven&#39;t gotten around to<br/>
working <br/>
out the pauses... I wonder if having the last line hit hotkey 10 and <br/>
putting the key in slot 10 would keep it going.  Best to test that <br/>
near a zone methinks in case I start an infinite loop.<br/>
