<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777216802">That would definitely help, but just make everyone bind in cities only.<br/>
That would eliminate the huge discrepancy between casters and non-casters<br/>
that now exists until level 29.  Currently if I and my caster friend both<br/>
die, he has regained his lost experience by the time I get back to the<br/>
dungeon to regain my corpse.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ones gated to the zone entry.  Naturally the gobs all headed that way<br/>
&gt; immediately.  Also since SoW can last for 25+ minutes its pretty easy for<br/>
&gt; SoW casters to still have speed underground and cause huge trains so that<br/>
&gt; only the bards get their speed taken away.<br/>

  There is no real need for it.  And it&#39;s only used to exploit <br/>
  the game:<br/>
<br/>
  1) Find the mob you want, tag it, gate to zoneline, and fight<br/>
     it there in a safer environment.<br/>
 <br/>
  2) Raid of Vox/Nagafen.  Need I say more?  hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
  3) Shortcuts back into deep dungeon areas to kill X mob<br/>
     instead of running through a fully spawned dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
  Those are the things I&#39;ve seen, I bet there are 3 more<br/>
  uses for the binding in dungeons which exploit one thing<br/>
  or another.  There is really no good reason to bind in <br/>
  a dungeon to defend doing it.  I mean they can bind right<br/>
  outside the entrance, which is something non-casters wont<br/>
  be able to do anyway.  No binding in dungeons would elimate<br/>
  the ability for casters to psuedo-train in the same fashion<br/>
  as Verant has deemed SoW/Selos users.<br/>
