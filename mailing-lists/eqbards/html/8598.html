&gt; &gt; &gt;back from dinner to find zero skill increase.  Hmm..  Ok, perhaps I *do*<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have to be in the PvP area, so I tried that.  Same results.  Ok, maybe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the Minotaur Horn - maybe it&#39;s the problem.  So the next time I was in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bank and thought about it, I traded out my Minotaur Horn (tired of the bag<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;in my wrist anyhow) for a standard store-bought horn.  Last night I tried<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1.  Use a brass horn, not the Mino Horn (wind, as previously noted)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Sing DDD, not Screech.  It is at least remotely possible (they&#39;ve made this <br/>
type of error before) that Brass is NOT the instrument of choice for Screech.  It is <br/>
not as if there is a valid way to measure the effect reliably, and since it can be <br/>
sung, you would not get a message that you were using the wrong instrument.  I know <br/>
that DDD will work for you.  Any remote area is fine.<br/>
<br/>
3.  If you enjoy ticking people off, practice this in High Pass.  You&#39;re perhaps too <br/>
high level for this to be fair, but I nearly maxed my skill (and got a lot of exp and <br/>
loot) doing nothing but standing at the corner tooting my horn.<br/>
<br/>
and, assuming that you&#39;ve done all this already (and I&#39;m beating a dead horse):<br/>
<br/>
4.  If you play DDD with a brass instrument for oh, say, 30 minutes (5 should do it) <br/>
and get no skill increases, you should /petition.  You have a problem.<br/>
