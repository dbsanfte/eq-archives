&gt;Does anyone know what happened to JM Capozzi.  I&#39;m sure he could settle this<br/>
&gt;issue once and for all.  Did Verant put a muzzle on him for posting details<br/>
&gt;of game mechanics on this list?<br/>
<br/>

Enchanters still have their &quot;ace in the hole&quot; (See Baelish&#39;s site, he has<br/>
weekly talks)<br/>

&gt;I have never seen/heard the term Black Helicopter used as a reference to<br/>
&gt;anything, military or EQ related.  What does this reference mean?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Weellll - Seems that as rumours go, Hanger 18 and all, somehow the rumours<br/>
began to include Black Helicopters.  South Park and the Simpsons and other<br/>
parodies make endless fun of it.  The first reference I heard was the<br/>
relationship of Black Helicopters to mutilated cattle.  Seems where you saw<br/>
the latter, the former would appear....<br/>
but there&#39;s more at alt.conspiracy.black.helicopters (chuckles)<br/>
