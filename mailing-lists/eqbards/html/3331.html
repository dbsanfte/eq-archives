If you are around L10 and have managed to save enough for a<br/>
combine and can&#39;t/don&#39;t want to make the trek to Crushbone for<br/>
a dirk, by all means buy one.  You should be able to sell it<br/>
later to a player for a profit, or to a merchant at a 10%-15%<br/>
loss, so they do not really cost as much as their price<br/>
indicates.  While the dirk has dropped the bottom out of the<br/>
combine rapier market, the combine longsword and scimitar<br/>
markets are still doing well because several classes that can<br/>
use those but cannot use the dirk.<br/>
<br/>
If you are L17 or higher and already have a dirk, a combine<br/>
for your off hand can be a good choice for the same reason.  <br/>
If you ever upgrade your off-hand weapon, you can easily<br/>
liquidate the combine and get 80%-90% of your money back (more<br/>
if you sell it to a player).  Unless you need the money *now*<br/>
for something else, most combines only end up costing 5-10pp<br/>
to own.<br/>
