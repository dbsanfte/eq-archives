<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185287016">Greetings John!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done this quest approximatly 7 times now, and got the 2H Langseax<br/>
once! Talk about making my day!<br/>
<br/>
Langseax, 1H Slash, 6 DMG, 23 DLY, Magical, Warrior Only<br/>
<br/>
Langseax of the Wolves, 2H Slash, 19 DMG, 44 DLY, +5 STR, +5 DEX, Magical,<br/>
		Warrior only, *LORE*<br/>
<br/>
Here is the key. You must have a &#39;high&#39; aimiably. I got myself &#39;high&#39; by<br/>
turning in tons of gnoll fangs to the barbarian warror woman in Halas. (I<br/>
just re-read that statement and left it the way it was ;))<br/>
<br/>
Myself and my roomate barabarian shamen make an evening out of this. We<br/>
each do each step of the way (even following and killing the murderer).<br/>
and that way we each get a sword ( and GREAT exp) at level 22 =) (I am at<br/>
3 bubbles of exp almost all from doing this quest multiple times)<br/>
<br/>
The rare drop guy (you will know becuase his name is NOT Basil, I forget<br/>
his name) was yellow to me at 22nd chord, and the regular guy is blue.<br/>
<br/>
(the heads look the same, you get the sword when you complete it. MY<br/>
suggestion is, if you get the 2H version LET someone else do it you KNOW<br/>
can complete it, I would HATE to see you lose it, also realize the 2H<br/>
version IS LORE, so sell give to someone before you get the 2H version<br/>
again!!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps =D<br/>

PS. HINT When you get the lions delight, and are running around everfrost<br/>
looking for Iceberg and Tundra Jack, <br/>
BE DARN CAREFUL YOU DONT HAVE THE LIONS DELIGHT ABOVE YOUR REGULAR FOOD.<br/>
I kept &#39;losing&#39; that darn lions delight, and couldn&#39;t figure it out!!<br/>
(Hint: Lions delight is EDIBLE). I felt like such a gumby! I was was NOT<br/>
&#39;delighted&#39; when I figured it out =D<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anyone here done the Langseax quest?  Last night, I did this quest,<br/>
&gt;to obtain one of the lovely Langseax swords for my warrior pal.  For<br/>
&gt;those of you who don&#39;t know the quest, it&#39;s an upper 20s type of quest,<br/>
&gt;and though not particularly hard, it&#39;s certainly time consuming.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did all the parts to the quest, obtained the final item (the murderer&#39;s<br/>
&gt;head), carefully sang my carrillon at the guy (who then regarded me<br/>
&gt;amiably), and gave him the head.  To which he said, &quot;Although the wolves<br/>
&gt;of the north bear you no ill will... blah blah blah NO SWORD FOR YOU!&quot;<br/>
&gt;(Okay, that wasn&#39;t the exact dialog, but you get the idea).&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Is it a warrior only quest or something?  It didn&#39;t seem to be.  Anyone<br/>
&gt;else had any experience with it?<br/>
