<br/>
I spent the day in Cazic Thule.  I loved it and hated it.  Experience<br/>
galore, but I died five times and gave most of it back.  Loot is okay,<br/>
but the market for fine steel is drowned and merchants only give me<br/>
about 6pp and 6gp for Two Handed Swords.<br/>
<br/>
The data rate tends to hover between 1200 and 3000 in the Courtyard, and<br/>
the maze even got camped out later in the day so that the data rate was<br/>
still greater than 1000 in there.  That just made tough situations<br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any good open areas for a 23 bard to go to?  I am sort of<br/>
burnt out on indoor areas and confined spaces.  I have never been to<br/>
Mistmore.  Is that an outdoor zone?  What levels is it good for?<br/>
