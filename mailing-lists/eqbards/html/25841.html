<div id="ygrps-yiv-621125185">Ok, I&#39;ve messed around with it some more, and as promised, here is my little<br/>
review.  :)<br/>
<br/>
For those with short attention spans, yes, it&#39;s worth the $30.<br/>

At least go and check out the picture of it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
For those wanting a little more detail:<br/>
I had it setup, ready for EQ, in about 5 minutes.  I had it connected to my<br/>
USB port forever, and after installing the software, I had a configuration<br/>
setup for EQ rather quickly.  You can either assign keystrokes to a button<br/>
press, or create macros.  The utility is very intuitive, with an image of<br/>
the controller and the area where you actually assign a function to the<br/>
button.<br/>
<br/>
The image helps you locate the button you&#39;re trying to set.  When you press<br/>
the button on the controller, the corresponding button on the image lights<br/>
up, as well as the field where you actually set the value to the keypress.<br/>
<br/>
Click on the field, which gives a menu.  There are 2 important selections.<br/>
Assign a key, or assign a macro.  If you click assign a key, it brings up a<br/>
little window, you press the key you want assigned to that button, click ok,<br/>
and it&#39;s set.  If you select assign a macro, it brings up a window.  In the<br/>
name, you name the macro, so you know what it is.  You also have the option<br/>
of saving the interval between key presses.  I disable this, although, with<br/>
a lot of trial and error, you could probably get some spectacular results.<br/>
Click Start, and every keypress and release, until you click Stop, is<br/>
recorded.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I created a macro for /pet attack.  I clicked the field for the<br/>
button I wanted as the /pet attack button, and selected the option to create<br/>
a macro.  I named it &quot;Pet Attack&quot;, disabled the option to save the interval<br/>
between keypresses, and clicked Start.  I then typed, &quot;&lt;enter&gt;/pet<br/>
attack&lt;enter&gt;, and then clicked Stop.  End result, when I hit that key in<br/>
game, in less than a second, the typing bar comes up, &quot;/pet attack&quot; is typed<br/>
in, and the command is executed...all without worrying about having a social<br/>
set up.<br/>
<br/>
Starting on the top row of buttons, from left to right, I set button 1 with<br/>
the Pet Attack macro.  Buttons 2, 3, 4, and 5 activate gems 5, 6, 7, 8 (home<br/>
position, is the bottom row of keys).  Button 6 is auto attack, and buttons<br/>
7, 8, 9, and 10 activate gems 1, 2, 3, and 4.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t figured out a use for the throttle, the only rotary function I<br/>
know of is scrolling the chat box.  I have a wheel mouse, and am too used to<br/>
using that with it, but if you don&#39;t have a wheel mouse, you can probably<br/>
assign chat scroll to it.  There is also a 8 way D-pad.  I only assigned up,<br/>
down, left, and right to the corresponding arrow keys, but you can also<br/>
assign the diagonals.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a shift function.  Red shift, blue shift, and green shift.<br/>
When you use the shift function, you can assign additional functions to a<br/>
button that is already assigned.  Just like hitting shift and then 7 for &.<br/>
I haven&#39;t messed with this much, either.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, it feels completely different than the keyboard.  You have to<br/>
get used to it.  I still fall back to the keyboard, if I get confused, and<br/>
mess up my twist.  However, I&#39;m confident that once I get the hang of it,<br/>
and get used to which gem spot is which key, it will blow away the keyboard.<br/>
This controller in the left hand, and the mouse in the right, it just feels<br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
The only ding, the D-pad is at the same time not sensitive enough, yet over<br/>
sensitive.  It&#39;s hard to explain.  I feel like I have to press up<br/>
exceptionally hard to move forward, yet it takes the slightest movement off<br/>
of true to get enough pressure on left or right, and start to turn.<br/>
Perhaps, another thing to get used to, but right now, it&#39;s a small irritant.<br/>
The only one.<br/>
<br/>
I also play Ghost Recon.  I haven&#39;t since setting up the controller, but I<br/>
plan on it this weekend.  It was made for shooters, so I&#39;m looking forward<br/>
to it.  :)<br/>

estimate better when to switch.  I have a very bad time trying to count and <br/>
switch, and this happens to be very helpful.<br/>
