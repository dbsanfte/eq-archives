<b>Subject:</b> A bard tried to PK me... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-23520827">...on Rallos Zek. He must&#39;ve been around 11th lvl or so (conned RED to me <br/>
at 8th) and he wasn&#39;t very effective at killing me. I ran, he followed, <br/>
whacking me on occasion until I bagged my one piece of Banded Mail and he <br/>
realized it wasn&#39;t worth killing me for a rusty sword (explanation for <br/>
those not on the PVP server: You can only loot one item from your victims <br/>
and you can NOT loot anything from a container so it&#39;s common to see people <br/>
letting themselves get hit while they put all their good stuff away. <br/>
Ridiculous? Yep. Funny? Indeed!).<br/>
<br/>
I must say though - I was very disappointed that a Bard was trying to <br/>
slaughter someone green simply for a piece of equipment, he even had the RP <br/>
flag on (for what that&#39;s worth) but I guess it takes all sorts eh? ;)<br/>

	I&#39;ve just sub&#39;d to the list and wanted to introduce myself.  I&#39;m having a<br/>
blast playing a Bard and consider this a fine class for someone who wants a<br/>
bit of everything ;)<br/>
<br/>
	One Question I have is I&#39;ve seen a Battle Drum mentioned on this<br/>
list...I&#39;ve never heard anyone speak of this instrument..is it made?<br/>
dropped? what?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
