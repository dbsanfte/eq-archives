<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911256955">I&#39;ve been trying to get my Lambent armor but had no luck. Sunday I tried<br/>
Perma, but I was seen by a mob whilst invis, ran and took a wrong turn and<br/>
ended up dieing, when I got back in the zone somone was shouting Icy<br/>
greaves, anyone want them, I shouted &quot;ME&quot; and he replied come to the king<br/>
room. Well I knew the king room was hard but I&#39;d never been in Perma so<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to get there, and that loot went to waste because no one<br/>
would show me the way there.<br/>
I went to Solusek A last night and everyone told me I&#39;d find it hard to get<br/>
to the Solusek Champ or Mage without a group of 6 level 30+&#39;s so I gave up<br/>
that idea.<br/>
I yet to go to Cazic or Guk but I will go when I hit level 28 (Staff of<br/>
Writhing Proc).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone on Veeshan want to help me in my cause??<br/>

PS I&#39;ve got a Lambent Fire Opal, just need Icy Greaves and Shin Greaves.<br/>

I got a Lambent Stone yesterday for 30PP.  His original auction was for<br/>
100PP.  All you have to do is put them in thier place. =)  It also helps if<br/>
you&#39;re the only Bard in the zone.  I may take your suggestions and head to<br/>
Perma and Guk and see if I can get some looting rights =).<br/>

&gt;I got lambert greves at 23.  Use your invise song and hit guk and perma to<br/>
&gt;get shin and icy greves respectively  if you spend some time  ~ 2 hour in<br/>
&gt;both dungons for me you can reqest looting rights for the armor. As it is<br/>
&gt;lore and heavy it is bad loot to most of the casters hunting there and<br/>
