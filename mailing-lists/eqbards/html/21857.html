<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008830540">Just curious, but what did you do when you logged in and all your guild<br/>
enchanters were busy in other groups post 55? Any hints on where you<br/>
played around? The only &quot;pickup&quot; groups I play in are put together<br/>
mostly from guild members, and when there&#39;s no enchanter, the places to<br/>
go at 55+ are pretty slim. I can go solo in Tim Deep, or team up with<br/>
casters in Skyfire, or try to put something together in Karnors or<br/>
Sebilis. But Karnors is getting green and if the 3 easy spots in Sebilis<br/>
are taken, without an enchanter it&#39;s pretty slim pickings. <br/>

&gt; both sides are strong arguments, and both jeff and kitasi are definitely on<br/>
&gt; oppopsite sides of the spectrum, with a lot of us somewhere in between.  i<br/>
&gt; think kitasi&#39;s gripe is not that he is &quot;always grouped with enchanter,<br/>
&gt; cleric, AND snarer&quot; but that most players want to be or refuse to play<br/>
&gt; otherwise.  i haven&#39;t run into these problems because i am lucky not to<br/>
&gt; ever, ever, ever be in pick-up groups.<br/>
