<b>Subject:</b> Bard armour <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-131774049">Well it&#39;s mostly armour I think.  As a lowly wood elf who is somewhat<br/>
weak, I&#39;m finding it more and more difficult to cope with all the<br/>
armour and weapons I carry, and still be able to pick up some loot.<br/>
<br/>
My str is somewhere around 80 (memory failure!).  And before I even<br/>
set out to hunt I&#39;m carrying all but 10 of it.  Now ok, I&#39;m kitted out<br/>
in some fairly decent armour, mostly banded and ringmail, and a piece<br/>
of bronze, so I&#39;m well protected.  But it&#39;s rather heavy!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, are there any suggestions about the type of armour I can<br/>
get that will be lighter?  Looking for cheap alternatives, or<br/>
somewhere to go murder things and steal their armour.  I can even go<br/>
out and deal with (most) wisps as a steady source of income if cheap<br/>
isn&#39;t possible ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all<br/>
