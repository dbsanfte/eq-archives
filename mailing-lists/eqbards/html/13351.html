<div id="ygrps-yiv-536915692">i think he is using a bind argument in order to really say we could use just<br/>
1 more defensive skill, such as parry.  i agree that we should get parry and<br/>
have it capped around the same as our dodge (125?).  it would just put us<br/>
one very small notch towards a melee class, which i do think we are far more<br/>
than a cleric or shaman.  i&#39;ve always thought we should not get bind, and<br/>
all the reasons for and against have already been gone over a million times.<br/>
