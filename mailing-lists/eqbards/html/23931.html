<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236961482">Ya know its kinda funny, this morning i got a pickup group in karnors, some<br/>
i&#39;ve grouped with multiple times in the past (well one anyways). The group<br/>
consisted of 2 warriors, a monk, a rogue, a druid and me.  Not once did the<br/>
druid get under 70-80 mana and I only played mana on downtime.  I was doing<br/>
an all instrument go at it. Doing berserker (for 3 more bubbles) and nivs<br/>
and hymn of restoration (to save the druid some mana).  The druid was pretty<br/>
much doing only group dmg shield, group sow, group chloro, sln, maybe 1 or 2<br/>
heals max per pull.  Was a very fun group, everyone was pleasant/joking<br/>
around.  They were also very happy with my song selections as well.  We<br/>
eventually lost our monk but got another druid, they nuked a bit and also<br/>
they shared the heals (which btw they love the new patch) and I would still<br/>
do the same songs.  We had a few bad pulls with 4 coming in which we kept<br/>
under control very quickly.  Only one druid ran low on mana after one of<br/>
these.  The grouped loved it, with the druid&#39;s dmg shield and my new ss<br/>
bracer dmg shield (woot!) we had free 29dmg every mob hit and i was<br/>
regenning 40hp+chloro so the mobs were dropping fast and the mana was<br/>
keeping full.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, not once did this group dare/dream of telling me what to do and we<br/>
even talked about how people always tell bards what to play. Some of them<br/>
had alt bards (dont they all hehe) and they loved me (i think i got a<br/>
marriage proposel from a halfling). Anyways, it was rather refreshing group<br/>
to not once hear &quot;play mana song&quot; in a couple hours especially with a non<br/>
cleric healer.<br/>

P.S. I wish there&#39;d be a halfling illusion mask out there<br/>

I totally agree :)  I&#39;m pretty amiable as long as I don&#39;t get my little<br/>
rebellious instincts all stirred up :)<br/>
Amazing what a &quot;please&quot; can do!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ultimately  the real issue is people&#39;s attitudes.  Like most <br/>
&gt; people - if you<br/>
&gt; TELL me to do something I wouldn&#39;t do otherwise - I&#39;m going <br/>
&gt; to be negatively<br/>
&gt; disposed towards it.  However if you ask me - nicely - it&#39;s a <br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt; thing entirely.  When I hear &quot;Play manasong please&quot; - <br/>
&gt; particularly from a<br/>
&gt; cleric or enchanter - odds are - I&#39;ll include in my song <br/>
&gt; twist - even if I<br/>
&gt; feel that it&#39;s less than ideal.<br/>
