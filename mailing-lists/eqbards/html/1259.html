<div id="ygrps-yiv-142131657">Hm, I&#39;m around the same level as you, and do -not- have the problem.<br/>
Personally, I ditched the Mino Axe I wielded around level 7 or so.  I<br/>
realized that my chief strength should be speed, take most advantage of my<br/>
buffing songs that way.<br/>
<br/>
Consider this: Recently a troll and I were good naturedly beating on the<br/>
same monster... he with some gigantic sword that seemed to be doing a<br/>
massive amount of damage, and me with a fine steel spear.  He bashed, I<br/>
bellowed.  And when all was said and done I got the loot.  The troll was<br/>
quite upset, stared down at the little man with the toothpick, couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand how I had bested him--especially when I conned &quot;blue&quot; to him.  Do<br/>
not underestimate a fast weapon.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s formulas about this people have posted here, I honestly think your<br/>
problem is that damn axe.<br/>
<br/>
I know I should upgrade to a combine weapon, haven&#39;t gotten around to it<br/>
yet.  And you know, almost tempted to grab a rapier...   can&#39;t decide if I<br/>
should.  Have a feeling the rapier might not be such a great &quot;main&quot; weapon,<br/>
yet I&#39;m certain I&#39;ll use a rapier when I dual wield.  (Part of my attraction<br/>
is that they look so damn cool, and I never see anyone using them.)  For now<br/>
I use my spear, which has a fine damage/speed advantage.  I may simply buy a<br/>
combine sword now (to keep my other skill up), and the rapier later.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
    Hello fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
    Man i envy you bards that are in the high 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s,  how did u ever<br/>
get that high?  I seem to be stuck at lvl 15.  My question is focused at u<br/>
higher lvl bards.  The question is does the bard get better?  Don&#39;t get me<br/>
wrong i love my lvl 15 bard but when i comes to dishing out damage in a<br/>
battle i am weak.  I know the bard class is not designed to be a warrior,<br/>
but for example, i bought a mino axe at lvl 9,  i still dishes the same<br/>
amount of damage now at lvl 15 as it did at lvl 9 except for the below song<br/>
and it only does 8 damage.  I would like to solo eventually but i&#39;m afraid<br/>
because i have a hard time with creatures that con blue to me.  You high lvl<br/>
players, is the bard worth the wait?  Will we eventually do more damage and<br/>
be able to hold our own?  I love the bard class but i also like to know i am<br/>
a valuable addition to any group.  Higher in lvl&#39;s groups are looking for<br/>
wizards, tanks, and healers where do we fit in?  Just a little frustrated i<br/>
guess from dying 3 times in Unrest yesterday...<br/>
<br/>
    U higher lvl players post a message with your secrets to success... I<br/>
need it..hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
    Humility....innorruk</div>
