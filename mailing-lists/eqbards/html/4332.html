My first reply to this was My God this man must not live, his head must be<br/>
jacked into the motherboard, then I thought, well its nice to get the truth,<br/>
it will be worth testing more to find out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt;Did you get the same results?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Offhand, I would say that at 12th level, your meditation skill<br/>
&gt;is only 60 (65?), so it will be &quot;failing&quot; at a pretty<br/>
&gt;substantial rate (whatever it is that failure does).  So I<br/>
&gt;would expect some variability in your mana regeneration times<br/>
&gt;regardless of whether or not the jig was playing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s also the possibility the jig may be interacting<br/>
&gt;unintentionally with meditation failures, causing an increase<br/>
&gt;in regeneration rate.  e.g. if &quot;succeeding&quot; at meditation<br/>
&gt;means you gain, say, 5 points of mana, and the jig reduces the<br/>
&gt;time for a meditation pulse from 8 sec to 6 sec (though I<br/>
&gt;still think this is a client refresh illusion), then it would<br/>
&gt;increase the regeneration rate because the success/fail check<br/>
&gt;would be made more frequently.  That would decrease<br/>
&gt;regeneration times at early levels, but show no difference at<br/>
&gt;later levels.<br/>
