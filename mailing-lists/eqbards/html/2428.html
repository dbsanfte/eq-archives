<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043762143">True and false.<br/>
<br/>
True that after a prolonged use of Clarity, (both Bardic and Enchanter)<br/>
sometimes the first cast of a spell after that APPEARS to use up far more<br/>
mana than it should.<br/>
<br/>
False that it makes the spells cost more.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s happening is a problem between the client and the server.   The<br/>
client thinks you have X mana, the server thinks you have Y mana, and in a<br/>
case like this, the server always wins.  The casting of a spell gets a fresh<br/>
update from the server, and that&#39;s when the mana bar is reset.  It&#39;s very<br/>
similar to what happens to your hitpoint bar and numeric when a healing<br/>
spell or Hymn is in effect.   It&#39;s being looked into now, should be fixed<br/>
soon, and even has a name... *Phantom Mana*<br/>
<br/>
What did you expect?  Verant bought the tickets and gave almost everyone the<br/>
day off when Star Wars opened. ;P<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s a random occurance, and only seems to happen after more than a<br/>
couple minutes of exposure to Clarity.  Many casters who&#39;ve experienced it,<br/>
and know it for what it is, have a simple (though possibly annoying)<br/>
work-around.   They cast a low cost spell to get a correct read on mana<br/>
before jumping back into the fray.<br/>

&gt;&gt;There is a bug that a spell cast while you are playing the mana song can<br/>
&gt;use<br/>
&gt;&gt;a whole lot more mana than usual (one whole bubble of mana on a spell that<br/>
&gt;&gt;normally takes one quarter or less).  Therefore it is not a good idea to<br/>
&gt;&gt;play the mana song during combat, unless the special case you mentioned<br/>
&gt;when<br/>
&gt;&gt;all casters are OOM.  otherwise during combat it can actually be<br/>
&gt;&gt;detrimental.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is this true?  I am often with groups that include 3 or more casters, so<br/>
&gt;power-medding during battle is common, and they have me play mana song<br/>
&gt;constantly.  None of them have mentioned anything like this.<br/>
