<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506180975">I have been playing a Bard for a long time on the regular servers.  I went<br/>
to the test server and decided to try something different.  After a few days<br/>
I had decided that when there real server came out I was going to use my old<br/>
trusty bard if nothing else because I could avoid that annoying root.  Then<br/>
the  news struck. Variant had restructured the code so root should be able<br/>
to stick even with accelerando.  I haven&#39;t done any testing with it to know<br/>
how effective it is now though.<br/>
<br/>
Also I have a question.  Why do you even bother with the pets.  If they<br/>
instigate the attack, take them out.  Don&#39;t bother with the pets, they are a<br/>
waste of time.  But thats just my opinion.<br/>
