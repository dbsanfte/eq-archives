<div id="ygrps-yiv-833735741">I don&#39;t think anyone here expects perfection (though 9 months after<br/>
commercial release, there should be no more bugs in a game, thats is<br/>
unfathomable to me)<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me most people get annoyed with Verant&#39;s decision making. <br/>
Assuming they have limited programming resources they often make pretty<br/>
bizarre choices of what to fix.  Our animation guy could either A)<br/>
remove the bard surfing animation from Selo&#39;s or B) Give us a drum. <br/>
Most people like the surfing or at worst didn&#39;t care about it, almost<br/>
everyone I know thinks the drum animation is awful.  SO they fix the<br/>
surfing.<br/>
<br/>
They have made countless patches trying to keep necro&#39;s and druids from<br/>
being able to solo too effectivly.  I have no problem with this, since<br/>
they are pretty hell bent of forcing people to group.  HOWEVER, how<br/>
about spending a fraction of that time giving zoning players a 5 second<br/>
invul so you wouldn&#39;t die before your computer gave you a chance to<br/>
respond.  You can bet if there was a bug where players got 5-10 seconds<br/>
of free attack time on a monster, they would fix that...<br/>
<br/>
It took them 8 or so months to implement things which were supposed to<br/>
be in the original game.  Poison, alchemy, some of our songs.  I won&#39;t<br/>
even get into the 5 continents which the game advertises.  <br/>
<br/>
A second major complaint set comes from supposed fixes which go into the<br/>
game, obviously untested.  The levitation thing was a clear example of<br/>
this, there was no way they tested that &quot;fix&quot; before putting it live,<br/>
since the bard bug was so obvious...<br/>
<br/>
COmplaint set #3: overcrowding.  When the game was released, they<br/>
assured us they would keep opening servers to keep 1500 people per<br/>
server at peak times.  I can&#39;t remeber the last time I got to play (I<br/>
work 9-5 job, so I play evenings and weekends, peak times) on Veeshan<br/>
when there were less than 1500 people on,  And Veeshan is not at the top<br/>
of list for crowding.  This is inexcusable on their part, and will be<br/>
the death of the game when someone finally manages to write a<br/>
competitive product. (Anyone want to join me and try?)<br/>
