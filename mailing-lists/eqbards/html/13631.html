<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548388005">I&#39;m now level 40, my wife&#39;s wood elf warrior is 38 going on 39 and my<br/>
brother&#39;s druid is 37.  Until now, we&#39;ve had no problems finding places to<br/>
hunt.  Sol A kings room, Lower Guk BR, MM, CT, Perma, etc.  When one is<br/>
camped we would simply go to another.  We haven&#39;t had problems finding a<br/>
spot since we&#39;ve graduated from aviaks at 23.  Now that I&#39;ve hit 40 and the<br/>
non-green spots in each of these are camped, we have to go elsewhere to get<br/>
xp.  My brother is a druid, so he pulls out the spell book and we go off and<br/>
flying looking for places to hunt.  Zone into sol b and everything is camped<br/>
but the circle room.   That sucked with a whole 4 miserable spawns every 25<br/>
or so minutes ASSUMING that someone from noble or pool didn&#39;t pull one of<br/>
our precious few spawns first.  Zone into lower guk and everything is camped<br/>
including the live side bridge.  Zone into Ogguk to find two groups already<br/>
sharing bouncers, one with a waiting list and the other made up of two high<br/>
40&#39;s not interested in more, spectres taken, dw gobs in oasis camped, giants<br/>
boring, Kithicor is nap time in the day and horrible xp at night, troll<br/>
guards camped and boring... Paw was even crowded and we don&#39;t know the zone<br/>
well enough to find those places where a level 40 can hunt without pulling<br/>
trains from hell and half the place cons green.  Worst part is that a huge<br/>
portion of the populous in most of these areas were level 45 to 50 trying to<br/>
farm items or fill the xp bar for the next plane raid.  If the PoF, PoH, and<br/>
PoS are supposed to help eliviate the high level dungeon over crowding, then<br/>
they have not accomplished their goal.  Not being a college student and<br/>
having 2 kids, I don&#39;t have the option of getting on at 2 in the afternoon<br/>
and squawting a spot until my group logs on.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t tried the sea clops but at this point I&#39;m giving up.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
to bother with the boat ride just to find that they are camped too!  I&#39;m<br/>
never going to see how much of a hell level 40 is if I can&#39;t find somewhere<br/>
to hunt.  Yeah I know that I can get in any number of pickup groups in any<br/>
of these places since every group loves a bard, but none of them have room<br/>
for 3!  The reason I play this game is because I can play with my wife and<br/>
brother and until now that hasn&#39;t been an issue.  I&#39;ve done every crafted<br/>
and lambent quest twice at minimum and just about every other quest I know<br/>
of involves killing greens or yields something that the three of us have no<br/>
interest in obtaining.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Verant for letting their lack of capacity planning and lack of<br/>
creativity for pushing me away from the game that has addicted me since<br/>
June.  I&#39;m going to try Asheron&#39;s Call.  I here there is no space shortage<br/>
and plenty to kill there... Somehow I don&#39;t see the expansion fixing things<br/>
for me.  Anyone ever seen a bard sold on e-bay before?<br/>

&gt; If its quick exp you want, get a cleric and a druid and a tank<br/>
&gt; and camp the<br/>
&gt; basement/ghost room. Playing 4 hours a night, I went from 35-37<br/>
&gt; in two days<br/>
&gt; there with that group. That&#39;s also when I shelved my Lambent boots for my<br/>
&gt; Dwarven Workboots.<br/>
