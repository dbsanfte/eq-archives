<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533965324"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Maximumeq lists the going rate at around 450 pp.  A<br/>
&gt; bit out of my price range yet.  Seems to me tho, that<br/>
&gt; PROCing weapons should be a bard&#39;s first choice.  We<br/>
&gt; already have a high dex so why not capitalize?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Early bardic life a procing weapon is good.  I&#39;m told that in a bard&#39;s late<br/>
life you don&#39;t want the additional taunt of a proc.  At level 45 I&#39;m duel<br/>
wielding Ykesha&#39;s or a Ykesha and a Kisch.  Every 50th level bard I know<br/>
tells me that what I&#39;m really going to want short of planes weapons is an<br/>
orb or duel EBWs so I can still damage without the taunt.  We&#39;ll see :)</div>
