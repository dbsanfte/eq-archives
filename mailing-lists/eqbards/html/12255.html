<b>Subject:</b> RE: Song Fizzles upon leveling <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051198265">My songs also seems to &quot;fizzle&quot; for me more frequently when my packet loss<br/>
is high.  I believe that the client calls it a &quot;fizzle&quot; when I attempt to<br/>
start a song and the server doesn&#39;t respond in a fixed amount of time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; BTW, both my CHA and DEX are over 100, so I should have a 5% fizzle rate<br/>
&gt; anyway (assuming skill is maxed at previous level). I continued to fight<br/>
&gt; and my singing skill went up quickly and was maxed in just a few fights,<br/>
&gt; then I ran home and bought Verses, came back and am now back to 5%<br/>
&gt; fizzles.<br/>
