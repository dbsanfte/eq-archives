<div id="ygrps-yiv-796452907">Well, I went to Cazic Thule for the first time last<br/>
night at 3/4 of a bubble to go to get to level 20.  I<br/>
went because one of my guildmates wanted me to go with<br/>
him.  We got ourselves bound just inside Ogguk and<br/>
then proceeded to Cazic.  To make a long story short I<br/>
now have a whole bub to go to get to 20 and my body is<br/>
somewhere in the maze.  <br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is...<br/>
<br/>
Where can I buy a wind instrument in Feerrot or Ogguk?<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already died once on my first attempt at a CR due<br/>
to the Camo that I had dropping just as a train went<br/>
by.  I trust my own song more than someone elses<br/>
spell.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
