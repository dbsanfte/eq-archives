<div id="ygrps-yiv-558024435">Just last night I begged from the Pet of a group member I was with between<br/>
fights for roughly an hour and went up 17, 18, 19, 20 then begged for<br/>
another half hour just trying to get to 21 so I could be in the next skill<br/>
&quot;category&quot; with no success so I gave up and logged out for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
I was also practicing instill doubt on every blue monster our group fought<br/>
for over 2 hours the other day with zero, zip, zilch, nada, NO increases<br/>
whatsoever...and after doing this for all this time, early into one fight<br/>
the monster turned around and ran off at top speed only to be killed by a<br/>
guard. &quot;Oops..&quot; I thought, and scrolled back through the message text to see<br/>
that I had kicked the bugger for 3 damage and cast fear on it to cause it to<br/>
do this.  Fortunately everyone else in my group was not wise to what<br/>
happened and after a brief perplexed conversation (to which I remained<br/>
strangely silent) they just dropped it.  At this point I stopped using the<br/>
skill, heh.<br/>
