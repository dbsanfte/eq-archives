<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938216183">A fine steel rapier can be bought from a player for around 7 or 8 pp.  A<br/>
combine rapier, 50pp or so.  A well-balanced rapier, however, costs over<br/>
200pp.  I use a rapier, and shall disagree with Talon, it is a respectable<br/>
weapon!  This is a choice for those with finesse, and the rapier benefits<br/>
greatly from song (a faster rapier is a deadly rapier), but comparing a FS<br/>
Rapier to a Dragoon Dirk?  Well, a Dragoon Dirk is a bit better than a well<br/>
balanced rapier.  But give me even a FS rapier, ANYday over something like a<br/>
Minotaur Axe!  Speed is everything.<br/>
<br/>
Car antenna!?  Bah!  Engarde, varlet!<br/>

&gt;It is inferior to the Dragoon Dirk, and is MUCH more expensive, too. I was<br/>
&gt;given a FS Rapier in trade, which you can buy from the vendor for approx<br/>
&gt;280pp. Well, I tried to sell it for 100pp, and EVERYONE laughed at me.<br/>
