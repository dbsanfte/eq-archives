 </span></blockquote>That is my preferred method usually, but it doesn&#39;t work on the AOF.  You<br/>
can target the AOF while he&#39;s in the bubble, but the /pet attack command<br/>
doesn&#39;t do a thing.  What usually happens is the mage tries to get closer<br/>
thinking it&#39;s a range problem and they end up eating the HT.  Easier, in<br/>
this case, to have the warrior take it. :)<br/>
