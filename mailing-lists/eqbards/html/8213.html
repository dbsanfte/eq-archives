yellow to him.  Mend worked successfully, and he was able to<br/>
win with a bubble of health remaining.  I know it&#39;s level 9<br/>
because I retired him immediately after reaching level 10.<br/>

damage until about level 30.  And I&#39;ve only seen punches for 8<br/>
recently, since level 34 or 35.<br/>

<br/>
A typical melee person at that level is using a fine steel or<br/>
combine weapon (I bought my combine longsword at level 12).<br/>
That is 6/28 vs. 2/35 for punching.  Weapons are nearly four<br/>
times more effective.  Put another way, a non-monk melee<br/>
person will take nearly 4 times as much damage fighting a<br/>
creature h2h compared to fighting an equivalent non-magic mob<br/>
with weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the reason, I don&#39;t think wisps were behind it.<br/>
