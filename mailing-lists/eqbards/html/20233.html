There are three problems that I have with Lullaby now:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Verant stated that the secondary resist rate against evens is supposed <br/>
to be 35%, adjustable downwards by Charisma and instrument.  It&#39;s 70%, and <br/>
isn&#39;t adjustable downwards.<br/>
<br/>
2.  The intended 35% secondary resist rate is still ridiculously high, given<br/>
<br/>
that Enchanter mez has a 5% resist.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Given the opportunity cost of singing Lullaby, e.g.:  1) we can do <br/>
nothing else; 2) we get hit constantly thoughout the fight by the ones that <br/>
wake up, taking a lot of damage; and 3) we can be stunned long enough to <br/>
allow everything to wake up, it wouldn&#39;t overpower Enchanters even if it had<br/>
<br/>
a zero secondary resist at this point.  Comparing the apparent effect <br/>
without considering the fact that:  a) Enchanters can do plenty of <br/>
pre-buffing, and lots of other stuff in the meantime and b) we can&#39;t do <br/>
either, is just dumb analysis on Verant&#39;s part.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to fix this song so it isn&#39;t overly powerful:  reduce the AE <br/>
range, put a minimum resist rate on it (15%, maybe).  Putting a secondary <br/>
resist on that&#39;s so high as to render the song useless against more than <br/>
three MOBs is the wrong way to do it.  Making a mistake and putting a <br/>
secondary resist on that is MUCH higher than even the designers intended, <br/>
and then leaving it in place for 9 months despite repeated complaints is <br/>
inexcusable.<br/>
<br/>
I think their attitude is that, if Bards can get to level 50+ by doing <br/>
without it for nine months, then why bother?  I just wonder why they don&#39;t <br/>
have the same attitude when it comes to buffing Magician&#39;s pets?<br/>

&gt; I do remember comments that it was riduculously powerful back when it did<br/>

&gt; dead and killing off 15-25 mobs one at a time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few weeks after these stories emerged, it was nerfed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, an enchanter can keep multiple mobs under indeffinetly, but it is a<br/>
&gt; situation they have to put effort into to manage. They have to choose an<br/>
&gt; order, they have to deal with targeting, they have to be aware of timing,<br/>
&gt; etc. etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clarity, Aoe Stun, target, mez, target, mez, target, mez, target, mez,<br/>
&gt; meditate, target, mez, all in order, etc. etc. Is not the same thing as<br/>
&gt; hitting one hotkey.<br/>
