<b>Subject:</b> Verant vs Powergamers OT (was Plane of losses) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-302489626">I have read a lot of posts on this topic, mainly on the EQVault boards.<br/>
Here&#39;s my take on it:<br/>
<br/>
1)  I don&#39;t think Verant hates powergamers at all.  First off, let me say I<br/>
think that the term powergamer, which I believe was first used as a<br/>
reference to a type of player in pen and paper RPGs, is actually a misnomer<br/>
in EQ.  There are a lot of EQ players who have made 50th level.  Are they<br/>
all powergamers just because they have made 50th level?  Not necessarily so.<br/>
Some may be true &quot;powergamers&quot;.  Some may be great roleplayers with lots of<br/>
time on their hands.  Most probably fall somewhere in between.  No matter<br/>
which type of player they are, they apparently enjoy playing EQ so much that<br/>
they are willing to spend enough time playing it to get a character to 50th<br/>
level.  Lets also assume that these players, because they spend so much time<br/>
playing EQ, are also the customers most likely to renew their subsciption<br/>
when it runs out.  Strictly from a business perspective, why would Verant do<br/>
anything malicious to punish the customers that spend the most time playing<br/>
their game?  This will only lose them customers and revenue.      <br/>
<br/>
2)  High-level characters don&#39;t have anything to do now.  Verant probably<br/>
spent around two years developing this game.  Within six months of release,<br/>
there are now numerous players who have 40+ level characters.<br/>
Understandably, a lot of these players are getting bored because they don&#39;t<br/>
have a lot of new things to do.  I think it is safe to say that the Verant<br/>
programmers, no matter how smart they are and how hard they work, will never<br/>
be able to keep pace with the powergamers.  If Verant spends one month<br/>
creating a new high level zone, the high level players will have it mastered<br/>
within a couple of days of release.  I think this is something that we just<br/>
have to accept as unavoidable and not worry about.  <br/>
<br/>
As I see it, until the expansion comes out, high level players have four<br/>
options:<br/>
<br/>
	1)  Start a new character<br/>
	2)  Play the same character but do the same stuff over and over<br/>
	3)  Play a different game until the expansion comes out<br/>
	4)  Quit EQ completely<br/>
<br/>
Which option is the correct one to choose is a personal choice.  However,<br/>
IMO, if a 50th level player decides to quit EQ completely because they are<br/>
bored, I don&#39;t think that is Verant&#39;s fault at all.  For the most part,<br/>
Verant delivered what they said they would deliver.  Everyone knew that 50th<br/>
was the highest level available until the expansion comes out.  With that<br/>
said, I do think 50th level characters should have the option to temporarily<br/>
suspend their account, i.e. not pay the monthly fee, until the expansion<br/>
comes out.  When the expansion does arrive, they can reactivate their<br/>
account and still have their original character.  <br/>
<br/>
One last thing,  before EQ came out,  I averaged buying about 10 computer<br/>
games a year.  A lot of them I would not even finish because I got bored<br/>
with them.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since April and I am still having lots of<br/>
fun playing.  As a 22d level bard, I still have alot of things I can look<br/>
forward to doing in the game.  I haven&#39;t even considered buying a new game<br/>
since April.  Couldn&#39;t even tell you the last time I went to Compusa to<br/>
browse.  Always looking on the bright side, playing EQ is saving me about<br/>
$400 a year:-)<br/>

&gt; Heh seems like it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes I agree Verant seems to hate powergamers very much although I doubt<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; the real reasons. Verant seems to believe that the reason most people are<br/>
&gt; leaving the game ( level 50 people that is or close ) is because we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; beaten the game typically for a powergamer. However I know most people<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; got bored with it because there was nothing else to do with their current<br/>
&gt; char or areas like Lower Guk or Sol B are just too crowded. If verant<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; add some more high level areas and fix PoF I seroiously doubt this would<br/>
&gt; continue. On another note almost all the 40+ I know and group with have a<br/>
&gt; secondary char some even have 3-4.  Hopefully Verant will begin to realize<br/>
&gt; problems as more and more people leave.<br/>
