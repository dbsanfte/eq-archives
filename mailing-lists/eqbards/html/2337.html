<div id="ygrps-yiv-834147247">I&#39;m not sure what to do, maybe someone has some advice for me. While sitting <br/>
calmly on the deck of the boat on my way to Faydwer, I suddenly found myself <br/>
sitting on a rock in the middle of OOT surrounded by Sirens and Aqua-goblins <br/>
with the boat nowhere in sight. I have been stuck there for 2 days now. I <br/>
petitioned immediately of course, but there were no GM&#39;s on then. I have <br/>
logged back in morning, afternoon, and evening but only once saw a GM log <br/>
on. They were on less than 5 minutes and logged off again without answering <br/>
my petition. I&#39;ve tried to catch the boat in passing, but don&#39;t stand a <br/>
chance of catching it. I don&#39;t want to abandon my bard, my guild has <br/>
invested too much into helping me catch up with them in levels.<br/>
