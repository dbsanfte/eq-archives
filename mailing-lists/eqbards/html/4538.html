&gt; Who the hell is this Murissa Sandwhisperer person?  I was <br/>
&gt; jaunting back to<br/>
&gt; Freeport after killing some crocs the other day and assumed <br/>
&gt; she was a vendor<br/>
&gt; (like in E. Commons, where they are consistently not in the <br/>
&gt; inns but rather<br/>
&gt; in front of them or on top of them....still haven&#39;t figured <br/>
&gt; that out yet)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She is a vendor.  You must have killed too many dervs, which she does not<br/>
like hehe.<br/>
