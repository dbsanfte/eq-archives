<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207306102">My goodness, what kind of answer is that??  I too was a bard like you who<br/>
cared little about AC and more about stat modifiers and looks.  Now a<br/>
friend who playing a leevel 50 ranger at the time mad mention of how a  <br/>
jump of 10 AC points mad a difference of 1 full bubble of health when<br/>
soloing a Greater Kobold in Sol B I was entrigued.  So that knight I<br/>
started swapping some stat modifiers for some better AC items.  Did I<br/>
notice a difference with 20 more natural AC??? Hell yes.  I may not be a  <br/>
primary tank or even a secondary or even a tertiary tank, however I do<br/>
know that if I am in a group and there is a multi mob pull that I will be<br/>
the one dealing with all the mobs beyond the first one.  So does AC help<br/>
in this situation?? The answer is yes.  What natural AC does for you is it<br/>
reduces the maximal damage that can be inflicted upon you and it also <br/>
reducs the chances of a creature inflicting maximal damage upon you. <br/>
These are good things considering the fact that I have only 827 hitpoints<br/>
at level 36.  That&#39;s like 10-20 melee rounds before I die to a mob.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to consider if you think that AC is not important.  It is<br/>
immensely important for all classes even us non-mainline tanks.<br/>
<br/>
As for the original topic, I think and have always had the feeling that GZ<br/>
has been out of touch with bards.  The only benefit from the singing boots<br/>
that I see is the fact that I don&#39;t ever have to buy food and water.  Sure<br/>
in the long run that will be a wonderful godsend, however losing 3-5 AC<br/>
points on 2-3 pieces of armor is a very big consequence.  I would gladly<br/>
trade most effects, modifiers and procs for a good healthy dose of AC any<br/>
day.  Would I tank with that AC? Heck no, but at least I could take an<br/>
extra hit or two =).  My assumption is that GZ is expecting all bards<br/>
using the Singing steel to be wielding symphonic harmony weapons.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what.  We aren&#39;t main line tanks.  We don&#39;t need ungodly AC like they do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my opinion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; MY GOD...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; a blatant nerf, no two ways about it.  I mean all other class armor has<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell effects, why are we the only class that has less ac then we should?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and summon water spell is going to compensate me for missing 3-4-5 ac per<br/>
&gt; &gt; piece?<br/>
