&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sub 50 ideas:<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s Shooting Star (39th?)<br/>
&gt; Percussion - outdoor only<br/>
&gt; Combination of Selo&#39;s Accelerando, Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding, and<br/>
&gt; Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles + Ultravision.  Party effect, Range: Zone wide.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uhhhh... do you honestly think they&#39;ll allow this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why not? I can weave Selo&#39;s and Aria now. Why not throw in a song that would<br/>
just be plain fun and make group travel much easier?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A new charm song, if not full charm then atleast a charm animal song (make<br/>
&gt; this one 44th or 49th)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Charm animal is utterly useless (and pointless) for a bard.  90% of the<br/>
zones we go to do not have animals high enough to bother with.  Remember<br/>
that our charm is already limited by the fact that we have to re-charm every<br/>
10-15 seconds.  This would be better as our 39th song as well since we<br/>
&quot;lose&quot; our charm at 37.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charm animal useless?  Talk to the druids in Sol B that charm sonic bats all<br/>
night long.....<br/>
Also the expansion is going to have high level outdoor zones.  I am sure<br/>
there will be some 50+ animals to play with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Denon&#39;s Sonic Disruption<br/>
&gt; Target: Single<br/>
&gt; Brass (required)<br/>
&gt; Disrupts all spell casting from target.<br/>
&gt; This could also be interesting as an AE song as well.  If AE having it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stop<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all say/shout traffic into/out of AE (this would be interesting on the PvP<br/>
&gt; servers).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Umm... pixie strike already accomplishes this<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
aye, that&#39;s why I put the addendum in about maybe having it be AE.  But that<br/>
might be a bit overpowered.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 50 plus songs:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Denon&#39;s Dance of Death<br/>
&gt; AE or Single<br/>
&gt; Brass<br/>
&gt; DoT + drain severe stamina drain(at least the equiv of a full bubble) +<br/>
&gt; chance to interrupt any spell casting<br/>
&gt; Dot should be twice as strong as Selo&#39;s Chords of Cessation at the same<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nice!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Niv&#39;s Chrorus of Restoration<br/>
&gt; String Required<br/>
&gt; 2xHymn of Restoration + Fatigue restoral + 1.5xCassindra&#39;s Chorus of<br/>
&gt; Clarity.<br/>
&gt; Fully stacks with Hymn of Restoration, Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Niv&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Melody of Preservation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting but I think this would be far too powerful.  twice hymn + jig +<br/>
clarity?  uhh.... and stackable?<br/>
<br/>
hymn x 2 at 50th would = 35 a tick healing.  Not really that overpowered,<br/>
imo.</div>
