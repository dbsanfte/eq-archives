&quot;Biggest&quot; is a little ambigious with regards to Inny guilds.  Sheer <br/>
number does not make a guild powerful.  From what I know for <br/>
instance, membership in Legions of Darkness is relatively small.  <br/>
However, the guild itself is rather powerful and able to accomplish <br/>
things through organization and tactics that other guilds can barely <br/>
accomplish with sheer number.  They are still probably considered the <br/>
&quot;Biggest&quot; guild on the server based on what they are able to <br/>
accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
Other &quot;big&quot; guilds include:<br/>
Pantheon (Hi Sylly!)<br/>
Storm<br/>
Order of Black Staff (Hi Kenross!)<br/>
Dawn of the Phoneix<br/>
Lords of Eldeo<br/>
Spirit of the Moon<br/>
<br/>
I am sure I left out several.  There is an Asian guild that I am <br/>
drawing a blank on at the moment.  There are also a few guilds that <br/>
do certain events together a lot (again, drawing a blank).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am sure Kenross, Miriana, or Sylly can help fill in some of <br/>
the holes ;)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I am still new to EQ and Innoruuk as a whole so I have to ask...  <br/>
What<br/>
&gt; guilds are considered the biggest?  Because I play during the <br/>
servers<br/>
&gt; off-peak hours (Aussie time) I tend to see a lot of guilds with <br/>
only one or<br/>
&gt; two members in them.  But with about 500 players on at the time <br/>
there&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; much to represent :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I am not asking because I want to be part of a &quot;big&quot; guild but <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; curious.  I don&#39;t want to give anyone the wrong impression :)  <br/>
Besides my<br/>
&gt; little one is already questing to join the guild most suited for <br/>
her - size<br/>
&gt; or not!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Regards,<br/>
