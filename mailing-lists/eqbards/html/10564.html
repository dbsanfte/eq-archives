A character as low as level 33 can get experience grouped with people right up <br/>
to level 50.  Why don&#39;t you join them?  I had a great time the other night <br/>
camping the Savant room in Lower Guk with a bunch of mid-forties.  If I hadn&#39;t <br/>
rushed off to loot a Basalt Carapace and forgotten to get myself re-invised to <br/>
undead after looting (thus creating an amusingly huge train of froggies and <br/>
skeletons), I would have made it through six hours without dying once, and I <br/>
got two bubbles net, anyway.  (I wouldn&#39;t have died at all if the <br/>
bleepity-bleep wizard had kept enough mana for an evac.  He managed to med up  <br/>
just in time to see me croak.)  (Well, I take it back - I died 30 seconds into <br/>
our very first fight.  The Cleric, who is really quite good, told me that he <br/>
had forgotten just how fast Bards can dump Hit Points if four things are <br/>
whacking them.  hehe)<br/>
