<div id="ygrps-yiv-894418345">I was kinda curious about that too.... so many people had told me about the<br/>
&quot;Demon Claw&quot;, when I finally got one, it was called something different. At<br/>
first, I thought maybe it wasn&#39;t the same thing. I checked the stats, tho,<br/>
and it has the same stats as the &quot;Demon Claw&quot; I have seen so many speak of.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is an effort in Verant&#39;s part to remove &quot;Demon&quot;, &quot;Devil&quot;, or any<br/>
other type of &quot;no-no&quot; word from their game. Or perhaps it is just an attempt<br/>
to give a neat weapon a neater name (Smile).<br/>
<br/>
My only wish was that we could use TWO of these, run around like wanna-be<br/>
Wolverine super-heroes. HEHehehehe!<br/>

&gt;Anyone look at their demon claws lately?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i haven&#39;t used mine in a few levels, and i happened to right-click on mine<br/>
&gt;this morning at the bank, and they are now called Bloody Thulian Claws or<br/>
&gt;something (maybe not claws, but definitely Blood Thulian thingies).  dunno<br/>
&gt;if this is old news, but i just noticed it.<br/>
