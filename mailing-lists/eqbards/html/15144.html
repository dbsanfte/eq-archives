<div id="ygrps-yiv-854645633">Theres no great secret to figure out the best time to patch.  Just log<br/>
in (or off) at all different times. Or merely do a /who in oasis...<br/>
<br/>
When I log in when I&#39;m home from work (say 11am EST, about when they<br/>
begin the patch time) There are normally about 800-1000 per server (I<br/>
pretty much ignore my server, Veeshan, since it has the weirdest<br/>
population numbers, 25% more people than any server off peak, average<br/>
during peak).  If I go late into the night (Just one more till I<br/>
level...), and I log off there are less than 500 average.<br/>
<br/>
If I log on when I get home from work (5 EST) there are over 1400 on<br/>
most servers.  In the current patach timing it is often still down at<br/>
this time.  I assume peak time hits sometime around 11pm EST (when most<br/>
east coast players are winding down, but all West coast players are<br/>
going full force).<br/>
<br/>
I think the system of rotating patch time would be ideal, since I dont<br/>
want the over seas players to bite the entire bullet either.<br/>
