We can also get paid to:  find a corpse, run someone to a zone, mezz a<br/>
crowd while people fight, lull a camp, and more.<br/>
<br/>
None of these happen too often.<br/>
<br/>
The basis for this song was that in D&D and most other gaming systems<br/>
the bard has an ability to perform for money.  We don&#39;t have that any<br/>
more than any other class.  (I&#39;ve seen wood elf/ half elf females get<br/>
money for various performances, but I don&#39; think music was the<br/>
entertainment.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any songs we get now will be much help to us in combat. <br/>
Verant seems pretty convinced we are at the right power level in<br/>
combat.  Also they are opposed to to duplicating other classes core<br/>
abilities.  This wouldn&#39;t cross either of those lines.<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
