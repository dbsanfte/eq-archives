 </span></blockquote>I honestly think there are two resist checks going on, kind of<br/>
like how when we Chain something it can resist or not, then it<br/>
immediately has a chance of breaking out.  It think there is<br/>
one extraordinarily difficult resist check to see if you can<br/>
take zero damage from the spell.  Then there is another resist<br/>
check to determine how much damage you take.<br/>
<br/>
Last night while completing the Staff of the Observers quest,<br/>
I ran across a goblin wizard in Butcherblock.  These guys<br/>
killed me way too often when I was level 5-7 so I decided to<br/>
toy around with him a bit.  I used Curtail (L30 song, targeted<br/>
DoT) on him to kill him - no melee.<br/>
<br/>
During the entire fight, he peppered me with spells (they sure<br/>
have got a lot of mana - I&#39;d estimate 20-30 spells).  Most of<br/>
them only took off 4 or 5 points damage, but a couple did<br/>
about 20.  Then on one spell, I saw a &quot;You resist the...&quot;<br/>
message and took no damage.  I had *never* seen that message<br/>
for a DD prior to last night (I don&#39;t remember the name<br/>
offhand but it was a fire-based DD spell).<br/>
<br/>
That it took a level 8ish mob 20+ spells for me (L30) to see<br/>
one complete resist should tell you something about how<br/>
difficult this check is.  I was singing Elemental Rhythms at<br/>
the time with drum equipped, which put my MR in the 80s and FR<br/>
in the 70s.  I wasn&#39;t trying too hard to keep it up though, so<br/>
it may have dropped to my natural 35/25.<br/>
