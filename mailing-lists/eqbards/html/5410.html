<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719323423">Ah... fashion, one of my favorite topics.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been mentioned before but I&#39;ll cover it again.<br/>
Blackened Iron Crown does show up, it looks like a <br/>
banded/chain helm with some parts blackened to <br/>
distinguish it.<br/>
<br/>
I am a human hence chain/banded helms don&#39;t look too<br/>
bad on me, but plate helms look atrocious. Hence I<br/>
swore off any helm that has the plate look. Sigh, that<br/>
meant I won&#39;t ever be wearing a crested helm (which<br/>
is a great helm that is found in Mistmoore). Humans<br/>
also look terrible in leather helms (baskethead if you<br/>
ask me), hence no executioner&#39;s hood for me (although<br/>
it does look cool in the inventory slot) even though<br/>
the stats on that hood is amazing. <br/>
<br/>
That leaves me with two alternatives as far as I know.<br/>
<br/>
1) Fine Silk Turbin - AC 10 and some bonus to Save vs <br/>
Heat. It is dropped by Hatar (a RARE spawn in Oasis). <br/>
Hatar is a Sand Giant but a wussy one. He&#39;s only about<br/>
level 23 but he hits very hard hence tough for melee<br/>
classes and should be quite easy for the casters (isn&#39;t<br/>
that always the case? Sigh) From what I&#39;ve heard he <br/>
drops one of three things everytime you kill him, the<br/>
Fine Silk Turbin being one of them. I&#39;m not sure <br/>
though. I bought mine. Oh, the most important thing,<br/>
the turbin is invisible.<br/>
<br/>
2) Crown of the Froglok King - this one is going to be<br/>
a while before I get it. Off a high level mob in Lower<br/>
Guk supposedly. I&#39;ll let you know more once I actually<br/>
get it (don&#39;t hold your breath waiting for me, I&#39;m only<br/>
level 33, Elyana will probably get hers before I do).<br/>
It is also invisible when worn and has a really cool<br/>
looking graphic for the inventory slots. I belive the<br/>
stats on it are available in EQ&#39;lizer <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq)">http://www.gameznet.com/eq)</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as other pieces go, I&#39;m wearing mostly store<br/>
bought plate for the visible pieces except for the<br/>
bracers (Serpentine, but they look exactly like plate)<br/>
breastplate (Mithril, I think it looks fruity purple<br/>
but I love the Agility bonus so I&#39;ll sacrifice some<br/>
fashion for it) and boots (charred boots. They look <br/>
like black plate boots). And oh yeah, elf hide gloves<br/>
which are invisible when worn. The stat bonuses on <br/>
those gloves are a little too good to give up for mere<br/>
plate.<br/>
<br/>
I do intend to get myself as close as I can to a full<br/>
set of charred armor (black is one of my favorite<br/>
colors). I like a theme look but not rubicite for me,<br/>
thank you. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else has comments on this?<br/>

in the fashion deparment from Verant IMO.]<br/>
