<br/>
Nope, I&#39;m afraid dual wield doesn&#39;t enable you to use a weap and an <br/>
instrument at the same time. I&#39;m level 50 and still haven&#39;t maxed out my <br/>
hand to hand, it&#39;s pretty pathetic. I&#39;m sure other bards have, however.<br/>
<br/>
Song weaving should be done at level 2. At that point you should be weaving <br/>
Chant of Battle with Chords of Dissonance.<br/>
<br/>
At level 12, in a group, you could be weaving Anthem de Arms, Chords of <br/>
Dissonance and Hymn of Restoration (depending on your situation). It&#39;s been <br/>
a long time since I was level 12, however, perhaps someone else has better <br/>
advice as far as song selection. Consider Bellow as bard&#39;s kick. Very <br/>
useful, especially if you&#39;re solo, but if you&#39;re in a group just weigh <br/>
whether the few extra points of damage is more useful than buffing your <br/>
entire party.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the last person to recommend any particular stats and don&#39;t really have <br/>
a strong opinion about &#39;em. I would think that CHA affects your ability to <br/>
Lament creatures. CHA becomes much more important when you gain the ability <br/>
to Pixie Strike or Charm creatures. I&#39;ve valued STR, but only because I&#39;m <br/>
lugging half my house with me due to working on tradeskills of some sort, <br/>
so while not overly important to the usual bard, it&#39;s important to me. :-)<br/>
