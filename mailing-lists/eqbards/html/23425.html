Subject: [eqbards] Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Was wondering if there is any way for a bard to serve as main puller in PoG<br/>
without taking a negative Tunare faction hit? From what I have read, a lot<br/>
of folks are using non-KOS players to serve as scouts in PoG in order to<br/>
lead the puller to the next mob. If there was some way for us to remain<br/>
non-KOS while pulling, think this could be a lot of fun since we could both<br/>
scout and pull. <br/>
I was thinking that one possibility is for an enchanter to cast mem blur on<br/>
the mob as you pulled it back to the camp. Another option would be for the<br/>
bard to camp as soon as he dropped the mob off at the camp. This would work<br/>
assuming you can camp out before the raid members killed the mob. Anyone<br/>
know if these two options will work? Any other options? <br/>
In every major raid I have attended, I almost always end up playing mana<br/>
battery or resist buffer. This is all fine and dandy, but getting to be main<br/>
scout/puller for a major raid sounds like it would be a lot of fun.<br/>
