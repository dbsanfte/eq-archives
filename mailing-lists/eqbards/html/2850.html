<div id="ygrps-yiv-645323789">Actually on the topic of &#39;unique&#39;, I have recently heard a rumor about the<br/>
Flaming Avenger. (REALLY Big, supposedly Paladin only sword.) The rumor I<br/>
caught was that Verant had only put one and only one of these on each<br/>
server. Now, I have never seen this weapon, and don&#39;t know anyone who has<br/>
seen it, so I still don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s 1H Slash or 2H Slash (IMHO, it<br/>
should be 2H). But anyway, just thought I&#39;d pass that little tidbit on....<br/>

&gt; For roleplaying sake there should only be one of each unique monster and<br/>
&gt; weapon.  Once you kill Dvinn or Crush, they should be dead and you get<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; equipment.  They would not come back to life to spawn more equipment for<br/>
&gt; you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bu this is a MMPORPG.  You cannot restrict the monster or item to just one<br/>
&gt; person.  Therefore he spawns again, giving someone else a chance to kill<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Lore Item is a way to restrict people from continuous camping.  The<br/>
idea<br/>
&gt; is that others would then have a chance to kill the monster and get the<br/>
&gt; weapon.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What&#39;s the big deal with people wanting 2 of the same item?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just from a game mechanics point of view, 2 items with differing<br/>
&gt; &gt; delays are better.  They get out of synch, and allow shorter<br/>
&gt; &gt; windows for casters to get a spell off.  Plus, I LIKE the way<br/>
&gt; &gt; different weapon combo&#39;s look. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
