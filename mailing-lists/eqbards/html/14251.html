I&#39;m also surprised they don&#39;t have a way to test things on the test server<br/>
totally separate from what they patch in as an emergency fix.  That tells me<br/>
that the only test server they have is THE test server.  It also suggests<br/>
that the only testing they do is User testing by us.  I seriously do not<br/>
believe they know what a coordinated, organized, methodical testing process<br/>
is, much less that they think they should use one.<br/>
