<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268175725">the only thing i can think of is that they are used for the wizard&#39;s<br/>
runescale cloak quest from the temple of sol ro.  when that quest started<br/>
was when i saw the price jump.  personally, i would go with a cloak of the<br/>
icebear, it is more AC and has HP which never hurts.  not remarkable, and<br/>
arguably not better, but considering it is less expensive you can argue for<br/>
the icebear.  before i got my HBC i did switch out the lizardscale for an<br/>
icebear.  even though only 1 AC my total went up 3 points.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I was all excited about my newbie bard buying a Lizard scale <br/>
&gt; cloak (7AC, +5<br/>
&gt; dex)for about 80pp which Tszaaz had done long ago. I see they <br/>
&gt; are now around<br/>
&gt; 300pp. They USED to be the junk loot for Rubicite campers, <br/>
&gt; are they now the<br/>
&gt; rare drop? *heavy sigh* <br/>
&gt; That is depressing... </span></blockquote></div>
