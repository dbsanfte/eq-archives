<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-919763379">The information I have says that the level 11 song is Cinda&#39;s Charismatic<br/>
Carrillion which is available in the Kelethin branch of the bard&#39;s guild (NO<br/>
pun intended....) The song raises your faction with NPC&#39;s (Great for<br/>
completing all those quests and dealing with merchants!) It is a song that<br/>
uses wind instruments and targets yourself only.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, my guldmistress gave me permission to join the 9th rank. I<br/>
am unable to locate the next song in my guild. Can someone be so kind as to<br/>
point me to a spot to be able to learn Elemental Rhythms?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve checked a couple of decent sources, and they disagree on what the lvl<br/>
&gt; 11 song is.  I think EQVault says it&#39;s one thing, but it&#39;s broken.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Could someone set me straight, please (and if you know where to find it,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;d be great, too :) )?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Secondly, even though it&#39;ll probably be months before I get to lvl 21 (I<br/>
&gt; enjoy my cleric and mage too, but bard most of all), where can I find the<br/>
&gt; higher level songs?  Are there any high level bard web sites?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
