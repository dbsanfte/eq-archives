<div id="ygrps-yiv-601750041">I was the one didn&#39;t understand why enchanters use their DD&#39;s, DOT&#39;s<br/>
RATHER than buffing and debuffing.  I guess i think of the choke line as<br/>
a debuff, not a DOT as the damage on it is rather small.<br/>
<br/>
I usually don&#39;t like telling other people what to do.  If I see<br/>
something really bad, like healers not healing when people are low I<br/>
will say something.  I also always harp on assisting the tank, but<br/>
people never seem to figure that one out.  People do all kind of crazy<br/>
things, &quot;Damage shields are worthless&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t think you need SOW to<br/>
pull.&quot;.  My reaction depends on my mood mostly.  If they want me to pull<br/>
and won&#39;t SOW me (this being my troll warrior, not my self SOWing bard),<br/>
he will just sit there till he gets a SOW or sees a mob withing bow<br/>
range.  He will not move.  You don&#39;t want to give me hp/ac buffs?  Fine,<br/>
but don&#39;t assume I&#39;m going to keep taunting stuff off you.<br/>
<br/>
I really hate getting pick up groups, but fortunatly I have a good<br/>
memory, so I know who to refuse to group with.<br/>
