<div id="ygrps-yiv-315082876">&quot;-Brad McQuaid said they&#39;re going to try changing it so group<br/>
damage is summed, instead of just the person with the highest<br/>
damage getting the kill.  While that means a group of high<br/>
level people camping and farming would be unstoppable, no<br/>
longer would an individual high level person basically nullify<br/>
the value of a zone for several dozen appropriate level folks.<br/>
And if they are camping and won&#39;t let you get in a turn,<br/>
petition it - they are effectively kill stealing from you,<br/>
since you are just trying to get your fair share and they keep<br/>
taking it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Petitioning won&#39;t get you very far in that situation, seeing as how their<br/>
policy is basically that kill stealing doesn&#39;t exist because no one ever<br/>
&quot;owns&quot; a monster.  Whether you agree or not with that doesn&#39;t really matter<br/>
either, because it&#39;s their current policy and unless it changes, you&#39;re just<br/>
out of luck.<br/>
