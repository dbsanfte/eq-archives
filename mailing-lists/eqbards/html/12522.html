<div id="ygrps-yiv-584789016">on another note, someone earlier mentioned possibly using CoD and DDD<br/>
instead of fast weapons, to avoid the damage shield.  if these kill him,<br/>
since theyare a DoT, the mage will lose exp as well.  however if you are<br/>
over level 26 feel free to just fear the pet away.  that is what i did when<br/>
i dueled a level 46 magician.  bad thing is, you can not cast fear anymore<br/>
with a PC targetted.  found that out (even though i know it was on the list,<br/>
i just forgot) when dueling a paladin couple nights ago.  my question is,<br/>
since our fear is AE can you still fear a PC if you sing it near him and<br/>
just do not have him targetted?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just to let you all know, my RL best friend has a 36 Mage and <br/>
&gt; I dueled him<br/>
&gt; once for fun. You can imagine how pissed off I was when I <br/>
&gt; lost exp after<br/>
&gt; the fight. Why? You ask.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, his pet killed me, causing me to die from a NPC, which <br/>
&gt; also is the<br/>
&gt; same as dieing via a normal mob. The duel was void and I lost <br/>
&gt; 1/2 bub exp<br/>
&gt; (this was back at level 29 or so, he was 31). So, I must stress, NEVER<br/>
&gt; fight a mage in a duel because if you die you can kiss <br/>
&gt; goodbye to your exp<br/>
&gt; (if the pet gets the last hit and kills you). </span></blockquote></div>
