<div id="ygrps-yiv-375724267"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No, I was simply setting out to describe what I was seeing, <br/>
&gt; trying to come<br/>
&gt; up with the likely explanation for the lack of RP in EQ <br/>
&gt; (compared to UO). I<br/>
&gt; see interaction mechanics like Guildsay and the whole chatbox <br/>
&gt; interface to<br/>
&gt; be &quot;pressures&quot; on RP, Not that they make it impossible /at <br/>
&gt; all/, just that<br/>
&gt; in a given population of people the mechanics of interaction <br/>
&gt; will tend to<br/>
&gt; result in a certain percentage of people RPing a certain <br/>
&gt; percentage of the<br/>
&gt; time. In UO I believe both those percentages are larger and I <br/>
&gt; am interested<br/>
&gt; in the sociology of it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hrmph, okay what I just described is psychology not sociology, but I am<br/>
thinking about it in terms of populations not individuals. Still, it ain&#39;t<br/>
sociology.<br/>
