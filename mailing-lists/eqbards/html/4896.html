<div id="ygrps-yiv-961870708">The only way that works if you are high enough level to have charm :)   And<br/>
what about the other classes that do not have it?   By the way,   I had a<br/>
gnoll soothsayer root me THEN make his getaway - that was pretty smart in my<br/>
book :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; behind to tear me to pieces.  The first time I saw really good AI is<br/>
&gt; when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; took out my bow at level 7 to hit a gnoll to bring it to me.  Instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; charging though, it did the same thing!  And continued to until I got<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; melee range (where it brought out its long sword and started meleeing).<br/>
&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t think healing in battle is smart AI?  Healing other NPC&#39;s?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Standing back and casting spells until you come in range?    I was in<br/>
&gt; Paw<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, if they were really smart, once you got into melee range<br/>
&gt; they&#39;d root you, run back out of melee range, and nuke you.  <br/>
&gt; But that would put Verant in the position of having to fix the<br/>
&gt; caster/melee imbalance in PvP.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A trick for getting these casters to come within melee range<br/>
&gt; is to charm them, and order them to follow you.  When they get<br/>
&gt; next to you, tell them to sit and wait for charm to wear off.<br/>
