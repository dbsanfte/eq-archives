<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578811928">I have also found unrest to be a great place for exp. The key is finding ppl who  know how to play or who<br/>
listen.  With a good group of lvl 18-19s I can pull from the second floor. I can usually come back with a<br/>
single CG or monk or even a barbed. If I pull 2 we are still ok. If I run into a train and pull a bunch<br/>
more than I expect, I just equip the drum, shout,  and head to the zone. What you need to do is determine<br/>
if you have too much on you and break BEFORE you are in trouble.<br/>
 I might train to zone once an evening, and I die much more rarely.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Gotta agree, get out of Unrest.  I have a 23 bard that is stuck at 23 and 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; bubbles in Unrest.  I have been in Unrest for two weeks now and only gained<br/>
&gt; &gt; half a bubble.  I die at least once a night, usually due to bone-heads in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the group.<br/>

&gt; Hmm.  I spent levels 20-25 in Unrest and gained about 3-4<br/>
&gt; bubbles a night (granted this was long ago, but it was still<br/>
&gt; crowded with about 60-80 people there).  Maybe I was fortunate<br/>
&gt; in not ending up grouped with boneheads.  I never /shouted<br/>
&gt; &quot;bard looking for a group.&quot;  I always found people I knew that<br/>
&gt; were there, and asked if they had room in their groups.<br/>
