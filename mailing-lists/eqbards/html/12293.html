<div id="ygrps-yiv-394999173">You definitely lose less visually at 30 and 35 because the xp needed at<br/>
those levels is higher.  At 36th a full bubble is equal to about a 1/4<br/>
bubble at 35th.  I know that its silly, but its what everyone seems to<br/>
observe.  My druid friend died at 30th 3 times, losing a quarter bub or less<br/>
each time.  1 death at 29 was 3/4 and both deaths at 31 were nearly a full<br/>
bubble as well.  same thing happened at 34-36th though 35th took about 3<br/>
times the number of kills of similar creatures to advance than 36th did.  Go<br/>
figure.<br/>

I&#39;ve been noticing something wierd regarding this as well.  I&#39;ve always been<br/>
told that 31 and above was hell level because this is where you started<br/>
loosing a full bubble with a death instead of a half bubble.  I&#39;m now 35 and<br/>
I died 7 times this past weekend (yeah, REAL bad weekend for me), never once<br/>
loosing more then a quarter bubble (I came out of the weekend with almost<br/>
one bubble into 35 which is slightly less then where I started).  Some of my<br/>
deaths were to high blues and most were to red (the ones in lower Guk). When<br/>
I was 32, I distinctly recall loosing about 3/4 of a bubble on a bad pull.<br/>
I usually don&#39;t pay that much attention to my XP bar unless I&#39;ve just died<br/>
or am about to level (which was the case at 32) so I don&#39;t know how much I<br/>
lost with my deaths at levels 33 and 34.  The other possibility is that they<br/>
have changed the amount of XP loss from a death on one of the recent<br/>
patches?<br/>
<br/>
On another note, does anyone have any advice for pulling in MM or a good<br/>
place to camp?  I was wiped 3 times there last night alone from really bad<br/>
ugly looking trains that seemed to include the WHOLE castle, all of them<br/>
coming out through the graveyard (which I had imagined would be safer).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Prexus has officially grown up I think.  1700 people on it last night<br/>
and I couldn&#39;t find anywhere to hunt in Sol B or in Lower Guk (EVERYTHING<br/>
was camped)... But when I got to MM, there were only about 12 people in the<br/>
zone... now I know why.<br/>

&gt; I made 30th level over the holidays and since then have died twice.  The<br/>
&gt; first time I died was in the assasin room in lower guk.  I got killed by<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; one of the undead ghoul wizards (conned red to me). I noticed that the<br/>
&gt; amount of experience on the bar didn&#39;t visually drop very much.  Second<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; I died I was in Mistmoore.  Party was fighting in the secret room behind<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; crypt when we got a bad pull.  Deathly harbingers and ushers beat me up<br/>
&gt; pretty good.  Started running to the zone when a pledge familiar (caster<br/>
&gt; type) joined in the fight.  Pledge familiars con either low blue or green<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; me.  Even though the deathly harbingers and ushers did 90% of the damage<br/>
&gt; against me, the pledge familiar got in the killing blow.  I noticed that<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; experience bar visually dropped a lot more this death than it did when the<br/>
&gt; red ghoul wizards killed me.  I have noticed a similar trend over the life<br/>
&gt; of my bard as well.  Just paid more attention it to it now that I&#39;m in a<br/>
&gt; hell level.  Subjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; dying is higher when something kills you that cons green/blue to you<br/>
versus<br/>
&gt; something killing you that cons yellow/red.  Anyone else had similar<br/>
&gt; results?<br/>
