<div id="ygrps-yiv-741488664">Yes, I&#39;m still around. The list had gotten pretty quiet and I just hadn&#39;t<br/>
noticed it had started back up again. Suddenly I&#39;m wading thru 36 messages!<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing a couple nights a week, mostly weekends, and the good news<br/>
is I finally got 60 last Sunday night! I&#39;ve only been playing since beta, so<br/>
took me long enough, huh? We&#39;ve spent time exploring Luclin, still have a<br/>
couple zones to check out. Grieg&#39;s End rocks, if you haven&#39;t been there,<br/>
it&#39;s very Different.<br/>
At the risk of repeating a discussion, what&#39;s with Twilight, chains, charm,<br/>
etc being continuous cycle now? Grant you, I&#39;m not complaining but I have a<br/>
hard time believing VI did it on purpose.<br/>
