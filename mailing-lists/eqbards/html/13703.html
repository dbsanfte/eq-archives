<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-259621190">That was my line of thinking as well.  I figured it would have a much better<br/>
chance of getting approved that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I would much rather have a song that had one reliable effect versus two<br/>
unreliable effects.  I seriously doubt we would ever convince GZ to remove<br/>
the second resist chance for pixie so the next best thing is to remove the<br/>
MR debuff.  We&#39;ve got Furfils Curtailing Chant we can use if we want to<br/>
debuff MR.<br/>

&gt; ablility <br/>
&gt; nerfed!  Maybe instead of petitioning we should report it as being <br/>
&gt; overpowered (or even an exploit) that pixie strike lower the MR of the <br/>
&gt; target.  It would get changed in an emergency patch that way.<br/>
