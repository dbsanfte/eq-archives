<b>Subject:</b> Lament interrupting spellcasters (was Newbie questions) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-139501823">I&#39;ve seen it mentioned several times on this list that Lullaby can interrupt<br/>
a spell caster if timed properly.  I don&#39;t recall reading a post where<br/>
someone used Lament to interrupt a caster.  My experience with Lament is<br/>
that once a mob is attacking you, the song has no effect.  I&#39;m hanging out<br/>
in Mistmoore so will try to test Lament in combat against the familiars to<br/>
see what it does.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Question: I just got Pixie strike and was looking forward mostly to its<br/>
&gt; spell interupting ability, which seems to work really well. I being 28th<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; grouped with a 40th bard who was lookign for the mudwater rune. He stated<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; keeps Lucid lull or Lament armed for spell interuption. Thats the question<br/>
&gt; does the target or area lull songs interupt spells extremely well.<br/>
