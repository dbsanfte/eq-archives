<br/>
Last night when we grouped I told you that I thought improvements in alcohol<br/>
tolerance were based on what type of alcohol you were drinking.  After I<br/>
logged off I posted a message on the eqbrewers onelist to try and get an<br/>
answer.  So far haven&#39;t got a response yet but will let you know what I find<br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
My idea is that once you get to a certain alcohol tolerance level, certain<br/>
brews will not help you improve anymore.  I base this on my own experience.<br/>
I trained my alcohol tolerance at the bards guild to 10.  I also brewed<br/>
about 40 bottles of short beer.  Initially, drinking 3-4 beers at a time<br/>
would raise my alcohol tolerance by one.  However, once my alcohol tolerance<br/>
got to around 20, I have noticed drinking short beer now does nothing except<br/>
get me drunk.  Haven&#39;t had an increase in alcohol tolerance in a long time.<br/>
My belief is that I will have to start drinking more expensive drinks such<br/>
as elven wine in order to raise my alcohol tolerance.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, does anyone think that drinking alcohol should affect<br/>
(either positively or negatively) the effects of bards songs?  As it stands<br/>
right now, it mainly improves STR and STA and decreases INT, DEX and AGI.<br/>
The decrease in DEX already has a negative impact on a bards ability to play<br/>
an instrument.  However, IMO it would be nice if your CHR went up while you<br/>
were drunk or duration of songs was increased.  It would definately add a<br/>
twist to roleplaying a bard.  Just a thought...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, here is a good one:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Who can tell me anything about alcohol tolerance?  I drink different kinds<br/>
&gt; and quantities of Alcohol in the game but do not really know how this<br/>
&gt; works<br/>
&gt; to raise your skill in Alcohol Tolerance.  Has anyone been successful at<br/>
&gt; raising this skill and if so, what are the best alcohols to drink to do<br/>
&gt; so,<br/>
&gt; and which ones are not?  I have been drinking primarily mead and not<br/>
&gt; noticing much improvement.<br/>
