<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894638183">Might be a fun poll on the bind spots.  If they opened up OT and FV so that<br/>
the whole zone was bindable instead of just the cities, that would be nice<br/>
for those not liked by the city folks.  I have never attempted to bind<br/>
outside the city in FV as I heard it could not be done - hope my faith in<br/>
other&#39;s info was correct.  I have never tried to bind in OT, even in the<br/>
city.<br/>

PS - It would sure be nice to have a tp to somewhere near Permafrost though.<br/>

Sounds like several of those positive changes are going to be tried out in<br/>
the next patch: (quote from EQVault)<br/>
<br/>
  After a long meeting that started before lunch and ended just now (we did<br/>
break to eat, though), here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to try out short-term:<br/>
<br/>
  1. Increase the grouping experience bonus significantly. It&#39;s currently 2%<br/>
for each group member other than yourself. When it&#39;s finalized and about to<br/>
go live, we will release the actual percentages.<br/>
<br/>
  2. Increase the experience modifier for underutilized Old World and Kunark<br/>
dungeons. We will post the percentage by which these dungeons were increased<br/>
when this data goes live.<br/>
<br/>
  3. Place more bind spots in the Old World and Kunark (we decided to try<br/>
this as opposed to more teleports). These will most likely be placed<br/>
somewhat near to dungeons we consider underutilized.<br/>
<br/>
  Realistically, these changes will probably go live not this patch (hey,<br/>
it&#39;s tonight/tomorrow), but rather the next one.<br/>
<br/>
  More longer term, we are doing to randomize loot, re-path, and even<br/>
totally revamp some Old World dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
  -Brad<br/>
All sound pretty good to me.  Perhaps increasing the xp and putting nearby<br/>
bind spots will encourage people to hit some of those dungeons.  I doubt it<br/>
though as it will still be really hard to get pick up groups in them, people<br/>
are creatures of habit.<br/>
<br/>
Should we have a little pool to see who can guess the most number of new<br/>
bind points?<br/>
