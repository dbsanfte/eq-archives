<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299617671"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;The problem reverts itself straight back to the &quot;I don&#39;t like the way you<br/>
&gt;play so I &gt;am going to complain about you&quot; proselytizing you chartruese<br/>
&gt;dorks do so well.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Piss off, girly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like the way you play, and I don&#39;t like the way you express <br/>
yourself, and it&#39;s not welcome here by anyone that I&#39;ve seen yet (anyone <br/>
that cared to post it anyways).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wouldn&#39;t it be great if people like you had your own color for the name <br/>
floating over your head? I could then immediately tell who to ignore on a <br/>
daily basis, because they weren&#39;t worth my time.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I&#39;d love to go purple, but my guild doesn&#39;t allow it because it <br/>
also makes you anonymous. People like me are your worst nightmare!!! Purple <br/>
but ya never knew! muahahahaha<br/>
