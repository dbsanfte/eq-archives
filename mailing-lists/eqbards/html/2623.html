 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like the way you play, and I don&#39;t like the way you express <br/>
yourself, and it&#39;s not welcome here by anyone that I&#39;ve seen yet (anyone <br/>
that cared to post it anyways).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wouldn&#39;t it be great if people like you had your own color for the name <br/>
floating over your head? I could then immediately tell who to ignore on a <br/>
daily basis, because they weren&#39;t worth my time.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I&#39;d love to go purple, but my guild doesn&#39;t allow it because it <br/>
also makes you anonymous. People like me are your worst nightmare!!! Purple <br/>
but ya never knew! muahahahaha<br/>
