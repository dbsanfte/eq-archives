&gt;supposedly its an evil city for necros and SKs.  you can now start an<br/>
&gt;erudite SK and the character starts in paineel.  its on the test server but<br/>
&gt;not yet optimized or something.  The Hole is the zone on toxxulia that<br/>
&gt;should be a somewhat high-level dungeon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually i understood it to be that paineel is the necromancer city that<br/>
split from erudin due to &quot;differences.&quot; This is the entrance that is<br/>
accessible via tox. As soon as you zone into paineel you see a large pit<br/>
that if you fall into safely drops you back outside in tox for the time<br/>
being. I would wager that when the hole is brought online, that pit IS the<br/>
hole... i remember reading before that the hole sat underneath paineel.</div>
