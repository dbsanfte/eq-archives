<b>Subject:</b> Re: Jig vs Selo fatigue <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982541757">The (warrior, I assume) wanted the Jig&#39;s  fatigue reduction.  In The Official<br/>
Player&#39;s Guide  the description of Selo&#39;s is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Party: Increased movement and fatigue&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming that they mean fatigue reduction by this (the abbreviations are a<br/>
little cryptic).  I have used the fatigue reduction during solos w/ to work on<br/>
peircing/1h blunt skills (I miss a lot, so the fight lasts forever) and see the<br/>
stamina bar go back up.  Has anyone else tried Selo&#39;s for fatigue reduction?<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Kitasi dazed, confused, and up too early<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So does Selo&#39;s, and I&#39;d lay odds that most of us have that one in our 8<br/>
&gt; slots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; heh heh, yeah I have been spreading the &#39;bad&#39; word.  One guy in a group<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; begging for Jig last week and I started telling him how it didn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; &gt; regen mana and so forth when he blurted out.  &quot;Who cares about the mana,<br/>
&gt; &gt; this frikkin&#39; sword is heavy and I keep gettin&#39; tired!&quot;  I laughed myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; right onto the floor.<br/>
