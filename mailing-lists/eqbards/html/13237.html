 </span></blockquote>A while back I posted on this list that it seemed the people playing<br/>
wizards on the newer servers are complete idiots. Now, I have to say, at<br/>
higher levels the idiot wizards are gone, but in their place we have<br/>
idiot mages. Maybe that&#39;s where all the wizards went, I don&#39;t know, but<br/>
I&#39;m seeing a lot of early 40&#39;s mages now on Tribunal who are probably<br/>
just starting to group for the first time in their careers, after<br/>
camping guards for 40 levels, and it is horrible to group with them. <br/>
<br/>
An Enchanter friend of mine was in a group camping the Magi in Lower Guk<br/>
that was so bad she used /q to go linkdead to dump them.<br/>
