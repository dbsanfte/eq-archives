&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem with the range slot is that it is there<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The range weapon is a great slot to put certain things<br/>
that give you stat boosting.  Not sure what all you<br/>
can put there, but I know for sure you can put a<br/>
dragoon dirk in there.  I put it in my range slot<br/>
whenever I use instrument attack.  When I get a better<br/>
weapon I&#39;ll probably go ahead and put the dirk in my<br/>
range slot for good.<br/>

&gt; to use it (throwing knives, shuriken, daggers, Mino<br/>
&gt; Axes!!)...why any bard <br/>
&gt; would want to use it - got me. But it&#39;s there and it<br/>
&gt; will not be changed. <br/>
&gt; Doubt Verant will go to the trouble of altering the<br/>
&gt; interface to include a <br/>
&gt; slot just for us bards. Would be nice though.<br/>
&gt; Personally, I use my range <br/>
&gt; slot to hold a Runed Bone Fork, and I am perfectly<br/>
&gt; happy with it there as it <br/>
&gt; is literally about as good as a fork (Spork?) for<br/>
&gt; melee purposes.<br/>
