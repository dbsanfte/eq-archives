<div id="ygrps-yiv-867120184">Well don&#39;t get my wrong, I&#39;ve spent endless hours helping people retrieve<br/>
their corpses from all kinds of sticky situtations - just not last night.<br/>
<br/>
One time a guy on Fennin Ro was with a group that sumbled into the Cyclops<br/>
camp on the top of the hill near that ogre camp.  He died *at the feet* of the<br/>
cyclopses.  His buddies gave him a few gold pieces and a slap on the back and<br/>
told him he was SOL.  I initially heard him some time after that /shouting<br/>
&quot;Can someone PLEASE help me retrieve my corpse?&quot;  Well I was only level 5 at<br/>
the time and had just gotten Selo&#39;s and a drum, so I /tell him and meet up<br/>
with him.  To make a long (four hour) story short, I ended up Selo&#39;ing up and<br/>
speeding through the cyclops camp.  They followed me around the zone for about<br/>
30 minutes (I was the source of much /shouting)  because my new-found friend<br/>
got frightened and turned-around and lost his bearings.  So I towed the<br/>
Cyclops brothers around the zone while he looked for his corspse without my<br/>
assistance.  He eventually found it and looted it.  By this time I had the<br/>
cyclops brothers and two or three each of bears, lions and wolves on my tail.<br/>
I took them to a nice secluded zone border and zoned out, waited for a couple<br/>
of minutes and then zoned back in.<br/>
<br/>
I was a freakin&#39; HERO to this guy.  To this day he never fails to /tell me<br/>
when he&#39;s online.<br/>

&gt; I can see both sides of the point here.  I usually want to help whenever I<br/>
&gt; can and admit I have even foolishly helped someone get their corpse from the<br/>
&gt; heart of the Ogre Camp.  I didn&#39;t die, but I probably should have.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; many people were amazed who saw this lone bard racing across W Karana with 8<br/>
&gt; or so ogres in tow.  I let them take a rest stop at guard tower number two<br/>
&gt; while I raced on to the zone.  I imagine they made short work of the poor<br/>
&gt; guards there, but hey that&#39;s why they get hazard pay!  Hopefully they paused<br/>
&gt; at tower one or their way as well, &#39;cause after I zoned back in from Q Hills<br/>
&gt; the remains of their angry band were meandering back towards the camp.  Its<br/>
&gt; amazing how easy it is to loot a body in the middle of a now empty ogre<br/>
&gt; camp, no one goes near the place to bother you!<br/>

&gt; &gt; How would others have handled this situation?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Exactly as you did. There&#39;s no bank there to store<br/>
&gt; your items in. There&#39;s absolutely NO reason for you<br/>
&gt; to have put yourself in jeopardy like that. If it<br/>
&gt; was a friend, I would have gone to Qeynos, banked my<br/>
&gt; stuff and came back - but for someone you just know<br/>
&gt; by seeing occasionally, and you were getting ready<br/>
&gt; to log out? &quot;Best wishes..&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Two corpses are worse than one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do others have experiences where players feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; like just because we can located we&#39;re somehow<br/>
&gt; &gt; *obligated* to do so regardless of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; circumstances or dangers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Personally, I wouldn&#39;t even bother to ask someone to<br/>
&gt; help me retrieve my corpse in a horribly dangerous<br/>
&gt; situation like that. When I died in the Ogre camp<br/>
&gt; I asked for help of higher level characters and told<br/>
&gt; them what I needed help with so that they knew before<br/>
&gt; even answering. Even when I found one willing to help,<br/>
&gt; they backed out when he saw just how many Ogre&#39;s were<br/>
&gt; there. I thanked him and let him go. No use making<br/>
&gt; him die too.<br/>
