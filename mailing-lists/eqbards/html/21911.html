<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612966598">My guild only has one 30+ bard, but then we&#39;re *just* getting into planes<br/>
raids and still have to work with another guild to get enough folks<br/>
together for that.  We have no planes-ready bards.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just a quick question. How many bards above 30 are there in your guilds?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gosh. Lets see... well, there&#39;s me and...<br/>
<br/>
Me.  That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
In fact of the 60 people in my guild (Praetoriate on Bertoxxulous), I&#39;m the<br/>
only serious Bard.  We&#39;ve got a level 8 twink, and he only ever comes on<br/>
when his regular hunting partner isn&#39;t on.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel like the proverbial redheaded stepchild, but in time I<br/>
suppose that&#39;ll have its advantages.<br/>
<br/>
I know Windleaf is on Bertoxx, too, but I&#39;ve yet to see him on the /who all<br/>
bard 30 60 list... (are you anon?) Our server has tons and tons of newbie<br/>
Bards, but they all seem to drop off the face of Norrath when they hit 20<br/>
or<br/>
thereabouts.<br/>
<br/>
At peak times, I&#39;ll maybe see 16 post-30 non-anon/rpg Bards.<br/>
