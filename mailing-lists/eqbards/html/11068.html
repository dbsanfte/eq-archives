  L50s powering them.  And I dont mean the occasional assist,<br/>
  they sat around and were given all the exp they wanted.  If<br/>
  I had L50s setting me up with that kinda of exp I&#39;d be 50<br/>
  already.  No real glory in those two accomplishments.  I<br/>
  admire their primary toons, but those twinks are nothing<br/>
  to be much proud of imo.<br/>
