&gt; Months ago I bought the Pugius Dagger to dual wield with my dragoon dirk<br/>
&gt; since the delay was so low and it works vs magic only monsters.  I was a<br/>
&gt; shish-kebob machine doing 10 damage with Pugius and 12 damage with Dragoon<br/>
&gt; Dirk for as much as 22 straight melee damage about every 2.2 seconds.  The<br/>
&gt; Silvery War Axe that fetches 400pp on the PC market has an attack delay of<br/>
&gt; 22 and damage 6 vs the Pugius&#39; delay 21 damage 5 and they weigh the same.<br/>
&gt; The Bladed Thulian Claws have an attack delay of 19 and damage of 5.<br/>
Pugius<br/>
&gt; is an EXCELLENT piercing weapon for Bards in their teens who decide to go<br/>
&gt; with piercing, however, one thing eludes me:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where is this weapon found?!?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; Unrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>
&gt; told they do not exist.  I never see anyone using this weapon, nor do I<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; anyone selling it...is it a limited release artifact now?  Who knows the<br/>
&gt; mysterious secret of the origin of the Pugius Dagger?<br/>
