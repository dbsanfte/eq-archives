<div id="ygrps-yiv-989789407">Got a question for you guys.  Now that I&#39;m level<br/>
32, I&#39;ve on a couple of occasions managed to get<br/>
in pretty decent groups in Mistmoore.  Is there<br/>
any practical way to pull musicians from the<br/>
castle once you have control of, say, the plateau<br/>
in front of the castle?  This is with a mid-30&#39;s<br/>
group.  I have been in a group once that actually<br/>
managed to fight their way into the lobby (with<br/>
the stairs going to second floor, etc.) but then<br/>
we couldn&#39;t figure out how to reasonably go much<br/>
further due to large clusters of mobs at such odd<br/>
angles that lament wasn&#39;t really doable, etc.<br/>
Plus the fact that everyone was scared out of<br/>
their minds because of the stories of bad pathing,<br/>
trains, etc.<br/>
