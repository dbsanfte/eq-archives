<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011174484">I just asked my Guild Leader - a 52 Druid.  The downtime is 8-9 minutes not<br/>
15-20.<br/>
<br/>
We ARE comparing apples to apples.  The issue isn&#39;t &quot;Non-stop&quot; action<br/>
(unless you take the Quake players mentality) but the amount of Experience<br/>
Generated over time with little to no risk.<br/>
<br/>
The Druid is fighting four at a time as opposed to two.  You have to factor<br/>
this into the comparison of bards charming one mob against another.<br/>
<br/>
If a Druid has an Enchanter near by to cast Clarity on him that 8-9 minutes<br/>
goes down even faster (cut in half?  not really sure).  I know first hand<br/>
how quickly a Druid can level quad-kiting - and IMHO it&#39;s equivalent or<br/>
faster than bards did kiting without mana.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all agree that limiting the kiting ability of bards was the<br/>
issue.  The issue is the Rez factor, the fact that our mana regen can&#39;t be<br/>
sped up like others classes are, the conflict with Desperate Dirge, and of<br/>
course - the more general issue of class balance.<br/>
<br/>
Despite every flame you&#39;ve made at anyone who disagrees with you - I find no<br/>
compelling argument you&#39;ve made that bards are equally balanced as the more<br/>
powerful classes in the game (not that Bards are the only underpowered<br/>
class...)<br/>

&gt;One thing I find ridiculous - I believe that a lot of our &quot;nerfs&quot; came<br/>

&gt;mana component of the higher-level charm song for example - came when<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve noticed now more and more Druids doing the &quot;Quad Kiting&quot; tactic - of<br/>
&gt;kiting 4 mobs at once.  Whets unbalanced for a bard is perfectly acceptable<br/>
&gt;for a Druid...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah they get to kill 4 mobs at once.  then they med for 15-20 minutes.<br/>
bards never<br/>
had to do this when charm didn&#39;t have a mana cost.  there was absolutely no<br/>
downtime<br/>
for bards who knew what they were doing when charming.  let&#39;s try to compare<br/>
apples<br/>
to apples here.<br/>
