<div id="ygrps-yiv-340972224"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So....my question is, what armor pieces out there are better then<br/>
&gt;bronze, but might not be as good as lambent (something I can feasably<br/>
&gt;get with my level 21 self).<br/>
&gt;2 +3 str earrings<br/>
&gt;2 +4 str +2wis rings<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d get Jagged Bands here, AC5 each and +3 str<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Silver ruby veil<br/>
&gt;Small bronze: bracer, BP, helm, sleeves, cloak, mantle<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depending on funds available: Skull Shaped Barbute for helm (300pp)<br/>
					Crested Spaulders or BS Mantle<br/>
(150pp, 30pp)<br/>
					Save up for Small Steel BP<br/>
					<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Small steel: greaves, boots<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get Shin Greaves from Lower Guk, generally available for free if you ask as<br/>
they are no drop.  This will let you seel the steel greaves to buy steel<br/>
somewhere else like arms.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bracer of Erollisi Mar<br/>
&gt;Collar of undead protection<br/>
&gt;Elf hide gloves<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say get the Shin gauntlets from Lower Guk here as well.  Also generally<br/>
available for free and near zone line to Upper.  The AC will prolly be worth<br/>
more than the stats.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Thick leather apron<br/>
&gt;Dragoon Dirk in my ranged slot<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those are my suggestions.  It becomes tougher to find things that are as<br/>
good AC-wise as bronze without soaring into the high 100&#39;s of pp.<br/>
