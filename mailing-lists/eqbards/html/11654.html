<div id="ygrps-yiv-800074552">Actually Shada, at L50 you can mass fear away the secondary target, and<br/>
even if it runs away screaming it&#39;s head off for help, everything else<br/>
ignores it because they all con green. ;P<br/>
<br/>
However, (there&#39;s always a however), I know that there are a couple<br/>
spots where the monsters, regardless of level, will aggro to help a<br/>
feared monster. None of those in MM are near the Butler and Maid though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; all my time there was spent at level 50 going after wakazishis (except for<br/>
&gt; the 3 trips, 3 deaths between 30 to 40 which made me avoid the place), and i<br/>
&gt; was with a level 50 druid so i did not solo.  just for the sake of argument<br/>
&gt; though... could you not invis the entire way to the butler&#39;s room?  and once<br/>
&gt; there, charm the gargoyle in the room to attack the butler, then finish off<br/>
&gt; the winner?  i suppose the surrounding rooms and hall spawns would come<br/>
&gt; running, but just a thought.<br/>
