&gt;up to keyboard shortcuts to help with RPing my characters. Just call me the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t get me wrong - it&#39;s nice to be able to drop a song on-the-spot, but<br/>
songscripts would be good for those lengthy performances and songs you<br/>
actually spent time learning.<br/>
<br/>
Just my reasoning.<br/>
