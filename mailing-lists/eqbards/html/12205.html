Mystic Shielding does).  That&#39;s why folks are suggesting them<br/>
as a two-pronged resist approach - Psalm for one resist,<br/>
Guardian for MR.<br/>

fight, when the puller is coming in damaged.  Either the<br/>
puller, the healer, or the bard is going to get nuked by any<br/>
extra casters that come along - before an enchanter or bard<br/>
can do crowd control.<br/>
