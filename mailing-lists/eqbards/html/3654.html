<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570500279">I agree with you on this one...  I started on Xegony the week the game went<br/>
public - and I never begged and don&#39;t recall people begging.  I find it<br/>
quite common.  People begging for cash particularly bug me.  On the other<br/>
hand - I had a level 6 bard (I&#39;m 19) ask me very nicely I had any armor I<br/>
could spare.  I did in fact have some stuff in the bank that I was too lazy<br/>
to try to sell - so I figured, what the hey - I&#39;ll help this guy out...<br/>

&gt; One thing that I find, that I assume is related to twinking,  is low level<br/>
&gt; characters, begging for money or Items.  Probably because their previous<br/>
&gt; character was twinked by some high level char and they didn&#39;t have to work<br/>
&gt; hard to get up in the world.  And then they either moved servers, or<br/>
deleted<br/>
&gt; their previous char and no one has come and thrown 100plat their way.<br/>
&gt; anyone else notice this begging?<br/>
