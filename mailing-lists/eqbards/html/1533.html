&gt;The mana using song (And that&#39;s the one I refered to a while back) was<br/>
&gt;planned on being an AOE Direct Damage song, doing 400 damage to up to four<br/>
&gt;targets.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sweet Bristlebane&#39;s Grandmother, if true, that&#39;s fine fine news!  I had<br/>
visions of staring at a boring spellbook screen, watching a tiny mana bar<br/>
slowly grow so that I could bellow at things for less damage than a kick.  I<br/>
went on test center and a level 14 bard there said, &quot;None of my songs<br/>
require mana, yet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the mana is for -new- nuke-type songs why didn&#39;t they simply say so?  Why<br/>
is Verrant so obtuse?<br/>
