&gt; Hmm, when I tried to create an erudite necro in a hurry just to explore<br/>
&gt; Paineel for a few minutes, it wouldn&#39;t let me proceed until I&#39;d allocated<br/>
&gt; all stat points.  You sure you didn&#39;t allocate those points?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There was for awhile a big problem with people not allocating their points<br/>
and then complaining about it when they realized their mistake 10 or 15<br/>
levels later.  When Verant realized it they changed the character creation<br/>
process to not let you proceed until your points were allocated.  There was<br/>
a time, however, when you could skip that part if you chose to do so.<br/>
