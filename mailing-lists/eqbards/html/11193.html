Rogue to +20th, and also played a Monk, shaman, cleric, warrior and<br/>
paladin eact to at least 10th. I started a Bard because i could never<br/>
find the Druid Guild in Kelethin. I kept finding the Bard guild so i<br/>
said &quot;screw it, at least i can find this place&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
At my last count, my performances as a bard have inspried no lees than<br/>
NINE seperate players to start bards (that i know of). I know of these<br/>
because they either say &quot;WOW, bards can do THAT? I&#39;m going to make one<br/>
now!&quot; or I get &quot;Bardx tells you &quot;hey, this is your old friend warriorx,<br/>
how do i play more than one song at a time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This shows me that Bards ARE powerful (if soloing a Sand Gaint at 33rd<br/>
level didn&#39;t tell me that already). I see no need to complain about our<br/>
class, in fact I tell all the bards I see to keep it quiet. after all,<br/>
who wants a party of 6 bards? Bards make things possible for other<br/>
classes, we don&#39;t generally Kill the mob, we just make it possible for<br/>
others to do it when normally they could not.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, other than our obviously broken songs, my only complaint about<br/>
bards is this: why can&#39;t safe fall cap at 100? we are arguably the only<br/>
class that REALLY needs this skill. I was out pulling sand giants the<br/>
other day and my group would go &quot;hey Uldar got hit! you find a SG?&quot; and<br/>
I&#39;d reply &quot;no, I just ran over a dune&quot;. very anti-climatic.<br/>
