<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-28848408">Don&#39;t fight the webspinners and things in the FV zone.  Not worth the<br/>
trouble.  The are in the 28-35 level range, see invis, cast and deal quite a<br/>
bit of melee, they assist one another and the little Firionia Bixies will<br/>
come in at the last moment and KS you like the guards do.  Heck they agro on<br/>
me at 50 and if I have to fight more than 2 I have to run, but I haven&#39;t<br/>
worked out a method for fighting them because they don&#39;t give me experience.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend following the river that flows down to FV between the legs of<br/>
the giant Iksar statue up into the Lake of Ill Omen.  There&#39;s normally about<br/>
25-40 people in that zone on Druzzil Ro in the 15-30 range fighting all<br/>
kinds of creatures.  On Druzzil you can get pickup groups here.  The Swamp<br/>
of No Hope also adjoins the FV zone, but this is the newbie Iksar zone and<br/>
it&#39;s generally populated with lower level Iksars killing mosquitos and<br/>
leeches and would be much harder to get a pickup group in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I just got to Kunark last night (had to finish some Lambent.<br/>
&gt; Still can&#39;t get a group on the Rathe to<br/>
&gt; do MM for Gloves or the Gypsy lute)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After a terrible time with the boat, I fell off the skiff. Swam<br/>
&gt; to an island, took a boat to the<br/>
&gt; evil outpost and then the fun began.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Got to see several places in Kunark and the graphics are amazing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now to my question..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Suggestions on where to hunt? Fironia Vie seemed to have a lot of<br/>
&gt; black, yellow and red that could<br/>
&gt; be charm fought. Or the Swamp of No hope and Warsilik Woods<br/>
&gt; looked ok as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know frontier Mt.&#39;s is an option but that requires a group I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions will be much appreciated.<br/>
