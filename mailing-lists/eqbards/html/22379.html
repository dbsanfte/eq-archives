<div id="ygrps-yiv-52204167">This doesn&#39;t appear to be a very interesting list.<br/>
<br/>
The cantata is nice, especially if it can be twisted with 32 (which I presume it can), although it means<br/>
that a Bard will have no time to take a break.<br/>
<br/>
The DD is supposed to be a spell interrupt also, which I suppose is good, but it claims to have a 12<br/>
second recast.  And the 3 second cast makes any spell interrupts a crap shoot in any case.  Perhaps the<br/>
8th song against unmezzable, uncharmable MOBs, but I doubt I&#39;d use it.<br/>
<br/>
The group damage shield is pretty wussy.  Assuming that it doesn&#39;t pulse back on every tick (which is they<br/>
way their game engine seems to work), once it&#39;s down it&#39;s down, so we either have to keep singing this one<br/>
song, or it does a piddly 20 points of health for each person who gets hit.  Again, there are better<br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that mana drain is useful in anything but PVP.  If the AE mana drain breaks mez (which I assume it<br/>
does), it better have a very low taunt factor or I&#39;ll never use it.<br/>
<br/>
These are all assumptions based on observations of the way things currently work are are currently<br/>
balanced.  Maybe these will be swell.  We can only hope.<br/>
<br/>
The damage shield is a useful illustration of the problem Verant has balancing this class.  If we assume<br/>
that every member of the party is taking damage constantly, then this song saves 120 points of health per<br/>
tick.  That&#39;s pretty nice.  The problem is that this almost never happens.  I suppose if you had an<br/>
all-melee group with no dispell fighting something that had a damage shield up, this would be nice.<br/>
Otherwise, it&#39;s actual utility is vastly less than its maximum potential.<br/>
