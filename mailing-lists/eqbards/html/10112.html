<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032484979">LOL!  Yup, it&#39;s way different in duels and what not.  At<br/>
level 29 with my Shaman, I could easily beat my warrior friend in duels.<br/>
Now, he challenges me and I immediately run for the zone!  With his crafted<br/>
bonsus and duel wielding... I&#39;m cryin&#39; in no time.  I definitely do better<br/>
than that against mobs.  Or maybe I just suck?  His wizard beat my bard too!<br/>
In general I have to say that one of the most frustrating things about<br/>
leveling is losing a fights against greens... Humiliating.  <br/>
<br/>
		And I did play with a 30-something Bard this weekend... and<br/>
OMG, Bards age very well... she was awesome! Got me into playing Tani again<br/>
:-)<br/>

				I definitely can&#39;t solo a blue in melee<br/>
without using my spells.  A blue<br/>
				ghoul I can narrowly beat weaving Warsong,<br/>
Hymn, and CoD or Bellow.  That&#39;s<br/>
				at level 19 with equipment that&#39;s probably<br/>
far above average for the most<br/>
				part (All magical armor except for bearskin<br/>
boots).  At 17 I was able to<br/>
				solo blues a bit better, but never tried<br/>
without songs.  Since the blue<br/>
				ghoul took me down to 7hp I know I would<br/>
have lost without songs.  Hymn<br/>
				alone gave me about 60hp in the fight.<br/>
Bellow probably did about 70 more<br/>
				points to the ghoul as well.  That&#39;s 130 hp<br/>
difference, which probably<br/>
				exceeds the value of your shaman buffs.  I<br/>
doubt a bard could solo any xp<br/>
				giving greens at 35th without songs.  At<br/>
35th I imagine we are quite a bit<br/>
				better than Shamans at melee (Marr knows I<br/>
hope so!) but I&#39;m not seeing it<br/>
				at 19th.  Of course slam seems to work far<br/>
better on players than it does on<br/>
				mobs.  Our shaman stunned me 9 times in our<br/>
fight last nite.  He often goes<br/>
				thru a nites hunting with only 2 stuns on<br/>
critters.<br/>

						Well my Shaman is 35, and I<br/>
have decent armor for my level<br/>
				nothing special.  I have an observer staff<br/>
and am maxed (I think) for my<br/>
				level in 2H blunt.  And all I have to say is<br/>
that buffed up to the hilt, I<br/>
				can MAYBE solo a blue in melee (not using<br/>
DOT and DD)...but I doubt it.<br/>
				This is strict melee.  Even when I use my<br/>
spells, I still need to kite a<br/>
				little to be comfortable.  My bard is only<br/>
17 and does just fine on a<br/>
				blue... I don&#39;t know how she will be at 35<br/>
yet. <br/>
<br/>
						I guess my point (do I have<br/>
one here?) is that my bard kicks<br/>
				ass in melee compared to my shaman (can&#39;t<br/>
say about other hybrid classes or<br/>
				about other bards or other shaman).  Shaman<br/>
are best at niche filling -<br/>
				turning the tide of battle in our favor,<br/>
whether by buffing, debuffing or a<br/>
				nicely placed heal or DD.  Maybe bards are<br/>
best at that too, with a slight<br/>
				emphasis on getting in there and fighting.<br/>
But if my shaman is taking hits,<br/>
				I crumple just about as fast as a wizard :-)<br/>

<br/>
								You are the<br/>
only person I know who does not<br/>
				know the difference between a<br/>
								fact and an<br/>
opinion. <br/>
<br/>
								Maybe Bards<br/>
eventually become better than<br/>
				Shamans in melee, but not at level<br/>
								17.  Dual<br/>
wield was not sufficient to<br/>
				prevent me from being pummeled due to<br/>
								the numerous<br/>
stuns I received.  All shamans<br/>
				have slam.  Sure it never goes<br/>
								up, but it<br/>
is still sufficient to stun a<br/>
				17th level bard.<br/>
<br/>
								Bards are<br/>
better than all hybrids in magical<br/>
				power?  Under what microscope<br/>
								did you<br/>
determine that?  At lower levels its<br/>
				obviously true as the other<br/>
								hybrids have<br/>
no magical power.  Hmm lets<br/>
				examine them at higher levels.<br/>
								Paladin get<br/>
Greater Heal, 400 hp that&#39;s 3<br/>
				minutes worth of Hymn with a lute<br/>
								and it takes<br/>
them less time than that to<br/>
				meditate back the mana.  They also<br/>
								get Revive<br/>
at their utmost level of spell<br/>
				use.  Not to mention Lay Hands.<br/>
								Rangers<br/>
probably have the weakest line of<br/>
				spells getting nothing above Heal,<br/>
								though they<br/>
do get Wolf Form, cool but not<br/>
				overly powerful.  Shadowknights<br/>
								spells are<br/>
fearsome.  The Engulfing Darkness<br/>
				DoT line is devastating as it<br/>
								destroys our<br/>
best defense, Acellerando and<br/>
				it stacks with their Heat Blood.<br/>
								They also<br/>
now have the lifetap series.  All<br/>
				this aside their Harm Touch<br/>
								alone is a<br/>
devastating if slow to recharge<br/>
				weapon.  We do have a greater<br/>
								number of<br/>
spells than the other hybrids do<br/>
				though.  Are our abilities<br/>
								obviously<br/>
better, I would not say so.<br/>
				Better in a full group of six maybe,<br/>
								better in<br/>
small groups, that&#39;s not apparent.<br/>
				Even if we were better it<br/>
								certainly<br/>
would not be 5-6 times better and<br/>
				that&#39;s how the other hybrids<br/>
								relate to us<br/>
in terms of melee skills.  <br/>
<br/>
								Now since I<br/>
have stated that bards magical<br/>
				abilities might not be so much<br/>
								better than<br/>
some of the other hybrids,<br/>
				rangers excluded as their spells are<br/>
								truly weak,<br/>
feel free to call me a liar.<br/>
				That will just be one more<br/>
								definition<br/>
you will need to look up on<br/>
				Merriam-Webster Online, right after<br/>
								&#39;fact&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
								To further<br/>
turn your argument around: <br/>
								Bards cannot<br/>
beat any caster consistently in<br/>
				pure magical combat. (though<br/>
								I&#39;ve come<br/>
close with Maxell MR)<br/>
								Bards cannot<br/>
beat any other hybrid or melee<br/>
				type consistently in pure melee<br/>
								combat.<br/>
<br/>
								Neither of<br/>
those statements however true<br/>
				prove we are weaker than those<br/>
								classes any<br/>
more than yours prove we are<br/>
				equal in power.  In my opinion, we<br/>
								are weaker<br/>
than several of the other<br/>
				classes.  The weakness is not generally<br/>
								overbearing<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>
				shouldn&#39;t be corrected.  To be honest I<br/>
								think a<br/>
realignment of our skills would<br/>
				suffice to bridge the gap without<br/>
	<br/>
modifications to our spells other than<br/>
				including the missing ones and fixing<br/>
								the broken<br/>
ones.  An added melee skill like<br/>
				Parry which succeeds more often<br/>
								than Dodge,<br/>
and some raised caps on skills<br/>
				that are currently of debatable<br/>
								usefulness<br/>
would help as well.  Most<br/>
				Jack-of-all-trades are seen as<br/>
	<br/>
self-sufficient characters while we are<br/>
				definitely not designed to be very<br/>
								capable on<br/>
our own.  We do best in groups<br/>
				due to the nature of our spells.<br/>
								It is this<br/>
very grouping nature that further<br/>
				undermines the usefulness of<br/>
								our other<br/>
skills as there will often be<br/>
				present others in the group whose<br/>
								skill so far<br/>
overshadows ours in those other<br/>
				areas that we might as well not<br/>
								have the<br/>
skill at all. There is no benefit<br/>
				to having Find Traps and Pick<br/>
								Locks when<br/>
there is a rogue in the group<br/>
				with more than double your skill.<br/>
								If we were<br/>
meant to be characters who could<br/>
				function on their own and do<br/>
								nearly<br/>
everything, if not well, that would<br/>
				be different.  However, we are<br/>
								not.  We are<br/>
meant to group and for every<br/>
				member we add to our group some of<br/>
								our skills<br/>
become superfluous just as our<br/>
				magical powers become more potent.<br/>
