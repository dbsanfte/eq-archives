<div id="ygrps-yiv-897557478">Hi everyone, I&#39;m new to the list so let me introduce myself.<br/>
 <br/>
Danner Bramblethorn, WoodEld Bard, Songweaver, lifetaker, and heartbreaker. Known gigolo and Norrath&#39;s Most Eligible Bachelor. I can be found on the Tarrew Marr server.<br/>
 <br/>
Know, to answer a few questions that you&#39;ve had.<br/>
 <br/>
Ken&#39;s Lubigrious Lament - ONLY found in Kelethin.<br/>
 <br/>
I also am missing the same songs as you all (30, 38, 39, 43-) but am organizing a Bard Information Network on Tarrew Marr and expect to get any and all questions ever asked by a Bard answered through our network. <br/>
 <br/>
As for travel, I am everywhere. I have visited most places in Norrath already and have even found a few places no one yet knows about (sorry, no spoilers ;). I urge you all to GET LOST. Seriously, just go somewhere you have no idea about. It&#39;s pretty much impossible to get stuck or caught anywhere without having forewarning first. That&#39;s what the CON is for. As far as entereing a new area and being worried about what level monsters are within, do a /WHOALL or something to find out information about the players in that zone. If they are all much higher levels than you, you should hightail it out of there. Selo&#39;s Accelerando was not created only for going from Point A to Point B faster than anything save the Gate Spell. It was also created for exploration. NO monster can catch up to even a 7th level Bard wailing on his hand drum. So get out there, explore, find new things. Another thing I have found is that Bard&#39;s are needed EVERYWHERE. I usually make about 10pp a day just from people hiring me to find their body. I have a constant rate for my services: (Any characters who con green to me I serve free of charge. Blue cons - 5gp, White - 8gp, Red - I start off at 1pp and work up depending on how much higher than me they are. This is a pretty fair system. Im not charging newbies, yet the more experienced players are getting a good deal being as they usually have ALOT of cash and loot on their corpses. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, I think that&#39;s about it for now. I look forward to hearing from you all soon.<br/>
