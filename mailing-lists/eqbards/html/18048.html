<div id="ygrps-yiv-915089609">right hand on numberpad.<br/>
<br/>
2, 4, 6, 8 for movement.<br/>
3, 9 for pitching up and down.<br/>
1, 7 for zooming camera.<br/>
5 to center pitch.<br/>
0 for auto attack.<br/>
numlock for auto run.<br/>
(given the information on the use center screen key, I&#39;ll probably make the<br/>
+ on the numberpad do that.)<br/>
<br/>
Trackball instead of mouse and I keep it literally touching the right side<br/>
of my keyboard so I can hit the button with my pinkie to open doors and<br/>
such. I only use the trackball when switching instruments / weapons,<br/>
manipulating inventory and selecting targets while mezzing or charming.<br/>
<br/>
left hand on the keyboard number keys.<br/>
<br/>
F1-F6 party targeting.<br/>
1-6 songs<br/>
e for selecting nearest target.<br/>
d for duck<br/>
r for respond, but I should change it to t.<br/>
<br/>
The one problem I have is that hitting shift plus a number is awkward. (it&#39;s<br/>
a bit of a stretch and hurts after a few hours of playing) so I&#39;m gonna play<br/>
around with asdzxc for songs, f for nearest target and v for duck.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I use 1st person view 90% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I use over the shoulder mode when leading a party with selo&#39;s (to make sure<br/>
everyone is still getting the song, but I can still see which direction I&#39;m<br/>
going)<br/>
<br/>
I use top view occasinally to target in fights with 4 or more mobs.<br/>
<br/>
The other 2 are set up at 2 o&#39;clock and 8 o&#39;clock respectively. I use those<br/>
to see what&#39;s around me if I&#39;m singing AE and I&#39;m worried about other mobs<br/>
joining in.<br/>
