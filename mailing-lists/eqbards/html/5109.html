&gt;If you are limiting yourself to only being on the front line <br/>
&gt;swinging your sword at the creatures face, you are limiting <br/>
&gt;yourself and not helping the party to your full abilities.  <br/>
&gt;It also takes a lot more bravely to face down a horde of ice <br/>
&gt;goblins with nothing more then a lute equiped :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Partied in Najena last night.  Most of my party was bewildered<br/>
as to why I didn&#39;t have my &#39;weapons&#39; equiped during battle.<br/>
I smiled and told them I did have my weapon equiped and held<br/>
up my lute and battle drums.<br/>

You feel an aura of elemental protection surrounding you.<br/>
You feel a burst of strength throughout your body.<br/>
Your wounds begin to heal.<br/>
