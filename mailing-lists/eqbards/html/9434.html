<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805611912">I heard last night from a level 50 Warrior who had just managed to score<br/>
his second Ykesha that Ykeshas will no longer be a MOB drop after the<br/>
next patch, since there is an equally impressive Warrior-only Scimitar<br/>
on the test server.  Has anyone heard this also?  Does this imply that<br/>
there will now be an equally impressive Bard-only weapon available, or<br/>
do we just get hosed again?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I got roped into a GM event early this AM celebrating the opening<br/>
of the Plane of Hate.  At some point in the late evening/early morning,<br/>
the event spanned from East Commons over to East Karanas.   Pretty fun.<br/>
I got to loot a nice no-drop Bard-usable weapon when a level 50 Ranger<br/>
in my guild killed one of the event spawn:<br/>
<br/>
Tainted Tier&#39;Dal Rapier  Magic  19 delay  5 damage  +2 dex  +5 agi  -5<br/>
save disease  no-drop  and (i think) weight 4.5  Pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after picking this up, I was running back to the High Keep<br/>
pass entrance from the woods and figured I&#39;d take a whack at the<br/>
solitary MOB in front of me and tow him back to the crowd of seventy at<br/>
the pass.  Killed me with three spells.  Gack.<br/>
