<b>Subject:</b> Velious faction imbalance (was Avoiding faction hits in PoG when  pulling) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-441745720">On a related note since we were talking about risk/reward in Velious:<br/>
<br/>
I think the entire Velious faction/loot setup is all out of balance.  Seems<br/>
to me that allying with the giants is far and away the best choice.  The<br/>
giants give the most quests (not counting class armor quests which all three<br/>
factions have) and you have more places to hunt since you don&#39;t have to<br/>
worry about screwing up Coldain/dragon faction.  The Coldain don&#39;t appear to<br/>
give any decent quests other than the Garadain series and the Phenocryst<br/>
Focus series (BTW I really like how those quest series are set up. Wish<br/>
there were a lot more like them in the game).  If you want to maintain<br/>
dragon faction, your limited in the places you can go beyond Kael Drakkal.<br/>
Dragons appear to be the worst faction to ally with.  Seems like all the<br/>
best items/hardest zones in Velious will ruin dragon faction.  So if you<br/>
ally with them, you are really limiting your options on places you can hunt.<br/>
Not really certain how good the quests are that you can get from the<br/>
dragons.<br/>
<br/>
Would like to hear from those of you who have explored a lot of Velious to<br/>
see what you think. <br/>

<br/>
What I dont understand is: why is our loot dropping there?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are quests that offer very similar rewards but have you tried to<br/>
get them? PoG drops the items, Giants simply do not drop the items (needed<br/>
for questing) at a rate anywhere close to PoG *and* some gems are still not<br/>
found yet.  <br/>
<br/>
I would guess that Verant made a mistake in PoG - I am guessing that they<br/>
thought it would be uber-hard - or at least as hard as the &quot;other ways&quot; to<br/>
get the similar items.<br/>
<br/>
They continue to fail to understand what motivates the players.  On top of<br/>
that, they do not structure the &quot;reward system&quot; to support the &quot;content&quot;<br/>
(role play, history, lore, etc) or background story.  In some ways, it is<br/>
interesting that players can &quot;choose&quot; who to side with but it is a joke for<br/>
them to ignore the fact that the majority of players will follow the course<br/>
of least resistence toward the path of the most loot. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
True.  Of course the simpliest way to avoid faction hits in PoG is to NOT<br/>
HUNT THERE :)  As Rokenn follows Tunare he certainly will not be, and shame<br/>
on you wood elves that go there to kill your godess&#39; creations.  What are<br/>
you Teir&#39;dal or something? haha<br/>
<br/>
My monk on the other hand is only 2 levels a way from smackin around<br/>
Tunare&#39;s creations, hehe. Must get a silver moon bracer.<br/>
