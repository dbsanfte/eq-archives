<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037669879">What I&#39;ve found in these hotkey macro things, is that ANY time you have <br/>
multiple commands going off, you need to insert a pause before EACH line in <br/>
the macro.  I guess the EQ engine just can&#39;t handle too many commands going <br/>
off at once.<br/>
<br/>
So, that being said, try inserting a    /pause 1,    before each line of <br/>
your hotkey.  You might have to play with the pause amount.  1 might be <br/>
enough of a pause, but sometimes a value of 2 or even 3 is needed.<br/>
<br/>
Also, any time you have a spell being cast or a song being sung as a part of <br/>
the macro, you will need to put an appropriate pause in the BEGINNING of the <br/>
line that casts/sings.  Basically the pause amount is the casting time of <br/>
the spell or song multiplied by 10.  You may need to add 1-5 more in if you <br/>
have problems.<br/>
<br/>
For example, all bard songs have a casting time of 3 seconds.  So you should <br/>
put a /pause 30, or maybe 33 in front of any song you want to sing in a <br/>
macro.<br/>
<br/>
With that being said, I&#39;ll use Maravana&#39;s macro as an example...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;/assist Fred<br/>
&gt;/pet attack<br/>
&gt;/say Pet is attacking %T<br/>
&gt;/pet target<br/>
&gt;/attack off<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With pauses it will be:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 2, /assist Fred<br/>
/pause 2, /pet back off<br/>
/pause 2, /say Pet is attacking %T<br/>
/pause 2, /pet target<br/>
/pause 2, /attack off<br/>
<br/>
with a song being sung, a line would look something like this:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 32, /cast 1    (ie. sing the song in the first spell icon slot)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ONE BIG CAVEAT WITH MACROS<br/>
<br/>
You may already be aware of this, but keep in mind that you probably will <br/>
not be able to sing any songs manually or say anything at all while the <br/>
macro is executing.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The only times I have trouble getting my pet to attack (with the 39<br/>
&gt; &gt; song) is if the command comes too close to a previous /pet command or<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m too far away from him to hear the message.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Darkfox Reven&#39;tsol<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also have trouble with too many commands in one hot key.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I want to do is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/assist Fred<br/>
&gt;/pet attack<br/>
&gt;/say Pet is attacking %T<br/>
&gt;/pet target<br/>
&gt;/attack off<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But it rarely works.  In this case, what seems to get missed is the assist <br/>
&gt;portion.  It seems like there is a resolution time for assist and it hasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;been resolved before the /pet attack, so my pet tells me &#39;that is not a <br/>
&gt;legal target master&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am trying to choose between separate Assist key (which I always have <br/>
&gt;anyway) or trying to add a pause in there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other thoughts?<br/>
