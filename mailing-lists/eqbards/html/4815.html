<div id="ygrps-yiv-269763954">I agree that it is most likely a bug but mentioned the possibility of it<br/>
being a feature just in case.  <br/>
<br/>
One other thing I forgot to mention is that I have only noticed this bug<br/>
when singing Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord.  When I sing the Lullaby or Largo&#39;s<br/>
Melodic Binding in Unrest, they only seem to affect the creatures nearby and<br/>
fortunately not the hag in the basement.  Is this because the area of effect<br/>
for these two songs is smaller than Denon&#39;s and thus not reaching the hag?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Before we submit a petition, I think we should also consider the<br/>
&gt; possibility<br/>
&gt; &gt; that this is not even a bug.  I say that because it is within the realms<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; possibility that Verant intended for our songs to work this way.  Sound<br/>
&gt; does<br/>
&gt; &gt; carry so its possible that even though we can&#39;t see the monsters, they<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; certainly hear our songs through the walls.  Something to consider. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that&#39;s the case, why do we need visual sight of a mob to target them<br/>
&gt; with bellow and chains? As they are sound, line of sight should be<br/>
&gt; irrelevant, no? Anyway, I would say this is a bug, or more likely a<br/>
&gt; design flaw. The recent discussion on the charismatic carillon shows<br/>
&gt; that there are other problems with the z axis that they haven&#39;t fixed<br/>
&gt; either.<br/>
