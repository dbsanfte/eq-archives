<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791578785">actually you&#39;re right, the hall is echoing alot of whining lately more and<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
The fix this and fix that threads are becoming a wee bit too heavy.  I<br/>
personnally just want to be left in peace. I&#39;ve grown accustomed to playing<br/>
without songs that are broken/not working well.  If they fix em fine, if<br/>
they dont fine as well.  Feel like the info request threads are being thrown<br/>
off first page so fast because of &quot;balancing&quot; threads.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, on another note, all you old bards out there, I was in beta 3-4,<br/>
Minkin&#39;s creation date is april 99 and still isnt 50 (nearing though) with<br/>
about 40 days played.  So I&#39;ve seen all the nerfs and all the crap.  Hell<br/>
when i got around level 35 got so sick of hell level i made a necro and got<br/>
it to 50 in 17 days.  Eventually, they lowered bard hate, fixed a few things<br/>
and nerfed a few others.  All in all, big deal, the class is better off then<br/>
it used to be by a landslide and it kind of saddens me to see there are some<br/>
out there that badly represent the class, but that doesnt mean they&#39;re the<br/>
general population. <br/>
<br/>
A whiny clueless voice is more probable to get your ears attention then a<br/>
soothing whisper of wisdom and sadly, that is what happens on message<br/>
boards.   Go to any board and start 2 threads, one stating that &quot;such and<br/>
such is great&quot; and another stating &quot;such and such sucks&quot; and i guarantee you<br/>
that the second one grows to monster proportions.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Chances are the bard is one of the above examples instead, and won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;be very helpful in the group.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find any of those Bards here.  I&#39;m of the opinion that<br/>
this list is one of the last bastions of the serious Bard on the net.  Even<br/>
the Concert Hall is slipping into the depths of whinedom.<br/>
<br/>
All of us here know the differences between a good and bad Bard.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mean to sound uncaring of your predicament, but you&#39;re preaching to the<br/>
converted.  Your attitude to Bards is typical of many people who have<br/>
suffered at the hands of a few bad apples.  Since you&#39;ve already gotten to<br/>
level 50 yourself, why not invite one of those Bards you so frequently pass<br/>
up and offer to teach them a few tricks of the trade?  No-one likes to be<br/>
told that they&#39;re doing wrong, but if you offer ways to improve their<br/>
techniques, making the group more efficient, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a much<br/>
better time of it.<br/>
