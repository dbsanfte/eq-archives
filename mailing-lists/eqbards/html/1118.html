<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-307604241">There are a series of books from the 80s I believe called Bard, Bard II and<br/>
Bard III.  I believe the name of the author was David Taylor, but I have to<br/>
warn you, I&#39;m pulling the name from the deep recesses of my brain here, so<br/>
accuracy is not guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
As I recall, I quite liked the first book, and thought the other two were so<br/>
so to okay.  Keep in mind also that I was in high school at the time. :)<br/>
<br/>
The stories were about a bard in the classic sense, who travelled around and<br/>
got in adventures.  Pretty typical fantasy stuff.  I still see the books in<br/>
used book stores and the like, so I imagine you could find it if you looked.<br/>

&gt; Hi fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if any of you got any good suggestions for books<br/>
&gt; about Bards that would be Everquest like? And some books about<br/>
&gt; Everquest in general too would be fun to read. I never read a Fantasy<br/>
&gt; book or played a fantasy game (but tons of sci-fi), so I&#39;m new with this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; genre I would like to start with light stuff not too complicated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
&gt; The invisible Bard of the E&#39;ci dimension.<br/>
