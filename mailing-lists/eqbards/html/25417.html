Yes, Cobalt Scars otters are on a stand alone faction. Everyone starts out<br/>
indifferent and moves from there. I don&#39;t know of anyway to improve faction<br/>
with them. My warrior is KOS to them and has kill hundreds of them, but I<br/>
use my brother&#39;s Enchanter and I keep him from going KOS so I can use the<br/>
Otter merchant there on the beach. <br/>
<br/>
The experience is average to above average. Loot is average. These beach<br/>
dogs as I call them drop Crustacean Shell Armor. Bards would not want to use<br/>
this armor. Every piece of Crustacean Shell has  + Stamina and - Charisma.<br/>
Each piece can sell for 500 - 2k. A lot of twinks like to use this armor for<br/>
the big Stamina boost. We also get a fair share of quest gems and spells<br/>
from these beach dogs. As you stated Rebecca, the main reason my friend I<br/>
hunt them is for their skins to help boost the Tailoring skill above 158. I<br/>
know on one 5 hour hunt there, my 5 member group made 350 platinum each by<br/>
selling the junk gems and weapons, plus we each walked away with a couple<br/>
quest gems each, 1-2 spells each and 2-3 pieces of Crustacean Shell Armor (<br/>
see stats below ) and a stack or 2 of skins.<br/>

Fun little armor to use if you wanted a little Paladin or Shadow Knight<br/>
twink. If you had all 9 pieces, stats would be:<br/>
<br/>
AC 109<br/>
Stamina 83<br/>
Strength 45<br/>
Dexterity -10<br/>
Charisma -48<br/>
<br/>
A level 60 can pull singles, there are 2 different camps down on the beach<br/>
and one boss beach dog, the Chef. I have killed him twice. He is level 60<br/>
and a total waste of time. Both times he dropped a cheesy 16 damage 46 delay<br/>
spear. I don&#39;t think he is supposed to be killed.<br/>
<br/>
The one major draw back to killing these otters is if you do any trade skill<br/>
baking, 1 of the 2 merchants down on the beach sells cooking supplies (otter<br/>
milk, spices, garnish, oyster sauces, seaweed vinegar, plankton frosting ).<br/>
These cooking supplies are needed for some of the better stat food items and<br/>
some of the higher trivial skill levels. So, now my master cook warrior<br/>
relays on using my brother&#39;s enchanter to go his supplies from Bloogy<br/>
Shellcracker (otterman vendor). <br/>
<br/>
Sorry this was so long, but I am very bored here at work, and it is Friday -<br/>
I am ready to go home and play EQ :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rebecca Small said  &quot;Anyone know anything about killing the CS otters? Are<br/>
they on any faction<br/>
with dragons, giants, or dwarves? I need something to tailor above 158.&quot;<br/>
