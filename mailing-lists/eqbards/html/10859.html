&gt; Talk about tedious...I realize people&#39;s mileage may vary in respect to the<br/>
&gt; story I am about to tell, but...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At level 35 I finally decided to go for the guise of the deceiver and I<br/>
&gt; hit<br/>
&gt; lower guk for the first time in my career this past weekend.  On Sunday I<br/>
&gt; explored and got familiar with the undead area between the zone and the<br/>
&gt; assassin room.  On Monday I called out to be put on the mask list at 10am<br/>
&gt; CST.  I got into the assassin group by 5pm CST and finally looted the mask<br/>
&gt; at 10:30pm CST.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The whole time I was there, a friend from my guild was waiting for the<br/>
&gt; TBB.<br/>
&gt; He had been there for 24 hours straight and did not see one single pop of<br/>
&gt; the ghoul supplier...he finally gave up and logged out due to exhaustion.<br/>
&gt; Now that&#39;s an absurdly tedious camp, and I thought I was losing my mind<br/>
&gt; after 5 hours in that blasted assassin/supplier room.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For 5 of the hours we camped that room I was the group leader and it was<br/>
&gt; extremely hard because when you put 6 people in that tiny little room for<br/>
&gt; that long they start to get irritated and tempers start to flare...we had<br/>
&gt; more arguments over stupid inane stuff, mostly how to go about doing the<br/>
&gt; looting of the alleged TBB shout the elusive supplier spawn (I still have<br/>
&gt; not seen this supplier to date) that I never ever ever want to be in that<br/>
&gt; room again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But hey, I got my mask and only died twice for my efforts...heh.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m also a late bloomer bard obtaining my lambent armor and I can identify<br/>
&gt; with Crier in his woes.  I just got my first piece, the breastplate, on<br/>
&gt; Saturday night and before that I kept getting tells from strangers, &quot;why<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t you have any lambent armor yet?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because I&#39;m not a twink!  I have earned every single item I have the hard<br/>
&gt; way and Faras is not only my first character in EQ, he is my only<br/>
&gt; character<br/>
&gt; and I have over 35 days played too...I am level 35 with one piece of<br/>
&gt; lambent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hang in there Crier, don&#39;t pay attention to those that take the &quot;easy<br/>
&gt; path&quot;<br/>
&gt; because really, they are only hurting themselves.  Play the game you want<br/>
&gt; and enjoy it as long as can.  Solidarity!<br/>

&gt; &gt; There is obviously someone at Verant that needs the difference between<br/>
