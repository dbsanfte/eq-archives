<div id="ygrps-yiv-733508704">Wow.... That&#39;s surprising. I&#39;m merely a level 5 bard, who has just learned<br/>
Selo and how to play the drums. I know that it makes a change to the effect.<br/>
(As well as chant of battle if I remember...) I have learned to greatly<br/>
appreciate Selo and my little hand drum, as I used it to run from a pair of<br/>
orc raiders that jumped me last night. It seems that the drum is not<br/>
necessary to run from mummies though (hehe...) I ran and ran and ran to the<br/>
guard. I stopped, turned around, and could just barely see the mummy heading<br/>
my way. Needless to say, the mummy did not get me. Sadly, though, Selo was<br/>
not enough speed to run from a Shadow Wolf. Which poses a question...As you<br/>
get better at Percussion, do you get faster? Does the same apply to singing?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a level 12 Bard, and I&#39;m quite happy. I know what my songs do, have<br/>
&gt; 1 piece of banded, just learnt bellows and have 12 plat saved in the<br/>
&gt; bank. I think I&#39;m doing ok. Last night I died in freeport and was in<br/>
&gt; faydark asking if any bard could spare a drum for me to use. A level 18<br/>
&gt; bard, asked me what I used the drum for...I was a bit confused, but<br/>
&gt; thinking this was some test, I responded to run faster with selo&#39;s. She<br/>
&gt; then proceeded to argue with me that the drum did nothing to help you<br/>
&gt; and that Selo&#39;s was a singing song. After 5 minutes of that she tried<br/>
&gt; it, and said &quot;oh wow, you&#39;re right&quot;. I&#39;m just curious, have other people<br/>
&gt; met bards like this? I thought from personal experience and reading this<br/>
&gt; list that we have some of the most inteligent people, but now I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; begining to wonder.<br/>
