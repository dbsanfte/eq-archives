&gt; First let me say, I am 30th, and I hunt in CT also. I was in a group<br/>
&gt; just yesterday, and I was twisting Psalm, Hymn with lute, and Anthem,<br/>
&gt; Chaining the runners, with occasional charms and pixie strikes, and one<br/>
&gt; instance of screech when things turned bad. I never equiped my weapons.<br/>

<br/>
I have SHOT from 30th to 34th in CT.  Each time I level I get tells saying<br/>
&quot;OMG, congratulations on your new level!  How the hell do you do it?&quot;  And I<br/>
keep telling them:  Get to Cazic-Thule.  Learn the place.  Make some friends<br/>
that are a couple of levels higher than you that you see in there a lot<br/>
&#39;cause they probably leveled there several times and know the place well.<br/>
Stay there even when the place is rough on you initially (and it will be).<br/>
Pick up all the fine steel weapons you can carry.  Maybe get a couple-three<br/>
lizzie cloaks and mantles.<br/>
<br/>
Cazic-Thule has a different feel to it from all the other places that you<br/>
may have fought.  This seems to turn some people off.  They get in there,<br/>
find out that it&#39;s &quot;different&quot; from fighting Aviaks or Goblins (i.e. die a<br/>
couple of times) and so they go back to doing what they are experienced<br/>
with.  There is NO WAY that you can make decent experience at the Aviak<br/>
Village on Fennin Ro unless you just *happen* to get lucky and get into the<br/>
penthouse group.  Every Av that spawns at the village is jumped in 2 seconds<br/>
flat, so you have a group of 4-6 people running around like mad just to find<br/>
the occassional blue.  Even in the penthouse group you&#39;re not going to do<br/>
anywhere nearly as well as in a decent group in Cazic-Thule.  The Avs are<br/>
just uber-camped.<br/>
<br/>
It is not uncommon for me to leave Cazic-Thule with my Evil Eye Bag filled<br/>
to overflowing with FS weapons.  I run to either the gypsy camp in Rathe<br/>
Mts. where they&#39;re indifferent to me, or the bard guild in FP if I&#39;m going<br/>
there anyhow and sell &#39;em all for 60pp-ish.  If you couple that with the<br/>
1-4pp cash drops I occassionally push 80pp there for a good 4-6 hour<br/>
session, PLUS the exp. is awesome.  At 34th, the exp. has started to slow<br/>
down a bit per-lizzie, but if you get in the Archon group you have an<br/>
ENDLESS supply of lizards to pull from.  With a balanced group, my clarity,<br/>
maybe an enchanter, we&#39;re basically fighting lizzies non-stop.  This REALLY<br/>
keeps the orange bar moving.  There&#39;s usually a Rogue or two in the group<br/>
camping the Archon for the rare Ravenscale, so you can be quite sure the<br/>
lizzies won&#39;t be too concerned about you, as there&#39;s no greater taunt in the<br/>
game than a couple of good solid backstabs.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I cook - I actually carry a spit around with me.  For a female<br/>
half-elf bard this is really in character, plus it&#39;s a ton of fun.  My<br/>
cooking skill has gotten up to where I can make cookies, so I try to carry<br/>
around cookies and milk and pass them out to folks that I like.  While this<br/>
is VERY entertaining, it also provides you and your group with an endless<br/>
supply of Lizard-On-A-Stick, Beer Braised Gator, and Pickled Lizard.  My<br/>
usual group members in Cazic-Thule now just say &quot;Hey Crier, rattle them pots<br/>
and pans for me, I&#39;m low on food.&quot;  I normally buy my cooking supplies in<br/>
East Commonlands at one of the bldgs adjacent to the first Inn, however, if<br/>
I run out of Sauces or Spices while in Cazic-Thule I run up to the Oggok<br/>
gate in Feerrott and buy from Bup the vendor outside.  Bup is indifferent to<br/>
me, and was green the first time I ever conned him at 31st or 32nd.  The<br/>
only risk here is the wandering Bouncer, but I have yet to see one near this<br/>
vendor.  He doesn&#39;t sell food, but he does sell milk if you get thirsty.<br/>
Otherwise the nearest &quot;good&quot; vendor is over in Rathe Mts. at the Inn or<br/>
Gypsy camp.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot more to know about Cazic-Thule, but I really want to recommend<br/>
it to all the bards around 27th on up to around 36th.  It&#39;s great money,<br/>
great experience and great items (Lizard Scale Cloak, Lizard Scale Mantle,<br/>
Bladed Thulian Claws, Lizardskin Tribal Mask, etc.)<br/>
