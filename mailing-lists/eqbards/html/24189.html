<div id="ygrps-yiv-56789884"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Pretty cool encounter...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nice story, i had a similar situation in Dragon Necropolis the other day.  i<br/>
was just following a group along before a Kland/Zland raid when things got<br/>
real hairy for about 30 straight minutes.  those dragon constructs just look<br/>
to big to mes hehe.<br/>

&gt; to 183 cha) made<br/>
&gt; all the difference...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how would you really know unless you were in the same situation with say,<br/>
135 CHA?  i&#39;ve never really seen or heard of any indication that super high<br/>
cha has a significant effect on our mind-type songs.  other than reports<br/>
like this, based on what you think is happening rather than concrete logs,<br/>
or like when a monk i was grouped with said that his 60 bard friend with 200<br/>
CHA had more resists on charm/mes than i did at 58 with 135 CHA.  i don&#39;t<br/>
even have a set of CHA gear like many bards.  with my normal gear, which is<br/>
max HP+AC, i have 138CHA and never have problems.<br/>
