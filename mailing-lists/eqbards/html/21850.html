&gt; &gt; &gt;Yes it can be done. Is the group as effective without an enchanter? Not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;by a long shot. Why should one class have the monopoly on bringing that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;kind of effectiveness to the group?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; is a group with a druid or shaman as healer as effective as one without a cleric?<br/>

i don&#39;t understand how that would prove that an enchanter is a waste of <br/>
a spot pre 50.  if you have a good feign puller, you will never have more<br/>
than one mob.  if you have a good bard, you can deal with pulls of 3.  we<br/>
broke into the efreeti lord room multiple times when we were around level<br/>
50 with no enchanter.  i would bet that if you had an enchanter but no cleric<br/>
it would take much longer because a) no complete heal, b) no superior heal<br/>
even, c)unless the druid healer is 49, not nearly as good buffs.<br/>
