<div id="ygrps-yiv-295791427">I think the reason there is unfinished horns is the same reason why there<br/>
are lute strings. as you may know there has been rumors that there is a<br/>
skill we will get eventually if they ever get it working that allows us to<br/>
create instruments. Problem is going to krak the aviak merchant is I am<br/>
dubious to him. So I guess Ill just have shout out for someone with faction<br/>
to look for me. Thanks for the info.<br/>

&gt; The reason no animation is seen is because you dont have a target, but<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; wont affect skill increase. If I remeber correctly I bought my horn in FP<br/>
&gt; from the bard guild. If for some reason they no longer sell it, Krap<br/>
&gt; Windbreaker...err Krak the aviak vendor sells them.<br/>
&gt; I do not know what the unfinished trumpet is for. I have seen it but have<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; heard anyone say what it might be used for.<br/>
&gt; Anyways, g&#39;luck to ya.<br/>
