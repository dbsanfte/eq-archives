<br/>
I just wanted to ask you if you have been doing plane of fear at all since <br/>
they nerfed it (well not technically a nerf, but realistically they F&#39;d it <br/>
up if you ask me).<br/>
<br/>
I know of two attempts that were made on my server (Veeshan) since the <br/>
update, and both were disasters.<br/>
36 ppl were slaughtered by 4 mobs, went back to get their corpses and all <br/>
went LD, and were killed again. This was the first attempt.<br/>
<br/>
All i know about the second attempt is there was again 30+ people and they <br/>
almost had a scareling dead, but were jumped by a few more mobs.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to know if you and your group(s) have had any success in PoF since <br/>
the update, and if so do you have any tips for us over on Veeshan. (I just <br/>
got 46 recently, and I&#39;m not looking forward to losing it).<br/>
<br/>
There are countless 46+ ppl on Veeshan, but everyone is afraid to go to PoF <br/>
