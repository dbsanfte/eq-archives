<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Bilge in the Cauldron has been seen once on our<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s kind of funny, Bilge is so rare... I found him,<br/>
comepletely by accident in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron one<br/>
night. A friend and I were leaving unrest. I was 18th<br/>
level, she 21. He promptly killed both of us, twice.<br/>
Once when we wandered into him, and once when we came<br/>
for our bods. I had no clue what he was then, or how<br/>
rare he was. <br/>
