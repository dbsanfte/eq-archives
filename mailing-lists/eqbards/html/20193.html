&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1)  The players get to choose who will represent them.  Each class gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; ten representatives.  The class fansite web boards will be used to vote on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the representatives.  For example, bards have The Concert Hall, rogues<br/>
&gt; &gt; have The Safehouse, etc.  The administrators for those sites would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; responsible for setting up a poll for each class to determine who they<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to represent them.  I think that it would be fairly easy for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; community of each class to come to a consensus on who they want.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; primary character is a bard so I&#39;m most familiar with that community.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are several well known bards who post on the Concert Hall board and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the eqbards mailing list.  These bards would be prime candidates as<br/>
&gt; &gt; official representatives for the class.  I think it is also safe to assume<br/>
&gt; &gt; that other classes have equivalent players.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>those message boards are a fairly small cross section relative to the number of<br/>
players in eq.  true there are a bunch of people who just lurk and never post, but<br/>
i&#39;d say there are really only 20-30 regular posters on the backstage board.  this<br/>
is not counting the random people who come in and post a question, but don&#39;t<br/>
respond or participate a lot in other threads/discussions.  also, there is a tendency<br/>
on most class boards to be fairly to very anti verant, anti change, etc., which really<br/>
does not represent the majority of the players.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; 2)  Type of forum.  This could be set up as a moderated mailing list or a<br/>
&gt; &gt; secure message board on the Everquest website.  Either way, the only<br/>
&gt; &gt; people with access to the site are the player representatives and Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt; employees.  There would have to be a rule established that all discussion<br/>
&gt; &gt; between Verant and the representatives is considered confidential and not<br/>
&gt; &gt; for public release unless Verant grants permission.  Any player who<br/>
&gt; &gt; violates this rule is removed from the council and a replacement selected.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you mean until they get upset about something.  after verant got burned with the<br/>
test server situation, i&#39;m not sure they&#39;ll trust players with sensitive information, even<br/>
when covered by an NDA again.  most of the spoilers being posted from the test<br/>
server were posted or originated by people who were under an NDA with verant.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This just covers the basic framework.  The details can get fleshed out<br/>
&gt; &gt; later if Verant thinks its a good idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As you are well aware of, a lot of players are frustrated with Verant for<br/>
&gt; &gt; a perceived lack of customer service.  In my opinion, Verant can improve<br/>
&gt; &gt; their relationship with their player base by instituting an official<br/>
&gt; &gt; player&#39;s council.  This would go a long way in helping to prove that<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant cares for the players.  Its a win-win situation for both sides that<br/>
&gt; &gt; can be easily implemented.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for taking the time to consider this proposal.<br/>
