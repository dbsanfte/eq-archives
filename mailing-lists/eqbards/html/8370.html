&gt;What might be even more hilarious is if some of us could act as shepards,<br/>
&gt;get some gnome enchanter up to 4th level so we could invis everyone.  A huge<br/>
&gt;party of gnomes wandering across Norrath disappearing and reappearing at<br/>
&gt;random would be hysterical.  We could all stay entirely silent to requests<br/>
&gt;of &quot;what are you doing?&quot; and just see how many people we could get to follow<br/>
&gt;us.  As we leap into the lava we can all scream<br/>
&gt;&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s the entrance to the Temple of Solusek Ro?&quot;<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;m in, refresh my memory when it is supposed to happen.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Which server, what time, etc, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe a lot of people missed it due to high list activity yesterday, if<br/>
&gt;so here&#39;s a report. So far I hadn&#39;t got as far as picking a server or<br/>
&gt;time/date. My initial post was just floating a balloon to see if anyone<br/>
&gt;was interested. As to server/time, if there&#39;s enough interest, I will<br/>
&gt;try to coordinate a time that is most convenient to all who want to<br/>
&gt;attend. Server wise, if someone is in a guild that would like to host<br/>
&gt;the event and provide lemming support (binding, resses for gnomes that<br/>
&gt;die along the way, etc, we will hold it there, otherwise, I&#39;ll just pick<br/>
&gt;one of the lesser used servers (heh, maybe a race war server)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s the original post.<br/>

&gt;I was wondering if enough people on the list would be interested for it<br/>
&gt;to be worth organising a gettogether on one of the servers. As obviously<br/>
&gt;we couldn&#39;t do much serious adventuring with L1 characters for those<br/>
&gt;visiting from other server, I thought the alternative would be to do<br/>
&gt;something silly.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;About the silliest (and fun looking) thing I&#39;ve seen done so far is the<br/>
&gt;naked troll race. While I wouldn&#39;t want to steal that particular idea, I<br/>
&gt;think borrowing the concept is ok, so what I had in mind was something<br/>
&gt;called the March of the Lemmings. The idea would be to all create L1<br/>
&gt;gnomes and march all across Faydwer, take the boat to Freeport, then go<br/>
&gt;up to Lavastorm and jump off the edge of the Solusek crater into the<br/>
&gt;molten lava. However, if someone can come up with a sillier or less<br/>
&gt;derivitive idea, I&#39;m certainly open to that as well.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;Anyone interested? How many people are on the list now? Maybe we should<br/>
&gt;put up a poll to see who would come.<br/>
