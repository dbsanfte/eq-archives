&gt;do anything, however this begs the question if you do it to <br/>
&gt;several different factioned mobs do you become Mr. Popularity <br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t experimented with it really, but I&#39;m hoping someone <br/>

 </span></blockquote>CCC does indeed raise your faction to amiable for the duration<br/>
of your visit to that zone.  However, you cannot click every NPC<br/>
you see and bring your faction to amiable, you can only affect one<br/>
faction at a time.  Attempting to CCC another faction, reduces the<br/>
first CCC you did back to it&#39;s normal level.  You can test this<br/>
in any city on guards and merchants, since each belong to different<br/>
factions.  Once you do CCC it&#39;s there until you zone.<br/>
