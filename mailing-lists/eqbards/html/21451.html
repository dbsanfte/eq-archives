<br/>
Not a poke at you specifically, Olgwinn, just an observation.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading the Concert Hall board last night.  Why are people so<br/>
upset about this being fixed?  It has historically been referred to as<br/>
the &quot;haste bug&quot; and everyone was hoping they wouldn&#39;t find it.  Well,<br/>
its been found and fixed.  It was never intended to work that way and<br/>
everyone (well, a lot of people anyway) knows it.  We ask them to fix<br/>
bugs, and when they do we get upset?  &quot;No, no, not *that* bug!&quot;  A bug<br/>
is a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Maybe now that its fixed, part of<br/>
our overhaul will be to take a look at our haste songs.  Could happen.<br/>
