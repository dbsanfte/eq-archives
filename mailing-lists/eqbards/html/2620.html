<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053732996">Hello all, just thought I would drop you all a line to let you know that I just started another wonderful character in Everquest, and this time it&#39;s a bard!! I&#39;ve been doing a bit of reading on Bard&#39;s and needless to say I am quite impressed. The fact that they get a new song at each level really gives you something to work for! I was wondering though.... Does the first song that you get (Chant of Battle) get better as you get better at singing etc? Or is it just something that you use as a low level guy and discard later? Just curious? Any help would be appreciated...<br/>
And may your voices never crack.</div>
