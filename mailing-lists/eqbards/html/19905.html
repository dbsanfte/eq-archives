<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Bard Training in Kunark and Fabian??? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-932577144">Saying the bankers were never intended to be there was totally bogus and<br/>
designed to get people to stop complaining about this for fear they would be<br/>
removed.  After all, one of the bankers (at least) gives out a quest that is<br/>
Kunark related.  Were they really going to move him to be a new banker in<br/>
another city?  I think not, his dialogue would then make absolutely no<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they never intended trainers to be present, don&#39;t know, doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
since bards don&#39;t have one.  Whatever the real reason they will never admit<br/>
it if it was a mistake and they left some out.  Look at the whole ranger<br/>
defense skills debacle.  IMHO that totally removed all credibility from<br/>
anything Verant says.  They didn&#39;t want to admit they screwed up by not<br/>
raising Ranger defensive skills like all the other melee classes, so they go<br/>
to a ridiculous amount of bother to give them a spell to make it seem like<br/>
they really didn&#39;t need improved defensive skills.  What a bunch of hooey.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s face it Verant is full of BS.  Their game is cool make no mistake, but<br/>
they are a bunch of arrogant jerks who are at least as big of babies as they<br/>
claim all their customers are.<br/>
<br/>
Still nothing we can do to change that.  Eventually someone will come along<br/>
and supplant them.  <br/>
<br/>
On a more bardly note, anyone spotted Fabian who supposedly now is in the<br/>
game???<br/>

Gordon&#39;s answer is based on &quot;We never meant this to be a one-stop shopping&quot;<br/>
IMHO, people scream enough, they are more likely to remove ALL the trainers<br/>
and bankers than to put in a few.</div>
