<div id="ygrps-yiv-35354275">Amassing 2500p excess is no incognizant task time wise.  Then; finding a<br/>
Jeweler who can craft the gear, and getting all those items you refer to<br/>
take a significant amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
Getting to 60 takes a significant amount of time.  My guild has about 110<br/>
people (probably quite a few of those have quit the game not sure exactly)<br/>
Exactly three of those people are level 60.<br/>
<br/>
Again - you are arguing about game balance only from your perspective.<br/>
Maybe you are strictly speaking of specific types of raids (Waking the<br/>
sleeper?) - but I&#39;m talking about Planes, Siren&#39;s Grotto; Western Wastes,<br/>
Dragon Necropolis - and hopefully ToV soon.  My guild does those regularly<br/>
and we wish we had more than one bard (me) above 50...<br/>
<br/>
The bardic resist is VITAL to these raids for guilds like mine own.<br/>

You can&#39;t dispel equipment.  Are jacinth (200pp each), diamonds (500pp<br/>
each), blue diamonds (2500pp each and going down), and regular resist<br/>
gear (dragon tooth choker, froglok crown, tranix crown, countless<br/>
others) etc. out of the reach of people who have reached level 60 (or<br/>
close) and go on the type of big raids we are talking about?<br/>
<br/>
When you lag or die, that means it is ok for the rest of your group to<br/>
die because they were relying on you for resists?  I&#39;m not saying bard<br/>
resists aren&#39;t nice, I&#39;m not saying they can not be used, I am saying<br/>
there are better ways.  Just as there are much better ways to battle<br/>
dispelling mobs.  Uber guilds do things these ways not because it is<br/>
&quot;their&quot; way, but because it is the most efficient and most successful<br/>
way.<br/>

Some people are equipped better than others.  &quot;Uber&quot; guilds get the<br/>
reputation they do is an assumption that everyone should play the way<br/>
they<br/>
do and the design of the game should be catered to the way they play.<br/>
<br/>
I would argue that good equipment is as much a determinant of time spent<br/>
playing as it is ability of the player.  Some of the best players I&#39;ve<br/>
seen<br/>
have some of the most mediocre equipment.<br/>
<br/>
So for many of us; particularly when fighting mobs that dispell - the<br/>
bards<br/>
resist songs are the difference between success and failure.<br/>
