<div id="ygrps-yiv-567855630">On Saturday night I aqquired the Lambent Breastplate from someone (don&#39;t<br/>
all moan and say why didn&#39;t you do the quest yourself), the reason I bought<br/>
it was this.......<br/>
<br/>
I was arranging a deal to trade a crested helm for a Charred BP and Crested<br/>
Spaulders (good deal I though), so to raise the cash to buy the helm I sold<br/>
my Steel BP (got about 700pp). After selling my BP I went to the chap<br/>
selling the helm, and opened the trade window, I had a shock when he put a<br/>
crafted helm in the window (aaarrgghh). Shit no BP now, got lots of pp but<br/>
no one will sell Charred BP for that amount. and I didn&#39;t have enough to<br/>
buy the Steel BP back.<br/>
<br/>
Then all of a sudden I noticed the Lambent BP for sale, I asked how much<br/>
and she said 1500pp. So I offered 1000, she said 1400, I said 1200, she<br/>
said 1300 I said 1250pp so we met halfway. In order to buy this though I<br/>
had to sell my Steel Greaves and Boots. But I raised enough cash and had to<br/>
go around in Leather leggings and sandals, until I found someone selling<br/>
bronze.<br/>
<br/>
This is the only item I am gonna get myself, I have now managed to get the<br/>
Vambraces and Gauntlets myself.<br/>
<br/>
Got the Runes from Choon and Froon the other day, and the Fiery Vambraces,<br/>
I now need Firewalker boots (which are very rare, spent 5 hours saturday in<br/>
excellent group and we held the whole area around the king room, but no<br/>
boots)  8(<br/>
<br/>
I went to lower Guk aswell (first time ever been there, scary stuff). I<br/>
zoned in and immediately joined a group who helped me get Shin Greaves ad<br/>
Gauntlets.<br/>
Later that day I went to Mistmoore (for Silk gloves), did not get any<br/>
but.........<br/>
<br/>
on sunday morning I walked into the mm prison, opened the doors and looted<br/>
a will sappers corpse, and there was 1 rather nice pair of Black Silk<br/>
Gloves just for me.   8)<br/>
<br/>
I spent sunday night in Perma in the King room, killed 5-6 Elite Guards and<br/>
no Icy greaves so I&#39;m a little bit pissed off.<br/>
<br/>
So now I have got, Vambraces, Gloves and BP and am at the moment trying my<br/>
hardest to get the missing parts for my greaves and Boots.<br/>

don&#39;t worry Martyn, that is one of the most outrageously prices asked i<br/>
have<br/>
seen.  MAYBE the breastplate could be sold for that, and that is<br/>
considering<br/>
crafted bp&#39;s go for around 1k.  though i have yet to see any actual prices<br/>
for lambent armor as of yet, your offer was much more in line.<br/>
