<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478914662">Anyone care to comment on my observation that Lament song will change the<br/>
faction con?  E.g.: I lament a Spectre and it goes from blue scowling to<br/>
blue indifferent.  I have done this several times.  Not being a true tester,<br/>
I cant say if it&#39;s every time but it was strange enough that I took note of<br/>
it more than one time.  And walked up to the spectre very close to make sure<br/>
there was no reduced agro range.  The was 0 agro range and he conned<br/>
indifferent.  No, I did not hail him and ask for a quest but maybe next time<br/>
I will.  And next time I see Kisdean Gixx I am trying this on him because I<br/>
know he has a quest.<br/>

Yes, we took a little jaunt to the Plane of Hate.  Not too long into the<br/>
expedition we dropped a scorn banshee and all of a sudden peeps were saying:<br/>
&quot;Gratz Sylly!&quot;  &quot;Woo hoo Sylly!&quot;  And I am like &quot;uhh what?&quot; So they tell me<br/>
to loot it and WOW!!!<br/>
