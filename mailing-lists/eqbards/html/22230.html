<div id="ygrps-yiv-654596972">Leve 53 Song of Twilight, Upgrade( sorta) to Pixie strike.. Has never had a time of day limit on it. I have used this song since I got it, mainly to interupt gates near the end life of the mob or since it PULLS the mob I use it  to get them off the ledges in sebilis when our cleric goes stun crazy.<br/>

  &quot;I have some information about changes we will be making to a few bard<br/>
  songs with the next patch.<br/>
<br/>
  Songs with a damage shield component will have that component removed.<br/>
  Pixie Strike will have its secondary resist reduced.<br/>
  Song of Twilight will be singable at any time of the day. Its secondary<br/>
  resist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration. And<br/>
  it will require an instrument.<br/>
  The single target haste spells will be self-only.<br/>
<br/>
  We will also be revising the bardic epic weapon.<br/>
<br/>
  This should all go live with the next patch, which for now we are<br/>
  tentatively scheduling for late next week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure what to think.<br/>
<br/>
  The removal of the damage shields is sort of OK, it means that the songs<br/>
  won&#39;t drop now.  These songs aren&#39;t so great though, and it would have<br/>
  been nice if something had been added to them.  (A damage shield<br/>
  perhaps).<br/>
<br/>
  Pixie Strike is good.<br/>
<br/>
  Song of Twilight is good.<br/>
<br/>
  Single target haste songs will be self only?  Not sure what that means.<br/>
  As far as I can remember off the top of my head, the only single target<br/>
  song that isn&#39;t self-only is Jonathan&#39;s Provocation, which I have rarely<br/>
  used, but it was useful to use it on other targets sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>
  hardly useful to use it on myself.<br/>
<br/>
  Mostly good, I guess, if the secondary resist for Pixie Strike is low<br/>
  enough.  Of course, I&#39;m long past using the song.<br/>
