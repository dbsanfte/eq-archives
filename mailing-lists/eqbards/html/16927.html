<div id="ygrps-yiv-14853761"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hahaha!  I was in Mistmoore this weekend too and it was CRAZY!  I never<br/>
&gt;fought there with my shaman and I&#39;m really enjoying myself (despite the<br/>
&gt;multiple deaths) because the whacked out pathing makes it challenging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Only advice I have is get a druid to group wtih you.  Once they cast that<br/>
&gt;damage shield on you, the mobs don&#39;t give a FIG about you!  They just start<br/>
&gt;pounding the wimpy druid *snicker*.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I LOVE Mistmoore. I&#39;m camped there currently with a 20 druid... Give me<br/>
a ring some time. I&#39;ll throw Shield of Barbs on you any day of the week.<br/>
What I have learned is to throw the Shield on the puller BEFORE they got<br/>
out and pull, and to throw Shield on the secondary while the puller is out.<br/>
I only throw in the midst of combat if it wears off. Hopefully, by that<br/>
point,<br/>
the tanks have accumulated some taunt on them and it won&#39;t taunt onto me<br/>
NEARLY<br/>
so fast.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I die a LOT more often than my monk puller. She has this neat<br/>
trick of being able to play at death when I&#39;m doing the real thing...<br/>
so I have started playing some when Anna&#39;s not around to keep our levels<br/>
about equal.<br/>
