&gt; I just experimented with this last night, after twisting them<br/>
&gt; together for the past couple of weeks.  I used a combine long sword<br/>
&gt; (28 delay) and swung 20 times (after the very first swing which<br/>
&gt; counted as 0) and ran each test twice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - With no songs going, 20 swings took 56 seconds, which confirms what<br/>
&gt; someone said earlier about the delay representing tenths of seconds<br/>
&gt; of delay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - With Anthem as my only song, 20 swings took 51 seconds, or<br/>
&gt; aproximately a 10% decrease in delay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - With just Whistling Warsong going, 20 swings took 48 seconds, or<br/>
&gt; aproximately a 15% decrease in delay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - With both Anthem and Warsong going, 20 swings still took 48<br/>
&gt; seconds, indicating they do not stack in terms of cutting down on<br/>
&gt; your delay any further.  You do still get a STR boost from each song.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This matches my findings.  I also used a combine longsword.<br/>
The fellow who used punches (slower) got slightly different<br/>
results (bigger speedup).  I&#39;m going to test it again with my<br/>
combine rapier (faster).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Based on this, I&#39;m now no longer going to bother stacking both songs,<br/>
&gt; and when solo I&#39;ll likely twist Warsong with Bellow and Healing.  In<br/>
&gt; groups I&#39;ll do Anthem instead of Warsong.  I am going to test this<br/>
&gt; one more time on a weapon with a greater delay just to be 100% sure.<br/>

useful even in a group (since most mobs end up attacking the <br/>
bard).<br/>
