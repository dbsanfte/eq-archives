<div id="ygrps-yiv-594815480">When it comes to playing the Bard instead of the Fighter, you need to pick <br/>
the right time/place.  The first time I did it and had the group tell me to <br/>
keep my drum and ditch the weapons was in Mistmoore at 19th lvl.  The party <br/>
I joined had been getting hammered by casters, so after a couple of battles <br/>
I switched my song load to include Guardian & Elemental Rythmns. When the <br/>
next caster came up and started pounding us I switched to the drum and <br/>
weaved the two.  When we had dispatched the casters with hardly a scratch I <br/>
told everyone to check their magic resist, they were amazed :)  You do need <br/>
a group with atleast 2 tanks to Bard to the full extent.<br/>

&gt;     I would love to be a &#39;support&#39; Bard but there seems to be an endemic<br/>
&gt;     shortage of tanks on my server.  I am always pressed into service as a<br/>
&gt;     tank.  Sigh.  And the couple of time I was in a group where it might<br/>
&gt;     have worked everyone in the group though I was &#39;slacking&#39; by not<br/>
&gt;     wanting to fight.  Not once have I been able to do this.  Maybe as I<br/>
&gt;     get more circles I will have a chance. (assuming no one cuts me down)<br/>
&gt;     So not all fighting Bards are selfish, just misunderstood and<br/>
&gt;     overworked...<br/>

&gt;Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;[re: successful leveling]<br/>
&gt;I advise all bards overly concerned with the best weapons and damage dealt,<br/>
&gt;to review the gifts that you have been given. Nothing sickens me more than<br/>
&gt;seeing a forceful party in danger, while the bard is selfishly fighting.<br/>
&gt;SHAME ON THAT BARD! If you the bard wants to utilize your talents most<br/>
&gt;efficiently, group with 2 warriors (or a monk), 2 rogues, and 1 party <br/>
&gt;member<br/>
&gt;that can do emergency heals. Stand back and play your heal with your lute,<br/>
&gt;twist whatever other song fits the occasion, and you can fight for hours <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;hours, gain &quot;circles of knowledge&quot; quite quickly. A healthy group prevails,<br/>
&gt;so if you want to succeed and learn quickly, this is your best source. Use<br/>
&gt;your combat skills when soloing, or with weak groups, BUT always remember <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;large groups, you ARE NOT a tank or a fighter, you are a talented musician.<br/>
