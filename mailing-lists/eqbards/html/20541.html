Karg Icebear wanders the tundra, often passing by the North Tower. He will<br/>
make a Polar Bear Cloak for A polar bear skin (cannot be ruined) and 5 pp.<br/>

p.s. hire a ranger to track him for you and hang near Megan&#39;s Tower as he<br/>
patrols to there from the rivers - if he lives that long.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Teen bard looking for adventure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made it to level 16 last night and now I&#39;m tired of working only on<br/>
experience (been in Kunark since 12).  I need some adventure, a quest,<br/>
a goal, something!<br/>
<br/>
My Shaman husband (level 17) and I are planning a trip to Halas so he<br/>
can catch up on his training.  I&#39;ll probably run over to Erudin to<br/>
pick up a couple of missing songs.  After that, who knows.  I&#39;m<br/>
looking for something to do that has some goal attached to it.  A<br/>
quest to complete or an item to obtain.  Any suggestions?<br/>
