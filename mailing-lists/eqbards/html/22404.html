<div id="ygrps-yiv-416790620">Sheeesh, I almost broke up reading all you 30&#39;somethings describe your<br/>
selves as &quot;old&quot; !!!!!!  ....hehe, I am 59 and been loved fantasy games<br/>
and reading since Tolken came out in the late 50&#39;s. Yeah, 1950<br/>
&quot;something&quot;. And in the early 70&#39;s I corrupted my minor children with<br/>
D&D, and later when the with the C-64 and Amiga machines.  <br/>
...anyway, TG EQ wasn&#39;t out then. And I tried switching weapons and<br/>
instruments with my Bard, but on CAREFUL consideration, I figured out<br/>
that the DAM I missed in the &quot;downtime while switching&quot; just wasn&#39;t<br/>
worth it. <br/>
 Before I move from level 47 to level 50, which I just reached it was<br/>
easy. Equip a DRUM or Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine and play yer heart out. With<br/>
50, all of a sudden I have all these &quot;string&quot; options and am back to<br/>
considering &quot;switching&quot; instruments. In fact, If they come up with the<br/>
&quot;Bard as Tank&quot; Jonathan songs we may well have a really decent<br/>
discussion on Tactics. I have in the past cut and pasted this forum for<br/>
Bards in my guild.... but why bother anymore, since there is only one or<br/>
...maybe 2 playing the class....</div>
