 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t think it&#39;s that clear that the client decides the action.  the server<br/>
keeps track of all the locations of objects.  the locations of objects (other<br/>
characters and npcs) determines what function is called, drop/trade/give/etc.<br/>
it would make much more sense to have the whole drop/trade/give/etc code<br/>
on the server side.  in other words the client can just send a mouse_click_happened<br/>
interrupt along with x/y/z coordinates of the mouse location in the window.<br/>
then the server decides what to do with it.</div>
