&gt;		So my question is this... what do I do?  I know in the<br/>
&gt;future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more clear rules<br/>
&gt;set up.  Does this happen on other servers?  Has this happened to any of<br/>
&gt;you?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since Martyr decided to steal the Dawnfire off Cazic Thule&#39;s corpse this has <br/>
been a big issue on our server.<br/>
<br/>
It happened again in Fear the other night when one ranger looted some ranger <br/>
greaves even though he lost the lotto.<br/>
<br/>
Because of these two incidents, those who would normally be completely <br/>
rational go a little overboard when someone doesn&#39;t do something as quick as <br/>
they expected it. Its truly sad that these two individuals have made it very <br/>
difficult to go on any planes run unless you join a power guild because of <br/>
loot stealing issues and its made people who are normally very nice into <br/>
people who trust no one and are looking for conspiracy at every turn.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that most decided that this theft never actually occurred <br/>
though because its not plastered all over the solusekro.org message boards <br/>
so I think you are in the clear.<br/>
