<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827301679">I know this is a long post, my friends, but it&#39;s probably my very last post<br/>
to this group, so I appologize.  I apologize in advance for the language, if<br/>
you are sensitive, stop now.<br/>
<br/>
There is no death in EverQuest, except psychologically.  And I&#39;m dying, I<br/>
think.<br/>
I have loved this list like no other board&#39;ve known in some years.   It is<br/>
highly intellectual, why I bother you with this damned heavy luggage.<br/>
<br/>
Bored.  I&#39;m bored.  Thinking of quiting because of it.  Boredom, I imagine,<br/>
would be probably the worst reason a designer would fear someone would give<br/>
up on their massive online game like this.  Boredom, really, is almost the<br/>
worst of an insult.  Someone is angry, that&#39;s better.  They feel something,<br/>
they&#39;re emotional about it, a love-turned-to-hate kind of thing, acceptable<br/>
and expected.  But boredom?  Boredom, apathy, that&#39;s a lack of everything<br/>
good.  That would be scarry, at least if I were a developer, and that&#39;s what<br/>
I am: not a developer but bored.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, but boredom has it&#39;s good sides.  It&#39;s a slower kind of emotion,<br/>
lets you think.  When you&#39;re bored, you&#39;re less apt to just quit outright,<br/>
and instead ponder why, in fact, you ARE bored.  So I&#39;ve thought on it, and<br/>
it&#39;s off-topic but I couldn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass but I&#39;m posting it here<br/>
because this is the only discussion area I&#39;ve found where maybe someone<br/>
could say something, anything, though I somehow doubt it would help.<br/>
<br/>
* It runs deep, I think.  There is no wandering.  Everyone stays put.<br/>
Camping is a problem, everyone says, and we have all these solutions<br/>
suggested and implemented.  But, mmmm, none will work!  Camping is central<br/>
to EverQuest!  Everyone camps!  Everywhere!  Been to Unrest?  How else do<br/>
you survive there but &quot;camp the wall?&quot;  These people aren&#39;t camping for<br/>
items, but just to play.  Folks camp every dungeon, every outdoor zone.<br/>
I&#39;ve been to West Karanas and watched folks pulling lions to the wall.  And<br/>
it&#39;s the same everywhere else.  Was suggested by a friend, since I so<br/>
loathed camping, to play the south Karanas.  I am currently &quot;camped&quot; there<br/>
now, because that&#39;s all anyone does in such an outdoor zone as well!<br/>
<br/>
I remember Brad McQuaid discussing this, and saying it&#39;s the path of least<br/>
resistance.  How he and his buddies would group up, and move through<br/>
permafrost together, eventually reaching some deep section, then heading<br/>
back to quit for the evening.  This is an ideal, I wish I could be in THAT<br/>
group, because I have NEVER ever ever ever been in a group like that.  GOD<br/>
YES I wish that was how Everquest REALLY worked the WAY he said!!!  Seeing<br/>
such a dungeon, I think he&#39;s bullshitting because it seems impossible!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in Everfrost, and it gets insanely more difficult the deeper you<br/>
go.  Like waves.  If I&#39;m in a level 20 average group in Everfrost, we will<br/>
find things easy at first, then we&#39;ll find a few MOBs that are a good fight,<br/>
as we go on we Find some hard ones, then we are immedietly overwhelmed and<br/>
dead.  If our group is around level 30 in level, well, then maybe we have a<br/>
chance:  Yet we&#39;d still get no experience for the early part, still get<br/>
overwhelmed by wall bugs.<br/>
<br/>
So folks camp.  They find the area where things give them experience, sit<br/>
there for a few hours, and let one person bring the nasties to them.  And<br/>
the warriors are always healing, and the mages are always meditating anyway.<br/>
So the game -requires- camping in this respect.  We aren&#39;t choosing the<br/>
&quot;path of least resistance&quot; because I, for one, do not know what the hell<br/>
McQuaid is talking about.  I&#39;d love to see him and his group play.  Either<br/>
your group can Handle the best of a dungeon, in which case they get no<br/>
experience as they battle their way through it to the end, or they camp the<br/>
area where they get it.<br/>
<br/>
Back to Unrest.  A while back I was O so bored &quot;camping the wall&quot; as it<br/>
were, and someone suggested we hit the Magi Room and camp that.  I was<br/>
actually Happy to be moving in a group, finally.  We might not have been<br/>
moving for long, but at least we were on the move.  Most of the group were<br/>
in the room and settled, but one fellow was lost.  I went out and found him.<br/>
No songs or spells, nothing fancy, we were just walking back up the stairs.<br/>
At the edge of the stairs everything in the basement and attic attacked me<br/>
at once.  I had time to read the message, &quot;HITS YOU&quot; before death came<br/>
lurking.  Do NOT move about through dungeons, stay in one place and camp it.<br/>
The bugs, not to mention class requirements, warrant it.<br/>
<br/>
If McQuaid would like bands of adventurers to be heroically moving about and<br/>
adventuring, rather than  sitting around like white trash in a JellyStone<br/>
Park, why is it like this?  O, fighters need time to sit and heal, and mages<br/>
need time to replenish mana.  The game encourages camping by all it&#39;s<br/>
downtime.<br/>
<br/>
I say it&#39;s perfectly ridiculous, actually.  Especially warriors<br/>
complaining!!  &quot;I broke my leg and it actually takes me 3 whole minutes to<br/>
regenerate the wound!  This is not fair!&quot;  Bah!  It is all perfectly<br/>
ridiculous.  I had a friend in traction 10 months for an accident.<br/>
<br/>
:My solution:  No natural regeration of wounds, for anyone.  This is not how<br/>
wounds work, afterall.  A warrior is wounded, make no natural regeneration<br/>
but increase effect of bandages.  They want healing, find a freaking cleric.<br/>
<br/>
No regeneration of mana either.  I know there&#39;s no real-world counter-part,<br/>
which others would point out THIS IS A GAME anyway in the last argument, but<br/>
we&#39;re talking logic.  Mana, where does it come from?  The physics of mana?<br/>
Where is this pure energy coming from?  Apparently Norrath does have<br/>
gravity, and follows Einstein, so we must assume Energy cannot be just<br/>
created out of thin air.  It needs a source....  The soul I always assumed,<br/>
but that can only supply so much.  So I say any mana user must find a source<br/>
of their mana and cast a spell, a place where they take their mana from.<br/>
That UFO in Qeynos would be a good place.  But at higher levels, I say<br/>
better places to find where one can channel mana from.  When one needs more<br/>
mana, they must teleport there, at least in spirit, through a complex spell.<br/>
Enough with everyone sitting on their duffs.  Burn mana in a battle, run and<br/>
hope you&#39;re not chased to find a private spot to channel spirit spell to<br/>
regain all your lost mana.  I want the game to require people to be on THE<br/>
MOVE and not encourage them to sit around like they&#39;re lazy.<br/>
<br/>
*  AI lacking.  In a massively multiplayer game it should be better,<br/>
especially one that is so Player vs. Environment based.   This is AI that<br/>
was seen in Doom, if that.  The wonder of AI that some folks are impressed<br/>
by how it acts, when it&#39;s actions are not that complex.  MUST be improved.<br/>
When I fight this AI, it makes me bored.<br/>
<br/>
:I want to see a wandering band of orcs that act as a team.  A leader, a<br/>
cleric, and grunts.  Grunts will break off when even less than half wounded<br/>
to let others take the brunt, grunts will protect cleric, team will fall<br/>
apart when leader dies.  I want to see ALL MOBs not be so damn still.  You<br/>
get in a Duel and everyone moves, and tactics begin to come into play.  MOBs<br/>
use no tactics, they stand still and things get very boring.  One MOB is<br/>
like any other, just higher level and maybe with different spells.<br/>
<br/>
* Tradeskills are lacking.  I have a feeling, given a year, this may work<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
* Death.  There is no death.  I want to die.  I cannot die.  Who were the<br/>
generation before this, the immortal generation?  Totally ignored by the<br/>
story of the game.<br/>
<br/>
* The story is too static.  One of Brad McQuaid&#39;s problems with adding<br/>
monsters that offer random cool items was that it wouldn&#39;t work in the<br/>
story.  I can understand this point perfectly, yet people would always be<br/>
camping anyway because that&#39;s all they ever do.  But back to the story.<br/>
<br/>
The story, is, rather interesting.  But this is not the story for a<br/>
massively online roleplaying game.  This is the story for a single player<br/>
game!  Let&#39;s take, for example, the story of Crushbone.<br/>
<br/>
One can jump an orc courier a bit ways off from Crush.  Eventually one works<br/>
their way to Crushbone, finding many interesting things going on, an<br/>
alliance with dark elves for instance.  One fights their way through there,<br/>
and eventually finds a one ambassador Dvinn!  Ah HAH!  And slay him.<br/>
<br/>
Problem.  That courier is always delivering notes, ambassador Dvinn will<br/>
always be undergoing negotiations.  Kill him?  No matter.<br/>
<br/>
It is like a moment locked in time, it never changes.  No matter what anyone<br/>
does, the NPCs will always be locked in that moment, regardless what level<br/>
the real folk have gotten to.  The &quot;plot&quot; is unchanging.  Join a massively<br/>
online rolplaying game with an ongoing plot!  There is no ongoing plot.<br/>
Everything is the same.  It always has been, always will.  McQuaid wants<br/>
people to appreciate where items come from plotwise, when they buy them or<br/>
find them.  Yet I&#39;m afraid those subtlties are lost when it&#39;s always that<br/>
same NPC in that same place, and they never change.<br/>
<br/>
:An ever evolving NPC plot, entirely dependent on PC action!   How does the<br/>
plot unfold?  Almost like voting.  The most PCs to do the most quests one<br/>
way determine how a plot unfolds!<br/>
<br/>
Why is there a &quot;Rescue the Princess&quot; quest where the princess can never<br/>
actually be rescued?  Because she can&#39;t!  She has to be around for the next<br/>
guy to resuce her!!  The story sucks, folks.  It wants to be a single player<br/>
game, the story!!!  This is not a plot for a massive role playing game, it&#39;s<br/>
a scizophrenic single user plot.<br/>
<br/>
* Fix the damned NPC parser.  Using Scott Adams Parser in 1999!!!!  Infocom<br/>
got it better in 1985!!!<br/>
<br/>
* To really encourage roleplaying and a community allow people access to an<br/>
in-game print press.  Where they can make their own newspapers or books.<br/>
Allow people to own a deck of cards so they can play kings court and gamble.<br/>
Make a Roulette Wheel when a PC spins it everyone can watch the text as it<br/>
clicks along.<br/>
<br/>
NAMELY<br/>
<br/>
GIVE folks options besides combat!!!  I ask this, because the way combat<br/>
works in EverQuest bores the living crap out of me.  If it weren&#39;t for the<br/>
way groups worked, &quot;heroes&quot; sitting around in some safe corner while squires<br/>
hauled the monsters one at a time for them.... BAH!<br/>
<br/>
In Everquest, there&#39;s no option but combat, everything else sucks, and if<br/>
you don&#39;t like the way combat works, well then you&#39;re fucked.<br/>
