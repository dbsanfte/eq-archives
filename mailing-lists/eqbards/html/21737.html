<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402642980">Having a DSL connection and NOT have a firewall is the same as leaving the<br/>
keys in your car overnight.  If you also don&#39;t have a GOOD up-to-date virus<br/>
protection you may already have been infiltrated.  Make sure you have the<br/>
latest Virus update and run a full disk scan.<br/>
<br/>
DSL is always on - and usually has a fixed-IP address.  That makes you very<br/>
easy to find.  To make things worse - there are viruses like the QaZ virus<br/>
that use infected machines as attack points - and search similar IP<br/>
addresses for security holes - and then will install itself on that<br/>
machine... I have DSL and get on average about a dozen attacks at night.<br/>
<br/>
This is especially true if you use EQ.  A friend of mine who has DSL and<br/>
didn&#39;t have a firewall had his EQ account hacked.  The guy was able to sniff<br/>
out his Station name and password and logged on to his EQ character and<br/>
tried to sell all his items.  Fortunately he was a well known player - and<br/>
some friends gave him a tell asking why he was selling the items they knew<br/>
he USED.  The way the guy responded made it clear it wasn&#39;t him.  They<br/>
reported it to a guide who immediately kicked and locked the account.<br/>
Fortunately for Uuena - this happened fast enough that the guy didn&#39;t have<br/>
time to actually sell anything.<br/>
<br/>
So I would IMMEDIATELY get a firewall program.  By the way - if you&#39;re<br/>
really paranoid - never publicly post what firewall you are using.  There<br/>
are potential holes in any firewall - and if someone knows what product you<br/>
are using they can exploit that knowledge...<br/>

As I am running on a DSL connection, would I gain any benefit from using a<br/>
firewall such as Black Ice?<br/>
<br/>
My pc isn&#39;t networked (yet) and I&#39;m wondering if I need that sort of<br/>
security.<br/>

stealths your ports making your systems nearly invisible on the net.  The<br/>
interface also hot links back to thier website if you want to read up on the<br/>
kind of attacks/probes it is blocking.<br/>
