&gt;occasional wandering wisps will give good loot, and if you<br/>

&gt;and the griffons and giants do a good job of keeping the riff<br/>

&gt;are tough to crack without a group (7-9 mobs usually).<br/>

camp.  I was there for several hours pre equip loss, and<br/>
a few since re-equipping.  If you get on the hill to the<br/>
west of the camp, you&#39;ll see that it is very long in the N/S<br/>
direction.  When a group pulls from the front (where I<br/>
see most of them camp) they tend not to get the dervs<br/>
in the back.  I&#39;ve seen a group engage the front ones, <br/>
and the back ones will, sometimes, just stay put.  I think<br/>
this happens most when there are no dervs in the mid<br/>
part of the camp, breaking the aggro help chain from<br/>
the front derv to the back dervs.<br/>
<br/>
With careful planning, lament and bellow, I was often<br/>
able to break that chain myself, and take the rearmost<br/>
derv out of the camp.  Like soloing bandit camps in<br/>
W. Karanas, it needs to be done just right, or you find<br/>
yourself with 6 opponents (a green caster derv resisted<br/>
my lament, and took exception to the effort.  He was<br/>
dead in the middle of the camp, and everyone came<br/>
to help :(   )<br/>
