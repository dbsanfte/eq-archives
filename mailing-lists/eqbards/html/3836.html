&gt;griffons and hill giants in West Comonlands.  The young<br/>
&gt;kodiaks and kodiaks there give pretty good experience, the<br/>
&gt;occasional wandering wisps will give good loot, and if you<br/>
&gt;ever get in trouble there&#39;s lots of open space to flee/kite/<br/>
&gt;heal/zone.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever died in West Commonlands,<br/>
&gt;and the griffons and giants do a good job of keeping the riff<br/>
&gt;raff out.  There are dervish and orc camps there too, but they<br/>
&gt;are tough to crack without a group (7-9 mobs usually).<br/>

camp.  I was there for several hours pre equip loss, and<br/>
a few since re-equipping.  If you get on the hill to the<br/>
west of the camp, you&#39;ll see that it is very long in the N/S<br/>
direction.  When a group pulls from the front (where I<br/>
see most of them camp) they tend not to get the dervs<br/>
in the back.  I&#39;ve seen a group engage the front ones, <br/>
and the back ones will, sometimes, just stay put.  I think<br/>
this happens most when there are no dervs in the mid<br/>
part of the camp, breaking the aggro help chain from<br/>
the front derv to the back dervs.<br/>
<br/>
With careful planning, lament and bellow, I was often<br/>
able to break that chain myself, and take the rearmost<br/>
derv out of the camp.  Like soloing bandit camps in<br/>
W. Karanas, it needs to be done just right, or you find<br/>
yourself with 6 opponents (a green caster derv resisted<br/>
my lament, and took exception to the effort.  He was<br/>
dead in the middle of the camp, and everyone came<br/>
to help :(   )<br/>
