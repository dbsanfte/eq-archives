<div id="ygrps-yiv-947372119">You know what&#39;s really sad?  I wrestle with the decision to restart<br/>
my currently &quot;of the 11th Chorus.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t pump my strength all the way, I had decided when creating my<br/>
character to &quot;play the bard&quot; -- which meant being a great singer /<br/>
instrumentalist  and  being an extremely charismatic person.  So I<br/>
have 100 Dexterity and 100 Charisma.  My strength is only 80.  (I do<br/>
have the basic +2 ring from a jeweler friend, and a purity belt, but<br/>
I would really like to get some earmufflers!)<br/>
<br/>
The first time I donned my banded tunic, I was awed by how good I<br/>
look in it.  Admit it, how many characters get that golden armor look<br/>
without resorting to bronze?  And then when you complete the outfit<br/>
(I actually hate the headpiece, so I never bought it), you get that<br/>
golden/blue-boy look.<br/>
<br/>
But the damn thing was so heavy that you have to watch what you loot.<br/>
 And I was training my tailoring at the time.  Not to mention the<br/>
inordinate amount of time it takes to loot your own corpse.<br/>
<br/>
So, off goes the armor, into two backpacks in the bank, and I started<br/>
my poaching-in-the-nude era.  That&#39;s also when I saw my Defense skill<br/>
finally catch up with my level.  That&#39;s also when I first met Ness<br/>
(who probably conned me red, inspected my inventory and found out I<br/>
wasn&#39;t wearing anything ...)<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyway, back to the present.  I&#39;m level 11 now, and the only<br/>
monsters I can get exp from are those that do incredible amounts of<br/>
damage and have bash skills to boot.  I come out at half life with<br/>
blues, and blacks can kill me if I don&#39;t kite them around the block a<br/>
few times while I heal up.<br/>
<br/>
One time after getting easily killed by a darkweed, I decided to take<br/>
the banded out of cold storage.  Lo and behold.  Darkweed, easy solo.<br/>
 Young Kodiak, can&#39;t even hit me enough times before it starts<br/>
running away.  I was a happy poacher with two HQ bear pelts, and four<br/>
HQ cat pelts.  Granted, I was encumbered at 100 lbs, but when I&#39;m<br/>
fighting, my two songs give just enough strength not to suffer any<br/>
encumberance penalties.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it would be nice to have 100 strength in the first place, just<br/>
so I can walk to the inn instead of crawling.<br/>
<br/>
Pheh.  Hopefully I&#39;ll find some more strength boosting items soon.  I<br/>
just need to make money now.....<br/>
<br/>
Quit on Stormtower?  NEVER!  Well ... not a second time ...<br/>
<br/>
(My original character was Sturmtower, who reached level 4 before I<br/>
decided that agility doesn&#39;t do as much as dexterity.  I didn&#39;t twink<br/>
-- there was nothing to twink at that level anyway.  But ol&#39;<br/>
Stormtower _is_ not really the original.)<br/>

Stormtower of the 11th Chorus<br/>
a very happy new owner of a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
and subsequently cash poor<br/>
