&gt; I&#39;m sorry it happened that way for whatever reason but I do <br/>
&gt; believe since I<br/>
&gt; play a caster that I would be mad if you weren&#39;t playing the <br/>
&gt; mana regen song<br/>
&gt; in between fights.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the song they wanted him to play was our level 3 song (Jig o&#39;<br/>
Vigor), which DOES NOT increase mana regen in the slightest.  The level 32<br/>
song, I could understand why they may get a little miffed about him not<br/>
playing that.<br/>
