<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202085038">Aside from my epic, this was the most memorable quest I&#39;ve done (even better than my lambant bracer quest where I had to kite 15 griffines before a charm dropped -- I bought my second bracer P).  A power gamer is better off just buying a walrus skin drum but if you do quests, this is deffinately one not to miss out on.  <br/>
These were actually the toughest coins for me to get.  I went to Dalnirs and suffered many deaths (mostly because of bad pick up groups but I did meet some excellent players as well).  I went to Kaesora several times with guildmates and never saw a failed crypt raider.<br/>
I paid 10pp for my Dalnir coin and 200pp for my Kaesora coin (I cringed but it was worth it).  I made four trips into Kaesora and never saw a failed crypt raider.  Both dungeons can be a tough place to hunt.  I recommend getting your guild involved as it&#39;s good to have friends around places like these.  <br/>

Two coins left... the kaesora coin and the dalnir coin.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate any stories/remembrances from anyone getting these <br/>
coins.  Looks like I need 40 - 45 lvl group to get either, but how much <br/>
luck have people had by just shouting from zone in either place?<br/>
<br/>
any info appreciated.  Really looking forward to that tambourine<br/>
