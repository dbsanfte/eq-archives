<b>Subject:</b> RE: Levels after hell levels (OT) Verant code errors <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956197254">I get the impression that many of Verant&#39;s developers are like one I have<br/>
here at work.  He writes good code for the most part and recently completely<br/>
rewrote a subprogram from scratch to clean it up and improved performance<br/>
threefold.  He changed the input parameters to remove obsolete ones as well.<br/>
Unfortunately he forgot to change the actual calls to the subprogram so<br/>
nothing worked when he put it through the pipe and it got to me for review.<br/>
I had to actually go into the code myself and physically show him where the<br/>
mistake was before he&#39;d even admit the possibility of an error.  Here it was<br/>
a case where he&#39;d look at his code, see no errors and reject all claims to<br/>
the contrary.  It never occurred to him that he actually forgot to write<br/>
some extremely simple code in another program altogether.  This guy<br/>
continually makes these sorts of errors and these simple errors have<br/>
obscured his generally sound coding to the point where he is likely to lose<br/>
his job if it continues much longer.  Bottom line is, it does no good to<br/>
write brilliant code if that code can&#39;t ever be executed properly due to<br/>
lack of ability to pay attention to details.<br/>

&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t mean this to be harsh, I just wonder what<br/>
&gt; causes us to blame the coders rather than the designers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Um, and that sign reversal thing does suck, btw.  You have<br/>
&gt; a point there, but I&#39;ve done stupid things like that in my<br/>
&gt; code before, and I bet you have, too :P<br/>
<br/>
Yes I&#39;ve done it in my code before.  That&#39;s why I find it<br/>
galling that they refuse to comment on my post showing<br/>
evidence that there is a sign error.  It&#39;s like they think<br/>
they&#39;re incapable of making such a common mistake.<br/>
