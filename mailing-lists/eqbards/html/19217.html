cool responses.  <br/>

I do not seek this duel, but I won&#39;t back down when he<br/>
challenges me.  <br/>
<br/>
For the record (if I win) I won&#39;t kill him with his<br/>
pet.  A jerk he may be, but he is my guild brother.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Few tips:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1)  Do not group with him<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2)  Charm him and make him attack his pet (he<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t cast <br/>
&gt; &gt; spells at all, pet<br/>
&gt; &gt; may even kill him before charm wears off)<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3)  Rinse and repeat<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you wish to pay him back for being a jerk without<br/>
&gt; causing him to loose<br/>
&gt; experience, have hotkeyed something like:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /say &quot;Wow!  You really DO have great pets!&quot;<br/>
&gt; /em cringes as he watches the poor little mage get<br/>
&gt; torn to shreads<br/>
&gt; /say &quot;Did that hurt?  Because it looked like it<br/>
&gt; hurt.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and for laughs<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /pet who leader<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But do let him suicide his pet before it kills him.<br/>
