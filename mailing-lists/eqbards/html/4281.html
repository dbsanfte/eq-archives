Songs say percussion, but percussion has no effect.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; And I thought we had a couple high level songs which lowered<br/>
&gt; &gt; monster resists?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At L46 our 3 magic resist lowering songs were resisted 100% <br/>
&gt; of the time<br/>
&gt; by the ice giants. To bring this a bit back to the theme of the list,<br/>
&gt; has anyone else noted that even though the chant scrolls say they are<br/>
&gt; percussion, playing a drum doesnt appear to make a darn bit of<br/>
&gt; difference? I tested chant of flame and chant of ice on myself with my<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore drum and playing a drum makes no difference either in the<br/>
&gt; damage taken or the amount of resistance lowered.<br/>
