&gt; I sadly informed her my only piece of plane equipment (after nearly 2 months<br/>
&gt; at 46+) is my Six Note Blade.  She was apalled :)<br/>

<br/>
  What pieces are you using?<br/>
<br/>
  So far I have:  Opoline Helm, Charred BP + gloves + boots<br/>
<br/>
  I suppose I need those black chitlin legs, but what arm/wrist gear?<br/>
  <br/>
  I guess you could go with azure sleeves and bracers that were silver.<br/>
  Ugh, then I&#39;d look like a freakin dark paladin ;-)<br/>
