<div id="ygrps-yiv-737210488">I agree with some of what you say.<br/>
<br/>
Mana boost for Hybrids: I couldn&#39;t care less. What they get doesn&#39;t affect<br/>
me. I honestly wouldn&#39;t use the mana boost anyway. Like it was originally<br/>
said, the only time I&#39;m OOM is after a res. (of course having an enchanter<br/>
in my regular group means I don&#39;t have to charm all that much)<br/>
<br/>
Exp penalty: Luck of the draw. We deserve the penalty. Not because we are a<br/>
hybrid of 2 classes. We deserve it because we have many abilities and to<br/>
offset the sheer number we need to have an exp penalty. The penalty has<br/>
nothing to do with parent classes, it has to do with having more ability<br/>
than one of the pure classes.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers can track and they get spells. This means they have more abilities<br/>
than the pure class of warrior, so they get an exp modifier.<br/>
<br/>
Paladins can LoH and get spells.<br/>
<br/>
Sks get HT and spells.<br/>
<br/>
We get tracking, songs, we can cast while moving (HUGE) so we get a<br/>
modifier. Makes perfect sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, for broken songs, if we can find that original post of abashi&#39;s where<br/>
he admits the problems and announces an intended patch, then we can use that<br/>
as fuel on our fire and force the issue.<br/>

For me, it&#39;s not so much that I&#39;m getting an exp penalty as it is that VI is<br/>
using it against us.<br/>
Example:<br/>
VI: &quot;All hybrids get a mana boost&quot; (and honestly, I could care less about<br/>
more mana)<br/>
Bards: &quot;Where is our mana boost?&quot;<br/>
VI: &quot;You are not hybrids&quot;<br/>
<br/>
VI: &quot;All hybrids have an exp penalty&quot;<br/>
Bards: &quot;Why do we have it?&quot;<br/>
VI: &quot;You are hybrids&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DOH!<br/>
<br/>
Another of my favorites is<br/>
VI: &quot;No, mana for bards isn&#39;t really mana usage, but a timer to stem off<br/>
possible exploits&quot;<br/>
Bards: &quot;Well, since it&#39;s just a timer and we don&#39;t have any way to regen<br/>
mana faster, what about the death penalty?&quot;<br/>
VI: &quot;Tough s***&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another big problem I have with Abashi&#39;s post is that he himself admitted<br/>
that there was &quot;an in advertant nerf&quot; to Chains when they lowered the rate<br/>
on the lvl 54 song.  He then stated that a patch would follow to fix it.<br/>
This is the first that has been mentioned since then.  I guess our patch was<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not broken&quot;.<br/>
And I&#39;m not even going to get into Lullaby or the fact that a literal wave<br/>
of song ideas were posted months ago for the level 49 song, and we have been<br/>
given no word yet.<br/>

&gt; I agree but that isn&#39;t a valid arguement for removing xp penalties.  It&#39;s<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; valid arguement for changing the way that group experience is shared.  It<br/>
&gt; should be based on level, not on total xp gained.  The reason it was set<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; the way it is was that Verant felt, and I tend to agree with them, that<br/>
&gt; friends would be grouping alot and would want to level at the same rate so<br/>
&gt; they divided xp the way they did so that friends would level at around the<br/>
&gt; same rate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This worked, but the problem is that most people do not, in fact, group<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; their &#39;friends&#39; regularly and thus groups of strangers are penalized for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; hybrid&#39;s experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately experience sharing is embedded deeply into the client and<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure if Verant is willing to totally re-write the game engine to fix<br/>
&gt; something that was put in intentionally.  I&#39;m not sure I would expect them<br/>
&gt; to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The hybrid penalty is a HUGE problem.  If it worked like it did in AD&D,<br/>
&gt; &gt; fine, that would be one thing.  The problem is not that a class is<br/>
slower<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; level, but rather that having a hybrid in your group makes the whole<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; &gt; level slower.  This unfairly penalizes your group members for what is<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposed to be your penalty.<br/>
