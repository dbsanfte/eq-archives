&gt;I think for me the most interesting part of the Horizons solution was the<br/>

&gt;PK&#39;d by a random server generated assassin that would always know where he<br/>

Let me share with you a story of the original Talies - Talies Wanderbur, a <br/>
Halfling Bard in Dragonrealms...<br/>
One night, as they were preparing to open Jadewater Mansion for the first <br/>
time, I was waiting around, decked out in my finest (actually, my Trader <br/>
Patron&#39;s finest - I was just an outlet store for her unique wares).  As I <br/>
scanned the ever-increasing crowd, one face jumped out at me - Muumuu - <br/>
well known corpse-robber, and despised by the Bardic community as a <br/>
whole.  Most recently he had stolen a poor young Bardess&#39;s recently bonded* <br/>
lute, and refused to return it, or any of the other items he had <br/>
stolen.  Generally, he just logged when confronted.  Hoping to finally <br/>
recover the missing instrument, but knowing that as young a bard as I was, <br/>
I couldn&#39;t confront him myself, I ran quickly to the Bard&#39;s Guild and <br/>
passed through the mystic portal, into the inner sanctum.  &quot;Muumuu&#39;s here - <br/>
I just saw him heading for the bridge!&quot;<br/>
Nothing like a call to arms to rouse every Bard and their friends.  We <br/>
rapidly assembled a posse of 5 including a War Mage with a familiar we were <br/>
using to track Muumuu&#39;s movements.  Having spotted him in the bad part of <br/>
town, we began to make our way there, only to see the Mage suddenly stiffen <br/>
and slump to the ground.  One of the Bards who knew him well called it <br/>
&quot;Familiar shock&quot; - someone had slain his familiar (a serious offense!  Like <br/>
killing someone&#39;s puppy!)  Incensed, we rushed to the scene, just in time <br/>
to witness Muumuu fleeing in the opposite direction.  We gave chase, <br/>
finally cornering him in an alley, where, with weapons drawn, we confronted <br/>
him about the missing items.  Being as low as I was, I knew all I could do <br/>
was aim and keep Muumuu under close watch in case he should try to <br/>
flee.  Suddenly a burly warrior stepped in and accused us of harassing the <br/>
&quot;young trader&quot; Muumuu.  Despite our statements, and Muumuu&#39;s own snide <br/>
remarks, the warrior refused to stand aside, and suddenly advanced on one <br/>
of our own, slaying him in one blow!  This was a great shock to us all, as <br/>
one learns that you NEVER kill someone in town, or the guards throw you in <br/>
jail.  Seeing nothing happen to this Warrior, however, and catching Muumuu <br/>
backing away from the corner of my eye, I loosed, piercing him through the <br/>
throat, killing him on the spot.  An act, I admit now, that was poorly <br/>
thought out, and I do regret - did regret the instant I did it, for no <br/>
sooner had the arrow left my bowstring, than I was clapped in irons and <br/>
dragged off to a cell, while the remainder of my comrades fought the <br/>
warrior valiantly.  The warrior, incidentally, was never captured, while I <br/>
lost all of mine (and my Patrons) hard earned items (courtesy of another <br/>
bug we won&#39;t go into ;).<br/>
So you see the problem with NPC-meted justice is that it isn&#39;t always fair, <br/>
because NPCs can&#39;t see the real circumstances behind anything - and since <br/>
they are programmed by people who make mistakes, they will make those <br/>
mistakes over and over again...<br/>
