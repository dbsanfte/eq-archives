<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909189295">Umm... something to remember:<br/>
<br/>
Coward code, for whatever reason, is not implemented on undead found in the<br/>
wilderness.  They didn&#39;t bother.  Any undead you find in a _dungeon_ have<br/>
the coward code implemented.  This was because of the ungodly trains that a<br/>
green conned skeleton would cause if for some reason someone would scare it.<br/>
During beta coward code was put on every npc in every dungeon.  The undead<br/>
that wander around outside in the wild don&#39;t have it.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure they con indifferent?  I&#39;ll double check it next time I&#39;m in<br/>
unrest but I don&#39;t recall invis working at all there.  Maybe they snuck it<br/>
in with the invis/see invis patch?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Everyone that I have ever seen purport that Clouding works<br/>
&gt; &gt; vs. undead seems to have 1 major misconception:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; All the undead in unrest except Barbed bones (and higher)<br/>
&gt; &gt; are under level 20, which means they have green coward<br/>
&gt; &gt; code affecting them.  You could, at level 30, walk around<br/>
&gt; &gt; in unrest pretty much unperturbed by ANY of the undead<br/>
&gt; &gt; simply because they won&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re so far<br/>
&gt; &gt; above them in level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just because an undead critter doesn&#39;t attack doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;re invisible to them.  Try using clouding then CONNING<br/>
&gt; &gt; the undead.  They still con as &#39;ready to attack&#39;.  Which<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, they /con indifferernt.  That&#39;s how I&#39;ve always tested<br/>
&gt; whether it worked or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Except for ghouls and a couple other undead I don&#39;t recall at<br/>
&gt; the moment, coward code doesn&#39;t apply to undead.  All those<br/>
&gt; silly L5-10 skeletons and mummies still attack me at 49.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s actually one of the reasons necro pets were regarded as<br/>
&gt; better than mage pets early on - they wouldn&#39;t refuse to<br/>
&gt; attack something.<br/>
