<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-213271596">I was thinking the same thing.  First thought I had when I heard the forage<br/>
rumour was, &quot;Oh crap they screwed up.  They meant to raise our forage cap to<br/>
105 so we&#39;d have a small chance at foraging these things.  Wonder how long<br/>
this&#39;ll take to fix.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if that&#39;s the case, but it was the first thing to come to mind<br/>
since our forage cap raised at the same time Plains Pebbles began to be<br/>
found on Antonica.  Made me think they were raising it in response to some<br/>
quest in Kunark and mis-entered the new cap.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
	Arright. I didn&#39;t want to mention it until I got one but since my<br/>
availability of people I&#39;d need to complete this is nil, here goes. From<br/>
what I&#39;ve heard but can&#39;t confirm, the burynai bunt cake is foraged in the<br/>
Field of Bone. It is a special item (i.e. at least 100 in foraging) so you<br/>
gotta get a druid or ranger out there. Big prob is that FoB is a newbie zone<br/>
so the only ranger/druids you might find out there would be ones passing<br/>
through or waiting to go into Kaesora. Don&#39;t ask how you would realistically<br/>
*forage* a bunt cake. Maybe they grow on plants in Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
	There is also no oven/recipe/anything special in Kurn&#39;s Tower that<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
seen regarding this.<br/>
<br/>
	The quest *may* result in a decent item even though it appears so<br/>
simple<br/>
given the fact that only bards can use the helm yet we can&#39;t forage the<br/>
thing and would have a hard time discovering the location because of the<br/>
lack of high level druids/rangers in the zone. Any bets on if Verant messed<br/>
us over by making the bunt cake NODROP like the farefire seeds from the same<br/>
zone? Ooh! Maybe made the bunt cake AND the helm NODROP making it completely<br/>
useless!!<br/>
<br/>
	The Singing Steel Helm would be nice since a lot of class stuff is<br/>
coming<br/>
from Sebilis. :)<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

Sineras, you say that you fear that you may have said too much which implies<br/>
that you know more.  What might you know that you&#39;re not telling us, pray<br/>
tell?  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	This is all what I figured about the quest when i first<br/>
&gt; heard about it. So<br/>
&gt; far as I gathered, there is no recipe. We apparently have to find one or<br/>
&gt; rather forage one where burynai live. Well... technically &#39;we&#39;<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t forage<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
&gt; 	And the helm is supposedly from Sebilis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	But I fear I&#39;ve said too much now... :)<br/>
&gt; 	Good Journey<br/>
