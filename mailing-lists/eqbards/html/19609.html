<br/>
I was in kedge a few days ago and a realization hit me...<br/>
<br/>
My icons don&#39;t flash anymore before they fade. When I was a young bard<br/>
growing up, I used to see flashing icons all the time, reminding me that my<br/>
buff was about to fade so that I could refresh it. I know that my ranger<br/>
still sees his icons fading. (it&#39;s just that I almost never play him<br/>
anymore) But bards are not so lucky.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know why or when this change made it in, and does anyone else feel<br/>
that we should fight to get it back?<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn&#39;t had Tarew&#39;s memmed, I would have been EXTREMELY nervous being in<br/>
kedge with no idea when my enduring breath was going to fade.<br/>
