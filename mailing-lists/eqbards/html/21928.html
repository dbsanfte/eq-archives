<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248247021">I have never heard of these additional saves vs charm.<br/>
<br/>
1:  Ithink the resistance on charm is just about right.<br/>
2.  It breaks early maybe once a night.  Very rare event.<br/>
<br/>
One problem I have with charm is the &quot;This mob is too high level to be<br/>
charmed&quot;  Or whatever message you used to get no longer is given.  You<br/>
merely get resisted 100% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
The other problem is that about 5% of my charms seem to fall into that:<br/>
Song End/Song Pulse/Song End trap that they &quot;cannot pin down&quot;  This is<br/>
paticularly nasty with charm since you can&#39;t recharm till the non charm<br/>
expires (not to mention wastes mana)</div>
