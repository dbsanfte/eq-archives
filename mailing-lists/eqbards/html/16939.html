&gt; (relative to her) hitpoint<br/>
&gt; types is when they run from a mob instead of<br/>
&gt; standing there and taking their<br/>
&gt; beating.  Makes it virtually impossible for her to<br/>
&gt; successfully taunt the<br/>

&gt; &quot;stand still and take your<br/>
&gt; beating! we got healers :)&quot;.<br/>

God, I hate it when they run. The fighter types then<br/>
have to chase all around trying to catch the mob so<br/>
that they can hit it and taunt it off the silly caster<br/>
who...  (the rest deleted for politeness sake) Its ok<br/>
to take ONE step back , and then another if that didnt<br/>
work. but STAY PUT... and dont forget while you are<br/>
running around, you are probably also running out of<br/>
the healers range. :)<br/>
