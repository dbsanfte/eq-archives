&gt; I am quite sure...  I was weaving Anthem, Guardian and Elemental Rythms.  I<br/>
&gt; definitely verified that Guardian and Elemental stacked because I tested MR<br/>
&gt; with and without my drum playing one, the other and both.  I did not check<br/>

Chant of Battle (percussion) does not stack with GR (also<br/>
percussion).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Purifying and Guardian do stack.  AFAIK, Guardian stacks with<br/>
anything except Chant of Battle - Elemental and Purifying<br/>
Rhythms, and all the Psalm series stack with Guardian.  ER,<br/>
PR, and the Psalm series do not stack with each other though.<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t played that in a while (probably should dust it off and try it at<br/>
&gt; 20th though).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At 33 and a mistmoore battle drum, it was +26 (+25?) to str<br/>
and dex, and +8 (+7?) to AC.  In contrast, Anthem is only +21<br/>
to str and a ~10% speedup (which is overridden by all the<br/>
enchanter&#39;s speedup spells I&#39;ve tested - everything but<br/>
Celerity).  The tanks in my groups love it, and usually start<br/>
comparing each others&#39; str and dex when I&#39;m playing it.  The<br/>
enchanter usually keeps augmentation on everyone (~15%<br/>
speedup), so Anthem ends up only being a str buff.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Bleh - a non-twinked L20 bard has better weapons than I do.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I need to get better weapons.  Doesn&#39;t help that my friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I aren&#39;t into camping...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I despise camping.  It&#39;s the main reason that I don&#39;t have a steady group.  I<br/>
&gt; get very restless very fast.  That&#39;s yet another reason I started a bard -<br/>
&gt; like a lot of the others on this list I like to travel around.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I finally picked up a silvery war axe last night - my first<br/>
weapon upgrade since L19 (I&#39;m 33 now).  I know what you mean<br/>
about camping - after the first couple rounds in the area, I<br/>
wanted to move on (even though it was my first time there).<br/>
The other folks wanted backup gear and trade items though,<br/>
since we rarely camp anything and thus have very little to<br/>
trade.  Then the kill stealers moved in and we left (when will<br/>
Verant realize how incredibly stupid it is for 1 player to be<br/>
able to kill steal from and ruin the enjoyment of the game for<br/>
10 players?).<br/>
