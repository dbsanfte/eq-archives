&gt; I&#39;d personally keep it. If you do sell it, you&#39;ll probably find yourself<br/>
&gt; going to runnyeye in 10-20 levels to go get it again. It may not seem that<br/>
&gt; useful right now, since you&#39;re not fighting that many spellcaster, but<br/>
&gt; that&#39;ll change pretty quickly. =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d tend to concur.  The crown is a very nice item.  250pp may<br/>
seem like a lot at your level, but it isn&#39;t really that much<br/>
later on.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still a sizable sum in<br/>
your mid 20s, but it&#39;s &quot;I just have to save up for it,&quot; not<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m never gonna be able to afford that.&quot;  Most folks in their<br/>
30s tell me they have over a thousand pp and nothing to spend<br/>
it on (I&#39;d be close to that except I&#39;m spending it on small<br/>
steel plate).<br/>

You should be able to trade the crown for a nice item if the<br/>
+resists don&#39;t really get you excited (I don&#39;t think they help<br/>
bards as much since we get a whole slew of resist raising<br/>
songs that are more effective than the spells).  Like maybe a<br/>
battle drum.  :-)  The crown is just into the difficult-to-<br/>
obtain range where high level folks will make trade-only<br/>
trades for it.<br/>
<br/>
The crown is on my L28 bard&#39;s list of items I&#39;d like to have<br/>
if you&#39;re curious how desirable it is.<br/>
