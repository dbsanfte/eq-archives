<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515253924">The other side of the coin, of course, is that anything that is *not* in that file is *not* in the game.<br/>
Which means that they have *no* bard songs being tested, and apparently *none* in development.  Some<br/>
classes have over 30 spells listed.  Ours has zero.  Just how much attention does anyone think they have<br/>
expended on bards?  My guess is just about that.  Zero.<br/>
<br/>
As I get higher up in level, and take a look at the effectiveness of our songs vis-a-vis the parent<br/>
classes from which they are derived, the order and level at which we get them, and the conflicts they have<br/>
both with themselves and with other&#39;s spells, I am more and more convinced that this class was slapped<br/>
together in a hurry, the songs that proved over-powerful were massively nerfed to knock them down, and the<br/>
large number of underpowered songs were not increased to compensate.  This is a fun class, but can anyone<br/>
here really tell me that there is any other caster or hybrid at high levels who would not be a better<br/>
choice for a party except in certain very rare and limited circumstances?  If you do, I&#39;ll tell you why<br/>
you&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that they have apparently expended no significant energy of any sort on bard songs for the<br/>
expansion suggests to me that we are going to get more of the same.  I mean heck, they don&#39;t even have<br/>
songs in that file to fill in the *missing* slots, do they?  What does that tell you?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m cranky today because, after our guild failed miserably to take out Vox on Saturday, the guild<br/>
discussion has started to suggest that, in our next attempt, we should not include bards at all!<br/>
Apparently our melee is too pathetic to mention (no surprise), and the belief is that tying up a whole<br/>
slot with someone whose only purpose is to sing two resist songs is a big waste of space when they could<br/>
have a Cleric instead.  This when, as far as I was concerned, our resist songs are our greatest strength<br/>
at this level.  I really hate playing a character type to level 45 only to find that my primary purpose in<br/>
life is to spend most of my time singing a song that is only slightly more effective than a long-term<br/>
spell that a single Enchanter can use to buff 20 separate casters with, and the rest of my time chipping<br/>
away at 4000 hp mobs 20 points at a time.  You know how long it takes to solo one light blue kobold?<br/>
&quot;Sing the mana song.&quot;  Bah.<br/>
<br/>
They better have songs for bards.  And they certainly better not give us one every two levels for a total<br/>
of five, as I have seen suggested on several other postings, either.<br/>

&gt;   95% of what is listed in that file is live and in the game.  To suggest<br/>
&gt;   that half of it won&#39;t make it to final is pure speculation on your part.<br/>
&gt;   And that&#39;s what this all boils down to.  Everyone&#39;s best guess. </span></blockquote></div>
