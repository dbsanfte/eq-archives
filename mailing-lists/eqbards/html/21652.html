 </span></blockquote>Depends on where you&#39;re hunting. The forest giants in the Frontier Mtns <br/>
don&#39;t remember their last command when you are having them fight each <br/>
other. However, they do remember if they are fighting other things. So it <br/>
may be good to have giant vs brute battles (kinda like watching one of <br/>
those Japanese monster movies)<br/>
<br/>
In the Dreadlands, I have had pretty decent luck getting the various <br/>
steeps, craigs, and braes to attack each other by always keeping just 1 <br/>
charmed and not switching targets. It seems like if I just charm 1 target <br/>
and then switch only if my target is about to die, I can keep them targeted <br/>
on each other about 75% of the time (not really quantified, just an <br/>
approximate guess).<br/>
<br/>
I run into problems when I charm the other one instead, as my previous pet <br/>
seems to remember how much he hates me and chases me all around the snowy <br/>
tundra despite having my new pet beat his head in.<br/>
<br/>
But just like in FM, I have no problems with my targets aggroing on each <br/>
other if they aren&#39;t both giants. Spiders vs yetis vs drolvargs vs giants, <br/>
they all hate each other and forget about me as soon as charm kicks in.<br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
<br/>
As for what to do when both forget about each other and come after you even <br/>
after you have charmed one, I have my &quot;target nearest npc&quot; key set at #1 on <br/>
my number keypad. After I get a charm to stick, I immediately turn back on <br/>
selo&#39;s, target the other creature, and instead of running directly away <br/>
from them run at a path roughly perpendicular to their incoming path, then <br/>
mash the &quot;pet attack&quot; key.<br/>
<br/>
Either my pet will get close enough to hear it and start attacking, or my <br/>
path is at a shallow enough path that the other giant is just barely able <br/>
to hit me before I get out of his range. That gets my pet on him one way or <br/>
the other.  I suppose if you are a master charmer, before you charm, get a <br/>
consonant chain on your intended victim, switch targets and charm your now <br/>
faster pet, and give him his order without getting beaten on. I&#39;ve tried <br/>
this a little bit, but after twisting for a few hours just find this a bit <br/>
too tricky.<br/>
<br/>
You still get beat up pretty good at times, and the 1 fatality I&#39;ve had (in <br/>
a long time) was because I had 2 steeps and a brae on me and between their <br/>
stuns and interruptions of my songs, couldn&#39;t get away. Now I find when I <br/>
get in a tough spot like that, I just run out of their aggro and zone/camp <br/>
and return.<br/>
