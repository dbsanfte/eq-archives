<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126099486">Its unbelievable how many times this arguement is used.  It seems to work<br/>
well for everything.  Does it matter if people are duplicating singing steel<br/>
breastplates?  Does it hurt me in any way?  Does it matter if people are<br/>
exploiting monsters?  Does it hurt me in any way?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes and no.  Me, personally, I could care less.  I&#39;ve completely moved<br/>
beyond planar armor, so I couldn&#39;t possibly care less what people are doing<br/>
in the planes.  But does it effect people?<br/>
I&#39;m going to argue yes it does.<br/>
For the majority of the players, EQ is a game designed 90% around items.  In<br/>
a game with no end like EQ, the main way to actually feel that you are<br/>
making progress is by acquiring items.  Argue whatever you like, EQ is an<br/>
item based game.  Maybe not for everyone, lots of people just like to<br/>
roleplay and have fun, but the vast majority of the population likes to<br/>
aquire items.  Just look at how many posts you see saying &quot;I just got item<br/>
XX&quot; with dozens of replies saying &quot;Wow, congrats!&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with this, we all like to get shiney new<br/>
toys, its one of the things that makes the game fun.<br/>
<br/>
Now, how do farmers affect us?  Well, to most, planar armor is a badge of<br/>
armor.  By wearing it, you&#39;re essentially saying &quot;I&#39;ve been to the planes,<br/>
I&#39;ve fought hard, look at what I&#39;ve accomplished.&quot;  To this day, planar<br/>
armor isn&#39;t exactly common, and wearing it sets you apart from the vast<br/>
majority of the EQ population.  It says in its own little way that you&#39;ve<br/>
accomplished something different, maybe accomplished more than a lot of<br/>
people.  Planar armor can be worn with pride, knowing you paid the price for<br/>
it many times over in blood.  People who can obtain this armor with<br/>
absolutely no effort, in effect, living off the hard work of others cheapens<br/>
the value of it.  Suddenly it doesn&#39;t mean so much to be decked out with a<br/>
shiney new planar BP, when anyone can go in, and obtain the exact same thing<br/>
by sitting on their asses for hours on end while a ranger pulls mobs one at<br/>
a time as they pop.<br/>
<br/>
All this being said, this is how the planes are designed.  The fault lies<br/>
with Verant.<br/>

Why does it matter if people come in after your guild clears out fear?  Are<br/>
they hurting you in any way?</div>
