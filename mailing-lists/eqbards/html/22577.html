Yes, that is my thinking as well because of the primary hand bonus,<br/>
however post-50 paladins and shadowknights remain capped at 200 in offense<br/>
and weapon skills, whereas bards continue to grow.  This is what I intend<br/>
to test at 60, whether an offense of 230 (this being estimate, offense cap<br/>
was raised from 200+((level-50)*2)) and a weapon skill cap of 230 are<br/>
enough to outdamage the primary hand bonus.<br/>

&gt; Double Attack is twice as good as Dual Wield due to the way offhand damage<br/>
&gt; bonuses work.  This might not hold true below 30th level and definitely<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t hold true below 20th level when the damage bonuses kick in.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 1.  The Bard&#39;s offense sucks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used to think that bardic melee was less than SK/Paladin level due to<br/>
&gt; the lack of double attack, but now I&#39;m reconsidering.  Our offense caps<br/>
&gt; are significantly higher than theirs, and I&#39;m looking forward to testing<br/>
&gt; to determine who&#39;s output is higher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The problem is &quot;the situation&quot;.  There are 7 things that high-level<br/>
Kunark<br/>
&gt; parties need:  1) crowd<br/>
&gt; &gt; control, 2) primary healer, 3) a tank, 4) a puller, 5) a group gater<br/>
&gt; (sometimes), 6) a lockpicker<br/>
&gt; &gt; (sometimes), 7) secondary healer (sometimes).  The bard can&#39;t do any of<br/>
&gt; these things other than limited<br/>
&gt; &gt; crowd control, or pulling (which doesn&#39;t allow him to play the downtime<br/>
&gt; reducing role), which means that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he doesn&#39;t satisfy any of the core requirements.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a common mistake that many run into.  People see that deep in<br/>
&gt; dungeons an enchanter, evaccer, and cleric are all required and think<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re always required.  There&#39;s tons of stuff you can do that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; take any of these.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m often the group&#39;s puller due to a combination of knowledge of the area<br/>
&gt; and Lament.  When I am, I sing Cantata through battles to help with mana<br/>
&gt; levels, because in these situations there usually isn&#39;t an enchanter<br/>
&gt; either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shamans are the best group makers.  There is next to no need for a cleric<br/>
&gt; with turgur&#39;s.  A shaman friend and I often do the zone-in area to<br/>
&gt; Charasis, we can hold down 8 spawns before they start returning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And get ready for the best change since Kunark was released: Song of<br/>
&gt; Twilight works!  I played crowd control/puller for a group of five in the<br/>
&gt; north wing (bard, war, war, dru, cler), and was able to lock down three<br/>
&gt; mobs at once during a particularly bad period of respawning of wanderers<br/>
&gt; that lasted a good six minutes to get under control.  Further testing on a<br/>
&gt; clearing to Trak&#39;s lair revealed Song of Twilight works on anything an<br/>
&gt; enchanter can dazzle (ilis, krup, shrooms &lt;56, not jugs).  Charm has hit<br/>
&gt; the back burner now (I hate having to get hit every 10 seconds to maintain<br/>
&gt; control), the power is back on.<br/>
