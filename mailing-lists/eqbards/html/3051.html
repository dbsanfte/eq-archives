<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103866937">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice, perhaps I&#39;ll tough it out until I&#39;m a little<br/>
higher in level.  But the lack of cash is killing me!<br/>
<br/>
I have no clue what I did to give me the faction rating I have.  I<br/>
entered Rivervale as a lowly level 2.  I hunted a bit in Faydark, then<br/>
traveled to Freeport ... hunted a tiny bit there but lag prevented me<br/>
from getting anything good really.  I did manage to get to level 2 and<br/>
get Discord.  And then I made the trek to Rivervale.  Perhaps it&#39;s the<br/>
deity I chose?  I can&#39;t remember which one I chose (although I usually<br/>
chose the nicest sounding one, lol ... I love Tunare and will chose her<br/>
if I have the choice).  When I arrived I conned &quot;apprehensive&quot; to every<br/>
npc but the innkeeper who conned disinterested but he won&#39;t sell or buy<br/>
from me anyways.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been killing bixies and those little goblin guys ... workers or<br/>
something like that ... anyways, they&#39;re very similar to those annoying<br/>
green men that roam everfrost.  lol<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and btw, I&#39;m a SHE not a he. &lt;g&gt;  I had to chuckle at the couple<br/>
posts that referenced me as a &quot;he&quot; or a &quot;him&quot;. ;-)  I&#39;m the cute little<br/>
redheaded woodelf running around Rivervale (Quellious) in the *very*<br/>
skimpy bathing suit the EQ developers dressed me in.<br/>
<br/>
Safe travels,<br/>
