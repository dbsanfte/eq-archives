<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325707316">As this was brought up publicly, I shall answer it publicly.<br/>
<br/>
- The entry fee is 10p not 100p Yeesh! I wonder where that mis-info came<br/>
from...<br/>
- We have YET to charge monthly dues, mostly because everyone contributes<br/>
freely and willingly to the guild treasury out of a generous spirit.<br/>
- The entry fee is relatively tiny. We will NEVER pay for our guild hall 10p<br/>
at a time, and it doesn&#39;t go very far to providing services to new members.<br/>
It&#39;s mostly a barrier of entry so that we know a new member is relatively<br/>
interested in being part of the guild. I should state further that the REAL<br/>
barrier of entry to The Soerbaird is in some duties a new student must<br/>
perform. All of this can be found on the web site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>
<br/>
The Soerbaird is not just a guild of cronies, and we seldom group together<br/>
to &quot;level&quot;. We are a guild of writers, performers and contributors to the<br/>
citizenry of Norrath. We aren&#39;t out there to provide a resource or directive<br/>
to other bards either. Because we aren&#39;t a gamer&#39;s guild, we don&#39;t have a<br/>
large number of members. <br/>
<br/>
The Soerbaird isn&#39;t for everyone, and because of our entry requirements (the<br/>
non-financial ones), we tend to scare off the faint of heart - which is a<br/>
good thing. We have an agenda, which is narrow and focused, and we try not<br/>
to be sidetracked too much by the competitive aspects (gaming) of Norrath.<br/>
Our desire is to be the elite performers and historians of Norrath, and we<br/>
welcome anyone who passionately desires to be part of that effort. And I do<br/>
mean ANYONE. Not all of us are &quot;great writers&quot;. Many of us are learning from<br/>
each other. <br/>
<br/>
That said, I should point out that the majority of the members have a very<br/>
generous spirit. Example: (OOC) Recently, I had a corrupted player file<br/>
which pretty much destroyed me (and my equipment). I had to delete Dendall<br/>
and start over again (arrgg!). Once I had leveled back up to about 9th, my<br/>
fellows re-equipped me with about 80% of what I previously had - without me<br/>
even asking. I also took out a loan from our guild treasury - which I am<br/>
repaying with interest. This is something made possible by guild entry fees.<br/>
We have, from time to time, offered student loans to those interested in<br/>
starting a trade skill. <br/>

Soerbaird - I understand we have a member participating in this chain. I<br/>
love the idea behind your guild and I was actually considering applying,<br/>
however I don&#39;t understand why so much money is required to be a member.<br/>
Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, isn&#39;t it somewhere along the lines of 100pp to join<br/>
and a monthly fee besides? I am an officer in the largest and arguably<br/>
oldest online gaming guild (The Syndicate www.thesyndicate.org ) and we<br/>
don;t charge our members any fees. Understandably if Verant implements Guild<br/>
housing we will require fees to help fund a guild house, but currently there<br/>
is no reason to collect from our members, unless of course you&#39;re doing it<br/>
for &quot;future necessities&quot;.</div>
