<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269080784">Halana i&#39;m seeing this alot too, though i think the kunark zones seem to<br/>
like bards more, i can never find a group in guk or solb... kunark though i<br/>
send an ooc and get 10 tells back... i usually try to group with another<br/>
bard.  Last night was fun, we had a shaman root and 1 bard would mana and<br/>
the other would dot with the shaman. wasnt the fastest thing, but a nice<br/>
change from just always doing the same tactics<br/>

<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m a little confused on this.. do Bards REALLY have a more difficult<br/>
time grouping?<br/>
I mean, my wizard friend whines constantly that wizards are not really<br/>
needed, druids have whined that nobody likes to group with them, even as a<br/>
shaman  Ispend a lot of lonely nights.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe its not that people don&#39;t want bards but its just that some nights,<br/>
its impossible for anyone to get a group?  Or maybe not ?<br/>

&gt; I can just see this (try to think about it) ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If bards are the best grouping class in all Everquest,<br/>
&gt; every group should love to have one.<br/>
&gt; But in the reality of Norath, a bard can hardly find a group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So something is wrong, and i know that&#39;s not the &quot;a bard can <br/>
&gt; hardly find a<br/>
&gt; group&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nothing to say more.<br/>

&gt; Objet : [eqbards] Abashi&#39;s response to a very well thought out post<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, although it was one of the most thoughtful posts I have <br/>
&gt; seen in a long<br/>
&gt; time, it got the usual treatment from VI.  Here was Gordon&#39;s response.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I&#39;ll leave in-depth determination of &quot;role&quot; to those <br/>
&gt; playing it, I<br/>
&gt; think that you&#39;ve answered your own question here. Bards are <br/>
&gt; good at so many<br/>
&gt; things, you&#39;re surely here to do some of those things. I feel <br/>
&gt; that Bards<br/>
&gt; excell at making a good group better. That&#39;s my opinion. What&#39;s more<br/>
&gt; important though is, what is a bard&#39;s role to you? If you <br/>
&gt; look at it as a<br/>
&gt; walking-talking mana battery, there&#39;s not really much I can <br/>
&gt; do to make you<br/>
&gt; feel better about it. It&#39;s the same issues with the clerics who often<br/>
&gt; complain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery. <br/>
&gt; You are a support<br/>
&gt; class. You support the group, and you do it very well. <br/>
&gt; Whether or not you<br/>
&gt; are happy with that role is up to you. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Gordon <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pretty pathetic in my opinion.  Obviously Gordon just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a huge difference between the satisfaction one gets <br/>
&gt; from saving a<br/>
&gt; comrade&#39;s life (virtual or not) and the satisfaction of <br/>
&gt; knowing that the<br/>
&gt; druid can get off one more Careless Lightning because you <br/>
&gt; stood around and<br/>
&gt; played mana battery.  What a joke.  Obviously in VI&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &quot;Vision&quot; bards are not<br/>
&gt; meant to be real characters.  Our role is solely to support <br/>
&gt; other&#39;s efforts.<br/>
&gt; They should have called the class &quot;Sidekick&quot; instead.<br/>
