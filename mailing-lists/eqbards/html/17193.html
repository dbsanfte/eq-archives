<b>Subject:</b> PvP as a solution to 50&#39;s doldrums (Was Attack Speedups) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320881640">I agree, but many people do not enjoy PvP except as a way to control<br/>
nastiness (IE:  He kill steals so I kill him).  I don&#39;t enjoy PvP just for<br/>
the sake of PvP.  What you said about large scale events, however, is very<br/>
true.  Those can be incredible fun and a great way to enhance an already fun<br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer the multiplayer venue for the Co-Op aspect.  I don&#39;t like the PvP<br/>
aspect except as a roleplaying outlet.  IE:  I&#39;m an evil nasty shadowknight,<br/>
you&#39;re a goodie too shoes paladin... die scum!  Or wars, etc.   Or self<br/>
defense or dealing with a situation where force is the only answer.   PvP<br/>
allows players to police themselves, to an extent.<br/>
<br/>
I think it might help his situation but it wouldn&#39;t solve burn-out.  You can<br/>
delay it, but eventually ANY game gets old.  The biggest thing about<br/>
burn-out, I think, is the overcrowding.  My solution was to move to the<br/>
PvP-Teams servers.  They&#39;re never crowded and a lot of fun.  Plus they&#39;re a<br/>
great environment for my guild to have player events without having to jump<br/>
through hoops and get GM&#39;s involved for PvP...  Light VS. Dark battles are a<br/>
snap here.<br/>

&gt; PvP games have better potential for open ended interest.  Playing against<br/>
&gt; human brains is a lot more fun than against NPC&#39;s that do the same thing<br/>
&gt; over and over. (I wish my friends would have switched to PvP server about<br/>
48<br/>
&gt; levels ago but we decided to stay on Innoruuk.)  There is no dynamic to EQ<br/>
&gt; NPC&#39;s.  Once you find out what they do, you can rely on them to do it<br/>
onver<br/>
&gt; and over again.  In the PvP games that I have played, you can do<br/>
obstensibly<br/>
&gt; the &quot;same thing&quot; over and over yet each time it can be different and<br/>
unique.<br/>
&gt; I am talk about the games where you are on more or less equal terms in<br/>
&gt; &quot;equipment&quot; but the &quot;skills&quot; depend on the person and their ability to<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; the game.  Games where you have to make decisions in battle and the<br/>
&gt; situation is dynamic.  And the dynamics come from having real live<br/>
thinking<br/>
&gt; people as opponents vs pre-programmed NPC&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; EQ has great potential for PvP in role playing situations but my year has<br/>
&gt; been spent on an NPC server so I have seen very little of that.  On the<br/>
&gt; other hand, I have been in &quot;scenarios&quot; in other games where you have 1000<br/>
&gt; registered players and each plays a &quot;role&quot; (not talking with accents but<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; a tactical role in planned combat.)   These have been the most<br/>
entertaining<br/>
&gt; events I have been part of.  EQ could do alot more of this to develop<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; &quot;GM Events&quot; or &quot;large scale events.&quot;  And we hashed this all out here<br/>
&gt; before.  You need it to be &quot;staged&quot; in out of game venues (web pages,<br/>
&gt; discussion forums, assigned team leaders, pre-planned actions) all this so<br/>
&gt; people know where to go and what to do once they get online and want to<br/>
kill<br/>
&gt; stuff.  Think of 2 teams of 6 full groups starting on opposite sides of<br/>
&gt; Rathe Mts with the objective of securing some designated spot like the<br/>
&gt; burned out fortress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have dueled, you know that the combat technique is alot different<br/>
&gt; from soloing or grouping vs NPC&#39;s (you get to use all kinds of different<br/>
&gt; songs - and some of them actually work.)  But do any of us have<br/>
significant<br/>
&gt; experience in &quot;guildwar&quot; combat?  Where multiple groups of comparable<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; and equipment face off to accomplish some tactical and or strategic goal?<br/>
&gt; Fighting against other people provides for a more dynamic combat and thus<br/>
&gt; holds interest much longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the stuff you mention about how characters have become one-dimensional<br/>
&gt; at the high levels - I pretty much agree with.  The way they have designed<br/>
&gt; the higher levels where multiple group combat is necessary kind of forces<br/>
&gt; this situation even more.  There is no &quot;west karana&quot; for level 50&#39;s to<br/>
shout<br/>
&gt; for a group and go hunt &quot;tormented, undead, rotting, tentecle, thought<br/>
&gt; ravishing, bixie commanders.&quot;   Maybe expansion has these - 20 new<br/>
dragons?<br/>
&gt; Zones larger than West K? Hmmm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fighting NPC&#39;s relies on them to make new npc&#39;s.  Fight other people can<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; different each time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You don&#39;t understand.  I&#39;ve already done all that, made those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decisions and adjustments countless times, and figured out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near-optimal solutions.  Starting a twink would just be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; treading the same ground.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; You have played to 50 on PvP?  Your enchanter is 50?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; PvP doesn&#39;t appeal to me in this type of game.  Presumably you<br/>
&gt; &gt; want player versus player conflict to determine who is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; better player.<br/>
