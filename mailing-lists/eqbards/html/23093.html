<br/>

Thanks Bril, and others for the Kedge advice.  :)  I&#39;m going to see if I can<br/>
put together a group of my guildies willing to risk this place.  I really<br/>
wanna do it.  :)  <br/>

Kedge: Atonal you Do not want to be the EB for a KK group, your place is<br/>
keeping Stam up with jig and tossing in whatever else is good for group. Get<br/>
a druid to EB and time it religiously, get a mage that can summon water<br/>
stones and give everyone several to start, etc, timing the eb is of the<br/>
utmost importantce til you get ss gloves or fishbones. First floor just past<br/>
the zone in has mid 30s fishies. Remember this is a true 3D zone! Fish can<br/>
be above And below you. Stay out of the well down to the second floor til<br/>
high 30&#39;s to 40&#39;s and pretty skilled underwater group. The very bottom of<br/>
the well has a pack of really hard hitting pirahnas and there&#39;s a couple of<br/>
sharks on the second floor itself that are just as mean. The sharkskin drum<br/>
is insanely rare and does still have a lute graphic.<br/>
<br/>
Tamborine: Yes, I&#39;m 54 and still 2 coins shy of that thing! I&#39;ve been<br/>
lugging that silly box around forever it seems. Finally a druid foraged the<br/>
EJ one for me during the raid on the dragon there this weekend. No failed<br/>
raiders up in Kaesora last night though. Still need to take out a scorp as<br/>
well, keep trying to talk the group into bagging one on our way into Howling<br/>
Stones but they&#39;ve been in a rush to get in everytime so far. I never log in<br/>
and hang out, consequently I have a bank full of old armor and dropped<br/>
spells and assorted stuff that could be sold or traded. If I don&#39;t log the<br/>
bard in expressly to go do something, we go play twinks or move stuff<br/>
between characters and then go do something. (4 accounts between the 2 of<br/>
us, now that&#39;s addiction!)<br/>
<br/>
HE Clerics: my baby cleric is a shameless twink, cleric quest armor exept<br/>
for arms and bracers. Of course it&#39;s a bit heavy but better than bronze!We<br/>
have them somewhere, just not sure which char/account! Strength is her main<br/>
issue, but I knew that as my mate is a HE cleric. She looks good though, and<br/>
that&#39;s majorly important! I can always steal the TBB from our Erudite pally<br/>
twink, hehe.<br/>
