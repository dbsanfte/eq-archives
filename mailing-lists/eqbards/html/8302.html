&gt;Here&#39;s an idea:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When being stalked by an unscrupulous 16 year old, get the stalker&#39;s name <br/>
&gt;and log out. Now log back in using your ogre female. Find the stalker and <br/>
&gt;turn the tables on them, i.e. follow them around, make suggestive <br/>
&gt;statements, etc. This will surely frighten them off and give them an idea of <br/>
&gt;how their actions affect others. Don&#39;t push it too far, i.e. harassment, <br/>
&gt;just enough to make your point. You might even role play it a bit to make it <br/>
&gt;fun. <br/>
