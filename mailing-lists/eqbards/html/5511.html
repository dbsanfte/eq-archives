I finally found him again. And apparently learned the<br/>
secret to getting him to spawn (spoiler below). But I&#39;ve<br/>
done the quest 3 times (once for me and then once in a<br/>
group with two other friends) and am KOS in the bar now.<br/>
Guess if I ever wanna do it again I&#39;ll have to have someone<br/>
else give him the phrase that pays and make him leave the<br/>
bar.<br/>

There&#39;s a guard that wanders outside the bar by the<br/>
docks that if you talk to, he asks if you&#39;re like<br/>
that stinky dwarf or whatever. If you talk to him,<br/>
then ask about his kind - Trumpy appears almost<br/>
instantaneously in the bar (assuming he&#39;s not already<br/>
walking around somewhere). From what I was able to<br/>
tell, 3 times and then you&#39;re KOS in the bar by<br/>
Trumpy&#39;s buddies - which isn&#39;t a big deal, except<br/>
that the bouncer comes after you for causing trouble<br/>
in the bar.</div>
