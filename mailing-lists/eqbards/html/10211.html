<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346973043">Well, best I can tell it is NOT consistent, but:<br/>
<br/>
root will be broken if you are already playing selo&#39;s, and you get a &#39;luck<br/>
roll&#39;<br/>
... if you start selo&#39;s and get a REALLY &#39;lucky roll&#39;<br/>
<br/>
most of the time though, i have been rooted by ghouls and have not been able<br/>
to break it via selo&#39;s<br/>
I know of at least 3 times in the last 2 weeks that it HAS broken root (I am<br/>
moving, but root icon is still on display)<br/>
<br/>
They may have put in some code to make it highly unlikely to break root, but<br/>
still possible.  Would this fall under GZ&#39;s statement about 5% to 95% chance<br/>
rule, maybe?  There might be some chance to break root, but not 100% as was<br/>
the case some time ago.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there (John Kim?) wanna test this theory?  I don&#39;t get enough<br/>
play time to do much testing :(  Been playing since about the 3rd day of<br/>
release, and am still only level 19.<br/>

&gt; I was able to break root a few days ago while in Unrest...saved my<br/>
&gt; life it did...but since I was focusing more on getting to the zone<br/>
&gt; than testing a song, I can&#39;t say for sure whether or not it didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; just wear off.<br/>
