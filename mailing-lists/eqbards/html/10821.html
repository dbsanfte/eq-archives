<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The shard is dropped by the Kobold Predator in Solusek A. It&#39;s hard to <br/>
&gt; describe where he is located, but I can tell you he roams a short corridor <br/>
&gt; above the Foreman&#39;s room. There is a goblin placeholder there most of the <br/>
&gt; time. The corridor has a door that leads to a room with stairs. Down the <br/>
&gt; stairs and back around to the right leads to the Foreman&#39;s room.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The shard is a uncommon/rare drop, kobold hide boots are the common.<br/>
  I would guess the kobold is level 30ish.  He&#39;s definitely not as <br/>
  tough as the greater kobolds in SolB.  The corridor he wanders in<br/>
  is fairly close to the lavastorm entrance.  Most shamans see invis,<br/>
  and most goblins agro on any level player.<br/>
