 </span></blockquote>EQ has been crashing like that for me long before that patch.  I think I&#39;ve<br/>
narrowed it down to a defective AMD K6-2 chip.  When friends of mine (SB<br/>
Live owners) began crashing like I always do, I actually (with my sick sense<br/>
of humor :) found it comforting to see that I wasn&#39;t the only one!  LOL  I<br/>
feel bad coming back to a half dead party after a crash like that (even<br/>
worse than if it&#39;s just me that died).  To add to the frustration, my GF<br/>
plays on my network... when I go, she goes... A group losing 2 members at<br/>
once is never a good thing.  Nice to see my friends get some unintentional<br/>
payback at me!<br/>
