  But we will see what they tinkered with and report it I&#39;m sure.<br/>

***UPDATE MESSAGE***<br/>
<br/>
This morning&#39;s update consisted primarily of server-side changes to<br/>
improve performance of the game engine in general.  However, there are<br/>
several changes to note:<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Changes*<br/>
<br/>
- Skin Like Nature has had its damage shield removed and has regained its<br/>
regeneration component.  We&#39;re certain this time :)<br/>
- Many Shaman buff spells have had their recast delay removed.  You can<br/>
now cast them on multiple people without having to wait between each cast.<br/>
- The Wizard spell &quot;Rend&quot; was improperly saving versus cold.  It now saves<br/>
versus Magic.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Bug Fixes and General Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
The spawning problem in Solusek&#39;s Eye (SoldungA), related to the spawn of<br/>
the Clockwork gnomes, will be fixed later today in a zone patch.  <br/>
<br/>
The +/= key will no longer take screenshots. <br/>
<br/>
You can now adjust your clipping plane by using the SHIFT/- and SHIFT/+<br/>
key combinations. <br/>
<br/>
You can now view the Message of the Day by typing /motd.<br/>
<br/>
Corrected a bug in the /follow process that would cause your character to<br/>
loop around to the right at times when following someone.<br/>
<br/>
Corrected a bug that would cause item-loss associated with trading a<br/>
container marked LORE. <br/>
<br/>
Corrected some grouping bugs that had the potential to cause the client to<br/>
crash. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Feign Death and Pets*<br/>
<br/>
The Feign Death spell will no longer wear off.  This change had been made<br/>
due to an issue that was discovered that allowed Necromancers to solo<br/>
creatures while feigned and AFK.  The change had some unintended effects,<br/>
as we discovered that there are a few cases where someone could be<br/>
legitimately feigned for a longer period. Instead of having the spell wear<br/>
off, any summoned pet will automatically suicide 2 minutes after its owner<br/>
feigns.  This is the solution requested by most of the players who voiced<br/>
an opinion, and should serve the same goal as the original change.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
