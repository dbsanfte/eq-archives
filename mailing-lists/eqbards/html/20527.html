<b>Subject:</b> Mistmoore and Dark elf camp in Lesser Faydark <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-68471824">We were helping some guild mates in Mistmoore yesterday, and other than the<br/>
typical problems with trains had a terrific day.  Granite, cauldrons, 2<br/>
diamondine earrings, Mistmoore shield, Sacrificial dagger, Nightshade wreath, 2<br/>
Crested Spaulders, and more gypsy lutes and werewolf talons than we could use<br/>
;P.<br/>
<br/>
We were headed back up to the bath to wait for Xicotl and I saw the Dhampyre on<br/>
tracking, so we headed that way.  Oops, undead saw through invis, so we were at<br/>
zone regrouping and then...he was trained to zone, and folks zoned out.  I<br/>
jumped in, killed him, looted, and.....Yay! a Hooded Black Cloak to call my<br/>
own!  Felt good to get it myself :).<br/>
<br/>
It looked to me as if the drop rates were increased in Mistmoore; maybe we were<br/>
just there a long time hehe.<br/>
<br/>
After we finished we decided to wander over to that camp and try our luck.  My<br/>
husband Knight (54 paladin) started pulling the Teir&#39;Dal Elites, which were all<br/>
green to us.  Good faction adjusts though, I remember Emerald Warriors was one.<br/>
<br/>
Then we pulled Priestess Llandra, who is blue to us both.  The two of us chased<br/>
her all over Lesser Faydark with chains/fear.  The fight took at least 5<br/>
minutes.  Man she has a lot of HP!  I wasn&#39;t sure if she was a quest mob or<br/>
not; I looked today and she is.  She dropped about 9 gold hehe.  Clerics of<br/>
Tunare was one faction that improved.<br/>
