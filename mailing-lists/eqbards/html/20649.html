well he hits for 630 damage, his poison dot does an initial 1500 damage i<br/>
think, plus 150 per tick for 10 ticks.  i have only lived 1 of 8 trak kills<br/>
and i was in FV when i heard about my BP, but it&#39;s a great feeling wearing<br/>
it :)  and now that we can kill Venril Sathir again (last night for the<br/>
first time since he was buffed) i got a chance at legs and a full set of<br/>
singing steel minus the bracer.<br/>

p.s. on our most recent trak raid, much to my shock i learned that a gnome,<br/>
the vile Xaxe, had been admitted into the Powa clan, sworn enemies of the<br/>
evil Keplegrobs and all things gnomish!  it broke my heart to leave the clan<br/>
of which i was so proud, but it was tainted and i could stay no longer.<br/>
