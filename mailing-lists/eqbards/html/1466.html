the beauty of EverQuest simultaneously with RogerWilco running, and so all<br/>
I sent was *FDHFY#YQRH# FNDJF#*RF&FY* :(  I could hear fine, but was<br/>
sending garbage - so I deleted it.  The group I was partying with at the<br/>
time was remarkably well organized (if a bit quiet), due to this system,<br/>
and we were able to do a lot more (though I&#39;m sure I slowed them down a bit).<br/>
