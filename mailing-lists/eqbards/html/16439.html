&gt; Do you want them to set a timer and snare every 30 seconds? Every 60<br/>
&gt; seconds?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you expect out of your snarer to not call them lazy?<br/>

  Snare lasts at L30 lasts about 2 mins.  You are smoking crack<br/>
  if you think, as a druid, you can cast snare at the beginning<br/>
  of combat and expect it to last until the monster dies every<br/>
  fight.  Sometimes it takes longer than 2 minutes to finish<br/>
  a battle, sometimes it takes longer because you are engaging<br/>
  multiple enemies.  Regardless of any excuses a druid would<br/>
  like other people to believe, if the monster runs near the<br/>
  end of the battle the druid has /not/ done their job, and <br/>
  after 2 or 3 times of that, I would Disband them.<br/>
<br/>
  Lazy or not, verbal semantics aside...  I don&#39;t defend people<br/>
  who do not realize the scope of their duty regardless of<br/>
  excuses.  Btw, snare takes a whopping 15 mana to cast.<br/>
  Ouch, not like you can&#39;t med that in less than /5 secs/!!!<br/>

  Damn lazy powerleveling f&#39;ing druids. 8)<br/>
