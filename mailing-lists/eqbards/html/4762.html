<div id="ygrps-yiv-911082456">I just don&#39;t think they&#39;d ever give us that.  It&#39;s kind of the Diablo<br/>
syndrom.  They let us go into auto attack, but somehow didn&#39;t like the idea<br/>
of players just hitting a key and sitting back and relaxing while they<br/>
watched a battle.  Notice -every- class is doing something during a fight.<br/>
Even warrior types are bashing/kicking/taunting, and do not envy the clerics<br/>
who must stop targeting a mob, target the player in need, heal, retarget the<br/>
mob.  Just be thankful you don&#39;t have to click every time you swing, because<br/>
if we didn&#39;t have other things to do in battle, it&#39;s a safe bet we&#39;d be<br/>
doing that!<br/>
