<b>Subject:</b> What I do when I get bored of the regular server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-251877713">Greetings all,<br/>
What I do when I get bored is change to Vallon Zek, a pvp teams server.  I <br/>
am experimenting with a few different classes, but I have 2 bards at level 5 <br/>
(started half-elf bard in Kelethin &lt;only place to start a half elf bard <br/>
there&gt;). I have 2 bards because I started a half elf bard first on the first <br/>
week of release and couldn&#39;t get any Medium size armour in Kelethin.  So <br/>
that bard tweaked (hehe a level 5 tweaking a level 1) my Wood elf bard and <br/>
she leveled up quickly.<br/>
<br/>
The point is if some folks find that they get bored on their regular server, <br/>
doing the same old same old, then try a pvp server.  I have decided to try <br/>
to make an Troll Shadow Knight now.  His mission will be to kill casters <br/>
(most casters are Human and Elf based).  He will be a sort of anti-PK pk&#39;er. <br/>
  His MO will be to shadow step and hunt down those medding casters  :)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, ok....that is just an idea based on frustration, but it does add a whole <br/>
new dimension to the game.  If you have friends or guildmates that you could <br/>
convince to meet you with you on a pvp server, then you could watch each <br/>
other&#39;s backs, and hunt PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s alike.  And be hunted :)<br/>
<br/>
I am now level 40 on Cazic Thule server, and quite sick of waiting lists and <br/>
the like.  I also have a hard time with the Hill Giants, because I get them <br/>
fighting and some group or other will move in and kill em off for me :(   I <br/>
just want a short diversion.  Nothing permanent.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have a secondary character on the pvp servers?<br/>

to medding casters?)<br/>
