<div id="ygrps-yiv-842183661">Try it at night - you won&#39;t live to reach the other side of the zone.  It is<br/>
full of high level undead (30 to 45+) and things like enraged dread wolves<br/>
and nearly all of it casts nasty spells and has a huge aggro radius - it&#39;s a<br/>
BLAST!<br/>

&gt; Hmm, my run thru Kith was in day time hours.  What is in Kith for 30+?  I<br/>
&gt; thought the Invasion was a one time thing for the PoH debut.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for faster than anything in Norrath, have you raced Grimfeather lately?<br/>
&gt; Granted he&#39;s not in Kith but he&#39;s faster than my MM drums.  Also,<br/>
&gt; Shadowmen<br/>
&gt; are faster as well - I have heard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What fun is it if you are not scared? (The whole game I mean.)<br/>
