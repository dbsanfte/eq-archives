Some people (not necessarily on this list, but on the boards) seem to <br/>
be under the erroneous assumption that this is a fix for the Hybrid <br/>
EXP penalty.  It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s a fix for the horribly broken EXP <br/>
system we&#39;ve been playing under.  It benefits everybody.  Arguably, <br/>
the biggest boost for Hybrids is not the extra EXP they will attain <br/>
with each kill, but the fact that they&#39;ll have a MUCH easier time <br/>
finding EXP groups now that the group doesn&#39;t share their penalty.  <br/>
THAT, imo, was the biggest injustice of them all.  Many Hybrids would <br/>
have been willing to shoulder the whole load of their exp penalties, <br/>
because THEY chose it, and not burden the group with it.  Now, they <br/>
don&#39;t have to.. plus, they get a nice EXP bonus to go with it.</div>
