&gt; Try it on yourself.  Most of the time you will get the &quot;you<br/>
&gt; send forth music&quot; message and icon, but will not be stunned.  <br/>
&gt; If you wait for the icon to disappear, you will get the &quot;you<br/>
&gt; are no longer stunned&quot; message even though you were never<br/>
&gt; stunned!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It *is* broken.<br/>

&gt; it is not broken!  I used it in lguk 2 days ago.  We were over swarm by 3<br/>
&gt; mobs.  So I used pixie strike on one of them and he was standing still for<br/>
&gt; 10 second then started wacking again.  <br/>

randomly broken. i.e. Sometimes it works properly, sometimes it doesn&#39;t,<br/>
with no resist message to indicate it failed. That is broken.<br/>
