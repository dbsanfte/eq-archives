There&#39;s a kitchen upstairs in High Keep that sells cooking supplies.  Don&#39;t<br/>
they sell milk there?  All the other cooking supply vendors do.<br/>
<br/>
By the way (and I&#39;m dead serious), anyone who call tell me of any vendor in<br/>
any zone, regardless of the danger involved, that permanently sells &quot;snake<br/>
eggs&quot; I will come to your server, get a character started, earn 100pp and<br/>
give it to you along with a big wet kiss.<br/>
