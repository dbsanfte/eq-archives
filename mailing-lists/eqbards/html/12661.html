&gt;Heh, Gibs see invis to undead. Period. =)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Errr.... Not true.  I&#39;ve used ITU to walk past them several times with no <br/>
effect.  I&#39;ve also had them attack me twice when ITU was up.  This seems to <br/>
support the idea that they simply have a higher-than average intelligence <br/>
check against that spell, or that the &quot;random&quot; (hehehe) number generator <br/>
just acted up.<br/>
<br/>
Something else I have noticed - bardic invisibility seems to be superior to <br/>
any other single concealment spell (invisibility or invisibility to undead <br/>
spells) insofar as it fails less often.  Many&#39;s the time I&#39;ve wandered Cazic <br/>
or Unrest, dancing through the halls while around me monsters stood waiting. <br/>
  I don&#39;t ever recall anything in either of those zones seeing through my <br/>
invis.  Could be that our invisibility has a lower-than-average intelligence <br/>
check...<br/>
