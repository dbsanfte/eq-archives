<div id="ygrps-yiv-693348127">Actually, those necklaces are pretty common.  I&#39;ve seen 5 or 6 of them already.<br/>
I keep having to pass<br/>
them around to people since they&#39;re lore.<br/>
The earrings drop off about 1 of every 15 orcs (can drop off the oracle,<br/>
centurion or mystic).  The necklace<br/>
can also drop off the oracle or mystic.  The centurions can only drop the<br/>
earrings.<br/>
The Oracle also drops the Ry`gorr armor.  At least the boots, bracer, sleeves,<br/>
coif and collar (that&#39;s what<br/>
we&#39;ve seen so far at least)..   It looks VERY VERY cool on a bard.  It looks<br/>
like the old Hot Rod symbol.<br/>
It&#39;s a flame that covers the chest and goes down through the legs.  Probably the<br/>
best looking bard armor<br/>
I&#39;ve seen yet.  To get the BP and Legs, however, you have to go kill the<br/>
Chieftain (named mob) that spawns<br/>
at the Rygorr Fort in the middle of the zone.<br/>

Ladt night while camping the orc oracle in Eastern Wastes (near the bridge),<br/>
we had 3 of those nifty earrings drop (we were pulling cougars, griffs, etc)<br/>
and a *very* rare drop from the oracle, a necklace that was like AC 8 (or<br/>
was it AC 5?  Think it was 8), +3 str, and +2 dex.<br/>
<br/>
Loot is nice and randomized :o)<br/>
<br/>
Will prolly strike out on my own tonight (just under a bub and a half from<br/>
level) and try charm-kiting those roaming giants ;o)<br/>
