Break-in... <br/>
<br/>
Break-in can be one of 2 methods, and both work well, depending on the<br/>
skills of the groups. It can be either a rogue in the first group to scout<br/>
and tell when the zone-patrol has gone be so can get some safety on entry.<br/>
For this method, everyone must be invisible. As soon as you get in, move the<br/>
S wall of the room and camp (NOT /q, camp), then meet in a chat room. The<br/>
scout will still be in and talking to the group. The last group up usually<br/>
ports up about the same time that the scout has someone (usually someone<br/>
with 2 systems so in chat and on another character in-game, or someone on a<br/>
twink logs out to chat) tells the folks in chat to log in. Once everyone is<br/>
in, the fights start. <br/>
<br/>
The other method is 2 good groups head up at once and start fighting. The<br/>
next groups head up in pairs a few minutes apart (to keep from crashing the<br/>
zone with too many folks zoning into the same area all at once). This is the<br/>
much faster method, but is also more dangerous since the mobs in house 3<br/>
will aggro any roamers going by, who could aggro the mobs in house C, who<br/>
could... In any event, either method works well as I have been in on both. I<br/>
tend to prefer the fighting-break since less time spent, and the aggro mobs<br/>
in house C are not that frequent. <br/>
<br/>
Pulling... <br/>
<br/>
Pull team consists of a scout (the rogue), puller (fder), assister<br/>
(warrior), cleric, and 2 others. I prefer the 2 others to be enchanter and<br/>
another healer. I like an enchanter there so he/she knows what is coming in<br/>
since he may want to mez the first and hold it to fight the second. I like a<br/>
backup healer to help keep the assister and chanter alive, and to keep the<br/>
fder and ME alive.  <br/>
<br/>
The scout will do just that... scout. She will tell the fder what mobs are<br/>
where so as to avoid a lot of fd if possible, especially since the fd change<br/>
where higher mobs usually do not forget the fder. There are several key<br/>
vantage points to watch from, but most important until house C is clear is<br/>
to watch for aggro from there. When the puller pulls, tell him how many and<br/>
what he has. If he has 4 mobs, that is usually okay, unless it is 4 spites.<br/>
It is up to you as scout, the puller, and the chanter as to whether to bring<br/>
in the pull or let some of it get away. Don&#39;t worry if you miss some, they<br/>
will still be there. <br/>
<br/>
The puller pulls mobs. The usual fd spot is in the in corner of the L of<br/>
house 3 just N of the entry to house 1. As long as the fights are inside<br/>
house 1, mobs there will usually not aggro. Puller pulls to there and fds.<br/>
Then the assister, when told to pull, hits one with bow to pull it into the<br/>
room. If the way is clear behind the puller (what the scout watches for),<br/>
then the puller gets up and pulls some more. <br/>
<br/>
If there is only 1 mob in the fight room, be it the zone-in room or the SW<br/>
corner, then there are not enough mobs. A constant pull flow keeps everyone<br/>
busy and happy. It also clears the path the absolute best spot to pull to in<br/>
the zone... the Chapel (house D). <br/>
<br/>
Houses... <br/>
<br/>
House 1 is the zone-in house. In fact, you will zone in almost exactly where<br/>
the 1 is drawn on the map. There are no spawns in this room, but the<br/>
zone-patrol will walk right by the E wall (just outside the house). Unless<br/>
you are in the pull group or told otherwise, STAY AWAY FROM THE DOOR. The<br/>
pull team cannot get into and out of the room if everyone is crowded in the<br/>
doorway. And a fight there could aggro the other mobs the puller has. Also,<br/>
stay away from the N wall for a little while, as it could aggro some of the<br/>
surrounding areas or the mobs pulled to pull spot. The entrance is on the NW<br/>
wall facing N (just under the rectangle on the map on the left side of the<br/>
room... that rectangle is only a hall). <br/>
<br/>
House 2 has three spawns upstairs. One is always a box. The other two can be<br/>
abhorrents or ires. These do not aggro easily since all have short aggro<br/>
ranges, so pulling past them is usually okay. The usually do not aggro on<br/>
break-in, either. The only way the fights or pulls can aggro them is one of<br/>
the mobs with a large aggro range, then it will trigger them as well. It is<br/>
best to pull this room early. The entrance is on the N side. <br/>
<br/>
House 3 will always be pulled with the zone-patrol aggro. The mobs from<br/>
zone-patrol will aggro them, so at break-in, there will be no less than one<br/>
from zone-patrol and the two from this house. The two in this house are<br/>
usually an abhorrent and an ire. Entrance is on the W side. <br/>
<br/>
House 4 has a box upstairs. Do not pull this house until at least the first<br/>
half of house C is clear as it will aggro through the wall. Entrance is on<br/>
the NE side facing E (inside the L). <br/>
<br/>
House 5 has an abhorrent downstairs and an ire or abhorrent upstairs.<br/>
Upstairs will not aggro from a downstairs pull, but it will if you pull from<br/>
beyond house 5. If you do not pull upstairs here, it will autopull when you<br/>
pull past it anyway. Entrance is on the SW side facing W (looking at the<br/>
door to house 4). <br/>
<br/>
House 6 has a box and ire upstairs. These will not aggro from pulls around<br/>
them at all and are usually the only mobs left in the zone after a full<br/>
clearing. They can be pulled or just left. Pulls from here could aggro the<br/>
neighboring rev houses, so it is best to leave for a while. Entrance is on<br/>
the W side. <br/>
<br/>
House 7 has a spawn right by the door and two more in the back of the house<br/>
on the SE side. All three spots can be abhorrents or ires. Careful here as<br/>
the S roamers like to stop just outside the door to this house, and the N<br/>
roamers could stop just to the N of it. Entrance is on the far SW side<br/>
closest to house C facing SW. <br/>
<br/>
House 8 is not a house, but a fountain or well. It is only a landmark. <br/>
<br/>
House 9 is the ramp up to Innoruuk&#39;s chamber. I will cover level 2 later.<br/>
Ramp starts on E side. <br/>
<br/>
House A has a box and monk downstairs, and 2 abhorrents upstairs. The monk<br/>
will come as soon as you make a pull from anywhere near it, including the<br/>
chamber. The abhorrents are safe until you start pulling larger mobs past<br/>
it. The box may aggro on pulls, but has so short an aggro range it will<br/>
usually stay there. The entrance is on the SW side facing W. You can see the<br/>
box in the entrance. <br/>
<br/>
House B has an abhorrent and monk upstairs and the same downstairs. The<br/>
downstairs monk will always aggro from any pull nearby, especially the house<br/>
C pulls. The upstairs and the abhorrent downstairs are usually left for<br/>
later (especially since there have been so many abhorrents so far). Entrance<br/>
is on the W side.<br/>
<br/>
House C is generally called the Chamber or the Cleric House. This is the<br/>
first goal to be cleared (to prevent wall aggros). The entry is noted on the<br/>
map (right beside house A). guarding the entrance just inside are two<br/>
clerics. In the northern hallway (from the entrance to the NE corner), there<br/>
is a single roamer, but he can be anything on the spawn table. Usually, it<br/>
is a spite, rev (male or female), lich, monk, or ire, but I have even seen a<br/>
drake there. Just be careful and look before charging into the room. Mostly,<br/>
though, it is a spite or rev. In the far SE corner of the house is a throne,<br/>
and there is a cleric on either side of it. The central hall of house C<br/>
(between houses B and V) has 2 spawns, and both are roamers. One spawns on<br/>
the far west end of the hall and roams to the east end. The other spawns on<br/>
the far east end of the central hall and will roam all the way to the far<br/>
east wall of the house (close to house 2). These two can also be any mob on<br/>
the spawn table, but I mostly see rev, spite, ire, or lich on the east one,<br/>
and rev, lich, ire, spite, or drake on the west one. Be careful as the<br/>
drakes have a huge aggro range. A drake pull here could aggro a drake<br/>
upstairs, and that would be very bad. No real way to avoid it, but be<br/>
careful. The west side of the central hall has 2 clerics guarding the<br/>
passage (just inside the west side). There are also 2 roamers in the west<br/>
end of the house just below the stairs, and the roam from the stairs to the<br/>
central hall and back. They can be anything on the table, but I mostly see<br/>
lich, drake, or spite. Usually, if one roamer is in the corner near the<br/>
stairs, you can safely pull the other (once the 2 clerics are gone, that<br/>
is). In the far SW corner of the house, there is another roamer that stays<br/>
in that corner. I usually see lich or rat there, but have seen others also.<br/>
It is usually safe to pull from the west end and not get this guy, but he<br/>
does need to be killed. There is also a back entrance to the Chamber, noted<br/>
on the map on the W wall just above the SW corner. This is the door to pull<br/>
through when you camp SW corner. <br/>
<br/>
House C upstairs has the same floor plan as downstairs. All spots upstairs<br/>
can be anything on the table. There are two roamers at the top of the stairs<br/>
(NW corner), one in SW corner, two in the central hall, and four in the East<br/>
hall. NW stays in NW corner, SW in SW, and the central hall stay there. The<br/>
ones in the east end will roam from just above the entrance downstairs (near<br/>
house A) all the way to the SE corner. NW is usually revs, SW a lich,<br/>
central a monk or ire, and east is usually drake, spite, lich, and rat. But<br/>
again, anything can be in any spot. It could be all drakes. Of course, that<br/>
would be very unlucky for most, nice for any sks, but still.     In most<br/>
cases, the upstairs will not aggro from downstairs. However, if there is a<br/>
drake upstairs and down, they could overlap ranges and cause a chain aggro.<br/>
Usually, however, upstairs Chamber is left for later pulls. <br/>
<br/>
House D is the Chapel. There are also a lot of mobs in here, and almost all<br/>
of them are roamers. Once the Chamber is clear, you should work on the<br/>
Chapel so you can move camp. The SW corner of the Chapel is generally called<br/>
the Throne, and it is the next camp site (after Maestro is killed). This is<br/>
because it avoids most of the S patrol route, and there is a much much<br/>
better pathing from the rev houses (NE corner) to the Chapel than to the<br/>
zone-in room. That path does cross the N roamer route, but there are less<br/>
roamers on the N route than S. Chapel entry is guarded by two clerics. there<br/>
are also two clerics in the far SW corner beside the throne. The only other<br/>
static spawns in the Chapel are Maestro and his guards. <br/>
<br/>
The Chapel roamers all have specific roam and pull paths. There is one in<br/>
the SW (usually monk) corner that stays in that area, one in the corner on<br/>
the S wall closest to the entry (usually rev), one in the NE corner (usually<br/>
scorn), and one in the corner of the stairs (NE of the entry) (usually rev).<br/>
There is another one just S of Maestro (just N of house P) that roams from<br/>
that corner up to Maestro and back (usually abhorrent). Pull him when on the<br/>
S end of his route. And in addition to these area roamers, there are about<br/>
six or eight house roamers that will roam from near the throne area up to<br/>
near Maestro over to near the stairs. All roamers can be monk, abhorrent,<br/>
both revs, ire, lich, rat, scorn, or spite. There are specific paths for<br/>
each, but that is too much to put in this already long tutorial. <br/>
<br/>
The Chapel also has an upstairs, like the Chamber, but it is not a full<br/>
floor plan. There is a balcony overlooking the organ, so the 2nd floor is<br/>
cut off from the top of the stairs angled a little S over to above the<br/>
corner N of house P. At the top of the stairs, there is one roamer, usually<br/>
a rev or scorn. In the SW corner is one, usually cleric or spite. There is<br/>
also one in the SE corner, usually rev or lich. All three of these can be<br/>
anything but drakes. <br/>
<br/>
Maestro floats just in front of his organ in the far NW corner of the house.<br/>
He will have 4 personal guards, 2 on each side of him. In most cases, he<br/>
will be facing NW, but will turn to face his guards when they buff him. It<br/>
is safe to scout up behind him, but if facing you, he will aggro. His guards<br/>
are always spites or clerics, and can be any mix from all of one, to a mix,<br/>
or to all of the other. The entire Chapel, upstairs and down, plus some of<br/>
the surrounding houses must be pulled before he is or he will aggro<br/>
everything in his path. The best method for pulling him I&#39;ve seen is for the<br/>
scout to sit on the far east wall looking out between houses 5 and 6. Make<br/>
sure you are up the wall a little. The puller hits Maestro and runs to the<br/>
area in front of that alley and fds. Do not go in the alley or Maestro will<br/>
be too close to the scout and kill her. The assister would come out to the<br/>
corner by the totem and wait. When the scouts sees only Maestro above the<br/>
puller, she will give the word and the assister will shoot Maestro and pull<br/>
him into the zone room. For this to work takes timing, and the roamers must<br/>
be clear. The puller must stay down as the guards will probably still be<br/>
aggroed on him, but they should be back home. If they make it home, and the<br/>
scout will go there to make sure, then the puller can get up. If they do not<br/>
come then, the puller is safe to join the fun pounding on Maestro and the<br/>
scout can go poke some, too. There are a number of tactics to actually kill<br/>
him once pulled. This is only info on how to pull him. After he is dead, you<br/>
can safely pull his guards as will any pull to split. <br/>
<br/>
Once this is done, the raid usually moves camp to the Throne area of the<br/>
Chapel as noted before. The scout will scout the path, and the puller or<br/>
someone else will lead everyone there. If attacked along the way, do NOT<br/>
stop and fight. Keep running and take the mob to the Throne. If you fight in<br/>
the hall, more roamers could spawn on you or you could aggro something not<br/>
yet pulled. Once camp is reset, the puller and scout can get back to work<br/>
and pull everything else in the zone. <br/>
<br/>
House E has a male rev just inside the door and another all the way through<br/>
near the bottom of the stairs. There is a female rev at the top of the<br/>
stairs on the second floor. Entrance is on the N wall just above the E on<br/>
the map. <br/>
<br/>
House F has a rev outside just to the east of the entry and 2 more inside at<br/>
the bottom of the stairs. These are usually males, but could be either.<br/>
Entrance is on the N wall. <br/>
<br/>
House G has three revs in the far S corner, and they are usually female.<br/>
Entrance is on the far N wall. <br/>
<br/>
House H has one male rev downstairs. Entrance is on the SW corner facing<br/>
west. <br/>
<br/>
House I has a box in the NE corner and a rev in the nw corner. There is also<br/>
a rev upstairs. These can be either rev. Entrance is in the central N wall<br/>
facing N (middle of the U). <br/>
<br/>
House J has one rev downstairs and two more upstairs, and they can be male<br/>
or female. Entrance is on the W side. <br/>
<br/>
House K has one male rev in the SW corner downstairs and another upstairs.<br/>
Entrance is on the NW corner facing west. <br/>
<br/>
House L has a female rev downstairs and two more upstairs. Entrance is on<br/>
the NE corner <br/>
facing east (looking into house K). <br/>
<br/>
House M has box in the far NW corner. Entrance is on SW corner facing west. <br/>
<br/>
House N has two revs in the back (far southern tip of the house). Entrance<br/>
is on NW wall. <br/>
<br/>
House O has a scorn or monk. Entrance is on W wall. <br/>
<br/>
House P has a monk and scorn downstairs, and a scorn or monk with a box<br/>
upstairs. This house is usually cleared before completing the Chapel.<br/>
Entrance is on E wall. <br/>
<br/>
House Q has two monks or scorns downstairs and two upstairs. Entrance is on<br/>
W wall. <br/>
<br/>
House R has a monk or scorn downstairs and another upstairs. Entrance is on<br/>
far SE wall. <br/>
<br/>
House S has a box in the NW corner and a scorn or monk in NE corner. There<br/>
is nothing upstairs. But there are the corner spawns outside (monk and 2<br/>
clerics in SW zone corner). Entrance is in the center of the U. <br/>
<br/>
House T has nothing that I have ever seen. <br/>
<br/>
House U has a monk or scorn. Entrance is on NE wall facing east. <br/>
<br/>
House V has a monk or scorn upstairs. Entrance is on NW wall facing west. <br/>
For the revs, monks, and scorns, I have been as accurate as possible. So<br/>
don&#39;t count the mobs here and then what you find and say I am wrong. It is<br/>
nearly impossible for a rogue to get accurate scorn counts since they see<br/>
us. And the revs are done so seldom that I forget on them. But I think this<br/>
is almost perfect. <br/>
<br/>
Now, Up the ramp to Innoruuk... (House 9 on the map) <br/>
<br/>
At the top of the ramp, there are two drakes. They can be pulled without<br/>
aggroing anything else. Once at the top of the ramp, there are only four<br/>
doors you can go into. The one on the S side, closest to the ramp is a small<br/>
house. There is a monk, scorn, abhorrent, or spite upstairs in there. <br/>
<br/>
There are two entries on the east side of the courtyard up there, the S one<br/>
goes nowhere, the N one has a small house with 2 spawns, usually cleric,<br/>
rev, monk, or scorn. Careful with this one as it could aggro Innoruuk<br/>
through the wall (wall is close to the west T at the end of his hall). <br/>
<br/>
The entrance to the N of the area at the top of the ramp is Innoruuk&#39;s Hall.<br/>
The hall goes N, turns right and heads east, then turns south and goes to a<br/>
T that turns east and west, both of which dead end. There are two static<br/>
spawns guarding the door. They can be anything but drakes (though not seen a<br/>
rat there either). Within the hall, everything else, including Innoruuk<br/>
himself, will roam. Some will roam all the way to the entrance, but only as<br/>
deep as about half of the east hall going S. Others, including Innoruuk,<br/>
will roam only to the far NW corner of the Hall, but will go all the way<br/>
back to the T, and roam between the two ends of the T. The roamers can be<br/>
anything but drakes and rats. There are also 2 deep roamers back at the T,<br/>
and they are always drakes. <br/>
<br/>
Be very careful pulling the Hall. Inny will see sneaking. I have never even<br/>
been able to sneak behind him, though that is probably just my bad luck and<br/>
he turns around. And he will Death Touch. Every mob in the Hall except the 2<br/>
drakes in the back can be pulled without aggroing Inny. You just have to<br/>
watch for him and get out of his way. <br/>
Normal Inny pulling takes 3 people, the puller, the assister, the scout, and<br/>
the sacrifice. The scout will check on his location (best to pull him from<br/>
the NW corner near entrance so as to avoid aggroing the drakes in the back),<br/>
then get out of the way. The sacrifice will charge and take the DT. The<br/>
puller will then pull Inny and run for the Throne. If lucky and properly<br/>
buffed, he can make it back there. If not, the assister grabs Inny and pulls<br/>
him the rest of the way. Then you fight him. The scout then goes safely into<br/>
the hall and drags out the body of the sacrifice to be resed. <br/>
Pull order on all of the houses is up to the pull team and leader of the<br/>
raid. Please do NOT ask that some mob get pulled. If the pull team is a good<br/>
one, they will try their best to keep a very balanced set of pulls in order<br/>
to keep everyone happy. Revs are usually the last to be pulled, but if the<br/>
pull team is good, they can get a few of the rev houses before clearing the<br/>
Chapel. Houses U and V can also be pulled as soon as house C is clear, which<br/>
would help keep the bards and warriors happy. Any other pull notes, I have<br/>
made in the tutorial.<br/>
<br/>
Always use assist. If you start beating on a mezzed target, the enchanters<br/>
will start yelling and may even cut off your clarity or swift supply. Don&#39;t<br/>
make the dealers mad. <br/>
Only the puller and scout have SoW and are in run mode. Everyone else is in<br/>
walk with no speed. If you use wolf-form, make sure you are in walk mode at<br/>
least. If you get feared, you could end up on the NE corner or the NW<br/>
corner. If you get lost out there from fear, don&#39;t worry. The scout can find<br/>
you and take you back. If you are killed, no matter where you are killed,<br/>
the scout can find you and take you back for a res. If under Maestro or<br/>
Inny, it might take a few minutes, but she will get you back for a res.<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, no one gets left in Hate. Well, not usually.  <br/>
<br/>
Either the main chanter or the scout will call camp. No one else. If they<br/>
are both dead, it is usually not a good sign anyway. If camp is called, you<br/>
MUST protect the clerics and help them get out first. If you are a tank and<br/>
camp while a cleric is being beaten, you will probably be run out of the<br/>
raid. Clerics can res anyone back up. If all the clerics are dead, it means<br/>
porting new clerics up to res. Clerics and Enchanters are the two main<br/>
classes to be protected. None of the mobs in Hate are very hard. In fact,<br/>
most are rather easy. But only in small numbers or in controllable<br/>
situations. A lot of mobs with no healing or crowd control, and everyone<br/>
dies. It&#39;s not so much that the deaths hurt since everyone there should be<br/>
getting a lvl 49 or higher res anyway, but it does break the rhythm of the<br/>
hunt and add some serious downtime. With a good pull team, there will always<br/>
be mobs to kill, and everything will be under control... usually. Even with<br/>
the best team, accidents can happen. If they do, just try again. Don&#39;t get<br/>
discouraged or blame the pull team. <br/>
<br/>
The objective is to have a fun and adventuresome trip. Just remember that,<br/>
and everything else will fall into place. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun, and don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t do. <br/>
