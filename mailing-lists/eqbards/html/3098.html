This is indeed a problem.  Personally I tend to be either too quiet or too<br/>
blunt.  Handling people well is not one of my real life skills.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, I find myself, as one or another of my characters, grouped<br/>
with people who range from annoying through inept to disaster.  I have no<br/>
doubt in some cases they think similarly of me, but of course they&#39;re<br/>
wrong.  :-)}<br/>
<br/>
I always feel responsible to explain if I refuse to join or want to leave.<br/>
Sometimes I feel responsible to try to educate.  What I&#39;m trying to learn<br/>
to do is make the attempt to help and educate but not to get into an<br/>
attempt to teach a pig to sing.  There&#39;s just no use in continuing to annoy<br/>
the pig.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;d also rather solo or watch for what looks like a better group.<br/>
 I don&#39;t like to hurt feelings, but it seems unavoidable in so social a game.<br/>
<br/>
For example, playing my rogue I found myself trying to instruct a somewhat<br/>
inept, immature, annoying bard.  Eventually I concluded that he simply<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to get it.  Now I find I have little option but to ignore or<br/>
deflect him when he pops up.  A few days ago he recognized my rogue and<br/>
accosted her as a different character, saying his bard&#39;s name.  That so<br/>
offended my sense of being in character that I completely ignored him.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I have to learn to do is make a quick, graceful exit with<br/>
little or no explanation, after I&#39;ve determined, to what extent I can,<br/>
whether a situation calls for education or my absence.<br/>
