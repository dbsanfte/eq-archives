<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113512096">Heh heh, someone should forward this to everyone at Verant.com about a dozen<br/>
times.  Someone with more skill at avoiding internet mail tracking than I<br/>
do, a lot more.  This page is reasoned, accurate and powerful.  It does in<br/>
fact point out why nearly everything Verant does to balance the classes and<br/>
improve the game are problems that will cause its downfall.  It does make<br/>
reasonable solutions available to accomplish Verant&#39;s goals with far less<br/>
player hostility.  It is sadly though far to logical and ego-less in its<br/>
approach to likely find much support or understanding there.  Of all the<br/>
developer posts from Verant I have seen including Smed and Brad, GZ is about<br/>
the only one who doesn&#39;t let his ego influence his decisions when reason<br/>
should prevail.<br/>

If you ask me, aside from a few broken skills the game was fine the way it<br/>
was even before the DoT nerf. These constant nerfs are becoming the rule of<br/>
thumb. Why the hell Verant feels the need to yank the rug out from under a<br/>
classes collective feet is beyond me. Quit messing with established skills.<br/>
Try fixing the damn monster AI instead. Oh that&#39;s too hard? It&#39;s easier just<br/>
to screw with several thousand players characters? Oh that makes sense =/<br/>
<br/>
PS There is an interesting page up about Nerfing in MUDs. Bears a read, as<br/>
EQ seems to be following it step for step.<br/>

&gt; Got a note on this from GZ, via another high level monk.  The way Verant<br/>
&gt; described it was the way FD was supposed to be working prior to the patch.<br/>
&gt; There was a bug in the code that caused it to work not as Verant thought<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; did, but as Yeti and others had observed it to.  According to GZ after the<br/>
&gt; next patch it will work 100% below level 35 totally and as reported after<br/>
&gt; that, IF there are no other bugs in the code that are in effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He also said interestingly that the reason it did not work before the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>patch<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; as advertised was that the code for them forgetting was supposed to be an<br/>
&gt; exact copy of the code for forgetting a mob that had hopelessly outrun<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (as we often see in effect in w karana with bandits).  The code however<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; copied before they fixed the bug in the code for outrunning and the<br/>
&gt; corrected outrunning code was never pasted back into FD.  So the answer is<br/>
&gt; basically yes, Yeti is right, and Verant thought they were right and only<br/>
&gt; discovered they were not when they found the bug in the previous code.<br/>

&gt; I am reposting this from the Monk MB<br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://server3.ezboard.com/feverquestmonksfeigndeathnerf.html)">http://server3.ezboard.com/feverquestmonksfeigndeathnerf.html)</a>.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have known Yeti since Beta 3 (when he was known as Orcus).  He is one of<br/>
&gt; the most knowledgable players I have every met in the game.  The upcoming<br/>
&gt; nerf to Feign Death will effect all players, not just Monks, Shadow<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Knights,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; and Necros.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *********************************************<br/>
&gt; I would like to provide the community with information so they can<br/>
&gt; understand the nature of Verant&#39;s changes to FD. The changes are<br/>
&gt; significant, a nerf, and their news message was misleading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you.&quot; - No,<br/>
&gt; they came back based on aggro radius. If you saw them wander away to a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>safe<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; distance, you could get up without training anyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;If not, they would come after you at some later point. This might happen<br/>
&gt; within a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later&quot; - This was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; random, but the result of game mechanics understood by experienced<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feigners.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; A feigned upon mob has you in its aggro list. If someone else re-aggros<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mob to a lesser degree than the original feigner, it will return to the<br/>
&gt; feigner. Feigners knew this! If the mobs were in front of them in a room,<br/>
&gt; they knew no one would disturb them and all was fine. If the mobs were<br/>
&gt; scattered around the dungeon by a train wandering home, they knew to zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;.... Four times means about 20 percent ....&quot; - These numbers seem totally<br/>
&gt; inaccurate. I had to feign 11 times on a green guard and 10 times on a<br/>
&gt; knight while testing in Freeport. If ANY of your feign attempts fails<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(xxxx<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has fallen to the ground) then the mob comes running back. NO OTHER SKILL<br/>
&gt; takes 4 or more successful skill checks in a row to perform a single act.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; you have multiple mobs, it is almost impossible to fool them all. If even<br/>
&gt; one is not fooled, it will build a train as it runs to you - quite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>possibly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from so far out of sight that you don&#39;t even know you are killing other<br/>
&gt; players.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Feign used to be predictable. If you were successful against a mob that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>can<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be fooled (some couldn&#39;t be - this was a matter of experience and feigners<br/>
&gt; knew which mobs to avoid), it would never come back unless re-aggroed by<br/>
&gt; another player. Verant implies otherwise, but it is NOW that the skill is<br/>
&gt; totally unpredictable, with mobs that are far out of sight deep in the<br/>
&gt; dungeon randomly returning, based on percentages apparently much worse<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; those Verant gave and which are useless against multiple mobs. Stand up,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; a feigner doesn&#39;t know if he is killing people far out of sight, or has<br/>
&gt; safely cleared aggro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before a player had to re-aggro a mob in such a way that the feigner was<br/>
&gt; still higher on its aggro list (such as by coming very close, but doing no<br/>
&gt; damage), and in this case it was usually only the feigner that was in<br/>
&gt; danger. Now every time a feigner stands up mobs can come training from<br/>
&gt; everywhere, and if he feigns again because he sees them coming, they will<br/>
&gt; attack anyone nearby or in their path home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Feign pulling is still possible, although harder. Feign twinking/leveling<br/>
&gt; others is still possible, and should actually be easier. Feigning to avoid<br/>
&gt; death or trains now results in far more trains. What are these &quot;evolving<br/>
&gt; gameplay issues&quot; that Verant hoped to address? In what way was this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>supposed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; to make this a better game?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ask that the EQ community understand this is not just a nerf to SKs,<br/>
&gt; Necromancers, and Monks, but to anyone that has ever grouped with them or<br/>
&gt; even played in a dungeon, and invite you to provide /feedback in game to<br/>
&gt; voice your opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for listening, Yeti (Level 50 monk, Karana server)<br/>
