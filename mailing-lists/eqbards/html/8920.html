<div id="ygrps-yiv-940250100">I almost am always grouped with members of my guild.  Last night we had a<br/>
six member group entirely from my guild - but usually its 3-or-4 - often<br/>
augmented by friends or &quot;pick-ups&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Xegony is different - but I think I USUALLY see the same guild tag on<br/>
more than one person when I&#39;m in a pick-up group - or watch other groups..<br/>

&gt; I rarely see groups of people all of the same guild adventuring together,<br/>
&gt; unless they&#39;re all 30+ and camping something.  I don&#39;t only think of<br/>
guilds<br/>
&gt; as being groups of like-minded people, and such.  Why not have a guild<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; is class specific?<br/>
