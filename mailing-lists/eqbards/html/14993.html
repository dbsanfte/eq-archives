<div id="ygrps-yiv-647452798">The &quot;problem&quot;  seems to be that you cant pull mobs to you via simple &#39;line<br/>
of site.&#39;  Knowing this, how about changing your plan and think of a<br/>
different way to attack them?<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, this so-called &quot;buggy-ness&quot; of Mistmoore makes it legendary.<br/>
I&#39;d hate to see it reduced to another over-crowded mindless camp like Lower<br/>
Guk.  Lower Guk used to be a &quot;hard&quot; zone and now &lt;sigh&gt; oh well...<br/>

&gt; &gt; ...Verant was working on was fixing all the pathing problems in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mistmoore.  Hopefully we will soon see a correction to a bug that has<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the game since release.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In MM, the main problem is that mobs don&#39;t take a straight<br/>
&gt; line route to get to you.  Anything you pull from or in front<br/>
&gt; of the ballroom runs through the ballroom, out the back,<br/>
&gt; through the negotiator room, and then towards you.  On the<br/>
&gt; way, it picks up all the mobs in the ballroom, the negotiator<br/>
&gt; room, and the gargoyles in between. </span></blockquote></div>
