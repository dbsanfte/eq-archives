<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849130816">Also, as a cleric in my guild pointed out.. how is Mark of Karn so<br/>
imbalanceing when there are what like 7 copies of it on our server?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>
&gt; of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s <br/>
&gt; current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>
&gt; desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>
&gt; duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>
&gt; value decreased.  <br/>
