 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know if there&#39;s much point to adding this one. It&#39;s not really a<br/>
bard specific problem, though it does impact us the most. Also, it would<br/>
require redoing all kinds of graphics in all the various resolutions you<br/>
can play with in 3d mode. It would probably be better to get a seperate<br/>
petition going from all of the userbase requesting this, as I know it<br/>
annoys most everyone.<br/>
<br/>
However,<br/>
pointing out that you can open bags from the hotkeys in 640x480 might<br/>
have an undesirable result. Back in beta Verant found out people were<br/>
using hotkeys while in inventory mode. This was patched out of the<br/>
client in the next patch. No one know&#39;s why, but it seems obvious that<br/>
they have some strong feelings on how the interface should work that may<br/>
not agree with the player&#39;s desires. I worry if they found out that bags<br/>
were openable from the main window they might patch that out in the next<br/>
patch.<br/>
