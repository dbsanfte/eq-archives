<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374328139">Well, I play on Brell and my Enchanter is looking like she&#39;ll<br/>
get more play time than my Bard.  Since I play her, I know she&#39;s<br/>
honest. :P  As well, a guildmate of another of my characters on<br/>
Brell is a power-played Enchanter.  She is honest, and will more <br/>
than likely have far better skills to minimize risk of case a.<br/>
<br/>
Ask around first.<br/>
<br/>
BTW .. my honest jeweler is a Dark Elf named Deceit.  The name is a<br/>
story ;)  Luna is the Enchanter guildmate of my other character.<br/>

&gt;So, assuming I ever find myself fingering a black pearl in my pocket &<br/>
&gt;negotiating a price with some jeweler, any recommendations for how to cover<br/>
&gt;myself in case a) the jeweler fails, or b) the jeweler claims they failed,<br/>
&gt;or c) the jeweler laughs, says &quot;Sucker!&quot; and starts to run away?  This is<br/>
&gt;assuming I&#39;m not on a PvP server and can&#39;t kill him or her. </span></blockquote></div>
