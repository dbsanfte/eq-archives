<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-623703148">1. The only magic instrument really worth buying at 30th lvl is the best drum you can get your hands on -- no other item gives as much bang for the buck ...you run faster, buff better and kite harder.<br/>
2. If you are already started with singing steel then don&#39;t spend too much time on lambant -- it is good armor but there are alternatives -- rygorr is very light and getting cheaper all the time.  the bp, for example, is only 600pp on rodcet nife now.  weighs only 1 pound and gives 10 str and 18 ac.  You can also prowl skyshrine for no drop armor that nobody needs.  It is time consuming but you can end up with armor you&#39;ll use well into your 50s ... <br/>
3. charming guides on eqdiva/consert hall and eqsongs are really good.  read them well.  <br/>
4.  Deciever mask?  Heheheh, get it soon.  buy some undead invis potions and read eqatlas so you know how to get to the assassin room.  Mana song was key for me getting mine -- the group was all 35+ except for me P -- I&#39;ve seen lvl 12 twinks in there waiting for a chance to loot one.<br/>
 5. If you aren&#39;t in a guild, think about joining one soon.  There are basically three lvls of play in EQ:  solo, group and multiple group.  guilds are a great way to go do lots of cool things. -- find a guild that suits your style of play and you&#39;ll enjoy the game a lot more for it.<br/>
Good hunting )<br/>

groups.  Training up my brass (excellent, finally) on the docks at night <br/>
when finished adventuring....<br/>
<br/>
Now, I am a pretty kicking battle bard in a group.  Fighting and twisting <br/>
Im good at , have been gifted some good gear, armor and weapons ... good <br/>
enough at least.  Have been gifted MM drums, SS boots and Gauntlet....  so <br/>
I do just fine.<br/>
<br/>
But, am weak on crowd control (no cha gear yet) and kiting.  Very weak on <br/>
kiting...<br/>
<br/>
I know I need to train kiting and will be doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Gear wise, I&#39;m thinking about starting to try for lambent stuff.  Read a <br/>
guide about being a low level and sneaking around and asking for no drops <br/>
from high levels to get the gear, and considering that.<br/>
<br/>
I feel a high priority for me is a dark elf mask as well.  Has good cha <br/>
(13) and dark elf should not be KOS with guards in OT...<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t have good instruments other than drums.  Have a minotaur horn for <br/>
wind, but no special lutes.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions, itemwise?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
