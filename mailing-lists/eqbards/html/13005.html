&gt; Well, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to try to get a couple more items for my bard<br/>
&gt; armor quest and am thinking of heading to MM. I have never been there<br/>
&gt; before,mainly because most of my friends/ guild members have been in the<br/>

&gt; What are my chances of asking for loot rights to the gypsy lute and black<br/>
&gt; silk gloves-and how easy or hard is it to get to them?<br/>
&gt; What are my chances at level 35 of getting in group to hunt them?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Get in a group who knows the zone.  As you can tell by my<br/>
really long and less-than-complete writeup, there&#39;s a lot of<br/>
bugs in this zone and a lot to learn before you can play in it<br/>
safely.  Best bet is to join a group that&#39;s already<br/>
established themselves somewhere in the castle (which is<br/>
unlikely since they&#39;ll tell you to come to the music room,<br/>
you&#39;ll say &quot;where&#39;s that?&quot;, and they&#39;ll withdraw their<br/>
invite).  So you&#39;ll probably end up joining a group not<br/>
playing in the castle, or planning to break in.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re joining a group not playing in the castle, best<br/>
place to get a lute is in the pit/courtyard (area at the<br/>
bottom of the ramp just before the castle).  Make sure you<br/>
fight towards the back, far far away from the ramp.  You&#39;ll be<br/>
able to see any trains that run down the ramp.  Scout them out<br/>
while invis to see if any of the gypsies are carrying lutes.  <br/>
Often you can pull the returning trains 1-3 mobs at a<br/>
time.  The disadvantage of this is that you aren&#39;t killing<br/>
gypsies to force them to respawn.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re planning to break in, well good luck to you.  :)  <br/>
Read my other message for tips on getting inside.  The music<br/>
room has been so far in my experience the toughest one to<br/>
crack without a high level player pulling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No area effect songs until you learn the zone.  There are<br/>
several places where you can use them, but there are lots more<br/>
places where using them will get you killed before you can<br/>
blink.<br/>
