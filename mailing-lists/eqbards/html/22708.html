<div id="ygrps-yiv-195121393">A druid sold me this song last night (I guess they opened up Velious around <br/>
midnight or so).<br/>
<br/>
Definitely requires string, and it gives a buff shield (looks the same as <br/>
an enchanter&#39;s clarity symbol). No quantitative info beyond that I&#39;m <br/>
afraid. Would be interesting to find out more stats about it since it does <br/>
heal/stamina/clarity, but this would mean more weaving during downtime <br/>
since we can weave this with our clarity song.<br/>
