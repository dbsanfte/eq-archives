 </span></blockquote>After advice read on this list, I started using all songs, no weapons on an<br/>
occasional basis around level 28.  There are a few reasons I use it only<br/>
occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly it is a matter of control.  It&#39;s difficult for me to twist songs,<br/>
switch intruments and move my character around at the same time.  I fight in<br/>
first person view (I know I would have a better view in 3rd person, but it<br/>
takes away from the &quot;immersive&quot; experience for me...) and I have a hard time<br/>
&quot;keeping up&quot; with the battle when I can not have one hand on my movement<br/>
keys.  I think a Bard requires you to be sharp and quick as a rule, but<br/>
never moreso than trying to play all songs.  Sometimes, I&#39;m just not up to<br/>
the challenge :)  I also slide into the leader role in most groups, calling<br/>
out which mob to attack, evac orders, etc, which also get in the way....<br/>
<br/>
Reason #2:  Have been fighting with an enchanter in many groups lately, and<br/>
the &quot;wince&quot; wakes up their mez&#39;s.  Where I would like to be softening up the<br/>
2nd or 3rd mob, I even have to remove Denon&#39;s from my repotoire when using<br/>
weapons too.  As a side note, anyone ever tell you your mana song seems<br/>
slow?  Call it too much of a good thing on a regular basis.  : )<br/>
<br/>
Reason #3:  I also find myself grouped with mostly casters most of the time,<br/>
and being the main tank, it makes it that much more difficult to stay on top<br/>
of the battle.  Plus, sometimes the mobs die so fast, my actual damage<br/>
doesn&#39;t count as much as getting in the mobs way long enuf for it to die.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if we could get a dang message of how much damage we were &quot;Wincing&quot;<br/>
them for, I&#39;d be much more comfortable.  : )<br/>
<br/>
No matter what you typically use, I would recommend training up all your<br/>
weapon skills.  There&#39;s some very nice Bard only weapons at the top that<br/>
won&#39;t work so well with 1 in 1H slash.  : )  I put a 1H Slash in my primary<br/>
hand and a 1H blunt in my secondary, and alternate in a piercing weapon just<br/>
to get the skills maxed every level.<br/>
