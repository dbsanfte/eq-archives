<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043731782">They should try (damn hard) to first make the (new) songs - valuable for the<br/>
given level that they are earned - in light of how we now know the game gets<br/>
played vs how they thought the game would get played (&quot;it will take the<br/>
average player 12 months to reach level 50...&quot;  put that right next to<br/>
&quot;...no one will ever need more than 256k memory let alone 640k...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I agree that a true &quot;invis-to-Lower-Guk-undead-mobs-except-the-GIBS&quot; would<br/>
be entirely apprapo for 39 if not a tad late but about right.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, a target only, single pulse song that casts a symbol buff or rune?  It<br/>
could easily use the same reagent as the cleric/pallidan/enchanter, etc.<br/>
spells.  Might be real good idea.  And 45 might be a good level to get it -<br/>
you can easily afford the reagents and could use some self buffs for soloing<br/>
HG/SG/Spec&#39;s to get thru 45 Hell(tm).<br/>
<br/>
And how about something that helps in the alter-planes for 49?<br/>

&gt; This makes all the more likely we won&#39;t get this ability, since nothing<br/>
&gt; we do has a component...<br/>
