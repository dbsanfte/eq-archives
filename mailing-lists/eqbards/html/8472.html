&gt; &gt;Well, a guildmate of mine stated today that he is now able <br/>
&gt; &gt;to heal 45 points per tick with his Lute of the Gypsy Princess <br/>
&gt; &gt;found in Mistmoore. He is a lvl 45 bard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At level 38 I could heal 15hp per pulse with a normal lute.  <br/>
&gt; I know for certain a level 45 bard cannot heal 22hp per pulse<br/>
&gt; (which is half the stated 45hp with double effect).  Can a <br/>
&gt; level 45ish bard state what healing they can do with a lute<br/>
&gt; standing up?  And could one of our level 50s state what the <br/>
&gt; max healing per pulse is?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The song gets upgraded every 6 levels, so with a lute and<br/>
standing, rengen rates should be:<br/>
<br/>
L30-35 = 13 hp/pulse<br/>
L36-41 = 15 hp/pulse<br/>
L42-47 = 17 hp/pulse<br/>
L47-50 = 19 hp/pulse<br/>

&gt; That means you can double the dmg chords does for starters.<br/>
&gt; Nothing in the game thus far is _that_ good, not even that drum<br/>
&gt; from Nagafen or the flute from Cazic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;m reminded about something said by the head of the<br/>
KGB during the cold war.  He said the hardest thing about<br/>
spying on the U.S. was that there was so much incorrect<br/>
information going around that it was hard to tell what was the<br/>
truth and what was common misperception.  That&#39;s partly what&#39;s<br/>
taking me so long with this song guide.  I *want* to include<br/>
all the test numbers other people have come up with and<br/>
posted, but I don&#39;t really know how reliable it is (no offense<br/>
intended to all you other testers :).  So I&#39;m still winding up<br/>
testing a lot of stuff myself.<br/>
