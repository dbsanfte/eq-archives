<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709826522"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am on The Rathe, and i have withness the arrival of <br/>
&gt; Daughter of Innoruk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As always, over guildsay and all, Every lvl 50 or so where <br/>
&gt; there to try to take a piece of her. Not only they did no<br/>
&gt; amage, But she was calling over the &quot;Power of Innoruuk&quot; to<br/>
&gt; insta-kill them... Not nice to see lvl 50 drop in one cast.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s not nice is the uppity high level players trying to<br/>
ruin something that Verant is trying to do for the rest of<br/>
the players. Everyone complains about no quests and no<br/>
&#39;ongoing&#39; story lines - yet when Verant tries to add them<br/>
in there&#39;s someone that tries to ruin it - so they take<br/>
care of the problem the only way they can.<br/>
<br/>
Players do not lose experience when killed by a gm created<br/>
npc in an event or quest.</div>
