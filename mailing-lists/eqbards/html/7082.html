<b>Subject:</b> Question about the teleport song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062428546">I was fighting last night at the top of the aviak village in South Karana.<br/>
Fortunately everything went well and I never had to flee for the zone border<br/>
to escape death.  Had I been forced to do so I probably wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
survived because of the numerous ramps you have to use to get to the bottom<br/>
of the village.  Since I won&#39;t get levitate for a long time, was wondering<br/>
if the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I sing that song<br/>
while at the top of the village (or any high altitude location), will I<br/>
appear at the same altitude over the ground, and as a result take lots of<br/>
damage due to falling?  Or will I end up on the ground wherever the song<br/>
sends me to? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
