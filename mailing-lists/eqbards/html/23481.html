<div id="ygrps-yiv-585326837">Were you in a pickup group when the Harmonic Dagger dropped?  I know there<br/>
are a lot of greedy players out there, but if I was in a group that made me<br/>
roll for the Harmonic Dagger or any Bard only item, I would quit the group<br/>
in disgust and never group with any of them again.<br/>

LOL, actually the group decided to give it to me with no lotto.  As the<br/>
battle in dropped in was pretty hairy.  We had a bit of auto-pull, combined<br/>
with the hand room spawning on us.  I was doing constant CC for nearly<br/>
30mins of non-stop fighting, keeping anywhere from 1 to 4 mobs mezzed at a<br/>
time.  So they felt I had earned it =)<br/>
