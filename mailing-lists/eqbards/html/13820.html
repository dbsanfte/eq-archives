Is there anyway to delete your entire /friend list and start over?  I typed<br/>
in /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t seen in a long<br/>
time.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed in addition to<br/>
players.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, or /groupsay but<br/>
instead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the phrase I typed<br/>
to my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire list, there are<br/>
a few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made numerous attempts<br/>
at removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces before I type<br/>
in any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my friend list.<br/>
<br/>
I thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ directory this will<br/>
delete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>
friends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
