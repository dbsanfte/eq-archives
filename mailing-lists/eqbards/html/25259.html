<b>Subject:</b> AW: Question on getting into Dragon raids <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-123913859">Xegony does not use a master calendar to my knowledge for the simple fact<br/>
that we have too many personalities on Xegony. Cooperation is sometimes<br/>
limited and we have whole guilds of folks that simply don&#39;t play well with<br/>
others. Rule of thumb is whoever gets there first and god help you if you<br/>
get wiped out first try. Dragons on Xegony usually die pretty fast, although<br/>
Vox is a bit off the beaten track and can be up a bit longer than most. I<br/>
would guess the aveage lifespan of a dragon on Xegony to be no more than a<br/>
couple hours. You may consider parking a toon that can track in Perma.<br/>
 My advice is still to try and get into Ragefire camps for red scales and<br/>
watch for Gore as much as possible. If you can get into a Vox/Naggy raid, do<br/>
it. It will probably take you several levels before you have all the pieces.<br/>
Helping people with Gore/Vox/Nag/Trak/Rage gets your name known and brownie<br/>
points built. You will need them if you spot Vox up and when you get ready<br/>
to spawn Trak for your last step. My guild has some Vox level toons and we<br/>
need a frost book for one of our main paladins. If you spot her up one<br/>
night, give me a tell and we will see who  we have that can come help.<br/>
We did finally get Kaas&#39; epic finished this weekend. Ever had the luck to be<br/>
sitting in Trak&#39;s lair, waiting on the undead bard only to have Trak spawn?<br/>
What fun!<br/>
