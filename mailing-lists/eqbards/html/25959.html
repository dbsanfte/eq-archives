<div id="ygrps-yiv-482051623">OK then, since it&#39;s alive I&#39;ll put up a little post.<br/>
<br/>
I am in an interesting situation in that I&#39;m with a small, really fun guild <br/>
that is only now able to start small raids... mostly Kael.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am working on getting the best set of tradeable gear in the game for <br/>
bards.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for suggestions, maybe something I forgot...  Of course there is <br/>
stuff that&#39;s just WAY too expensive still (just bought my barbed ringmail <br/>
tonight woohoo).  Also, very proud that I won a whole lot of this stuff.  E <br/>
Marr is getting to be an older server now and there are some monstrous <br/>
twinks running around with better gear but I&#39;m proud of what I have.<br/>

Quick explanation too... I worked hard to get my stamina and HP up so no <br/>
need for invigorate and also for just plain HP sturdiness.  The crusty <br/>
pants are leftovers from that.  Also, could drop them with the addition of <br/>
a centi LS in offhand without losing the precious 100 sta level.  I swear <br/>
had I known, I would have put ALL points to stamina and rest to charisma <br/>
when I started the character... that&#39;s another discussion tho.  I do <br/>
appreciate the proc on the symphonic and the charisma as well... but would <br/>
drop it to keep the stamina and get some better dammed pants LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a list of my wish list so far... would be interested in folks&#39; <br/>
additions to list and prioritization of this one:<br/>
<br/>
Earring of solstice (for stats and FT 1 for charm kiting mana regen)<br/>
crystal chitin wrist(s? lore?)<br/>
PANTS (holding out for thurg or plane but up for suggestions)<br/>
belt of defense<br/>
bracer of defense<br/>
drums of the beast (have walrus currently)<br/>
