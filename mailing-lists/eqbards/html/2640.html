<div id="ygrps-yiv-407714490">I wonder if there is really anyone on this list who doesn&#39;t cheat.  For<br/>
example, what about the bug that makes up to 20 stacked items weigh the<br/>
same as just one?  How many of you exploit that bug on a daily basis to<br/>
carry more than your weight allowance?  Oh, is it just me?  Heh.  Oops.<br/>
I guess I&#39;ll be going now.<br/>
