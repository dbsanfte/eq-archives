Luclin unless you upgrade to Win 98.  Which really sucks, since I wasn&#39;t planning to upgrade my OS for a<br/>
month or so.  It&#39;s not as if I have nothing ELSE to spend money on in DECEMBER.  Thanks for the advance<br/>
notice, Verant.  You&#39;d think that in a year of developing this product, they&#39;d have noticed that Win 95<br/>

This after I spent 3 days discovering that the reason I couldn&#39;t get the LAST patch to work was because<br/>

forget to mention THAT, too.<br/>
