&gt;I have not been able to really particiapate iin the list for a while as I<br/>
&gt;was switching jobs etc. Got to be unemployed for a couple of weeks and as a<br/>
&gt;result Tszaaz went from about level 17 to 21 *laughs* Currently I am level<br/>
&gt;23. NO MORE POWERLEVELING! I am just going to enjoy it for a while, the <br/>
&gt;next<br/>
&gt;two songs (see invis and psalm of warmth) are stinkers anyway,so no big<br/>
&gt;hurry.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually Pslam of Warmth is NOT a stinker, it is a great song.  An <br/>
undocumented feature of the song is that it provides a group damage shield <br/>
(starts at 5 damage).  The damage shield stacks with all other shields <br/>
(except cold based ones I have been told).  If you think a 5 point damage <br/>
shield is not significant in your next group battle count the number of <br/>
times the mobs hit anyone in your party and multiply by 5 :)   Also see <br/>
invisibility is great for spotting cloaked kill stealers, and it give <br/>
ultravision for the blind humans in the group.<br/>
