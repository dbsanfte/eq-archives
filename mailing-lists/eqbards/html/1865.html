<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254930160">Have to add, that there have been numerous papers written on this subject that are worth checking into <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://journal.pennmush.org/">http://journal.pennmush.org/</a>  The grand daddy research paper on the subject is titled &quot;Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades: Players Who Suit MUDs,&quot; and the link can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://journal.pennmush.org/v1n1/bartle.html">http://journal.pennmush.org/v1n1/bartle.html</a>   This paper, in particular, I have heard cited in the influence of both UO and EQ.  Roleplaying is never even considered in the paper, because the author never assumes roleplaying is an actual play-style.  Think about it, and you&#39;ll realize the author is correct.  How you play the game is one thing, the way you play how you play is entirely something else.<br/>
<br/>
I actually disagree with the assmuption that a person can be a power gamer and not be a roleplayer.  I have met plenty of people whose main attraction to this sort of medium was just that: building one up as fast as one can, efficiently.  Can a person play the game in this way and not be roleplaying?  I don&#39;t see why not!  And I&#39;ve met quite a few.  When someone roleplays just what are they doing, how are they playing different?<br/>
<br/>
In the paper mentioned, groups are divided in this manner: Power Gamers (Achievers), Player Killers, Socializers, and Explorers.  Power Gamers, they are concerned with the stats and being first at a level.  Player killers, well, they engage in PvP; can be the murdering brigand or the just paladin who hunts them (they&#39;re really the same kind of player, except the murderer does not limit the PKing).  The explorer is the individual who prides themselves on their most complete set of maps, will test weird things like &quot;put the lore item in the bag and drop it in water, pick the bag back up and then trade it to another player....&quot;   And of course socializers pride themselves on how many people they know, perhaps not even personally, but know of.  Except for the first group, none is especially concerned with leveling, more on keeping up in the leveling race so that they may continue their play style efficiently.  The perfect Mud finds a place for each play style, a great balance.<br/>
<br/>
None may roleplay and all may roleplay.  Roleplaying is not a style of play, it is more like the icing on the cake!  Many roleplayers would probably be surprised by quite a few power gamers who are roleplayers.  This group, however, is often made up of the folks weaned on Quake who are not overly concerned with their own character&#39;s character, I&#39;ll give you that.<br/>
<br/>
So when someone says, I have been playing one character since release who is only level 16 so I must be a roleplayer, well, that just doesn&#39;t cut it.  That person could be an explorer, and not roleplayed once, but just talked out of charcater about game mechanics the whole time.<br/>
