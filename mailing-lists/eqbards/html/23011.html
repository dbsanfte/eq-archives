<div id="ygrps-yiv-752751752">With Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody, yes, we&#39;ve been able to remove buffs on <br/>
ourselves. I don&#39;t think it removes all buffs, but I do know it strips <br/>
cleric and druid buffs as well as some DOT&#39;s. Be careful too, since <br/>
Alenia&#39;s affects the whole group, that you don&#39;t wipe everyone&#39;s buffs off. <br/>
I don&#39;t use this song all that often, if anything, I usually want <br/>
Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura to debuff a mob. But after a while I forget <br/>
which one is which. You&#39;d think I&#39;d have it down by now since Alenia&#39;s <br/>
requires a string instrument.<br/>

&gt;I know Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura works on removing Damage Shields and<br/>
&gt;other buffs on mobs as I used it last night in Sol A.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re trying to strip your own enchantments with Alenia&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Disenchanting Melody. I know this used to clear my dark elf illusion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just logged on and tested it and it worked fine. Did my inkie illusion,<br/>
&gt;then started up Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody and it cleared it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;after the patch other day i tried to dispell clarity on me and couldnt..<br/>
&gt; &gt;(damn chanters sometimes)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now in the past the only thing i used to dispel on myself was dark elf<br/>
&gt; &gt;illusion...  Were we able to dispell our buffs in the past with our song?<br/>
&gt; &gt;or has this changed since last patch?  I could not dispell clarity, i tried<br/>
&gt; &gt;multiple times, morphed into DE form, was able to dispell that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just curious<br/>
