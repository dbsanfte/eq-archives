I just became a newly minted Bard of 20 songs, and have read (a Cleric<br/>
guide, I believe) that I could start adventuring in Cazic.  The guide listed<br/>
as one of the plusses that it really gives you an opportunity to hone your<br/>
group skills, which I am looking to do.  I have never adventured there<br/>
before with any of my other characters and I was wondering the following:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do I have a reasonable chance of survival in Cazic if I play smart at<br/>
level 20?<br/>
<br/>
2.  Are Bards in demand in Cazic?  I imagine that there are a lot of rogues<br/>
around, but are groups normally balanced?<br/>
<br/>
3.  What is the typical crowding of Cazic nowadays?  I know it was bad in<br/>
the Rubicite days, has it gotten any better?<br/>
<br/>
4.  If you think I am crazy to go to Cazic, where do you recommend that<br/>
isn&#39;t Aviaks, Oasis, or some other Hellicamped area?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
