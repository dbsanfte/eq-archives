<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978629466">The other day I (25 bard) grouped with a 20 druid to take on crag spiders in<br/>
East Karana.  On a few occasions, we would also fight mobs that were green<br/>
to me but blue to the druid.  When we killed then, I did not receive<br/>
experience points but he did.  Lets assume that when we killed a crag<br/>
spider, I got 55% of the total experience and he got 45% due to our level<br/>
difference.  When we killed the mobs that gave me no experience, did he get<br/>
100% or 45%?  I would guess he only got 45% but want to get a confirmation.<br/>
