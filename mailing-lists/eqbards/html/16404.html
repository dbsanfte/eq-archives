&gt; I think it was fixed SEptember/October. It was a LONG time ago.<br/>
&gt; But I can remember the complaints on Druid&#39;s Grove about it not<br/>
&gt; working, people trying everything, and nothing seemed to<br/>
&gt; make the spell worth anything. Then, there were discussions -- with<br/>
&gt; GZ I think? and people started trying again. And suddenly it<br/>
&gt; was working. (Verant never said they fixed anything... but<br/>
&gt; some druids swore they had tried what eventually ended up being the<br/>
&gt; way to use the spell.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, that is a long time for him not to know.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Really?  I&#39;ve been using harmony successfully for months.  How <br/>
&gt; &gt;could he fail<br/>
&gt; &gt;to find out it worked for that long?  when did it get fixed?<br/>
