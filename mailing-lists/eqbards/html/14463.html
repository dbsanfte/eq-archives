<div id="ygrps-yiv-995934168">Hmmm, that is awfully similar to my near death last nite.  A Paladin and his<br/>
buddy were killing a DE Dragoon when my partner and I stopped nearby.  I was<br/>
wounded and singing hymn.  The Dragoon was too far away normally to be in<br/>
range, but if they increased the radius of Hymn accidentally the Paladin<br/>
would have probably been in range.  The song wouldn&#39;t have affected him, but<br/>
I think the taunt is already broken so that it still works like the whole<br/>
song did back in beta when you didn&#39;t need to be grouped to get the effects.<br/>
One pulse combined with my being hurt was enough to cause the Dragoon to<br/>
ignore a Paladin that had done over 500 pts to it to rush over and try to<br/>
whack me.  Fortunately I was able to zone.  My buddy just stood there and<br/>
watched.  even though he was hurt as well the Dragoon never even looked at<br/>
him, just went right back to the Paladin.  Got a tell a few minutes later<br/>
from the Paladin asking me how the hell I got such a good taunt off on the<br/>
dragoon.  He wanted to know if I&#39;d tell him how so he could use it since his<br/>
own taunt sucked.  I told yeh no problem, just be a bard.  That made him<br/>
laugh, he hadn&#39;t seen my song pulse so he didn&#39;t know.<br/>

Had one of those weird AE Taunt things last night.  Anyone else getting<br/>
these<br/>
since the Reduced Bard Hate patch?<br/>
<br/>
Ran out of lavastorm with 50 health.  Couldn&#39;t even see a pixel on my health<br/>
bar.  Entered Nek and fired up the Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
Two players are killing a DE guard 30 feet from me, on the path.  Guard<br/>
spins<br/>
around, runs down the path, across the zone entrance alcove,<br/>
and cuts my head off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not grouped.  I&#39;m not anywhere near the guard.  I&#39;ve been in the zone<br/>
exactly 15 seconds, and I manage to taunt a half dead guard away<br/>
from the 2 guys who are killing it.<br/>
<br/>
Suck.  If this is reduced, maybe I should be grateful for the 15 seconds I<br/>
had<br/>
before I was killed.<br/>
