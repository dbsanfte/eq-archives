<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492955682">well let me explain myself then, i was assuming he was going to guk alone<br/>
considering he had invis potions, i myself hate pickup groups (remember the<br/>
threads named Group from hell? well i&#39;ve had 2 in a row). So unless you get<br/>
to guk with a group, hope there&#39;s someone in the tower allready so ya can<br/>
join up with them, or ya might end up like me last night, with a warrior<br/>
getting to the bridge, yelling uh oh and training all the wizards and the<br/>
gibs to the BR. needless to say i didnt make it to the zone. So ya i hope<br/>
for him that unless he has a group allready, that the ass is camped or he&#39;ll<br/>
never get it alone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the room may be camped most of the time, i just disagreed immensely with<br/>
the part i quoted, i.e. &#39;&#39;first, hope that the ass/supp is camped&#39;&#39;.<br/>
