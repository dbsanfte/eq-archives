<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015004079">I must say that in 11 levels of playing the only time I wasn&#39;t forced to<br/>
tank was in a group last night the the group leader playes a 27th level<br/>
bard. Most of the time if I tell my group that i will just heal and buff<br/>
they will tell me to fight or leave the group.....so I fight.<br/>

&gt;      I would love to be a &#39;support&#39; Bard but there seems to be an endemic<br/>
&gt;      shortage of tanks on my server.  I am always pressed into service as<br/>
a<br/>
&gt;      tank.  Sigh.  And the couple of time I was in a group where it might<br/>
&gt;      have worked everyone in the group though I was &#39;slacking&#39; by not<br/>
&gt;      wanting to fight.&lt;snip&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; [re: successful leveling]<br/>
&gt; I advise all bards overly concerned with the best weapons and damage<br/>
dealt,<br/>
&gt; to review the gifts that you have been given. Nothing sickens me more than<br/>
&gt; seeing a forceful party in danger, while the bard is selfishly fighting.<br/>
&gt; SHAME ON THAT BARD!&lt;snip&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
