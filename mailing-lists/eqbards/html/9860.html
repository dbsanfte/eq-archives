<b>Subject:</b> Enjoy the Veterans Day break (off topic) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092649802">Want to wish all you veterans out there a good Veterans Day weekend.  I for one<br/>
am looking forward to the break.  Since I&#39;m in the US Army, I&#39;m off through<br/>
Monday.  Combine that with my wife having to work(evil grin) and that means I<br/>
get to play EQ all day tomorrow and Friday.  This will be the first time in a<br/>
long time I get to play for more than two hours at a time.  Just might get the<br/>
chance to finally make 27th level and play around with the Charm song some.<br/>
Already printed out the song analysis that John Kim posted a few weeks back so I<br/>
have it to refer to.  Got my song scroll already in my backpack and I&#39;m even<br/>
gonna go ahead and make my pet hotkeys now in anticipation of gaining that song.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For you E&#39;ci bards (Kitasi, Faras, Aloro, Laluni, et.al.), look me up if you are<br/>
online.  Maybe we can all get together and work on getting quest components for<br/>
our armor.  I&#39;m getting tired of MM and was thinking about heading to Solusek.<br/>
An enchanter friend who is 35th level has already agreed to help me fight giants<br/>
in order to get some lambent stones as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Take care<br/>
Galtin of E&#39;ci</div>
