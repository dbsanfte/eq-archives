Riding the boat from Freeport to Butcherblock, just before he entered the<br/>
Butcherblock area, he suddenly found himself stranded on a rock in the<br/>
company of aqua goblins.  He got a message to me and I remembered the<br/>
advice I&#39;d heard hear about swimming for an island with a dock.  He<br/>
preferred to pray to the bitwise gods, but none seeemed to be listening.<br/>
<br/>
So we hatched a plan.  I would take the boat on the same path he did,<br/>
reporting to him where it was.  I told him the boarding technique I learned<br/>
so recently in this scrying pool, swim for the boat as if you&#39;re going to<br/>
climb its prow, and find yourself in the hold by the bar.  I called out the<br/>
landmarks as they passed, in detail as we entered, sailed through, and<br/>
beyond the aqua goblin rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Then I heard my friend&#39;s exultant shout!  He was aboard.  A rescue at sea.<br/>
And we owe it all to what I learned here from my fellow bards.<br/>
<br/>
My deepest gratitude for your help in rescuing my friend.<br/>

We weren&#39;t even tempted to use /loc.  And now we have an in-game story of<br/>
fear, frustration, anticipation, and rescue, even though it was caused by a<br/>
stupid software bug.<br/>
