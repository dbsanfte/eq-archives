<div id="ygrps-yiv-849809608">The theory I believe is - that a great class was created in the beginning.<br/>
Essential a true hybrid of every other class in the game!  Then GZ - and who<br/>
ever else came up with the design and great concept move to other Verant<br/>
projects or perhaps leave the company.<br/>
<br/>
We are now left with Abashi and the &quot;Tuning Team&quot; and THEIR vision.  What I<br/>
just don&#39;t get is what they are basing it on.  The initial nerf of Lullaby<br/>
to 4 mobs is one we all agree with - no problem.<br/>
<br/>
We get the chains nerf.  Again - the nerf to the higher level song - no<br/>
problem we all agree with that.  When they broke the lower one - they<br/>
initially said they would fix it.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong - but that was GZ<br/>
not GW who said it would be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Now with GW as lead designer (perhaps there&#39;s someone else behind the<br/>
scenes - but it sure seems like it&#39;s GW) with HIS vision of bards - the<br/>
nerfed-Chains functioning sure seems fine with him.<br/>
<br/>
Look at lullaby - same thing.  Will we get a change to Pixie Strike and Song<br/>
of Twilight?  Perhaps simply because we&#39;re a squeaky wheel - but I won&#39;t be<br/>
surprised if not either...<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Abashi&#39;s response to a very well thought out post<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, although it was one of the most thoughtful posts I have seen in a long<br/>
time, it got the usual treatment from VI.  Here was Gordon&#39;s response.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;ll leave in-depth determination of &quot;role&quot; to those playing it, I<br/>
think that you&#39;ve answered your own question here. Bards are good at so many<br/>
things, you&#39;re surely here to do some of those things. I feel that Bards<br/>
excell at making a good group better. That&#39;s my opinion. What&#39;s more<br/>
important though is, what is a bard&#39;s role to you? If you look at it as a<br/>
walking-talking mana battery, there&#39;s not really much I can do to make you<br/>
feel better about it. It&#39;s the same issues with the clerics who often<br/>
complain that they are a walking-talking hitpoint-battery. You are a support<br/>
class. You support the group, and you do it very well. Whether or not you<br/>
are happy with that role is up to you.<br/>
<br/>
- Gordon<br/>
<br/>
Pretty pathetic in my opinion.  Obviously Gordon just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between the satisfaction one gets from saving a<br/>
comrade&#39;s life (virtual or not) and the satisfaction of knowing that the<br/>
druid can get off one more Careless Lightning because you stood around and<br/>
played mana battery.  What a joke.  Obviously in VI&#39;s &quot;Vision&quot; bards are not<br/>
meant to be real characters.  Our role is solely to support other&#39;s efforts.<br/>
They should have called the class &quot;Sidekick&quot; instead.<br/>
