<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-353075852">Well I can not get to EZBoards from work, so I can not comment on the <br/>
thread you posted a link to.  I do know that EW(my guild) has been <br/>
kicking around the idea of waking the Sleeper.  One of the main <br/>
reasons they have been thinking about it is due to pressure from <br/>
Darkwind.  Not to get too deep into ARo server politics, but DW was <br/>
immense time zone advantage on ARo and uses it ruthlessly to their <br/>
advantage (they are a mainly western Europe guild).  They are pretty <br/>
much the number two guild on the server and have overran us before <br/>
and not been very forthcoming in trying to work out any kind of <br/>
arrangement on either Sleepers or N Tov.  And as far as some of the <br/>
other upcoming guilds (SoT, CB, and others) they have been leaching <br/>
off of EW&#39;s work for the last month or so.  Case in point was SoT & <br/>
CB using CoH to try and do the back dragons in N ToV earlier this <br/>
week to avoid having to fight the tougher mobs at the start.  Also <br/>
PoM is getting very overcrowded, some nights we have had 30+ people <br/>
run by us after we have cleared the way to PoM.  Now that we have <br/>
cleared N ToV three (or four? can not remember) times it is starting <br/>
to get a little old.  Leaving only 2 real challenges left, the 4th <br/>
Warder and the AoW.  So I would suspect that EW will be making a real <br/>
effort on Sleepers sometime in the future. <br/>
<br/>
One interesting thing about Abashi&#39;s post regarding the changes <br/>
wrought by waking the Sleeper is that it seems to allude to a quest <br/>
to re-imprison him.  He also hinted at other changes to the zone and <br/>
I have heard that the guards seem to be dropping more primal then <br/>
they did in the past.  so it may not be as bad as it would seem if <br/>
the Sleeper is let loose.<br/>

not<br/>

&gt; I think its cool that a guild would be attempting this, but if the <br/>
warders<br/>
&gt; dont respawn, then to me, bites,  and will have an impact on the <br/>
entire<br/>
&gt; server community, not just ew, dw and vv but futur guilds that <br/>
would like to<br/>
&gt; go to ST as well... Take Rathe for example, it supposedly has had <br/>
no warder<br/>
&gt; spawn since the sleeper was awakened.  :(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I might have my info wrong, I might not, either way I hope they <br/>
dont go<br/>
&gt; away.<br/>
