&gt; Fish sell for 2s each! And when you fish up sandals (Meara is still<br/>
&gt; wearing Tattered Sandals she fished up), fish scales (Water Breathing<br/>
&gt; anyone?) and Rusty daggers, they don&#39;t even use a lure up!<br/>

more cash and more exp for the same time spent. Fishing at low levels is<br/>
only worth the time spent on it if you put an extremely low value on<br/>
your time.<br/>
