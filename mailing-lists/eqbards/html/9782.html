<div id="ygrps-yiv-267423109">This is pretty exciting, I think.  You&#39;re right in that some of the answers<br/>
aren&#39;t what we wanted to hear, however, I think it&#39;s pretty much to be<br/>
expected.  Few probably care, but here&#39;s my take on these answers:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; GZ: This missing songs are being saved for the expansion pack.  We might<br/>
&gt; break down and put some of them in sooner, but I really wanted to<br/>
&gt; be able to<br/>
&gt; add new abilities to Bards as the game continued.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a little bit disappointed in this, but it&#39;s not that big a deal to me.<br/>
I&#39;m not on the list of people who feel that the game is &quot;unfinished&quot;, but I<br/>
was hoping those songs would make it in, especially now that I&#39;m approaching<br/>
39th  ;)  The songs that we have in our repertoire are sufficient to get<br/>
things done all the way through 50th IMO.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Alenias Disenchanting Melody<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ: I will check this one out.  It *should* cast cancel magic on<br/>
&gt; your entire<br/>
&gt; group - and did at one point of beta.  It is high on my list of things to<br/>
&gt; check out/get fixed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Holy cow!  This would have been more than just a little bit useful in<br/>
Befallen at level 22.  It would have saved me several nasty DoT deaths.  FIX<br/>
THIS ONE!  When I&#39;m hunting (err.. dying) in Kithicor now I&#39;d have it memmed<br/>
right beside Selo&#39;s.  This would allow me to at least be in motion when I<br/>
died.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; GZ: Well, i just fixed the horn.  We should have a drum at some time - I<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t know when.  Sorry.  I think we will try to sneak it in on our<br/>
&gt; next graphics patch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;We should have a drum at some time&quot; implies that they simply don&#39;t have a<br/>
drum graphic to give us.  Therefore it wasn&#39;t something that they could have<br/>
fixed in the last emotes animation patch.  If that&#39;s the case it might be<br/>
some time before we get the drum.  It&#39;d be nice, but it&#39;s not keeping me up<br/>
nights.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I have been pleasantly surprised with the new emotes.<br/>
Most of them are pretty funny and/or well done.  It&#39;s nice to actually bow,<br/>
point, etc.  The other nice thing that happened to us is that we no longer<br/>
look like we&#39;re standing when playing Hymn with an instrument after battle.<br/>
Many times I&#39;ve had to explain to someone in my group that in fact I *was*<br/>
sitting, it just didn&#39;t look like it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; right click on a spell can see what skill the spell uses<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This would be nice.  At 31st I still have to look up a couple of the less<br/>
frequently used songs to see what skill they might use.  More importantly<br/>
newer bards would be able to find out that Selo&#39;s was &quot;Skill: Percussion&quot; or<br/>
that Lullaby was &quot;Skill: Strings&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ: A lot of these skills are &#39;given&#39; to Bards, even though they<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t ever<br/>
&gt; get good at them.  I&#39;ll check on the caps with one of the<br/>
&gt; programmers, but I<br/>
&gt; doubt that will change much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tend to agree with this take believe it or not.  Bards are an amalgamation<br/>
of various other classes.  We have a very impressive list of skill and<br/>
capabilities.  True, few of our skills are the best version of those skill<br/>
when compared to the other classes that receive them, but we do *get* them.<br/>
<br/>
A 30th level necro friend of mine (Hi, Evanya!) has started a bard based in<br/>
no small part on grouping with me a lot and seeing how much fun I have.<br/>
Cyricc, the new bard, was asking questions about our skills when confronted<br/>
with leveling up to 10th.  I put it thusly: &quot;Bards have very many of the<br/>
skills that other specialize in.  Since we have skills from all other<br/>
classes it is only just and fair that we either get the skill later<br/>
(Clarity: Enchanter 29th, Bard 32nd) or that it isn&#39;t quite as strong or<br/>
quite as useful (Forage, Safe Fall, Charm, Melee)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have all had virtually every other class say to us &quot;Damn!  You bards get<br/>
that skill TOO?&quot;  You&#39;ve got to expect that in the name of class balance<br/>
that some of those multitudinous skills be weakened from their parent class&#39;<br/>
versions.  So when I think of these skills I may be envious of how much<br/>
better another classes&#39; version works (i.e. Forage, Charm, even Melee), but<br/>
I take solace in the fact that I even *have* all of those skills.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; GZ: Selo&#39;s breaking root has been back and forth since Beta 1.  We had it<br/>
&gt; breaking root for a while, but this proved to be just too<br/>
&gt; powerful, since it<br/>
&gt; is a free song that bards keep mem&#39;d all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we had all suspected that Selo&#39;s breaking root had been deliberately<br/>
changed while they were in fixing the Selo&#39;s/SoW issues.  Selo&#39;s breaking<br/>
root *was* very powerful, as you not only broke root but were in Turbo Mode<br/>
when it broke.  That said, the song that we wouldn&#39;t keep memmed all the<br/>
time and that *should* break root is Disenchanting Melody, and it&#39;s broken.<br/>
So let&#39;s hope ADM gets fixed very soon.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A) make Selo&#39;s work indoors, or B) to not allow SoW and Jboots to work<br/>
 </span></blockquote>indoors?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ: Possibly.  But remember - Bards are similar to Hybrid spell casters on<br/>
&gt; their power levels - they are not pure spell casters - their<br/>
&gt; songs won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; as powerful as a pure caster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GZ&#39;s comments reiterate what I said above.  As for Selo&#39;s not working<br/>
indoors, its a real bummer alright, but again I don&#39;t see it as being the<br/>
end of the world.  I&#39;m just one more gal standing in line in front of the<br/>
Druid before we go into Permafrost.  If they fix this, it is likely the SoW<br/>
and JBoots will get cancelled indoors IMO.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; memorization time being reduced in the future?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ: That is something that we will be talking about at our next tuning<br/>
&gt; meeting - possibly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not much to say.  I hope they help us out here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Crisson&#39;s Pixie Strike seems to be bugged.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ: I&#39;ll check on that one - not sure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mumble, mumble, mumble.  Pixie Strike is BROKEN.  So is Lullaby.  I was<br/>
TRYING to use Lullaby in Cazic-Thule last night and I&#39;d get a &quot;nods&quot; message<br/>
for EVERY mob and then get hit by two or three.  This is really aggravating.<br/>
It&#39;s gotten so my groups are saying &quot;That song&#39;s not useful, quit using it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; GZ: Hope that helps a bit.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It does..<br/>
