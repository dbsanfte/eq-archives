&gt; Um, if there is nothing in the game that you don&#39;t deserve,<br/>
&gt; then there is no advancement, and you have the ultimate<br/>
&gt; monty-haul game.  It may sound harsh to say you don&#39;t deserve<br/>
&gt; something at a certain level, but that&#39;s the fundamental basis<br/>
&gt; of advancement in a level-based roleplaying game.  If you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like it, then you probably shouldn&#39;t be playing an<br/>
&gt; advancement-based RPG.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you missed my point (or maybe -most likely- I didn&#39;t state it<br/>
clearly). I think that aspiring to get a certain level or a certain piece or<br/>
set of armor, or whatever, is great - that&#39;s one of the reasons I play the<br/>
game. But another is to have fun ---- when people seem to get awfully worked<br/>
up over a game... to the point of coming across rude to people, the game<br/>
ceases to be UN-fun (actually - the game has always been fun for me - its<br/>
some of the posts on this list that bother me). Anyway, that was what I was<br/>
objecting to... NOT whether a person really does deserve or not deserve<br/>
things etc.... Anyway - I have said enough on this (its a good thing that<br/>
people don&#39;t HAVE to agree on things or this thread will never end).<br/>
