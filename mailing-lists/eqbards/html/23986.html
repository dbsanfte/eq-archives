<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107400658"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;um wrong, common error.  the 4% is out of 2000 people playing at the time.<br/>
&gt;the 7% was out of 38000 or so people playing at the time.  percentages are<br/>
&gt;hard numbers if you relate them to the same or comparable things.  In this <br/>
&gt;case both are related to the number of people playing at a specific time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, duh.  The common error here is that you are relating 4% bards to being<br/>
the same as 7% pvp.  If there were only two classes to choose from then your<br/>
analogy would be appropriate.  Since there are 13 other choices however, it<br/>
is not.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Totally and completely untrue.  The number of choices directly affects the<br/>
significance of any minority percentage.  This is true both statistically,<br/>
analytically, and practically.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;important.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s only true if the opposing segments are of equal size.  When bards are<br/>
a 4% segment out of 14 unallied segments none totaling over 15% they are<br/>
significant.  When pvp is 7% out of two total segments where the other<br/>
segment is 93% they are insignificant.  To balance the effects on the whole<br/>
population of anything because of the effect on that 7% is patently unsound.<br/>

<br/>
Not likely.  The reason more people don&#39;t play them is because the return on<br/>
the work invested is not proportionate.  Unless you truly enjoy the actual<br/>
work involved, there is no reason to play a bard.  Some people do enjoy the<br/>
constant challenge despite the fact it is not rewarded equivalently to the<br/>
lesser challenges of other classes.  <br/>
<br/>
Bards are not some Nietzschian ideal class that only those who are willing<br/>
to sacrifice can play and for which they are rewarded with awesome powers.  <br/>
<br/>
It is inherently arrogant to assume that bards are actually really powerful<br/>
but are not played by more people solely because of ignorance, laziness, or<br/>
incapacity.</div>
