if you are going to compare bard vs ench to sha vs ench, compare all the<br/>
others too:<br/>
<br/>
bard vs wiz in nuke<br/>
clr vs wiz in nuke<br/>
ranger vs wiz in nuke<br/>
war vs wiz in nuke<br/>
<br/>
If you think that bards should be 67% as effective, should not everyone also<br/>
be 67% effective?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jack of all - master of none&quot; does not equate to &quot;almost as good&quot; or<br/>
acceptable substitute or second best at or &quot;67% as good as.&quot;  Bards can do a<br/>
variety of things.  Some better than others. Some lots worse.  There are<br/>
examples of that in all classes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It makes me nauseated because a level 14 cleric can cast invis to undead<br/>
and bards can&#39;t&quot; (well we can hope for level 39 song can&#39;t we?).  That&#39;s<br/>
just me showing class envy.   For whatever reason (design by Verant,<br/>
oversight by Verant), we cant do it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess Verant gave us a taste of speed buff with our songs and that makes<br/>
us lust for more.  At some point, we just need to accept what we are and go<br/>
out and kill stuff.  It is good to know what is an effective technique but I<br/>
have liitle hope that Verant is gonna make dramatic improvements for us.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I find it nauseating is because a group with a L49<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bard can improve their performance by getting a L16 enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to buff them. </span></blockquote></div>
