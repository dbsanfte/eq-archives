<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998094170">Rising Phoenix has around 80 active members.<br/>
 I am the only High level Bard (49th) and we have a level 15th Bard.<br/>
 There are 2 mules listed as Bards.<br/>
<br/>
 When I do a Who All 40 to 60 Bard when the server is running over 2K<br/>
players on... I MAY get 6 to 10 Bards Usually... I bet there are less<br/>
than 20 playing high level Bards all told.</div>
