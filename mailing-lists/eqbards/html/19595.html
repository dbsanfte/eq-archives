 </span></blockquote>I believe I&#39;ve actually seen Brad comment on this and yes it is a<br/>
gameplay enhancer. :) They make the mob hit the nearest person while<br/>
rooted regardless of fear, blindness or anything else players might<br/>
think of to combine with it. Look at what they did to chains to nerf the<br/>
54 song, just because, as Abashi said, 2 bards playing it and fear could<br/>
keep a mob frozen in place while they killed it. Now, most people might<br/>
ask why they didn&#39;t just make the 54 song not stack instead of putting a<br/>
slowdown cap in based on the necro darkness line, but then most people<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t take a job at Verant.<br/>
