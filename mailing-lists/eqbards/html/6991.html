I still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>
only lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>
likely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>
thing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>
deviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>
you&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>
as more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>

I agreed with John here.  The higher dmg weapon is better than the faster<br/>
weapon when the dmg ratio are the same.  I used to used a Demon claw and a<br/>
Silver war axe.  That was fast.  But now that I have the crystalline blade<br/>
and the black enamel mace I find the later weapons a lot more efficient.  I<br/>
have no scientific facts except that with the Crys blade and mace the MOBs<br/>
seems to hate me a lot more than when I was fighting with Claw and axe.<br/>
Same mob at same lvl.<br/>
