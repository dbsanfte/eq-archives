<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255936440">The sequence of events for me - I fell in lava right near the entrance<br/>
(from Lavastorm).  Given the number of hit points a 29 bard has - and the<br/>
lava doing damage in 56 increments - I realized I had a good amount of<br/>
time - and tried to climb out.<br/>
<br/>
    I didn&#39;t realize this wasn&#39;t possible - and got myself in deep (nice pun<br/>
there &lt;g&gt;).  There is a &quot;Lavafall&quot; (waterfall type thingy) that you can&#39;t<br/>
climb out.  Right past there is a zone to Sol-B.<br/>
<br/>
    My situation was that my Druid helper died because our levitations wore<br/>
off.  Being the selfless type - he renewed mine before his - and<br/>
subsequently died when his fizzled.  I figured I could &quot;safely&quot; zone to B<br/>
because I had a freshly renewed Levitate and would have plenty of time to<br/>
zone back if I had no better luck getting our of the lava in B.<br/>
<br/>
    When I got to B - I can&#39;t remember exactly the layout (first time I was<br/>
there anyhow) but there&#39;s like a big cavernous area - so with levitate it<br/>
was pretty easy to get to solid ground.<br/>
<br/>
    As far as your question - the zone from Sol-B to Sol-A is already lava -<br/>
so you&#39;d already have to have fell into lava in Sol-B to zone through Lava<br/>
to Sol-A...<br/>

&gt; p.s. some one mentioned that you can zone out from the lava pool into<br/>
Sol-b?<br/>
&gt; Does that mean that if you were to zone from sol-b you would end up in<br/>
Lava<br/>
&gt; if you were not levi&#39;d when you zoned?  Like someone could zone out of<br/>
sol-b<br/>
&gt; in panic and die in the lava?<br/>
