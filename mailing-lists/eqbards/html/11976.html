	Got one last night and it is a very nice blade. Stats are 10/38 (bit slower<br/>
than the BBK). Weight is 8.0 (bit lighter than the BBK). Gives you DEX +5.<br/>
Procs for Strong Poison. 30 DD and 14 per tick (dunno duration). With some<br/>
help you should be able to go an get it from Paws.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

Well I think I am getting tired of my measly well balanced long sword,and I<br/>
think its time for a new slasher :)<br/>
I was thinking of the Brazen Brass Kilij and was wondering-how common is the<br/>
sand giant with the plans for this quest-is he camped?<br/>
Can he be camped?<br/>
I hate to say, I have been in high keep so long,I forget what the rest of<br/>
the world is like(blinks in the sunlight as he steps outside the keep).<br/>
I never really hunted much in Ro-went to Guk for the first time last<br/>
eek( pretty sad for my level)-never been to CT,or MM. Yes I&#39;ve led a very<br/>
sheltered life-but back to my original question-any help would be<br/>
appreciated- or is there a better weapon out there i should look for-I dont<br/>
get alot of  play time-most I can play at one stretch is maybe 3-4 hours on<br/>
a night when the little woman is asleep :)- so I cant really do a 10 hour +<br/>
marathon.<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated. By the way, this is gotta be the best<br/>
list out there :)-Thanks in advance.<br/>
