<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853470648">I looked at the info.  The methodology is sound but the statistical sample<br/>
is way too small for any degree of accuracy.  To test a procedure where the<br/>
range is 1-100 (percentile roll) you need at least one order of magnitude<br/>
higher to get statistical accuracy down to an acceptable level.  That means<br/>
1000 attempts at each test level.<br/>
Anyone who has ever camped for what undoubtedly is an X% treasure spawn<br/>
knows this.  100 times might get 3 once, and none the next, and 20 the next.<br/>
1000 times though will nearly always come up very similar.<br/>

On a monk board I have been reading lately (started playing my monk again) I<br/>
<br/>
found a link to an interesting discussion on the benefits (or lack there of)<br/>
<br/>
of stat buffs.  The Shaman that ran the test came to the conclusion that <br/>
that buffing Str had a negative impact on damage. Here is a link to the <br/>
thread:<br/>
