<div id="ygrps-yiv-38410479">Not just you - I just made 23 - been using chain for about 5 days, and last<br/>
night WAS very different.<br/>
<br/>
I use dennons with a horn a lot too - and am being resisted at least 25 -<br/>
40% more by mobs that NEVER resisted it before.<br/>
<br/>
Ya know - I sure am heartily sick of tweaking without notice.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - anyone else notice buffs not lasting as long either?<br/>

&gt;I didn&#39;t really do any testing last night, but after one or two uses last<br/>
&gt;night, I came to the conclusion that our snare song has been secretly<br/>
&gt;nerfed.  Before, using this song on a monster at half life or less would<br/>
&gt;effectively freeze it in its tracks.  Last night, casting it on mostly dead<br/>
&gt;mobs still allowed the mobs to move as a regular snare would.<br/>
&gt;Anyone else noticed this, or is it just me?<br/>
