<div id="ygrps-yiv-825500624">Dunno, group health IS displayed you just need to have the group &quot;window&quot;<br/>
up.<br/>
Archers aren&#39;t really all that over-powered.  I play a &quot;Ranger&quot; that I<br/>
created.  He&#39;s specialized in archery & axe.  I find myself using the axe<br/>
FAR more often in dungeons and the bow more often on the surface.  Archers<br/>
are supposed to be powerful in open areas where they can peg you from 300<br/>
yards.  Underground the tanks rule.<br/>
<br/>
As for secure trading that IS an issue but then again I was never a big fan<br/>
of &quot;secure&quot; trades.  I&#39;ve never been rooked and items are pretty easy to get<br/>
so most people don&#39;t bother trying to run a scam.  Remember, this isn&#39;t<br/>
evercamp.  You can get the same nice items as anyone else from totally<br/>
different places.  You don&#39;t have to camp mob XYZ to get item WWW anymore.<br/>
So the &quot;secure trading&quot;, while an issue, doesn&#39;t seem to be as big a factor<br/>
as it is in EQ (where you have to camp 24+ hours for some items at a camp<br/>
that has waiting lists 36hours  long)<br/>
<br/>
Overall I&#39;d say they both have pro&#39;s and con&#39;s.  As I said, I haven&#39;t quit<br/>
EQ but if I don&#39;t see any of my friends who I play with online I head<br/>
straight to AC.  (Did I mention I can have ICQ up in the background and<br/>
ALT-TAB to it if someone buzzes me to get my but on EQ? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Kinda nice.  And worth taking a look at.<br/>

&gt;All I can say is &quot;I&#39;m impressed&quot;.  I&#39;m not going to go into all the nitty<br/>
&gt;gritty but I&#39;ll post some of my impressions that I got from the past 2<br/>
&gt;weeks....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I picked it up last weekend when it was $25 at Best Buy.  To answer the<br/>
recent question: yes, you get a free month.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2)  Better support.  They post regular updates as to what&#39;s been fixed, why<br/>
&gt;it was fixed and what to expect from it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The detail in the update reports did impress me quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Most verything else you pointed out was pretty nice, too (landscape<br/>
graphics, dynamic world, skill sets, less paranoia of players advancing).<br/>
<br/>
For the character appearance, though, I have to agree with another post I<br/>
saw somewhere: it&#39;s a nice idea, but you rarely ever see people&#39;s faces, so<br/>
it&#39;s a lot of design effort gone (mostly) to waste.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3)  Better support.  They listen to the players.  Usually when a bug is<br/>
&gt;reported it&#39;s fixed by the next patch, if not the one after.  There&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt;single bug left in the game that was reported from beta (*cough*)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, this is what killed it for me:<br/>
 - no secure trading (did they never play Diablo?  how long ago was that?)<br/>
 - no banking (everything is on your person, or on player named &quot;Will&#39;s<br/>
Mule&quot;)<br/>
 - the first-person mouselook is entirely unusable.  There&#39;s no mouse<br/>
   acceleration setting, and the horiz and vertical are fixed at entirely<br/>
   different settings, so turning is slow, but your head keeps snapping up<br/>
   to the sky or down to the ground.  Then, if you move forward and try to<br/>
   turn while running forward, it _stops_ and does the turn, and you have<br/>
   to press &#39;forward&#39; again.  Entirely, utterly, unusable.  You have to<br/>
   play the game third-person, with the keyboard, which completely kills<br/>
   any immersion factor for me.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m not entirely convinced on the better support from listening to<br/>
players; I&#39;m sure these have been reported over and over since the beta<br/>
started, and are pretty major design flaws IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Other things I&#39;ve heard about but didn&#39;t get far enough to see:<br/>
 - no group health display<br/>
 - unbalanced heavily towards magic and archers, and against melee<br/>
 - no guards, so people can have fun pulling monsters into the town square<br/>
