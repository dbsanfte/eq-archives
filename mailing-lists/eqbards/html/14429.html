I&#39;m really only comfortable answering this question as I have a lot of<br/>
experience with the gargs out here. I was able to solo gargs at 23rd level<br/>
using the all instrument attack (DDD,COD,Hymn). The tougher gargs, however,<br/>
I ended up kicking in selo&#39;s and weaving in bellow & hymn while running<br/>
circles on one side of the island (safe fall will come in real handy out<br/>
here when you get it). It&#39;s a little dangerous running circles as you can<br/>
also pick up other gargs. I&#39;ve pulled other gargs by accident and I survived<br/>
by just doing the same thing, selo&#39;s, bellow, hymn (and an occasional jig as<br/>
your stamina gets real low).<br/>
<br/>
You can also run around the perimeter of the island, but beware of people<br/>
fighting spectres. Also, I fight in 3rd person view so it was a pain<br/>
switching views as the island gets in the way.<br/>
<br/>
So you might be able to solo gargs at level 20, but you&#39;ll most likely end<br/>
up having to spend a lot of time running and bellowing towards the end of<br/>
the fights.</div>
