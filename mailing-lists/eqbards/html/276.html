<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334112028">First, let me apologize for a poorly worded sentence. I said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>
&gt; going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>
&gt; truth.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my attempt to be brief, I realize I sounded like I was saying I don&#39;t<br/>
WANT to correct things. What I meant to imply is that I don&#39;t want to get<br/>
petty and point fingers at people after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t have all the answers, and never said as much. I invite<br/>
speculation so long as it&#39;s colored that way, and not masked as truth.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s disappointing to have been mischaracterized and slandered by people who<br/>
don&#39;t know me. And worse yet, I&#39;m exposed to several instances of hipocrasy,<br/>
launching untruthful attacks at the Soerbaird.<br/>
<br/>
Being told not to promote our guild in this forum, and then seeing people<br/>
recruit forum members for a newly forming guild. So long as we&#39;re publicly<br/>
slandered, you can expect us to try and give an explanation or correction. <br/>
<br/>
Someone said they want a better guild guild than ours that helps people,<br/>
travels and adventures. Too bad this person has never been to our web site<br/>
and read about us. Instead, they choose to slander us. I would love to meet<br/>
you and show you all we hold dear. You&#39;d find that not only do we fit what<br/>
you&#39;re describing, but we also are encouraging each other as we write<br/>
ballads and history about Norrath and it&#39;s inhabitants.<br/>
<br/>
I would boldly say that the Soerbaird value truth. I stand by my previous<br/>
implications that spreading false information is dishonorable and selfish.<br/>
We do expect people to speak intelligently. If this is to be seen as<br/>
arrogant, then so be it. But I ask you - if your life depended on it, would<br/>
you rather ask someone who told you, &quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I think it&#39;s the<br/>
second right in Highpass&quot; or, &quot;Just take the second right in Highpass and<br/>
run for the exit&quot; - without knowing if this were true. <br/>
<br/>
I have met many young ones running quests for hours that weren&#39;t right, but<br/>
adamantly defended by the unknowing. It&#39;s this thing I hope to see squashed.<br/>
<br/>
We have high expectations of each other. Jythri has posted to that effect.<br/>
And some members, probably as one might suspect, have been reprimanded for<br/>
not upholding high standards. But I also tell you that many of us have given<br/>
the weapon in our hand, and the shirt off our back to help people in need. I<br/>
have personally fallen in combat dozens of times helping someone get their<br/>
belongings back from fatal places.<br/>
<br/>
It deeply hurts to be called arrogant, snobbish, ego-centric, and someone<br/>
even quoted me as saying:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You all are idiots, shut up if you don&#39;t know for sure.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I happen to know the right answers, but I won&#39;t tell you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow, how sad someone reads such despite out of nothing. Please consider<br/>
meeting me, or any of the Soerbaird for a truthful assessment of what we&#39;re<br/>
like.<br/>
