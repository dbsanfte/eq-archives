&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone know what the purpose of today&#39;s patch is yet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I noticed a strange hovering door in Highkeep last night in the main<br/>
&gt;entryway courtyard when you first come in that must be some kind of bug and<br/>
&gt;the High Elf who starts the Thex Dagger quest was gone and my &quot;Princess<br/>
&gt;Lenya&#39;s Amulet&quot; had its name and graphic changed to &quot;Thex charm&quot; or<br/>
&gt;something like that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also have a question, I finally have some plat saved up to where I can<br/>
&gt;begin to buy some steel armor to replace my ugly bronze until I can start<br/>
&gt;moving forward to Lambent so does anyone know if I can find size &quot;medium&quot;<br/>
&gt;steel plate armor for sale in either Freeport or Qeynos?  I know it is sold<br/>
&gt;in Kelethin but I am not sure if you can find it at these other cities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup, I think it can be bought in Qeynos, and I am SURE it can be bought in <br/>
Freeport (in East FP). I got best prices from there.<br/>
