 </span></blockquote>This is the big problem I have in battle.  Not to complain about such an excellent upgrade, but when I<br/>
first read about it I thought &quot;cool, I can make my spell colors a different color than everyone else&#39;s --<br/>
it will be *so* easy to twist.&quot;  Very disappointed to find out that all I can do is change all spell<br/>
colors.<br/>
<br/>
I tried turning off other spells in the chat filter, but that&#39;s bad because I regularly group with both a<br/>
necro and a druid.  I need to keep track of whether the mob has been &#39;darked&#39; or &#39;snared&#39; so I don&#39;t<br/>
accidentally break it with Chains.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Kunark for levels 17-23 and could only twist two songs there, unless I got lucky and we were<br/>
fighting somewhere where I was facing a wall or some other such boring background.  Since I got back, I am<br/>
having a lot of difficulty getting back into the rhythm of twisting three songs, which is very<br/>
frustrating, because I used to be able to do it automatically (no counting to three, I just *knew* when to<br/>
change songs).  Now I watch closely for my spell messages.   I&#39;ve filtered out the battle spam, which is<br/>
helping.  But if my spell colors would just show up a different color from the necro&#39;s and the druid&#39;s<br/>
(and the NPC&#39;s - which I think should be able to be made yet a third color) my life would be so much<br/>
easier.<br/>

p.s.  I made spells hot pink, which is really showing up great in both full screen and windowed view:  Red<br/>
