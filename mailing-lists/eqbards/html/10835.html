<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060421784">That&#39;s not it either.  I specifically remember bouncing off of Radiant last<br/>
night while invis without any problem.  I mean I &quot;physically&quot; bumped into<br/>
him will jogging to the Archon.  They really may have taken away &quot;see invis&quot;<br/>
from the lizards in there if they ever had it because getting through the<br/>
maze would have been extremely difficult as Sylly describes.<br/>

&gt; I have heard that RADIANT in CT sees invis, maybe you ran afoul of<br/>
&gt; him/her. She is usualy in the maze with all the others. I know that<br/>
&gt; Defenders and Warders do not see invis, as well as all th lizzies in the<br/>
&gt; TR (since i often invis by them all to look to see if the Tae Ew Templar<br/>
&gt; is in).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hmmm, maybe it&#39;s my perfume? Or my religion? Rodcet Nife.  Or<br/>
&gt; my bad luck<br/>
&gt; &gt; and invis dropped for a tick.  But definitely some lizzies see me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Defenders?  Watchmen?<br/>
