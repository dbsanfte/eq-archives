 </span></blockquote>This bug has been around for a while.  It usually happens when<br/>
you try to loot a lore item off a corpse.  The game says the<br/>
item is lore, it doesn&#39;t go into your inventory, and it<br/>
disappears from view on the corpse.  If you stand up and loot<br/>
again, it&#39;s back.  As you found out, it also happens with<br/>
stuff in your inventory, though I haven&#39;t managed to duplicate<br/>
that reliably.  Zoning or camping makes it reappear.  And it<br/>
also happens with coin if you use the /split command too soon<br/>
after another split.  It says you must wait, and if you don&#39;t<br/>
get disconnected, the money you tried to split disappears from<br/>
your inventory but isn&#39;t split.  Once you zone, it&#39;s restored<br/>
though.<br/>
