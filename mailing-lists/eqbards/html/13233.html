&gt; Now the ugly question.  What should I look for to help me identify a bad<br/>
&gt; group.  Not having gate, its helpful to make pretty quick judments on a<br/>
&gt; group since its hard to get out sometimes (in dungeons).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s more gut instinct than any specific warning<br/>
characteristics. At least for me, it just took a while but now I can<br/>
pretty easily spot the problem players in a group right off. Some<br/>
indicators I can think of are, only healing/buffing self, running around<br/>
while the designated puller is out looking or constantly suggesting the<br/>
party would be better hunting somewhere else. But those are only the<br/>
most blatant signs. If I were you I&#39;d add those 2 good players you were<br/>
with to your friends list and try to keep pace with them. Find out when<br/>
they play and try to make time to be on then. A good core group is one<br/>
of the most important things to work on at lower levels.<br/>
