A Black Burrow Lullaby<br/>
<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;When we were just new puppies&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Fallen from on high&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Our nanny Gnoll would bark us&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;A Black Burrow Lullaby&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;She&#39;d tell us to sleep quietly&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Upon our straw lined beds&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Though adventurers ran all around&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Scalping Gnollish Heads!&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;to just ignore these madmen&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Running through our room&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Turning our quiet burrow&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Into a giant tomb!&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;She said &quot;no matter all the siblings&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;You will see be slain&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;You will get revenge on all those fools&quot;<br/>
Muffin sings &quot;Once you learn to TRAIN!&quot;</div>
