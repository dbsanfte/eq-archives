<div id="ygrps-yiv-435764205">At level 31 I died twice in a row in Sol A, at the time I had 4.5 bubbles<br/>
and was not far from dinging, these 2 deaths put me back to 3 bubs, so I<br/>
lost 1.5 bubs in 2 deaths, Ouch!! A 50 cleric res on one corpse got me back<br/>
to just over 3.5 bubbles though. Yet, last night I died in 32, I had about<br/>
1.5 bubbles into the level and I only went down to a little over 1 bubble,<br/>
seems odd, another level 50 res got me 1/4 bub back.<br/>
<br/>
 Same thing happened in L Guk too the night before, I also only lost a 1/4<br/>
bub exp that time too, didn&#39;t bother with a res that time as it was such a<br/>
small amount of exp loss. However a level 50 cleric had joined the group<br/>
and I didn&#39;t realise until after I had looted &lt;sighs and cries&gt;<br/>

PS, I have been camping the Kobold Predator in Sol A over christmas, and I<br/>
have gained 6 pairs of Kobold Hide Boots and 2 Obsidian Shards, this is a<br/>
great place to camp solo and I did it at level 31. The Predator however can<br/>
be a handfull (esp with a shard), he killed me once when he had the shard<br/>
&lt;cries&gt; by the time I got back he was dead, just a corpse and nothing but a<br/>
lousy gold ring on it.<br/>

I think that was part of the point I was trying to make.  That it was<br/>
difficult to tell if the level 31 drop was really bigger than the level 30<br/>
drop since the level 30 bubbles are so much bigger than the level 31 ones.<br/>
Since I saw a bigger drop across levels on non-hell levels (or are they<br/>
mini-hell levels?) I wondered if it wasn&#39;t really a double dipping<br/>
situation<br/>
rather than a loss that was significantly greater one level up.<br/>

&gt; Hmmm, sent that before I finished or wasn&#39;t clear or something.  The next<br/>
&gt; death at 31 dropped him from two full bubbles down to just a sliver over<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; bubble.  It was definitely more than the visual lost xp when he dropped<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; 30th by at least double.  Could be some distortion from the end of bar<br/>
&gt; decorations, but wouldn&#39;t think it was that much.    It definitely<br/>
appeared<br/>
&gt; that he lost at least twice as much visible bubble space in pixels when<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; dropped from 2 bubbles and didn&#39;t lose any 30th level xp as it did when<br/>
part<br/>
&gt; of the xp loss came out of 30th.<br/>
<br/>
But then you&#39;re trying to compare level 30 bubbles to level 31<br/>
bubbles, which is literally apples to oranges.  You have to<br/>
compare using the same units.  In my anecdote and my take on<br/>
your anecdote, it was level 30 bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
All you&#39;ve really shown is that level 30 bubbles are a lot<br/>
bigger than level 31 bubbles, which we already know since<br/>
level 30 a hell level.  :)<br/>
