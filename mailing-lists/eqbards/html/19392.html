<div id="ygrps-yiv-8869453">I logged in this Sunday and saw that the MoTD was announcing the coming of<br/>
the Test of Flight on my server. The MoTD also said that we should go to<br/>
everquest.com (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html)">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html)</a> and get<br/>
the details on the event, so I went.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it turns out that the test of flight is an archery contest. It looks<br/>
fun, but as a bard, I cannot compete, because, despite the discover of a<br/>
bard usable bow, there are no arrows we can use. So I was poking around on<br/>
the same events page to see what else was up and comming that I could<br/>
participate in.<br/>
<br/>
Test of Steel... Nope.<br/>
Warrior, Monk, Paladin, Ranger and Shadow Knights are the only ones who can<br/>
enter.<br/>
<br/>
Test of Mystics... Nope.<br/>
Necromancer, Wizards, Mages and Enchanters only.<br/>
<br/>
Test of Faith... Nope.<br/>
Clerics, Paladins, Druids and Shamen only.<br/>
<br/>
So basically, I found out that there is an event for every single class,<br/>
except for bards. I was a little disappointed that I am unable to compete in<br/>
any of these events merely because Verant has no idea where bards belong in<br/>
the grand scheme of things.<br/>
<br/>
I was gonna post all of this to the EQ message boards, but I wanted to see<br/>
if you guys had any input first. I&#39;m generally opposed to whiny posts, and<br/>
I&#39;m sure that regardless of how I word my disatisfaction, that is how it<br/>
will be construed.<br/>
