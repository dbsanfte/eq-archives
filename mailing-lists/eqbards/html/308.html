&gt; PS, can anyone point everyone to a GOOD list of the songs, with<br/>
&gt;descriptions in clear English (rather than a rote copy of the uselessness<br/>
&gt;that s the player guide). If not, I will make one and let everyone give<br/>
 </span></blockquote>input.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This fellow posted his -own- descriptions of songs on the EQvault board, and<br/>
I, seeing a gem, cut and pasted them to a text document a while back.  It<br/>
served me well so far.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a few higher level bards might compile a larger list, though I won&#39;t<br/>
be needing it for a while.  I like Rynn&#39;s descriptions because they&#39;re<br/>
personal, perhaps that&#39;s why I kept them.  More like he&#39;s a music critic....<br/>

     1 Chant of battle<br/>
<br/>
     Adds Str, Ac, and DEX Full party<br/>
<br/>
     2 Chords of DIssonance<br/>
<br/>
     Area effect damage over time (when ya get lute &quot;ouch!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
     3 Jaxans Jig &#39;O vigor<br/>
<br/>
     Regenerates stamina (I don&#39;t know ANYONE who REALLY usus this song)<br/>
[roop: hey swim an ocean or sewer sometime!]<br/>
<br/>
     4 Lyssa&#39;s locating lyric<br/>
<br/>
     Finds corpses.. good money maker and imperative for those times when<br/>
you lag out... and keep running then log back in to find yourself dead<br/>
somewhere far far away from where you last were<br/>
<br/>
     5 Selo&#39;s accelerando<br/>
<br/>
     THE SONG :) Speeds you up.. use it for escapes and travel.. or just<br/>
tooling around. Saves immense amounts of time... and gets faster as you get<br/>
higher in levels. So fast actually, that bards get the safe fall skill later<br/>
on, so that we don&#39;t damage ourselves going down hills.<br/>
<br/>
     6 Hymn of restoration<br/>
<br/>
     THE SONG number two! Wait for the lute though to see the full<br/>
potential. At level 26 I believe I heal 14 to 16 hit points per &quot;flash&quot; in<br/>
game. When you first get the lute you can expect to heal at 6 per flash.<br/>
<br/>
     7 Johnthan&#39;s whistling warsong<br/>
<br/>
     Speeds up self attack, and adds str and AC. Perfect soloing song.<br/>
<br/>
     8 Kelin&#39;s lugubrious lament<br/>
<br/>
     Very different type of song. Say you have two monster&#39;s next to each<br/>
other... and you only want to attack one.  You cast lament on one, then<br/>
attack the other. The lamented one will not &quot;help&quot; the other one. Make sure<br/>
you &quot;pull&quot; the monster though, as the song effect wears off quickly, and you<br/>
want to be a ways away when that happens.<br/>
<br/>
     9 Elemental rythms<br/>
<br/>
     Adds to resist of magic, fire and cold. You will not use this one until<br/>
much later in the game. No need to buy it at level 9<br/>
<br/>
     10 Anthem de arms<br/>
<br/>
     Kinda like a full party level 7 song. Excellent song... must have.<br/>
Speeds up party attack (and speeds it up more and more as you gain levels)<br/>
<br/>
     11 Cinda&#39;s charismatic carillion<br/>
<br/>
     Dunno what is wrong with this song... but it does not seem to work.<br/>
Supposed to add charisma to yourself but all it does is &quot;nothing&quot; I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
buy it unless you know how to use it (in which case please tell me) or until<br/>
they fix it.<br/>
<br/>
     12 Brusco&#39;s boastful bellow.<br/>
<br/>
     long range damage for 7 to start... gets higher as you go up (at level<br/>
26 this song does 14 per hit for me).  IMPORTANT SONG great for pulling or<br/>
just dealing additional damage during a fight<br/>
<br/>
     13 Purifying rythms<br/>
<br/>
     adds to poison, disease and magic resist. Never used this one<br/>
really.... as it does not stack with elemental rythms, and more often than<br/>
not you want that resist from fire and cold... not poison and disease.<br/>
<br/>
     14 Lyssa&#39;s cataloging lyric<br/>
<br/>
     No need for this song since magic items already appear as identified.<br/>
Besides it costs like 20 PP...<br/>
<br/>
     15 Kelin&#39;s lucid lullaby<br/>
<br/>
     GOt 100 monsters attacking you? Want them to stop? Play this song and<br/>
put them all to sleep... If yer good enough.... you could sleep 10 or so<br/>
monsters comfortably while your party kills them one at a time. GREAT<br/>
song... and HEAVILY used at higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
     16 Tarew&#39;s aquatic something or other :)<br/>
<br/>
     Water breathing. Only thing I have used it for it to take a peek into<br/>
Kedge Keep... and underwater dungeon that  NEEDS some kind of water<br/>
breathing since it is ALL underwater. Level 40 plus dungeon I hear.. and I<br/>
don&#39;t doubt it since the darn fish there are red to me at 26 :) No real need<br/>
to buy this one until later, but good song for practicing wind instruments.<br/>
<br/>
     17 Guardian rythms<br/>
<br/>
     I have begun using this song ALOT. When you are up against casting<br/>
monsters, this song puts up a spell shield, and raises magic resist by alot.<br/>
Gives you a few AC too.<br/>
<br/>
     18 Denon&#39;s disruptive discord.<br/>
<br/>
     Uses BRASS, so I never used the song... until a few days ago. GREAT<br/>
SONG Lowers target AC, and damages  them about one and a half times as much<br/>
as the level two song does. Use it and get yer brass skill up there....<br/>
you&#39;ll want it for the level 26 song. Area effect<br/>
<br/>
     19 Shauri&#39;s sonorous clouding.<br/>
<br/>
     party invisible. Rough song... works fine solo, but if you are using a<br/>
group you will want see invis on everyone, or else it will be too hard to<br/>
follow everyone when you cannot see them. Important for getting corpses deep<br/>
in the  higher level dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
     20 Largo&#39;s melodic binding<br/>
<br/>
     Area effect lowers target attack speed and AC. I never really used this<br/>
one... but perhaps it will come in useful later.<br/>
<br/>
     21 Melanie&#39;s mellifluous motion.<br/>
<br/>
     Teleport random direction, random distance. This song is a cruel joke<br/>
in my opininon, as I see no use for it yet but to plant yourself in the<br/>
middle of a nest of monsters that will beat the crap out of you. I will have<br/>
to experiment more with it though... could be useful.. but I highly doubt<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
     22 Alenia&#39;s disenchanting melody<br/>
<br/>
     Same as wizard cancel magic spell. works on whole party. I never used<br/>
it.... I assume it is useful later.<br/>
<br/>
     23 Selo&#39;s consonant chain.<br/>
<br/>
     BUY IT This is a great soloing song. This will do two things... slow<br/>
the target to a walk if it is running after you, or root it if the target is<br/>
escaping. Wanna get rid of Ambassador DVinn? sing this song on him and blast<br/>
away at him  with the level 12 song as he walks around helpless. (Although,<br/>
that tactic will take you a long time... and is so boring it makes ya wanna<br/>
cry)<br/>
<br/>
     24 (forget the name)<br/>
<br/>
     Sharpens sight. Now I dunno what the heck that means but I know for one<br/>
it lets you see invisible. It also gives everything a blueish tint... odd.<br/>
<br/>
     25 Psalm of warmth.<br/>
<br/>
     Adds to resist cold... but not enough that it seems to be worth it?<br/>
Although it does use singing which is always nice.<br/>
<br/>
     26 Angst&#39;s appaling screech<br/>
<br/>
     COOL! A song with the face of death on it!! :) Grab a horn... set up<br/>
the song, and go get a crazy battle going.  Looks like yer gonna lose? Play<br/>
this song and every monster around you runs screaming. Basically a fear song<br/>
for bards.. but it will hit 100 targets if there are that many.<br/>
<br/>
     FUnny thing about this song. I was messing around in crushbone (which<br/>
if you did not know, there is a recent problem there with retion brenclog,<br/>
who likes to cast 200 pets and kill the framerate in the zone) Well since<br/>
all these pets are such low level to me, I decided I would fear them all<br/>
with my new song. OH JEEZ :) It worked...  and 200 pets come screaming outta<br/>
the hole in the ground... I kept fearing them and they ran all over the zone<br/>
causing such a disturbance that a GM was there within minutes to kill them<br/>
all. (nobody got killed, the pets are neutral, friendly little guys). I wish<br/>
I had taken screenshots as it was quite a sight to see :)<br/>
<br/>
     level 27 I hear is a charm spell... &quot;Oh boy!&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
     Well, hope that helped a bit... keep playing the bard... and you&#39;ll<br/>
always be happy :)<br/>
