<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Few tips:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)  Do not group with him<br/>
&gt; 2)  Charm him and make him attack his pet (he can&#39;t cast <br/>
&gt; spells at all, pet<br/>
&gt; may even kill him before charm wears off)<br/>
&gt; 3)  Rinse and repeat<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you wish to pay him back for being a jerk without causing him to loose<br/>
experience, have hotkeyed something like:<br/>
<br/>
/say &quot;Wow!  You really DO have great pets!&quot;<br/>
/em cringes as he watches the poor little mage get torn to shreads<br/>
/say &quot;Did that hurt?  Because it looked like it hurt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and for laughs<br/>
<br/>
/pet who leader<br/>
<br/>
But do let him suicide his pet before it kills him.<br/>
