&gt; That&#39;s been an interesting topic among the developers here at work.  they<br/>
&gt; had a different take from everyone else on the proliferation of No Drop<br/>
&gt; items.  There is a group here who believe it is the enormous number of<br/>
&gt; items<br/>
&gt; ever growing in the character databases that Verant is concerned about.<br/>
&gt; By<br/>
&gt; making them No Drop they were trying to keep the number of in game objects<br/>
&gt; down.  An interesting speculation and a reason why it took so long to get<br/>
&gt; the bank set up to accept No Drop items perhaps.<br/>

person can keep.  8 characters x 8 bank slots x 10 backpack slots = 6400<br/>
items, plus the items on the 8 characters, per account, per shard.  Of<br/>
course this is exluding stackable items, but light-stones aren&#39;t stackable.<br/>
Stackable items can only increase this by 20 fold, assuming that everything<br/>
you owned was stackable.<br/>
