 </span></blockquote>A *very* close friend of mine is a jeweler.  He says the power of magic<br/>
jewelery comes from the metal used, which has to be enchanted before you<br/>
add the stone.  Silver makes the least powerful, then electrum, gold, and<br/>
platinum.  Those four metals represent increasing expense and increasing<br/>
difficulty of enchantment, in terms of the level of enchant spell used.<br/>
<br/>
So the type of enchanted metal determines the power level.<br/>
<br/>
The type of stone determines what&#39;s affected: saves against some hazard or<br/>
a personal characteristic such as strength or wisdom.  Stones have widely<br/>
different monetary values.<br/>
<br/>
The combination of which metal and which stone determines whether you get<br/>
earring, bracelet, veil or whatever.  The jeweler can&#39;t choose.<br/>
<br/>
Jewelers generally price what they make based on what it costs for<br/>
materials, and how badly people want the particular enhancement.  Most<br/>
tradespeople seem to go for a price about double the cost of materials, to<br/>
cover their time and the failures that are especially painful with<br/>
expensive items.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are some types of jewelery that jewelers can&#39;t make, such as<br/>
agility earrings.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway that&#39;s what my friend Dweomerforge the enchanter and jeweler tells me.<br/>
