<div id="ygrps-yiv-543686428">1. Bards are better than all Pure Casters and Priests in melee. (MAG, WIZ,<br/>
ENC, NEC, CLR, SHA, DRU)<br/>
2. Bards are better than all hybrids in magical power. (PAL, RNG, SK)<br/>
<br/>
The above statements are facts and cannot be disputed.  Every Bard should<br/>
understand these facts.<br/>
<br/>
If someone tries to contradict one of the above statements, I will point<br/>
them out as a liar.  Especially to those Bards who have been on this list<br/>
quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to the nature of my messages, in the past I have made some poor choices.<br/>
But I&#39;ve tried to do better.  I looked at my last five messages and saw<br/>
nothing out of the ordinary.  I&#39;d be glad to discuss any of my posts with<br/>
you or anyone else in private, not on the list.<br/>

&gt;     Just curious, what server do you play on and do you play a bard?  The<br/>
&gt; reason I ask is because you emails are consistently sniping in nature and<br/>
&gt; generally flamebait.  I&#39;ll be the first to defend your right to free<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; however I would ask that you perhaps temper somewhat your future remarks<br/>
&gt; with the fact this is a public forum meant for discussion -- closing doors<br/>
&gt; via naked accusations and bombastic proclamations offers little room for<br/>
&gt; such to take place on a mutually respectful level. </span></blockquote></div>
