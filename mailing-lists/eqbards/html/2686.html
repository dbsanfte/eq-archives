: So we are all real good online Bards and have excellent musical abilities<br/>
to<br/>
: the point of powerful magic, etc.  But what about in /ooc real life?<br/>
Anyone<br/>
: have any talent or interest?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really post here much, just use it as a sorce for info, but since<br/>
you want to know, I am a musician in real life.  Since fourth grade I&#39;ve<br/>
played the alto saxophone (I&#39;m about to start my senior year in high school,<br/>
so that&#39;s 8 or so years of instrumental music).  One of my older brothers is<br/>
a music major at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, primarily playing<br/>
the trombone, and he was my major influence to starting an instrument.  I<br/>
look up to him in his musical talent, and strive to emulate his success.<br/>
So, I picked up the piano, and the guitar to match his diversity (although<br/>
he has since learned other instruments as requirements for his classes) and<br/>
although I&#39;m not very good with the piano I am pretty skilled with the<br/>
guitar.  As far as the sax goes, I play it in symphony band, marching band<br/>
and jazz band all playing lead part since my sophomore year.  I also did<br/>
some tracking and engineering or my brother&#39;s punk band for a bit until they<br/>
got money, and that was a great experience.  Right now, music and videogames<br/>
are my life and they probably will be until the day I die.  As I strum<br/>
chords on the guitar and run back and forth from the piano and the computer<br/>
trying to copy the ideas down on staff with Allegro &#39;98, I dream of a future<br/>
career in the videogame music field.  As someone else said, I sure wish<br/>
there were ways to incorporate MIDIs to be heard in the game.  You know,<br/>
just send out a tiny little patch everytime a bard submits something new<br/>
(MIDI files are really small and insanely quick downloads), but that&#39;s<br/>
impractical and then there&#39;s the issue of needing to copywrite them before<br/>
submition if you want credit for em and such.<br/>
Blah, enough...<br/>
