<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959531408">I hate what they&#39;ve done to Kithicor. I personally don&#39;t mind the mobs as a <br/>
50th, but I made the mistake of going afk at RV zone with my druid and <br/>
someone trained 4 or 5 uber-skellies there. Luckily I got back in time to <br/>
zone. It&#39;s the location. They should&#39;ve put these mobs somewhere else like <br/>
in Lesser Faydark. I feel sorry for halfling newbies that don&#39;t have friends<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lesser Faydark?  You gotta be kidding, then Gnomes would have no way out of<br/>
Steamfont.  That&#39;d be far worse as Lesser Fay has always had 5-10 times as<br/>
many people in it as Kithicor.  Not to mention there have always been some<br/>
undead in Kithicor so it fits the storyline far better there.<br/>
