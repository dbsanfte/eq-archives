<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963220661">***Character Purge***<br/>
<br/>
Time has come to do some cleanup on character data across the servers.  On<br/>
August 23rd (Pacific), we will be doing a system-wide cleanup of level 1<br/>
characters.  All level 1 characters that have that have not been played<br/>
within 30 days from the date of the purge will be deleted.  As GMs will not<br/>
be able to restore any characters that are deleted, please be certain to log<br/>
in any level 1 characters that you wish to keep prior to the purge.<br/>

*Kunark Users*<br/>
<br/>
A new file, emeraldjungle_chr.s3d, is included as part of todays patch. This<br/>
patch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald Jungle.  Please run<br/>
the &quot;Kunark Patch&quot; by pressing the &quot;Kunark Patch&quot; button on the bottom of<br/>
the patch program UI prior to entering EverQuest.<br/>
<br/>
*Patch Day*<br/>
<br/>
Greetings everyone! Today&#39;s patch contains some exciting new changes.<br/>
<br/>
*General Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means<br/>
that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all<br/>
subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot<br/>
easier to pick out separate messages.<br/>
- The spells &quot;United Resolve&quot; and &quot;Heroic Bond&quot; had their levels transposed<br/>
accidentally.  Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has<br/>
been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that<br/>
spell in your spellbook.  Feel free to move one to the back.  Clerics get a<br/>
new group spell at 58 to compensate.<br/>
- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.<br/>
- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.<br/>
- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure<br/>
caster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more<br/>
mana, regardless of their stats.<br/>
- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a<br/>
&quot;NORENT&quot; tag when inspecting the item.<br/>
- Most summoned items now have the word &quot;summoned&quot; in their name.<br/>
<br/>
*Changes/Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br/>
- Scaler recipe now works<br/>
- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch<br/>
- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.<br/>
- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work<br/>
- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.<br/>
- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br/>
- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than<br/>
pelts of quality.  This has been repaired.<br/>
- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.<br/>
- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.<br/>
- Many pathing errors have been repaired.<br/>
- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or feared.<br/>
- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword<br/>
of Xuzl from disappearing.<br/>
<br/>
*Dragons?*<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should<br/>
be<br/>
noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than<br/>
is<br/>
intended.  Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another<br/>
week,<br/>
we&#39;ve decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch.<br/>
Enjoy :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*New Command For Tracking*<br/>
<br/>
New option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will work<br/>
for<br/>
all players with the tracking skill.  The command has two settings:<br/>
<br/>
- ON: Default setting, same as it is now.  Players will show up in the<br/>
tracking window.<br/>
- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.<br/>
<br/>
*Client Customizations*<br/>
<br/>
Upon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in your<br/>
EverQuest directory.  This file contains customizable settings for:<br/>
<br/>
- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window<br/>
- - Default screen viewing mode<br/>
- - Default travel speed (run or walk)<br/>
<br/>
The documentation will be included in the online manual in your EverQuest<br/>
directory once the design is finalized over the next several weeks, but the<br/>
working document is posted below.  We felt that people would rather have<br/>
access to the customizations right away while we&#39;re in the process of<br/>
building them.<br/>
<br/>
Modifying this file is optional.<br/>
<br/>
*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*<br/>
<br/>
The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the<br/>
client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in<br/>
decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. &quot;Black&quot; (0<br/>
red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in Normal<br/>
mode.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:<br/>
<br/>
1 - Say<br/>
2 - Tell<br/>
3 - Group<br/>
4 - Guild<br/>
5 - OOC<br/>
6 - Auction<br/>
7 - Shout<br/>
8 - Emote<br/>

10 - You hit other<br/>

13 - Other misses you<br/>
14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br/>
15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br/>
18 - Default text and stuff you type<br/>

22 - Your death message<br/>
23 - Others death message<br/>
24 - Other damage other<br/>

<br/>
The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is<br/>
a list of valid settings:<br/>
<br/>
RunMode - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br/>
ScreenMode - NORMAL for the default window view, FULL for the full view with<br/>
overlays<br/>
