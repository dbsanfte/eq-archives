<div id="ygrps-yiv-382123474"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     I&#39;ve noticed all of the issues people have complained about so far.  <br/>
&gt;The<br/>
&gt;problem (like most grouping  problems) are usually the worst in &quot;pick-up<br/>
&gt;groups&quot; and nonexistent in regular and guild groups.  Otherwise most <br/>
&gt;systems<br/>
&gt;work pretty well.  When doing FFA&#39;s I tell people to count five corpses <br/>
&gt;then<br/>
&gt;loot the sixth one (assuming a six-member party).  With &quot;honorable&quot; people<br/>
&gt;it works pretty well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     What galls me the most are the rash of characters named &quot;Aaaba&quot; and<br/>
&gt;&quot;Aaada&quot; (the three a&#39;s is NOT a typo here).  Obviously these character <br/>
&gt;names<br/>
&gt;were decided purely to go first in alpha loot.  With a character name<br/>
&gt;starting with &quot;S&quot; I&#39;m usually one of the last to loot.  Even in &quot;honorable&quot;<br/>
&gt;groups - when we do the 5pp or item loot - I often don&#39;t get my turn.<br/>
&gt;However - I usually am with my guildmates who will split their share with <br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;in those cases - often even when I don&#39;t ask!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My favorite method of looting in as far as monetary gain is concerned is <br/>
master-looting. Of course this does not always work well with pick-up <br/>
groups, but generally it is fair as long as the master looter is <br/>
trustworthy. He loots everything and splits the cash/FS items either at the <br/>
end of the night or when someone has to leave.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to work great for us when money is an issue to entire party. <br/>
Lately however we have reserved most money and FS loots for the clerics <br/>
because Peridots can easily burn a hole in their wallets, as well as wizards <br/>
who need it for PoH trips (250 plat per gate is hella expensive when you <br/>
have to evac ever so often).<br/>
