<div id="ygrps-yiv-120037537"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; only problem with aria is it only removes one buff per pulse, and<br/>
&gt; sometimes<br/>
&gt; it takes more than one pulse to remove a buff (unless they changed it).  i<br/>
&gt; like to use it in duels though :)  casters, however, have cancel magic<br/>
&gt; spells that remove 3 buffs in one cast, so if they are willing to<br/>
&gt; use it it<br/>
&gt; is more effective.  however you do it though, it&#39;s very important<br/>
&gt; to get rid<br/>
&gt; of damage shields and especially SoW on mobs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, casters have better ones!  But I&#39;ve found, discouragingly, that most<br/>
casters never have theirs memmed and that&#39;s precious time that we need those<br/>
buffs OFF :)  and I can have their dmg shield down in at least 3 seconds<br/>
(and I&#39;ve never needed more than 2 pulses)  Generally it doesn&#39;t take long<br/>
to teach the casters not to throw any debuffs or dots till the tanks stop<br/>
getting burned or chilled.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, it&#39;s SOOOOOO good to feel useful<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lyrnia!  It&#39;s got a dmg shield&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;on it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thanks&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the psalm i use most in normal fighting is actually mystic shielding.  for<br/>
&gt; huge boosts, it&#39;s usually rhythm songs with drum.  too bad psalms don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stack with themselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm I haven&#39;t messed with mystic shielding much.  I usually use warmth<br/>
(because it stacks with druid and magician shields) and extra dmg is always<br/>
nice.  Do you find it more useful than dmg shields?  Groups I&#39;m in actually<br/>
prefer it over Hymn during combat.  (Dunno for sure which is better ;)  I<br/>
think psalm of warmth because 1 hit from most mobs cancels about 60 seconds<br/>
of hymn these days ;) and in that 60 seconds the mob could have taken enough<br/>
dmg to prevent 5 70 point hits by dying sooner from the extra 8 dmg per hit<br/>
during the fight...<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on that Shada?  I haven&#39;t really tested it and you and a few<br/>
others are far more analytical than I am.  DMG shields or Healing?  Which<br/>
way do you go?<br/>
