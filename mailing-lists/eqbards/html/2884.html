<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992760195">1 more question to add to this thread - how much do these go for?  I was<br/>
lucky enuf to acquire a pair of elf-hide gloves (thank you Lamont :)<br/>
already, and with no other Bards in my normal party, I think these would be<br/>
great items to bring out and sell from our upcoming return to Guk.  I am<br/>
currently &quot;trying&quot; to upgrade to Plate mail of some kind and am being<br/>
extremelly unsuccessful finding any medium bronze for sale, anywhere.<br/>
Aparently the mobs in Permafrost that carry it are well beyond my current<br/>
level (21).  So, that leaves me with the option of buying steel plate.<br/>
OUCH!  Needless to say, unless Bronze starts showing up, I&#39;m gonna be<br/>
needing some heavy cash.  : )<br/>
<br/>
I had the idea of going to Cazic and trying to buy thrown away plate from<br/>
players who have just found Rubicite....  : )<br/>

&gt;I am looking for the Elfhide Gloves in Upper Guk. These are the +5 Agi and<br/>
&gt;+5 dex gloves useble ONLY by Bards and Rogues. I was TOLD that they are on<br/>
&gt;someone named &quot;The Warden&quot;, who is supposedly the Warden of the jail cells<br/>
&gt;in Upper Gukk. My group camped there for QUITE a long time this evening and<br/>
&gt;never saw him once. Does anyone know exaclty where he spawns? Is there some<br/>
&gt;sort of trigger? We kept seeing Knights and Warriors, but never a Warden.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are ALSO looking for the trollhide belt. Again, I was told this SAME<br/>
&gt;invidual bears it. Is this true? If not, who has it, and where? And of<br/>
&gt;course, is this ALSO a Bard/Rogue only item?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THANK YOU for any help you can provide!<br/>
