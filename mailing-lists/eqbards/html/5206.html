&gt; Oh sorry, thought I gave you numbers, I tried to use Denons 30 times and<br/>
&gt; missed notes everytime. It never fired. Are those good enough?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, you said &quot;maybe a total of 30 times&quot;.   Not exactly precise numbers.<br/>
So you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s a 100 percent failure rate on a sample size of 30?  I<br/>
certainly understand why you&#39;d be upset.  Thing is, that&#39;s awfully hard to<br/>
believe when I haven&#39;t had a failure rate of higher than 10 percent on any song<br/>
I&#39;ve tested with recently.  Nobody else is claiming 100 percent failure rates<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be combative here, I&#39;m trying to figure out, with a little<br/>
rigor, what&#39;s happening here, because simply bitching about it isn&#39;t going to<br/>
get the problem fixed, if there is one.<br/>
