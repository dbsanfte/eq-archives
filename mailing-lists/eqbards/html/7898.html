You and I think alike:-)  <br/>
<br/>
I have yet to kill a froglok so my faction with them should be indifferent.<br/>
This should allow me to safely go whereever the spawn is for the Guise and<br/>
pay someone to let me loot it.  Anyone have a idea of how much I should<br/>
offer for the looting rights? <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the subject of twinking, or at least related to it.  I would very much<br/>
&gt; like to obtain a Guise of the Deceiver.  Wait, don&#39;t flame me yet I know<br/>
&gt; its<br/>
&gt; No Drop.  I would be willing to accompany a party to Lower Guk if they are<br/>
&gt; going there anyhow and pay for the right to loot one off the assassin.<br/>
&gt; From<br/>
&gt; what I understand there are groups hunting him for his rare drop, whatever<br/>
&gt; that is, that already have one for everyone in their party.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; able to find anyone like this on E&#39;ci but my higher level contacts are<br/>
&gt; limited.  If anyone is going there and would be interested in minorly<br/>
&gt; twinking my poor little bard please let me know.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are several quests I&#39;d like to explore and this is the only way I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; get the chance short of retiring my bard for about 6 months to build up an<br/>
&gt; evil character.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thank you for your time in this blatant request for aid and assistance.<br/>
