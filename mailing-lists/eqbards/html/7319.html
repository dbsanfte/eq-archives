&gt;I believe they&#39;re needed for research. Not that that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;very useful for Bards.. but for casters, they need the<br/>
&gt;languages. But that&#39;s just what I&#39;ve heard, can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;verify it myself.<br/>

all the time, and each time a gnoll yelled at you, you actually had a chance<br/>
to learn a little gnollish. :) So in the begging you&#39;d see:<br/>
<br/>
A gnoll says, &#39;Wok wollo ulmplatim oke an llyels om lma obbla for!&#39;<br/>

And it would soon become:<br/>
<br/>
A gnoll says, &#39;Your infamous reputation is an affront to all I stand for!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Would be neat watching it improve as you learn.<br/>
