<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472015084">Just 2 days ago, I decided to try:<br/>
<br/>
Silver Jacinth rings: 10ac, -7 MR<br/>
<br/>
Had 2 made and went to all-ac gear. I am 920ish AC (iirc) now without songs<br/>
or buffs (Froglok Scale BP, Imbrued Greaves and SS everything else.) Cougar<br/>
ears and Mith Torque, Guise of Deceiver (could prolly do better here),<br/>
Obulous mantle, Cloak of Shadows (prestige and +dex) and Sainy&#39;s Claw for<br/>
10ac.<br/>
<br/>
I figured that with GRM in &#39;real groups&#39; or Psalm of Mystic Shielding - I<br/>
will be fine when I need MR.<br/>
<br/>
Have I noticed anything remarkable?  Not really.  I have been helping my<br/>
wizard level by pulling snow cougars.  I use shield of songs (rune buff)<br/>
then time my mez with his nukes. Mez lands right after his nuke.  Got bored<br/>
and tried to explore Tower of Frozen Shadow.  Managed to agro 3 things, run<br/>
to the wrong mirror, and died - all this on the first floor too!. /sigh<br/>
<br/>
So now, my ac 5 hp 55 rings get passed to my rogue, I have ac 6 hp 66 ones<br/>
for back up.  Also carry black plat pearl for dex if I get mad at missed<br/>
notes and some Opal ones (poison resists?) if people get bored and want to<br/>
kill Sev or Trak.<br/>

I&#39;ve worn the 5ac, 55hps rings for a long time now, and recently <br/>
upgraded to the velium 6ac, 65hp rings.  I keep some +7 all resist <br/>
rings around for resistance type situations.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, didn&#39;t you guys hear?  No one on Xegony is allowed to hit 53 <br/>
until they get an extra Vox scale for me. :)  Hmm... I just thought <br/>
of something... I&#39;ve never been the eBaying kind of guy, but it may <br/>
just pay to buy a 52 account JUST to get the Vox Scale.  Then again, <br/>
maybe there&#39;s already a Vox scale there. :)<br/>
