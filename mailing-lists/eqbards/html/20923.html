I agree with you on the experience parts of your post, not a big deal, and<br/>
its not going to change.<br/>
<br/>
On the song related parts of your post though, have you been living under a<br/>
rock for the last 6 months?<br/>
<br/>
There have been numerous postings to the EQ boards, emails directly to GZ<br/>
and Abashi, posts on the EQ_Caster&#39;s Board (which they do read), as well as<br/>
messages sent thru Baelish (runs EQ_Casters, talks to GZ nearly daily).  <br/>
<br/>
Many of these posts have contained ridiculously detailed information on the<br/>
problems with the broken songs.  John Kim and myself have broken the things<br/>
down statistically to the point where it was readily apparent that the<br/>
resist rates were down to tenths of a percent with variances of +/- 2 tenths<br/>
of a percent.<br/>
<br/>
There is ABSOLUTELY no way they can claim they don&#39;t know what we think is<br/>
wrong with these songs and still be truthful.  They ARE ignoring us.<br/>
(Harmonic is gone right?  If not, my apologies Harm)<br/>
Well maybe they aren&#39;t ignoring us, but in that case they are purposely<br/>
lying to us instead.  I prefer to assume the former.<br/>

1) They aren&#39;t ignoring us. Instead they just have no idea that we think<br/>
there is a problem that needs to be looked at. Abashi is a busy man, I&#39;m<br/>
willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that he missed our<br/>
posts or forgot them.<br/>
<br/>
2) If we can make them aware of what we think is wrong, then we can get them<br/>
to look at it and there is a possibility that we can get it fixed. This to<br/>
me is good news. The only problem is how to get our thoughts looked at. I<br/>
suggest we write up a concise description of the problems. (insane resist<br/>
rates on pixie strike and lullaby and ineffectiveness of snare since the<br/>
patch) then we post it to the bug board and the gameplay board, as well as<br/>
emailing it to abashi.<br/>
