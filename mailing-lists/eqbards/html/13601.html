<div id="ygrps-yiv-754343692">I thought they had fixed that fear bug.  In the last 6 or so dragon runs <br/>
none of our casters have complained about it.  If they are hit by it have <br/>
them go LD using /quit and come right back.  Also there is no min on dragon <br/>
breath as over the weekend we did both Nag & Vox (other guilds were sloted <br/>
to do them but they could not take em and yield them to my guild).  And in <br/>
both runs I has taking as little as 1/8th a bubble from dragon breaths.  My <br/>
FR/CR was 220+ in both cases.<br/>

&gt; &gt; So, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - <br/>
&gt;15,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Which does absolutely nothing, as pillage enchantment strips buffs<br/>
&gt;   seemingly randomly.  My first buff was Illusion: DE yet he stripped<br/>
&gt;   my Agility and Strength in the first attack (which both were in the<br/>
&gt;   middle of my buff list).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Our L22 song is the same way.  It took me 4 pulses to remove resist<br/>
&gt;   fire from myself, and Reso/SoW took 2 or 3.  Things that stripped<br/>
&gt;   first:  Shaman buffs.  Things that went last:  Resist buffs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   In the wave against Nagafen, I had 170 FR.  And again, I lost<br/>
&gt;   a full bubble of health, confirmed this time with 2100+ hps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   DragonBreath does one bubble of damage if you are in melee range<br/>
&gt;   as a minimum (with 2000 hps).  The key here is in melee range, as<br/>
&gt;   our cleric was hit with AE far back, and took much much less dmg.<br/>
&gt;   Magic resist in the 200s, and I still got feared once briefly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The new AE Fear also bugs casters as once they are hit, there is<br/>
&gt;   a chance they will not be able to cast spells.  (You have not<br/>
&gt;   recovered... permanently)  With our casters in this state, it<br/>
&gt;   was pure melee that brought the dragon to the &#39;Lord&#39; in Lord<br/>
&gt;   Nagafen.  But it was without healing and nuking, umm hehe there&#39;s only<br/>
&gt;   so much the melee peeps can do.  Too bad the programmers at Verant<br/>
&gt;   cannot get their stuff straight.  It&#39;s a shame the players have<br/>
&gt;   to pay for their constant mistakes.<br/>
