<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233933228">she is talking about Guard McCluskey right?  for some reason, this guard<br/>
HATES bards, he hangs out in the tower i think to the south (i don&#39;t know<br/>
the area either).  he is a corrupt qeynos guard, i think in the 30ish<br/>
levels?  other than killing him for faction, i don&#39;t know of any quest.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Funny, I met a NPC Bard in Qhills the other day. I had never <br/>
&gt; noticed her<br/>
&gt; before (as I am a wood elf, never spent much time there) I hailed her<br/>
&gt; and she reponded something like &quot;Hello Uldar, I must warn you <br/>
&gt; if you are<br/>
&gt; a fellow bard you won&#39;t make any profits with Lt. Soandso around&quot; (no<br/>
&gt; brackets, can&#39;t remember Lt&#39;s name). When I responded &quot;who is Lt.<br/>
&gt; Soandso&quot; she responded &quot;I will say no more on this matter&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was in the middle of something, and I assumed that if I <br/>
&gt; ever found out<br/>
&gt; what she was talking about and it turned out to  be a quest I <br/>
&gt; would get<br/>
&gt; a rusty weapon and 2cp for my trouble, so I left. BTW, she <br/>
&gt; considered me<br/>
&gt; Kindy, so not a faction problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone know anything about this wandering bard of Qhills? </span></blockquote></div>
