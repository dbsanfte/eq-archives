&gt; what i heard was that soon the ghoul lord will drop a sword that is warrior<br/>
&gt; only with similar stats.  just a rumour as of now, i haven&#39;t heard this<br/>
&gt; happening on any live servers yet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I heard also.  This obviously means that Verant is going to add a <br/>
really nice Bard-only weapon with similar stats.  They certainly wouldn&#39;t drop <br/>
the Ykesha spawn, replace it only with a warrior-only weapon, and thereby <br/>
deprive us of one of the best weapons in the normal game without compensating <br/>
us.  (drips with sarcasm)<br/>

PS  I would say that it doesn&#39;t matter to me, since my level 50 warrior friend <br/>
has two Ykeshas which he will surely want to replace, and I can probably wheedle <br/>
them away from him.  Verant surely wouldn&#39;t nerf the existing Ykeshas by making <br/>
them no-drop.  (drips with sarcasm, again)<br/>

PPS  Ah, who cares?  I&#39;m switching to instruments now, anyway.  :)</div>
