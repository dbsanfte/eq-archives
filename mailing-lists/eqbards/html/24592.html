<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798025559">I&#39;d recommend getting your Kael faction up - while somewhat time consuming<br/>
it&#39;s not that hard - particularly at our levels (I&#39;m 54).<br/>
<br/>
When I decided to do this - I had already hunted more in Skyshrine than in<br/>
Kael so that helped somewhat.  Hunting in Skyshrine will get Kromzek faction<br/>
up pretty quickly.  You need to get this to dubious ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
Next go to the Coldain Camps in Eastern Wastes.  You&#39;ll be able to single<br/>
pull and solo the greens without any difficulty.  I never fought the named<br/>
blue ones - but I know a lot of them don&#39;t give faction - so unless you are<br/>
doing this with friends - and are primarily doing it for faction - you don&#39;t<br/>
want them anyway.  Plus several of them are quest mobs - so you won&#39;t want<br/>
to kill unless you&#39;re a greedy jerk like so many people on Xegony are (not<br/>
caring you killed a mob that spawns 24 hours and messes up someone else&#39;s<br/>
attempt at doing a quest).<br/>
<br/>
Killing these guys will get you both Kromrif and Kromzek faction (slowly) -<br/>
and they drop Heads.  When you&#39;ve collected heads - and have enough faction<br/>
to use Charismatic Carrilon to get Kromzek faction to dubious - you can go<br/>
to the bank area in Kael - and hand the heads (one at a time) to the Captain<br/>
there.  You&#39;ll get 2-6p and a bit of XP and all three factions for the<br/>
heads.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I&#39;m at warmly with Kromzek and dubious with Kromrif - so I can now<br/>
cross Kael safely (as long as I don&#39;t wander to Tormax mobs). Tormax is the<br/>
hardest to get up.  Other than the heads (which takes forever - a guildie of<br/>
mine did so to do a quest for a weap he got from an item that dropped in<br/>
Western Wastes).  The fastest way - requires you to hunt royals in Icewell<br/>
Keep.  They are VERY tough - as they are 99 pct resistant (to everything but<br/>
lures I believe) - you&#39;ll need a really good party with a 60 puller...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - if you have a lot of time on your hand - just spend a LOT of time<br/>
killing the green dorfies and collect heads...<br/>

Kael is a tough zone.  As a 39 bard I&#39;ve found that charasmatic Carrilion<br/>
has limited effect for me and sneak is the way to go if your faction is low<br/>
and you need something.  The good quests are all in King Tormax&#39;s area and<br/>
you can&#39;t get thru there with invis song -- you may be able to sneak but one<br/>
of the &quot;features&quot; of Kael is that anyone dragging a body is KOS, regardless<br/>
of faction so plan for a difficult CR if things go badly.<br/>
If you are going thru Kael using sonorous clouding, be sure to con giants at<br/>
regular intervals.  If any of them see thru the song, you are likely close<br/>
to the temple of Rallos Zek, a very bad place to be, even if you are<br/>
agnostic -- all bards are KOS there.<br/>

Has anyone successfully charm/sneak/invis their way in to some Kael or SS<br/>
armor? I&#39;m thinking of trying the Iceshackles and Dragon Tooth quests even<br/>
though I&#39;m KOS and would love some experienced advice - and hope that<br/>
someday I can get the SS armor if I get the gems.<br/>
