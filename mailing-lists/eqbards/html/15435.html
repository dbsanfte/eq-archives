<br/>
I camped Efreeti tonight with some friends (1 efreet, million PHes *YAWN*) <br/>
and got a burning sash LORE/NO DROP ALL/ALL no stats from an imp protector. <br/>
I have no idea what this item is for, and i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s been added <br/>
recently (maybe as recent as the latest patch) because I haven&#39;t been to <br/>
efreeti in months.<br/>
<br/>
I told a friend about it and he said he has heard it may be part of a bard <br/>
quest. He referred me to another mutual acquaintance that is big into <br/>
questing. This person told me he saw an NPC bard zooming around Rathe Mt <br/>
yesterday using selo&#39;s (I&#39;ve never ever seen an NPC bard using songs so I <br/>
don&#39;t really know what to think). He said the NPC said something about a <br/>
&quot;burning&quot; something or other and he thinks the sash may have something to do <br/>
with a quest (hopefuly) for bards. He also thinks this NPC was added as <br/>
recently as the latest patch.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows anything about this please post info - i&#39;m sure the bardic <br/>
community would appreciate it.<br/>
