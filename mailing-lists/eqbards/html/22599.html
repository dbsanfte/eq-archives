<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680975263">Hrrm didn&#39;t know they changed size of hate list. I guess that explains why <br/>
last nuke to hit doesn&#39;t get kill most of the time anymore. =) I&#39;ve survived <br/>
quite a few fights, but for some reason haven&#39;t taken faction hits most of <br/>
the time. I am still warmly (or kindly I forget) to Kunark dragons. I <br/>
specifically remember standing under Silverwing and watching Alloria get the <br/>
killshot (of all people a cleric) while I was grouped with her. No faction <br/>
hit whatsoever. Later I definitely got a hit from Phara Dar, but I am still <br/>
not KoS. Only a matter of time I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the faction hate list is huge now, no longer only a max of 6 people, so if<br/>
&gt;you fight in VP and survive any fights you will get a hit and you will no<br/>
&gt;longer be non-KOS to the outdoor dragons or the VP dragons =/  i was warmly<br/>
&gt;when i went in, haven&#39;t conned anything since but i think i only survived 1<br/>
&gt;or 2 fights at the most.  i may be non-KOS til next trip.<br/>
