&gt; Well, I hate to say it, and I know there&#39;s gonna be a bunch more deaths as<br/>
&gt; a result of this, but I&#39;m glad they implemented this change.  Sure, it<br/>
&gt; nerfs our ability to help our teammates - but these are the same teammates<br/>

&gt; Actually, I&#39;m not really happy about it - but I have a feeling it&#39;s a<br/>

web board in existance. Like them, we could threaten to stop playing the<br/>
mana song until this is fixed. :)<br/>

It&#39;s a shame we don&#39;t have more people testing changes on the test<br/>
server so we could catch this stuff before it made it on the production<br/>
servers, as obviously Verant isn&#39;t going to spend the money to have a<br/>
real QA team evaluate changes.<br/>
