<b>Subject:</b> Offtopic: Asheron&#39;s Call vs. Everquest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497278720">So many people complaining about downtime and exp loss and so on and so <br/>
forth.. have any of you read what Asheron&#39;s Call is doing?  They don&#39;t want <br/>
to penalize people too harshly with exp so they decided that when you die, <br/>
you lose a few of your best items and a percentage of your money.  How&#39;s <br/>
that for not penalizing people to travel?  You all complain now at what <br/>
Everquest does.. be grateful that it&#39;s the best game of it&#39;s genre at the <br/>
moment.  Nothing even comes close to it and I doubt anything will for a <br/>
while.  Yes, it has its quirks.  And yes, it&#39;s taking a long time to fix <br/>
them all.  But would you have preferred waiting another year while beta <br/>
testers worked out all the bugs or enjoy playing the game now and live with <br/>
the bugs as they get fixed.  The more people are playing the more bugs are <br/>
found quicker and resolved quicker.  Now, there&#39;s just a matter of priority <br/>
as to what to fix first.  And quit trying to make every frigging class the <br/>
exact same as the other class.  You want to be able to bind?  Play a damn <br/>
spell caster.  You want to be able to run fast?  Play a damn bard or shaman <br/>
or something.  You want to dish out lots of DD?  Play a wizard.  Just quit <br/>
your whining and be grateful that you can&#39;t do exactly the same thing as <br/>
every other character in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just so tired of hearing people wanting their characters to be god so <br/>
they can kill everything in site.. go play Doom and enter god mode if you <br/>
want to do that and see how much fun it is after a while.<br/>
<br/>
Just my pipe blowing,<br/>
