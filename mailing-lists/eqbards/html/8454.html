&gt;I know one of them is a good several lvls above the other, <br/>
&gt;but I forget which.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For all practical purposes you can assume both are 30th level.<br/>
One is level 30 and one is level 27 or 28 if I recall, they are<br/>
not higher than level 30 for sure.  Choon conn&#39;d even at 30, and<br/>
both are fixed level spawns.  (However, I could be one level off, <br/>
it&#39;s been a while)<br/>
<br/>
A level 32-35 bard can solo either of the two with fear+chains<br/>
very successfully, anything below that and you&#39;ll get too <br/>
many resists.<br/>
