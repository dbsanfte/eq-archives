<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033725615">I agree but that it doesn&#39;t ruin charm kiting, just makes it more<br/>
difficult. I hate reaching over to the F8 key in between selo, restoration<br/>
and re-targeting pet. Just one more finger stretching operation. <br/>
<br/>
I would be tempted to mez more but I fail too often at 105 CHA and don&#39;t<br/>
want to lose the AC to get it to &gt; 125. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried singing the CHA song before mez? I wondering if that<br/>
would help get mez to stick without switching gear in between chanters.<br/>

BTW, I tested charm kiting some frost giants (in velious) and didn&#39;t<br/>
really have much of a problem at all. After charming a frost giant<br/>
captain, I had him attack a frost giant savage. I restarted selos&#39;,<br/>
retargetted my pet and waited for charm to break. Then I re-charmed my<br/>
pet, pressed my &quot;target nearest npc&quot; key, and hit my &quot;/pet<br/>
attack&quot; social while backing away to stay out of melee range.<br/>
<br/>
Worked like a charm.<br/>
