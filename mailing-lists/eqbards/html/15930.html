significantly larger AC boost and your group&#39;s damage is<br/>
mostly non-melee).  But most bards are going on dragon raids<br/>
starting in their early 40s - bards and clerics seem to be the<br/>
two classes who are readily accepted at these despite their<br/>
low level.  They have a good chance of getting the Horn long<br/>
before they reach level 50.<br/>
