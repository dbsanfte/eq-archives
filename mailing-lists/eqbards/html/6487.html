<div id="ygrps-yiv-928195409">I have just posted the following Usenet message on the alt.games.everquest<br/>
board that Brad says he browses, please agree or disagree, back me up, and<br/>
hopefully I was not out of line in speaking for all of us:<br/>
<br/>
Myself and others who have regular discussions on the ONELIST bard&#39;s forum<br/>
are concerned about the recent changes to SoW that is affecting our Selo&#39;s<br/>
Accelerando.  It seems that once SoW is cast on us we are stuck with it and<br/>
it overrides our Selo&#39;s, you can see how this can be a bad thing.  Please<br/>
try to work something out with this, my suggestion is that you allow the<br/>
ability for a player to cancel SoW if they choose just like you have done<br/>
with the Levitate spell.<br/>
<br/>
We are also perplexed at the minotaur horn graphic turning into a burlap<br/>
sack on our character&#39;s Avatar, is this intentional?  We have come to accept<br/>
that our drum looks like a flute and we blow on our brass horns backwards<br/>
and hope that this will one day be addressed, but maybe insted of a burlap<br/>
sack, you could change the graphic for the mino horn to look like the<br/>
graphic for the brass horn.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the bards in EQ comprise a very small percentage of the<br/>
overall population but it is that fact along with the fact that we are not<br/>
inclined toward overt rants and flames against Verant or any particular<br/>
person at Verant that causes us to often feel as though we are being<br/>
overlooked.  I believe I understant that the Bard class was the last class<br/>
to be developed before final release and as a result there were a lot of<br/>
issues (such as the ones regarding how our instruments look and behave on<br/>
our Avatars) that were left unfinished.  Granted, issues like this do not<br/>
affect gameplay, they do make us feel like the stepchild class.<br/>
<br/>
I implore you to try to dedicate some of what I realize is already burdened<br/>
development resources to addressing a number of these issues and providing<br/>
us with at least a small amount of information on if and when you intend to<br/>
address the ones leftover from beta (like my flute drum and hari-kari brass<br/>
horn).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
