&gt; I think Mr. Kim may be confused at what I was stating.  The speed of each<br/>

&gt; Sure, the chances each individual swing is the same, no matter what speed<br/>
&gt; weapon you use, but a faster weapon simply nets you many more swings, and as<br/>
&gt; such, yields many more chances to activate.  Simply put, probability is in<br/>
&gt; favor of more successful attack resolutions with more speed.  Combat has a<br/>
&gt; large random component, it makes sense to weight it as much as you can in<br/>
&gt; your favor.<br/>

distribution of the damage).  Say you have two weapons, one is<br/>
10 damage 20 delay, the other is 5 damage 10 delay (i.e. same<br/>
damage ratio).  Say you are fighting for 60 seconds, and the<br/>
chance of your dual wield going of is 20%.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the slow weapon in your off hand, it will make a<br/>
dual wield check every 2 seconds, for a total of 30 checks.<br/>
20% of those will succeed, resulting in 6 attacks.  At 10<br/>
damage, that works out to 60 damage.<br/>

Yes, you get more successful dual wield activations with the<br/>
faster weapon in your off hand, but faster weapons tend to do<br/>
less damage.  Ignoring for the moment that max damage is<br/>
(2*dam+1), if two weapons have identical damage/delay ratios,<br/>
it does not matter which one you put in your off hand, faster <br/>
or slower.<br/>
