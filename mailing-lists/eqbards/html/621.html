L8 (when we get the stringed instrument skill) was when I was<br/>
making clerics and druids feel useless as healers.  Minor<br/>
healing heals about 10 hp, light healing (cleric L5, druid L9)<br/>
heals about 35 hp.  A L8 bard with a lute can simultaneously<br/>
heal everyone in the group 5 hp every tick.  Enjoy it while it<br/>
lasts.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would even say that around L6-8, your healing song is so<br/>
effective relative to the number of hp people have that a good<br/>
group can do just fine with only the bard as healer.  A good<br/>
group will bounce the monster(s) between each other so<br/>
everyone takes damage, not just one person or just the tanks.<br/>
That makes the bard even more effective vs. heal spells.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d agree with this too.  It&#39;s hard to find a group at that<br/>
level and with the songs you have (most L5 groups don&#39;t travel<br/>
much so Accelerando isn&#39;t very useful), and without healing<br/>
you&#39;re looking at a lot of downtime after each fight.  Get to<br/>
L6 and life will get much easier.  Although you may find as I<br/>
did that monsters really don&#39;t like it when you heal everyone<br/>
:-) - I died many many times from L6 - L13 because none of my<br/>
party members could draw the monsters off me, unless I<br/>
completely refrained from attacking.  Either it got better<br/>
around L14, or Verant tweaked it so bards aren&#39;t public enemy<br/>
#1 to monsters anymore.  (I was even drawing off monsters<br/>
other people were fighting, simply by walking by.)<br/>
