<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000779037">I stack all the time, and yes, both effects are in place.  If I&#39;m tired, I<br/>
won&#39;t stack, or if I&#39;m preoccupied with many MoB&#39;s, even tho that&#39;s probably<br/>
the most desperate time to have it.  When things aren&#39;t so hectic, it gives<br/>
me a little more to do other than<br/>

1. Hit &quot;A&quot; 2. move next to MoB 2. Wait.  3. Loot.<br/>

&gt; OK, someone clear thnigs up for me. There is endless discussion about<br/>
&gt;&quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing two songs<br/>
&gt;at once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some sort of<br/>
&gt;special trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves starting<br/>
&gt;one song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song and<br/>
&gt;quickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and then<br/>
&gt;stopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing the<br/>
&gt;effect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of button<br/>
&gt;pressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have failed<br/>
&gt;entirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have the<br/>
&gt;icon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I hardly ever<br/>
&gt;actually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually higher<br/>
&gt;when I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any effect of<br/>
&gt;either song!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over zealous but<br/>
&gt;very talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a lot of you<br/>
&gt;take seriously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I for one am going to save my fingers the busywork . . .<br/>
