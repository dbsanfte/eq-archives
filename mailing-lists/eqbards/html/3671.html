<div id="ygrps-yiv-16570496">I maxed out my Bind Wounds the other day (it maxs at 100).  On myself it <br/>
heals 25 per bandage.  I use BW all the time to help people in need, most <br/>
people are very thankful. When ever I am at a zone line I check all the <br/>
people there to see if they need a band-aid or not :)<br/>

&gt;I just hesitate to actually hit the monster with anything,<br/>
&gt;just because it is part of the etiquette I follow.  Now,<br/>
&gt;lullaby is a bit of a different manner.  I played punching<br/>
&gt;bag for someone one, by doing this to the two orcs<br/>
&gt;that jumped him, and I believe it was OBVIOUS that I<br/>
&gt;was not attacking, as I just stood and played, without<br/>
&gt;swinging back :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The one thing I would love to see (but probably won&#39;t,<br/>
&gt;for balance reasons) is for a small set of our beneficial<br/>
&gt;songs (Chant, Hymm, the Psalms) to work on a<br/>
&gt;targeted, non-grouped PC.  I consistently invite people<br/>
&gt;sitting and healing to share my song, while I&#39;m healing,<br/>
&gt;but you can only do that when you&#39;re solo.  I saved<br/>
&gt;someone from poison the other day, but I had to group<br/>
&gt;with him first, and if I&#39;d been grouped he would have<br/>
&gt;died (I&#39;ve intended to get my bind wounds skill up for a<br/>
&gt;while now, I just haven&#39;t had time).<br/>
