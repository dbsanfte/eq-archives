Congrats on 54.  And an excellent weekend!  For what it worth, my woodie<br/>
also worships Tunare.<br/>
<br/>
/e positive At least Verant is trying to positively impact the game<br/>
/e negative You would think Verant would learn how to test comprehensively<br/>
and in multiple situations.  Do we see the emergency patch today or<br/>
tomorrow?  I vote tomorrow.<br/>

<br/>
 I heard more than once and from several people in different zones that DD&#39;s<br/>
were breaking snares/roots last night. Mage mentioned it seemingly happening<br/>
at least once to us last night.<br/>
<br/>
Other topies: My WE bard worships Tunare. <br/>
<br/>
Adventures over the weekend: Finally dinged 54 in Howling Stones Monday<br/>
evening! I got a Sash of the Dragonborn there in South tower on Sunday. AC 2<br/>
plus haste. When the cleric let me melee a bit, I never stopped swinging! We<br/>
left HS to help take out the dragon in Emerald Jungle. I say helped, seemed<br/>
to stay feared or stunned the whole time. I lost the RBB lotto by one!<br/>
Monday we went back to HS but the paladin had to leave early on, so I tanked<br/>
along with a mage&#39;s air pet. The group seemed to think I was a better tank<br/>
than the poor pally! Friday was deep VK (I can&#39;t spell that name!). Died 4<br/>
times but had fun. I&#39;m bound in GFay so I can buy stones for the cleric when<br/>
I die these days and found someone selling Ry&#39;Gor chain pants during one<br/>
death. Everyone boggled at the rezzed bard wearing just chain pants! They<br/>
were about an even swap for my silvery legs, couple points AC vs couple<br/>
points Attack. I was instrument barding at the time and figure AC is more<br/>
useful. They do look odd when DE&#39;ed. They have a purple sash look around the<br/>
waist. I even got a nice trade item while in VK, Spider Fur Cloak. <br/>
A very productive gaming weekend, I need to get too sick to paint and fix up<br/>
around the house more often!<br/>
