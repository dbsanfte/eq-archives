<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963338611">This is how it worked for me. I was heading to Qeynos<br/>
to train dual wield. But I figured I&#39;d try and see if I<br/>
could at least equip two weapons now that I was 17 --<br/>
and I could! Then I got attacked by a bear on my way<br/>
through North Karana... and I got a Dual wield increase!<br/>
YAY! I still had to go back to Qeynos, though -- songs and<br/>
more throwing daggers.<br/>

&gt;&quot;I manage to hit level 17 and screamed back to FV to train dual wield.<br/>
&gt;After a bit of looking around I asked if there was a bard trainer.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unless it&#39;s changed, we bards do not have to train Dual Wield.<br/>
&gt;Once you hit<br/>
&gt;17, just zone or relog, and you&#39;ll be able to wield both weapons.  Your<br/>
&gt;initial skill will be 34.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, it&#39;s been a long time, so this may have changed. </span></blockquote></div>
