&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sounds about right - Athlons and Via are not good bedfellows.  I&#39;ve got a<br/>
&gt; GeForce DDR on a P3V4X mobo (Via Apollo Pro) with a P3-800 and it runs<br/>
&gt; without problems.  There&#39;s not much to choose from a GeForce DDR and a<br/>
&gt; GeForce2 GTS at lower resolutions (anthing less than 1024x768).  I also<br/>
&gt; tried a GTS on the same motherboard for a week and it ran without<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Via chipset isn&#39;t a stable power base which also causes some problems for<br/>
the GeForce card.  The biggest problem with ANY Voodoo card, however is<br/>
heat.  The GeForce cards are nowhere near as hot as their Voodoo<br/>
counterparts.  Not sure why, maybe their technology is just that much better<br/>
(Nvidia).  Pluss I would NEVER use a Via chipset until they can outperform<br/>
the BX-440 chipset by intel which is now over 3 years old and still beats<br/>
the Via chipset hands down in any configuration.  And if you overclock the<br/>
BX-440 to 133mhz it&#39;s still more stable and reliable (though it wreaks havok<br/>
with older video cards).<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t your GeForce card.  It&#39;s your BIOS Rev and some inherent<br/>
power problems with the Via Chipset.  As was mentioned you might want to try<br/>
flashing your bios to the latest Rev.  That should help a lot.</div>
