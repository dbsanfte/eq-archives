<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086427485">Icewell and Velk were the two that I&#39;ve found to drop gems most frequently.<br/>
In CS there is no faction hit when killing drakes and wyverns unless it&#39;s a<br/>
named one (Ycolcarn and the named drake I forget). Fairly easy to charm kite<br/>
things on the beach below, and now there is less of a danger of getting<br/>
cremated by ae drake spells since the patch. Before then I was afraid to<br/>
even sit around for any length of time. If someone would train 2 drakes by<br/>
you, and I mean even *close* to you, you&#39;d be hit by their ae prolly 2x<br/>
each, and at avg of 400+ per shot, that&#39;s 1600 of your hps gone right there.<br/>
Unbuffed at 55 I have a good bit less than that!   /mourn Pava<br/>
