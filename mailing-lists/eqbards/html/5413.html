<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919121462">Failure is always a possibility, no way to avoid that.  I would pay the <br/>
     money for the bar first to minimize your losses.  If it succeeds then pay <br/>
     the fee for the work.  Since Jewelers are by nature merchants that live and <br/>
     die by their reputation I don&#39;t think the &#39;sucker&#39; scenario is very likely. <br/>
      Do a /who and make sure they&#39;re a 24th level enchanter for gold jewelry. <br/>
     (it&#39;s something in the thirties for platinum)  Lying about the failure I <br/>
     don&#39;t have a suggestion for other then word of mouth recommendation for an <br/>
     honest jeweler.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      If you ever get a black pearl or a diamond as loot DON&#39;T <br/>
&gt; sell them!<br/>
&gt;       <br/>
&gt;      Save them till you find a good jeweler and commission <br/>
&gt; him/her to make  <br/>
&gt;      jewelry for you.  Those two gems are tops as far as I <br/>
&gt; can tell and are  <br/>
&gt;      only available as loot.  Most gems can be bought from <br/>
&gt; vendors but not  <br/>
&gt;      the very best ones.  Black pearls add to both str and <br/>
&gt; dex and diamonds  <br/>
&gt;      add to 4 different things!   <br/>
     <br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, assuming I ever find myself fingering a black pearl in my pocket & <br/>
negotiating a price with some jeweler, any recommendations for how to cover <br/>
myself in case a) the jeweler fails, or b) the jeweler claims they failed, <br/>
or c) the jeweler laughs, says &quot;Sucker!&quot; and starts to run away?  This is <br/>
assuming I&#39;m not on a PvP server and can&#39;t kill him or her.<br/>
