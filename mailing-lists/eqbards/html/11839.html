<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-15066928">I have found that my songs seem to &quot;get better with age&quot; - a few levels<br/>
after getting them, they seem to do lots better.  Maybe it&#39;s the skill that<br/>
needs to improve (when you first get a brass song) or they actually have<br/>
some code that bases resists on how old the song is?  Also the level of the<br/>
song compared to the mob?   <br/>
<br/>
But yes - I use the earliest songs when I want the least resists. And<br/>
perhaps the mobs are more resistant to the type of magic of the newer song<br/>
than the older one?<br/>
<br/>
And I have been a bad bard &lt;tsk tsk&gt; lev 37 and 38 songs are waiting for me<br/>
in the bard guild still.  Not like the old days where you really looked<br/>
forward to making a level and getting a good song.  &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>

		I was wondering if anyone is having the same problem I am<br/>
with the level 38<br/>
		song.<br/>
		EVERYTHING resists me!  I find it very funny that EVERYTHING<br/>
RESISTS a level<br/>
		38 song (Chant) but almost nothing resists a level 12 song<br/>
(Bellow).  Can<br/>
		anyone confirm for me that this song actually works????  It<br/>
isn&#39;t doing a<br/>
		thing for me!<br/>
<br/>
		Thanx,<br/>
