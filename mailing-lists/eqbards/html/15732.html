<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600672598">I upgraded my system to Win 2K over the weekend.  I did a clean install of<br/>
Win2K onto a brand new harddrive (it is wierd having the OS on the H drive<br/>
hah).  I installed EQ and patched up (I have a cable modem so this went very<br/>
fast).  Then I copied over the contents of my old EQ folder to the new one,<br/>
just telling it no when it asked to overwrite existing files. It worked<br/>
fine.   Also with Win 2k and a clean install I can weave 4 songs, if my<br/>
timing is absolutely perfect :)  Was weaving Chords of Dissounce, Denon&#39;s<br/>
Discord, Niv&#39;s & Hymn last night vs LDCs & Lava Beetles.<br/>

Hmm...tough call.  You will need to do the install again to get everything<br/>
in your registry (copying the whole directory might not work because of<br/>
this), so I&#39;d say just go with patching it again.  Its the safest option ya<br/>
have.  If ya have a bad connection to the internet, I&#39;d say just let it run<br/>
over the night...there aren&#39;t too many things that need to be patched, I&#39;d<br/>
say no more than 100mb worth of stuff.  On a 56k connection, this would take<br/>
about a nights worth of downloading.<br/>
Heh, good luck man, hope it works out<br/>

  TOtally non bardish, but you people seem to know everything.  I got a<br/>
  new computer (woohoo!)  What is the best way to move EQ over to it?  I<br/>
  assume I will have to reinstall and wait about 10 hours getting<br/>
  patched...  Are there any files I should copy over?<br/>
