<div id="ygrps-yiv-471785495">i know, i said that you can proc even if you miss and do no damage.  but i<br/>
think that is because it is coded as a HIT but for 0 damage.  with a rune<br/>
effect up, there are no hits, so the Venril proc did not work on us.  he<br/>
only hit for 8 or so dmg then, so the rune never wore off.  now he hits for<br/>
300 i think.  i&#39;m not sure if a 200 poison resist will do much against him,<br/>
and not sure if anyone wants to try now =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Err i get proc&#39;s all the time on npcs without even hitting <br/>
&gt; them. I have my<br/>
&gt; own misses off so i dont know if it was because they had a <br/>
&gt; damage shield or<br/>
&gt; i just missed, but i didnt get any melee damage reported but <br/>
&gt; i did get the<br/>
&gt; non melee from the dagger proc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dunno if this applies to npc&#39;s on pcs, but i do know pc&#39;s can <br/>
&gt; proc on a<br/>
&gt; damage shield/miss. You also get burned/pierced too. </span></blockquote></div>
