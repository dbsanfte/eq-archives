<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042100050">ALL the attributes are worthwhile, to a varying degree, depending on your<br/>
class<br/>
<br/>
STR is used for To Hit AND Damage Calculations, as well as load bearing and<br/>
some trade skills.  Three major areas it impacts makes it a heavily weighted<br/>
stat, pardon the pun<br/>
<br/>
STA is used for bonus hitpoints (takes a lot of extra STA to boost HP any<br/>
meaningful amount), and higher STA will also let you swing more before<br/>
becoming fatigued.<br/>
<br/>
AGI is used for Hit Avoidance AND Damage Reduction, and is factored into<br/>
your Dodge and Safe Fall skills as well.<br/>
<br/>
DEX is used for To Hit bonus, ranged and melee, determines how well you can<br/>
avoid spell interupts in combat, is added as a bonus to your Parry and<br/>
Riposte skills, and helps determine how often &#39;procing&#39; (magic effect<br/>
processing) weapons go off.  This makes it the second most weighted stat.<br/>
<br/>
WIS is used for magic resist, as well as mana amount for healing classes,<br/>
and fizzle rates.<br/>
<br/>
INT is used for skill increase rolls, mana for magi classes, and fizzle<br/>
rates.<br/>
<br/>
CHA is used for faction adjustments(which includes merchant prices), and has<br/>
a minor impact on Bard resist rates and missed notes.<br/>

&gt;I wanted to bring up Hide and Forage though.  I started with both of these<br/>
&gt;as a Wood Elf, seems nice maybe.  First, I never bother with hide anymore.<br/>
&gt;I used to when I could Con an enemy to tell if I was hidden or not.  Now,<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s just no way to be able to know if I&#39;m hiding.  I fail hiding a good<br/>
&gt;2/3 of the time it seems, so any situation where I&#39;d need to hide is not<br/>
one<br/>
&gt;where I&#39;d risk attempting it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re better off than a human or half elf bard in both Hide and Forage.<br/>
You start capped at 50 with your inate skills.<br/>
<br/>
The most a non wood elf bard can get in Forage is 40, and only 35 in Hide. </span></blockquote></div>
