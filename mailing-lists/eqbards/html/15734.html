There are many times when you are going to have to fight multiple mobs.  And<br/>
not because a &quot;pull&quot; is screwed up but because it is the way things are<br/>
going to pull.  In this case, crowd control falls to the class that is best<br/>
able to deal with it: enchanter(s).  When my guild goes on a raid to a<br/>
serious place (fire giants, ice giants, dragons, planes) we have 2<br/>
enchanters.  I can&#39;t tell you exactly which mez spell they use on which mob,<br/>
many times they charm (can&#39;t mez giants?) but whatever they do, one of their<br/>
best specialties is crowd control.  In some situations, other guilds use<br/>
other tactics (2 clerics per tank group & level 50 tanks) and just beat down<br/>
what they can and res back until they have cleared what they want.  We like<br/>
our enchanters to do crowd control (we like Clarity & Swift Like The Wind<br/>
too ;p)<br/>
<br/>
For some fun we decided to jump into the pit under Vox&#39;s Lair and clear out<br/>
the giant polar bears, wooly spider, & dire wolves.  If you fall down the<br/>
first pitfall, you land in a room with 5 or 6 giant polar bears (blue to me<br/>
at 48).  They are positioned such that if you pull one you will get several.<br/>
We had 3 groups, 2 enchanters and no problems dealing with them.  Too bad<br/>
Verant forgot to itemize them with any loot.  It was fun jumping into some<br/>
place that you usually try so hard to avoid and then cleaning house.<br/>
<br/>
But in other situations, you are going to face multi-mob pulls.  Plane of<br/>
Hate getting a couple Clerics, Scron Banshee and Forsaken Rev in one pull is<br/>
fairly normal and with enchanters&#39; crowd control, your teams can deal with<br/>
it.  We go for everyone kill the same mob and fite them one at a time.  We<br/>
have designated taunters in the event a pet or something breaks and gets on<br/>
a cleric or enchanter but the main group assists the primary and secondary<br/>
target pickers.  (Make hotkeys that say &quot;/assist name1&quot;  and &quot;/assist name2&quot;<br/>
rather than just &quot;/assist&quot;).  Even so, we see that the assist command is<br/>
buggy and sometimes you cant get a target or get a bad target but the intent<br/>
is to focus on one mob at a time.  It something that we have worked out<br/>
given how we load groups (one cleric per tank group).<br/>
<br/>
But the biggest value of having a SOP (Standard Operating Plan) is<br/>
maintaining a coordinated effort.  If everyone has a job and sticks to it,<br/>
you eliminate the confusion that can rapidly escalate into disaster when<br/>
somebody gets creative and &#39;trys something&#39;.<br/>

&gt; Admitted, but the point was an Enchanter who is mezzing is doing so<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; the party screwed up in the first place IMHO...<br/>

&gt; &gt; ACK! Even without Mez, Enchanters still have SO many better ways<br/>
&gt; &gt; using their mana than nuking. Stunning! Tashan (Debuffing magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; resistance)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other debuffs. -- Enemy slowdown! Attacker speeduP!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nuking should only be done VERY occasionally by enchanters. OUr<br/>
&gt; &gt; mana to damage ratio is terrible.<br/>
