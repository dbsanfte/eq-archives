&gt; Sorry, I agree with Sartori here.  Yah it was AWESOME to have such a<br/>
&gt; powerful charm.  But it was hardly realistic.  And to be honest I seriously<br/>
&gt; doubt the gods and planes will remain weaker than kunark long.  Be watching<br/>
&gt; for some serious upgrades to the alternate planes once Kunark hits.<br/>

god/dragon levels, then it made no sense to nerf the new bard<br/>
song.  OTOH, if they keep them the same level and reserve the<br/>
L55-60 spectrum for god/dragon-level mobs, then it makes sense<br/>
(and likewise enchanters will never get a charm that&#39;ll work<br/>
on L55).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>
