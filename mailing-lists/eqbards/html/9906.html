<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574458082">Hehe I been with rangers who wish they could track only as good as us!  They<br/>
dont like seeing crap that is clear across the zone andprefer to see stuff<br/>
that is fairly close by.  Guess Verant had a real &quot;wizard&quot; design ranger<br/>
tracking.<br/>

  I don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger, or forage - but I<br/>
WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My track capped out at 100 i believe. and i find it very very useful. <br/>
especially in Solb when there are 40 - 50 people there. I can find that dog <br/>
that just spawned before other people.  :)<br/>
