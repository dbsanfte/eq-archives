<div id="ygrps-yiv-473901644">Heh clerics are not easy they are one of the harder clases to learn out of<br/>
all the classes. However point being if your powerleveling a bard then you<br/>
probably have a level 50 and I guaruntee you I had no problem playing a bard<br/>
after going to level 50. You learn a lot grouping with people over and over<br/>
and over.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Powerleveling anyone can be easily done with a higher (lvl 24 spells I<br/>
&gt;&gt; think) druid. They just buff you up some, especially getting their<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage shield, then heal you while you fight reds.  My friend shot up<br/>
&gt;&gt; his guildmate from 8-12 in a few hours...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  My point is with a bard you dont just click one button to do something.<br/>
&gt;  Powerleveling a bard is useless, if they dont know what they are doing.<br/>
&gt;  Most bards I see don&#39;t know what they are doing anyway.  (ie: bellow)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  With clerics, it&#39;s easy - they heal.  With wizards, it&#39;s easy - the<br/>
&gt;  blast.  Powerleveling a class who has to adapt and think is much more<br/>
&gt;  difficult, which was the thing I was getting at.<br/>
