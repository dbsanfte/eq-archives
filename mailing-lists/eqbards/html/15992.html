<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Trying out Asheron&#39;s Call (Way off topic but I had to post this) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161840792">I&#39;m considering trying out AC.  I&#39;m just getting very frustrated with EQ.  I<br/>
enjoy it, but my interest has been waning of late.  I&#39;ve played 8 different<br/>
classes, 4 to over 20th (my monk will hit 30 soon), been to every zone,<br/>
except the Planes of course) at least a few times, and am just finding it to<br/>
be very limited.  I do prefer soloing, and we all know how hard that can be,<br/>
at times.  I don&#39;t mind grouping, but I really don&#39;t like being forced to do<br/>
it.. I think that&#39;s the one thing that will get me to try AC out.  If I can<br/>
solo throughout my entire career (not that I will, but who knows..) that<br/>
will be a HUGE benefit to me.<br/>
<br/>
Do they give you a free month as well?  I may just decide to pick it up.. I<br/>
just got my tax refund back last week. :)<br/>

&gt; Heya everybody!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not quitting EQ (yet) but Asheron&#39;s call is my number 1 game if my RL<br/>
&gt; friends aren&#39;t logged into EQ.  Thought I&#39;d share this with ya&#39;ll.  I know<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s WAY Off Topic but I thought I would share.  I know some of my fellow<br/>
&gt; bards are just as frustrated as I was with EQ so I thought I&#39;d post this<br/>
&gt; very viable alternative.<br/>
