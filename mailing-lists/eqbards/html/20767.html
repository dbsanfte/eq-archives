<div id="ygrps-yiv-366439558"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Any suggestions other then Cazic Thule sewers for where i can hunt at 37<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>

Best xp zone multiplier in the game, lancers stay blue till 40th level. My<br/>
ranger character went from 35 through 42 within a few weeks of light game<br/>
play there. My bard is just waiting for the chance to use it to level up but<br/>
that&#39;s a ways off. Single pull the lancers and kill them in the entryway,<br/>
fish don&#39;t run so no snare/chains are needed. Don&#39;t charm in that entryway,<br/>
the fish warps to the 2nd level as it enters guard mode and generally comes<br/>
back with 3-4 friends, believe it, I&#39;ve seen it. If your group is 37 average<br/>
you should be able to take the piercer and impalier with some effort but I<br/>
know a 30ish group of 4 friends that just took out an impaler so a group<br/>
around 37 should do fine. If you are lucky the Fierce Impaler will spawn,<br/>
it&#39;s your only chance at loot on the upper level, common drop Gloomwater<br/>
Harpoon (DMG: 9 Atk Delay: 31 +4 STR, +25 HP bards can use), rare is Darksea<br/>
Harpoon (DMG: 10 Atk Delay: 28 +5 WIS, +5 STR, +20 MANA +5 DR shaman only).<br/>
The Darksea is worth on the order of 8-10kpp, the gloomwater is nice as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you mem Jig of vigor, as well as Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre. The stamina<br/>
effect is very important since you won&#39;t get anything back underwater. Don&#39;t<br/>
depend on Tarew&#39;s for Enduring Breath, it&#39;s range isn&#39;t great, but if things<br/>
get out of synch or breath runs out during battle it starts up quick and<br/>
will save lives.<br/>
