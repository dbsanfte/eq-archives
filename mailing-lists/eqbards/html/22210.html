<div id="ygrps-yiv-403750289">So it&#39;s okay to go AFK for 30 minutes to meditate or chloroplast heal but<br/>
not to Hymn?  So are all caster buffs going to end when the caster logs off<br/>
so they can&#39;t park an enchanter nearby just to clarity and log him on and<br/>
off?  Plain and simple this is stupid.  It&#39;s another example of where<br/>
probably some bard was sitting AFK on the planes and now we all have to be<br/>
nerfed because someone abused the situation.  Heaven forbid they should<br/>
handle this by putting in an auto logoff when someone is inactive for more<br/>
than 10 minutes like most games do.<br/>

Absor has asked everyone to switch to a different thread on this:<br/>

I&#39;d have to agree with Lago on Verant&#39;s reasoning that this is to keep us <br/>
from going AFK indefinitely.<br/>

&gt;It appears that this change is to keep us from indefinitely playing a song<br/>

&gt;All this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>
