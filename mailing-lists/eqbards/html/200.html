&gt;     I JUST made level 8 and have a few questions.  Since I just made 8 and<br/>
&gt; can develop String Instruments - should I sell my drum after getting the<br/>
&gt; lute?  Is there any need for both?  (Obviously a concern is carrying slots). <br/>
&gt; Is there a difference between the lute and the mandolin?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always keep both with me, because the drum is extremely useful with the<br/>
Accelerando, and the stringed instrument, of course, with heal.<br/>
<br/>
The only difference that I know of between the lute and the mandolin is that<br/>
the mandolin is a little bit lighter, and of course has a completely different<br/>
musical tone. <br/>

&gt;     Lastly - I am always short of money.  Most of my money goes to songs - my<br/>
&gt; armor is pretty thin.  Any suggestions for making money.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At your rank, one of the best things to do is to hunt orcs or goblins--they<br/>
frequently have weapons and/or armor that can be sold for a gold or more. Best<br/>
place to hunt goblins is probably in Misty Thicket near Rivervale, if you can<br/>
go there when it is not overcrowded. I&#39;ve had lots of success there with money<br/>
making.<br/>
