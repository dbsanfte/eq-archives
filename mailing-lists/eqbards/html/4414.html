&gt;I am looking for some bard websites with information on each of our songs<br/>
&gt;and other basic bard information that would probably not go around often on<br/>
&gt;this list.  I am also new to this list so please forgive me if I break any<br/>
&gt;protocall here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why of course there are!  Naturally, I want you to start with my own site,<br/>
the EverQuesting Bard (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)</a><br/>
however, you will find links on there to several great resources, including<br/>
the Soerbaird, the Concert Hall and the EQ Bardic Guide.  I encourage you<br/>
to visit all the sites, as we each handle things a bit differently.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy and welcome to the Bard&#39;s Guild!<br/>
