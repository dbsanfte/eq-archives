<b>Subject:</b> Re: Use for Lullaby at L17... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080276130">Yes, I know John, we play on the same server and met back in the low 20s<br/>
in Unrest. He is one of the best bards on the server hands down in my<br/>
opinion. I always love his tests because they are thorough and<br/>
informative. :)<br/>
<br/>
Could Verant have secretly sneaked in a fix to Lullaby on us? I have<br/>
read Lullaby, like Charm, is CHA intensive for resist checks. Last night<br/>
we did it again, fighting L19-20 aviak guards at the &quot;Fire Tower&quot; in<br/>
Lake Rathetear. A L17 Cleric, L18 Bard, and L20 Shaman. All three guards<br/>
were spawned and we had to split them, 2 L19&#39;s and a L20. The L20<br/>
appeared to resist it heavily, the 2 L19s snored through the entire<br/>
fight.<br/>
<br/>
What else might make the difference? Songs check Dex too, based on a<br/>
message I read a bit ago (I cannot confirm the source or orginal poster<br/>
unfortunately). I&#39;m not sure why we have been so lucky with Lullaby. As<br/>
I said previously, I&#39;ve also used it with &#39;stunning&#39; success on my own<br/>
bard, those NPC clerics I could never hope to kill now can never get a<br/>
heal or wrath off, and after they hit 50% it&#39;s all over since they are<br/>
chained and feared. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else been able to get Lullaby to work effectively enough to keep<br/>
it memm&#39;d? Are people twisting it, manually pulsing it, or letting it<br/>
play on it on? When I use it to interrupt casters, it has been manually<br/>
pulsing it, twisting will not keep the targets asleep without an<br/>
instrument from what I&#39;ve seen. <br/>
