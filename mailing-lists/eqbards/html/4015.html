<div id="ygrps-yiv-34013123">I think it is likely that the frequency an item procs is affects by your<br/>
Dexterity, and in some cases by your level as well.  Would the whip be more<br/>
effective if at, say, level 25 it proc&#39;d 80% of the time compared with the<br/>
20% (or whatever) it does at lower levels?<br/>
I have no idea about this, just wondering...<br/>
<br/>
Ummmm....Yeah, anything that does something 80% of the time instead of 20%<br/>
is going to be a BIT more effective....around 60% more effective....</div>
