This is great to hear.  I&#39;m glad that others are enjoying their bardish<br/>
talents as much as I am.  While I don&#39;t role-play as much as you appear to, I<br/>
do appreciate it when it&#39;s presented to me.  I would donate to you as well!<br/>
<br/>
I think your /sing command idea is wonderful!  Even though I don&#39;t role play<br/>
very much I would be wonderful to be able to sing various things to my group!<br/>
I can envision this being used a lot for roleplaying, or just for general<br/>
enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing with a Dwarven Cleric on Fennin Ro named Dindolar lately.<br/>
While this guy doesn&#39;t exactly roleplay either, he&#39;s terrific to have in my<br/>
group.  He&#39;s very witty and talkative and stimulates others in the group to be<br/>
that way (and he knows how to play a Cleric too!).  He has a bunch of macros<br/>
set up that say things like &quot;Dindolar pops open a fresh can of Sta-Fit instant<br/>
mana.&quot; when he sits down to med.  Another one says &quot;Dindolar crunches down on<br/>
a Troll flavored jawbreaker with a creamy mana center.&quot;  This is the kind of<br/>
thing that I would probably do with a /sing command.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played several classes too and think that bards are the best by quite a<br/>
margin of the ones that I tried.  I took a monk to level 23 as my first<br/>
character knowing that he would be simpler to run than the magic using<br/>
classes.  He was great to get a hang of EQ with but I definitely got bored<br/>
with him.  He was also dirt-poor all the time because he couldn&#39;t loot (14<br/>
pounds weight limit for monks).  I mean, what&#39;s there to NOT like about bard?<br/>
We don&#39;t need mana and yet we can heal, buff, charm, mez, give clarity, do DD<br/>
and DoTs.  We scream across the landscape faster than any other class, we can<br/>
wear most armor, we get a new &quot;spell&quot; every level instead of every four<br/>
levels, our songs automatically effect the entire party WITHOUT mana usage.<br/>
Damn.  I better shut up before Verant nerfs me!<br/>

&gt; I play my bard on Prexus and am called Orchestro (Level 9).  I just wanted<br/>
&gt; to say something about a highly unforeseen effect the Bard class has had for<br/>
&gt; me, and for my play in game.  That effect being: 1) Money, and 2) Role<br/>
&gt; Playing Fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me explain, I have played since the release of the game under various<br/>
&gt; guises, Druid, Ranger, Cleric, Necromancer, Enchanter, Paladin, Ive tried a<br/>
&gt; lot of em.  With all of the classes I have played where I didnt actively try<br/>
&gt; to role play a lot (Its damn difficult to roleplay a druid all the time, I<br/>
&gt; mean, people get sick of you after a while), I always found myself falling<br/>
&gt; into a rut.  After X amount of time, I would start to get bored, and find<br/>
&gt; myself looking for something new.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Admittantly as I gradually migrated to trying more difficult classes my<br/>
&gt; skills became better, when finally I decided to try a Bard.  You know what I<br/>
&gt; have found? First and foremost it is the easiest class to role play.  I can<br/>
&gt; set up shop outside any town, in the tunnel to Ro, approach high level<br/>
&gt; characters with Lute and hand and automatically have two things:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) An opportunity to sing songs/ditties I have written, or read.<br/>
&gt; 2) An avenue to approach high level character without them thinking: What<br/>
&gt; the hell<br/>
&gt;    does he want?<br/>
&gt; 3) A great way to make money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have made about 120P so far from singing alone.  Its amazing when you get<br/>
&gt; a gathering of people who are listening to your music and they start giving<br/>
&gt; you donations.   I have have low and high level people alike give me nice<br/>
&gt; donations (47P from one DE player is the record!), beause people like to be<br/>
&gt; given a chance to role play.  They want an avenue to take a break from the<br/>
&gt; hack and slash game.  The taverns are unused, there is no reason from a<br/>
&gt; player to go there, we are the key to keeping interest I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been told that my songs entertain, that it was a great break, its<br/>
&gt; just a great feeling you get performing.  Although I was a bit dissapointed<br/>
&gt; when I had 2 GM&#39;s there listening and not 1 copper piece they donated :=)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All in all, I am truly surprise by the fun and profit making I can have with<br/>
&gt; my Bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Two changes I would like to see added would be:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) An addition to the Speech box (where you can click, Group, Say, Tell,<br/>
&gt; etc.) to include: Sing.  When clicked anything you typed would appear as:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Orchestro sings, &quot;Hello my love,&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its *REALLY* annoying to have an emote line come back with the help line<br/>
&gt; because I typed in some character that negated it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; :sings, Hello my love, two things I have:<br/>
&gt; might bomb it..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) A /play command.  I love being able to strum my lute, but I hate that I<br/>
&gt; have to play the healing song to do it.  I dont like people seeing &quot;You<br/>
&gt; wounds begin to heal&quot; when I am just trying to play my instrument.  It would<br/>
&gt; be nice to be able to do /play to instigate the playing animation, it would<br/>
&gt; also be REALLY nice to have the /play command actually start a song playing<br/>
&gt; on their speaker<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, just a few thoughts, I really like this class so far, I fondly<br/>
&gt; remember each and every performance that made my barbed whip purchase<br/>
&gt; possible, and it will always be special to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If your a bard on Prexus, and generally play later in the night, ala<br/>
&gt; 10:30-2AM CST, please drop me a note and maybe we can get together and put<br/>
&gt; on a mini concert somewhere.  I am currently in Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -Orchestro<br/>
&gt;  Prexus<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. If any bards here on Prexus have an old mistmoor drum for sale due to<br/>
&gt; an upgrade to selo&#39;s drum, please let me know.<br/>
