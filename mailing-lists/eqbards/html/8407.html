<b>Subject:</b> Athren&#39;s Guide on how to solo as a Bard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914631319">It&#39;s tough.  It doesn&#39;t always work.  It&#39;s often more trouble than it&#39;s<br/>
worth.  But it is possible.  As I write this, I am at level 25, and I<br/>
have soloed through portions of every level preceeding.<br/>
<br/>
The first trick is knowing what you can handle.  I hear rumors about<br/>
people soloing yellows, and I ignore them.  Kiting yellows, yes, but not<br/>
meleeing and singing.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, and most importantly, use weapons and instruments.  Here is an<br/>
example to illustrate:<br/>
<br/>
Four songs mem&#39;d to be woven, Chain, Warsong, Chords and Dischord.  Songs<br/>
are placed on hotkey panel 1 in above order (1, 2, 3, 4).  Choose target.<br/>
Draw target to sufficiently open area if necessary (Chain is useful for<br/>
drawing).  Begin melee.  Push 2 to begin singing Warsong (the speedup is<br/>
definitely noticeable, especially when it isn&#39;t there).  Warsong<br/>
activates.<br/>
<br/>
[For purposes of this example, I am using Athren, who is currently dual<br/>
wielding a Polished Granite Tomahawk (PGT) in primary and a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
in secondary.]<br/>
<br/>
Push 3 to begin singing Chords.  Shift+2 to second hotkey panel,<br/>
containing 3 general inventory slots, the 2 melee slots and the ranged<br/>
weapon slot (for placing Dirk outside of combat).  Click PGT to cursor.<br/>
Click lute to swap PGT to inventory.  Click Dirk to swap lute into<br/>
secondary hand.  Wait a second till Chords activates, then reverse the<br/>
process of clicking to place weapons back in hands, and shift+1 back to<br/>
song hotkey panel.<br/>
<br/>
Push 4 to begin singing Dischord.  Shift+2 to second hotkey panel, and go<br/>
through above procedure with horn.  Activate, swap back to weapons, then<br/>
weave back to Binding and Warsong.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the easiest thing to do.  I fight from a direct overhead view<br/>
whenever possible to minimize graphic-induced lag.  I&#39;ve also dropped<br/>
everything I own on the ground more times than I can count.  It&#39;s risky in<br/>
that sense, but once into the habit of click-click-clicking from two<br/>
weapons to one instrument, it&#39;s not as hard as it appears.<br/>
<br/>
The best place to practice is along the north zone edge and south beach of<br/>
North Karana.  Beetles are easily coaxed into following you to these<br/>
areas, and they generally remain out of the paths of the three species of<br/>
griffs.<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a list, there was a discussion over whether more damage was<br/>
inflicted using instruments alone or weapons alone.  Why limit yourself to<br/>
one or the other? :)<br/>
