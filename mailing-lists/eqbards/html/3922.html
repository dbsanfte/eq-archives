<div id="ygrps-yiv-230910816">I had a similar thought over the weekend when I was grouped with a paladin<br/>
and a ranger fighting in the throne room at crushbone. I had asked them if<br/>
they wanted me to fight or play, and of course they replied, &quot;can you do a<br/>
little a both?&quot; It would sort of interesting to have a Battle Bard<br/>
specialization.<br/>

&gt; I still find it hard to believe that a bard will ever make a better tank<br/>
&gt; than a warrior, rogue, or ranger. Perhaps with enough plate armor and<br/>
buffs,<br/>
&gt; you might be equal to them but the best one? ehh, maybe (haven&#39;t seen it<br/>
&gt; yet) but I will try to keep an open mind ;]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will emphasize that a bard MUST be in a forceful (and I mean full party<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; strong fighters) to simply play instruments. If the party has only 3<br/>
&gt; members, a lot of casters, it is important to whip out the weapons and<br/>
&gt; fight. However if you have rogues backstabbing and warriors taunting ,<br/>
&gt; rangers, monks . . . . basically a coordinated group somewhat evenly<br/>
taking<br/>
&gt; damage, I stand strong in my position that a lute healing 60 points (10<br/>
&gt; points per group member) of damage per pulse (and remember this will<br/>
&gt; increase in levels) is quite helpful and an efficient battle tactic (I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; TONS of personal examples).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However the topic makes me ask, do you think EQ should allow bards to<br/>
&gt; specialize? For example Mr Tank Bard gets to have a better attack skill<br/>
&gt; where Ms Luteplaying Bard gets a better string skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I for some reason have this strange image of a 250+pd tank who is<br/>
constantly<br/>
&gt; getting knocked in the head, his fingers broken, with a lot of burly<br/>
muscle<br/>
&gt; around his neck decked out in plate being a tad bit weaker in the musical<br/>
&gt; talent. Whereas the little fragile bard who does nothing but play songs<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; try to avoid being hit, could just play masterpieces but fight wimpier?<br/>
To<br/>
&gt; the best of my knowledge it is &quot;fairly easy&quot; to max out your skills in<br/>
&gt; instruments and attack, no matter what your play style. I DON&#39;T want to<br/>
TAKE<br/>
&gt; AWAY the BARD&#39;s SKILLS. I just think that specialization might allow one<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; roleplay and create the type of bard they want to be, therefore making a<br/>
&gt; more rewarding game experience. Possibly the specialization could come out<br/>
&gt; in a year or so with the expansion pack when the bard is already 50th<br/>
level,<br/>
&gt; something to look forward to?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a thought, yea or nay comments welcome 8)<br/>
