<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496227493">We have quite a few people who do this in our guild...we call them<br/>
simul-primes...<br/>
We have two people who play both a warrior and a cleric (one of whom<br/>
recently got a 3rd computer!!!!)<br/>
one who is leave of absense but will have a monk/cleric<br/>
and a host of others who have two computers and simul on and off<br/>
<br/>
Those who are truly &quot;simul&quot; playing can enter lottos with both characters on<br/>
guild hunts (defined as 12 or more from PD) .. However, in the situation you<br/>
described the simuled chanter wouldn&#39;t have entered because he was really<br/>
just following you around for clarity or whatever, not to really play.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On another note, does anyone else have this damn flu going around? *cries*<br/>

&gt; I totally agree with Atonal that the &quot;twinked&quot; enchanter <br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t get the <br/>
&gt; robe, or even get to roll for the robe. Two people playing 4 <br/>
&gt; characters is <br/>
&gt; a little ridiculous to me, especially on any serious raid. <br/>
&gt; For one of those <br/>
&gt; people to be the guild leader makes me shudder.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would have made the same decision had I been in your shoes <br/>
&gt; Brilinnia. I <br/>
&gt; hope your guildleader hopefully has learned a lesson from <br/>
&gt; this incident and <br/>
&gt; that your guild can continue to travel the breadth of Norrath <br/>
&gt; in camaraderie.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Chanter #1 is being played, and died doing his job.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Chanter #2 is there only because someone has multiple computers with<br/>
&gt; &gt;multiple accounts, and is doing nothing, and continued to do <br/>
&gt; nothing despite<br/>
&gt; &gt;the fact that your group was being overrun, and was even <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m a bit surprised that the leader of a guild that attracts <br/>
&gt; people such as<br/>
&gt; &gt;yourself would be the center of such a disagreement.  <br/>
&gt; Granted, I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; &gt;your guild leader, but I do know you, and I supposed I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; always assumed<br/>
&gt; &gt;that your conduct is representative of Excalibur.  :)  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; sure this has<br/>
&gt; &gt;caused strife internally, as threats to walk should not be <br/>
&gt; taken lightly.  A<br/>
&gt; &gt;momentary lapse of reason, perhaps?<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hail bards and bardettes,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  We had a loot rights discussion this weekend. We had 2 <br/>
&gt; groups together in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Howling Stones North Tower. One group had a L44 chanter, a <br/>
&gt; 50s shaman, a 50s<br/>
&gt; &gt;warrior, 50s cleric all played by 2 people plus a 50s wiz. <br/>
&gt; The chanter<br/>
&gt; &gt;really didn&#39;t function as a chanter and we&#39;d asked them not <br/>
&gt; to bring her<br/>
&gt; &gt;along as we had a real working chanter in our group. We got <br/>
&gt; to the last<br/>
&gt; &gt;corner before the Crypt keeper&#39;s room and when the monk <br/>
&gt; pulled it, the whole<br/>
&gt; &gt;room came. We killed the Crypt Keeper but had alot of mobs on us. Our<br/>
&gt; &gt;chanter was doing his best to pause/mez what he could. Then <br/>
&gt; the hallway<br/>
&gt; &gt;started to respawn and we had 8 -10 mobs. Our chanter died, <br/>
&gt; I was doing what<br/>
&gt; &gt;I could but out numbered by live awake mobs. We called for <br/>
&gt; gates and the<br/>
&gt; &gt;other groups wiz got them out. We all died. The necro in our <br/>
&gt; group looted<br/>
&gt; &gt;the chanter robe (Siren&#39;s?) off the keeper before he died <br/>
&gt; and I got the key<br/>
&gt; &gt;before I died rather than have it poof. The aftermath was <br/>
&gt; they wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt;lotto the robe between the chanter twink and the chanter who <br/>
&gt; died doing CC.<br/>
&gt; &gt;We felt this would be very wrong yet they didn&#39;t see it. We <br/>
&gt; felt the twink,<br/>
&gt; &gt;while there when the robe dropped, was not being played, <br/>
&gt; else we probably<br/>
&gt; &gt;would not have been wiped out. We also all know that char is <br/>
&gt; a twink, not a<br/>
&gt; &gt;primary. I think that robe on a twink would hurt our guild&#39;s <br/>
&gt; credibility<br/>
&gt; &gt;somewhat as the twink belongs to the head of the guild. It&#39;s also our<br/>
&gt; &gt;opinion you can&#39;t function as a good chanter unless the <br/>
&gt; person is giving the<br/>
&gt; &gt;character their whole attention. I&#39;d like to hear the <br/>
&gt; opinion of others on<br/>
&gt; &gt;this. Were we out of line?<br/>
&gt; &gt;The result was I said we&#39;d walk on the guild if they <br/>
&gt; insisted on lottoing<br/>
&gt; &gt;it. They agreed to give the robe to the other chanter.<br/>
