I think the spawn is 21 minutes and if you spread then you fight every 7<br/>
mins. Not one gob per 18 - but more like one every 8 - once you got it<br/>
spread out.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Place&quot; meaning the whole dungeon.  Because of mob density, it&#39;s hard<br/>
for even a single group to fight thru - way too many blues agro and the gobs<br/>
try to run - and get help.  It seems like you need numbers (2 or 3 groups)<br/>
to overpower them safely.<br/>

&gt; Except one time, I got in a group that knew what to do: invis and go to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; warlord room.  Camp there and keep the door shut.  Spread the spawn and<br/>
fite<br/>
&gt; once every 18 minutes or so.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  The place looks like it would be good for 2 or<br/>
&gt; 3 mid 20 to lo 30 groups to work if they worked together.  But at that<br/>
age,<br/>
&gt; we were still learning how to be a good single group - let alone<br/>
coordinate<br/>
&gt; with 2 others. </span></blockquote></div>
