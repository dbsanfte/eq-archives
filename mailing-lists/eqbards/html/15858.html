<div id="ygrps-yiv-951967407">Yeah I know Phoenix has had their share of problems too.  Looks to be a<br/>
major guild shake up on Sol Ro if people can&#39;t learn to get along.  I&#39;ve<br/>
even heard that Paradigm (the major &quot;we love to hate them&quot; guild on Sol<br/>
Ro)... has been having troubles killing gods and dragons and such (gasp!).<br/>
I&#39;m finding playing my bard more and more appealing - although I think<br/>
staying below level 40 is key.<br/>
<br/>
As for the armor, give me another week to see what I can scrounge up.. but<br/>
thanks a lot for the offer... its really nice to have the offer :)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. On the positive side (and ok this isnt bard related but I HAVE to<br/>
share)... I got Shaman gloves last night !!! Yay!!!! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I keep watching my guild squabble and get upset, not just over planes stuff,<br/>
but ANYTHING high-level recently. And I find myself more and more content<br/>
NOT<br/>
to be involved in those levels and to be able to say &quot;I&#39;m not going because<br/>
I&#39;m too little&quot; rather than feel like I am being guilted to go on something<br/>
that<br/>
seems so little fun .<br/>
