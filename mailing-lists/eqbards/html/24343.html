<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-231295372">Once again, I offer no guarantee that the following information is <br/>
correct. What I will say, is that it is accurate to the best of my <br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1, Now that you have the basic stuff down, roughly how long <br/>
&gt;does Hate take to clear now?  I remember per patch people used <br/>
&gt;to do planes in about 4 - 8 or so hours, baring problems.  Due <br/>
&gt;to pathing and such now, im curious how much longer poh will <br/>
&gt;take on average.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We usually spend some extra time working the lower level to make sure <br/>
we have little &quot;extra&quot; aggro on level 2. This weekend, we were <br/>
hunting in 10-12 hour blocks... I would say we spend 3-4 hours in <br/>
lower before heading up. With that said, we have NEVER cleared upper. <br/>
We have killed a lot of MOBs, but tracking shows there to always be <br/>
plenty more. *Grins*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Have you come to a conclusion what the spawn time on the <br/>
&gt;2nd floor mobs are?  12hrs same as level 1? Mini-bosses 24?  <br/>
&gt;less? more?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I cannot answer either of these. What I can say is that when we go <br/>
back up the next day, the MOBs have respawned. The mini-bosses see to <br/>
be on a &gt;24 hour timer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. Have you found a trash can to store all those ceramonial<br/>
&gt; robes?  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, yes! I have found a &quot;secret storage&quot; button located right <br/>
above my 8 inventory slots which does this quite well. I can&#39;t <br/>
remember exactly how the button is labeled, but I think it is <br/>
something like &quot;Destroy&quot;. *Smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Be well all,<br/>
