<div id="ygrps-yiv-514738080">That&#39;s bull. Sure, it may be true for some people, but most druids I know<br/>
(including myself) are constant groupers. Grouping is where the fun is at.<br/>
However, it&#39;s not fun to be decent at some things (DD and heal) for 30<br/>
levels, then suddenly have half your ability taken away (DDs resisted) and<br/>
your other main ability fade away slowly (no heals above greater heal).<br/>
Yes, you can still be very useful. But no longer can you be, to a group,<br/>
what you&#39;ve been for 30 levels (a nuker or healer as needed). That&#39;s a<br/>
hard change to make -- especially when Verant keeps waving in your face<br/>
&quot;you&#39;re the second/third best nukers in the game!&quot; but decline to mention<br/>
that&#39;s IF you&#39;re not resisted.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like how they go &quot;you have the best root in the game! it roots AND<br/>
does damage!&quot; Sure.. at level 30, that 10dmg with a root is really worth<br/>
the extra 40% resists..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, getting pretty off topic here.. =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see you read the editorial on EQvault about druids too.  My druid is using <br/>
ensnare.. and THAT gets resisted quite a bit, as does immolate (I stopped <br/>
using it)  Basically, in places like Solusek, I&#39;ve been using things like <br/>
damage shields, lightning (give me a break 99 damage? HAH), crud,  and <br/>
tremor where appropriate.  I&#39;ve been grouping with mostly the same ppl since <br/>
level 7, too.  Thank goodness they are friends, or my druid would soon not <br/>
have a group.  Still at level 30 too.  (I hate to see what the higher levels <br/>
are like.. UGH!)<br/>
<br/>
Now.. as for ON TOPIC.. my bard finally made level 20 last night!! woohoo!!  <br/>
Never thought I&#39;d see the day, since my poor bard has died at least 3 times <br/>
every level since 15.  It was getting so bad, my regular group started <br/>
calling me &quot;bard bait&quot; heh.<br/>
<br/>
Theres no doubt Verant needs to do some more tweaking on the classes.<br/>
