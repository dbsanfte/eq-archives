The steps in question are any in the temple, although he is quite correct in <br/>
the pulling tactics that many exploit.  I have seen lizzies get stuck on a <br/>
level and stepping on steps to a level frees them up.  I also agree that the <br/>
pulling method that uses the technique he described is very very boring, and <br/>
i agree that it is not as fast as a few normal fights.  Nevertheless, folks <br/>
do it.  The point I was trying to make was that this location was not a good <br/>
place to try the two bards and Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest going to a lowish level dungeon to try the lullably and two bards. <br/>
  Black Burrow comes to mind.<br/>

Fflewduer Fflamson  only bard in guild or I would do this myself!!  (ok lame <br/>
excuse :P)<br/>

&gt;Ok, Cazic-Thule spoiler time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I DO NOT CONDONE THESE TACTICS (sorry Harm), but knowing how the pathing<br/>
&gt;works in any zone is very important to being successful there, the Archon<br/>
&gt;Temple top is no exception.  The Archon Temple is fun to hold and great<br/>
&gt;experience when held in a sportsmanlike fashion, however, I am only human<br/>
&gt;and have used these pieces of information to save my cute bardic ass a few<br/>
&gt;times when I&#39;ve gotten into a jam.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Crier Sharpsong<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Archon Temple is very buggy pathwise.  There are two primary ways in<br/>
&gt;which groups exploit this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) A puller is SoWed and (with or without levitation) runs down the tiers<br/>
&gt;and away from the Archon&#39;s steps to pull.  He punches a lizard in the nose<br/>
&gt;and runs back to the group at the base of the steps.  Generally speaking<br/>
&gt;that lizard hasn&#39;t followed him back, it is somewhere away from the Archon<br/>
&gt;steps, aggrod and &quot;frozen&quot;.  Quite often groups will curse the bad pathing<br/>
&gt;and run to the lizard to defeat it (nothing wrong with that).  However, if<br/>
&gt;the puller stands *on the steps* themselves at the Archon Temple top, the<br/>
&gt;lizard will unfreeze and run to the puller at the steps.  To be perfectly<br/>
&gt;clear: You MUST stand upon the steps for the mobs to come to you.<br/>
&gt;Therefore, the puller&#39;s presence on the steps becomes something of an <br/>
&gt;on/off<br/>
&gt;switch for mob activity and movement.  The exploit part of this occurs once<br/>
&gt;these lizards have come to the puller at the steps.  If the puller to whom<br/>
&gt;the lizards are aggrod removes himself from the steps they will once again<br/>
&gt;&quot;freeze&quot; due to the pathing bug.  The group can now fire at will with <br/>
&gt;little<br/>
&gt;chance of the lizards leaving the steps to actively engaging them in melee.<br/>
&gt;Other melee members of the party can sometimes melee the lizard on the <br/>
&gt;steps<br/>
&gt;in safety - it&#39;s as though the hate list of these buggy lizards doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;reorganize itself.  Regardless of the damage others do to them, the lizards<br/>
&gt;remain aggrod on the first guy that bonked them on the head.  If the <br/>
&gt;lizards<br/>
&gt;*do* engage in melee, the entire party can move away from the steps to the<br/>
&gt;first 90 degree corner (either seems to work) and the lizards have another<br/>
&gt;very good chance of freezing when the party reaches the corner.  A group<br/>
&gt;that knows how to work the pathing of the lizards up there can have a <br/>
&gt;*very*<br/>
&gt;safe time of taking out lizzies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been in groups that had the puller deliberately go out and smack as<br/>
&gt;many lizzies as possible to create a 12 liz train to the Archon.  Once<br/>
&gt;there, the puller stands on the steps and takes a bit of abuse while all <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;lizards catch up.  Then the puller does his best to arrange the lizards <br/>
&gt;into<br/>
&gt;as closely knit a group as possible on the steps, then jumps from the steps<br/>
&gt;freezing them all in place.  Wizards and Mages then AE the whole bundle <br/>
&gt;down<br/>
&gt;at their leisure.  I quickly departed these groups because this is BORING <br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt;hell, and actually not any faster (I&#39;d argue slower) than a good<br/>
&gt;old-fashioned fight or three.  The only reason I was invited was as a mana<br/>
&gt;pump for the casters.  Basically I was to stand around watching and playing<br/>
&gt;Clarity continuously.  Forget it - the Throne Room is more fun and better<br/>
&gt;potential loot in that case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Mobs that are aggrod to a party cannot reach the actual flat top of the<br/>
&gt;temple.  If (when) trains of lizards occur, simply run up the sloped walls<br/>
&gt;of the Archon&#39;s Temple and you will be both out of melee range and out of<br/>
&gt;spell range.  The mobs will remain aggrod on you, but will mill around on<br/>
&gt;the Archon steps.  Casters can cast on the lizards from here in relative<br/>
&gt;safety (this is an confirmed exploit by Verant, you can get BANNED if <br/>
&gt;caught<br/>
&gt;doing this).  Large races will either need a levitation (maybe a shrink<br/>
&gt;would work too) or old Guise of the Deceiver in order for them to reach the<br/>
&gt;top.  If the situation with the lizards gets unmanageable, simply camp out<br/>
&gt;up here and come back to clear their aggro lists.  All members of your <br/>
&gt;party<br/>
&gt;must camp for this to work.  I have camped overnight on the top here many<br/>
&gt;times.  Lizards simply cannot get up here, and the two or three times that<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve seen it they 32k (suicide) themselves.  I have *never* heard that<br/>
&gt;running to the top to escape lizards is an exploit, only that casting from<br/>
&gt;here is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Use your knowledge wisely.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So what you are saying is that because pathing is screwed up at the top <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the temple, mobs standing on the steps will not move down to the bottom <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the steps and attack anyone standing there?  That may explain why I <br/>
&gt;rarely<br/>
&gt; &gt; got attacked.  I was standing at the bottom of the steps along with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric and enchanter.  The other three characters were on the steps<br/>
&gt; &gt; meleeing.<br/>
