<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096122885">Keep in mind you can&#39;t attack back, either.  I have a level 29 rogue also,<br/>
and have found that whenever I try to disarm a pet that is currently<br/>
attacking something else, and it will attack me.  I think the charm thing<br/>
goes on the same basis, in that you were on the pet&#39;s hate list because you<br/>
charmed something it was attacking, much like I was on it because I was<br/>
trying to disarm it while it was fighting (ok, kinda different, but you get<br/>
the point...the pets won&#39;t attack PCs unless they are in already in attack<br/>
mode and have reason - by way of being taunted - to attack something higher<br/>
on its hate list).  Pets&#39; spells won&#39;t affect you, btw, but they can still<br/>
hit ya hard if you&#39;re in range.  When I got the pets to attack me using<br/>
disarm, I could just back off and they would leave me alone (farther away<br/>
put me lower on hate list) then when the MOB died, it would be non agro to<br/>
me again (not in auto attack mode).  I&#39;m not sure if theres any quick fix<br/>
like this using charm, as I&#39;ve never charmed anything before (my bard is<br/>
only level 16 =&#92;  ).<br/>

&gt; I have had this happend to me twice this week now.  I charm something that<br/>
&gt; had been attacking a Shamen&#39;s pet (one was a party members pet, other a<br/>
&gt; non-party member). And both times the shamen pet decided I looked tasty<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; started nipping at me, bad dog! :)  So becareful using charm are shamen&#39;s<br/>
&gt; pets, unless you like being their chew toy.<br/>
