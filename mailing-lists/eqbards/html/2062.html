<div id="ygrps-yiv-411191885">Sounds like you&#39;ve been having a run of bad luck, that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
To maximize your skill chances, use it in your primary if at all possible,<br/>
that&#39;s a guaranteed swing and skill check every 2.3 seconds,(or less, if<br/>
you&#39;re singing a combat song) versus your secondary, which at your level is<br/>
only a 20 percent chance at best that the off hand swings.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve got intelligence boosting items, wear them, they help a bit, too.<br/>
<br/>
Dumping skill points into it won&#39;t make it level faster by use.  1 skill or<br/>
100, the chances of skilling are the same every swing, all else being equal.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to speed pierce skilling, use the dirk as primary and a<br/>
fine steel or even regular dagger secondary.<br/>
<br/>
Skill checks are  made on every swing, hit or miss, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Dvinn isn&#39;t supposed to load the dirk every time. Somebody goofed,<br/>
missed a decimal point (100 percent looks so much like 10 percent, eh?) so<br/>
expect the rarity of the item to go up soon.<br/>

&gt;Hello all!<br/>
&gt; Well i got myself a Dirk , Love the stats , love the effects<br/>
&gt;.......now if the damn thing would just work right. My question is , how<br/>
long<br/>
&gt;did it take everyone out there to get your piercing skills up ? This is<br/>
&gt;mainly to the foolish people like me who didn&#39;t think to rotate weapons and<br/>
&gt;keep all skills maxed .....( whoops). I have been in a group and solo for a<br/>
&gt;day and a half now using my dirk, and my skill level is 7! ( still gotta go<br/>
&gt;to the guild and throw a point into pierce) So i have 2 more questions 1)<br/>
if<br/>
&gt;i throw a point or 2 in to pierce does it make leveling faster from that<br/>
&gt;point onward ? and 2) because pierce isn&#39;t the bards intial attack type ,<br/>
or<br/>
&gt;perhaps its preffered weapon type ( is that worded ok?? , it might not be )<br/>
&gt;does it make piercing harder to learn than 1h slash ??<br/>
&gt;Ok , many thanks .<br/>
