<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218950148">Hail a Lurker!  Hey Rylos!  I have had some zoning issues as well, both in<br/>
Lavastorm and OOT.  I zoned into OOT from Butcherblock, only to find myself<br/>
on the sister isle.  This has happened a couple of times and is a real pain<br/>
as the Freeport bound boat no longer stops there.  I have also zoned in and<br/>
found myself on the bottom of the world.  There was no escape from this<br/>
situation, so I had to wait for a guide to show up.<br/>
<br/>
Lavastorm hasn&#39;t dropped me in Lava yet, but I have zoned from Najena into<br/>
OOT.  That was truly bizarre, especially since I was actually headed to<br/>
Butcherblock.  I&#39;ve also zoned out of Najena and appeared in Najena near the<br/>
Tentacle Terror room.  Very odd.<br/>

I have found Lavastorm to be very buggy when zoning in and out of it.  I<br/>
have zoned out of Najena into a pool of lava.  The guide didn&#39;t bat an eye<br/>
about rezzing me so I figured it must happen quite often.  I also had an odd<br/>
occurance happen last night.  I was zoning from Nektulos and had a couple<br/>
guards on me.  and while zoning was disconnected several times.  When I<br/>
finally got back in I was in the NE corner of the zone rather than by the<br/>
zone line.  I have only had this happen when zoning from Oasis and dropping<br/>
in near the grassy section of N Ro.  <br/>
