<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718174494">Kevin, I don&#39;t know about Rangers as I&#39;d never play one ;) My post is <br/>
regarding bards, and nowhere does it mention any other melee classes. I am <br/>
fully aware of the capabilities of the other melee classes with double <br/>
attack, riposte, etc., and if you think I meant general weapon damage across <br/>
all classes...well, this is a bard forum. I will always believe that is in <br/>
*MY* best interest to not use Yaks because most of my time is spent on large <br/>
raids where I want as little attention to myself as possible. I have seen <br/>
log analyes but have not performed any tests myself. I have seen both <br/>
weapons compared endlessly with this person or that person comparing logs <br/>
and analyzing with different formulas. I&#39;ve seen tests where the yak beat <br/>
out the wak, and I&#39;ve seen tests where Waks beat out Yak with procs.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I think it comes down to a trade off situation for us bards. At <br/>
the lower levels of proccing (37-45) I loved my Ykeshas because most of my <br/>
time was spent in guk or Sol B. After 46 when you start hitting the planes <br/>
and go on FG/Phinigel raids regularly I think they become a liability. But <br/>
hey - it&#39;s just my opinion, and I believe a Yak &quot;vastly&quot; outdamaging a wak <br/>
in the hands of a bard can be considered exaggeration most of the time (in <br/>
longer fights).<br/>

&gt;Sar I dunno about Bards, I&#39;ve never bothered with Yaks myself ;)  But as a<br/>
&gt;Ranger I can guarantee that a Y&#39;kesha vastly out damages a wakizashi.<br/>
&gt;Rangers have done a lot of testing of log files, combat durations, solo<br/>
&gt;fights, what they can and cannot kill with the various weapons etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not going to re-hash those discussions here but suffice to say the<br/>
&gt;Y&#39;kesha, every time, out dammaged the Wakizashi by enough that we all <br/>
&gt;agreed<br/>
&gt;that we were better off with a Y&#39;kesha over a Wakizashi.  The Wakizashi&#39;s<br/>
&gt;dmg output is not significant enough during a fight to out-dmg a y&#39;kesha<br/>
&gt;once the Y&#39;kesha procs.  Remember, Rangers have Dual Wield AND Double<br/>
&gt;Attack, so they tend to proc more often than us when using them.  My Ranger<br/>
&gt;proc&#39;s between 3 and 5 times a fight.  So 3*70 or 5*70 additional dmg.  <br/>
&gt;Many<br/>
&gt;rangers average higher (My ranger&#39;s dex is horrible (&lt;80)) and I still<br/>
&gt;regularly proc 5 times a fight.  A ranger with 100 dex will *regularly* <br/>
&gt;proc<br/>
&gt;between 4 and 7 times a fight. Sometimes more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ciao!  As I said the rangers discussed it.  The numbers may be different <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;Bards since we don&#39;t have Double Attack or the Rangers THAC0 table and thus<br/>
&gt;hit a LOT less often.  But I suspect people will find that the Y&#39;kesha will<br/>
&gt;still edge the Waki&#39;s out in dmg.  Though not by nearly as much as it did<br/>
&gt;for rangers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this clears up my post ;)<br/>
