<div id="ygrps-yiv-675193402">Hey gang!<br/>
  At 19, I&#39;ve managed to acquire 4 items needed for the lambent armor quest <br/>
without any real help from anyone thus far, with the exception with the <br/>
lambent stone itself.  I&#39;ll tell you this, for all you newer bards  out <br/>
there (including me), you can get these items fairly easily...<br/>
<br/>
Dark Boned Bracer from Greater Dark Bone in Unrest...  found mine on a <br/>
corpse lying at the zone as SOON as I stepped in! How convenient. Picked it <br/>
up, turned around and left. This was at lvl 15-16ish?<br/>
<br/>
Grinnenne Charm from Griffenne in W Kar? Once again, i zoned in from the <br/>
wooden bridge, made an announcement this time, actually... Someone&#39;s like <br/>
&quot;one charm in front of the wooden bride!&quot; Woohoo. Walked straight out on the <br/>
path, spotted it, and grabbed it. yay! I think I was 16ish here too.<br/>
<br/>
Opalline Helm from Deep Water Goblin in Oasis... Hey, there are normally <br/>
people pulling these guys and their pets to either the SRo zone or right <br/>
there near those huts on the shore during peak hours. If you can get on and <br/>
over there during these times, I&#39;d make an effort to do so. You know, the <br/>
helm itself is pretty sorry to wear itself as armor, the people who are high <br/>
enough to kill DWG&#39;s most likely already have something better than an ac8 <br/>
helm with no stat enhancers. I was maybe lvl 17 or so then.<br/>
<br/>
Shin Greaves and Shin Gauntlets from Shin Ghoul Knights and Shin Knights in <br/>
Lower Guk... (forget which drops what) People pull these mobs to zone all <br/>
the time. The spawn rate isn&#39;t bad, and the way to do it is wait just down <br/>
the hall from the zone into Upper. They like to fight right at the zone <br/>
line, and if they zone, they&#39;ll turn to you. Again, once you wait a little <br/>
while, shouts and ooc&#39;s will say _____ is on _____ at zone. Pick it up and <br/>
go. Now the trick with Lower Guk is you have to get down there without <br/>
getting mauled. I just made 19, so I had sonorous clouding (invis song). I <br/>
also had NO faction hits against frogloks. When uninvis, they were dubious <br/>
or apprehensive? forget... anyway, yay me! The other trick is trying to find <br/>
it. That I&#39;ll leave up to you, cuz I couldn&#39;t even try to begin explaining <br/>
now LOL! Btw, I think both mobs could see through invis too.<br/>
<br/>
Icy Greaves from Elite Goblin Guard in Permafrost Keep... Ya, another easy <br/>
one lol! This is the one I really did need help. These guys ain&#39;t no <br/>
cocktail party. They spawn way down in the valley with the King and <br/>
patriarch. I was with two groups 35+ one night. They were there for the Vox <br/>
bracer i believe. First group left, I still had no greaves. Besides, two ppl <br/>
in that group wanted greaves themselves. I made a /tell to a 46 Pal to see <br/>
if he would kill one for me so I could loot. I offered him my Runed Bone <br/>
Fork. Ya it was pretty late. So he was camping some weight reduicing bag, <br/>
and said he&#39;d be down in a little bit. I told him the king just spawned - he <br/>
was scowling at me =P yikes! He hurried down with his two friends. From that <br/>
point on, we were there for 4+ hrs killing everything that spawned. You know <br/>
what they asked me to sing? Chant of battle!! (they asked for some dex <br/>
songs. was the only one I had. heehee!) The paladin leaves, with just two <br/>
fighters and this singing guy. wiz and druid actually. Hardly a balanced <br/>
group. Needless to say, I died once. Ran back from Halas, got camo from the <br/>
druid (didn&#39;t have my wind instrument obviously), and ran back down. I <br/>
noticed very little exp loss, and it was a small price to pay. As it turns <br/>
out, I got 2 FS wpns, 1h silvery war axe, and the icy greaves finally did <br/>
drop.<br/>
<br/>
So these five items I&#39;ve attained at just level 19. Yesterday (sat), i went <br/>
to the temple and got my lambent greaves and bracer. One small problem with <br/>
lambent. It doesn&#39;t match with barbed arms and bronze boots and chest. EW!! <br/>
I still look pretty pimp.<br/>
<br/>
And regarding the lambent stones... By being at the right place at the right <br/>
time, I&#39;ve received 2/3 i&#39;ve owned for free! So you can finesse your way <br/>
into some lambent if you got the skill! =P<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck all, and sorry to babble! I like to share my good fortune and <br/>
encourage others.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks go to Athren Notechaser for the questions he answered for me <br/>
before I went into the temple. You rock bro!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Greetings!<br/>
&gt;Yesterday I was allowed to tag along with the Esprit de Corps guild on <br/>
&gt;Cazic<br/>
&gt;Thule server.  We did an assault on Mistmoore castle.  4 groups of 30&#39;s to<br/>
&gt;low 40&#39;s (i am lvl 35) went in the secret way from the crypt up to the<br/>
&gt;bedroom.  We cleared all the hallways and the bathrooom, then set up base <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;the bedroom.  Got the black silk gloves off the 10th Deathly Usher I <br/>
&gt;looted.<br/>
&gt;   Not as common as I was expecting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I had the gypsy musicians on track, but the groups were reluctant <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;pull them.  They said there were 5 hard mobs between us and the musicians.<br/>
&gt;I believe it.  At one point our 4 groups were completely destroyed.  The<br/>
&gt;spawns there are very deadly.  We often were fighting 6-8 mobs.  Perhaps<br/>
&gt;part of the problem was the groups learning to work together.  Anyway, for<br/>
&gt;those who have yet to get the gypsy lute, be advised that this is no small<br/>
&gt;task.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On another note, I was able to get the Deep Water Goblin&#39;s Opaline helm on<br/>
&gt;the 3rd try.  I knew nothing of these DW Goblins, so be warned that<br/>
&gt;attacking one will likely get you 5-6 plus their pets.<br/>
