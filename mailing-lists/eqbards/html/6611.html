Yes I agree Verant seems to hate powergamers very much although I doubt for<br/>
the real reasons. Verant seems to believe that the reason most people are<br/>
leaving the game ( level 50 people that is or close ) is because we&#39;ve<br/>
beaten the game typically for a powergamer. However I know most people just<br/>
got bored with it because there was nothing else to do with their current<br/>
char or areas like Lower Guk or Sol B are just too crowded. If verant would<br/>
add some more high level areas and fix PoF I seroiously doubt this would<br/>
continue. On another note almost all the 40+ I know and group with have a<br/>
secondary char some even have 3-4.  Hopefully Verant will begin to realize<br/>
problems as more and more people leave.<br/>
<br/>
On another note Verant seems to think they can keep powergamers from<br/>
powerleveling. Most recent thing has to do with the dot nerf. Has anybody<br/>
seen kiting stop or even lessen? I sure haven&#39;t. If they would stop worrying<br/>
about keeping people low level and start adding stuff to the game instead of<br/>
nerfing they would see a lot less people leaving or selling on ebay.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Lol heh even before they twinked fear it was dangerous to go there and to<br/>
&gt;&gt; kill the big guys in zone they need to move it back to the wya it was<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know about lowering the cap, but, I think this was a typical<br/>
&gt;Verant reaction to powergamers (of which I was one) Basically, the zone<br/>
&gt;was really tough before, even when you took 2 or 3 groups as one party.<br/>
&gt;You still had a damn good chance of many people dying and then spending<br/>
&gt;a few hours on corpse recovery.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But, a lot of us play(ed) 12+ hours a day. We could afford to take the<br/>
&gt;losses and still come out of the zone after a few days with what Verant<br/>
&gt;considered to be &quot;easy&quot; loot. So they nerfed it. However, unlike the way<br/>
&gt;they nerfed the dragons, which we can still go kill, if we put a good<br/>
&gt;enough bunch of people together and have a leader who can keep things<br/>
&gt;together, they managed to nerf it so you don&#39;t even have a chance to<br/>
&gt;zone in before you are dead. That&#39;s just, IMO, sloppy work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OB Bard so this doesn&#39;t get kabonged. Almost the only bard only items in<br/>
&gt;the game are in PoF. Other than the drum, isn&#39;t anyone else just a<br/>
&gt;little bummed out at the dearth of bard specific items? We used to at<br/>
&gt;least share some of the cool rogue daggers, but they took that away from<br/>
&gt;us and gave us nothing to make up for it. Meanwhile, after the huge<br/>
&gt;warrior protest a while back, you can&#39;t even kill a firebeetle without<br/>
&gt;finding some new warrior only armor or weapon. What&#39;s up with that? Do<br/>
&gt;we have to yell and scream until our faces turn blue to get any<br/>
&gt;attention at all?<br/>
