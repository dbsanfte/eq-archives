Why *no* AE?  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/whynoae.jpg">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/whynoae.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
In this last one, we killed the Protector of Sky and Sirran the Lunatic *immediately* spawned.  Any AE would have agro&#39;d him and the group right after a long fight would have been hurtin&#39; for certain.  <br/>
<br/>
I am 2 items from completeing 2 Sky quests:<br/>
<br/>
Cloak of Song (need light woolen cloak) [hoping its got better stats than my Liz Cloak which should not be hard to beat]<br/>
<br/>

p.s. had a rather disturbing incident.  logged in and when we were ready to rock, started to switch over to 6 note and Yk from the Lord Grim Scythe I was fooling around with.  ack!!!  no Yk?!?!?!?!  &quot;/auction did i loan my Yk to anyone last night?&quot;  Looked everywhere. Even did /corpse thinking maybe i did not fully loot my last corpse. Really puzzling.  Not too happy. Thought about doing &quot;/petition Help I lost my Yk to some kinda bug - can you give me a new one? Please!&quot; but &lt;fat chance&gt; Finally, I died and got ressed back in. Woo Hoo!!!!  There it is!  My Missing Yk!!! For some odd reason, it was invis to me in my own inventory and only showed after I died and got ressed back. Spooky.<br/>
