<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275484201">Personally, I fight with the dagger Pugius (5/21, magic piercing) in one hand<br/>
and a dwarven axe in the other.  Neither were selected for roleplaying purposes<br/>
particularly, but both fit the &quot;classic bard&quot; type of mold, in that they are<br/>
both light and very fast.<br/>
<br/>
Many people have commented on the fact that bards can wear chain and plate as<br/>
not fitting the mold very well.  To that, all I can say is that we aren&#39;t celtic<br/>
minstrels in EQ folks, we&#39;re a class that was designed for this game<br/>
specifically.  If people want to roleplay in the classic celtic style,<br/>
fantastic!  But if you want to roleplay yourself as mighty plate-wearing,<br/>
axe-hacking fighter who belts out tunes of war at the same time, I say fantastic<br/>
to that as well.<br/>
<br/>
Though playing a lute in plate gloves is odd no matter how you cut it.  At least<br/>
the wood elf ringmail gloves have finger cut-outs in the 3d model.  :)<br/>
