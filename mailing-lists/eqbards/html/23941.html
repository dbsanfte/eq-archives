<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062032700">there&#39;s also the twink factor...  the paladin can pay for a full set of gear<br/>
for the necro.  so the necro has to struggle alot less as he&#39;ll have more<br/>
mana/better gear to do his thing<br/>
<br/>
My bard has about 40 days played i guess, maybe more and is still not 50,<br/>
but my necro was level 50 in 17 days /played... <br/>

<br/>
there are a few reasons this is and a few more why it would have been<br/>
exacerbated.<br/>
<br/>
1.  experience penalty.  paladin has 40%, necro has (i believe) 10%.<br/>
2.  necro can solo much more easily than a paladin.  how much of those 128<br/>
days were<br/>
      spent looking for a group?<br/>
3.  did he work on any trade skills like blacksmithing for his class armor?<br/>
these types of <br/>
      things are very time consuming.<br/>
4.  the paladin would likely have spent most of his hunting times in groups,<br/>
which, unless it<br/>
      is a very good group in an uncrowded area, will not equate to the<br/>
speed of soloing.  if you <br/>
      are in a group camping frenzy when there are 80 other people in lower<br/>
guk, you will not be<br/>
      nonstop killing.  if you are fear kiting stuff in dreadlands solo you<br/>
will be non stop killing (due<br/>
      to number of available mobs)<br/>
<br/>
there&#39;s probably other reasons like the time it takes to run back to the<br/>
paladin&#39;s corpse, while the<br/>
necro can just bind where he is fighting.  or perhaps now that the paladin<br/>
knows where a lot of the<br/>
good places to hunt are, he knows exactly where to take the necro for the<br/>
best experience.<br/>
