<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105705270">Ok Reed, thanks a ton!  You did earn me some strange looks as I laughed<br/>
myself out of my cube all the way to the water fountain, but it was worth<br/>
it!  Now the challenge will be to take these characters as they pass thru<br/>
the bards guild on their way to find a better class!<br/>

Well, not really about bards, except written by one...<br/>
<br/>
 -  Reed (E&#39;ci)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Master: Welcome Students to the path of a monk.  Today is your first day,<br/>
and that should be spent learning the primary tenant of a monk: uncontrolled<br/>
violence will only destroy one&#39;s self.  Come students, let us be still and<br/>
contemplate this thought.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf: Excuse me, excuse me sir!<br/>
<br/>
Master: Yes young seeker of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf: Do you mind if I ask a question before we start?<br/>
<br/>
Master: Go right ahead young one.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf: When do we get to gate?<br/>
<br/>
Master: A monk will never gate.  Alas, it is not our calling.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf:  All my friends gate, and they can bind too.<br/>
<br/>
Master: We are masters of the body, not of magic.  The body is pure, and our<br/>
forces come from this purity, not from outside.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf:  Well that sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Alas child, you do not understand.  Our way is to become one with<br/>
your inner body, your muscle, your sinew.  To channel magic would be to mix<br/>
spring water with gutter water.  Come class, let us meditate on our new<br/>
found knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Dominic:  Pardon my interruption...<br/>
<br/>
Master: Another question.  My, an eager class so full of interest.<br/>
 <br/>
Dominic:  Do we really have to wear an orange headband.<br/>
<br/>
Master: The orange headband is a sign of honor; earned through the trials of<br/>
combat.<br/>
<br/>
Dominic: But orange doesn&#39;t look good on me, it&#39;s just not my color.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Alas my child, you too do not understand.  We lead a simple life,<br/>
showing no want of earthly possessions.  Except for our clothing, we need<br/>
little.  We live the humble life, wearing what little we have to show our<br/>
devotion to our path.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf:  If I was an enchanter, I&#39;ll bet I could change the color of the<br/>
headband for you.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Class, it is time for silence as caterpillar is silent while<br/>
becoming a butterfly.  Let us dwell upon our future path...<br/>
<br/>
[Class is silent although restless for a while)]<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth: Excuse me master, but I have a question about what you said.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Who disturbs the calm as a falling tree disturbs the forest?<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth:  Me!  Are you deaf or something?<br/>
<br/>
Master: Now that our concentration is broken, what is your question young<br/>
initiate?<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth: I was thinking of what you said about not needing possessions...<br/>
<br/>
Master: Very good, you are contemplating a true and right thought.<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth: Where do we keep our sword?<br/>
<br/>
Master: Our body is a weapon; why would we need anything else?<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth:  So we can kill something?<br/>
<br/>
Master: Over time, your hands and feet will be able to do more damage, than<br/>
even the greatest paladin with his holy weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth: Are some kind of loony?!<br/>
<br/>
Master: Young student, please step forward so you may learn more closely the<br/>
ways of a monk.<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth: Cool.  Is this where you want me to stand.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Class, please observe:<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth:  OOOF!  Hey, your hit me!<br/>
<br/>
Master: Class, as you can see, we have no need of weapons..<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth:  Hey, that wasn&#39;t fair, I didn&#39;t even have a weapon!<br/>
<br/>
Master:  Here is a fine steel sword young student.  You will find that it<br/>
only gets in the way.<br/>
 <br/>
Smashmouth:  Yeah, we&#39;ll see about that.  Try it again now that I&#39;m ready.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Class, observe again<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth:  OOOF!  Hey, I&#39;ll bet you couldn&#39;t do that with a shield.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Here is a shield.<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth: Now try getting past me this time.  OOOF!  Ok,  I think I&#39;m<br/>
going to lay down here for a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf: If you had gate, you wouldn&#39;t get hit at all.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Class, S3 has learned a valuable lesson, that the hand without a<br/>
weapon is quicker when not chained with metal.<br/>
 <br/>
Dominic:  Master, we only use our hands and feet?<br/>
<br/>
Master: Yes child, you learn quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Dominic: That sounds kind of messy.<br/>
<br/>
Master: When we punch or kick a foe, we battle it directly, human against<br/>
monster.  Others use weapons or magic as a crutch because they have not<br/>
fully developed the potential of their own body.<br/>
<br/>
Dominic:  Do we have to kill giant spiders with our hands?<br/>
<br/>
Master: Yes my child.<br/>
<br/>
Dominic:  I can see it now. Well, the bug juice on my hand is going to look<br/>
just spiffy, clashing with my orange headband!<br/>
<br/>
Master: Class, you do not understand.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf:  No gate, no possessions to speak of, except for ones that will<br/>
clash with Dominic&#39;s wardrobe.  This doesn&#39;t sound too good to me.<br/>
<br/>
Master: My child, a monk is one of the most exciting classes to be.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf: Yeah, well, I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Your humble teacher has run up alone to Lord Nagafen, attacked him,<br/>
and lived.<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth: Yeah right!  And bixies commonly kill giants.  Tell me another<br/>
one. OOOF!  Hey!<br/>
 <br/>
Master: Please show proper respect for one&#39;s elders.  It was my job to run<br/>
ahead and lure him and his fire giant guards.  I was to run alone to Lord<br/>
Nagafen&#39;s throne room alone and bring him back.<br/>
<br/>
Dominic: So you have god guts instead of spider guts on your hands.  I<br/>
suppose the bigger they are, the more they splatter.  I am doomed to lead a<br/>
messy life.<br/>
<br/>
Master: Well child, the blood did not soil my hands that evening.  That is<br/>
not the proper role of monk.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf:  Huh?  You run up, bonk Naggy on the nose, run back, and you don&#39;t<br/>
even fight him?  What exactly were you doing?<br/>
<br/>
Master:  I used one of the skills that you will learn later down the path:<br/>
feign death.<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth:  You rolled over and played dead?   Bwahahaha  OOOF!   Bwahahaa<br/>
OOOF!  Bwahahaha.  OOOF!  OOOF!  OOOF!  It&#39;s gwetting dark in hwere...<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf:  So let me get this straight.  After years of learning to fight<br/>
with your body, you come to the pinnacle of your career, and feign death? <br/>
<br/>
Master: The role of the puller in combat is an honorable one.  It can only<br/>
be done by ones great with knowledge and skill.<br/>
<br/>
Gandalf:  I&#39;m never going to be able to explain this to dad.  &quot;Well dad, I&#39;m<br/>
really a great fighter, but I spend most of my time feigning death.&quot;  I<br/>
think I&#39;m going to find a magic guild.  At least they can gate.<br/>
<br/>
Dominic:  The monk life is too messy for me.  I think I&#39;m going to quit and<br/>
become a tailor.<br/>
<br/>
Smashmouth:  Well, I&#39;m off to the fighter&#39;s guild, at least they don&#39;t teach<br/>
them to play dead against their foes.  OOOF!  Hey!<br/>
<br/>
Master:  Alas, the young initiates have all left the calling of a monk.<br/>
Thank the gods.<br/>
