&gt; The flip side to that is a lot like what I&#39;ve read in Rainbow Six by Tom<br/>
&gt; Clancy which deals with commando&#39;s vs terrorists. There&#39;s a situation. You<br/>
&gt; set up a plan and each person has a task/job. You adapt to the circumstances<br/>
&gt; in an environment full with lethal combat results.<br/>

&gt; If there was a MUD with this latter profile, I can&#39;t imagine getting pickup<br/>
&gt; groups together as it really would take excellent team coordination, and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;d probably be best to have voice communications.<br/>

things :), with a multiplayer mode.  Folks here at work<br/>
usually play with the speaker phones in conference call mode.<br/>
It really does require good teamwork, and one person screwing<br/>
up usually results in everyone dying.<br/>
