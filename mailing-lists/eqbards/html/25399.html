Yes I deleted all no drop items before I deleted the character, so when<br/>
I deleted her she had 0 items/pp on her or in the bank.  If I did not<br/>
have my epic (everything else is easily replaced) I would not play her.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I want to bother trying heh.<br/>

ROFLMAO!  I thought that was what you meant by &quot;(guess it didn&#39;t work)&quot;.<br/>
Not sure, this guy was gone for over 3 months.  Did you actually destroy<br/>
all<br/>
your No Drop items before you deleted Shada?  If not, then I imagine he<br/>
would reappear with everything he had that was No Drop when you deleted<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I opened a can of worms for ya man.<br/>
