too I see?  :-)  My entire party went down that ledge (it&#39;s<br/>
more a ledge than a slope). Took a total of about 280-300<br/>
points damage each in three falls before we could stop.  <br/>
Worse than any of the yellow and red ice boned skeletons we&#39;d<br/>
been taking in South Ro.  Now I always cut parallel to a ridge<br/>
before going down, so I can peek to the side and see how steep<br/>
the drop is.  I am really looking forward to L24 and the safe<br/>
fall skill.<br/>

Another time in Lavastorm, someone I&#39;d just met and grouped<br/>
with had never run with a bard or SoW and went flying off a<br/>
peak into a pool of lava.  She got out with just a sliver of<br/>
red showing on her health bar.<br/>
