<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461437858"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hey, Harmonic!  I hear you have some Lambent Bracers?  (I didn&#39;t say I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t do it with my *primary* character, did I?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  How much you paying me for them?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  What&#39;s silly is when players come up to me and ask me about my Imbrued<br/>
  and then start offering like 100pp or 200pp for a piece.  Or how much<br/>
  for the Six Note Blade?  The other thing that really floors me is those<br/>
  people who insist on me letting them hold something of mine to &#39;try it<br/>
  out&#39;.  One guy inspected me, and asked me how much for the Cloak of <br/>
  Shadows I was wearing... jeez, hello, *knock knock* I&#39;m freakin using<br/>
  it... hello, anybody home??  hehe.  ah well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
