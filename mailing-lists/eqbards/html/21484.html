<br/>
My guild is discussing a possible guild war.  More of a friendly capture the<br/>
flag type limited format for fun rather than something more ominous.  To<br/>
prepare for it, I want to duel a few folks to learn what works best against<br/>
other player characters.  I am now a bard of 34 songs and have never dueled<br/>
- just not my thing.  Please share with me your experiences and advice on<br/>
how you have done it, how it could be done, what location best, etc.  Who<br/>
knows, one day someone might piss me off enough (or vice versa) to make me<br/>
duel them for real.  I want to be prepared.<br/>
<br/>
At times in the past, I have seen charm suggested as a viable tool, but I am<br/>
on a non PvP server(The Nameless) and I have heard you can&#39;t charm PC&#39;s<br/>
there - I plan to try tonight either way.  I also heard that PvP areas like<br/>
Arena might have different rules.  Can anyone comment on charm, pixie, fear,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
