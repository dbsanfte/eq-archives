<div id="ygrps-yiv-852347171">Yeah, been up on the giant spires too...that&#39;s an amazing view.  Learned<br/>
three things there one day:<br/>
1) it&#39;s about a 3.5 second fall...so enough time to drop Levitate and<br/>
restart it about 200 feet off of the ground.<br/>
2) don&#39;t try that over the pyramids (run away from the city to do<br/>
that)...the pyramids are a little higher then where lev will kick back in<br/>
:)<br/>
3) Cleric&#39;s can attempt to cast divine aura 3 times during the fall...she<br/>
made a big splat too :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Khelan - I can honestly say that I&#39;ve been in the exact same spot ;)  As a <br/>
&gt; Guide (on TM), I used the Guide Levitate and Spirit of Norrath to do <br/>
&gt; exactly what you just described.  Very entertaining ;)  My favourite <br/>
&gt; Levitate and Fall spot, however, is the gigantic wizard spires in the <br/>
&gt; Dreadlands.  For sheer entertainment value once, I jumped off the spires, <br/>
&gt; sat and camped while slowly drifting downwards.  When I logged in next, I <br/>
&gt; was still a long way up ;) </span></blockquote></div>
