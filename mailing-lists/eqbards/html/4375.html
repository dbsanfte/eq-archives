<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044849537">Actually the Dirk is better then a Well Balanced Rapier as well.  The WB <br/>
Rapier is 6 dam 23 delay, but no stat bonuses and wieghs over twice as much. <br/>
  Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>
considering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  The Dirk, IMO, is the most <br/>
unbalanced weapon in the game.  But that said they can have mine when they <br/>
pry it from my cold, dead fingers &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

&gt;Off topic just for your benefit.  Actually it is not that much off topic<br/>
&gt;since the bad is a rogue-type class and notorious for using dagger and<br/>
&gt;piercing weapons  (thats why bards have some thieving abilites).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Combine Longsword:  Damage 6,  28 delay,  hits magical creatures<br/>
&gt;Dragoon Dirk:  Damage 6,  23 delay, +2 dexterity, +3 magic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hands down Dirk is way better. </span></blockquote></div>
