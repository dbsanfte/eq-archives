it...they have been having a problem with this happening and are working on<br/>
a fix..the bard  causing the crash is laughable...If this happens to you<br/>
first petition and have everyone on the boat do so as well..the more the<br/>
quicker the response...I&#39;ve had this happen a few times and each time a gm<br/>
came and teled us all to our destination.</div>
