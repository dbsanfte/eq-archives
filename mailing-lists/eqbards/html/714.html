<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780603925">I applied points to get a Charisma of 100 and Dexterity of 95.  I think that<br/>
left me with Strength of 80, Agility of 75, Int 75 and Wis 75.  I did get beat<br/>
up a lot at lower levels until I got decent armor.  That and not seeing in the<br/>
dark is the downside.  The big upside is GREAT prices and excellent song<br/>
reliability.  I will never play a human again, but I am very happy with a high<br/>
charisma Bard.<br/>
<br/>
Side note on Charisma&#39;s effects on prices:  With a 100 Charisma I see about a<br/>
10% price difference on cheap things (under a plat) as compared to a Human with<br/>
75 charisma.  However, for expensive items (over 10 plat) I see as much as a 20%<br/>
difference in prices.  The bonus is clearly not linear.  I am anxious to see if<br/>
I will get a 30 or 40% bonus on items greater than 100 pp, but cashflow<br/>
constraints postpone the test for another day.  I am sure one of you<br/>
number-cruncher types will have some graphs or equations for us by the end of<br/>
the week&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
