<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962378558">Looks like the friends list is stored in the eqOptions1.opt file. Not sure<br/>
if you can edit out entries safely, or if you need to delete the file and<br/>
have EQ generate a new one on application start.<br/>

&gt; Is there anyway to delete your entire /friend list and start over?  I<br/>
typed<br/>
&gt; in /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t seen in a long<br/>
&gt; time.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed in addition to<br/>
&gt; players.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, or /groupsay<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; instead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the phrase I typed<br/>
&gt; to my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire list, there<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; a few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made numerous attempts<br/>
&gt; at removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces before I type<br/>
&gt; in any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my friend list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ directory this<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; delete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>
&gt; friends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
