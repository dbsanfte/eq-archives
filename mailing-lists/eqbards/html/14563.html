<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059762827">The other day I got a chance to do some limited testing.  Our guild went to<br/>
the arena for some fun free for all dueling.  While we were there, I tried<br/>
the &quot;new & improved&quot; version of Syvelian&#39;s anti-magic aria.  My test subject<br/>
had a bunch of buffs up and I targeted him and cast it. About 1 out of 3<br/>
tries, it would strip 1 buff.  He is lev 50 enchanter and I was lev 43 bard.<br/>
So, level difference probably has a strong impact on success rate and<br/>
amounts.  Also, he may have been buffed with GMR or what ever his Magic<br/>
Resist buff is. But even so, I was stripping buffs off a level 50.  Look<br/>
Lady Vox, next time I will strip your SoW~!!<br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s my story and I am sticking to it!<br/>
