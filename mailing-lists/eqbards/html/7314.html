<b>Subject:</b> another wild goose chase (quest related, not specifically bards) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571765458">Though I would throw something... ANYTHING out here to get us off bards and<br/>
melee:<br/>
<br/>
A GM last night on Veeshan dropped the hint that the blued two-handed<br/>
warhammer&#39;s quest involving turning in the 4 crystal staves to someone *was*<br/>
working (as opposed to the cries of &quot;its broken&quot; that near deafened me in<br/>
Najena a few nights ago)...<br/>
<br/>
So, we bards being the keepers of lore, does anyone know who exactly we turn<br/>
them in to?<br/>
<br/>
To the best of my knowledge the Slime Crystal Staff pop&#39;s on King Xrob in<br/>
the gorge, the Ice Crystal Staff comes from Permafrost (imagine that), but I<br/>
don&#39;t know on who, the Water Crystal Staff is on a named aqua goblin,<br/>
Webclaw, in Lake Rathe and the last one, the Fire Crystal Staff, I have no<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
I have a slime crystal staff right now just because I like the look even if<br/>
the proc is resisted far too often...  At any rate, this appears to be one<br/>
quest were the reward is worth the effort so I&#39;d like to do it before Verant<br/>
finds out and changes it to a Rusty Red Three-Handed Skirmish Stick. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
