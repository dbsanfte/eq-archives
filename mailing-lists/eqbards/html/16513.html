and you are party friendly.  If you made the chains decision with a ranger<br/>
or druid in a pick up group from my server and forget ever being invited on<br/>
a raid or dungeon crawl again.  Maybe here I&#39;m a bit spoiled also since my<br/>
guild is primarily shamans and slowing MOBs down usually only becomes my job<br/>
on super high magic resist mobs like Ogre Guards.  (Not worth the mana when<br/>
I can stick my song 50% of the time).  I also don&#39;t always have chains<br/>
loaded... even for backup.  A lot of times our method for dealing with<br/>
runners when snare fails these days is a BIG blast from our nuker and a BIG<br/>
dot from our shaman...  Haven&#39;t seen anything make it far after that.<br/>
Actually on the Efreeti Raid, that is why I was packing binding instead of<br/>
chains... Thanks god the other bard had chains :).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What level mobs are you fighting?  In my experience it is a rule, not<br/>
exception.  Anything above level 35 or so will tend to break chains at<br/>
random times and not last 3 ticks... ever.  My charisma is about 125 and<br/>
when buffed is about 160 something and my dex is usually buffed out over<br/>
200.  Do stats play a role here?  I still have chains wear off after the<br/>
first tick if not sooner fighting low blue greater kobolds in B!<br/>

&gt; didn&#39;t have both a snarer (usually a druid) and an attack speed debuffer<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No argument here.  Bards are great when the primary class isn&#39;t present.  We<br/>
seem to have a fantastic ability to fill in the holes of any party and at<br/>
least partially make up for any missing class.  When they are there and<br/>
capable, I always let them have first shot and use my songs as back up for<br/>
when they fail.  I too have grouped with my brother&#39;s druid since level 1<br/>
and have the nice added advantage of being in the same room so we don&#39;t even<br/>
have to coordinate via chat interface.  I also rarely end up in crowded<br/>
dungeons.  The list method on our server means that you can end up waiting 6<br/>
to 8 hours for a spot fighting ANYTHING in Guk, and the fact that I&#39;m almost<br/>
always playing with my wife&#39;s warrior and my brother&#39;s druid means that we<br/>
don&#39;t wait on lists since we need 3 spots, not one.  As a result, most of my<br/>
dungeon time is spent on organized raids of 2 or more groups going into<br/>
places like Sol B or Kedge Keep or doing crawls of places like Paw where it<br/>
still isn&#39;t that crowded.  In these scenarios chains tends not to be a<br/>
primary option.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To clarify:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chains is not the ONLY song I use in pulling.  It gives a great head-start<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guk is different and so is Sol B.  I can see using chains there as the<br/>
pathing problems are nearly as intense.... I still say that you are asking<br/>
for trouble with pixie, charm or chains in places like Paw or Sol A...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to see that a lot of our differences have more to do with what<br/>
and where we are fighting then how to use the song.  I don&#39;t tend to need<br/>
chains when fighting for XP because in the places I fight at for XP, we<br/>
don&#39;t care about runners.  Oggok bouncers, specs, giants, etc... you simply<br/>
don&#39;t need to stop these things as they really don&#39;t run far and if they do,<br/>
so what.   I don&#39;t think you would disagree with my assessment of chains on<br/>
things like Efreeti raids or dungeon crawls though :).<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, I&#39;ve always wondered what it would be like to fight for XP in lower<br/>
Guk... But I personally don&#39;t see myself having that chance anytime in the<br/>
near future.  Perhaps when the expansion comes out...  (well, one could<br/>
wish!)<br/>
