&gt; Well, I checked with the oasis gypsies and the shady Swashbuckler, and the <br/>
&gt; both consider me indifferently. As I stated before I have a CHA of 93, and <br/>
&gt; my deity is Quellious the Tranquil. The gypsies will sell me a combine long <br/>
&gt; sword for about 54.7 plat. The other day the Shady Swashbuckler was asking <br/>
&gt; 231 plat for a well-balanced long-sword. Last night he was asking 238.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dropped by the shady Swashbuckler again and his price on the<br/>
WB LS is 220.5 at 115pp chr, 223.681pp at 110.  I&#39;m starting<br/>
to think race or diety may also have something to do with all<br/>
this, and that there&#39;s a cap on how low a price can go.  <br/>
Since a combine LS sells for 47.5 and costs 52.5 (either to my<br/>
amiable guild merchant or to the indifferent gypsies), the<br/>
base price is probably 50pp and the limit is 95% and 105%<br/>
respectively (+/- 5%).  I still need to check my buying price<br/>
at the gypsies with the +5 chr, but if my theory is right, it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have changed.  The sell price at my guild for the<br/>
combine LS did not change.<br/>
