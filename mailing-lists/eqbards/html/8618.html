<div id="ygrps-yiv-288578386">Wasn&#39;t there a rumor a while back that mobs will sometimes target the<br/>
character with the highest charisma?  That could explain why bards get<br/>
attacked even when they aren&#39;t playing any songs at the start of a combat.<br/>
On numerous occasions my group&#39;s puller will bring back multiple mobs.  The<br/>
mob he initially attacked will attack the puller.  The mobs that follow<br/>
always seem to attack me first and not the puller.  I&#39;ve gotten used to it<br/>
and pretty much expect it to occur every time I fight.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I need to be centre of attention at all other times! &lt;cough&gt;<br/>

&gt; You will always be a &#39;Big Steak&#39; in the eyes of all monsters.<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t even need to be playing songs or swinging a blade,<br/>
&gt; for that matter.  I swear monster AI targets the bard in every<br/>
&gt; party, because they are the single biggest threat to the mob.<br/>
