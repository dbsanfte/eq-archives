&gt; I know for certain that the messages for both songs appeared, i.e. &quot;you feel<br/>
&gt; protected from cold&quot;.  Can&#39;t confirm if the mob was actually taking damage<br/>
&gt; from both of them though.  Its hard to track all the messages that scroll<br/>
&gt; through in a combat so when I got the confirmation that the song went into<br/>
&gt; affect, just assumed that the mob was getting burned/frozen.  Sure wish we<br/>
&gt; got the white text message for our damage shields similar to what you get<br/>
&gt; when you have the druid thorn buff (not certain of exact name).  With the<br/>
&gt; thorn buff, it tells you how much non-melee damage the mob took when they<br/>
&gt; hit you.  Anyone have an idea why we don&#39;t get a similar message?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You *do* get the same message.  If you weren&#39;t, I&#39;d take that<br/>
as a sign that they were canceling eaching other.<br/>
