<div id="ygrps-yiv-807737702"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;This is why I almost always have charm memorized - it is great<br/>

&gt;low on health is getting healed while the mob is charmed<br/>
&gt;(instead of standing around wondering why the mob stopped<br/>
&gt;attacking, and then deciding to take advantage of the pause by<br/>
&gt;trying to hit it with a few spells to finish it off).<br/>
&gt;Otherwise when the mob becomes uncharmed, it&#39;ll look around,<br/>
&gt;see this almost-dead guy, and decide to off him first.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really? I thought they pretty much always attacked their charmer. But<br/>
perhaps the smell of a kill might frenzy them more.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen an enchanter charm a werebat. and then the enchanter left him at<br/>
that spot and ran away. And we all stood around the werebat targeting it for<br/>
when it woke up... and when it did we all attacked it instantly. And WHILE<br/>
we were plummeling it, it RAN around like crazy until it fount that<br/>
enchanter, and proceeded to lay the smack down on him. (Of course, being a<br/>
good enchanter he just stood there twiddling his thumbs, and very soon we<br/>
got the bat off him :)<br/>
