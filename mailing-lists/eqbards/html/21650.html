<br/>
I did a 15-hour Hate raid last Saturday.  Had a great time - but only one<br/>
Bard Item dropped (Imbrued Arms) and I lost the lotto (to only one other<br/>
bard).  I did win the lotto for a Diamond that has been going for 1-1.5K on<br/>
my server these days.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to keep in mind about Hate - the only way out is to TP.  It&#39;s a<br/>
good time to find a Cazic-Thule Gate potion in case you need to go when no<br/>
Druids or Wizards want to TP out...<br/>

there ya go you&#39;re all set 8)<br/>
<br/>
My guild spent a couple days in hate last week and i know the rogues got<br/>
decked out pretty good, i am not sure what else but i do know there was only<br/>
1 shaman up there and he got his bp, and my other shaman friend that needed<br/>
one was logged out up there and none had his pwd to log in to loot the one<br/>
that rotted away. What else, i think the only bard that was up there went LD<br/>
and a bp rotted away because she could not get back on, i do not know if she<br/>
was able to loot the other 2 that dropped, i hope for her sake.  Other then<br/>
that, we&#39;re only 3 bards in guild, and 1 of those is an alt which got decked<br/>
out completely second last trip up.<br/>
<br/>
Im just tryin to encourage ya 8)  I cant wait to go up. A friend said he&#39;d<br/>
help me level up once he got to lev 60, he&#39;s 2 bubbles away, i cant wait<br/>
