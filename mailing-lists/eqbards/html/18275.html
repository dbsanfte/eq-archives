<div id="ygrps-yiv-282944270">I dont know that this will work for a cleric. (but i<br/>
will be finding out soon. :)<br/>
Me . lvl 28 bard and a lvl 21 druid took a lvl 12<br/>
warrior to the raider camp in s karana (just south of<br/>
the stone bridge)  In right around two hours we got 7<br/>
bubbles of xp for him. (we quit then because the goal<br/>
was one bubble into 14, to match the rest of the<br/>
group).  The camp should be good I think about lvl 9<br/>
or 10 to 15.  I would lullaby the camp and he would<br/>
pick one (casters first) and whack it. The druid was<br/>
for invigor(lvl 9 clr spell) cast regularly and<br/>
healing which was rarely needed(troll warrior). A<br/>
cleric could do for this for  themselves but would<br/>
then require stops for mana regen.  Sometimes id be<br/>
ambitious and pull singles, but mostly I just counted<br/>
on lullaby and twisted in healing every once in a<br/>
while.<br/>
