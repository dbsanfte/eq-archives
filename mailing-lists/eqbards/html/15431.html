<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300136534">Not solo, but the top of the pyramid in Cazic would be good at 35 with<br/>
a good group.. Nonstop high level lizards. The entrance to lower guk<br/>
live side would be good too. Frogs on either side of the zone line would<br/>
give good exp. Even the top of Sol B by the Sol A zone would be good but<br/>
I&#39;d hold off on Sol B until you have to go there, you&#39;ll be tired of it<br/>
soon enough.<br/>

&gt; Was wondering if there is a good place for me to solo at 35th level?  Spent<br/>
&gt; four hours in Sol A last night in a party and killed a ton of blue goblins.<br/>
&gt; I got maybe 3/4 bar of EXP.  The camp was safe but actually pretty boring.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m willing to take a risk soloing if it will help me get out of 35th.   I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; thinking about the only place for me to solo at 35 is Rathe Mtns charming<br/>
&gt; giants against one another.  Anyone got a better suggestion.  Would it just<br/>
&gt; be better to join a group in one of the dungeons or kill ogre bouncers?<br/>
