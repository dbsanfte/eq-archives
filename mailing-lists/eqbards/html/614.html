 </span></blockquote>I think it depends on your connection latency (the upper-left<br/>
number on the lag meter is your ping time in ms).  I usually<br/>
get 115-130ms over a cable modem, and am just shy of being<br/>
able to keep 4 songs going (4th song effect expires an instant<br/>
before it comes back).  Usually I keep three running.  A<br/>
friend playing over a modem can, like you,k do two reliably,<br/>
but not three.<br/>
<br/>
I usually go with restoration, the anthem, and bellow, to<br/>
minimize downtime between fights.  If I&#39;m soloing, I&#39;ll<br/>
substitute the whistling warsong for the anthem since it also<br/>
boosts your AC.  I only get 33% of the bellows, but you get<br/>
the other two effects 100% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, despite my good connection, I don&#39;t particularly like<br/>
that an external factor like connection speed could have this<br/>
sort of impact on the game.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The increased speed<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has anybody figured out exactly what it is increased str does?<br/>
And as I said yesterday, the speed boost for both the anthem<br/>
and the whistling warsong do not stack, so there&#39;s less of a<br/>
reason to use both together.  (Would be interested if others<br/>
find differently)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And the extra 7<br/>
&gt; adds up (although I counted and averaged, and not including resists,<br/>
&gt; against blues, I was averaging 4-5 for a total of about 40 extra damage any<br/>
&gt; combat).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found the bellow is rarely resisted.  So when a monster<br/>
starts to flee, I will usually drop the other songs and use<br/>
bellow repeatedly to kill it quick before it wanders into<br/>
dangerous territory or brings back friends.  This should<br/>
become moot though when I get the root song (level<br/>
twenty-something), or if a spellcaster in the party can root.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s why I really like playing the bard.  Every<br/>
level, you have to reassess your capabilities, reprioritize<br/>
which songs to play, and modify your fighting strategies.  <br/>
With the fighting classes, you only do this every time you get<br/>
a new skill.  With spellcasting classes, you only get new<br/>
spells every 4 or 5 levels.  (Lullaby, L15, is awesome by the<br/>
way.  I&#39;ve already saved three groups that were being<br/>
overwhelmed by multiple monsters.  Just fire up the song and<br/>
put the ones they aren&#39;t fighting to sleep.)<br/>
