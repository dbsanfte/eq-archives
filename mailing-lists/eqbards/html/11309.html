&gt; I saw a Erudite banking peacefully in Felwithe, and fire off his guise<br/>
&gt; (showing off or by accident) and the pair of bankers promptly destroyed<br/>
&gt; him. I&#39;ve never seen a L50 die that fast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not sure why this happened, but I don&#39;t believe his Felwithe faction was<br/>
&gt; abnormally low. Anyone else know?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was concerned that when in dark elf form I would be attacked by the<br/>
&gt; guards<br/>
&gt; &gt; and inhabitants of the good aligned cities I am normally looked upon<br/>
&gt; kindly<br/>
&gt; &gt; or warmly by, but this is not the case.  Apparently you keep all your<br/>
&gt; &gt; faction adjustments while under the dark elf illusion of the guise.<br/>
