 </span></blockquote>Nope, it&#39;s not a party protect song, it is an aggressive song that<br/>
effects mobs. It just doesnt appear to do anything. I think the<br/>
Disenchanting Melody is supposed to do what you suggest, but my testing<br/>
with it suggested it didn&#39;t do anything either. Maybe it only breaks<br/>
enchantments like charm. It doesn&#39;t break root, I know that from<br/>
testing. And with only 6 spell slots available, I&#39;ve found it more<br/>
useful to keep charm memorized. If one of your party get&#39;s charmed,<br/>
charm them back. Charm can also be useful in those rare places where the<br/>
Bard is not automatically at the top of every mob&#39;s hate list. There,<br/>
the cleric seems to top the list after casting the first heal, and<br/>
nothing I could do would distract a mob from beating on him, except<br/>
charm. And once the charm wears off you can be sure you are on top of<br/>
the mob&#39;s hate list. <br/>
