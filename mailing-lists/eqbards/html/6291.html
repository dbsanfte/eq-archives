<b>Subject:</b> When and why I Kabong! threads <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-731896565">Alright, alright - enough jokes about me and my Kabong! ;)<br/>
I thought I would clarify when and why I Kabong! threads.  It&#39;s really<br/>
quite simple:  Anytime the thread skews completely away from Bards and/or<br/>
threatens to become (or has already become) inflammatory, I request that we<br/>
stop discussing it (which is all the Kabong! is - I&#39;m not going to<br/>
unsubscribe someone because they responded to a Kabong!ed thread).  The<br/>
last thread I Kabong!ed primarily because I&#39;ve seen that same thread<br/>
degenerate over and over into a campers/twinkers suck/you suck/no you suck<br/>
flame war, and since the topic really wasn&#39;t Bard-specific, it seemed<br/>
appropriate to Kabong! before we had our own li&#39;l weenie roast.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only human, and I&#39;m not a fascist dictator - if I make a decision you<br/>
don&#39;t like, tell me about it.  Tell me that you want to discuss this topic,<br/>
or get some input from the group.  As long as we don&#39;t start flinging<br/>
insults, I&#39;m a happy camper ;)  Erm.. twinker... erm... nevermind.<br/>

P.S. For those of you who may not be aware, our original forum moderator<br/>
and creator, Toren, has left the list.  I am in the process of acquiring<br/>
full moderator status on it.  We have 380+ members right now, and I&#39;d<br/>
certainly like to see us continue to grow.  We also have 5MB of space for<br/>
uploading Bard-related files, if anyone needs to. (didn&#39;t someone have a<br/>
song compilation?)</div>
