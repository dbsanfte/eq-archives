<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735236014"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I dunno about that, seems unlikely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a rather heated debate online over the weekend with some arrogant<br/>
&gt;player on E&#39;ci (forget the name because I was too flamed) who started the<br/>
&gt;&quot;debate&quot; by sending me a private tell that I was the worst bard to ever <br/>
&gt;play<br/>
&gt;the game because I was not singing Jaxon&#39;s Jig between fights to increase<br/>
&gt;manna regen.  He then got my group started in on it (I was the group <br/>
&gt;leader)<br/>
&gt;and everyone was against me claiming I should sing the song and that it<br/>
&gt;works especially well for manna regen when using the Mistmoore drum (which <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;do not have by the way).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I tried to explain the myth to them but no one wanted to hear about it and<br/>
&gt;this guy just kept saying he &quot;hates to see someone play the character class<br/>
&gt;so poorly&quot;.  Well I got totally ticked off and lost my temper and started<br/>
&gt;cussing like crazy at him (in private tell) to which he responded he would<br/>
&gt;get his bard character and meet me and kick my A** all over highkeep, to<br/>
&gt;which I brilliantly responded &quot;kiss my a** you stupid fu**er&quot; (I know, real<br/>
&gt;intelligent).  He said he was going to tell two of my party members <br/>
&gt;(friends<br/>
&gt;of his) to leave my group so I decided forget this (was now shaking in rage<br/>
&gt;and very insulted by this guy) so I disbanded my group, apologized to the<br/>
&gt;nice people in it, and logged out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish I could remember this guy&#39;s name so I could post it here but as I<br/>
&gt;said I was seeing red at the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My point is that there are tons of lies and falsehoods about our abilities<br/>
&gt;that trolls and generally uninformed people love to spread for some reason<br/>
&gt;or another.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes it seems unlikely, and I do not completely trust the guy who broadcast <br/>
this over guildchat. However, your situation is a little different because <br/>
there is no hard number to look at while testing Jig vs Mana Regen, and <br/>
sometimes mana status bars can appear slower or faster due to lag of one <br/>
kind or another. This guy is claiming an exact number of hp healed by Hymn + <br/>
Gypsy Lute (45 at 46th level), and I won&#39;t bother to slam him for false info <br/>
until I know wether or not it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I do recall a post by J.M. Capozzi months ago on the Jig vs mana <br/>
regen debate, and he stated that rumor as myth. I don&#39;t mind believing him, <br/>
especially since mana song is a DEFINITE.<br/>
