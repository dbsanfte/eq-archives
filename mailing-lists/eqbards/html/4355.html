<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418686646">This isn&#39;t just a bard only problem, try being in a group and having a mag<br/>
outzap your entire group like that, very irritating.<br/>
<br/>
Verant is well aware of this problem, I think they are just not sure how to<br/>
combat it.<br/>
<br/>
The best solution I&#39;ve seen proposed so far, is having total group damage<br/>
count against who gets the kill. Of course, a group of mages could team up,<br/>
but kill stealers like this tend to be loners - getting a group of higher<br/>
level ones together to accomplish this would be a lot harder to do.<br/>
<br/>
As it works now - whoever gets the most damage in, gets the kill.  If you<br/>
happen to be in a group, it extends to your group.<br/>
<br/>
There is no &#39;good&#39; answer to this, as any possible solutions present their<br/>
own brand of problems.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get high enough to charm - that IS something a bard can do, charm<br/>
the mob - the caster wastes his manna, mob goes uncharmed, proceed to kill.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s truly a pity that some folks had such poor home training that they<br/>
feel justified acting in such an antisocial manner in &#39;a game&#39;. I usually<br/>
try to talk to them, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. When it<br/>
doesn&#39;t - this type also has a nasty habit of proceeding into actions that<br/>
can quite reasonably be considered harrassment - THAT the GMs CAN do<br/>
something about, and if it happens, I have no problem whatsoever reporting<br/>
them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;And on a different subject and trying to keep it Bard related: What can a<br/>
&gt;bard do (if anything) when he/she is being constantly robbed of his/her<br/>
&gt;kills by magic users? For example.. I&#39;m sitting on the training hill in<br/>
&gt;Crushbone just wailing away having a good ol&#39; time - nobody else is up there<br/>
&gt;(that I can see) and I&#39;m just plugging away at Centurions.. Lo&#39; and behold<br/>
&gt;the Trainer spawns.. I start whacking away at him thinking great, real<br/>
&gt;experience now - and *zap* *bang* *boosh* and the trainer is running to a<br/>
&gt;magic user that was hiding himself over the edge of the hill. Aparently (now<br/>
&gt;I know) the Trainer carries the Shiney Brass Shield sometimes.. I mutter my<br/>
&gt;profanities and the other person leaves (so I thought). Same thing happens<br/>
&gt;again.. And again.. I finally get sick of it and leave the hill. Is there<br/>
&gt;nothing that as a Bard we can do to prevent this sort of thing? I mean, I<br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t camping for the shield (didnt even really know about it at first) but<br/>
&gt;my kills were being stolen. I&#39;ve camped before and gladly take turns with<br/>
&gt;any other groups that are present - but it&#39;s really annoying that there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;such rampant stealing like this and nothing that can be done about it. Whine<br/>
&gt;to Verrant? I doubt they&#39;d do anything.. Duel the caster? Bah, he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;accept. And neither of us were PvP&#39;s. Are we as Bard&#39;s just stuck to the<br/>
&gt;whims of Magic users?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I won&#39;t even get into the massive and unbelievable amount of KS&#39;ing on the<br/>
&gt;new Brell Serillis server.. keeeeripes man. 100 people outside of Felwithe<br/>
&gt;going after the same MOB&#39;s.. I gave up on that server quickly.<br/>
