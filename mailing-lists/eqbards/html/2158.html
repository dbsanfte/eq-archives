<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341357823">Was that this week?  I&#39;ve been on the boat a couple times in the last week,<br/>
since the last patch.  People still disappeared and it appeared as though I<br/>
still wasn&#39;t able to /say anything that anyone could hear.  But, my stam was<br/>
now left alone, and I felt less nervous on the trip.<br/>
