<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016266590">Maybe this is the same as the experience bar at level 50+.  When you hit 50,<br/>
the bar keeps moving, but when it &quot;should&quot; ding into 51 it doesn&#39;t, it just<br/>
keeps invisibly moving out to the right.  I&#39;ve spoken with guys at level<br/>
&quot;51+&quot; that said that when they die in Hate or Fear they don&#39;t have their bar<br/>
drop due to this invisible buffer.  It kinda makes sense that faction works<br/>
this way too, both in the positive and negative directions.  i.e. you bottom<br/>
your faction out and stop receiving messages, but the faction in actuality<br/>
keeps getting worse numerically.  Therefore when you start to improve your<br/>
faction you don&#39;t actually recieve improvement messages until the faction<br/>
&#39;bar&#39; starts moving.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Things have changed (bug or nerf or just me?) but killing<br/>
&gt; gnolls only lowers<br/>
&gt; &gt; my gnoll faction - but then someone pointed out that my other<br/>
&gt; factions maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; maxxed out and that is why I no longer see any raises for the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; factions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   There is not a one to one matching for faction adjustments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   For example (and I have tested this):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Kill corrupt guard McCluskey, always lowers corruptqeynosguards.<br/>
&gt;   And I&#39;ve killed him more than 300 or 400 times, easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Killed Guard Justyn, raises corruptqeynosguards, lowers qeynosguards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Kill McCluskey again _does not_ raise qeynosguards back up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You cannot just beat the crap out of McCluskey and expect to<br/>
&gt;   get your faction back with Justyn.  At one point it started<br/>
&gt;   to work, but when you max out (theorectically) in one direction<br/>
&gt;   the opposite doesn&#39;t affect it.  I say theorectically because<br/>
&gt;   my faction still says it is lowering with corruptguards, yet<br/>
&gt;   I know for certain it&#39;s completely max&#39;d out at the low end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You can try this with Gnolls too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Do something that pisses off the MerchantofQeynos (with a completely<br/>
&gt;   max&#39;d out high favor with them) and then kill a Gnoll, you will not<br/>
&gt;   redeem positive merchant faction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Not sure why this is, but it happens to all factions when they are<br/>
&gt;   at the most imbalanced status.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>
