<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024869259">Although I have no empirical evidence to back it up, I would imagine that<br/>
Verant will continue to tweak the difficultly of mobs as the average<br/>
character level on each server increases.  Granted there will always be low<br/>
level characters on every server, but over time the average character level<br/>
will increase.  This could be Verant&#39;s method to help prevent overcrowding<br/>
by ensuring there are enough creatures around to give experience.  Just a<br/>
speculation on my part.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing to consider, when a creature spawns, there are a range of<br/>
levels they could be.  Last night I was camping the pirate captain in the<br/>
OOT who drops the Bracer of Erollisi.  The first time he spawned he conned<br/>
dark blue to me (21 bard).  The second time he spawned, he was black to me<br/>
(same level).  The third time he spawned he was yellow.  This could have<br/>
been what happened to you in Steamfont with the skeletons.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This may seem like superstition on my part but the goblin wizards in<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock seemed to have been given a boost in their nastiness. I was<br/>
&gt; soloing these guys at lvl 12 without losing more than two bubbles of<br/>
&gt; damage,<br/>
&gt; then recently at level 13 I hit a few once more and almost died a few<br/>
&gt; times.<br/>
&gt; I know that things that con the same can vary in potency but this is a big<br/>
&gt; difference. I&#39;ve also noticed this with the skeletons outside of the<br/>
&gt; Minotaur Cave in Steamfront, which helped me make my 12th level and turned<br/>
&gt; promptly to conning green, only to return to blue now at 14th level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone else see similar things like this happening?<br/>
