&gt; Hmm, does this mean my cleric friend (who picked up a gypsy<br/>
&gt; lute when I wasn&#39;t there) could give the lute to the NPC, and<br/>
&gt; I could give the NPC the carapace and ruby lambent, and I<br/>
&gt; would get the breastplate?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do I really want to try this experiment considering it took me<br/>
&gt; 3 days to get that damn carapace?  Anyone know of a similar,<br/>
&gt; easier quest we could test this theory on first?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I have a good low-risk way to test this.  I will have<br/>
to get myself a gypsy lute.  The cleric will give her lute to<br/>
the NPC, and I will give the other items.  If no breastplate,<br/>
I will give my lute to get the BP.  If I do get a breastplate,<br/>
I won&#39;t have to make a return trip to MM to get another lute<br/>
for general use (+5 magic resist).<br/>
<br/>
I may still test it with the Millers though, just to reassure<br/>
myself that this actually has a chance of working.<br/>
