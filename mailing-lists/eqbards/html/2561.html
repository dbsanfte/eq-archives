<b>Subject:</b> was RE: [eqbards] EQ slang now exploiting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610134199">I have to say that I sympathize somewhat<br/>
with Mr. Satan from AOL. I am still on this<br/>
list but my level 26 bard languishes. I have<br/>
found I need a game that I can have some fun<br/>
in for 40 minutes and then turn it off if<br/>
need be. EQ is an awesome, incredible game,<br/>
but if you are even a little power hungry<br/>
like I am it can become insanely demanding<br/>
on your time. I can distinctly recall when<br/>
games that offered 100 hours of potential<br/>
adventuring were considered great in terms<br/>
of entertainment value for the dollar. EQ offers<br/>
at least a thousand hours (if you consider<br/>
getting 50th an endpoint/goal), and for me<br/>
it&#39;s just too damn much. Figure that you<br/>
spend about 2,000 hours a year working for<br/>
a living at 40 hour work weeks and you begin<br/>
to see the ridiculously slow pace EQ has.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I would love to get level 50,<br/>
slay every monster several times (not 300), and<br/>
have a lot of fun. The problem is I can&#39;t devote<br/>
my life to eq, and if there was a way to cheat<br/>
in order to accelerate my adventures/progress<br/>
through the game, I would find it tempting to<br/>
use.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, keep up the interesting messages -<br/>
I am now experiencing eq vicariously<br/>
through your stories.<br/>

&gt;  Well hot damn, that means when I get lung cancer from smoking all these<br/>
&gt; years that I can sue the people who made them! It&#39;s not MY fault that I<br/>
&gt; bought them in the store, not my fault I lit a bunch of crushed up plants<br/>
&gt; held together with chemically treated paper, which the paper is held round<br/>
&gt; with glue, then stuck the fiberglass type material in my mouth and sucked<br/>
&gt; on it while the opposite end was glowing red. Woohoo, using SaTaN, ahem,<br/>
&gt; excuse me, s8n&#39;s, logic, I&#39;m bound to be a millionaire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  OR<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  when you grow up you&#39;ll be able to tell the difference between right and<br/>
&gt; wrong, between knowing what&#39;s the correct course of actions<br/>
&gt; without someone<br/>
&gt; telling you what they are. Or maybe some other kid wanting to blame<br/>
&gt; everyone else for thier bullshit will shoot you (so they can be as cool as<br/>
&gt; the &quot;gangsta&#39;s&quot;) and your parents can sue the company that made the gun.<br/>
&gt; (since it won&#39;t be the kid who pulled the trigger&#39;s fault, no need to even<br/>
&gt; put him in jail)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t want to be specific about locations but there are<br/>
&gt; certain creatures<br/>
&gt; &gt;who get caught in walls when you lure them there and then you can slowly,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt;surely, bellow them to death.  I haven&#39;t done it as much as I wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt;because it isn&#39;t worth it anymore as the creatures in question<br/>
&gt; are mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt;blue to me now but imagine how happy I&#39;d have been to have found<br/>
&gt; this spot<br/>
&gt; &gt;when they were all red.  My point really is--hold on to your helms,<br/>
&gt; &gt;RPers--who cares how you get your levels as long as you get them<br/>
&gt; and get on<br/>
&gt; &gt;to the getting of the cool stuff so you can whip Lord Mistmore?  Oh the<br/>
&gt; &gt;dismay and anger the purple people showered me with as they watched me<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;cheat&quot;.  Far as I am concerned, playing honorably with an object like a<br/>
&gt; &gt;computer game is just plain silly.  If the bug wasn&#39;t there I *couldn&#39;t*<br/>
&gt; &gt;exploit it so therefore it is Verant&#39;s fault, not mine, that<br/>
&gt; I--or anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;else for that matter--can use it.  It isn&#39;t cheating.  It is<br/>
&gt; using your head<br/>
&gt; &gt;to take advantage of an opportunity granted, intentional or otherwise.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bottom line: RPers, generally, are exactly as Shanda said--a<br/>
&gt; bunch of wacko<br/>
&gt; &gt;powermad control mongers who chastise and harrass<br/>
&gt; &quot;normal&quot;--stress the word<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;normal&quot;--people.  They are like the Bob Barrs of Everquest.<br/>
&gt; Play how they<br/>
&gt; &gt;want you to play or they will contact a GM(the granddaddies and<br/>
&gt; epitomy of<br/>
&gt; &gt;powermad RPers)and bring legislation against you.  This is the only<br/>
&gt; problem I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have ever found with an otherwise outstanding game.  Purple<br/>
&gt; people mind your<br/>
&gt; &gt;own freakin&#39; business and quit whining to the GMs every time you<br/>
&gt; see someone<br/>
&gt; &gt;playing the way your dork ass wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
