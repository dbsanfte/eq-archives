<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910047815">Hallaluia Baby !!! Last night made level 28 and ran right out to play<br/>
with my new charm song.<br/>
  I mean visions of Sand Giants dropping at my feet ! Now Moonflower<br/>
Bllue on Cazic-Thule is no fool. You don&#39;t get to level 28 without<br/>
learning something and not only that she has been reading this list<br/>
since nearly the beginning and even formulated it into her text for<br/>
beginning Bard&#39;s, &quot;Guns and Roses&quot;. But this time James, John Gregg and<br/>
the boys have not come through. You left out the critical information on<br/>
key board set up. Moon decided to practice with Lesser Fey Orcs and<br/>
spiders. Hot Keys on the Number pad bottom row read &quot;pet attack&quot;, &quot;Pet<br/>
guard me&quot; and &quot;Pet back off&quot;, the second row was #4 Charm, #5 Selos and<br/>
#6 ...&quot;Train Coming&quot; I think.<br/>
  F1,F1 to call up pet and Num Lock to auto run and mouse to steer.<br/>
<br/>
 She practiced and practiced. She found usually Charm would last 2 to 3<br/>
rounds , some times 4 but hunting and pecking , hands crossing... I mean<br/>
if they had been Sand Giants she be level 27 in a heart beat. <br/>
Getting a pet is no problem. Praying you bogus &quot;Sand Giant&quot; AKA Orc<br/>
Centurion at your side keeps his cool while you fumble with targeting<br/>
another SG Cent ( the target SG is lost because your on auto run getting<br/>
the first SG as a pet) &quot;aim, click, keypad 1, F1,F1 OUCH !!! sucker hit<br/>
me !! ,aim, click, Charm, charm, aim, click on target, key pad 1 attack,<br/>
f1, f1, Charm... &quot;hummm, why isn&#39;t pet attacking ?&quot;... ok, Pet guard me.<br/>
Run near target... whooooaa, forgot to turn on Selos !!! OUCH OUCH OUCH<br/>
!!! Thank heavens they are green Cents ! What the !!! 2 bubbles gone ?<br/>
Target Cent has a name ? Chief !!!... Run song...<br/>
<br/>
   And so it goes.<br/>
   It would be really instructive if one of you gentlemen could take me<br/>
and other readers on a walk thru as above on what keys and what you do<br/>
to make use Charm successful. It is the most difficult task Moonflower<br/>
has met yet.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks</div>
