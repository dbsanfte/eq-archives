<div id="ygrps-yiv-830861672">My shaman friend cast Spirit of Snake on me, bumping my CHA from 85 to 100,<br/>
and I was able to buy a well balanced rapier for 233 plat when it would have<br/>
cost me 248 without.<br/>
<br/>
	In Beta I did the same thing. I think I dropped 5 into strength and the<br/>
rest into charisma. For final I put the same in strength and dumped the rest<br/>
into dexterity. I feel that it has been way easier for me in final but I<br/>
can&#39;t say if it is because of the difference in stats or the fact that I<br/>
knew more about how things work in final.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

&gt; Not true, shamans have some very nice Charisma buffs starting at level 14.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had similar results with charisma buffs though?  I<br/>
plan on bugging my shaman and enchanter friends some time this<br/>
week to test it.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a silly decision to max<br/>
my charisma with bonus points so I could RP the charming bard.<br/>
:-)<br/>
