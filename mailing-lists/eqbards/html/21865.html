&gt; &gt; &gt;And what good is STR on the earlier songs anyway? All the player studies<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;ve seen, which have been just as thorough as the work John Kim used to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;do, show 50 str adds about 0.03% dmg over the long term. That&#39;s about as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;impressive as a 2pt dmg sheild at L30.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ah, then why the heck are all the tanks going for STR stuff? Are they all<br/>
&gt; &gt; misguided? /shrug<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Basically, yes. Just like criticals, STR adds to eye candy. A tank<br/>
&gt;watching his hits will see an occasional bigger than usual number. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;met lots of tanks who will argue until they are blue in the face that<br/>
&gt;their damage really is higher with a STR buff, dispite never once having<br/>
&gt;actually turned their logging on and tested it with one of the log<br/>
&gt;analysers out there. I&#39;ve been leveling a warrior up when I&#39;m too burned<br/>
&gt;out on the 55+ exp grind and I&#39;ve found criticals, dispite the<br/>
&gt;impressive numbers, account for about 3% of all hits, regardless of<br/>
&gt;buffs. I haven&#39;t spent the time to do exhaustive testing on STR because<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve already seen two well done studies that have me convinced. One of<br/>
&gt;those studies was also the first to really show the &quot;magic&quot; number bonus<br/>
&gt;that made the moss covered twig so out of balance, something even Verant<br/>
&gt;was appearantly unaware of.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, the love of statistics. Well in pick-up groups, perception is a factor <br/>
of whether they&#39;ll invite you or not. Reminds me of all the &quot;sing the jig&quot; <br/>
requests that I used to get so long ago. :-P<br/>
