<div id="ygrps-yiv-275765725">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
There seemed to be some confusion this weekend about Medium Bronze Armor on the<br/>
list.  I thought i would post up here all the locations that i know where<br/>
MEDIUM bronze drops.  It is more difficult to get than small (as the unrest<br/>
baddies seem to drop it by the truckload) or large (because you get a piece of<br/>
Lg Bronze EVERY time you kill the ogre capt. in najena without fail)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that MOST bards NEED Medium (i play a Half-Elf, because i think<br/>
they look the best)<br/>
<br/>
Medium Bronze, as people mentioned drops in Sol B (which would keep it away<br/>
from us until a very high level)<br/>
But, it also drops in Sol A (where noone ever goes on my server) <br/>
It drops in Permafrost (a group of low 20&#39;s can get some, while it is not a<br/>
common drop, it is possible to get it)<br/>
<br/>
There might be other places...but i am not sure.  Sol A and perma are tuned<br/>
(the beginning parts) for roughly the same level range as Unrest, so Medium<br/>
SHOULD BE just as easy to acquire as Small.  However, the fact that Unrest (on<br/>
Prexus) has a million people in it all the time makes it safer than going into<br/>
sol a and being the only people there.<br/>
<br/>
I got my Med Bronze breastplate from Perma, however i did buy the Hat (ick) and<br/>
Legs, because i am too much of a not-camper to sit in a dungeon that long.<br/>
-----<br/>
To add to the stuff about what to wear, i think that (based on stats) the only<br/>
Bronze worth wearing are the 3 pieces listed above.  All the other pieces are<br/>
just 1 point better than Banded (i think) and REALLY HEAVY.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
