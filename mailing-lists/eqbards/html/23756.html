<div id="ygrps-yiv-844957572">The AC number you see on your screen is not the number the game uses for<br/>
combat.  It is a composite number made up of two parts.  One part is Hit<br/>
Avoidance, this effects how often you are actually hit.  The other is Damage<br/>
Mitigation, this effects how much damage you take when you get hit.<br/>
<br/>
Attack works the same way.  It is made up of a To Hit portion and a Damage<br/>
portion.  The numbers were both shown in beta for awhile, but where taken<br/>
out because they were &#39;to confusing&#39; and replace with the misleading<br/>
composite numbers we see today.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t really know how bard songs work with respect to AC, <br/>
&gt; as my bard is only level 23 currently, but keep in mind that <br/>
&gt; there is &quot;raw&quot; AC and &quot;calculated&quot; AC.  Take off a piece of <br/>
&gt; armor with 10 AC and no agi bonuses and you might like 20+ <br/>
&gt; AC.  So if I reduces your &quot;raw&quot; AC by 16, that could be a <br/>
&gt; large &quot;calculated&quot; AC decrease.  Again, I have no idea if <br/>
&gt; this is how this works.<br/>
