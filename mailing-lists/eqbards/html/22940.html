<div id="ygrps-yiv-282124258">heh heh, twice.  Both times I let friends convince me to come back.  I must<br/>
say though if there were any other mmorpg&#39;s out there currently with bards I<br/>
would likely quit and at least try the other game.  Not saying I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
come back, but it wouldn&#39;t be hard at this point to lure me away given the<br/>
immense frustration VI has built up in me over the last year.<br/>

So did you cancel your account? *grin*<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still happy with my choice, though.  The day I stop playing my Bard is<br/>
the day I stop playing EQ.<br/>
