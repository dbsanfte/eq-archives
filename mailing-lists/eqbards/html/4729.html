 </span></blockquote>A friend of mine died in the Karana&#39;s, spawned back in Halas and proceeded<br/>
to go through the Blackburrow tunnel on his way back and noticed his corpse<br/>
in Blackburrow. Puzzled, he looted it and got all of his items back. He then<br/>
continued on his way to the Karana&#39;s to meet back up with his friends.<br/>
Suddenly he saw his corpse where he had actually died. Puzzled again he went<br/>
to loot it. Everything was there. Again. Now he has two of everything he<br/>
previously had. (He had no Lore items).<br/>
<br/>
Wonder how many people got something nice like that. Seems that this latest<br/>
patch broke more things than it fixed. Last night it was raining, but there<br/>
was no rain. I haven&#39;t seen a Sand Giant in Ro or the Oasis all weekend.<br/>
There was a pack of no less than 30 Deep Water Goblin pets running around<br/>
with a Deep Water Goblin around the Oasis beaches and hills. You&#39;d think<br/>
that Deepwater Goblin pets would stay in the Oasis lake with their masters;<br/>
but they&#39;ve been running around the desert in the Oasis all weekend. Most<br/>
annoying since there&#39;s no way in Norrath I&#39;m going to use an AE (Area<br/>
Effect) song with the risk of hitting one of those nasties.</div>
