<div id="ygrps-yiv-93775244"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok, for those who missed the last post, I am a level 7, almost 8 bard.<br/>
&gt;Right now I am using a regular Long Sword.  Not too dramatic..:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know I get dual wield at 17, and that sounds nice but I was wondering<br/>
&gt;what it maxes out at and if its better to get dual wield for 2 1h slashers<br/>
&gt;or to invest in a 2h slasher like a bibs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello!<br/>
Well, you can arm a 2H slash but your skill will never go above 0...so<br/>
probably not a good idea *grin*<br/>
 I think the weapons you might want to be looking for now are a Mino Axe<br/>
and/or a Dragoon Dirk. Mino Axes should be 3-5pp and are great weapons at<br/>
your age. Dragoon dirks go as low as 20pp and have better overall stats than<br/>
a Combine Longsword. At 26 I still use mine and even when I upgrade will<br/>
keep it in my throwing weapon slot just for the bonuses. Make sure you<br/>
practice your 1H slashing and piercing as well, the combo of the two works<br/>
great once you get Dual Weild. Once you hit high teens start thinking about<br/>
getting a Polished Granite Tomahawk from Highpass. This was the route I<br/>
took, knowing this list I be there is an even better approach I never<br/>
thought of.<br/>
