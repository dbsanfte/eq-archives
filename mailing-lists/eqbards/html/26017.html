<div id="ygrps-yiv-846209050">I have to agree about many of our songs...but we are similar to all classes in that regard...great abilities punctuated by slow periods of development.<br/>
I have to tell you though: I really enjoyed my teens.  At 13 I soloed Dorn with a drum and boastful bellow.  Then I went to Everfrost until 16, Lake Ratetear until 18 and I soloed my first Snow Orc Shaman at South Tower in Everfrost at 19.  Went to East Karana for two levels after that then and hit Lake of Ill Omen. At 25 I started to solo warlords at the goblin fort and I owned that area until level 30 when I moved to the Overthere.  At 32 I went to the Rathe Mountains and soloed cyclops and giants until maybe 38 and went to Eastern Wastes for 10 levels.  Show me another class that can solo coldain villages sub 40 and the only downtime you have is going to sell and bank.  At 49 I soloed Gorkul Paklock in BW ... and BW ended up being my favorite solo spot until 57.<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten frustrated with my character a number of times and just taken a break -- I have a bunch of twinks: Ranger, cleric, enchanter, shaman, necro, etc. somehow though, I always come back.  Deep down inside, however, I&#39;ll always be a bard.<br/>

songs we get are crap. I&#39;m having trouble staying interested. I thought Bard<br/>
would be the best class to play, because you don&#39;t have to wait four to ten<br/>
levels for any new stuff, but get a song every level...but when the songs do<br/>
things like identify items and imbue a non-magical weapon (which none of us<br/>
have used since the first few levels) as a Magic one, it&#39;s a total waste.<br/>
