&gt; I love a good wine!<br/>
&gt; Sure you want to hang out with someone so young though? You never know what<br/>
&gt; kind of songs the wannabes will sing.<br/>
<br/>

  If you are old enough to drink, you&#39;re perfect ;-)  As for your<br/>
  song selections, I have no quarrels against listening to other<br/>
  bards regardless of experience.  Just make sure you bring enough<br/>
  booze.<br/>
