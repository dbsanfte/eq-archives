<div id="ygrps-yiv-841967564">Lament is a must have song.  What this song does is give you the ability to <br/>
single pull mobs from groups of up to 4.  When a mob is hit with lament it&#39;s <br/>
agro range is great reduced, this allows you to pull the one standing next <br/>
to it with out the lulled one joining in.  It&#39;s great for breaking up large <br/>
camps, like the bandit camps in West Karana or the Orc camps in the commons. <br/>
  Save your coppers and get this song as soon as you can.<br/>
<br/>
One way to make the money for this song is to do the Qeynos to Kelethin <br/>
trade run.  In the Qeynos Hills you will find a pair of NPC&#39;s near Surefall <br/>
Glade (Baobob and Chanda Miller).  They will make wolf and bear hide armor <br/>
items that are usuable by the caster class.  This armor has the same or <br/>
better AC then Leather, and the finger wigglers in Greater Feydark will pay <br/>
very well for these items.  Here is a breakdown of who make what:<br/>
Baobob Miller:<br/>
Wolf hide belt  AC 3 - Low quality wolf pelt + 5 gold<br/>
Wolf hide boots AC 4 - Medium quality wolf pelt + 15 gold<br/>
Wolf hide cloak AC 5 - High quality wolf pelt + 21 gold<br/>
Chanda Miller:<br/>
Bear hide belt  AC 4 - Low quality bear skin + 5 gold<br/>
Bear hide Boots AC 5 - Medium quality bear skin + 15 gold<br/>
Bear hide cloak AC 6 - High quality bear skin + 21 gold<br/>
<br/>
Typical selling prices in Greater Feydark:<br/>
Wolf hide belt  2 plat<br/>
Wolf hide boots 3 plat<br/>
Wolf hide cloak 4-5 plat<br/>
Bear hide belt  25 gold<br/>
Bear hide Boots 4 plat<br/>
Bear hide cloak 5 to 10 plat (these are high sought after)<br/>
<br/>
When I used to do this in the first few weeks of retail I would net at least <br/>
50 plat a trip, sometimes over 100.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m a flat broke minstrel of the 8th verse bound to Qeynos and I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;wondering<br/>
&gt;if it&#39;s worth my while to try to earn enough PP and make trek back to<br/>
&gt;Kelethin to purchase Kelin&#39;s Lament.  I can&#39;t recall any of you more<br/>
&gt;experienced folks posting anything about how Lament has saved your life <br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt;times than you can remember or wow&#39;d your friends.  Should I just start<br/>
&gt;saving up for Elemental Rhythms?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, what&#39;s the next step up from rusty/splintered weapons and is there<br/>
&gt;anyplace a bard my age can go to where she may loot them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
