<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590601574">I have from a pretty reliable source that Allakhazam&#39;s is only HALF right on<br/>
the FSS being dropped on fear.<br/>
<br/>
From what i was led to believe, it has dropped on Fear.  BUT, the reason it<br/>
dropped on Fear was that a GM went to Fear and manually loaded it on a mob<br/>
(and, yes Shada, i believe it was Cazic himself)<br/>
<br/>
Would be nice if it were available apart from GM loads, because it is just<br/>
nasty...but I do not believe that it is available except for GM loads.<br/>

adultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
