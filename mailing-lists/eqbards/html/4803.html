<div id="ygrps-yiv-606786507">This is what is ticking me off, three times I have lost a corps due to their<br/>
servers popping down.  I am just greatful they were all corps of low teens<br/>
characters, so it was nothing that I could not easily replace.  If this is<br/>
planned down time, which Verrant claims it to be, then they should give us a<br/>
MINIMUM of thirty minutes notice that the servers will be coming down, both<br/>
in game AND on that tickertape thing in the server sellection screen.  This<br/>
way no one would be surprised and with a thirty minute warning I would<br/>
imagine it would be  enough to get out of any dungeon you are in.  It would<br/>
at least be better then that two minute warning we all get now.  This is how<br/>
it has been on The Rathe as well.  :P<br/>
