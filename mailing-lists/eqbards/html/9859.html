<div id="ygrps-yiv-670043062">At the time I got zapped, I was right near the zone border.  I was singing<br/>
DDD so I probably aggroed something inside the castle.  Based on what John<br/>
Kim said about LOS, that probably accounts for me gettting killed in one<br/>
shot even though I got no message indicating that I got hit. <br/>
