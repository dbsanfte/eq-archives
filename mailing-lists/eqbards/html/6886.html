<b>Subject:</b> Petiton to replace level 14 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867769236">I sent this out about an hour ago but I haven&#39;t received it back from the<br/>
list yet so sending it again just in case.  Sorry if we end up getting it<br/>
posted twice.<br/>
<br/>
Fellow bards,<br/>
<br/>
I came into work today and there were relatively few messages on the list.<br/>
In an effort to jumpstart some discussion, I have the following proposal.<br/>
<br/>
If enough people on this list thinks its a good idea, lets submit a petition<br/>
to have the level 14 song replaced.  As most of you are aware, the song<br/>
currently has almost no usefulness.  All magic items come already<br/>
identified.  All you have to do is right click on it.  The only situations I<br/>
have heard of the song providing any additional information is when it is<br/>
sung while holding a head.  The name of the person who the head used to be<br/>
attached to can be discovered.  This is only useful if you are turning in<br/>
the head as part of a quest.  I am unaware of any other uses for this song.<br/>
<br/>
I propose that we also provide Verant with some ideas on a song to replace<br/>
it with.  The biggest thing to remember here is that the power of the new<br/>
song should be appropriate for a 14th level character.  I don&#39;t think minor<br/>
versions of any higher level song are likely to get approved.  The new song<br/>
should provide a completely new spell efffect.  I request that everyone<br/>
submit to this list their idea of what the new 14th level song should be.<br/>
Once we get several good responses, we can all vote on which ones we think<br/>
have the best chance of getting approved.  We can then submit the petition<br/>
to Verant with the entire list of suggested new songs ranked in the order we<br/>
vote on.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of ideas that I have:<br/>
<br/>
1) A combination heal/stamina song that combines Jaxan&#39;s and Hymn.  The<br/>
power of the song can either be the same as the two original songs or toned<br/>
down versions, perhaps 75% of the original values.<br/>
<br/>
2)  A song that increases agility and/or increases the Dodge skill.  The<br/>
amount increased would be similar to the DEX increase you get when you sing<br/>
Chant of Battle.  Song would affect the entire party.  Equipping an<br/>
instrument, most likely the drum, would increase the effect of the song.<br/>
<br/>
3)  A song that would teleport the bard to the nearest bards guild.  This<br/>
song would have to have some serious constraints placed on it in order for<br/>
Verant to even consider adding it.  Perhaps only usable in outdoor zones (no<br/>
dungeons) and/or while not in combat.  Should also require a high skill<br/>
level in the instrument that is required to play it.  If you miss a note and<br/>
fail, the song button grays out for a specified amount of time before you<br/>
can try it again.<br/>
<br/>
4)  A song that has a major taunt effect above and beyond that or normal<br/>
bard songs.  Useful in those situations where your casters are getting<br/>
mauled and you can&#39;t pull them off with normal means.  Also useful if<br/>
someone is close to dying and the mob has frenzied on them.<br/>
<br/>
5)  A song that binds a bard to his current location.  I don&#39;t think this<br/>
one would ever have a chance of getting approved but we can include it if<br/>
thats what everyone wants.<br/>
<br/>
These are what I came up with on the fly.  Make any modifications to these<br/>
that you like.  Submit new ideas if you have one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the Army and will be going out on a field exercise this Thursday for<br/>
the next week.  Assuming this message generates a lot of positive response,<br/>
someone else will have to facilitate discussion on this issue until then.  I<br/>
will write up the petition when I get back next week if we all come to an<br/>
agreement.<br/>
