<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054722113">I got one the other week, but I&#39;ve been too focused on getting level 55 to test it.  I&#39;ll try it this<br/>
weekend if I can.  It&#39;s a lute, so it&#39;s a string instrument (I gather).  I haven&#39;t used it for anything<br/>
but the effect though.  Two cool things:  the werewolf illusion gives a STR bonus (unlike some of the<br/>
illusion masks, which give nothing other than the illusion), and it equips in the primary hand, so you can<br/>
equip the Lute of the Howler and the off-hand mesmerizing Lute (Melodic Truncheon?) and attack with two<br/>
Lutes at once!  Dueling banjos!  hehe.<br/>
