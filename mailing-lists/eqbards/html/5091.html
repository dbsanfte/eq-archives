<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-686911563">Do you remember a recent patch that changed Treeform so druids<br/>
couldn&#39;t move while as a tree?  Well hold onto your drums but Selo&#39;s<br/>
breaks the tree&#39;s roots, and the lovely druids can start being<br/>
wandering trees again.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if people have mentioned this already, but it sure caused a<br/>
stir in East Commons when me and my sis were roaming around and I had<br/>
this big tree chasing after me!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone taking odds that this will get changed in a patch coming soon<br/>
to a computer near you?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and a big hi to Shada, who I saw sitting naked in front of the<br/>
bank during the auction, as us wood elves seem to have a habit of<br/>
doing!  Hope you didn&#39;t die somewhere too awful sis!<br/>
<br/>
See ya all<br/>
