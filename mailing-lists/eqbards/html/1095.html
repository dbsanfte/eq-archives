<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061993856">From the EQLizer:<br/>
<br/>
The staff of writhing is one of the various skull staff&#39;s in the game(which<br/>
look similar to the staff that the Priest of Discord is equipping). This<br/>
particular staff is a 1 handed blunt weapon and can be equipped by<br/>
Necromancers, Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians and Bards. It has a damage of<br/>
9, a delay of 33 and has the effect of chaotic feedback(which does 48<br/>
points of damage when successful).<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been impressed with most weapons I have seen so far, but this<br/>
sounds like a real treat. Any idea where to find one?<br/>
<br/>
I would be willing to train my 1H Blunt to use this, since it has a very<br/>
nice magical effect.<br/>
<br/>
Working on using EQLizer for some complete weapon analysis, will post soon.<br/>
