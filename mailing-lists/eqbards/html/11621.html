<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876568174">I actually had a humerous experience in Sol A last night regarding spell<br/>
casters buffing others.  If you don&#39;t know Sol A, don&#39;t worry, my<br/>
description is unimportant.  What is important is that I was pulling from<br/>
the bar room area to the safe room where we were camped.  There was an<br/>
annoying Young goblin wizard that spawned near the door I was pulling from.<br/>
Rather then pull it, I just lamented it and ignored it for the next 6 or 7<br/>
pulls (it conned very green to my party).  Since I didn&#39;t have bellow memmed<br/>
or throwing dagger with me, I have to run up and hit the MOB to get it<br/>
agro&#39;ed.  Everytime I ran the MOB by the young wizard, it would cast a<br/>
damage shield on the MOB and we would spend the rest of the fight getting<br/>
&quot;you are burned&quot; messages :P.  I finally got sick of it and just killed the<br/>
sob, but I found it very humerous that it was perfectly timing its spells on<br/>
every pull to make sure my mob got a little bit of extra help against us.<br/>

&gt; The first time I walked all the way from the zone to 4C in Cazic I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; attacked.  I conned everything along the way and everything was<br/>
&gt; indifferent.<br/>
&gt; Next time I walked thru I assumed I was safe and didn&#39;t con any<br/>
&gt; lizards as I<br/>
&gt; moved.  I walked by a lizard in the maze and got attacked.  The best<br/>
&gt; explanation I have to why it saw thru the invis was that the<br/>
&gt; lizard had the<br/>
&gt; see invis spell buff.  I don&#39;t know if lizard spellcasters can<br/>
&gt; actually cast<br/>
&gt; this spell but if they can that would easily explain it.  If they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t cast<br/>
&gt; see invis then I have no idea what happened.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have a theory about Sonorous Coulding failing. It has failed for me a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few times (although I have NEVER been attacked my any lizard in CT :). I<br/>
&gt; &gt; noticed (and posted) my success in Unrest a few days ago. My only<br/>
&gt; &gt; failure was when a mob spawned right near me and immediately attacked.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then today I read a post from someone who was in CT and looking at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawns in the Throne Room, they stated that 2 mobs walked in OR spawned<br/>
&gt; &gt; and saw thru their invis.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know certain mobs can see invis, and that invis can fail, but neither<br/>
&gt; &gt; I nor the poster got &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It appears that sonorous clouding works on mobs that are in the zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; when it pulses, but mobs who spawn and have not had a &quot;dose&quot; (pulse) of<br/>
&gt; &gt; it can see thru it. Just ancedotal evidence so far, if anyone can add to<br/>
&gt; &gt; this, please do so.<br/>
