<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138548558">I use the song for this a lot.  If I&#39;m in a group that has a lot of casters<br/>
and few if any tanks I&#39;ll use lullaby.  This has two effects.  First, of<br/>
course, is that is puts most of the mobs to sleep so that they&#39;re not doing<br/>
damage to anyone.  This gives my casting group a nice luxurious time in which<br/>
to cast their spells.  Second, and just as important, it tends to pull the<br/>
mobs off of them and onto me.  Since I&#39;m much more of a tank than any of the<br/>
pure casting classes this is usually a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
To make a comment about another message I read regarding lullaby, at level 20<br/>
and 21 I have definitely noticed that using the Lute (or my weightless<br/>
mandolin in my case) definitely does improve lullaby.  It seems to nod more<br/>
mobs longer than without.  Not a HUGE difference, but noticable at 21st.  So<br/>
when I absolutely MUST get the crowd under control and keep them there for a<br/>
couple of minutes while my tanks take out four or five mobs on after another,<br/>
I always equip my mandolin.<br/>

&gt; The song is also great at getting mobs off your casters.  It<br/>
&gt; does *not* clear the hate list, but it does make them hate you<br/>
&gt; more rather quickly, which is ok since we&#39;re decent tanks.<br/>
&gt; While they&#39;re nodding, they&#39;re not interrupting the caster&#39;s<br/>
&gt; spells, so your friends will be able to cast more reliably.<br/>
&gt; My cleric friend loves this song because without it in<br/>
&gt; multiple mob situations, the unengaged mobs tend to jump on<br/>
&gt; the her after she heals anyone.  She says if that happens, she<br/>
&gt; just stands next to me for a few pulses and the mobs start<br/>
&gt; attacking me again.<br/>
