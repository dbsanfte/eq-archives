<div id="ygrps-yiv-377762255">Perhaps the people on the other list wouldn&#39;t fill that way if they had been<br/>
reading some of the posts on this list by JM and the other high level<br/>
contributors:-).<br/>
<br/>
I did notice one of the posts was from a member of the Fires of Heaven guild<br/>
(the guild who recently kiiled Lady Vox with/without the help of Aradune).<br/>
I play on E&#39;ci so have no idea how this guild operates and really don&#39;t<br/>
care.  However, if you believe some of the recent posts on EQVault, the<br/>
Fires of Heaven guild consists primarily of powergamers.  From all the great<br/>
posts I have read on this list, the general consensus among us seems to<br/>
indicate that playing a bard is not very suitable to the type of person who<br/>
powergames.  Perhaps that is why the poster felt that bards were useless.<br/>
Pure speculation on my part.  <br/>

&gt; Hi Crip Fireblade from FoH here...<br/>
&gt; lvl 49 bard on Veeshan<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     My question or statement is really bards are totally screwed over at<br/>
&gt; high levels.<br/>
&gt; Not only do they have no chance of meleeing even a tenth as well as a<br/>
&gt; warrior, but there<br/>
&gt; are NO high level songs that are worthwhile. <br/>
