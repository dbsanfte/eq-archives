 </span></blockquote>Ugh! I&#39;m one of those people who find this stuff to be annoying. I mean, if<br/>
you&#39;re doing it on /say or /group that&#39;s fine, but IMO (nothing humble about<br/>
it) it is obnoxious to broadcast this stuff and revel in the complaints.<br/>
<br/>
But in your favor, at least you&#39;re doing it on ooc where I can turn this<br/>
off. :-P I really hate when people do this stuff on shout, which is<br/>
necessary for train updates. *Windleaf ducks the pie thrown by Papa*<br/>

&gt; quit or try to<br/>
&gt; get you to convince me to keep playing (I have neglected too <br/>
&gt; much RL for<br/>
&gt; this game).  Verant as a whole did a great job with this <br/>
&gt; game.  Perhaps<br/>
&gt; thats the problem, it is so tantalizing close to greatness that its<br/>
&gt; short-comings glare so brightly.  Most of the people playing are fun,<br/>
&gt; polite, and enhance the experience.  However they only make the<br/>
&gt; obnoxious players a little harder to ignore.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve gone through this type of depression before. But once I got DDD at<br/>
level 18, I switched to all instruments for soloing and had an absolute<br/>
blast. Also, for me, nothing gets me back into the game like shopping.<br/>
Getting a new weapon or piece of armor always gets me going, and once you<br/>
hit level 20, you can start hunting gargoyles on Spectre island in OOT with<br/>
a partner. At level 23 you can start soloing them with your all instrument<br/>
attack and earn enough money to seriously upgrade your weaps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been waiting for this for a few years and will be shocked when Blizzard<br/>
finally does release this. It&#39;s gotten to the point where I&#39;m pretty<br/>
non-chalant about it. I was real excited for this to be released early last<br/>
year. Let&#39;s see if they do indeed release it as expected.<br/>
