<div id="ygrps-yiv-617412428">only problem with aria is it only removes one buff per pulse, and sometimes<br/>
it takes more than one pulse to remove a buff (unless they changed it).  i<br/>
like to use it in duels though :)  casters, however, have cancel magic<br/>
spells that remove 3 buffs in one cast, so if they are willing to use it it<br/>
is more effective.  however you do it though, it&#39;s very important to get rid<br/>
of damage shields and especially SoW on mobs.<br/>

&gt; it to drop<br/>
&gt; damage shields ALL the time.  Our enchanters never bother <br/>
&gt; memming dispel if<br/>
&gt; I have this loaded.  It&#39;s a fantastic song and I find it <br/>
&gt; extremely useful in<br/>
&gt; any dungeon with casters that throw damage shields or buffs <br/>
&gt; of any kind on<br/>
&gt; mobs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the psalm i use most in normal fighting is actually mystic shielding.  for<br/>
huge boosts, it&#39;s usually rhythm songs with drum.  too bad psalms don&#39;t<br/>
stack with themselves.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I find that the only psalms I use are warmth, cooling and the two with<br/>
&gt; &quot;cure&quot; components.  And those I use VERY rarely.<br/>
