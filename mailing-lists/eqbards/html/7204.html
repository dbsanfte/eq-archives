<b>Subject:</b> FLOWING BLACK SILK SASH TEST <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316596025">I recently Acquired a Flowing Black Silk Sash and endeavored to test it out<br/>
last night, singly and in comination with Anthem de Arms.  During the Tests<br/>
I am a 29th Bard non encumBered.  <br/>
<br/>
For the tests I tested with 2 separate weapons, An Electrum Bladed<br/>
Wakazashi<br/>
and a Short Sword of the Ykesha.  Each test was done with one weapon only<br/>
and the off hand just punching.  I tested with the Sash on, Sash off (Troll<br/>
Hide Belt on instead), Anthem on no Sash, and Both Anthem and the Sash<br/>
active.  Here are my results.  <br/>
<br/>
First test with the Wakazashi Fighting against 4 separate Sand ScaraBs.<br/>
Timing on this test was 27 Seconds.  The Wakazashi is listed as 7 damage 21<br/>
Delay.  <br/>
<br/>
Delay 21 (2.08) Wakzashi - No Sash - No song  - 13 hits (including misses)<br/>
in 27 seconds (4 punches not included)<br/>
<br/>
Delay 19 (1.93) Wakazashi - No Sash - Antem de Arms - 14 hits in 27 seconds<br/>
(5 punches as well)<br/>
<br/>
Delay 18 (1.8 ratio) Wakazashi - Sash on - No Song - 15 hits/27 sec (3<br/>
punches)<br/>
<br/>
Delay 14 (1.42) Wakazashi - Sash on - Anthem On - 19 hits/27 sec (3<br/>
punches)<br/>
<br/>
The second test was trying the Short Sword of Ykesha instead of Wakazashi.<br/>
It was against 4 separate Crypt mummies.  The stats for the Ykesha are<br/>
listed as 24 delay 8 damage.  At my level its effect does not go off yet.<br/>
Timing on this test was 35 seconds each.  <br/>
<br/>
Delay 23 (2.33) Ykesha - No Sash - No Song - 15 hits 35 seconds (5 punch)<br/>
<br/>
Delay 22 (2.19) Ykesha - No Sash - Anthem De Arms playing - 16/35 (5 punch)<br/>
<br/>
Delay 19 (1.94) Ykesha - Sash Worn - No Song - 18/35 (7 punches not<br/>
included)<br/>
<br/>
Delay 15 (1.52) Ykesha - Sash - and Anthem all going - 23 hits 35 seconds<br/>
(5<br/>
punches)<br/>
<br/>
From these results it is easy to see that the Flowing Black Silk Sash and<br/>
Anthem de Arms do indeed Stack thier Speed increases.  In Fact, when<br/>
Comined<br/>
together their enhancements are far Better than the sum of thier parts.  In<br/>
some way when comBined they totally rule.  Using Both the Sash and Singing<br/>
Anthem De Arms I took a 21/7  weapon down to a 14/7 one, and a 24/8 down to<br/>
15/8.  These are phenomenal stats.  Get a Sash when you can.  They are<br/>
great<br/>
stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
(I also tested to see if the sash speeded up song pulses ut the results<br/>
indicate that the Sash does not speed our songs.  I recieved 10 messages in<br/>
60 seconds with heal and with anthem regardless if I had the sash on or<br/>
off).  <br/>
<br/>
Note I have not tested with a slower weapon like the Runed Falchion.  Also<br/>
note that a weapons Speed Rating is equivalent the the tenths of seconds in<br/>
Between swings it seems.  <br/>
<br/>
