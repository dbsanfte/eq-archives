<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498992880">Hey speaking of running away like a frightened schoolgirl; I learned last<br/>
night that I can handily outrun Shadowed Men now.  At 48th with Selo&#39;s Drums<br/>
of March I absolutely blew their doors off.  I was watching in third person<br/>
to see by how much I was outrunning them and it was embarrassing.  I smoked<br/>
&#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my understanding that SM have &quot;Spirrit of Norrath&quot; speed on them, and<br/>
if that is in fact the case it means that I and other bards equally equipped<br/>
are the fastest things in the game by a fairly wide margin.<br/>
