<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Dunno, I&#39;m convinced that the shadowmen don&#39;t actually move at a <br/>
  given speed, if they are in range of a player who irritates them<br/>
  they just kinda warp behind them.  When I feared one, it just poofed<br/>
  I never saw him again.  However, I&#39;ve not tried to toe to toe outrun<br/>
  one.  Then again I don&#39;t have a selo&#39;s drum.  Since accelerando is<br/>
  speed capped, I&#39;m not sure the difference between selo&#39;s and mm<br/>
  will be drastic.<br/>
