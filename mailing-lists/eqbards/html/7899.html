<div id="ygrps-yiv-255848443"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hmmm....you&#39;re right about necros -- Gathering Shadows they call it -- my<br/>
&gt; mistake.  I wondered why they had been zeroed out. Don&#39;t know about shamans.<br/>
&gt; I know they don&#39;t get it before 20, and the one spell list I have seen that<br/>
&gt; has spells up that high didn&#39;t have it listed.  However, even if it is there<br/>
&gt; at 29, it is a long time to go before you get it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Well, to respond to this, and your earlier message.  Every caster<br/>
class gets at least 1 option to avoiding engagements on corpse retrieval,<br/>
many get 2.  One is invis, the other is root.  Yes, some classes don&#39;t get<br/>
these spells until lvl 9 or 16 or so, but that&#39;s not really the point.<br/>
The difference between the various melee classes and the various caster<br/>
classes don&#39;t really begin to show themselves until around this time<br/>
anyways.  If one tries to argue that a melee class can get to their corpse<br/>
easier than a caster because a level 1 warrior has more hp than a level 1<br/>
wizard, that argument is completely invalid when discussing the two<br/>
classes as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Again, though, this is still irrelevant to my main premise,  which is that<br/>
&gt; there isn&#39;t a compelling need for melee classes to be able to bind or bind<br/>
&gt; anywhere.  I can&#39;t argue that it wouldn&#39;t be more convenient, because it<br/>
&gt; would be, I just don&#39;t believe that it is critical.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My argument isn&#39;t that melee classes NEED bind, but that bind SHOULD be<br/>
able to work on melee classes.  Binding in city zones only was a quick-fix<br/>
to the problem of malicious binds.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s very little left in the game that could be considered &quot;critical&quot;<br/>
changes.  People will play their classes however they have to to make it<br/>
&quot;work&quot; and allow them to advance.  None of the changes Verant is making<br/>
now is critical in my opinion, but that&#39;s totally irrelevant to whether<br/>
something should or should not happen.<br/>
