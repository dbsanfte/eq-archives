<div id="ygrps-yiv-128736206">1. Either you were rude in your /petition<br/>
2. You tried this when there weren&#39;t as many guides in the game<br/>
<br/>
Few weeks ago I saw a low-mid level fellow resurrected by a guide outside<br/>
the minotaur cave within the hour of his death, around 1 AM EST.  I had been<br/>
the one who suggested he /petition, and told him to phrase it somewhere<br/>
along the lines of, &quot;A bug where I was charmed through a wall caused me to<br/>
die and now I cannot get my corpse.&quot;  Important to have the word &quot;bug&quot; in<br/>
there somewhere, I told him.<br/>
<br/>
This is not ridiculous, you will get help.  Now, if one phrased a petition<br/>
something like, &quot;Stupid game got me killed. Get me my corpse now,&quot; there<br/>
likely will be no assistance.  Not implying you petitioned this way, Mully,<br/>
but I&#39;m certain many do.  Time shouldn&#39;t matter too much, believe Guides<br/>
play at all hours like anybody else.<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s funny!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, seriously though, I guess it is TECHNICALLY an option.  But be<br/>
&gt;warned - after losing my corpse due to a game bug, I petitioned, and<br/>
&gt;a week and a day later I finally was contacted by a GM.  Actually,<br/>
&gt;that is not true - a friend of mine contacted a GM, as he is on for<br/>
&gt;at least double the amount of time that I am.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And if you are not contacted by the GM before your corpse decays,<br/>
&gt;then it is GONE!  No they can not, or maybe will not reimburse you<br/>
&gt;for items you were carrying.  Mino axe?  gone.  Magic armour? gone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, you may be lucky and play during &#39;peak&#39; times, when the<br/>
&gt;concentration of GMs is likely to be higher.  And I guess that the<br/>
&gt;number of GMs has increased since my sad and sorry experience.<br/>
