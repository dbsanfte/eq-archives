Thanks for the advice! I will look you up online and make myself available<br/>
to help out other guilds as much as possible.<br/>

Grats on Trak!<br/>

Xegony does not use a master calendar to my knowledge for the simple fact<br/>
that we have too many personalities on Xegony. Cooperation is sometimes<br/>
limited and we have whole guilds of folks that simply don&#39;t play well with<br/>
others. Rule of thumb is whoever gets there first and god help you if you<br/>
get wiped out first try. Dragons on Xegony usually die pretty fast,<br/>
although<br/>
<br/>
Vox is a bit off the beaten track and can be up a bit longer than most. I<br/>
would guess the aveage lifespan of a dragon on Xegony to be no more than a<br/>
couple hours. You may consider parking a toon that can track in Perma.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is still to try and get into Ragefire camps for red scales and<br/>
watch for Gore as much as possible. If you can get into a Vox/Naggy raid,<br/>
do it. It will probably take you several levels before you have all the<br/>
pieces. Helping people with Gore/Vox/Nag/Trak/Rage gets your name known<br/>
and brownie points built. You will need them if you spot Vox up and when<br/>
you get ready to spawn Trak for your last step. My guild has some Vox<br/>
level toons and we need a frost book for one of our main paladins. If you<br/>
spot her up one night, give me a tell and we will see who&nbsp; we have<br/>
that can come help.<br/>
<br/>
We did finally get Kaas&#39; epic finished this weekend. Ever had the luck to<br/>
be sitting in Trak&#39;s lair, waiting on the undead bard only to have Trak<br/>
spawn? What fun!<br/>
