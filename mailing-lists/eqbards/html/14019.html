&gt; &gt; How about this:  Has anyone EVER successfully use the level 35 song?  Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; there a point to it?  It seems to drain mana so slowly that it is useless.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I took out a shaman the other day with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Stun, drain, stun, drain, stun, drain.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;   After about 1-2 minutes she had no mana.  Needless to say,<br/>
&gt;   caster with no mana = dead caster.<br/>

seems to be tuned for PvP combat.  NPC casters seem to have a<br/>
lot more mana, and regenerate it a lot faster.  I asked if it<br/>
could be tuned so it was useful against NPCs.<br/>
