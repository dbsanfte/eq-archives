<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649215146">I don&#39;t know where the hell you were in Beta but the song is exactly the<br/>
same. I did the same combo at lower levels. Hell at 15th level I was soloing<br/>
3 Fire Elementals at a time in Lava with that song. If you try it make sure<br/>
you are wearing decent armor (chain or better).<br/>

&gt;It seems that I was incorrect in a posting earlier this week (and in my<br/>
&gt;bard guide on EQVault).  Hymn of Restoration now appears to cause a<br/>
&gt;regenerative effect, rather that a heal per pulse effect.  So if you<br/>
&gt;start the Hymn, then turn the song off, you still heal at the increased<br/>
&gt;rate for the duration of the song effect (while the icon remains on the<br/>
&gt;screen).  This is not how it behaved early in beta, but it&#39;s good news<br/>
&gt;for us bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The way it seems to work, and it&#39;s understandable how I was confused<br/>
&gt;when you see how it works, is that when the first pulse kicks in, your<br/>
&gt;health goes up by the appropriate amount (which is something like 3 plus<br/>
&gt;one per six levels plus 2 if you&#39;re holding an instrument and plus 2 if<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re seated).  There are then approximately two more &quot;ticks&quot; where<br/>
&gt;your health will go up again.  These &quot;ticks&quot; are synchronized with the<br/>
&gt;song&#39;s pulses, and will occur even if you stop singing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The amount that the &quot;tick&quot; heals is probably determined by<br/>
&gt;instrument/sitting etc. at the time of the tick, rather than the time of<br/>
&gt;the original pulse, so standing up after the first tick will probably<br/>
&gt;reduce the amount you are healed on the second and third tick.  I<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t verified this though.<br/>
