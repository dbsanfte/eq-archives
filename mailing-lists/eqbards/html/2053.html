&gt;So far I have recieved character primary stats from only eight people.  This<br/>
&gt;is still not enough responses to generate a valid sample. There are over 300<br/>
&gt;people subscribed to this list.  I&#39;m shooting for at least 30 responses<br/>
&gt;before I publish the results.      Request that anyone who has not sent me<br/>
&gt;their characters stats to please do so. I also need to know what race you<br/>
&gt;are.   Once I get enough data, I will post the &quot;average&quot; bard stats, both<br/>
&gt;combined and by race.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would, but since I&#39;m not actually *playing* EQ anymore, it makes it very<br/>
difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, though!<br/>
