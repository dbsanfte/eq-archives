Left Goblin Ears in Highpass Keep, when turned into Captain Bosec<br/>
with give you faction with the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos AND the<br/>
Freeport Militia and a few others. You do NOT take a hit with<br/>
the good Freeport guards or the good Qeynos guards.<br/>
<br/>
I belive Orc scalps turned into the Volunteer (sp?) in Highpass <br/>
itself will do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Since I spent from level 22-32 in HighPass Keep, I had over 200<br/>
ears saved up. I gave them all to a Paladin who was KOS, and<br/>
it got her to dubious. (from scowls I beleive)<br/>

PS. I am offering 50pp for each RIGHT goblin ear, please contact<br/>
me =)<br/>
<br/>
PPS. As for the why you&#39;d want to kill him..<br/>
	When you are young, and starting out, the 50-100pp you<br/>
	got for selling the Bloodforge Hammer was a SUBSTATIONAL<br/>
	amount of money. (Think back to your first level 10 or so<br/>
	character and how broke you were!)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to kill him.  The weapon you get<br/>
&gt; is not really that good, and the faction hit is substantial.  <br/>
&gt; Repairing your faction with the merchants of Qeynos is easy<br/>
&gt; enough (visit Blackburrow).  But everything I&#39;ve found that<br/>
&gt; raises your faction with the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos also<br/>
&gt; lowers it with the non-corrupt guards.<br/>
