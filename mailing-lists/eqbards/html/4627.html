What do you mean it does damage? Is it like a fire shield? I just got Psalm<br/>
of Cooling and it raises protection from heat by 50-60 points, are you<br/>
saying Psalm of warmth protects from cold as well as causes damage to mobs?<br/>
I have never read this anywhere before.<br/>

When I first got this song at 25, it did 4 points per hit.  At<br/>
29, this changed to 5 points per hit.  If this trend holds,<br/>
it&#39;s 1 extra damage every 4 levels.  L25-28 = 4, L29-32 = 5,<br/>
L33-36 = 6, L37-40 = 7, L41-44 = 8, L45-48 = 9, L49-50 = 10.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it *does* stack with the druid/ranger&#39;s thorn damage<br/>
shields.  I thought it didn&#39;t because I only saw the &quot;is<br/>
pierced by thorns&quot; message. A druid cast shield of barbs on me<br/>
while I was playing PoW, and I also only got the &quot;pierced by<br/>
thorns&quot; message.  But the damage was the sum of the thorns and<br/>
PoW.  So only the message is in error, the damage is still<br/>
there.<br/>
