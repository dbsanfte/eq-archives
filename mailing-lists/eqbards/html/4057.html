The combo I have been using for about 5 levels now is the Demon Claw and<br/>
Dragoon Dirk. This combo has been the best (for me) that I&#39;ve seen so far.<br/>
Very fast. I also keep a Runed Bone Fork in my Ranged Slot for its benefits.<br/>
<br/>
In the bank, I keep a Staff of Writhing, Silvery Waraxe, and PGT. I&#39;ve sold<br/>
of my Pugius and Screaming Mace, and I never really cared for any of the<br/>
whips.<br/>
