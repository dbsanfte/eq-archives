<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-583685228">I&#39;d like to know this too.<br/>
<br/>
Last night in Crushbone - I derailed a 6 cent, 2 legionairre, 2 oracle,<br/>
Lord Darish train with my horn and Denon&#39;s (lvl 18 song).<br/>
<br/>
A bit later - I think every cent and legionairre in CB came boiling to the<br/>
zone - I got a lot of them, but Dvinn was hiding in the middle of them -<br/>
punched me - and punched me backwards INTO the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Like Chords - all you get is a wince message.<br/>
<br/>
Only way I can think to check damage - I dual a buddy - and have him tell<br/>
you how much it does. That I haven&#39;t done yet.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of horns - I&#39;ve seen on this list several times where a mino horn<br/>
doubles between wind and brass - methinks this isn&#39;t correct. I can get it<br/>
to do a wind song - and although it works with brass - so does singing - so<br/>
now I&#39;m back to shlepping a how orchestra around with me again.<br/>

&gt;Hail friends,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As simple question I cannot figure out for the life of me:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do you know how much damage your Chords of Dissonance dishes<br/>
&gt;out? When I hit a critter with it, I only get the message that he<br/>
&gt;&quot;winces&quot;. Now, I know I&#39;m hitting pretty good at lev 17 using<br/>
&gt;a mandolin because I&#39;ve tried only using the chord and not attacking<br/>
&gt;and the crit&#39;s life bar goes down at a good rate. But frankly,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to know exactly how much damage I&#39;m putting to him<br/>
&gt;so I can measure its use against Bellow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for any info. you can pass along.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yours in Song,<br/>
