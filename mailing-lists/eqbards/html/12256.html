Seriously tho the bard quests seem to be some of the easiest there. Some of <br/>
the cleric quests are easy - pick up an item off the ground in Mistmoore, <br/>
get an item off a giant dark bone, bleh. I REALLY think they need to <br/>
re-think putting a required item for the cleric bp on BILGE (of all spawns <br/>
in the game) somewhere else. I think the bp is junk, but STILL...<br/>

&gt;Just checked EQVault, and there is a post from Gordon about quest armor.  <br/>
&gt;Said something about the quest armor being more difficult for some classes <br/>
&gt;than others, and expect changes in the next few patches.  Ya&#39;ll smell that <br/>
&gt;nerf headed straight for us, or am I just paranoid?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My pally friend cries bloody freakin&#39; murder everytime I ask him to help me <br/>
&gt;to get another piece of lambent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, did anybody notice shields on barbarians?  How come they fixed the <br/>
&gt;shield graphic, but we are still strumming a stick, and not banging our my <br/>
&gt;drums all day?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry if this sounds like whinny...<br/>
