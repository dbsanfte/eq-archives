<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119904524">Months ago I bought the Pugius Dagger to dual wield with my dragoon dirk<br/>
since the delay was so low and it works vs magic only monsters.  I was a<br/>
shish-kebob machine doing 10 damage with Pugius and 12 damage with Dragoon<br/>
Dirk for as much as 22 straight melee damage about every 2.2 seconds.  The<br/>
Silvery War Axe that fetches 400pp on the PC market has an attack delay of<br/>
22 and damage 6 vs the Pugius&#39; delay 21 damage 5 and they weigh the same.<br/>
The Bladed Thulian Claws have an attack delay of 19 and damage of 5.  Pugius<br/>
is an EXCELLENT piercing weapon for Bards in their teens who decide to go<br/>
with piercing, however, one thing eludes me:<br/>
<br/>
Where is this weapon found?!?<br/>
<br/>
I have seen it posted on websites that it comes from a Lesser Blade Fiend in<br/>
Unrest, but I have NEVER seen a Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest and have been<br/>
told they do not exist.  I never see anyone using this weapon, nor do I see<br/>
anyone selling it...is it a limited release artifact now?  Who knows the<br/>
mysterious secret of the origin of the Pugius Dagger?<br/>
