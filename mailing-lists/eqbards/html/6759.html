 </span></blockquote>Orrrr, another factor is when a bunch of people start feeding off each<br/>
others complaints, the volume slowly growing in a feedback loop. As with any<br/>
feeback loop, the volume doesn&#39;t grow because of more imput, say from more<br/>
and more people complaining, but from the reprocessed and reprocessed<br/>
complaints of a few. Once the signal gets going it seems obvious that there<br/>
is a problem, because obviously the volume is growing, when the real problem<br/>
is the retention and rehashing of of the same information.<br/>
