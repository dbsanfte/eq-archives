&gt; I am pretty sure that I got mine in the &quot;bar room&quot; in Sol-A.  We were there<br/>
&gt; about 4 hours and I got both items.  We had some mid 30&#39;s rangers with us<br/>
&gt; lower 30&#39;s.  When my regular group tried to break the room at levels 24 thru<br/>
&gt; 28 group, we got spanked.  If you can recruit some mid 30&#39;s types you should<br/>
&gt; do pretty well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Can anyone gimme a few hints about where and how tough the Solusek<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mage and the Solusek Champion are.  An opinion of how frequent the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawn and drops are would be helpful too ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got mine while I was in the low- to mid-30s, in a group with <br/>
like-leveled people.  We got them in the King Room and the connected <br/>
rooms.  The Champions are pretty frequent, the Mages much less so, and <br/>
the components are apparently not a common drop.  It took sixteen hours <br/>
before the second Fiery Vambrace dropped (another bard had first dibs...) <br/>
The one problem you might have will be breaking into this area, since <br/>
there are three linked spawns behing a closed door, and three more which <br/>
are probably also linked in the next room behind another closed door.  <br/>
They will aggro through the door, so you may need a high level to pull <br/>
them out one at a time.  If the room is broken, you should be fine.  <br/>
Otherwise you need a crowd control specialist (e.g., an Enchanter).<br/>
