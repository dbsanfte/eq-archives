<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794514304">i know the thread mutated into bard v. cleric, but no that note here is my<br/>
report.<br/>
<br/>
LEVEL 50 Bard V. LEVEL 50 Cleric on Mithaniel Marr!<br/>
call now pay-per-view only $29.95.<br/>
<br/>
play by play:<br/>
pre-duel, played mystic shielding L42 for magic resistance.<br/>
as soon as duel is accepted, mellifluous motion to teleport away and<br/>
disorient him.<br/>
ran back up to him and twist mystic shielding (to resist his roots and<br/>
stuns) and syvelian&#39;s anti-magic aria L40 (say bye bye to resolution, resist<br/>
magic, and symbol hit point buff).<br/>
after removing ALL his buffs without about 3 or 4 syvelian&#39;s hits, started<br/>
beating the crap out of him with melee.<br/>
played mystic shielding all the time to keep resisting those stuns and<br/>
roots, which i resisted about 90% of the time.  he does not resist my songs<br/>
as much cause i debuffed his resist magic spell.<br/>
in relation to a previous discussion about Pixie Strike working on PCs, boy<br/>
does it work incredibly.  his high dmg DD spells take a long time to cast,<br/>
so i would play mystic shielding and pixie strike him as soon as he started<br/>
casting.  if he doesn&#39;t resist (he only resisted 10% of the time) then it<br/>
interrupts him EVERY TIME.  if he gets a wrath through, it will take about a<br/>
bubble of hit points, but he is losing mana fast trying to root, stun, DD,<br/>
and heal himself and he will run out soon enough.  definitely better to<br/>
pixie strike his DD spells instead of taking them with mystic shielding, as<br/>
i did not resist those, but did resist almost all of his stuns/roots.<br/>
<br/>
well that&#39;s how it went.  just a little note about bard v. cleric and the<br/>
fact about pixie strike working wonders against PCs.<br/>
<br/>
on another note, do not duel a caster who is bound in the same zone.  this<br/>
caused me to have to basically kill him 3 times instead of once, because<br/>
when low he finally got a gate off after about 10 pixie strikes interrupted<br/>
him, after which he hid, healed, and medded up to fight some more.  he did<br/>
this twice.  i had to track him down in the zone and start the fight again.<br/>
one thing i forgot about was desparate dirge, which does 300 dmg now.<br/>
Martyn reminded me during the fight, an awesome idea.  if i remembered, i<br/>
could have used it on him the first encounter and he would not have been<br/>
able to get.  i used it on him the second encounter, but i was just a tad<br/>
early and it did not kill him.  though next time it will be nice when they<br/>
are low to be able to take them out in one big punch.<br/>
