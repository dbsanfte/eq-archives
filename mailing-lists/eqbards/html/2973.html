 </span></blockquote>I have a P2/450 with 128mb ram.. I&#39;ve only got a 31.2 connection (if I&#39;m<br/>
lucky.. local phone lines blow, so anything faster is a dream, even with<br/>
a 56k modem.. and my cable company doesn&#39;t even have 30 channels, much<br/>
less cable modems (sigh, the trouble of bass-ackwards towns))  I&#39;m using<br/>
whatever video card came with my system (not positive, but I&#39;m guessing<br/>
it&#39;s an ATI Rage Pro.. that seems popular to prepackage nowadays..<br/>
honestly havn&#39;t checked) and I never have any trouble with lag or<br/>
slowdown.. very rarely I&#39;ll get some bad packet loss.. but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen often enough to bother me.. (altho I do bitch about it a lot when<br/>
it does :)<br/>
<br/>
A couple things you may want to check..<br/>
(not sure if these&#39;l help with what seems like a video problem, but it<br/>
does help with slowdown in general)<br/>
Check to see what things are running while you play eq, and turn off the<br/>
things you don&#39;t need.. (both in the system tray, and the ctrl-alt-del<br/>
menu)<br/>
Check your system registry for uneeded things and zap em out of there<br/>
make sure your phone line is CLEAN!  If you can pick up a phone and hear<br/>
static, this can be a big cause of lag.  Ma Bell will usualy check and<br/>
correct this for free.  (altho dealing with them can be a pain)<br/>
Your modem brand DOES matter.  Some companies just make shoddy modems.<br/>
I use a US Robotics Courier v.everything 33.6  (upgraded to 56k)  I&#39;ve<br/>
never had a problem with it.. best modem I&#39;ve ever owned (and I&#39;ve owned<br/>
a lot :)  altho it is a bit pricey.. ($200 with a sysop discount about 3<br/>
years ago)<br/>
<br/>
Running in a lower res vid mode can help as well..<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  most of these things should not be tinkered with if you don&#39;t<br/>
know what you&#39;re doing.. (ESPECIALLY the system registry)  You can<br/>
REALLY screw things up if you make a mistake.. rule of thumb:  if you<br/>
don&#39;t know what it is, or what it does.. leave it alone  :).<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helped someone out there  *grins*<br/>
Take care,<br/>
