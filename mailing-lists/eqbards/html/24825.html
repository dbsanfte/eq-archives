<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787837421">The warlord drops the skull maybe 1/3 of the time, maybe even more.  If the<br/>
Warlord is camped send a tell to them and ask if you can loot it if it<br/>
drops, or bring a group in there and hope its not camped.  The xp isn&#39;t bad<br/>
there and you wont have to deal with most of the KC crap (trains) since you<br/>
are way in the back.<br/>

Phinny is a pansy, you can kill him with one group...</div>
