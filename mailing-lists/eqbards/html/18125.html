<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162323080">Oh no, tales of woe!<br/>
<br/>
My tale is fairly long, but there is woe in there, don&#39;t worry.  Ran to<br/>
Feerot from W Karana after slaughtering another round of helpless bandits.<br/>
Was hunting for that durned lizardman shaman, Roror or something like that.<br/>
Apparently about a dozen halflings were also hunting him.  Unfortunately<br/>
Bouncer Flerb was hunting the halflings and decided I&#39;d make a nice change<br/>
of pace.  Too bad I had just helped a cleric finish off a spectre (my first<br/>
xp on a spectre kill).  Wake up, damn, Halas.  Grabbed spare drum and flute<br/>
and started running.  Having a guild without a cleric over 25th is painful.<br/>
<br/>
Loot corpse, still no sign of the liz shaman so head over to Innothoule.<br/>
Kill dozens of alligators, no skins.  Go into Guk, then Lower.  Help a silly<br/>
29th level monk kill a shin knight.  Cleric there keeps us alive.  First xp<br/>
off a dead froggie, hurrah!  Leave L Guk, zone into Innothoule and am<br/>
greeted by unusually long load time.  Wake up, damn Halas again.  Apparently<br/>
met big ugly troll guard at zone, sigh.  Send tell to cleric to see if he<br/>
will rez, bummer he died 30 seconds after I left and forgot to bind, he&#39;s in<br/>
Mistmoor.  Sigh, get last drum from bank (important later) and run back to<br/>
body.  Have I mentioned not having a 29th level cleric in the guild is<br/>
painful?<br/>
<br/>
Loot corpse.  Run to Freeport.  Get bound.  Get disconnected (important<br/>
later).  Get back in.  Waiting for boat to BB, get free TP from druid!  Run<br/>
over to Unrest to join friend who is killing GDBS&#39;s to get bracelet.  Twelve<br/>
spawn, none drop.  Have to leave for a while.  Run out of Unrest and head<br/>
back to BB.  Meet train coming back down Dagnor&#39;s Alley from BB.  A train in<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s???  Hmmm, 4 Tidal Lords???  Die horribly trying to keep Selo&#39;s up.<br/>
Wake up.  Damn, Halas again.  Hey wait a minute, wth???<br/>
Log off.  Open eqlog.txt, look back and see &quot;bind yourself to area&quot; message.<br/>
Doh!  no save message before disconnect!  Sigh, run to bank.  Doh, no drum!<br/>
Run to Qeynos, flee the aforementioned Lt Dagarok, buy drum.  Run to N<br/>
Karana to catch flight to BB.  Portal opens, Loading, Damn, Halas again???<br/>
I&#39;m not naked though???  Send tell to druid friend.  Not in the world.<br/>
Start running to N Karana again.  Finally get tell from druid, got discoed<br/>
while TP&#39;ing.  He&#39;s in Lavastorm naked and is petitioning.  Get to N Karana,<br/>
am met by naked druid still waiting in queue.  He doesn&#39;t even know what<br/>
zone his corpse is in.  He was bound in Surefall, no corpse in that zone,<br/>
nor Lavastorm, nor N Karana, nor Butcherblock.  He TP&#39;s me to BB, I get my<br/>
corpse.  We TP to Lavastorm and run into Sol Temple where I get my first two<br/>
pieces of Lambent!  I had to log at that point.  He finally got corpse back<br/>
after about 3 hours in the queue.  Somehow his corpse was beneath the world<br/>
in Halas.  Funny, since he&#39;s never been to Halas.<br/>
<br/>

	&quot;Still bound in Halas???&quot;</div>
