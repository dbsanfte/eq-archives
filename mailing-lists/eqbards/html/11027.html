&gt; &gt; Yes it is broken for all classes, but... The other classes still have a <br/>
&gt; &gt; usuable spell, while our song is completely worthless till they fix it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t understand why you all think it&#39;s broken for casters?<br/>
&gt;   They cannot cast levitate on themselves while they are already<br/>
&gt;   levitating - so what?  They never did that before, that I can<br/>
&gt;   tell.  You lose lev, remem lev, and recast lev.  The only person<br/>
&gt;   I saw jamming on levitate like 50 times was a GM to make him rise<br/>
&gt;   high above anyone.  And it&#39;s my belief why they attempted to <br/>
&gt;   correct levitate due to the people who would levitate themselves <br/>
&gt;   over and over to heights where they could easily overcome obstacles.<br/>
&gt;   (The ledge in Permafrost to Lady Vox comes to mind)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>OMG! (picture a light bulb over my head at this point) Your last<br/>
statement caused it. That&#39;s why they screwed up levitate. As usual, this<br/>
is another ill thought out, badly implemented nerf of something they<br/>
consider an exploit for dragon killing. Every bloody nerf lately has<br/>
been because of their precious dragons and this looks like yet another.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to sound paranoid here, but hasn&#39;t anyone else noticed this? Look<br/>
at the transcripts from Smedley&#39;s appearance at the monk sit in. He<br/>
admitted that that was why they nerfed feign death as well, and the<br/>
history of many other nerfs has related right back to the nerfed<br/>
skill/spell/whatever being used to kill dragons or recover bodys semi<br/>
safely after failing. The only difference here is that this one wasn&#39;t<br/>
even tested on bards, just like our songs aren&#39;t even tested before<br/>
being put in production.<br/>
<br/>
If (and I&#39;m not sure it would be worth it yet) bards are going to<br/>
protest with a sit in, it should be over the testing issue, not this<br/>
specific incident. It really looks like either they don&#39;t have someone<br/>
at Verant who &quot;owns&quot; bards, both from a programming and testing<br/>
standpoint, or if they do, it&#39;s someone who is incompetent or doesn&#39;t<br/>
care.<br/>
