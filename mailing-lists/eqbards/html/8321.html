<div id="ygrps-yiv-760055847">Burned out lightstones are for magician research. My friend says they are a<br/>
real hassle since you have to combine me with other non stackable<br/>
components.<br/>
That and he now has a sizable collection of G Lightstones, can never find em<br/>

&gt;like any other NO DROP Items that are Quest related? Although<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know and I&#39;m not sure, I think there is a Quest for them. </span></blockquote></div>
