&gt;    yesterday alone i encountered two separate occasions when i could not <br/>
&gt; sing a song due to another song being what appeared to be &quot;locked&quot; into <br/>
&gt; verse. now the peculiar thing was that one of these times, i was in east <br/>
&gt; commons grouped with another bard, and some others. i decided since i was a <br/>
&gt; little higher than he was, to sing my hymn song instead to heal up the party <br/>
&gt; a wee faster. his song ended. i attempted to start my hymn. did not take... <br/>
&gt; at all. i tried maybe 20 times. grrr... this wasn&#39;t the first time it had <br/>
&gt; happened to me, so i didn&#39;t panic. i simply zoned. it seems to fix the <br/>
&gt; problem, but isn&#39;t necessarily something you want to do while either <br/>
&gt; fighting some mobs, or trying to heal your party while preparing for the <br/>
&gt; next battle.<br/>
&gt;    even while i was running towards the zone, i asked the other bard to sto <br/>
&gt; singing his song again. he did once more. i was maybe half the zone away <br/>
&gt; from him and still kept getting the message &quot;your wounds begin to heal.&quot; <br/>
&gt; hmmm... i left clicked on the icon to try removing the effects that way. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a client/server synch problem causing this.  Due to lag,<br/>
packet loss, a spell (procs used to do this), or hitting the<br/>
buttons too darn fast, the server thinks you&#39;re singing when<br/>
the client thinks you aren&#39;t (or vice versa).  You hit a song<br/>
button to start it, the client tells the server &quot;I&#39;d like to<br/>
start this song,&quot; the server says &quot;No you can&#39;t, you&#39;re<br/>
already singing a song,&quot; so the client turns off the song.  <br/>
People are experiencing the same problem with AE fear<br/>
&quot;sticking&quot; their spell buttons so they can&#39;t cast anything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised to hear healing works this way too - I&#39;d thought<br/>
that only certain effects were client-side (Accelerando, see<br/>
invis, etc).  It&#39;s possible that all the songs (and spells)<br/>
work this way.<br/>
<br/>
To fix it, Verant needs to add better client/server messaging<br/>
and logic.  If the server tells the client that it can&#39;t start<br/>
a song because one is already in play, it should tell it that<br/>
(as opposed to just &quot;you can&#39;t start that song&quot;).  Then the<br/>
client can say &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know I was already playing a<br/>
song.  Well stop it, I&#39;d rather play this song instead.&quot;  <br/>
Considering the extremely severe consequences of not being<br/>
able to start a song or a spell, my guess as to why they don&#39;t<br/>
fix it is the people who wrote the networking code for EQ have<br/>
been shuffled to other jobs inside Sony.<br/>
