<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587516247">We dont have a public explanation of our system (at least to my knowledge)..<br/>
but here is the lowdown:<br/>
<br/>
We use CP &quot;Contest Points&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Basically, loot drops.  There is then a 30 second period in which people can<br/>
&quot;Contest&quot; the loot using their points.  The person with the highest points<br/>
that chooses to contest a lotto then can exclude those who have more than 20<br/>
points less than him.  Then a lotto is run with those remaining (often only<br/>
1 or 2) and the winner has 5 points deducted from his total. You are allowed<br/>
2 contest wins in a month.<br/>
<br/>
If nobody chooses to contest the lotto, then we run a regular lotto.<br/>
<br/>
We have a dynamic list of &quot;ubermobs&quot; which count for CP points and we earn<br/>
one point for each mob, which can add up to 4 or more a night.<br/>
<br/>
Advantages:  <br/>
You don&#39;t lose points for every item.  In some points systems you lose x<br/>
points for x item.  This is unfair as some items are &quot;uber&quot; when you first<br/>
get them and &quot;only ok&quot; when you later win.  Therefore we felt this type of<br/>
system would unfairly punish those who get items later.<br/>
<br/>
Like most point systems, this one rewards those who play most (they have the<br/>
most chance of amassing enough cp points to exclude others) but doens&#39;t<br/>
punish those who play less (just takes longer to accumulate cp points)<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t HaVE to have points to win. In fact, most of our lottoes are NOT<br/>
contested but run as normal.<br/>
<br/>
Disadvantages:  <br/>
Some of our addict level players dont feel it rewards them enough.  <br/>
Points in does in no way equal points out<br/>
Since we get 1 point per mob, if you miss a 4 cp night, it really hurts.<br/>
<br/>
We are only in our 3rd month of this system but it seems to work well and<br/>
has also cuased a HUGE jump in our attendance. Feel free to email me<br/>
personally if you have any questions!<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have a url that for a point-based loot-rules <br/>
&gt; system? My current <br/>
&gt; guild is going through the &quot;big guild&quot; growing pains.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Current problems are based around things like weighing <br/>
&gt; whether full-time <br/>
&gt; should get precedence over part-time players (me being a <br/>
&gt; part-time player <br/>
&gt; have my own opinion on this) and whether certain classes <br/>
&gt; should be excluded <br/>
&gt; from particular loots (us bards tend to get shunted aside for <br/>
&gt; the melee <br/>
&gt; classes as an example).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the record, at this time, I believe that people who <br/>
&gt; participate in more <br/>
&gt; raids should get a weighted advantage over part-timers, but <br/>
&gt; not to the <br/>
&gt; part-timer&#39;s exclusion. As for class exclusions, as a bard <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a sensitive <br/>
&gt; subject to me. I&#39;d prefer no class exclusions myself, just <br/>
&gt; restrict it to <br/>
&gt; those who could actually use the item. Another bard in my <br/>
&gt; guild left when <br/>
&gt; he ranted about being told he could not roll for a <br/>
&gt; breastplate somewhere in <br/>
&gt; Velious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Obviously a sticky situation. Since I&#39;m on the rules committee for my <br/>
&gt; guild, I figured I&#39;d find out how other guilds may have tried <br/>
&gt; to solve <br/>
&gt; these and other dilemmas. Though, one nice thing is that <br/>
&gt; there are 3 bards <br/>
&gt; on the rules committee. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, we all feel it&#39;s best to get rules written into stone <br/>
&gt; that are <br/>
&gt; approved by a large majority of the guild (3/4th I believe). <br/>
&gt; All sorts of <br/>
&gt; problems could be sorted out once we have a set up rules that are not <br/>
&gt; changed arbitrarily.<br/>
