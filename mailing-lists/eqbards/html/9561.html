<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024152462">Um well first off newbies are level 1 20 in my opinion. Then 20 - 30 you go<br/>
through a tranisition where the game really changes for you and then 30+ you<br/>
are no longer a newbie. Besides the point since you were in the arenna<br/>
anyway it would of been a ton quicker to just travel through rathe<br/>
mountains, Ferrott, Innothule, Sro, Oasis, Nro, and then freeport. There are<br/>
ways around this, your just going to have to take the root evil race tanks<br/>
take.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;   On Solusek Ro last night, someone in my party talked to a gm<br/>
&gt;&gt;and apparently the undead spawn in Kithicor was cancelled because the<br/>
&gt;&gt;newbies were complaining about dying.  Don&#39;t know how true this is but<br/>
&gt;&gt;perhaps it is why they stopped the spawn.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If it was just newbies complaining, that&#39;s kind of understandable.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had passed through Beholder&#39;s Maze just because I heard the war was going<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, so then I spend the next 2 hours just trying to get my corpse (again)<br/>
&gt;out of Kithicor.  Now, if this had been held in Highpass as was rumored, at<br/>
&gt;least you can go around it.  Someone please tell me how you&#39;re supposed to<br/>
&gt;travel East without passing through Kithicor?  Well, short of &quot;beg some<br/>
&gt;high-level wizard to teleport you, that&#39;s not always an option, unless<br/>
&gt;Verant decides to set up Wizardly Travel Agency NPC&#39;s in each zone...<br/>
