<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029018782">I was happy this morning.  A druid in the group, after i said i was leaving<br/>
said to get a chanter or a bard and not another warrior.  In her words: &quot;2<br/>
warriors are not as good as one bard&quot;.  It almost brought a tear to my eye<br/>

The best clerics I group with understand that cheal is only mana-efficient<br/>
above a certain hit point<br/>
range, which Bards rarely reach.  They&#39;re also aware of the fact that we<br/>
have maybe 55% the hit points of<br/>
a major tank.  The bad ones don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t like playing with the bad ones.<br/>
I always end up hearing &quot;wow,<br/>
you died fast&quot;.  No kidding.<br/>
