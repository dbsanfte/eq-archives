 </span></blockquote>Bards are ALWAYS useful.  From day 1, we have group-affecting always-on<br/>
songs, never need to meditate for mana, and as we gain more and more<br/>
levels, we become more and more valuable.  I&#39;ve said it before, and I&#39;ll<br/>
say it again: All other classes add to the value of a group, but Bards<br/>
multiply the whole equation.<br/>
