<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073567991">As I&#39;ve stated many times on this list:<br/>
<br/>
Lyrnia Jongleur:  Level 34 bard - Veeshan<br/>
Lyrnia Windsong:  Level 30 Bard - Beta<br/>
Lyrnali Windsinger:  Level 50 Bard - Test<br/>

And you have taken my statement completely out of context.  Did I say<br/>
camping?  I said hunting.  Just because a group is &quot;pulling&quot; doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
they&#39;re camping.  Pulling is the first step in breaking an area to penetrate<br/>
it.  Just go to a plane raid if you don&#39;t agree.  You&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
No this wasn&#39;t flame bait.  But you outright dissed the idea of an upgraded<br/>
charm song.  With Lullaby broken and Pixie Strike about 50% reliable Charm<br/>
is one of our _best_ crowd control songs.  Also, in the expansion there will<br/>
be high level outdoor zones as well.  Charm will be very useful there if we<br/>
get an upgrade.  I don&#39;t know about you but I don&#39;t _always_ want to group.<br/>
Charm gives us a nice ability to solo which is different from fear/chain or<br/>
fear/snare.<br/>
<br/>
If you insist on getting angry everytime someone points out a flaw in your<br/>
logic then you are bound to be miserable.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I really hate it when a bard who hasn&#39;t explored all the uses for the<br/>
more<br/>
&gt;  powerful songs we get disses one as &quot;it&#39;s not useful&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really hate it when a bard doesn&#39;t know another bard and assumes things,<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; turn making themselves look foolish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I have used charm extensively, but now being 50 i hardly ever use it.<br/>
Bats/<br/>
&gt; bugs etc  aren&#39;t charmable, and now guk is a joke. I haven&#39;t been back<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; in months. Sure, upgraded song would allow us to charm higher level<br/>
things,<br/>
&gt; but I am hoping for all new songs, not just rehashes. But oh well,<br/>
replying<br/>
&gt; to this is pretty pointless. . I love how because I post my views on how I<br/>
&gt; would like to play in the expansion it is &quot;wrong&quot;.  I think your post is<br/>
&gt; obvious flame bait. What level are you ? sign your posts please, I<br/>
honestly<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know how to reply seeing as I have no idea where you are coming<br/>
from.<br/>
&gt;         Bleh , go camp something , that seems to be what makes you happy.<br/>
&gt; Fine, I was just saying I would like songs with both form and function. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t play to camp anymore, I play for friends, for raids, and to help out<br/>
&gt; lower level people. I will prolly stay on longer if at least a couple of<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; songs had some sort of RP applicable aspect to them ( the illusion one<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; a great one ) but I doubt you know what RP is , nor have any interest in<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt;         Good luck , get 50 ( you win ! ) then get 60 ( you win ! ) then<br/>
quit<br/>
&gt; and go back to Quake.<br/>
