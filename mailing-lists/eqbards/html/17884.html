<div id="ygrps-yiv-571232890">The last efreeti raid I went on was at 48th lvl.  At that time I decided to<br/>
test lament to see how well it would stick.  So I memed it and tossed it<br/>
into my battle weave.  at 48 with an unbuffed cha of about 115 I was getting<br/>
resisted about 40% of the time.  I am itching to try it now on a single<br/>
party break in to Efreeti :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Much as I&#39;ve enjoyed using it, I can attest to it&#39;s power, <br/>
&gt; and perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; overpower.  In Hate this weekend, my job became crowd <br/>
&gt; control.  Whenever<br/>
&gt; &gt; two things came in on a pull, I would charm the second, <br/>
&gt; command it to /pet<br/>
&gt; &gt; guard here (sit down always made them wander off), run a <br/>
&gt; ways away, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; reassert charm till it broke and retook.  Working in concert with an<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter casting tashania, I could charm anything that came in save<br/>
&gt; &gt; clerics (never tried) and spites.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I finally feel like my old level 30 self again.  This weekend I led an<br/>
&gt; Efreeti run.  On the third pull someone wandered off a little <br/>
&gt; too far and<br/>
&gt; agroed 2 Lava Guardians and 3 Imps right after we had <br/>
&gt; finished off an imp.<br/>
&gt; Our enchanter went OOM after the first of the 3 remaining <br/>
&gt; Imps fell leaving<br/>
&gt; me to crowd control alone.  Using Charm on one of the imps, I <br/>
&gt; was able to<br/>
&gt; keep both imps busy while we were able to finish off the lava <br/>
&gt; elementals and<br/>
&gt; then the imps with no further casualties :).  From that point <br/>
&gt; forward, the<br/>
&gt; enchanter and I had it worked out so that I would charm the <br/>
&gt; extra incoming<br/>
&gt; in each pull and keep them busy while he mezzed singles.  I <br/>
&gt; would then tell<br/>
&gt; him when the charm broke so he could start mezzing my pet.  <br/>
&gt; This had the<br/>
&gt; nice effect of keeping the imp pounding on me instead of the <br/>
&gt; enchanter until<br/>
&gt; he could get the mez to stick as well as giving us an extra <br/>
&gt; hand in battle.<br/>
&gt; We repeated the process every time mez broke as well with <br/>
&gt; great success.<br/>
&gt; The enchanter barely took damage the rest of the break in and <br/>
&gt; used a lot<br/>
&gt; less mana.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was EXTREMELY tempted to attempt pulling for this raid...  <br/>
&gt; I really wanted<br/>
&gt; to try out a combination of Lament and charm to pull on these <br/>
&gt; to see if I<br/>
&gt; could really control the pulling better then the monk.  In <br/>
&gt; the end I went<br/>
&gt; with traditional break in techniques but I&#39;m not so sure the <br/>
&gt; traditional<br/>
&gt; break in is the best way to go anymore.  Have any of you <br/>
&gt; tried Lament on the<br/>
&gt; Imp or Lava guardians or been the puller for the Efreeti <br/>
&gt; raid?  If Lament<br/>
&gt; would work, I really think that a single well balanced party <br/>
&gt; of 6 might be<br/>
&gt; able to handle the break in alone.... :)  If none of you have <br/>
&gt; tried it, I<br/>
&gt; think I might go for it next weekend...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, 2 Efreeti in the first 3 spawns and then we were shut <br/>
&gt; out with only<br/>
&gt; place holders for the next 10 hours...<br/>
