     <br/>
         Just a thought that occurred to me in the shower this morning.  <br/>
     They say that stamina effect you total hit points but just equipping a <br/>
     plus stamina item has no effect.  What happens when you level?  Say <br/>
     just before you level you equip several stamina adding items.  Will <br/>
     this increase the hit points given when you level?  Will you lose the <br/>
     extra points if you take them off?  This could be a nice way to pump <br/>
     up our meager hitpoint total with a little planning and the purchase <br/>
     of some jewelry.  Has any one tried this?  <br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks<br/>
