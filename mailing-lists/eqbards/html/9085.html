<div id="ygrps-yiv-773253118">Has anyone else noticed this strange warping problem lately?  I had never<br/>
experienced it before, but it seems since the last patch, things have been<br/>
&quot;warping&quot; out of range all the time.  I&#39;ve noticed this in the Karanas,<br/>
Oasis, and even in Solusek B last night.  New bug?<br/>

- The pathing and warping in the zone is VERY bad.  You&#39;ll be fighting a<br/>
giant and suddenly<br/>
  it&#39;s just GONE.  Sometimes it warps just a short distance, which is no big<br/>
deal,<br/>
  he&#39;ll come running after you quickly enough.  The real danger is when they<br/>
warp a long<br/>
  distance away, and then never come back.  Never, that is, until you happen<br/>
to walk<br/>
  near him later, and he comes running with his 4 giant friends and the<br/>
little cyclops<br/>
  who wants to be part of the group.</div>
