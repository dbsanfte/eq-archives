<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200118034">To tell the truth... I have neglected to develop my &quot;stacking&quot; or juggling<br/>
skills.  Now I am at a level and in situations where I REALLY need this.  I<br/>
am also re-thinking how I have all my stuff setup - hot key palletes, etc. <br/>
<br/>
But my point is - for all the young bards... learn to play 2 songs at the<br/>
same time - by starting one and then stopping it (it will continue for a<br/>
couple pulses) and starting another. Stopping it when you have two icons up<br/>
and restarting the first one, Rinse, Repeat.<br/>
<br/>
In melee, I try to keep the Anthem de Arms up with either the healing song<br/>
or Elemental Rythmns and Bellow tossed in when possible - love seeing them<br/>
writhe in pain.  I think I am really starting to see some really valuable<br/>
party aids.  Not sure what they think - they used to like the after battle<br/>
healing - not sure if they are seeing the in combat help yet.<br/>
<br/>
My trouble is missed beats and getting stunned drops the songs.  Also I<br/>
guess I am clumbsy and lack rythmn to tap the keys with the pulses -<br/>
practice practice practice and get those skills maxed.<br/>

		Just a hint...you can juggle Selos and Chant of Battle quite<br/>
nicely, if<br/>
		you&#39;re running heavy.<br/>
