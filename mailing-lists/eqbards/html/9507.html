<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685466372">On Solusek Ro last night, someone in my party talked to a gm<br/>
and apparently the undead spawn in Kithicor was cancelled because the<br/>
newbies were complaining about dying.  Don&#39;t know how true this is but<br/>
perhaps it is why they stopped the spawn.<br/>

				I went thru kithicor today and ... no more<br/>
undead.<br/>
<br/>
				As for what they dropped yesterday, the<br/>
NORMAL undead spawns dropped<br/>
				&quot;Tainted&quot; weapons of all varieties, (1hs,<br/>
2hs, piercing, 1hb, 2hb) the<br/>
				only one I heard stats on was:<br/>
<br/>
				Tainted Rapier, Piercing,  Dam 19 delay<br/>
5,several +5 stat bonuses and<br/>
				-5sv disease.<br/>
<br/>
				All the weapons were no-drop, and I didn&#39;t<br/>
get a chance at any of them.<br/>
<br/>
				Side note: everyone in the zone was saying<br/>
&quot;I hope hope leave it this<br/>
				way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake<br/>
rathe when the pets were<br/>
				spawning like crazy and everypne was saying<br/>
&quot;I hope it stays this way&quot;.<br/>
				TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH<br/>
of which Verant KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>
				Makes you wonder if they really WANT us<br/>
happy.<br/>
