<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014359837">Some things have come up that confuse me regarding songs and their<br/>
associated instruments.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Charismatic Carillon was singing only. Why do you play it<br/>
with a flute? I thought our first flute song was the Aquatic Ayre.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Chords of Dissonance was a string song. Why was someone<br/>
playing it with a horn? Could you have meant Denon&#39;s Discord?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all. I just wanted to sort some things out.<br/>
