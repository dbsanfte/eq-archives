We Can Jump When We Run <br/>
( Kitasi )<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye to you my Ranger friend<br/>
We&#39;ve hunted together since we were ninth or tenth<br/>
Together we slew orcs by threes<br/>
Learned of Mooto and Bixies<br/>
Skinned the wolves for clothes for me<br/>
 <br/>
Goodbye my friend its easy to die<br/>
When there&#39;s a griffin screeching in your sky<br/>
Now that he&#39;s swooped down from the air<br/>
Sad little corpses everywhere<br/>
Track to mine, I&#39;ll meet you there<br/>
<br/>
We can jump when we run<br/>
We can flee towards the sun<br/>
But the hills that we climb still do damage<br/>
Over time...<br/>
 <br/>
Goodbye my Cleric please pray for me<br/>
I was the martyr for the party, you see<br/>
You laughed and said that I&#39;d be wrong<br/>
But every time I&#39;d start a song<br/>
They&#39;d beat on me just like a gong<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye my Cleric its easy to die<br/>
When there&#39;s a griffin screeching in your sky<br/>
Now that he&#39;s swooped down from the air<br/>
Yes my corpse is around somewhere<br/>
When you rez me I&#39;ll be there<br/>
<br/>
We can jump when we run<br/>
We can flee towards the sun<br/>
But my memory of the songs like my hit points<br/>
Have all gone. <br/>
 <br/>
All our lives have been fun <br/>
We&#39;ve had reasons to run<br/>
But the zones we couldn&#39;t reach <br/>
Were just lessons life must teach <br/>
<br/>
Goodbye Gnome, oh little one <br/>
You made me a compass so I could find the sun<br/>
And every time that I would frown<br/>
You would always jump around<br/>
And shoot off fireworks without sound<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye little Gnome its easy to die<br/>
When there&#39;s a griffin screeching in your sky <br/>
Now that he&#39;s swooped down from the air<br/>
Graves with flowers everywhere<br/>
If I could Gate mine wouldn&#39;t be there<br/>
 <br/>
We can jump when we run<br/>
We can flee towards the sun<br/>
But the hills that we climb still do damage<br/>
Over time...<br/>
 <br/>
We can jump when we run<br/>
We can flee towards the sun<br/>
But my memory of the songs like my hit points<br/>
Have all gone. <br/>
<br/>
All our lives have been fun <br/>
We&#39;ve had reasons to run<br/>
But the zones we couldn&#39;t reach <br/>
Were just lessons life must teach</div>
