<div id="ygrps-yiv-968902262">I got mine over the weekend too :)  Guild decided to hit LG.  We had the<br/>
Magi room and the Ass/Sup room...  The first thing we killed was the assasin<br/>
and he dropped the guise.  Everyone was disappointed (but me!)<br/>
<br/>
I also became the first person in the guild to die to a dragon!  Buts thats<br/>
another story...<br/>
