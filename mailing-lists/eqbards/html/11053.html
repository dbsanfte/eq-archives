<div id="ygrps-yiv-208137716"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;If (and I&#39;m not sure it would be worth it yet) bards are going to<br/>
&gt;protest with a sit in, it should be over the testing issue, not this<br/>
&gt;specific incident. It really looks like either they don&#39;t have someone<br/>
&gt;at Verant who &quot;owns&quot; bards, both from a programming and testing<br/>
&gt;standpoint, or if they do, it&#39;s someone who is incompetent or doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;care.<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Actually I&#39;d say this is the case regarding testing in general, not just<br/>
bard testing.  Its merely more amplified since no one plays bards regularly<br/>
on the team.  I have seen zero evidence they ever test anything, and much<br/>
evidence to the contrary.  They seem to have the typical old school (and I<br/>
mean really old, like 25+ years ago) mentality of, &quot;Hey it compiled ok.<br/>
Testing complete.&quot;<br/>
