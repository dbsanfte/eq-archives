<div id="ygrps-yiv-770093208">Yep, Freeport is your closest binding place, unless you relish the thought <br/>
of being killed by trolls and ogres when you reincarnate.  It&#39;s about a 15 <br/>
minute run from Freeport back to Cazic singing the Accelerando with no <br/>
drum.<br/>
<br/>
Cazic geography (and some spoilers)...<br/>
<br/>
Bouncer Hurd occasionally hangs out near the entrance to Cazic, so watch <br/>
out for him as you approach the zone.  Also, he will sometimes end up right <br/>
at the zone point, having chased someone in there.<br/>
<br/>
When you enter Cazic you will be in a wide hallway.  (Note that the zone <br/>
point is misconfigured -- the hall looks like it points the opposite <br/>
direction before you zone.)  You will occasionally zone in to find youself <br/>
in the midst of a nasty train, especially during prime hours, so have your <br/>
finger on the back-up key just in case.  If no one has trained things <br/>
there, the zone area should be quiet, with no monsters in range.  At the <br/>
corner one lizard broodling spawns; they are around 10th level or so, so <br/>
won&#39;t bother you.  Turning the corner you will see two more broodlings and <br/>
a set of double doors.<br/>
<br/>
Through the doors lies the main courtyard.  To your right is a single door <br/>
leading to the maze; this is a good spot to pull defender and sentinel <br/>
lizards.  Go deep enough into the maze and you&#39;ll find the spot where the <br/>
wizard&#39;s Cazic Gate spell drops them.  (That spell is a death trap for <br/>
unwary wizards.)  Also through the maze is a large pyramid known as the <br/>
Lost Temple, populated with higher level lizards.<br/>
<br/>
On the same wall as the double doors is a ladder.  Up there, through a <br/>
door, and down and around you&#39;ll find a room with a square water-filled <br/>
shaft.  This leads down to an underground lake in a cavern.  At higher <br/>
levels, a group can camp by the tank and pull gators for very good <br/>
experience, but they&#39;re too nasty for you at 20th.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the courtyard again, at the other end is another pair of double <br/>
doors.  Don&#39;t get confused and run that way if you&#39;re trying to zone.  One <br/>
of the passages back there leads up to the ledge on that end; the other <br/>
leads back deeper to some open areas and another pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
On the ledge at that end are two more water filled shafts.  The righthand <br/>
one leads to another gator tank, with higher level gators, and further <br/>
through there lies the home of the Avatar of Fear.  I don&#39;t know what&#39;s <br/>
down the lefthand one.<br/>
<br/>
On the left wall of the courtyard at the far end is another single door. <br/>
 Through this and to the right is the throne room, the favorite camping <br/>
spot for groups in their upper 20s to lower 30s.  This consists of another <br/>
courtyard with shallow steps in the middle leading up to a wide opening. <br/>
 The throne and its guards are easily visible through the opening.  If no <br/>
one is camping this area, entering the room will get 4 or 5 lizards on you <br/>
in a hurry, since they spawn near the door.  The usual camping spots are <br/>
the corners.  If the room is fully spawned, pulling the throne will get you <br/>
2 gorillas, 2 mid-sized lizards, one large lizard, and whatever is on the <br/>
throne.  This may be one of the big lizards, or one of the Tae Ew lizards <br/>
(Templar or Diviner).  The latter are the ones that drop lizard cloaks and <br/>
mantles, and occasionally rubicite legs and bracers, which is why it is <br/>
almost always camped.  To the right of the throne area (looking in) is a <br/>
door that leads to the upper floors of the building.  Pulling from there <br/>
can be deadly depending on the strength of your group, since you&#39;ll usually <br/>
get lizards in groups of 2 to 4 with some high level ones mixed in.<br/>
