<div id="ygrps-yiv-304196903">Here are my base stats:<br/>
<br/>
(was naked running back to sk - dont ask - trying to solo a wounded darter)<br/>
<br/>
Half Elf (MOSTLY Elf - very little hummie -- really!)<br/>
<br/>
Str 75<br/>
Sta 70<br/>
Agi 90<br/>
Dex 95<br/>
Wis 75<br/>
Int 80<br/>
Cha 90<br/>
<br/>
Had I known better - I woulda put no extra into either wis or int and put more in Str Agi & maybe Sta and Cha.  For bards, wis and int only affect trade skills - which get nerfed so often - hard to be interested anymore.  Maybe they affect speed of memming or scribing but so what.  Maybe they affect ease or speed of kicking off a song or ability to play a new song - but Str affects how much weight you can carry which relates to how much armor you can wear which is how you get AC - duh.<br/>
