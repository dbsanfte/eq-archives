 </span></blockquote>Yes, bellow interrupts spells.  But it only works on low level PC&#39;s<br/>
really. The reason is that Bellow pushes the target just a little bit and<br/>
that little bit of movement is enough to interrupt PC casters with low<br/>
channeling skill.  Almost all mobs that you encounter after bellow have<br/>
insanely high channeling skill, so bellow really doesn&#39;t do much on them.<br/>
(Since they can summon a pet as you and 4 other people are<br/>
beating/blasting on them, it&#39;s reasonable that the 2 inches of movement<br/>
cuased by bellow is going to seem like a joke to them)  I&#39;m not sure when<br/>
bellow would stop working on PC&#39;s, due to their channeling skill<br/>
increasing.  But at low to mid teens, bellow is deadly to PC spell<br/>
casters.</div>
