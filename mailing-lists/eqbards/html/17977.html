<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357691175">I noticed very unreliabel results with it also last<br/>
night in highkeep against everything i tried it on.<br/>
from low blue outlooks/guards to the raiders which are<br/>
still red.  It normally works well for me except<br/>
against raiders and warriors, which are occasionally<br/>
too high lvl i think. Lvl 28, charisma approx 135.<br/>

&gt; today.  I was in <br/>
&gt; frenzied last night and I got a ton of very early<br/>
&gt; wear-off messages on <br/>
&gt; this song.  I was wondering whether I had found a<br/>
&gt; sour spot in my <br/>
&gt; twisting cycle (e.g., I was twisting just fast<br/>
&gt; enough to get the song <br/>
&gt; starts/song stops problem) or if this was a problem<br/>
&gt; with Chains itself.  <br/>
&gt; At my level, the stuff we were fighting is mostly<br/>
&gt; normal blue.  The song <br/>
&gt; ought to work pretty well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now that we are getting messages when our song<br/>
&gt; effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; noticed that our snare song amost never lasts the<br/>
&gt; full duration. Many times<br/>
&gt; &gt; it wears off as soon as I finish singing it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if any of you were having the same<br/>
&gt; problem and whether or<br/>
&gt; &gt; not this is by design or a bug that we should<br/>
&gt; bring to the attention of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; powers that be.<br/>
