Weren&#39;t you the one who shot down my idea of faction hits for<br/>
getting other players killed?  It would really help with<br/>
situations like this (whether it was intentional or<br/>
accidental), forcing people to consider the consequences of<br/>
their escape attempt on others instead of only their own skin.<br/>
