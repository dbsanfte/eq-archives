<div id="ygrps-yiv-14541729">I doubt the change to ADM would have affected Aria.  Its possible, but<br/>
unlikely.  The problem with ADM didn&#39;t involve its playing time, it stills<br/>
plays like it did before, it just actually does something now while its<br/>
playing.  And yes, if I changed a subroutine I knew was used by other<br/>
processes I sure as hell would make sure what I did didn&#39;t break those other<br/>
processes.  If I didn&#39;t I would soon be looking for a new job.  In fact, now<br/>
that I think of it, that is my new job.  I spend 80% of my time making sure<br/>
that exactly that sort of thing does not occur.  Something Verant obviously<br/>
cannot be bothered to do.  Come on remember those three DoT&#39;s that when<br/>
implemented would only work if you cast them on yourself, their testing<br/>
record speaks for itself and it is mute.<br/>

Actually, I can see why it slipped by.  They were changing ADM, and<br/>
whoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>
coded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>
it.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>
*every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>
the patch would be rather long in getting out.  That bug will likely<br/>
be fixed in the next patch.<br/>
