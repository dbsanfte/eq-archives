&gt; it.  I proceeded to try and sing it, and could never get it going.<br/>
&gt; Nothing but one missed note after the other.  Is this common?  Am I<br/>
&gt; doing something wrong?  Also, do I need a mouthpiece for my flute?  I<br/>
&gt; bought the flute from the Bard&#39;s Guild, and eqipped it as usual before<br/>
&gt; I tried the song.  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

to both sing it and play it on the flute.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest fighting your way through all the missed notes until the song<br/>
takes hold, then trying again.<br/>
