<b>Subject:</b> PLEASE READ:  CONCERNING ADS <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360761758">OK first let me say I apologize for the ads at the top of the <br/>
messages. <br/>
Now a quick history lesson . . .<br/>
Many moons ago I started this list on a service called onelist.<br/>
This service was swallowed by egroups.<br/>
This service was recently taken into the folds of Yahoo!<br/>
AHHHHH I can hear the groans already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last month I was sent this message (in breif)<br/>
<br/>
  -&gt;  eGroups is an advertiser supported service. We are able to <br/>
bring you this service, for free, because we sell banner ads on the <br/>
eGroups Web site, as well as either text or banner ads on group <br/>
messages (the text ads are discreet, 3-line blurbs inserted at the <br/>
bottom of the list messages).<br/>
<br/>
For group owners who do not wish to have ads on messages in their <br/>
groups, we offer a &quot;No Advertising Option.&quot; For $4.95 (US) per month <br/>
(payable in a single annual payment of $59.40), we will exclude ads <br/>
from the messages for your group  &lt;-  <br/>
 <br/>
Now at the time I recieved this 3 page email I did not think it would <br/>
effect the mailing lists I own.  But after reading some of the posts <br/>
to the list I have made the descision that if you want the ads gone I <br/>
will pay to have them removed.  Please do not respond to the list <br/>
instead follow the link to the polls page and cast your vote, <br/>

<br/>
I won&#39;t act unless you want me to.<br/>
