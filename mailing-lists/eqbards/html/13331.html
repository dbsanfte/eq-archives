<br/>
*Announcements*<br/>
<br/>
The Plane of Sky is now open!!!  As a reminder to our customers, the<br/>
alternate planes of reality do not necessarily follow the same physical or<br/>
ethereal rules as Norrath proper.  Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
Today is patch day! The EverQuest servers have been patched with the<br/>
following changes:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*General Changes / Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- Some changes have been made to the exit of Nagafen&#39;s Lair into the<br/>
Lavastorm Mountains.  This will hopefully reduce if not solve the bug that<br/>
causes people to fall into lava when exiting Nagafen&#39;s Lair.  Please let us<br/>
know how this goes.<br/>
<br/>
- Due to feedback received from the customers concerning the density of fog<br/>
during rainstorms, visibility has been increased.<br/>
<br/>
- All drops of steel weapons have been replaced with higher quality<br/>
fine-steel weapons of the same type.  This change was made to reduce the<br/>
amount of new currency coming into the world at the mid-to-upper levels.<br/>
The fine-steel weapons are in all cases superior to the steel weapons that<br/>
were dropping, they just sell to vendors for less money.<br/>
<br/>
- Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items.   This<br/>
was done to correct issues that could arise from people chain-casting these<br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
- The safe-point (the point which you return if you fall below the world) in<br/>
Kithicor has been moved near the entrance to Rivervale, a safer part of the<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
- Corrected a bug that caused AC to be improperly displayed for higher level<br/>
  characters.  Your AC should now reflect all of your items.<br/>
<br/>
Additional Bug Fixes:<br/>
<br/>
- Corrected a bug in the client that could cause a crash if you were spammed<br/>
with emotes by someone on your /ignore list.<br/>
- Corrected a bug that allowed ships to move faster when disarmed<br/>
- Corrected a bug that caused the Aqualung to lose its charges if dropped on<br/>
the ground.<br/>
- Fire Giants in Nagafen&#39;s Lair should now recover properly when stuck in<br/>
lava.  Consider yourself warned.<br/>
- The Instill Doubt skill has been disabled on the PvP servers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Changes*<br/>
<br/>
- Shadow Vortex is now a &quot;drain&quot; spell.<br/>
- Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs<br/>
- Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced.  In addition, the<br/>
spell is less resistable.<br/>
- Angstlich&#39;s Appalling Screech had its radius increased slightly.<br/>
- All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius slightly<br/>
increased<br/>
- Yonder will now interact better with levitate.<br/>
- Form of the Great Wolf had its speed component increased.<br/>
- Terrorize Animal had its casting time reduced and is less resistable.<br/>
- New magician&#39;s spells have been added.  Check your spell vendors.<br/>
- Reoccurring Amnesia has been made more effective.<br/>
- NPCs will now treat the &quot;Cancel Magic&quot; series of spells as hostile.<br/>
Previously, NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their buffs before<br/>
attacking.  Now they will.<br/>
- The Fear and Charm series of spells now properly notify the caster when<br/>
they break.  No, seriously, we&#39;re certain this time.<br/>
- Harmtouch now does more damage beginning at level 41.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Levitation Changed*<br/>
<br/>
Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items, the code<br/>
that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while it was active is no<br/>
longer necessary and has been backed out.  The Levitate spell may now be<br/>
refreshed while the spell is in use.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Quests and Items*<br/>
<br/>
- The Armor of Ro should be more obtainable.  We will continue to evaluate<br/>
and adjust the rarity of other class-specific armor components to make the<br/>
pieces obtainable in a reasonable amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
- We have changed the reward of a newbie quest in the Qeynos area from a<br/>
level 49 scroll to a level 1 scroll.  The issuance of a level 49 scroll was<br/>
a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters to amass an abnormally<br/>
large amount of currency.<br/>
<br/>
- The stats on the reward for the Rogue Redemption quest have been increased<br/>
to make it better than the favorite dropped-weapon for the level range.<br/>
<br/>
- Ravenscale boots will now drop as frequently as other Ravenscale items.<br/>
<br/>
- The Mask of Deception may now be equipped by the appropriate races.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Fletching Update*<br/>
<br/>
All arrows created with the new Silver-Tipped Arrowhead (formerly the Bladed<br/>
Arrowhead) are now magical in nature, and may be used versus magical<br/>
creatures.  All existing items in your possession will automatically morph<br/>
into the new magical items.  Additionally, each successful attempt to create<br/>
magical arrows will yield 10 arrows instead of the previous 5.  As such, the<br/>
vendor buy-back value has been decreased accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Paw*<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty of Paw has been decreased.  We found that many of the gnolls<br/>
in the new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the dungeon more difficult<br/>
than it should have been for the desired level target.  Please let us know<br/>
how this change affects the viability of the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*The Plane of Fear*<br/>
<br/>
The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear have been increased.  This<br/>
change was supposed to have occurred in the last patch, however the data was<br/>
not exported.  It has been tested and equipment drops are now occurring at a<br/>
much higher rate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*The Plane of Hate*<br/>
<br/>
The item-drop percentages on roaming and fast-spawning NPCs in the Plane of<br/>
Hate have been decreased.  Previously, these NPCs used the same<br/>
drop-percentages as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing overall drop percentages<br/>
to be extremely high.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no longer fall for illusions, and<br/>
tend to &quot;Hate&quot; everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Monk Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
A monk&#39;s speed in hand-to-hand combat will now improve with level, beginning<br/>
in the high 20s. This will result in higher level monks doing substantially<br/>
more damage in a given time-frame.<br/>
<br/>
Though this change does increase the power of the average monk, it should be<br/>
stressed that the monk is now even more in need of true tank classes who<br/>
have the ability to taunt upset creatures off them. We want to stress that<br/>
the &quot;taunt factor&quot; of a monks fist has NOT been increased, though it may<br/>
appear so due to your increased damage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Paladin/Shadowknight Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
Paladins and Shadowknights now have a higher hitpoints and higher skill caps<br/>
on Bash and Taunt.<br/>
<br/>
The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins and SKs over level<br/>
25.  This was done because the Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the same HP<br/>
base, which upon further consideration is not compatible with our vision of<br/>
those classes&#39; roles.  This change will basically put Paladin and SK HPs<br/>
midway (in terms of Hit Points) between rangers and warriors of the same<br/>
race.<br/>
<br/>
The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular, Paladins had<br/>
difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors<br/>
due to their lower damage output.  Though the Paladin and SK will never<br/>
equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition to some<br/>
of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks.<br/>
<br/>
Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren&#39;t switching to two-handed<br/>
weapons, choosing instead to continue using the bash skill. Most warriors,<br/>
being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most part, do not worry about<br/>
bash and instead opt for slam, which uses the same skill. Paladins are<br/>
typically the only characters who use a shield throughout their lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Rogue Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
Whenever a rogue is invisible, whether by spell, potion, or skill, they are<br/>
now also invisible to undead.<br/>
<br/>
This change was made to add a definite class-advantage to the rogue,<br/>
allowing them to do something that no other class could do.  It is the first<br/>
step in a multi-step process to improve the rogue class.<br/>
<br/>
*Wizard Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic, Cold, or Fire)<br/>
much less likely to be resisted.  This effect stacks with the Staff of<br/>
Temperate Flux and enchanter, shaman, and magician resistance debuffs.<br/>
<br/>
This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards at about the<br/>
level that all spell-casting classes start seeing their resistance rates go<br/>
up.  Wizards specialize in direct magical damage. It makes sense that they<br/>
should be better at causing that damage than the other classes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Bard Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
Bards will now receive the Meditate skill at 10th level.  This skill will be<br/>
granted automatically the first time a bard zones after reaching 10th level,<br/>
and cannot be trained further.  It will have the effect of decreasing the<br/>
amount of time that it takes a Bard to memorize their songs.  Previously, it<br/>
would take 50th level bards upwards of 2 minutes to memorize a song.  Now it<br/>
is much faster.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Druid Enhancement*<br/>
<br/>
The skill cap on a Druid&#39;s tracking skill has been increased.  This change<br/>
was implemented based upon general public opinion that the former cap was<br/>
far too low for the skill to be even marginally viable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Feign Death and Pets*<br/>
<br/>
After a serious discussion regarding the Necromancer&#39;s Feign Death tactic,<br/>
as well as reviewing public opinion on the matter, we have implemented a<br/>
change.  As we would like everyone to understand why we feel this change was<br/>
necessary, here is a summary of the issue:<br/>
<br/>
Problem:<br/>
Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances,<br/>
providing offensive tactics that are abusive.  For this ability to remain<br/>
balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as invisibility.  Offensive<br/>
tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting a saving throw<br/>
verses the effect.  Since creatures do NOT get a direct save verses feign<br/>
death (as you cast it on yourself), and since you can retry the combat once<br/>
you have feigned death, there is very little risk to necromancer himself.<br/>
As this tactic involves charming an NPC and turning it against another NPC,<br/>
which could be part of the same spawn, it allows for Necromancers to solo<br/>
MUCH bigger rooms than any other class could.  This situation is well beyond<br/>
what would preserve game balance for any other class (soloing the<br/>
Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for example).<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death tactic is<br/>
abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of Lower<br/>
Guk.  The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord himself.<br/>
Using the current system, a level 50 Necro can easily solo the room at<br/>
virtually no risk to himself. The Necro can get into the room quite easily<br/>
with Invis To Undead.  To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one Bok<br/>
and Charms the other.  When the Ghoul Lord rushes him, he feigns.  The Lord<br/>
then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking considerable damage<br/>
during the fight.  The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul Lord returns to its<br/>
spawn point.  When the necromancer gets back  up, he is in no danger of<br/>
being attacked due to the way Feign Death works now. He then charms the 2nd<br/>
Bok and Feigns again.  The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is killed.  When<br/>
the Necromancer gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord AND nearly<br/>
full mana.  The Lord is now an easy kill, and the Necro collects his special<br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
Solution:<br/>
Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<br/>
suicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<br/>
adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we<br/>
do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necro&#39;s from exploiting key<br/>
spawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately<br/>
break Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will NOT be affected.  While<br/>
this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet,<br/>
it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that<br/>
charming an NPC does.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Manastone Changed*<br/>
<br/>
The players have raised many concerns about the power of the Manastone,<br/>
which no longer drops.  They cite that people without a Manastone are not as<br/>
welcome in expeditions to the outer planes and other areas as people with<br/>
them.  Since dropping additional Manastones via quest or removing them from<br/>
the existing populace is not desirable, we&#39;ve decided to make it so that the<br/>
Manastone will no longer function in the alternate planes.  Furthermore, it<br/>
will not function in any of the zones included with the Kunark Expansion.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize to those adversely affected by this change. Our general goal is<br/>
to avoid making changes to items in peoples&#39; possession, however we felt<br/>
this change was, all things considered, warranted and for the benefit of the<br/>
game as a whole.<br/>
