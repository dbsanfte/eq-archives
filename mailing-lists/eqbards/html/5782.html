pulses sung, 10 per pulse for 3 pulses strung.  Grab a buddy and head for<br/>
a PvP zone, ungroup and have them watch their health.  I prefer chords to<br/>
bellow whenever possible because it always inflicts the same amount of<br/>
damage, and that amount is higher than an equivalent level bellow.<br/>

For a level-by-level formula of damage, I turn the floor over to Mr. Kim.<br/>

P.s.- Highly recommend outside view zoomed out when using this song; it<br/>
has a very short radius, but things will walk on top of you during<br/>
battles, and if you hit&#39;em with a pulse, they will start attacking.<br/>

P.p.s.- I had heard chords was stackable with itself (i.e. you could have<br/>
it pulse twice with lute and end up damaging them for 60), but was never<br/>
able to.</div>
