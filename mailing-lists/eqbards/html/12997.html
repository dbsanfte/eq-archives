  Darkwood Piccolo should be renamed to God Flute.  Anytime anyone<br/>
  asks me a question about it they always refer to it as my &#39;god flute&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
  heh.  Did a show&tell of a friend&#39;s fbss and my flute last night.<br/>
  I need to pick up a fbss for myself soon, all the times I&#39;ve gone<br/>
  I&#39;ve been just to damn generous, and pass it off to a guild ranger<br/>
  or guild paladin even if they just got there.  With the flute, the<br/>
  bard with 170 some cha, was pixie stunning clerics and interrupting<br/>
  about 75% of the time.  25% of the time a yk or bash interrupted.<br/>
  Only twice have I seen a cleric get off a complete heal.  I mean,<br/>
  24 people all buffed, speeded up, etc doing god knows how much dmg<br/>
  per second, and this mob&#39;s channelling lets it cast?  hah.<br/>
<br/>
  I estimate the Clerics of Innoruuk to have around 10k hp.  It takes<br/>
  between 45 to 60 seconds (usually closer to 60) to drop one with 24<br/>
  people (approx 12 melee).  Anyway, that&#39;s over 150 dmg per second.  <br/>
  And a complete heal takes what? 12 seconds to cast?  I&#39;d like to <br/>
  see a PC cast through 1800 points of damage, hehe.  Most I&#39;ve ever<br/>
  heard of was someone evac&#39;ing with 400 dmg done to them.  That&#39;s<br/>
  with Specialize and Channeling maxxed.  So this Cleric of Innoruuk<br/>
  must have like 800 channeling, and 800 specialization: alteration.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, the god flute tooter.</div>
