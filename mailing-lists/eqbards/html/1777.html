<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909159007">what i have found to be the best way to use it is that whoever is fetching,<br/>
have them as your target.  once they return AND have engaged the target in<br/>
melee, just hit /as and you will be fighting same target and be in melee as<br/>
well.<br/>

Assist works great for my party.  The only thing that might be called a bug<br/>
about<br/>
it, is if you are already fighting the same monster and you hit your assist<br/>
hotkey<br/>
again, you may end up targetting the player you meant to assist, but then,<br/>
that<br/>
would really be an operator error anyway (since you would be assisting the<br/>
mob that<br/>
is fighting the player in your party, assist is actually working as it<br/>
should).  I<br/>
don&#39;t think Assist is buggy.  Probably people are using it wrong.  If you<br/>
have a<br/>
main tank that is usually in your party, you can make a hotkey just for that<br/>
character (/assist tank).  That saves time targeting them and reduces the<br/>
liklihood<br/>
of errors.<br/>
