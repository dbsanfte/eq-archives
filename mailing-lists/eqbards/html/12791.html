 </span></blockquote>The actual way that this works is it increases your FACTION with that <br/>
person&#39;s FACTION.  So, let&#39;s say you&#39;re in Freeport.  If you target a <br/>
Militia, and fire the CCC, it will give you increase to FreeportMilitia <br/>
faction for the duration of your stay in the zone.  If you turn around and <br/>
target a member of the merchants instead, your faction from the <br/>
FreeportMilitia will vanish, and you will get a bonus to your FACTION with <br/>
FreeportMerchants.<br/>
<br/>
The instrument is a significant improvement to both range AND power.  I <br/>
have never seen the faction end, so I don&#39;t know if it fades.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a real-world example from shortly after I&#39;d first gotten the <br/>
song.   I was living in Greater Faydark, hadn&#39;t been in Lesser Faydark very <br/>
much, so I didn&#39;t know anything about Brownies.  Someone rather young came <br/>
started shouting for help retrieving his corpse, and as it was very late, <br/>
no one was answering, so I did.  He asked me to meet him at the entrance to <br/>
Lesser Faydark, that a Brownie had killed him.  As I had never killed a <br/>
Brownie, I assumed my faction with them would be, at very worst, neutral, <br/>
so I figured I could just go grab his stuff and run.  Little did I know <br/>
that that was a whole Brownie city.  I get close and see &quot;A Brownie Guard <br/>
begins casting&quot; and next thing I know is &quot;Loading... please wait....&quot;<br/>
WELL!<br/>
Not very friendly, are they?<br/>
To make a long story short (because it&#39;s time to go home ;) as I was <br/>
running back and trying to decide to help this poor newbie who was nearly <br/>
in tears, afraid he was going to lose his corpse and stuff, as well as <br/>
getting my own stuff back, when I suddenly remembered something someone had <br/>
told me about the Charismatic Carrilon... and how it would make some <br/>
unfriendly people friendly.....<br/>
After comforting the bereaved young one, I travelled quickly to the site of <br/>
the Brownie Village, and snuck as close as I thought I could without <br/>
enraging any Brownies... Firing up my new song, I was rewarded with a glow <br/>
and the appropriate message, and when conning, sure enough, the Brownie <br/>
guards were indifferent.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure how long the effect lasted, so I flanicked and peed... er.. <br/>
panicked and fled with the contents of the little guy&#39;s corpse., while <br/>
dragging my own.  A few moments later, he was reunited with his stuff, and <br/>
shortly thereafter, I was as well.  What a deal ;)<br/>
