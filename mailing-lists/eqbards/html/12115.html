<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007628710"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Things have changed (bug or nerf or just me?) but killing gnolls only lowers<br/>
&gt; my gnoll faction - but then someone pointed out that my other factions maybe<br/>
&gt; maxxed out and that is why I no longer see any raises for the other<br/>
&gt; factions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  There is not a one to one matching for faction adjustments.<br/>
<br/>
  For example (and I have tested this):<br/>
<br/>
  Kill corrupt guard McCluskey, always lowers corruptqeynosguards.<br/>
  And I&#39;ve killed him more than 300 or 400 times, easily.<br/>
<br/>
  Killed Guard Justyn, raises corruptqeynosguards, lowers qeynosguards.<br/>
<br/>
  Kill McCluskey again _does not_ raise qeynosguards back up.<br/>
<br/>
  You cannot just beat the crap out of McCluskey and expect to <br/>
  get your faction back with Justyn.  At one point it started<br/>
  to work, but when you max out (theorectically) in one direction <br/>
  the opposite doesn&#39;t affect it.  I say theorectically because<br/>
  my faction still says it is lowering with corruptguards, yet<br/>
  I know for certain it&#39;s completely max&#39;d out at the low end.<br/>
<br/>
  You can try this with Gnolls too.<br/>
<br/>
  Do something that pisses off the MerchantofQeynos (with a completely<br/>
  max&#39;d out high favor with them) and then kill a Gnoll, you will not<br/>
  redeem positive merchant faction.  <br/>
<br/>
  Not sure why this is, but it happens to all factions when they are<br/>
  at the most imbalanced status.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
