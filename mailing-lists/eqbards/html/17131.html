<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977392366">This is a truly innane thought, but, like so many things in my life comes<br/>
with a voiceover that whispers &quot;what if it just worked?&quot;.<br/>
Is there any plane that on, say a weekend night, I would have ANY chance of<br/>
getting to and offering NagaThin Muffins N&#39; Milk in shout and THEN (here&#39;s<br/>
the hard part) getting back alive? I know it is different on different<br/>
servers but is it even remotely possible?<br/>
<br/>
All I need is the screenshot, I SURE don&#39;t need to stay there for any length<br/>
of time...<br/>
