carefully about them because you&#39;re stuck with them for life.<br/>

25, you&#39;d gain str and wis, maybe dex and sta.  But as you<br/>
went from 25 to 50 you&#39;d lose str, dex, sta, agi, and maybe<br/>
int while gaining wis.  There are actually systems that do<br/>
this, usually coupling older (decreased stats) with wiser<br/>
(more skills) and vice versa.  But that&#39;s beyond the scope of<br/>
this list.<br/>
