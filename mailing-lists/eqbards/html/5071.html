<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011929683">Oh yeah is right, they already did this.  24 of us took him on last night<br/>
(we knew he was fixed but had to try), we were all level 45 to 50, and he<br/>
pretty much laughed and laid waste to us all.  we maybe got 10 to 15% dmg on<br/>
him.  he now hits for double 235&#39;s (i think 185 was the max before) and his<br/>
FAVORITE thing is to knock you back a few hundred feet for some dmg (like a<br/>
horizontal gravity flux) then summon you to his feet to bash you some more.<br/>
i think we will stick to everything else in the zone, all the normal stuff,<br/>
dracoliche is still easy enough, everything guarding Cazic is doable, and<br/>
leave Cazic alone shouting to the zone to beware, cause now you better cause<br/>
its true.<br/>

&gt; Oh yeah, he said Cazic (the God in the Fear Plane?) is gonna <br/>
&gt; be &quot;fixed&quot; real<br/>
&gt; soon now. So, you high levs better git your killin in while <br/>
&gt; the killin is<br/>
&gt; good - sounds like they are gonna un-nerf him.<br/>
