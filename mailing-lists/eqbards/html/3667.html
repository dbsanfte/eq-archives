&gt;You could also try such songs as Lullaby when you see the poor fellow<br/>
&gt;being attacked by more than one mob.  Or any of the other slow the mob<br/>
&gt;down songs like Melodic Binding.  The difference from Druid, Cleric and<br/>
&gt;Shaman spells is the fact that most people fail to see that you are<br/>
&gt;actually helping them.  Do they notice the mob is bound by strands of<br/>
&gt;music?  Not really, but it is still gratifying to do the deed.  Who know<br/>
&gt;if they noticed, who knows if they will ever help you?  Instant<br/>
&gt;gratification isn&#39;t there , but you never know where kindness can come<br/>
&gt;from =).<br/>
