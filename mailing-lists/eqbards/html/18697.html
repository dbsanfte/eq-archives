<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690420331">I have died twice in Firiona Vie. I have had groupmates die a lot<br/>
more trying to get through there (esp when on corpse recovery) It is<br/>
possible Selo&#39;s is fast enough that you don&#39;t aggro stuff. I have generally<br/>
gone through as my enchanter, who has no movement speed increase :( IF I<br/>
can get a Spirit of Wolf, though (without bugging people too much. I don&#39;t<br/>
want to be one of those the druids are laughing at behind their hands)<br/>
I do, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever gotten killed then.<br/>
<br/>
I do know it is generally going through Firiona Vie that causes<br/>
my guildies to declare Kunark a deathtrap and head abck to<br/>

&gt;Do you really have problems with them?  I have never even had one look<br/>
&gt;at twice at me, they don;t seem to be very aggressive...  Especially<br/>
&gt;with Selo&#39;s I never thought of them as a threat...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The hardest part of Kunark is getting through Firiona Vie without<br/>
&gt;&gt; being slaughtered by the spiders.<br/>
