<div id="ygrps-yiv-193457597">Aye, Verant did move accounts, not chars, so every char got moved if you<br/>
registered one.  But hey..  I&#39;ve got a guy in my guild that play three<br/>
characters simultaneously and two or three others people that play two<br/>
simultaneously.  That takes multiple accounts and multiple computers.  When<br/>
a guild officer creates a mule, it&#39;s handy that it&#39;s not on the same account<br/>
so that he can trade items with himself.  Two computers and DSL will work<br/>
just fine for that.<br/>
<br/>
So the next time your significant other is giving you grief about EQ, tell<br/>
them it *could* be worse.  ;-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; see.  In fact a couple of guild officer&#39;s mule characters were<br/>
&gt; left behind<br/>
&gt; &gt; with loads of runes, pages, gate potions, dragon loot, fbss&#39;s, ykeshas,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; that he had stored..  yech.  So I&#39;ve got to say this wasn&#39;t for the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought that they were moving all the players chars?? or was this a<br/>
&gt; separate account??? (that would be the only explanation I&#39;m thinking).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck and enjoy!!<br/>
