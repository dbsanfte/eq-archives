<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001033596">Hehe... I thought I was the only one that had read these (speaking<br/>
figuratively).  Actually, I think I still have Bard and Bard II.  I<br/>
loved the first one... but thought the second one was really weak and<br/>
didn&#39;t bother with the 3rd.  I would recommend the first one, though,<br/>
just for the entertainment.  <br/>

&gt;There are a series of books from the 80s I believe &gt;called Bard, Bard<br/>
 </span></blockquote>II and Bard III.  I believe the &gt;name of the author was David Taylor,<br/>
but I have to &gt;warn you, I&#39;m pulling the name from the deep recesses<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I recall, I quite liked the first book, and &gt;thought the other two<br/>

the time. :)<br/>
