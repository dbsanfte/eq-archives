<b>Subject:</b> RE: PoF pulling <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135248897">I was helping a friend kill spec&#39;s early one morning outside the cave and 3<br/>
or 4 guilds were marshalling for a PoF raid (first one on our server to be<br/>
done a group of guilds rather than by the one power-guild that normally did<br/>
it.)  I do believe that they used a similar tactic. I think they had a monk<br/>
go in and feign - then he train/feigned the crap away (this was pre-feign<br/>
nerf I do believe.)  Then they zoned the raiders in one - by - one and they<br/>
ran to some predetermined spot and camped (if they lived) and logged into<br/>
the chat room (passworded).  When they got everyone one in the zone, they<br/>
uncamped and started breaking the zone.<br/>
<br/>
This raid was led btw by a notoriously disliked lev 50 wizard.  Where he got<br/>
the tactic from was a surprise to me because the previous time I overheard<br/>
him yapping about planes - he was staunchly in favor of &quot;everyone zone at<br/>
once and fight it out.&quot;  But I guess he snuck into several other plane raids<br/>
(the guilds doing the raid had to get GM&#39;s to warn him out of the zone.)<br/>
<br/>
On Innoruuk, the second wave (or maybe the 3rd) is hitting 50 now.  That<br/>
means more hi levels than ever before.  Pretty soon you will be hearing:<br/>
<br/>
Harmonic tells the zone: &quot;Level 50 Bard looking for a Fear group - will play<br/>
mana song in combat!!&quot;  &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sylly Songsynger<br/>
&lt;Spirit of the Moon&gt;<br/>
Bard of the 38th song<br/>
somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I thot maybe by new year&#39;s but now maybe by valentine&#39;s day for me.  I<br/>
am taking a week off during the holidays so - maybe Harm will charm some<br/>
LDC&#39;s for me to kill??? (ya I know they are too high to bard charm - maybe I<br/>
can find a necro twink me &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>
