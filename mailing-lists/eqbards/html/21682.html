<div id="ygrps-yiv-321949469">all of this reminds me of The Matrix and the scene where keanu&#39;s mouth<br/>
actually seals itself with skin since the fed dudes are pissed at him. Cause<br/>
lately alot of &quot;the Vision&quot; has been coming up in posts. its kinda Deja Vu<br/>

Always wondered about &#39;exploits&#39; like this.  They shouldn&#39;t ban me for<br/>
finding them. They should thank me and fix them, but since they are too<br/>
proud to do the former and too lazy to do the latter, they instead threaten<br/>
to ban people.  It&#39;s really pretty silly.  They are basically banning people<br/>
from being smarter than they are.  Figure out something that allows you to<br/>
gain xp or money faster than &quot;The Vision&quot; allows and it is either nerfed or<br/>
banned.  Heaven forbid they should actually just fix it.<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t this be considered an exploit?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve camped in the MM jail on numerous occasions but always before I got the<br/>
chant songs.  Also was always in a group so we just pulled them out of the<br/>
cells.  I assume what you were doing was opening the doors, targetting one<br/>
of the mobs, closing the doors, and then chanting until the mob died.<br/>
Curious what happens when the first chant hits.  If it is a caster mob, does<br/>
it cast through the door?  Melee mobs?  What about the mobs in the other<br/>
cells that you didn&#39;t target?<br/>

Maybe they&#39;ve been nerfed since. I did indeed sit and chant everything in <br/>
the cells to death, repeatedly and they never moved. *shrug*.<br/>
<br/>
I did this about 3 weeks ago and all 3 of them were chained. The two on the <br/>
left could move to the door, but couldn&#39;t strike very far beyond it.<br/>
<br/>
I admit, I was surprised it wasn&#39;t always camped 24/7 as they were indeed <br/>
sitting ducks, except that casters were extremely dangerous. Also, the <br/>
wandering placeholder did make it a bit tougher.<br/>

&gt;Stuff in the cells are chained?  They sure didn&#39;t have any trouble chasing<br/>
&gt;me halfway to the zone before I outran them.  I hope you were kidding.<br/>
