<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-667248017">Good points.  Also in a group situation, if the group is in any way<br/>
balanced, I often have a hard time twisting three songs that the party<br/>
actaully NEEDS.  Sure, I can resort to dots, but at 58 playing with good to<br/>
excellently equipped characters, we really don&#39;t need the extra damage.  <br/>
<br/>
But then again, maybe I am just a lazy bard, rather than one who &quot;knows my<br/>
role.&quot;<br/>

I agree Atonal. I mean Kaz, if it was as easy and beneficial as you describe<br/>
don&#39;t you think a lot<br/>
of Bards would be doing it? There&#39;s a lot of people on this list that have<br/>
played them for 2+<br/>
years and while very few of us may be &quot;hard-core&quot; gamers, the majority of us<br/>
can key mash with the<br/>
best of &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious if any of the BOTB competing Bards, especially those that made<br/>
it a couple rounds,<br/>
have any comments. This would kinda be the acid test. If they, the truly<br/>
hard-core crowd, twisted<br/>
four or more songs when efficiency, effectiveness and quick thinking were<br/>
all needed for survival,<br/>
then I would think more seriously about it.<br/>

A macro cannot adjust to a missed note, and becomes a liability in the<br/>
case&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
of repeated missed notes.&nbsp; I tried it, a while back.&nbsp; You can&#39;t<br/>
pick up&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
where you missed a note.&nbsp; The social has to start at the beginning<br/>
again,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
once you manage to stop it, and start it again.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
A macro also cannot change the math (since you like math) involved, in<br/>
cast&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
times, and duration times.&nbsp; While I haven&#39;t sat down and formulated all<br/>
the&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
possible combinations (I&#39;d rather spend what little free time I get<br/>
playing&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
the game), I&#39;m relatively certain that there is no combination of songs<br/>
that&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
allows for a true, no dropped effects, 5 song twist.&nbsp; You will get<br/>
dropped&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
effects, and, in my opinion, any &quot;twist&quot; that inherently drops<br/>
effects, is&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
no twist at all.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Feel free to continue to disagree, however, you can&#39;t change the fact<br/>
that,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
if dropped effects don&#39;t matter, then we can all twist 8 songs<br/>
effortlessly.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>

I haven&#39;t a high enough level bard to test it, but surely writing a macro<br/>
(a&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
social button) would eliminate most of the complaints you have with<br/>
twisting&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
four.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
