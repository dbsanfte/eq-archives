<div id="ygrps-yiv-542306681">The one time I fought Gullerback was in a party with 3 bards, a ranger and a<br/>
cleric.  I was the lowest at 39th level.  Everyone else was in their mid 40s<br/>
except the cleric who was low 50s.  The ranger snared him, the two bards<br/>
higher than me kept singing Fear the entire time.  Every once in a while he<br/>
would resist one of their fears and attack us.  Otherwise the entire fight<br/>
consisted of us chasing him down until we finally killed him.  Took at least<br/>
five minutes since the ranger was really the only one dealing out good melee<br/>
damage.  Was definately fun though.<br/>

Gullerback is still a very common spawn - rumor is that he&#39;s the placeholder<br/>
for Az... a named wurm for the Wurmslayer quest.<br/>
<br/>
I had no problem taking Gullerback down in a group with a 52 Mage, 49<br/>
Paladin, 50 Druid, and me (45? at the time).  We continued to fight him when<br/>
the Druid left - we got him once - and then died the second time when he<br/>
summoned the Mage.<br/>
<br/>
We all got our mantles...<br/>
