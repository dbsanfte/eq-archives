<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465942033">I have a 933mhz p3 and 128mb sdram (dial up<br/>
connection) I also have some &quot;Intel&quot; video card<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of (Compaq Presario system) The<br/>
graphics seem pretty good, much better than my<br/>
last computer anyway (which had a VooDoo3 2000),<br/>
but I still have to run in 480 x 640 video mode -<br/>
What are the benefits of running the game in a<br/>
different video mode? My system runs on 768 x<br/>
1024 video mode, but if I try to switch the game<br/>
to that mode, the veiwing area becomes very tiny.<br/>
If I want to take advantage of my full monitor<br/>
screen I have to run in 480 x 640... Why is this?<br/>
And does it really matter?<br/>
<br/>
Btw, Bard&#39;s finally 13th level, just been too<br/>
lazy to switch sig...hehe<br/>
