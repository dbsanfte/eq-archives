 </span></blockquote>I played last night but didn&#39;t notice the new &quot;clip plane&quot; feature, because it<br/>
wasn&#39;t noted in the documentation.  &lt;grin&gt;  However, the clip plane is the<br/>
plane off in the distance that determines where the software quits drawing<br/>
objects.  As you run the trees come into view a bit at a time for instance,<br/>
sometimes having the branches hovering in midair without the trunk.  The trunk<br/>
is beyond your clip plane, but the branches are not.  If you can adjust this,<br/>
then it probably means that you can adjust how far away the clip plane is<br/>
based upon your computer&#39;s performance.  The clip plane on my PII-400 could<br/>
probably go farther out without serious performance issues, while some of my<br/>
friends with P-266s might want to move it in a bit to speed things up.  The<br/>
larger the radius of the clip plane, the slower things will be for you.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s merely my *guess* based upon your saying that a clip plane option<br/>
has been added.  I&#39;ll certainly look at it tonight.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know either.  I broke a level last night and several skills were going<br/>
up and I didn&#39;t see any difference in the messages being printed.  &quot;You have<br/>
become better at percussion and now pass other players even more quickly using<br/>
Selo&#39;s Accelerando (84).&quot;  I expected (84/200) or something.  So I switched to<br/>
the Skills screen hoping that instead of &quot;Feeble&quot; my fishing would be shown as<br/>
&quot;Feeble 12/200&quot;, but nope...  Anyone know where they hid the one thing that<br/>
they *did* document?<br/>

&gt; I have 2 not so directly bard related questions that maybe someone on this<br/>
&gt; list can help me with so I don&#39;t have to mingle on the Vault boards and soil<br/>
&gt; my hands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  What is the new &quot;Clip Plane&quot; option and what does it do?  Whey do new<br/>
&gt; &quot;features&quot; get added to the game with no explanation (2nd part of question<br/>
&gt; is rhetorical)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  What did the patch message mean by &quot;you can now see your current and<br/>
&gt; maximum skill points&quot; because from how I understood the question and what I<br/>
&gt; saw, there is nothing new at all about what is displayed on the skills<br/>
