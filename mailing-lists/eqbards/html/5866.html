<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190685071">Saw this on bard message board - made me really sick to read it:<br/>
<br/>
Sylly.<br/>
<br/>
(p.s. I sent him a nasty gram back - tellin him he sucks for hurting a<br/>
newbie - albeit a ebay twinkie - and hoping the high levs on MM have a few<br/>
words with him.  Maybe its just a troll and I am over reacting - like always<br/>
but I hate to think that someone would do such a thing.)<br/>

Dear God...They are Here!!   <br/>

Ok,<br/>
We knew they were out there. EBay be damned. WHY?!?? I flinched when I saw<br/>
other classes sold (well, I&#39;d heard about it anyway) but last night, I saw<br/>
what HAD to be a bought BARD char. <br/>
Ok...Im calming down. Here it is.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, on Mith Marr, I was hunting in North Karana (Im level 17 now,<br/>
and unless I want to kite, the only way I can go solo anywhere is to kill<br/>
Borer beetles in NK - why I didnt want to group is another story), when I<br/>
saw a fellow Bard appear in front of me. He was decked out in nice Steel<br/>
Armor. He spied me playing my trusty mandolin (I was healing up) and<br/>
proceeded to ask me a TON of newbie questions...spammed me with them in<br/>
fact.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Where am I?&quot; North Karana &quot;Where is that?&quot; hmmm..level 35...You don&#39;t know?<br/>
&quot;What city is near by?&quot; Qeynos &quot;What race is that?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
At this point, I really want to see how new he is...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the Hall of the Mountain Giants, says I..<br/>
<br/>
&quot;WOW, Can you lead me there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but they don&#39;t like elves there, and I&#39;ll get killed. Giants like you<br/>
though, being human...just go West till you see them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is sooo cool&quot; &quot;WOW...look at that&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why not go say hello? He may give you a quest...<br/>
<br/>
(NOTE: at this point, he is still in WALK mode)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;HEY! HELP ME!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hey...Im in a place called Freeport. Can you tell me how to get to my<br/>
body?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry pal, you lose everything when you die. Its a shame, but its part of<br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ok. It wasn&#39;t nice. But, I wasn&#39;t in the mood to be nice. That sort of thing<br/>
really irks me. Just a shame to see it happening to US too. I&#39;d have thought<br/>
bards a bit too, well, cerebral to be big buying items.<br/>
So....I decided to look at EBay today. After seeing this firsthand, I HAD to<br/>
know how bad it was. My feelings? People are lazy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finale note: I&#39;d do this again and again. Save all flames. I just cant<br/>
respect anybody who didn&#39;t at LEAST get the exp themselves. This makes the<br/>
twinking issue moot.<br/>
