<div id="ygrps-yiv-142985407">On the one from Dalnir&#39;s, it comes from the Library area, off of a Failed<br/>
Crypt Raider.<br/>
For the one from Kaesora (and arguably the hardest one to get)...<br/>
*blushes*<br/>
I forget :op  I got mine while my guil was having a raid there.  I know it<br/>
comes off of some critter on the 2nd floor, but can&#39;t remember for the life<br/>
of me :o(<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just for those of us on the list who dont know the details on the<br/>
&gt; first two coins, mind filling us in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmmm... went by Allakhazam&#39;s and they have no info on the quest... how<br/>
&gt; &gt; odd.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; First thing&#39;s first, you must get a Star of Odus (buy it) from the<br/>
jewelry<br/>
&gt; &gt; shop in Erudin.  Turn it in to the *MALE* banker in FV.  He will then<br/>
give<br/>
&gt; &gt; you a 6-slot container with a combine button for the coins.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since you already have the ones from Dalnir&#39;s and Kaesora, we&#39;ll skip<br/>
&gt; &gt; those.<br/>
&gt; &gt; City of Mist- One drops from the Captian of the Watch (or something like<br/>
&gt; &gt; that, I lost my detailed list :o/ )<br/>
&gt; &gt; Emerald Jungle- Must be Foraged for.  Grab a nearby druid and exchange a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lil<br/>
&gt; &gt; mana for the foraging ;o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lake of Ill Omen- The Bloodgill gobbies in the lake (look at the base of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pillars around the center of the lake) carry these, and are probably the<br/>
&gt; &gt; toughest creatures you&#39;ll have to fight in this quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Overthere-  Check out the big pit in the center of the zone and kill<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; scorpoid (can&#39;t remember the exact name, but it&#39;s the rarer of the two<br/>
&gt; &gt; kinds<br/>
&gt; &gt; of scorpions in the pit).<br/>
&gt; &gt; -all of these coins are fairly common drops-<br/>
&gt; &gt; Put them in the box the banker gave you, hit combine (now it looks like<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; treasure chest), give it to him, and Voila!  you have a Nostrolo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tamborine<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and you will notice the difference IMMEDIATELY).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; NOTE:  Make *SURE* you have an empty spot in you general inventory for<br/>
&gt; &gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; he gives you the box for the gem (not sure about the tamborine, but<br/>
always<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good idea).  If your inventory slots are full, you will get the &quot;dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ground message&quot; but the box will be gone (ie: time to head back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Erudin again).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Enjoy!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
