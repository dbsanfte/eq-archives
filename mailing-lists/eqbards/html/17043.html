&gt; &gt; The reason I find it nauseating is because a group with a L49<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard can improve their performance by getting a L16 enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; to buff them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yea, but someone is not gonna get xp if you group like that. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

that restriction.<br/>

Let me try to put it in perspective.  Wizards are best at<br/>
nuking.  You can have a mage, druid, or shaman to nuke and<br/>
they&#39;ll operate at 80%-90% the effectiveness of a wizard,<br/>
nuking the equivalent of a wizard approx 5-10 levels or so<br/>
lower.<br/>
<br/>
Warriors are best at tanking (absorbing damage).  You can have<br/>
a paladin/SK in place of the warrior, and he&#39;ll operate at<br/>
about 80% the effectiveness of a warrior at absorbing damage,<br/>
tanking about the equivalent of a warrior approx 10 levels or<br/>
so lower.<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters are best at speedups.  You can have a shaman do it<br/>
at 67% their effectiveness, or the same as an enchanter 20<br/>
levels lower.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can have a bard do it at 50% their effectiveness<br/>
(20%-33% prior to level 36), or the same as an enchanter 32<br/>
levels lower.<br/>
<br/>
When a class can substitute for another, it&#39;s usually at about<br/>
67%-90% the effectiveness of the class that&#39;s the avowed<br/>
master at that job.  Except us.<br/>
