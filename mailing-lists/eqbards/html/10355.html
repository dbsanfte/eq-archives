<div id="ygrps-yiv-948318786">Yeah, I applied the condition exactly because I knew from before it was<br/>
trivial to plug the resist rate onto the equation after you had it just as<br/>
John says here.  I just couldn&#39;t remember the exact equation I had come up<br/>
with, figured John had messed around with it anyhow and had a better memory<br/>
than me, and our EQ team here at work was arguing over it.  I checked my<br/>
equation when I got home and it was a bit different than John&#39;s, but only<br/>
because I used average damage per hit and hit% while he used average damage<br/>
per round and hits per round.  Worked out the same after converting.  Still,<br/>
it proved my point to the guys at work that against very fast mobs if we<br/>
used Psalm we could ignore the fact that they got spread over 3 tanks and we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need to chain-chain-chain on 3 mobs, it would be far better to just<br/>
Psalm them.  Now if I could make 23 so we could have 2 chainers, that would<br/>
be even better.<br/>

&gt; Unfortunately, what this doesnt&#39; take into account is<br/>
&gt; the fact that chain gets resisted what seems like at<br/>
&gt; least 25% or more fighting white critters.  Yellow<br/>
<br/>
That was a condition Kitasi gave when he asked me to do<br/>
it - assume 0% resist on Chain.  If you want to factor in<br/>
resist rate on Chain, just multiply the right side by the<br/>
percent time the mob is Chained.  e.g., if it&#39;s Chained 75% of<br/>
the time:<br/>
<br/>
N*dps &gt; 0.75*0.3*Dp  if Psalm is better<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; N*dps &gt; 0.3*Dp  if Psalm is better<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; N = number of times a mob hits you per &quot;round&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; dps = damage of Psalm per hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dp = your average damage per &quot;round&quot;<br/>
