<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607831897">That would seem to indicate you could not stand in front of any aggressive<br/>
mob while playing invis.  When the song visibly pulsed he would attack you.<br/>
Since this does not happen, I have one theory why not which explains another<br/>
peculiarity I noticed.  It seems that mobs rather than having an agro<br/>
refresh rate, have an agro scan rate.  Each pulse the mob checks to see if<br/>
anything is in his agro range that he wants to attack.  Unless this happens<br/>
to pulse just when your invis pulses he will never see you.  The other thing<br/>
I noticed is that I have many times now run directly under Griffennes at<br/>
full speed trying to pull them back to a group, only to have to circle<br/>
around and do it again because the Griffenne apparently did not see me the<br/>
first time.  I can only conjecture that I was running so fast I cleared the<br/>
Griff&#39;s agro radius before his agro pulsed a second time.<br/>

&gt; I encountered this also when I was camping the Icy Greaves in Perma a<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; back.  Another bard and I were grouped, I sang Invis while he sang See<br/>
&gt; Invis.  Both seemed to stack with each other nicely<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I was grouped with another bard last night in Mistmoore<br/>
and got to test this.  Mind you I had &quot;other bard spam&quot; turned<br/>
off so I&#39;m mostly basing this on the icons that showed up on<br/>
my screen (it was a spur of the moment testing, not planned).<br/>
<br/>
Other bard was playing Hymn.  Someone yells train.  I start<br/>
Invis.  All of us flicker out of view well before the train<br/>
arrives.  I tell him to turn off his song NOW.  Unfortunately<br/>
by the time I finished typing that and he turned his song off,<br/>
the train has passed and gone to the zone.  We sit tight,<br/>
invisible, hoping they didn&#39;t see us.  The train runs back<br/>
down and makes a beeline for the bard playing Hymn.  (We<br/>
barely get out, he dies.)  There is some debate as to whether<br/>
the train actually saw him playing Hymn, or if invis dropped<br/>
on him due to PL.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d died earlier (stupid gargoyle got a double hit for max<br/>
damage on me just as I was about to hit the zone) and needed<br/>
to loot my corpse.  A lot of people are parked outside in LFay<br/>
so I asked the same bard to play invisibility to let me check<br/>
inside for a train.  I zone in, no train.  I begin to loot,<br/>
grab my mino horn, equip it, and play invis.  Other bard zones<br/>
in, starts up invis himself.  People bring a minor train to<br/>
the zone.  I finish looting and watch.  Target a mob and start<br/>
/conning it over and over.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, this is me and the other bard both playing invis at<br/>
the same time.  *Every* time the song graphics were present<br/>
(glowing ball), the mob /conned &quot;ready to attack.&quot;  The moment<br/>
the song animation ended, the mob /conned &quot;indifferent.&quot;  I<br/>
hit the /con button over and over for 2 or 3 pulses and it<br/>
switched between &quot;indifferent&quot; and &quot;ready to attack&quot;<br/>
completely in synch with whether or not the song graphics were<br/>
present.<br/>
