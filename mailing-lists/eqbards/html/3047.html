 </span></blockquote>Well I wouldn&#39;t go as far as saying ping is not as important as packet<br/>
loss for twisting.  They are both important for you to be able to twist<br/>
your songs.  With my bad cable modem connection, the ping times are low<br/>
but it is hard to twist when your packet loss goes up into the 50-60 range<br/>
as screen updates and message updates become erratic.  When this happens<br/>
you can accidently cancel your song, or even have you start and stop your<br/>
songs numerous times in row.  That is why I prefer my modem connection, I<br/>
can always twist two song reliably and most of the time three songs unless<br/>
I get bursted with a whole slew of data.  I do hope that clears things up.<br/>
