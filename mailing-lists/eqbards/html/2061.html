<div id="ygrps-yiv-711468167">Hello all!<br/>
	Well i got myself a Dirk , Love the stats , love the effects <br/>
.......now if the damn thing would just work right. My question is , how long <br/>
did it take everyone out there to get your piercing skills up ? This is <br/>
mainly to the foolish people like me who didn&#39;t think to rotate weapons and <br/>
keep all skills maxed .....( whoops). I have been in a group and solo for a <br/>
day and a half now using my dirk, and my skill level is 7! ( still gotta go <br/>
to the guild and throw a point into pierce) So i have 2 more questions 1) if <br/>
i throw a point or 2 in to pierce does it make leveling faster from that <br/>
point onward ? and 2) because pierce isn&#39;t the bards intial attack type , or <br/>
perhaps its preffered weapon type ( is that worded ok?? , it might not be ) <br/>
does it make piercing harder to learn than 1h slash ??<br/>
Ok , many thanks .<br/>
