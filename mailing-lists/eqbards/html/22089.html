<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993353399">The problem SEEMS to have gone away, but I couldn&#39;t sufficiently test it<br/>
because I got lost in Highpass, then in the keep, then again in highpass.<br/>
I never made it back out to W Karana to try hunting again.  (note to self:<br/>
get maps!)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the latest driver from Creative, but couldn&#39;t get to the page<br/>
to download them either, so I dropped the acceleration down a notch.  With<br/>
that change I didn&#39;t have any slow downs at all.  But then as I said, I<br/>
wasn&#39;t in the same zone that I was in when I first experienced the problem<br/>
and wasn&#39;t hunting.<br/>

when this happens, do you notice your meter spiking to 99% PL then slowly<br/>
going back down to 0%?  i know this is a long shot, but that started<br/>
happening to me this week out of nowhere.  the screen would lock up for a<br/>
few seconds and the PL would spike then go back to 0.  i replaced the nic<br/>
and it seems to be gone.<br/>
