<div id="ygrps-yiv-113771928">Is the song casted on you or on the npc when you just start talking to them?<br/>
Wow sounds like I found a use for this song, excellent!  I love this list.<br/>
Any idea where I can get a silk evening shirt and a cats eye amulet, and<br/>
what&#39;ll they cost me?  Heh.  Now I wonder what skill a bard should take up<br/>
next.  Pottery maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Will the song, Cinda`s Charismatic Carillon aid you in getting better<br/>
prices<br/>
&gt; &gt;for selling/buying items?  Even if it just a few copper.  I wonder.<br/>
&gt; &gt;And playing this in the middle of freeport, its not gonna kill me is it?<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve used the song a lot, saved a *lot* of money, and never seen any<br/>
&gt; adverse reaction.  The song actually casts an aura of enchantment on<br/>
&gt; yourself, attuned to a particular faction.  You choose a target to set<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; faction, and there&#39;s a glow on them as the magic touches them, but they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; apparently not enchanted in any way and don&#39;t react negatively.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The higher the price the more you save, into the many platinum of savings.<br/>
&gt; It also helps to load up with as many charisma enhancing items as you can<br/>
&gt; scrounge.  I now have a silk evening shirt and a cats-eye amulet as my<br/>
&gt; shopping clothes and am watching out for appropriate earrings and other<br/>
&gt; items.  They all make a difference that&#39;s real easy to test.<br/>
