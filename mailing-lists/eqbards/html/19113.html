I cannot say this too many times.  Lake of Ill Omen.  This place is awesome<br/>
for xp from 24 to 29th at least.  Most of my guild is here on E&#39;ci now, at<br/>
least those in this level range.  They are getting 3 bubbles a night and<br/>
they are all casual players who play less than 4 hours per night.  Goblin<br/>
warriors, goblin warlords, sarnak recruits, and charbone and icebone<br/>
skeletons are their mane fare.<br/>
