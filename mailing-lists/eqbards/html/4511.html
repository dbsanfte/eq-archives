<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-977765402">Well, for mages (yes I have an enchanter too - funny how they seem to fill<br/>
the same slot in magic circles as we bards do) although I may have trouble<br/>
deciding - it is INFINITELY easier to memorize spells, than songs.<br/>
<br/>
Since we never get meditiate - our songs mem as slowly as the day we get<br/>
them - THAT is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the ONE song we have that DOES use manna, any reason they can&#39;t<br/>
make our songs faster as we progress in skill?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Actually, not true.  I also play an enchanter, and at only 8th level, he<br/>
&gt;already had problems deciding on what to memorize - and now having just<br/>
&gt;gotten 12th (but none of the spells - too poor), he&#39;s gonna be hard-pressed<br/>
&gt;to make his decision.  As it is, he&#39;s already juggling spell slots (3<br/>
&gt;buffs, 2 slots), and he can never decide whether invisibility or gate is<br/>
&gt;more important. </span></blockquote></div>
