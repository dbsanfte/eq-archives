<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lullaby gone missing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-857734856">Ok, I have a question -<br/>
<br/>
I have seen many song lists stating that both Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament and <br/>
Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby are only found in Kelethin. I did not see it in <br/>
Freeport so i went to Kelethin and sure enough it was there. That was around <br/>
lvl 9.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am lvl 14, and was looking forward to purchasing Lullaby. So i had a <br/>
friend gate me to G Faydark just for this song, and found that the merchant <br/>
selling high level songs has neither one now. I also heard that maybe one of <br/>
the merchants was missing. Maybe he went for a walk (I&#39;ve seen that before, <br/>
but never with spell merchants). I seem to remember seeing Lullaby there at <br/>
the time I purchased Lament.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what the deal is with this? I want to get this song badly, <br/>
but unless i get help I will have to possibly travel all the way to Erudin. <br/>
A petition brought a response from a guide saying &quot;you&#39;ll have to find out <br/>
for yourself&quot;, of course. It&#39;s just annoying when you are sure the song was <br/>
there. It threw me off enough finding that since beta, our songs have been <br/>
scattered across the world - which can be ok, it gives you a reason to <br/>
travel.<br/>
<br/>
Did they move it? Was the merchant out having a drink at the local pub? <br/>
Anyone? Thanks in advance!<br/>
