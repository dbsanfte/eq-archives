if you haven&#39;t been to Rokenn&#39;s site, then you definitely should<br/>
(http://www.eqsongs.com)<br/>
<br/>
Now, to answer your question:<br/>
<br/>
Lucid Lullaby and Lugubrious Lament have two completely different uses.<br/>
<br/>
Lugubrious Lament reduces the agro radius of a single targeted mob. This<br/>
makes it very useful for pulling singles from a group of mob. Lament the<br/>
extra mobs and pull the one you want.<br/>
<br/>
Lucid Lullaby is an area effect Mesmerization spell. In theory it will mez<br/>
all the mobs that are around the singer. In practice, it mezes about 1/3<br/>
meanwhile, the other 2/3 immediately turn on the bard and beat the bard to a<br/>
bloody pulp.<br/>
<br/>
In personal exp I used lullaby up till my mid to late 20s. I never expected<br/>
it to stop all the mobs. I used it to stop some of the mobs and make the job<br/>
easier on our healer. We had no enchanter, so I was it for crowd control.<br/>
I&#39;m sure it earned me some additional deaths over the time I used it, but<br/>
I&#39;m equally sure it saved me in some fights.<br/>

<br/>
Just who was this Kelin anyway?  Some sort of sado-masochist?<br/>
<br/>
Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now I&#39;m having a bit of a<br/>
problem figuring out what to do<br/>
with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a lot of discussion on the<br/>
list about this song, but<br/>
usually in relation to levels far above mine.  I&#39;ve been meaning to write<br/>
this since I got the darn song,<br/>
because I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>
<br/>
First, my experience with Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament.  When I first got that<br/>
song it didn&#39;t work for me at<br/>
all.  Always resisted.  Consistently got mobbed.  But as I&#39;ve leveled, it&#39;s<br/>
become more useful.  I really<br/>
only try to use it on blues and I&#39;m having a very good success rate (knock<br/>
on wood).<br/>
<br/>
Then I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament was when I first got it<br/>
because I can&#39;t see when it<br/>
&quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden surrounded.  I pick a small group of<br/>
blues.  Run up and turn on<br/>
Lullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot; message.<br/>
Then they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong or if this song just really<br/>
sucks that bad?  Should I<br/>
wait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use it?  But then I thought I<br/>
recalled from previous<br/>
discussion that it&#39;s completely useless after level 24? or 27?  So why<br/>
bother for just a few levels of<br/>
use?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice.<br/>

<br/>
p.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to have to give him a piece of<br/>
my mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>
soundly on the butt.<br/>
