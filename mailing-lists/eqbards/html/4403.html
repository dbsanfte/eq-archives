<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815193136"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I don&#39;t know if any of you have seen the chart of weapons that Lulen has had published at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com">http://everquest.gamestats.com</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you haven&#39;t seen these charts, I would suggest you do so. They are a comprehensive list of many of &gt;the weapons in everquest (There are currently over 200 weapons on this list). The chart sorts the &gt;weaponary by it&#39;s damage to delay ratio (Actually it uses the formula {[Damage*2]+1}/Delay   This is &gt;the damage that a weapon generates up until about level 20 or so, when Level and Strength bonuses &gt;start to show.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Ok, I still don&#39;t understand why I seem to be the only one that is<br/>
noticing what is wrong with the damned formula for weapon<br/>
efficiency used just about everywhere. That max damage / delay.<br/>
You don&#39;t do max damage with a weapon.. you do _average_<br/>
damage. Yes dex and str and skill will make it closer to max<br/>
more often, but on those battles where damage efficiency<br/>
really counts as anything (meaning a tough foe, if its a real wimp<br/>
who cares what you wield, you sing back more health probably<br/>
than what it can do to you) you are doing really rarely max damage.<br/>
Now change the formula to damage+1 / delay and it represents<br/>
the average damage. And better yet to ease it out, do the reverse<br/>
calculation of delay/dmg+1 and it is way easier to check efficiencies<br/>
in your head without a calculator ;)<br/>
<br/>
  And also, I don&#39;t get it why the staff at Verant themselves<br/>
(JM Cap-whatitwas posted that nice weapon damage evaluation)<br/>
have not tried to use any other than damage/delay formula to<br/>
evaluate weapon efficiency. I mean they have had proof from those<br/>
simulations they ran and all that faster weapons are more efficient<br/>
if they have same dmg/delay ratio. And why the bigger weapons<br/>
seem to outdo faster ones at real short under 30 second battles,<br/>
well I doubt they do if you calculate the damage they do using<br/>
a time frame of 0.1seconds less than x number of strikes from<br/>
the slow weapon. So 19.9seconds with 5/20 weapon will do<br/>
9 hits compared to the 4 a 10/40 weapon gets. Further analysis<br/>
would show that big weapons are better if the time used is short,<br/>
and somewhat longer than x times delay. But then when it gets<br/>
maybe about x times delay + delay/2 the faster will pick up again<br/>
when it gets its hits in that it needs to have used the same overall<br/>
time. And any longer period of time as proven by the simulations, the faster<br/>
will be better and the slower won&#39;t gain any big jumps anymore<br/>
in damage when it gets it chance to hit.<br/>
<br/>
  Ok I rambled. But this is somewhat on topic, because bards and<br/>
dual wield and the speed songs are all in favor of fast weapons<br/>
in my opinion. And there is nothing more fun than seeing you hit<br/>
4 times between the monsters hits =)<br/>
