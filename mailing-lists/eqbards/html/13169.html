<div id="ygrps-yiv-249564649">I like this response, nicely thought out.  I&#39;m not convinced, however...here&#39;s<br/>
why:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As much as I would love a bind song, it would go against how every song works.<br/>
&gt; Our songs are not permanent effects.  They are not even long lasting.  In<br/>
&gt;general, the effects we create only last for a few seconds after we stop<br/>
&gt;singing or playing our song.  Binding is very different: it is a permanent<br/>
&gt;change to the environment.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The one exception to this is the charismatic catillion, which lasts until we<br/>
&gt;zone...and that somehow makes sense.  I picture myself going into town and<br/>
&gt;singing to a merchant who loves the ballads of my adventures and tells all her<br/>
&gt;friends about me.  As soon as I leave town they forget all about Sarsa and<br/>
&gt;listen to the next Bard who comes in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that all of our songs are temporary.  But I would point out that all<br/>
spells in the game are temporary, with the exception of Bind.  Magician summoned<br/>
items are no-rent, and all others are buffs, DD&#39;s, DoT&#39;s, Heals, etc.  There are<br/>
no environment altering spells in the game that I know of except Bind.  Perhaps<br/>
a case could be made for Mem Blur, but that&#39;s one spell out of 700.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I&#39;d have to say that the Bard songs aren&#39;t a group of temporary<br/>
effects, but rather songs that mimic existing spells or spell effect combo&#39;s.<br/>
So, the fact that they are temporary is due to the fact that the spells they<br/>
mimic are temporary.  After all, once a caster stops casting, he&#39;s done the same<br/>
thing we do when we stop singing...let the effect drop after a set, but finite<br/>
duration.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If there was a bind song it could only keep us bound for as long as we sang<br/>
&gt;it.  Not practical.  Even if we did get a permanent bind, could you imagine<br/>
&gt;how loud the other melees would scream?  If all 7 melee types died in Guk and<br/>
&gt;died in Freeport at the same time and started running back, who would arrive<br/>
&gt;first without outside aid?  The bards of course!  We already have the<br/>
&gt;advantage over all other melee classes in this area.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if we were a &#39;melee&#39; class, which is the distinction I&#39;m trying to work<br/>
out in my post, I&#39;d agree.  But seeing as how the other melee classes get 6 to 9<br/>
combat skills in addition to dodge, and we get 1, I can&#39;t see how we can be<br/>
lumped in.  I guess in response to saying &#39;We don&#39;t get bind!&#39;, we can answer<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t get combat skills!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heck, if we had 6 or 7 combat skills like the other 3 hybrids, I&#39;d agree that<br/>
Bind would be completely inappropriate.  But really, it would be like saying,<br/>
Clerics can&#39;t have bind because the Rangers would be pissed!  We&#39;re a breed<br/>
apart.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the answer, even if I didn&#39;t agree :)<br/>
