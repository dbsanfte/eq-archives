<div id="ygrps-yiv-634731270">Well I couldn&#39;t help myself, I had to try it.  I was camping the Savant and<br/>
Cavalier (Sav/Cav) last night with a competent group.  We had a Cleric,<br/>
Shaman, Ranger, Warrior, Magician and Myself (39th bard).  Pretty balanced.<br/>
We were pulling both rooms to the Savant area and fighting there.  I was<br/>
brought on as mana pump but my team was very pleasantly surprised to find<br/>
that I could twist three songs, melee fairly effectively and perform crowd<br/>
control.  We were so successful that we cleared all the way from the Sav<br/>
room to the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons (GIBS) and started pulling those.<br/>
After having to alternately Pixie Strike two GIBS during a 10+ minute battle<br/>
and having resists and missed notes allow them break out and freeze me from<br/>
time to time I decided I&#39;d dust off Lullaby and try it.  Heh.  Never again.<br/>
I didn&#39;t die thanks to the Cleric and Shaman, but Lullaby had virtually no<br/>
effect other than Taunt.  If they&#39;re mezzed with Lullaby, it&#39;s so brief as<br/>
to be negligible.  GZ would probably remind me that &quot;higher level mobs have<br/>
a greater chance of resisting&quot;, which is fine I suppose, but damn - give me<br/>
resist messages.<br/>
