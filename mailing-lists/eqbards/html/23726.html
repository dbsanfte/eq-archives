<div id="ygrps-yiv-311652443">Our guild has killed Velk v.1 and Velk v.2 and *no* Donal&#39;s BP&#39;s were used<br/>
or abused in the slaying of this monster!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kinda hard to say how much hp&#39;s a given mob has - what with regen rates<br/>
and varying times of battle.  Velk has *a lot* of hp&#39;s.  Our fights with him<br/>
go for 15+ minutes. We log hits as best we can.  He does more damage to us<br/>
than we do to him but we have better healers!  Also, we res folks in battle<br/>
- sometimes 2 or 3 times.  In a long fight, you will need to do alot of<br/>
damage to him. 500k seems high iirc - more like 200k but if you fight him<br/>
for 40 minutes... he is gonna regen a lot more hps.<br/>
