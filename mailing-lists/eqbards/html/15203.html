Captian Kirk- &quot;Captian&#39;s Log: Stardate 2134.<br/>
Recently we have encountered a weak transmission from an unknown source.<br/>
The<br/>
signal is very primitave in its technology and far to weak to decode at<br/>
this<br/>
time. We are entering the Gamma Quadrant in hopes of tracking down the<br/>
source of this mysterious transmission. Kirk out.&quot;<br/>
Mr Spock peers into his scope, green light covers the upper part of his<br/>
face<br/>
as waves and lines scramble across numorous monitors.<br/>
<br/>
Spock- &quot;Captian, it appears as if this signal is coming from a planet in<br/>
the<br/>
Sony system. A small inhospitible planet full of noxious gasses called<br/>
Verant X.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;What sort of intelligent life form could live in such a<br/>
place? Mr. Sulu, set up the deflector dish array with an ion pulse to help<br/>
pinpoint the transmission source.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Sulu- &quot;Aye Captian.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lt. Uhura- &quot;Captian, Im getting a much stonger signal now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Onscreen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
the crew is stunned to see a humanoid life form on the screen smiling at<br/>
them all.<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Hiya gang! I am Abashi from Verant X!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;We intercepted your signal. Are you in need of assistance?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;No, silly. The signal you intercepted, as you so quaintly put it,<br/>
God I just love roleplaying, was actually an enhancement to your ship we<br/>
were patching to you. You didnt really need to respond.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;I dont understand...enhancement? What have you done to my<br/>
ship? Shields up! Red alert!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Oh stop..you dont even know if youll like it or not. We just<br/>
thought that warp speed was a little too unbalancing. The Klingons and<br/>
Romulans dont get to go nearly that fast. Trust me, its only a small change<br/>
to your speed. Maybe 10% to 50%.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Scotty! I want a complete report on all warp drives. I want<br/>
to know what this fiend has done to us!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Scott- &quot;Aye Captian&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Oh youre not going to start whining now are you? I just hate it<br/>
when people whine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Spock- &quot;Captian, I am not certian, but it would appear that our forward<br/>
shields have been reduced to almost half their normal power.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;What??? You, you Abashi being, why are you doing this? We<br/>
came to aid you and you attack us?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Oh gee...you are going to whine now arent you. Well, I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
just have to call you a whiner then. Whiner!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Chekov, arm all photon torpedo bays and fire!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
a moment of scilence...<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Chekov?? Where is Mr Chekov? What have you done with<br/>
him??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Oh...well we here at Verant decided that you really didnt need<br/>
him.<br/>
All he did really was shoot your guns, so we felt for the sake of balance<br/>
that you could live without the extra crewman.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Scott- &quot;Captian..I dont believe my eyes. We left dock with a full supply<br/>
of dilithium crystals, and now were down to almost nothing! I dont<br/>
understand what is going on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Why are you doing this? Who are you really?!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;I told you, Im Abashi from Verant X. This is my leader, Brad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Brad- &quot;Hi..I hope you like the new improved Enterprise!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;No I...hey, whered he go??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Oh, hes a very busy guy. He doesnt like to mingle with the lesser<br/>
beings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Ive had enough of this. Mr Spock, form an away team. Were<br/>
going down there to meet these _things_ face to face!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Spock- &quot;Aye Captian.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later in the transporter room...<br/>
<br/>
Mr Spock- &quot;Fascinating, it would appear that half of our crew has vanished<br/>
without a trace, and the only reasoning for this is the Abashi creatures<br/>
word &quot;balance&quot;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;I know Spock...but what does he mean by it? What sort of<br/>
balance could he mean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dr McCoy- &quot;Jim, I got here as fast as I could. I had a patient that was<br/>
only<br/>
half there and I&#39;ll be damaned if all of my tools were missing!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Everyone put on your gasmasks...Alright Mr Scott, beam us<br/>
down.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A shrill sound spurs the machine into action as Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and<br/>
three nameless redshirts vanish in a sparkling mist...<br/>
<br/>
Upon materializing onto the Verant X surface loud screams are heard...<br/>
<br/>
Three redshirts- &quot;AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHH!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;What happened?!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Spock- &quot;It would appear that they were instantly killed just as they<br/>
materialized onto the surface.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Why? Why are we still alive? I see nothing around us that<br/>
would have done this and left us here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dr McCoy- &quot;Theyre dead Jim.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The three survivors look around in astonishment at the unforgiving<br/>
surroundings. Craggy rocks jutt out of the surface of the planet. Various<br/>
colors of mist and gas swirl around gaping holes. Hissing noises and the<br/>
bubbling of super heated liquids are the only sounds...<br/>
<br/>
On a very primitave intercom loud speaker, Abashi&#39;s voice pierces the men<br/>
like a rusty nail...<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Ok guys, how do you like our newest addition to the planet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;You just killed three of my men damn you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Oh dont start whining again please. Just get over it..its no big<br/>
deal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;No big deal? Where are you! Come out here and face us!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
..brief silence...<br/>
<br/>
A sudden whirring noise is heard and McCoys arms vanish from his body,<br/>
*poof*<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;My God man! What are you doing to us!?!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Were making it better. We know what were doing, you dont. I wont<br/>
talk to you anymore if you keep insulting me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dr McCoy- &quot;Damnit! Im a doctor not a circus freak! How can I operate with<br/>
no<br/>
arms? My patience will all die!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Well, we took away your arms because you were fixing everyone too<br/>
easily. BUT...we did give you three extra toes to compensate for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Three extra toes?? How is this supposed to help him or us?<br/>
Youve killed off half my crew, youve left my ship crippled and open to any<br/>
attack! What sort of beings are you??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;I told you to stop telling us what is best for you...we know all<br/>
about what is best.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
suddenly Mr Spock starts weeping uncontrollably....<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;What have you done to Spock?!?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Nothing...we never touched him. I dont know what youre talking<br/>
about, infact I think youre just making it all up so we will give you<br/>
something for free. Your just a whiner!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Im telling you! Hes a Vulcan, he isnt supposed to cry,<br/>
laugh,<br/>
or have any emotions damn you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Oh wait...youre right. We took out his emotions because we thought<br/>
that not having any made him too effective under pressure, so now all<br/>
Vulcans will have emotions...but they are only little ones.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Spock is still weeping like a baby, now curled up on the ground in a<br/>
fetal position, Dr McCoy is running around bumping into walls because<br/>
shortly after his arms were taken, his eye lids were made to only stay open<br/>
for 2 minutes every 24 hours....<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Damn you!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;I dont know what youre getting all upset about really. Its all so<br/>
things will be better from now on. Trust us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Scott! Beam us up now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Scott breaks through on the comlink with a scratchy transmission...<br/>
<br/>
Me Scott- &quot;Captian, Im getting an error from the transporter. Its telling<br/>
me<br/>
it cannot beam you up!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;What??? Ok, Abashi...what have you done now??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;Oh, did I forget to tell you?..you need a redshirt in your party<br/>
inorder to beam in or out of here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Captian Kirk- &quot;What?? Our men died as soon as they teleported down! How do<br/>
you expect us to get out??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abashi- &quot;I know...its quite the challenge isnt it? Heh heh heh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mr Spock is still on the ground crying, Dr McCoy has gotten his leg stuck<br/>
in<br/>
some sort of crater, and Captian Kirk, sweating profusely yells....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;DAAAAAAAMMMMMMMNNNNN YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The end?<br/>
