<div id="ygrps-yiv-355549475">I would love to be a &#39;support&#39; Bard but there seems to be an endemic <br/>
     shortage of tanks on my server.  I am always pressed into service as a <br/>
     tank.  Sigh.  And the couple of time I was in a group where it might <br/>
     have worked everyone in the group though I was &#39;slacking&#39; by not <br/>
     wanting to fight.  Not once have I been able to do this.  Maybe as I <br/>
     get more circles I will have a chance. (assuming no one cuts me down)<br/>
     So not all fighting Bards are selfish, just misunderstood and <br/>
     overworked...<br/>

Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>

[re: successful leveling]<br/>
I advise all bards overly concerned with the best weapons and damage dealt, <br/>
to review the gifts that you have been given. Nothing sickens me more than <br/>
seeing a forceful party in danger, while the bard is selfishly fighting. <br/>
SHAME ON THAT BARD! If you the bard wants to utilize your talents most <br/>
efficiently, group with 2 warriors (or a monk), 2 rogues, and 1 party member <br/>
that can do emergency heals. Stand back and play your heal with your lute, <br/>
twist whatever other song fits the occasion, and you can fight for hours and <br/>
hours, gain &quot;circles of knowledge&quot; quite quickly. A healthy group prevails, <br/>
so if you want to succeed and learn quickly, this is your best source. Use <br/>
your combat skills when soloing, or with weak groups, BUT always remember in <br/>
large groups, you ARE NOT a tank or a fighter, you are a talented musician.</div>
