<div id="ygrps-yiv-503496672"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Lol, who cares, either way he didn&#39;t really earn 60.  He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;cheated&quot; to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  Not cheated as in broke any rules but definitely cheated<br/>
&gt; &gt; the system to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get ahead of it.  I refuse to congratulate, hold in awe, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; respect someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; that finds pleasure in cheating the system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;ve got the wrong person, but weren&#39;t you the one who (with a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>friend)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; created characters called Banker and Teller a while back?   If that was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than consider this an official ribbing, a busing of your @$$, a pi$$ take,<br/>
&gt; and an attempt at levity.  (Anything but a flame.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YUP dat wuz us ;)  We had a blast doing it too.  But we did it in fun,<br/>
during _beta_ and it showed the GM&#39;s a basic flaw in the name filter<br/>
(Banker, Teller and a few other permutations were added to the name filter<br/>
shortly after our little escapade ;)  And we had a LOT of fun doing it.  :)<br/>
The characters were a joke since the GM&#39;s made us delete the characters<br/>
anyway ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Glad he&#39;s 60.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Me too, because where can he go from there but Asheron&#39;s Call?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Not saying<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is a BAD<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing, just that it isn&#39;t my style and that I don&#39;t respect<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone for how<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast they can hit 60 ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heh.  I dinged 11 last night.  For giggles I hit /played and found out my<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s birthday was May 5th.  That&#39;s almost a level a month!  Woohoo!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it only took me 6 days of playing time to do it.  I think I deserve a<br/>
&gt; cookie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>WOW and I thought that my best friend spent a lot of time roleplaying with<br/>
44days played at 20th... hehe and she spends HOURS just frittering time away<br/>
talking to folks ;)  She loves the social aspect of the game.  I keep trying<br/>
to tell her this isn&#39;t MiRC but she loves to chat :)<br/>
<br/>
Kudos on 11th!  Have you tried the all-instrument twist of<br/>
Hymn/Disonnance/Warsong?  (punching of course)<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll find it quite effective ;)  And it&#39;s always nice to get that<br/>
Hand to Hand skill maxed for CR&#39;s in dungeons ;)<br/>
