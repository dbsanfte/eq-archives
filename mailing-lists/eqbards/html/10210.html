&gt; equipment you can obtain.  We&#39;ve got a bunch of people who<br/>
&gt; like to play the work-for-everything-you-get game, and a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, let me ask you this then: Suppose someone I know (a college student)<br/>
has a fancy car that was given to him by his well to do parents. Now I don&#39;t<br/>
own a car like this but would like to, and could certainly do so, if I so<br/>
choose, because I&#39;ve already gone to college and have a career making a very<br/>
nice salary (i.e. &quot;paid my dues&quot;). SO...If we take this line of thinking<br/>
then it would be fair or kind for me to say he doesn&#39;t deserve the car<br/>
because he didn&#39;t earn it, and so SHOULDN&#39;T have it??? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
(just a little playing the D Advocate here)<br/>
<br/>
For me it&#39;s not that black and white. I would say I&#39;m in the middle on the<br/>
whole &quot;monte-hall&quot; &quot;get it myself&quot; debate - I&#39;m not really in either camp; I<br/>
don&#39;t mind when people give me things, but it&#39;s also fun to get them for<br/>
myself (as I stated before, I plan on getting the Lambent myself). BUT I do<br/>
not begrudge others getting Lambent WHEN they do even IF they had help and<br/>
are not at a level where they can get it themselves (not to say that they<br/>
don&#39;t need a towel as I drool on their armor when I see these people). For<br/>
various reasons, the obvious being the impossibility of self-acquirement, I<br/>
will be waiting to get it, even though my guild would probably help me get<br/>
it if I asked (they&#39;re a fun and helpful bunch).<br/>
<br/>
That aside, please remember that we each have our own opinion and are<br/>
entitled to those opinions. Its OKAY if people disagree with your opinion<br/>
regardless of the issue at hand (sometimes I have to remind myself of that).<br/>
What people seem to be objecting to, IMO, is how mean-sounding it was for<br/>
that person to say &quot;... you don&#39;t deserve....&quot; etc (and I know that person<br/>
probably didn&#39;t mean it to come across as harsh as it sounded???). BUT,<br/>
things are not always fair in life, and, regardless of opinion, things are<br/>
always going to happen that aren&#39;t fair - it&#39;s just the way life is... The<br/>
game seems to reflect that, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
