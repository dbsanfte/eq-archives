<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839560185">Oh man. After getting the recipe for how to nuke as a bard I went to try<br/>
soloing blue rooks in S. Karana that were kicking my butt a short time ago.<br/>
<br/>
Horn is armed, lute on cursor....<br/>
Dennons Disruptive Dischord blares across the savana!<br/>
Switch to lute...<br/>
Chords of Dissonance rip through the air!<br/>
A rook is bound in chains of solid music,<br/>
My wounds begin to heal<br/>
Switch to horn...<br/>
(punching for 1 pt of damage :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And after a short bit, boom, the Rook drops. My health is at about 1-1.5<br/>
bubbles, and Tszaaz the Bard is reborn, the game has just totally changed<br/>
for him. I could have done this at 15 or so but I didn&#39;t know about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now however, depending on the situation I may rarely arm my weapons. Doing<br/>
34 damage per round per monster (being 170 every 6 seconds on a standard<br/>
pull of 5 mobs) plus healing and slowing with no mana loss.<br/>
<br/>
Soloing is still not easy and you have to make SURE you are not in a wander<br/>
path...but, um, WOW. Can&#39;t wait till I get to add in the fire shield next<br/>
level Weeeee!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and part of the reason I am so excited about it is because I know my<br/>
warrior will be taunting and my cleric will be healing and I will have a<br/>
chance to survive the resulting onslaught *laughs*<br/>

Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, Level 24, starting a whoooole new game.</div>
