<div id="ygrps-yiv-508975834"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Clerics, Druids, and shaman are priest classes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok let&#39;s go with that. What is that?<br/>
<br/>
They can cast spells.. Caster.<br/>
They can use weapons and armor.. Fighter.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, from what I can tell that&#39;s a hybrid. If you<br/>
want to call it a priest, then I&#39;d say a priest is<br/>
a hybrid. If Clerics, Druids or Shamen aren&#39;t <br/>
hybrids because they&#39;re priests and get their powers<br/>
from their dieties, then a Bard isn&#39;t a hybrid either<br/>
because their power comes from music. NO other class<br/>
does that.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re claiming that &quot;preists&quot; aren&#39;t hybrids because<br/>
of *where* their abilities come from. Thinking along<br/>
those lines you simply can not disagree that a Bard<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a hybrid because of where HIS abilities<br/>
come from like no other.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that they have multiple abilities from<br/>
other different classes just like a Bard does.</div>
