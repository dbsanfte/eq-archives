<div id="ygrps-yiv-224938357"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I got nothing but a thank you on the Kelethin to Freeport, but that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; apparently due to either the lunacy of the gods in Freeport or ambiguous<br/>
&gt; instructions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried experementing with this last night - the Bard in Kelethin that<br/>
gives you the mail pouch told you the wrong person to give it to.  If<br/>
you give it to Tommy TwoTone or whatever his name is (the guy who gives<br/>
you the pouch for the Freeport to Kelethin run), you&#39;ll get the money<br/>
and experience.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that there are two types of quests, from hub city to hub city<br/>
which use the mail pouches and from sattelite to hub which use letters.<br/>
The hub vendors deliver to each other and the satellites deliver to a<br/>
hub.  Felicity is a satelite (cause she gives you a letter) and Two-<br/>
Tone is a hub.<br/>
<br/>
I always seem to get 9 gp for a hub delivery, but maybe I haven;t done<br/>
enough of them yet.<br/>
<br/>
The strange thing is after making a hub delivery, the Kelethin and Freeport<br/>
hub people both say &quot;ask my wife Eve if you want to deliver more mail&quot;,<br/>
even the Kelethin hub who is a female wood elf.  Funny...<br/>
<br/>
Guess the quest needs a bit more work.<br/>
