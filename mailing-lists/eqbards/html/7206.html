<div id="ygrps-yiv-457659628"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What levels were you and what weapons were you using?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both the clerics and I were 15th level at the time for 4 of the duel, the<br/>
first duel we were both 9th.  I think I was 14 the first time I dueled the<br/>
shaman, as was he and we were both 16th the second time. I was using a<br/>
dragoon dirk for the duels after 12th level, for the 9th level duel I was<br/>
using a fine steel scimitar, my skill in the weapons were all maxed at the<br/>
time.  The cleric was using a fine steel morning star the first duel I<br/>
believe, and a bloodforge hammer or shining star of light in the later<br/>
duels.  I beat him only when he tried to use the bloodforge hammer.  The<br/>
shaman was using a glowing crook staff the second time we dueled, not sure<br/>
about the first time, an RTS maybe.  Neither fight with the shaman was<br/>
close.  He had way too many hitpoints and hit way too hard.  Needless to say<br/>
his slam wasn&#39;t much help for my cause either as he could stun me and I<br/>
could not stun him.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Duel the Ranger with magic only and you should smoke him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually tried this over the weekend.  The ranger was 1 level higher than me<br/>
but it didn&#39;t matter.  It was pointless neither of us could kill the other<br/>
using only spells.  He would simply camo and run away whenever he got out of<br/>
mana or hurt and I had no way to find him just wandered around getting out<br/>
of range messages on my bellow.  He did nearly kill me once by snaring me<br/>
when a hill giant wandered nearby, but with Selo&#39;s I still escaped.  He was<br/>
able to use his tracking to always get back to me however so if he had<br/>
possessed any better spells I would have been helpless without see invis.<br/>
