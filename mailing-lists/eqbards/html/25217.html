This was also the explanation I got when I asked group members what they<br/>
meant by broken..<br/>

&gt; Any Haste Item + any Haste Spell USED to equal Max Haste (i.e. 10% <br/>
&gt; Anthem + 20% FBSS = Max Haste (75% at level 50)).  The error was a <br/>
&gt; problem with how the Game added haste effects (10% Haste was listed <br/>
&gt; as 110, 20% as 120 - 110+120=230=Exceeds max haste at 175).  Several <br/>
&gt; months ago Verant fixed that bug and now haste adds as it was <br/>
&gt; intended (i.e 10% Anthem + 20% FBSS = 30% Haste) (110+120=130).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From what I understand, the haste is broken on these things at this <br/>
&gt; time and they add 0% Haste.  VI may fix them in the future, so you <br/>
&gt; may want to think about keeping them.. but, if you can get 18k for a <br/>
&gt; broken item, take the deal in a heartbeat I say. :)  You also may <br/>
&gt; want to test them yourself to make sure they are broken or to find <br/>
&gt; out that they&#39;re not.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Is haste broken?  I would make a point of testing<br/>
&gt; &gt; that.  ALSO, a guy on this list posted last year that<br/>
&gt; &gt; any haste item, regardless of percentages and a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; speedup song resulted in a 75% speed increase.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; His name was John Kim and he backed this up with<br/>
&gt; &gt; posted statistics.  You may want to check the archives<br/>
&gt; &gt; for that information.   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s my thought:  even if haste doesn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; &gt; normally, does it make the jump to 75% with bard haste<br/>
&gt; &gt; song?  I would test this to be sure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Best of luck and good hunting to you,<br/>
