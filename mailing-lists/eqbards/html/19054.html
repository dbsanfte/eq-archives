<div id="ygrps-yiv-252978824">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
We went to Kaesora to explore and try for the coin.  Me 51, &#39;nother Bard 51,<br/>
third bard 50 and wizard 50.  I had a map - get one.  We zoned in and iirc<br/>
took the left passage - then killed some bugs - then took a right (check<br/>
map) and headed for the library on a whim.  There were several bugs to kill<br/>
along the way and some spec&#39;s too.  Nothing to break a sweat for our levels<br/>
although we lamented and tried to pull singles as best we could.  We pulled<br/>
to clear the outside of the library then moved up closer.<br/>
<br/>
On the porch, we agro&#39;d something and as we fought we also agro&#39;s the &#39;??<br/>
librarian&#39; and killed &#39;em both.  The something turned out to be the froog<br/>
that dropped the coin for the quest.  Something else there dropped a book<br/>
(?? iirc) that had good int +5 or +6 and that made our wiz happy.  Then we<br/>
went in the library and looked around.  Perhaps killed something else -<br/>
can&#39;t remember.  We did happen to go up stairs and looked around the<br/>
balcony.  On the ground, we found something for one of the medallion<br/>
quests - &quot;piece of a medallion&quot; or something.  BTW - we were the only ppl in<br/>
the zone - sad but true - and it looked to be a very cool zone for ppl who<br/>
can get exp at this level.  You&#39;d want a good party, some anti-poison<br/>
songs/spells but it looked to be good.<br/>
<br/>
We went outside and started to look around. Then we got our obligatory<br/>
over-pull.  About 6 things agro&#39;d and we were swarmed by greenies.  Evac was<br/>
no problem as we got what we wanted and it was time to go anyhow.  Next<br/>
time, we wil be heading to Dalnir&#39;s for the Royal Crown.  Then Suladan will<br/>
have all 6 coins.  Kaldivar needs Kasora and Dalnir.  I have Selos Drums so<br/>
its not as high a priority for me.<br/>
<br/>
So, I dont know if the froog that drops the coin in Kaesora roams the whole<br/>
dungeon or he is always found in the library area - but that&#39;s where we<br/>
found him.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I am doing this quest at the moment and have 4 of the coins. I just need<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Dalnir one and the Kaesora one.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also any tips for Kaesora? I&#39;ve never been there but it sounds a bit of a<br/>
&gt; nightmare. Luckily I am part of a regularish group of level 43 to 52<br/>
players<br/>
&gt; so I&#39;m not too worried about getting killed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also spoilers on the location of the coin in Kaesora would be most<br/>
welcome. </span></blockquote></div>
