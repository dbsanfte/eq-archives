<b>Subject:</b> Lambent breastplate quest peculiarity <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285606278">If this theory holds true then that will make it easier for lower level<br/>
bards to complete the Mane Attraction quest, a subquest to the Raincaller<br/>
bow quest.  Part of this quest requires you to get a toupee made for a gnome<br/>
in Akanon.  The toupee adds +10 to charisma.  Without spoiling all the<br/>
details, to get the toupee made requires a component off a mermaid in Kedge<br/>
Keep.  This requires a high level party to accomplish.  I&#39;ve already<br/>
completed the first part of the quest but won&#39;t be able to get into Kedge<br/>
for at least 8-10 levels.  Would be nice if a high level friend could loot<br/>
the item off the mermaid, turn it into the gnome, and then I turn in the<br/>
rest of the components and get the toupee.  May be violating the spirit of<br/>
doing the quest for yourself but like my old First Sergeant used to say: &quot;If<br/>
your not cheating your not trying!&quot;  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is a bug of a sort. Here is what happens: Lets say a quest requires<br/>
&gt; 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; items (X, Y, & Z).  Player 1 gives the NPC items X, Y, and a third<br/>
&gt; item <br/>
&gt; &gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is incorrect. Swears up & down at his bad fortune and stomps off.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;Player 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; comes up and gives the NPC item Z and gets the goods, and since she<br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gave the NPC items X & Y gets the &quot;you have something else for me?&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt;message.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hmm, does this mean my cleric friend (who picked up a gypsy<br/>
&gt; &gt;lute when I wasn&#39;t there) could give the lute to the NPC, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;I could give the NPC the carapace and ruby lambent, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;would get the breastplate?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Do I really want to try this experiment considering it took me<br/>
&gt; &gt;3 days to get that damn carapace?  Anyone know of a similar,<br/>
&gt; &gt;easier quest we could test this theory on first?<br/>
