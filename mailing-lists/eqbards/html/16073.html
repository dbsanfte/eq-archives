<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059102465"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That being said, if I weezle into the prime nag group,<br/>
&gt; has it been your experience to try and keep just<br/>
&gt; guardian and elemental rhythms up or should I go for 3<br/>
&gt; (I&#39;m very good at twisting without queues so heavy lag<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t hamper keeping 3 up 90% of the time). If 3,<br/>
&gt; then what to add?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I would just keep 2 up.  Nagafen&#39;s AE dd spell also debuffs now,<br/>
so when he hits your party with it they will lose a buff.  What would be<br/>
most benefecial would be if one of your rhythm songs was the first buff so<br/>
it will be the one lost, and you can replace it within another tick of<br/>
losing it (that way they won&#39;t lose the buffs that can&#39;t be replaced mid<br/>
fight).<br/>
