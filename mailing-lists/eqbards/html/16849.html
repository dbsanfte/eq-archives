Maybe they did lower our agg to mobs.  I used to get the crap beat out of me<br/>
when I used Dirge.  Up till this I figured the &#39;lower taunt&#39; everyone was<br/>
debating was just a pigment (I mean figment) of our imaginations.  Dirge<br/>
used to have a pretty decent taunt factor.  If it&#39;s taunt factor is gone<br/>
then it really is utterly useless now.<br/>

&gt; &gt; As an example to the (unusually) low taunt of Dirge: we decided to blitz<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sol B king room with full spawn, since we had an enchanter with us.  I<br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; &gt; them I&#39;d lead with Dirge as we ran in, which I did.  You&#39;d expect that<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; least one mob would have rushed me, but all 3 latched onto our warrior<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; ran in (ie, he hadn&#39;t even taunted or hit anything yet.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been loading this song for kicks when doing Ogre bouncers recently.<br/>
&gt; Once an hour, I get to feel like low level nuker :).  I&#39;ve used this song<br/>
&gt; maybe 20 times?  Not once has a bouncer agro&#39;ed on me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other night we had a bad pull of 4 ogres and no enchanter.  We had a<br/>
&gt; strong party so there was no question of zoning.  I took the opporunity to<br/>
&gt; see if I could use the song to attract some attention to me to keep the<br/>
&gt; Ogres off the cleric.  It was the first song I fired up in combat, hit all<br/>
4<br/>
&gt; for the full damage and not one of them agroed on me... All 4 kept beating<br/>
&gt; on our tanks.  Heck, the procs on my Kisch or my Ykesha have a ton more<br/>
&gt; taunt value then the dirge!<br/>
