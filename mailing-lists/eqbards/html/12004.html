&gt;Just to spam some info that not everyone that I group with seems to know:<br/>
&gt;/tell can be abbreviated to /t, and /groupsay to /g.  I have not found a<br/>
&gt;shorthand for /guildsay yet.  /who can be as short as &quot;/w&quot; or just &#39;/&#39; by<br/>
&gt;itself.  You can see how many people are on your server with &quot;/w all count&quot;.<br/>
&gt;You can search for other bards in the zone by doing a &quot;/w bard&quot;, or on the<br/>
&gt;whole server with &quot;/w all bard&quot;, with the same being true of the other<br/>
&gt;classes &quot;/w wizard&quot; for instance when you&#39;re trying to remember who stole<br/>
&gt;your kill.  You can find out who in the zone is a certain level by saying<br/>
&gt;&quot;/w 25&quot; to see who&#39;s 25th, or &quot;/w 20 40&quot; to see who is 20th through 40th.<br/>
&gt;You can even go so far as to say something like &quot;/w all bard 40 50&quot; to find<br/>
&gt;all of the bards between 40th and 50th on your server.<br/>
