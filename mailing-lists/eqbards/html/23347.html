&gt;posted on the www.eqsongs.com website, I was doing around 172pts of damage<br/>
&gt;per tick (when all 3 stuck).  As many people have stated before on this<br/>
&gt;list, this is a helluva lot more damage than I can do with weapons equipped.<br/>
&gt;Like Minkin, I was doing so much damage to the mob that it almost always<br/>
&gt;ignored the warrior and attacked me.  Still amazes me though when other<br/>
&gt;classes ask me why I am not meleeing with weapons.  Even though the game has<br/>
&gt;been out for almost two years, there are still a lot of people who don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;realize what all a bard can do.<br/>

really understand the workings of a bard,  &quot;Selo&#39;s Dissertation on the <br/>

Also I enjoy the fact that a bard is effective no matter what play style <br/>
you use (weaps, instruments, mixed).<br/>
