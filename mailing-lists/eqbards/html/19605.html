<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-414903041">Your luck was worse then mine.  I only died 5 times in 2 days in Mistmoor<br/>
and Unrest this past weekend.  Friday night I had 4 bubbles of exp, by<br/>
Sunday night I had 2 :(<br/>
<br/>
I think the only places you can fight in Mistmoor would be:<br/>
1) On the ledge by the pond.  Very safe if you pull to the back of the lake<br/>
away from the path to the zone.  And don&#39;t pull any mobs while there is a<br/>
train at the zone!  Just chill for a couple minutes and keep the over<br/>
zealous tank in line.  I have seen mobs on their way back to the castle<br/>
that warp from the zone line to near the pond, then go aggro on the people<br/>
fighting near there.<br/>
2) In &quot;the corner&quot;.  It is on the other side of the tower from the pond.<br/>
Not safe if you are fighting there and a train passes.  But safe if you are<br/>
just standing around.  If you have to bail out while fighting here then run<br/>
underneath the little bridge that connects the tower to the castle.  The<br/>
mobs can&#39;t go through there, they are forced to go around and it gives you<br/>
a little more time to make it to the zone.<br/>
3) In the Graveyard, away from the fence.  I would usually fight near the<br/>
wall that runs in front of the tomb.<br/>
<br/>
Mistmoor tip #192: Don&#39;t hit any wandering mob (or one that looks out of<br/>
place) unless it hits you first.  Sometimes castle mobs (usually a skeleton<br/>
pet) appear near the zone line, but aren&#39;t really there.  There are also<br/>
mobs that wander through the Graveyard that aren&#39;t really there.<br/>
Mistmoor tip #44: If you are getting faction messages and didn&#39;t touch<br/>
anything, then zone out or camp and come back.  I was getting faction<br/>
message like mad the other night because I killed a familiar around a group<br/>
that was killing some other stuff.  I got faction messages for everything<br/>
they had killed.  Then about 5 minutes later I was still getting faction<br/>
messages, so I zoned to clear the hate list.<br/>
<br/>
Unrest is buggy but I never heard of DDD pulling other mobs.  If you are<br/>
hunting in the knight room then make sure someone has the bar room camped<br/>
else the mobs will come upstairs to kill you, and vise-versa.  If you are<br/>
camping the TC (torture chamber) then be advised that sometimes mobs can<br/>
warp in on you from other places while you are fighting.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
where they come from but I have had Hags, mushrooms and different skeletons<br/>
pop up.  If you are camping the ghost room then you are probably just nuts<br/>
:p.  The mob pathing is terrible.  Things tend to run away from the pit and<br/>
in to the wall.  As soon as they hit the wall they warp to the farside of<br/>
the pit on the ramp, and of course aggro the stuff in the pit.  If you hunt<br/>
there make sure you have a good cleric and someone for evacs, running for<br/>
the zone line is not really an option.<br/>
<br/>
I am going back to Unrest one more time just for another dark bone bracelet<br/>
(I hate camping the damn thing).  After that I am never going back to MM or<br/>
Unrest until the bugs are fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt;What part of Unrest is good for a mid/high 20s group?<br/>
