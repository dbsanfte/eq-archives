<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012002257">I completely agree.... the Manasong can be both a blessing (groups love me now)<br/>
and a curse (can you play manasong only please? Well no. Any other questions?)<br/>
<br/>
Following some of the suggestions on this list I use the following for rules:<br/>
<br/>
1. If mana is below 40% I will play manasong and 1 other melee buff.<br/>
2. If OOM (unless it&#39;s every fight then I tell them to manage there mana better)<br/>
then Manasong only if we are still fighting and need that nuke/healing<br/>
3. Always weave mana and healing during downtime.... unless I need a break then<br/>
straight mana or healing depending on the situation.<br/>
4. It&#39;s the casters job to stay in range of the song. I am not going to move<br/>
around to get them in<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t like it tough... leave the group or do just what you did.... in a<br/>
melee heavy group last night (SK, Paladin, 2 Bards, Cleric and Shaman w/pet) I<br/>
played mana (I was the low level bard) and the other Bard played melee buffs so<br/>
the casters could buff all of us.. then went to my melee bank until time to buff<br/>
again.. once we were Fully buffed we had 2 pullers and were chewing threw things<br/>
in the Overthere (we staggered them. One mob almost dead go pull, other mob<br/>
almost dead go pull. It was non stop. Hell the Cleric got to nuke some even!).<br/>
Until we decided to go to the Sarnak ruins and the other bard had an AOE song up<br/>
and aggroed a sarnak who promptly told all his friends. :-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW there is a spot in Overthere next to SF were the pathing is totally screwed<br/>
up. We were fear kiting by there and the mobs just ran in to the wall. Kept fear<br/>
up and killed them. Should I bug that or leave it to bad pathing? Reason I ask<br/>
is I don&#39;t want to get in trouble for a bug exploit.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone send me there downtime macro for weaving Mana and healing? I think I<br/>
need to set those up so I can spare my hands.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ugggg.  Last night was the first time someone actually said to me, &quot;just<br/>
play mana song&quot;.  I always thought I wouldn&#39;t get insulted but I did.  I<br/>
told him that he had to be kidding, it&#39;s going to take longer to kill the<br/>
mobs and you will be healing more.  He was the only caster in the group, so<br/>
I choose to buff the melee people.  After a couple minutes of arguing about<br/>
it (he found out I was right) he said, &quot;got to log, bye&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The mana song is a blessing and a curse.  Get a friggin&#39; enchanter if you<br/>
want constant mana regen.<br/>
