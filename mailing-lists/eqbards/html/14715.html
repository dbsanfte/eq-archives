<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You do not want to mess with shadowmen.  After about an hour of killing<br/>
  them they will be instant aggressive KOS.  And you will die.  I know<br/>
  L50 paladins that accidentally trip up on shadowmen camps who are slain<br/>
  before the even know what hit them.  My advice, don&#39;t bother shadowmen.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Powerleveling is still lots and lots of killing - dont expect that you will<br/>
&gt; get like a level in an hour or 2.  Getting a bubble of XP per hour is what I<br/>
&gt; would consider really good.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  At L23 you can do a level in 2 hours by powerleveling.  If you are<br/>
  bumming around with similar level people who are gaining exp with<br/>
  you then I don&#39;t consider that powerleveling, and most people would<br/>
  call that partying.  One bubble exp per hour only applies to levels<br/>
  over L35.  I&#39;ve been truly powerleveling people in south karana, and<br/>
  I took a L23 to L24 in a little over one hour.  You just need to know<br/>
  what you are doing and how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
  A bard is a melee/memblur machine.  No other memblur class can tote<br/>
  these claims, as they are all manabased and we all know manabased<br/>
  powerleveling creates enormous downtime.  A level 50 shaman took<br/>
  2!!! hours to take my L19 to L20.  It took me 30 mins to take her<br/>
  twink from L19 to L20.<br/>
  <br/>
  rough estimates:<br/>
<br/>
  centaur archer  = 1/4 bubble exp to L19<br/>
  centaur courser = 1/3 bubble exp to L19<br/>
  centaur charger = 1/2 bubble exp to L19<br/>
<br/>
  A high level bard can pull solo centaurs from the camp, and bring<br/>
  them to about 50 - 100 hp and then charm them and voila.  The <br/>
  twinkee now has a red con mob with 50 hp to slay.  The bard charm<br/>
  will keep the npc aggressive on the bard while the twinkee kills.<br/>
<br/>
  Chargers are no joke either, with chains+victory those L33 beasts<br/>
  can still really mess me up if they get lucky.<br/>
