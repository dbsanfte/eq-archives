<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133051081">At the levels you are talking about it depends more on the level of the<br/>
monster that dies than the level of your hunting partners - although the<br/>
number of them in the party will have an impact.  Try it and find out!<br/>
<br/>
I have grouped with a 30 warrior when I was 20 bard and I got xp TWO TIMES<br/>
FASTER than he did.  Now he had just entered his Hell level and had to get<br/>
many more kills to his bar a bub that I did.  But there were just 2 of us in<br/>
the party and the mobs were blue to him and red to me (pickclaw lookout in<br/>
highkeep.)<br/>
<br/>
At 22, I would group with a 24 25 and 26 and get almost NO xp - at least my<br/>
bubs filled VERY slowly.  And they were not slow attacking stuff and no huge<br/>
downtimes.  But the mobs they attacked were blue and yeller to them and<br/>
blue, yeller and occasional red to me.<br/>
<br/>
At 21, I grouped with a 48 lev magician and we camped the orgers in west k.<br/>
The baby og&#39;s were red.  The Chief was ded red.  Hell, the Chief&#39;s dog was<br/>
the only thing conned blue or yeller.  I got NO xp - some nice bone plate<br/>
armor and other mics oger loots. Why would a 48 lev mage ask me to camp with<br/>
him?  Maybe cuz I found him running around nekkid and ran him back to his<br/>
corpse w/o asking his lev or for any payments.<br/>
<br/>
I only had one good experience in Runny - and that was when a 30 lev druid<br/>
who knew the dungeon pull kings to the ramp for us - full party of 20-lo&#39;s<br/>
to kill.  Nice loots - I got Black Iron Medallion and Blackened Boots - dint<br/>
know they could kick magic&#39;s but guess they can.  There are some heavy duty<br/>
casters in there - Guardian Rythmn&#39;s and your drum - for sure!!<br/>

I am a level 18 bard on the Rathe. Some friends of mine are going to go to <br/>
Runneye in the warlords room tomorrow. The highest is a level 27 Shaman. I <br/>
know I won&#39;t be much use as for damage but I can add buffing and healing to <br/>
the mix easily. But can I group with them and get xp?<br/>
Thanks<br/>
