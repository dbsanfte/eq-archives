hit the dumps, some hit the jackpot.  I was merely warning the<br/>
owner of the crown that if he took the gilded road, he may<br/>
find that it didn&#39;t glitter quite as brightly as he&#39;d thought<br/>
it would.  Whether he takes my advice is up to him - maybe he<br/>
knows that the stuff I talked about doesn&#39;t matter to him, or<br/>
maybe it does matter and hadn&#39;t thought about it and my<br/>
advice saved him grief later on.<br/>

I will admit my original reply probably sounded condescending<br/>
towards powerlevelers (me being an explorer-type, if you speed<br/>
through the game, you&#39;re not learning many of the nuances that<br/>
give it depth).  But understand, I was only trying to make it<br/>
clear to him that he should think carefully before choosing<br/>
the &quot;easy&quot; route.<br/>

Most lottery winners in real life are not happier than before<br/>
they won.  In fact, the happiest ones tend to be the ones who<br/>
don&#39;t change their lifestyle.  Sense of achievement,<br/>
contribution, and self-worth are what matters to most.<br/>
