&gt; &gt; So, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>

&gt; &gt; 20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Which does absolutely nothing, as pillage enchantment strips buffs<br/>
&gt;   seemingly randomly.  My first buff was Illusion: DE yet he stripped<br/>
&gt;   my Agility and Strength in the first attack (which both were in the<br/>
&gt;   middle of my buff list).<br/>

chance that he will strip your usefull buffs.<br/>

&gt;   so much the melee peeps can do.  Too bad the programmers at Verant<br/>
&gt;   cannot get their stuff straight.  It&#39;s a shame the players have<br/>

they&#39;d fix that yesterday.  :(<br/>
