&gt; I forget, does it give you an AC bonus as well?<br/>

From stratics:<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of Warmth<br/>
Damage shield -1<br/>
Cold resist 10<br/>
Infravision 1<br/>
Defense 5<br/>
<br/>
So yes, it does provide an AC bonus.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s an AC bonus of 5 or not, since the damage<br/>
shield is certainly more than -1 and the cold resist is more than 10.  Bard songs have puzzling numbers in<br/>
the database, but the database is always right when it comes to whether a song has an effect or not.<br/>
