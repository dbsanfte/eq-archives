<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246116049">I also immediately added psalm of warmth to my playlist. While soloing,<br/>
I found John K&#39;s formula to be correct, although my version was a bit<br/>
more simple: If mob hits you (on average) 3 times before you can bellow<br/>
twice, it&#39;s better to have Psalm playing than bellowing.<br/>
<br/>
I was in CT yesterday, in a group of 5 players. We were the only people<br/>
in the zone (yay), and when I pulled, I would often get 5-6 lizzies<br/>
joining in. Singing Psalm, the &quot;a Lizard Defender was burned&quot; spam was<br/>
incredible. As you may know lizzies attack FAST. so they were hitting<br/>
often, and for medium to small damage. VERY rough estimate that in one<br/>
battle, with 6 lizzies hitting on 4 targets (burner rarely got hit, he<br/>
was good), psalm (doing 6 dam per hit) may have burned the lizzies 20<br/>
times each. that comes to 120 damage*6 or 720hp of damage throughout the<br/>
combat. Not bad, try doing that with bellow :). (again VERY rough<br/>
estimate).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Psalm DOES increase in efficiency with number of party members, as<br/>
long as number of mobs increases also.]<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just got level 25 last night and memmed Psalm of<br/>
&gt; Warmth.  I like the damage shield alot.  Anyway, I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t heard much discussion about this song other<br/>
&gt; than the damage it does.  I was wondering what<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s opinions of it are.  I&#39;m thinking it would be<br/>
&gt; great in a group and pretty awesome solo.  Yet i never<br/>
&gt; hear anyone talking about twisting it in.  If you do<br/>
&gt; twist it in, what do you end up twisting it with?<br/>
