<div id="ygrps-yiv-428828002"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; From: Perhaps a Princess... [mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sarah@...">sarah@...</a>]<br/>
&gt;&gt; Actually, by &quot;True newbie&quot; I meant at levels 1-15 or so.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Rats!  Almost 14 months into this game and I&#39;m still a newbie!  Heh heh.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*grin* Its only since Kunark came out that I&#39;ve finally started<br/>
pulling out of this state myself. And I still have some characters<br/>
within it (I can&#39;t seem to stay put with one character.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;NEVER DESTROY COPPERS!!  Kindly drop them near zone edges when poor newbies<br/>
&gt;like me can pick them up  (said the encumbered bard twisting Selo&#39;s & Chant<br/>
&gt;all the way from Oasis to Freeport bank &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I HATE littering. If I see baggies on the ground I pick them up (and yes,<br/>
I save fishing grubs. Use them to fish with and you can turn them into 2s<br/>
each!)<br/>
It is only coppers i, reluctantly, destroy.<br/>
<br/>
And if I was that close to a city, I&#39;d go back to the city myself instead of<br/>
destroying. Right now, I&#39;m mostly fighting in Frontier Mountains in Kunark.<br/>
(And mourning every copper I destroy. I pick up the coppers and silvers of<br/>
others and only dest when I get to, like, 94/80)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; As a twink, I group with whoever I can find to group with. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t look<br/>
&gt;&gt; at equipment. Shoot, I don&#39;t know whether most of it is &quot;good or bad&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; even. What I look at is first, personality. SOmeone I can get along<br/>
&gt;&gt; with. and second, level range. Can I group with them. Occasionally,<br/>
&gt;&gt; we&#39;ll be specifically looking for a tank-type, or a healer-type. Or<br/>
&gt;&gt; a Snarer. But that&#39;s about it :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It depends on your interests in the game.  If you&#39;re playing to level, and<br/>
&gt;your twinked, then you&#39;re better off to play with other twinks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But better to play with anyone than to sit aorund lookin for a perfect<br/>
group. But yeah, I play to have fun more than to level. So.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;both on.  Personality matters, but that&#39;s not as quickly apparent.  Class<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t matter at all.  I like to experiment with different group make ups<br/>
&gt;and find ways to make each combo work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been lucky lately to find groups with the same people repeatedly.<br/>
That is when personality starts to matter. Class matters when you have three<br/>
tanks and really desperately need a cleric to reduce downtime -- you can<br/>
handle<br/>
everything you are doing. But you need somebody to reduce downtime (Bard<br/>
works.<br/>
Heal song is better htan nothing. i&#39;ve even been known to take a paladin<br/>
on heal-duty when desperate :)</div>
