<div id="ygrps-yiv-911381838">It actually looks really good (I think).  I&#39;ve had a lot of people say its<br/>
the best effect they&#39;ve ever seen.  Afterlife has a few pics on thier board.<br/>
I took a few pics of mine, but they&#39;re on my home computer and I&#39;m at work<br/>
right now.<br/>

Does anyone have a picture of the particle effects on this sword or know a<br/>
url that has a shot?  I&#39;m curious about what it looks like.<br/>
