&gt; Try this if you are fighting bigtime casters, put on a drum and sit that<br/>

&gt; is with 100+ magic resistance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At L19, Guardian Rhythms raised magic resist by +25 using a<br/>
drum.  Elemental Rhythms raised it by +25 as well.  At L20, it<br/>
was +27 each.  So I imagine it&#39;ll be a while before I can use<br/>
just these two songs to get everyone&#39;s magic resist to 100.<br/>
Right now I can only do that if a spellcaster casts Endure<br/>
Magic first.<br/>

&gt; mandolin/lute.  The 5hp or so per pulse can not keep up with the dmg the<br/>
&gt; party is taking.  I say put the creature down as quickly as you can.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; until you get to 23, Anthem and 2 Bellows, while boring, is most effective<br/>
&gt; and i think that is exactly what i did.  then AFTER the fight, put on a<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another thing to keep in mind (and something I intentionally<br/>
didn&#39;t mention in my previous reply because I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
confuse what is already very confusing to analyze) is how many<br/>
party members there are.  The more people in your party, the<br/>
less effect Bellow has on reducing the combat duration, and<br/>
the more effect Restoration has (assuming multiple people are<br/>
damaged).<br/>

&gt; to play heal, as there is always a cleric or druid in your party who can<br/>
&gt; heal 400+ hp in one spell, and your mana song regenerates their mana far<br/>
&gt; faster than your heal song can regen their hp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That will feel very strange, not having Restoration memorized.<br/>
:-)  Does Clarity increase the mana regeneration rate only<br/>
during meditation, or all the time?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Personally I don&#39;t like being &quot;ordered&quot; to do anything in a group, by leader<br/>
&gt; or other members.  They do not play a bard, therefore they can not know all<br/>
&gt; of our benefits to a party.  If the group asks and we agree on a strategy,<br/>
&gt; no problem.  but if it pisses you off like it does me to be ordered around,<br/>
&gt; just tell them &quot;next time you tell me to play that song will be the last<br/>
&gt; time i play it.&quot;  usually that shuts them up, especially if it is the mana<br/>
&gt; song =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I think it&#39;s helpful to discuss strategy with the group<br/>
beforehand.  I&#39;ve been grouping with the same 5-10 people for<br/>
a while now, so they pretty much know how to work with a bard<br/>
(my current gripe is with the paladins not using Lay Hands on<br/>
me until one bubble of life remaining, which is well beyond my<br/>
fail-safe point to hit Accelerando and get out of Dodge).  If<br/>
there are differing opinions on what&#39;s the best strategy, then<br/>
it may be in the group&#39;s best interest for the leader to<br/>
dictate which strategy be followed.  But yeah, I&#39;d be pretty<br/>
pissed if a clueless leader told me what songs to play.<br/>
<br/>
We pulled off one helluva feat last night.  One of the<br/>
low-level paladins kept insisting on pulling, and due to the<br/>
monster frenzy thing, we ended up with an entire orc camp and<br/>
just about every orc nearby on us, along with a couple undead.<br/>
I&#39;d estimate there were about 12-15 orcs total, ranging from<br/>
green to white to me at L20.  I pulled every trick I knew with<br/>
lullaby, getting the train fixated on me, then running around<br/>
in circles nearby while the group finished off the few orcs<br/>
that stuck with them.  Then I&#39;d swing through the group again<br/>
to let them pick off a few more orcs, repeat.  It was close<br/>
and a lot of passerbys jumped in to help, but we all lived.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think we could&#39;ve done it if the group hadn&#39;t learned<br/>
the &quot;everyone attack the same mob&quot; and &quot;let the bard handle<br/>
the train&quot; strategies I&#39;ve been pounding into them.  :-)<br/>
