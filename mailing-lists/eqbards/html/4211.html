that aren&#39;t widely known is inconsiderate of those with whom you are<br/>
supposedly trying to communicate.  Pointing people to an immense list of<br/>
definitions is simply a way of saying you can&#39;t be bothered to type out<br/>
words that would be relatively sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM systems difficult<br/>
and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>
companies moved away from secret code.<br/>
<br/>
Acronyms are the rudest form of slang and jargon.  They are even worse than<br/>
obscure words like &quot;proc&quot; because they aren&#39;t even pronouncable words.<br/>
Acronyms are effectively a way to invent new words on the fly, then use<br/>
them and berate the reader for not knowing what they mean.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll warn you now that I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the computer<br/>
industry for 30 years, with some success.  People either get the point and<br/>
behave less rudely or miss the point and continue to speak in secret code,<br/>
either not understanding or simply not caring whether they&#39;re communicating<br/>
with the majority of their audience.  If you don&#39;t mind if the majority of<br/>
the readers simply don&#39;t know what you meant and probably won&#39;t bother to<br/>
find out, use them, but don&#39;t kid yourself.<br/>
