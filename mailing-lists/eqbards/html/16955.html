<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257705163">The misconception is because those mobs may run past the people in other<br/>
groups.  In a fully populated LIVE server this is a minimal, if any, risk<br/>
because the dungeons are so over-camped.<br/>
<br/>
In a nearly empty (of players) dungeon, those npc&#39;s may well wander back to<br/>
their spawn point right PAST another group.  Aggroing on them (and possibly<br/>
aggroing other NPC&#39;s around them) and getting them killed as well.<br/>
<br/>
While Screech itself doesn&#39;t cause the train, those returning npc&#39;s can.<br/>
Remember, this is in a fully popped lower guk with 2, maybe 3 groups on dead<br/>
side.  Sending 5 or 6 froggies running off from a room is going to get<br/>
anyone in a room nearby aggro&#39;d (and likely killed)  When the npc&#39;s return<br/>
to the room they started at they WILL get pissed at the people they walk by.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before.  On a live server which is overcrowded, screech is<br/>
AWESOME crowd control.  But in a fully popped zone it&#39;s a surefire way to<br/>
get people in other groups around you killed.<br/>

&gt; The big myth is that screech causes trains - it doesn&#39;t if you evac or<br/>
&gt; zone.  The mobs are running away and other people only get added to the<br/>
&gt; hate lists if they attempt to attack.  Once the offending parties zone the<br/>
&gt; mobs will continue to run until fear wears off and then will mosey on back<br/>
&gt; to their spawn spots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really can&#39;t see how using dirge to clear the path for evac is useful:<br/>
&gt; In the same 3 seconds you could either hit 4 mobs and yourself for 300-odd<br/>
&gt; damage or clear away a good 90% of the mobs for the duration of the evac.<br/>
