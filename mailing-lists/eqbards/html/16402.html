<div id="ygrps-yiv-268327618">Bulls drop them too. I&#39;ve got 3 so far. All I did was kill every bull I<br/>
could find every time I went through innothule on my way to guk. There&#39;s<br/>
a tower with skeletons in it that often has at least one bull stuck on<br/>
the top floor. I killed that every time I passed, as well as any I could<br/>
find with tracking. The skin is just an incredibly rare drop.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone knows?  Also btw, does anyone know where to find an alligator<br/>
&gt; skin?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Our druid has looked for weeks in Innouthoule with no luck.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I heard off bull alligators.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually it&#39;s off a &quot;Huge Alligator&quot; which is a very rare spawn in Innothule<br/>
&gt; Swamp.  Since Beta 2 I have seen the gator a total of maybe 10 times.  But I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t camp/hunt him so he may be slightly more frequent.  I did spend 5<br/>
&gt; hours killing every gator in sight with my ranger once and couldn&#39;t get him<br/>
&gt; to spawn.  (Would explain why that skullcap is such a rarely owned quest<br/>
&gt; item)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS:  I too am trying that quest.  I gave up and am waiting until I hit 35 so<br/>
&gt; I can track.  I don&#39;t like wasting my Ranger&#39;s time tracking down items for<br/>
&gt; my bard.  He doesn&#39;t even know her after all.<br/>
