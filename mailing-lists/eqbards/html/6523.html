&gt; That&#39;s a good point.  I know Aria of Eagles suffers from the<br/>
&gt; same problem (overriding the levitate spell), and Aquatic Ayre<br/>
&gt; probably does as well.  That they&#39;re concentrating only on the<br/>
&gt; SoW fix really makes me wonder if anyone who works there even<br/>
&gt; plays a bard.<br/>

in (all the chants) leads me to believe that not even their testers<br/>
don&#39;t play bards. Someone obviously tested them by targetting<br/>
themselves, because that&#39;s the only thing they worked on for over a<br/>
month.<br/>
