<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433361863">I am fairly certain he was only refering to 2 songs. 1. Level 40 Nivs Melody of Preservation, which has a spell damage absorbtion component and 2.Level 52 Nillipus&#39; March of Wee, which has a melee damage absorbtion.<br/>
<br/>
These 2 songs both have around  15 point damage obsorbtion which, Like in the case of Wee, had about a 15 point damage absorbing component. You would sing the song, but when a person would get hit for more than the  absorbing element, the buff would drop. That made no sense since its a BATTLE buff and really the only person who needed the ac/agil and things IS the person getting HIT. Kinda silly.. Excellent fix.<br/>
<br/>
I for one am SOOOOOO looking forward to the 2nd resist being lowered for the Song of Twilight. Maybe its just me but Twilight(level 53) seems to be resisted ALOT more than the already heavily resisted Pixie Strike.<br/>

  I am at work and can&#39;t get on to the Internet now to check out the post.<br/>
  So maybe someone can clarify this for me.  Is Absor also referring to Psalm<br/>
  of warmth and cooling?  They have &quot;damage shields&quot;, not damage absorption<br/>
  shields.  If the Psalms are being nerfed I&#39;ll be pretty pissed... I like<br/>
  the damage shields.  I would like to assume that Absor is refering to ONLY<br/>
  damage absorption shields but assuming something that Verant does only<br/>
  makes and ass out of you and me.<br/>

  &gt;Absor:<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;&quot;I have some information about changes we will be making to a few bard<br/>
  &gt;songs with the next patch.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Songs with a damage shield component will have that component removed.<br/>
  &gt;Pixie Strike will have its secondary resist reduced.<br/>
  &gt;Song of Twilight will be singable at any time of the day. Its secondary<br/>
  &gt;resist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration. And<br/>
  &gt;it will require an instrument.<br/>
  &gt;The single target haste spells will be self-only.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;We will also be revising the bardic epic weapon.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;This should all go live with the next patch, which for now we are<br/>
  &gt;tentatively scheduling for late next week.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I&#39;m not sure what to think.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;The removal of the damage shields is sort of OK, it means that the songs<br/>
  &gt;won&#39;t drop now.  These songs aren&#39;t so great though, and it would have<br/>
  &gt;been nice if something had been added to them.  (A damage shield<br/>
  &gt;perhaps).<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Pixie Strike is good.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Song of Twilight is good.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Single target haste songs will be self only?  Not sure what that means.<br/>
  &gt;As far as I can remember off the top of my head, the only single target<br/>
  &gt;song that isn&#39;t self-only is Jonathan&#39;s Provocation, which I have rarely<br/>
  &gt;used, but it was useful to use it on other targets sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>
  &gt;hardly useful to use it on myself.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Mostly good, I guess, if the secondary resist for Pixie Strike is low<br/>
  &gt;enough.  Of course, I&#39;m long past using the song.<br/>
