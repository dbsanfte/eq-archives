<b>Subject:</b> Re: JM, shed some light? Bard magnets ..... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-391040748">I am going to have to back up our younger bardic friend.  There is most<br/>
definatly some bard aggro bugwhich can occur in seemingly any zone.  I have<br/>
personally experienced this super aggro in butcherblock, oasis, and unrest.<br/>
When I was in oasis, orcs were barelling over the dunes to find me, you can see<br/>
quite a ways in oasis so I would see several dark forms off in the distance<br/>
beelining for me and when they got close, hey 5-6 orcs all over. What joy!<br/>
Thank Erollisi for Selo&#39;s (the biggest lifesaver of them all)  This has happened<br/>
to me in those other zones as well... for no apparent reason, no group attacking<br/>
anything like you suggest, things come out f the woodworks and ignore the<br/>
medding nukers and beeline for the bard.  Its disgustingly insane, even when we<br/>
have to zone to clear the faction list.<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
JM, Care to comment?<br/>

&gt; Hmmm, bards have the rep for being monster magnets.  But you prolly need to<br/>
&gt; play your songs no matter what  but not AE (Area Effect).  You dint say<br/>
&gt; zactly how young you are but the gnolls will go agro on people they see that<br/>
&gt; look tasty to them.  they can tell how young you are and will attack you if<br/>
&gt; they think they can win. As you get older they get smarter and if they are<br/>
&gt; trival to you they don&#39;t attack.  Unless of course their friends have<br/>
&gt; whipped them in to a frenzy and they are trying to help - ie you have<br/>
&gt; started a train.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Selos is not an area effect on NPC&#39;s so it should not matter.  But if one of<br/>
&gt; your party had attacked that gnoll and gotten on its hate list - then when<br/>
&gt; it comes up and see you helping the party - it gets mad at you and attacks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you play an aera effect - like chords in a place like BB - that&#39;s very<br/>
&gt; high traffic and multi- level - you will get a LOT of attention real<br/>
&gt; quick!!!  So don&#39;t play AE songs in dungeons - as a rule.<br/>

&gt;                 Hello everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                 As a young bard who&#39;s had her fill of lurking around here, I<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt;                 I&#39;d venture forth and ask a really simple question!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                 I&#39;ve just returned home from a long long trip to Black<br/>
&gt; Burrow where<br/>
&gt;                 all the gnolls hang out.  Boy was it dangerous!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                 Anyway, when sitting down with my group while all the spell<br/>
&gt; chuckers<br/>
&gt;                 recovered from their oh so hard zapping, playing a nice tune<br/>
&gt; just in<br/>
&gt;                 case we needed to run for the exit, it didn&#39;t take long for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;                 nearest gnoll to suddenly turn and jump on me.  Not the<br/>
&gt; meditating<br/>
&gt;                 high elves oh no, ignore everyone else and straight for<br/>
&gt; little old me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                 So what I&#39;m asking is ..... were they just offended by the<br/>
&gt; slightly<br/>
&gt;                 different interpretation I placed on Selo&#39;s, or do I have<br/>
&gt; some sort of<br/>
&gt;                 bad guy magnet attached to me!  I deliberately avoided my<br/>
&gt; hymn of<br/>
&gt;                 restoration because I&#39;d heard they really don&#39;t like you<br/>
&gt; helping<br/>
&gt;                 people, but does this hatred run to any kind of song<br/>
&gt; disturbing their<br/>
&gt;                 clearly very peaceful home?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                 Oh, and if a nice friendly L24 and up bard is hanging out<br/>
&gt; here who<br/>
&gt;                 donated a bronze helmet to a rather under-dressed me at the<br/>
&gt; docks in<br/>
&gt;                 Butcherblock a couple of weeks ago, can I just say thank you<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt;                 much, it&#39;s saved my life on a number of occasions :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                 Thanks everyone, see ya out there!<br/>
