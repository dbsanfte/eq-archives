<div id="ygrps-yiv-50850883">I am starting to see people sell it.  Someone was asking 5k for the boots.  Anyone<br/>
else seeing prices?<br/>
<br/>
Hehe I have to think to myself: if I sold my fishbone earring and bought a pair of<br/>
Singing Steel gauntlets (not as good as getting them mind you, and I have been<br/>
hanging around Karnor lately ;P) then what other bauble could I also get?  For me or<br/>
my baby cleric ;P.<br/>
