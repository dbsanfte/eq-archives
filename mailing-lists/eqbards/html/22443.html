<div id="ygrps-yiv-773680976">Thanks for the prompt reply, Talies.   This started with me stealing from a<br/>
third player.  The Wizard jumped in and , after making her chase me to<br/>
Kithicore, I more or less conceded defeat.  But the wizard didn&#39;t want to<br/>
end the game yet so she accused me of stealing from her too.  It&#39;s all in<br/>
the name of fun and she&#39;s been VERY sportsmanlike about bending the rules<br/>
of EQ to allow a few of my moves.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll shoot the arrow at the skeleton just before Immobilize wears<br/>
off.  Then run for the zone.  If she allows the move, the skeleton will<br/>
eventually fall back and forget about me, but it will be in her path as she<br/>
chases me.  I&#39;m counting on the stuns, cause she&#39;s got Jboots and I don&#39;t.<br/>

&gt;My level 14 rogue is engaged in a virtual duel via email with a level 45<br/>

&gt;My thought was to shoot an arrow and a skeleton that just spawned behind<br/>

&gt;What are the chances something like this would work in-game?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably not, since in order for a monster to switch targets, it needs to<br/>
have distance issues.  If you can&#39;t move farther from the wizard, that<br/>
skelly will just ignore her and move on to you.<br/>
<br/>
FYI 14 vs 45 - just give her the darn thing back.<br/>
