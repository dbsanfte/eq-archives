&gt;Yeah I made it all the way to 31.  Too bad I have a life.  My fleibility is<br/>
&gt;nowhere what it was at level 18 even.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be interested to read why you think so?<br/>
<br/>
You got Sonorous Clouding, Consonant Chain, Appalling Screen, Song of the <br/>
Sirens. I agree, these aren&#39;t the best group songs, but all are highly <br/>
effective for the solo bard.<br/>
<br/>
What is it at level 18 that you were able to do that you are now unable to <br/>
do at 31? (no sarcasm here, I really do want to hear what you think.)<br/>
