<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209159817">When I listed the Bard quests I knew about (before this latest patch), I <br/>
neglected to mention one which is a mystery to me...<br/>
<br/>
If you talk to the fellow in the Bard&#39;s Guild in Qeynos that&#39;s carrying a <br/>
flute he&#39;ll mention how the &quot;collect-the-watch-reports&quot; guy made it for <br/>
him, cuz his father was a master flute craftsman. Now, if you talk to the <br/>
dude outside (watch reports guys) and spend about half an hour trying a <br/>
perplexing array of confusing grammar and hesitant and vague replies you&#39;ll <br/>
find out that this guy has stopped making magical flutes.<br/>
<br/>
I got no more out of him, no matter what I tried (about another half an <br/>
hour).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone gotten further?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s frustrating that there&#39;s this inconsistency in the way quests work - <br/>
you sometimes have to hit them with phrases that aren&#39;t in []&#39;s. Not to <br/>
mention the typos, irrelevant gender-specific replies and the lack of <br/>
versatility. I don&#39;t mean to go off on a rant here... so I&#39;ll just hush up <br/>
now ;)<br/>

P.S. Any juicy loot from these new FedEx quests?</div>
