&gt; No the shaman spell is 50hp for 25 mana.<br/>

answers.  One said it was exactly the same as the mana stone, and one<br/>
agrees with your numbers of 50 hp and 25 mana.  So, I&#39;m assuming I was<br/>
misinformed, and I stand corrected.  However, both were quick to bring up<br/>
that to use cannabalize effeciently, they have to cast it 20 times, which<br/>
takes like 2 to 3 minutes.  Mana stoning 20 times takes about 15 seconds,<br/>
and the rest of the time could be spent medding.  So in the end, the mana<br/>
stone is better, according to both of them anyways.<br/>
