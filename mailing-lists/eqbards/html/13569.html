<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139768577"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>
&gt; whatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - 15,<br/>
&gt; 20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Which does absolutely nothing, as pillage enchantment strips buffs<br/>
  seemingly randomly.  My first buff was Illusion: DE yet he stripped<br/>
  my Agility and Strength in the first attack (which both were in the<br/>
  middle of my buff list).<br/>
<br/>
  Our L22 song is the same way.  It took me 4 pulses to remove resist<br/>
  fire from myself, and Reso/SoW took 2 or 3.  Things that stripped<br/>
  first:  Shaman buffs.  Things that went last:  Resist buffs.<br/>
<br/>
  In the wave against Nagafen, I had 170 FR.  And again, I lost<br/>
  a full bubble of health, confirmed this time with 2100+ hps. <br/>
  <br/>
  DragonBreath does one bubble of damage if you are in melee range<br/>
  as a minimum (with 2000 hps).  The key here is in melee range, as<br/>
  our cleric was hit with AE far back, and took much much less dmg.<br/>
  Magic resist in the 200s, and I still got feared once briefly.<br/>
<br/>
  The new AE Fear also bugs casters as once they are hit, there is<br/>
  a chance they will not be able to cast spells.  (You have not <br/>
  recovered... permanently)  With our casters in this state, it<br/>
  was pure melee that brought the dragon to the &#39;Lord&#39; in Lord <br/>
  Nagafen.  But it was without healing and nuking, umm hehe there&#39;s only<br/>
  so much the melee peeps can do.  Too bad the programmers at Verant<br/>
  cannot get their stuff straight.  It&#39;s a shame the players have<br/>
  to pay for their constant mistakes.<br/>
