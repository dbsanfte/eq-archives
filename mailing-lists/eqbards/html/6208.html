<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205384449">Hail and well met fellow bards of Norrath,<br/>
<br/>
I come to you today with several small problems looking for assistance and advice.  When I first joined this list, you all seemed to think that the major component of a bard&#39;s attributes was Charisma, so on all of the suggestions I axed my human bard with low charisma (who&#39;s body I could not recover anywho) and made my half-elf bard with a whopping 110 starting charisma.  Anyway.....<br/>
<br/>
That has now come back to bite me in the ass.  I am now at level 20 (FINALLY!!!!!!) and am in search of bronze plate.  Unfortunately, med bronze seems incredibly rare (and expensive-I still haven&#39;t found the cash cow that everyone talks about hehe) to purchase.  So I am now in Permafrost where the bronze lives.  So now I have 3 pieces-breastplate, sleeves (vambraces, whatever) and a mask.  Only problem is that now I am only 10 from my total carrying weight (which is a whopping 82 buffed).  I plan on just getting the visible pieces, minus the boots-they just seem so uncomfortable.  With a pair of greaves, one bracer and the helm, I shan&#39;t be able to carry anything anymore!<br/>
<br/>
Here are my questions:<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me of STR items it would be possible for me to get.  (I have one ring (I forget what kind) +2, and a purity belt, and a spiked collar.)<br/>
Please bear in mind that I am poor (50pp in the bank on a good day) and I like to live.<br/>
Also if any other people out there know off the cuff, who drops the greaves (bronze leggings) and the bronze helm in Permafrost.  Is it a named somebody or is it a random thing?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all in advance!<br/>
