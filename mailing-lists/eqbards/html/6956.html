<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379883695">I think this e-mail looks great, but I do agree that we should comment on<br/>
the changed behavior of Selo&#39;s and SOW.  I had thought that Selo&#39;s breaking<br/>
root was a confirmed feature of the song (I&#39;m positive I remember someone<br/>
from Verant making that comment once) which is now broken.  This should, at<br/>
least, be investigated.<br/>

They need to fix the Selo&#39;s/SOW conflict.  Either the program should <br/>
recognize that multiple effects are in place and use the strongest active <br/>
effect at a given time (which would be my vastly preferred solution, <br/>
although it may be too tough to code), or we must be permitted to cancel <br/>
SOW.</div>
