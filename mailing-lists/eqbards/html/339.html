 </span></blockquote>The reality of the software business is that you have to work on the next<br/>
release and maintain the current release(s).  There&#39;s some overlap, as bugs<br/>
in the current release should be fixed in the next one as well as for the<br/>
current one (via maintenance releases), but keeping all that staffed and<br/>
under control is a difficult job.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that Verant barely had the staff to not quite finish the<br/>
initial release and they&#39;re now completely swamped attempting to maintain<br/>
it, including finishing details and fixing bugs, and on top of that they&#39;re<br/>
trying to figure out what they can realistically do next.  Along with that<br/>
there&#39;s the ongoing operation of the servers, since this sort of game play<br/>
requires their ongoing work and support.<br/>
<br/>
All that said means I understand the bind I figure they&#39;re in, but that<br/>
still doesn&#39;t entirely excuse the lack of communication.  Their<br/>
documentation is abysmal.  The game is complex and rich to the point that<br/>
it&#39;s very hard to tell bugs from game features, which means that people can<br/>
easily waste many hours of game play trying to do or use something that&#39;s<br/>
broken rather than appropriately obscure.  There&#39;s little excuse for<br/>
letting that situation continue.  Among all their people they should be<br/>
able to dedicate one or two to keeping people from beating their heads<br/>
against blind alleys (to mix a metaphor).<br/>
<br/>
As a bard and a tailor (and in another personna a warrior and a smith), I&#39;d<br/>
settle for some effects not working for a while if I simply knew which were<br/>
broken and which I haven&#39;t understood but should work out in game.  There&#39;s<br/>
enough there to have plenty of fun while I wait for fixes and finishes, but<br/>
I resent wasting on wild-goose chases any of the too much time I already<br/>
spend in the game.<br/>
