<br/>
I wasn&#39;t intending to tell the rogue that he had no place getting an EBW, I<br/>
was just uninformed as to the state of rogue weapons and was wondering if<br/>
there were better choices for a rogue than the EBW. I was going to use that<br/>
information to fuel my argument that the EBW is one of the top 2 non planar<br/>
weapons for a bard and that the same did not hold true for rogues.<br/>
<br/>
Upon searching the web, and talking here and in a few other forums I&#39;ve<br/>
found that rogues are basically in the same boat as we are weapon wise, and<br/>
that the EBW would be a fine off hand weapon for a rogue.<br/>

i think he meant who are bards to tell a rogue 1hs is worthless to them.<br/>
(and it wasn&#39;t preferential, it was a lotto from what i read.  the bard in<br/>
the group just felt rogues shouldn&#39;t get it) tho i could be wrong<br/>

&gt; &gt; That&#39;s another thing to consider.  If you&#39;re going<br/>
&gt; &gt; to base it<br/>
&gt; &gt; on who will get the best use out of it, are you<br/>
&gt; &gt; basing it on<br/>
&gt; &gt; raw numerical improvement, or percentage<br/>
&gt; &gt; improvement?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand the discomfort here...and I am NOT<br/>
&gt; lashing out at anyone, but:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *** who are we to tell someone else how to build their<br/>
&gt; character? ***<br/>
<br/>
???<br/>
<br/>
The person asked for reasons why a rogue shouldn&#39;t get<br/>
preferential treatment for an EBW.  I gave a bunch of points<br/>
shooting holes in the &quot;a rogue can use it better than a bard&quot;<br/>
argument.<br/>
