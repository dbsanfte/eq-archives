<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069273252">This is a totally bogus answer.  Our effects (not that I&#39;m likely to get the<br/>
items) are parlor tricks compared to what the other plate wearing classes<br/>
get.  Our armor&#39;s AC is lower than all the other plate wearing classes and<br/>
even lower than the ranger armor.  How does this make any kind of balance<br/>
sense?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to figure out where they got the idea that we would have a<br/>
use for Enduring Breath (we have the spell and are guaranteed never to be<br/>
out of the radius) and Summon drink (we are one of only 3 classes to get<br/>
forage).  It&#39;s bizarre.  Seems to me like another case of:<br/>
Question: 	&quot;We have no idea what effect to put on Bard armor&quot;<br/>
Answer: 	&quot;Hmmm, me neither, hey that fishbone earring is popular,<br/>
give them<br/>
		Enduring Breath, and Summon Water goes well with that theme&quot;<br/>
<br/>

	back to being annoyed I guess<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, let me make sure I understand this. The effect on the boots and gloves<br/>
is so powerful that they made the AC lower.<br/>
<br/>
1) When these items started dropping they had the same AC and no effect at<br/>
all.<br/>
2) How is Enduring Breath and Summon Drink better so much better than Fury,<br/>
Snare, Cancel Magic (just some of the effects I&#39;ve seen on other class<br/>
specific items) that is requires a lower AC than Rangers who can&#39;t even wear<br/>
plate?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
At least if we accidentally summon way too much water, we have enduring<br/>
breath so we won&#39;t drown.<br/>
