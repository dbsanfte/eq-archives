<br/>
I would recommend finding something lighter that<br/>
doesn&#39;t bring down your stamina when fighting...look<br/>
for something under 5 lbs.<br/>
<br/>
A friend in my guild sold me a thulian claw (I&#39;m still<br/>
paying on it...) that does just this.  There are other<br/>
weapons that would do just as well.  You might want to<br/>
check out the bard weapon section of maximumeg as the<br/>
comments and going price listed there will help you<br/>
target the weapon you want.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am new to the list and I would like to say that it<br/>
&gt; is wonderful the<br/>
&gt; information that is shared among the bards of EQ. I<br/>
&gt; am a lvl 11 Bard on the<br/>
&gt; Karana server and I need some information please.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My bard is a half-elf and I currently have a full<br/>
&gt; set of bronze armor and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; equipped with a Turtle-shell Helm and I have a<br/>
&gt; barbed leather whip and the<br/>
&gt; screaming mace for weapons. I currently have the<br/>
&gt; standard instruments, the<br/>
&gt; drum for the spidersilk quest and a mandolin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question is this....what kind of armor, weapons,<br/>
&gt; and instruments would be<br/>
&gt; worthy of investment for me at this point?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My finances are slightly better, though not great,<br/>
&gt; than a normal lvl 11 as my<br/>
&gt; bard is my secondary character, albeit quickly<br/>
&gt; becoming primary because I love<br/>
&gt; being a bard!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any help and advice would be greatly<br/>
&gt; appreciated....Thanks!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
