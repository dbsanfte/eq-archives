<b>Subject:</b> RE: Twinking - please stop this discussion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773665383">sure, if you&#39;re gonna make twinking threads, can you have twinking in the<br/>
subject so i can make an inbox rule to delete all the stupid things<br/>
automatically.  If you guys have so many opinions on twinking, look at it<br/>
another way, think of all the EQ economie in a couple more months, right now<br/>
smithing is allready worthless as a skill. bronze plate is getting cheaper<br/>
and cheaper too.  Its simple, as more and more players level up, more and<br/>
more good stuff will surface and mroe and more the stuff will become cheaper<br/>
and you&#39;ll see tons of level 1 players running around with mental armor that<br/>
you only dream about today, give it up. put it to rest, i didnt subscribe to<br/>
this email list to hear every tom dick and harry&#39;s opinion on twinking.  Was<br/>
hoping to hear stuff on quests and such, but i think there&#39;s only a couple<br/>
threads that covered those...<br/>

P.S. get off the &quot;but its easy to hit delete&quot; crap.<br/>
P.S.S. as you say &quot;just hit delete&quot;.... i say twinking will always be there,<br/>
and will be even more in the futur, live with it, deal with it. if you cant<br/>
deal with it, dont play.<br/>

&gt; It is very easy to delete the ones that are about twinking.  Obviously<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; everyone replying there is an interest and varying opinions on the<br/>
&gt; subject.<br/>
&gt; I guess I could make a EQ_Twinking mailing list :)  I don&#39;t mind reading<br/>
&gt; off<br/>
&gt; topic discussions as long as they are interesting.  At least we are<br/>
&gt; discussing the twinking of bards :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; This list is EQBARDS, not EQTwinking.  It&#39;s fine to discuss off-topic<br/>
&gt; &gt; things<br/>
&gt; &gt; every once in a while, but this thread has gone too far.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s get back to some bard topics.<br/>
