<div id="ygrps-yiv-873843750">Optimal Settings/Options...  PC spells OFF. Particle Density OFF. I remember <br/>
being d/c from just seeing 15-20 messages of &quot;stunned by scintillating <br/>
colors&quot;... not fun missing out on the exp of that pull hehe.<br/>
<br/>
In AE group, you may very well be the puller, but only when each caster is <br/>
gtg on mana... our guild has 4 active 59-60 wizzies and they hate exp the <br/>
traditional way, so whenever they get the chance they hit Seb, HS, chardok <br/>
for AE group.<br/>
<br/>
As a bard in AE group, at 54 (Selos Assonant Strane) you get AE slow/snare, <br/>
and 55 (Cantana of Replenishment) you get C2 song, and 59 (Denon&#39;s <br/>
Bereavement) is AE mr debuff and DoT - essentially AE tash with a dot <br/>
component, which are great for the group as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
The chanter hopefully has some reagents for Rune IV or V, preferrably <br/>
Bedlam, which is a rune with no reagent at all. He&#39;ll rune you (and <br/>
him/herself), you&#39;ll go down a long hall, or into an open area, go aggro any <br/>
surrounding mobs. I like to leave AE snare running so as it aggros the mobs, <br/>
they&#39;re snared and don&#39;t beat on you the entire time making it back to the <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
If youre pulling into a small room, beware the aggro rules that VI has <br/>
implemented. There will only be a max of 4 mobs aggro on you at once, so if <br/>
you pulled 10 mobs, the other 6 will be waiting outside the door. Once the <br/>
first nuke or stun goes off, pulling aggro from you, the other mobs that <br/>
were aggro on you outside, will come into the room eventually to their <br/>
demise.<br/>
<br/>
One chanter is sufficient, hopefully either you or he/she has the AE MR <br/>
debuff, (Denon&#39;s Bereavement) or (Winds of Tashini) something like that. If <br/>
there&#39;s a lot of resists he&#39;ll get the beat down, not the puller. Here is my <br/>
typical twist for AE: (with best lute) Assonant Strane, Bereavement, and <br/>
Chords of Discord. Yes a L2 song, maybe not the best dot effect, but it&#39;s AE <br/>
and it utilizes the Lute so you don&#39;t have to switch out in the lag of <br/>
battle/casting spam.<br/>
