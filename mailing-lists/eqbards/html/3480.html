&gt;	Someone mentioned that Hymn stacked with them and another bard.  This<br/>
&gt;happened to me last night with both Hymn and Jig.  We were both level 18,<br/>
&gt;this is probably why it happened.  I think that with different level bards,<br/>
&gt;the higher bard wins out on the song, but if you&#39;re both the same level, it<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t decide.  Wish I had checked the healing rates though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Right now, I&#39;m fighting alot in Permafrost, and last night, I decided it<br/>
&gt;was better for me to forgo my weapons to use a drum for Elemental and<br/>
&gt;Guardian Rhythyms, at least against the casters.  Are there any other combos<br/>
&gt;like this where it&#39;s best to forgo my weapon and damage to better the rest<br/>
&gt;of the fighters?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Also, I&#39;m just now starting my collection of Bronze armour.  Is steel that<br/>
&gt;much more difficult to obtain?( from monsters)  And is weight the only<br/>
&gt;difference?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dont think this is it, when the hymn was stacking i was 39 and keyana was<br/>
40. Now that i turned 40 and she is too it doesnt stack. Though that might<br/>
be completly unrelated, it was working the one night, and not the next. Im<br/>
at a loss to explain it though people have put forth 2 possible good<br/>
explanations, none has held up yet. Maybe i was just on crack. Starting to<br/>
doubt myself at this pt, but we where doing this multiple times for over 3<br/>
hours.</div>
