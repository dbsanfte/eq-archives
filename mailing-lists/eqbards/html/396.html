<div id="ygrps-yiv-659749492">I must also admit that North Ro is a better place to hunt when in Freeport.<br/>
It is no as over hunted as the Commonlands. Of course water is drained at a<br/>
faster rate but keeping to the grassy area can keep it to a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
	I found it a great place, the Grassy area, to get experience from 4th - 6th<br/>
level. At 6th+ level is the end of the experience gravy train and you only<br/>
can earn a few silver from then on. But I suggest only hunting the<br/>
Armadillo&#39;s for the experience; they carry little loot (I never found a<br/>
thing on &#39;em). But the greatest danger is of course when a person draws<br/>
something Nasty out of the desert and drops it in your lap. Too many times I<br/>
find my self, Back turned, and in pain as a madman is crushing my skull.<br/>
Unlike a griffin, they make no noise as they approach.<br/>
<br/>
	I have been the punching bag for Dervish&#39;s, Madmen, and a Dark-Elf with an<br/>
attitude. All while my back was turned to the desert so I did not see them<br/>
approach. Only catching the sting of their blade did I become aware of their<br/>
presence. But don&#39;t let this risk detract you, I find it easier to come<br/>
across a target better than the Commonlands only for it lack of attention my<br/>
the general populous. It is like a secret fishing hole that not too many<br/>
know about...<br/>

&gt; 	As far as groups go at that level, I&#39;d try North Ro. Most<br/>
&gt; of the creatures<br/>
&gt; there are solitary and a good fetcher will bring it back to the<br/>
&gt; grassy area.<br/>
&gt; This allows you to Wince away without fear of pulling anything big in. It<br/>
&gt; also means you&#39;ll drain less water. Lastly, the guard is near in<br/>
&gt; case things<br/>
&gt; go way bad unless you&#39;re taking on madmen, dervish, or pumas. I&#39;ve also<br/>
&gt; found the people in North Ro to be a bit more serious about grouping than<br/>
&gt; anywhere else since the distribution of creatures almost requires<br/>
&gt; a group to<br/>
&gt; get anywhere.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	And the biggest thing about North Ro... No griffins!<br/>
