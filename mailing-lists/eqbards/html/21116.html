<br/>
Solo classes, in order of power:<br/>
1)  Necro (yes, they beat even us)<br/>
2)  Druid or Bard  (I&#39;d say bard then druid but it&#39;s hard to really say)<br/>
3)  Magician<br/>
4)  Dunno, does it matter beyond this? :)<br/>
<br/>
Then again, my ranger is pretty easy to solo with given the right situation<br/>
;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s the best kiting class in the game?  Druids?  Early on<br/>
&gt; maybe.  Necros?<br/>
&gt; Only if ye like to med.  The answer, dear folks, is Bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     So I got bored while waiting on some friends to come over,<br/>
&gt; right?  So I<br/>
&gt; fired up EQ (I had camped out in my usualy dog-hunting spot next to the FV<br/>
&gt; giant camp), and decided to try a different twist to my kiting.<br/>
&gt; Instead of<br/>
&gt; using Chains/Chant/Chant, why not use Selo&#39;s/Chant/Chant?  (The<br/>
&gt; Chants being<br/>
&gt; Fufil&#39;s and Tuyen&#39;s DoTs)  Before long, I had amassed a most impressive<br/>
&gt; tally of 10 growlers, 1 snarler, and one froglock ton night who came outta<br/>
&gt; nowhere, and had not lost even a bubble of hps!<br/>
&gt;      Emboldened by this turn of events, later in the evening (my<br/>
&gt; friends had<br/>
&gt; come by, and I had spent the afternoon chasing women with them) I<br/>
&gt; was heard<br/>
&gt; to wonder on guild chat &quot;hmmm...  I wonder if I can kite all 3 giants at<br/>
&gt; once?&quot;<br/>
&gt;     Pulling only 2 (somehow), I began my craft.  What I found most amusing<br/>
&gt; is that folks passing by would stop to watch in amazement.  There I was, a<br/>
&gt; lone blue-clad, green-boot-wearin&#39; bard running in big circles<br/>
&gt; with 2 giants<br/>
&gt; and an ever-increasing horde of drolvargs (mostly growlers) not<br/>
&gt; far behind.<br/>
&gt; Every now and then, one of the critters would fall over dead.<br/>
&gt; Thinking back<br/>
&gt; on it, I have to wonder how many times I was /petitioned for exploiting<br/>
&gt; something   heh!<br/>
&gt;      Mebbe one of these days I&#39;ll get the hang of Charm-kiting, but until<br/>
&gt; then... let the Druids and Necros stand in awe of the Kite-ability of the<br/>
&gt; Bardic class ;o)<br/>
&gt; (I even got the druid to say &quot;Bards ROCK!!&quot; on guildchat after he saw me<br/>
&gt; wittle down the long line of beasties)<br/>
