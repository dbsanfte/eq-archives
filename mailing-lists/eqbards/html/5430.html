<div id="ygrps-yiv-395989075">Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>
Speaking of Ghoulsbanes swords, my paladin husband has always maintained <br/>
that the sword casts it&#39;s spell more often based on the wielder&#39;s dex. After <br/>
camping and finally getting these for 2 of the guild paladins (*sigh*, one <br/>
more to go), we went to lower guk for a break. It occurred to me to switch <br/>
from Anthem to Chant for the dex boost to see if that would get more casts <br/>
on the undead frogs. One paladin was pretty sure it did help. Since then, <br/>
they have debated whether to get dex boost items. The other paladin got some <br/>
dex boosts later on and now thinks it makes no difference. The point of this <br/>
ramble: when fighting undead with paladins using Ghoulsbanes, try Chant and <br/>
see if they think it helps the sword&#39;s casts.<br/>
I finally hit hell 1, L30 after many misadventures. Ever wonder what is in <br/>
the caves under the aviak guard island in Lake Rathe? I can confirm that <br/>
cave connects to the cave under the island straight out from the docks at <br/>
the Rathe Mountain zone pass. I can also tell you that L40ish spellcasting <br/>
deepwater goblins live in the tower in the cave underwater. Great place to <br/>
die. Fortunately, we did this exploration prior to me leveling. Not much <br/>
chance of a rez there, lol.<br/>
