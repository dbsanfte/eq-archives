&gt; Perhaps the new patch will help me, but I have a very difficult time with<br/>
&gt; Charm.  I&#39;ve played with it in East Commonlands against the orcs there and<br/>
&gt; just can&#39;t seem to get the hang of knowing when to recharm the mob.<br/>
&gt; Switching between targetting my charmed mob and the one I&#39;m fighting is<br/>
&gt; extremely difficult since I can&#39;t seem to get F1 to work as advertised for<br/>
&gt; switching pet/mob.  I have to either click on the mob or adjust my position<br/>
&gt; and use &quot;target closest NPC&quot; to switch - both of which are tricky at best.<br/>

another song (usually Accel or Hymn for me).  Shortly after<br/>
that song pulses twice, start up charm again.<br/>

You shouldn&#39;t be fighting the second mob unless your group is<br/>
fighting it, or the fight is tremendously uneven (in which<br/>
case you probably should&#39;ve charmed the other mob).  Remember,<br/>
you&#39;re eventually going to have to kill your pet.  It is not<br/>
in your best interest to help it unless someone else&#39;s life<br/>
depends on killing the other mob fast.  I usually charm, then<br/>
concentrate on staying out of attack range and healing up any<br/>
damage I&#39;ve taken.  Charm has a pretty big range, so outdoors<br/>
you should never even take damage while doing this.  Keeping<br/>
your distance also gives you more time between when the mob<br/>
becomes uncharmed and when it&#39;s beating you up.  And remember,<br/>
you&#39;re not a caster.  You don&#39;t have to stand still to<br/>
charm.  You can do it while running away.<br/>
