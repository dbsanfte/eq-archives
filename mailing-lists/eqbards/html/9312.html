another song (usually Accel or Hymn for me).  Shortly after<br/>
that song pulses twice, start up charm again.<br/>

You shouldn&#39;t be fighting the second mob unless your group is<br/>
fighting it, or the fight is tremendously uneven (in which<br/>
case you probably should&#39;ve charmed the other mob).  Remember,<br/>
you&#39;re eventually going to have to kill your pet.  It is not<br/>
in your best interest to help it unless someone else&#39;s life<br/>
depends on killing the other mob fast.  I usually charm, then<br/>
concentrate on staying out of attack range and healing up any<br/>
damage I&#39;ve taken.  Charm has a pretty big range, so outdoors<br/>
you should never even take damage while doing this.  Keeping<br/>
your distance also gives you more time between when the mob<br/>
becomes uncharmed and when it&#39;s beating you up.  And remember,<br/>
you&#39;re not a caster.  You don&#39;t have to stand still to<br/>
charm.  You can do it while running away.<br/>
