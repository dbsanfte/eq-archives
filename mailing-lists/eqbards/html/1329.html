<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-533456701">Hail and well met all!<br/>
	<br/>
	I hope to find this forum as interesting and informative as I have<br/>
heard tell it to be in my travels.<br/>
<br/>
	I am Kitasi, the mournful bard of Faydwyr on E&#39;ci.  Why mournful you<br/>
may ask?  Because I have dedicated much of my time to a seemingly fruitless<br/>
pursuit of the arch-fiend Crookstinger, a demon in wasp form, for what other<br/>
natural creature would take a name unto itself and launch itself at others<br/>
willy-nilly!<br/>
<br/>
	I am dedicated to the pursuit of all things Crooky and make it a<br/>
point to always spend several days hunting the vile creature whenever I am<br/>
on Faydwyr, the land of my birth.  I would greatly appreciate any and all<br/>
information the assembled group of loremasters might be able to provide me<br/>
on this clever foe.<br/>
<br/>
	Until then, May Errolissi hold you in her arms always!<br/>
<br/>
                  Kitasi<br/>
     The mournful bard of Faydwer on E&#39;ci<br/>
      &quot;and no one shall work for money, <br/>
       and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>
     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>
        and each to his seperate star...&quot;</div>
