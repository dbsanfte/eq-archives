<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217286989">Actually - think about this, this logic is backwards.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, rubicite, et. al are NOT limited resources - that&#39;s the main<br/>
problem with dropping prices.<br/>
<br/>
Item X spawns every x minutes /number of players on server. Eventually -<br/>
EVERYONE could have it theoretically - and the price bottoms out as things<br/>
become more common.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a fan of high level characters swooping in and stealing kills -<br/>
which seems to be what you are describing, but is there really any<br/>
difference between that and his lower level coming in, plopping down with<br/>
you for a few hours?<br/>
<br/>
What I see far more often happen is that a player will give his lower level<br/>
characters, or friends, his hand-me-down items once he has better - which<br/>
is a GOOD thing in terms of NOT having to camp for it.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, too many people simply have not learned the difference between<br/>
single-player, and multi-player games. That is at the heart of a lot of<br/>
problems online worlds have. Perhaps society is just tuned into ME ME ME,<br/>
but I&#39;ve met folks that had utter and total disregard for PEOPLE around<br/>
them, treating them all no better than your average NPC. It&#39;s a big sandbox<br/>
folks, we can all play nice.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;You&#39;re applying single-player game mentalities to a<br/>
&gt;multi-player game.  Spawns that give things like rubicite are<br/>
&gt;a limited resource.  If someone uses his high level character<br/>
&gt;to get equipment like that for his low level characters, he is<br/>
&gt;depriving others of the chance to get that item, thus<br/>
&gt;increasing the camping problem on that spawn.  It is not<br/>
&gt;jealousy, it is a legitimate gripe that someone has figured<br/>
&gt;out a way to cut in line and get two or more of something,<br/>
&gt;when you&#39;re still waiting in line to get one. </span></blockquote></div>
