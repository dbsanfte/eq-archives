<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140763821">Well I saw you mention Kaesora in a previous post Sylly and I thought I<br/>
would give the list my experiences from there.  My guild and I have pretty<br/>
much lived there for the last 3 weeks or so.  We have went to every part of<br/>
this dungeon and killed every mob there.  If you are in the high 30&#39;s to low<br/>
40&#39;s, it is an outstanding place to hunt.  For a while we were the only<br/>
groups there.  There have been a few more people showing up lately, but it<br/>
is still under utilized in my opinion.  There are several named mobs in here<br/>
which drop some good loot for the level range.  Nearly everyone in the<br/>
guild, 21 people, have gotten a dusty ransacker&#39;s pack.  A couple of the<br/>
books, a nice 2h slashing weapon, warrior only piercer, and several of the<br/>
bard only piercers.  So the loot is very well flowing.  If you plan on going<br/>
to the church, bring two groups, if you are in the 40&#39;s, and DO NOT use<br/>
pets.  We were there last week, very well balanced groups that included two<br/>
necros and a shaman using pets.  Well everything went well, after I died 3<br/>
times (another long story that I shan&#39;t go into now :)) and we made our way<br/>
down to the church.  We started pulling 2&#39;s and 3&#39;s, no problem with the<br/>
best enchanter on Veeshan IMHO, and we were going through them like candy.<br/>
<br/>
Now the fun starts.  Out of nowhere we had 7 spiders on us.  Mind you there<br/>
are no spiders down near the church.  We kill them and finish clearing the<br/>
church.  We go in and set up camp in the basement.  We have a few pops, kill<br/>
them, have a few more, kill them, get some roamers, etc.  Then it happened.<br/>
A pet disappears.  A spider comes, and another, and another and so forth and<br/>
so on.  When we finally rest, we have killed over 35 mobs in a row.  They<br/>
just kept flooding the place.  Very very scary being that far in a dungeon<br/>
with that many mobs.  We decide to head out and we go up into the church and<br/>
the entire, I think, dungeon runs up on top of us including the named mob<br/>
Xalgoz or something like that.  Well I am the first one to die, and then<br/>
seven more guildmates die, one person went LD, and 6 more evac out.<br/>
Needless to say it wasn&#39;t pretty on the corpse recovery.  Fun was had by all<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
We went back the next day with no pets, and we had no freaky aggro.  The<br/>
only things that aggroed us were intentional.<br/>
<br/>
So in conclusion, if you are in the range of levels I stated above, grab<br/>
your guild/group/friends and head down there.  Pick up a map though, because<br/>
you can&#39;t get out of the dungeon the way you come in.  You go in and out of<br/>
the same zone line, but you can&#39;t go up where you drop down from.  Very<br/>
cryptic, but it makes it that much more dangerous.<br/>
