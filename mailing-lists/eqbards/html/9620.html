tracking is really scary at night when all you can track at the zone is<br/>
undead stuff. im happy bard quests arent in kith like the rangers are.<br/>
<br/>
ya those enraged dread wolves are nasty, red to me at 36.<br/>

Minkin makes a rude gesture to all you rangers out there.<br/>
Minkin rolls on the floor laughing his ass off at the rangers.<br/>
Minkin gets succered into finding the ranger guildmaster to get a ranger<br/>
breastplate for a friend (doh i knew i shouldnt of looted that stuff &quot;just<br/>
in case&quot;!)<br/>

&gt; &gt;Some things, especially the dread wolves and enraged dread wolves, do NOT<br/>
&gt; &gt;always despawn at the morning. This means that often there will be<br/>
&gt; several<br/>
&gt; &gt;things left in the zone that are still very aggressive and dangerous.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think they have this fixed as of the last patch.  I was in Kith last<br/>
&gt; nite<br/>
&gt; (Real time) and was targeting an Enraged Dread Wolf to /con it for just<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; reason.  While I had it targeted it despawned.  This was at 6AM KFT<br/>
&gt; (Kithicor Forest Time).  I ran all over the zone to see if there was<br/>
&gt; anything dangerous running around.  I did get jumped by a ghoul and nearly<br/>
&gt; had heart failure when it rooted me.  Fortunately it was one of the<br/>
&gt; ordinary<br/>
&gt; ghouls that have always spawned near burned out houses in Kithicor.  I did<br/>
&gt; not run into anything during the day that wasn&#39;t around before this<br/>
&gt; change.<br/>
&gt; Of course I don&#39;t have track yet so that info isn&#39;t 100% for sure but I<br/>
&gt; did<br/>
&gt; stay in Kithicor ranging about until 6pm KFT so I covered a lot of ground.<br/>
