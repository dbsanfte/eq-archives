<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625108576">Yep, in Lavastorm go left once you zone in from the Smurfy Forest and <br/>
you&#39;ll eventually get to it.<br/>
Other Gypsy camps that I I know of are:<br/>
North Karana - Follow the road north from the Stone bridge in the western <br/>
part of the zone (the one that zones to South Karana) and you&#39;ll get to it.<br/>
Oasis - Erm... sort of in the middle.<br/>
Rathe Mountains - Go east from the Lake Rathe zone entrance, it&#39;s not far.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to thank the troller(s) who have (so far) stopped posting crap <br/>
that just wasn&#39;t relevant to this list in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Now for my rant that no one ever bothers to read cuz it gets so damn long:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the fact that the Gypsies are indifferent to me, I reckon they <br/>
should enjoy the company of Bards. I&#39;m not likening them to any of the real <br/>
life gypsy people, I&#39;m viewing them in a more fantasy RPG frame of mind and <br/>
that suggests to me that they should be freewheeling, cavorting, <br/>
happy-go-lucky types (much like Bards are), and they can indeed remain <br/>
extremely powerful, vicious, psychotic bastards (much like Bards are). That <br/>
won&#39;t interfere with my perception of them in Verant&#39;s setting. But man, <br/>
it&#39;s just frustrating that none of them *talk*. I dislike all these silent <br/>
NPC&#39;s, some places are kinda spooky from the absence of talking NPC&#39;s... <br/>
just ghostly images moving around at random, never uttering a sound... <br/>
staring at me with those expressionless eyes framed in a perpetually angry <br/>
face, mouths slightly open like guppies... giving them the impression  of <br/>
mindless thugs.<br/>
<br/>
And wouldn&#39;t it be cool if the Gypsies moved around sometimes? One day <br/>
you&#39;re wondering where the hell your unfriendly neighborhood Combine <br/>
supplier is, next day you see them settling down at the other end of a <br/>
zone. Funky indeed.<br/>
<br/>
But as far as Bards are concerned I feel they should warm to us for being <br/>
so similar to them in nature. Plus they could drop juicy quests on us and <br/>
ONLY us. That&#39;d really make us hated by other players ;) But it&#39;d at least <br/>
make up for the lack of Bard -specific quests. I don&#39;t feel right saying <br/>
&quot;Yes I am a follower of Tunare/Rodcet Nife/Bluntman&quot; to whichever NPC I&#39;ve <br/>
carillioned this time in order to get some FedEx quest... it&#39;s fun <br/>
sometimes, but I&#39;d so much prefer a Bard-specific one. Which Bard quests <br/>
exist now anyways? As far as I know we have:<br/>
<br/>
Wood Elf spider silk chick<br/>
Qeynos Guard Reports<br/>
Qeynos sing Thornless Rose to girl IN FRONT OF HER FATHER (!) even after <br/>
being told not to and suffering NO repercussion for doing so (thankfully) - <br/>
is this Bard-only btw?<br/>
Qeynos/S Kar fix Lute (over-and-over even when it&#39;s supposedly in the other <br/>
dude&#39;s hands for a week)<br/>
N/S Kar Flute lady (is this Bard-Only? I cheated on this btw, didn&#39;t manage <br/>
to get her to give me the keywords but the quest still &#39;worked&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
Zassit? Found nothing in Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Killing an NPC in Mistmoore to get her lute might be viable, but a) <br/>
everyone can do it and b) killing something to get loot (ooh, pun) isn&#39;t <br/>
really a quest as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br/>
<br/>
So are there any that I&#39;m missing or is this it? Rather disappointing, I <br/>
know it&#39;s been said time and time again on different bulletin boards and <br/>
mailing lists, but I&#39;m feeling a little &#39;bleah&#39; about playing EQ and have <br/>
been doing other things with my time. It&#39;s such hard work not dying <br/>
repeatedly... I must suck at EQ ;)<br/>
<br/>
S&#39;right,<br/>

Also, I think there is a gypsy camp in Lavastorm - with combine blunts<br/>
there?  Something I heard - have not yet actually seen it.<br/>

		Don&#39;t know about Faydwer, but you can also get them from the<br/>
gypsy camp in<br/>
		North Karana (Follow the straight out from the East Karana<br/>
bridge), and have<br/>
		heard there is a gypsy camp in Rathe Mountains (never been<br/>
to it) that you<br/>
		can get them from also.<br/>
