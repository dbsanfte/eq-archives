<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556193744">this idea was potsed to the message board that fostered the birth of the<br/>
bardic petition.<br/>
why not allow bards to bind, but restrict it to themselves in taverns or<br/>
inns.  Also possibly using a bottle of ale or wine as a reagent.<br/>

&gt; I think the best solution to this is to allow all hybrids and warriors to<br/>
&gt; be bound to any place by a caster.  It still maintains the necessity for<br/>
&gt; non-casters to be bound by casters and allows for some flexibility for the<br/>
&gt; non-casters.  I personally hate dying defending a caster only to run<br/>
&gt; through 5 or 6 zones to retrieve my corpse.  We really don&#39;t need bind.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I also don&#39;t think we should get bind any more than rangers, paladins<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or sk&#39;s.  I actually saw a post stating that monks should have bind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at high levels, some idea that a high level monk was so in touch with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; his chi that he could bind it to a spot :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bind should stay the purview of the pure casters, as should gate.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Given that we can innately move so much faster than any of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other hybrids, I think we have even less reason to ask for<br/>
&gt; &gt; bind than the other hybrids.<br/>
