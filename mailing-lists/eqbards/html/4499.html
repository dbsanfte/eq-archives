<div id="ygrps-yiv-74664904"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; I cant get this song to do squat. On mobs it will pulse with the animation<br/>
&gt; that looks like selo&#39;s accelerando on us, and this will irritate the<br/>
&gt; creature causing them to attack me but thats all i can tell. I tried<br/>
&gt; dualing a friend and it wouldnt even pulse on them, though it was<br/>
&gt; irritating the snakes and bats around me. For that matter, i couldnt even<br/>
&gt; get the dissonance to hurt them. Bellows hurt them, and i could wack all<br/>
&gt; day on them with my weapons, but no aoe song hit them. Didnt try fear now<br/>
&gt; that i think of it... this happened before todays patch but after the last<br/>
&gt; patch. Anybody know what was going on here? I am going to try this again<br/>
&gt; today after this patch and see what happens...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A few levels ago I decided to see how much damage my AoE songs would do so I<br/>
dueled a buddy of mine. Nothing, nada zip. I just decided I&#39;d never know and<br/>
gave it up.  2 weeks later, I&#39;m sitting at work doing work stuff and it<br/>
dawned on me. I went back and dueled again, this time making sure the person<br/>
I dueled was NOT in my group.  I now have a pretty decent idea how much<br/>
damage all my songs do. :-)<br/>
