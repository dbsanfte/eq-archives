&gt;Ok,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This struck me the other night.  How about a new high level quest item.  A<br/>
&gt;magical instrument that could be used for percussion and string.  No extra<br/>
&gt;effect, just dont have to switch instruments.  A Banjo!!  It is equaly<br/>
&gt;percussive and stringed.  I don&#39;t think it would be too hokey.  And if you<br/>
&gt;came up with an instrument like a Concertina (little sailors accordian<br/>
&gt;thingy) this could do the same for flute and brass. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do think that an insturment that can do both String and Brass would be<br/>
&gt;unbalancing and unfair.  (it would be great for damage songs).<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although the same thought has crossed my mind many times, I think having us<br/>
limited like this is part of Verant&#39;s balance plan.<br/>
I would like to see some more bard-oriented quests for mid-high levels.<br/>
Like the vengeful corpse quest in Halas - but more specifically bardic.<br/>
