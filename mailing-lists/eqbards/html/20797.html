<div id="ygrps-yiv-716585273"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have recently upgraded my video card to a GeForce2 GTS from a Voodoo3<br/>
3000.  The Voodoo3 was fine except some spell effects would lag me down,<br/>
most notably the AOE rain type spells.  So I upgraded.  The visual quality<br/>
on the GeForce2 isn&#39;t quite as good; the ground ahead gets kind of grainy<br/>
and/or swimmy and in general things in the distance don&#39;t look as good, but<br/>
I don&#39;t get graphical lag at all any more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can fix the swimmy textures up in a second by switching on Full Screen<br/>
Anti-Aliasing.  You don&#39;t have to turn it up very high; halfway or one notch<br/>
less should be more than enough to clear up jaggies and freaky ground<br/>
textures.  It did on mine while I had the Prophet 2 64MB and a PIII 500.</div>
