<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799343922">i think with so many of these research items dropping regularly on the<br/>
planes, it is much easier for casters to get their level 49 spells.  i<br/>
remember it taking months for the first 50 necro on my server to get his<br/>
level 49 pet.  but runes and words are abundant in the planes now and get<br/>
passed on to friends, guildmembers, sold, etc.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Yes, FS daggers are easy to get.  But getting the items so you<br/>
&gt; can research the pet spell so that you even have a pet to give<br/>
&gt; the daggers to is roughly as difficult as getting a haste<br/>
&gt; item.  AFAIK, except for the enchanter pets, none of the pet<br/>
&gt; spells past about level 25 can be bought.<br/>
