&gt; I have noticed that either one of two things will happen when a mob resists<br/>
&gt; the Lament song.  Sometimes when you get the resist message the mob doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; aggro and remains where he is at.  You can then reattempt to Lament them.<br/>
&gt; Other times, the mob will aggro as soon as you get the resist message.  It<br/>
&gt; appears that a second resist check is made if the mobs resists the initial<br/>
&gt; Lament attempt.  If the mob fails the second resist check, he doesn&#39;t aggro.<br/>
&gt; If he makes the second resist check, he aggros on you.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone else noticed this as well?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s the way it works.  As of last week I seem to be<br/>
getting more double-resists (mob I tried to lament comes and<br/>
attacks me) than usual.  I had a total of 3 double-resists in<br/>
the 2 months or so since I started using this song again.  <br/>
Then a couple nights in Mistmoore, it failed me 3 times.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone remember back when the song was way overpowered and<br/>
couldn&#39;t be resisted?  Ah those were the days...  :)<br/>
