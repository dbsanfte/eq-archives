<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125286143">have guardian and elemental rhythms memmed, and if fighting tough casters<br/>
(e.g. festering hags) you can weave those two with a drum and boost your<br/>
parties magic resist bigtime.  also you can&#39;t go wrong with charm as long as<br/>
your party knows what you are charming, and have charm down pretty well (i<br/>
never really used it and was never that good hehe).  plus your normal<br/>
anthem, bellow, heal in melee fights.  plus lullaby for trains (trademark in<br/>
unrest).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello all- believe it or not, at level 28 I have yet to <br/>
&gt; travel to quite a<br/>
&gt; few dungeons. Since I am currently in Kaladim, I thought I <br/>
&gt; would give Unrest<br/>
&gt; a try.<br/>
&gt; My questions are this: what songs should i be using <br/>
&gt; primarily-both as a<br/>
&gt; battle bard and as a buff party bard?<br/>
&gt; My current machime though is only a p233 and weaving more <br/>
&gt; than 2 songs,<br/>
&gt; maybe 3 on a good connection day, is about my max-2 being the <br/>
&gt; norm for me.<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions and tips would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
