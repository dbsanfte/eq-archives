&gt;I think it&#39;s a compliment to the subscribers of this lists that there are<br/>
&gt;relatively few Bards.  WE all know how absolutely wonderful it is being a<br/>
&gt;bard.  But this class is so different from any of the other &quot;melee&quot; and<br/>
&gt;&quot;casting&quot; classes that I honestly believe that it takes a special <br/>
&gt;individual<br/>
&gt;to play one and play it well (maybe I&#39;m just patting myself on the back, <br/>
&gt;but I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t think so).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also play a Level 38 druid (no, I don&#39;t kite, or I probably WOULD be level <br/>
50 by now).  I have played her since day one of commercial.  In all that <br/>
time, I have grouped with exactly THREE bards.  Not because I don&#39;t like <br/>
grouping with bards, but simply because there are so few of them available.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I had the opportunity and the unexpected pleasure of grouping <br/>
with a level 30 bard in Cazic. *waves to Celandro*  We were doing crocs and <br/>
praying to the EQ gods for the steel golem to spawn and drop some gloves for <br/>
our cleric friend.<br/>
<br/>
Because I play a bard, I am always more than happy to group with one if <br/>
possible.  I know the strengths of a bard, I know how great they are to have <br/>
in a party, but I can tell you, there is nothing like experiencing what a <br/>
bard can do from a different perspective.  If I could have charmed Celandro <br/>
and made him my permanent pet, I would have done it! Hehe.  I learned ALOT <br/>
from Celandro, pestering him with questions (poor Cel!), watching him weave <br/>
his songs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There is NOTHING like being grouped with a GOOD bard, who knows his stuff.<br/>
