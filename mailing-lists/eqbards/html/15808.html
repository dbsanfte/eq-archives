&gt; level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And perhaps we have it BETTER... At 36 with Celerity - I use our Level 1<br/>
&gt; Song - Chant of Battle - it gives AC +4, STR and Dex +14.  How many casters<br/>
&gt; use spells granted at level 1 when they&#39;re level 36?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I debunked this in the bard petition thread on the official<br/>
boards.  At level 40, a shaman can outbuff Celerity + Chant,<br/>
using mostly L16-24 buffs.  Doing so takes less than half his<br/>
mana regeneration rate - he has the rest to nuke, heal, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The primary advantage I see bards having is the combination of<br/>
abilities they can provide - healing, clarity, stat buffs,<br/>
crowd control, speed buffs/debuffs.  No other class covers<br/>
such a wide variety.  But in terms of quantity (number of<br/>
buffs at once) or quality (power of the buffs, resists<br/>
excepted) a bard comes nowhere near the other classes.<br/>
