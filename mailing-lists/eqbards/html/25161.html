&gt;I don&#39;t really understand the mentality.  I know I&#39;m not alone in feeling<br/>
&gt;the early levels could be among the most fun - and learning the class was a<br/>

I didn&#39;t sub to that, and I won&#39;t sub to it here.  I think it&#39;s a <br/>
disgusting practice, to separate people based on economics.<br/>
