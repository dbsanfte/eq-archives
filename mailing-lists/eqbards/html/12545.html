&gt; &gt; That would seem to indicate you could not stand in front of any<br/>
&gt; aggressive<br/>

&gt; you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since this does not happen, I have one theory why not which explains<br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The mob didn&#39;t attack us because it was busy fighting the<br/>

maybe the mob was seeing through mine (mine overwrote yours), then<br/>
indifferent (when yours overwrote mine)<br/>
<br/>
	Otherwise it&#39;s just the fact that ANY song was being played,<br/>
affecting the party (since your invis was on first)<br/>
<br/>
	Just some thoughts...<br/>
