&gt; Has anyone else been sent this thread or looked at it?<br/>

&gt; I read the thread and was appalled to see that bards, supposedly the best<br/>
&gt; group class according to &quot;The Vision&quot; were seldom listed as being desirable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Weird, I just read the thread and it seemed to me bards were mentioned<br/>
by about 1/4-1/3 the posters. As I usually find the number of ppl in<br/>
game with a clue to be more around 10% I thought that was rather<br/>
encouraging.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &quot;A *good* Bard, i.e. one that puts away the stupid weapons and uses their<br/>
&gt; DoTs with instruments, managing mob agro properly, can add the the group.<br/>
&gt; But most Bards are clueless schmucks, so it isn&#39;t worth trying to educate<br/>
&gt; them as they flail away with their Yaks and no Double Attack.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would this bother you so much? It&#39;s true from what I can see. In any<br/>
situation where you can get all 3 chants sticking consistantly the<br/>
damage _is_ higher than you&#39;re going to manage with weapons. Bards are<br/>
screwed in melee in 2 ways. First, they don&#39;t get double attack, and<br/>
second, and most damaging, they don&#39;t get the minumum hit bonus that<br/>
pure melee chars now get. L50 meleers don&#39;t hit for 1 ever. This was<br/>
with my old L49 bard who&#39;s weapons maybe aren&#39;t the best, but I have the<br/>
opportunity to try this out with a bard in our guild with evensong and<br/>
one of the other hate weapons. I plan to try this out and I expect it<br/>
will still be the same.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been emailed this thread by 6 people now!  A couple of them even<br/>
&gt; suggested it made sense and that since an enchanter was so much more vital<br/>
&gt; to a good group and basically rendered the bard obsolete, I should retire my<br/>
&gt; bard and work on getting one of my more viable classes leveled up.  It was<br/>
&gt; suggested, though never directly stated, that an enchanter made having a<br/>
&gt; bard more or less a waste of time unless you really needed manasong.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm. Who saves the enchanter when they hit a bad string of rolls. I know<br/>
when I grouped with an enchanter last week, it was me charming the<br/>
frenzied drolvarg off her that saved her life. No tank was going to<br/>
taunt it off that fast.<br/>
<br/>
We had a group last week that was 2 bards, an enchanter, monk, wizard<br/>
and cleric. We held a tower deeper in Karnors pulling the hand room for<br/>
several hours and everyone in the group was quite impressed with how<br/>
efficiently we were dealing with stuff. There was almost no downtime,<br/>
mobs died fast and everyone got lots of exp. Of course it helped that<br/>
the other bard and I were on speaker phones with each other and could<br/>
coordinate what we did really easily, but even that could have been done<br/>
without.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my friend the other bard above, after I showed him the<br/>
effectiveness of the chant songs, went back the next day, bought some<br/>
sow potions and proceeded to go to burning woods and kill wurms. Said he<br/>
got a bubble of L52 in a couple of hours doing it, and that with one<br/>
death.<br/>
