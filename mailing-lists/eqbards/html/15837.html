 </span></blockquote>Right, the difficulty would be in proving those are &quot;your&quot; possessions. You<br/>
aren&#39;t paying to &quot;own&quot; them in any way the law currently accepts, you are<br/>
renting their use while using Verants service. In the work scenario, if you<br/>
were fired as Copier Guy you couldn&#39;t take the copier, the company was<br/>
paying for that copier to be there, and no matter how much money you made<br/>
for them as Copier Guy, you can&#39;t take it with you.<br/>
I think that is actually a really strong case against EBay sales imparting a<br/>
Real World value to EQ items. What you are actually buying is the ability<br/>
access the itemID in EQs database during the time you are paying for<br/>
Verant&#39;s service. For instance if you quit the game Verant is under no<br/>
obligation to pay you fair market value for your items, in large part<br/>
because they are not items, they are graphics with an ID, which Verant owns<br/>
and which they allowed you to use for 10 bucks a month. If you paid for<br/>
greater access that is between you and the seller, but the only identifiable<br/>
&quot;thing of value&quot; is the service Verant provides.<br/>
The final nail in the coffin is that whether or not having access to a full<br/>
set of Lambent improves or lessens the quality of the service Verant<br/>
provides is totally subjective (though, um, duh :o) you may *think* it makes<br/>
the service better but as the case can be made that full access to all items<br/>
actually has LESS value, you would have a hard time proving it, um, to a<br/>
non-bard.<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, just thinking out loud, er, when I should be working,<br/>
