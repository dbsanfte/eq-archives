<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759204061">Another way to power level at lower levels is quests. <br/>
I started a Gnome Enchanter and immediately went to<br/>
get a letter for Kelethin from the local bard, ran to<br/>
GFay and stopped for another letter at Felwithe, ran<br/>
to the bard guild in kelethin and delivered them.  Two<br/>
runs and I was lvl 2.  Rinse Repeat.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend that started a druid and using his<br/>
level 24 ranger and a friend to make the transfers got<br/>
that druid to level 9 in one night doing the cb belt<br/>
and leg shoulder quests.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; keys to good fast leveling are: <br/>
&gt; 1.	Don&#39;t die<br/>
&gt; 2.	Don&#39;t die<br/>
&gt; 3.	Location (i.e. plenty of spawns, low death risk)<br/>
&gt; 4.	The other thing that REALLY helps is to have<br/>
&gt; higher level friends<br/>
&gt; who can tele your butt around when necessary.<br/>
&gt; 5.	Don&#39;t die<br/>
&gt; 6.	Don&#39;t have fun.  There is no time for rp or<br/>
&gt; exploring :-)<br/>
