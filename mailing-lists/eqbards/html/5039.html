something or just waiting to meet someone.<br/>
That&#39;s fine and well. Wait outside. The bank<br/>
is only so big, and it&#39;s nice to be able to<br/>
get in and use it. I don&#39;t so much mind<br/>
walking over 50 bodies sitting or standing<br/>
around outside the bank if I can actually get<br/>
through the door and then to the teller to use<br/>
it.</div>
