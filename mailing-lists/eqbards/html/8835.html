&gt; &gt;It *is* broken.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is broken.  Period.  Whoever disputes this is talking trash.<br/>
&gt;John seems to use a wide variety of his songs and mixes them<br/>
&gt;a lot as far as I can tell, I trust his judgement over that<br/>
&gt;of someone&#39;s assumptions or &lt;shiver&gt; some damn enchanter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Effects, message, monster still wails on me.  And I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;talking clops or giants.  I&#39;m talking level 20 goblins.<br/>

&gt;One of the last few patches screwed this song up bad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Someone from Verant must read this or other Bard boards.  They most likely <br/>
saw an account of someone mez 2 or 3 mobs at a time. The following is a <br/>
fully fictional account of what happened at the next &#39;Balance Committee&#39; <br/>
meeting:<br/>
<br/>
DEV_01: &quot;Hey! those Bards have figured out how to use another one of their <br/>
songs, time to nerf it!&quot;<br/>
DEV_02: &quot;How should we nerf it?&quot;<br/>
DEV_01: &quot;I know, lets do it like we did Lucid Lullaby.  It will say it <br/>
worked, but it will not!&quot;<br/>
DEV_02: &quot;Great idea, I will have GZ get right on it.&quot;<br/>
