<div id="ygrps-yiv-405658271">I&#39;ve been getting those messages also.  The list moderator has the ability<br/>
to remove anyone from the list if he wants to.  Maybe the moderator should<br/>
give jowyang a couple more days before he deletes him.  A friend of mine had<br/>
a similar situation.  His hard drive crashed so he couldn&#39;t access his email<br/>
for a long time.  His email account Inbox kept building up to the point<br/>
where messages started to get bounced back to the sender.  This guy could be<br/>
in the same situation.<br/>

&gt; Can somebody go tell <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jowyang@...">jowyang@...</a><br/>
&gt; &lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jowyang@...">jowyang@...</a>&gt; to go empty his inbox.  I&#39;m sure that<br/>
&gt; everyone that posts to this list has been getting an annoying bouncemail<br/>
&gt; from him.<br/>
