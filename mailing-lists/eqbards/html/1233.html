<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428827988">I have noticed it too.  In Kithicor they have added a number of Named ORcs<br/>
from the Shralok clan(I think).  Some of those actually con even to levl<br/>
18 friends of mine.  The large Orc Camp in East Commons also has gotten a<br/>
named ORc Lord SHin Rae(if I remnember correctly)  He conned red to me and<br/>
I am level 17.  It surprised a group of people who were camping there.<br/>
They were unfortunately slaughtered.<br/>
