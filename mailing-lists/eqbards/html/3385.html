<div id="ygrps-yiv-61829629">Uhhh, that bandit camp has pretty decent loot if you are patient - and it&#39;s<br/>
not camped solid.<br/>
<br/>
Matter of fact, there are 2 bandit camps - the nybright sisters are up<br/>
towards the mistmoore entrance.<br/>
<br/>
With just a little patience, you&#39;ll find those bandits quite often drop<br/>
bronze weapons and amber, pearls, jade - even an occassional topaz.<br/>
<br/>
Lowest level critters I&#39;ve found that drop such things.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;But after buying all those things at the top of my post I am dead broke, and<br/>
&gt;looking for a good place to hunt. I tried looking in Lesser Faydark, and<br/>
&gt;after a half hour of running around all I saw was a small bandit camp, and a<br/>
&gt;Brownie camp (which I gave a very large detour around).  I am fighting in<br/>
&gt;the Oasis right now, but the Loot is pretty poor, and can be very dangerous<br/>
&gt;because of the Sand Giants running around.  Anyone have a good place for a<br/>
&gt;level 14 bard, that has reasonable loot and is not overcrowded??<br/>
