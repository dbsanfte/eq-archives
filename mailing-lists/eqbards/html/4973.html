<div id="ygrps-yiv-400715827">My understanding of how resist works is fire-based spells check against your fire<br/>
resist (like DryBoneFireBurst, Ignite), cold-based spells against cold (Frost<br/>
Spiral of Al&#39;kabor, Shock of Frost), and the rest fall under Magic (such as Force<br/>
Shock, GhoulRoot, Knockback, MortDrowsy, Sanity Warp, Charm,  Lightning, etc...).<br/>
I also think poison-based DOTs check against Poison resist, because I got two<br/>
silver-plated bracers which put my base poison resist at 30. I have never resisted<br/>
a poison-based DOT previously, and now if it is cast by a blue or green con I seem<br/>
to resist it every single time.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised someone asked what the value of Elemental and Guardian were. If<br/>
you ever go to Unrest and plan to fight hags, use them. For my party it makes the<br/>
difference between everyone finishing the battle having lost a half-bubble of<br/>
health, and losing 2-3 bubbles. It seems to be particularly important against the<br/>
hags DD spells, lightning and Shock of Force. Her primary AoE is the Frost Spiral<br/>
of Al&#39;kabor. How do I know? Because I usually get the resist message for force<br/>
shock, and occassionally get it for Frost Spiral. I also think the chance of<br/>
resisting is weighed against either your level or your defense skill, because<br/>
anyone who has been to Unrest at level 20 and tangled with a hag died in 2-3<br/>
spells, while a L30 takes quite a beating before dying.<br/>
