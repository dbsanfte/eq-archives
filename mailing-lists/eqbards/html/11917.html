&gt;   During the Lucan fight, I tossed everything I had at the guy<br/>
&gt;   and right before the party wiped him out, I zoned out.  Was<br/>
&gt;   a pretty fun night, and I still can visit the bard guild in<br/>
&gt;   Freeport &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m upset about this. First time I fought Lucan it was a close fight, we&#39;d<br/>
had to zone 2 times already and our two highest level players left so I was<br/>
2nd high man on the totem pole at 43. I couldn&#39;t leave and expect that the<br/>
rest of the group could survive the reincarnate. Ugh.  My group, got the<br/>
experience which was a shock, but even more shocking, I went from<br/>
indifferent to scowls even in wolf form!! ARGH!  The cleric in my group who<br/>
was dubious before the fight also got the faction hit for both kills and is<br/>
still dubious, WTF?!?<br/>
<br/>
I can still go to the bard&#39;s guild, I just have to announce a train and make<br/>
sure I have my drum out when I run through East or West Freeport.  I used to<br/>
go invis but the militia scum has added a couple of guards that see invis<br/>
now so that strategy no longer works.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t kill me if they can&#39;t catch me!!<br/>
