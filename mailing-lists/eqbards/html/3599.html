&gt;Well hell - REAL simple solution to this - just have something popup to<br/>
&gt;accept a bind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The assumption is, if you are in the group, you wish to be bound.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t want to be bound, disband before the spell is completed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>None, anymore.  They nailed that bug - you can only cast invis on someone<br/>
in your group.  And then, see the above answer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The only possible detrimental effect I see of levitate is if you are<br/>
swimming, and suddenly levitated, wouldn&#39;t you pop to the surface?  Since<br/>
EQ apparently has a major problem with distinguishing vertical difference,<br/>
any creature on the bottom of the ocean can attack you as though you were<br/>
standing on it&#39;s head.  Very annoying, because that means that you can&#39;t<br/>
attack it, but it can attack you.  *ahem* Nice double standard here,<br/>
programmers.  Can I report a death like that as a bug, since obviously, the<br/>
monsters are exploiting it...<br/>
