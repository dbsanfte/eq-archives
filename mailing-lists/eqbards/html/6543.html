<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289015785"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I haven&#39;t been back in my neck of the woods since well.. a long time.  I&#39;m<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about to learn my 16th song and was wondering if Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby is<br/>
worth just running to Kelethin quickly to go fetch it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Or, maybe just waiting until I&#39;m in the area to retreave it..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say yes. It sounds like the devils own deal (clear their agro-list<br/>
then when they wake up you are the only thing on it) but it is not so bad if<br/>
you are in a group that knows how to look out for you. You CAN control over<br/>
sized pulls, and you can help a group get started on an orc camp or the<br/>
like. To do that, muster every brave cell in your body, walk into the Orc<br/>
camp with only your lute singing lullaby. They will all swarm you and<br/>
suddenly a fair number of them (if you are lucky, all of them) will start<br/>
snoozing. If you get stunned a bit first don&#39;t panic, just keep trying to<br/>
play the song. Have your group pick ONE Orc, the strongest one, and kill it,<br/>
then move on to the next, when there is only one or two you can join in<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Big scary fun, like nothing else Ihave done in EQ.<br/>
