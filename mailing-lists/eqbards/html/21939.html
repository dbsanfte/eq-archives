&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t really thought much about stunning a mob before mezzing them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll bring this up with my friend and maybe give it a try. Unfortunately,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we&#39;ve moved away from Frogtown in Lake of Ill Omen which was pretty common<br/>
&gt; &gt; for multiple pulls. Of course, we don&#39;t have AOE stun spells so I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; comment about that, but AOE mez has been extremely nice as long as our<br/>
&gt; &gt; group keeps the frogs together.<br/>

&gt;All enchanter stuns are aoe.<br/>
