<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146076593">Well my secondary is a cleric so let me chime in...<br/>
<br/>
I am kind of torn on this.  I think there needs to be better alternatives to<br/>
clerics to imporve EQ at high levels.  BUT, from my cleric&#39;s perspective,<br/>
druids and shamans get a lot of nice spells that we don&#39;t get.  So there has<br/>
to be a big difference in our healing ability to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
Both classes get SOW, which makes life so much better.<br/>
Druids get ports.  Nuff said...<br/>
Shamans get haste/slow which in can compensate greatly for a lack of<br/>
healing.<br/>
Druids can solo effectively.<br/>
Both get regens.<br/>
<br/>
Clerics get nothing in those fields.<br/>
<br/>
Also shamans and druids can deal damage much better than a cleric can<br/>
(through DOT&#39;s DD&#39;s, Dam Shields, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the poster who said complete heal wa sprobably not a good idea.<br/>
It was fine when lvl 50 was the max, since you&#39;re tanks HP could get too out<br/>
of hand.  Now with lvl 60 tanks, lvl 60 buffs and better equipment, the<br/>
spell is unbalancing.  And it lives Verant in a quandry.  Mobs that are<br/>
meant to be challenging could become comically easy for a group with a<br/>
warrior/cleric, or mobs that are meant to be challenging could become<br/>
impossible for a group without.<br/>
<br/>
Now what to do about it?  Improving druid/shaman healing is probably good<br/>
for the game.  But where does it leave clerics?<br/>
<br/>
This is similar to the bard/enchanter discussion about mez.  I think their<br/>
solution to it was fine.. Bards (especially once you get SoT) are a<br/>
tolerable replacment for an enchanter, but definitly not even close to<br/>
equal.  WIth the current healing issue I hope they do the same.</div>
