  Then again, I don&#39;t have many problems with bard hate anymore;<br/>
  they all went away after L46 or so.  I think that warriors taunt<br/>
  better, enchanter crowd control better, etc.  and this is why<br/>
  bard hate isn&#39;t a big issue late in the bard&#39;s life.  However,<br/>
  if two clerics of innoruuk, a handful of spite golems, and the<br/>
  occansional banshee decide to crash the party, I&#39;m the first <br/>
  one popping back at my bind point. &lt;g&gt;  Same with ice giants in<br/>
  permafrost: 2/3 giants, 2 spiders, and toss in a bear or terror<br/>
  and you&#39;ve just killed your bard. hehe.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Probably not.  I would venture to guess that (and without saying<br/>
  prices which fluctuate from server to server) both RMBs would most<br/>
  likely be equivalent to half the worth of a falchion.  And maybe<br/>
  a fourth the equivalence of a Yak.  I&#39;m just guessing, since people<br/>
  rate their own worth on items and it varies person to person.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
