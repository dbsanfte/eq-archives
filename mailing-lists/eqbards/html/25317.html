<div id="ygrps-yiv-14949256">Everything you said was very true, I was not trying to compare the bard epic<br/>
with the warrior epic really, just saying its silly what they did with the<br/>
scale keeper. He was in game before there was any other place for Green<br/>
scales and red scales are NOT the problem.  I dont understand why he drops<br/>
red scales.  Green, ok would make sense.  White, ok makes sense as well.<br/>
Red, wtf??  I think that Scale Keeper should have a chance to drop any one<br/>
of the scales, red/white or green.  But what I think doesn&#39;t matter.  hehe<br/>

ACK!  Don&#39;t go there, hehe... I understand and agree that the Green <br/>
Scale is a bottleneck for Warriors, but it&#39;s for very different <br/>
reasons than the White Scale for Bards.  The Green Scale is so tough <br/>
for Warriors because of the competition for the spawn.  Sev is the <br/>
easiest of the Kunark Dragons and is an absolute pushover compared to <br/>
Gorenaire.  Any Warrior capable of getting the item out of Chardok <br/>
should be able to kill Sev with ease... IF s/he can find Sev alive.  <br/>
A Warriors difficulty with the Green Scale is more akin to a Clerics <br/>
difficulty with Ragefire, i.e. competition.<br/>
<br/>
A Bard&#39;s difficulties with the White Scale is the level disparity <br/>
between being able to kill Vox and being able to kill Gorenaire.  <br/>
There is basically a source for the White Scale for a 52- Bard and <br/>
one for the 58+, but there is none for the 53-57 Bard.  Basically, <br/>
the problem is that Gore is so damn tough.<br/>
<br/>
I will also agree that Nortlav only drops Red Scales (and also that <br/>
it&#39;s silly that he does drop Red).  He may have initially dropped <br/>
green when he was first put in (when he was dropping 3 scales at a <br/>
time), but there have been no verifiable reports of him dropping <br/>
anything other than Red since the day or so after he initially went <br/>
in.  If he were dropping green, there wouldn&#39;t have been a reason to <br/>
put in yet another source for the Green Scale (VP).  I&#39;m all ears to <br/>
hear about any new evididence, tho, hehe.<br/>

&gt; Well after some research and asking some friends I think he only <br/>
drops the Red scale.  Which is silly because its one of the easier <br/>
ones to get seeing that you can get it from Naggy, Ragefire and Scale <br/>
Keeper (both fairly easy) and you can only get the green one from the <br/>
kunark dragon and some dragon in VP now.  I really hope you are right <br/>
about the green one from the scale keeper, that is such a huge bottle <br/>
neck for the warrior epic much like the white scale for the bards.<br/>
