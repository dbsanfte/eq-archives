&gt;If you can&#39;t design a bug-free interface where items don&#39;t drop through<br/>
&gt;inventory slots, you shouldn&#39;t be able to drop stuff on the screen.<br/>
&gt;Here are 2 solutions:<br/>
&gt;1. Make a &#39;drop item&#39; button right next to, or under, the destroy button.<br/>
&gt;And add an option in the General menu, same as &#39;fast destroy item&#39;.<br/>
&gt;That would probably take some programming, but would be well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this doesn&#39;t fix the UI problem unless you disable the drop feature thru<br/>
the screen entirely.  so i guess i vote no on this.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;screen. OMG! how easy it that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>most of the time i switch instruments i am not in the inventory screen.<br/>
i don&#39;t think this would be very useful at all.  so i guess i vote no on this<br/>
too.<br/>
