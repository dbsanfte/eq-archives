&gt; &gt; Folks, there are three different things going on here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Four, I&#39;d say.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4. Hunting deep in a dungeon. Situation turns bad, EVAC is yelled.<br/>
&gt; Druid/wizard casts evacuate. You have plenty of HP when you get the<br/>
&gt; LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... message. Then after a normal zone load time,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re dumped back into the room you just left, in the same <br/>
&gt; spot, with a<br/>
&gt; LOT of angry mobs. Proceed to die.<br/>
