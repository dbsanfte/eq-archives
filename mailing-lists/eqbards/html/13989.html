<b>Subject:</b> Looks like Lullaby is broken <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-256904549">OK here is what I have to say.  For our songs that have effects that are all<br/>
or nothing (lullaby, pixie, charm, fear, etc) IMO they should be very<br/>
reliable (75%+ chance to success) when used against mobs that are<br/>
green/blue.  As mobs get tougher the chance of success obviously should<br/>
decrease but there should still be a decent chance for success.  If the<br/>
current version of lullaby is only 50% reliable against greens/blues (john&#39;s<br/>
results), then IMO its pretty much a useless song.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly hope that John gets similar results when he tests Lullaby against<br/>
level 1 mobs.  If he does, then I would think that it gives us concrete<br/>
evidence that the song is broken.  Of course Verant could always copout and<br/>
say that was how it was intended to work all along.<br/>
