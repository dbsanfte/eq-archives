<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716321893">I was back to Kith and will prolly buy a condo - they showed me one and<br/>
although the price was great (fire sale they said) it needed too much work.<br/>
We looked at another but the agent musta forgot the keys cuz the doors were<br/>
locked and we could not get in. We did get to peek in though and see the<br/>
place was nicely done in early ranger (did you know that if you put your<br/>
nose to the wall and press your sit key, you will get a glimpse inside as<br/>
you sit down?)<br/>
<br/>
The fog and dark were back - hmm I wonder what kinda bug or did they<br/>
re-patch something?<br/>
<br/>
I like the undeads there a lot!!  Blues and lots of them.  Some reds too but<br/>
need just a bit of a stronger party.  Zones real close. Lots of different<br/>
things to try on them.  Zombies with diseases to resist.  I got pretty good<br/>
xp in the hour or so we fought.  But I am really liking the place and looks<br/>
like I will be there for the rest of this level.<br/>

p.s. we snuck our lev 18 bard brother into Old Guk last night.  Well kinda<br/>
snuck - he hugged the left wall and pulled the greater ice boners.  Good<br/>
thing there were 2 partys right there and we nailed the skellies (blue to me<br/>
at 35 - woo hoo!) The Assn room campers let him stay and gave him 2nd loot<br/>
rights.  He camped for 3 hours and made pals healing a necro who was doing<br/>
the hp-to-mana thing.  His turn to loot and no guise &lt;sigh&gt;  Mean while, we<br/>
went down to Exe room and camped it for 3 hours.  Died when we pulled a 6<br/>
froggie train and lost 1 of our 2 clerics early in battle and 3 tanks<br/>
decided to all attack different mobs.  I lullaby&#39;d with lute but the damn<br/>
tanks kept waking them up and you know the rest of the story.  Our other<br/>
cleric gated out and helped us do CR - dragged us out and rezz&#39;d us back.  <br/>

always.<br/>

by an enraged <br/>
