<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979479171">Actually baking is prety profitable.  You can kill more bats than you can<br/>
stand at low levels and spending 1sp on frosting make batwing crunchies<br/>
which sell for 3.5 sp.  Ok so you only make 2.5sp each but even at a baking<br/>
of 15 I succeed 90+% of the time and it takes seconds.  even buying the<br/>
wings from the merchants who have more than you could ever buy in Kelethin,<br/>
you make over 1sp a piece, all the things stack, etc.  I too was poor,<br/>
though not destitute up to about 10th level.  Of all the trades, it seems<br/>
tailoring is most broken as it is minorly profitable at low levels, but nigh<br/>
impossible to raise above 26 where patchwork becomes trivial, and not much<br/>
good even if you do, because the needed pelts are so hard to find.  In<br/>
trying to raise my tailoring, at 2 pts of success, I have raised my smithing<br/>
making studs and boning to 33 from a start of 15.  When I can raise another<br/>
skill 18 points, to supass the skill I was originally trying to raise,<br/>
solely from making items I need to raise the first skill, that first skill<br/>
is broken.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2sp, cause 2cp ain&#39;t worth nothin<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s all philosophy I suppose.  Some think that the only way one should<br/>
&gt; advance in any way whatsoever is through killing, rinse, killing.  Quests,<br/>
&gt; diversion.  Trades, diversion.  I think it would make the world much more<br/>
&gt; diverse if every member of society didn&#39;t have to play the part of the<br/>
&gt; ultimate hero.<br/>

&gt; Roop<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and sorry for off-topic ranting too, but bards should be interested in<br/>
&gt; getting drunk anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just my views here (still off topic, but all us Bards seem to dabble in<br/>
trade skills anyway):<br/>
<br/>
After fighting my way up to level 11, mostly solo, and barely getting<br/>
enough plat to afford my songs at each level, I was told that I should<br/>
work on trade skills to make the money I needed.  Ok, that&#39;s well and<br/>
good then.<br/>
<br/>
I started out cooking, and what did I find?  Not only did the food sell<br/>
poorly, but that most players only eat bread because it&#39;s the cheapest<br/>
thing to get from the merchants.  Hmmm...ok, so I can only cook for<br/>
myself effectively then (and at a loss--but I can always hope that<br/>
cooking will mean something in the future).  I&#39;m up to 24 or so in skill<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Next skill, tailoring.  Here&#39;s something that actually makes a little<br/>
money.  At least enough to pay for the patterns (since I hunt my own<br/>
skins).  But what did I find?  No market--everyone wants banded armor.<br/>
Patchwork is useless except for the lowest levels, and most of them<br/>
either ignore auction, or have already got what they wan.  Ok, I&#39;m still<br/>
making enough off of the merchants to at least get somewhere.  Up to 21<br/>
in this skill and seeming to be stuck there (still get alot of failures<br/>
and I can&#39;t do studded yet).<br/>
<br/>
Time for blacksmithing to learn to at least make the studs for my<br/>
tailoring skill.  As far as I&#39;m concern, this is a complete loss for<br/>
now...the cash I spent on it set me back as a tailor because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
afford the patterns for the longest time.  Although I was able to get<br/>
studs made up with a little patience.  Skill here, about 18.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, finally despairing over getting enough cash to even _think_ about<br/>
affording banded armor, let alone getting a magical weapon (yeah, I am<br/>
still using my Mino), I turned to brewing.  Even figured out some of the<br/>
recipes without spoilers (though I turned to those after a while), and<br/>
found that it was even worse than cooking.  I lost even more cash at this<br/>
than I did at cooking (though blacksmithing cost me even more).  I even<br/>
got up to 25 in brewing.<br/>
<br/>
So, what does that leave?  Hmmm, I can spend several days fishing and<br/>
eventually I&#39;ll make enough plat to afford good armor.  Or I can keep<br/>
hunting lions, wolves, and bears in EC for tailoring, like I have been.<br/>
I was thinking of trying pottery, but in light of what I&#39;ve been hearing,<br/>
I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t try to waste my money on that.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, it looks like Verant wants lower level folks to be dependent on<br/>
handouts from higher level folks.  I find it rather sad that I can barely<br/>
get necessities on my own each level up to level 10 and now that I&#39;m<br/>
level 11, I really need banded to survive and I can&#39;t afford it, nor does<br/>
it look like I will ever afford it soon.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 copper rant,<br/>
