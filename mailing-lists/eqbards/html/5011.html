If you wanna try brewing, bog juice (water and snake scales combine in brew<br/>
barrel) is supposed to be real easy.  I made some first time.  Wonder if you<br/>
can drink it?  I need it to give to some guy in west karana for his<br/>

		In baking, can any meat be mixed with bread to make<br/>
sandwhiches? Is a spit<br/>
		sort of like a portable oven? I&#39;ve purchased the first<br/>
delicicies book and<br/>
		just can&#39;t imagine buying 10 baking books for recipies.</div>
