<div id="ygrps-yiv-430320054">Huh?  You have me confused now Sylly.  Were you being sarcastic?  It clearly<br/>
states at the top of the patch message, &quot;The following changes have been<br/>
implemented on the live servers:&quot;  That seems pretty clear to me they think<br/>
these changes are in now.  Maybe its just too early in the morning for me<br/>
yet and my sarcasm-meter hasn&#39;t activated yet &lt;hits self on side of head to<br/>
clear cobwebs&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t get it.  I have now gotten 12 emails from non-bard friends<br/>
asking me if the &quot;See Invisible&quot; enhancement is the only one not working or<br/>
if we got totally screwed again.  It still raises the same question for me.<br/>
<br/>
How in earth, Heaven, and Hell can they possibly defend the position that<br/>
they test changes when they put in something like this and it is patently<br/>
obvious it does not work!  30 seconds of testing maximum and its apparent to<br/>
anyone with more visual acuity than the aforementioned Stevie Wonder that it<br/>
does not friggin&#39; work!<br/>

Although it maybe too early to &quot;tell&quot; what is really going on.  I dont know<br/>
if the fact that they are posting the story about GZ having (and testing<br/>
with) a different client code than customers get is good or bad.  It maybe<br/>
that all the P.R. is lagging behind the reality of things.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly dont know if they yet understand the need (or do they even have<br/>
the means) to test the stuff they release.  Who in their right mind would<br/>
put up all the P.R. stuff (release message, GZ answers, etc.) and address<br/>
concerns with &quot;go look, it&#39;s in the patch, we did good...&quot; and then have the<br/>
patch be so botched.  Something is terribly amiss.<br/>
<br/>
To those guys who posted: &quot;should I be able to see myself invis...?&quot; I gotta<br/>
say, it sure seems like the &quot;release notes&quot; talk about what you can expect<br/>
in the next release rather than the current release.  If I had just landed<br/>
here from another planet and was learning the language by comapring what<br/>
they write to what they do, that would have to be my interpretation based on<br/>
how they behave.  And its been like this for as long as I have been playing<br/>
(April &#39;99.) So, yes you can expect to see yourself and party when invis,<br/>
but not in this release, this is merely the &quot;announcement release.&quot;  Look<br/>
for it in the next release with is the &quot;fix our mistakes&quot; release.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that is just the technical aspects.  Hehe, funny how we expect that the<br/>
software should actually work right.  Now about the &quot;design&quot; or &quot;vision&quot;<br/>
aspects.  They seem to have some plan to make certain classes &quot;manadatory&quot;<br/>
for certain situations.  Wiz to gate you into planes, mage have mana things,<br/>
necros same, bard same.  But as far as fine tuning for bards - no, I dont<br/>
have any &quot;good&quot; feelings that something nice will happen. A hint that the<br/>
next song might be something &quot;cool&quot; ? Scares me, to be honest.<br/>
<br/>
So, now we have been playing this game for nearly a year.  Does anyone have<br/>
a clue about the actual &quot;lore&quot; of Norrath?  What have they done to tell us<br/>
some history?  Why do you raise live frog faction by killing un-dead frogs?<br/>
They try, I guess, the Kithicor thing was tied to some tale about Lany&#39;s the<br/>
daughter of Innoruuk but where is the follow thru?  NewPaw has some tale<br/>
about the new gnolls displacing the olds ones.  Dynamic quests in game?<br/>
They have enough trouble with GM&#39;s duping and selling items on Ebay - so I<br/>
don&#39;t expect anything to happen with any dynamic quests.<br/>
<br/>
Let me finish this so it does not sound like just more ranting and raving.<br/>
I still really enjoy many other aspects of this game.  Last night, I arrived<br/>
to meet my group in OOT and was greeted with: &quot;Glad to see you! Only 3 days<br/>
late!&quot;  Hehe, well, that&#39;s true.  It was 3 night&#39;s ago they told me to come<br/>
meet them and it took me 3 nights to get from Rathe Mts to OOT.  Why?<br/>
Because I meet people along the way and have some adventures.  There is a<br/>
lot to get from the game if you look to the other things besides killing<br/>
NPC&#39;s for either loots or xp.  There are reasons for doing both.  You can<br/>
get more out of the game if you depend more on yourself and less on Verant.<br/>

&gt; Anyone else feel a bit disappointed by this? I felt he dodged or ignored<br/>
&gt; most of the important issues, and didn&#39;t even seem to understand some of<br/>
&gt; the questions, specifically the request for more defensive skills. He<br/>
&gt; started talking about bard&#39;s offence, which was basically irrelevant to<br/>
&gt; a request for more defensive skills.<br/>
