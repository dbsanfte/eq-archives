<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809041022">First let me say, I am 30th, and I hunt in CT also. I was in a group<br/>
just yesterday, and I was twisting Psalm, Hymn with lute, and Anthem,<br/>
Chaining the runners, with occasional charms and pixie strikes, and one<br/>
instance of screech when things turned bad. I never equiped my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I got many compliments on what a &quot;good&quot; bard I was. My group was amazed<br/>
I could play 3 songs at once, and doubly amazed at the effect of the<br/>
three songs I sang. BTW, our group was 5 melee classes and me, no healer<br/>
or caster. We held the Throne room (easily) except for the one time we<br/>
got the templar, a gorilla and a healer, and someone trained us. That<br/>
time I screeched and said &quot;RUN&quot; and everyone got out... everyone but me<br/>
:).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think a bard can add MUCH more than any other class when<br/>
played correctly. I know that when I leave groups, I usually hear &quot;Ack!<br/>
what will we do now? Try to find another bard!&quot; If, on the other hand<br/>
you are using weapons and singing one song... I think just about any<br/>
other class would be more useful.<br/>
<br/>
On a different topic, I grouped in HHK last week and there was already a<br/>
bard in the party, using weapons. I had to ask her 3 times what she was<br/>
singing (so I could sing other songs so as to not conflict) and she<br/>
finally said &quot;well, mostly bellow, and chains if they run&quot;. Then after<br/>
each combat, while the party members were injured, she would sing<br/>
&quot;Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor&quot; so that the cleric could get mana back faster to<br/>
heal. I sent her a private tell explaining jig doesn&#39;t aid mana<br/>
recovery, and she informed me that she KNEW it did, because a level 32<br/>
wiz told her it did. I suggested she try to test it sometime, she said<br/>
the wiz&#39;s word was good enough for her. How frustrating! I refuse to<br/>
play Jig for anyone, no matter how many people tell me it helps. I ran a<br/>
test myself, and came up with ZERO increase in recovery, so I feel<br/>
confident when I say to the casters &quot;Jig does not aid mana recovery&quot; (I<br/>
should make a hotkey for that :). Can&#39;t Verant just put a note in the<br/>
news confirming and denying some basic rumors like this and the 6 person<br/>
XP bonus? Would make our lives easier :)<br/>
