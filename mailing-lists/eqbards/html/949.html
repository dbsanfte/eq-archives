<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756905753">Ok... I&#39;ll join in on the &quot;unveiling&quot;...  Linako Lindenlyre, female half-elf<br/>
bard is in reality....<br/>
<br/>
...a 42-yr old male, from Oregon.  Currently work as a controller (i.e.,<br/>
glorified bookkeeper) at a country club.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to play a bard not so much for the music, but for the JoAT concept,<br/>
since I&#39;m a JOAT in RL. =)  My RPG experience goes way back to AD&D back<br/>
around 1979 or so (yup, I played a bard then too... Bandimur of Darkmoor,<br/>
aka &quot;Bandy the Dandy Bard&quot;)<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m a 26-year-old male.  I play in an international live-action fantasy<br/>
&gt;roleplaying club, where I play... Yep - a Bard.<br/>
&gt;Like my character, I&#39;m a jack of all trades - playing a variety of<br/>
&gt;instruments (though none of them incredibly well) as well as working<br/>
&gt;several different jobs.<br/>
&gt;I love to do web design and roleplay, and have numerous pages dedicated to<br/>
