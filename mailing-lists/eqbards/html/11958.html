<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838505538">Ugh - (I should leave it at that but here goes...)<br/>
<br/>
The SG with the plans is a 25ish mob - or so the rumor goes - but I am<br/>
confident in that although I have yet to actually con him.  So, once you get<br/>
him - should be no trouble.  That being said - look out for them other SG&#39;s.<br/>
Ugh - con blue to me at 38 but sheesh they hit really hard and have some<br/>
high MR (resists me - ugh)  And on top of all that - they can teleport to<br/>
you.  Yes, stinking things will get &quot;stuck&quot; on dunes or whatever and the<br/>
anti-safe zoning code will teleport them to you.  I died in my current level<br/>
cuz of just that.  <br/>
<br/>
Me 38 bard, a 32ish bard and 34ish necro tried to kill one.  Other bard<br/>
died, I was under a bub and carefully running for Oasis thinking I got it<br/>
made cuz Habib is clear across the zone when whammo! You have been slain...<br/>
(tried to use my squad ring but think it did not fire becuz selos was up)<br/>
Grrr.<br/>
<br/>
Now had I been smarter - I woulda conned him and determined he was not the<br/>
one I wanted (although I am not sure I am gonna see a green SG quite yet -<br/>
maybe) and if he was not the one - just let the DE Smiths take care of him.<br/>
He is pathed close to them and they will kill him pretty easily.  Then wait<br/>
by the Derv camp for the next spawn. I waited around one day for like 3<br/>
spawns and did not see the Kiliji SG (supposedly his id is &quot;sand giant&quot;<br/>
instead of &quot;a sand giant&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Now why the heck am I doing this in the first place???  Well, a young bard<br/>
in my guild wants one really bad so... I am helping.  But you would be<br/>
better off going to Permafrost and trying to get into a group doing the King<br/>
room - get yourself a Crystaline Blade - much better than Kiliji (wt 8 is a<br/>
hvy beast) or getting a Silvery War Axe - prolly better.  But still I think<br/>
the Staff of Writhing is the best damage application tool for bards in their<br/>
30&#39;s - and yes I am still looking for a Obsidian Shard but use my Dragoon<br/>
Dirk while I look.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. some guy said he got one in 2 hours of camp time. also when you are<br/>
there look out for the Ancient Cyclops - if you have helpers that would a be<br/>
a very rare spawn and he has jbootie stuff - I think??  But more importantly<br/>
- the Terrorantula spawns in that zone - look out for that beast - he will<br/>
give a full party of mid 30&#39;s a real good fight.<br/>

		Well I think I am getting tired of my measly well balanced<br/>
long sword,and I<br/>
		think its time for a new slasher :)<br/>
		I was thinking of the Brazen Brass Kilij and was<br/>
wondering-how common is the<br/>
		sand giant with the plans for this quest-is he camped?<br/>
		Can he be camped?<br/>
		I hate to say, I have been in high keep so long,I forget<br/>
what the rest of<br/>
		the world is like(blinks in the sunlight as he steps outside<br/>
the keep).<br/>
		I never really hunted much in Ro-went to Guk for the first<br/>
time last<br/>
		eek( pretty sad for my level)-never been to CT,or MM. Yes<br/>
I&#39;ve led a very<br/>
		sheltered life-but back to my original question-any help<br/>
would be<br/>
		appreciated- or is there a better weapon out there i should<br/>
look for-I dont<br/>
		get alot of  play time-most I can play at one stretch is<br/>
maybe 3-4 hours on<br/>
		a night when the little woman is asleep :)- so I cant really<br/>
do a 10 hour +<br/>
		marathon.<br/>
		Any help would be greatly appreciated. By the way, this is<br/>
gotta be the best<br/>
		list out there :)-Thanks in advance.<br/>
