&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sigh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;Crier stares into the distance imagining what it would be like to have<br/>
&gt; a group listen to her advice.&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would be so nice if a group I was in would listen to me when I tell <br/>
&gt; them things like this.  Maybe I&#39;m just not tactful enough (although I<br/>
&gt; genuinely try to be), but when I get into a group of 5 or 6 people<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s always at least one guy (and usually more) who just doesn&#39;t &quot;get<br/>
&gt; it&quot;, or says &quot;Who made you God?&quot; when I try and tell them that I can<br/>
&gt; control the fight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While Ive never had the &quot;Who made you God?&quot; thrown at me, I do<br/>
occasionally get people who just dont get it.  If the situation is going<br/>
to get me killed I will usually just excuse my self politely and get out<br/>
of the group.  usually however just politely explaining before the battle<br/>
starts that you are capable of turning a 6 on 4 into a 5 on 1 as long as<br/>
everyone concentrates on one target will be enough to convince all but the<br/>
stupidest to at least try playing your way.  Ive found the more dangerous<br/>
the situation, the more likely they are to see it your way ie. the<br/>
inevitable big pull in Solusek, Permafrost, or Cazic Thule.  One thing you<br/>
also might try is to demonstrate on 1 mob.. just tell them not to attack<br/>
and watch the ones who have never seen a good enchanter or bard in action<br/>
watch in amazement as you stand right next to the big lizzie and not get<br/>
hurt.  I&#39;ve also found that the higher level the people, the more likely<br/>
they are to be willing to at least try and see if your way will work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone needs to /assist the puller&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not switch targets unless I say&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not use AOE effects or spells&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not DoT the mob you arent fighting&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the cursing, but this sort of advice is generally greeted with<br/>
&gt; a &quot;Fuck you.  Check this bossy bard out...  Don&#39;t tell me how to play my<br/>
&gt; character.&quot;, usually from a warrior or a necromancer (often Dark Elves for<br/>
&gt; some reason).  I implore my group to let me lullaby mobs and yet they<br/>
&gt; continue to, fight after fight, attack multiples.  Even if I stand there<br/>
&gt; and lull, lull, lull shouting &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;use assist&quot;, &quot;fight one&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;fight one&quot; they just won&#39;t do it.  This isn&#39;t just one group, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; probably 8 out of 10. It&#39;s discouraging.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can always say that the way they are playing is going to get you<br/>
killed so if they dont try it your way you will find a group that will.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Part of my problem might be that I play on Fennin Ro.  That server is<br/>
&gt; almost ALWAYS at the bottom of the list when sorted by number of<br/>
&gt; players. Usually 1,700 or 1,800, even on a weeknight.  Weekends, forget<br/>
&gt; it.  I&#39;ve seen Fennin Ro hit 1,900.  Them&#39;s some crowded zones.  Playing<br/>
&gt; EQ on Fennin Ro is oftentimes like playing Quake.  Four groups camp something and the instant<br/>
&gt; it spawns they&#39;re all blasting for all they&#39;re worth.  I have gotten to<br/>
&gt; the point where I refuse to play in Highpass Hold.  The people camping<br/>
&gt; the Orcs are some of the rudest, Kill Stealing-est, nastiest and most<br/>
&gt; juvenile players I&#39;ve ever encountered in any game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have never hunted in highpass hold since the time my necro<br/>
friend and I tried to get just 1 kill and couldnt do it.  We do<br/>
not kill steal but others had no compunctions against taking ours. <br/>
 Ive found that Highpass Hold just is not a good place to fight if you<br/>
arent a wizard kill stealer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s gotten to the point where I would consider abandoning my 21st level<br/>
&gt; bard on Fennin Ro and start a new bard on another server if I thought<br/>
&gt; the people were friendlier.  What do you people on the (slightly) less busy<br/>
&gt; servers have to say?  Are they any friendlier?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Povar is fairly friendly with a few idiots and some very good players. now<br/>
if only you could have an idiot list so you could check to see if you<br/>
thought they were an idiot the last time you played with them.  Id<br/>
recommend trying to find some good players (rangers, enchanters and<br/>
clerics tend to be pretty smart players) to group with and dont be afraid<br/>
to leave a group if you think you are going to die<br/>
