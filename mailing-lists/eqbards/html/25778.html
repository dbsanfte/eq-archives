<div id="ygrps-yiv-920378268">I did this in front of the Goblin mines in LOIO until lvl 30.  <br/>
Pull with lament and a lute<br/>
Bellow a few times to soften them up<br/>
pull to the far side of the area to minimize adds (goblins can stun so you may want to party alone with your newfound friend until you are accustomed to the technique)<br/>
rinse and repeat.  great fun<br/>

Gargoyles in OOT<br/>
I was able to use all instrument combo to bring it down pretty low (Chords <br/>
of Dissonance, Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord, Hymn of Restoration - swap brass <br/>
and lute appropriately) and when it got me too low, I would bellow kite <br/>
using 2 bellows and accelerando. This was pretty hard, so I would only <br/>
recommend this for someone who is a great kiter.<br/>
