<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435266619">Is it me or do the same stupid subjects come back every week? Such as Jig,<br/>
people please lay this subject to rest, its been overdone, it doesnt do<br/>
squat to help the party regen rate....  And whats with the off topic stuff?<br/>
why is it that a subject will get started on a quest or an item, and next<br/>
thing you know, you get 30 more emails with the same subject but its about<br/>
favorite weapons or twinking?  come on guys, give it up. stick to quests and<br/>
stuff like that please. Some topics are great, like the rubicite threads,<br/>
the dream weapons and such, but they always take a left turn and end up<br/>
being a huge spam of the ol inbox about twinking and irrelevant stuff. I get<br/>
in the morning and read about 7 or 8 emails, and delete well over 40 emails,<br/>
thats not including the ones i delete during the day.<br/>

&gt;      Ummm...  This has been thoroughly researched by many of us on this <br/>
&gt;      list.  It seems to effect how often the bar is refreshed but does not<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      actually improve the speed of mana regeneration.  We have conducted <br/>
&gt;      many tests with stopwatches and such.  In fact we have beat the <br/>
&gt;      subject to death..  (he he)  It doesn&#39;t help at all.  Period.  We<br/>
&gt; WISH <br/>
&gt;      it did, in fact it would be a great way to cure the level 15 to 32 no<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      one wants to party with Bards blues but, sigh, it is not to be. Trust<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      us, that web site is wrong.<br/>

&gt; Greetings all,<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that nobody seems to know how Jaxan&#39;s Jig can be helpful...<br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; of the websites mentioned that it increases the recovery pulse rate for<br/>
&gt; all <br/>
&gt; three bars (not just stamina) from approximately 8sec/pulse to 6<br/>
&gt; sec/pulse.  <br/>
&gt; So what? Well, what this means is:<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; - If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana <br/>
&gt; regen <br/>
&gt;   (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>
&gt; - If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should <br/>
&gt; increase at the <br/>
&gt;   same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one) <br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even <br/>
&gt; more critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this <br/>
&gt; information, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; even try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; an upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of <br/>
&gt; Jaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>
&gt;      <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-)<br/>
