<div id="ygrps-yiv-686670613">Heh I don&#39;t know how to say this but it&#39;s not very hard to learn what do to<br/>
with a class in the early levels even with people. Even as a Necro as my<br/>
main char I know when a Cleric should nuke or when he should hang back and<br/>
use heals. It&#39;s very easy to learn a class at least I believe so. Also as to<br/>
how much mana a spell takes that means nothing as you can learn that in<br/>
seconds and know how much your spell is going to take. Believe me twinking<br/>
when you have a high level char is no big deal if it allows you to by pass<br/>
the first 15 16 levels quickly.<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s what I said - you have a basic understanding.  You<br/>
&gt;still lack the intimate knowledge it takes to play the class<br/>
&gt;well.  I know my cleric friends can heal, and I know they can<br/>
&gt;nuke.  I know that sometimes it is better for them to use mana<br/>
&gt;to nuke than to heal.  But aside from vague situations (e.g.<br/>
&gt;mob that heals itself if you don&#39;t have a nuker), I cannot<br/>
&gt;with confidence say when a cleric should nuke and when he<br/>
&gt;should heal.  I have little or no idea how much mana these<br/>
&gt;spells take, nor do I have their experience of hundreds if not<br/>
&gt;thousands of situations where they&#39;ve tried a little bit of<br/>
&gt;this or a little bit of that.  Just like I wouldn&#39;t expect my<br/>
&gt;cleric friends to know when to switch from buffing, to MR, to<br/>
&gt;healing with my songs.  You don&#39;t learn that until you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;played it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Besides which you don&#39;t learn much in the early levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That assumes that the same strategies work at all levels.<br/>
&gt;While there are several meta-strategies that do work at all<br/>
&gt;levels, as a bard you should know that what works and what<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t changes with each new song you get and each new level<br/>
&gt;you gain.  If you&#39;re going to powergame solo to L50 to play<br/>
&gt;with your L50 friends, then I&#39;d agree with you.  But if you<br/>
&gt;plan to play the early/mid levels with other people, then it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;in your and their interest that you learn how to do it well.<br/>
