<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267566064">True,  however:<br/>
<br/>
1)  It&#39;s a lot more than &quot;A couple pulses&quot;.  Typically it&#39;s about 2 entire<br/>
twists (30 seconds or so) before I get mobbed.<br/>
2)  We have far more AC than an enchanter<br/>
3)  We have far more HP than an enchanter<br/>
4)  We have far more melee ability than an enchanter<br/>
5)  We have higher dodge skill than an enchanter<br/>
6)  We can cast while being hit (an enchanter cannot)<br/>
7)  We can outrun anything that comes near us (outdoor) they cannot.<br/>
(technically we can indoors too if you use jig and jump the whole way)<br/>
<br/>
the list goes on.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that everyone likes to have high AC.  And we can still get ours<br/>
pretty damn high.  And I&#39;m not sure why you can&#39;t get your AC above 850.  As<br/>
it stands now, at level 40, mine is 803.  And I don&#39;t have any Imbrued nor<br/>
do I have an AC belt, AC Necklace, AC Rings, AC Ears.  My cloak is a level<br/>
25 item (lizard scale) and my hat is AC 5.   I could easily, if I were<br/>
willing to give up some charisma and dex, crank my AC to around 900... at<br/>
level 40... without a single piece of imbrued and only the singing steel<br/>
boots.  At level 40 it&#39;s hard, even for a warrior, to break the 800AC<br/>
barrier.  For a bard it&#39;s just as hard, but not impossible.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my question is:<br/>
Is it that you are envious of the warrior/paladin/sk AC or is it that you<br/>
just want it to be easier to get over 900 AC?<br/>
<br/>
If you want high AC you have to do what warriors do, give up having high<br/>
stats so that you get AC and strength.<br/>
<br/>
If you want high stats you&#39;re going to sacrifice AC.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &quot;And enchanters have the exact same problem, with even LESS generic AC<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; bards have. If something resists mez, then it comes straight for the<br/>
&gt; enchanter. (And if several things resist. Yikes! Dead enchanter.)&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a big difference here:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enchanter scenario:<br/>
&gt; Lots of mobs come.  Mobs jump whoever is closest until Enchanter AE<br/>
Mez/Stun<br/>
&gt; fires off.  Enchanters can be resisted, but the Enchanter resist rate is<br/>
FAR<br/>
&gt; less than a bard resist rate; perhaps when they get around to fixing<br/>
Lullaby<br/>
&gt; and Pixie, that&#39;ll change.  I very rarely have to charm anything off of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; enchantress I play with (I charm very quickly when I see her getting<br/>
&gt; tagged).  Enchanters also have a relatively quick-casting Stun line that<br/>
&gt; allows them time to reapply the mez for those resisting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bard scenario:<br/>
&gt; Lots of mobs come.  Mobs jump whoever is closest until the bard&#39;s next<br/>
song<br/>
&gt; pulses (anywhere from 0.01 seconds to 3.00 seconds, depending on where in<br/>
&gt; the twist the bard is).  Then all extra mobs proceed to gank the bard.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes, it does take a couple pulses.<br/>
