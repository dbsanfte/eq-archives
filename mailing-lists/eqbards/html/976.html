&gt;At least most of the time. People&#39;s characters are their characters and<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s who I know them as. Good enough for me. That&#39;s what a roleplaying<br/>
&gt;game is about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not that it&#39;s bad to wonder. But I hate when people ask me prying<br/>
&gt;questions too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, some people do mind and there is nothing wrong with that, but I have <br/>
met so many interesting people during beta.<br/>
<br/>
I met a group of Japanese role-players who were part of a japanese online <br/>
gaming magazine (the name of it evades me at the moment). They were very <br/>
cool, and I had many fun adventures with them. I kinda figured it out <br/>
because they &quot;typed&quot; mainly broken english. (If any of you know Ryuzem, <br/>
Sapphirezz, Beni, or Layel, tell them I said &quot;Hi from Tavyn!&quot; Oh and if you <br/>
see Ryuzem let me know what server he is on, haven&#39;t spoken to him since <br/>
beta 3.)<br/>
<br/>
One of my party members was an expecting mother, and had her child during <br/>
beta and was out for a couple weeks. Another one was a student from <br/>
Argentina, and I met a few more from Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I&#39;ll only ask if it&#39;s someone I party with alot though.<br/>
