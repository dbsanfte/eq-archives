&gt; an old level 50 cleric friend of mine. We are NOT grouped with him not<br/>
&gt; having ANYTHING to do what the 50th cleric was doing. AND we are pulling<br/>
&gt; our pulls to the opposite side of the courtyard. These mobs are INSANELY<br/>
&gt; green to a 50th cleric considering most are blue to me at 26th. Anyways,<br/>
&gt; during the course of our battle  I would see the 50th cleric heal one of his<br/>
&gt; group way across the yard, having nothing to do with our group. Our mob<br/>
&gt; would make a B line for the cleric and we would be off chasing our pull.<br/>
&gt; This happened several times. I asked the cleric if perchance he was casting<br/>
&gt; on our mob or healing us or anything. Nope..  the mob just hated a 50th<br/>
&gt; cleric helping anyone I guess.<br/>

it, and your mob was partially aggro to their bard due to bard<br/>
hate.  When the cleric healed the bard, that ticked your mob<br/>
off at him more than anyone in your group, and it went to beat<br/>
up the cleric.<br/>
