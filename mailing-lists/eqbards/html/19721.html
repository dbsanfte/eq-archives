<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Singing Steel missing pieces <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-819664613">How about having one of the pieces give a bonus to all songs that are sung?<br/>
Maybe the helm could be +15% to songs that are sung.  For instrument songs<br/>
the bonus would increase what you could do without an instrument but<br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t equal what you could do with one.  For other songs it<br/>
would just give a way to help those out.<br/>

i&#39;m with you right up til the end.  that would be totally unbalancing to<br/>
have an<br/>
instrument double the effect.  actually on further thought it would be<br/>
pretty <br/>
unbalancing period.  can you imagine singing 3 chants with the drum effect<br/>
and being able to dual wield yaks?  plus you&#39;d be able to mix instrument<br/>
song<br/>
types and get the maximum usage out of the songs without having to switch<br/>
instruments and at the same time have the bonus of using weapons.<br/>
