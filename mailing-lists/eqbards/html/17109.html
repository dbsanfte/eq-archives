 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m surprised you got it to work.  I tried soloing a wounded<br/>
bat at the zone using Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD.  I managed to take<br/>
it from 70% to 50%, while it took me from full hp to 1 bubble<br/>
despite hitting me way less often than normal.  I zoned back<br/>
and exclaimed to my guild that &quot;Damn, bats have a lot of hp.&quot;<br/>
You must&#39;ve taken an ungodly amount of damage from 5 bats.<br/>
<br/>
Must be your lute.  :)<br/>
