<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825034642">i didn&#39;t mention, i was the same faction category with or without the flute,<br/>
but only with the flute would the vendor sell to me.  so it must have bumped<br/>
me to a higher level of that same faction category.  i agree with everything<br/>
you say.  the dark elves in sro while not KOS will not sell to me with or<br/>
without flute, so i must be very low dubious, while those merchants in<br/>
commons must have been very high dubious.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; mention it is simply a faction song.  it absolutely has a <br/>
&gt; difference with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; flute.  example, in west commons i went to the inn and was <br/>
&gt; told to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; heck out.  sing carillion, get the heck out.  play <br/>
&gt; carillion with a flute,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello Shada you might find an orc pick handy...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I did not produce the same results. </span></blockquote></div>
