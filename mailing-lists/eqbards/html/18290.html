I have heard rumors that Bravura does NOT cap 49 but caps at the Bard&#39;s<br/>
level.  On the Concert Hall someone posted they charmed a level 51<br/>
Gullerback last night.... I will try and confirm this tonight.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 51 songs...song of travel is nice until you kill your <br/>
&gt; friends with it<br/>
&gt; hehe (i haven&#39;t yet, but i did get scared when i broke <br/>
&gt; through the clouds<br/>
&gt; and was 2000 feet above Karnor&#39;s), and i do use the new <br/>
&gt; largo&#39;s over chains<br/>
&gt; since it does not get resisted as much as i expected.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 52 song... worthless.  it drops when you get hit due to <br/>
&gt; the absorb<br/>
&gt; damage aspect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 53 songs...worthelss.  Song of Dawn seems to do nothing, Song of<br/>
&gt; Twilight is an upgrade to pixie&#39;s and therefore works just as <br/>
&gt; poorly.  I had<br/>
&gt; huge hopes for this one, eqcasters listed it as a stun, not a mes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 54 song...worthless.  45% haste means nothing when any <br/>
&gt; haste item+any<br/>
&gt; haste spell/song gives you max haste.  even anthem is better <br/>
&gt; than this.  was<br/>
&gt; hoping that since the haste cap was raised above 75% (i think <br/>
&gt; it can get as<br/>
&gt; high as 100% now and is based on level and class, ranger i <br/>
&gt; was fighting with<br/>
&gt; was at 90% at level 53) it would mean something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 55 song...nice, but reaffirms us as mana pumps, and i&#39;m <br/>
&gt; gonna hate<br/>
&gt; having to switch to lute between every fight to get the max <br/>
&gt; potential from<br/>
&gt; this (ok so i am lazy, my fingers hurt after weaving songs <br/>
&gt; for 12 hours in<br/>
&gt; upper bugs for 1.5 bubbles).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 56 songs...both geared for running away from bad <br/>
&gt; situations, dunno how<br/>
&gt; useful they will be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 57 song...worhtless, when was the last time you used denon&#39;s<br/>
&gt; dissension?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 58 songs...one nice there is nothing wrong with an AC <br/>
&gt; increase, can<br/>
&gt; weave it with Vov, the other is the same useless piece of <br/>
&gt; crap the level 45<br/>
&gt; song is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 59 song...is this a joke?  yes the real reason i have <br/>
&gt; for getting to<br/>
&gt; level 50 is so i can charisma buff my entire party! woohoo!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 60 songs...both look awesome at first glance, hopefully <br/>
&gt; make it worth<br/>
&gt; the frustration of getting to 60.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Level 39 song...soon worthless as we start fighting mobs <br/>
&gt; above level 49, but<br/>
&gt; i use the hell out of it now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; btw Parry caps at 75.  guess we can assume riposte does also, <br/>
&gt; i was hoping<br/>
&gt; more along 125 but better than nothing i guess, though <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to work<br/>
&gt; much at that cap.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ok these thoughts just came from conversations with the level <br/>
&gt; 54 bard in my<br/>
&gt; guild.  i am trying not to get depressed.  someone cheer me <br/>
&gt; up, please!<br/>
