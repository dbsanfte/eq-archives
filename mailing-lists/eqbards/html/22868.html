&gt;haven&#39;t used it for anything<br/>

&gt;illusion masks, which give nothing other than the illusion), and it equips <br/>
&gt;in the primary hand, so you can<br/>
&gt;equip the Lute of the Howler and the off-hand mesmerizing Lute (Melodic <br/>
&gt;Truncheon?) and attack with two<br/>
&gt;Lutes at once!  Dueling banjos!  hehe.<br/>

Can someone who actually plays go through my instrument list the next time <br/>
I post the FAQ?  In fact- would everyone please read the FAQ?  Not because <br/>
it&#39;s full of great information (which it is), but also because I need your <br/>
help updating it...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
