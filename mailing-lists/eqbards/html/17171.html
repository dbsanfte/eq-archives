<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The first bard I ever saw in combat was in lake<br/>
&gt; Rathe...she was a wood elf, 19th lvl and using the<br/>
&gt; classic all instrument attack to much better effect<br/>
&gt; than my 19th lvl druid could have done.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She saved my life twice that morning and I was so<br/>
&gt; impressed with the way she played, I decided to make<br/>
&gt; up a bard too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I could solo them at 19. They arent easy, you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to use your songs<br/>
&gt; &gt; wisely, otherwise it will be a long way to zone<br/>
