<div id="ygrps-yiv-173763332"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Why would you want to play AE songs?  What songs are you talking about?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are in Guk without an enchanter, you are probably the person who will<br/>
&gt;need to do crowd control.  So, if (or more like when) you get more than one<br/>
&gt;mob, you will be doing Pixie strike.  If you have an enchanter, you will not<br/>
&gt;want to use AE and break the mobs out of their messed states (ok, Largos<br/>
&gt;does not break enchanter mez so that is one option.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In lower Guk, I&#39;d think you would want to buff your tanks: chant and<br/>
&gt;celerity or anthem and elemental if you are fighting casters. If you are in<br/>
&gt;a situation with multiple mobs and no crowd control, that is a problem.  And<br/>
&gt;playing area effect damage songs is not the solution.<br/>

Sorry, should have been more specific.  I mean, Largo&#39;s specifically, maybe<br/>
Lullaby.   Not the damage songs.  Haven&#39;t used those in an Age.  :)<br/>
Right now, my line up for a normal battle is Chant, Celerity, Clarity<br/>
(Chains somewhere in there if no ranger/druid for snare).  If its one of<br/>
the wizard frogs, then I try to pixie pixie pixie etc.. for the interrupts.<br/>
 If more than one pulled, I do the pixie mes thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion on using elemental when fighting those nasty<br/>
wizards. I&#39;ll try that instead of the Pixie Crush.  :)<br/>
