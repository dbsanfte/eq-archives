<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853850987">That sounds like a blast.  You must be 60 by now, right?  Man, to be among<br/>
the first to explore Velious, I think that&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
I started taking classes, and go every night, 2 weeks at a time, with a week<br/>
off in between.  That means almost no time for play.  Just this past<br/>
weekend, I managed to reach 26.  I&#39;m hoping to find enough time this coming<br/>
weekend to reach 27.  Not likely, but I play when I can.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to wait to pick up Velious.  It will probably be summer<br/>
before I&#39;m high enough to go, so I&#39;m in no huge rush right now.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I&#39;m camped outside of Mistmoore.  I&#39;m thinking of heading to Lguk<br/>
as soon as I can.  Can you believe I *still* don&#39;t have that mask from the<br/>
Assasin?  All those attempts, I finally said the heck with it. :) Soon I&#39;ll<br/>
be high enough to group and go get it myself!<br/>
<br/>
What I wouldn&#39;t give for a self only IvU song!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, back to work for me.  Feel free to respond directly to my email if you<br/>
want, these fine, fellow bards are probably groaning and rolling their eyes<br/>
about now!  LOL!<br/>

Hi, Atonal! I wondered what happened to you! I have been on this list for at<br/>
least a year, but I try not to bore folks unless I have something to<br/>
contribute. There&#39;s a couple bards from Xegony here: Slyde and Darkfoxx come<br/>
to mind first, but I apologize to the others I can&#39;t call to mind instantly.<br/>
Evercrack is a disease, we were moving and not playing for abouut a month<br/>
and we were itching to get back. I may never finish getting rooms painted<br/>
with Velious out!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Velious, we went last night, visited or toured about 7 zones<br/>
total. Reminded me why I love being a bard! Outdoor exploration! We were<br/>
grouped but outdoors ended up going off in different directions, so I made<br/>
the fast runs around the zones walls to look for connections to other zones.<br/>
We&#39;d already been to the Coldain city and found mostly lots of folks wanting<br/>
a rez. Our cleric was longsuffering but rez&#39;ing everyone that asked. We only<br/>
killed things that attacked us first since faction is unknown and that was<br/>
all mostly green stuff. I bought the 34th song from the gnome pirate camp, I<br/>
only saw it and no other songs for sale there, along with all the other<br/>
class spells. So far, I like the new interface options, the higher<br/>
resolution options, and my machine wasn&#39;t as bogged as I feared it would be<br/>
(400 Celeron).<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t already, check the Concert Hall boards, a new lute was found<br/>
that gives Illusion Howler.<br/>
