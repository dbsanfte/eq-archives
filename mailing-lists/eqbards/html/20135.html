<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; How about this in the leaching catagory. The mask of deception, my<br/>
&gt; &gt; understanding is that this rots a lot on most servers. I also see a<br/>
&gt; lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; lower level bards with one. When I have 19th level invis song is it<br/>
&gt; possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get to the Assissin room (provided it&#39;s camped) and wait<br/>
&gt; patiently and<br/>
&gt; &gt; politly for one to drop?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The level 19 invis song will only get you dead, fast, on the way to<br/>
&gt; the Assassin room.  Almost every frog you&#39;ll see will be undead.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not tough to get to the Assassin room, but you will need invis<br/>
&gt; to undead.  Unless, of course, lguk is super camped.  On my server,<br/>
&gt; PreKunark you could walk anywhere you wanted on dead side lguk,<br/>
&gt; without fear of getting attacked - population averaged 90 - 100 most<br/>
&gt; nights.  Now it&#39;s more like 65 - 75 and the frog&#39;s life expectancies<br/>
&gt; have climbed. :)<br/>

undead. Guess not.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Lower Guk with my ranger the other day, 45 people and about 3 of<br/>
them not anon.</div>
