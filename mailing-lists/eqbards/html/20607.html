<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Charm kiting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172993634">Another thing that hasn&#39;t been mentioned is timing the recharm.  As soon as<br/>
your pet is charmed and sent to attack, you should start up a song.  If I&#39;m<br/>
injured I use Hymn, otherwise I use Selo&#39;s.  As soon as it pulses, I stop it<br/>
and start a second song.  Selo&#39;s for sure this time.  As soon as it pulses I<br/>
stop it and count to 4 or 5 slowly, as in 1 one thousand 2 one thousand...<br/>
between the 4 and the 5 I will start the charm song.  Usually I will get a<br/>
charm wears off followed by a glazed message before the mobs have taken more<br/>
than a couple of steps toward me.  If I get a resist I will pulse Selo&#39;s<br/>
again before trying another charm to avoid getting pounded.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;ve started doing is...  as soon as the pet is recharmed I<br/>
will run past the mobs and turn to face them again.  This way I do a better<br/>
job of avoiding wanderers, and usually end the fight at approximately the<br/>
place it started.  I&#39;ve tried using other views but find them less<br/>
immersive.<br/>
<br/>
Once my pet has won, I will wait for the charm to wear off, lead it a little<br/>
distance from the corpse, recharm it and issue a /pet guard here command.<br/>
Then I can go loot the corpse without getting jumped.<br/>
<br/>
One mistake I often made at first was going to find another mob and charming<br/>
it to kill off the first pet.  The problem with this is that the first pet<br/>
will completely ignore second pet and attack me.  If I ran the second pet<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be in melee range, so I usually ended up zoning.  Now I just<br/>
chain/fear my original pet.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been my experience that it&#39;s not a good idea to charm a magic user,<br/>
especially one that can heal.  It will heal it&#39;s opponent somewhere along<br/>
the way.  I&#39;m not sure if it does it before it can be recharmed or while<br/>
it&#39;s charmed, I just know it get&#39;s the job done.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
