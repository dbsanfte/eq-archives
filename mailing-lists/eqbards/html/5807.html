&gt; Is this a bard list or a MLM list?  Please, don&#39;t post any more garbage<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this or I will petition to have you removed from the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you kidding me.  I&#39;ve been part of this list for over two months.  Did<br/>
you suddenly decide to bring this up this time because all I said were three<br/>
words.  How is that any different from the person that said &quot;Great story&quot;?<br/>
So what if my signature file has a few lines of advertising.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
posting here all this time to hear about and contribute to the bard class in<br/>
Everquest.  I though the story about the take down of Lord Nagafen was very<br/>
cool.  I would love to be a part of that someday.  If someone comes in here<br/>
spamming the mailing list with advertising, great ban them I&#39;m all for that.<br/>
But that&#39;s not even close to what I have done.<br/>
