<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022407985">If I am not mistaken, you have no effect (ability wise) from losing a level.<br/>
All you appear to lose is: The ability to train in skills for that level,<br/>
all HP appropriate for that level, and gaining skill levels beyond what&#39;s<br/>
available to your current level.<br/>

&gt; Have to say this is one of the best lists that I have ever been on.  Seems<br/>
&gt; to me that most people here are actually adults.  :)  Anyway, enough<br/>
patting<br/>
&gt; on the back, I have a quick question.  Just made level 16 last night<br/>
hunting<br/>
&gt; in Crushbone.  I got a few more kills for insurance sake and set off to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; the Ayre.  Went to High Keep, got the song, scribed it, memorized it, and<br/>
&gt; went back to Faydwer.  My question is, what if I were to die enough to<br/>
lose<br/>
&gt; a level?  Would I lose the song completely, just not be able to memorize<br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; or what?  Haven&#39;t seen any discussion on this and was just wondering if<br/>
&gt; anyone has experienced this yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you are on Veeshan give me a tell and say hi.<br/>
