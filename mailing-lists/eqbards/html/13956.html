Some very good level 40 + friends helped me get the quest lute, the Lute of<br/>
the Gypsy Princess, and the MM Battle drum all in one  night. :)<br/>
We headed for the bedroom where the maid spawns-had to evac only once and<br/>
was there 3 hours. Our puller really knew the place well, and 90% of the<br/>
time only pulled one mob. The music room is where the gypsy musicians are<br/>
found, and you can see the lute on them-but if you pull to the maids room<br/>
you have a great chance to avoid the nasty trains-also the firstt thing we<br/>
did on arriving was to invis all the way to the kitchen,and clear that room<br/>
first-then head  to the maids room-hope this helps.<br/>
