&gt; it&#39;s *really* looking like there&#39;s a sign error for the<br/>

sign error in damage shield stacking as well. I wonder how many other<br/>
ones are lurking about in the code causing the inexplicable problems<br/>
people notice. <br/>

In the meantime, time to swap out the guise for grotesque, take off<br/>
