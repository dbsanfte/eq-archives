levels to do Vox.  On my serv, three guilds team up to tackle the<br/>
difficult dragons.  We&#39;ve been able to take all three of the wanderers<br/>
down (Sev/Tal/Gor).  From what I could see, the &quot;trick&quot; to Gorenaire is<br/>
one part enchanters (sieving) and one part enough meleers so that not<br/>
everyone is feared at any given time.  I&#39;d estimate we had 10-12 groups<br/>
there to cover the fear reductions (pulled to BW zone to fight, fear path<br/>
ran east).<br/>
