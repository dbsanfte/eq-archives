&gt; A similar thing happened to me twice when I was camping behind the back<br/>
&gt; porch.  One time, my group was resting after a fight.  I had been using<br/>
&gt; Denon&#39;s Discord during the previous fight.  While everyone is resting, the<br/>
&gt; back door opens up and a festering hag makes a beeline towards me.  Next<br/>
&gt; thing I know she zaps me for 300+ hit points and I&#39;m dead.  If there is a<br/>
&gt; bug with the  axis whatever is it something that Verant is aware of and is<br/>
&gt; working on fixing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know it&#39;s been bugged and demonstrated to GM&#39;s several times, as there<br/>
are also nasty Z axis bugs in many other dungeons. The tower in the<br/>
undead part of Lower Guk is well known for this. As to whether it&#39;s<br/>
being worked on, as it&#39;s been bugged it&#39;s probably on their todo list<br/>
but the only indication we ever get as to whether they are actually<br/>
working on it is when announcements show up in the test server patch<br/>
notes that they think they have fixed it. I guess they feel that<br/>
publishing a list of known bugs with the priority of the bug fix would<br/>
not be to thier benefit.<br/>
