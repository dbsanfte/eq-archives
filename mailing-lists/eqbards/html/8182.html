<div id="ygrps-yiv-367068405"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;There are /feedback and /bug commands to take care of <br/>
&gt;these types of problems.  These commands will be routed <br/>
&gt;to the Developers who can fix the problem.  Or email your <br/>
&gt;complaints to Verant directly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In theory you are absoutely right, however in practice <br/>
typing in /bug and some information is like putting stuff<br/>
in the bitbucket.  I&#39;m not convinced that /feedback and<br/>
/bug actually get examined often enough.  I&#39;ve already<br/>
done those things, yet the problem continues.  /petition<br/>
makes the Guide log my complaint in their database of<br/>
things that are wrong.  And as for taking up too much <br/>
time.  The guide merely needs to answer me that he <br/>
received my complaint and logged it.  He doesn&#39;t need<br/>
to visit me or even think about any issue, he just needs<br/>
to field my call, like a good support rep would.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well if IDIOTS fill the petition queue with RETARDED petitions<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I assume that means me the &#39;idiot&#39; with the &#39;retarded&#39; <br/>
question doesn&#39;t pay the 10 bux a month to get some kind<br/>
of support?  Bzzzzt.  Wrong answer.  Too few guides/GMs<br/>
is the root of your frustration with not getting answered<br/>
quickly enough.  My problem isn&#39;t life threatening, then <br/>
again no one&#39;s really is - it&#39;s a game.  A game that needs<br/>
a lot of work, imo.  If I make my voice heard enough, <br/>
something is bound to change.  Plus this problem affects<br/>
everyone in my party, not just me.<br/>

You think thats retarded not to petition?  I&#39;m an idiot =)<br/>
