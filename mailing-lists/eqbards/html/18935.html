per piece and he said 8K.  I think this is absolutetly outragoes.  I <br/>
mentioned to my wiz that I heard on this list some people mentioned <br/>
5k-6k and others even 1.5-2.  He said he thought prices were higher <br/>
on Xegony than other servers.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard outrageous demands (5 - 8k) for Singing Steel as well.  I <br/>
just wish them luck in selling it and try not to LMAO to them <br/>
directly. :)  I was lucky to receive boots from a guildmember as a <br/>
gift (I feel so twinked! :) but I would not pay 5k for either gaunts <br/>
or boots.  There aren&#39;t THAT many Bards out there to keep the price <br/>
that high, even if some are naive enough to pay it.  I&#39;d pay 1.5 - <br/>
2k, maybe as high as 2.5k if I go long enough without (or I&#39;m <br/>
planning a trip to Kedge).  Otherwise, I&#39;ll wait until I can get them <br/>
myself, or am able to loot some Imbrued.  (I finally have a large <br/>
enough buffer in 47 to tempt me to Hate next trip I am invited on :)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I sold my Lambent Boots for 400 pp.  I would think 5 X that <br/>
price is reasonable for the Singing.<br/>
