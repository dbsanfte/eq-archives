<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-387726796">Its been confirmed on the EQBrewers mailing list that only rangers and<br/>
druids can forage the unique forage items.  If you are a brewer, you have to<br/>
acquire the unique foraged items from one of those classes because they<br/>
aren&#39;t sold in shops.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I believe there is a skill-check involved in foraging the new special food<br/>
&gt; (like crocodile eggs, mushrooms, sea salt, sylvian berries, glowing lich,<br/>
&gt; etc), but I&#39;m trying to figure out what it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. Have any of you bards managed to forage something other than berries,<br/>
&gt; fruit, rabbit meat, roots, veggies and water? And at what skill level did<br/>
&gt; you get it?<br/>
