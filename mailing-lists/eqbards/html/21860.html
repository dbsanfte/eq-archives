misguided? /shrug<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I personally like more STR in equipment (not songs) is so <br/>
that I can carry more. I keep hearing that STR increases your damage in the <br/>
long run, but I&#39;ve never really watched this very closely.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, our haste song (to use the example of the enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; keeping 3 tanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hasted) does have the added component of STR.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lol. Ah, yea. I never looked that far ahead in bard songs. Well when you <br/>
are grouped with an enchanter, you obviously aren&#39;t in the group for your <br/>
speed boost. Would Verses of Victory be a poor option for a level 54+ bard?</div>
