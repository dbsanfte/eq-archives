<div id="ygrps-yiv-599708388">Go to North Desert of Ro.  Lots of stuff there to keep you busy, also check<br/>
Oasis.  Or try Misty Thicket, it has goblins, orcs, spiders, young kodiaks,<br/>
lots of things that will keep you busy up thru around 14th level.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could even go back to Crushbone, at 12th level except for the royal<br/>
party you should be able to take down most orcs as long as you have a medium<br/>
sized party.<br/>
<br/>
I went back at 16th level and totally controlled the whole dungeon (minus<br/>
Dvinn), with a party tho, we killed Dvinn 8 times.<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[eqbards] Where to go?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just reached level 12, and now the things I used to hunt in Steamfront<br/>
&gt; all con green. Where should I go from here? I could stay here and kill<br/>
&gt; mino&#39;s, but they&#39;re too hard to find (camped most of the time). Where<br/>
&gt; should I go from here? What&#39;s good for level 12? Any help is greatly<br/>
&gt; appreciated.<br/>
