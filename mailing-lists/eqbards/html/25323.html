<div id="ygrps-yiv-446166905">This may have been covered but the reasoning behind having the faster weapon<br/>
in your main hand is because the dmg bonus for STR is applied to main hand<br/>
only.  So the more times the dmg bonus gets applied to your main hand<br/>
weapon, the more dmg you will do.  14/24 vs 11/23 I think I would do the<br/>
same thing and put the mace in main hand.  1dly vs 3dmg isnt worth the odds<br/>
you wont make your duel wield roll.<br/>

If you&#39;re committed to using the Mace and Saber combo, I&#39;d put the Mace in<br/>
primary.  Normally you want the fastest weapon in the main hand to take<br/>
advantage of the primary hand damage bonus, but in this case I believe the<br/>
better ratio of the mace will make it superior to the saber.  If I were you,<br/>
tho, I&#39;d use the Partisan in main and the Mace in offhand... I believe<br/>
that&#39;ll give you a higher damage output overall (19 Delay fast weapon in<br/>
primary and great ratio weapon in secondary).  Reserve the Saber for<br/>
situations where you don&#39;t want aggro.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to verify my recommendations on Copelands just to be sure,<br/>
hehe.<br/>
<br/>
There is a proc message, but for the life of me I can&#39;t remember what it is<br/>
atm.<br/>

  I have the following:<br/>
  Guardians Mace 1HB 14/24 Proc: Guard (24 or so Cleric AC Buff)<br/>
  Symphonic Saber 1HS 11/23 CHA+10 Int+5 Symphonic Harmony<br/>
<br/>
  Which should go in the primary and which in secondary?  The Mace has a<br/>
  better Ratio - but I thought someone posted faster weap should be in<br/>
  primary.  Also - the mace procs CONSTANTLY.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone know if there&#39;s a message for the proc on the Saber?  I just got it<br/>
  and haven&#39;t been able to tell.<br/>
<br/>
  Lastly - I was previously using the Guardians in primary and a Sioniches<br/>
  Partisan (Piercing 9/19 Cha+6 Int+2 Sv Magic+5) in my offhand - and don&#39;t<br/>
  see any reason to hang on to it.  Any Xegony guys know what&#39;s worth and<br/>
  anyone who may want to buy it?<br/>
