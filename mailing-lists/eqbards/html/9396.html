&gt;Subject: RE: New goodies from Kedge Keep and other places ****SP OILER****<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Dragonscale armor sounded sweet as well - I saw that it was quest <br/>
&gt;obtained and my jaw nearly dropped from my skull.  Unfortunately, it <br/>
&gt;requires an item that I have a snowballs chance in hell of getting and I <br/>
&gt;have no idea what the Vial of Swirling Mist is, or where it comes from?  <br/>
&gt;Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I remember correctly, the Vial of Swirling Smoke is the famous Gate <br/>
Potion, sold in Kelethin for the reasonable and economically feasible price <br/>
of 1000pp, give or take a hundred. = )  I believe it is also sold elsewhere <br/>
(East Freeport?) but I do recall seeing it in Kelethin.  Sooo to get this <br/>
armor all you need is roughly 2000pp... oh, and you have to kill Nagafen.  <br/>
