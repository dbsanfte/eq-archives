&gt; The Karana&#39;s probably come to mind, but there&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I almost don&#39;t want to mention this since it&#39;s nice and<br/>
uncrowded, but:  East Karana, run South of the town between<br/>
Highpass and the wooden bridge.  You&#39;ll get to some hills with<br/>
a monument on top.  Gnoll reavers appear all around here (you<br/>
will have to group at L17), and undead gnoll reavers appear at<br/>
night (they are tougher - good to have some clerics and<br/>
paladins along).  There are also all sorts of wolves that<br/>
wander by that are probably green to you but will join in on<br/>
the fights, so you&#39;ll have to stay alert and steer fights out<br/>
of their paths (the spirit stalkers are very neat, and really<br/>
add to the spooky atmosphere of the place at night).  There&#39;s<br/>
also a hill giant path that goes nearby, but not near the<br/>
monument itself.  If you ever do run out of reavers, you can<br/>
run a bit and get a lion or crag spider.  This is a good spot<br/>
from about L17-21.<br/>
<br/>
Highpass is also good at this level, but if you&#39;re like me,<br/>
the camping and kill stealing in that place will make you<br/>
want to quit the game.  The only time I had fun there was when<br/>
all 10-12 people fighting the orcs were friends of mine -<br/>
apparently that was enough people to discourage anyone else<br/>
from trying to camp there as well.  Being friends, we didn&#39;t<br/>
steal from each other, and otherwise had a blast.<br/>

The &quot;next step&quot; are L20+ dungeons - Najena, Upper Guk, Unrest,<br/>
entrance to Permafrost, entrance to Cazic.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I take it you&#39;re like me and like to sweep through dungeons<br/>
clearing as you go, instead of camping?  Find a group of<br/>
like-minded people and stick with them.  Guk and Permafrost<br/>
are a blast fighting like this; Najena and Cazic less so<br/>
(there are good spots for this, but too many &quot;gaps&quot; to really<br/>
make it worthwhile).  When you get to a zone, do a /who to see<br/>
how many people are there, and if any of them are really high<br/>
level (these are probably harvest campers).  If it&#39;s too<br/>
crowded, it&#39;s probably not worth it except for the exploration<br/>
value.<br/>

I dunno, I visited once at 14 (way too crowded then), and<br/>
again when I was like 21 and most everything was green to me.<br/>
