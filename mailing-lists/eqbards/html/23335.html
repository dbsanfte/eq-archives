<div id="ygrps-yiv-545419056">oh and to add on that not all are mediocre, He was also probably one of the<br/>
first groups to do a 1 group fear run on sol ro.  Im not trying to go on and<br/>
on, but people really shouldnt put all their apples in one basket.  Some<br/>
players have it and some dont.  Seems to me that people dont remember the<br/>
ones that do and always remember the ones that dont. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and Halana, there&#39;s a female bard in PD that used to do only Bellows in<br/>
groups when she was back in highkeep...  Name that &quot;mediocre player&quot;.  I for<br/>
one know i&#39;ll never group with her (not only because i&#39;m not on that server<br/>
anymore) but it irritated me that a bard in her 30&#39;s would only play that<br/>
stupid song non stop<br/>

Actually this guy is one of the best players i&#39;ve grouped with, and i&#39;ve<br/>
often put my butt on the line and he&#39;s saved it.  His druid was his first<br/>
char which is 49 (lost a lev being binded at pot room in tim deep).  At some<br/>
point in his playing time, he made an ogre warrior and is level 60. His<br/>
second account has a cleric 43 i beleive on it and his new rogue...  Trust<br/>
me he&#39;s not a newb, and is pretty damn impressive meat shield.  Back when we<br/>
were on sol ro, he came in second place in the botb warrior competition, he<br/>
was 57 then against a 60 ogre with a fungi bp, and he was wearing his hate<br/>
armor.  He got that guy down much further then the 60 that went up against<br/>
him in the quarter finals.  He&#39;s a horrible cleric but a great tank and<br/>
druid.  I am not going to name him, but im sure most 55+ players on sol ro<br/>
know who he is.   I know many soloers are horrible in groups (such as a damn<br/>
druid that kept dotting my mezzed dog in dreadlands) but my buddy is just<br/>
leveling himself up another tank so he can group with us again.  Another of<br/>
my buddies has a 56 warrior now because he became bored of not getting<br/>
groups with his 53 necro.  Its not only twinks you&#39;re seeing leveling up,<br/>
but high level players that are getting bored of doing this for an hour:<br/>
/ooc XYZ level XZ class looking for group...  These 2 players are the 2<br/>
tanks i trust the most<br/>
<br/>

P.S. Dont assume all players are created the same, some are better then<br/>
others. One bad apple doesnt ruin a orchard.<br/>

I really don&#39;t know if it is a lot of &quot;mediocre players&quot; are hitting <br/>
the 50+ range, or if it is all the twinks:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;a friend went to twink his newb rogue in guk last night using <br/>
his druid and he got from lev 1 to lev 17 in 5 hours in upper <br/>
guk. I know he&#39;s loving the new xp system.&quot;<br/>

I know of a level 50 warrior in my guild who has less than <br/>
five /played days (second computer with 50+ cleric/50+ chanter <br/>
characters), and, as far as I know, has never grouped. Do you think I <br/>
plan on putting my life on the line assuming he knows how to play his <br/>
class?<br/>
