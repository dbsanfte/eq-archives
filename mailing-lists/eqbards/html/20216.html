 </span></blockquote>In my guild, Jus Divinum (www.usdivinum.com), on Mithaniel Marr we have 3 50+<br/>
level bards that play frequently (my bard is my primary and I would rather play<br/>
her than any other character).  We have several at lower levels too, and one at<br/>
50 who has an 50+ level cleric that he plays more now.<br/>
<br/>
We also have several 50+ enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very common for me to be grouped with an enchanter.  In fact, an<br/>
enchanter, bard, and monk are the core of our 6 person Fire Giant runs (WAY<br/>
fun).  We also add a shaman, a cleric, and the 6th has been a paladin (because<br/>
he&#39;s my game husband hehe) but that is the spot to put another class.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, one group, or the core group for a larger Sebilis raid, almost<br/>
always has a bard and an enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
The bard is needed to cut the down time.  I agree with Lyrnia ( believe it was<br/>
her) that our strength lies there.  But I have pulled in Sebilis, done crowd<br/>
control, been battle bard...just adapted to the conditions.<br/>
<br/>
But one of the most fun incidents lately was Fire Giants.  A FG wizard<br/>
teleported back to the throne room and summoned me (we were still clearing the<br/>
first few down by the lava).  I realized I couldn&#39;t run out, so I charmed it<br/>
and pulled it back to the group ;).<br/>
