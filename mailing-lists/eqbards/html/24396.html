<b>Subject:</b> Hello, new bard (level 3) and well met to all! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-188672579">Right now I&#39;m around in Qeynos Hills (on the Tallos Zek server) trying to<br/>
stay away from the annoying PKers..(doesn&#39;t anyone ROLEPLAY??, I mean a<br/>
paladin running around killing everyone he sees??)<br/>
<br/>
And I was wondering if anyone has any tips for helpful quests.  I&#39;ve<br/>
already found the copper one, that pretty much got me to second<br/>
level...lotsa running though. : )<br/>
<br/>
What are Bards best suited for as they gain levels?  My combat isn&#39;t too<br/>
bad..maybe like a Rogue?  And the songs are just too cool...I love<br/>
wandering around with a spell up all the time...whichever I choose.<br/>
<br/>
Do we also get songs at every level?</div>
