&gt; opportunity.  The bind song is an option, its been<br/>
&gt; covered actually and was proposed to me for my ideas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I know you said e-mail you, but I want to try the viability<br/>
  of these on the list.  I don&#39;t want a binding song, I don&#39;t<br/>
  want an invis to undead song either, that wastes our slots<br/>
  for things that really aren&#39;t a problem.  Everyone needs to<br/>
  think about what would make you a better choice in a group<br/>
  or a song you wish you had for multiple occasions.  Something<br/>
  useful, and maybe realistic, but be creative.<br/>

            hit myself (base 1200 hp) and the NPC (base thousands of<br/>

  <br/>
  We need songs that make people want us in the groups.<br/>
  And not have us as an afterthought.  I mean some really<br/>
  powerful songs.  I look at enchanter who can charm L50<br/>
  mobs on the planes and I&#39;m like wow, or warriors who hit<br/>
  for 100+ dmg consistantly - and I&#39;m like wow - what do<br/>
  I do?  Nothing someone else can&#39;t do better.  Screw that.<br/>
  We need some unique, and very powerful party songs.  <br/>
  Our songs should be better than any buff or an shaman/<br/>
  enchanter ability since our song is limited to such a<br/>
  low duration.  +66 STR from a L50 shaman lasts over an<br/>
  hour, but my STR buff lasts 6 seconds, it should be worth<br/>
  it to have a bard in the party.  Right now, it&#39;s just<br/>
  kinda neat.  We need to do most things better when it <br/>
  comes to the Party.  I don&#39;t want to melee, I don&#39;t care<br/>
  about unique weapons.  If you want 987654321 STR and want<br/>
  a 100/10 sword then you shoulda been a warrior.  I want to<br/>
  stand in my group and use my instrument to play one or two<br/>
  songs that are absolutely /outstanding/ and /unbeatable/.<br/>
<br/>
  I mean +50 AC, +75 STR.  I mean absorb melee dmg up to 200<br/>
  HP per round.  Have you all seen those things that hit for<br/>
  750?  I want an anti-DT song.  How about a +HP song?  Like<br/>
  +500 HP as long as I&#39;m singing it.<br/>
<br/>
  Too powerful?  Go to the Plane of Sky, where one mob can<br/>
  kill you before you get to turn around.<br/>
<br/>
  Too powerful?  I&#39;ll be able to crush those green mobs that constantly<br/>
  annoy the sh*t out of me.  So what?  I gain nothing from them.<br/>
<br/>
  Everyone here is thinking about what&#39;s the norm in the current<br/>
  game.  Max hit on non-plane Norrath is like 400 dmg per strike,<br/>
  and that&#39;s rare.  Max hit on planar realms is in the thousands.<br/>
  Kunark gonna be a bunch of L40 mobs?  Hell no.  Everything is <br/>
  gonna have DT, and melee in the 500-1000s... I have no doubt about<br/>
  it.  I was right about the L60, and about the spells per level,<br/>
  so my track record here is pretty good =)<br/>
