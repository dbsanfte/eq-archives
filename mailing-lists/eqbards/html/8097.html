<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713732827">Last night, I was in a group of 20ish players at the Aviak village, and I<br/>
was grouped with a Druid who was pulling.  He asked if I could play the Jig<br/>
for mana regen.  I explained that it is an illusion and explained why it<br/>
seems to work.  I also mentioned this list and the results found here, and<br/>
my own investigation on the subject, which matches the lists conclusions.<br/>
He said that he had tested it and that he found that it DID work.  I asked<br/>
if he played a bard and he did not.   We had quite a few casters in the<br/>
group, all apparently waiting for the outcome of our squabble.  So I<br/>
suggested that we go to the arena and test it, but he did not want to.<br/>
Neither did I for that manner, but I had to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Appart from the Druid, all of the other casters seemed to take my word for<br/>
it.  I think that mentioning the EQBARDS list and the extensive testing that<br/>
many players do, gave at least some credit to what I was saying.  I imagine<br/>
that seeing a character who is so concerned and intrested in his class that<br/>
they would join a mailing list and, be active in serious discussion about<br/>
how to play the Bard, gave them confidence.  At least I think it did.<br/>
<br/>
It was either that or the fact that the Druid in question got himself and<br/>
half the party killed while pulling from the top of the Aviak village,<br/>
before we all decided that we needed to regroup without him :(<br/>

If they continue to insist I play the Jig, I tell them that would require me<br/>
to replace one of the eight songs that could actually benefit the group.  If<br/>
they continue to insist I sing Jig, then I will leave the group.  Their<br/>
peace of mind does not outweigh my desire to not die.  Losing a valuable<br/>
song slot to play Jig when I know it has no effect increases my chance of<br/>
dying.  Also, I never tell anyone how to play their character.  Therefore, I<br/>
don&#39;t appreciate it when someone who has never played a bard tells me how to<br/>
play mine.  <br/>
<br/>
With that said, the occasions where I run into people who don&#39;t believe me<br/>
when I tell them the Jig has no effect on mana regen are becoming relatively<br/>
few.  I assume thats because the other bards on E&#39;ci (Faras, Kitasi, Aloro,<br/>
et al) have spread the word and a lot of people are now aware of how the<br/>
song works.  <br/>

&gt; While I know Jig, a song intended for other purposes, does<br/>
&gt; nothing for mana (has been tested and timed) you cannot <br/>
&gt; dump that type of attitude out on your party.  As a bard<br/>
&gt; you are responsible for group coordination through tactics<br/>
&gt; and song, unless an enchanter has that current role in your<br/>
&gt; group.  You also, imo, are there to keep the group solidly<br/>
&gt; happy - with humor/jokes/antics.  If someone in my group <br/>
&gt; asked me to play Jig to speed up their mana (a perceived<br/>
&gt; notion mind you) - I will happily do it.  I&#39;m not trying<br/>
&gt; to mislead them, but if it makes them feel better, most of<br/>
&gt; the time the extra security makes them play sharper.<br/>
