<div id="ygrps-yiv-739281859">My understanding our drum graphic suffers from the same problem as the male<br/>
barbarian shield graphic.  It is there but not referenced.  Brad said a<br/>
while back it is a huge file that needs to be updated. So the expansion<br/>
should take care of this issue (if you have the expansion client that is).<br/>

huh?<br/>
Can&#39;t they just have separate exe&#39;s one with the expansion having textures<br/>
pointing to flash new graphics and the old one with the textures pointing to<br/>
old rusty swords. That&#39;d be a laugh when someone says look at my brand new<br/>
sword doesn&#39;t it look cool, someone who hasn&#39;t the expansion looks and goes<br/>
hey its a rusty dagger :)<br/>
Anyway that&#39;s what I&#39;d do, but then I&#39;m not verant &gt;_&lt;<br/>

The below post from Abashi sure makes it sound like we won&#39;t be getting our<br/>
drum visual fixed even in the expansion.  Also, if they said before they<br/>
couldn&#39;t add it because of memory limitations, are they going to have to<br/>
delete some things to add in the Iskar textures? <br/>

Though the system requirements will be increased for the expansion, EQ<br/>
proper must continue to work for the originally published specifcations. As<br/>
such, we&#39;ll have to see how much texture memory we have left after adding<br/>
the Iksar-related stuff before we can commit to how much individuality can<br/>
be added. Anything that a character can equip or wear must exist in all<br/>
zones, and as such we are restricted by the lowest common denominator of the<br/>
old EQ system requirements. <br/>
Now, on Kunark, the land, and creatures in the zones will have more varied<br/>
and complex textures than you see in the world now. This is possible because<br/>
those items can only be viewed by people who bought the expansion thereby<br/>
agreeing to the new system requirements. <br/>
