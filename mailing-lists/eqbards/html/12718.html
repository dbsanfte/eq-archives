<div id="ygrps-yiv-475343679"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Where do I get it from and how hard is it to get for a 32 bard??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I thought I knew.  In upper guk, and I thought it was the scribe<br/>
  or scryer or something like that.  I never camped it, I just bought<br/>
  mine.  I have a funny story about how I went about getting it too.<br/>
  I&#39;ll post it later.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also can I just confirm it&#39;s resist bonuses, is it +10 or +20 and to what<br/>
&gt; resists does it effect??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  +10 fire, cold, magic.  (it&#39;s a piercing weapon, 5/29 i think)<br/>
<br/>
  Harm.</div>
