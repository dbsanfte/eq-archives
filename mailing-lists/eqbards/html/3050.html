<div id="ygrps-yiv-374752459">There&#39;s still plenty of blue critters in the mino cave area of Steamfont.  Perhaps you just hit a bad time.  I levelled all the way up to 14 there (and still some are blue, but not many).  On Faydwer soloing, I&#39;d probably hit Crushbone, though it&#39;s hard to get a legionaire without also getting more than you can handle.  East Commons is another good place (one zone away from W. Freeport).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  I just reached level 12, and now the things I used to hunt in Steamfront all con green. Where should I go from here? I could stay here and kill mino&#39;s, but they&#39;re too hard to find (camped most of the time). Where should I go from here? What&#39;s good for level 12? Any help is greatly appreciated.<br/>
