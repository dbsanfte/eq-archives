<div id="ygrps-yiv-751833498">It&#39;s not that easy, requires good organisation and people in numbers.<br/>
<br/>
 I would normally do it with my guild but when we decided to do this there<br/>
wasn&#39;t enough of us on, so we invited people from guilds that we have<br/>
formed an &#39;Alliance&#39; with (3-4 small-medium size guilds that do big events<br/>
together) our guilds level 50 enchanter has a crown so I guess next time we<br/>
do it I would be in for the chance of a crown, but I was still angry about<br/>
the way I was treated last night. Instead I got to roll on the Mithril<br/>
Greaves that dropped and If I had won I probably would of traded them on.<br/>

Loaded question;-)<br/>
<br/>
But the point is moot since the decision was made and<br/>
the item given.<br/>
<br/>
...would it be possible to get a few buds together to<br/>
do this again?  Then you&#39;d get the crown....<br/>
