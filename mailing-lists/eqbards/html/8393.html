<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-318329059">I appologies to anyone who was offended by the thread I started.  I saw what could have been a<br/>
larger pattern of what I deem as inappropriate behavior. I wanted to discuss my observations in a<br/>
rational discussion with a large group of people who&#39;s opionions I respect, and who I felt could<br/>
address this topic with the same insight, intelligence and humor, everyone has displayed<br/>
discussing the sexual harassment issue.  I did not inttend this to cause anyone to harm to any<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
I have been Kabonged for approaching the topic of &quot;racism in any form&quot;.  I sincerely believed<br/>
that with the past discussion of sexist behavior, and the inheratent nature of the good vs. evil,<br/>
racial faction penalties, and the race-war server; that this was a legitimate topic for<br/>
disucssion.<br/>
<br/>
I thank you all for your insights.  I have learned a great deal about being a better citizen of<br/>
Norrath and the planet Earth from you.  I will contine to monitor this list, but this will be my<br/>
final post.<br/>

&gt; Zoie, while your question is well phrased, it is still pretty inflammatory,<br/>
&gt; and while I appreciate the interest, we really shouldn&#39;t discuss racism in<br/>
&gt; any form here ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
