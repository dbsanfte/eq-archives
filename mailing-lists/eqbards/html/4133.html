what happens when you effectively twink yourself, and I gave<br/>
him my prediction.  Whether or not he thinks my prediction<br/>
applies to him is for him to decide.  I was *warning* him<br/>
because I don&#39;t think many people who do this kind of stuff<br/>
realize what they&#39;re missing out on.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I agree with some of your points - however I can tell you that twinking will<br/>
&gt; not ruin the experience, especially if it is a second character.  With my<br/>
&gt; primary character, I have been to every single zone in the game except for<br/>
&gt; Solusek A and B and Kedge Keep.  Twinking a second character does not<br/>
&gt; detract from the experience of the game - it just makes the monotony of the<br/>
&gt; lower levels a little bit easier, and may cut down on the deaths  that you<br/>
&gt; would normally get from learning experience.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it is a secondary character, then I wouldn&#39;t do it for<br/>
reasons I&#39;ll get into in another message in a thread.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If this is a first time character for him, even being in full bronze at that<br/>
&gt; level will not matter much.  Full bronze is only 1 point greater than<br/>
&gt; banded, and alot heavier.  Also your AC is directly related to your Defense<br/>
&gt; skill (and other modifiers.)  He is still capped at Level * 5, so at the<br/>
&gt; most he would get maybe a 20-25 point increase in his AC rating.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The different armors types have different damage absorptions.<br/>
I know a lot of monks who decided to switch from a Lockjaw<br/>
vest (AC 12) to a mesh tunic (AC 8) because mesh has the<br/>
damage absorption of chain while the LJ vest has the<br/>
absorption of leather, and they were just taking less damage<br/>
with the mesh.  So it&#39;s not &quot;just&quot; 1 AC difference.  (Though<br/>
I&#39;ll admit this is hearsay and I haven&#39;t tested it myself.  I<br/>
did take a helluva lot more damage when I tried switching from<br/>
plate to mesh, even though my AC was over 100 points higher<br/>
than when I was last in banded)<br/>
