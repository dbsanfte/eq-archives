Also, before the patch yesterday the Inven screen could have a transparent poly background (got removed by accident maybe?) and the Inspection box appeared in the middle of the screen with a poly background.  If you notice on the inspection box, there&#39;s an itty-bitty black square in the upper left side of it...I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s for moving it around like the other ones.  The only problem is that the window is only up when you&#39;re inspecting something, and you can&#39;t click on the square.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll fix both problems in a patch soon.<br/>

Looks like the Coldain city will be the best Tradeskill city around (or at least to park a porter mule at).  In the Exchange (the bank), there&#39;s about 8 different trade skill merchants, and there&#39;s merchant throughout the rest of the city for all the trade skills &#39;cept Tinkering (or at least, I didn&#39;t see one).<br/>
<br/>
My impression of Velious so far:  amazing<br/>
