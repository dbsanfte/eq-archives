<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342524695">From what I hear on Gone, its lvls much more so than resist gear.  At least<br/>
that is what I have heard from the one guild on my server that takes the<br/>
time to kill her every now and then.  I have heard a lot of people complain<br/>
about her poor loot table, and on my server the only thing anyone wants from<br/>
her is the Book/scale.  <br/>

Leadership means nothing when the people there don&#39;t listen to commands.<br/>
Maybe Veeshan is the exception in this case, but I have seen the leader of<br/>
one of our most powerful guilds fail on a Vox run due to complete<br/>
incompetence of the people there.  If people had at all been able to follow<br/>
directions, I wouldn&#39;t be sitting around with my thumb up my butt waiting<br/>
for my guild to get enough resist gear to down Gone.  (I have pretty much<br/>
everything else done).  Bitter?<br/>
