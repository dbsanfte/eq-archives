<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873232681">agility is getting hit less by mobs.<br/>
dexterity is you hitting mobs more often.<br/>
<br/>
i guess it depends on how you play your bard.  fighter-bard would want more<br/>
dex, bard-fighter may want more agility since they attract a lot of<br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
and then there is nothing wrong with getting both dex and agi.  i.e. golden<br/>
black pearl choker 7agi/7dex, best of both worlds =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;      What is better (for a bard, don&#39;t wanna get kaboonged...) Dex or <br/>
&gt;      Agility?  The manuals are rather vague on this.  Anyone done any <br/>
&gt;      testing?  Empirical evidence?  I have been mostly <br/>
&gt; collecting Agility <br/>
&gt;      items based on messages I read in the past.  I <br/>
&gt; personally have not <br/>
&gt;      noticed much effect with dex items even though I have a <br/>
&gt; couple.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;      spent a lot of money (bard money) on agility items and I hope I <br/>
&gt;      haven&#39;t wasted it.<br/>
