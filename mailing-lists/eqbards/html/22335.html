 Good story Windleaf! Those EE&#39;s often have some poor person victimized. I<br/>
think the last time I used Lullaby was on a poor ranger the EE had pet&#39;ed. I<br/>
hit the EE so it sic&#39;ed the ranger on me, ran around til I got far enough<br/>
away to have time to mem Lullaby, then just kept the guy locked down til the<br/>
charm wore off. He was one grateful elf.<br/>

 As to the RenFest in Texas, we couldn&#39;t make it but the Queen and King<br/>
(Excaldi and Gawaine), of our guild were there:  <br/>

 With a monk pulling, we usually make sure he is out of song range or I stop<br/>
singing to avoid agro transfers. Monks die alot on pulling, usually due to<br/>
low MR. If a monk is pulling a caster mob especially, the FD must go off<br/>
before the mob starts casting a spell. Many times the monk dies due to<br/>
spells being in progress when he FD&#39;s, the spell hits and breaks FD, and the<br/>
mob starts recasting before he can FD again. If we aren&#39;t trying to split<br/>
mobs, and we know he&#39;s pulling casters, I&#39;ll sing something with an MR boost<br/>
and stay in his range, just to ease the damage rate on the monk.<br/>
