<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196363798">Actually I agree, choke is a great spell and you get it at lvl 4 right? <br/>
I remember the first four levels after I got that spell were a total<br/>
joke since it was so powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Choke is as much a debuff as it is a DOT though...  I like the enchanter<br/>
debuffs...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tell other players what to do, I just always wonder why people<br/>
made enchanters and then blow all their mana doing damage.<br/>
