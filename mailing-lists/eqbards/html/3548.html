<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282137221">Me (15) and my Pallidin friend (22) attacked Kisdean Gix DEF in West<br/>
Commonlands. He conned green to my friend. I had a dirk and my friend had 2h<br/>
combine. Neither one of us hit for more than dmg 2  while Gix was laying<br/>
into us for 30 a round.  At 2 bubs, we ran to Befallen!  Whatever he is<br/>
wearing - it has ac like a full set of plate!! Also, he resisted my bellow.<br/>
Looks like it&#39;s gonna take some co-level casters in addition to some hvy<br/>
tanks to get him.<br/>
