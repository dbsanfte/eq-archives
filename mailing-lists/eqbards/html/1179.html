<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649674074">1) right click to drink<br/>
<br/>
2) you must train at least 1 point in percussion to use a drum. And yes.<br/>
Hill Giants, Kodiaks, Griffins, Skeletons, and now it seems Darkwood Snakes<br/>
will attack on sight in these zones.<br/>
<br/>
3) there is another exit from Freeport that goes to North Ro. You can kill<br/>
some stuff in the grassy area to get 6th and then head into the desert to<br/>
kill Orc Raiders. Watch out though, even at 6th most things in either of<br/>
these zones will kill you. Another idea is to go to Misty Thicket, the<br/>
halfling newbie zone, which is arguably the best newbie zone in the game<br/>
(Everfrost beats it from 1st to 5th, but Misty will take you to around 10th<br/>
to 12th).<br/>
<br/>
4) didn&#39;t get screwed but the server going down because I&#39;d already been<br/>
screwed by the animal frenzy.<br/>

Subject:  [eqbards] Alcohol, instruments, and hunting grounds<br/>

Hail fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
I have several rather innane questions this morning.  First of all, how<br/>
exactly do you drink the alcohol you purchase?  I know it is a silly<br/>
question but I have never tried before.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, being lvl 5, I just got my Selo&#39;s song and purchased a drum.<br/>
However, every time I equip the drum and attempt to play the song, it tells<br/>
me to stick to singing until I learn the instrument.  Is it a thing you can<br/>
practice at the guild?  The missed note got me stomped by a hill giant<br/>
yesterday.  Do they always attack on sight?<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, where is a good place to hunt at lvl 5-10?  I tried to go to the<br/>
second zone out of Freeport and all there was were Kodiaks, young Kodiaks,<br/>
and of course my friend the giant.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, did anyone else get screwed by the server shutdown yesterday?  For<br/>
the first time since I began playing EQ, I had finally found a good group<br/>
and 30 minutes into our escapades, the messages from the gods came in<br/>
suggesting that we camp so that they could shut off the world.<br/>
<br/>
Bear with us newbies, I realize that most of the people that respond on<br/>
this list are anywhere from lvl 18-50, but you have the stories and the<br/>
knowledge to pass down through your posts.  Its very much like an extension<br/>
of the game.  That is what we as bard&#39;s do for a living!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help!  This really is the best mailing list I&#39;ve<br/>
ever seen.<br/>
