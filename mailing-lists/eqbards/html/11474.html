<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786257496">Well, in pratcie, it seems to be so in game. with Serpent sight, everythign<br/>
has a dull red tinge, not a very big improvement over human sight, but<br/>
enough to see vaguely<br/>
Ultravision allowed me to see most thing, and everythign was basked in a<br/>
blue glow. very bright, in pitch dark, even<br/>

	As the traditional definition of the two terms yes. In game it seems that<br/>
infravision only tends to increase contrast. I remember when I was young in<br/>
East Commonlands that at night the skeletons were easy to see since they<br/>
were light in color but the bears were almost impossible to spot.<br/>

Infra vision outlines Warm bodies and objects  in a light red haze.<br/>
Ultravision lets you see better in the dark makes everythign bright, with a<br/>
blue tinge. much better than infra<br/>

    I should know this - and could probably look it up if I&#39;m not lazy..<br/>
But what&#39;s the difference between Ultravision and Infravision..<br/>
