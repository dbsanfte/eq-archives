<b>Subject:</b> End of an era.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-47681022">Well, I just thought I would share with you the end of an era.  Today (or <br/>
pretty close, their records got messed up) marked my 6 month anniversary as <br/>
a Guide on the Tarew Marr server.  It also marked my last day as a Guide, <br/>
as I felt that I could no longer in good conscience support a company that <br/>
chooses to treat it&#39;s customers in so heavy-handed a manner with no <br/>
consideration for the consequences.  This refers to both the recent banning <br/>
issues (more than just Mystere were banned over this), and the Bard issues <br/>
thread.  It is my belief that Everquest truly IS their world, and as such, <br/>
I have no place being in it.  I haven&#39;t paid Verant a dime in 6 months, and <br/>
I&#39;m not about to start today, so this was my last day on Norrath as a <br/>
player, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I really believed that I could make a difference in Everquest as a Guide - <br/>
not just by summoning corpses, but also by being a good source of input for <br/>
things that needed to be fixed or changed.  I&#39;m well-versed in diplomacy <br/>
(being the Herald for my local LARP Kingdom), and I was very eager to make <br/>
the world a better place.  Unfortunately, from day one, my rose-coloured <br/>
glasses suffered some pretty potent tarnish.  While in IRC, being given <br/>
instructions on what NOT to do as a Guide (&quot;no hunting, no looting, and <br/>
above all, no fighting with players!!!&quot;), I was also online on my other <br/>
computer (Love having two windows machines!).  As I was playing my <br/>
enchanter, I heard the shout that there was a &quot;Giant GM&quot; on the loose in <br/>
the Arena, so I invis&#39;d myself and ran there. (why the invis? I dunno... <br/>
Just didn&#39;t want to attract any attention to myself, and didn&#39;t realize at <br/>
the time that GMs can see invis all the time.)<br/>
When I got there, I saw the giant GM - 3 stories tall, at least!, and he <br/>
was in the process of giving a warning to a rude player who was exploiting <br/>
the arena (charming the lower level guy every time he tried to retrieve his <br/>
corpse).  While I grant that the player was being rude, and certainly <br/>
deserved the warning, what happened next was totally uncalled for.  The GM <br/>
followed up his verbal warning with a spell (some kind of knockback that <br/>
does damage), nearly killing the offending player.  I was stunned.  I <br/>
immediately did a direct tell to a GM in the IRC room asking for <br/>
clairification on this, and at first, until they heard the GMs name, they <br/>
acted somewhat shocked.  When they realized it was a programmer GM, they <br/>
suddenly backed off and said that &quot;well, GM&#39;s know what they&#39;re doing - <br/>
it&#39;s not our place to question that.&quot;<br/>
This, incidentally, was less than two weeks after several guides were <br/>
banned for fighting players in the Arena.  Even the Guides who were brand <br/>
new and just following their leader were suspended, and removed from the <br/>
Guide Program.<br/>
Basicallly I guess what I&#39;m saying here is that *even then*, the hypocrisy <br/>
ran rampant, and that sort of attitude really ticks me off.  I&#39;m not going <br/>
to turn into any sort of Tweety, but I&#39;m also not going to candy-coat <br/>
it.  Verant&#39;s version of social engineering made me sick to my stomach, and <br/>
I refuse to be a part of that orwellian nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting note is that when I posted my letter of resignation to <br/>
the Guide board (which wasn&#39;t nearly as vitriolic as this one - but it did <br/>
include the phrase &quot;rampant hypocrisy&quot;), it was deleted inside of 3 <br/>
minutes.  I had to severely water it down before I posted it again to <br/>
ensure that it would stay up there.  Way to control information, Big <br/>
Brother Verant.  Ignorance is Bliss.<br/>
<br/>
I will remain on the list as an active moderator, and to share Bard <br/>
stories, perhaps even get some input on Bards for my new project, but my EQ <br/>
career is over.<br/>
