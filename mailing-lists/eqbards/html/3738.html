you lose if they left it as before, then to run to your corpse.<br/>

&gt; Well, I don&#39;t particularly want my bard to be able to bind - <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t mind<br/>
&gt; finding or waiting for a caster - my problem is WHERE <br/>
&gt; noncasters can be bound.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As someone pointed out earlier - it tends to make folks much <br/>
&gt; less likely to<br/>
&gt; explore the world - course he was happy bout that - only 10 <br/>
&gt; folks in his<br/>
&gt; dungeon whereas places like BB and CB are bursting at the seams.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you really want folks to get out an explore, you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; penalize them<br/>
&gt; with half hour - hour - sometimes longer &#39;downtime&#39;, just to <br/>
&gt; get back to<br/>
&gt; their corpse.<br/>

&gt; &gt;It was decided early on that all casting classes (not <br/>
&gt; hybrids) would have<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gate, and only a couple classes would have Bind Affinity.  <br/>
&gt; As a matter of<br/>
&gt; &gt;fact, some of you early phase testers might recall that Bind <br/>
&gt; used to require<br/>
&gt; &gt;a then hard to find and costly stone to cast.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;After a lot of heated debate, the spell was given to all <br/>
&gt; pure casters, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;after more heated debate the cost of the spell became mana <br/>
&gt; only.  You don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;want to know how ugly it got when the idea of the casters <br/>
&gt; being able to self<br/>
&gt; &gt;bind anywhere besides in an adventure zone came up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, I wouldn&#39;t ever expect any of the hybrid classes to be <br/>
&gt; able to bind.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt;is not going to happen, it&#39;s something of a concession that <br/>
&gt; bind even works<br/>
&gt; &gt;the way it does now.  The idea of inns or static NPC&#39;s that <br/>
&gt; could bind was<br/>
&gt; &gt;kicked around back in beta, and rejected.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is akin to the exp loss reductions that have twice <br/>
&gt; occurred, once in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Beta, and once again in Final.  Both times, there was a very <br/>
&gt; strong negative<br/>
&gt; &gt;reaction from many members of the development team, a schism <br/>
&gt; if you will.<br/>
&gt; &gt;But in the name of  the holy grail of &quot;playability&quot;, the <br/>
&gt; experience loss<br/>
&gt; &gt;reductions were implemented.   This was partially offset by <br/>
&gt; the increased<br/>
&gt; &gt;experience needed for levels after 25th implemented a few <br/>
&gt; weeks earlier (but<br/>
&gt; &gt;much too late imho, the damage was done)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In the case of experience loss, the changes were made to <br/>
&gt; help out the game&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;actual market.  The mass market, RPG newcomer.   The game is <br/>
&gt; complex by<br/>
&gt; &gt;design, lightly documented by design, and often daunting, <br/>
&gt; and far too many<br/>
&gt; &gt;folks bypass the built in training curve via various <br/>
&gt; methods, leaving them<br/>
&gt; &gt;at moderately high levels with very deficient play skills <br/>
&gt; (and character<br/>
&gt; &gt;skills).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Those folks tended to die a lot more often than was <br/>
&gt; necessary all of a<br/>
&gt; &gt;sudden, and watching that exp bar keep dropping was pretty <br/>
&gt; discouraging,<br/>
&gt; &gt;especially when you didn&#39;t learn from your mistakes.  And <br/>
&gt; there are the<br/>
&gt; &gt;inevitable bugs and zone crashes that were fairly common <br/>
&gt; early in retail and<br/>
&gt; &gt;still persist.  After a bit of this, people start to  vote <br/>
&gt; with their feet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;And since the bulk of the player base fell into this <br/>
&gt; category in one way or<br/>
&gt; &gt;another, from a business standpoint it was suicidal to stand <br/>
&gt; by design<br/>
&gt; &gt;principles in this case.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;With the success of EQ, I&#39;m hoping the existing player base <br/>
&gt; will in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;future be educated enough about RPGs in general, and Verant quirks in<br/>
&gt; &gt;specific, so that when EQ2 rolls out, the bar can be raised <br/>
&gt; in terms of<br/>
&gt; &gt;experience and rate of progression/regression.  Hitting the <br/>
&gt; level cap in 45<br/>
&gt; &gt;days is appalling to me.  Hitting it in 120 days, no matter <br/>
&gt; how dedicated a<br/>
&gt; &gt;player you are, still makes me twitch and drool some.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In the case of Bind Affinity, there&#39;s more than enough bind <br/>
&gt; capable players<br/>
&gt; &gt;online on any server at any time to accommodate player <br/>
&gt; needs.  The only time<br/>
&gt; &gt;this is not the case is when a fresh server comes online, <br/>
&gt; and the race to<br/>
&gt; &gt;12th or 14th level is on, and those few casters that reach <br/>
&gt; it first are<br/>
&gt; &gt;heavily in demand..but only for a matter of days or even hours.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This is still a strong balancing factor.  Synergy.  Interaction.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now, you ask, why did I compare the experience loss changes <br/>
&gt; to giving Bind<br/>
&gt; &gt;Affinity to everyone, either by spell or by NPC&#39;s?  Well, <br/>
&gt; both rank right up<br/>
&gt; &gt;there as the most requested changes to the game.  One <br/>
&gt; happened, one won&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What I would like to see is an NPC that could bind for a <br/>
&gt; fee, and limit<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;class based binding to one of a few classes. The <br/>
&gt; advantage that the<br/>
&gt; &gt;class/es<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;would have is the ability to bind themselves away from a <br/>
&gt; city, which is a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;nice limit for the NPC&#39;s. Make sense to me if you want to <br/>
&gt; foster a sense<br/>
&gt; &gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;being able to explore the world safely.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually, that would make a heckuva lot of sense. J.M., <br/>
&gt; mebbe you could<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; suggest this idea:<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Inn-running NPC&#39;s could, when given the proper coin, cast <br/>
&gt; a &quot;bind&quot; spell<br/>
&gt; &gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; a player. To determine the cost, hail the Innkeeper, and <br/>
&gt; ask the cost for<br/>
&gt; &gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; night.  It would make sense, RP-wise, and if you made it <br/>
&gt; cost, say 1 plat,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; players could still undercut the merchants, but other <br/>
&gt; players wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; SOL.  This would still encourage players to work together <br/>
&gt; to get bound in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; certain areas (not every zone has an Inn, most Inns are <br/>
&gt; inconvenient at<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; best. Certain Inns have associated hazards...), but allow <br/>
&gt; travelers to<br/>
&gt; &gt;feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; safer traveling.<br/>
