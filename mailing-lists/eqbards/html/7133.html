&gt; <br/>
&gt; I too have recently been hunting Aviaks in South K.  I have been in<br/>
&gt; several<br/>
&gt; groups there fighting for the last 3-4 nights.  While I have never grouped<br/>
&gt; with a bard while there, I have paired up (fighting in a group of 2) with<br/>
&gt; several different classes.  Namely, A Druid, A Shaman, A Paladin, A<br/>
&gt; Ranger,<br/>
&gt; and a Necromancer.  In each of these cases I have had a problem that I as<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; bard have never run into.  I was unable to taunt Aviaks off my partner.<br/>
&gt; For<br/>
&gt; once I would be the one ending battle with most of my health, while my<br/>
&gt; partner was near death.  This is nice but unsetteling.  Even with Lullabye<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; would have a terrible time trying to get my share of dammage.  I think<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; some of this is because at 20th level I am getting a lot of resists from<br/>
&gt; Darters and Rooks.  But it cant be just that.  So I think that there is<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; other reason that Im not getting mobed as much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a seperate note,  I did group with 2 other bards in unrest once.<br/>
&gt; WOW...<br/>
&gt; that was cool, and I can attribute not getting all the attention, due to<br/>
&gt; multiple bards.  What fun.  If we had one more bard we could have been the<br/>
&gt; Beatles :)  I also dont think I have ever seen Sooo many icons for Buffs<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; my screen :)<br/>

the monster and your partner. You&#39;ll have to strafe. It won&#39;t always work,<br/>
but I&#39;ve seen it work on some occasions.  Still not sure why.<br/>
