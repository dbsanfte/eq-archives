<b>Subject:</b> Question about Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lement <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122151349">I know that this song has been talked about a whole lot...but sadly i missed <br/>
all of it. All I want to know is how you can take out a whole camp using it? <br/>
I tried this but it did not seem to work. I fought the orcs in east <br/>
commonlands in their camps for quite a while. If i used the song on one and <br/>
then attacked it, when it left camp, the rest of the orcs followed. Can <br/>
somebody just explain all the uses of it?<br/>
Thanks...</div>
