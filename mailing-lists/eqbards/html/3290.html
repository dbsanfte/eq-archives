I think Ged and his Girlfriend (not recalling he name) are either dead (we are talking to their<br/>
ghosts) or cursed. He (or she, likely she) may be a werewolf. I think they had a nice little house<br/>
in the Kithicor until it was burned down or destroyed in some manner.<br/>
<br/>
That lake, that lake *sigh* there is something UP with it (besides two piranha).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway we have a bunch of really weird data points about it, which might be random, but might NOT<br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
Truth is out there<br/>
