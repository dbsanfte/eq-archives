&gt; If a simple bug caused this, then despite the exact order it<br/>

&gt; It sounds like our songs are actually implemented to affect<br/>
&gt; everyone/everything in an area of effect, and checks are in<br/>
&gt; place to disregard the song if you&#39;re not in the bard&#39;s group<br/>
&gt; (or vice versa if an offensive song).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still wonder about that.  I bet the reason our songs had too much taunt<br/>
power until recently was that they fixed the EFFECT  so that it only<br/>
affected<br/>
the group (when they fixed the bug) but they forgot to fix the fact that<br/>
npc&#39;s could detect it<br/>
&quot;trying&quot; to buff people that aren&#39;t in the group.  Thus causing our songs to<br/>
have a greater &quot;taunt&quot; than they should.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if that is what they fixed which seems to have so dramatically<br/>
reduced our taunt?  Just a hunch...</div>
