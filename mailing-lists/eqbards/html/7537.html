bards are tough to categorize.  if it comes down to it and a gun is put to<br/>
my head, i&#39;ll say we are hybrids and i think verant says the same.  since we<br/>
bards are such a mixture of everything, let&#39;s take bards out of the<br/>
equation.  now as far as the definition of hybrid: The offspring of the<br/>
union of two distinct species (or classes in this case).  by definition you<br/>
can not classify shaman, cleric, or druid as hybrids.  <br/>
<br/>
We are looking at the &quot;Hybrid&quot; designation from different perspectives.  I<br/>
see a Hybrid as Magic + Armor/Weapons/Skills or a Melee class.  Pure<br/>
Casts/Priests all can melee with a weapon subset, hybrids get casting plus a<br/>
larger subset of weapons and true armor.  <br/>
<br/>
Class			Armor (Plate/Magic Subset)<br/>
Wizard		No<br/>
Enchanter		No<br/>
Necromancer		No<br/>
<br/>
Cleric		Yes<br/>
Shaman		Yes<br/>
Ranger		Yes<br/>
Shadowkight		Yes<br/>
Paladin		Yes<br/>
<br/>
Fighter		Yes/Default<br/>
Rogue			Yes<br/>
<br/>
Im sorry, but you have to looks at a classes restrictions.  The simple fact<br/>
is, pure casters cannot wear True Armor.  Hybrids can wear a limited subset,<br/>
and Melee&#39;ers can wear all.  Do you refute this basic statement? If you do<br/>
how can you deny that a druid and shaman are a hybrid.</div>
