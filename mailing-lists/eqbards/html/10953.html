<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;m sorry this bummed you out. This was probably a bored level 50<br/>
&gt;playing his twink. It&#39;s a shame he was one of the immature a**hole L50&#39;s<br/>
&gt;but unfortunately the game attracts them as well as some pretty cool<br/>
&gt;people as well. It&#39;s also too bad that Verant has left the game so empty<br/>
&gt;for people at higher levels that all they can do while waiting for the<br/>
&gt;occasional plane breakin or dragon run is play other characters. I know<br/>
&gt;a lot of my former friends got a lot of fun out of going out and<br/>
&gt;gathering equipment for their twinked characters with their L50<br/>
&gt;characters. Personally, I tried it for a while, but I found playing a<br/>
&gt;twink to be a rather boring thing. When you have an enchanter, as I did,<br/>
&gt;decked out in equipment only a L40+ could obtain, it didn&#39;t leave much<br/>
&gt;to look forward to but endless levelling. I still don&#39;t begrudge people<br/>
&gt;that enjoy playing a twink though. Whatever floats your boat. Personally<br/>
&gt;I found it a lot more fun to go play a character on a new server. I had<br/>
&gt;(am having) a gas with my druid I started on the tribunal, who used a<br/>
&gt;cracked staff for the first 14 levels because he couldnt afford anything<br/>
&gt;better and had to pick and choose which spells to buy until L24. Guess I<br/>
&gt;just like a challenge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When there ceases to be any way for players&#39; characters to differentiate<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves from one another other based upon level (i.e. time and effort<br/>
&gt; &gt; expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want, when people look at <br/>
&gt;me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; for them to know that I braved death and died many times to achieve the<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to assume that I bought it <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt; &gt; a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; different story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A lot of people bitch and moan about no drop but I actually agree it<br/>
&gt;would have been a nice thing if they had made the class quest armor no<br/>
&gt;drop. However, I really don&#39;t see the difference between someone who is<br/>
&gt;L40+ getting things for themselves or another character they run.<br/>
&gt;Really, dispite the jerk factor you&#39;ve experienced from this guy, people<br/>
&gt;who are twinking their other characters did put the time and effort in,<br/>
&gt;on their other character, and, as someone on the list mentioned in an<br/>
&gt;unrelated thread, they probably did it under harder conditions than<br/>
&gt;newer characters experience, because they started back when bronze<br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t obtainable until the 20&#39;s or more, and the best weapon most<br/>
&gt;people could look forward to was a combine scimitar at that point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But that&#39;s certainly no reason to look down on people who didn&#39;t advance<br/>
&gt;as quickly. Some people just have so little a sense of self worth they<br/>
&gt;have to get it any way they can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;...The bard that I saw in Oasis would have been in steel<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based <br/>
&gt;upon<br/>
&gt; &gt; my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know* that I had earned <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; pieces for myself.  They would know that I had pulled Gypsy Musicians <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled Gargoyles in Lower <br/>
&gt;Guk<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not being NO DROP has <br/>
&gt;reduced my<br/>
&gt; &gt; efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes <br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel this way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rather than let it bum you out, why not see that anyone who would laugh<br/>
&gt;at you for not being 50 yet should be pitied. While I sympathize with<br/>
&gt;your plight however, I also think that this really stems from a bit of<br/>
&gt;jealousy, I also think learning to deal with that can be valuable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even if they made lambent armor no drop, there would be low level bards<br/>
&gt;running around in mithril bp&#39;s, silver legs, azure sleeves, froglok<br/>
&gt;crowns and dual ykeshas. The only way that Verant could deal with this<br/>
&gt;is to make every item in the game no drop or put level limits on items<br/>
&gt;so you can&#39;t equip them and they&#39;ve repeatedly said they won&#39;t do that.<br/>
