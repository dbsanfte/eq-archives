<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466152992">I would suggest pumping up your strength above all the other stats, thus<br/>
enabling you to wear better armor later among other things already mentioned<br/>
in other posts.<br/>
<br/>
As far as best race goes, personally I dont think there is one.  I play a<br/>
wood-elf and a half-elf , putting most of the extra points into strength on<br/>
both characters and there isnt a difference in playability that I&#39;ve seen so<br/>
far.  The wood-elf is my favorite though only for convenience sake since you<br/>
get forage and hide right off the bat where as half&#39;elves dont.  If you like<br/>
being human go for it, never played one yet as I dont like the lack of night<br/>
vision.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps =)</div>
