<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065951443">In my opinion, strength is the only statistic that bards should put<br/>
their points into.  Yes, there&#39;s no question, the other stats are<br/>
important, but if you want to wear plate or banded mail, and you WILL<br/>
want to wear plate or banded mail, you NEED the strength to carry the<br/>
armour.  Items to increase dexterity and agility are much easier to find<br/>
than strength enhancers.<br/>

&gt; Hey,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m about to start my first bard character and I was wondering what<br/>
&gt; recommendations people had for how to assign the ability points during<br/>
&gt; character creation. What attributes are important? How much to each?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since they are part fighter, strength sounds like it could use some. Maybe<br/>
&gt; some stamina. Their songs, what would that be? Intelligence?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you really need much charisma? seems like you could use one of your<br/>
&gt; songs to enhance your charisma when necessary<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
