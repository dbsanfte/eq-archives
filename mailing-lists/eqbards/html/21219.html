<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920383410"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hmm I haven&#39;t messed with mystic shielding much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Got bored last night and went down to the King&#39;s Room in Runnyeye to<br/>
reminisce a bit (remeber when BI was the rage?).  There  happened to be a<br/>
50+ necro in the room camping for Borxx (she needed the lens and nerves for<br/>
a quest).  Well sure enough, BOrxx popped, and I had had the good sense to<br/>
mem Mystic Shielding.  Out of about 7 or 8 casts on me, Borxx only got one<br/>
to stick :o)<br/>
<br/>
and that&#39;s the totallity of my Mystic Shield experience ;o)~<br/>
