<div id="ygrps-yiv-691192373"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I subscribed to this mailing list a few days ago and so far have just<br/>
&gt; seen postings that talk about the higher levels.  I&#39;ve also noticed that<br/>
&gt; many of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing you&#39;ll notice on this (or just about any other mailing list or<br/>
message board) is that people tend to be more vocal with their complaints.<br/>
When things are going well, mum&#39;s the word.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point: a recent patch had two Bard-related changes.  The first gave us<br/>
meditate at level 10 which allows us to memorize our songs much much quicker.<br/>
Before this, going from dead to ready seemed to take forever.  It allowed us<br/>
to memorize during battle if necessary.  It was something bards have been<br/>
asking for since day 1.  There was one post praising the skill.<br/>
<br/>
In the same patch, the animation of a Bard was changed when we play an<br/>
instrument and run.  Now, instead of surfing along the ground, we waddle along<br/>
like Charlie Chaplin at the end of CITY LIGHTS.  The number of posts was<br/>
staggering with complaints and cries of &quot;Verant doesn&#39;t care!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a Bard&#39;s life changes from level to level.  The changes can be<br/>
staggering, more so than just about any class.  For example, I died at level<br/>
22 probably more than any other level.  At level 23, I didn&#39;t die at all.  My<br/>
advice to you is to play your bard until it becomes tedious rather than fun.<br/>
Then switch to something else.  Hate the poor melee?  Try a warrior.  Hate<br/>
running 15 zones to get to your corpse?  Play a caster.  The Bard isn&#39;t for<br/>
everybody.  Hopefully, you&#39;ll stay with our ranks...it&#39;s a fun ride!</div>
