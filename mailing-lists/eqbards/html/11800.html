<div id="ygrps-yiv-915908705">We are talking about different MOBs.  Correct my Efreeti to Reckless Efreet<br/>
in Sol A.  His rare drop is an Obsidian Falmberge (2HS, War only, dam 20,<br/>
del 50, Obsidian shatter, no drop) and a good portion of the warriors in my<br/>
clan seem to have one now :-).<br/>
<br/>
There is no other Efreet or Efreeti in Sol A that I know of?  Where is the<br/>
Efreeti that you speak of?<br/>

&gt; Efreeti is level 50.  You have to get past a group of 6-8 imp<br/>
&gt; protectors to<br/>
&gt; get to him (level 45+ I think).  Boots and ring seem to drop<br/>
&gt; about the same<br/>
&gt; amount.<br/>

&gt; How hard is the Efreeti to kill, where does he spawn. And how<br/>
&gt; often does he<br/>
&gt; drop those Boots?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard those Efreeti boots trade VERY highly - I&#39;ve seen mithril or<br/>
&gt; Ykesha&#39;s trade with that one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Although I like charm, and I like being able to kill hill giants this<br/>
&gt; way,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it really really sux in a party and is pretty darn boring after<br/>
&gt; the first<br/>
&gt; 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; or 3.  I much prefer holding the bar room in Sol A, or going after the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Efreeti with a party of 6 to watching a couple of giants beat on each<br/>
&gt; other.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Solo&#39;ing in my opinion just isn&#39;t very much fun and it is just clearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; boring compared to the non-stop action of a good dungeon.  Last weekend,<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; did a Guild invasion of Sol A.  We held a good portion of the dungeon<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; two well balanced parties of 6.  A bard and snarer (ranger or druid), a<br/>
&gt; &gt; greater healer (shaman or cleric) and good tanks in each party,<br/>
&gt; excessive<br/>
&gt; &gt; use of lullaby, hymn, anthem.  Now that was TRULY what this game is<br/>
&gt; supposed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be about!<br/>
