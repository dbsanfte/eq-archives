<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502641753">The silk evening tunic can be found at a female vendor next to the <br/>
Lion&#39;s Mane in Qeynos.  If you hail her, she tells you that she&#39;s been <br/>
experimenting with silks.  The shirt is +5 CHA and sells for a little over 1 <br/>
plat.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;(For reference, best selling prices are: minotaur axe 3.33pp, greater <br/>
lightstone 4.3?pp, bronze 2H sword 4pp, combine rapier/longsword 47.621pp; <br/>
best buying prices are: combine rapier/longsword 52.5pp)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     With a CHA of 100 (starting of 95), I can get 4.5pp to 4.7pp for a <br/>
Greater Lightstone and I can buy a longsword for 49pp.  Of course, it may be <br/>
because I&#39;m a agnostic human.  Half Elf Bards generally get higher prices at <br/>
all merchants compared to the native race (i.e. humans trading with humans, <br/>
and wood elves dealing with wood elves).<br/>
     Race is still a factor even with high factions.  With the high faction I <br/>
have with Halflings (warmly, not just from the deputies), I still pay 1s 1c <br/>
for water even though indifferent human merchants sell it for 1s.  The half <br/>
elf  merchant in North Freeport (Alan in a blue building) also sells it to me <br/>
for 1s 1c.  The difference is insignificant, but I&#39;m just using it to show <br/>
that race does matter.  Another example of race is the gypsy camp in the <br/>
Karanas.  They have no faction and are humans.  I was with a few friends out <br/>
there and decided to check prices.  For a two handed sword, a barbarian <br/>
warrior with average barbarian CHA was getting 10pp or so higher than half <br/>
elf bard with 108 CHA who was getting about 5pp higher than me with 100 CHA.<br/>
