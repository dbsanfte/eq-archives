<div id="ygrps-yiv-810573562">I&#39;ve got a necro friend that turns into a pile of bones between fights with<br/>
Call of Bones.  It&#39;s actually kind of annoying as I now have to sit at my<br/>
keyboard and weave Hymn and Clarity just for her.  Whereas she can go afk or<br/>
watch TV or whatever.  But.  I don&#39;t complain to her.  Much.<br/>
<br/>
Crier<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Clarity&#39;s effectiveness seems to max out at 1 pulse ever 6 sec<br/>
&gt; (if you stop/start to get the messages more frequently, you<br/>
&gt; only get mana at the equivalent rate of just leaving the song<br/>
&gt; playing - 1 pulse every 6 sec).  So if you have a decent<br/>
&gt; connection, you can keep Hymn and Clarity going without<br/>
&gt; affecting Clarity at all.  Since you don&#39;t need to keep Hymn<br/>
&gt; refreshed as often as Clarity, what I usually do is let<br/>
&gt; Clarity tick twice (9 sec), give a shot of Hymn (3 sec) and go<br/>
&gt; back to Clarity.  That&#39;s enough to keep the Hymn effect and<br/>
&gt; icon on, while minimizing the chance of disrupting Clarity<br/>
&gt; (due to missed notes).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Besides, my druid friend is a manastone junkie.  She keeps<br/>
&gt; regeneration on herself, and wants me to play both Clarity and<br/>
&gt; Hymn on top of that.<br/>
