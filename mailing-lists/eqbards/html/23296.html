<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318833768">I really wouldn&#39;t want to see Shamans and, especially, Druids get better healing.  The thrust of a lot of<br/>
these letters seems to be that a single Druid or a single Shaman should have enough healing to stand in<br/>
for a Cleric, with maybe some downtime tradeoff.  I really can&#39;t agree with that.  If that were the case,<br/>
what would be the point of a Cleric?  What most people don&#39;t bother noticing is that any combination of<br/>
two of the other healing classes is already quite sufficient (with the exception of rez).<br/>
Shaman/Druid/Paladin, put any two in a party and you&#39;re pretty much good to go.  There&#39;s a ton of Druids<br/>
out there, the problem is that most of them don&#39;t want to or don&#39;t know how to heal.  That won&#39;t get fixed<br/>
by giving them more healing.<br/>

&gt; I am kind of torn on this.  I think there needs to be better alternatives to<br/>
&gt; clerics to imporve EQ at high levels.  BUT, from my cleric&#39;s perspective,<br/>
&gt; druids and shamans get a lot of nice spells that we don&#39;t get.  So there has<br/>
&gt; to be a big difference in our healing ability to make up for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both classes get SOW, which makes life so much better.<br/>
&gt; Druids get ports.  Nuff said...<br/>
&gt; Shamans get haste/slow which in can compensate greatly for a lack of<br/>
&gt; healing.<br/>
&gt; Druids can solo effectively.<br/>
&gt; Both get regens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Clerics get nothing in those fields.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also shamans and druids can deal damage much better than a cleric can<br/>
&gt; (through DOT&#39;s DD&#39;s, Dam Shields, etc...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree with the poster who said complete heal wa sprobably not a good idea.<br/>
&gt; It was fine when lvl 50 was the max, since you&#39;re tanks HP could get too out<br/>
&gt; of hand.  Now with lvl 60 tanks, lvl 60 buffs and better equipment, the<br/>
&gt; spell is unbalancing.  And it lives Verant in a quandry.  Mobs that are<br/>
&gt; meant to be challenging could become comically easy for a group with a<br/>
&gt; warrior/cleric, or mobs that are meant to be challenging could become<br/>
&gt; impossible for a group without.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now what to do about it?  Improving druid/shaman healing is probably good<br/>
&gt; for the game.  But where does it leave clerics?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is similar to the bard/enchanter discussion about mez.  I think their<br/>
&gt; solution to it was fine.. Bards (especially once you get SoT) are a<br/>
&gt; tolerable replacment for an enchanter, but definitly not even close to<br/>
&gt; equal.  WIth the current healing issue I hope they do the same.<br/>
