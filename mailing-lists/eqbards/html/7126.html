<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018595388">Thanks for the support guys, I have asked my detractor to please keep such<br/>
responses to my personal email if he&#39;s going to make it personal.  How on<br/>
earth did he get the idea I was only 12th level?  Even my bard (not my<br/>
highest level character) is higher than that and has been since May.<br/>

&quot;Are you just a stupid XXX XXXX?  I am so sick and tired of all these<br/>
crybabies who has raised up one character to level 12 and thinks their class<br/>
is underpowered.  All your facts are so screwed up&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    If you are tired of it, then get yourself removed from the list.  After<br/>
that little temper tantrum/demonstration of your grasp of the english<br/>
language, I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be missed much.<br/>
