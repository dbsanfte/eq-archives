<b>Subject:</b> Do I ever have a chance at making high level? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050410582">I agree with everything Crier said.  One thing I would like to add is a<br/>
comment on obtaining good items.  Like the original poster, I don&#39;t get to<br/>
play that often.  My bard is my only character and I&#39;ve been playing him<br/>
since April.  When I do play, I only get to play for a couple hours at a<br/>
time.  I&#39;m only 29th level, but I assume that what Crier said about high<br/>
level mobs ripping you to shreds if you don&#39;t have good equipment is true.<br/>
With that out of the way...  <br/>
<br/>
IMO, players like me and the original poster are handicapped when it comes<br/>
to obtaining the really good magic items.  In order to obtain those items,<br/>
several factors come into play.  First off, if you want to get the items by<br/>
yourself, you have to be able to camp the spawn long enough.  Many of the<br/>
items are rare drops so that could mean anywhere from a couple of hours<br/>
during one playing session (if you are extremely lucky) or several hours<br/>
over multiple playing sessions.  <br/>
<br/>
2d factor: IMO its a lot easier to camp the good magic item spawn sites when<br/>
you are in a well balanced group of players who all know how to work<br/>
together effectively.  This is difficult for the casual gamer because most<br/>
of the friends he makes in game usually end up surpassing him in levels.<br/>
End result is that casual gamers tend to join pickup groups most of the<br/>
time.  In my experience, I die more often in these types of groups because<br/>
everyone seems to have their own agenda.   There is a side bonus to this<br/>
however.  Because you are usually camping with new players all the time, you<br/>
do have the benefit of continually making new friends, which is always a<br/>
good thing.<br/>
<br/>
3d factor:  The people who are able to acquire good items are usually not<br/>
inclined to sell them, preferring trades instead.  This hampers the casual<br/>
gamer assuming factors #1 and #2 come into play.  This hasn&#39;t hampered me<br/>
too much in my mid 20s because all my money I have earned since 25th level<br/>
as gone to acquiring gems for the lambent armor.  Once I get all my lambent<br/>
pieces, I want to upgrade my weapons.  I&#39;m still using a dragoon dirk and<br/>
thulian claws.  I haven&#39;t seen anyone selling weapons better than those in a<br/>
long time.  Lot of people willing to trade them for items of equal power<br/>
though.  <br/>
<br/>
The lambent quests are perfect for the casual gamer.  These quests allow us<br/>
to get good items at our own pace.  If Verant would only put in more quests<br/>
for mid to high level weapons and other non-class armor equipment I would be<br/>
a happy camper.  <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is even though IMO casual gamers get the short end of the stick<br/>
when it comes to getting good items, I still have fun playing.  Like others<br/>
have said its not a race to get to 50.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; As to your other comment about equipment speeding things up, this is<br/>
&gt; perhaps<br/>
&gt; only true at lower levels for a twinked character (i.e. a player that has<br/>
&gt; equipment far above his level).  The game is balanced so that at the<br/>
&gt; higher<br/>
&gt; levels you are expected to have that equipment and the mobs are suitably<br/>
&gt; more difficult.  In other words, without advanced equipment at high levels<br/>
&gt; you simply get ripped to shreds.<br/>
