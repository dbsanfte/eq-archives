<div id="ygrps-yiv-412728072"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; my buddy been camping the warden on<br/>
&gt;&gt; sol ro for a couple nights for a belt<br/>
&gt;&gt; of all the nights he camped him he&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;killed well over 15 wardens. try to<br/>
&gt;&gt; get a claw or a belt (good luck).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;No offense intended, but I believe THIS is the type<br/>
&gt;of play style that<br/>
&gt;leads people to extreme bordom with the game. A<br/>
&gt;couple nights wasted in<br/>
&gt;only ONE spot? Doesn&#39;t sound very entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, it has slowed my leveling, but I try now<br/>
to not stay in one zone for more than 2 nights in a<br/>
row.  I&#39;m finding my boredom level dropping fast<br/>
again.<br/>
