&gt;<br/>
&gt;so, you say because I am level 22, you have played everquest as a bard<br/>
&gt;longer than I have? Perhaps you have, but that does not mean you are<br/>
&gt;special. For your information, I have played Martyn as a bard since Day one,<br/>
&gt;And even phase 3 beta. If you have played longer than that, good for you.<br/>
&gt;(applauds)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ive been an addict since p4 beta, not that it matters much in my oppinion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My works schedule fluxuates, not to mention I am in no race to make level<br/>
&gt;50. which explains my level 22 self. I esplore, I goof around. I sing songs<br/>
&gt;in concert. I roleplay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Being level 40 whatever doesnt make you better than me.<br/>
&gt;nor anyone else.<br/>
&gt;that is the tone I objected to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And a level 22 bard is wearing bronze Breasplate, bronze bracers, bronze<br/>
&gt;boots. blackened iron arms, and legs. and some bit of leather.<br/>
&gt;I was in leather until level 16, when I replaced it with some expensive<br/>
&gt;bronze. and then the BI, when I visited runnyeye<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like I said. I am not a twink. The only thing I have ever been given is a<br/>
&gt;barbed whip and some advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have the same &quot;problem&quot; (lvl 24bard played exclusivly since 22th of april) ,<br/>
but I dident take harmonics message this way..<br/>
Bard armor should be no drop. as many of the components are. I do get a bit<br/>
envius when I see a level 14 bard wearing a lambent BP, but atleast I know I<br/>
will get mine eventually.<br/>
Well I am still wearing banded sleeves, leather boots varius pieces of bronze<br/>
and some reacently aquired elfhide gloves.<br/>
I have been given stuff from high level players though. I remember these things<br/>
most notably:<br/>
Bloodstained mantle - In unrest a person shouts out if anyone have seen his<br/>
corpse. Well I tell him that I can take a look for him with my song. I find his<br/>
corpse barely visable at the house. He thanks me heartly and gives me a BS<br/>
mantle!! At level 16 or so thats a big thing. So needless to say I was estatic.<br/>
<br/>
Silvery axe - level 20, Permafrost entrance. I just stood there admiring some<br/>
highlevels killing the ice giant. When they where resting up I talked with them<br/>
and they gave me a Silvery axe - Just like that!! At first I hesitated to take<br/>
it, but my combine scimitar was getting worn and I was there with a ranger using<br/>
mino axes of all things so he could use my scimie as a good upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that what i am trying to say is that being a nice guy can pay off. When<br/>
I offer my help I know that what might look simple can be a real bitch. So<br/>
sometimes I spend a hour helping a guy with not even a thank you as reward. Well<br/>
some people are a**holes so dont expect anything when helping, but those who<br/>
arent just saves the day and restores my faith.<br/>
<br/>
I just got me a lambent bracer and guess what? I did it without any help from<br/>
people I know, which sure feels good. I paid 30pp for the lambent stone (a bit<br/>
too expensive yes, but it was in Highhold keep and it was the only thing i was<br/>
lacking).<br/>
<br/>
I have also aquired the shin greavers and the shin gauntlets - The greavers I<br/>
had some friends help me get, but the gaunts I was allowed to loot by a complete<br/>
stranger while i was hanging out at Lower Guk entrance waiting for my friends to<br/>
arrive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So keep the faith and chill :o)<br/>
