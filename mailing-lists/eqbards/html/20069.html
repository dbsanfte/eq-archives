<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735374108">well at 46 be prepared to play a lot of mana song.<br/>
<br/>
1.  offensive songs like chants will be resisted a TON of the time.<br/>
2.  speedup combat buffs will generally be handled by the enchanters or occasionally<br/>
      the shamen.  if your raid does not have at least one enchanter i would recommend<br/>
      eliding that raid.<br/>
3.  you will be totally ineffective at charming or mezzing plane mobs<br/>
<br/>
so given all these things, what are you left with?  if you happen to end up in a tank group<br/>
(you will almost never be put in the pull group due to bard song random aggro bugs) then<br/>
you could play level 1 song and heal and damage shield if you really wanted to, but i would<br/>
suggest parking yourself next to the cleric and singing mana song while swinging weapons.<br/>
if you are in a caster group then there is not much point to singing anything but mana song,<br/>
heh.<br/>
<br/>
one note:  turn all songs off on the pull.  and don&#39;t start any song until you are damn sure<br/>
the enchanter has any extras mezzed, or else you will be one dead bard very quick.  follow<br/>
the directions of the raid leader to the letter.  and don&#39;t be one of those hyper players who<br/>
seem unable to sit still.  the last thing you need is to aggro something through a wall when<br/>
your spellcasters are low on mana.<br/>
<br/>
ok one more note:  since you are playing a limited selection of songs, you generally will have<br/>
a couple slots open.  one good song to put in there is our bind sight song.  bind sight to the puller<br/>
and you get a nice tour of the zone and you get to see what&#39;s going on.</div>
