<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676382242">Level 11 seems pretty strange.<br/>
<br/>
1. I can learn to use wind instruments, unfortunately I can memorize no wind<br/>
songs.<br/>
2. I can buy a song that uses brass, unfortunately I can&#39;t learn brass for a<br/>
while.<br/>
3. I hear the charisma song has negligible effects anyway, so I assume<br/>
buying it to just sing would be pointless.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I won&#39;t be needing to go to the guild this level.   Is the<br/>
charisma song just really buggy, to the bone, as in not even using the<br/>
proper instrument?  Why else be able to learn wind at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Just so I know, anyone at higher levels ever get it to actually effect shop<br/>
prices?<br/>
