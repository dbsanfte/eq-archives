<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-33199302">I agree Atonal. I mean Kaz, if it was as easy and beneficial as you describe don&#39;t you think a lot<br/>
of Bards would be doing it? There&#39;s a lot of people on this list that have played them for 2+<br/>
years and while very few of us may be &quot;hard-core&quot; gamers, the majority of us can key mash with the<br/>
best of &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious if any of the BOTB competing Bards, especially those that made it a couple rounds,<br/>
have any comments. This would kinda be the acid test. If they, the truly hard-core crowd, twisted<br/>
four or more songs when efficiency, effectiveness and quick thinking were all needed for survival,<br/>
then I would think more seriously about it.<br/>

A macro cannot adjust to a missed note, and becomes a liability in the case&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
of repeated missed notes.&nbsp; I tried it, a while back.&nbsp; You can&#39;t pick up&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
where you missed a note.&nbsp; The social has to start at the beginning again,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
once you manage to stop it, and start it again.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
A macro also cannot change the math (since you like math) involved, in cast&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
times, and duration times.&nbsp; While I haven&#39;t sat down and formulated all the&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
possible combinations (I&#39;d rather spend what little free time I get playing&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
the game), I&#39;m relatively certain that there is no combination of songs that&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
allows for a true, no dropped effects, 5 song twist.&nbsp; You will get dropped&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
effects, and, in my opinion, any &quot;twist&quot; that inherently drops effects, is&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
no twist at all.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Feel free to continue to disagree, however, you can&#39;t change the fact that,&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
if dropped effects don&#39;t matter, then we can all twist 8 songs effortlessly.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>

I haven&#39;t a high enough level bard to test it, but surely writing a macro (a&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
social button) would eliminate most of the complaints you have with twisting&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
four.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
