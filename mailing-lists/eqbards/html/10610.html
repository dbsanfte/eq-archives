&gt; This is the truth. There are a lot of dumb people playing. This morning <br/>
&gt; someone in Lake Rathe was shouting for someone to group with them and go to <br/>
&gt; 1000 island. I shout back &#39;not right now, I&#39;m dressing&#39; (I couldn&#39;t help it, <br/>
&gt; I had just woken up, heh). The next thing I know this person is giving me a <br/>
&gt; tell &#39;so when you&#39;re finished getting dressed do you want to group?&#39; ACK. Me <br/>
&gt; humor was wasted (pathetic attempt though it may have been).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. Speaking of pathetic humour, someone shouted out in Oasis the other<br/>
day &quot;SG buy P1&quot;. I just couldn&#39;t resist shouting back &quot;How much did he<br/>
pay?&quot;<br/>
