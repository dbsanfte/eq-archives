&gt; (and thus blocking other people from getting their shot at<br/>
&gt; DWBs), you&#39;d move on to do something else.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This would require Verant to work on generating enough quests<br/>
&gt; and other interesting things to do so that we wouldn&#39;t run out<br/>
&gt; of things to try to get.  Something they may not be capable of<br/>
&gt; doing.<br/>

50 wearing patchwork and wielding a rusty longsword under a system like<br/>
this. :)<br/>
