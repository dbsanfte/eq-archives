Lots and lots of Warriors on Bertox but very few Bards.  I think I&#39;ve seen<br/>
about a ten or so post-50.<br/>
<br/>
I could see Prophecy doing it *easily*, but if they&#39;re smart, they&#39;ll outfit<br/>
their warriors first.  And before I&#39;m flamed for not supporting my fellow<br/>
Bards... in a group/raid situation, the Warrior quest weapon is going to be<br/>
far more useful than the Singing Short Sword.  Our primary function at those<br/>
events is resists/mana/regen.  When was the last time you saw a Bard wading<br/>
in and delivering the killing blow to Trak? ;)<br/>
<br/>
As weapons go, it&#39;s very nice, but it looks more like a &#39;status symbol&#39; for<br/>
us rather than anything overly useful.</div>
