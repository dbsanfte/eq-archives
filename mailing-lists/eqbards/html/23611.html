<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517872682">Here is some more info.  If you use this mailing list on a purely e-mail<br/>
basis, then nothing needs to be done.  If you use the website though, you&#39;ll<br/>
want to go get your account converted.<br/>

Special Announcement for eGroups Users<br/>
<br/>
Dear eGroups Member,<br/>
<br/>
As you may already know, eGroups merged with Yahoo! in August 2000. We&#39;re<br/>
now proud to announce the launch of Yahoo! Groups, a new service from Yahoo!<br/>
using eGroups technology.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What Happened to eGroups?<br/>
<br/>
All the features you know and love about eGroups have carried over and we&#39;ve<br/>
added some new functionality that we hope you&#39;ll enjoy.<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, all eGroups email and web addresses will continue to work, and<br/>
all of your group information and membership has been maintained.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll soon begin to internationalize Yahoo! Groups. In the interim, you can<br/>
continue to use the international versions of eGroups.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s new on Yahoo! Groups?<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo! Groups has lots of new features and even better customization. You<br/>
can:<br/>
Chat with other group members using our improved Yahoo! Chat<br/>
Add a splash of color to your group, or a main page photo, all without<br/>
knowing HTML<br/>
See when group members are online and communicate with them in real time<br/>
using Yahoo! Messenger<br/>
Reach a larger audience - you will have the entire Yahoo! Network at your<br/>
doorstep<br/>
And much, much more to come!<br/>
The best part -- you don&#39;t have to do anything to convert your group. This<br/>
has all happened automatically. All you have to do to access the wide array<br/>
of web functionality is link your current eGroups account with a Yahoo! ID<br/>
by clicking on the &quot;Convert my eGroups account&quot; link below.<br/>
<br/>
And remember, if you would like to continue using only the email<br/>
capabilities of the service, you won&#39;t need a Yahoo ID. You will continue to<br/>
receive and post mail, just like you always have in the past.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
On behalf of everyone here at Yahoo! Groups, thanks for being a member of<br/>
our service.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
The Yahoo! Groups team<br/>
