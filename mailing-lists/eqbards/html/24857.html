<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-323623262">on the topic of phinny his spawn time is 14 hours.  On our server he dies<br/>
within minutes of being up 99% of the time<br/>
<br/>
Once you figure out when he dies, clock it and be there before he spawns<br/>
again.  Example: we killed him at 9:30-10pm or so last week sometime, he was<br/>
due to be up a around 11:30/noonish the next day, i logged in at about 10 to<br/>
noon and my guildies had allready killed him. while i was there a gnome from<br/>
another guild logged in to check on him (got nuked like hell too).  Another<br/>
time when we just finished killing him i hit tracking and saw a player named<br/>
Phinniechecker (or something like that on track.  So as you can see, its a<br/>
highly competed spawn.  You often see an influx of players running to KK<br/>
about an hour before he&#39;s up.  If one guild fails him, someone will take<br/>
their place to pop him<br/>

Oh I know we can take Phin to the cleaners, the trick is he has to be up<br/>
first! I checked KK several times over the weekend, between RL fun and game<br/>
plans, and he was not up. He&#39;s getting taken down pretty quickly apparently<br/>
on our server. Didn&#39;t make it by Karnors, got sidetracked into a Western<br/>
Wastes romp which resulted in some nice green legs for me. Any excuse to<br/>
avoid an idiot dungeon is good for me! (Idiot dungeon: a dungeon any idiot<br/>
can find, typified by many trains, pointless deaths, and general mayhem;<br/>
specifically: Crushbone, Blackburrow, Karnor&#39;s.)<br/>
