<div id="ygrps-yiv-848705087">Heh, I just read that today too. Playing an SK a lot now so I&#39;m drooling <br/>
over this. The problem is getting the loot (not to mention getting to MM as <br/>
a Human SK)... doubt I&#39;ll be able to afford the price people will be asking <br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have a suspicion this is the lute that also enhances Bard <br/>
skills. It could have a dual-purpose, some other items do.<br/>
<br/>
Any bards on Zek wanna sell me that lute? :- )<br/>

Found this on a spoiler site.  The lute is part of a quest,<br/>
and thus unlikely to ever enhance our songs:</div>
