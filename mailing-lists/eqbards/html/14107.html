<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346131986">Ahh, the Ykesha trade was with a level 50 cleric friend. His girlfriend was<br/>
starting a bard and he wanted to twink her. Seeing as he has an fbss, yaks<br/>
etc in the bank he said he&#39;d give me a Yak for a full suit of Lambent.<br/>
<br/>
The total deal was actually, Ykesha and 1230pp for Full Lambent and a<br/>
Golden BP Choker. So I even had cash to cover the cost of gems.<br/>

 Heh extremly good deal on both acounts. You really got a Yak for only a<br/>
full suite of Lambent? I&#39;m impressed. The runed falchion goes for 3k pp on<br/>
E&#39;ci roughly so you got off good on both acounts.<br/>

&gt;Over the weekend I got a Ykesha, traded all my Lambent for it and then<br/>
&gt;replaced all my Lambent with all the quest items I had collected over the<br/>
&gt;last week. All my hard work paid off and now I am wielding this fine<br/>
 </span></blockquote>weapon<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(even though it don&#39;t proc yet, level 37 isn&#39;t it?).<br/>
&gt;Also today I picked up a Runed Falchion for 1500pp, Obsidian Scim and a<br/>
&gt;Foreman Tunic. Was this a good deal?<br/>
