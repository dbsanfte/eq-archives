<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364752784">Heh EQ is the easiest game ever. It isn&#39;t tough it just requires ton and<br/>
tons of time and what your suggesting is going to require more time.  Look<br/>
at PoF they went and made the drops rare now so you have to spend days<br/>
camping for armor.  I just think your asking for too much with item decay.<br/>

&gt;Obviously you don&#39;t have to camp for gear in Diablo.  If people don&#39;t watch<br/>
&gt;their inventory and repair their gear and then lose the item that they may<br/>
&gt;have spent many, many hours camping...ouch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have heard different stories about the hell levels.  Supposedly Verant<br/>
&gt;&#39;accidentally put this code into the game?  And then decided to leave it<br/>
&gt;there as a feature?  Hard to believe.  Even harder to believe given Brad<br/>
&gt;McQuaid&#39;s past statements. One thing McQuaid has said..and I have probably<br/>
&gt;repeated here..is that he &quot;never said it would be an easy game&quot;.  Of the 3<br/>
&gt;major MMORPGs (EQ, UO, AC) Everquest is probably the most difficult and the<br/>
&gt;most unforgiving for player mistakes.<br/>

&gt;&gt; The only problem with this though is with items like jboots or quest<br/>
&gt;items.<br/>
&gt;&gt; People who camped drelzna for hours upon hours or the new Ancient Cyclops<br/>
&gt;&gt; are going to be very pissed when that item dissapears. Overall it&#39;s just<br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;&gt; worth it because it&#39;s going to cause people to put more time in this game<br/>
&gt;&gt; something Verant try&#39;s it&#39;s best to do.  Speaking of did you know<br/>
&gt;according<br/>
&gt;&gt; to Verant hell levels are a feature?<br/>
