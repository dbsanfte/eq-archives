<b>Subject:</b> Going after the Mistmoor drum <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759350825">Well after a binge of pursuing crafted armour for our warrior, she decided<br/>
we should go after a mistmoore drum for myself and another bard. To bring to<br/>
the party we have:<br/>
<br/>
Druid 29<br/>
Warrior 28<br/>
Thief 28 (I think)<br/>
Cleric 26<br/>
Wizard 26<br/>
Bard 26<br/>
Bard 24 (me :o)<br/>
<br/>
And maybe a few well wishers, possibly high level, just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Our general strategy so far:<br/>
<br/>
Camp at graveyard waiting for trains coming from the secret door (I haven&#39;t<br/>
been there this is all blind talk based on suggestions) when the train<br/>
happens look for the named gypsie with the pet. I will be singing<br/>
guardian/elemeal at a minimum, as well as other magic resist buffs. Nuke the<br/>
gypsy, loot and zone.<br/>
My question for folks who have done it is, in your opinion, do we stand a<br/>
chance at ALL? Hints, suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin, who isn&#39;t confused that they just want to make their<br/>
errand boy run faster.</div>
