<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053828643">Hawkeye is completely right.  I started a character and put 20 points into<br/>
dex and 5 points into strength.  By level 8 I was sick of having to go back<br/>
and sell so often so I started over and put all my points into strength.  At<br/>
first I wasn&#39;t sure it was a good idea because I seemed to be missing a lot<br/>
of notes but now at level 12 I rarely ever miss a note.  I think putting it<br/>
all into strength is the way to go.  Having a 100 strength comes in handy.<br/>
