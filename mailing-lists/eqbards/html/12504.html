&gt; Tips on leveling faster:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Running around trying to find best xp, or something new and exciting to kill<br/>
&gt; is horrible to do, if you want to level fast, kill the stuff you know.<br/>
&gt; However, if the stuff you know is too camped, it might be necessary<br/>
&gt; to find something new.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say the best way to level quickly without having a<br/>
high level person help you is to know what mobs give the best<br/>
experience for a given level.  Unfortunately, you won&#39;t learn<br/>
that if you just kill stuff you know.  (Not to mention it&#39;s<br/>
likely to be really boring.)<br/>
<br/>
e.g. Low level goblins (minus the casters) in Butcherblock are<br/>
notoriously weak for their /con.  The casters are weak for<br/>
their /con too, but (correctly) /con several levels higher<br/>
than the melee goblins.  (This AFAIK is the only mob where<br/>
/con between melee and caster correctly corresponds to<br/>
danger.)  All those people running around Crushbone trying to<br/>
kill the low level orcs are wasting their time needlessly<br/>
dying to high level orc trains.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is, if you can&#39;t get a high level person to<br/>
directly help you, ask for his advice on what to hunt.  Note<br/>
that this is one area where people who&#39;ve played/twinked<br/>
multiple characters have an advantage, having been through the<br/>
lower levels several times.<br/>
