<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822882029">The post made it clear that what our guild was doing on Aviak Isle could be<br/>
thrown out the window though.  We were killing all the available birds on<br/>
the Isle, though not excluding others from joining in, in the hopes of<br/>
spawning Gull and Soarin for the 2 clerics and 2 shamans in our group.  By<br/>
the rules as stated by Caltin, if another group came along they could demand<br/>
that we ignore one of those two named spawns when he appeared and share him<br/>
with them even if he spawned near us first.  That&#39;s certainly the impression<br/>
I get from the posts there and that we would be eld especially accountable<br/>
because we were a guild.<br/>

That&#39;s silly.  On Fennin Ro (crowded as hell) the King/Priest/Champ are all<br/>
three different groups.  Always.  The fact that a group came in and started<br/>
camping the Priest when the Champ room felt like King/Priest/Champ were all<br/>
theirs are simply wrong.  This would *never* fly on Fennin Ro.<br/>
<br/>
Now on Druzzil Ro, with the Sol B population at 20 or 30, sometimes the<br/>
King/Priest/Champ is all one camp, but having come from Fennin, no one is<br/>
shocked when others come in and set up camp.  Normally a King/Priest/Champ<br/>
group will base itself in the King room so that is this happens they still<br/>
get the primo camp.<br/>
