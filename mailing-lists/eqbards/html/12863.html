<div id="ygrps-yiv-591459899">1.  Yes bard duties overlap alot, but there are plenty<br/>
of songs that we can play that do stack with others<br/>
buffs.  Anthem stacks with the enchanters speed spell<br/>
(speed doesn&#39;t stack but the strength buff does).  We<br/>
can play psalm of warmth that has a damage shield that<br/>
stacks with others damage shields.  We can chain which<br/>
not only snares but slows down the attack.  Heal<br/>
stacks, clarity stacks.  So we still offer plenty to a<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Frankly at around level 30 I don&#39;t want the<br/>
attention that an area effect spell brings me.  I will<br/>
sometimes play largo&#39;s but not with a pull of more<br/>
than 2 mobs.  If there was an enchanter I would<br/>
probably use it more.  I never use ae damage spells. <br/>
That spells dead bard in my book.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  Not sure I understand completely what you are<br/>
talking about casting trolls.  Anyway, if you need to<br/>
bring up invis to save the group from a train I think<br/>
it is a small price to pay in killing an enchanters<br/>
pet.  Big deal.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Most likely these jackass enchanters are<br/>
powergaming idiots from other servers who saw the<br/>
power of an enchanter and decided to be one on your<br/>
new server.  Now it is frustrating sometimes trying to<br/>
offer tips on crowd control being a bard or enchanter.<br/>
 Sometimes I have groups that don&#39;t listen  Everyone<br/>
engages a different mob--making it a hell of alot<br/>
harder to take out 4 or more mobs.  You say &quot;assist so<br/>
and so&quot; and they never listen.  Usually in those cases<br/>
I just forget about crowd control even though it would<br/>
be alot nicer.  Some people just don&#39;t understand.  It<br/>
is important to point out what an enchanter is doing<br/>
because most people have no clue--they think the group<br/>
just rocked when it was the enchanter or bard that<br/>
gave them a chance.  If they were saying &quot;doodz&quot; and<br/>
stuff like that though I would be irritated.  <br/>

&gt; Subject: Enchanters vs Bards<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello all!  I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, and<br/>
&gt; thought I&#39;d post on a<br/>
&gt; subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the<br/>
&gt; incompatability of enchanters and<br/>
&gt; bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game<br/>
&gt; that work together as<br/>
&gt; poorly as these two?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem 1: Overlapping duties.  Many Bard tasks can<br/>
&gt; be done better by<br/>
&gt; Enchanters.  Crowd control, buffs, and mana regen<br/>
&gt; are the big three.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem 2: Enchanters make Bard AoE songs more or<br/>
&gt; less useless.  Since so many<br/>
&gt; of our songs are AoE, our playlist is more limited<br/>
&gt; than a Los Angeles Top 40<br/>
&gt; FM station when grouping with an enchanter.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; just learned on this list<br/>
&gt; that Largo does NOT wake up mezzed mobs, so I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; adding that back into my<br/>
&gt; &quot;Enchanter Hotkey&quot; bank.  That&#39;s good news.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem 3: Bard invis song kills Enchanter pets /<br/>
&gt; breaks charm.  Yeah, this is<br/>
&gt; really the Bard&#39;s fault if they do this, and it can<br/>
&gt; happen with other pet and<br/>
&gt; charm classes too.  However, there is a unique<br/>
&gt; problem with Enchanters.  The<br/>
&gt; other night I got into a group in Unrest by the<br/>
&gt; fountains.  One of the group<br/>
&gt; members was a casting Troll.  &quot;Shaman,&quot; I thought to<br/>
&gt; myself.  Suddenly, a<br/>
&gt; typical Unrest train comes roaring by bearing half<br/>
&gt; the house.  I kick in the<br/>
&gt; invis song to protect the group when the message<br/>
&gt; &quot;Gebaner slashes itself for<br/>
&gt; 32000 points of damage&quot; pops up, followed by a<br/>
&gt; severe reaming from the<br/>
&gt; Enchanter who was in troll form.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Problem 4: For some reason, most Enchanters I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; grouped with are total<br/>
&gt; jackasses.  They are constantly barking orders<br/>
&gt; (usually in all caps) and<br/>
&gt; yelling at everybody.  It&#39;s very rare for Enchanters<br/>
&gt; to give instructions ina<br/>
&gt; polite fashion, like &quot;Hey guys, please assist the<br/>
&gt; puller so I can mez the<br/>
&gt; other mobs.&quot;  They are always self-congratualtory<br/>
&gt; (&quot;Heh heh my ae mez rockz,<br/>
&gt; dOOd!&quot;) and showing off (&quot;Look, I&#39;m a table, d00dz!&quot;<br/>
&gt; followed 1 minute later<br/>
&gt; by &quot;OOM&quot;).  They seem to be surly most of the time,<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t imagine them<br/>
&gt; having any fun with all their gripes.  And oh, if<br/>
&gt; something goes wrong in<br/>
&gt; battle, it&#39;s NEVER their fault.  They point fingers<br/>
&gt; all the time.  It&#39;s very<br/>
&gt; rare for an enchanter to say &quot;Sorry guys, I mezzed<br/>
&gt; the wrong mob.&quot;  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; usually &quot;My Mez wore off that mob!!!  Somebody must<br/>
&gt; have attacked it!  Idiots!<br/>
&gt; It was probably one of those retarded bard songs!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, Enchanters are a great class. <br/>
&gt; They can enable any group<br/>
&gt; to handle mobs that would be unattainable otherwise.<br/>
&gt;  And there are some good<br/>
&gt; apples in the bunch who can play their role well<br/>
&gt; without being a jerk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anybody have any tips on how a Bard and Enchanter<br/>
&gt; can group together<br/>
&gt; successfully and work with each other rather<br/>
&gt; against?  Right now, whenever an<br/>
&gt; enchanter is in my group, I feel like an<br/>
&gt; underpowered tank, which is not a fun<br/>
&gt; role to play.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
