<div id="ygrps-yiv-119152793">Yeah last night all I got was &quot;Hey, how come we haven&#39;t lost that Giant yet?<br/>
Did you forget to equip your drum again?  Are you still awake over there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I was not amused.<br/>

Last nights convo while group travelling:<br/>
<br/>
/g Uugh...this is ponderous.<br/>
Groupie says, &quot;Wha?  This is like, 2.5x faster than usual!&quot;<br/>
/g Uugh...you just don&#39;t know...<br/>
/sigh<br/>
Groupie says, &quot;You can&#39;t be that much faster...not at your level.&quot;<br/>
/rofl (at %T)<br/>
(there is a pause)<br/>
Groupie says, &quot;Are you...?&quot;<br/>
/g After the patch, you and I will go for a run around LOIO...then you tell<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm...was a little funnier as it happened...heh.  Oh well..you get the idea.<br/>
It&#39;s a slow day at work, don&#39;t blame me!  :)<br/>

Nothing was more depressing than last night with my cleric twink in SK <br/>
Penthouse...  We had a bard with us that ended up getting aggroed on from <br/>
birds below.  Of course you can&#39;t attack them but they can certainly attack <br/>
you.  So he decides to run to the zone.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t make it.  His drum was useless.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know HOW to travel with my bard without trusting in our <br/>
blinding speed.  &quot;OK, we&#39;re going to just run through this zone, do not stop<br/>
<br/>
if attacked, just keep going.  We can outrun anything.&quot;<br/>

&gt;There is nothing more ponderous than a High Elf cleric in full<br/>
&gt;bronze...except maybe a bard with broken drums...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ponderous...ponderous...<br/>
