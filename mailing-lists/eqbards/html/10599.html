<b>Subject:</b> Hunting griffennes in NK... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864177804">Here is a tip which was posted on this list a while ago (wish I could remember who posted it,) and I thought it was worth mentioning again. (I know it REALLY helped me when I was trying to get my bracers.)<br/>
<br/>
Along the Northern wall of NK, there is a hill with a column. This is near the named treant, and in the area where the werewolf hunters roam. Anyway, a griffenne or a griffawn will spawn there once every 8 minutes, and I camped the area no more than an hour and a half for each bracelet. Anyway, if you are on Xegony and need the /loc give me a yell in game (I have it written down at home.)<br/>

Safe hunting...<br/>
