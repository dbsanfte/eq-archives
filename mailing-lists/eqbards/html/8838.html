<b>Subject:</b> Lullaby nerfed too?  (was Charm) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407044164">This happened to me in Permafrost over the weekend.  I had just zoned in and<br/>
a group was at the zone border fighting 5-6 ice goblins.  I starting singing<br/>
lullaby with lute equipped.  I was not attacking any of the mobs.  With one<br/>
or two exceptions for the entire fight, every time the song pulsed every<br/>
goblin was put to sleep.  I confirmed with their group leader that the party<br/>
was concentrating on one mob.  In theory, the others should have just stood<br/>
there doing nothing.  Instead, often 2-3 mobs would attack me even though no<br/>
one was attacking them.  If the lullaby affected them, it only lasted for a<br/>
microsecond.  <br/>
