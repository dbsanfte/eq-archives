&gt;Question:  could you have un-charmed him with a pumice stone? (casts <br/>
&gt;nullify<br/>
&gt;magic)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So far I&#39;ve never been able to get my pumice stone to work on anything but <br/>
myself.  If I target either another player or an NPC nothing happens. When I <br/>
target myself it works like a champ!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, has anyone remembered to mem the broken cancel magic song <br/>
to see if it was really fixed? I remembered to do it once, but couldn&#39;t get <br/>
my cleric friend to wait for me to mem it. He cast dispell on himself before <br/>
I had a chance to try it out, the ungrateful lout!!<br/>
