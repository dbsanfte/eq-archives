 </span></blockquote>Funny you should say that.  I thought the same thing when I<br/>
first heard the sound effects too (the music is pretty good<br/>
too with a wavetable soundcard).  Then last week I bought a<br/>
set of profession studio monitor headphones for a keyboard I&#39;m<br/>
buying.  Plugged it into the computer, played EQ - the sounds<br/>
were so obviously fake :) that within 5 minutes I&#39;d gone back<br/>
to the speakers (they muffle the sound enough to where the<br/>
fakeness isn&#39;t so obvious).<br/>
<br/>
The sound effects are really good, but there&#39;s still a lot of<br/>
room for improvement.<br/>
