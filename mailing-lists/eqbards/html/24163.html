enough for you to get down below 2 bubbles, you will require 0 heals, since for<br/>
the rest of the fight, you can twist hymn/nivs/XXXXX and regen all that health<br/>
for &#39;&#39;free&#39;&#39; (free for me, since that is my normal twist in a group where the enchanter<br/>
isn&#39;t good enough to deal with me charming).</div>
