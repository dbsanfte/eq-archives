<div id="ygrps-yiv-12564733">I find this uninformed. We are perhaps the most versatile class in the<br/>
game. People that can find nothing but faults in their class make me<br/>
think one thought - you are playing the wrong class. We have so many<br/>
ways at our disposal to do almost anything, it&#39;s truely terrifying. <br/>
<br/>
Dodge is capped at 125 for a reason - a bard is not a tank. This is also<br/>
why we don&#39;t get bash, parry, or double attack. When dodge caps at L24<br/>
you already should have begun occupying roles in your party other than<br/>
tank. Just look at how a bard solo&#39;s in the 40+ range to see how true<br/>
this is. Do you tank a blue or higher monster to kill it? of course not.<br/>
You use charm or chains and fear as two possible options.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t able to effective employ Lullaby, or it seems ineffectual,<br/>
ask constructively how others use it in this forum. Personally when I<br/>
solo, if there is any chance I&#39;ll fight a caster, Lullaby is memm&#39;d. It<br/>
may very well be mem&#39;d while I am grouped as well. There is nothing like<br/>
repeatedly interrupting a jin frogluk shaman attempting to cast heal to<br/>
make your group immediately value your presence. Pixie chase not useful?<br/>
i&#39;ve watched a bard hold a bok ghoul knight in place for 2 minutes while<br/>
the other 5 in the group fought and killed a second bok and the ghoul<br/>
lord. Many of our songs at the level we get them are very weak, but<br/>
unlike most classes, whose spells have damage caps, our songs continue<br/>
to increase in power without limit. A L50 Bard is truely one of the most<br/>
formidable and broad-spectrumed options to play.<br/>

P.S. The ill-effect on bards produced by levitation was reported as a<br/>
bug, it will be corrected next patch.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there any interest among those on this list in an organized protest of<br/>
&gt; our class&#39; mistreatment by Verant?  How many songs must become bugged, how<br/>
&gt; many times must we be nerfed, how much longer must we stand under the<br/>
&gt; oppressive weight of the man...  Ooops, sorry got carried away there.  But<br/>
&gt; seriously, we have several unimplemented songs (you all know the numbers),<br/>
&gt; several songs which suffer from bugs that render them of limited value<br/>
&gt; (Lullaby, Pixie Strike), and several other abilities which are either capped<br/>
&gt; too low (Dodge at least) or outright have no value (Find Traps at the least)<br/>
&gt; that we deserve attention.<br/>
