<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516440190">Well, I was at the Cazic-Thule bazaar last saturday and a pair of EH gloves<br/>
went for 375 plat. So by my reckoning a dozen set of gloves is 4500 plat!<br/>

&gt; the elf hide gloves are a joke, my buddy been camping the warden on sol ro<br/>
&gt; for a couple nights for a belt and has gotten 0 belts so far and about a<br/>
&gt; dozen sets of gloves, which he then proceeds to give to newbie<br/>
bards/rogues<br/>
&gt; most of the time. of all the nights he camped him he&#39;s killed well over 15<br/>
&gt; wardens. try to get a claw or a belt (good luck).<br/>
