&gt; That&#39;s a good word.  Anyone who&#39;s spoken English for any amount of time<br/>
&gt; should intuitively know what you mean.  Picking terminology is far more<br/>
&gt; important and difficult than most people realize, bit ultimately if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; think about the origins of words just a little it becomes waaaaay easier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, &quot;mob&quot; is technically more accurate.  It refers to any<br/>
mobile entity that is controlled by the server.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
there&#39;s an English word for not-a-PC.  &quot;NPC&quot; is often used to<br/>
mean only humanoids, and &quot;monster&quot; or &quot;critter&quot; is often used<br/>
to mean non-humanoid NPCs.  When you say &quot;mob&quot; then it&#39;s<br/>
obvious (at least to the programmer geeks) that you mean both<br/>
&quot;NPCs and critters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Besides, it&#39;s quicker to type &quot;mob&quot; than &quot;critter.&quot;  Saves you<br/>
four keystrokes you can use later for button mashing in EQ.<br/>

<br/>
And Bellow goes up a point in damage every other level or so.<br/>
I&#39;m curioius though why you&#39;re finding it does 7 points when<br/>
you&#39;ve just gotten it.  If I recall correctly, it only did 5<br/>
points max when I got it.  Maybe wood elves have smaller<br/>
lungs?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing with Dissonance and Discord lately, and if<br/>
you&#39;re in a place where area effect songs can be used, these<br/>
two are probably much more effective than Bellow (e.g. Anthem<br/>
Discord Dissonance as opposed to Anthem Bellow Bellow).<br/>
Discord with a horn is pretty scary actually - I&#39;m<br/>
reconsidering whether I should lullaby trains, or just kill<br/>
them faster with this song.  And it is really funny to see a<br/>
monster you&#39;ve never hit start to flee from you, then drop<br/>
dead.  :-)<br/>
