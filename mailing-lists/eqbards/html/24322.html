<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116594130">well the short answer is don&#39;t bother, the song is a serious waste of a<br/>
memmed slot.  it can drop off lots of different things, like dragons in<br/>
Western Wastes.  i really wouldn&#39;t pay much for it, since you will likely<br/>
never use it unless it is changed in some way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I took a break from EQ just before SoV came out and I just recently <br/>
&gt; started playing a lot again.  Well, during the break I was a little <br/>
&gt; out of the loop so I have a couple of questions regarding this song.  <br/>
&gt; First off, I know that this is a mob dropped spell in Velious.  What <br/>
&gt; zones/mobs is it most commonly found on?  And... What are people <br/>
&gt; paying/charging for this song?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please help, thanks ;)<br/>
