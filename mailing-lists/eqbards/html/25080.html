<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493429502">Since you didn&#39;t give any specifics, I&#39;ll point out the 2 most likely<br/>
culprits of your lockup problem.  Please forgive if I hit on what you&#39;ve<br/>
already tried.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Heat.  Overclocking at those speeds require a heavy duty heatsink/fan<br/>
combo.  I have a Globalwin FOP-38 on my 1Ghz Thunderbird running at 1.1Ghz.<br/>
At load, processor temperature hovers around 145 - 150 degrees F.  Just as a<br/>
neato fact - an uncooled Tbird will burn up in 8 seconds with no cooling.<br/>
Heat is no joke.  Add a new video card into the case, like a Geforce that<br/>
also requires heatsinks and fans, and that&#39;s a ton of heat in the case.  A<br/>
properly cooled case is also a must.  Cool air in the front bottom and out<br/>
the top rear.  Cables bunched up in the middle of the airflow alone could<br/>
add 2-6 degrees, or even more to the overall case temp.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Overclocking methodology.  Every machine is different, and will not<br/>
clock as fast as even an identical machine.  It is a slow process.  The<br/>
details are beyond the scope of this email, but it consists of making a<br/>
small increase, followed by full load testing, until the system is unstable,<br/>
and then backing off just a little.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I kinda feel like I&#39;m pushing the off topic tolerance here a bit with<br/>
these essays (heh), again, email me directly, and I&#39;ll steer you to what is,<br/>
IMHO, the best OC site.  The forums are the best I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>

Both pc&#39;s I&#39;ve tried overclocking have caused problems w/ Everquest.  PIII<br/>
600 overclocked to 800mhz, locks up after any 8 minutes in old world zones,<br/>
any 3 minutes in Kunark, never tried w/ velious. AMD hrm...I think it was a<br/>
500 clocked to 675 or 700 or so...would lock up on ANY direct3d<br/>
input/output.  Worked great if I never accessed anything using directx,<br/>
though.<br/>
