me tells saying they had some Singing Steel boots for me if I still <br/>
needed them.<br/>
<br/>
I would never join a guild for the sole reason of getting nice items <br/>
for free.  I have nothing against people helping other people out, <br/>
but I believe there&#39;s a lot to be said for being able to acquire my <br/>
equipment by my own means.  Singing Steel Boots aside (which I <br/>
mentioned I received as a gift), the only other item I have which I <br/>
did not a) loot, b) buy, or c) trade for myself is an EB BP and I <br/>
feel I&#39;ve been pretty well equipped throughout the life of my Bard.  <br/>
When I received the BP as a wedding present, I was capable of gaining <br/>
it myself by a), b) or c).<br/>
<br/>
I see my guild more as a means to help me get to the places to <br/>
acquire equipment rather than a guild that will take all of the work <br/>
out of it.  I don&#39;t mind twinking (my level 10 Shaman has almost full <br/>
Totemic), but I still take some pride in having acquired that <br/>
equipment myself in another character.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen and heard of far too many guilds, for my taste, where <br/>
people join for the sole purpose of getting twinked.  Level 10 <br/>
characters join and demand &quot;phat lewt&quot; or they threaten to quit.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m more of a &quot;loner&quot; or maybe, even tho I have given away many <br/>
items to people, I don&#39;t want to feel obligated to reciprocate every <br/>
time I get something of value on my own.  But, whichever reason, I&#39;d <br/>
definitely prefer to purchase, trade, or loot the Singing Steel <br/>
Gaunts on my own.<br/>
