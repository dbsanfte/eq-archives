&gt;I saw someone mention Guk as a good place to hunt. For the levels infered, <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;assume Upper Guk was meant. If you have hunted the live frogluks in Upper<br/>
&gt;Guk and have gotten bad factions with them, you now have a real problem<br/>
&gt;getting into Lower Guk at higher levels. You must cross Upper Guk to access<br/>
&gt;lower Guk for the undead frogluks (and all the really cool goodies down<br/>
&gt;there, like did you ever want to be a dark elf bard?) once you get into the<br/>
&gt;30&#39;s levels.<br/>
&gt;Our take on upper guk is that it was intented as a evil races dungeon<br/>
&gt;primarily since they are born with bad live frogluk factions. A person in<br/>
&gt;our guild has that problem and he has to get someone to invis him to get in<br/>
&gt;and out, everytime. This sounds simple til you start counting deaths also.<br/>
&gt;The only people who must kill live frogs are the hapless paladins, if they<br/>
&gt;want to get one of their holy swords, the Ghoulsbane. How do I know this? <br/>
&gt;My<br/>
&gt;husband is a L40+ paladin and lives in lower Guk after painstakingly<br/>
&gt;doctoring his factions thru getting a ghoulsbane. I do see others in game<br/>
&gt;hunting there and the few I have talked to had no idea that lower guk<br/>
&gt;existed. This is so far the only split dungeon we have found. So think very<br/>
&gt;hard before you hunt upper guk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think Solusek&#39;s Eye is also a split dungeon, because the two zones were <br/>
called solusekA and solusekB. I thik Verant recently renamed B to something <br/>
else (I forget). Everyone thought it was a brand new zone, but it was just a <br/>
name change on an old zone. SolusekB is supposed to be pretty much like <br/>
Lower Guk as far as difficulty.<br/>
