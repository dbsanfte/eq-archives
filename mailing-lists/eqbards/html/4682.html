<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941963975">What&#39;s going on here is that you cannot &quot;see&quot; her.  If you tried hailing her<br/>
in front of the counter you would only say Hail.  Around behind it with her,<br/>
you would hail her with her name.  Everything in the Unrest house targeted<br/>
and killed me in three seconds one night, through floor, wall and<br/>
ceiling--yet I can&#39;t even say hello to somebody behind a counter!<br/>

&gt;Then, I walked AROUND the counter to stand directly in front of the npc and<br/>
&gt;tried again and they became Amiable! </span></blockquote></div>
