<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446214120">OK, kind of on topic, kind of off topic...But I&#39;ll word it as best I can for<br/>
on-topic! :-)<br/>
<br/>
In what way does a high DEX help a Bard?<br/>
<br/>
I currently have something like a 125 or so in DEX...(Who me? Own DEX<br/>
boosting items? Naw.....) Actually, I dumped as many of my starting points<br/>
into DEX as I could, and then added 2 Cutthroat Rings, Snakeskin Gloves, and<br/>
a Dragoon Dirk....<br/>
<br/>
What skills are made better by high DEX? Does this affect my AC any? (I<br/>
wondered if it did though, because I bought 2 Brass Earrings, rated at 2AC<br/>
each, and when I put them on, they actually gave me a total of 7AC<br/>
increase...)<br/>
<br/>
I beleive that I read somewhere that Mana for Bard&#39;s is DEX/CHA based...Is<br/>
this correct?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
