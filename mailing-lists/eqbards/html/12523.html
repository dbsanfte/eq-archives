<div id="ygrps-yiv-306843717">I&#39;ve yet to come to a conclusion on whether Clarity is no taunt or very<br/>
very low taunt. It&#39;s obviously nothing compared to a song like Verses of<br/>
Victory or Hymn of Restoration. I&#39;ve had planes pulls come in while mana<br/>
regen was being played that walked passed me. I can&#39;t recall ever being<br/>
mobbed for only playing that song. If I go afk, even if a pull might be<br/>
coming in, I&#39;ll leave mana regen playing for the fight, so I&#39;m not sure<br/>
if it&#39;s just a matter of someone else having a higher aggro factor in<br/>
the room than me or what.<br/>

&gt; dunno if i thought about it or just did it instinctively, but like you<br/>
&gt; said<br/>
&gt; i don&#39;t play any buffs during pulls.  i play mana song all the way til<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; pull is in, then i start up with buffs.  pretty sure mana song is no<br/>
&gt; taunt,<br/>
&gt; right?<br/>
