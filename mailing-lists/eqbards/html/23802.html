<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164303426">I&#39;ve only tried it solo to powerlevel people. However, I have &quot;protected&quot; <br/>
my kills from kill stealers by charming and then killing a mob (and getting <br/>
the exp) which means it wiped out the record of their damage done to the <br/>
mob. And I&#39;m sure that they had done more damage to the mob than me before <br/>
I charmed it (druid and a wizzie).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps one of your other party members had a DOT on the creature that did <br/>
more damage after the charm than the 20&#39;ish druid could have done?<br/>

&gt;Worked for me about a week ago. Was travelling through, saw a solo&#39;er in<br/>
&gt;trouble fighting 2 mobs, hacked the extra down to less than a bubble,<br/>
&gt;charmed it and had him kill it and he got the exp.<br/>
