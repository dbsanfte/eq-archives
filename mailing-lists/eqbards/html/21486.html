<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379744573">/cheer I noticed this as well. Kind of strange that we beat upon it like a <br/>
drum. /shrug<br/>
<br/>
Also I&#39;ve noticed in Rathe Mtns, that the hill giants now start to run when <br/>
they are low on health. Makes it a little easier to ensure that we are <br/>
charming the victor.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, has anyone noticed a difference in our running style? It seems to <br/>
me that it has smoothed out, but since I was bumping up and down in the <br/>
swamp, I couldn&#39;t be certain. Just interested if anyone else noticed a <br/>
difference.<br/>
