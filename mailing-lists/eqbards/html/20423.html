<div id="ygrps-yiv-108498431">Ugh, that just happened to me last night. We were cruising through Kaesora, <br/>
got a real bad pull, I looked mournfully where my screech would be (swapped <br/>
it out for more magic resistance) and watched us all get slaughtered.<br/>

&gt;Screech has a permanent spot in my song bank :)  Perm songs that NEVER get<br/>
&gt;un-memmed<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Charm/Bravura (they get swapped depending on what area I&#39;m in, sometimes ya<br/>
&gt;just don&#39;t NEED da manahog)<br/>
&gt;Screech<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Hymn used to, lately it&#39;s been coming out sometimes though)<br/>
&gt;(Clarity is almost always in but will get taken out if no casters in group<br/>
&gt;**RARE** or I&#39;m soloing)<br/>
&gt;All others are subject to change on a moment-moment basis.  But those two up<br/>
&gt;top are NEVER un-memmed (and lately I&#39;ve just been leaving Bravura in)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fear is just too damn useful (as is charm) to risk un-memming it.  The one<br/>
&gt;time you remove it is going to be the time you need it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; More uses:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Crowd control:  Pull mob to the side, chain, fear, chain, go back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting while the mob wanders around a bit.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In the Lake of Ill Omen if you accidently get multis while soloing you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; fear  them,only chaining one and finish the chained one off while the<br/>
&gt;others<br/>
&gt; &gt; wander (sometimes it takes two tries to get them lost). Sit and heal, then<br/>
&gt; &gt; wander around a bit until one of the others finds you. If you get more<br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt; &gt; one back, repeat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a side benefit, if one of them was a sarnak he will often pass you on<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; allll the other sarnaks, and you will get faction hits for the rest of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; night (assuming the fort is under siege). I know what you are thinking,<br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I never got a train back from this strategy.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Save party:  Evac&#39;er needs time to cast:  AE FEAR  gate goes off, no<br/>
&gt;train<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oohhh, the times this has saved my group&#39;s butt, and oooh the times I<br/>
&gt;needed<br/>
&gt; &gt; it and my last thought before dying was &#39;screech isn&#39;t memmed&quot;...I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty much decided that if there is a need for an evacer then there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; need to have screech and a horn ready.<br/>
