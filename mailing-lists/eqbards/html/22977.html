&gt; Prior to yesterday&#39;s patch, if you had Selos running, and then you got<br/>
&gt; rooted, the next time Selos refreshed it would break the root (which I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure everyone was already aware of).  For this reason alone, bards were<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; best class for pulling in PoG.  Now if you get rooted, your stuck in place<br/>
&gt; until roots wears off or until you cancel magic it away.  This change is<br/>
&gt; contrary to what GZ stated a long time ago on how the song was intended to<br/>
&gt; work.  I only assume that whoever replaced GZ as spell system designer was<br/>
&gt; not aware of this.<br/>

&gt; 1) I remember that and wasn&#39;t surprised when this change went in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Selo&#39;s got nerfed other than the percussion thing?  How so?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is not the first time there has been an issue with Selos breaking<br/>
root.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For all of you old-timers, do you remember back in spring/summer of 1999<br/>
&gt; when a patch went in that made it where Selos would not break root?  The<br/>
&gt; patch went in, there was a public outcry, and a few days later the<br/>
decision<br/>
&gt; was reversed and Selos was working the way it did when the game was first<br/>
&gt; released, i.e. it broke root. Geoffrey Zatkin at one point even publically<br/>
&gt; stated that Selos breaking root was &quot;working as intended&quot; and not a bug.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone else remember that far back?  I&#39;d also like to know where we<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; find GZ&#39;s statement (if it is still archived somewhere).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW who wants to bet with me that the reason Selos got nerfed (not<br/>
referring<br/>
&gt; to the drum bug) is because Verant discovered uberguilds were using bards<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; safely pull in the PoG?<br/>
