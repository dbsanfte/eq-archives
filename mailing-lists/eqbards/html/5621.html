&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you need to stop and restart this song repeatedly<br/>
&gt; or are you leaving it on?  I twice failed in my<br/>
&gt; attempts to use this for myself running out in Guk:<br/>
&gt; once the Shin Lord room (tal shaman on me) and once<br/>
&gt; the prison (warden on me), although I came very very<br/>
&gt; close the second time.  Is it best to stand still<br/>
&gt; during the first screech to evaluate the<br/>
&gt; effectiveness?  Or just high-tail it whilst jamming<br/>
&gt; the screech button?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I pretty much left it on unless I was bashed out of the song.<br/>
Now that you mention it, I *was* standing still most of the<br/>
time it pulsed.  At first it was to stop to type to my friends<br/>
&quot;Where are you?&quot;  But later after I realized I was taking very<br/>
little damage, it was to stop and turn around and see how many<br/>
frogs I could chase away with each pulse.<br/>
<br/>
Once I&#39;d scared them off, I started running and turned the<br/>
song off so as not to activate any of the green frogs I passed<br/>
on the way up.  When the main group of frogs caught up to me,<br/>
I just fired up the song again - don&#39;t remember if I was<br/>
running or standing still then.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t tried screech in Cazic.  I&#39;d mostly put the song<br/>
away and have only recently started playing with it again<br/>
after using it to Chain/fear a griffin during a wild, drunken<br/>
guild party.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; More general: please share more get-out-of death<br/>
&gt; strategies.  I die a lot (ouch, hehe) as I&#39;m sure many<br/>
&gt; bards do because of the taunt effect of many of our<br/>
&gt; songs, especially in indoor dungeons.  Screech is one<br/>
&gt; strategy.  Would pixie striking help?  Lullaby?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lullaby can be used to the same effect, but Screech is usually<br/>
better since when the effect finally wears off, the mob is<br/>
twice as far since it has been running away from you instead<br/>
of standing in one spot.  Pixie Strike is single target - if<br/>
you can get Strike to stick, you&#39;re probably better off<br/>
killing the mob instead of fighting it.  OTOH, if you have an<br/>
enchanter, mesmerize is good for retreats since 95% of the<br/>
time it also does a memory blur and the mob will forget all<br/>
about you if you&#39;re out of range.  Of course, to cast<br/>
mesmerize, you have to stop retreating...<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I wonder if fear overrides mesmerize...<br/>

&gt; wording).  What is your experience on the relative<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;burned&quot; is the generic message for taking damage from this<br/>
shield.  &quot;was hit by non-melee damage&quot; is the private message<br/>
you get saying how much damage you did to the mob when it hits<br/>
*you*.  So you see the former any time the mob hits someone,<br/>
but you&#39;ll see the latter when it hits you.<br/>
