<div id="ygrps-yiv-466802535"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Also the dirk and whip are by no means as good as a glowing crook staff.<br/>
&gt;the dirk is 6/23 which works out to a ratio of .565 using max damage of 13,<br/>
&gt;the &#39;Glower&#39; as I hear called frequently is 11/35 which means a hefty ratio<br/>
&gt;of .657, very painful.  The BLW is even worse than a dirk at 7/28 which<br/>
&gt;works out to a ratio of only .536 using max damage.  A full point of better<br/>
&gt;ratio is pretty devastating in a one-on-one fight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Ratio on the GWC is pretty spiffy, but in no way compensates for the<br/>
ability to dual wield.  Aside from our Skill bonus in melee (the aforementioned<br/>
5xLVL +5) and our significantly higher dodge cap.  The difference could be in<br/>
the stats of your character vs. mine, but the stats themselves are not nearly<br/>
as much of a determinant as the classes themselves. (a gnome warrior is STILL a<br/>
warrior...etc)  But, my base str is 93, and in melee mode it is 103, with no<br/>
buffs or songs playing.  at lvl 20, i have offense/defense/1HS/Piercing/Dual<br/>
Wield/Hand to Hand all maxed out.  I Have no problems outperforming a shaman or<br/>
druid of equal level in melee...it is not even close. (except for HP, i am as<br/>
good as a ranger)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You kited beetles 6 levels higher than you using bellow?  I hate to be rude<br/>
&gt;but I do not believe you.  Not only would it take forever at the 7 pts a<br/>
&gt;bellow you would have been doing, but the resists would have been frequent.<br/>
&gt;Past that they should have been not &#39;too frequent&#39; but nearly 100%!  Not to<br/>
&gt;mention that running into anything else would have made 1 or 2 stuns fatal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1.  there is a &gt;6 lvl cap on bellow...yes, 100% resist.<br/>
2.  the thing that you need to understand about the Beetles is that they have<br/>
like NO base Magic Resist.  they cannot resist anything (ask a Wiz). Another<br/>
thing is that they have a delay on their attacks of roughly 4 seconds.  They<br/>
cannot stun you long enough to take advantage of it.  You don&#39;t run into<br/>
anything else, because there are about 100 safe spots to kite in North Karana. <br/>
I ran into 1 griffawn in 8 levels...and zoned.  <br/>
3.  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING is that the beetles Run (their MAX speed) is<br/>
SLOWER than you running WITHOUT accelerando.  WITHOUT PLAYING ANY SONGS, YOU<br/>
CAN STILL OUTRUN THEM.<br/>
4.  they really don&#39;t hit very hard when they do.  they have a good ac,<br/>
marginal to poor HPs and a poor attack skill (for their level) and they are the<br/>
slowest mob in the game.<br/>
<br/>
It is actually very difficult to die fighting the beetles.<br/>
I was not using Entirely bellow, because it could be quite lengthy on a high<br/>
red, i was using Bellow and COD.  That way i could pull Multiples and save<br/>
myself time by kiting them more than one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Kitasi, to ease your mind...the ones that i kited that were right below the<br/>
Hard Resist cap:  13 minutes to kite. (not very efficient:( ) Pull yellows if<br/>
possible.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
