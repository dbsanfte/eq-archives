<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076993262">That song grants Ultravision + see invis (L24), and still has value.<br/>
What if you are in a group with a shaman, necromancer, or mage but want<br/>
to sing party see invis? Are you going to kill their pets with your<br/>
invis song to do it? You get the picture. ;)<br/>
<br/>
They did a nice job of giving our invis song a huge bonus which was<br/>
sorely needed, let&#39;s not complain about the fact that we now have 2<br/>
songs that grant us this highly desirable (in my opinion) ability.<br/>

&gt; level 24<br/>
&gt; See Invis song?  I never even bought this song in the first place.<br/>
&gt; Seems to me<br/>
&gt; it is no longer required since we can just sing Clouding now.<br/>
