&gt;Just a hint to your friend, if he wants to improve his roleplaying skills,<br/>
&gt;and get more stuff handed his way, try talking more like a woman.  When was<br/>
&gt;the last time you ever heard a woman say &quot;Hey dude, can I get a bind?&quot;  <br/>
&gt;Heh,<br/>
&gt;heh the lingo gives them away almost every time.  And according to<br/>
&gt;Allakhazam&#39;s Poll, wood elf women were voted the most sexy in all Norrath.<br/>

I feel a Kabong comin on, but wtf -<br/>
<br/>
An in-game friend of mine has a fem high elf pally. I never inquired as to <br/>
gender, but I figured it out when she one time said something about her wife <br/>
coming home. Many people flirt with her/him and I find it pretty funny, but <br/>
never say anything..<br/>
<br/>
You shoulda seen the reactions (s)he incited when she said during a lull in <br/>
fighting, &quot;AFK a sec, need to take a dump.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
WHOA, too much info! Ack!<br/>
It injected a disturbing image of a female highelf into my mind that I don&#39;t <br/>
care to remember ...<br/>
