&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s funny.  My hard period was around level 23-26.  Of <br/>
&gt; course, back then<br/>
&gt; Lullaby was an actual song, not a flashy method of suicide.  <br/>
&gt; Levels 8-12<br/>
&gt; were my favorites for a long while I think, Lament and Bellow <br/>
&gt; were extremely<br/>
&gt; useful back then and Warsong was still pretty new.  Carillion is still<br/>
&gt; probably the biggest non-roleplaying reason I don&#39;t quit <br/>
&gt; playing my bard.<br/>
