<b>Subject:</b> Re: Twinking was -&gt; Blackened Iron Armor *SPOILER*  (sort of) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606715859">Maybe I read too much into it, but the rants on twinking started as a reply to<br/>
one of the people suggesting that he sell it and buy decent equipment. To me<br/>
that sounds like people are saying he&#39;ll be a twink if he goes out and sells the<br/>
crown to buy decent armor and equipment instead of hoarding it in the bank until<br/>
he is of the &quot;appropriate&quot; level to go and kill the King in runnyeye.<br/>

&gt; Uhhmmm I don&#39;t think anyone contested this particular fellow aquiring of<br/>
&gt; the item.  If fact a good amount of advice was spawn from his question.<br/>
&gt; What your seeing now is not the evaluation of him twinking, rather it has<br/>
&gt; evolved into a debate about the merits of  twinking.  This thread spawned<br/>
&gt; due to the two courses of actions suggested by the list.  If you look back<br/>
&gt; you will find that at no time did we accuse him twinking though we were<br/>
&gt; all a bit envious =).  I guess it is time to shange the topic.<br/>
