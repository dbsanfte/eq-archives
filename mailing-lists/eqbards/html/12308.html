&gt; Since I saw a bigger drop across levels on non-hell levels (or are they<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see.  I can&#39;t really say much on this - I haven&#39;t lost many<br/>
levels.  The only other time I lost a level was L27-&gt;L26.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t notice any unusual exp loss then.  I lost L31 three<br/>
times (payback for getting through 30 levels having only lost<br/>
my level once I guess).  The first time was the worst,<br/>
happening immediately after I leveled.  The other times<br/>
happened further into 31.  All of them involved about the same<br/>
amount of exp loss (portion_of_L31_bubble/1.0 +<br/>
portion_of_L31_bubble/0.5 = constant).<br/>
<br/>
Still, double-dipping or extra-large exp loss, the point is<br/>
the same - definitely avoid dying at hell levels + 1, possibly<br/>
try to avoid dying at points where you&#39;ll lose a level.<br/>
