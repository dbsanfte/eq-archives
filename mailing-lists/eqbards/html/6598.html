&gt; No matter what they say I still find it hilarious that people consider it a<br/>
&gt; problem that they are afraid to go to the Plane of Fear.  I feel for those<br/>
&gt; who were slaughtered, but I think we should all be afraid to go there.  It<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be hopeless, but it should be feared, not merely viewed as a new<br/>
&gt; place to get xp and cool items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Umm. Do you somehow get the idea it&#39;s not currently hopeless? If you<br/>
want a real plane of fear that works like the current one but is a bit<br/>
cheaper on system resources they should just make a gate that kills you<br/>
and deletes your body when you use it. We currently have the same basic<br/>
effect. There&#39;s a big difference between really scarey and unplayable.<br/>
