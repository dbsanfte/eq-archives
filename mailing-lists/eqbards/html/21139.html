<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586056144">I too play on The Rathe, so you might find this amusing B (seems to be a<br/>
lot of ignorance on Rathe).  Instead of boring you with a long story I&#39;ll<br/>
make it short.  I had a day in Ill Omen a month back when I was charming.<br/>
All alone in part of the zone, I had not seen another player in about an<br/>
hour.  I was charming mobs for one on one fights.  This warrior and bard(of<br/>
all people!) come along and start trying to kill steal.  Now they have me<br/>
distracted and two wandering mobs jump me.  No problem, I&#39;ll just run in<br/>
circles while charming.  They start disrupting the mobs that are following<br/>
me by hitting the one my pet is on, by now I lose about 400 hp because of<br/>
it.  While they are killing one of the mobs, some fool caster trains me<br/>
with 6 mobs.  I give a real life sigh and just figure if the warrior and<br/>
bard go away I&#39;ll just have a 30 minutes challenge on my hands (sounds like<br/>
fun!).  Nope . . .<br/>
<br/>
Here is the good part.  Half way through killing these I get a tell.<br/>
Warrior: &quot;If you do that again I&#39;ll have your account banned.&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Huh?&quot;<br/>
Warrior: &quot;You were charm kiting.&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Yea, since when is that against the rules?&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Aren&#39;t you the one who just tried to kill steal?  You know that IS<br/>
against the rules, and I could petition you for it, but I am not.&quot;<br/>
Warrior: &quot;You had about 10 mobs on you.  You are hogging all the kills.<br/>
You&#39;re not even getting hit.&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Yea, because I was trained.  I usually only have a one on one fight<br/>
until people jump in where they don&#39;t belong.&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;So you are going to petition me because you&#39;re jealous?&quot;<br/>
Warrior: &quot;It&#39;s not fair, your not getting hit, so that is exploiting.&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Go ahead and petition then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was on for probably another 4 or 5 hours that night and I never got a<br/>
tell from a GM, I assumed they just laughed, if he petitioned at all.<br/>
<br/>
Ignorance at it&#39;s finest.<br/>
