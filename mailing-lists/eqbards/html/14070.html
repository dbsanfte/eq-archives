<div id="ygrps-yiv-427138149">Actually, the reason I said it wasn&#39;t directed specifically at you is because I *know* you&#39;re no the only<br/>
one that feels that way.  And I agree, when I get to those levels, I&#39;m going to be annoyed that the game<br/>
has gotten boring.  However, that does not change my assertion, that when I get bored playing the game, I<br/>
will *stop* playing the game.  I&#39;ll certainly do my share to try to get Verant to make the game better for<br/>
me, but I&#39;ll not hold my breath.  And when (not if, since they simply cannot, with this game, have<br/>
infinite content) they fail to make it less boring for me, I will stop playing and move on.<br/>
<br/>
Someday a game company, maybe even Verant, will make a MMORPG that has an easy and fullproof content<br/>
generation system, so GMs can generate literally infinite quests, items, and situations that will all be<br/>
balanced, unexploitable, and fun for everyone in real time.  It will happen.  But not with EQ.  EQ is just<br/>
another step in the right direction toward the game we all want to play for the rest of our lives.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not to get your hackles up Ryan.  This is certainly not directed<br/>
&gt; &gt; specifically at you.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Sure it is, you just don&#39;t want me to flame you in return.<br/>
&gt;   Which I&#39;m not going to.  I never said I couldn&#39;t afford the<br/>
&gt;   10 dollars a month, and I&#39;ll be honest with you I&#39;m not the<br/>
&gt;   only one who feels this way.  I&#39;m not even in the minority.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I once thought the same way you did, and I&#39;ll say it again:<br/>
