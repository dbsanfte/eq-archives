&gt; Apologize beforehand for adding to the increasing number of off topic posts<br/>
&gt; on this list but I had an encounter last night with a NPC in Highpass hold<br/>
&gt; that I had never seen or heard of before.  I was camping the Mucktail site<br/>
&gt; with a level 29 cleric.  While we were waiting, we start to see messages<br/>
&gt; scroll through &quot;Cytodl Krish begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Next thing we know we<br/>
&gt; get attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard) and<br/>
&gt; blue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we both<br/>
&gt; had to make a run for the Keep zone.  We fully recharged and went out<br/>
&gt; looking for him.  I was singing invis and had elemental and purifying<br/>
&gt; ryhthms ready to weave.  We finally found the necro wandering around the<br/>
&gt; zone, with a bunch of corpses in his wake.  We attacked at the cleric tried<br/>
&gt; rooting him several times. He kept resisting and the cleric was OOM (oops, I<br/>
&gt; used an acronym).  We had to run to the border again.  We recharged and<br/>
&gt; tracked him down once again.  The second time, the cleric just kept smiting<br/>
&gt; him and we eventually killed him.  All told did over 800 damage to him.  He<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t drop any loot which was a disappointment.  When we killed him, the<br/>
&gt; factions affected, which all got worse, were The Dead, King and Queen of<br/>
&gt; some wierd name, Keepers of the Art, and Eldritch Collective.  After the<br/>
&gt; fight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC before.  No<br/>
&gt; one in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>
&gt; could shed some light on his background?  Also wanted to warn everyone in<br/>
&gt; case they ran into him and they were less level 30 they should be prepared<br/>
&gt; to run.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I think I bumped into him once before.  Many many levels back I decided<br/>
to poke around and visit all the buildings in Highpass.  One of the inns was<br/>
particularly large, and I was busily opening doors and peeking inside, when all of<br/>
a sudden I get the dreaded &quot;Wood elves like you have no place in our realm!&quot;<br/>
message and an awfully scary DE starts hitting me.  (through the wall, btw. :) )<br/>
I almost made it to the Highkeep zone, but I took a wrong turn and he took me<br/>
down - I imagine someone did something similar, and this DE started wandering<br/>
around, killing all in his path.<br/>
