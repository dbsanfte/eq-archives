<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737061306">You really don&#39;t have to clear out all the mobs to zone out. Since you only<br/>
have to run over the teleport pad to zone out, you can train many of the<br/>
mobs right to the zone out. Even without natural run speed you can make it<br/>
past the frogs and golems. Now if you have a druid or wizard ( level 57 or<br/>
58 ) in the group, have them zone evac and you&#39;ll be right at the zone in. <br/>

	The undead bard DID spawn again and shortly after, so did the<br/>
regular Trakanon. Another guild beat us there to kill him so I am once again<br/>
waiting for an undead bard spawn. <br/>
	For those of you interested in hitting Sebilis, I recommend going<br/>
right after you scribe song of twilight because your group WILL expect you<br/>
to mezz and I have found this song far superior to Charm in dungeons (and<br/>
pixie strike is resisted too much).  There is an issue with Sebilis though<br/>
-- that is getting out again.  It stinks that your group will have to clear<br/>
a path to the portal when you have to leave.<br/>
	My solution is the gate hammer quest in the Overthere.  I used my<br/>
deciever mask to do the quest:<br/>
	Give the foreman a piece of jade to stick in his eye socket (or<br/>
somesuch place P) and he&#39;ll reward you with a hammer that procs gate to the<br/>
Overthere.  You&#39;ll materialize in the shipyard -- inside the ship being<br/>
built.  You&#39;ll need mezz to stop the Skele that will immediately attack you.<br/>
Throw on the drum, right click your mask and beat feet.<br/>
	If you haven&#39;t been to Sebilis, I highly recommend it.  You&#39;ll meet<br/>
some of the best players in the game there, and the loot/xp are great.  Just<br/>
bring that hammer or a gate potion)<br/>

suggested a theory (actually did a bit of <br/>
	watching to come up with it) that the Undead Bard is on a flat 20 <br/>
	hour spawn cycle and is KOS to Trakanon.<br/>
	<br/>
	If this is true, the seemingly random spawn times seem to come from <br/>
	people not knowing when he actually died last (i.e. most of the time<br/>
<br/>
	that knowing precisely when Trakanon spawns) and relating his spawn <br/>
	time to Trak&#39;s death, not the Undead Bards.<br/>
	<br/>
	For example, the server pops and both Trak and UDB spawn.  Trak<br/>
kills <br/>
	UDB.  20 hours from that point, if Trak is dead, the UDB will spawn <br/>
	and stay up.  If Trak dies 18 hours after server pop, the UDB will<br/>
be <br/>
	up in 2 hours.  If Trak dies 21 hours after server pop, the UDB will<br/>
<br/>
	be up in 19 hours (he&#39;d already spawned and was whacked by Trak<br/>
once).<br/>
