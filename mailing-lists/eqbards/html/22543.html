<br/>
Or, he can use instrument and Chants.  With good instruments, significant<br/>
damage - like &gt;1800 per minute. So, bard&#39;s add 1200 to 1500 with store<br/>
drums.  Get MM or Tamborine or Selo&#39;s and you do more.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; decreases downtime itself.  This allows the party to pull stuff faster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, mana song in downtime keeps clerics and hybrids at full potential.<br/>
Your ench has Theft of Thought and with that and his own clarity buff he<br/>
should stay above 66% mana if not more.  Kinda all depends on where you<br/>
fight and training your group to let you keep your &quot;mana mob&quot; alive.  But<br/>
mana for ench is not a problem normally.<br/>
<br/>
A cleric with an ench and a bard in the group can pretty much nuke to his<br/>
heart is content and that is 516 to 1032 more dmg per mob. The cleric will<br/>
ask the bard to play mana song in combat if things are falling behind mana<br/>
wise.  I dont find that an un-reasonable request at all. Let me also say<br/>
that I actively play 54 bard, 53 cleric and 51 enchanter and have been in<br/>
groups with other bards.   <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; control, 2) primary healer, 3) a tank, 4) a puller, 5) a group gater<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(sometimes), 6) a lockpicker<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (sometimes), 7) secondary healer (sometimes).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our enchanters (mine too) don&#39;t go into dungeon&#39;s without clerics (and<br/>
clerics that they can trust).  Next is a plate class tank.  We use mez &<br/>
cheal tactics.  Conservation of mana is accomplished by having a tank with<br/>
high hps be the focus of the mobs attention. Next on the list is a &quot;snare&quot;<br/>
person.  I hate that role as a bard.  Our snares suck - we have to re-stick<br/>
it.  I pretty much have to drop everything else to maintain the snare - much<br/>
rather have a ranger, druid, sk, necro or wizard doing the snares.  But then<br/>
- you pretty much have the requirements for a decent exp group.  Lockpick,<br/>
evac for certain spots but you certainly have other choices.  Secondary<br/>
healer? Only if you would lose a cleric for some odd reason.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The bard can&#39;t do any of these things other than limited crowd control, or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pulling (which doesn&#39;t allow him to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; play the downtime reducing role), which means that he doesn&#39;t satisfy any<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of the core requirements.<br/>
<br/>
A bard can&#39;t be the plate class meat-shield tank that gets chealed while<br/>
taunting the mobs as they are BS&#39;d to death.  Thats a Warriors job.<br/>
<br/>
A bard cant be primary healer - that&#39;s a cleric&#39;s job.<br/>
<br/>
He can be the snare person - but if he;s like me - its not much fun.<br/>
<br/>
He can do good additional damage with DoT&#39;s (chants) and he can keep mana<br/>
maxxed and actually above provide more to allow others to do more than<br/>
usual.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the specialtys are needed for certain places - but that is why they are<br/>
specialties - I wish bards could pick more doors in Kunark.  I have &quot;heard&quot;<br/>
that Scars of V. will have places for &quot;sense traps&quot; and &quot;disarm traps&quot; to be<br/>
used. Will they let  us bards do this? Let&#39;s hope.<br/>
 <br/>
Any person who spends a lot of time in /gu telling everyone how much their<br/>
class sucks will soon discover that the guild is if not believing them - at<br/>
least totally sick of hearing them whine and they wont be getting groups.<br/>
It wont be a matter of class balance, but it will be how they play their<br/>
char - ie constant whining.  Yes, I think bards need some fixing up and<br/>
perhaps VI has done this in this patch - but the constant whining about how<br/>
badly bard&#39;s suck (whether they do or not) hurts more than anything towards<br/>
getting a group.</div>
