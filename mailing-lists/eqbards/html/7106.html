<div id="ygrps-yiv-970773279">Sorry you think this topic was a troll. It was my first post to the list and I thought I had a legitimate issue and was very happy to read the varied opinions from the list members. Some of the opinions and play styles differ from mine. That&#39;s cool. I can understand their motivations and now I am better for it. Maybe my future party members may be better for it as well. That doesn&#39;t sound much like a troll to me.<br/>

&gt;At level 15 when I first entered Guk that *was* the only way.<br/>
&gt;There was absolutely no way for me to get past the Troll<br/>
&gt;guards outside of Grobb in order to be bound there. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;not a tolerance level. That&#39;s a reality.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This whole thing strikes me as a simple troll (hee!) post. Clearly good<br/>
aligned characters being bound in evil cities is absurd. Monks could sneak<br/>
it at one point great. All the danger tolerance level in the world doesn&#39;t<br/>
make it s SMART thing to do (as outlined by John, the hours lost due to<br/>
death don&#39;t make up for the running time). No amount of machismo makes the<br/>
argument make any sense at all. I would suggest we not fuel the trolls fun<br/>
any longer.<br/>
