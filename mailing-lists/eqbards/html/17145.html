<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809954973">Yes they are preprogrammed to do the same thing every time.  However, if I<br/>
was within 20% of the other people&#39;s damage output over the course of 50<br/>
fights, statistics would tell you that during some of those fights I would<br/>
actually do more damage than them.  That never occurred.  In no fight did I<br/>
outdamage them for more than a few mob swings.<br/>
In many fights I never outdamaged them and took not one attack.  I could<br/>
have been wearing absolutely nothing and no fight outcome would have changed<br/>
so long as I continued to swing since I was almost never doing enough to get<br/>
the mob&#39;s attention.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Not true.  that would only occur is vs every mob I was a few % points<br/>
&gt;behind.  Odds are if I was even 80% as effective as them I would win out by<br/>
&gt;random chance vs some mobs when I did well and they did not and I would get<br/>
&gt;the mob attention.  This never happened.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really.  The mobs are programmed to react to combat in a pre-defined<br/>
manner.  If you&#39;re not doing anything to taunt the mob (ie, debuffing,<br/>
healing its opponents, etc), it&#39;s going to be based purely on the amount of<br/>
damage you are doing and your proximity.  Hence, if Player A is doing just<br/>
5% more damage than Player B, with proximity being equal, and nothing<br/>
factored in except damage, the mob is going to focus on Player A.  I believe<br/>
that&#39;s John&#39;s point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;All combat messages were on and they way outdamaged me, not even close.<br/>
&gt;Ranger has double attack in addition to dual wield and the sk was just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>scary<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;with double attack and his 2-hddr.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, they are going to outdamage you.  That is a given.  The issue is, by<br/>
how much?  And, unless you parse the data, you&#39;ll never know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Neither the ranger nor the sk worried about putting points anywhere but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>strength and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;agility and stamina because it just didn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These stats don&#39;t contribute as much as originally thought.  Also, of the<br/>
stats listed, only Str makes a noticable difference to combat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  the sk can hit twice in a round for 40+ points each hit (Dark Reaver),<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the ranger<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;has the same combo I do, PGT and Dirk, plus he has double attack so can hit<br/>
&gt;twice as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, but what does he average?  And, how long does he wait between swings?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Consider.  All melee classes get 6 or 7 melee skills except bards.  we get<br/>
&gt;two, dodge (which everyone gets) and dual wield.  That&#39;s not even close to<br/>
&gt;50%.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only 4 of those skills are offensive skills -- Dual Wield, Double Attack,<br/>
Kick, and Bash.  You can either Kick OR Bash, not both, and the damage from<br/>
this skill is supplementary; it doesn&#39;t constitute a large amount of the<br/>
damage.  So, basically it boils down to Dual Wield and Double Attack; which<br/>
puts us in the 50% category.  Including Kick/Bash may drop that to 44%, but<br/>
that&#39;s still close to 50%.<br/>
<br/>
The other skills are defensive skills, and don&#39;t apply to damage output.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, until someone takes the time to quantify melee damage done<br/>
through parsed logs with similar weapons, I&#39;ll never subscribe to the &quot;bards<br/>
do nominal melee damage&quot; line.  I&#39;ll accept the fact that we do the least.<br/>
