<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852529874">Dear Berk, <br/>
<br/>
&#39;Tis sad to see a bard speak so harshly. You don&#39;t know me well, then. My<br/>
intent is to prevent a novice bard from getting incorrect information. <br/>
<br/>
Being a founder of the Soerbaird, with members who have put hours of time<br/>
into various Beta Phases, and much research into all things Bardic, I would<br/>
say I have access to a lot of good information and research. I need only to<br/>
turn to my fellow Soerbaird for accurate information I don&#39;t already have. A<br/>
level 25 bard in our guild seems to be quite a rich source of experiential<br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Our guild is built to be a boon for Bards, and thus it&#39;s my charge, as well<br/>
as the charge all Soerbaird to be helpful. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t think it&#39;s arrogant or selfish to ask people to be accurate<br/>
rather than wrong. I don&#39;t think young bards want to be given incorrect<br/>
information. &quot;Guesstimates&quot; are fine, so long as they are posed that way. My<br/>
contention was that people were posting incorrect information as truth.<br/>
<br/>
As for time, I give what time I have to providing a source of information to<br/>
Soerbaird as well as to anyone interested. I built the Soerbaird web site as<br/>
a resource for you or anyone else - as well as for my guild. I have indeed<br/>
invested many hours into developing this information storehouse for you and<br/>
anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s only 1 week old, the site will soon be overflowing with<br/>
information for young and old bards alike. I can tell you the leaders of the<br/>
Soerbaird spend little time powergaming, and much time tinkering with<br/>
quests, writing ballads, and testing techniques for bards. <br/>
<br/>
As you might imagine, it takes time to document research, and I&#39;m always<br/>
grateful to those who do.<br/>

Why don&#39;t you enlighten all us poor dunces<br/>
with your incredible deductive prowess?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what, you don&#39;t have the time?<br/>
<br/>
You would prefer to passively benefit only<br/>
from the most exacting research of others,<br/>
and not their guesstimates? Personally I follow<br/>
the big grain of salt rule for almost anything<br/>
that comes across my cable modem.<br/>
<br/>
My preliminary deduction is that you are selfish<br/>
and arrogant.<br/>

&gt; I could spend hours trying to correct a lot of misinformation being posted<br/>
&gt; by some people. I would ask that if you aren&#39;t 100% sure about the<br/>
&gt; information you give, don&#39;t post it as a statement, rather ask it as a<br/>
&gt; question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It reveals to me there&#39;s a lot of poor deductive logic going on with some<br/>
&gt; players - drawing conclusions from game experiences that are more based on<br/>
&gt; coincidence than on good research.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>
&gt; going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>
&gt; truth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a big difference between:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ---- &quot;Hill Giants can outrun Selo&#39;s&quot;<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; ---- &quot;A Hill Giant seemed to outrun my Selo&#39;s, has anyone else seen this?&quot;<br/>
&gt; The complicated thing is that one MAY have tested this fully, and<br/>
&gt; thus could<br/>
&gt; say:<br/>
&gt; ---- &quot;I tried running 10 times from a Hill Giant and here are the<br/>
&gt; results....&quot;<br/>
