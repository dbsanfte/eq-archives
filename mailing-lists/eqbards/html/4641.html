<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just curious, does Celerity stack with Anthem de Arms? If so, I&#39;m interested<br/>
in why one would choose Chant of Battle over Anthem. My current lineup at<br/>
level 16 (DING! - I *love* the jig! It&#39;s so much more entertaining if while<br/>
watching it, you sing to yourself - &quot;Do a little dance, Make a little love,<br/>
Get down tonight! Get down tonight!)<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
Hymn of Restoration<br/>
Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament<br/>
Anthem de Arms<br/>
Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow<br/>
<br/>
Then I usually use two remaining slots to rotate as needed things like<br/>
Locating, Aquatic Ayre and Cindra&#39;s Charismatic Carillion (even though I<br/>
haven&#39;t noticed it doing much good). When soloing I usually stack Jonthans,<br/>
Anthem and Hymn - sometimes throwing in a bellow or two for good measure.<br/>
Songs that I&#39;ve noticed don&#39;t seem to do much are the Rhythm songs and the<br/>
Lucid Lullaby (Rats outside of Freeport were resisting it to me last night<br/>
at level 16). I didnt even bother to purchase the Cataloging song. I&#39;m<br/>
looking forward to 17 for the dual weild and sneak  skills but I don&#39;t know<br/>
whether to get the song since it&#39;s another in the line of Rhythms. Is it me<br/>
doing something wrong, or are these songs either very weak or completely<br/>
useless?</div>
