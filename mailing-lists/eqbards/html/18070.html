<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089575263">Man...I feel bad now.  I placed my order the day the store opened,<br/>
and of course I paid for overnight just in case.  Well...when I found out<br/>
that<br/>
they had just started taking orders and that it wouldnt SHIP until the<br/>
11th...<br/>
I was one of those &quot;WHy the hell did you charge me overnight then you<br/>
goits!&quot;<br/>
people.   Well...Turns out I was lucky as hell.  Mine shipped and got here<br/>
on the<br/>
14th.<br/>
<br/>
They DID send a shipment confirmation e-mail to me, so I wouldnt worry<br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
I think they should offer to cancel orders that havent shipped and let you<br/>
go buy it in stores on monday if you want to.   The upgrade came with a<br/>
cloth map ( pretty crappy craftmanship comared to the Ultima cloth ones<br/>
though...)<br/>
but it didnt come with a new manual.   If the retail one comes with a new<br/>
maual with iskar history/art/whatever....it will make me mad.<br/>
I love aving those little things...:( *sniff*  oh well...<br/>
<br/>
For comfort I&#39;ll say that it hasnt done me any good to have it.<br/>
The only thing I see is that now on the server select screen it says<br/>
&quot;Kunark Enabled&quot;  Thats it.  If you have a level 50 you could be<br/>
exp&#39;s now...but other than that its nothing big.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your orders though.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Oh!  the upgrade also comes with a card advertising the<br/>
new line of EQ toys...and you can cash it in for a free SharkJaw<br/>
Cutlass toy..:)  pretty cool...however it wont ship to you until<br/>
SEPTEMBER 30th!<br/>
<br/>
AUGH...oh well..:)<br/>
