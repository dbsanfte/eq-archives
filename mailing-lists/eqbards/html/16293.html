<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-4070933">I just started playing it last Sunday.  I too am enjoying it a lot.  I also<br/>
played Rolemaster to death. :)<br/>
<br/>
I love the skill/attribute system.  It makes sense.  I like, contrary to<br/>
what some people have said, the way your character looks.  I like the fact<br/>
that everyone doesn&#39;t look exactly the same, depending on class.  Piecemeal<br/>
armor doesn&#39;t look as nearly as stupid as it does in EQ, either.<br/>
<br/>
My only complaint is the disk thrashing as you walk through the land (which<br/>
looks 10000x better than EQ&#39;s &quot;landscape&quot;, IMO.)  I don&#39;t have a slow<br/>
computer by any means (400mhz Cel, 256M ram, decently fast HD it&#39;s on,<br/>
etc..) but the pausing when it accesses the disk is annoying.  There should<br/>
be a way to have it retain textures and such in RAM when you&#39;ve got a ton of<br/>
it.  Unless I just don&#39;t know about some way to fix that.. (checking AC<br/>
websites....)<br/>
<br/>
However, like you, I will be keeping my EQ account active for the time<br/>
being.  Don&#39;t know how long that will be.  I hadn&#39;t played since last<br/>
Friday, log on today, go LD within 10 minutes.  Get back on, and all<br/>
cerf-net servers are being shut down, so I have to log.  :)  Unfortunately,<br/>
there&#39;s a problem with characters not appearing when you login to AC right<br/>
now, or else I&#39;d be playing that. :)<br/>

&gt; My server has been on the blink recently so I haven&#39;t been getting any<br/>
&gt; eqbard emails.  Got a flood of them today now that its working finally.<br/>
&gt; Thought I would comment on this topic as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My RL best friend bought AC and convinced me to buy it as well.  The price<br/>
&gt; was only $25 at COMPUSA and you get a month free so I figured even if I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t like it I would get my money&#39;s worth.  After playing it for the<br/>

&gt; The original poster covered most of the pros and cons so I won&#39;t go into<br/>
&gt; those.  As it stands right now, I&#39;m going to keep my EQ account active for<br/>
&gt; now but I think, in the near future, I will end up spending most of my<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; playing AC.  Here are the key factors why:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1)  Get to play with my best friend online.<br/>
&gt; 2)  AC is much better than EQ for casual gamers.  If you don&#39;t have but an<br/>
&gt; hour or two to play, you can still log in and accomplish something.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Soloing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is a viable alternative, whether outside or in a dungeon.<br/>
&gt; 3)  No overcrowding and therefore no fighting over spawns.<br/>
&gt; 4)  Fast respawn rate.  In the places I&#39;ve been so far, the respawn rate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; somewhere around 5 minutes.  Basically nonstop action no matter where you<br/>
&gt; are at.<br/>
&gt; 5)  No camping.  Loot is randomized based on the level of the mob you are<br/>
&gt; fighting.<br/>
&gt; 6)  No hell levels!!<br/>
&gt; 7)  No EXP loss when dying.  Vitae penalty worked off gradually as you<br/>

&gt; 8)  Dungeon crawl mode of adventuring is the standard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if these issues are more important to you than having a bank to store<br/>
&gt; stuff, traditional fantasy classes/monsters, secure trading windows, and a<br/>
&gt; better chat interface, then you might enjoy AC.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone decides to give it a try, look me up on the Morningthaw server.<br/>
&gt; My character&#39;s name is Ott Numah.<br/>
