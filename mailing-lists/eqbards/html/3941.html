<div id="ygrps-yiv-349506445">I went to the saturday night bazaar and was shocked at the prices people<br/>
were paying for bronze!  I had actually outfitted a good amount of my own<br/>
bronze from High Hold NPCs, and paid less than the poor schmos at the<br/>
bazaar!  Best check the NPCs around the area, you just may pay less than<br/>
from PCs.  (The NPCs perhaps truely understand the value of bonze, it&#39;s<br/>
junk...)<br/>

&gt;Yes Sol B is extremly good for Medium Bronze it&#39;s very common there. While<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not quite ready for it I have a friend who is there quite a bit and he<br/>
&gt;recently told me about it. Basically though all his group does is sell it<br/>
