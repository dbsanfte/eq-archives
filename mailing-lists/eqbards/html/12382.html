since Robin gave us this nice topic titled BardSpeed, I&#39;ll<br/>
just reply here.  :)<br/>

You can outrun normal mobs (including giants) while almost<br/>
dead at about level 20 with a normal drum.  You can actually<br/>
outrun them quite a bit earlier, but the speed difference is<br/>
not enough to let you avoid getting hit multiple times.  Level<br/>
20 is the first time I distinctly remember Accel with a drum<br/>
letting me give a party member (with literally nothing showing<br/>
on his hp bar) a clean getaway from the mobs chasing him.<br/>
