&gt; Look at this nonsense I pulled of EQVault, of course people are pissed,<br/>
&gt; Verant NEVER tells us when they nerf our abilities...I lost the invis vs<br/>
&gt; undead affect of the clouding song and nobody told me until I nearly died<br/>
&gt; finding out by mistake:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Test Server Comments <br/>
&gt; Verant President John Smedley sent me the following letter that addresses<br/>
&gt; the Test Server and the recent number of complaints it has received:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I am somewhat surprised at the number of people that are complaining about<br/>
&gt; some changes that we have put up recently on the Test Server (namely the DoT<br/>
&gt; change and the Necro Pet change). Please understand that the Test Server is<br/>
&gt; just that... a place where we can TEST ideas we have. It absolutely does NOT<br/>
&gt; mean that the changes seen there will make there way onto the Live Servers.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes we need to try new things to see what works and what doesn&#39;t to<br/>
&gt; solve particular problems. Brad will cover this topic more in his Producer&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Letter. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh. What he actually means is that they use the test server to see who<br/>
will notice the changes. If they don&#39;t generate huge complaints they<br/>
sneak them onto the regular server without mentioning the change in the<br/>
update notice. If they are noticed and the complaints are loud enough<br/>
they withdraw them and try to slide something less noticable in later.<br/>
