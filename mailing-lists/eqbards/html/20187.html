<div id="ygrps-yiv-362529530">I am almost never the one originally inviting or leading, because I hate<br/>
  being leader.<br/>
<br/>
  - Maybe I am wrong here but I am almost always the inviter in the group.<br/>
I don&#39;t see that as making me the leader of the group at all.  I just trust<br/>
that most people know when to give up and run :)  But I am normally the<br/>
first in a group to say run.  If we have an SK or Shaman in the group I<br/>
don&#39;t tend to pull but if not the because of my speed I pull.  I tried<br/>
following a ranger around for a while with speed song but in the end I got<br/>
beat because I was always behind (autofollow)...<br/>
<br/>
  I have only ever had on conflict in a group.  This was around level 10 and<br/>
our group of 6 was in CB.  Someone else had killed Crush and shouted he had<br/>
a tunic on him to loot.  I just sent a tell to the guy saying that the<br/>
corpse was unlootable at that time.  So he went over and looted the corpse<br/>
and gave me the tunic - man was I just proud!  Then a guy in the group<br/>
starts to go off about how he wants to tunic too.  I just pointed out that<br/>
the tunic was given to me.  But he would not shut up.  So after a while of<br/>
talking about it he said he wanted the tunic for an alt and I said great I<br/>
wanted the tunic for me ;)  Then he had to log... awwwww<br/>
<br/>
  I have yet to be in a group that was ever really camping anything so maybe<br/>
a lot of arguments have not come out of that yet.  In the groups I have been<br/>
in most people don&#39;t seem to care to loot to start with.  And if they do<br/>
it&#39;s basicly a Free for all - so long as autosplit is on.  From there if<br/>
something it looted that you would like you just have to ask....<br/>
<br/>
  (I think I lost the plot of this)<br/>
<br/>
  I can see in some of the more dangers places a strong leader would be a<br/>
necessity!  And that one person would be who everyone listens to.  But I am<br/>
still little in the scheme of things and have yet to find that area....<br/>
