<b>Subject:</b> Soloing at 23 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-415827452">Someone asked about this a short time ago and as I am currently 23 I was<br/>
excited about hearing any replies, welp, there were none, and I think I know<br/>
at least part of why. These are some tough levels to solo. And what soloing<br/>
you can do can be pretty tedious.<br/>
<br/>
I have been grouping lately and hoping that would just get me through the<br/>
next couple of levels, however I have soloed a bit, here are some meager<br/>
suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
Roaming Aviak Rooks in South Karana. The positive side is that if you get in<br/>
to trouble (which I do regularly with the tougher blues) you can heal kite<br/>
and turn to fight again.<br/>
<br/>
The odd Undead reaver still cons blue in East Karana.<br/>
<br/>
Chasm minos in the Gorge are good, but they are not the common spawn the<br/>
gorge minos are.<br/>
<br/>
Aviak Guards in Lake Rathe.<br/>
<br/>
All these are fine I guess but as they are all just slightly tougher<br/>
versions of what I did soloing at lower levels I am finding them fairly<br/>
tedious. I love soling, it is one of my favorite things to do, but my soling<br/>
days may be waning, I need a very specific situation to have fun soloing,<br/>
challenge with risk, the ability to control the way the fight progresses,<br/>
some kind of possibilitty it could all fail and I could die, and the<br/>
opportunity to prevent that with skill. The areas where this is possible are<br/>
shrinking quickly in number.<br/>
<br/>
Any other suggestions would be very very welcome.<br/>
