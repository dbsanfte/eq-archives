<div id="ygrps-yiv-218868057">Ogre guards INSIDE Oggok is rarely dull or boring and easy to justify as a<br/>
role player and there really isn&#39;t any place in the game for better XP at<br/>
level 45...  Positioned down at the bank area or PoD, you&#39;ll have a minimum<br/>
of 5 spawns plus wanders and there are plenty of challenges to keep you on<br/>
your toes.  It&#39;s not your typical break up the spawn and med in between<br/>
scenario like most guard killing is.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Final Hell Level....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyone got any tips on good hunting places at level 45? I am currently<br/>
&gt; almost 1 bub into 45 and am hoping to be out of 45 by the time Kunark is<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been fighting bats/bugs in sol b (I like camping stone spider<br/>
&gt; room.....lots of space nice an easy to charm mobs), should I stay here or<br/>
&gt; is there other &#39;Hot Spots&#39; for exp that maybe I should try.....I don&#39;t<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; guard killing, it is dull and boring...<br/>
