<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472629497">Um, how long has Ester been on vacation?<br/>
<br/>
FROM THE FORUM:<br/>
<br/>
As for lullaby, I just said in another thread that<br/>
Ester, the one who was going to look at this, is on<br/>
vacation, and I&#39;ll have to check with her when she<br/>
gets back. Now that I think of it, I think I may<br/>
remember someone stating that lullaby&#39;s current<br/>
functionality is intended, as it&#39;s the only thing to<br/>
keep them from trivializing encounters. I&#39;ll have to<br/>
check with Ester when she gets back to be sure.<br/>
