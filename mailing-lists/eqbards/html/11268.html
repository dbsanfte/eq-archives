<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I think die is too lite of a word.  Maybe annihilated?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do the Battle drums and the Gypsy Lute drop in the same room if they do how<br/>
&gt; rare are the drops because I am getting some MM drums if they drop.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The ballroom is where you will find all three items.<br/>
<br/>
  During the day the musicians have a chance of carrying the Gypsy<br/>
  Lute.  And the named musician carrys the Lute of the Gypsy Princess<br/>
  common, and MM Drums rare.  How rare?  1 in 5, 1 in 10?  Honestly,<br/>
  I haven&#39;t waited around long enough.  She is an uncommon spawn.<br/>
  During the night the musicians turn into werewolves.<br/>
<br/>
  The ballroom is guarded by:<br/>
<br/>
  3 NPCS out front, 2 NPCS at the gate, 2 NPCS inside the gate,<br/>
  3 or 4 NPCS guard the entrance to ballroom, 2 NPCS guard the<br/>
  corridor into the ballroom, and 5 NPCS guard the area around<br/>
  the ballroom.  1 or 2 wandering NPCS sweep the ballroom.<br/>
<br/>
  Once you get agro&#39;d on, due to poor castle pathing and AI,<br/>
  the entire castle comes, ~30 monsters.  And my favorite <br/>
  saying on corpse recovery is:<br/>
 <br/>
  &#39;Damn??!  Even the cooks have Harm Touch!!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  The best way to penetrate the castle is to take as little people<br/>
  as possible, thus you reduce the liabilities.  And a L39+ druid <br/>
  is a must.  Not to sound too disparaging. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck!<br/>
