&gt; &gt; we will most likely also slightly increase<br/>
&gt; &gt; the durations of DoT spells to compensate for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the additional time necessary to cast the spells<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So it&#39;s also going to take LONGER to cast DoT spells?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The reports I have in so far basically say<br/>
&gt; &gt; if the  monster is out of your melee range<br/>
&gt; &gt; it takes no damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So in other words, a group cosisting of a wizard and a<br/>
&gt; Shaman for example.. The wizard casts root on the mob<br/>
&gt; and then the Shaman poisons it. Darn, sorry - you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; not close enough to the monster, your DoT isn&#39;t going<br/>
&gt; to work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How *#*$ stupid can they get?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The whole point of a DoT is to poison something. If we<br/>
&gt; as players chase a mob that poisoned us, does OUR<br/>
&gt; poison stop? I bet I can tell you the answer to that<br/>
&gt; one rather quickly. Poison is poison. It&#39;s in the body,<br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t go away just because you have to chase<br/>
&gt; something. I don&#39;t normally kite (how boring) but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; totally against them changing the spells this drastically<br/>
&gt; for everyone just because some people do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, and 2 times NO.  You&#39;re worse than my fellow shaman!<br/>
/em rolls his eyes in exasperation!<br/>

The kiting fix has nothing to do with range.  Essentially, DoT spells do not<br/>
damage the NPC if the NPC is chasing you and has a velocity. If he is not<br/>
moving or he is fleeing from you, the DoT does damage.<br/>
<br/>
IF we make this change live, and that&#39;s an IF at this point, we will most<br/>
likely also slightly increase  the durations of DoT spells to compensate for<br/>
the additional time necessary to cast the spells and  then set up your<br/>
defense (you tanking, another player tanking, a pet tanking, etc).<br/>

Now this is in direct contradiction to what people CLAIM to have seen.<br/>
Two possibilities :<br/>
1.  There&#39;s a bug that&#39;s causing DoTs to fail outside of melee range (which,<br/>
if you&#39;ll simply read the above is NOT the intent)<br/>
<br/>
2.  The caster is simply too distant to see the dropping health.  This is<br/>
more<br/>
likely in my experience.  I often use Tainted Breath to pull, so that the<br/>
mob<br/>
is taking damage while I pull it back.  (I&#39;ve changed to pulling with<br/>
drowsy,<br/>
then popping TB when I reach my fighting spot)  Often, you will not see<br/>
the mob&#39;s health drop when your a ways from the mob, this is a known issue<br/>
that a mob&#39;s health bar doesn&#39;t refresh if you&#39;re too far away.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the phrase &quot;Increase the durations of DoT spells&quot; means more ticks<br/>
of the poison hitting the mob, which will either increase overall damage, or<br/>
require less damage per pulse.  (undoing part of the change the made to them<br/>
to make DoT&#39;s more group friendly)<br/>
<br/>
As far as a RP reason for them to fail, how &#39;bout when you turn to run, you<br/>
lose control of the spell and it fails?  (too busy concentratiing on getting<br/>
away)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to have to copy this response to my clipboard, because sure as I&#39;m<br/>
sitting here I&#39;ll see a LOT of this when I read the shaman list :( </span></blockquote></div>
