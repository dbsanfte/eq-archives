<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497535671">It is my understanding that every item that drops in the PoG is also<br/>
questable there (I could be wrong).  I am personally a follower of<br/>
Quellious, so I dont have any specific restrictions (other than roleplaying<br/>
ones) about hunting in the PoG. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I dont understand is: why is our loot dropping there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, there are quests that offer very similar rewards but have you tried<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; get them? PoG drops the items, Giants simply do not drop the items (needed<br/>
&gt; for questing) at a rate anywhere close to PoG *and* some gems are still<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; found yet.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would guess that Verant made a mistake in PoG - I am guessing that they<br/>
&gt; thought it would be uber-hard - or at least as hard as the &quot;other ways&quot; to<br/>
&gt; get the similar items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They continue to fail to understand what motivates the players.  On top of<br/>
&gt; that, they do not structure the &quot;reward system&quot; to support the &quot;content&quot;<br/>
&gt; (role play, history, lore, etc) or background story.  In some ways, it is<br/>
&gt; interesting that players can &quot;choose&quot; who to side with but it is a joke<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; them to ignore the fact that the majority of players will follow the<br/>
&gt; course<br/>
&gt; of least resistence toward the path of the most loot. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; True.  Of course the simpliest way to avoid faction hits in PoG is to NOT<br/>
&gt; HUNT THERE :)  As Rokenn follows Tunare he certainly will not be, and<br/>
&gt; shame<br/>
&gt; on you wood elves that go there to kill your godess&#39; creations.  What are<br/>
&gt; you Teir&#39;dal or something? haha<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My monk on the other hand is only 2 levels a way from smackin around<br/>
&gt; Tunare&#39;s creations, hehe. Must get a silver moon bracer.<br/>
