We&#39;ve been able to kill both Severilious and Talendor (or whatever their<br/>
names are) pretty easily since they showed up.. mostly we do have over 55s<br/>
though.  Gorenaire, well lets just say &#39;slaughter&#39; doesn&#39;t really describe<br/>
it. Hoping it will go better since the fear bug is supposedly fixed now.<br/>
<br/>
But thats just my experiences!<br/>

&gt; My guild can&#39;t do Vox or Naggy straight up because almost all <br/>
&gt; of us are above level 52.  I&#39;m curious if<br/>
&gt; anyone can give me some guidance on how level 53+ characters <br/>
&gt; can contribute to a Vox/Naggy raid without<br/>
&gt; being tossed (or with being tossed, if that&#39;s useful).  I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t understand the mechanics of when someone<br/>
&gt; is tossed and when they aren&#39;t.  We have a couple of small <br/>
&gt; guild allies that we could use as front men.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, does anyone have links to any good information on <br/>
&gt; taking down the Kunark dragons?  We haven&#39;t done<br/>
&gt; any of them yet; everyone keeps saying we have too few high <br/>
&gt; levels (50 over level 53 doesn&#39;t seem that<br/>
&gt; weak to me, but what do I know?  We have about 5 level 60s now.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m never getting this epic weapon, we have too many <br/>
&gt; warriors, and two Bards in front of me.  But it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; nice to dream.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Creediki[FoH] just got his Singing Short Sword a few days <br/>
&gt; before the patch<br/>
&gt; &gt; went in. It&#39;s pretty damn sweet, and moreso now that it <br/>
&gt; acts as a universal<br/>
&gt; &gt; instrument. He tested it on different songs and found that it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; substantially less powerful as an instrument than selo&#39;d <br/>
&gt; drums or kelin&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; lute, but it still amplifies pretty well. I&#39;m sure someone <br/>
&gt; will post some<br/>
&gt; &gt; stats on how it stacks up verses our normal instruments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently 1 white scale away from getting my SSS. We&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; been killing Vox<br/>
&gt; &gt; weekly, but she has not been very generous with scales. If <br/>
&gt; you want to see a<br/>
&gt; &gt; CRAP loot load, you should have been present yesterday when <br/>
&gt; ALL she dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt; was 4 frozen paladin books. Today she dropped 2 RBB&#39;s, a <br/>
&gt; bracer, and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; crystal spear so she kinda made up for that faux pax, but STILL NO<br/>
&gt; &gt; SCALES...grr...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh well. If Shada or anyone else with an SSS posts some <br/>
&gt; instrument-tests I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure we&#39;d all be curious to see how it does. =P<br/>
