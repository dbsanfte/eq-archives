<div id="ygrps-yiv-252846103">But if you compare it to a potion (which costs a fortune) even 1 charge is<br/>
not bad as an emergency assist. Last time I looked at potions, a light heal<br/>
potion was 30pp! The squad ring heals 80hp(i think?) which is about the<br/>
same as the Heal spell.<br/>

Some people are selling the squad ring, but it is a scam.  Since if your<br/>
faction is not high enough to get the ring yourself in the first place, you<br/>
won&#39;t be able to recharge the ring or get a new ring once you used up the<br/>
one charge in the ring.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;so the next question would obviously be Why aren&#39;t people selling these<br/>
&gt;things?  I would think they would bring a hefty bit o change.  Also if<br/>
&gt;anyone knows I have worked my faction with the Guardians of the Vale up to<br/>
&gt;kindly, am I getting even close?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thanks for all the money suggestions.  the snake complaint was a side ref<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the fact that used  to be anytime someone in Qeynos asked how they could<br/>
&gt;make money a bunch of people would shout &#39;kill snakes&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;also saw no mention of tailoring getting any tweaking in the new patch.<br/>
&gt;Wonder why?  we already have zillions of smiths but who&#39;s ever seen<br/>
&gt;reinforced leather, much les studded being auctioned?<br/>

&gt;It&#39;s a lore item.  You can only have one in your possession or<br/>
&gt;in the bank at a time.  You can drop or trade it (I bought one<br/>
&gt;for testing a while back, and found another on the ground with<br/>
&gt;a different character - apparently left by someone who didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know they could be recharged).<br/>
