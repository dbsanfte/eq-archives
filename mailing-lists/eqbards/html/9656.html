I have turned particle density off now.  The new sparklies at level 39 were just too<br/>
much.  I have been weaving four songs in Oggok killing ogre guards.  I am able to do<br/>
this with 3 party-buff songs plus bellow.   The ogre guards have monster magic<br/>
resists so bellow often does only partial damage and other targeted songs are<br/>
completely resisted (chains, fear, charm).  In other, more graphic-intensive<br/>
situations, weaving three songs is still a challenge.<br/>
