<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251221645">Since we have the ability to locate, there is some precedent for a Summon<br/>
Corpse equivalent, although I think Verant want to keep that as Necro-only.<br/>
<br/>
So a similar song that is useless enough for us to actually get:<br/>
<br/>
A song that summons the bard to the targeted corpse - a cross between<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric and Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion.  Quit laughing and<br/>
hear me out.  First you would target the live player and use Lyssa&#39;s<br/>
Locating Lyric to target his corpse regardless of where it is in the zone.<br/>
Then you would play this song and summon yourself (*squisha*) to that<br/>
corpse.  The catch is that this song would be only a trinket though unless<br/>
Verant added the feature that this *one song* did not cancel Invis or Invis<br/>
vs. Undead.  This would give us a similar ability to Necros with much more<br/>
danger to the bard (Verant would like that), plus it would be useless in<br/>
some high level dungeons and the Planes where everything can see you<br/>
regardless.  This, therefore, would not lessen the need for a Necro in those<br/>
really sticky situations like Planes and Dragon corpse retrievals.<br/>

&gt; would be perfect ;)<br/>
&gt; &quot;Talies&#39; Dance of the Dead - targetted corpse, if within range<br/>
&gt; (limited to<br/>
&gt; about 100 feet or so, of course) gets up and walks to it&#39;s owner (Owner<br/>
&gt; must be within &quot;heal&quot; range of the Bard)&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This would be great for lava and &quot;stuck in the wall&quot; retrievals,<br/>
&gt; but not as<br/>
&gt; powerful as the Necro summoning. Additionally, Necros could get this as a<br/>
&gt; spell at a lower level, giving them a little more power, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a thought...<br/>
