&gt; Personally, my biggest gripe with /loc is that t considerably reduces the<br/>
&gt; value of sense heading.  I guess it also reduces the value of bards, since<br/>
&gt; many people hit /loc just before dying, and therefore don&#39;t need our help<br/>
&gt; finding their corpses.  In game, when someone asks me directions to a place,<br/>
&gt; I will give them compass headings or directions along the paths, even when<br/>
&gt; I know they&#39;re after coordinates.  I&#39;m just mean, I guess.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll say the same thing I told a guildmate who is mapping<br/>
the zones.  Maps are nice, but nothing beats just plain<br/>
knowing the terrain and topology.  You could drop me anywhere<br/>
in Butcherblock, North Ro, Oasis, the Commonlands, or Misty<br/>
Thicket and I would just *know* where I am, no need for a map.  <br/>
I&#39;m almost to that point with Greater Faydark, Steamfont,<br/>
South Ro, the Karanas, and Kithicor.<br/>
<br/>
Most everyone I meet is impressed when I tell them which trees<br/>
or landmarks to use to set up a running vector directly from<br/>
one place to another (just hit autorun and go get something to<br/>
eat).  You don&#39;t learn this type of stuff from /loc or maps.  <br/>
You learn it by playing the game.  So while /loc does diminish<br/>
the roleplaying nature of the game, it is by no means the<br/>
ultimate in terms of in-game navigation.  I&#39;ll note that in<br/>
the real world, the places where GPS is most useful are out at<br/>
sea and in the air, where landmarks are not readily available.<br/>
