<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074397838"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I was curious if anyone had had any luck getting quest items that went<br/>
&gt; into the Quest Black Hole (i.e. you gave the right items, but got<br/>
&gt; nothing back) back.  I&#39;m asking because a friend had this happen with<br/>
&gt; his crafted gauntlets while trying to do the resize quest.  The Guide<br/>
&gt; (I&#39;m assuming it was a newer or lower level guide, not a senior) told<br/>
&gt; him that there was nothing that they could do, after making him wait<br/>
&gt; for almost an hour (but that&#39;s another gripe) and that there was no GM<br/>
&gt; on anyway.  Is there any chance he might get his gauntlets back?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No chance. There&#39;s no way to verify that the quest was done<br/>
properly or done at all.</div>
