<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056093085">This is fact.  I too am wearing a Grotesque mask and would like to loose it<br/>
in favor of something better.  However, I still wear it in battle at this<br/>
point - I believe it&#39;s better than nothing in that slot.  A couple of items<br/>
often suggested are the Guise of the Deciever and Platinum Star Ruby Veil.<br/>
The Guise is very nice with AC 4, CHA +13 and SV vs. Magic +7, and it gives<br/>
unlimited charges of Illusion: Dark Elf, which can come in handy from time<br/>
to time over and beyond befuddling newbies.  The Platinum Star Ruby Veil is<br/>
CHA +9 and DEX +9, which is not bad either.  The Guise you have to get from<br/>
a dungeon yourself, while the veil can be made by a talented jeweler.<br/>
<br/>
Any other face suggestions folks?<br/>

&gt; Ok I am curently useing a Grotesk mask. Its +7 dex and -7 cha I<br/>
&gt; think. Well<br/>
&gt; I have been told by 2 different people to lose the mask because for are<br/>
&gt; lullaby song it will resist less if we have a high cha. Is this a<br/>
&gt; total bull<br/>
&gt; rumor or fact? </span></blockquote></div>
