 </span></blockquote>  Matt, nothing wrong with bellow.  Except you stop using it around<br/>
  L30 or so.  I havent memmed bellow in 20 levels, no joke.  It was<br/>
  cool and useful in it&#39;s time, but you as a bard are much more <br/>
  talented at other things by L30 to continue to use bellow.  But<br/>
  sure enough I see L35 bards bellowing their hearts out in a group.<br/>
  (most likely twinks, who dont know any better)<br/>
