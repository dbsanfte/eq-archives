<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631403046">I had just the opposite experience in MM this weekend.  A guild brother (level 50 warrior) decided he wanted a Lambent BP for his wife to be (level something bard, with no BP though) and recruited me and my brother&#39;s druid (level 45).  We started by spending about 30 minutes in Lower Guk getting 2 Basalt Carapaces (dropped on the 4th & 5th gargoyle!  when I got my BP, it took about 20 or so!).  We then ported over to MM, picked up a level 50 Shaman and proceeded to slowly fight our way into the castle.  No problems pulling singles at level 48 from there...  A combination of level 48 agro, wolf form, and lament got us 100% singles (yeah, my brother&#39;s druid tried harmony, but he still pulled 2 so we kicked him out as the puller).  We set up camp in the foyer of the castle and I proceeded to pull the dance hall.  2  out of the 4 gypsies had lutes (both gypsy lutes) and both had werewolf talons, so we had enough for 2 crafted BPs and two lambent BPs in under an hour of work total.  We<br/>
should have stuck around for another spawn to see if we could have gotten some drums, but we didn&#39;t want to push our luck and were sick of fighting greenies.  They must have REALLY made the armor quests much easier or we just got incredibly lucky.  When I did the quests for my BP and my wife&#39;s crafted BP (almost 20 levels ago :) ), it took maybe 5 hours to get the lute and the talon and about the same to get a basalt carapace.  This time in under an hour we had enough for 2 of each!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; So then, Sunday morning I go to camp MM with a ranger in our guild.  She want Hooded Black Cloak (who doesn&#39;t) and needs a Butler fang so she can get her level 48 spell.  I did not know until then that you need to turn in an EBW for the ranger spell - now there is some irony - a spell for a sword - heh. WARNING: All those who been camping maid/butler and dont have your stuff yet - STOP reading this NOW! Otherwise you are gonna be very sad.  We camped the butler for a couple hours and got like 3 butler fangs and a maids fang.  Maybe 2 of each - I cant remember exactly.  And then we were gonna move down to the Caitliff spot and wait for him.  Well, on the way thru the main ballroom, the ranger agro&#39;d something so i started fighting it with her and yelled for the mage to come back and help us (he had some brains and was going down the secret hall).  Well, he got back and by then we had several mobs and were fighting.  I am hoping he will cast a pet and we can kill this stuff when I hear<br/>
&gt; him say &quot;RUN&quot; and when I look around they are both gone.  Heh.  Well, I fear the 4 werewolves, 2 or 3 gypsys, 3 or 4 misc silver plated things and try to run but get turned around.  Eventually, I just find a nice spot in the main ballroom and die there.  Wake up in qeynos again - dang forgot to rebind.  Get ressed (by a different cleric) and say farewell to Mistmoore for a while.   Later on, I hear that they eventually got a total of 6 fangs from MM that day.  I did manage to get 2 werewolf talons (my wiz looted one too) and made a crafted BP later. </span></blockquote></div>
