<b>Subject:</b> Song Analysis Statistics? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-852933916">Rokenn, very good job on the song analysis web site.  I must say I am<br/>
pleased to finally see a great source of information about bard songs,<br/>
especially one that is continuously updated and revised.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I was REALLY hoping to find in the song analysis database<br/>
was more information about the actual damage statistics caused by DoT<br/>
songs such as CoD and DDD with instruments and without.  Considering I<br/>
rarely use weapons any more except in certain circumstances, knowing the<br/>
damage that I am doing with these songs would help me better evaluate<br/>
which is better to use in a given situation.<br/>
<br/>
I know that you can get a friend to duel you and do the tests on them but<br/>
it would help to know the damage formula, especially when the damage<br/>
increases with levels.<br/>
<br/>
I am really surprised the damage statistics have been so hard to find<br/>
considering that when it comes to weapons and spells, the amount of damage<br/>
they each can do in a set time is how everyone compares them.  (Throw in<br/>
mana used versus damage caused for spells of course)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has more information on this I would greatly appreciate it if<br/>
you could post it or point me to a URL containing it.<br/>
