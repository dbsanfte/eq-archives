<div id="ygrps-yiv-977783547">aye hero bracer is quite nice.  i bought one for our in-game husband as a<br/>
wedding gift (my gift was a second ykesha woohoo!) and it cost me 3000pp.<br/>
did not want to spend a week or two building faction, AND thank god because<br/>
not only can a wood elf as myself not wear it (i tried to hehe) but i heard<br/>
we can not complete the quest either.<br/>

&gt; The Hero Bracer is far better than the Lambent bracer in my <br/>
&gt; opinion, that is<br/>
&gt; if you are of the size race who can wear it, but it is lore <br/>
&gt; so I see myself<br/>
&gt; wearing a combination of 1 hero bracer and 1 lambent for a <br/>
&gt; combined total AC<br/>
&gt; and bonuses of AC18 STR+14 CHA+1 DIS+10 POI+10 WT6.5 just for <br/>
&gt; 2 bracers!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just something else to consider if any of you half-elf or <br/>
&gt; hummie bards have<br/>
&gt; not thought of it yet.<br/>
