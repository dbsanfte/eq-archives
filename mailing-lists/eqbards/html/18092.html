harder when dual wielding Evensong and 6note.  The key to beating him is<br/>
to make sure everyone is poison and magic resist buffed beforehand,<br/>
keeping casters/clerics out of melee range at all possible times, and<br/>
preventing him from flying around uncontrolled.  The last is accomplished<br/>
by making sure the nukers hold fire until he&#39;s at 66% of his health.<br/>
