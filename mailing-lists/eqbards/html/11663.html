<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877116900">Yesterday I wrote an email to Geoffrey Zatkin regarding Lullaby and Pixie<br/>
Strike and received a brief reply.  I&#39;ll post the Arch Mage&#39;s replay first,<br/>
since I know it&#39;s what everyone wants to see.  My email to him follows.<br/>

Zatkin&#39;s computer date is at least one day ahead, as I received the email<br/>
from him on Friday (10.12.99) morning after having sent my mail on Thursday<br/>
(9.12.99) afternoon.  The time is likely correct at 9:32pm as I had checked<br/>
my email as late as 7:00pm on Thursday.<br/>

&gt; I have our testing department checking this out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be aware, however, that higher level creatures save<br/>
&gt; better against these spells then lower level ones do.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for a wonderful game.  As a 35 year old professional programmer<br/>
myself, I have a very good idea of what it takes to design and complete an<br/>
effort as massive as EverQuest.  Verant has done an outstanding job.<br/>
<br/>
Is there someone at Verant in Testing/QA/QC that would be more appropriate<br/>
to send email to regarding testing the subtleties of Bard songs?<br/>
<br/>

--------<br/>
<br/>
In recent email communications between you and another Bardic player, you<br/>
indicated that there have been no changes to the level 15 Bard song &quot;Kelin&#39;s<br/>
Lucid Lullaby&quot;.  As a 37th level Bard with a great deal of experience with<br/>
this song I can assure you that its behavior has changed.  The change in the<br/>
song has been felt by Bards at all levels, it&#39;s not merely my personal<br/>
perception of the song&#39;s having changed for me over time.  In fact the same<br/>
behavioral changes have effected the level 28 song &quot;Crission&#39;s Pixie<br/>
Strike&quot;.  The changes feel unintentional, as the success/resist messages<br/>
that we receive no longer correctly correspond to mob behavior as they used<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
I explain the behavior of Pixie Strike first as it&#39;s easier to explain and<br/>
to test.  Lullaby&#39;s behavior is the same, except for a radius and multiple<br/>
mobs:<br/>
<br/>
PIXIE STRIKE:<br/>
Very often if you attempt to mesmerize a mob with Pixie Strike you will<br/>
receive a blue &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; message indicating a success, and yet the<br/>
mob will attack in its next round as though it resisted.  Repeatedly<br/>
successfully Pixie Striking a mob will increase the chances of the song<br/>
&quot;taking hold&quot;.  After some 3-5 successful Pixie Strikes, the mob will in<br/>
fact be mezzed.  After a single successful mez, mob behavior begins to<br/>
correctly correspond to the success/resist messages that you receive.  One<br/>
way to test this song would be to buff yourself to level 30 or so and<br/>
attempt to mez a blue mob in Runnyeye, Sol A or Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
LULLABY:<br/>
Using Lullaby against very low level mobs such as can be found in newbie<br/>
zones or BlackBurrow this song will successfully &quot;nod&quot; many or all mobs in<br/>
its radius.  A very large percentage of those mobs will attack in their next<br/>
round despite zero resist messages.  Iteratively applying this song to the<br/>
same mobs yields increasingly &quot;correct&quot; results.  In other words if I play<br/>
the song for 8 mobs, all 8 might &quot;nod&quot; without resist messages but 5 will,<br/>
in their next round, turn to me and deliver attacks as though they resisted.<br/>
The next pulse of the song might &quot;nod&quot; all mobs again, but only 3 will<br/>
deliver attacks in their next round, etc.  Using this song as we did before<br/>
it changed (similarly to the way an Enchanter might use Mesmerization) is<br/>
impossible, as the Bard is placed high on the aggro list of the unoccupied<br/>
mobs, and yet they are not &quot;mezzed&quot; despite success messages.  This new<br/>
behavior of lullaby generally leads to swift death at the hands of multiple<br/>
mobs, so very few of the highly competent bards that I know and converse<br/>
with in-game and via the &quot;eqbards&quot; email list at onelist.com even attempt to<br/>
use this song any longer.  One way to test this song would be to buff<br/>
yourself to level 25 or so and play it for the green mobs in Kerra Isle or<br/>
Blackburrow.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you sincerely for your time and the great game.  If I can be of<br/>
further assistance please let me know.<br/>
