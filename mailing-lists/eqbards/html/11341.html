&gt; I wasn&#39;t saying Lullaby is only good for interrupting casters, I was<br/>
&gt; saying it is awesome for it. I&#39;ve seen the song work in the last 3 weeks<br/>
&gt; several times effectively, so I&#39;m not able to pin down why it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; working for others. Sorry for the confusion, my intent was to point out<br/>
&gt; the song has at least a two-fold use. I wouldn&#39;t solo a cleric that<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t green to me, and as such it doesn&#39;t really matter if he tries to<br/>
&gt; hit me or not, so long as he can&#39;t cast. I often pull casters with<br/>
&gt; debuff, so by the time he gets to me he&#39;s sans bravery, guard, o&#39;kiel&#39;s<br/>
&gt; radiation, etc. anyways. ;P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just curious as to why you would use lullaby instead of pixie strike to<br/>
interrupt casters?  I have fantastic luck using strike for that purpose, but<br/>
occasionally the timing will get off and I lose a bubble in a single cast, never<br/>
fun.  Haven&#39;t tried lullaby for quite a while - have you tested both and found<br/>
lullaby to be more useful?  Either way, guess I&#39;ll give it a try...<br/>
