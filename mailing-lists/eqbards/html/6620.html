<b>Subject:</b> Selo&#39;s and SOW experiment and a bit on Koalindl Fish <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113888554">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I tried a little experiment last night with SOW and Selo&#39;s.  I had a<br/>
Shaman (9th level) cast SOW while I was playing Selo&#39;s.  SOW did NOT<br/>
override Selo&#39;s.  Both Icons stayed up on my screen, and I still got &#39;Your<br/>
feet move faster messages&#39;, and ran at Selo&#39;s speed.  However, once I<br/>
stopped Selo&#39;s, SOW took over, and I could not restart Selo&#39;s speed.  I got<br/>
the same thing, song visuals, but no message, and no extra speed, with drum<br/>
or without.  So, if you are playing Selo&#39;s when SOW is cast on you, you can<br/>
still run at full speed, but, if you turn it off, you are now stuck.  Also,<br/>
from my experience of the last 2 nights, the difference between the length<br/>
of a 19th level SOW and a 9th level SOW is about 2 times.  Night before last<br/>
SOW from a 19th lasted over half an hour, near to 45 minutes.  The 9th level<br/>
SOW last night lasted just about 20 to 25 minutes.  Luckily last night I was<br/>
just playing around, and not out trying to kill stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the Koalindl Fish - possible spoilers, so obligatory space<br/>

Last night, some guildmates and I were attempting various ways of obtaining<br/>
Koalindl Fish without taking that faction hit.  Well, if the guard is in the<br/>
water, you cannot kill a fish without the guard fighting.  We came up with<br/>
an idea for me to kite the guard out, and zone, but I had been playing<br/>
around with SOW, and was still under it&#39;s affect.  Well, ok, I can still<br/>
make it, since it is left, left, right, left, zone from the water.<br/>
Unfortunately, there was always a wandering guard there, and I did not want<br/>
to take the risk of getting stunned and beat by two guards from the get-go.<br/>
<br/>
So, we started talking to the guard in the water.  I don&#39;t remember his<br/>
name, but he has a quest he wants you to do.  Seems that the Barbarian&#39;s<br/>
wolf, from west K,   Frostbite, comes into town, and sucks up Koalindl fish.<br/>
Somehow you are supposed to retrieve a fish from it, i think.<br/>
<br/>
Well, two of us rendevoused out in the Barbarian village in West K, and<br/>
found Frostbite.  Mcmannus stands just within aggro range at times, so you<br/>
have to watch him, and make sure he leaves.  Also, another wandering<br/>
Barbarian walks around near the pen on an irregular basis.  After both Barbs<br/>
were clear, I took Frostbite for a bit of a run, to get him away from the<br/>
camp, and proceeded to solo him.  Easy fight at 17th level, using<br/>
dirk/barbed whip/songs.  But, no fish.  Just a ruined wolf pelt.  so my<br/>
guildmate shows up, we wait a bit, new spawn, let the barbs run off, and he<br/>
nukes the wolf.  Same thing, ruined wolf pelt.  So, there is something more<br/>
to getting Frostbite to have a fish on his corpse, or another way to get it<br/>
from him, without killing him.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
