level instead of 10-12 every 5 levels.  So the other classes do not have an<br/>
increased rate of new spells.  They just get them spread out instead of<br/>
clumped together.<br/>

spells every 5 levels.  I always liked the Bard&#39;s one song per level style.<br/>
You always get something new at each level.<br/>
