 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one of the oddest things I&#39;ve seen.  Enchanters are awesome alongside<br/>
bards.  Sure you can&#39;t use your &quot;Standard&quot; songs but working around an<br/>
enchanter&#39;s strengths, and enhancing them in some cases, is a good thing.  I<br/>
find it fun and enjoyable.  Enchanters love having me with them and vice<br/>
versa.  I really don&#39;t think there&#39;s any &quot;personality type&quot; that&#39;s<br/>
incompatible with bards. ;)<br/>

Yer a bard, be versatile.  Thats one of OUR strengths.</div>
