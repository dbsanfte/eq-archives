  those lame-o coders would do.  At least it doesn&#39;t look like a <br/>
  bag on my hand, god I hated that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The guy that looted Evensong from you better owe you a lot. :/<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Well, I can only really give my perspective.  The guy that took<br/>
  it is a very well known, well respected leader on our server.<br/>
  He and I get along very well.<br/>
<br/>
  That said...<br/>
<br/>
  People who accidentally loot very important nodrop items are likely<br/>
  to find themselves not ever looting again.  I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve<br/>
  ever seen it done until that night, as people are usually very good<br/>
  at looting appropriately.  One poor cleric accidentally looted the<br/>
  crown from Tranix one night, and he caught major hell for it.  He<br/>
  wasn&#39;t a bad guy, in fact he&#39;s an incredible cleric.  But the accident<br/>
  cost several enchanters a new headpiece.  It&#39;s nothing more than <br/>
  irritating I guess you could put it.<br/>
<br/>
  I was invited into the Plane by a separate group than the group he<br/>
  was in.  I didn&#39;t realize this at first.  Apparently, his team was<br/>
  breaking out hate, and another team came in behind them (the team<br/>
  who requested me up there).  So there was definitely bad blood to<br/>
  start things off, although the two teams cooperated eventually.<br/>
<br/>
  The Plane of Hate can be shared.  In fact, it will be in the future.<br/>
  We had over 50 people in there and it was lag free.  You just have <br/>
  to take the teams to two different areas.  SE and SW, or SW and NW,<br/>
  or whichever.<br/>
<br/>
  To make a long story short, it was my assumption that he and his<br/>
  team were disgusted with the fact that the team I was with was<br/>
  even on the planes after they had reserved it.  As soon as I<br/>
  approached the Maestro corpse, the person in question bent down,<br/>
  and the corpse disappeared.  He stated he accidentally looted it<br/>
  and never apologized at all.  In fact no one did from the other<br/>
  team.  It&#39;s all really suspicious.  And while they didn&#39;t have to<br/>
  let anyone loot it.  We had been sharing nodrops the whole night.<br/>
  I just hope that he didn&#39;t do it on purpose.  I&#39;m trying to believe<br/>
  that he didn&#39;t, because I really respect the guy.<br/>
