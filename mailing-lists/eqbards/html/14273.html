<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-858788704">Job well done Harmonic, again! One of the things that is bugging the<br/>
hell out of me is zoning crashes. I have NEVER crashed so many times<br/>
just  trying to zone. Seems that almost every time I zone, but really<br/>
ever time I really NEED to zone and get on with my travels or what<br/>
ever, zip back to the log in server or worse all the way back to the<br/>
desktop. Nothing worse then your group got hit with more then it could<br/>
chew and ya have to hit the zone like a girly and get smacked by the<br/>
desktop! LOL! Never, since Beta 3 and 4 have I had so many zoning<br/>
crashes as now. Back then you never knew when you zoned if you would<br/>
ever see that character again and I guess that is a feeling I still<br/>
experiance to be honest. Technicly, I can not see the big problem<br/>
moving from one xy cord to another xy cord. Should not be such a<br/>
problem but it is it seems. At least to Verant. All your points are<br/>
most valid and right on target. Thank you for all your effort to put it<br/>
all together. I, for one appreciate it .<br/>
