<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-37868167">I briefly mentioned this the other day but it didn&#39;t generate any response<br/>
so I&#39;ll throw it out again.  Based on the recent statements by GZ, there are<br/>
a couple of strikes working against us in regards to the Pixie Strike song.<br/>
First off, because it has two effects (mezmerize plus magic resist debuff),<br/>
mobs have an increased chance to resist it.  This is similar to how CoD and<br/>
DDD work.  CoD only has one effect (AE DOT) while DDD has two (AE DOT and AC<br/>
debuff).  Mobs resist DDD a lot more than CoD.  Example: I can regularly get<br/>
CoD to stick against ogre bouncers (with a very high MR).  I don&#39;t even<br/>
waste my time trying to get DDD to stick.  Second strike is the second<br/>
resist check mobs get against pixie strike (and lullaby).<br/>
<br/>
When you combine the higher chance to resist because pixie strike has two<br/>
effects plus the two chances to resist the song outright, this song is not<br/>
reliable as we would like it to be.  I propose we submit a petition to<br/>
Verant requesting that they nerf pixie strike and remove the magic resist<br/>
debuff.  In this case, the nerf would be an actual improvement in the songs<br/>
utility.  The mobs still get a second chance to resist but the base resist<br/>
chance is lower because they are only resisting one effect (mezmerize).<br/>

PS  Can someone confirm when the MR debuff aspect of pixie strike was added<br/>
to the song?  IIRC, some of you have posted that it was not originally a<br/>
part of the song but was secretly added with a patch a few months ago.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Actually its 49.75%  That&#39;s the original 25% plus 33% of the remaining 75%<br/>
&gt; (24.75%) for a total of nearly 50%.  Its still ugly.<br/>

&gt; OK I got one for Dean and John.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all know that mobs get a second resist check against pixie strike and<br/>
&gt; lullaby.  Lets say for the first check they get a 25% (1 out of 4) chance<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; resist and a 33% (1 out of 3) chance for the second resist.  Whats the<br/>
&gt; overall chance that they make just one of the two resists?<br/>
