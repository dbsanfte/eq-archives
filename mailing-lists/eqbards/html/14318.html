<div id="ygrps-yiv-58042375">Actually, I&#39;m in a perm group of guys that have known each other for years and<br/>
years.  I actually work with 4 of them :)<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I can never get him to hotkey a &#39;I&#39;m gonna mez, stop<br/>
singing!&quot; button.<br/>
<br/>
The button he has is, &quot;I have mezzed, don&#39;t wake them up!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a WEE bit too late...<br/>
<br/>
But, with enough browbeating over lunch, I&#39;ll prevail!  I hope...<br/>
<br/>
We have a guild, btw, called Bitter Strength, that only includes our<br/>
characters...Say Hi if you&#39;re ever on Sol Ro :)<br/>

 know I should remake the thread but... I DON&#39;T WANNA.. I feel better now.<br/>
<br/>
If you are serious Golias the simplest and best answer really is to talk to the<br/>
enchanter about it, after all your going to draw most of the attention anway.<br/>
However if you really don&#39;t feel like talking about it and just want to do it<br/>
adjust your song list to take out DDD and do something like CD,Psalm (heat or<br/>
cold),Hymn.  Ask the Enchanter to mez after the line of wince messages.  So far<br/>
that&#39;s been the only way I&#39;ve been able to do it.  If there is an enchanter I<br/>
usually either join the melee or use instruments to buff and heal</div>
