&gt;This sounds like you&#39;re on a 1800+ server, and thus a complaint about<br/>
&gt;that, rather than not enough places to go. If Verant had stuck to their<br/>
&gt;original 1500 max per server (and dispite their denials I remember them<br/>
&gt;stating this in beta. They shut down all the servers but one one day and<br/>
&gt;asked us all to log in specifically to test if the server could take<br/>
&gt;that many) then you wouldn&#39;t have these problems. They now seem to be<br/>
&gt;relying on people sticking it out until the expansion when they can hope<br/>
&gt;that the current server populations will be more comfortable with the<br/>
&gt;addition of the extra zones but personally I think their reluctance to<br/>
&gt;put new servers online in a timely manner will hurt them in the long<br/>
&gt;run.<br/>
