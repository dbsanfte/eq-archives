<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hmmm, my last post didn&#39;t seem to go through, so here it is again...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Woo HOo...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From the sony boards<br/>
&gt; ==================================================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This thread will need to be closed due to its size soon. When someone<br/>
&gt; reposts the issue, I&#39;d prefer it if you could remove the items that we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; commented on, or at least indicate its status.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve gotten word on many of the issues from various members of the team:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Purity and Vitality are fixed in code. It should be live now. If it isn&#39;t,<br/>
&gt; it is on test and will be live at the next client patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kellin&#39;s has been referred to our testing department.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lyssa&#39;s Concord is confirmed and agreed as bug. The client programmer has<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s Constant Chain is in testing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Angstlich&#39;s Appauling Screech: Fear spells do not cause NPCs to stop<br/>
&gt; casting. Works as intended.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Solidarity of Vision: Works as intended.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Johthan&#39;s Provocation: We&#39;ve reduced the fizzle rate and added the<br/>
message.<br/>
&gt; Remainder works as intended. Changes are live.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Niv&#39;s: Works as intended.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Song of Travel: Opinions requested and placed on the board. I believe the<br/>
&gt; consensus was to remove the invis component, yes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Largo&#39;s: Range has been increased. Changes are live. Still looking into<br/>
PvP<br/>
&gt; behavior.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nillipus&#39;: Works as intended currently. We&#39;re open to removing the damage<br/>
&gt; shield component if you wish. Thoughts?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Song of Twilight: Works as intended.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Assonant Strain: fixed as requested.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bombastic Bellow: Fixed and live.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The &quot;Broken Quest Issues&quot; are not broken quests. They are preexisting<br/>
&gt; stories for future expansion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Kunark Armor&quot;: Well my list says &quot;fixed&quot; but I don&#39;t have what they ment<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; that. If any changes have been made they would be live.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s it for this installment<br/>
