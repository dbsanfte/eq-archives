<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919473817">I think the better analogy would be - you go to your favorite amusement<br/>
park - that had your favorite roller coaster - that you had been riding for<br/>
six months - and with no prior warning or explanation - the Heartbreak<br/>
Inducing - Super Exciting - Mega-Roller Coaster is replaced with a<br/>
kiddy-ride.<br/>
<br/>
When you complain about it - they initially say that there was no change to<br/>
the roller coaster.  When you show them pictures of the old and new one -<br/>
they say they&#39;ll look into it.  After six months of no response - they come<br/>
back and tell you that the original roller coaster was way too scary - that<br/>
the other customers who didn&#39;t like roller coasters - but preferred the<br/>
twist-o-whirl - were complaining that the roller coaster was too exciting in<br/>
comparison - and had to be toned down - so there twist-o-whirl was the most<br/>
exciting ride in the park...<br/>

At 01:44 PM 10/11/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>why isn&#39;t working as intended a valid response?  that&#39;s like going to an<br/>
amusement park, riding a roller coaster and saying, well my idea of a roller<br/>
coaster is different, it should have 2 more corkscrews and a loop and<br/>
expecting<br/>
the amusement park to reconstruct it to match your specifications.  if you<br/>
don&#39;t like it, ride another ride (try another class) or if you really don&#39;t<br/>
like it,<br/>
don&#39;t go to the park anymore (cancel your account).  but either way, it&#39;s a<br/>
waste<br/>
of time and energy to keep ranting about it afterwards.<br/>
