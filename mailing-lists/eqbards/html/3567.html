<div id="ygrps-yiv-718159784">You know the more I think about it, how about an npc ressurection service.<br/>
for the low price of one bubble of xp you can be ressurected right back to<br/>
your corpse.  The lower level players, who find binding the biggest pain,<br/>
would find this price the most acceptable.  Sounds like something the Priest<br/>
of Discord would enjoy, give me some of your life force and I will ressurect<br/>
you, heh heh.  I think I would gladly part with a bubble of experience to be<br/>
ressurected when I die thru simple misfortune far from my binding place, and<br/>
would still be trying like heck to get some itinerant mage to bind me  at<br/>
the same time for planned adventures.<br/>

&quot;Its fun to get xp, even the second time around;<br/>
  running naked thru the Karanas is not fun&quot;<br/>

Well, I don&#39;t particularly want my bard to be able to bind - I don&#39;t mind<br/>
finding or waiting for a caster - my problem is WHERE noncasters can be<br/>
bound.<br/>
<br/>
As someone pointed out earlier - it tends to make folks much less likely to<br/>
explore the world - course he was happy bout that - only 10 folks in his<br/>
dungeon whereas places like BB and CB are bursting at the seams.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want folks to get out an explore, you don&#39;t penalize them<br/>
with half hour - hour - sometimes longer &#39;downtime&#39;, just to get back to<br/>
their corpse.<br/>

&gt;It was decided early on that all casting classes (not hybrids) would have<br/>
&gt;Gate, and only a couple classes would have Bind Affinity.  As a matter of<br/>

&gt;After a lot of heated debate, the spell was given to all pure casters, and<br/>

&gt;the way it does now.  The idea of inns or static NPC&#39;s that could bind was<br/>

&gt;<br/>

&gt;But in the name of  the holy grail of &quot;playability&quot;, the experience loss<br/>

&gt;folks bypass the built in training curve via various methods, leaving them<br/>
&gt;at moderately high levels with very deficient play skills (and character<br/>
&gt;skills).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Those folks tended to die a lot more often than was necessary all of a<br/>
&gt;sudden, and watching that exp bar keep dropping was pretty discouraging,<br/>
&gt;especially when you didn&#39;t learn from your mistakes.  And there are the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;still persist.  After a bit of this, people start to  vote with their feet.<br/>
&gt;And since the bulk of the player base fell into this category in one way or<br/>
&gt;another, from a business standpoint it was suicidal to stand by design<br/>
&gt;principles in this case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With the success of EQ, I&#39;m hoping the existing player base will in the<br/>
&gt;future be educated enough about RPGs in general, and Verant quirks in<br/>
&gt;specific, so that when EQ2 rolls out, the bar can be raised in terms of<br/>
&gt;experience and rate of progression/regression.  Hitting the level cap in 45<br/>
&gt;days is appalling to me.  Hitting it in 120 days, no matter how dedicated a<br/>
&gt;player you are, still makes me twitch and drool some.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the case of Bind Affinity, there&#39;s more than enough bind capable players<br/>

&gt;12th or 14th level is on, and those few casters that reach it first are<br/>
&gt;heavily in demand..but only for a matter of days or even hours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is still a strong balancing factor.  Synergy.  Interaction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, you ask, why did I compare the experience loss changes to giving Bind<br/>
&gt;Affinity to everyone, either by spell or by NPC&#39;s?  Well, both rank right<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;What I would like to see is an NPC that could bind for a fee, and limit<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;class based binding to one of a few classes. The advantage that the<br/>
&gt;class/es<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;would have is the ability to bind themselves away from a city, which is<br/>

&gt;of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;being able to explore the world safely.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Actually, that would make a heckuva lot of sense. J.M., mebbe you could<br/>
&gt;&gt; suggest this idea:<br/>
&gt;&gt; Inn-running NPC&#39;s could, when given the proper coin, cast a &quot;bind&quot; spell<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;&gt; a player. To determine the cost, hail the Innkeeper, and ask the cost for<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&gt; night.  It would make sense, RP-wise, and if you made it cost, say 1<br/>
 </span></blockquote>plat,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; players could still undercut the merchants, but other players wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;&gt; SOL.  This would still encourage players to work together to get bound in<br/>
&gt;&gt; certain areas (not every zone has an Inn, most Inns are inconvenient at<br/>
&gt;&gt; best. Certain Inns have associated hazards...), but allow travelers to<br/>
&gt;feel<br/>
&gt;&gt; safer traveling.<br/>
