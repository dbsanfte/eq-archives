<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871098028">Uhh like I said, our &#39;skills&#39; Parry and Riposte<br/>
didn&#39;t come till 53<br/>
<br/>
NOBODY made 53 during the beta ;)  At least none of the bards did.<br/>
<br/>
So there was never a need for a trainer ;p<br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;Why do the others have them&quot;<br/>
If I had to hazard a guess:  Because there are a shitload more of them than<br/>
there are bards.  My real answer though is:<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care, really don&#39;t need one there anyway&quot;.  There&#39;s a<br/>
song vendor.  I personally don&#39;t see a need for a bard &quot;Trainer&quot; neither do<br/>
most folks.<br/>
<br/>
HEH that&#39;s the last time I answer a question here.  Tired of the flames.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; So...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; why was it ok for the bard testers to take the boat back to the old world<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; train but it wasn&#39;t ok for the Druids and the Paladins and the Rangers and<br/>
&gt; the Warriors and the Enchanters and the Magicians and the Wizards... ???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What plethora of post 50 skills necessitated the trainers for them?<br/>

&gt; There is a Bard Song Vendor in Kunark.  There aren&#39;t any trainers because<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t get any skills after 50 (till 53).  Those skills that were thrown<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; were an AFTER THOUGHT (emphasis mine) and the bards in the beta just went<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; kelethin on the elven boat (or grabbed a gate/port) to train.<br/>
