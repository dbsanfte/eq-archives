<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481118680">Hehehehehe Corpse Retrival....<br/>
<br/>
When Kunark was fairly new I got paid 200p by an FOH(A very powerful guild)<br/>
wizard to drag her corpse out of the froggie area in Firona Vie.  I never<br/>
felt more powerful in my life :-)<br/>
<br/>
Until yesterday...<br/>
<br/>
Just dinged 52 (no Song of Twilight) and I&#39;m in the hand camp in Karnors<br/>
with SK, Monk (great puller, this guy made us wonder why anyone wants<br/>
enchanters), Cleric, Shaman, and Rogue.  Monk pulls 2 decayed prisoners (he<br/>
started intentionally pulling 2 since we would kill them faster with me<br/>
charming).  We screw up the room timer (in other words I forgot to look at<br/>
my watch) and of course a Construct of Sathir (53 SK mob, very high magic<br/>
resist, very nasty) pops in the room.  Shaman gets slow resisted 5 times (we<br/>
know it will eventually stick).  I am mezzing the 2 prisoners.  Shaman is<br/>
OOM, cleric LOM and Construct is ripping the SK a new one (I have no idea<br/>
why it didnt agro on shaman, I guess SK went ballistic with spells).  We are<br/>
in trouble, so we call for switch with me mezzing the construct (Sk said no<br/>
DOT&#39;s on it) and them killing the prisoners.  Probably not a good idea, as I<br/>
was able to keep the construct locked up (taking every song pulse), but the<br/>
SK and Monk die to the prisoners (everyone totally OOM now). But, I manage<br/>
to hold the CoS mezzed long enough for another hand to pop.  I charm the<br/>
hand and do a small circle charm kite (with rogue backstabbing away on the<br/>
CoS, he does a TON of damage).  2 Sup heals (shaman got a slow to stick<br/>
finally. which is good since it summons) later, we have a dead COnstruct and<br/>
a half dead hand.  Which I have no trouble mezzing (and mezzing the curate<br/>
who wandered in) till the clerics meds up, rez&#39;s the 2 fallen, and the rez<br/>
effects wear off.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool encounter...<br/>
<br/>
I would say without a doubt, the shamans&#39;s CHA buff (got me to 183 cha) made<br/>
all the difference...</div>
