Seriously, though, believe it or not, there IS a lot of psychology involved <br/>
in advertising.  True, most of us on this list are probably immune to it&#39;s <br/>
influences, but then we&#39;re not the target audience for the ads, are <br/>
we?  Think of it like this: it&#39;s like a magic trick, where the <br/>
fourteen-year-olds are all standing in front, but the older people know <br/>
that looking from the side let&#39;s them see the wires.  Once you know it&#39;s a <br/>
trick, you&#39;re not fooled by it anymore.<br/>
