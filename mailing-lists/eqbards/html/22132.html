One can only hope.  Realizing Rokenn has been around the block (and taken<br/>
into the alley and pummeled once or twice), I can understand his cynicism.<br/>
But just maybe....<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does anyone know when the next patch is scheduled?  Can&#39;t do web at<br/>
work = (.<br/>

Title says it all; here&#39;s Absor&#39;s post:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are looking into a few bardic changes. Nothing is set in stone yet on <br/>
this, it still has to be reviewed, but I thought I&#39;d let you know what we&#39;re<br/>
<br/>
thinking about. We are thinking about reducing secondary resists for <br/>
targeted mesmerize songs (with the possibility of a new song along these <br/>
lines). There are some other potential changes that we are considering, but <br/>
I&#39;ll have to tell you about them after we have a chance to talk them over <br/>
further.<br/>
