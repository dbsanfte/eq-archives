<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169245198">Weird.  When I did it last nite the pet returned to attacking what was<br/>
attacking our cleric.  It was probably because it had been attacking that<br/>
mob before it got &#39;confused&#39; and started attacking the cleric itself.<br/>

Actually it will only switch to another target if that target is attacking<br/>
you, it&#39;s master.  Otherwise it will just stand and/or walk around looking<br/>
dumb ;)  Best way is to /pet back off then /pet kill (after targetting what<br/>
you want it to beat on)<br/>
<br/>
Your pet could care less what&#39;s beating on your party.  It DOES, however<br/>
care what is beating on you.  If nothing is attacking you just doing /pet<br/>
back off won&#39;t do much good (other than to basically have the critter<br/>
&#39;mesmerised&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!!!<br/>

&gt; It happens.  It has happened to me already even in the short time I have<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; charm.  It is easy to fix however.  Just give the &quot;/pet back off&quot; command,<br/>
&gt; and the pet will switch to the target that is attacking the party.<br/>

&gt; Hi all<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been having some fun recently with Solon&#39;s, and spotted something<br/>
&gt; unusual happening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fighting outside the castle in the Dreadlands, our puller was<br/>
&gt; sometimes bringing 2 or 3 back as they appeared along his path.  No<br/>
&gt; problem, I thought, charm a spare 1 and keep it and its friend busy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So off I go, charm a giant, and set it to attack the other one the<br/>
&gt; rest of the party is hitting.  My new friend is happily bashing the<br/>
&gt; other one until it wears off, and then jumps on me.  So charm it<br/>
&gt; again, and lo and behold it suddenly starts hitting my party members.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wait a minute, I think!  Stop it, attack the giant.  But no, it<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t leave my party alone, and then jumped on me when the charm<br/>
&gt; wore off again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Testing this out a little more .... I&#39;ve been playing around lately in<br/>
&gt; Rathe Mountains with my dwarven cleric companion.  He roots them, I<br/>
&gt; chant them to death, it&#39;s great!  Anyway, when we had 2 giants, I<br/>
&gt; charmed 1 and set it to attack the other.  When charm broke, I<br/>
&gt; recharmed and it went straight back to hitting the other giant.  No<br/>
&gt; problem at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anybody else had any little hiccups with charm?  Is it just a<br/>
&gt; Dreadlands thing?  A Kunark thing?  A me thing?  Or don&#39;t they like<br/>
&gt; the kind of music I play! &lt;sniff&gt;<br/>
