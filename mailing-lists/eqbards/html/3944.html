<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998971372">It gets a LOT better in the future. Ever since lvl 30 and up i noticed i<br/>
could start using all those songs that just got me killed asap before.<br/>
Largos was the quickest way for me to kill myself in unrest when i was<br/>
around lvl 20 since one pulse of the song and everything ganked me, nm that<br/>
all the tanks and wizies almost had it dead. Now at lvl 43 im trying out<br/>
all the songs that i wanted to before and finding out that most creatures<br/>
just dont care. They go right on attacking the proper person :)<br/>
<br/>
I just rememberd when i was lvl 20 how discouraged i got over the &#39;Gank the<br/>
bard first&#39; syndrom that most of the mobs seem to suffer from. Now i still<br/>
get attacked a lot, but it seems much more in tune with what everybody else<br/>
has to suffer through. <br/>
