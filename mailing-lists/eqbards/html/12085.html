<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895688235">Hehe - I had some who - when I accidentally left Jig playing after combat -<br/>
thought that IT was the mana song &lt;hehe&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we need to weave Clarity with Jig so they have an icon to look at and<br/>

still get panicy<br/>

but no Clarity<br/>
		icon and they start saying &quot;Mana song!  Mana song!  WTF!?!?&quot;<br/>
