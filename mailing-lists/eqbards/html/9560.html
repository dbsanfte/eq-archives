<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514715856">I think you might be missing the point here. Qeynos Hills, which was the<br/>
other undead spawn area, and Kithicor (to a lesser extent, were mostly for<br/>
newbies btw 4-7 level.  So said newbie in Qeynos heads for his normal<br/>
hunting grounds and BAM, Varsoon the undying hits you for 47pts of damage.<br/>
These 4-7 level players in Qeynos have no other place to hunt. I think they<br/>
have a right to complain that they lost their hunting area.  RV residents<br/>
still have Misty Thicket so should have less to complain about.<br/>
<br/>
No one is whining about dying in a fair fight.  You know when you go into<br/>
Unrest that you are taking your chances. But Q Hills? I am a level 15 Bard<br/>
and made it safely through the Hills only because I had Selo&#39;s and my drum<br/>
equipped.  Incidently, I zoned into the Hills and immediately got hit by<br/>
Varsoon, and this was at about 3 p.m. EQ time on Monday.  It was crawling<br/>
with undead, so during the day there was no respite in the Hills!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Strange, I&#39;ve complained about dying due to all the undead spawns in Unrest<br/>
&gt;at least a hundred times and no on ever listened, why now?  I can&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;fight the undead in Kithicor (err that were in Kithicor) and I think its<br/>
&gt;ridiculous to complain about dying due to them.  I traveled thru during the<br/>
&gt;height of the undead rush yesterday and was never even hit.  A pity that<br/>
&gt;people are so whiny because things are not easy instead of complaining<br/>
