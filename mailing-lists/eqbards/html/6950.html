I do wish they&#39;d implement some sort of linkdead and timestamp<br/>
check so that if you&#39;re only linkdead for a few minutes, this<br/>
no-rent stuff wouldn&#39;t disappear.  We&#39;ve had our party<br/>
stranded in Befallen several times due to the no-rent key<br/>
disappearing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This stops an exploit where you could cast minor illusion,<br/>
intentionally go linkdead, then come back.  You&#39;d still be<br/>
illusioned (and thus stuff wouldn&#39;t attack you), but because<br/>
the client didn&#39;t think you were illusioned, you could move.  <br/>
A needed bugfix, but hardly an enhancement.<br/>
