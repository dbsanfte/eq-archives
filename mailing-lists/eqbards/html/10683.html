&gt;At the risk of sounding like an old coot, you youngins today do not know <br/>
&gt;how<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;easy you have it :)  In my day..... hah<br/>
&gt;And the game is always changing, hopefully more mid level items will by<br/>
&gt;added.  I still crinch when I remember that the day AFTER I spent 220 plat<br/>
&gt;on a Well balanced Rapier, the Ornate Dagger was changed into the Dragoon<br/>
&gt;Dirk.  Then I found that the WB Rapier would only sell back for 45 plat,<br/>
&gt;aarrrrgggghhhhh.  I did manage to trade it for a runed bone fork though :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hee hee, trouble is I&#39;m almost as mature as my server!  I started in late<br/>
&gt;April after all my friends forgot which server to start on and left me <br/>
&gt;alone<br/>
&gt;on Sol Ro.  I was saving up for a WB rapier on the premise it like a <br/>
&gt;combine<br/>
&gt;would be a rental fee.  Fortunately John (tm) saved me from my folly by<br/>
&gt;letting me know in advance it would sell back for so little.  I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt;enough money in my day to buy a better 1HS, but spent it in halves or so on<br/>
&gt;armor that was so much better than what I had compared to moving up from a<br/>
&gt;dirk to an obsidian scimmy.  Maybe I should sell a couple of 150pp+ armor<br/>
&gt;pieces and replace them with bronze to buy an obsidian scimitar.  I&#39;d <br/>
&gt;rather<br/>
&gt;earn it directly as that&#39;s how I got the two weapons I have now, but that<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t possible at my level.  There are no good weapons dropped that a group<br/>
&gt;of my level could get that a bard can use that are better than my dirk.<br/>
&gt;Hmmm, maybe the dirk is the unbalanced part!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I good upgrade to the dirk is the Obsidian Shard.  With a high dex the 30 pt <br/>
DD is a nice plus.  I was still using mine till I got my Runed Falchion this <br/>
weekend. A mid 20 group should be able to get one.<br/>
