Please put this into the petition, although it really should be a separate<br/>
petition in and of itself.<br/>

&quot;Hail Sylvan Brightwater&quot;<br/>
Sylvan Brightwater says, &quot;Hail and wellmet traveler.  I see you are far<br/>
from home.  If you would like, I could bind your essence to this are for a<br/>
mere 5 platinum pieces.&quot;<br/>
&lt;give 5p to npc&gt;<br/>
Sylvan begins to cast a spell. You feel yourself bind to the area.<br/>
<br/>
Talies the Wanderer (hoarse after hours of shouting for a bind :P)<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Give the NPC a special &quot;uberbind&quot; spell that works on anyone, unlike<br/>
the current spell which is &quot;group or self-only&quot;</div>
