<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243864000">Just wanted to share a little tid bit for those of you who have charm...<br/>
<br/>
You may already know this, but if you don&#39;t:<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was hunting in Paw... DEEP Paw, we were going after the Robe.<br/>
A level 37 warrior in a party got charmed by a Rosch and started to beat on<br/>
us with his EXE axe (OUCH!).  I&#39;ve been dying to try this out forever and I<br/>
finally got my chance!!  I switched from Pixieing the Nisch we were fighting<br/>
and targeted our warrior and charmed him!  LOL!  I sent him in to finish off<br/>
the Nisch and then had him sit down after battle.  Just about bust a gut<br/>
laughing so hard.<br/>
<br/>
Just another use for charm :-)<br/>
