<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371710088">Aye, it seemed like his mind was well made up, heh... I had continued to put<br/>
forth my view on things long after I had realized that it was pointless to<br/>
try and convince him just so any other readers of the board out there could<br/>
see the other side.  I don&#39;t want 1 guy knocking bards (even if they make<br/>
fools of themselves doing it) and other people seeing it and maybe being<br/>
swayed by it.  Thank you Silky for backing me up there, so people see it&#39;s<br/>
not just 2 differing opinions.  I hope it&#39;s not too far down the list to not<br/>
get any readership.  Maybe they need a counter on each post... hmmmmmmmmmm<br/>

There is a more recent post on the same board with a new bard requesting<br/>
info.  I responded with the onelist address.... If our membership is only<br/>
300, there has to be at least a 1000 more bards out there that aren&#39;t<br/>
getting the valuable information that&#39;s on this list.  Maybe the moderator<br/>
(I forget who it is right now, heh) could get EQVault to reference the<br/>
onelist URL again to drum up some more membership.  I think the worst thing<br/>
to any class (especially one that&#39;s a little more difficult to understand<br/>
like a Bard) is somebody playing it that doesn&#39;t really know what they&#39;re<br/>
doing.  If it&#39;s the first experience with that class, people they group with<br/>
may just assume that the Class is bad, not the player....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I read that thread, the guy simply didn&#39;t have a clue.  You pointed it out<br/>
&gt;time and again that the bigger the group, the more effective a bard is,<br/>
&gt;and he just refused to see it.  I held off jumping in because he had made<br/>
&gt;up his mind, and no amount of discussion was going to change it.<br/>
