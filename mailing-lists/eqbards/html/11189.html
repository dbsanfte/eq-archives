<div id="ygrps-yiv-891794560">ok so what happened after? =)<br/>
<br/>
would be VERY surprised and impressed if a 50 druid, 44 necro, and 37 bard<br/>
can do the frenzies.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; A few nights ago, <br/>
&gt; a 50 druid,<br/>
&gt; 44 necro and myself (36 bard) went down to camp the frenzied <br/>
&gt; by ourselves<br/>
&gt; (I kinda forced my way into the group).  As we were getting ready to<br/>
&gt; assault the room, a wanderer walked up behind us.  Immediately we were<br/>
&gt; swarmed by 4 frogs we had invis&#39;d our way passed.  I thought <br/>
&gt; the druid was<br/>
&gt; going to evac, and since I didn&#39;t have screech mem&#39;d (getting <br/>
&gt; sooo hard to<br/>
&gt; decide what to keep on tap), I started striking the mobs that <br/>
&gt; were hitting<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The necro&#39;s pet probably got one of them close to dead before <br/>
&gt; dying itself<br/>
&gt; fairly early on in the fight.  The two casters focussed on <br/>
&gt; starfiring and<br/>
&gt; draining one frog at a time, while I struck those yet <br/>
&gt; untouched.  All the<br/>
&gt; frogs were red, and I was able to keep two down with very <br/>
&gt; little damage<br/>
&gt; being taken.  When one frog remained standing, I kept it <br/>
&gt; glazed over till<br/>
&gt; the duo had enough mana to finish it off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love being a bard.<br/>
