<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237746102">In my guild, this item was designated enchanters and bards first.<br/>
I chose to wait until our enchanters got them before I took one for myself,<br/>
but there&#39;s no reason a bard shouldn&#39;t be considered for the roll.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Tranix Crown Disappointment..... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last night on Veeshan a few members from 3-4 guilds participated in a Fire<br/>
Giant run, there were about 7 from our guild and 18 people in total so we<br/>
had more than enough, things went well and the first giants were killed<br/>
easily, our monk puller was doing an excellent job and managed to pull<br/>
Tranix solo, the crown was dropped and I asked to be in the roll for it,<br/>
there was only myself and an enchanter there that would use it to it&#39;s full<br/>
potential. But instead it was decided that the enchanter should get to keep<br/>
the item and that I shouldn&#39;t get to roll for it.<br/>
<br/>
I was really angry to be treated like this especially as we have just got a<br/>
new charm song, the tranix crown would of been great.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would post this here and see whether you guys and girls<br/>
think I should of got to roll for this item?<br/>
