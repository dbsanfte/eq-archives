<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634129395">Thanks exactly the info I was looking for :)<br/>
Maybe we should put this thread to sleep before it gets kaboinged, hehe<br/>

&gt; &gt; Forgot to reply to this.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Reliability is up...a lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I built a couple of hundred pc&#39;s in the last year...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Intel - about 1 in 250 doa<br/>
&gt; AMD - about 1 in 50<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Intel - none malfunctioned if it worked out of the box<br/>
&gt; AMD - about 1 in 30 malfunctioned sometime between out of the <br/>
&gt; box and the<br/>
&gt; end of burn-in (72 hr running hot & heavy programs)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my personal experience working in a pc shop...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, I&#39;ve heard great things about the new 1.3ghz <br/>
&gt; AMD&#39;s...haven&#39;t actually<br/>
&gt; messed with one, but a friend of mine has built 10-15 <br/>
&gt; machines from them,<br/>
&gt; and 10-15 intel p4 1.7ghz...He says the AMD&#39;s he&#39;s built are <br/>
&gt; more stable,<br/>
&gt; and run as much as 30% faster than the same build as an intel <br/>
&gt; p4, on EVERY<br/>
&gt; app, games, utilities, and business apps.  I&#39;m gonna get one <br/>
&gt; soon and try<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; On the overclockers forum I frequent, I can recall no posts <br/>
&gt; lamenting DOA<br/>
&gt; &gt; processors offhand...and these are people who share every <br/>
&gt; step they take<br/>
&gt; &gt; when OC&#39;ing their machines.  :)  The 2 biggest processor <br/>
&gt; killers on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; forum are heat casualties and crushed cores from trying to install<br/>
&gt; &gt; heatsinks.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is no real reason to not consider equally an AMD <br/>
&gt; machine vs an Intel<br/>
&gt; &gt; machine, when shopping around.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Atonal<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nah, more bang for the buck...consider also, any pc builder <br/>
&gt; worth their salt<br/>
&gt; will have filtered the bad processors out before you ever get <br/>
&gt; to see the<br/>
&gt; machines, i.e. doa rate and failure rate are gonna be much <br/>
&gt; lower than the<br/>
&gt; builders.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And a bit more reliable (less out-of-the-box failures with Intel)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Aye, Ive been an avid Intel fan, but do this still count? I <br/>
&gt; know before K7<br/>
&gt; &gt; AMD had pretty lousy stability and QA. I havent heard about <br/>
&gt; any problems<br/>
&gt; &gt; with k7 series though??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dunno, i quit the shop I was working at a little over a month ago, and<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t messed with any since then, but the failure rate was <br/>
&gt; still pretty<br/>
&gt; bad about 3 months ago.  More than I would trust, but AMD <br/>
&gt; seems to be alot<br/>
&gt; better about warranty issues than Intel...you can get a <br/>
&gt; replacement AMD<br/>
&gt; rather quickly (if you didn&#39;t nuke it w/ heat or crush it) while Intel<br/>
&gt; wanted to take a while and test the processor you sent back, <br/>
&gt; etc.  (from an<br/>
&gt; OEM source...most of ya&#39;ll won&#39;t have that channel).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My take on the whole issue is:<br/>
&gt; If you need a solid business machine, buy one from the big <br/>
&gt; manufacturers,<br/>
&gt; i.e. Dell, Gateway, etc.  AMD/Intel<br/>
&gt; If you want a solid gaming machine, buy one from the big gaming<br/>
&gt; manufacturers, i.e. Falcon Northwest, Alienware, etc. AMD<br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t mind dinking around, and possibly having some <br/>
&gt; major downtime,<br/>
&gt; build it yourself. Intel before AMD<br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t have the cash to invest in one of the big rigs, build it<br/>
&gt; yourself, but be ready for some pitfalls. AMD before Intel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, yeah...I have been real impressed with the 2 machines <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen from<br/>
&gt; Alienware...One a couple of years ago, was the fastest PII I <br/>
&gt; had ever seen,<br/>
&gt; doing anything.  The latest and greatest my buddy has, AMD <br/>
&gt; 1.3, top of the<br/>
&gt; line Alienware, absolutely smokes on any task you run on <br/>
&gt; it...he dual boots<br/>
&gt; between win2k and win98se...and both os&#39;s tear up games.  (I have no<br/>
&gt; association to Alienware, don&#39;t even own one...but the next <br/>
&gt; machine I buy<br/>
&gt; instead of build is gonna come from there...hmm...if I ever <br/>
&gt; buy a machine<br/>
&gt; again...hehe)<br/>
