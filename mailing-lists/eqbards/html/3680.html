<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932926806">My very worst experience with begging was this.<br/>
<br/>
I had grouped with a ranger of the same or near level for two or three<br/>
nights on and off. If we both spotted each other on the server we&#39;d get<br/>
together. Not very friendly or social, just respecting each others skills<br/>
and knowing we could do more together. My only gripe was that he was one of<br/>
those people who would loot very quickly after having killed something, and<br/>
while I would get my coin split, very often any items that the mob may have<br/>
been carrying went to him, which sometimes he would share with me. I<br/>
complained, but nothing changed, so finally we stopped grouping.<br/>
<br/>
About two nights later I am grouping very successfully with a fun bunch of<br/>
people, and I get a tell from some char I don&#39;t know. This person turns out<br/>
to be a friend of the ranger in question, and has been told to approach me<br/>
for &quot;goodies&quot; to help him out. Needless to say I was more than a little<br/>
surprised and when I asked exactly what goodies he was expecting, he started<br/>
off with a laundry list of things that his ranger friend had given me as<br/>
spare loot items. When I told him that I had sold the items in question<br/>
(rusty hatchett, cloth wristbands, etc) he then asked for the money from<br/>
loot sales.<br/>

&gt; I agree with you on this one...  I started on Xegony the week the game<br/>
went<br/>
&gt; public - and I never begged and don&#39;t recall people begging.  I find it<br/>
&gt; quite common.  People begging for cash particularly bug me.  On the other<br/>
&gt; hand - I had a level 6 bard (I&#39;m 19) ask me very nicely I had any armor I<br/>
&gt; could spare.  I did in fact have some stuff in the bank that I was too<br/>
lazy<br/>
&gt; to try to sell - so I figured, what the hey - I&#39;ll help this guy out...<br/>

&gt; &gt; One thing that I find, that I assume is related to twinking,  is low<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters, begging for money or Items.  Probably because their previous<br/>
&gt; &gt; character was twinked by some high level char and they didn&#39;t have to<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard to get up in the world.  And then they either moved servers, or<br/>
&gt; deleted<br/>
&gt; &gt; their previous char and no one has come and thrown 100plat their way.<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone else notice this begging?<br/>
