below the world.  He ran for the zone.  The mobs chased<br/>
him.  The path to the zone is twisty.  The mobs ran straight<br/>
for him.  The mobs don&#39;t care about the height of obstacles<br/>
(they will walk right over trees and mesas and buildings<br/>
regardless of whether or not a player could).  They walked<br/>
right over the wall, and presumably fell below the<br/>
world.  Neither the wolf nor the rest of the train came back<br/>
from the zone, except my original pull which teleported to me<br/>
like mobs do when they get stuck.<br/>
