<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388746000">I once had SOW cast on a non-bard character of mine who was VERY encumbered<br/>
(133 or 88) and I could still outrun a character without it.. We did some<br/>
races before and after and with SOW there doesn&#39;t seem to be as much speed<br/>
lost to encumberance (almost none as a matter of fact), while Selo&#39;s shows a<br/>
significant loss of speed as Agility decreases due to encumberance.<br/>

<br/>
While hunting in West Commonlands, I noticed a L30 druid<br/>
running with Spirit of the Wolf on, so I tried chasing her to<br/>
see how SoW and Selo&#39;s Accelerando compare.  My L15 bard was<br/>
very slowly able to catch up to her.  The closing rate was<br/>
slow enough that I&#39;m not sure if it was a difference between<br/>
the spell and song, or if she just had a slower machine than<br/>
me (I have a friend with a slow machine and in just normal<br/>
running I can slowly pass him).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m pretty sure Selo&#39;s Accelerando gets faster as you<br/>
gain levels/skills.  There are two trees where I did some<br/>
impromptu timings when I was L8.  It took about 10.4 seconds<br/>
for me to run between them with Accelerando and a drum.  I<br/>
recently missed the boat by 5 seconds (when oh when will they<br/>
add a second boat between Freeport and Butcherblock) so I went<br/>
back to this spot to kill some time.  At L15, my bard took 9.7<br/>
seconds to run between those two trees.<br/>
<br/>
(I suppose it&#39;s possible the druid was encumbered.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know anyone that&#39;s high level and can cast SoW to do a more<br/>
controlled test.)<br/>
