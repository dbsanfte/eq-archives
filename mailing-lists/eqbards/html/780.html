<div id="ygrps-yiv-189080501">The dungeons are the big thing. Being level 17 I&#39;d assume you haven&#39;t been<br/>
in Cazic-Thule or Solusek? There are some nice things in there that are<br/>
better than bronze plate and combines. Keep going till you have full<br/>
Rubicite (or Emerald) and a pair of Demon Claws. =)<br/>

Hello all . . .<br/>
<br/>
I am a Level 17 Bard. As such I am about that age where I have almost<br/>
completed my set of bronze armor. I already have 2 combine longswords, so<br/>
pretty soon I&#39;ll be as equipped as I ever really need to be.<br/>
<br/>
To those of you who have reached and passed this point in the game, I would<br/>
like to know what it is that keeps you going? I&#39;ve seen basically every<br/>
zone, got everything I need. In real life this is the time I would finally<br/>
settle down and spend time with my family.<br/>
<br/>
Just looking for tips on what to do now . . .<br/>
