<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765114012">Yes foraged food is heavy, that is one of the reasons I took up baking :)  <br/>
Most of the foraged food can be cooked into a much lighter (0.1 Wgt) food.  <br/>
Some will even give back two for one (like vegie soup).  Plus with baking <br/>
all that meat you get as loot (wolf, rat, lion, lizard, dark elf, etc...) <br/>
can be turned into tasty treats.  The only problem with baking right now is <br/>
that some items appear to be bugged (clump of dough can not be made, or <br/>
consumes the hardware needed to make it (Rabbit stew, fish head soup).  Over <br/>
all though baking is a very fun, but not profitable, skill.<br/>

&gt;Another thing with the forage skill is that the stuff you forage<br/>
&gt;up is DAMNED heavy.  Like 1.0 sometimes for a piece of food.  I<br/>
&gt;usually end up giving it away or destroy it.<br/>
