<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-832309329">Actually those 2 showed up a few patches ago. We appear to have gotten<br/>
the promised L43 song Desperate Dirge, and a L50 song, whose name I<br/>
forgot to write down. (sorry) I managed to check everywhere but Erudin<br/>
last night so there may be more.<br/>
<br/>
On the Dirge, it will also damage you as well as the monsters it&#39;s<br/>
targetting, so watch it if you attempt to actually use it if you are<br/>
desperate and low on health. It took about a RL hour to fully regain my<br/>
mana after using the song.<br/>
<br/>
The various chants supposedly had their damage increased, but at least<br/>
on testing on myself, it appears that it has actually decreased. Chant<br/>
of Flame used to do about 30, 10 over 3 ticks. Now it appears to do 22,<br/>
11 over 2 ticks. Also, Chant of Flame, at least, appears to be resisted<br/>
so much that I&#39;m finding it questionable whether it&#39;s worth keeping<br/>
loaded. Like many spells that have 2 effects, it appears that this<br/>
doubles the chance for the mob to resist the song, and in my tests<br/>
yesterday, I rarely saw it actually take. It&#39;s too bad too, because if<br/>
we bards could lower fire resistance significantly it would allow the<br/>
higher level Druid&#39;s who&#39;ve been complaining that their only good in<br/>
dungeon direct damage spells were useless to have a better chance of<br/>
hitting too.<br/>
