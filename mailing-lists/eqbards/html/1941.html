&gt; I&#39;m not going to bore you all to tears with all the charting and the<br/>

&gt; strength, offense and weapons skills seriously skew the results in favor of<br/>
&gt; speed, and about half a dozen other variables.  Most of those numbers are<br/>
&gt; intentionally and forever hidden from the end users view.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, thanks for the clarification.  When you said faster was<br/>
better because of &quot;more dual wield checks&quot; I thought you were<br/>
saying the additional dual wield checks in and of themselves<br/>
were causing the extra damage, which they do not.  It&#39;s the<br/>
above factors (damage bonuses skewed to favor faster weapons)<br/>
compounded with the additional checks that cause faster<br/>
weapons to be favored.<br/>
<br/>
When you said &quot;all other things being equal,&quot; I took that to<br/>
mean the faster and slower weapon had the exact same final<br/>
damage over time, just their speed is different.  If that&#39;s<br/>
the case, then what I wrote up is correct - all dual wield<br/>
does is scale the effectiveness of the weapon by a flat<br/>
percentage.  But it seems you meant the raw stats (dam/delay<br/>
ratio) being equal (I apologize for not making this<br/>
distinction clear in my example - I was just trying to keep it<br/>
simple).  There is still something nonlinear going on here<br/>
that I don&#39;t see (the double attack not going off on the<br/>
second hand until dual wield passes 149 is an example of the<br/>
type of nonlinearity that could cause the effect you<br/>
describe).  But given your clarification, I agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
It does, however, turn the original question (dirk and<br/>
combine, which in which hand?) into a really muddled mess.  I<br/>
suppose that&#39;s what you wanted though - no quick and easy way<br/>
to figure out the optimal arrangement.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it got you to spill the beans on some of the internal<br/>
workings of the game, so I&#39;m happy.  :-)<br/>
