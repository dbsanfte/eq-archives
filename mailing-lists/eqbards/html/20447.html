<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495146707">you&#39;re right, if there is an enchanter or shaman or both in the group then<br/>
there is very little for a bard to do to buff the group, if anything but<br/>
mana.  that&#39;s a situation where you can do some song damage (or take a<br/>
breather if an easy camp and just relax, 56 levels of twisting songs is<br/>
killing my fingers), and i said many times that our songs do a lot more<br/>
damage than our weapons.  but if a bard is there to do the group buffing,<br/>
you are not going to be using songs to do damage.  that was my only point,<br/>
which i regret even trying to make since it did not come across correctly,<br/>
and now i am the stupid bard who doesn&#39;t know how to play.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night in Sebilis we had 2 groups.. including a Shaman and <br/>
&gt; Enchanter (2 at one point).  I didn&#39;t need to Haste, Slow, Snare (2 <br/>
&gt; druids), Heal (2 clerics, 2 druids, 1 shaman)... I could have sang <br/>
&gt; battle buffs to buff some str and dex and such, but there was only 1 <br/>
&gt; tank (Warrior) in my party... not a whole lot of mileage gained.  So, <br/>
&gt; I chanted (with selo&#39;s drum) and I charmed (a little) and I played <br/>
&gt; mana song and bind sight to help scout in the downtime.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was I being the most effective Bard I could be... imho, Yes.  And was <br/>
&gt; that helpful to the group?  Hell, yes.  Don&#39;t forget the magic, fire, <br/>
&gt; and cold resistances you&#39;re also lowering on top of the damage you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; doing.  That&#39;s helping every one of your nukers, procing weapons, <br/>
&gt; overzealous druids with their newfound starburst, etc. </span></blockquote></div>
