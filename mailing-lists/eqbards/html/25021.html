<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330662371">As other mentioned GeForce cards are IMO also most bang for the bucks.<br/>
Ive not upgraded in a while:<br/>
Processor: Athlon 600MHz<br/>
RAM: PC133 256Mb SDRAM<br/>
Sound: Soundblaster live (First version on the market)<br/>
Graphics: ASUS 6800 (GeForce 1 with 32MB DDR RAM)<br/>
Network: 10Mbit LAN to a ADSL 256kb/sec<br/>
<br/>
Only annoying problem I have is loading time from server select screen to<br/>
character select *shrug*...<br/>
I zone reasonbly fast when ingame, compared to others. But just to try and<br/>
get my zoning to go faster I recently expanded my RAM to 256 (from 128) but<br/>
did not notice any improvement on anything. Well I kinda expected that, but<br/>
SDRAM is so cheap these days that I just had to try.<br/>
I figure that my HD is due for an upgrade next(got a lousy UDMA33 4GB disk).<br/>
<br/>
As to video lag I do not have any. My GeForce performs flawlessly at<br/>
1024x768 only times I note a slight slowdown is when ALOT casting is going<br/>
on.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not <br/>
&gt; directly related to barding.  Bards do provide a lot of input <br/>
&gt; into what is seen in game graphically, so this can be an <br/>
&gt; important topic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 <br/>
&gt; 16 MB AGP graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But <br/>
&gt; more memory and a better graphics card are in reach due to <br/>
&gt; Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram - done.  So now I want <br/>
&gt; to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards they use, <br/>
&gt; have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything <br/>
&gt; else of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate <br/>
&gt; in WW and some places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down <br/>
&gt; and hope they don&#39;t scrape me off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
&gt; Luclin without a better card.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again for all the help,<br/>
