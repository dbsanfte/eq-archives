&gt; Im sorry, but you have to looks at a classes restrictions.  The simple fact<br/>
&gt; is, pure casters cannot wear True Armor.  Hybrids can wear a limited subset,<br/>
&gt; and Melee&#39;ers can wear all.  Do you refute this basic statement? If you do<br/>
&gt; how can you deny that a druid and shaman are a hybrid.<br/>
<br/>

plate) is a hybrid?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got several categories of classes here:<br/>
<br/>
Int-based casters:<br/>
Melee skills go as 3*level.<br/>
Can wear cloth and patchwork-level armor.<br/>
<br/>
Wis-based (primary) casters:<br/>
Melee skills go as 4*level.<br/>
 Druid:<br/>
 Can wear up to leather.<br/>
 Shaman:<br/>
 Can wear up to banded.<br/>
 Cleric:<br/>
 Can wear up to plate.<br/>
<br/>
Non-casters:<br/>
Melee skills go as 5*level.<br/>
 Monk:<br/>
 Can wear up to leather.<br/>
 Rogue:<br/>
 Can wear up to banded.<br/>
 Warrior:<br/>
 Can wear up to plate.<br/>
<br/>
Classes that don&#39;t quite fit:<br/>
Melee skills go as 5*level.<br/>
 Ranger:<br/>
 Can wear up to banded.<br/>
 Paladin, shadownknight, bard:<br/>
 Can wear up to plate.<br/>
<br/>
What you define as a hybrid is really up to you.  The classes<br/>
run the full spectrum.  Even the four categories I&#39;ve used<br/>
above are somewhat arbitrary, although I personally feel they<br/>
are the most appropriate.  I wouldn&#39;t hold anyone to these<br/>
categories though, much less make an argument about what<br/>
classes should get what based on them.<br/>
