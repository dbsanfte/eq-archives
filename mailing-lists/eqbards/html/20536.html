<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119570753">I know I&#39;ve read a lot of posts about where to practice DDD/brass <br/>
skills, but I&#39;m afraid I deleted them all and now need the <br/>
information.  You see, I had decided (having been there and verified <br/>
the safety) to do it in the Arena in Lake Rathe.  Well, 18 came and I <br/>
am in Kunark.  I am not going all the way to Lake Rathe just to <br/>
practice! <br/>
<br/>
Someone said that they think brass skills are checked even when this <br/>
song is sung without an instrument.  I am convinced that person <br/>
was right.  The number of missed notes I&#39;m having is just astounding <br/>
(frequently 20 or more in a row).  I realize that missed notes are<br/>
not <br/>
uncommon for a new song, but this is ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you have suggestions, please make them somewhere that a <br/>
&quot;good&quot; level 19 can get to.  Thanks!<br/>
