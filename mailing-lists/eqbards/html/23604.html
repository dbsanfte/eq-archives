 </span></blockquote>Eggzachary!  Trust me, there&#39;s nothing that&#39;ll irk us (and perversely, amuse<br/>
at the same time) more than hearing about a sucky Bard.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to do a hall of shame on some of the Bards on Bertoxx.  I agree<br/>
that there are too many who just don&#39;t know how to use their abilities to<br/>
the best effect.<br/>
<br/>
Possible reason why: as most of the now 50+ Bards were growing up, they<br/>
shared a lot of information amongst themselves and educated younger Bards<br/>
who followed them.  Then many bad things happened to the Bard class and<br/>
people stopped playing the class past level 20 or so for a while.  Recently,<br/>
however, things have gotten better and interest has been re-kindled and<br/>
we&#39;re seeing many more Bards.  However, there&#39;s a &quot;Generation Gap&quot; between<br/>
the old and new Bards with very little middle ground to pass on what we&#39;ve<br/>
learned.<br/>
<br/>
Places like the Concert Hall and this list help, but how many people do you<br/>
know would have the patience to wade through pages and pages of posts<br/>
dealing with mainly level 40/50+ issues to find newbie posts that will be of<br/>
any use to them?</div>
