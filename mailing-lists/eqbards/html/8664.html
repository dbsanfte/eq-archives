<b>Subject:</b> Lambent armor - what I did last night (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370441415">Okay, I spent a good 6 or 7 hours working on these quests last night.<br/>
Everything I had to kill was green, but I had so much fun travelling across<br/>
the globe trying to scrounge up these components that the xp didn&#39;t really<br/>
matter.<br/>
I was incredibly surprised with the amount of cooperation I recieved.  I was<br/>
standing outside Solusek A, waiting for some of my regulars to log on so I<br/>
could go in and claim my fiery vambraces and my firewalker boots.  Well<br/>
after a while nobody had showed, but a couple people I was slightly<br/>
aquainted with happened to be standing around and volunteered to help me<br/>
out.  They in turn called in a level 50 wizard to come along who also needed<br/>
an item from Solusek A.<br/>
Now Solusek A is a pretty easy dungeon for me, but the number of goblins in<br/>
there is such that I was very hesitant to go in with only a monk, warrior,<br/>
wizard and me - No healing.  But hey, what the heck, only live once, off we<br/>
went.  Sure, we almost died, but the adrenaline rush I got from being within<br/>
a bubble of death a couple of times was pretty exciting.  Pretty sad when<br/>
you&#39;re only healer is a bard :)<br/>
The Lavawalker Boots dropped from the first mage that we killed.  The<br/>
vambraces took about 8 or 9 champions before I got one.  That being done,<br/>
and our wizard having gotten her whatever heart off a wizard we were ready<br/>
to leave.<br/>
The wizard then stated that she was going to Permafrost to get her next<br/>
component.  Well, knowing I needed something from there too, I came along.<br/>
Let me tell you, its pretty easy to clear the king area when you train<br/>
everything to one place and have your wizard unload her 800+ AoE spell.  I<br/>
just stood back and watched.  Took about 12 elite goblins before I picked up<br/>
my icy vambraces.  (These can be worn by the way, AC8, +5 cold and have the<br/>
same colorful look as the new lambent armor.  I started wearing them even<br/>
though they are worse than my rubi, just because the look so damn cool).<br/>
Our wizard got what she needed from her second kill.<br/>
From here, I met up with a druid friend of mine and went to the karanas.  We<br/>
killed a few hill giants, but no lambent stones.  Decided to go kill Choon<br/>
and Froon.  Choon dropped his rune the first time, Froon the second.  Other<br/>
bards have gotten them both on the first drop.  These runes look identical,<br/>
but using the 14th level identify song, you can sort out which is the top,<br/>
and which is the middle.<br/>
Well, I now had what I needed to make both boots and arms, minus the lambent<br/>
stones.  We&#39;d been killing any giants we had come across, but no stones so<br/>
far so we decided to try Oasis.  Third giant there dropped a stone (this was<br/>
probably the tenth or so giant we had killed that night).<br/>
Whoo hoo!  Had enough to make one piece now.  Hmmm, boots or arms. . . .<br/>
decided on arms, my boots (dwarven workboots) already have good plusses, so<br/>
they can wait.  Handed in all my components and was rewarded with lambent<br/>
sleeves.  AC11, +1cha, +2 to all resistances.  Not too shabby, only 1AC less<br/>
than my azure sleeves with some plusses to boot, and such a funky color :)<br/>
Hopefully tonight I&#39;ll get some more stones and be able to make more.  As a<br/>
side note, a bard on our server tried to make the breastplate, but got<br/>
nothing.  He says the breastplate quest is bugged, but it could just be that<br/>
his faction was too low because I *know* he hailed that efreeti who lowers<br/>
your faction when you try and talk to him.<br/>
All the components you need to collect are LORE and NO DROP, except for the<br/>
lambent stones which are just LORE.<br/>
If people are interested, I&#39;ll post more info as I find it.<br/>
