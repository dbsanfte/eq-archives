I am a woodelf compared to the wing man look  ;)<br/>

Thanks everyone for the info.  I think I better wait a few levels<br/>
before heading inside.  Pity really as the boots and the vambraces are<br/>
the last parts I need and I look a bit daft wandering around in bronze<br/>
boots and upper arms and blue everywhere else!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of daft, although I&#39;ve got the Lambent helm I&#39;ve stopped<br/>
wearing it because of how silly I look!  It&#39;s a bit of a downer to a<br/>
girl when she joins a group only to have a paladin wander up to her<br/>
and tell her how bad her helmet looks on her!!  Maybe they only come<br/>
in size huge for a wood elf, but it&#39;s awful!  So I&#39;m keeping it for my<br/>
snapshot when I&#39;ve got the full set, but until then I&#39;ll be searching<br/>
out a decent alternative to the helm that&#39;s fairly easily obtainable<br/>
(or very very cheap!)<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Can anyone gimme a few hints about where and how tough the Solusek<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mage and the Solusek Champion are.  An opinion of how frequent the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; spawn and drops are would be helpful too ;-)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am pretty sure that I got mine in the &quot;bar room&quot; in Sol-A.  We were<br/>
there<br/>
&gt;&gt; about 4 hours and I got both items.  We had some mid 30&#39;s rangers with<br/>
us<br/>
&gt;&gt; lower 30&#39;s.  When my regular group tried to break the room at levels 24<br/>
thru<br/>
&gt;&gt; 28 group, we got spanked.  If you can recruit some mid 30&#39;s types you<br/>
should<br/>
&gt;&gt; do pretty well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Solusek Mages and Champions are just a type of mob, they<br/>
&gt;are not a named mob.  They appear in the goblin &quot;castle&quot; area<br/>
&gt;of Sol A.  After you zone in and crawl through the hole in the<br/>
&gt;wall, make a right turn, hop down the ledge.  There will be a<br/>
&gt;door in front of you - everything past it is the &quot;castle&quot;<br/>
&gt;area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best spot is the king area.  After you go through the door and<br/>
&gt;past a grate, turn right and go straight, through a secret<br/>
&gt;wall, follow the passage left to a door.  The four rooms past<br/>
&gt;that door spawn Solusek goblins, including the king (rare<br/>
&gt;spawn).  Mages and Champions will sometimes spawn in place of<br/>
&gt;the normal Solusek goblins.  Beware there is a wandering Sol<br/>
&gt;goblin in this hallway, and all SOl goblins can see invis.<br/>
&gt;You will need a full group in their low to mid 30s (enchanter<br/>
&gt;highly recommended until they fix Lullaby - this was the last<br/>
&gt;place I got to use Lullaby before they broke it).  The king<br/>
&gt;drops a +str ring, and a so-so sceptre.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not quite as plentiful is the high shaman area.  It&#39;s a dead<br/>
&gt;end so it&#39;s relatively safe.  It&#39;s past the bar area.  Up to<br/>
&gt;four Solusek goblins spawn in the two rooms that make up the<br/>
&gt;high shaman area (vs. 3-4 in the king room, 3 in the adjacent<br/>
&gt;room, 2 in the room after, all of whom can heal through the<br/>
&gt;walls).  You could hold this room with just 3-4 low- to<br/>
&gt;mid-30s, although you might need more to take it.  The shaman<br/>
&gt;drops a nice ring that grants infravision (useful for blind<br/>
&gt;humans).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve never seen a Solusek goblin spawn *in* the bar area.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s a nice place to camp though, as there are a ton of<br/>
&gt;goblins nearby, each separated into different rooms (i.e. if<br/>
&gt;you have a tough fight, you can just skip a room while you<br/>
&gt;rest without screwing up the spawn pattern).<br/>
