<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746028680">... is a dead dragon!<br/>
<br/>
My guild, &lt;The Pantheon&gt;, took on the red dragon, Lord Nagafen, and killed<br/>
him in a battle that lasted about 3 minutes. (if you dont count the hour or<br/>
more of buffing just prior - heh - good plan Raloon but next time....)<br/>
<br/>
We do battle:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/naggy/naggy2.jpg">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/naggy/naggy2.jpg</a><br/>

In this shot, you can see I am glued to Liquid, a lev 50 cleric.  Samine is<br/>
another cleric (47), Xanther a ranger (50), Shaytana a ranger (50), & Ataras<br/>
a monk (50) & yours truly bard (48).  We were the &#39;second wave&#39; and rushed<br/>
in when Nag was called at about 60 percent. We lost only 3 ppl in the battel<br/>
iirc. Our groups MR was 250 (about) for got to note our heat resist.  I<br/>
played elemental and guardian with MM Battle drums.  My hot keys were ready<br/>
for a switch to hymn and Niv&#39;s with 7 string lute had we lost a cleric.<br/>
<br/>
And we prevail:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/naggy/dead.jpg">http://www.sba.uwm.edu/jgs/sylly/naggy/dead.jpg</a><br/>

I had Dirge loaded and tried for a &#39;kill shot&#39; but the lag blocked the cast<br/>
and it never fired off.  A monk got the killing blow.  When the red beast<br/>
fell, he fell into the lava &lt;yuck&gt;.  Tuur wasted no time and dove in to loot<br/>
the corpse:<br/>
<br/>
One red dragon scale (to one of our rogues: Murdok - grats!)<br/>
<br/>
Two gold plated kostiganas (grats to our rogue Kuppy and grats to Keltana<br/>
one of our great warriors)<br/>
<br/>
And finally, Lord Nagafen shouts, &quot;Here Elycion, take this Cloak of Flames<br/>
and LEAVE ME ALONE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Grats to a great ranger Elycion!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all my sibs - we have a truly great guild!  Events like these are<br/>
the best!  And thanks to our guests who joined us for the fun!<br/>

p.s. after that, we went to Kedge Keep to cool off in the nice refreshing<br/>
waters. after swimming around some, we killed off some seaspine guardians<br/>
(sp?) and then ran into this funny looking froogy.  he had 5 more seaspines<br/>
with him when he came to visit us on the ledge.  they got very sleepy while<br/>
we dispatched Phin and then alot more sleepy as we killed all 5 of them.<br/>
&quot;Nice pull, Tuur!&quot;  Heh, 5 guardians and Phin.  Gauntlets - I think - it was<br/>
late and I was too tired to remember exacly.</div>
