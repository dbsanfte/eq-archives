<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753418386">Please someone tell me they have gotten H2H up higher than 40...I have been<br/>
practicing for 2 days straight and gotten it up to 25 because I thought it<br/>
would be nice to play an instrument and still participate in dealing at<br/>
least a bit of melee damage rather than just standing off to the side acting<br/>
like an aloof musician.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t remember who posted it, but someone said they had tracking up to 90<br/>
and it is still going...I have hope...<br/>
