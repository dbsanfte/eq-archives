 </span></blockquote>Druids quad kited raptors SOLO? Are you sure about that? Raptors have on<br/>
the average about 4k hp. A druid over 49 has one AoE, Lightning Blast,<br/>
that does 477 dmg for 225 mana. so assuming no resists, that would be<br/>
1800 mana. The other AoE is much less efficient. Lightning Blast is<br/>
magic based so it tends to get a lot of partial resists. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible but it sure looks like you&#39;d be cutting<br/>
it real close with mana. It&#39;s way more efficient now for a druid to use<br/>
root/dotting (rotting). I can solo pull a raptor, stack 3 dots on it,<br/>
and med back to about 1 1/2 bubbles of mana by the time it dies if I&#39;m<br/>
lucky on resists and root breaks. The L49 (and 56) roots last over 2<br/>
minutes with a break check every 30 seconds so unless you run into a<br/>
clump of bad rolls, it&#39;s pretty likely the first or second root will run<br/>
the whole 2 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen druids quad kiting when I&#39;ve been out there. I see a lot<br/>
of wizards kiting about 6-8 around though. Now that&#39;s impressive. But<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen how hard it is for Wizards to get groups so I guess it<br/>
balances out.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone worked out if the chant dot dmg keeps going up after 50? I&#39;ve<br/>
often thought about getting a bard to come out and team up on<br/>
root/dotting with me, as all 3 dots and mana song would probably speed<br/>
things up considerably.<br/>
