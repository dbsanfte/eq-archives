&gt;You used to zone in and get mass slaughtered at the gate until they took the<br/>
&gt;zone down that morning a few days ago and brought it right back up.  after<br/>
&gt;this, zoning in has been safe.  we use the same tactics, and fight in the<br/>
&gt;south spot first, then after clearing the area move down west to a second<br/>
&gt;spot.  ranger, shaman, and paladin armor seems to be plentiful.<br/>
&gt;unfortunately bard armor is more rare.  we have yet to see a BP, the only<br/>
&gt;piece left that i am dying for (have legs and boots).  we&#39;ve gotten hit by<br/>
&gt;the glare lords but they are pretty easy with clerics stunning them to<br/>
&gt;death.  and like you said, more than 3 mobs and we start shouting GG.  3<br/>
&gt;mobs are very doable with a couple enchanters messing.  usually from the<br/>
&gt;south spot the boogeyman pull from the house is usually all 3.  and we have<br/>
&gt;yet to kill cazic because every time we pull him he crashes the zone like<br/>
&gt;the samhains and boogeys sometimes do.  anyway, let me know when you get<br/>
&gt;some more armor, unless its a BP cause i will be too jealous =P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well last night was spectularly fun because we didnt have a single zone<br/>
crash. This enabled us to clear almost everything in the zone except for<br/>
Cazic himself and his three henchmen fright, terror, and dread. We had<br/>
killed all of his henchmen before and they hadnt dropped anything<br/>
interesting so we where thinking we would just rather ignore them. At this<br/>
point we started getting cocky. Dracoliche was cake for us and if another<br/>
server could kill cazic, well then we could to. So we launched our assault<br/>
and imediatly cazic said something about his henchmen better come over and<br/>
help him. At this point various profanties where uttered as we realized our<br/>
fatal mistake, and sure enough fright, terror, and dread showed up on the<br/>
spot just as we had cazic at half life. Luckily for us we had several high<br/>
level magicancs and necros which set their pets on the henchmen. With this<br/>
borrowed time we finished cazic and gated out with minimal losses. Killing<br/>
him was about the same as the dracoliche except the three henchman.<br/>
Definatly need to take out the henchmen first before killing cazic :)<br/>
<br/>
Updated bestiary: <br/>
Phoboplasms are my new personal favorite, they can drop up to TWO random<br/>
class specific items. Last night we killed around 8 of these guys and TWO<br/>
dropped a bard bracer, along with a bunch of ranger and shaman stuff. <br/>
Cazic Thule : 8 platinum. Thats it. Good thing killing him was so much fun<br/>
cause that was a big let down. <br/>
Nightmare&#39;s drop some silly piece of nightmare hide that can cancel<br/>
blindness. Woopydo. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Total bard pieces found have been 2 bracers, helmet, and boots (which i<br/>
got) and arms and gloves which another bard got. No greaves or breastplates<br/>
yet :(</div>
