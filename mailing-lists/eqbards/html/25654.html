&gt;i find it also annoying. but at least now you definitely know when you can<br/>
&gt;start the next song. it makes twisting a bit more simple imo. on the other<br/>
&gt;hand it takes away one of the skills a good bard used to have, that is to<br/>
&gt;&quot;feel&quot; when the song fires and start the next even before the icon or the<br/>
&gt;text comes up.<br/>

live.  GAH.  Did I mention Gah?  Gah!  The timer is VERY annoying!  It&#39;s <br/>
also subjective, which means that if your client is in any way lagged (I <br/>
was playing in SloMo last night, it was wild) then your timer is off, too.<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Another thing that they shouldn&#39;t have messed with.<br/>
