&gt; Abashi chose my post give his response.  Granted, my post  was a rant, but<br/>
&gt; it got his attention.  My post definitely didn&#39;t have the substance that<br/>
&gt; John Kim&#39;s lullaby post has.  Nor is my post anywhere near being as thorough<br/>
&gt; as Kedian (sp) bard petition post.  Both of these threads have over 200+<br/>
&gt; hits, but no response from Abashi.  Answering my rant was the easy way out<br/>
&gt; for Abashi, and he took it.  Instead of spending the time and effort to<br/>
&gt; offer meaningful responses, we get a flame.  If my post hurt the bards case<br/>
&gt; in the long run, I am sorry, but clearly the patient approach isn&#39;t getting<br/>
&gt; things done.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;ve kind of decided to shut up since it&#39;s just aggravating me and it doesn&#39;t appear that these guys<br/>
are interested in actually doing the class balance stuff that this class could use.  But the fact that he<br/>
responded to your message while there were two substantive posts hanging out on the first page for more<br/>
than a week (that nobody has responded to in any way at all) didn&#39;t help my mood any.  And he didn&#39;t even<br/>
address the more salient parts of YOUR post...   You have nothing to apologize for.<br/>
