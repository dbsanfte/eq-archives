<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918820164">45 a tic??  I would be highly suspect of that.  That is far too powerful<br/>
(i.e. too good to be true).  Clerics everywhere would blow a gasket if they<br/>
heard about that.<br/>

&gt; Well, a guildmate of mine stated today that he is now able to <br/>
&gt; heal 45 points <br/>
&gt; per tick with his Lute of the Gypsy Princess found in <br/>
&gt; Mistmoore. He is a lvl <br/>
&gt; 45 bard. Can anyone verify this info? I was not near him to <br/>
&gt; test it out, and <br/>
&gt; he blows alot of hot air at times.  So I just wanted to see <br/>
&gt; if anyone else <br/>
&gt; is experiencing this insane (that&#39;s not a complaint) rise in <br/>
&gt; our bretheren&#39;s <br/>
&gt; ability to heal with song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This info blew my mind (not to mention irritated the hell out <br/>
&gt; of my cleric <br/>
&gt; gf, heheheh). I had never bothered to get this item because I <br/>
&gt; knew that it <br/>
&gt; was nerfed and worked only as well as a regular stringed <br/>
&gt; instrument. I also <br/>
&gt; hate Castle Mistmoore. =)  Whatever Verant was planning on <br/>
&gt; doing with this <br/>
&gt; item as far as magical properties, I NEVER expected this! <br/>
&gt; Does this also <br/>
&gt; mean our lvl 2 and lvl 48 DoT songs are that much more <br/>
&gt; powerful? &lt;evil grin&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone, someone please test and post as I do not have the <br/>
&gt; item available to <br/>
&gt; do so myself. =(<br/>
