<div id="ygrps-yiv-481297900">Hahaha!  I was in Mistmoore this weekend too and it was CRAZY!  I never<br/>
fought there with my shaman and I&#39;m really enjoying myself (despite the<br/>
multiple deaths) because the whacked out pathing makes it challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Only advice I have is get a druid to group wtih you.  Once they cast that<br/>
damage shield on you, the mobs don&#39;t give a FIG about you!  They just start<br/>
pounding the wimpy druid *snicker*.<br/>

I have gotten in two *good* yard groups in Mistmoore the last two nights,<br/>
which I hear is rare, but I have been doing well. I like to keep Selos going<br/>
(with drum) in case one of the clockwork trains catches us and we have to<br/>
zone (in fact the warriors were routinly /following me during breaks just in<br/>
case). One thing I noticed was if something spawned or someone else pulled<br/>
something it headed right for me even if they started wacking it before it<br/>
arrived to begin pummeling me. Assuming it wasn&#39;t my breath, does anyone<br/>
else notice this?<br/>
