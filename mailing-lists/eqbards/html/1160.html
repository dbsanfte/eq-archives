&gt;Fellow bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am (or was) subscribed to two EverQuest mailing lists, this one and the<br/>
&gt;one also at OneList for Veeshan.  I have incoming mail from both sorted<br/>
&gt;into an EverQuest folder.  I received a relatively inane message amongst<br/>
&gt;the talk here and started to respond but realized it was from the veeshan<br/>
&gt;list rather than this one.  It was followed by even more inanity from that<br/>
&gt;list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I unsubscribed from veeshan and decided I should compliment those on this<br/>
&gt;list for the quality and content of the discussion.  Bards are indeed a<br/>
&gt;breed apart.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree, this list has to be the most informative, helpful, and has <br/>
the least flaming i&#39;ve seen on any list i&#39;ve been a part of.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I forget who was going to distribute the bard song list they <br/>
created, but i haven&#39;t received it yet - has anyone else? Is it still being <br/>
worked on? (now that we have new songs to add)<br/>
