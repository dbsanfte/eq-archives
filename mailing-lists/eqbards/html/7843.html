&gt; &gt; summoning me that the GM considered it a bug and summoned<br/>
&gt; &gt; my corpse to the zone. He said it was under a ledge<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere in the lava where I never would have got it out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me guess.. You fell into the lava, were swimming<br/>
&gt; around and zoned in the little river area and died<br/>
&gt; just past the zone eh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. While fleeing a bad fire giant pull that had already killed 9 ppl<br/>
and our group gater, I was summoned into some &quot;hole&quot; in the zone that<br/>
was like a grey nothingness, then fell from there into some lava and<br/>
died. From what we could work out, when the fire giant summoned me I<br/>
appeared in a wall and then fell through it to an area of lava that<br/>
wasn&#39;t generally accessable in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
There are still a lot of places in zones where you can fall through the<br/>
edges of some of the surfaces into non-existant zone areas, with very<br/>
unpredictable results. We found a couple in Cazic, especially around the<br/>
perimeter of that open area on the long tunnel to the back temple in<br/>
Cazic as well as up on the roof above the well. We always report them so<br/>
the GM is used to hearing from us. If you&#39;ve ever had someone die and<br/>
thier body show up at the zone instead of deep in the dungeon where they<br/>
really died you may be seeing the fix put in when they find these holes.<br/>
I think they are vertices that aren&#39;t properly joined in the world<br/>
building softway or something.<br/>
