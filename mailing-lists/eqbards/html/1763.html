 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a toggle switch like hide.  You press it to attempt the<br/>
skill.  If you succeed, it stays depressed until you hit it<br/>
again (although you can&#39;t toggle it until the skill timer<br/>
expires).  If you fail, it also stays depressed until you hit<br/>
it again.  How do you tell if you&#39;ve succeeded or not?  You<br/>
move a lot slower if you&#39;re sneaking.<br/>
<br/>
Any activities which negate it (singing, attacking,<br/>
spellcasting, etc) will grey it out as if you&#39;d used the<br/>
skill, but it&#39;ll automatically pop up again after the skill<br/>
timer expires.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s as near as I could figure in the 15 minutes I played<br/>
with it on the boat.  It&#39;s kind of a useless skill considering<br/>
we get the invisibility song two levels later.<br/>
