<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Change to bard song mechanics on Test! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-162927773">Since the thing is bugged badly enough that it can&#39;t go live (or at least, due to the stuck song problem,<br/>
can&#39;t stay live, I don&#39;t have enough faith in Verant to assume that they won&#39;t put this into production as<br/>
is), we don&#39;t really know what they intend here.  But I assume that they are attempting to &quot;fix&quot; the<br/>
&quot;exploits&quot; that exist when a Bard turns on a song and leaves the computer.  If this is the case, it is yet<br/>
another utterly boneheaded modification to the class that completely ignores game mechanics in general and<br/>
Bard mechanics in specific.<br/>
<br/>
If an Enchanter casts Clarity on a party, he can sit down to med, and then go smoke a cigarette, or make<br/>
lunch, or go to the bathroom, or take a quick trip to the hardware store.  When a Bard (as currently<br/>
coded) turns on Mana song, he can do the same thing.  If this change goes into effect, the Enchanter can<br/>
still leave, but THE BARD CAN&#39;T.  I can just IMAGINE what my party is going to say if I turn on Mana, go<br/>
away to stretch my legs, and Mana breaks 5 seconds after I get up.  The same goes for Shamans and trade<br/>
buffing (an example this poster used).<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s possible for someone to log a Bard on, turn on Mana, set him to /follow the Cleric, and have the<br/>
Cleric get a mana boost that way.  But you can do THE SAME THING with an Enchanter, and you don&#39;t even<br/>
have to split experience with him!  You can do the same thing with ANY buffing class.<br/>
<br/>
Hell, I&#39;ve been in fights where the Warriors turned on autoattack and then said &quot;AFK&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the ONLY thing this really ends up correcting for is parking a Bard in a corner to get instrument<br/>
skills up.  But I would wager quite a bit of money that there isn&#39;t a single Bard on any server who has,<br/>
for example, maxed Brass Instruments skill through normal usage alone.  It&#39;s used too rarely, and it goes<br/>
up much too slowly.  And that and wind instruments are really the only songs we would do this with.<br/>
<br/>
Do Bards LEVEL too fast?<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t begin to address what happens when you arbitrarily break group invis (even if the Bard is AT<br/>
the keyboard) - you&#39;re all visible, and often dead; or levitation (same thing) - you all plummet to the<br/>
ground; or the level 51 travel song (same thing) - you&#39;re all visible AND you plummet to the ground; or<br/>
underwater breathing (you have about 30 seconds here) - you all drown.  What a nifty way to render 4 songs<br/>
utterly useless in one fell swoop.<br/>
<br/>
The US Department of Labor says that you should take a break from your computer at least once every half<br/>
hour or risk serious health complications.  If they really make this change, we&#39;re tied to our computer<br/>
for the entire time we&#39;re playing this game.<br/>
<br/>
Much as I gripe sometimes about their incompentent balancing with regards to Bards, I still like the<br/>
class, and I hate to have to switch to something else.  Their &quot;play another class&quot; response is really<br/>
bogus when it takes 40 played days to get a character to a high enough level for me to do things with my<br/>
quasi-uber-guild.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do if they make a change like this.  I really can&#39;t see continuing<br/>
to play my Bard.  And I&#39;m not thrilled with the idea of having to level something else.<br/>
<br/>
If they do this, it may be time to quit.  If I don&#39;t get myself banned.<br/>

&gt; I just came across this thread in whineplay, which I think all of you should<br/>
&gt; take a look at.  Evidently there has been a change to the mechanics of bard<br/>
&gt; song on Test:<br/>

&gt; It appears that this change is to keep us from indefinitely playing a song<br/>
&gt; while AFK.  The message received is evidently &quot;Your song ends abruptly&quot;, and<br/>
&gt; has a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant seems to be<br/>
&gt; putting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from the keyboard if<br/>
&gt; we want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the keyboard to keep one<br/>
&gt; song up as well.  I guess bards dont need bathroom breaks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>
