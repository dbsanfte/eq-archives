<div id="ygrps-yiv-681329714">Most of my alts are female (wanna make something of it?), and I have to agree with Wendy.  Not only are<br/>
there a lot of players in this game who don&#39;t know how to relate to women, there are some players in this<br/>
game I really think should be locked up for the safety of their female townsfolk.<br/>

&gt; For an even more frightening study, do a survey of the types of remarks real<br/>
&gt; women get in tells while playing this game.  While I know there are any<br/>
&gt; number of &quot;normal&quot; men playing this game (at least I hope).. there is a<br/>
&gt; disturbing number of men with absolutely NO idea of how to interact socially<br/>
&gt; with women.  Frightening.  And yes, I am prepared for the flames from the<br/>
&gt; overgeneralized, stereotyping remark I have just made.  Someday though, I<br/>
&gt; will have to compile my screenshots for some amusement!<br/>
