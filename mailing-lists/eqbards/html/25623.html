You will need to download and install DirectX 8.1<br/>

&gt;over a week now to see this short little sob and he has yet to show his<br/>
&gt;face. I need him to spawn to complete my 9th Coldain Ring quest. On my way<br/>
&gt;out to work this morning I was going to see if Dain was up, so I tried to<br/>
&gt;log in real fast, but I couldn&#39;t get the patch to start. I didn&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt;time to play EQ last night. Yesterday at work, I tore myself away from my<br/>
&gt;work and emailed to my home address DirectX8 and my newest sound and video<br/>
&gt;drivers. I just need to install them now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, so now for my question, is the reason I couldn&#39;t log on this morning<br/>
&gt;because I have not downloaded DirectX yet? If so, which DirectX do I need<br/>
&gt;8.0 or 8.1?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the help! My gnome warrior thanks you also! </span></blockquote></div>
