<b>Subject:</b> RE: voicegraft & roleplaying and some good and stupid experiences ... (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-875255026">This is a long read, it goes from one subject to another... sorry for its<br/>
lenght, just that it reminded me of some of the good and sad things in the<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
I agree voice graft is fun.  Our big green shadowknight troll is always<br/>
playing with his pet. And lately we&#39;ve been tormenting gnome guards alot.<br/>
But the newbies love us, we help them out, give them some loot and we even<br/>
have some that run to the vendors for us for food and water. And they&#39;ll<br/>
even buy us beer. No other groups that hunt them will actually do this to<br/>
the newbies.. <br/>
<br/>
But anyways, back to voicegraft, The troll loves to use voicegraft on his<br/>
pet and start playing with the newbies. It gives them a good experience...<br/>
His pet told a newbie his real name is really Bones the other day.  So many<br/>
instances he&#39;s played tricks on them.<br/>
<br/>
Its nice, as not all newbies are level 50&#39;s with twinked characters. Its<br/>
nice to see a level 4 newbie thank you after you&#39;ve given him 1 or 2 loots<br/>
and your coppers that you&#39;d destroy out of many hours of killing and stating<br/>
that he is ever so thankfull as it will help him and his wife start playing<br/>
the game.  You see at those levels, there&#39;s no kill stealers except the<br/>
guards, which we were disposing of. If they&#39;d have a train of spiders they&#39;d<br/>
run to us and we&#39;d dispose of it. <br/>
<br/>
One thing that dissapointed me is that there&#39;s a rumor that all guards will<br/>
be made level 53. Now tell me this, how are players supposed to overthrow a<br/>
city if all the guards are level 53? Can you imagine zoning into nektulos<br/>
and whap whap you&#39;re dead to a level 53 mob that was trained to the zone<br/>
edge?  I dont know about others, but when im higher level i want to take<br/>
over a city, maybe Akanon or something (its hard as our group is good and<br/>
evil, so we have to pick which races to war with).<br/>
<br/>
We were even bugged by a guide once asking us to stop killing the guards,<br/>
tell me why this is?  We&#39;re not exploiting, we&#39;re not kill stealing, we&#39;re<br/>
not training, we weren&#39;t shouting to the zone like most idiots do when they<br/>
kill a dark elf guard, we were being overly generous to the newbies that<br/>
swarmed and cheered around us practically. <br/>
<br/>
Seems that being nice, not exploiting or kill stealing is frowned upon, go<br/>
figure...<br/>

&gt; In the strictest powergaming terms, the Voice Graft spell isn&#39;t worth<br/>
&gt; much. But in in roleplaying terms it can be hilarious. I allude to an<br/>
&gt; incident I had several weeks ago whilst playing my gnome magician.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I was in North Ro making Dorn&#39;s life a living hell. (hey, after all, he<br/>
&gt; does it to everyone else, so turn about is fair play.) As I was waiting<br/>
&gt; for Dorn to gather his charcoaled body parts back together (respawn), a<br/>
&gt; dark elf necromancer happened by and didn&#39;t care too much for what I was<br/>
&gt; doing to his kinsman. Unable or unwilling to take any direct action<br/>
&gt; against me, instead he cast the Voice Graft spell upon my summoned<br/>
&gt; elemental (I was not aware this had happened at the time of course.) Next<br/>
&gt; thing I know, my elemental begins to berate me for a number of things<br/>
&gt; (like he had this long laundry list of complaints he had been saving up<br/>
&gt; andf just now had the opportunity to voice them.) He accused me of being<br/>
&gt; overbearing, a coward (I always sent the elemental into a fight first and<br/>
&gt; hid behind him like any good mage would), and of course, called me SHORT!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, out of character, I knew what the necro had done and was almost<br/>
&gt; laughing my @ss off, but in character, my gnome was furious with the<br/>
&gt; disrespect he was being shown. So he calmly and cooly stated (with /say so<br/>
&gt; the necro could here it) &quot;Your statements may or may not be true. But<br/>
&gt; always remember that it is I who hold ultimate control over your meager<br/>
&gt; existence.&quot; I then followed this with a /pet get lost command, to which<br/>
&gt; the pet stated, as he always does, &quot;As you wish Master.&quot; My insolent pet<br/>
&gt; was gone and the dark elf necro and I had an excellent role playing<br/>
&gt; experience, though we never actually exchanged a word during the entire<br/>
&gt; episode. All due to the &quot;worthless&#39; Voice Graft spell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, any one who can have that kind of sense of humor and is not playing a<br/>
&gt; bard is wasting their talent.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well then the problem with this is that all mages get this spell which is<br/>
&gt; also useless not to mention other useless spells. For instance Necros get<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; spell called Voice Graft that lets you talk through your pet. What good is<br/>
&gt; that?<br/>
