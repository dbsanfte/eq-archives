<div id="ygrps-yiv-710304145">I have an enchanter friend that I have grouped with since we were both 6th<br/>
level.  He is now 26th level and I&#39;m a 23d.  He is great at leading a group<br/>
in combat, both with his spells as well as his tact.  In almost every<br/>
situation the two of us group together, our groups have worked like fine<br/>
tuned engines.  Only when something bad like someone dropping a train on us<br/>
will anyone die.  I&#39;ve found only a few other people as good as him at being<br/>
a group leader.  I would also like to think that I&#39;m pretty good at it (I&#39;m<br/>
in the Army in RL so if I&#39;m not good at leading people your tax dollars are<br/>
going to waste:-).  With that said, if I find myself joining a group with a<br/>
leader who does not lead or people object when I make suggestions, I am wary<br/>
about remaining in the group.  If they keep doing stupid stuff I will<br/>
politely leave the group.  If I think my chances of staying alive are pretty<br/>
good I will tough it out and hopefully educate them about grouping with a<br/>
bard.  <br/>
