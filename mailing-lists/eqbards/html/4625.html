&gt; When I first got this song at 25, it did 4 points per hit.  At<br/>
&gt; 29, this changed to 5 points per hit.  If this trend holds,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s 1 extra damage every 4 levels.  L25-28 = 4, L29-32 = 5,<br/>
&gt; L33-36 = 6, L37-40 = 7, L41-44 = 8, L45-48 = 9, L49-50 = 10.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hate to correct you John, (Actually, I&#39;m glad to see you get something<br/>
wrong! j/k) but at 26, Psalm started doing 5 per hit.  So, maybe<br/>
every 4 levels - 26-30, 31-34...?<br/>

&gt; shields.  I thought it didn&#39;t because I only saw the &quot;is<br/>
&gt; pierced by thorns&quot; message. A druid cast shield of barbs on me<br/>
&gt; while I was playing PoW, and I also only got the &quot;pierced by<br/>
&gt; thorns&quot; message.  But the damage was the sum of the thorns and<br/>
&gt; PoW.  So only the message is in error, the damage is still<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It stacks great, but it will only stack if the druid/ranger shield is<br/>
casted first, then psalm is started. If you already have psalm up, the<br/>
druid shield will just wipe over it, until the next tick.<br/>
