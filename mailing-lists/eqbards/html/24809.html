<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-106312683">Both the Vox and Naggy raids on Veeshan end in wipeouts too sometimes.<br/>
Which is absolutly absurd considering the equipment avialable these days.<br/>
The last straw for me was a group losely termed &quot;Coalition of Bards&quot; who was<br/>
organized by a friend of mine to get a 5 bards and 3 pals their vox epic<br/>
peices.  The G1 cleric spent the enitre prep time asking me what loot he<br/>
would get, ignoring the instructions being shouted aout buffing.  I just<br/>
sang the cancel magic song repeatedly as he continued buffing us (we were<br/>
having a level 60 cleric and shaman friend buff everyone AFTER 4 dummy<br/>
buffs).  A monk on the raid TWICE agroed Vox on the buff area, among<br/>
countless other idiocy.<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to never get my Epic if it meant never being on a raid like<br/>
that again.</div>
