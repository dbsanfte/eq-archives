<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225707492">I went and visited the shady swashbuckler in the tunnel between east<br/>
commons and north ro.  He is normally indifferent to me.  I checked<br/>
his price on a couple of weapons then sung the charismatic song and<br/>
he became amiable to me.  He still wanted the same amount of money<br/>
for those well balanced weapons though.<br/>

&gt; Not sure if this has been posted yet, but an interesting side<br/>
&gt; benefit of the<br/>
&gt; song is that you can now do quests with NPC&#39;s who would not talk to<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; before.  This is possibly one of the biggest uses of the song<br/>
&gt; besides<br/>
&gt; selling items at better prices.<br/>
