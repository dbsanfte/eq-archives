It depends on your encumberance mostly if others outrun you. I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>
if I carry any more items than my banded and essentials, that almost any druid,<br/>
mage or younger bard will pass me up!<br/>
<br/>
For Information:  Spirit of Wolf is not stackable with our Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
anymore. It was quite nice when it was however! Shaman get the spell the<br/>
earliest at level 9, while Druids I think get it at level 14.</div>
