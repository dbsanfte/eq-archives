of Greater Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
A couple days ago, one of the guys in my guild was getting frustrated w/<br/>
his (20ish) halfling thief, and asked for recommendations on a good<br/>
class to try.  As I haven&#39;t tried many other classes, I didn&#39;t recommend<br/>
anything, but the rest of my guild was VERY pro bard.  As one of only 2<br/>
bards in the guild, I tried to answer the specific questions as honestly<br/>
as possible, the good & the nerf&#39;ed, but didn&#39;t try to swing him one way<br/>
or other.  I just sat back, glowing with bardish pride, as the rest of<br/>
the guild discussed (for about 4 hrs running) the merits of our fine<br/>
class.  Yesterday, a young Helf bard walked up to me, and introduced<br/>
himself.  I was quite happy to invite his new character into our guild.<br/>
<br/>
We may be a small class in numbers, but I am pleased to say we are NOT<br/>
under appreciated.<br/>
