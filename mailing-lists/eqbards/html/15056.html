(18.2 dam/hit)*(0.56 hits/attempt)*(1 attempt/2.4 sec) = 4.24 dam/sec<br/>
This is the damage/sec you do with the weapon in real combat -<br/>
useful for comparing your damage contribution to another<br/>
player&#39;s (whose miss rate may differ from yours)<br/>
<br/>
If you want to eliminate misses as a factor in the comparison,<br/>
you calculate it assuming 100% hits:<br/>
<br/>
(18.2 dam/hit)*(1.00 hits/attempt)*(1 attempt/2.4 sec) = 7.56 dam/sec<br/>
This is the damage/sec you&#39;d use to compare the melee damage<br/>
to another weapon you may want to wield (based on the<br/>
assumption that your hit/miss ratio is the same using either<br/>
weapon).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a complication with proc damage that I won&#39;t get<br/>
into, which is why it&#39;s only listed with the real-use dam/sec.  <br/>
