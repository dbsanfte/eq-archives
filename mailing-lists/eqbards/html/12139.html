&gt; God I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not on E&#39;ci.  I only hope I can get out of Sol B before it<br/>
&gt; degenerates to the state of your server.  Right now on Prexus, if you have<br/>
&gt; the pool room, you have about 15 greater kobold spawns that are all yours<br/>
&gt; and all the spawn points cycle every 25 minutes.  Luckily people are kind<br/>
&gt; enough not to pull through you (so far), which means a constant barage of<br/>
&gt; XP.  Has anyone tried Paw?  Over camping of Lower Guk and Sol B was the<br/>
&gt; reason that &quot;new&quot; Paw came into existance I thought.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the new Paw was intended for &quot;mid&quot; level players but Verant never<br/>
tells us what range they consider mid. I hear that deeper in there are<br/>
gnolls blue to L45+ players but I have yet to make it in that far.<br/>
To get there requires you to make your way through a ton of green<br/>
casters.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly a more time consuming job than making it to the champ<br/>
room of sol b, or the frenzied or lord room in lguk, even when those<br/>
dungeons are empty, and definately something that would be very<br/>
difficult for a pickup group.<br/>
