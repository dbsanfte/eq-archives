Its good to see that so many of us are really as intersested in music as our<br/>
characters are.  Personally, I have sung and played guitar off and on in<br/>
several bands in my area for the last 7 years.  I have also helped record<br/>
and produce several of my friends&#39; band&#39;s cd&#39;s (anyone ever heard of<br/>
Middlefinger?).  I am now working with some ex-bandmates writing bit music<br/>
for indy films (horror mostly).  I love my music in world and out.  I only<br/>
wish it were as profitable in Real Life!!<br/>
