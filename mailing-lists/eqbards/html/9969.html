<b>Subject:</b> Re: Looting Issue <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136904559">I&#39;ve noticed all of the issues people have complained about so far.  The<br/>
problem (like most grouping  problems) are usually the worst in &quot;pick-up<br/>
groups&quot; and nonexistent in regular and guild groups.  Otherwise most systems<br/>
work pretty well.  When doing FFA&#39;s I tell people to count five corpses then<br/>
loot the sixth one (assuming a six-member party).  With &quot;honorable&quot; people<br/>
it works pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
    What galls me the most are the rash of characters named &quot;Aaaba&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Aaada&quot; (the three a&#39;s is NOT a typo here).  Obviously these character names<br/>
were decided purely to go first in alpha loot.  With a character name<br/>
starting with &quot;S&quot; I&#39;m usually one of the last to loot.  Even in &quot;honorable&quot;<br/>
groups - when we do the 5pp or item loot - I often don&#39;t get my turn.<br/>
However - I usually am with my guildmates who will split their share with me<br/>
in those cases - often even when I don&#39;t ask!<br/>
