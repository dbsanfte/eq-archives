<br/>
Lament (Song 8) is used &#39;pre-battle&#39; to prevent other mobs from <br/>
joining in and helping a friend. A sucessfull lament will _NOT_ <br/>
add you to a mob&#39;s hate list, thus they will still be standing there<br/>
waiting for you to pull it.<br/>
<br/>
Lullabye (Song 15) is used to &#39;sleep&#39; mobs once they have already <br/>
attacked. Typically, as long as no one hits htem, and they are <br/>
&#39;nodding&#39;, they are just standing there. Good crowd control. It is <br/>
an AE (Area of effect) song.<br/>
<br/>
Melodic Binding (song 20) is an AE song that slows the mobs down (ie<br/>
attacks) and lowers their AC slightly. Takes the sting out of hard <br/>
hitters.<br/>
<br/>
Chain (Song 23 i think) is essentially the same as ensnare (druid) <br/>
It &#39;slows&#39; the mob down when it trys to run. (Similar to root, but <br/>
the wonderful thing about snare is that a snared running monster <br/>
doesnt fight back, but a &#39;rooted&#39; monster DOES fight back. Same for<br/>
casters.<br/>
<br/>
(Works wonderfully with &#39;Fear&#39; (song 26))  (snare the monster, then<br/>
fear them, and the mob sits there and trys to run away while you beat <br/>
it in the back =)) (repeat as the monster comes unfear&#39;d)<br/>
<br/>
Charm is where you take control of a mob and force it to attack another<br/>
mob. (or sit down or whatever else pets do =)) (10 sec duration)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have my bard - and I have an enchanter. The enchanters <br/>
&gt; &gt; charisma is nearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; twice that of my bard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I just WISH her lull lined worked as effectively as lament <br/>
&gt; &gt; has for me since<br/>
&gt; &gt; the day I got it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if lament is really that great, why are you higher level folks always<br/>
&gt; arguing about whether crowd control is best done with Lullaby, Chain, or<br/>
&gt; Charm?  Is it just that they hit multiple mobs at once?  Or are they<br/>
