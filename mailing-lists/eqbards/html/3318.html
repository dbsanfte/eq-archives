&gt;      OUCH!  If this is true then Weaving songs may not be the best of <br/>
&gt;      ideas.  More chances for a full damage hit.  Anyone else notice this?  <br/>
&gt;      I will watch closely from now on but my general impression is that he <br/>
&gt;      might be right...  Makes being a support bard make much more sense.<br/>
&gt;      If this is true (shudder) then this could change the whole methodology <br/>
&gt;      behind running a bard character.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really hope that I am incorrect, but that would also explain why we are<br/>
attacked when starting up a song.  It makes us appear to be vulnerable<br/>
instead of being a threat.  I think I will try to check this out provided<br/>
my ISP doesn&#39;t lag me out tonight.  Hmm.. I think I will start a newbie<br/>
character tonight and do some trial runs attack very basic creatures like<br/>
bats to confirm this.  Though Chant is not a good thing to use since it<br/>
makes us harder to hit =).<br/>
