<b>Subject:</b> Song Selection Advice for a Level 35 Singer <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121523897">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was in the Assassin/Supplier in Lower Guk for the first time.  Had<br/>
myself (35 Bard), 44 Paladin, 46 Shaman, 44 Rouge, and 51 Warrior.  I was having<br/>
trouble selecting which songs to use.<br/>
<br/>
The Shaman was speeding and Primary healer. I was there for Crowd Control (I had<br/>
an easy time with and blues and Zols which are low Red but hard time with Wan&#39;s<br/>
that were Yellow), Manasong, Snaring and ?.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 Song weave was Cantana (34), Snare (23) and Chant of Battle or Damage<br/>
Shield. After a while the Shaman got enough mana back after buffing to<br/>
slow/speed etc.  So I switched to Chant of Battle primarily.  During downtime I<br/>
did straight mana and depending on our condition would weave Cantana in as well.<br/>
<br/>
What other suggestions for Song Selection do you guys/gals have? I also had<br/>
Pixie, Charm, Heal song, Manasong, and Area Fear mem&#39;ed. At level 35 what else<br/>
could I have done? I know I could have used Elemental Rhythms (MR/FR/CR) or even<br/>
Gaurdian Rhythms (MR). Any other suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions and help.<br/>
<br/>
