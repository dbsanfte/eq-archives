&gt; Bleh.  Cleared most of Hate Friday (8+ hours), got no bard<br/>

&gt; Innoruk was AWOL.  Cleared all of Hate last night (11+ hours),<br/>
&gt; got no bard stuff, Maestro dropped a monk mask, Innoruk had<br/>
&gt; been killed the previous night.<br/>

&gt; Further fuel for the buggy RNG theory - we got 4 pieces of<br/>

 </span></blockquote>3 days in Hate this weekend. First night the zone crashed just as we<br/>
were cleared to the Maestro. Absolutely no bard stuff dropped. I think<br/>
Warrior legs dropped the first night, then no more all weekend. No Mage<br/>
stuff dropped, a few shaman pieces. In general, other than cleric stuff,<br/>
the drop rate is just pitiful and has a few people who&#39;ve been going for<br/>
several months contemplating quitting as there&#39;s just not much point to<br/>
playing anymore. Playing for fun isn&#39;t once you&#39;ve done Hate a few<br/>
times, as IMO, it&#39;s one of the most boring zones they&#39;ve created. The<br/>
fast spawning roamers keep you camped in the same locations for hours<br/>
and even if you did move around every place looks pretty well like every<br/>
other place.<br/>
<br/>
To top it off, a 6 note blade dropped and all the bards had one, and<br/>
Inno dropped a fatty shaman hammer and there were no fatty shaman on the<br/>
trip.<br/>
<br/>
And to add to the buggy RNG theory, I foraged 100 vegetables over the<br/>
weekend compared to 20-40 of fruit, berries and rabbit meat. What are<br/>
the odds of that happening? :)<br/>
