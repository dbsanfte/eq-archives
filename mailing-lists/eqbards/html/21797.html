 </span></blockquote>that kind of depends on what your definition of balanced is.  if your definition<br/>
of balanced is &#39;&#39;can do the exact same things as&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;can get the exact same<br/>
experience as in the same amount of time solo&#39;&#39; then of course you will see<br/>
bards as underpowered.  but a bard (played well) is much more of an asset<br/>
in any dungeon than a druid overall.  a bard can solo much better than a warrior<br/>
or paladin.  a bard is not as good as an enchanter in very hi level situations, i.e.<br/>
53+.  a bard can&#39;t solo quite as well as a druid.  seems like we have lots of options<br/>
and while we may not be the best at any one thing we are pretty darn good at<br/>
a lot of them, at least as far as i can tell up to 53.  maybe at 56 or 57 we turn<br/>
more one dimensional but i haven&#39;t seen it yet.</div>
