<div id="ygrps-yiv-819257246">I play on Veeshan also, it can get busy at times but me being from England<br/>
I get to play when the servers are under populated (1200-1400 ppl). I know<br/>
what you mean about experience though, I have only recently got through 40<br/>
(took me 3 weeks). An excellent place for exp at your level would be Dwarf<br/>
NPC&#39;s in Butcherblock, you only loose faction with the residents and not<br/>
guards. If you can get a 2 spawn dwarf camp you can sit there for hours<br/>
Charming them and then killing the winner using Fear/snare (or Kiting). The<br/>
spawns are 12 minutes usually but they are great exp. Also solo&#39;ing giants<br/>
is another good option.<br/>
<br/>
If not you could try Mistmoore, if you can get a group from your guild to<br/>
take you there and simply powerlevel you I can assure you that you will get<br/>
through 35 in a day. I made 1.5 bubs of level 35 exp in 3 hours and I was<br/>
grouped with level 45+ people.<br/>
<br/>
you will get there, don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>

Looking for fun and adventure at level 35 on Veeshan....<br/>
Please don&#39;t say Guk.  I can walk from live side tower to dead side tower<br/>
and not run into a single NPC in lower guk on veeshan.  The server is THAT<br/>
crowded.  Almost 50%+ of the players are 35+ now (server REALLY needs to be<br/>
split).  Soldung B is the same.  Asside from doing FG&#39;s or Efreet with my<br/>
guild there&#39;s no point in even visiting those two dungeons unless I&#39;m after<br/>
a specific item.  (No problem getting in a group, but XP is another<br/>
question entirely).<br/>
<br/>
I hunted in Kithicor last night, that was fun.  I&#39;d LOVE to get a group<br/>
together to do PAW but I rarely have time to get into an organized group.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, advice welcome.  I made it to 50 on Test BEFORE there was ever more<br/>
than 300 people online at a time.  Test was pristine back then.  On Veeshan<br/>
I have a hard time levelling just because I can&#39;t find anything to kill.<br/>
Everything is camped to high heaven.  Even giants are hard to find these<br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
Ungh!<br/>
<br/>
1800-2200 players online.  60-70% are hunting the high level areas....<br/>
**sighs**<br/>
<br/>
And people wonder why I spend most of my time in Asheron&#39;s Call now.<br/>
