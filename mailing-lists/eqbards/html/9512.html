<div id="ygrps-yiv-433400129">I played AC in the beta and I liked it.  I think it&#39;s a good game..maybe<br/>
even a very good game.  It&#39;s not going to be the knockout that EQ was to UO<br/>
but it is going to be a very viable MMORPG.  The thing that Verant needs to<br/>
be concerned about is that Microsoft is a marketing machine and I bet before<br/>
long you will see AC&#39;s player base eclipse EQ&#39;s.  Even if the game is not<br/>
that good or percieved as not being a great game..Microsoft&#39;s marketing<br/>
could easily make it the leader in the MMORPG subscriber base.  I really<br/>
don&#39;t see this affecting EQ&#39;s current player base..which I think are very<br/>
loyal (I know I&#39;m not planning on leaving)..but I think it could put a<br/>
serious dent in their future growth.  If you made it this far I apologize<br/>
for the marketing discussion :-(.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll be really surprised if Asheron&#39;s Call is much of a threat to EQ.<br/>
