<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Mistmore Drums <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-918353780">Last night my regular bunch went into Mistmore to fetch a pair of fangs for<br/>
our ranger who just hit 50 and is thinking about the Call of Flame quest. We<br/>
took the Butler room and proceeded to pull from as far as the ballroom, we<br/>
had a great time since we&#39;re overpowered for that zone. In the course of the<br/>
evening we pulled Mynthi davissi and got another Mistmore drum, on the last<br/>
visit my secondary character got one, and my friend the wizard won the roll.<br/>
My question is how valuable is it?<br/>
<br/>
Curious thing is we&#39;ve killed Mynthi Davissi two times now and nothing but<br/>
the rare drop. Of course we&#39;re not complaining, our warrior is very happy<br/>
with the Hooded Black Cloak that dropped last night as well.<br/>
