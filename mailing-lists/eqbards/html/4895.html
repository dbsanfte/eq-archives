they&#39;d root you, run back out of melee range, and nuke you.  <br/>
But that would put Verant in the position of having to fix the<br/>
caster/melee imbalance in PvP.<br/>

A trick for getting these casters to come within melee range<br/>
is to charm them, and order them to follow you.  When they get<br/>
next to you, tell them to sit and wait for charm to wear off.<br/>
