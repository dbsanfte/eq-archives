<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223748599">Ok, so you&#39;re with an enchanter<br/>
<br/>
What can&#39;t an enchanter do or what that an enchanter can do can I enhance?:<br/>
<br/>
Heal: <br/>
Mem HOR<br/>
<br/>
DMG Shield:  <br/>
Mem Psalm of Warmth (Cooling DETRACTS from magician sheilds I never use it unless fighting fire critters)<br/>
<br/>
Fast Escape:  <br/>
Mem Selos (hehe it&#39;s ALWAYS memmed unless I&#39;m indoors)<br/>
<br/>
Evac:<br/>
Mem AE Fear (it&#39;s not QUITE as good but it is nice.  I can guarantee my group will get out and I will make it 75% of the time - Always memmed-)<br/>
<br/>
Get stuff off himself:<br/>
Mem Charm (always memmed)<br/>
<br/>
He mezzes... I manadrain<br/>
Mem Denon&#39;s Dissention (No mana for you, you silly casters)<br/>
<br/>
He can clarity, so can I, they stack:<br/>
Mem Clarity<br/>
<br/>
He can buff, so can I:<br/>
Mem any str/whatever buff.  If 49th mem NiV&#39;s it&#39;s way better<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t snare<br/>
Mem Chains<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s only one possible set of songs.  There are LOTS of others.<br/>
<br/>
Grouping with an enchanter is a challenge because they over-write a lot of our abilities.  But we also complement alot of theirs.  So if you do group with one, and you do it right, you can form a very powerful duo with them.  There&#39;s no reason you should be affraid to group with an enchanter.  You&#39;re a bard, you can group with anyone.  You just need to learn not to get locked into 1 set of songs that you try to use for all situations.  Our songs are VERY situation dependent (for the most part).  They all have uses. Its up to us to figure out when they are best used.<br/>
