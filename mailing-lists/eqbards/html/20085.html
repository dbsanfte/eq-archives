<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
He can buff, so can I:<br/>
Mem any str/whatever buff.  If 49th mem NiV&#39;s it&#39;s way better<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t snare<br/>
Mem Chains<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s only one possible set of songs.  There are LOTS of others.<br/>
<br/>
Grouping with an enchanter is a challenge because they over-write a lot of our abilities.  But we also complement alot of theirs.  So if you do group with one, and you do it right, you can form a very powerful duo with them.  There&#39;s no reason you should be affraid to group with an enchanter.  You&#39;re a bard, you can group with anyone.  You just need to learn not to get locked into 1 set of songs that you try to use for all situations.  Our songs are VERY situation dependent (for the most part).  They all have uses. Its up to us to figure out when they are best used.<br/>
