<div id="ygrps-yiv-428806078">Ok, I did a quickie chart to list all of our damage songs and fill in some<br/>
numbers:<br/>

<br/>
(this chart presumes you are using an instrument)<br/>
<br/>
I would say that the best 3 song mix at level 50 is: SCC(48), TCF(38 or 46 -<br/>
either one if they do the same dmg & of course the one that is resisted<br/>
less) & DDD(18).  Ugh swapping 3 different instruments.  This would make me<br/>
choose the best songs for a 2 instrument swap that would have the best<br/>
chances of sticking.<br/>
<br/>
Also, looking at the chart,  bards dont get the opportunity to weave 3<br/>
stacked songs until level 30 and then FCC(30) is likely resisted because of<br/>
the low difference in level between mob and song. So more like 32 or 33<br/>
before you get good results from weaving 3 stacked dmg songs.<br/>
