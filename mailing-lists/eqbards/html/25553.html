&gt; &gt;I am not really sure what to do at this website... if you could give a<br/>
&gt; &gt;little more detailed info that would help... and maybe you could send an<br/>
&gt; &gt;email when i can get back on EQ today...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not to be rude - but did you even go there?  The link takes you to the<br/>
&gt; front page.  The very first article in big black letters says &quot;PATCH<br/>
&gt; MESSAGE&quot;  Trust me - it won&#39;t bite.<br/>
