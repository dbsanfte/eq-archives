<div id="ygrps-yiv-367014915">Actually the reason it did not stick is that a couple of months ago they <br/>
patched charm so that you could not charm a pet while the summoner is still <br/>
alive.<br/>

&gt;Hey Beatdrop....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The reason why your charm did not stick was the fact that you were still<br/>
&gt;grouped with the Magician.  When grouped all spells and effects that are<br/>
&gt;harmful to your group members does not hit.  I know for a fact that charm<br/>
&gt;works.  Heck I used it on my bride to be two patches after the PvP charm<br/>
&gt;patch and it worked without a problem.  If this is not the case then my<br/>
&gt;bride will spank this poor bard when we duel this coming Saturday...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Last night I was in a group in Highkeep and we got on the topic of <br/>
&gt;dueling.  While I was running my mouth, the magician I was with challenged <br/>
&gt;me to a duel.  We were the same level (29) and I said what the hell.  He <br/>
&gt;had a fire elemental pet that was blue to me so I decided that the only way <br/>
&gt;I would stand a chance would be to try to charm him into fighting his pet.  <br/>
&gt;Well, let me just say that I thought charm was only nerfed on the PvP <br/>
&gt;servers and NOT in PvP mode.  Wrong!  So I start the duel with the thought <br/>
&gt;of charming him.  Hit the song, and wait, and wait, and wait... no pulse! <br/>
&gt;WTF? So I try charming his pet that is now attacking me.  Resist, resist, <br/>
&gt;(thinking cool, its pulsing, gonna work), charm sticks but no charm! <br/>
&gt;Instead I got a message saying &#39;This NPC cannot be charmed.&#39; Dammit! NOOO!  <br/>
&gt;Meanwhile, I am getting the hell nuked out of me while trying to figure out <br/>
&gt;what to do next.  So I die.  I pop back up and my opponents health bar is <br/>
&gt;down (still grouped) and I hear &#39;Beat, Demi is getting the sh*t kicked out <br/>
&gt;of him.&#39;  Come to find out, after looting my corpse, that after I died, his <br/>
&gt;pet agro&#39;d on him.  Strange charm bug is what I am assuming.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone on the list dueled a magician or a caster with a pet and won? <br/>
&gt;  He was a really cool guy and I asked him for a rematch some other time.  <br/>
&gt;My new tactic is just like how I would fight a wizzie, below him to death.  <br/>
&gt;His pet wasn&#39;t hitting to hard and I think I can solo his pet by melee and <br/>
&gt;songs.  So, I think I can take him by just staying on his butt and keeping <br/>
&gt;his spells interrupted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any other suggestions?  I am also assuming that Screech won&#39;t work <br/>
&gt;either.<br/>
