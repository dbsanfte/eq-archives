<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613369853">i can understand that.  i would say almost all of the players that did leave<br/>
a guild and join the new one were not caught off guard.  they were aware<br/>
this new guild was being formed and its purpose, and were planning on<br/>
joining anyway.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; If you ask someone in a different guild if they want to join <br/>
&gt; &gt; yours, IMHO,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you ARE stealing players from that other guild. If they are <br/>
&gt; &gt; not currently<br/>
&gt; &gt; IN a guild and/or ask you if they can join your guild, then <br/>
&gt; you aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; stealing, it was their choice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s their choice anyway.  But I think the best thing to do <br/>
&gt; would have the<br/>
&gt; leader of the guild looking to recruit contact the leader of <br/>
&gt; the players<br/>
&gt; current guild and let them know what they&#39;re doing and why.  <br/>
