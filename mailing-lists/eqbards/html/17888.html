<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953248081">Anyone got any tips on good hunting places at level 45? I am currently<br/>
almost 1 bub into 45 and am hoping to be out of 45 by the time Kunark is<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
I have been fighting bats/bugs in sol b (I like camping stone spider<br/>
room.....lots of space nice an easy to charm mobs), should I stay here or<br/>
is there other &#39;Hot Spots&#39; for exp that maybe I should try.....I don&#39;t like<br/>
guard killing, it is dull and boring...<br/>
