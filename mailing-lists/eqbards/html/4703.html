&gt;Bunch of my friends went a couple nights ago, warrior who is our guild<br/>
&gt;leader got the BladeStorm off the dracoliche.  i think another guild on<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;other server got this same sword off CazicThule himself.  ranger got thorny<br/>
&gt;arms and bracer, warrior got russet arms, cleric got the pruple boots,<br/>
&gt;enchanter got that sand-colored robe with the eyes on it.  good night, i<br/>
&gt;missed it was asleep, luckily no bard items were found.  i think i am at<br/>
&gt;work and as i type this my wife is playing and in fear, told me they got a<br/>
&gt;cryosilk cap for a wizard.  i really don&#39;t want to be at work right now =(<br/>

&gt;&gt; We didnt get any bracers, just arms. My friend tinen (lvl 41<br/>
&gt;&gt; bard) got the<br/>
&gt;&gt; arms since we where randoming everything that was obtained between the<br/>
&gt;&gt; classes that could use them. Me and tinen nearly fell over<br/>
&gt;&gt; laughing when we<br/>
&gt;&gt; found the first bard only item since we where the only 2<br/>
&gt;&gt; bards. But alas,<br/>
&gt;&gt; he got the first item, and we didnt find anymore for the<br/>
&gt;&gt; night since we<br/>
&gt;&gt; gated out shortly after that. All of this was on the first<br/>
&gt;&gt; day, before they<br/>
&gt;&gt; made it supposedly harder.<br/>
