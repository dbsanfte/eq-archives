&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Using the Lament song + a minor rant<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, 2 Jun 1999 14:40:11 -1000<br/>
&gt;After the initials battles, my party thanked me for using the Lament <br/>
&gt;tactic.<br/>
&gt;They all stated they had grouped with bards before and had never seen the<br/>
&gt;song used in the manner I had used it.  I thought that was odd because I<br/>
&gt;heard about the trick from this forum so assumed a lot of other people used<br/>
&gt;it frequently.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what&#39;s the point of this post?  Well, the bard community needs to <br/>
&gt;educate<br/>
&gt;the other classes on everything that we can do for a party.  A lot of other<br/>
&gt;players seem to think that our main purpose in a group is to play Selo,<br/>
&gt;Hymn, Anthem, and at higher levels, Mana regen.  I&#39;m only 13th level but<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve learned there is a lot more to it than that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If anyone else knows of similar tactics that only a bard can perform I <br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt;like to hear about them also.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, now that the song works in commercial I love it. Lament is THE song <br/>
for camp control, and it keeps clerics from having to expend mana using <br/>
their lull spell.<br/>
<br/>
I also find Lullaby incredibly useful when you&#39;re in an area full of blue <br/>
monsters when you are really looking to pull white or better for your party. <br/>
This happens alot in the orc pits in Oasis (the area near the lake, also <br/>
near the dervish camp where numerous orc warriors/priests can be found). <br/>
Whenever I can&#39; find anything harder to fight I will usually speed around <br/>
bellowing on at least 2 but sometimes up to 4 blue orcs and bring them back <br/>
to my party waiting at the lake shore. When the orcs arrive I sleep them <br/>
with Lullaby, attack, and my party /assists me.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;After we cleared out the initial cutthroats, we were pretty much able to<br/>
&gt;take them on one by one from that point on until we ran into a stumbling<br/>
&gt;block.  Here is what happened.  The paladin, the ranger and myself, aided <br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt;the Anthem could easily handle one cutthroat at a time.  However, our <br/>
&gt;wizard<br/>
&gt;insisted on expending his mana with direct damage spells even though the<br/>
&gt;tanks were whittling down the cutthroat without taking that much damage.<br/>
&gt;The damage we were taking could quickly be healed via the Hymn after the<br/>
&gt;combat was over.  What eventually happened was that the fully healed tanks<br/>
&gt;ended up standing around while the wizard meditated.  In the meantime, the<br/>
&gt;camp fully respawned.  This time, however, there were 3 mages plus a couple<br/>
&gt;of thugs.  I tried the Lament trick again but a mage resisted and everyone<br/>
&gt;got waxed except the wizard, who gated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t like telling other people how to play their character but how do <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;handle a magic user who insists on wasting his mana?  The group leader kept<br/>
&gt;telling him to save mana but it didn&#39;t do any good.  I can see using one<br/>
&gt;direct damage spell to help the combat but he would continue spellcasting<br/>
&gt;once the cutthroat started to flee.  At this point, no one was in any <br/>
&gt;danger<br/>
&gt;because the cutthroat was fighting back.  He created a lot of needless<br/>
&gt;downtime by his actions.  Any other recommendation other than finding a<br/>
&gt;different group to adventure with?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is clearly situation that the group leader should have taken control <br/>
of. If I was leading the party and something he was doing was disagreeable <br/>
with me and the rest of my party I would warn him. If he didn&#39;t switch his <br/>
tactics, I&#39;d boot him. Simple. I did this to a guy who kept jumping every <br/>
fallen orc we killed at Crusbone and taking all the loot. I told him we are <br/>
doing a loot order, period - stop jumping the loot, or I would kick him, and <br/>
that he wasn&#39;t going to make many friends doing that.. I guess he didn&#39;t <br/>
believe me. You should&#39;ve seen how fast he looted shit. Before the orc hit <br/>
the ground he was bending down to loot. BOOT, gone, cya. Of course he <br/>
apologized profusely after I kicked him, while i was advertising for a <br/>
replacement.<br/>
