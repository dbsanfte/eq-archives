<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808869735">Well, the other thing is to use it but get out of melee range of the mobs<br/>
you are sleeping.  it has a AE rdaius and if you move around - nod them then<br/>
back off so when they wake and take a swipe at you - you are out of melee<br/>
range.  ok, so you gotta dance as well as play and sing - but times that<br/>
seems to help.  there are times when you will HAVE to use it - no matter<br/>
what.<br/>
<br/>
we (my group) prefers that I mez targets for crowd control - because it<br/>
seems to be more effective and I get less damage when I do.  There is for me<br/>
a practical limit of 2 to 3 mobs that I can effectively keep pixified.  When<br/>
the need if for crowd control of 3 or 4 mobs while they fight number 5, I<br/>
HAVE to use lullaby.  Of course, they prefer the enchanter to do the crowd<br/>
control but sometimes she is not in the group and then it is my job.<br/>
<br/>
but mez is not in your song book yet so - lullaby when you HAVE to<br/>
(emergency) and dance out of melee range - that can help somewhat.<br/>

		Thanks for the advice. I think the best strategy is to only<br/>
use this song in<br/>
		groups I know. I&#39;ll skip it in pickup groups for now, unless<br/>
someone asks,<br/>
		or it&#39;s obvious they use /assist properly.<br/>

		&gt; Is there an echo in here?<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt; I wrote this PRECISE same message at your level - complete<br/>
with saying I&#39;d<br/>
		&gt; all but given up on teaching people to work with this song<br/>
correctly.  Now<br/>
		&gt; at level 28 I find that almost every competent group that<br/>
I join (maybe 7<br/>
		&gt; out of 10 of them) works this way without being instructed<br/>
to, and better<br/>
		&gt; yet, most are now familiar with spells like Lullaby or the<br/>
Enchanter&#39;s AE<br/>
		&gt; Mesmerization.  Yes, there are still groups that don&#39;t<br/>
understand Lullaby<br/>
		at<br/>
		&gt; my level, but they&#39;re typically much more open to<br/>
listening to and<br/>
		following<br/>
		&gt; my suggestions.  My frustration at your level was the same<br/>
- I&#39;d instruct<br/>
		a<br/>
		&gt; group and they&#39;d either ask me who made me God or ignore<br/>
me altogether.<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt; Bards are second only to Enchanters for crowd control.<br/>
Even your beefy<br/>
		&gt; Troll and Ogre buddies are going to watch their life drain<br/>
away with a<br/>
		bunch<br/>
		&gt; of blue and green mobs smacking on them.  A few<br/>
startlingly fast deaths in<br/>
		&gt; Permafrost, Runnyeye or Guk and your friends will be all<br/>
ears when you say<br/>
		&gt; you can do crowd control.<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt; Don&#39;t give up.  Keep explaining it to your groups so that<br/>
they&#39;ll know how<br/>
		&gt; things work 10 levels from now.  It will pay off in a few<br/>
levels when the<br/>
		&gt; tanks realize that their massive HPs only go so far, and<br/>
the casters<br/>
		realize<br/>
		&gt; how frighteningly fragile they are when the blue bar is<br/>
heading South.<br/>

		&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve almost given up on trying to perfect this (Lullaby)<br/>
with<br/>
		&gt; &gt; pickup groups<br/>
		&gt; &gt; at my level (16-19). Either nobody understands /assist,<br/>
they<br/>
		&gt; &gt; don&#39;t trust my<br/>
		&gt; &gt; lullaby to work, or they just plain don&#39;t listen. After<br/>
one<br/>
		&gt; &gt; nightmarish pull<br/>
		&gt; &gt; (&quot;A Orc Warrior&quot;s and Priests along the west side of<br/>
Oasis) in<br/>
		&gt; &gt; which I died<br/>
		&gt; &gt; because nobody would let my mobs sleep, I pulled out the<br/>
virtual<br/>
		&gt; &gt; chalkboard<br/>
		&gt; &gt; and went though it step-by-step:<br/>
		&gt; &gt;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; 1) I type MEZ<br/>
		&gt; &gt; 2) Everyone /assist the puller<br/>
		&gt; &gt; 3) Stay on one target until it is dead.<br/>
		&gt; &gt; 4) Healer watch my health as all the other baddies pound<br/>
on me<br/>
		&gt; &gt; between naps<br/>
		&gt; &gt;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; Everyone said OK. The very next nasty pull I typed MEZ<br/>
and watched as<br/>
		&gt; &gt; everybody chose their favorite Orc and nobody assisted<br/>
the puller. It<br/>
		was<br/>
		&gt; &gt; late so I said my goodbyes and shuffled home. I think it<br/>
will take a<br/>
		&gt; &gt; situation where this song noticeably saves lives before<br/>
people will be<br/>
		&gt; &gt; convinced. Next time I try it I&#39;m going to make sure to<br/>
Selo out<br/>
		&gt; &gt; of there if<br/>
		&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see a lot of /assisting going on. It only hurts<br/>
the bard to stay<br/>
		&gt; &gt; cause the mobs aren&#39;t going to leave him alone when<br/>
they&#39;re awake.<br/>
		&gt; &gt;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; The evening was fun and the xp was good, but I&#39;m looking<br/>
forward to<br/>
		&gt; &gt; graduating to more mature groups where satisfaction<br/>
comes from watching<br/>
		a<br/>
		&gt; &gt; good plan come together, rather than marvelling that we<br/>
didn&#39;t die when<br/>
		we<br/>
		&gt; &gt; deserved to.<br/>

		&gt; &gt; p.s. Who decided that non-SoW&#39;d trolls make good<br/>
pullers? The ten<br/>
		minutes<br/>
		&gt; &gt; ours was away selling I pulled and we killed twice as<br/>
many mobs<br/>
		&gt; &gt; with little<br/>
		&gt; &gt; downtime.<br/>

		&gt; &gt; &gt; This simple tactic seems to be the hardest think for<br/>
hybrid tanks to<br/>
		&gt; &gt; learn.<br/>
		&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen even mid 30&#39;s (typically in HK where it is<br/>
after all<br/>
		&quot;safe&quot;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; and<br/>
		&gt; &gt; &gt; you don&#39;t have to be really skilled to survive) not<br/>
follow this really<br/>
		&gt; &gt; &gt; simple yet effective proceedure.<br/>
		&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
		&gt; &gt; &gt; It works!  It really, really works!<br/>
