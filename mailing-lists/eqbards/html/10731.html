<div id="ygrps-yiv-649823712">I think we&#39;ve all agreed on the same thing, which is do what<br/>
   suits the group best.  I&#39;m not trying to mislead anyone or <br/>
   say one path is better than another.  I do know that many <br/>
   players are very picky and childish at times when they don&#39;t<br/>
   get their way.  These same people are also either very high<br/>
   level or very influential.  I tend to go with the flow in a<br/>
   group, playing requests before proving a point.  As long as<br/>
   I&#39;m not almost dying every fight, and getting a decent share<br/>
   of exp, I don&#39;t really care what songs I have to play - as <br/>
   long as everyone is happy.<br/>
<br/>
   In tank heavy groups, I have a good mix up of songs to play.<br/>
   In caster heavy groups, I enjoy the break from constantly<br/>
   pressing two or three buttons. <br/>
<br/>
   After level 40, you tend to drop some old favorites.  I rarely<br/>
   use Hymm anymore (its more efficient to mana healers up), <br/>
   despite the fact that Rokenn claims extensive use of charm<br/>
   in Lguk, you wont see him charming any boks or dars or<br/>
   bloodthirsties to save people... hehe (sorry man).  Pixie strike<br/>
   is nice and I use it in dire emergencies to hold one or two<br/>
   enemies still, but to interrupt casting you have to devote <br/>
   yourself to one mob, which is a waste of your resources<br/>
   (unless there only is one mob, then it&#39;s prefect)  Lullaby<br/>
   after level 35, just gets you killed.  I mean think of trying<br/>
   to control a crowd of sonic bats and ldcs with Lullaby, and<br/>
   if you fail or they break out of sleep, KYAG.  Greater kobolds,<br/>
   yeah maybe you&#39;d do ok, but these bigger enemies hit hard, hit<br/>
   fast, and bash a whole lot.  Like imp protectors and lava<br/>
   guardians, I don&#39;t wanna be the dude up front taking those<br/>
   hits, hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
   Here is my song lineup (for the most part, it varies sometimes)<br/>
<br/>
   Mystic Shielding, Desperate Dirge, Berserker Crescendo, <br/>
   Manasong, Pixie Strike, Chains, Screech, Psalm of Cooling.<br/>
<br/>
   (I&#39;m definitely looking forward to the L48 song, it looks <br/>
    like a blast)<br/>
<br/>
   Anyway, at level 45, I&#39;m delighted to even find a spot in a group.<br/>
   Because the bar don&#39;t move any slowly than it does at level<br/>
   45.  Sure, I can solo the odd greater kobold, (fear + chains<br/>
   on the long ramp to SolA works beautifully), but there&#39;s <br/>
   nothing like 6 people killing things left and right, and<br/>
   playing about 6 hours to get one bubble of exp =).<br/>
<br/>
   Harmonic Distortion, 45th unchained melody.<br/>
   League of Antonican Bards, The Wind Spirit&#39;s Song<br/>
   &lt;Lords of Aesir&gt; Innoruuk</div>
