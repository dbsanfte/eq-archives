In the instance he described, there was no ench. If there is a better song<br/>
to play, tell us what it is.  Just because some other class has a better<br/>
damage shield, that is not a reason to just instantly dismiss bard&#39;s damage<br/>
shield songs. Also depending on the level of the bard -  there might not be<br/>
that many other better options.  You can be 31 and be in assn room or you<br/>
can be 44 - big difference in what your choices are. <br/>
<br/>
Point is, he gave us a specific situation, I answered with some points about<br/>
the specific songs.  Please share, but be specific about what songs a - say<br/>
33 - bard could use for that room - given the group he was in.<br/>

I&#39;ve always had a problem with our damage shields actually.  Unless you are<br/>
being attacked by multiple mobs, which with an enchanter doesn&#39;t happen too<br/>
often, the damage output of the shields is sub-par.  We have several other<br/>
options which produce more damage per 6 second pulse.  About the only time<br/>
we&#39;ve used the damage shields was in multi-bard groups.  There&#39;s almost<br/>
always a better song to play than a damage shield</div>
