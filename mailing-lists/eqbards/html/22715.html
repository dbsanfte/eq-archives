<div id="ygrps-yiv-846313224">I noticed that I&#39;m not getting the warnings about &quot;feeling like you are <br/>
about to fall&quot; (or something like that) when singing the Aria of Eagles. <br/>
This probably started a couple of patches back.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I really mind, since I know how many pulses can go by before I <br/>
have to renew it, but was a change, so I figured I&#39;d pass it along.<br/>
