&gt; Shield (PENDING LORE BTW) and a Combine LS and when I put the tiny daggers<br/>
&gt; in Range attack my Shield and Sword disappeared from my external camera view<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you take off and put on your shield, the shield should<br/>
override the dagger picture.  This bug also causes strange<br/>
things like people with a two-handed weapon (halberd)<br/>
appearing to wear a shield.<br/>

Another glitch I noticed, at least with the female wood elf<br/>
graphics, is when playing a brass song, the horn is rotated 90<br/>
degrees from where it should be.  It looks like I&#39;ve impaled<br/>
myself with the horn with the wide end coming out my back.<br/>
