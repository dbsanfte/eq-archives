<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475330927"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What Verant changed was limit the number of mobs that would<br/>
&gt; simultaneously attack you.  Only 4 mobs will attack you at<br/>
&gt; once.  Others that have aggroed on you will either not move<br/>
&gt; (thus staying out of range), or not attack (if they are<br/>
&gt; already in range), or if there&#39;s another target they&#39;ll attack<br/>
&gt; that instead.  As a result, it&#39;s more difficult to get more<br/>
&gt; than 4 mobs within range of a song at once if you&#39;re alone<br/>
&gt; (it&#39;s really easy if you&#39;re grouped or in a crowd of players).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s an interesting theory.  I&#39;ve noticed something to this<br/>
  effect when rounding up critters to kill.  As another post after<br/>
  yours mentioned, the mobs simply run away in the opposite direction<br/>
  for some reason.  This would explain that.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m still hanging out in PoF, but I can get my druid to round up<br/>
  five mobs of different name, and see if only four mobs attempt<br/>
  to attack me at any given time.<br/>
