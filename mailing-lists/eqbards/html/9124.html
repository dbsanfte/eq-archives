<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657931282">i&#39;m glad to see it&#39;s not just me having this exact problem...<br/>
<br/>
   yesterday alone i encountered two separate occasions when i could not <br/>
sing a song due to another song being what appeared to be &quot;locked&quot; into <br/>
verse. now the peculiar thing was that one of these times, i was in east <br/>
commons grouped with another bard, and some others. i decided since i was a <br/>
little higher than he was, to sing my hymn song instead to heal up the party <br/>
a wee faster. his song ended. i attempted to start my hymn. did not take... <br/>
at all. i tried maybe 20 times. grrr... this wasn&#39;t the first time it had <br/>
happened to me, so i didn&#39;t panic. i simply zoned. it seems to fix the <br/>
problem, but isn&#39;t necessarily something you want to do while either <br/>
fighting some mobs, or trying to heal your party while preparing for the <br/>
next battle.<br/>
   even while i was running towards the zone, i asked the other bard to sto <br/>
singing his song again. he did once more. i was maybe half the zone away <br/>
from him and still kept getting the message &quot;your wounds begin to heal.&quot; <br/>
hmmm... i left clicked on the icon to try removing the effects that way. <br/>
also no luck. well since i was at the zone, i went ahead and did the sure <br/>
fix.<br/>
   is this happening with any other bards? what could be the problem? maybe <br/>
an incidental bug included with the last patch. or is what Sylly was <br/>
discussing having to do with lag and spikes? i didn&#39;t experience any of that <br/>
if i recall correctly.<br/>

&gt;Yesterday, the lag was incredible.  Constant 15% to 35%, surges and spikes<br/>
&gt;into red with 50% to 80%.  Other players all complaing.  Some guys getting<br/>
&gt;dumped and coming back only to be nekkid and bind spot - never seeing a<br/>
&gt;fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, rather than venture into some hard dungeon, I was helping a group do<br/>
&gt;HG&#39;s off the wood bridge in North Karanas.  Staying back, buffing and mana<br/>
&gt;song.  So, then I decide ok, let&#39;s try Denons with horn and see how he <br/>
&gt;likes<br/>
&gt;it.  Great - he&#39;s wincing away nicely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then my friend Kaldivar comes by and asks about fenne&#39;s and charms.  So, I<br/>
&gt;say follow me I can show you a Grifxxxx spawn spot - do you know where the<br/>
&gt;named treeant is? (By now you should have a pretty good idea of what is<br/>
&gt;coming next.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the way there, I cant get selo&#39;s to lock and stay up.  I click, it trys,<br/>
&gt;then stops.  I start whining about lag and how weird this is a cant make my<br/>
&gt;songs play, etc. etc. Just as we get to that little tower, I look up and go<br/>
&gt;&quot;hmmm, wonder why the tree is moving around like that?&quot;  Followed shortly <br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt;&quot;you are burned&quot; and whoof 2 plus bubs of hp dissappear.  Btw: Kaldivar <br/>
&gt;says<br/>
&gt;&quot;oh I dunno, he is red to me&quot; Hehe - I start running away and frantically<br/>
&gt;yelling &quot;ZNE, ZNME, ZONE!!&quot;  You are burned. Another 2 bubs gone and a<br/>
&gt;glimpse of the goodie werewolf hunter chasing me as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now I am keying and clicking Selos very, very fast and desparately trying<br/>
&gt;for a zone.  Praise the Gods!  It finally stuck and I escaped to the <br/>
&gt;Western<br/>
&gt;Karana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, all I can think of is Denons was locked on - due to some lag bug? Selos<br/>
&gt;would not start and since there is no icon and were no other mobs being hit<br/>
&gt;- there was no screen message to see.  But seems even wierder than that.  I<br/>
&gt;scrolled back to see what spell he was casting and do not recall seeing &quot;a<br/>
&gt;Xannthoulos winces&quot; message.  Not that is some strong &quot;bard hate&quot; when <br/>
&gt;stuff<br/>
&gt;that likes you attacks you!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After a bit, the lag seemed to settle enough so I went and helped my group<br/>
&gt;kill spectres.  Even with 3 and 4 of them getting pulled, it seemed almost<br/>
&gt;too easy.  Of course we did have an enchanter handling the crowd control.<br/>
&gt;She could park them as necessary while we feared (although not the bard<br/>
&gt;fear) and killed the others.  Hehe, spectres are too easy.  Never thought I<br/>
&gt;would be saying that.<br/>
