<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] New patch message <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-754591762">a) I just hit reply from time to time without snipping the content of the<br/>
previous message. Sorry. It happens. I always post at the top of the message<br/>
so there&#39;s no need to read the entire thing. What I don&#39;t get is why would<br/>
you care? The message is less than 5 kb. I hope to god you&#39;re not stuck on a<br/>
2400 baud modem. If you have a halfway decent connection (33.6 or higher)<br/>
then you will notice ZERO difference in the time it takes you to download<br/>
the message. I hardly see the worth in bitching about it.<br/>
<br/>
b) The guy who writes the patch is not the guy that makes any of the changes<br/>
to the game. This is a pet peeve of mine, so I&#39;m gonna go off a bit.<br/>
Contrary to popular belief Verant Interactive has more than one employee.<br/>
Therefore, Abashi writing the patch message IN NO WAY lessens the time that<br/>
they have to program new features or to update database issues.<br/>
<br/>
c) I never said I didn&#39;t understand the message, rather I was annoyed at the<br/>
lack of professionalism on Verant&#39;s part. I also took minor offense to the<br/>
off handed nature with which they tend to regard bards. We got the vaguest<br/>
amount of info on our songs before they were released compared to rather<br/>
detailed descriptions for the regular spell casters. We get little to no<br/>
response when we bring up issues about our songs with tons of statiscal<br/>
data. We are fairly well tempered and don&#39;t go through the bitching and<br/>
whining when we get nerfed, because we understand for the most part that<br/>
some changes are necessary. (eg. the Solon&#39;s Bewitching Bravura nerf which<br/>
completely warranted) I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much to ask that Abashi look up<br/>
the name of our songs just like he looks up the names of the spells that he<br/>
talks about in his patch message.<br/>
<br/>
d) I wasn&#39;t whining, I merely brought up the fact that it annoyed me.<br/>
Whining would be if I posted it on a bunch of boards, wouldn&#39;t let the issue<br/>
die and complained to everyone I saw. I don&#39;t feel that it was off topic or<br/>
out of place for me to mention it on the bard mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
Please take your flames elsewhere.<br/>

Omg you ppl are starting to sound like the friggin necro community. Would <br/>
you like some cheese with that? I agree there are things that need to be <br/>
fixed that are more important than not writing out the entire name of a song<br/>
<br/>
(I think they need to fix the song/z-axis bug in Sebilis, personally). It&#39;s <br/>
a high level Brusco&#39;s song. How many of those are there? ONE. Deal with it. <br/>
Verant has already screwed the pooch on numerous class-related issues. If <br/>
abbreviating their patch messages (to the point where anyone with an inkling<br/>
<br/>
of sense could still easily reason them out) gives them more time to fix <br/>
what needs to be fixed, so be it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something real you can bitch about - why do people on lists have to <br/>
quote the entire friggin patch message in their posts after they find <br/>
something really stupid to complain about? Draelon?<br/>
