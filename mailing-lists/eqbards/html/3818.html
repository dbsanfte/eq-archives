<div id="ygrps-yiv-860064756"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Let me try to draw an analogy.  Baseball cards.  They&#39;re just<br/>
&gt;pieces of cardboard with ink printed on them.  But many many<br/>
&gt;people enjoy collecting them, enough so that they will pay<br/>
&gt;much more for a rare one than you and I probably make in a<br/>
&gt;year.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this makes it sensible?  I think not.  I have the same opinion of people<br/>
who pay thousands of dollars for a baseball card or a barbie doll or a<br/>
McDonalds happy meal toy or a beanie baby or any one of a million other<br/>
&quot;collectables&quot; as I do of people who pay hundreds of dollars for a few<br/>
virtual digits in a make believe world on a server that could go poof at any<br/>
time.  They have ALOT more money than they need and ALOT more money than<br/>
good sense.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(If you really want something to ponder, most real-life money<br/>
&gt;nowadays is nothing more than electronic bits on bank<br/>
&gt;computers.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Granted, but you know what?  It would take alot more than a simple single<br/>
computer crash to make that jar full of quarters and one dollar bills on my<br/>
nightstand (that serves as a tangible reminder that I&#39;m saving for a<br/>
vacation) absolutely worthless.  Whereas... if EQ has a nervous breakdown at<br/>
some point and all the bank accounts get wiped out... that idiot that paid<br/>
$600 or something for 1000 plat in game is out $600 with nothing to show for<br/>
it.... and EQ wouldnt reimburse him for it either, in game OR out.</div>
