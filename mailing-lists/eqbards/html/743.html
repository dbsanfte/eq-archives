<div id="ygrps-yiv-546580746">Ok, I retested this.  Slightly different results, and some<br/>
possible explanations.  Here&#39;s a recap of what I found last<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt; I just timed this last night.  With a combine longsword (delay<br/>
&gt; 28), I swing 5 times in roughly 14.0 seconds.  This is<br/>
&gt; consistent with my previous findings that the weapon delay is<br/>
&gt; just the recycle time in tenths of seconds (so 28 delay means<br/>
&gt; 2.8 seconds between swings).<br/>
<br/>
No change here.  No song, 28 seconds to swing 10 times.  (I<br/>
checked all of these with a stopwatch three times.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; With only the whistling warsong playing, it dropped to about<br/>
&gt; 12.5 seconds, or about 25 delay (so my combine longsword is<br/>
&gt; working like a well-balanced longsword :-).  Roughly a 10%<br/>
&gt; speedup (my bard is L15).<br/>
<br/>
This dropped to 23.7-23.9 sec for 10 swings, or about a 24<br/>
delay.  My singing skill was maxed when I tested it the first<br/>
time, so the only difference I can think of was that my bard<br/>
was about level 15.6 the second time, compared to 15.2 the<br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; With only the anthem playing, it<br/>
&gt; was about 12.5 seconds, maybe 13.0 seconds (my stopwatch<br/>
&gt; results for this one had about a half second of scatter).  So<br/>
&gt; again the speedup is about 10%, maybe a hair slower than the<br/>
&gt; warsong.<br/>
<br/>
No change here.<br/>
<br/>
1) Jonathan&#39;s Whistling Warsong definitely does speed up your<br/>
attacks.  Enough so that it&#39;s obvious to me just watching it,<br/>
even without a stopwatch.  The speedup seems to be dependent<br/>
on level, or both level and skill (or maybe it&#39;s charisma?<br/>
:-).<br/>
<br/>
2) I&#39;ve noticed with all my characters that they seem to have<br/>
an easier time fighting in the second half of a level than in<br/>
the first.  The difference in the above timings support this.<br/>
It&#39;s possible that some calculations are made based on the<br/>
your exact level (e.g. 15.4) instead of just the integer<br/>
portion.<br/>
