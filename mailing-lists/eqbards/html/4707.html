<div id="ygrps-yiv-814536011">When i got my steel plate, i made a gnome enchanter and poured all points to<br/>
charisma.  since a gnome was buying from gnomes, more charisma had no effect<br/>
on prices.   the breastplate was 768pp, and they rest were slightly less<br/>
than your list as well.<br/>

&gt; With more charisma, you should be able to get it for 787.5pp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my best price list again for small steel plate:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 787.5 Breastplate<br/>
&gt; 346.5 Boots<br/>
&gt; 252   Bracers<br/>
&gt; 420   Greaves<br/>
&gt; 294   Belt<br/>
&gt; 147   Collar<br/>
&gt; 483   Gloves<br/>
&gt; 336   Arms<br/>
&gt; 367.5 Pauldron<br/>
&gt; 367.5 Helm<br/>
&gt; 105   Mask<br/>
&gt; 399   Cloak<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The &quot;hidden&quot; base price is 5% below this (price/1.05).  The<br/>
&gt; best selling price is 5% below that. </span></blockquote></div>
