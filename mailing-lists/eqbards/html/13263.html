<br/>
Why do you want bind again?  The xp you gain back in 10 minutes after dying<br/>
is tiny, what is the point of bind of wanting bind?<br/>

&gt; I think you make some valid points, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t agree where<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bards are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; concerned.  Here&#39;s why:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Time is money.  Time is experience.  If I am bound 5 seconds away from my<br/>
&gt; &gt;current position, I can fight a lot more riskier and gain a lot more xp<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;if I am bound 10 minutes away.<br/>

&gt; This is only true if you don&#39;t die, as exp loss from a single death will<br/>

&gt; What Bind will get you, is letting you play for that 10 minutes, rather<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; minutes is a tiny, tiny fraction of what you lose by dying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me rephrase what you said:<br/>
You die, and lose 1/2 hour to an hours worth of time.<br/>
Binding &quot;close&quot; lets you play for 10 more minutes.<br/>
This 10 minutes is a tiny tiny fraction of what you lose.<br/>
10 minutes is 1/3 of a half hour.  33% is a tiny tiny fraction?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I said a bard should not attract attention if the group the bard is in<br/>
cannot protect the bard.  MOST groups I get in CAN adequately protect the<br/>
bard.  Some can&#39;t.  You have to adapt or you will not make it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Completely disagree.  There are definitely bard happy groups and bard happy<br/>
zones.  Work to your advantages.<br/>

The tanks can get the attention of the target mob, but all others<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s very true, in both cases.  We are a fine class, and I think not<br/>
