Why do you want bind again?  The xp you gain back in 10 minutes after dying<br/>
is tiny, what is the point of bind of wanting bind?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Time is money.  Time is experience.  If I am bound 5 seconds away from my<br/>
&gt; &gt;current position, I can fight a lot more riskier and gain a lot more xp<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me rephrase what you said:<br/>
You die, and lose 1/2 hour to an hours worth of time.<br/>
Binding &quot;close&quot; lets you play for 10 more minutes.<br/>
This 10 minutes is a tiny tiny fraction of what you lose.<br/>
10 minutes is 1/3 of a half hour.  33% is a tiny tiny fraction?<br/>

cannot protect the bard.  MOST groups I get in CAN adequately protect the<br/>
bard.  Some can&#39;t.  You have to adapt or you will not make it.<br/>
