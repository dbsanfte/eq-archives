 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I don&#39;t think I really responded to your email, so I guess this <br/>
wasn&#39;t the last I&#39;d say on the matter. If you mean exploit as in &quot;you kill <br/>
them, they have no chance of killing you&quot;, then I&#39;d have to say, &quot;Sorta&quot;. <br/>
The melee mobs have no chance to kill you, period. The casters can (and <br/>
have) kill you, but you do get some control over it. It&#39;s possible to DOT <br/>
them, run away from the jail and then come back and DOT them. However, it&#39;s <br/>
also possible that the wandering Caitliff or PH will come in and kill you <br/>
while you&#39;re trying this. Argh, I hate contemplating these things. I just <br/>
like to play the game.<br/>

are in their Line of Sight and within range.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t call this a total exploit. I mean, realistically, we can chant <br/>
things to death with selo&#39;s in the open plains and have practically no <br/>
chance of dying. Heck, I charm kite all the time and have only had a couple <br/>
of deaths the entire time (1 time because I went linkdead). I think that <br/>
this is pretty much the same thing. We can stay out of range and chant them <br/>
to death. The melee mobs, I would say that this is an exploit. But the <br/>
caster mobs I would say is more dangerous than just kiting out in the open.<br/>
