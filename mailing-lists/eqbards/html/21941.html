<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648461218">Very true. So they have 1 mob that is pissed off at them instead of 4-5 <br/>
other ones to beat on them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the taunt factor is so high after being mezzed like 30 times by your <br/>
friendly neighborhood bard, that they ignore the little newbie poking them <br/>
for like 5-6 pts and take swings at the big mean bard.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve run through zones seeing newbies fighting something that must have <br/>
been yellow to them (like bandits in West Karanas) and will sit and just <br/>
&quot;chain&quot; the creature for them. The taunt from chain alone keeps the mob on <br/>
me while they whack away wildly.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Of course those 30 mobs were the equivalent to that bard (at 40 something)<br/>
&gt; &gt;that moss snakes are to me.  Who cares if I can mez 1000 except for a fun<br/>
&gt; &gt;showoff trick.<br/>

&gt;Well it&#39;d be a hell of a way to twink all the newbies in blackburrow, neh?<br/>
&gt;Get 2 level 40 bards singing at the bridge of blackburrow and catch all the<br/>
&gt;trains and allow all the newbies to kill away. So yea, no benefit to the<br/>
&gt;bard, but it would be a way to mess up play balance in a dungeon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Though I totally understand. You would expect a level 30 bard should be<br/>
&gt;able to mesmerize level 1 mobs with 95% accuracy. It&#39;d just be sad to see<br/>
&gt;people abuse such power. Don&#39;t you hate always having to play to the lowest<br/>
&gt;common denominator? People have (and will continue) to crow about ways that<br/>
&gt;they broke the game. Hilarious though it may be.<br/>
