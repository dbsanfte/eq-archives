<div id="ygrps-yiv-330771448">LOL what i remember from beta during this was how HATED bards were (by<br/>
casters at least), and how often i got told to GET AWAY because our songs<br/>
were causing people to get interrupted while medding HAHAHA, it was funny.<br/>

&gt; For a short time in beta this was the case.  It was great <br/>
&gt; when I would come <br/>
&gt; upon a party in trouble I could buff/heal them with ease.  <br/>
&gt; Also people would <br/>
&gt; always be hitching a ride on the Selo Train as I would cross <br/>
&gt; the Karanas.  I <br/>
&gt; was saddened when they took this out.<br/>
