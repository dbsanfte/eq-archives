<div id="ygrps-yiv-553627481">This may sound unbelievable but I went thru 30 in 1 day in Highkeep.  I<br/>
played around 18hrs that day but I was always in a good group and I only<br/>
died only once and that was because there were only 10 people in the zone<br/>
and trains were horrible.  I stayed in Highkeep til I reached 34 then<br/>
ventured to Solb.  Now I am currently in Hell level 35.<br/>
