<div id="ygrps-yiv-166428048">I agree with Weiland 100 percent.  I was pretty taken aback by Randy Keith&#39;s<br/>
note (he don&#39;t post his Character name).    Nothing in my or Weiland&#39;s note<br/>
deserved the dressing-down in Keith&#39;s note.  People forget that there are<br/>
real people that sit behind these screens.<br/>
<br/>
I never said I had any problems with &quot;taking responsibility to get my corpse<br/>
back&quot;  I never came CLOSE to implying the &quot;GM&#39;s are worthless&quot;.  I never<br/>
complained about GM&#39;s not &quot;running to help me&quot;.  The tone of the note was<br/>
completely uncalled for - and this seems to be happening more and more on<br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly - while not bard related - I think I posted information<br/>
that is useful to other bards.  Especially the part about how I was able to<br/>
zone into Sol B to get out of that tricky spot.  What are Guides supposed to<br/>
do but Guide?  They can&#39;t fix bugs.  There is more use for them than simply<br/>
helping people who are victims of bugs.  I would hope there is more customer<br/>
service in this product that I am paying for.  The guides didn&#39;t even know<br/>
that you could get into that area and not get out the way you came.  (The<br/>
first guide at least.  I /petitioned simply to ask what to do - I never knew<br/>
anyone who died that way and wanted to simply know how to get it out.  He<br/>
said - get someone with levitate and drag your corpse out...)<br/>
<br/>
I NEVER asked a Guide (never got a true GM) to do anything but give me<br/>
advice.   Well eventually they said &quot;Find someone with group gate&quot;. Well I&#39;m<br/>
level 29 in a dungeon designed for my level.  Group Gate comes at that same<br/>
level I do believe.  Randy Keith is high enough level to go after a dragon -<br/>
so I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s mid 40&#39;s or higher.  At that level you take it for<br/>
granted that you know a lot of people who can group gate.  I know two.<br/>
Exactly two - no more.  Trying to schedule to be online at the same time as<br/>
then can be very difficult.  It was looking very possible that I WOULDN&#39;T<br/>
have been able to schedule that in the week before my corpse decayed.  I<br/>
would have lost all my equipment I accumulated in 29 levels.  Asking a<br/>
stranger to risk dying themselves on a such a corpse retrieval just &quot;isn&#39;t<br/>
gonna happen&quot;.  I feel sorry for the people that DON&#39;T know anyone who can<br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
People have been (IMHO rightfully) complaining that there seems to be<br/>
inconsistencies in the way bards are being treated in the game.  &quot;We have to<br/>
fix exploits with levitate - so lets make the spell not renewable while<br/>
running&quot;  OOPS - we forget to think about what that means for the bard song.<br/>
Oh you can&#39;t target your corpse in lava?  Let me  fetch it for you. - but if<br/>
you can - you are on your note.<br/>
<br/>
In closing - the nature of a forum based on written communication can be<br/>
difficult - because it&#39;s very easy to be lazy and read the first few<br/>
paragraphs and not bother to try get the tone of the writer.  It&#39;s easy to<br/>
decide the guy is full of sh*t and show the world how much more intelligent<br/>
than they you are with a quick flame.  You can point out how much harder you<br/>
had it when you had your body under a dragon and the wimpy 29th-level only<br/>
had lava to contend with.  He had no business even posting it to the<br/>
EQ-BARDS list!  He needs to be put in his place!<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m sick of seeing people write flames.  I often see  things I strongly<br/>
disagree with - but usually just let it go (however this time I can&#39;t let it<br/>
pass).<br/>

flaws.  What I have grown incredibly tired of however is the recurring<br/>
&gt; flames on this list.  Perhaps before you post your retort, you should<br/>
&gt; attempt to read between the lines on a post.  Instead of downing every<br/>
post<br/>
&gt; that you disagree with, take a position, state it and move on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re all glad to have the info that comes through this list from the<br/>
likes<br/>
&gt; of John, Shada, Harmonic and many others.  I look forward to reading this<br/>
&gt; list.  If people who don&#39;t have the experience that you do post something<br/>
&gt; that is inaccurate, correct it, don&#39;t laugh at it in public.<br/>
