<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923325194">Sorry, I&#39;m not trying to be offensive.  Its just that this topic really<br/>
steams me.  When you constantly tell people how important CR is and they<br/>
ignore you only to die a pathetic death to a dragon, with twice as many<br/>
people as it would take those of us properly geared to do it, it gets very<br/>
frustrating.<br/>
Let me give you an example.  Last week we went to kill Vox.  24 of us.  No<br/>
problem.  No deaths.  We then went on to PoH.  After about an hour there the<br/>
server crashed, and instead of spending the time breaking in again we<br/>
decided to go kill the freshly spawned Vox again.  24 of us.  No problem.  1<br/>
death.  This one death was a person who arrived late and didn&#39;t have time to<br/>
get CR buffs because we were already in her lair.  From here we were feeling<br/>
pretty confident.  Lets gate to Lavastorm and kill Nags.  It was getting<br/>
pretty late so nobody wanted to waste the time running to town to grab FR<br/>
gear.  (We hadn&#39;t planned on doing Nags, he only respawned when the server<br/>
went down).<br/>
24 people.  Little or no FR gear.  Barely killed him, more than half dead.<br/>
Normally Nagafen presents no more problems than Vox.<br/>
Sure, maybe you&#39;ll get a lucky roll every now and then on damage.  Please do<br/>
not make the mistake of thinking that this means that resists are useless.  <br/>
And if you think that equipping weapons and doing ~500 points of damage<br/>
makes a difference to a creature that has 25,000 hit points, think how much<br/>
more damage your party could have done if they&#39;d resisted just a little bit<br/>
more damage, and had just a few more attack rounds.<br/>

  Are we not friends anymore, dear Elwyn?<br/>
