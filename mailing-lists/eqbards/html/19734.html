<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678367261">Since when has Verant ever been worried about balancing classes in respect<br/>
to others? If they were then necros would get a serious nerf.  I would think<br/>
class specific items only need to be balanced for the class they are<br/>
designed for.    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>it can&#39;t just be justifiable based on time and effort, it must also be<br/>
balanced<br/>
with respect to other classes.  for example, you can&#39;t create a 2 damage<br/>
1 delay sword that is bard only usable, then say oh it&#39;s balanced because<br/>
it takes 1000 hours to get it.  the time/difficulty it takes to get it is<br/>
only part<br/>
of the equation.<br/>
