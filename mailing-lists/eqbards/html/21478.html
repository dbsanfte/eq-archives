<div id="ygrps-yiv-606685687">Well since we are the Jack of All Trades (Master of None) I just take it in <br/>
stride. Besides, there aren&#39;t all that many enchanters around, and when <br/>
there are, the enchanters are always happy to have me in the group with them.<br/>
<br/>
As always, it depends on the situation. Sometimes a bard might be better, <br/>
sometimes a specific class would be better. Besides, if you&#39;re grouped with <br/>
a bunch of jerks who boot you from a group, simply because they want one <br/>
class over another, I&#39;d be only too happy not to be with a them.<br/>

&gt;Also, as a cleric in my guild pointed out.. how is Mark of Karn so<br/>
&gt;imbalanceing when there are what like 7 copies of it on our server?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark<br/>
&gt; &gt; of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less<br/>
&gt; &gt; desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its<br/>
&gt; &gt; duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; value decreased. </span></blockquote></div>
