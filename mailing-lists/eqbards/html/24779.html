<b>Subject:</b> Mob that Wouldn&#39;t Mez <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-596514141">I was in The Courtyard Area of The Hole last night and twice we fought<br/>
Elemental Channelers would couldn&#39;t be mezzed.  Both a 52 Enchanter and<br/>
myself (54 Bard) couldn&#39;t get our Mez&#39;s to stick.<br/>
<br/>
Channelers can cast spells that group members have; and our Druid (a VERY<br/>
good player) insisted she didn&#39;t DOT him by mistake.  The Wizard in the<br/>
group is new to my guild and I haven&#39;t played with him very much - but there<br/>
was no evidence that he was a sloppy player and not a single instance all<br/>
not (otherwise) of mis-targetted mobs.<br/>
<br/>
I did notice that when I was finally able to get the Mez to stick - that<br/>
there was a significant amount of damage on the mob.<br/>
<br/>
The only conclusion I could make was that they DOT themselves.  Again -<br/>
Channelers can cast any spell that any player in the group has memmed - you<br/>
often see them CH...<br/>
