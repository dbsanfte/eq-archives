<div id="ygrps-yiv-767355276">I agree with you Sylly...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve about had it playing my shaman, I love her to death but the politics,<br/>
guild fights and extreme boredom are not worth the few hours of exciting fun<br/>
in Sebilis anymore.  The most fun lately I&#39;ve had is with my bard, killing<br/>
stuff in Lake of Ill Omen with pickup groups... I&#39;ve actually laughed for<br/>
the first time in ages when our untwinked puller (25th warrior in BRONZE)<br/>
pulled like 10 sarnaks, and as much as I yelled &quot;assist xxx&quot; everyone hit<br/>
their own sarnak, the enchanter messed himself, and we all ended up running<br/>
amok... some to the zone, some in crazy circles... <br/>
<br/>
It was insane, incompetant, dangerous, and the situation with Halana would<br/>
have made me crazy mad.. but with Tani, I had the most fun and laughed so<br/>
hard pepsi shot out my nose.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heh - ya, I know.  I have reached that stage in EQ where you get kinda<br/>
&gt; &quot;bitter&quot; about some things.  I dont think I have it as bad as <br/>
&gt; some others I<br/>
&gt; know - and I still keep playing.  But....(and these are my <br/>
&gt; feelings - imho,<br/>
&gt; ymmv, yadda yadda)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. There is a strong &quot;Us vs Them&quot; atmosphere in EQ. Us being <br/>
&gt; Verant and the<br/>
&gt; &quot;Vision(tm)&quot; and the &quot;You have been summoned by the Gods (who <br/>
&gt; in r/l maybe a<br/>
&gt; some volunteer with little or no customer service <br/>
&gt; exp/training and a short<br/>
&gt; fuse)&quot; and the Them being the players (who are probably <br/>
&gt; lying, cheating,<br/>
&gt; coniving, theiving baistiages or else why would they be <br/>
&gt; asking for a res /<br/>
&gt; item that got lost doing a quest / help finding a corpse / <br/>
&gt; return of items<br/>
&gt; from rotted corpse when printed user manual has incorrect <br/>
&gt; times for corpse<br/>
&gt; decay / etc etc.).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. Advancement in the game is based on &quot;time served&quot; 10 times <br/>
&gt; more than<br/>
&gt; &quot;skilled play.&quot;  And this makes 80 to 90 percent of the game <br/>
&gt; very boring.<br/>
&gt; Only new places offer some relief and granted the design of <br/>
&gt; them has gotten<br/>
&gt; better - still after doing Seb Crypt 10 times - it gets <br/>
&gt; boring.  Camping for<br/>
&gt; exp is flat out boring.  How many hows killing aviaks / pickclaws /<br/>
&gt; froogluks / kobolds / guards / etc. etc. can you stand?  This <br/>
&gt; may be due to<br/>
&gt; fighting &quot;npc&#39;s&quot; rather than live ppl where each fight is <br/>
&gt; dynamic. So, the<br/>
&gt; basis of the game maybe just boring because any AI in the NPC&#39;s is so<br/>
&gt; limited - and repetitive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. The &quot;content&quot; based events/quests/lore & history has been <br/>
&gt; skimpy at best.<br/>
&gt; Granted, it&#39;s very difficult to provide RolePlay Lore when <br/>
&gt; there are so many<br/>
&gt; Duuuudz who wanna kill it and loot it.  But where is the incentive for<br/>
&gt; players to do otherwise? Where are the tools to facilitate GM <br/>
&gt; events? And<br/>
&gt; they may not have the resources to make dynamic events <br/>
&gt; actually work - ie<br/>
&gt; why bother if there is no money in it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, any how - I had a great year in the game.  The part i <br/>
&gt; love the best is<br/>
&gt; the other players.  I know there are a couple others who play <br/>
&gt; the game to<br/>
&gt; &quot;live in the world&quot; (Silky? Peace? Sylly? oh that&#39;s me!) and <br/>
&gt; there is fun<br/>
&gt; stuff there.  I have had as much fun taking &quot;newbies&quot; in <br/>
&gt; Rivervale to the<br/>
&gt; Sheriff, levitating and running to the rocks so we can climb <br/>
&gt; to the top of<br/>
&gt; the mountains - as I have had doing dragons and planes.  <br/>
&gt; Maybe more fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, for the younger bards reading this, take your time and <br/>
&gt; play the way you<br/>
&gt; like.  There is a lot of fun out there.  Only when you join <br/>
&gt; the quest for<br/>
&gt; exp race and leet loots, remember to smell the roses too.  <br/>
&gt; All you have to<br/>
&gt; do to get to level 50 is kill 1,210,314 moss snakes, skellies, aviaks,<br/>
&gt; pickclaws, froogs, kobolds, specs, etc, etc, etc.  It&#39;s a <br/>
&gt; long haul but<br/>
&gt; eventually you get there.<br/>
