<div id="ygrps-yiv-187719459">Congrats Slyde!  No worries on the Lute, It would have been a stretch <br/>
to get there.  Although, with the 30 minute timer, I may have had <br/>
time to log in a twink, buy a stone, log in my friends wizard, pick <br/>
up the stone and then TP myself up to Hate in time... let me stress <br/>
MAY have had time, hehe... My other 2 Wizzie friends apologized <br/>
profusely but were either killing Goranaire or raiding Skyshrine. <br/>
Like that&#39;s more important??  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I still wish a BP dropped for me... er, I mean 2 BP&#39;s, one for you <br/>
and one for me. :)  (inside joke)<br/>
<br/>
Darkfox<br/>
<br/>
p.s. remind me to park a few Hate stones on my friend&#39;s wizzie. :)<br/>

They go to loot him ┬û sadly for the Warrior ┬û no Hand; but he had 2 <br/>
count em 2 Seven String Lutes!  I was the only bard on the Raid.  I <br/>
gave Darkfox a tell ┬û and there was some talk between us of trying to <br/>
get him before it rotted but stupid me ┬û in all the zone spam I <br/>
missed some Mage asking if she could loot the lute for <br/>
her &quot;collection&quot;.  Not clear whether Darkfox could have gotten up in <br/>
time though.</div>
