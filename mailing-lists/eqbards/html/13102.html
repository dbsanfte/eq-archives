<div id="ygrps-yiv-24011978">Thanks for the tips - you have the experience of many raids and its good to<br/>
hear what&#39;s been tested vs someone&#39;s theorys.  I am still a baby bard -<br/>
still learning stuff every time - most recently I have learned that my power<br/>
of estimating is way off!! &quot;Do not under-estimate the might of Mayong<br/>
Mistmoore!&quot; But that is another story.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I learned a lot about Lady Vox!  A combined effort of some really<br/>
good guilds produced a victory - Lady Vox was slain on Innoruuk!  I was<br/>
lucky enough to be in the crew that cleared the way to the lair.  I saw some<br/>
really skilled pullers and some really great giant killers in action.  It<br/>
took 90 minutes to clear everything (ice giants, ice giant magis, giant<br/>
woolly spiders, ice giant diplomats, icy terrors, & a priest of Nagafen)  to<br/>
the dragon.  Then it took over an hour for everyone to reform in to dragon<br/>
attack groups and buff.  And finally, about 3 minutes to slay the great<br/>
dragon.  A fabulous effort and some excellent guild cooperation made it<br/>
possible. <br/>

For me, my first dragon victory.  I was not killed, I resisted fear, endured<br/>
the cold but did go LinkDead in chaos of the final battle of which I saw<br/>
about half.  <br/>

In my experience, MR isn&#39;t nearly as important as FR/CR.  With 2 Rhythm<br/>
spells + Resist Magic, most classes are already at 140-150 MR, at which<br/>
point I feel to sacrafice more for MR is at a point of diminishing<br/>
return.  Yes, you&#39;ll get feared about 1 in 3, but getting feared once or<br/>
twice a dragon doesn&#39;t really affect the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Your FR and CR however, is what will negate the area effect damage spells<br/>
from the dragon.  As a class that cannot bind, you&#39;re only a contributing<br/>
factor as long as you stay alive.  Your resist songs is what will keep<br/>
you and your tanks long enough for the clerics to heal.<br/>
<br/>
Resist equipment that I always wear:<br/>
<br/>
Crown of Froglok Kings	(+20 CR/FR)<br/>
Symbols of Loyalty to Vox  (+14 CR)<br/>
Lambent Sleeves and Greaves  (+4 CR/FR/MR)<br/>
Guise of the Deceiver (+7 MR)<br/>
Dragoon&#39;s Dirk (+2 MR)<br/>
<br/>
Resist equipment I carry around for dragons:<br/>
<br/>
Earrings of Fire Reflection (+10 FR)<br/>
Plat Peridot Rings (+20 CR)<br/>
Plat Emerald Rings (+20 FR)<br/>
Gold Emerald Bracers (+14 FR)<br/>
Cloak of the Icebear (+20 CR)<br/>
<br/>
The hard to get equipment (crown and symbols) are good items in and of<br/>
themselves.  The resist equipment I switch in are either Jewelcrafter<br/>
made, bought from Gypsies, or in 1 case, easily purchasable off people<br/>
camping themselves a GZ.  And really if you prefer lambent bracers to<br/>
Symbols (I prefer them because I like the band of silver on my wrists),<br/>
you can always substitute in Gold Peridot Bracers to save yourselves the<br/>
camp.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a few more things I can switch around, such as icy greaves and<br/>
such, but my resists are high enough to easily dispatch a dragon.  None of<br/>
this stuff is planar, and almost anyone has access to them.  The only<br/>
other thing you really need is a mm battledrum.<br/>
