Depends how you play.  Personally, I don&#39;t rely on my ability<br/>
to kill a mob to keep me alive.  I always have at least one of<br/>
Lullaby, Screech, or Accelerando memorized in case I have to<br/>
bail from a fight.  I have died many many more times from<br/>
having bad situations dumped on me (trains, unexpected spawns,<br/>
etc), than from getting into fights that turned bad.<br/>

&gt; Missing 5 straight times with a delay 45 weapon is equivalent to 10 plus<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OTOH, say you have a high blue that you predictably cannot<br/>
defeat using fast weapons.  If you switch to slower ones, you<br/>
increase your chance of beating it.  If you start to lose, you<br/>
can always hit Accelerando (or Screech underground) and zone.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I meant about it on average making no difference.<br/>
Any &quot;benefit&quot; you can think of for faster weapons because the<br/>
chance-of-less-damage end of the bell curve is smaller, is<br/>
matched by a equal &quot;drawback&quot; because the chance-of-more-dam<br/>
end of the bell curve is likewise smaller.  Factor in that the<br/>
system rewards more experience for riskier fights and the<br/>
decision to side with the easy and predictable fights is not<br/>
so clear.<br/>
