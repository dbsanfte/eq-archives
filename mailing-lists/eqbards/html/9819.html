<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810813389">You realize of course what will happen now that it&#39;s been brought to his attention.  After the<br/>
next patch or so, they&#39;ll mysteriously get that &quot;2nd resist&quot; even after they&#39;re already<br/>
successfully pixied.  Sounds cynical.  But just you wait.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been using Lullaby a lot recently to take down multiple blues while<br/>
&gt; &gt; soloing.  From what I have observed, it seems to work similarly to our other<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs.  When the effect goes off the mobs get a chance to resist.  If they<br/>
&gt; &gt; fail to resist they nod.  When they would next get to attack they get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; chance to break the nod, if they do they attack.  Just as with some other<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs this results in the effect getting broken before it ever costs the MOB<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So why do mobs that are 30 levels lower than me seem to<br/>
&gt; &quot;succeed&quot; at this &quot;second resist&quot; about 60%-80% of the time?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I forget offhand what the other songs are that function this way, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; remember John lamenting on the fact that the song could work and be broken<br/>
&gt; &gt; before it really had any effect.  I have seen it to always interrupt a<br/>
&gt; &gt; caster if they nod though in my experience, but then again I haven&#39;t been to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Temple of Cazic Thule. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know something similar happens with root.  However, if mobs<br/>
&gt; were breaking root at anywhere near the frequency they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &quot;breaking out&quot; of Lullaby and Pixie Strike, the casters would<br/>
&gt; string GZ up by the... ahem.  Anyhow, the fact that Pixie<br/>
&gt; Strike works much better if you successfully get one to stick<br/>
&gt; leads me to believe this is a bona fide bug, and not a high<br/>
&gt; &quot;second resist&quot; effect.  If it were just a &quot;second resist&quot;<br/>
&gt; effect, then it shouldn&#39;t matter whether or not you&#39;ve gotten<br/>
&gt; one Pixie Strike to stick.<br/>
