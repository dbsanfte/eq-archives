<div id="ygrps-yiv-457958063">I have not played for a few patches so I dont really know that he is missing<br/>
but you do know he goes for a walk and even if nobody is hunting there he<br/>
isnt allways at his spawn point.  You can get your CS from that drake<br/>
without a faction hit if you can cast DoT spell, beat it down close dot it<br/>
then before he dies you zone and then come back and loot your key.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you find Wenglaks you dont have to give him the PP to him to finish<br/>
the quest just hand him the note, if you are KoS wait till he goes for his<br/>
walk, but dont let him get too far he goes up towards the harder giants near<br/>
the arena. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck hope he isnt MIA just taking a break.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Dragon Tooth Choker broken/missing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For some time now, I think the patch before these two latest one, Wenglaks<br/>
(sp?) from Kael Drakkal has been missing. I know he is a part of 2 quests at<br/>
least. I think one is for receiving the Shrine key into Cobalt Scar, and the<br/>
other I believe is for the Dragon Tooth Choker. Now I want one of these (had<br/>
to take a faction hit for killing the stupid drake there). Sentry Kale gives<br/>
you a note to give to Weng, who&#39;s MIA. Giving what he gives you back must be<br/>
returned to Kale, or spawns the spy in Skyshrine in a spot at the base of<br/>
the steps that lead up to the higher levels of the shrine. What drops from<br/>
the spy is returned to Kale for the Choker, if memory serves me correctly.<br/>
OK, the question is, where in the heck is wenglaks, why has he been missing<br/>
for several patches. People can&#39;t get their shrine key without taking a<br/>
faction hit, nor can this quest be completed. Has anyone heard what&#39;s going<br/>
on, or have they moved Weng to another portion of Kael, harder to get to? As<br/>
it was the guy was relatively close to the zone, although I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
the other guys in the room would pounce on you or not. /sigh<br/>
<br/>
It could be like the NoS when they moved the loot table to Howling stones<br/>
from Dalnir. They may have just made it a dropped item rather than<br/>
quested....<br/>
