<div id="ygrps-yiv-118918711">Level 51 songs...song of travel is nice until you kill your friends with it<br/>
hehe (i haven&#39;t yet, but i did get scared when i broke through the clouds<br/>
and was 2000 feet above Karnor&#39;s), and i do use the new largo&#39;s over chains<br/>
since it does not get resisted as much as i expected.<br/>
<br/>
Level 52 song... worthless.  it drops when you get hit due to the absorb<br/>
damage aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Level 53 songs...worthelss.  Song of Dawn seems to do nothing, Song of<br/>
Twilight is an upgrade to pixie&#39;s and therefore works just as poorly.  I had<br/>
huge hopes for this one, eqcasters listed it as a stun, not a mes.<br/>
<br/>
Level 54 song...worthless.  45% haste means nothing when any haste item+any<br/>
haste spell/song gives you max haste.  even anthem is better than this.  was<br/>
hoping that since the haste cap was raised above 75% (i think it can get as<br/>
high as 100% now and is based on level and class, ranger i was fighting with<br/>
was at 90% at level 53) it would mean something.<br/>
<br/>
Level 55 song...nice, but reaffirms us as mana pumps, and i&#39;m gonna hate<br/>
having to switch to lute between every fight to get the max potential from<br/>
this (ok so i am lazy, my fingers hurt after weaving songs for 12 hours in<br/>
upper bugs for 1.5 bubbles).<br/>
<br/>
Level 56 songs...both geared for running away from bad situations, dunno how<br/>
useful they will be.<br/>
<br/>
Level 57 song...worhtless, when was the last time you used denon&#39;s<br/>
dissension?<br/>
<br/>
Level 58 songs...one nice there is nothing wrong with an AC increase, can<br/>
weave it with Vov, the other is the same useless piece of crap the level 45<br/>
song is.<br/>
<br/>
Level 59 song...is this a joke?  yes the real reason i have for getting to<br/>
level 50 is so i can charisma buff my entire party! woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
Level 60 songs...both look awesome at first glance, hopefully make it worth<br/>
the frustration of getting to 60.<br/>
<br/>
Level 39 song...soon worthless as we start fighting mobs above level 49, but<br/>
i use the hell out of it now.<br/>
<br/>
btw Parry caps at 75.  guess we can assume riposte does also, i was hoping<br/>
more along 125 but better than nothing i guess, though doesn&#39;t seem to work<br/>
much at that cap.<br/>
<br/>
ok these thoughts just came from conversations with the level 54 bard in my<br/>
guild.  i am trying not to get depressed.  someone cheer me up, please!<br/>
