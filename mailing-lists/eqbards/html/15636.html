<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220449582">I agree.  Very few people would quit if the fee per month was raised from<br/>
9.95 to 11.95 if they knew the difference would go to hiring GM&#39;s from the<br/>
professional ranks who would could be fair and consistent and were given<br/>
real power to adjudicate and the backup and training to use it.<br/>

&gt; The problem with enforcement of game laws by actual humans is<br/>
several-fold,<br/>
&gt; to start, nobody (currently defined as OSI and Verant and I am sure this<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; true for AC as well ) can afford to have their support staffed by mature,<br/>
&gt; responsible people trained in conflict mediation and resolution, because<br/>
&gt; said folks (with or without the training) largely need to earn a living<br/>
&gt; wage. So they end up hiring people who think the job is cool enough to<br/>
&gt; accept a low salary. And while I am sure the two populations (mature,<br/>
&gt; responsible/accepts cool over money) have some intersect, I don&#39;t believe<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; is going to be a huge pool to draw from.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the predominant way of thinking right now, and<br/>
I think it&#39;s going to change in the next decade.<br/>
<br/>
For years, software piracy and hacking weren&#39;t taken seriously<br/>
by law enforcement.  Now that computers have become so<br/>
prevalent, they&#39;re coming to be regarded as real crimes within<br/>
the judicial system.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the idea of credit cards was laughable 30 years ago.  <br/>
Paying without transferring some physical representation of<br/>
money (be it legal tender or an IOU)?  Preposterous.  Yet,<br/>
it&#39;s widely accepted now, and stores who don&#39;t support it are<br/>
at a *dis*advantage.<br/>
<br/>
I make a ton of money producing no physical product.  <br/>
Everything I create is virtual - intangible electronic 1s and<br/>
0s.  In payment for this, a computer at the company&#39;s bank<br/>
talks to a computer at my bank every month and says to add X<br/>
amount to a variable that represents my bank account.<br/>
<br/>
Is it really that outlandish to think that it&#39;s possible that<br/>
people will be paid livable salaries for staffing a virtual<br/>
world?<br/>
