<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141673422">heh, the bard&#39;s flexibility only increases up to about level 52.  once you start fighting<br/>
52+ mobs, you lose the ability to crowd control with charm.  so you made it all the <br/>
way to 31 and make sweeping generalizations about the flexibility and effectiveness<br/>
of a bard?<br/>

&gt;aspect.  But hey!  my druid can hold a mandolin as well as anybody!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ummm, by this standard you would never be getting into groups since you don&#39;t<br/>
have manasong.  but taking a step back and looking at all the classes, outside<br/>
of clerics and enchanters, what class has an &#39;&#39;in&#39;&#39; to get into a group over all other<br/>
classes?  none.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Seriously though.  I played a bard because of the tactical flexibility.<br/>
&gt;There was actually a choice of which songs to use in which circumstances and<br/>

&gt;better to Anthem, and when Psalm?  Those days have gone by as each and every<br/>

anthem, and psalm, as well as hymn, charm, fear, etc all work just fine.  i&#39;ve<br/>
never had the problems with pixie that other bards complain about.  i was a<br/>
mezzing machine in solb on beetles and ldc&#39;s at level 50ish.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>you never chain unless alone?  maybe you just don&#39;t understand the flexibility<br/>
of a bard then.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;help some newbie, and even then it&#39;s pretty pathetic.  I&#39;ve given up trying<br/>
&gt;to Pixie anything, better to just charm it and be &#39;protected&#39; when the spell<br/>
&gt;goes off.  Verant has successfully taken 90% of the things I loved about<br/>
&gt;bards and killed them.  All because of some &#39;balance&#39; issue that never<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>90%? heh, nice exaggeration.  i suppose if the ONLY things you liked about<br/>
a bard was snaring and crowd control this might be true.  i personally like a lot<br/>
more things about my bard.  just as a side note, what is your cha and do you<br/>
use a wind instrument when using pixie?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;existed.  If bards were so powerful, how come we&#39;ve always been among the<br/>
&gt;rarest classes in a game that&#39;s all about power???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>because our power is nicely masked.  you have to be a good player and understand<br/>
a lot about our songs and the way the game works and other classes before you can<br/>
be that superpowerful bard.  most people either don&#39;t stick with it long enough or don&#39;t<br/>
have enough knowledge to really master the bard class.<br/>
