<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589764014">Oh, that makes me feel stupid.  I didn&#39;t want to compile a single list by looking at all the individual<br/>
ones, and had never noticed the &quot;Click here to get a printable item drop list&quot; link.  Duh.  And thanks.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Mask of the Songbird<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only web sites I can find that list the components for the Plane of<br/>
&gt; Sky Mask of the Songbird Quest show:  Ocher Tessara, Songbird Statuette,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Light Woolen MANTLE.  Now, the Light Woolen Mantle is also used in the<br/>
&gt; Songweaver&#39;s Mantle quest, and I have seen some posts that suggest that<br/>
&gt; this is a typo, and that what is required is a Light Woolen MASK.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have any of you completed this quest, and if so, what object is needed?<br/>
&gt; And do you remember which MOB(s) dropped it?  I heard it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; Shimmering Meteors, which my guild never does because of their really<br/>
&gt; annoying knockback effect.  I hate to ask my guild to try killing them<br/>
&gt; if it&#39;s pointless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far, we&#39;ve never seen a Light Woolen anything.<br/>

&gt; PS - Does anyone have a link to anyplace that lists all of the Sky<br/>
&gt; components and the quests they&#39;re for?<br/>
