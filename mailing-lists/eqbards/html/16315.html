 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really besides my point though, that sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
more efficient to kill a given mob more slowly and tank it a<br/>
bit longer (letting DoTs do their work), due to the reduced<br/>
downtime to recoup mana.  If your group is killing stuff in<br/>
&lt;30 seconds and increasing the fight times doesn&#39;t help, then<br/>
it&#39;s very likely you&#39;re killing low blues.  The solution then<br/>
is to move to high blues, not all the way to reds as you<br/>
suggest.<br/>
