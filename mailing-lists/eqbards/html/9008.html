&gt; When all the details about the bard armor quests came out, I was initially<br/>
&gt; disappointed that I would not be able to do the quests due to my level (25<br/>
&gt; bard).  I just assumed that I would have to wait until I was around 30th<br/>
&gt; level before starting.  I guess I have been lucky so far because I have<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; able to acquire six of the items.  For a few of them, guildmembers in<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; mid 30s helped me out.  For the others, people couldn&#39;t use/loot them them<br/>
&gt; so they let me loot the items.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Always willing to take a risk, I&#39;m thinking about heading to Mistmoore<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; I get the bracelet in Unrest.  Need to get an idea of how tough the deadly<br/>
&gt; usher and gypsy musicians are.  I hope to join with a higher level group<br/>
&gt; (assuming they will accept a 25 bard in the group).  Assuming a full group<br/>
&gt; of six, what level characters are required to fight against these mobs?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, the only places I&#39;ve gone to in Mistmoore are the initial areas<br/>
&gt; beside<br/>
&gt; the lake and the graveyard.  Nothing I ran into in those locations could<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; through the invisibility song.   Are there any mobs deeper in the zone<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; can See Invis?  I would assume that the DE casters can buff themselves<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; the spell.  Got a bad feeling that all the gargoyles can as well.  Still<br/>
&gt; willing to take the chance though.<br/>
