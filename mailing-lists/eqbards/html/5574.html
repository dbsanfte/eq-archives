<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630097974">Yes it works.  I sent in a bug report on this way back in beta p4 as a <br/>
possible exploit.  I guess Verant is ok with self-consenting.<br/>

&gt; &gt; your main character at further risk.  Simply create a level 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; character, login with the main character and /consent to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 1 character, then login with the level 1 character and<br/>
&gt; &gt; go looking for the corpse.  (This assumes of course that the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve long wondered if you could give consent to a player<br/>
&gt;that is not online.. Have you personally done this to<br/>
&gt;verify that it works? Seems to me that Verant would look<br/>
&gt;at this as some kind of exploit. Although personally I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;glad if it works as there are times that through no fault<br/>
&gt;of your own, you&#39;re in a spot that your character will never<br/>
&gt;get it&#39;s corpse from. </span></blockquote></div>
