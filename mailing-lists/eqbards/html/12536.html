<div id="ygrps-yiv-169464971">Today I tested bardspeed vs. SoC. I am a 36th Bard with MM drums, vs. a<br/>
35th Druid with SoC.<br/>
<br/>
When we started the test, the druid shot out ahead of me, since I<br/>
started my song when she cast her spell, and SoC casts VERY fast (0.1<br/>
delay?). But then Selo&#39;s kicked in and I held the race close, in fact I<br/>
Believe I was gaining on her, if only slightly. So I&#39;d say IMHO that<br/>
35th level Selo&#39;s with MM is probably AS fast as SoC, and 36th is<br/>
slightly faster (it does increase every level right?)<br/>
<br/>
When is Selo&#39;s as fast as SoW?<br/>

p.s. Died twice today, lost 3/4 bubble both times. I was a little more<br/>
than one and a half bubbles into 36th, and wound up being BARELY into<br/>
36th, but no way could I have lost 2 bubbles, since that would have put<br/>
me in 35th again.</div>
