&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is from a monk friend of mine. It seems at higher level, the<br/>
&gt;actually number doesn&#39;t really matter as much. The stats however do.<br/>
&gt;Agility and Dex become more and more important in melee it seems.<br/>
&gt;Nowadays, the mobs I fight bash me really hard whether I wear the best<br/>
&gt;possible AC giving armor or not. It seems that our AC does not rise at<br/>
&gt;the same speed as the ATK of the mobs we fight. I depend so much on a<br/>
&gt;healer in our group, otherwise I&#39;m stuck with fighting really low blues<br/>
&gt;with one or two other melee classes. This makes sense since as you rise<br/>
&gt;in level, your defense points adds more to your total AC than the armor<br/>
&gt;you are wearing. At lower levels, you hardly had any defense points so<br/>
&gt;the AC of the armor played a large role in your overall AC. This<br/>
&gt;changes in the higher levels because you gather so many defense points<br/>
&gt;that they make up most of your AC and not the armor you wear. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am going to have to disagree on this one, i think ac is now more<br/>
important for me than the stats. Before i got an almost full suit of<br/>
imbrued my ac was not that high because i always chose stats over ac. Last<br/>
night i got almost 60 ac points added to my totat from the armour and i<br/>
could actually tell a difference. This was after 5 hours of killing kobolds<br/>
and i could easily tell that the ac was working. I was floored, normally i<br/>
cant tell a difference from stats, but the ac improvement was obvious. And<br/>
i got insane stats now, especially dex which is at 175, and way over 200<br/>
after buffs and songs. I know agil is important for ac but i can get that<br/>
over 190 with buffs and it didnt make near as much difference to me as that<br/>
50 ac. Course i was hardly scientific about it, but after 5 hours of<br/>
playing you get a pretty good fealing of the differences. <br/>

&gt;GROUPING<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As you level higher and higher, the level gap becomes wider and wider.<br/>
&gt;I group regularly up to 5 levels above me and I still get decent exp.<br/>
&gt;At lower levels, anything more than 2 levels is unheard of but it<br/>
&gt;becomes more and more common and the exp isn&#39;t bad. Maybe someone can<br/>
&gt;actually drop official numbers but from personal experience it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;bad at all. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I dont care about the levels of people i grouped with, i still always got<br/>
xp. I just want a group :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok some favors to ask now. Can I please see a screenshot of the bard<br/>
&gt;armor? I want to see how cool I will look in the future hopefully if<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m lucky. Unfortunately, I&#39;m a fashion addict (and I&#39;m human too hence<br/>
&gt;my armor is mostly lacking in the fashion department) and I would<br/>
&gt;really like to see the bard only armor looks. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well i put up a set of bmps of what i look like at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jrh.net/eq/imbrued.zip,">http://www.jrh.net/eq/imbrued.zip,</a> which also has stats on everything but<br/>
the bracers,arms, and gloves. I dont have the gloves and arms yet. I am a<br/>
human also, the wood elves seem to look much cooler imo. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I know the Mistmoore Battle Drum is great and the Princess Lute doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;seem to be anything but a quest item. What about Brahm&#39;s horn? Is it<br/>
&gt;brass or is it a wind instrument (like the mino horn)?<br/>
