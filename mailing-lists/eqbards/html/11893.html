&gt; Any truth to this?  If so, what is done?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Most suggestions I have ever given in Plane raids were dismissed<br/>
  as &#39;nah, that wont work&#39; or &#39;people are gonna die, just face it&#39;<br/>
  I don&#39;t buy that at all.<br/>
<br/>
  On Innoruuk, they force the bards to stop playing any songs unless<br/>
  necessary during pulls.  They also do not let bards in the melee,<br/>
  rather they hang back with the casters.  Could be that it&#39;s over-<br/>
  protecting an asset, or could be that they don&#39;t realize a bard&#39;s<br/>
  full potential.  If you don&#39;t listen or think you have a better<br/>
  idea, you are blacklisted.  EQ Politics, yuk!<br/>
<br/>
  My first idea for PoF was... send me in full buffs, full everything.<br/>
  Reso, Rune IV, Camo, Invis Animals, Invis Undead, Invis, +AGI, +DEX<br/>
  +STR, +STA, Talisman, Guard, buffs buffs buffs buffs.....  Nekkid<br/>
  me, with a normal drum, and selo&#39;s memmed, and I haul ass.  Hit the<br/>
  ground running, and collect all the mobs and train them away from <br/>
  the portal, away from the SE corner, into the middle of nowhere then<br/>
  curl up and die.  Immediately following that let everyone zone in<br/>
  however they wanted to.  (I&#39;ll leave breaking the plane discussion<br/>
  out)  Since I wasn&#39;t L50, that idea was dismissed as bullshit.  To<br/>
  this day, I think that sacrifice would still work.  The main problem<br/>
  you have upon zoning is a shiverback or scarling sitting there <br/>
  pounding the crap out of you, and then your client gives you control.<br/>
  By that time you are dead.  Loading, please wait... to another Loading,<br/>
  please wait.  If a bard could clear that garbage, and avoid a DT<br/>
  from Cazic, I think the portal trash would stay clear long enough<br/>
  for players to zone in.  This is purely hypothetical as no one <br/>
  wanted to listen to little me.  8)   As for pulling, I wish. hehe.<br/>
