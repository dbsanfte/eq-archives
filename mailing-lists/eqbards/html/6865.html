<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428172896">This is rumored to be the case.  I am in the exact same position you  <br/>
     are.  I am currently wearing a mix of bronze and magical armor. (btw,  <br/>
     where do you get barbed leggings?)  I &#39;think&#39; I noticed a lessening in  <br/>
     the amount of damage I received when I switched to bronze armor from  <br/>
     banded.  When I switched the bronze shldr and arms for the ba and bsm  <br/>
     I &#39;think&#39; I also noticed an increase in damage amounts.  This is all  <br/>
     very empirical data.  Does anyone know for sure?<br/>

&gt; Wasn&#39;t it on this list where someone said they definately knew that<br/>
&gt; different armor types provided different protection, independent of the  <br/>
&gt; AC value? I remember someone saying a Programmer GM had grabbed him or a  <br/>
&gt; friend in beta and equipped him in various armor to test this.<br/>
      <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I need some clarification on this one!<br/>
      <br/>
I&#39;ve got a bunch of bronze armor stacked up in the bank that I haven&#39;t been  <br/>
wearing because the items that it replaces have magical bonuses (barbed  <br/>
leggings and barbed arms for a +2 to DEX and to AGI), Bloodstained Mantle,  <br/>
etc.  The weight increase vs. the minimal AC increase has kept me in a mix of  <br/>
magic/banded.<br/>
      <br/>
Am I to understand that putting on a bunch of bronze for an AC increase of  <br/>
around 8 or 10 pts is going to make a big big difference in mob damage?<br/>
