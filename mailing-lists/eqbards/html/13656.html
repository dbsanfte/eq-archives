<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479874434">Hmmm...  You may want to forward their names and the incident, in detail, to<br/>
Verant.  I think they&#39;ld like to know how they found out also (and<br/>
considering Verant&#39;s stance on out-of-game sales, they may be willing to<br/>
consider it as harrassment   &gt;;o)~  ).<br/>

&gt;Ok, I am really bloody Mad now. I was contacted In-game by these morons<br/>
 </span></blockquote>last<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;night, after getting my character back. They seemed to have known about my<br/>
&gt;&quot;accident&quot; and then offered to sell me, buy things from me over the net<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To top it all off, they live close to me in Michigan.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How did they know my character was deleted? And then they have the nerve to<br/>
&gt;ask me to buy things from them with a credit card!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can not, and will not stand for having to buy things with real money for<br/>
&gt;an online game! Nothing upsets me more than people who FARM items to sell<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Ebay, or whatever or wherever they sell. Get a damn job. Don&#39;t rob me of<br/>
&gt;having fun in an online game so you can make a damn profit!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I cannot even gather my thoughts, I am so mad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any thoughts are appreciated. This is just wrong, in my opinion.<br/>
