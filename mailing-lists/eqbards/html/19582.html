<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768206219">The kaesora coin<br/>
=================<br/>
Not that hard to get. I have 3 or 4 of them.<br/>
<br/>
The failed crypt raider drops the coin, and seems to drop it every time. He<br/>
spawns near the library. Getting to the library is laughably easy. You can<br/>
pull singles or doubles the whole way there just by pulling slowly and<br/>
carefully, no lulling is needed. The raider seems to be on approx a 40 min<br/>
spawn, which is about twice the regular spawn rate of the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Scrounger coin<br/>
===============<br/>
Scrounger happened to be there one day as I was passing through. I soloed<br/>
him easily despite the 2 sarnak knights that joined in. (selo, chant, chant)<br/>
<br/>
Dalnir Coin<br/>
============<br/>
PAIN IN THE BUTT to get.<br/>
<br/>
The imprecator is not a common spawn. I spent 3 hours in dalnir before he<br/>
showed. We were camping the church, but the 2 times he spawned, he spawned<br/>
in the upstairs location. (2nd level) A druid was at the upstairs spot, so<br/>
we went up there and I bought the coin for 50p. (which is what I had on me)<br/>
<br/>
Bloodgill Coin<br/>
===============<br/>
dunno, bought if from a merchant for 6 silver. :┬¼ )<br/>
<br/>
City of Mist Coin<br/>
==================<br/>
Captain of the guard spawns near the entrance. You need to clear 1-4 mobs<br/>
before you can pull him. He drops the coin everytime. I have 3 or 4 of these<br/>
as well, and saw many others go to party members.<br/>
<br/>
Emerald Forest<br/>
===============<br/>
All luck. Our druid foraged it on the first try. (whoo hoo)<br/>
<br/>
Star of Odus<br/>
=============<br/>
Approx 105 p. Can be purchased in Erudin or East Cabalis.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all there was to it for me. Got my tamborine and am loving every<br/>
second of it.<br/>

I paid 5 pp for the foraged one (The guy said to give him whatever.. <br/>
I felt like a cheapskate, but it was all the money I had in the world <br/>
at the time.. I&#39;ll probably find him and give him some more money at <br/>
some point) and 50 pp for the coin in Kaesora.  The guy in Kaesora <br/>
was very helpful in telling me how difficult it would be to get the <br/>
coins and (from what he said) that specific coin was pretty rare, so <br/>
I felt it was worth more.  The one&#39;s in Dalnir I got for free.<br/>
<br/>
Prices could vary tremendously, I imagine, but remember that the <br/>
person you&#39;re dealing with can not complete the quest (unless they <br/>
are a Bard, have a Bard, or know a Bard).  I always offer to pay in <br/>
my shout to the zone and then leave it up to the person who offers to <br/>
decide how much they want for it.  Most people don&#39;t know what <br/>
they&#39;re for and are actually happy to give it away for free when you <br/>
tell them (MENTION THAT IT&#39;S NO DROP!!!!).  And most people would <br/>
have destroyed it anyway, so ANY money is more than they&#39;d get <br/>
otherwise.<br/>
