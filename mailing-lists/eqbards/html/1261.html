&gt;Hm, I&#39;m around the same level as you, and do -not- have the problem.<br/>
&gt;Personally, I ditched the Mino Axe I wielded around level 7 or so.  I<br/>
&gt;realized that my chief strength should be speed, take most advantage of my<br/>
&gt;buffing songs that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Consider this: Recently a troll and I were good naturedly beating on the<br/>
&gt;same monster... he with some gigantic sword that seemed to be doing a<br/>
&gt;massive amount of damage, and me with a fine steel spear.  He bashed, I<br/>
&gt;bellowed.  And when all was said and done I got the loot.  The troll was<br/>
&gt;quite upset, stared down at the little man with the toothpick, couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;understand how I had bested him--especially when I conned &quot;blue&quot; to him.<br/>

&gt;There&#39;s formulas about this people have posted here, I honestly think your<br/>
&gt;problem is that damn axe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know I should upgrade to a combine weapon, haven&#39;t gotten around to it<br/>
&gt;yet.  And you know, almost tempted to grab a rapier...   can&#39;t decide if I<br/>
&gt;should.  Have a feeling the rapier might not be such a great &quot;main&quot; weapon,<br/>
&gt;yet I&#39;m certain I&#39;ll use a rapier when I dual wield.  (Part of my<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Regular rapiers have the same Damage/delay as a<br/>
regular scimitar, which is what I use.  I&#39;ve done rough<br/>
tests comparing damage over time with the scimitar<br/>
vs. the Mino axe.  With our generally lower str (mine&#39;s<br/>
85) lighter faster weapons *SEEM* to do better<br/>
damage over time.<br/>
<br/>
I personally see my bard with a combine rapier and<br/>
some sort of dagger at 17 (Maybe a chrysKnife).<br/>
But I have to &quot;recover&quot; my piercing skill.  I&#39;m building<br/>
up skill points to jump start it.<br/>
<br/>
Tindayen, who was amazed to see a fellow bard<br/>
say &quot;but rogues do more damage ....&quot; on the a.g.eq<br/>
newsgroup.  Some people are only happy if they&#39;re<br/>
whining.</div>
