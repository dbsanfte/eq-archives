<div id="ygrps-yiv-960668582">I had some general comments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Charming in a group is the best thing to do on a 2 pull even if there is a<br/>
&gt; chanter.  Once you get good, the mob will be doing 90% of its damage on the<br/>
&gt; party&#39;s main target, 10% on you.  Thats a great tradeoff to 0-10% damage<br/>
&gt; done to chanter/healer and mana spent mezzing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is my &quot;pet assist&quot; hotkey, it works great.  Rule 1, let the group know<br/>
&gt; what you&#39;re doing, and make sure its ok with the enchanter.  Most are happy<br/>
&gt; for the mana you save them.  Type A enchanters will not be happy, so then<br/>
&gt; just let them mez the mob...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok 2 Pull comes, assist the puller and find out what mob he is killing.<br/>
&gt; Target the non targeted mob and hit charm, once it sticks (very low resists<br/>
&gt; if you have a good CHA) hit the &quot;pet assist&quot; hotkey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once you get this down its easy to weave 2 other songs while doing this...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Pet Assist&quot;<br/>
&gt; /pet back off<br/>
&gt; /assist &lt;main assist name&gt;<br/>
&gt; /pause 3<br/>
&gt; /pet attack<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The pet back off is not necesaary, but seems to help.  Sometimes charms mobs<br/>
&gt; will still attack other party members or pets, the pet back off will prevent<br/>
&gt; this.  It also lets the party know what you have charmed, since your pet<br/>
&gt; will say something.  THe down side is the second or so of melee you lose<br/>
&gt; from your pet while he is waiting for the attack command.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a side not, /pet back off, is probably the best mem blur spell in the<br/>
&gt; game.<br/>

group know<br/>
what you&#39;re doing, and make sure its ok with the enchanter.&quot;  Lots of<br/>
enchanters don&#39;t mind help, they just need to know when help is comming. <br/>
Nothing usually erks an enchanter more than when you charm or mez, or when<br/>
necros ST a mob just as they get their mez spell off.  So let them and everyone<br/>
else know, communication is a key part in running an efficient group.<br/>

&gt; I am also experimenting with using SoS in the pull group on raids.  WIth the<br/>
&gt; new heal rules, the most important part of raids (at least in my opinion) is<br/>
&gt; keeping your clerics alive.  Giving the tanks a few extra rounds to build up<br/>
&gt; hate, could mean the difference...  Clearly don&#39;t do this is you are feign<br/>
&gt; pulling :)<br/>

songs.  If the puller (lets say monk) gets too much stuff and brings it back<br/>
near the group you better make sure your puller knows the range of your songs. <br/>
If you get a pulse before the monk FDs, get ready to eat a train.<br/>
Bards in the pull group are great, as long as they are very attentive about the<br/>
range of their songs and the effect on the puller.  I have a tendancy to put<br/>
Bards in groups with an enchanter, necro, cleric, back up melee. for mana dumps<br/>
and such to the rest of the raid.  Its not that I don&#39;t think bards can work<br/>
well in the pull group its just you better know your bard.<br/>
