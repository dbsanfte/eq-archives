<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872248050">that&#39;s all true, but I have also found that bards excel at corpse recovery<br/>
which would save the cleric some time in getting to the bodies to rez them<br/>
if they die as well.  Heck I hae done over 20 corpse recoveries of level 35+<br/>
players in Kithicor Forest since the change, because I was better able to<br/>
run in and drag out the bodies than they were at twice my level.  130+% MR<br/>
is a wonderful thing.  Still even this would be better than our current<br/>
level 22 song which seems to barely work (if at all).  The level 14 song has<br/>
some extremely minor uses, and would be a better candidate for replacement.<br/>
Another possible song would be a targettable language translator.  If they<br/>
started implementing quest items in notes of another language of course.<br/>

IMHO:<br/>
<br/>
Ya know, you are exactly right.  It would not unbalance the class.  But ya<br/>
know what? It would be almost totally useless.  Worse than the &quot;useless&quot;<br/>
songs we got now.  Time and again I have mentioned that when you reach level<br/>
30ish and most of your playing is with a group and most groups at this level<br/>
have clerics, it does not much matter where you are binded!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
First off, dying really is miserable above 30.  Die one time and you lost a<br/>
good 2 or 3 hours of work to get the xp back.  You can lose one quarter of a<br/>
bub of xp in a single death. So, you get smart and you dont die as much.<br/>
When you do, your cleric will rez (ressurrect) you.  He targets your corpse,<br/>
asks you if you are ready so he knows you are not zoning or running around<br/>
(you should be re-memming your songs), casts the spell on you and you get a<br/>
yes / no dialog box, you click yes and get Loading, Please Wait...<br/>
<br/>
(BTW - this usually happens after a 20 or 30 min CR &lt;corpse retrieval&gt;<br/>
session as the others in your group who survived - the clerics bind nearby<br/>
and gate before they die if possible - go back in and drag the corpses to a<br/>
safe place to rez. And 20 or 30 min is for like mid 30&#39;s - mid 40&#39;s and up<br/>
their CR&#39;s take much longer if its a bad death - or so I am told. So where<br/>
you are binded makes little difference - you can run back and even be in the<br/>
zone before they get you dragged out to a safe rez spot.  And then they will<br/>
rez you even if you are right there in an attempt to get some of your xp<br/>
back.)<br/>
<br/>
Then you appear next to your corpse with the &quot;rez effect&quot; (str, sta, health<br/>
drained and 0 mana).  You loot and get your stuff and hang out while the rez<br/>
effect wears off.  It does not matter where you are binded.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a good group at these levels, you have someone who can teleport<br/>
and thus someone who can bind.  So, at the end of the action, he generally<br/>
gates people to where they need to go and slaps a bind on you if you want<br/>
one.   <br/>
<br/>
Granted, if you are a solo monkey and think that 3am middle of the week is a<br/>
good time to explre the Kerran Isle cuz you have never been there in in 44<br/>
levels or you heard from your level 42 ranger pal that the Mino Hero spawns<br/>
at 2:56 am Eastern time if you give the gnome guard some muffins and really<br/>
wish you had a bind inside Kaladim cus you are gonna make some Tumpy Tonics<br/>
there - them ya a bind song would be nice.<br/>
<br/>
But for the most part, it&#39;s totally useless at the &quot;high&quot; levels.  Even at<br/>
the &quot;mid&quot; levels, and even at most times of day, you can get binds in<br/>
&quot;popular&quot; places pretty easily.  Where bind would be usefull is for bards<br/>
who do alot of travelling at lower levels - like 8 to 18 (getting self-bind<br/>
at 16 to 18 with a full mana burn and group bind - everyone in group at one<br/>
shot with a full mana burn would be a value to the bard class.) <br/>
<br/>
By my 20&#39;s, if there&#39;s a binder in zone, I can usually use normal say&#39;s and<br/>
have a nice conversation that leads to a bind.  If the guy&#39;s a high lev,<br/>
there usually no need to pay him. If the guy&#39;s a lo lev who just got his<br/>
bind power and is still happy to show it off, I usually over tip him.  If<br/>
the guy wants to be paid up front, I don&#39;t even let him bind me and usually<br/>
ask how much he thinks I should charge to taunt the next mob off him when he<br/>
needs some help.  <br/>
<br/>
Arrgh - i hate these threads on bards getting bind!<br/>
<br/>
Bard DO NOT _need_ binding power (any more than any other class that does<br/>
not have it.) They especially do not need it at higher levels where it is<br/>
superfulious for several reasons (rez, group gaters, groups with 2 or 3<br/>
binders, many friends.)<br/>
