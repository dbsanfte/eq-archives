<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248653887"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; running across a few zones is an incredible hardship.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s 1 example that really happened to me that will<br/>
give 1 reason I think all classes should be able to<br/>
bind in some way. (Purchased item, song, spell, etc)<br/>
<br/>
1. Leave freeport.<br/>
Get to Highpass.<br/>
Nobody able or willing to bind.<br/>
Leave highpass and die in N.Karana.<br/>
2. Start over in Freeport.<br/>
Get to Highpass.<br/>
Nobody able or willing to bind.<br/>
Leave highpass and die in N.Karana trying to get corpse.<br/>
3. Start over in Freeport.<br/>
Get to Highpass.<br/>
Nobody able or willing to bind.<br/>
Leave highpass and die in N.Karana trying to get corpse.<br/>
4. Start over in Freeport.<br/>
Get to Highpass.<br/>
Nobody able or willing to bind.<br/>
Leave highpass and recover corpses in N.Karana.<br/>
Arrive in Qeynos.<br/>
Nobody able or willing to bind.<br/>
Killed by a guard for an unknown reason.<br/>
5. Camp bard and play cleric.<br/>
<br/>
That was 6+ hours in total. Over 5 of those hours<br/>
were spent running naked across Antonica. I am<br/>
not making any of that up. Yes, I offered to pay<br/>
for the binds. Aparently 5pp isn&#39;t worth the mana<br/>
to people in Highpass. Yay, now I own 4 more<br/>
drums than I did before. *twirls finger*<br/>
<br/>
It takes me somewhere between an hour to an hour<br/>
and a half to run non-stop from Freeport to Qeynos.<br/>
If I die along the way, it&#39;s definitely an<br/>
&quot;incredible hardship&quot; as you put it. I could have<br/>
been practicing my brewing or gaining experience or<br/>
just talking to friends for those 6 hours rather<br/>
than running around naked doing absolutely NOTHING<br/>
enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
So tell me please. Where is the balance in this?<br/>
And don&#39;t give me that &quot;You just had bad luck&quot;<br/>
line. I&#39;m not the only person things like this<br/>
happen to and this isn&#39;t the only time I&#39;ve had<br/>
something like this happen.<br/>
<br/>
Count the zones: Bound on Freeport docks  so each<br/>
death means going through 3 zones just to buy<br/>
another drum and head out the West Gates. But<br/>
let&#39;s not count those.<br/>
<br/>
W.Freeport, E.Commons, W.Commons, Kithicor,<br/>
Highpass, E.Karana, N.Karana<br/>
8 Zones on each death.<br/>
<br/>
W.Karana, Q.Hills, Qeynos<br/>
3 more zones to destination.<br/>
<br/>
4 x 8 = 32 zones + 3 on the trip that I actually<br/>
arrived in Qeynos for. That&#39;s 35 zones I had to<br/>
go through to get to Qeynos on this fateful trip.<br/>
(Add another 9 to count the &#39;drum runs&#39; for 41<br/>
zones in actuality) Let&#39;s compare a caster that<br/>
can bind at each new zone border they cross.<br/>
<br/>
11 zones. Tops.<br/>
<br/>
Great balancing act.</div>
