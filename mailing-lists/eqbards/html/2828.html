&gt;So how does everyone else manage to juggling instruments/weapons and<br/>
&gt;not drop something on the ground?  I just lost a fine steel spear,<br/>
&gt;which I spent most of my bank account on (money isn&#39;t exactly prolific<br/>
&gt;at level 8).  Tried to shout and see if someone would return it, but<br/>
&gt;alas to no avail.  Yes I&#39;m using the inventory-as-hotkey method.  I<br/>
&gt;have no problem juggling 2-3 songs, but trying to switch instruments<br/>
&gt;is a serious PITA with the risk of dropping something.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>you think THAT&#39;S bad, at 9 I spent my life&#39;s savings (about 15 pp) on<br/>
a tentacle whip, and dropped it with a wisp banging on me, and lost it.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a tremendous help if inventory hot-boxes acted like the rest,<br/>
i.e. if primary melee was in box 1, pressing 1 would pick up your weapon<br/>
on the mouse, and pressing it again would put it back.  As it is, you just<br/>
have to be careful about mouse placement, which is hard if it starts<br/>
lagging (a frequent occurrence in a big fight)<br/>
