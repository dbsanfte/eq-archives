<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884775100">well, learning more of your story, I whole heartedly agree.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot go to sol a with no tanks at that level. Simply can&#39;t be done.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest heading down to Najena for a spell. Najena seems to have an<br/>
inordinately high amount of casters. Casters, as you know, have low hp, so<br/>
they are great prey for a magic heavy group.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, using an all instrument attack (Hymn, DDD, CoD) you can plow<br/>
through tentacle terrors. I soloed all of level 24 in one night (4-5 hours)<br/>
just killing the TTs in najena. Najena is a great spot for many of the same<br/>
reasons as sol a. It is empty. (the night I soloed, I was the only person in<br/>
najena) If you are bringing your whole group, then I suggest hitting<br/>
Bonecracker&#39;s room or either doing the TTs or the goblins. Goblins are<br/>
probably better exp, but I hear there is a new high level NPC in those<br/>
parts, so be very careful. If you are lucky, you might be able to take over<br/>
a named spawn when someone leaves. Assuming your party is avg level 23, you<br/>
can easily hold the najena room, the ogre captain or the bonecracker room.<br/>
Although breaking any of these (particularly najena&#39;s room) might be<br/>
difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d try bonecracker first. Full spawn is 2 necros, 2 pets and bonecracker.<br/>
With an enchanter this is child&#39;s play. I suggest killing the necros first.<br/>
Have the enchanter charm one of the pets and sick it on the other, while the<br/>
party helps out. Then do bonecracker last. Try to draw out the bonecracker<br/>
fight so you can space the spawn. Spawn time is 19.5 minutes and you can<br/>
pull mobs from the surrounding areas in between room spawns. Without an<br/>
enchanter, it&#39;s harder. I&#39;d probably do necros, then bonecracker, then pets<br/>
last. Have the cleric stun to interupt casters and be sure to focus on one<br/>
mob at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Ogre captain is a pain, but a little more fun to crack. Clear out the<br/>
elemental room first. (as you come down the stairs, it is the door on the<br/>
right.) Should be 4 - 6 spawns in there, but they are elementals which<br/>
aren&#39;t that hard. Cardinal rule here: no runners. If you let a runner go<br/>
around the corner, you&#39;re in for a hurting. Once the elem room is clear, med<br/>
to full and pull the 3 ogres from around the corner. (keep a careful eye on<br/>
the clock the whole time here, you don&#39;t want to get caught in respawn) med<br/>
up again and you&#39;re ready for the captain. Usually the captain spawns with<br/>
an elite guard and a regular guard, although it may be 2 elites sometimes.<br/>
Also rarely there will be a visiting priestess. If you see the priestess,<br/>
come back another time. She won&#39;t agro on you when you attack the cap, but<br/>
she will heal him. If you are foolish enough to try. (I know I was) Then it<br/>
is imperative that you kill the priestess first.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly Najena&#39;s room. Very tough break as a full spawn is 2 mages, najena<br/>
and 3 pets. If you are lucky, najena won&#39;t be spawned for the break.<br/>
Standard Operating Procedure is kill najena, then the mages then the pets.<br/>
<br/>
eep, meeting, gotta run, more later perhaps.<br/>

<br/>
Bards are wonderfully powerful if there are no casters around.<br/>
My group is just the opposite, there are no non-casters around, guild wide<br/>
pretty much.<br/>
<br/>
I am 23rd level.  I don&#39;t play enough hours to gain even two levels in 3<br/>
weeks though.<br/>
I like Sol A a lot, but I can&#39;t be effective in Sol A.  I can&#39;t really tank<br/>
and if a group is caster heavy they really have no other use for me.  This<br/>
has done nothing but continue to foster my opinion that melee classes are<br/>
not useful until you get to the level where they artificially created a use<br/>
for them by giving critters insane resists.  The cleric can tank as well for<br/>
this group as I can.  His heals of himself when he tanks are sufficient<br/>
taunt to keep the mobs on him and the other casters can easily make it a<br/>
one-gob fight 90% of the time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
what level are you kit?<br/>
<br/>
I leveled from 25 - 34 in 3 weeks in sol a. I don&#39;t think I totaled more<br/>
than 6 deaths for the entire span.<br/>
<br/>
If you give me your level, I would be glad to tell you where I hunted, the<br/>
group makeup, what we had trouble with, etc. Personally I found sol a to be<br/>
my favorite zone. It&#39;s rarely crowded, has good loot, TONS of goblins to<br/>
pull, great exp and I found myself to be a very valuable member of the<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
One group in paricular was bard (me), 2 monks, 2 rangers and 1 warrior. We<br/>
were about level 30 and camped in the bar. The carnage that we created was<br/>
unbelievable. We finished every single fight at full health, including one<br/>
where we had a mix of 8 inferno, fire and flame goblins, including 2 wizzies<br/>
and 2 shamen. It was by far one of the best displays of how powerful bards<br/>
are. I sang Hymn with lute, anthem and psalm of warmth and we were<br/>
unstoppable.<br/>

<br/>
I would try that, but the cleric would probably just let me die to prove his<br/>
point.  In Sol A it is a big taunt.  If I play Hymn and my two other songs I<br/>
definitely get the bulk of the attention.  The last 6 times we have had<br/>
deaths in our Sol A groups, on 5 of them the deaths have gone like this.<br/>
1st death: me, 2nd death: other bard (lower level), 3rd death: other melee<br/>
person.  The two bards have died a combined 15 times in our Sol A guild<br/>
groups.  The other guildmembers have died a grand total of 6 times combined.<br/>
Every time there is a bad pull or we get trained its the bards that pay the<br/>
price.  On one occasion the enchanter got waxed first by a wizard, but we<br/>
were not far behind even then.<br/>

<br/>
Hmm sounds like you&#39;re letting your group dictate how to play your class.<br/>
DONT buy into it.  You know how to be a bard better than they do.  Hymn is<br/>
NOT that big a taunt.  Especially in today&#39;s dungeons.  They&#39;re _hardly_<br/>
dangerous.  I can walk the entire length of lower guk, live to dead side,<br/>
and I might actually pull a train of 3 critters.<br/>
<br/>
Play your class the way you think it should be played.  Generally I find out<br/>
who&#39;s doing what and then I go, OK, I&#39;m going to be doing X.  If they argue<br/>
I simply state &quot;You be a (insert class here), I&#39;ll be a Bard.  If you don&#39;t<br/>
like it, lets trade accounts&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That usually shuts them up.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line:  You play your character, don&#39;t let others tell you how :)<br/>

&gt; Our enchanter seems to have no trouble keeping both tanks Alacrity&#39;d thru<br/>
&gt; the night and still does crowd control.  Yes I could give us all a<br/>
speedup,<br/>
&gt; but since the only other person even meleeing is a cleric it wouldn&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; much.  My finger-twiddling is much better spent on Chant of Battle if the<br/>
&gt; enchanter is there to Alacrity.  If he&#39;s not then Anthem gets back in the<br/>
&gt; mix.  If bards excel at anything its that we can fill in as a substitute<br/>
&gt; just-about-anything.  Problem I&#39;m starting to find is that I&#39;m only able<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; get into groups that are lacking something if there isn&#39;t a person looking<br/>
&gt; to group who&#39;s better at that thing as a primary role.  When I do get in<br/>
&gt; lately its always as a tank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last 3 nites:  Don&#39;t chain, we&#39;re darknessing.  Don&#39;t anthem we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; alacritying.  Don&#39;t Chant we&#39;re skin like something or othering.  Don&#39;t<br/>
Hymn<br/>
&gt; or you&#39;ll get too much attention and die.  Didn&#39;t leave much of anything<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; me to do but swing, bellow and go owie.  Occasionally we&#39;d pull a wizard<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; shaman gobie and I&#39;d throw the resistances in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Towards the end of the night I get asked in group tell, &quot;Can&#39;t you do<br/>
&gt; anything but Bellow?  I thought bards had all kinds of cool songs.&quot;  My<br/>
&gt; reply?  Didn&#39;t have one, told them &quot;I am retiring to the OOT to<br/>
contemplate<br/>
&gt; life while beating head on gargoyles for a while.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Swift Like the Wind costs a LOT of mana, and doesn&#39;t last as long as<br/>
&gt; the lower level speed up buff. Add onto this that there is a speed<br/>
&gt; beyond which a weapon can&#39;t get any faster. And Swift Like the Wind,<br/>
&gt; in higher levels, isn&#39;t even used on people with haste sashes. Not<br/>
&gt; worth it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So. Sometimes a minor speedup is good enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quicken is very definitely a combat buff. And fairly high mana. Grouped,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d put it on my main tank and let a bard handle the speedup for the<br/>
&gt; rest, preferring to use mana for crowd control, or other circumstances<br/>
&gt; rather than keeping everyone Quickened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just because it is better does not mean that it is always the best<br/>
&gt; use of the enchanter&#39;s mana. Bards ARE Still needed.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Swift Like The Wind<br/>
&gt; &gt;---------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt;Target: Increase Attack Speed +160.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Description:Great for tanks when grouped. Increases the amount of times<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;will hit in a round against an enemy. In large/long battles it can make a<br/>
&gt; &gt;huge difference. Quite deadly when used in conjunction with Languid<br/>
&gt; &gt;Pace/Tepid Deeds. Combine these 2 spells when possible.. talk<br/>
&gt; &gt;about breaking<br/>
&gt; &gt;the odds. Slows down your opponent, increases your attack rate<br/>
&gt; &gt;This spell doesn&#39;t stack with Augmentation, but as such it provides over<br/>
&gt; &gt;double the attack speed for the target and is usually preferred anyway.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; &gt;other important thing is that this spell helps increase combat skill gain<br/>
&gt; &gt;since you are making more skill rolls with your attack.<br/>
&gt; &gt;----------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, when SLTW &quot; provides over double the attack speed &quot; - it hardly<br/>
matters<br/>
&gt; &gt;if VoV does a 35.271% increase or a 36.983% increase.  Enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt;speed buffs<br/>
&gt; &gt;are where it&#39;s at.  I use Warsong because my enchanter wont give me SLTW.<br/>
&gt; &gt;She says she does not want me to die that quickly.  But then again<br/>
