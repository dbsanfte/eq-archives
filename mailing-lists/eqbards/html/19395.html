<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130623506">I was off the list for a while, changing email accounts. Was there a<br/>
resolution to the Burynai Bundt Cake Mystery? Is it foraged? Is it baked? Is<br/>
it chocolate on the outside and white inside? Glaze or frosting? Could you<br/>
use the mold for jello as well and have a festive holiday desert?<br/>
<br/>
Inquiring minds want to know!<br/>
