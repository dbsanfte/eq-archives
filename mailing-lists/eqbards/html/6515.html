when I first tested it some two months ago when I first got<br/>
Chain.  I only retested it because some people were insisting<br/>
that it stacked with Binding, which wasn&#39;t what I found when I<br/>
first tested it.  As far as I know, there has been no change<br/>
to the degree of attack slowdown.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I got to test the L12 enchanter attack slowdown (Languid<br/>
Pace) and it appears to be identical to Binding and Chain.<br/>
Unfortunately, since I tested it with my enchanter, I didn&#39;t<br/>
get to check if it stacked with Chain.  :-)<br/>
