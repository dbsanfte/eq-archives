<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;We dont have a public explanation of our system (at least to my knowledge)..<br/>
&gt;but here is the lowdown:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We use CP &quot;Contest Points&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Basically, loot drops.  There is then a 30 second period in which people can<br/>
&gt;&quot;Contest&quot; the loot using their points.  The person with the highest points<br/>
&gt;that chooses to contest a lotto then can exclude those who have more than 20<br/>
&gt;points less than him.  Then a lotto is run with those remaining (often only<br/>
&gt;1 or 2) and the winner has 5 points deducted from his total. You are allowed<br/>
&gt;2 contest wins in a month.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If nobody chooses to contest the lotto, then we run a regular lotto.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have a dynamic list of &quot;ubermobs&quot; which count for CP points and we earn<br/>
&gt;one point for each mob, which can add up to 4 or more a night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Advantages:<br/>
&gt;You don&#39;t lose points for every item.  In some points systems you lose x<br/>
&gt;points for x item.  This is unfair as some items are &quot;uber&quot; when you first<br/>
&gt;get them and &quot;only ok&quot; when you later win.  Therefore we felt this type of<br/>
&gt;system would unfairly punish those who get items later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like most point systems, this one rewards those who play most (they have the<br/>
&gt;most chance of amassing enough cp points to exclude others) but doens&#39;t<br/>
&gt;punish those who play less (just takes longer to accumulate cp points)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You don&#39;t HaVE to have points to win. In fact, most of our lottoes are NOT<br/>
&gt;contested but run as normal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Disadvantages:<br/>
&gt;Some of our addict level players dont feel it rewards them enough.<br/>
&gt;Points in does in no way equal points out<br/>
&gt;Since we get 1 point per mob, if you miss a 4 cp night, it really hurts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are only in our 3rd month of this system but it seems to work well and<br/>
&gt;has also cuased a HUGE jump in our attendance. Feel free to email me<br/>
&gt;personally if you have any questions!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [eqbards] Guild Loot Rules<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a url that for a point-based loot-rules<br/>
&gt; &gt; system? My current<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild is going through the &quot;big guild&quot; growing pains.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Current problems are based around things like weighing<br/>
&gt; &gt; whether full-time<br/>
&gt; &gt; should get precedence over part-time players (me being a<br/>
&gt; &gt; part-time player<br/>
&gt; &gt; have my own opinion on this) and whether certain classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; should be excluded<br/>
&gt; &gt; from particular loots (us bards tend to get shunted aside for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; classes as an example).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For the record, at this time, I believe that people who<br/>
&gt; &gt; participate in more<br/>
&gt; &gt; raids should get a weighted advantage over part-timers, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; not to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; part-timer&#39;s exclusion. As for class exclusions, as a bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s a sensitive<br/>
&gt; &gt; subject to me. I&#39;d prefer no class exclusions myself, just<br/>
&gt; &gt; restrict it to<br/>
&gt; &gt; those who could actually use the item. Another bard in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild left when<br/>
&gt; &gt; he ranted about being told he could not roll for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; breastplate somewhere in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Velious.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Obviously a sticky situation. Since I&#39;m on the rules committee for my<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild, I figured I&#39;d find out how other guilds may have tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; to solve<br/>
&gt; &gt; these and other dilemmas. Though, one nice thing is that<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are 3 bards<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the rules committee. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, we all feel it&#39;s best to get rules written into stone<br/>
&gt; &gt; that are<br/>
&gt; &gt; approved by a large majority of the guild (3/4th I believe).<br/>
&gt; &gt; All sorts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; problems could be sorted out once we have a set up rules that are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; changed arbitrarily.<br/>
