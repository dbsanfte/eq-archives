&gt;+ Added stat and other bonuses to instruments<br/>
&gt;Where? None of my instrument stats changed for the better IE: Bonus? means<br/>
&gt;something added, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Correct.  Origininally (at release) no instruments had any <br/>
bonuses.  Apparently they added some to some higher-level &quot;gimmes&quot; from the <br/>
gods on the Planes.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Lambent. How about some more? Instruments and such. as it is, besides The<br/>
&gt;lambent, bards have some pretty poor quests. (4 I think)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lambent, Mail-runs, and I think there&#39;s a Bard-related quest in Halas <br/>
(don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Bard specific, since I&#39;ve never finished it).  But also <br/>
remember, we are the class most likely to be able to do ANY quest...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added more Class Specific Items<br/>
&gt;Again, We have very few class specific items. I think they added a grand<br/>
&gt;total of 5<br/>
&gt;Look at warriors. They have millions;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They need millions.  Pathetic grunt-punchers ;)  Seriously, though - most <br/>
of what is considered &quot;Bard-specific&quot; as near as I can tell (besides <br/>
Imbrued and Lambent armour) is magical instruments.  So, true, we don&#39;t <br/>
have much... but... um.. neither do Monks or Rogues (I&#39;m sure they&#39;d love <br/>
+10 daggers of penetrating or Magical boots of kicking booty...)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Corrected Bug that let monsters attack you from far distances through your<br/>

&gt;Didnt know this was an issue, since charm only lasts ten seconds<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d be surprised how far a critter can teleport in 10 seconds...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added Addition Effects to Some Bard Songs<br/>
&gt;Forgot to mention that Levitate will not work now. Would like to know what<br/>
&gt;effects were added<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He may be referring to visual effects rather than actual useful <br/>
stuff.  Dunno there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added New Bard Songs<br/>
&gt;New bard songs?, or do you mean, fixed ones that didn&#39;t work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrm - Well, we *JUST* got a new song, I think, on the test server...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added Ability for Bards to Punch &#39;Magic Only&#39; Creatures<br/>
&gt;I thought I could always do this, with magic gloves<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope - originally, it was a Monk-only ability.  Now we can do it with magic <br/>
gloves, or with an instrument in our hands.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Increased the Power of Some Bard Songs (c.f. Chant Series,<br/>
&gt;Fifil&#39;s, etc.)<br/>
&gt;Hmm, I have not seen any &quot;Increase&quot; in power of bard songs, only a decrease<br/>
&gt;(IE Lullaby, Lament, Pixie strike, Selo&#39;s) Shouldn&#39;t there be a negative in<br/>
&gt;here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think he was counting &quot;unintentional&quot; nerfs....<br/>
