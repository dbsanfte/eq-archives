&gt;I have read several postings on this instrument and asked people in-game.  <br/>
&gt;The postings and opinions have not been consistent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I now have one and I am told it increases non-self healing rate.  I plan to <br/>
&gt;test this tonight; I am interested in others&#39; experiences as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My primary question though is: what is it worth?  Has anyone bought one, <br/>
&gt;sold one, or seen one bought or sold?<br/>
