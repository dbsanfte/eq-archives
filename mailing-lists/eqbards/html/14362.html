<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490576894">First, I get the mail in digest form and didn&#39;t know it was kabong&#39;d, sorry<br/>
I continued it.<br/>
<br/>
Second, A BIG apology to Harmonic!  I didn&#39;t notice that yours was a<br/>
personal email.  I stand corrected on your behavior on this list.  It<br/>
remains of a high standard.  You are a good role model ).<br/>
<br/>
Third, Steelwolf, shame on you for posting a personal email to a public<br/>
mailing list.<br/>

Ok, you two, am I gonna have to call your father in here with his belt? jk<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s all calm down a bit shall we.  Steelwolf, you are entitled to your<br/>
opinion and so is Harmonic.  There is no need for this cursing and flaming<br/>
going on from either of you.  In Harm&#39;s original post, his subject line even<br/>
said it was a rant and off topic.  In the text prior to his rant he said, if<br/>
you don&#39;t want to read it, just delete it.  That should be good enough for<br/>
all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Now Harmonic, I understand that it is very hard to get personal attacks from<br/>
people, but it does no good to join in and start bashing as well.  It just<br/>
perpetuates the cycle and everyone gets to look bad.  I honestly expect a<br/>
little more from you.  You ( as well as some of the other prolific posters)<br/>
are like the big brothers of the board.  The rest of us take our cue from<br/>
you on how to act.  If you start bringing it down to this level, the list is<br/>
gonna degrade pretty fast.  That said, I really admire your contribution to<br/>
the list.  I hope I too can contribute when I am more accomplished as a<br/>
bard.<br/>
<br/>
As for the rest of you, let&#39;s act like the adults I know most of you are and<br/>
let people have their say without condemning them and flaming them.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t like it, give your own opinion without making it a personal attack.<br/>
It&#39;s just your opinion after all.<br/>
