&gt; I have noticed this, too, using the lute no less.  Easily lulled creatures <br/>
&gt; now resist as though I were 8th and trying the song for the first <br/>
&gt; time--without a lute.  I have completely given up on it as it is a huge drag <br/>
&gt; having to swim a few miles away from a couple angry birds.  I&#39;d petition but <br/>
&gt; GMs are generally the enemy anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought people would have noticed this a while ago. The effectiveness<br/>
of the Lament was drastically reduced a couple of patches ago. I stopped<br/>
using it then, as it became less than useful on the mobs I was fighting<br/>
at the time. Maybe it&#39;s been reduced in effectiveness even more in the<br/>
most recent patch.<br/>
<br/>
A few more silent changes I&#39;ve found that you may find dismaying. The<br/>
serrated bone dirk, formerly usable by bards, is now not. Same with the<br/>
Black Enamored Chest (actually I think that&#39;s supposed to be black<br/>
enamaled and eq&#39;lizer has it spelled wrong but I&#39;d have to wait until I<br/>
get in game and check with our cleric to be sure), which is now wearable<br/>
by every plate wearing class but the bard. I&#39;ve also heard but haven&#39;t<br/>
yet confirmed, that the Mithril chest plate is also not wearable by<br/>
bards. It looks like we have effectively been turned into honorary chain<br/>
wearers in terms of magic armor, in that Rubicite so far is the only<br/>
armor other than steel and bronze that we can actually wear.<br/>
