&gt; Why EQ is a blessing from above, I tell you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not to mention: Think of the UV rays we did not expose ourselves to by<br/>
staying inside all summer and the lowered risk of skin cancer!  And, if we<br/>
didn&#39;t have EQ we&#39;d prolly run out of things to talk to our friends about<br/>
and god forbid we might actually work out and get in shape *shudders*...<br/>
