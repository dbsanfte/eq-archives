Well, it hasn&#39;t happened at L49 so I&#39;m not holding my breath that it<br/>
will happen at 50 as the song for that level appears to be an Anthem<br/>
upgrade. The best damage you could probably do with songs would be the<br/>
L48 song and CoD, as both are string songs, and they definately wouldn&#39;t<br/>
beat the damage you could do with dual Ykesha&#39;s. In fact they don&#39;t even<br/>
come close to the damage you can do with a claw and dirk from what I can<br/>
see. As well, that means you would also only be able to play one other<br/>
party buff song, and our best attack song at that level is berzerker&#39;s<br/>
which is horn.  If any other L48+ bard has figured out a way to do more<br/>
damage with instruments I&#39;d appreciate hearing it.<br/>

<br/>
just curious as I am much lower level than you and thus my experience may <br/>
not be quite as extensive, but are you working damage upon multiple mobs at <br/>
once into the equation?<br/>
<br/>
Sure, one on one, I have no doubts you are correct.  But I wonder about <br/>
group on group.........</div>
