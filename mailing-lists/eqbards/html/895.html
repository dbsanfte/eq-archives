<b>Subject:</b> Quick note on Ringmail <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558507084">Someone may have mentioned this and I just missed it, but Ringmail never existed. It was invented by<br/>
artists depicting chainmail (apparently) having never seen it and somehow the notion caught on. I<br/>
have books that have whole chapters about it, trying to explain it&#39;s design but not one piece has<br/>
ever been found and not one conjectural recreation has ever been anything but plain stupid (overly<br/>
heavy, lacking flexibility, the bands having no purpose but to try to make it fit the artwork).<br/>
Note, &quot;banded&quot; is not the same as &quot;splinted&quot; which is chain reinforced with thin plates (most Indian<br/>
armour was spinted)<br/>
<br/>
So, when I bought my first piece of banded THEN I knew I was a fantasy game...*laughs*<br/>
