our skill in the instrument had an effect on our missed notes, and level was<br/>
what increased our song effectivness.  it was all the missed notes at 50<br/>
people were getting that prompted them to just make 39+ songs 5% fixed<br/>
fizzle rate since our 200 skills were not helping.  anyone know for sure,<br/>
please divulge =)<br/>
