<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124319294">My comments on all three songs:<br/>
<br/>
1) Lullaby: Lifesaver. Not only for me but the group.<br/>
   When we have to evac, I sing this song and get <br/>
   pretty much everything on me while the healer keeps<br/>
   me alive and our gater gets us out. The reason this<br/>
   song is so effective for me is because I&#39;m almost <br/>
   always grouped with a healer. When I nod, it&#39;s the<br/>
   job of my healer to keep me alive while the rest<br/>
   work on killing one mob at a time. Also, because <br/>
   nod pretty much taunts everything onto me, the <br/>
   casters in my group have a easy time nuking one <br/>
   target at a time. I usually do this when we pull<br/>
   4 or more mobs. Very effective strategy from my <br/>
   personal experience. Drawback is that this doesn&#39;t<br/>
   really work with mobs that are higher level than me.<br/>
<br/>
2) Charm: I think it&#39;s a great song. Great way to get<br/>
   stuff off casters and also great when the pull is<br/>
   small. However in larger pulls, I favor Lullaby. I<br/>
   don&#39;t always have this song memmed though. Depends<br/>
   on where I go to fight.<br/>
<br/>
3) Pixie Strike: Too bad this doesn&#39;t wipe S-List as <br/>
   one of the bard webpages claimed. Another great song<br/>
   However, the problem I have with using Pixie Strike<br/>
   for crowd control is this, I have to keep changing <br/>
   targets. And I don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but<br/>
   sometimes, I find it impossible to click on the mob<br/>
   I wish to target. This is esp true when all of them<br/>
   are clumped together. <br/>
