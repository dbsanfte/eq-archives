On Next Arch Mage Answers <br/>
I&#39;ve recently received emails from concerned Bards over the lack of answers<br/>
pertaining to various issues surrounding their respected class. <br/>
As you may know, early last month Abashi stated that the next Arch Mage<br/>
Answers update would be dedicated to the Bard class. We haven&#39;t heard<br/>
anything new on when this update would be posted, until recently when Abashi<br/>
made the following post: <br/>
	GZ is currently writing up his next ArchMage Answers. By &quot;currently&quot;<br/>
I mean that I just went by his office and he was composing the document. <br/>
	I imagine we&#39;ll have it up Soon(tm). <br/>
