<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091802511">Last night,WAY too late into the night a Wizard and I took an Aviak Guard  that was red to me at 15,<br/>
yellow to her at 17. WOOOO! After running like a little schoolgirl from every blue Fire Elem in<br/>
Lavastorm my ego seriously needed that.At one point I stood toe to toe with it (after she had to<br/>
zone), giving as good as I got (weaving whistling warsong, Anthem and bellow, using my Dragoon dirk)<br/>
for about 2 bubbles of health. Finally it pulled ahead and I had to zone. She and I healed up and<br/>
went back, there is was back in it&#39;s perch mostly healed but still wounded (because of my healing<br/>
song we had pulled ahead) and I pulled it again. This time we succeeded. Weeeee!<br/>
Sure, we had to zone, but had a zone not been available I would have just run us away from there<br/>
(*sings Brave Brave Sir Robin*) weaving Accelerondo and healing.<br/>
Moral of the storry, I luuuuv being a bard, I luuuuuuve my dragoon dirk<br/>
