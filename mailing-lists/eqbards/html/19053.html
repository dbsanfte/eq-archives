<b>Subject:</b> Thoughts on the level 49 song... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074128385">I participated on a large Chardok raid this last weekend, and had a <br/>
thought about when song could be placed at level 49. How about <br/>
something as simple as Chant of Poison? <br/>
<br/>
Adding another chant would do a couple of things:<br/>
<br/>
1) When multiple groups (each having a Bard) take on a large MOB, <br/>
there will be more song options available. This also will help in <br/>
groups consisting of more than one Bard.<br/>
2) When fighting a MOB with a high resist in one area, a Bard can <br/>
choose the other three chants. I.E. In SolB, I might opt for MR, CR, <br/>
and PR.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Am I way off the mark here? 1) It should be simple to implement, and <br/>
2) we already have three chants by then, so this will be giving up <br/>
more option -- rounding out the class.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I had the chance to meet Tawney on the raid. It was a pleasure <br/>
to have met you.<br/>
