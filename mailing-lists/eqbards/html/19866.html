<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024445619">Items costs vary DRAMATICALLY from server to server.  Unfortunately for me -<br/>
Xegony players seem to be among the most outrageous pricers.<br/>
<br/>
The best place to check prices is www.maximumeq.com This site allows buyers<br/>
and sellers to post what they paid for items.   As you can see there - with<br/>
4 quotes posted - they have sold between 1 - 6k.  On Xegony I&#39;ve seen people<br/>
asking 8k (This is a server where people often pay 6k or more for a SSOY).<br/>
<br/>
Personally - I can&#39;t see paying 6k for AC21 and summon water...<br/>
