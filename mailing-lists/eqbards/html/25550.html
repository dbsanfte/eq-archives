<div id="ygrps-yiv-989304607">Try the swamp then.  From the LoIO zone in FV, hug that left wall around<br/>
into the zone.  Head in until you see water.  Nice variety of low-level<br/>
mobs right around there.  Plus it&#39;s usually empty and the zone is nearby<br/>
(and you&#39;ll be sure to max Sense Heading while your there.  Worse than G<br/>
Fay, that zone is)<br/>
