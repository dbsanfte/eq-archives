&gt; Last night, we tried to pull &quot;a few&quot; of the frogs from below the Scryer room<br/>
&gt; in Upper Guk, and ended up with about 8 - 10.  We decided to stay and fight<br/>
&gt; to see how far we could get and towards the end when we were all down to two<br/>
&gt; bubs of health, I switched to healing with the lute and Anthem... I was<br/>
&gt; TOTALLY impressed.  Not only did i keep everyone alive but we finished with<br/>
&gt; about half health!  It was great!  I love my bard!!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Congratulations!  You have discovered that sometimes, if you<br/>
play the right songs, your group can actually *gain* hp in a<br/>
fight instead of lose them.  Play around with this enough and<br/>
you&#39;ll get a feel for when you should and shouldn&#39;t do it.  <br/>
Normally I help with my weapons for the first 60%-80% of a<br/>
fight, then switch to a lute and go with Hymn, Clarity, Niv&#39;s,<br/>
Clarity to get everyone immediately ready for another pull.<br/>
<br/>
The decision to go all-instruments has actually gotten easier<br/>
since I won the lotto for a war horn from a Vox raid.  <br/>
Originally I thought this would be a pretty useless item.  <br/>
But Beserker&#39;s + Niv&#39;s with their respective instruments end<br/>
up being like a 55 point str buff and 19 point AC buff.<br/>
