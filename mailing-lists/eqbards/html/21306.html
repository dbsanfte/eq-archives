<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030311273"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Isn&#39;t Horizons another one of those games where the developers think<br/>
&gt;that in spite of UO having nothing but problems with PKs and grief<br/>
&gt;players, and EQ showing the overwhelming majority prefer a PvP<br/>
&gt;switch, that they can come up with the perfect, abuse free forced PvP<br/>
&gt;environment?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and no.  I don&#39;t think they believe that their PvP environment will be<br/>
perfect, but they think it will be good.  I like the concept behind it and<br/>
generally I abhor PvP because it is all about PK for the most part.  Two<br/>
things they are doing will make a huge difference.  Like the Team PvP<br/>
servers, only races openly at war can PvP one another without consequence.<br/>
The big difference is, there will not be a way to tell the difference<br/>
between PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s on sight.  If you see an Orc on the road ahead and<br/>
you are an elf, you know that he is dangerous to you, whether he is a player<br/>
or an npc.<br/>
<br/>
Their consequence system is brutal against PK&#39;ers.  If you kill a race that<br/>
you are not at war with, even a mere 5 or 6 times you will suffer enormous<br/>
problems.  These problems will include having npc bounty-hunters showing up<br/>
to kill you at random.  Playing a PK character would rapidly become<br/>
unplayable as every time you logged in you were ambush by these npc<br/>
enforcers.  Even if you kept your PK-ing to a race yours was at war with,<br/>
you would always find yourself in enemy territory where few would feel any<br/>
compunction against killing you.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t really interested much in Horizons initailly due to it&#39;s PvP<br/>
system, but they have convinced me to give it a chance.  They feel their PvP<br/>
system will promote the &#39;risk game&#39; like Player competition while severely<br/>
punishing to the point of oblivion anyone who PK&#39;s for the joy of hurting<br/>
others.  Time will tell.<br/>
