<div id="ygrps-yiv-849202297">Easy enough to test.  Get a friend (caster hopefully) and have him cast<br/>
every buff he has on himself.  Keep hitting him with the song and see what<br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me I never get a message when i use the song.  No dispel, no<br/>
resist, just nothing happens.  Is there some trick to the song?<br/>
<br/>
A somewhat of a tangent.  My cleric tested his cancel magic (the low lvl<br/>
one) on my roomate.  Every time I hit him, one random spell effect came off.<br/>
I continued to get the success message (Willae looks dispelled or something)<br/>
even when he had no buffs.</div>
