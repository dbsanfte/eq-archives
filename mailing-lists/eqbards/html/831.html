<div id="ygrps-yiv-530783126">Guk is one of my favorite dungeons, really have to stay on your toes<br/>
depending who&#39;s running around in there.  I&#39;m away currently, but really<br/>
miss the place.  One fool can run in the wrong area and drag a pack Froglok<br/>
Knights to the entrance, sending everybody running or dying.  Frogs will hop<br/>
off, if you let them, and bring back friends.  I&#39;ve even had to deal with<br/>
hopping frogs with Spirit of the Wolf cast on them!  Or chasing a frog and<br/>
having a nearby one healing it.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance to Innothule Swamp is in the SW corner of S Ro.  When entering<br/>
the swamp, simply hike along the shoreline on your left and you&#39;ll<br/>
eventually hit Guk, which is along the east side of the swamp.  Also of<br/>
note: There is a friendly NPC troll merchant due south of the exit to S Ro;<br/>
he stands on a large statue of a hand.  Nice for selling the occasional<br/>
rusty weapon.  (He is neutral to me, as a wood elf!)<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t try entering the troll city, which is at the southern part of the<br/>
swamp.  There also are the ocassional NPCs that run around slaughtering<br/>
folk.  I have seen a crazzed troll, a big mean Kobold.  They attacked me on<br/>
sight.  But then there&#39;s a heavy-handed high elf that wanders the swamp too,<br/>
causing hassles for the evil races.  Usually don&#39;t see them when just<br/>
running to Guk, though, so don&#39;t sweat it.<br/>
<br/>
When you arrive, do yourself and everyone a favor and ask a friendly troll<br/>
where you should -not- go, across the bridge.  They&#39;ll surely tell you,<br/>
because all the Guk regulars get very nervous when someone new to the place<br/>
shows up.  I&#39;ll say this, on the bridge: don&#39;t go up at first, take the<br/>
passage to the left instead.  One or two Frog Knights might not be bad (for<br/>
some), but a train can start really easy, wreaking havok on everyone.  After<br/>
you learn your way around, Guk can get pretty exciting.  (Hehe, and I&#39;ve<br/>
watched new Guk explorers and shouted &quot;Train!&quot; before they even started<br/>
them, so just stay on your toes.)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have heard that Upper Guk can be a good hunting ground from teens all the<br/>
&gt;way up to high twenties. Is it possible for non-evil type races to go to<br/>
&gt;Guk or are they KOS? How does one go about getting to Guk from S. Ro?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for any help,<br/>
