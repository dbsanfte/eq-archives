<div id="ygrps-yiv-853571411">I went thru Droga one night.  We took 2 groups mixed from 51 down to lo-mid<br/>
30&#39;s.  All green to 50&#39;s (iirc - maybe a few greenie exp&#39;s but essentially<br/>
all green).  We worked it like a normal dungeon crawl and tried to move thru<br/>
looking for our 51 Wiz who wandered off sight seeing and fell thru a trap<br/>
either into the jail or near the jail.  After 3 hours, we were kinda tired<br/>
and decided to gate out - never did find our wizard.  Saw some neat places<br/>
and got one really nice thing for a druid (forget what it was staff or shawl<br/>
or something with wis+).<br/>
<br/>
Droga is a huge maze.  Get a map if you are so inclined or just explore it -<br/>
but it seems endless.  It&#39;s one-way in (because you have to go down the<br/>
pit-trap and cant get out) and you need to find either zones to the mines of<br/>
Nurga or find the passages back to the entrance zone.<br/>
<br/>
What is the name of the nifty range slot item?  Sounds like something I need<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyone have much experience in Droga?  There&#39;s a nifty range slot item,<br/>
&gt; 10ac, 7str, 10sta that drops in there.  Just wondering how hard the<br/>
dungeon<br/>
&gt; is, if mobs see invis, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
