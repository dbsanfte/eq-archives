<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439743066">Gordon posted the following info (i snipped from EQVault) regarding haste<br/>
items and haste statistics recentley, which I thought you would find<br/>
interesting:<br/>
<br/>
[Quote from original post: 1) Will the mobs in the game be adjusted now that<br/>
haste has been &#39;fixed&#39; and players now deal out less damage that what the<br/>
mobs were designed to take? ]<br/>
No, they continue to be appropriate. I guess you are probably wondering how<br/>
that can be the case :) You see, mid level encounters were not typically<br/>
tested with a haste item and a haste spell, but one or the other, since<br/>
mid-level groups are more free-form in their makeup than the high level<br/>
ones. <br/>
The high level groups were typically tested with max-haste, in the form of<br/>
an item plus a spell. Now we didn&#39;t know at the time that any item plus any<br/>
spell yielded max, but testing with max was still our intent. <br/>
[Quote from original post: 2) While we&#39;re on haste, can you please try to<br/>
look into, and explain why the Swirle Spine Belt, which is considerable<br/>
harder to get than the FBSS, has less haste than the FBSS?(and you wounder<br/>
why kedge is always so empty...) ]<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that it is less haste. The players determined all of the haste<br/>
numbers by analyzing data in the log. That process has more than a few<br/>
problem, as I&#39;ve yet to see a list of haste items and percentages posted by<br/>
a player that was correct. Not even the lineup of the items has been<br/>
correct.</div>
