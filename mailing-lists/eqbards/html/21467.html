<div id="ygrps-yiv-97649211">Because the purpose of the Sol ro Temple and it&#39;s quests was because of a series of complaints that with the removal of rubicite there was nothing of particular value at midlevel let alone anything for the specific classes between the 1-20 and the 45-50 planir stuff and had been admited so by Verant. <br/>
Granted no specific information was given about the weapon but all roads lead to Rome.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well as usuall absolutely nothing for bards other then perhaps trade<br/>
&gt; skills (cough cough) and maybe the weapon? Place your bets anyone REALLY<br/>
&gt; think we got a bard weapon? I bet the Lambent weapon isn&#39;t even in the game<br/>
&gt; yet and that&#39;s supposed to be mid level. &gt; &gt;Adon<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; umm, it&#39;s been posted a few times that it was just flavor for a possible<br/>
&gt; future quest. how does anyone know that it&#39;s &#39;&#39;supposed to be mid level&#39;&#39;<br/>
&gt; when no information about it exists because the quest does not exist. it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; been that way since the temple of solusek ro was opened.<br/>
