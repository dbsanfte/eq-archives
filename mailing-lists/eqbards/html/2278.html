&gt; Selos, SoW, SoC, Consonant Chain, Snare, Enstill, Grasping Roots etc,  all<br/>
&gt; cancel out like effects, first in, first out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would that it was first in first out. In reality though it seems to be<br/>
first in, reset to default on exit, leaving us with Selo&#39;s wearing off<br/>
cancelling SoW and, I recently discovered, SoW wearing off cancelling<br/>
Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
This seems like such a simple programming error to fix I&#39;m amazed it&#39;s<br/>
still not fixed as it was reported back in beta. The server already has<br/>
a variable set for the presence of SoW, hence when you zone your SoW is<br/>
active again, so a simple AND added to the test ( IF effect wears off<br/>
AND no other spell is active also modifying  THEN reset to default.<br/>
rather than the current IF effect wears off THEN reset to default) when<br/>
an effect wears off should be all it takes to fix the problem.<br/>
<br/>
This is also the case with other bard songs like Levitate and Water<br/>
Breathing, making people very annoyed when they move out of the bard<br/>
song&#39;s range and lose their spell effect as well. This effectively makes<br/>
these songs useless if you are actually in a group, as the area they<br/>
cover makes them too limited to actually rely on. What party in their<br/>
right mind would try to enter Kedge Keep relying just on the bard song,<br/>
and firing it up to help one party member who&#39;s enduring breath has worn<br/>
off would risk screwing up any other member who was in range of the<br/>
song. This has resulted in everyone I know camping for Fishbone Earrings<br/>
as no one wants to drown just because the Ranger or Druid in the party<br/>
died and hasnt got back, and the bard song is too dangerous to be a good<br/>
backup, which is what I would have thought it was intended to be.<br/>
<br/>
So as not to end on a completely negative note though, I have to say<br/>
weaving Selo&#39;s and Aria of Eagles and running across N Ro, Oasis, S Ro<br/>
is one of the funnest things I&#39;ve done in the game (though I&#39;m easily<br/>
amused) I like to run off the tops of the highest dunes I can find to<br/>
see how much air I can grab. Just make sure if either song accidently<br/>
wears of it&#39;s Selo&#39;s and not Aria. (Ouch)<br/>
