 </span></blockquote>I beg to differ, but I almost decided *not* to play a Bard when I found out<br/>
I couldn&#39;t be a Halfling.  This has been my biggest rant since day 1!  I&#39;m<br/>
incredibly disappointed that NO little people or evil race can be a Bard.<br/>
This should be fixed!!! Please?  *grins*<br/>
When I asked about it, all I was told is that there were no CURRENT plans<br/>
to change class/race limitations.<br/>
