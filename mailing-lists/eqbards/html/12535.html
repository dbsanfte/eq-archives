&gt; i just forgot) when dueling a paladin couple nights ago.  my question is,<br/>
&gt; since our fear is AE can you still fear a PC if you sing it near him and<br/>
&gt; just do not have him targetted?<br/>

(Both PC and NPC dots, from what I&#39;ve seen.)  However, if the dot kills them, the<br/>
duel will be &quot;canceled by their untimely death&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As to the fear question:  You won&#39;t get an answer out of me on that one, but...try it<br/>
out.. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just to let you all know, my RL best friend has a 36 Mage and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I dueled him<br/>
&gt; &gt; once for fun. You can imagine how pissed off I was when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; lost exp after<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fight. Why? You ask.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, his pet killed me, causing me to die from a NPC, which<br/>
&gt; &gt; also is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same as dieing via a normal mob. The duel was void and I lost<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1/2 bub exp<br/>
&gt; &gt; (this was back at level 29 or so, he was 31). So, I must stress, NEVER<br/>
&gt; &gt; fight a mage in a duel because if you die you can kiss<br/>
&gt; &gt; goodbye to your exp<br/>
&gt; &gt; (if the pet gets the last hit and kills you).<br/>
