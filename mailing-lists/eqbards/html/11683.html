<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910417646">How eactly does the DE illusion work now that you have to equip the Guise?<br/>
I see two options:<br/>
1)  When wearing the mask, you get the stat bonuses all the time plus the DE<br/>
illusion goes up as soon as you put it on.  DE illusion remains in effect<br/>
all the time as long as you are wearing mask.  <br/>
<br/>
2) When wearing the mask, you get the stat bonuses all the time but DE<br/>
illusion is not active.  Click on mask icon to activate the illusion.<br/>
Illusion remains in effect for a certain duration.  Duration wears off when<br/>
zoning.<br/>
<br/>
Based on everything I&#39;ve read, I think #2 is how it works but would just<br/>
like confirmation. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Response to many messages with this one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.	New drop is Mask of Deception. Exact same stats as the Guise (4ac<br/>
&gt; 13cha<br/>
&gt; 7mr NO DROP yadda yadda) Only new thing is that it must be equipped to<br/>
&gt; trigger the Illusion: Dark Elf effect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.	Someone mentioned about big ogres and trolls blocking hallways and<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; the Guise is perfect for taking care of this. From a utility standpoint,<br/>
&gt; yes<br/>
&gt; that is true, but that is about all there is to it. There is really no<br/>
&gt; sense<br/>
&gt; of why the Guise is used.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.	The RP sense of it all. I know I&#39;d raise my hand first when I say<br/>
&gt; that I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really consider what race a char is when I group with them. I did<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; I was level 6 but now it gets difficult to pick and choose who to group<br/>
&gt; with. If this were not the case and many people RP&#39;d racial reactions in<br/>
&gt; groups I&#39;d imagine that there would be a lot fewer dyed DE&#39;s and the ones<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d mostly see would be naturals. (Although the female DE form is rather<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; pleasant sight };)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.	Ever think of why a froglok assasin would have an item that would<br/>
&gt; change<br/>
&gt; them into a DE? The frogs are natural enemies to the Trolls and Ogres<br/>
&gt; (possibly the DE&#39;s too not sure). Mayhaps there was some subterranean plot<br/>
&gt; afoot to strike against the Tier&#39;Dal horde or evil races in general before<br/>
&gt; the frogs died? (This sorta falls apart if you consider the undead frogs<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; plotting against the evil races since they attack everyone...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5.	Personally I&#39;d prefer the thing to have the effect for as long as<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; have it on (not just from an annoying &#39;damn-the<br/>
&gt; effect-wore-off-gotta-right-click-it-again&#39;). If you want to be a DE then<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d slip the Mask on and the magic of it would change your form. Mostly<br/>
&gt; similar to what happens in the movie &#39;The Mask&#39;. Unfortunately the engine<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t seem to handle the illusion effect across zones(?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Good Journey<br/>
