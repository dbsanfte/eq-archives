8)&gt;You used to zone in and get mass slaughtered at the gate<br/>
8)until they took the<br/>
8)&gt;zone down that morning a few days ago and brought it right<br/>
8)back up.  after<br/>
8)&gt;this, zoning in has been safe.  we use the same tactics, and<br/>
8)fight in the<br/>
8)&gt;south spot first, then after clearing the area move down<br/>
8)west to a second<br/>
8)&gt;spot.  ranger, shaman, and paladin armor seems to be plentiful.<br/>
8)&gt;unfortunately bard armor is more rare.  we have yet to see a<br/>
8)BP, the only<br/>
8)&gt;piece left that i am dying for (have legs and boots).  we&#39;ve<br/>
8)gotten hit by<br/>
8)&gt;the glare lords but they are pretty easy with clerics<br/>
8)stunning them to<br/>
8)&gt;death.  and like you said, more than 3 mobs and we start<br/>
8)shouting GG.  3<br/>
8)&gt;mobs are very doable with a couple enchanters messing.<br/>
8)usually from the<br/>
8)&gt;south spot the boogeyman pull from the house is usually all<br/>
8)3.  and we have<br/>
8)&gt;yet to kill cazic because every time we pull him he crashes<br/>
8)the zone like<br/>
8)&gt;the samhains and boogeys sometimes do.  anyway, let me know<br/>
8)when you get<br/>
8)&gt;some more armor, unless its a BP cause i will be too jealous =P<br/>

8)Well last night was spectularly fun because we didnt have a<br/>
8)single zone<br/>
8)crash. This enabled us to clear almost everything in the zone<br/>
8)except for<br/>
8)Cazic himself and his three henchmen fright, terror, and dread. We had<br/>
8)killed all of his henchmen before and they hadnt dropped anything<br/>
8)interesting so we where thinking we would just rather ignore<br/>
8)them. At this<br/>
8)point we started getting cocky. Dracoliche was cake for us<br/>
8)and if another<br/>
8)server could kill cazic, well then we could to. So we<br/>
8)launched our assault<br/>
8)and imediatly cazic said something about his henchmen better<br/>
8)come over and<br/>
8)help him. At this point various profanties where uttered as<br/>
8)we realized our<br/>
8)fatal mistake, and sure enough fright, terror, and dread<br/>
8)showed up on the<br/>
8)spot just as we had cazic at half life. Luckily for us we had<br/>
8)several high<br/>
8)level magicancs and necros which set their pets on the<br/>
8)henchmen. With this<br/>
8)borrowed time we finished cazic and gated out with minimal<br/>
8)losses. Killing<br/>
8)him was about the same as the dracoliche except the three henchman.<br/>
8)Definatly need to take out the henchmen first before killing cazic :)<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Updated bestiary:<br/>
8)Phoboplasms are my new personal favorite, they can drop up to<br/>
8)TWO random<br/>
8)class specific items. Last night we killed around 8 of these<br/>
8)guys and TWO<br/>
8)dropped a bard bracer, along with a bunch of ranger and shaman stuff.<br/>
8)Cazic Thule : 8 platinum. Thats it. Good thing killing him<br/>
8)was so much fun<br/>
8)cause that was a big let down.<br/>
8)Nightmare&#39;s drop some silly piece of nightmare hide that can cancel<br/>
8)blindness. Woopydo.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Total bard pieces found have been 2 bracers, helmet, and<br/>
8)boots (which i<br/>
8)got) and arms and gloves which another bard got. No greaves<br/>
8)or breastplates<br/>
8)yet :(<br/>
