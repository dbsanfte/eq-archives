<br/>
Died 3 times last night and lost half the xp gained since going in there.<br/>
Chalk it up to learning how to fight there.<br/>
<br/>
First dedth: a bad pull early in the nite and we dint break off and run.<br/>
Stood there til we died heroically fighting too many mobs at one time but<br/>
still ded.  Memmed in Lullaby - AE or not we will see how it works here.  It<br/>
worked real well on the next couple multi-mob situations.  Now how to get<br/>
these 17,18,19 lev tanks to attack the same mob and not each try to fight<br/>
their own.  Even so I was nodding 3 ghouls and a lurking mummy while they<br/>
whacked down the 2 dry bones.<br/>
<br/>
Second dedth: a bad train bounced us as we were in combat - we were pulling<br/>
to the wall from the back room and a skel monk and his dbs pals got behind<br/>
us while we were fighting ghouls.  It happens - like a bad roll.  Gotta keep<br/>
watchin more.<br/>
<br/>
Third dedth: a bad idea.  Well, the Lullaby worked so well lets try Denon&#39;s<br/>
and a horn.  I bet I can stand here near the tunnel entrance (solo) and kill<br/>
off several dedth beetles while doing damage to dry and dark bones these<br/>
guys are pulling off trains.  Oh yeah looking real good - that skellie is<br/>
really in a world of hurt - I bet next tick or two and ill get the kill.<br/>
Hmm where is the next update? Am I lagging? wtf?? Only a sliver of hp???<br/>
