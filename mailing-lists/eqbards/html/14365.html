  I hate to keep talking about lower guk, but since that&#39;s where I <br/>
  was all last night, that experience is fresh in my mind.  (I hate<br/>
  lower guk big time, it&#39;s like a grown up version of greater fay,<br/>
  without any real &#39;growing up&#39;. hehe)<br/>
<br/>
  Tactician spawns, enchanter charms bok, sics bok on tactician.<br/>
  Paladin and I go start beating on the tact, and I begin to chain<br/>
  and chain and chain.  I must have sunk 20 chains on this frog,<br/>
  then he turns on me.  Cleric went to bed, so the Shaman was the<br/>
  healer.  This frog didn&#39;t miss me.  Every hit was 110+, and he<br/>
  double attacked like that for about 5 rounds on me.  I backed<br/>
  out and he was stuck on me like glue.  The shaman is yelling<br/>
  LoM, the enchanter is spent, and this paladin cannot taunt<br/>
  for poop.  The tactician was still half alive, and I was down<br/>
  to 2 bubbles.  Our dmg output (paladin, bok, and myself) was<br/>
  not going to kill this thing in time.<br/>
<br/>
  This is when the wheels start turning in your head.<br/>
  <br/>
  This is when your heart pushes blood to your brain.<br/>
 <br/>
  Arendaline, bloodrush, your skin tingles, your heartrate skyrockets.<br/>
<br/>
  &#39;What do you do?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  Dance around the throne!! lol, go poor pathing!  I kept chaining <br/>
  that frog and ran around the throne in the middle of the room over<br/>
  and over, until the bok and paladin brought it to quarter life, and<br/>
  then the shaman had enough mana to heal me.<br/>
<br/>
  Yet another weird, yet fun, night for me on EQ.<br/>
<br/>
  Breaking the king room with 6 people, and holding it with 4 people<br/>
  (minus any clerics or warriors for holding) was pretty intense and<br/>
  very exciting.<br/>
<br/>
