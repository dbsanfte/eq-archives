<div id="ygrps-yiv-474628637">Wow that seemed od to me friend.  I dueled my level 21 wizard friend when<br/>
I was level 19 and he was in serious trouble.  An initial cast knocked me<br/>
silly for about 1 bubble of hp, but beyond that the battle degenerated<br/>
into him trying to cast Fade and me slapping  him with a dragoon<br/>
dirk/combine rapier while singing the lullaby.  If I had an off-hand<br/>
weapon that alternated I probably would have done better then I actually<br/>
did.  So we can easily stand toe to toe with casters.  BTW my friend was<br/>
interrupted about 95% of the time between the lullaby and the smacking he<br/>
was getting.  Mind you this was a while ago and Verant may have been kind<br/>
enough to nerf us.  I have read a number of threads that claim bards are<br/>
too powerful and that we need x song and x ability removed.  Another case<br/>
of envy and lack of knowledge.  I don&#39;t know about all of you, but I have<br/>
never felt overly powerful just extremely useful =).<br/>

&gt; I dueled a level 17 wizard using this technique and it just plain didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work!  Granted, I was in an ingredible laggy zone, was experiencing a great<br/>
&gt; amount of packet loss, and the wizard was running around, slippery little<br/>
&gt; bugger (half the time I&#39;d see him standing one place when in reality my<br/>
&gt; client was wrong and he was somewhere else).  But still, embarassing to be<br/>
&gt; bested by one a few levels bellow me.  I&#39;d never use Lullaby for this<br/>
&gt; purpose again, I didn&#39;t see him interupted once when I reviewed the text.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe Lullaby would be more useful for this purpose with a shorter period<br/>
&gt; between pulses.  Come to think of it, Mellifluos Motion might actually serve </span></blockquote></div>
