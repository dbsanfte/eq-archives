<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785733596">One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a vein in my<br/>
forehead.<br/>
It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed Bolster Belt.<br/>
This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste effect. The<br/>
question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>
abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>
had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>
(Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>
would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>
a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>
