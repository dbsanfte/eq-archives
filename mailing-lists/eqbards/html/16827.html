<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] A very good weekend! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734211103">I went from level 7 to level 10...not bad I dare say..:)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, after joining a derv group in N ro, I quickly began to notice that<br/>
if I sing songs while someone is pulling that the mob will aggro on me<br/>
instead.<br/>
<br/>
Also, during the fight the mobs would decide that I was a better target<br/>
quite frequently.<br/>
<br/>
I would weave between the jig ( lev 3 ), the heal song, and the whitle<br/>
warsong one...<br/>
also I would attack with my dragoon dirk.  Our tank was a level 9 Paladin<br/>
who<br/>
was kind of irritating because he seemed to accidentally loot out of turn a<br/>
lot..:P<br/>
Plus he would say silly things like how &quot;pimp&quot; the soul fire looks..etc..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I dont know if it was his lousy taunt or if bard songs ultra aggro<br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
How about some group tactics for bards lessons?<br/>
<br/>
Any hints will make me very happy..:)<br/>
