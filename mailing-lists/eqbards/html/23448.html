<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055134116">No doubt they figured they had several months to fix it.  I&#39;m sure their<br/>
response was along the same lines as previous ones. &quot;What are you guys doing<br/>
in here?  You shouldn&#39;t be in here for six months yet!?!&quot;  Why is it they<br/>
continually fail to recognize that players will come up with faster ways to<br/>
do things than they did?  Why do they create a situation where you are<br/>
supposed to pick a side, yet make one side so wholly more beneficial to join<br/>
that hardly anyone will choose the opposing side?  As Sylly said, they<br/>
continually fail to understand why people play their game.  It boggles the<br/>
mind the decisions they make.<br/>

Ah, My bad. figures that they did it over the weekend.=P<br/>
ah well, at least they fixed the problems with it that were seen on test<br/>

Alice - &quot;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to walk from here?&quot;<br/>
Cheshire Cat - &quot;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.&quot;<br/>
Alice - &quot;I don&#39;t much care where.&quot;<br/>
Cheshire Cat - &quot;Then it doesn&#39;t matter which way you walk.&quot;<br/>
Alice - &quot;So long as I get somewhere.&quot;<br/>
Cheshire Cat - &quot;Oh, you&#39;re sure to do that, if you only walk long enough!&quot;<br/>

On a side note, Ester the Tester says the Sleeper Tomb key is NOT supposed<br/>
to be soulbound.  So how are you supposed to get back inside if you die?<br/>

I think you might be referring to the dragon statue in Eastern Wastes.  If<br/>
so that is the zone entrance to the Sleeper Tomb dungeon.  AFAIK, only Fires<br/>
of Heaven has figured out how to get the key to enter this dungeon.<br/>

Perhaps 47 is too low for Seb and Chardok, but it definately isn&#39;t too low<br/>
for Karnors.  I  zipped right thru 46-50 hanging out primarily in Karnors.<br/>
If you are lower than 50, probably a good idea to stick to the zone, moat<br/>
corners and tower.  Going in any deeper is risky unless everyone else is<br/>
50+.<br/>

Sorry, imho, 47 is &quot;too low&quot; for Karnors, Seb and Chardok. I would say 50 is<br/>
too low.  Get 51 before emabarking on what is going to be a long career in<br/>
these places. You won&#39;t have those resists.  Yes, you can go there and yes,<br/>
you can do some stuff but don&#39;t be surprized if others are picked to join<br/>
groups before you.  It has nothing to do with player skill, very little to<br/>
do with class specific issues.  It&#39;s purely a level thing.<br/>

no kidding, like me yesterday was getting wailed by a cleric that i wasnt<br/>
high enough to be in karnors. Yet i was outdamaging the tanks (or<br/>
overtaunting).  To me that means that maybe i wasnt too low to be there,<br/>
after all i was crowd control as well and other then a bad streak of resists<br/>
compared to usual i was doing just fine...  But i dont like taking hits<br/>
either, we&#39;re not ment to be first line of defense, we&#39;re more like air<br/>

You won&#39;t get into a group in Sebelis at 47.  I couldn&#39;t at 49.  Chardok is<br/>
very underused and getting a pickup group there is normally unlikely at best<br/>
at any level.  Karnor is difficult - but in the right group - you might be<br/>
okay.   I did the Dog tower at about that level.  They had a really good<br/>
group with cleric and enchanter - and basically told me to stand back and be<br/>
careful what I sang to not agro the mobs enough to become a target.<br/>
<br/>
	Again - I think your odds of getting a pickup group are low - and it<br/>
will<br/>
be risky.  However if you have a pre-made group that wants you - rock on -<br/>
and hope for the best!<br/>

Sorry, imho, 47 is &quot;too low&quot; for Karnors, Seb and Chardok. I would say 50 is<br/>
too low.  Get 51 before emabarking on what is going to be a long career in<br/>
these places. You won&#39;t have those resists.  Yes, you can go there and yes,<br/>
you can do some stuff but don&#39;t be surprized if others are picked to join<br/>

I believe the real reason Mino Horns are wind is power balance.  To give a<br/>
lvl 18 (with Denons) a magic horn would be very powerful.  I found 18-25<br/>
comically easy levels using merel store bought insturments and bronze/banded<br/>
armor.  If I had an extra 15% on DDD, it would be too much...<br/>

I would not go to seb or chardok before 51 for sure...  But karnors stuff<br/>
starts getting blue at 43-44, 45 is fine, I actually went in now and then at<br/>
40.  mind you at 45 when i was there i got my partisan from a moat group.<br/>
All my SS was given to me by friends, i have yet to see any drop.  Live<br/>
captain is a fun fun camp, fast paced and great xp.  Got a blackjack<br/>
(raising 1hb slowly now and then)<br/>
<br/>
Hell the way i look at it, if i can by chance win a jade mace in cap group,<br/>
it will be well worth going to karnors. I have to get rid of that damn yak<br/>

pickups are easy in karnors, i enter do a lfg and get 2-3 tells right away<br/>
80% of the time, if no takers i go outside to ridge, either way this is the<br/>
area that is best for me to get pickup groups early in the morning before<br/>
going to work and getting good xp since im not on for very long.<br/>

IIRC, the only way anyone figured out how to complete the original Fiery<br/>
Avenger quest was when a Guide/GM &quot;leaked&quot; the information directly to a<br/>
player (someone in Fires of Heaven).  I remember reading a post on the<br/>
Whineplay forum a long time ago that stated this.  So I don&#39;t know if its<br/>
actually true or not.  If it is true, I wonder if this is how the secret of<br/>
entering PoM will be discovered as well?<br/>

Subject: Make way for the newbie!<br/>
<br/>
Hi all.  This is my first posting here (the group was suggested to me<br/>
on innoruuk.com) so please be kind.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am new to both EQ and being a bard so bear with me.  First of all I<br/>
love my bard!  I initially started a shaman on my boyfriend&#39;s<br/>
suggestion and, while I did like her, she just didn&#39;t have that<br/>
certain something that my bard does.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten her up to level 10 and I&#39;m wondering about musical<br/>
soloing.  Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and<br/>
singing.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with<br/>
instruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out<br/>
using chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>
to kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>
do I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>
and strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>

<br/>
Well first off you didn&#39;t say what level your own character was.  He has to<br/>
be high enough level to get EXP when grouped with a level 53.  Off the top<br/>
of my head, I don&#39;t know what the minimum level required to get EXP when<br/>
grouped with a level 53 is.  I would guess you have to be at least in your<br/>
40s.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you are high enough level, your % split of EXP would be X/X+53.<br/>
This is the base EXP amount you receive.  The group bonus, class bonus, and<br/>
zone bonus get added to the base value to determine total EXP received per<br/>
kill.<br/>
<br/>
Under the new system, lower level characters get a higher % split of EXP<br/>
when grouping with higher level character than they did under the old<br/>
system.  I have actually been in a group that did not want to add someone<br/>
lower level because the person would steal EXP from them.  This person was<br/>
probably one of those that didn&#39;t want to group with hybrids prior to the<br/>
new system for the same stupid reason.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greeting everyone I have a question on a technique called &quot;Drafting&quot;.  My<br/>
regular group of friends I group with don&#39;t want me to fall to far behind on<br/>
xp<br/>
while I am out for my son&#39;s impending birth (my wife would kill me if I<br/>
attempt<br/>
to play for the first month).<br/>
<br/>
I was told that with the new xp changes that you can group with a higher<br/>
level<br/>
player in my case a 53 shaman whose toons I group with would take my bard<br/>
and<br/>
group. He would then procedd to solo mobs and let me get the xp.<br/>
<br/>
The figures I saw (in an email) says the lower level character could &quot;draft&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
ride the xp off of the higher level shaman.  They are estimating the lower<br/>
level<br/>
would get about 40% of the xp from such a scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions on powerleviling and recent discussion on mediocre players aside (I<br/>
have played EQ since it came out and have several characters in the 20&#39;s and<br/>
30&#39;s) would this form of powerleveling be an option? Or is the math wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>

Since the exp needed to level goes up by the cube of the level,<br/>
but exp gained per mob is split linearly by level (in the new system)<br/>
then the lower level partner gets more exp *RELATIVE* to the<br/>
exp he needs to level than the higher level, thus &quot;drafting&quot; and<br/>
catching up.  This also means that, although characters now have<br/>
to pay their own racial exp penalty, there is a limit to how far they<br/>
will fall behind a regular grouping partner<br/>
<br/>
Unless I bungled the math it&#39;s something like<br/>
H = Human level<br/>
N = Non-Human level<br/>
R = Racial modifier for Non-Human<br/>
<br/>
If H^2/N^2 &gt;= R then the Non-Human<br/>
stops falling behind.<br/>

Hehe when I was 46, I was running thru EC and saw someone selling SS gloves<br/>
for 1K.  I didn&#39;t have any SS pieces at the time so decided to buy them.<br/>
Later on that day I went to Karnor&#39;s for the first time.  Within 15 minutes<br/>
of entering the zone, SS gloves dropped off a dog that my group killed.  I<br/>
kicked myself in the butt for not having the patience to wait and loot the<br/>
piece for myself.  BTW Karnor&#39;s has been my main hangout since 46.  Since<br/>
that one incident where the SS gloves dropped 15 minutes into the camp, I<br/>
have not seen one piece drop.<br/>

Stops=partials right.  Agreed only brass instruments have them, that&#39;s what<br/>
I said ;-)<br/>
Simple woodwinds have no reeds.  The hunting horn I have really isn&#39;t an<br/>
instrument at all to be honest, but it is the vibrations created inside the<br/>
horn that make the sound you hear.  The different shapes of individual horns<br/>
affects the sounds heard.<br/>

<br/>
That is not correct.  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; - if you mean<br/>
&quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments have partials.<br/>
Regardless, the determination of instrument types is by how the sound itself<br/>
is generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips vibration creates<br/>
the sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child - a big day<br/>
for me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>
Shofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>
<br/>
On a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>
instrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the exception of the<br/>
flute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations caused by the<br/>
wind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>
<br/>
	A saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind<br/>
instrument.<br/>
<br/>
As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a brass player - we<br/>
are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies the sound.<br/>
This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search of a good<br/>
reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get one or two in a<br/>
box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>

Actually it is more correct for it to be a wind instrument.  Brass<br/>

<br/>
Well first off you didn&#39;t say what level your own character was.  He has to<br/>
be high enough level to get EXP when grouped with a level 53.  Off the top<br/>
of my head, I don&#39;t know what the minimum level required to get EXP when<br/>
grouped with a level 53 is.  I would guess you have to be at least in your<br/>
40s.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you are high enough level, your % split of EXP would be X/X+53.<br/>
This is the base EXP amount you receive.  The group bonus, class bonus, and<br/>
zone bonus get added to the base value to determine total EXP received per<br/>
kill.<br/>
<br/>
Under the new system, lower level characters get a higher % split of EXP<br/>
when grouping with higher level character than they did under the old<br/>
system.  I have actually been in a group that did not want to add someone<br/>
lower level because the person would steal EXP from them.  This person was<br/>
probably one of those that didn&#39;t want to group with hybrids prior to the<br/>
new system for the same stupid reason.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greeting everyone I have a question on a technique called &quot;Drafting&quot;.  My<br/>
regular group of friends I group with don&#39;t want me to fall to far behind on<br/>
xp<br/>
while I am out for my son&#39;s impending birth (my wife would kill me if I<br/>
attempt<br/>
to play for the first month).<br/>
<br/>
I was told that with the new xp changes that you can group with a higher<br/>
level<br/>
player in my case a 53 shaman whose toons I group with would take my bard<br/>
and<br/>
group. He would then procedd to solo mobs and let me get the xp.<br/>
<br/>
The figures I saw (in an email) says the lower level character could &quot;draft&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
ride the xp off of the higher level shaman.  They are estimating the lower<br/>
level<br/>
would get about 40% of the xp from such a scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions on powerleviling and recent discussion on mediocre players aside (I<br/>
have played EQ since it came out and have several characters in the 20&#39;s and<br/>
30&#39;s) would this form of powerleveling be an option? Or is the math wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>

I didn&#39;t start using instruments to solo until after 18. Then you have two<br/>
songs<br/>
(Chords and Disssonance?) that are AE DOT&#39;s that you can use with Hym and do<br/>
more damage for weapons and you can take on a couple of mobs at the same<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Now at 34 I switch from instruments to weapons depending on the group make<br/>
up.<br/>

Hi all.  This is my first posting here (the group was suggested to me<br/>
on innoruuk.com) so please be kind.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am new to both EQ and being a bard so bear with me.  First of all I<br/>
love my bard!  I initially started a shaman on my boyfriend&#39;s<br/>
suggestion and, while I did like her, she just didn&#39;t have that<br/>
certain something that my bard does.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten her up to level 10 and I&#39;m wondering about musical<br/>
soloing.  Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and<br/>
singing.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with<br/>
instruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out<br/>
using chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>
to kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>
do I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>
and strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>

Bah!  I&#39;m the list newbie and refuse to give up the title!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
At level 10 I wouldn&#39;t advise all-instruments.  At level 12, try Hymn, CoD,<br/>
and Bellow with a mandolin.  It took me a while before this became a more<br/>
lethal combo than Hymn, Warsong, and CoD, but by level 13 it&#39;s a very safe<br/>
way to solo and much, much, much more effective against multiple mobs.<br/>
<br/>
I was soloing two or three blue mobs at a time just recently and found I<br/>
could start a battle at 3 and a half bubbles of health and end the battle<br/>
at nearly full health.<br/>

Subject: Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>
<br/>
Was wondering if there is any way for a bard to serve as main puller in PoG<br/>
without taking a negative Tunare faction hit? From what I have read, a lot<br/>
of folks are using non-KOS players to serve as scouts in PoG in order to<br/>
lead the puller to the next mob. If there was some way for us to remain<br/>
non-KOS while pulling, think this could be a lot of fun since we could both<br/>
scout and pull.<br/>
I was thinking that one possibility is for an enchanter to cast mem blur on<br/>
the mob as you pulled it back to the camp. Another option would be for the<br/>
bard to camp as soon as he dropped the mob off at the camp. This would work<br/>
assuming you can camp out before the raid members killed the mob. Anyone<br/>
know if these two options will work? Any other options?<br/>
In every major raid I have attended, I almost always end up playing mana<br/>
battery or resist buffer. This is all fine and dandy, but getting to be main<br/>
scout/puller for a major raid sounds like it would be a lot of fun.<br/>

I meant Karnor might be difficult for a 47 Bard.  At 52 - I can get a pickup<br/>
almost immediately.  On Xegony it&#39;s the easiest zone on the server for me to<br/>
get into a group.  People there realize a Bard can handle CC - much less so<br/>
has been my experience in Sebelis.  And as I mentioned - on Xegony - pickups<br/>
are next to impossible on Chardok due to under use.<br/>

pickups are easy in karnors, i enter do a lfg and get 2-3 tells right away<br/>
80% of the time, if no takers i go outside to ridge, either way this is the<br/>
area that is best for me to get pickup groups early in the morning before<br/>
going to work and getting good xp since im not on for very long.<br/>

Welcome to our little community!  Feel free to ask questions and to jump in<br/>
at anytime.<br/>
<br/>
To answer your question, instrument soloing isn&#39;t typically done until you<br/>
get Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord at level 18.  At that point, you can do a<br/>
three song twist of DDD, HoR, and CoD with the appropriate instruments for<br/>
more raw damage output with healing than a typical untwinked bard can do<br/>
with weapons.<br/>

&gt;As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a brass player -<br/>
we<br/>
&gt;are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies the sound.<br/>
&gt;This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search of a good<br/>
&gt;reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get one or two in a<br/>
&gt;box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>
<br/>
You should have said most &quot;good&quot; sax/clarinet players. I played clarinet a<br/>
long time ago and was just happy if the reed wasn&#39;t split or moldy. And to<br/>
think I used to have to suck on those things, ewww.<br/>
I was referring to my buddies - all professionals...<br/>

&gt;Read your comment wrong about stops - but you are still wrong on hunting<br/>
&gt;horns.  The Sound is made by &quot;Buzzing&quot; the brass method and they do have<br/>
&gt;partials - they are harder to make but there (I&#39;ve tried them out).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The determining factor - for flutes and early winds - the vibration is the<br/>
&gt;resistance of the air crossing a blow hole.  The hunting horns are NOT<br/>
&gt;played that way.  The shape of the horn is NOT an issue for determining how<br/>
&gt;the sound is created, only altered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Slyde<br/>
<br/>
All brass instruments are technically wind instruments, since it requires<br/>
wind to make the sound, as any string player. :-)<br/>
The correct term is certainly &quot;Woodwind&quot; - most EQ&#39;ers assume Verant meant<br/>
&quot;Woodwind&quot; when they said wind..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve assumed all &quot;wind&quot; instruments should be woodwinds (flutes,<br/>
fifes) and &quot;brass&quot; would have been the various horns found in the world as<br/>
I agree with Slyde about the way the sound is created with the instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Seems Verant is taking the word &quot;brass&quot; literally as meaning any instrument<br/>
actually made of brass. Anything else is a &quot;wind&quot;. I would have thought<br/>
that all &quot;brass&quot; should have been anything using that particular mouthpiece<br/>
while &quot;wind&quot; would have been any type of &quot;woodwind&quot; instrument (flutes,<br/>
clarinets, saxophones, etc).<br/>
<br/>
What I really want to know is when we get our battle sousaphone! Woot! Tuba<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure the best way to taunt a mob off of anyone, when charm fails,<br/>
is using triple chant.. And if that bugger isn&#39;t rooted or snared, you can<br/>
bet the farm he&#39;ll be up in your doodoo. Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine alone did the<br/>
trick, and at L52 with selos&#39; drum, I figured it to be around 126/tick<br/>
(provided no resists throughout.) (don&#39;t know if the numbers are different<br/>
on a mob than a PC, i tested it on myself)<br/>

Why can you not camp once the mob is off you? surely you can&#39;t take a<br/>
faction hit if you&#39;re not logged on? Pulling in PoG is a breeze when you<br/>
have lightning speed. In my experience, many things have SoW or better, and<br/>
the bard will have the best time making it back to the ambush unharmed (or<br/>
dead).<br/>
<br/>
Also.. I seem to remember very few times at all that i&#39;ve been either snared<br/>
or rooted while playing Selo&#39;s.  I don&#39;t remember actuallly being able to<br/>
*break* them when firing up the song though.  Since this last &quot;fix,&quot; what<br/>
has everyone discovered? Can you still be immune to movement hindrances such<br/>
as these, or can you be caught mid-stride with a root or snare from a long<br/>
distance caster?<br/>

Bah!  I&#39;m the list newbie and refuse to give up the title!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
At level 10 I wouldn&#39;t advise all-instruments.  At level 12, try Hymn, CoD,<br/>
and Bellow with a mandolin.  It took me a while before this became a more<br/>
lethal combo than Hymn, Warsong, and CoD, but by level 13 it&#39;s a very safe<br/>
way to solo and much, much, much more effective against multiple mobs.<br/>

I was soloing two or three blue mobs at a time just recently and found I<br/>
could start a battle at 3 and a half bubbles of health and end the battle<br/>
at nearly full health.<br/>

Hi all.  This is my first posting here (the group was suggested to me<br/>
on innoruuk.com) so please be kind.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am new to both EQ and being a bard so bear with me.  First of all I<br/>
love my bard!  I initially started a shaman on my boyfriend&#39;s<br/>
suggestion and, while I did like her, she just didn&#39;t have that<br/>
certain something that my bard does.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten her up to level 10 and I&#39;m wondering about musical<br/>
soloing.  Right now I have soloed mainly with my weapon damage and<br/>
singing.  But I have read a few posts about bards soloing with<br/>
instruments only and that it is very effective.  I did try it out<br/>
using chords of dissodance and selo&#39;s but it seemed to take forever<br/>
to kill something that I could kill much faster with my weapons.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is...how viable is soloing with just instruments and<br/>
do I just not have the effective offensive song yet for doing so?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all and if you see Brhianna on Innoruuk running for her life<br/>
and strumming her lute madly wave hello!<br/>

&gt; Stops=partials right.  Agreed only brass instruments have<br/>
&gt; them, that&#39;s what<br/>
&gt; I said ;-)<br/>
&gt; Simple woodwinds have no reeds.  The hunting horn I have<br/>
&gt; really isn&#39;t an<br/>
&gt; instrument at all to be honest, but it is the vibrations<br/>
&gt; created inside the<br/>
&gt; horn that make the sound you hear.  The different shapes of<br/>
&gt; individual horns<br/>
&gt; affects the sounds heard.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is not correct.  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;stops&quot; -<br/>
&gt; if you mean<br/>
&gt; &quot;Partials&quot; you have it backwards - only brass instruments<br/>
&gt; have partials.<br/>
&gt; Regardless, the determination of instrument types is by how<br/>
&gt; the sound itself<br/>
&gt; is generated.  For brass instruments - the players lips<br/>
&gt; vibration creates<br/>
&gt; the sound.  This is how you play a Shofar (when I was a child<br/>
&gt; - a big day<br/>
&gt; for me was when for the first time I beat the Rabbi&#39;s son in a<br/>
&gt; Shofar-blowing competition - after I started taking trombone lessons).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a woodwind instrument - the sound is created by some part of the<br/>
&gt; instrument vibrating.  On modern instruments - with the<br/>
&gt; exception of the<br/>
&gt; flute this would be a reed (for a flute it&#39;s the vibrations<br/>
&gt; caused by the<br/>
&gt; wind crossing its mouthpiece<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	A saxophone - for example - while made of brass is a woodwind<br/>
&gt; instrument.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I have been taught (by some very good teachers) - for a<br/>
&gt; brass player - we<br/>
&gt; are creating the sound itself.  The instrument only amplifies<br/>
&gt; the sound.<br/>
&gt; This is a good thing - because we&#39;re not constantly in search<br/>
&gt; of a good<br/>
&gt; reed.  Most sax/clarinet players will tell you if they get<br/>
&gt; one or two in a<br/>
&gt; box of 20 - they are happy.<br/>

You really cant solo with insturments till 18 when you got Denon&#39;s.  If you<br/>
are not twinked, grouping from levels 10-18 is your best bet.  Twinked, you<br/>
could easily handle those levels on your own...<br/>

Eh? no ...<br/>
<br/>
I could easily do 1-3 wisps with Bellows/Chords/Hymm ... 1-2 without<br/>
bellows.  Nice on a newbie too since Hymm and Chords are both string.  If<br/>
you need a break .. have Selo&#39;s up and kite a sec with heal/selo but usually<br/>
you won&#39;t need to.  Have a the lute to drum hotkey setup - and you should<br/>
always make zone if you need to bail out.   Spiders (have to sit to outheal<br/>
the poison so bad) and YKs (hit harder than the wisps) are a no-no.<br/>
Skellies Bad too (stun). Got a few looks to be sure .. but it worked!  Great<br/>
for pp too at those levels - which if untwinked is also something to<br/>
consider.<br/>
