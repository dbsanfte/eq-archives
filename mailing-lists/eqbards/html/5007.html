<div id="ygrps-yiv-119289091">I know a little bit about the two skills you mentioned as I have<br/>
dabbled in both. Here&#39;s what I know.<br/>
<br/>
Tailoring: As a tailor, you can only make things using Bear, Cat, and<br/>
Wolf pelts. There are other pelts in the game that armor can be made<br/>
from, but only by NPCs. (Example, there is an NPC who makes armor from<br/>
HQ Lion Pelts.)<br/>
<br/>
Baking: A spit IS a portable oven. I haven&#39;t found anything that could<br/>
be made in the oven, but couldn&#39;t be made in the spit. Not every kind<br/>
of meat can be combined with bread to make sandwiches. I know rat meat,<br/>
and I think mammoth (not sure about that one). I took up this trade<br/>
recently because it is a lot of fun. I suggest buying the books. They<br/>
make me laugh. I just bought the ones that tell you how to make food<br/>
out of dwarf meat and gnome meat and such. They are supposedly written<br/>
by an ogre or a troll. They are pretty funny. Anyway, if you don&#39;t want<br/>
to buy the books, EQVault has a guide that tells you the combinations<br/>
that make the food. I&#39;m not sure how updated it is, but it seems to be<br/>
right. Now, if anyone can tell me if thereis any significance to the<br/>
part of the book that tells you what each dish goes well with, I would<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
