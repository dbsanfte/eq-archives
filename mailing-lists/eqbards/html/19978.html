<div id="ygrps-yiv-397237405">So, for the younger bards reading this, take your time and play the way you<br/>
like.  There is a lot of fun out there.  Only when you join the quest for<br/>
exp race and leet loots, remember to smell the roses too.  All you have to<br/>
do to get to level 50 is kill 1,210,314 moss snakes, skellies, aviaks,<br/>
pickclaws, froogs, kobolds, specs, etc, etc, etc.  It&#39;s a long haul but<br/>
eventually you get there.<br/>
<br/>
- You don&#39;t have to worry about me Sylly :)  Before EQ I was a avid mudder.<br/>
Played for years!  On one mud the level structure was this: 50 mortal<br/>
levels, 999 hero levels, 999 lord levels.  At the time my pfile got messed<br/>
up by the Imp and not reinstated correctly I had the highest mortal thief in<br/>
the game and also the highest mortal halfling in the game.  Level 200+ lord.<br/>
I left that game almost two years ago now and the highest lords are about<br/>
level 500...<br/>
<br/>
I RP where I can.  But no not everyone wants to RP.  I took a day - a whole<br/>
day! - and walked around Antonica with a high level bard.  No Selos no run<br/>
just walk.  And it was FUN! During the week most of my levleing is done<br/>
because my play time is so different (Australia).  But the weekends I have<br/>
my fun...</div>
