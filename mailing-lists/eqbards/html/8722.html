If a mob hits for D points on average, and you have H hp, and<br/>
the damage shield does S damage per hit, then the damage<br/>
shield will do S*(H/D) points damage over the fight.  If the<br/>
mobs average N hits per song round (3-4 sec for most bards),<br/>
and Bellow does B damage on average (including resists),<br/>
Bellow will do (B/3N)*(H/D) points damage.  Divide to remove<br/>
the common factor and you end up with:<br/>
<br/>
If B &gt; 3S*N then it makes more sense to use Bellow.  You can<br/>
figure out B and N with all the nifty new log parsers, S you<br/>
can tell from the messages when you&#39;re fighting.  This will<br/>
work for multiple mob encounters too, just add up all the mob<br/>
hits when determining N.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
e.g. if your Bellow does 12 points on average, the mobs<br/>
average 1 hit per round, and the damage shield does 5 points<br/>
per hit, then:<br/>
<br/>
12 &gt; 3*5*1<br/>
<br/>
which is false, so in this case, it&#39;d be better to use Psalm.<br/>
