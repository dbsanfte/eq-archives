&gt; &gt; try to make sure they&#39;re all under the effect of Accelerando<br/>
&gt; &gt; as they try to run away.  Usually everyone ends up running in<br/>

&gt; Are you serious about this?  You can&#39;t be.<br/>

twice.<br/>

doesn&#39;t.  You type &#39;SG&#39; and have a split second to react<br/>
before it starts to tear into your party.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At L10 people should have over 200 hp.  That&#39;ll survive two<br/>
hits from a SG minimum.  Sometimes you get unlucky and get<br/>
hit by a double attack.  But usually, that&#39;s enough to keep<br/>
the SG busy for 2, sometimes 3 or 4 rounds killing the first<br/>
person.<br/>

&gt; will die&#39;.  Given the amount of time it takes to physically turn<br/>
&gt; and run, equip instruments and fire up songs, you have LITTLE<br/>
&gt; chance of survival at L10.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have seen an SG coming, equipped my drum and fired up accelerando,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe I&#39;m more careful.  When I see one approaching from the<br/>
distance, I switch to a drum and start Accelerando.<br/>
