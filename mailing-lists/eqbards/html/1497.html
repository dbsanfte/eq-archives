doesn&#39;t.  You type &#39;SG&#39; and have a split second to react<br/>
before it starts to tear into your party.<br/>

hits from a SG minimum.  Sometimes you get unlucky and get<br/>
hit by a double attack.  But usually, that&#39;s enough to keep<br/>
the SG busy for 2, sometimes 3 or 4 rounds killing the first<br/>
person.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe I&#39;m more careful.  When I see one approaching from the<br/>
distance, I switch to a drum and start Accelerando.<br/>
