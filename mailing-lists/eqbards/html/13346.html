<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457299476">The part where you discussed bards are a &quot;not a&quot;class depending on the<br/>
situation.  Kitasi raised a similar point earlier on this issue when he<br/>
posted about new quests added in the recent patch for hybrids.  Apparently<br/>
bards were considered &quot;not a&quot; hybrid class this time around.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good post.  Did you include this as part of your post to GZ for<br/>
&gt; inclusion in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the next ArchMage Answers message?  I&#39;d like to see what he has to say<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of the issues you raised.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which part?<br/>
