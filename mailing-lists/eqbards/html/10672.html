<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140518837">Preach on!  I have the same weapons I had in what, June I think.  5months,<br/>
with no upgrade in sight.  I lose half a stamina bar in a fight with two<br/>
blues now, if I used a PGT I&#39;d fall over.  I&#39;d use a BLW if I could stand<br/>
walking around with a pool rack, or listening to that never ending crack, or<br/>
if it really was a good deal better than my dirk, but I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t, and<br/>
it isn&#39;t.  I have to date done 3 armor quests on my own without help except<br/>
for being in an experience gaining group and non of them were bard quests.<br/>
The crafted quests and totemic quests are far easier.  Heck, one of the<br/>
cleric quests merely requires sitting around and travelling.  I really<br/>
should do that one now that I think of it our cleric needs better armor.  I<br/>
have obtained 5 different weapons from quests, plus one more I cannot<br/>
remember, that bards could not use.  Didn&#39;t know that when I started though,<br/>
just kept hoping each time that this one would be different.  I have all<br/>
magic armor now of various sorts, mostly from selling those weapons I could<br/>
not use, so at least weight is no longer a great struggle.  With each patch<br/>
I hope we will someday get a weapon quest we can use, other than that<br/>
special bardic one in ToSR.  No doubt that will require we kill a dragon or<br/>
some equally ridiculous critter.<br/>

I will have to agree on items available for bards at 20th level or so. I<br/>
would love to get rid of my Barbed Leather Whip, but to replace it with<br/>
what? If I could dual wield PGTs, that would be good, but they are still<br/>
relatively slow, heavy, and only do 6 damage. The only viable replacements<br/>
that I know of are way too expensive/hard to get. (Kilij, Crystalline Blade,<br/>
Runed Falchion, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The same goes for armor. I have been wearing bronze for quite awhile, and it<br/>
is a strain for this little wood elf, but to upgrade to steel is cost<br/>
prohibitive, and lambent is way too hard for me, yet.<br/>
<br/>
So, I have had basically the same equipment for months, and with nothing to<br/>
look forward to for another few months.   *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
If I am overlooking something, I would love to hear about it. I would dearly<br/>
love a quest that was long and arduous but possible for me to accomplish,<br/>
that would result in a nice weapon or magic instrument. <br/>
<br/>
And speaking of instruments, if there were some better instruments around,<br/>
maybe I wouldn&#39;t have to rely on my poor melee skills so much. I would love<br/>
to sit back and play songs during melee, as I don&#39;t have the HPs to really<br/>
mix it up anymore anyway, but it&#39;s just not quite enough for me as I don&#39;t<br/>
seem to be able to weave 4 songs at once.<br/>
<br/>
And all these balance issues, while significant, don&#39;t take into account<br/>
twinking, which is the biggest unbalancing factor, I think. Of course, with<br/>
the scarcity of attainable items and the game bias against those of us who<br/>
prefer to solo, I can see why eBay sales are so brisk.<br/>

Brian&#39;s post is interesting, but I&#39;m not sure it is all that accurate.<br/>
Perhaps this is accurately what Verant wants to be true, but it is not<br/>
what<br/>
is true.  Monks out damage warriors only until the warrior gains some<br/>
good<br/>
weapons around 15th level or so.  After that the warrior often out<br/>
damages<br/>
the monk, but the monk takes less damage.  The reason for this?  The<br/>
monk<br/>
having no offensive items to spend money on is free to spend all his<br/>
funds<br/>
to acquire better defensive items.  The two do seem to balance out with<br/>
the<br/>
warrior doing more damage but the monk taking less.  Despite not being<br/>
able<br/>
to wear heavy armor our group monk who is 2 levels lower than me has<br/>
nearly<br/>
the same ac I do, and I have only one piece of armor with an AC below<br/>
banded<br/>
and several at plate or higher.  He takes way less damage than I do and<br/>
until he is 35th level will probably never die again except in very rare<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest laugh was at Brian&#39;s mention of Bard only items.  That&#39;s a<br/>
good<br/>
one.  Excepting the quest armor, there are what, two bard only items<br/>
that<br/>
you can get without taking on a dragon or going to the planes?  A Shawl<br/>
of<br/>
the Wind Spirit and Mistmoore Battle Drums, that&#39;s it as far as I know.<br/>
A<br/>
piece of armor equal to cloth and a drum on a 35+ mob.  To even mention<br/>
bard<br/>
only items was in my opinion a slap in the face.  Considering one is<br/>
useless<br/>
after 3rd level and the other sells for 500pp+ that&#39;s a joke.  What<br/>
other<br/>
class has so little equipment dedicated to it?  There must be one but I<br/>
don&#39;t know what it would be.  Are there even any other items on mobs<br/>
below<br/>
30th that are bard plus a few others?  Shimmering Orb, great for looks<br/>
but<br/>
with dual wield is it useful?  Anyone know of anything else?<br/>
<br/>
My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items,<br/>
why<br/>
is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th<br/>
level?<br/>
There really isn&#39;t anything much better than my dragoon dirk and<br/>
screaming<br/>
mace available for bards at my level.  The only 1HS weapons available<br/>
are a<br/>
Polished Granite Tomahawk and a Barbed Leather Whip.  They don&#39;t even<br/>
begin<br/>
to compare to our Shadowknight&#39;s Dark Reaver.  The primary weapons<br/>
carried<br/>
by every member of our group is better than either the PGT or the BLW.<br/>
Why?<br/>
That&#39;s a good question.  Since we don&#39;t have anybody near my level who<br/>
is a<br/>
melee class (or hybrid other than the SK) its really puzzling.  Our<br/>
mages<br/>
carry Glowing Wooden Crooks or better, at 150pp not hard to see why.<br/>
The<br/>
shadowknight has a dark Reaver and I&#39;m using the same primary as the 7th<br/>
level ranger, a dragoon dirk.  At 25pp who would blame him?  A good 1HS<br/>
weapon on the other hand cost 400pp+.<br/>
Why does this inequity exist?  Because in truth their are far more good<br/>
piercing weapons per piercing user than 1HS per 1HS user.  All the good<br/>
1HS<br/>
weapons at the mid-levels are either warrior or paladin or ranger only.<br/>
I<br/>
could currently get thru quests at least 6 weapons I cannot use.  The<br/>
quests<br/>
are easily doable for a group of my level or close (21st).  I can get no<br/>
decent weapons via quest that I can use except the Screaming Mace that I<br/>
did<br/>
9 levels ago.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me if anyone can refute this and offer me a solution to where I<br/>
might find a better weapon obtainable I&#39;d be glad to hear it.  I get<br/>
really<br/>
tired of having my own guild members laugh, &quot;you still using that little<br/>
sticker?&quot;  I suppose I could buy a PGT, but at the 250pp they go for on<br/>
E&#39;ci<br/>
it hardly seems justifiable.  Any suggestions out there?  I currently<br/>
own 4<br/>
magical piercing weapons (don&#39;t ask), and 2 magical 1HB, but only a<br/>
combine<br/>
Scimitar for 1HS.<br/>

&gt; Hopefully this gives you some insight into how tricky designing some<br/>

<br/>

  insight, more information, and more chuckles than anything<br/>
  else Verant releases.  I especially enjoyed reading his story<br/>
  about the GM event he ran a long time ago.  I wish there were <br/>
  more of him running around at Verant.  The game would<br/>
  probably be a lot more interesting.<br/>
