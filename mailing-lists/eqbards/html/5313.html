<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096279795">OK,<br/>
     <br/>
          After two days of errand running, escort duty and chores (my bud <br/>
     is a 25th level enchanter and she has run the quest eight times now.) <br/>
     I am now the proud owner of a glowing stein.  Why you say?  Your a <br/>
     bard silly and you can&#39;t even drink out of it...  anyway  I hoping to <br/>
     trade this baby in for something good before the value drops any more. <br/>
     (I wish V would disable the quest like the rumors claim then the value <br/>
     would skyrocket)  <br/>
          What do you think I can get for a Glowing stein?  Thulian claws?  <br/>
     Writhing staff, Elfhide (shudder) gloves, trollhide belt?  What would <br/>
     you suggest?  Specifically which zone should I go to, to trade for the <br/>
     claws?  Suggestions and rude comments welcome.  :)<br/>
