<div id="ygrps-yiv-473600133">I&#39;m not saying that these aren&#39;t useful for inturrupting spells.  Its just<br/>
been my experience that it doesn&#39;t make their head actually nod, or their<br/>
eyes glaze over.  They get hit with the spell, and are still able to carry<br/>
out their regular business whereas a MOB will sleep for a few pulses.  I<br/>
could be mistaken, I&#39;ve only tried each of these once, so I&#39;ll give it<br/>
another shot in the next few days to verify.<br/>

&gt; a) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>
&gt; monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?  Is this<br/>
&gt; intentional or a bug?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure what you guys are missing, but Pixie Strike works *quite* well for<br/>
me against players - just like against NPCs, time it right, and the player<br/>
ends<br/>
up stunned and interrupted in their cast.  Lullaby has a lesser effect, but<br/>
also<br/>
<br/>
works.  In fact, the only song that doesn&#39;t really seem to do anything to<br/>
players is Kelin&#39;s Lament, other than giving them the &quot;You feel a sense of<br/>
loss&quot; message. :)<br/>
