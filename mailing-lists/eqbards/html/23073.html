<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761884524">I have a level 18 halfing druid alt, mainly for those times I get disgusted<br/>
waiting for a bind/group.  I blow entire bars of mana on bards...hehe...just<br/>
cause I can.  I always bind, I always sow.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to lump them all in the &quot;bad&quot; category!  :)<br/>

Spawn time is 6:30am, He usually hangs around lavastorm trying without<br/>
success to get a group or a gate for 45 minutes. Then when he does find a<br/>
gate at 7:15 he takes 10 minutes to cross dreadlands (he&#39;s an easy target<br/>
now that he&#39;s slower).  He then camps the bank area in Firiona Vie untill<br/>
8am trying to get a bind and gets ignored by ignorant druid halflings and<br/>
finally despawns around 8am in karnors after a shaman binds him.<br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story? there is none, just stating i had a shitty morning since<br/>
cant find groups or bind for 45 minutes each.<br/>
<br/>
They should really allow shamen to make gate potions (even if they only work<br/>
in town)<br/>
