<b>Subject:</b> New Patch. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459530425">for all of those wondering... the new patch supposedly fixes the spell casting weapon vs song bug....<br/>
as well as updating one of the songs to require mana..<br/>
in addition there is no way for bards to speed up mana regen... (sorry, those buffs won&#39;t work...) <br/>
<br/>
anyways... just login and read the patch message... you&#39;ll be much happier with your characters...</div>
