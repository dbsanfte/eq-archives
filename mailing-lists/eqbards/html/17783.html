<div id="ygrps-yiv-313269925">Heh, one of my guildmates suggested this so I tried it.  I logged back in<br/>
the next day and found myself in a canoe in the middle of the ocean no where<br/>
near land.  Maybe I switched places with some other explorer?  It seems to<br/>
depend on what has happened to the canoe you camped in in the meantime.  If<br/>
it hasn&#39;t despawned you definitely reappear in the canoe wherever it is<br/>
currently.  Otherwise it may be the sister isle, unless my canoe had been<br/>
used continuously for 14 hours, which sadly enough is actually a<br/>
possibility.<br/>

Speaking of OOT, I found a very useful bug there a while back with my Monk.<br/>
I was in a canoe and had gotten lost trying to find the sisters isle to get<br/>
on the boat.  So I got bored and camped while in the canoe.  Well I logged<br/>
back on about an hour later to find myself on the dock at the sister&#39;s isle.<br/>
I have not tried to reproduce it though.<br/>

&gt; Hail a Lurker!  Hey Rylos!  I have had some zoning issues as <br/>
&gt; well, both in<br/>
&gt; Lavastorm and OOT.  I zoned into OOT from Butcherblock, only <br/>
&gt; to find myself<br/>
&gt; on the sister isle.  This has happened a couple of times and <br/>
&gt; is a real pain<br/>
&gt; as the Freeport bound boat no longer stops there.  I have <br/>
&gt; also zoned in and<br/>
&gt; found myself on the bottom of the world.  There was no escape <br/>
&gt; from this<br/>
&gt; situation, so I had to wait for a guide to show up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lavastorm hasn&#39;t dropped me in Lava yet, but I have zoned <br/>
&gt; from Najena into<br/>
&gt; OOT.  That was truly bizarre, especially since I was actually <br/>
&gt; headed to<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock.  I&#39;ve also zoned out of Najena and appeared in <br/>
&gt; Najena near the<br/>
&gt; Tentacle Terror room.  Very odd.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have found Lavastorm to be very buggy when zoning in and <br/>
&gt; out of it.  I<br/>
&gt; have zoned out of Najena into a pool of lava.  The guide <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t bat an eye<br/>
&gt; about rezzing me so I figured it must happen quite often.  I <br/>
&gt; also had an odd<br/>
&gt; occurance happen last night.  I was zoning from Nektulos and <br/>
&gt; had a couple<br/>
&gt; guards on me.  and while zoning was disconnected several <br/>
&gt; times.  When I<br/>
&gt; finally got back in I was in the NE corner of the zone rather <br/>
&gt; than by the<br/>
&gt; zone line.  I have only had this happen when zoning from <br/>
&gt; Oasis and dropping<br/>
&gt; in near the grassy section of N Ro.  <br/>
