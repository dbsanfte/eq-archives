<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-277467438">It has recently come to my attention that there are two special instruments <br/>
that I did not know existed in game.  They are called &quot;Drum of Selo&#39;s March&quot; <br/>
and &quot;Brahm&#39;s Horn&quot;.  I was wondering if anyone had any information on where <br/>
these items can be obtained.</div>
