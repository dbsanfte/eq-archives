<div id="ygrps-yiv-107484968">Its a serious problem, I got dropped into the ocean of tears... spent 1.5<br/>
hours swimming, thank god for the jig, finally made it to the Isle of the<br/>
Sisters ( i was dropped just entering OOT from Kaladim), Then for a kick in<br/>
the pants I caught the boat at the isle, and entered the freeport zone, got<br/>
disconned, and appeared as boat was leaving Freeport, had to jumpship and<br/>
swim to the docks.  My swimming is 91 now.<br/>

&gt;around till that strange sound stopped.  Stamina started picking up.  Sat<br/>

&gt;matter where I sat, sitting just plain drained my Stam.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;People disappearing, yes.  Very strange.  Could just be graphics glitch?  I<br/>
&gt;was in a party with a friend and we were in group speak so can&#39;t comment on<br/>
&gt;/say.  But it was a little disturbing to see your partner sitting there one<br/>
&gt;second and then vanishing right before your eyes.  But because of opinion<br/>
