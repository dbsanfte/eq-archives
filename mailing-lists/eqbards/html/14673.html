<br/>
  Harmonic punches a snake for 13 points of damage.<br/>
  Harmonic punches a willowisp for 12 points of damage.<br/>
  Harmonic punches King Thex&#39;Ka IV for 9 points of damage.<br/>

  There you have it.  That&#39;s the most use you&#39;ll receive from that pos.<br/>
<br/>
  Ask them to take you to Mistmoore and get a more commonly dropped<br/>
  &#39;Gypsy Lute&#39;(sm).  It&#39;s no-drop and gives +5 to magic, no healing<br/>
  bonuses tho.  But at least it&#39;s something.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
