<b>Subject:</b> Philosophy behind the Bard class <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955296248">Is it just me or has anyone else noticed this?  It almost seems as if the<br/>
Bard class was designed with two distinct, and antagonistic philosophies in<br/>
place.  <br/>
<br/>
On the one hand we have our skill sets and equipment availability&#39;s.  These<br/>
when viewed alone definitely seem to put the bard in a Jack-of-all-trades,<br/>
completely self-sufficient, ultimate lone wolf mode.  We can do a little bit<br/>
of everything skill wise but nothing really well and many things just barely<br/>
enough to maybe get by.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand we have our spell abilities.  These are definitely<br/>
designed with bards as the ultimate party animals in mind.  Our magical<br/>
abilities magnify immensely with each member we add to our group, and are<br/>
underpowered at best if we are alone with some notable exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
After looking at our class thru these lenses, I came to the conclusion that<br/>
all our class balance questions seem to be caused by these two conflicting<br/>
design philosophies.  Our skill set does not really support our magical<br/>
abilities well, and our magical abilities lends itself better to the skill<br/>
set of a true caster than it does to what we have.  Looking at Bards this<br/>
way only makes them appear even more cobbled together than before and while<br/>
our spell system does seem to have a definitive focus that is coherent and<br/>
well thought out, our skill set pales by comparison.  If our skills<br/>
complemented our magical abilities more I think there would be few<br/>
complaints, but as it is they are totally unrelated with the exception of<br/>
our instrument skills.<br/>
<br/>
What do the rest of you think on this issue?  Are our skills really<br/>
complementary to our magical abilities or are we a disjointed class, bound<br/>
by a conflict between two different pictures of what a bard should be that<br/>
were never resolved?  Would we be better served by a simpler skill set that<br/>
improved our abilities to better align with other hybrids, or should some of<br/>
our near-useless skills be better replaced with skills more in keeping with<br/>
our more caster-like nature?  If Paladins, Rangers, and Shadowknights are<br/>
melee types with some secondary spell abilities as seems apparent, shouldn&#39;t<br/>
we be more aligned to be spell types with secondary melee abilities?  I<br/>
would argue our melee abilities are already secondary as we get far fewer<br/>
melee skills than the other hybrids and cannot use the high damage ratio two<br/>
handed weapons they can.  Thoughts?  <br/>

PS I didn&#39;t come up with this all on my own, but it grew out of discussion<br/>
at the latest gathering of my guild the Armigers of Mirth at our local Dave<br/>
and Busters.  It was actually our main cleric who first questioned the<br/>
dichotomy.</div>
