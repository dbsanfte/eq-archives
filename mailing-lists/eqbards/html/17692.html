list.....<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a little story from a lvl 50 bard who visited the Dino last night:<br/>
<br/>
As for fun with this song?<br/>
<br/>
Try my little adventure today  I went out to oot just to charm the dino for<br/>
kicks. Well after I charmed him and slaughtered a lot of goblins I decided<br/>
to try something a little more... exciting.<br/>
<br/>
I kicked on the jboots and lev song and slowly dragged the dino way out<br/>
into the ocean, back to the seafury island. Here I used him to slay Gornit,<br/>
who had a fine steel war hammer. I gave this too him and OMFG that was one<br/>
big hammer. But it made me realize that he could now dual wield. So I<br/>
dropped Dixl and gave him a rusty rapier. I now had a level 50 pet hitting<br/>
for quad 137. I told him to attack a seafury, he killed it in under 40<br/>
seconds. I killed a few more, incredible exp. Literally killing a seafury<br/>
every minute. Only taking a break every few clops to run around twisting<br/>
hymn/niv to heal up from the occasional resist/mistake. I realized that the<br/>
clop&#39;s were doing under 5% dmg to the dino, and that he probably could take<br/>
a lot more... So I started training the entire island. The dino was killing<br/>
up to 5 clops at ONE time. I am solo mind you.<br/>
<br/>
I kept this up for about an hour, making nearly a bub of exp. I think went<br/>
LD and lost half of it!  Oops. Serves me right I suppose, these kind of<br/>
tactics are exactly the reason our charm song was capped at level 37 to<br/>
begin with and it most likely is not in my best interest to be exploiting<br/>
them. Err.. what am I saying. This tactic OWNS! Enjoy it while it lasts, I<br/>
cringe at the thought of how little time it will take for the /feedbacks to<br/>
start about how over-powered bards are.<br/>
