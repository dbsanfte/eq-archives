<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411553509">BTW I noticed this last night when we were fighting the drunkard.  I was<br/>
applying liberal use of my charm through out the night and was surprised<br/>
when I got the &quot;This NPC cannot be charmed message&quot; when I tried to charm<br/>
the drunkard&#39;s pet earth elemental.  I just changed tactics and made sure I<br/>
had a pet Inferno Wizard every time we pulled the drunkard from that point<br/>
on... I love it when it drains it&#39;s mana and helps me get rid of an annoying<br/>
MOB at the same time :-)<br/>

&gt; Actually the reason it did not stick is that a couple of months ago they<br/>
&gt; patched charm so that you could not charm a pet while the summoner is<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; alive.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hey Beatdrop....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The reason why your charm did not stick was the fact that you were still<br/>
&gt; &gt;grouped with the Magician.  When grouped all spells and effects that are<br/>
&gt; &gt;harmful to your group members does not hit.  I know for a fact that charm<br/>
&gt; &gt;works.  Heck I used it on my bride to be two patches after the PvP charm<br/>
&gt; &gt;patch and it worked without a problem.  If this is not the case then my<br/>
&gt; &gt;bride will spank this poor bard when we duel this coming Saturday...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Last night I was in a group in Highkeep and we got on the topic of<br/>
&gt; &gt;dueling.  While I was running my mouth, the magician I was with<br/>
challenged<br/>
&gt; &gt;me to a duel.  We were the same level (29) and I said what the hell.  He<br/>
&gt; &gt;had a fire elemental pet that was blue to me so I decided that the only<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would stand a chance would be to try to charm him into fighting his<br/>
pet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Well, let me just say that I thought charm was only nerfed on the PvP<br/>
&gt; &gt;servers and NOT in PvP mode.  Wrong!  So I start the duel with the<br/>
thought<br/>
&gt; &gt;of charming him.  Hit the song, and wait, and wait, and wait... no pulse!<br/>
&gt; &gt;WTF? So I try charming his pet that is now attacking me.  Resist, resist,<br/>
&gt; &gt;(thinking cool, its pulsing, gonna work), charm sticks but no charm!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Instead I got a message saying &#39;This NPC cannot be charmed.&#39; Dammit!<br/>
NOOO!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Meanwhile, I am getting the hell nuked out of me while trying to figure<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; &gt;what to do next.  So I die.  I pop back up and my opponents health bar is<br/>
&gt; &gt;down (still grouped) and I hear &#39;Beat, Demi is getting the sh*t kicked<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; &gt;of him.&#39;  Come to find out, after looting my corpse, that after I died,<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; &gt;pet agro&#39;d on him.  Strange charm bug is what I am assuming.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone on the list dueled a magician or a caster with a pet and<br/>
won?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  He was a really cool guy and I asked him for a rematch some other time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;My new tactic is just like how I would fight a wizzie, below him to<br/>
death.<br/>
&gt; &gt;His pet wasn&#39;t hitting to hard and I think I can solo his pet by melee<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt;songs.  So, I think I can take him by just staying on his butt and<br/>
keeping<br/>
&gt; &gt;his spells interrupted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any other suggestions?  I am also assuming that Screech won&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; &gt;either.<br/>
