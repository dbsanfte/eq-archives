<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186946749">Last night I made the mistake of following a group of Paladins (and my number one rogue -- who is, by the way the best dungeon asset I&#39;ve ever had) into SolA to harvest Melatite.  I arrived just in time to see at least 10 clockworks chasing them out of the zone into Solb. <br/>
    <br/>
    Faction wrecked, they decided to kill Kobolds in a repair attempt.  We made our way to the Pool room? and, by the way, I did notice one of those paintings Harmonic was talking about (please follow up on that Harm, it seems really interesting!).  We spent at least 2 hours there and I finally dinged into 29 (yeah I know, what the hell was I doing in SolB?).  <br/>
<br/>
    My question is this - midway through a battle, an LDC popped in the pool room and proceeded to kick all of our asses down to nearly nothing in seconds.  Luckily we all zoned with less than a bubble of health between the lot of us.  Is that supposed to happen?  Does one always spawn there or was it just my typical luck?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

PS - Finally got my bluebicite bp last night, so now my guild can&#39;t accuse me of getting dressed in the dark anymore - hehe!  I&#39;m so glad to be rid of the bronze.  Blue everything with an orange bp was....how shall I put it.....~shiver~.... Ugly!<br/>
