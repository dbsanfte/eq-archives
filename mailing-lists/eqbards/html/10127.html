&gt; Level 28 bard vs. level 31 High Elf Wizard (Bard won):<br/>
&gt; This fight was a bitch but my best duel to date. He<br/>
&gt; had Jboots which sucked, and exploited the fact that<br/>
&gt; my connection was bad that evening. We started with<br/>
&gt; the typical BBB vs. a caster, and he did get a few<br/>
&gt; spells off on me, but not many. When we were both at<br/>
&gt; half health I hid and healed back up to full. We<br/>
&gt; started at it again, and that&#39;s when I learned the<br/>
&gt; coolest mid level bard tactic against casters in the<br/>
&gt; book. He finally got me rooted and started backing off<br/>
&gt; for the kill. Just charm them, thy run right up next<br/>
&gt; to you, and can&#39;t cast for the duration. All 5 times<br/>
&gt; he was able to root me I charmed him and meleed him<br/>
&gt; when it wore off. To mess with them even more, make<br/>
&gt; them stand up, sit down, report your name, etc. Fun to<br/>
&gt; the bystanders.<br/>
<br/>
ROFL!  I have a list of Finger Wigglers as long as my &lt;insert appendage<br/>
here&gt; that I would love to do this to. </span></blockquote></div>
