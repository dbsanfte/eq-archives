&gt; &gt; As for new graphics for armor, I doubt they&#39;ll provide <br/>
&gt; different looking<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor types except in the expansion. Verant&#39;s put in a lot <br/>
&gt; of effort to<br/>
&gt; &gt; minimize the different &quot;looks&quot; of armor out there and <br/>
&gt; basically take the<br/>
&gt; &gt; armor that is already in the game, and &quot;colorize&quot; it to <br/>
&gt; represent different<br/>
&gt; &gt; types. The banded armor for Half Elf is also used for <br/>
&gt; &quot;blackened&quot; armor. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;bronze&quot; armor is used for Mithril/Lambent/Plate (probably <br/>
&gt; barnacle) and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe Imbrued.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   On this issue, I understand the technical reason why they made so<br/>
&gt;   few textured armor looks.  It all boils down to leather/chain/plate<br/>
&gt;   with colorization across all races.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   My gripe is that once you reach higher levels you should stand out<br/>
&gt;   with the best armor / weapons in the game.  Right now I look like<br/>
&gt;   a L20 bard, but instead of bronze (orange) plate I have inbrued <br/>
&gt;   (pee yellow) plate.  People say, nice Yk and Fine Steel Morning <br/>
&gt;   Star?  Why do you wield that?  Can I buy yer Yk, pls...  And I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;   like dude, get lost, heh... it&#39;s not a friggin Ykesha, and this<br/>
&gt;   &#39;fine steel ms&#39; would clobber you.  hehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Verant did a poor job of holding people&#39;s interest in the creative<br/>
&gt;   department.  They just continue to reuse the same graphics over and<br/>
&gt;   over.  I mean the Plane of Sky... how embarrassing.  They <br/>
&gt; took faerie<br/>
&gt;   graphics and imp graphics (god I&#39;m tired of imps) and just <br/>
&gt; scaled them,<br/>
&gt;   gave them 5k more hp, allow them to hit for 195+ and viola, <br/>
&gt; a new area.<br/>
&gt;   Gimme a break.  I&#39;m reluctant to pay 230p to get in and <br/>
&gt; 700p to buy keys<br/>
&gt;   to cross what appears to be the desert of Ro in the air, <br/>
&gt; just to meet<br/>
&gt;   up with some f&#39;ing imp who can kill me by triple attacking <br/>
&gt; in the 190s<br/>
&gt;   in less than 2 seconds.  No thanks. hehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Plane of Sky is a flop.  They are going too far with this <br/>
&gt; monkey sink<br/>
&gt;   bs.  Time to go beat up some ice giants now for the cash to hit the<br/>
&gt;   plane so I can die to find out what goodies are up there, if any.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol! Man, I&#39;m just tired of seeing a &quot;goblin&quot; appear in every zone! How many<br/>
different colors can they paint these things and their &quot;crack&quot;? :-)<br/>
<br/>
In fairness to Verant, they&#39;re trying to create more space and spice things<br/>
up without needing to engineer new graphics/creatures/landscapes, etc. I&#39;m<br/>
sure all of their top people who would create these have been working on<br/>
Kunark. I&#39;m all for more zones/space on the servers. I&#39;m surprised they<br/>
don&#39;t have some type of air goblin though. :-)<br/>
