<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422140933">I am glad they are offering this service. Granted anything that gets offered<br/>
has the potential of getting abused but still honest folks will benefit too.<br/>
I have known some couples who start with one account and one partner takes<br/>
such a liking they end up needing to start over on a second account etc. We<br/>
are looking at sort of the reverse. Friend of ours started about when<br/>
everyone else we know did and is now a 55 enchanter. Since summer started,<br/>
he&#39;s had less and less time to play and says he&#39;s losing interest in the<br/>
game. We have helped do quests and camp equipment for this guy, and no way<br/>
we want to see a 55 chanter deleted or cancelled but we have 4 accounts<br/>
already. Now we could change the account info to match one of our accounts,<br/>
tranfer the character and then cancel the extra account. I do think that<br/>
when winter closes back in, EQ will look like more fun once again to him,<br/>
and so we haven&#39;t pushed his decision.<br/>
