<b>Subject:</b> RE: I won my dream item!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668277815">This is true, and to my knowledge it&#39;s the only way to cheat on a roll.  If<br/>
Verant hopped the clue train and made the rolls appear in yellow or red<br/>
there&#39;d be no way to cheat.  As it is, emotes and rolls are the same color.<br/>
Duh.<br/>
<br/>
Cheetr creates an emote that produces the following:<br/>
<br/>
Cheetr says &#39;Blah, blah...  I hope I win.&#39;_______<br/>
Cheetr could have rolled any number from 1 to 100<br/>
but this time he made sure it was a 98.<br/>
<br/>
Just make double sure that NO ONE in a roll has &quot;said&quot; anything prior to the<br/>
roll itself.  If anyone has, reroll, perhaps using the method below:<br/>
<br/>
The leader of the group randoms a number 1 to 100 and then the group rolls<br/>
to that.  That way no one can use the emote cheat.<br/>
<br/>
Leader rolls 1 to 100 and gets a 43.<br/>
Everyone else does a /random 1 43 for the winner.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the 1-6 Alpha method is that if the leader and someone in<br/>
the group are wooking in cahoots, the randomer could make sure his buddy won<br/>
the roll for the item that he really wanted.<br/>

&gt; One way I&#39;ve heard of people cheating is to use the space wrap trick.<br/>
&gt; You could type something. i.e.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never win these things&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;lots of spaces until your  text<br/>
&gt; wraps to the next line&gt; then<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blah has rolled...... </span></blockquote></div>
