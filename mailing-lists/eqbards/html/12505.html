<b>Subject:</b> Lambent breastplate quest peculiarity <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368418926">I completed the lambent breastplate quest the other day.  When I gave the<br/>
quest components to Cyrissia (sp?), I got the breastplate, faction change<br/>
messages, experience gain message,  etc.  I then noticed on the next line in<br/>
the text window a message from Cyrissia saying &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting<br/>
something?&quot;.  None of the words were bracketed as a key word/phrase.  I<br/>
tried replying with variations of &quot;What am I forgetting?&quot; but got no further<br/>
response from her.  Was wondering if this was just a bug or if there might<br/>
possibly something else I could have given her?<br/>
