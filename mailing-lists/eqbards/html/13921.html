&gt; Try putting the strings in quotes.  This will keep the parser <br/>
&gt; from getting<br/>
&gt; confused by the spacer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IE /f &quot;this is an error&quot;<br/>

typo from the friends list and it&#39;s next to impossible to remove these as<br/>
you must type it out exactly character for character. This is very difficult<br/>
in a long friend&#39;s name. But this is an excellent suggestion.<br/>

&gt; If I want to remove someone from my friend list I just type <br/>
&gt; /friend soandso<br/>
&gt; and it removes them, just type the name of the person you <br/>
&gt; want to remove<br/>
&gt; after the /friend<br/>
&gt; Works for me, might be a bit tedious but it saves deleting files etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps<br/>

remove a standard friend name.<br/>

&gt; Is there anyway to delete your entire /friend list and start <br/>
&gt; over?  I typed<br/>
&gt; in /friend to see who all was listed on there that I hadn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; seen in a long<br/>
&gt; time.  I noticed that there were a couple of phrases listed <br/>
&gt; in addition to<br/>
&gt; players.  Apparently I thought I was sending a /tell, /say, <br/>
&gt; or /groupsay<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; instead I hit &quot;/f&quot; instead of &quot;/t&quot; so I ended up adding the <br/>
&gt; phrase I typed<br/>
&gt; to my friend list. When I type in /friend and get the entire <br/>
&gt; list, there<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; a few blank spaces in front of the phrases.  I have made <br/>
&gt; numerous attempts<br/>
&gt; at removing the phrase by adding one, two, three, etc spaces <br/>
&gt; before I type<br/>
&gt; in any letters.  All this does is add another phrase to my <br/>
&gt; friend list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thinking if I delete my characters .opt file in the EQ <br/>
&gt; directory this<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; delete my friends list as well as all my hotkeys.  Will this work?  My<br/>
&gt; friends list is full so I need to free up the slots.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
