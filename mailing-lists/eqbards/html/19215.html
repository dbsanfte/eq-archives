<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337213040">I didn&#39;t catch the message last night. I never thought of it as an exploit.<br/>
Now I do.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;d be a shame to lose everything I&#39;ve worked for over the past seven<br/>

Definitely not worth it.<br/>

&gt;Coincidence? Someone want to see if this still works?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The servers went down yesterday to fix problems with sound that were causing<br/>
people to crash and lock up randomly.  Last night was the first time in four<br/>
months that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>
before I had to reboot my computer.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and that sweet DING! sound as I hit 25! :)<br/>
