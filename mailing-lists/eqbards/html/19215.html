Now I do.<br/>

It&#39;d be a shame to lose everything I&#39;ve worked for over the past seven<br/>

<br/>

people to crash and lock up randomly.  Last night was the first time in four<br/>
months that I was able to play the game with sound for more than 5 minutes<br/>
before I had to reboot my computer.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and that sweet DING! sound as I hit 25! :)<br/>
