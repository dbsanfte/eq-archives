  hehe.<br/>

  As soon as I died I /consent&#39;d him, CR was merely asking a level<br/>
  30 cleric to rez me.  I don&#39;t care about exp these days.  I donated<br/>
  enough money to buy 1/3 of her level 34 spells.  I had a great<br/>
  time in there, despite the fact Sog kicked my butt.<br/>
<br/>
  Our charm becomes useless after level 37.  I used to just charm<br/>
  back our team members who got charmed.  But since everyone I play<br/>
  with is &gt; L37, same rules apply.  Too high to be charmed.  Otherwise<br/>
  I would have charmed him back, and made him starfire her.<br/>
