<b>Subject:</b> How do I get off this list? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395759670">Hi, Like a bone head I forgot how to get off this email list. Can anyone<br/>
tell me?  I play a Shaman now, because I got sick of massive Bard hate and<br/>
dying all the time from being to close to a party fighting a mob that for<br/>
some reason decided my little bard was more of a threat than the 6 level 20+<br/>
people pounding on it.<br/>
I loved the list though,  And wish everyone luck.<br/>
