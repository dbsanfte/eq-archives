<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lvl 48 song ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227465954">No luck yet for me yet. I have been told that singing NO songs in there <br/>
greatly reduces training, but this is not verified. I&#39;m still debating that <br/>
as the first time I went it was well over an hour before we got trained and <br/>
that train was caused by some idiot who wanted to SEE what the zone looked <br/>
like.. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
We did have to let some nice rogue armor decay (I hate that), and one of our <br/>
pally&#39;s got a nice 2 hander (20 dmg 36 delay I believe).<br/>
<br/>
Couple bards on my server do have Evensong and 6 Notes, but they got their <br/>
imbrued sets from the original Fear (right after it opened). Innoruuk (sp?) <br/>
was killed last week and dropped a 9/18 ROG only poker, and a 19/29 1 hand <br/>
slasher (don&#39;t remember what classes can use, but I do not believe Bard was <br/>
included).<br/>
