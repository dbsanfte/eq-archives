 </span></blockquote>There is one way to level quicker...  get in a group, learn how to work with<br/>
them, and go after yellow/red mobs.  Do all you can to reduce &quot;down time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A great many bards think that any song they want to do is great.  But this<br/>
is NOT true.  Learn how to &quot;read&quot; the group you&#39;re in.  A group that&#39;s heavy<br/>
in melee chars but light in healers will require you to stack healing and<br/>
anthem, for example.  As you advance in level, you&#39;ll find you have more<br/>
options of what songs to play to enhance the performance and survivability<br/>
of your group.  Learning how to choose the right song combo for your group<br/>
and the types of mobs you&#39;re hunting, is perhaps the single most important<br/>
skill you will ever learn, and will garner you the best chance of being the<br/>
bard always in demand.<br/>
