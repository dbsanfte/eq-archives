&gt; This &quot;feature&quot; was something I was unaware of until just a few days ago.  I<br/>
&gt; think it also helps to explain the high frequency of trains in Unrest.<br/>
&gt; Apparently some of the rooms are linked to one another.  Like the previous<br/>
&gt; poster said, the tower is linked to the barroom.  If you are in the barroom<br/>
&gt; and no one is in the tower, the mobs in the tower will come down to the<br/>
&gt; barroom when they spawn.  I believe the barroom is linked to the magi room.<br/>
&gt; I was camping the magi room last Saturday and to our surprise in walked a<br/>
&gt; noble.  What was even a bigger surprise is that one of the partymembers got<br/>
&gt; a BS tunic off of him.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In all truth the bar room and the tower are linked because of the thin<br/>
floor.  All mobs in that area can see whatever in both rooms whenever they<br/>
spawn.  While in the barroom you will routinely see a spawned mob attack<br/>
someone in the tower.  As for the Magi and the hand room the chance of you<br/>
getting clobbered is dependent on where the train goes from the<br/>
tower/barroom.  IF they go down the stairs they may come after you.  If<br/>
they come down the hallway they may actually come after you in the hand<br/>
room.  BTW when you hear someone screaming train watch your singing.<br/>
Somehow I was able to grab the tower train when it passed by the hand<br/>
room.  I am fearing that I got added to the the mobs shit list when it ran<br/>
by.<br/>
