<b>Subject:</b> PGT vs. Barbed Leather Whip.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218628770">I know this has been gone over already, but since now that I am getting close to the affording range I would like some more Info on it.  My stats right now are: 104 strength (big improvement over 85 eh?) 94 agility, 111dex, 90 charisma, 80 int, 60 wisdom.<br/>
    Because I am moving onto mobs that carry pricier loot and I in turn am racking up more cash I have to wonder once again, which is better for me? The Polished Granite Tomahawk, or the Barbed Leather whip?  I have asked a number of high level bards on my server, and have gotten conflicting answers...  I have been leaning over to the Barbed Leather whip side of things, but because I have a pretty good dex I was wondering if maybe because I would proc more on the PGT, the tommy would be a better choice.  I have got about 80pp in the bank right now, but I have started working on Lake Rathe and Permafrost, and have been getting sizable donations for healing and Taxi rides, as well as Teaching Elder dragon, and a friend of mine and I are starting a heavy duty jewelering biz, so My new fortune is not far off.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all your help, and please don&#39;t over reply to this... I would hate to start a Giant thread.<br/>

p.s. A guildmate of mine gave me the BI crown he looted off a Goblin Warlord for trade for my Bronze helm!  I nearly pissed myself when he offered the trade...</div>
