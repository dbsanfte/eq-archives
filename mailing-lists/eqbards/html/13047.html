<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060864533">Supposedly Mayong Mistmoore hates bards with a passion.  He&#39;s probably<br/>
killed quite a few over the years and collected their instruments as<br/>
trophies.  If a player kills Mayong, there might be a chance he drops<br/>
Kelin&#39;s lute or the small brass trumpet as part of the loot.  Mayong is<br/>
supposedly in the game, but you can&#39;t get to him because of pathing problems<br/>
and therefore can&#39;t kill him.  So technically these magic instruments are<br/>
&quot;in the game&quot;, but no one can ever obtain them.  <br/>
<br/>
This is just blind speculation on my part but wouldn&#39;t it be tremendously<br/>
ironic if it were true:-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Many thanks for the praise.  I haven&#39;t seen any clues to either of these<br/>
&gt; items.  Of course it could well be like the component for the summon<br/>
&gt; corpse<br/>
&gt; spell started out.  They should be in the game, but if GZ even has a<br/>
&gt; different client than every live person out there, chances are there a lot<br/>
&gt; more things they think they put in that never made it to the live servers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll redouble my efforts in looking for them but none of the usual suspect<br/>
&gt; merchants have them.  maybe if you do one of the quests 30 times you will<br/>
&gt; get one of them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Kitasi<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of all the people I know on E&#39;ci, Kitasi has done more quests than anyone<br/>
&gt; else.  If he hasn&#39;t gotten any clues yet about these instruments, then I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; inclined to believe that they fall into the Fiery Avenger category.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; As anothe side note, GZ said that Kelin&#39;s practice lute and the small<br/>
&gt; &gt; brass <br/>
&gt; &gt; trumpet are both in the game, you just have to look hard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Is this another Fiery avenger? I have noticed that a few wierd people<br/>
&gt; sell<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; bardic instruments (Krak in South Karana??) so maybe you need good<br/>
&gt; faction<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; with some of them to get a quest?<br/>
