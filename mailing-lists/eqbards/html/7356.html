&gt; After Chain breaks Root, you will move at a slow rate until the Chain affect <br/>

&gt; with Accelerado, but better than being rooted for 30+ seconds.  And if you <br/>
&gt; are outdoor, once root is broken, you can fire up Accelerado and that will <br/>
&gt; cancel the Chain effect right the way.  Chain works both indoor and outdoor, <br/>
&gt; and most the stuff that will root you will be inside a dungeon anyway after <br/>
&gt; level 23.<br/>

root icon would remain indicating Accelerando was overriding<br/>
the root effect.  When Accelerando was changed to no longer<br/>
break SoW, the SoW icon would remain, but because Accelerando<br/>
could not override SoW the song effect never kicked in.<br/>
<br/>
Since Accelerando does not break root anymore, I suspect<br/>
having the root icon on your screen will be like having the<br/>
SoW icon on your screen, and it will prevent the song effect<br/>
from kicking in.<br/>
<br/>
If this is the case, whether there will be a world of<br/>
difference between Chain breaking root (but the icon remains),<br/>
and Chain breaking root (wiping out the root icon).  I only<br/>
tested the effect of Chain and Accelerando on each other.  I<br/>
did not test how they interact if a third effect (root) is<br/>
also in play.<br/>
