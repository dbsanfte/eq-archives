<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999598203">I am pretty sure the missed note has to do with your instrument skill <br/>
associated with the song your are playing.  I remember when I first hit <br/>
level 16, I could play the level 16 without any problem even when I have 0 <br/>
skill in wind instrument.  Then a few days later, I couldn&#39;t get the song to <br/>
start without 10 or 15 missed note.  Somehow Verant had changed the song <br/>
without telling us.<br/>
<br/>
I think the same thing happened to the rest of the songs since the last <br/>
patch.  If your instrument skill for that song is way lower than your <br/>
current level skill cap, that might have caused the missed notes.  I hardly <br/>
ever get a missed note now, but all my instrument and singing skills are at <br/>
200.  My dex is also over 120.. so I don&#39;t know if that could be the reason <br/>
or not.</div>
