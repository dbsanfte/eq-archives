<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784743689">Just read about the most recent patch on EQVault.  <br/>
<br/>
Those bard related:<br/>
<br/>
A fix for Selos Consonant Chain.  The exact wording is &quot;that it will now work<br/>
better&quot;.  Can anyone confirm if it is now working the way it did before the<br/>
previous patch or if it now has a higher success rate?   <br/>
<br/>
There is also mention that a bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed and that<br/>
spells will now affect more monsters.  I guess its possible that our songs are<br/>
included in this also.  Sure hope this doesn&#39;t mean even more problems with the<br/>
z-axis bug.<br/>
<br/>
Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria has been fixed.  I&#39;m only 22d level so am not aware<br/>
of what the problem was.<br/>
<br/>
Not bard related but a topic of interest is that Lore items in containers that<br/>
are dropped should not be destroyed anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Galtin of E&#39;ci (Back after a two week vacation and still at 22d level due to<br/>
numerous deaths)<br/>
<br/>
P.S.<br/>
<br/>
There were some pretty good topics discussed while I was away.  It took me<br/>
almost all day at work to read through all the digests.  Didn&#39;t get a lick of<br/>
work done:-)</div>
