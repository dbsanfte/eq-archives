&gt;&gt; 3) Bard songs can break root and whirl spells - even if you aren&#39;t using<br/>
&gt;&gt; offensive ones.<br/>

&gt;I can confirm that Accelerando *will* break root.  I tried it<br/>
&gt;when a ghoul rooted me, and was able to move again immediately<br/>
&gt;after Accelerando kicked in.  Heal and Anthem didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt;affect root though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, there is that beneficial effect - but I was referring to the<br/>
detrimental effect.  Your party roots said ghoul - but for some reason your<br/>
song breaks the root.  Any song at all.  (Enchanters have been bemoaning<br/>
this for quite some time, which is why few enchanters want Bards in their<br/>
parties), <br/>
