<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520147402">I&#39;ve written another poem in honor of my guild killing Sir Lucan (at least <br/>
that&#39;s what got me started).<br/>
<br/>
Ack! I&#39;m KOS!<br/>
<br/>
I played my songs in newbie grounds<br/>
Not realizing that my harmful sounds<br/>
Would make you want to strike me down<br/>
Ack! I&#39;m KOS!<br/>
<br/>
The froggies used to like me a lot<br/>
Then one day me and the Shin Lord fought<br/>
I can&#39;t believe what that tangle has wrought<br/>
Ack! I&#39;m KOS!<br/>
<br/>
Being nice is the path I take<br/>
But disliking me you can not fake<br/>
When you whack on me for going near your lake<br/>
Ack! I&#39;m KOS!!<br/>
<br/>
When I must travel I use your ring<br/>
But bears they have this deathwish thing<br/>
They attack me and cause your spells to fling<br/>
Ack! I&#39;m KOS!<br/>
<br/>
The bouncer scowls and beats his chest<br/>
Proclaiming to all that he&#39;s the best<br/>
Who hasn&#39;t heard the bouncer say &quot;I&#39;s vic...I&#39;s vic...I won?&quot;<br/>
Ack! I&#39;m KOS!<br/>
<br/>
There was a time when you didn&#39;t scowl<br/>
But then we took Sir Lucan out<br/>
Why didn&#39;t you just throw in the towel?<br/>
Ack! I&#39;m KOS!<br/>
