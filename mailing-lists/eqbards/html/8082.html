 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right there are no gloves or boots (that i&#39;m aware of) among a few <br/>
other pieces, I&#39;m referring to tunic arms legs (you could include bracers, <br/>
but I don&#39;t wear those).<br/>
I think i will probable go with imbrued armor once I get all the pieces I <br/>
want. I have gloves but the WIS bonus doesn&#39;t make sense to me on them (yay, <br/>
i went from a 60 WIS to 65 *boggles*).<br/>
