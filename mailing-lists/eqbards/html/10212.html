<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146690200">Well,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on my way to get my first piece of Lambent tonight.  I got a bracelet in<br/>
Unrest, with some higher level group members.<br/>
I got a charm in NK, from a &#39;fenne, that I definately helped kill (got xp),<br/>
even though we had my buddy, the 40+ level bard helping out (so I could get<br/>
it). Me, an 18 ranger, a 24 enchanter, and the Jennre.  But I did do it<br/>
myself!  The only piece that I didn&#39;t obtain for myself is the lambent<br/>
stone.  One of my guild is giving me one as a present.  A bunch of them went<br/>
Rathe Giant hunting, and he got it.  And i&#39;m spending every piece of<br/>
platinum I have in the bank to buy the gems.  So, other than the lambent<br/>
stone (which can be bought), I got the things myself (and died ALOT to<br/>
Grimfeather in the bargain).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m twinked on getting this piece.<br/>

&gt; My opinion is that what you&#39;re doing is a noble and interesting<br/>
experiement<br/>
&gt; and completely centered in the Role Playing (RP) of EverQuest.  There is<br/>
&gt; absolutely nothing wrong with the way that you have acquired your<br/>
equipment.<br/>
&gt; My first reaction to buying Lambent items is &quot;Hey, screw that.<br/>
Fight/quest<br/>
&gt; for them and wait to level 25ish to see your first piece like the rest of<br/>
&gt; us.&quot;  However, upon reflection, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s exactly right.  I<br/>
mean,<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re a merchant and barterer by trade, then it&#39;s your RPing<br/>
&gt; responsibility to trade up for items.  10pp for a bronze BP yields 45pp,<br/>
&gt; 40pp buys you a Dragoon Dirk in Crushbone that you sell for 55pp in<br/>
&gt; Freeport, etc. etc.  Ultimately it&#39;s &quot;Nice Item of the Winter Winds&quot; or<br/>
&gt; somesuch traded for Lambent boots.  You COULD achieve all of this without<br/>
&gt; ever even hitting level 2.  Is that right or wrong?  Dunno.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; subjective.  It&#39;s the way that you choose to play the game.  Personally I<br/>
&gt; LIKE kicking the snot out of an Elite Goblin and tearing the Icy Greaves<br/>
off<br/>
&gt; of his cold green legs, venturing to Lower Guk and braving things many<br/>
&gt; levels above me to get the Shin Greaves and then getting some Lambent<br/>
&gt; Greaves that are MINE.  When people ask me if I want to sell them I just<br/>
&gt; think &quot;Yeah, RIGHT.&quot; because I worked hard for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s really just how you choose to play the game.  I have a friend that is<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; tradesman like this.  Got a bard to level 10 and is just holding there,<br/>
&gt; trading, trading, trading.  Runs all over the world trading but not<br/>
&gt; fighting.  But as long as he&#39;s having fun, then he&#39;s getting his money&#39;s<br/>
&gt; worth out of EQ.  Who am I to say he&#39;s playing the game &quot;wrong&quot;?<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; First off I would like to introduce myself. I play Galeras, wood<br/>
&gt; &gt; elf bard, on<br/>
&gt; &gt; E&#39;ci. If you examine my character you will see something like this:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hail, I am Galeras, merchant and bard, lover of fine wine and women.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I grew up poor but do not intend to die that way. Some day I will<br/>
&gt; &gt; live in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; highest trees of Kelethin where only the wealthy abide.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wish Verant gave you more room. Anyway...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I started this character with a simple RP idea in mind, to play a<br/>
&gt; &gt; character<br/>
&gt; &gt; that was not twinked and had a strong desire to become rich. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; should mention<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I started Galeras on a server where I have no other<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters and no<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends to &quot;help&quot;. I have a few goals along the way for him, that I feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; define &quot;rich&quot; and I use as milestones in my RP experiment. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; first of which<br/>
&gt; &gt; was to be in full bronze by level 8. A goal which I achieved last<br/>
&gt; &gt; week after<br/>
&gt; &gt; almost 4 days of /played time. In addition to the bronze I have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; shiny brass<br/>
&gt; &gt; shield, mino axe, tentacle whip, dwarven tunic and a few other things.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I am sure many people will wonder how one can do this without<br/>
&gt; &gt; twinking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me just tell you how I began. I really don&#39;t want a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; people doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; this. Believe it or not I hate twinked characters with items out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of their reach.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually I love to see an orc or goblin kill a twink in full rubicite.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I did the Felewithe mail run twice to get my first song. Then I<br/>
basically<br/>
&gt; &gt; quested and killed things until level 5. By level 5 I probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; had made about<br/>
&gt; &gt; 20pp. Most of this was done by trading. I am after all a merchant<br/>
&gt; &gt; & bard. At<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 5 I decided to travel, one of my favorite passtimes. So, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; picked up a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few passengers that wanted to travel with me and I went to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rivervale. (I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; constantly helping others travel, find their corpses, etc. One of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the reasons<br/>
&gt; &gt; I chose a bard for my experiment. They have many ways to help<br/>
&gt; &gt; others.) I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; hoping to find a Blackened Iron Medallion at a good price that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could sell<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a profit. Instead I saw a medium bronze breastplate for 10pp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I bought it<br/>
&gt; &gt; and sold it in the commons for 45pp.  Anyway you no doubt get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea of how I<br/>
&gt; &gt; got to where I am.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My questions are these:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; * Is what I am doing wrong?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; * Is it outside the spirit of the game?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; * What, if anything, can I do to dispell the illusion that I am a twink?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; * Buying lambent armour is I feel in-character for this<br/>
&gt; &gt; character.  And, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;   never thought twice about it until I was reading some recent<br/>
&gt; &gt; posts. Will I<br/>
&gt; &gt;   be hated for it? Is it wrong? Is it simply jealousy?<br/>
