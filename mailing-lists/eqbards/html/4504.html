<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186661413"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Course you might be right about 1h blunt and skins and the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I spend most of my time hunting down pelts for my tailoring<br/>
skill.  There&#39;s a theory out there that blunt weapons do help in<br/>
getting pelts, and in getting good quality pelts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard from Verant that the loot held by mobs is<br/>
predetermined when they spawn, not when they die (which is why you<br/>
can pickpocket a monster as much as you want).<br/>
<br/>
Still, I wonder why everytime I&#39;m auctioning &quot;WTB pelts&quot; the usual<br/>
answers come from monks and clerics.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well.  Weight is a big issue for my character.  I travel with 4<br/>
backpacks, a spit, and a large sewing kit (just recently learned that<br/>
sewing kits only weigh 1 lb  vs  backpack&#39;s 3 ... I might be selling<br/>
my backpacks for large sewing kits soon).<br/>
<br/>
As I was saying ... 4 backpacks, a spit, a large sewing kit, a set of<br/>
the 7 tailoring patterns (or whatever I need to complete sets in the<br/>
bank), short beer & spices (beer braised, yum), my trusty scimitar,<br/>
mandolin, hand drum, milk and muffins.  I run around E. Commons<br/>
looking for anything with a pelt.  Now and then I run across an orc<br/>
pawn or a fire beetle, which I dispatch with a quick hack and an<br/>
activation of dissonance.  Pelts and weapons (not orc picks) quickly<br/>
get my weight up, which is why I would rather hunt in cloth (or the<br/>
nude) instead of wearing patchwork, leather, or banded.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll buy a full set of leathers (I think it&#39;s lighter than patchwork,<br/>
no?)  and see if the damage absorbtion decreases my downtime.<br/>
