<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767160894">Spoilers to some of this.....<br/>

While I was hanging around in the Seafarer&#39;s Roost in East Freeport, the<br/>
bard there did some performances.....  here we go:<br/>
 <br/>
Palana Willin says:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Within my head and inside my brain, I hold the power to set free Ogguk<br/>
city.  Open up it&#39;s doors to all that is pretty.  Instead, here I am in a<br/>
pile of my own dung smelling quite dingy.  Drinking Ogre Swill with which i<br/>
am stingy.  I may have the key, but the point is quite moot.  For you see, I<br/>
am nothing more than a dumb, smelly Ogre brute.  Thank you, I hope you<br/>
enjoyed that one.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Talym Shoonstar says:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Ha! That&#39;s right.  Them Ogre&#39;s are as thick as they come.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
This is a reference to the Bartender&#39;s Compendium Quest.  The bartender and<br/>
an ogre in Ogguk are involved.<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Palana Willin says:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;My city is mighty and all shall learn to cower.  We are nothing more than<br/>
the ultimate power.  My city is pure and filled with beautiful charm.  I<br/>
shall conquer you to save you from harm.  My city shall first send it&#39;s<br/>
guards to back you in times of need.  Soon you shall learn to live under my<br/>
laws, indeed.  So now down when you see me and give out my favorite cheer,<br/>
All Hail Antonius Bail, my city is Qeynos and there is nothing to fear.<br/>
 <br/>
Taylm Shoonstar says:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Antonius Bayle is a blithering fool&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
**NOTE** Palana refers to Antonius Bail, while Taylm refers to Antonius<br/>
Bayle.  (Reminds me of princess Lenya/Lenia in Highkeep)<br/>
 <br/>
This is a reference to the fact that Antoniu&#39;s brother, Kane Bayle is<br/>
impersonating Antonius and trying to take over the city.  Kane is evil and<br/>
aligned with the various corrupt Qeynos guards like Lt Dagarok, ever seen<br/>
him with his skeletal pet?  Nobody has gotten much farther than this on this<br/>
one that I could find.  I am currently at dead ends and probably not high<br/>
enough level to get any frather at the present. <br/>
 ---------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Ok, in my screenshot I missed some of this one, but I can tell you this, she<br/>
is singing about Joffrey Clay.<br/>
 <br/>
Palana Willin says:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...You took the lute.  It was my favorite one.  A little white lute, and<br/>
went off to Qeynos.  You took the songs.  They were all special ones.<br/>
Packed them all up.  Off to Qeynos.  You killed the plant.  Put in a deep<br/>
freeze.  Dumped it in the trunk.  With the rest of the refuse.  You, left to<br/>
Qeynos.  You, left to Qeynos.  You, left to Qeynos.  You, left to Qeynos.<br/>
 <br/>
Biggle Lobokker says:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;That voice must have scared him away.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Talym Shoonstar says:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Get off the stage lass.  Can&#39;t ye see he left becase you can&#39;t carry a<br/>
tune.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
No idea, are you certain it refers to Joffrey and not the broken Lute fellow<br/>
in Qeynos?  Joffrey is learning the flute, but it wouldn&#39;t be the first time<br/>
a quest item could be given to multiple people.  I&#39;ll try it next time I go<br/>
to Qeynos. <br/>
 -----------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Those are the three songs I heard.  I went to see Joffrey Clay in the bard&#39;s<br/>
guild in Qeynos, but I couldn&#39;t get him to say anything about Palina, or a<br/>
lute, white, little, or otherwise.  Or special songs, a plant, a deep<br/>
freeze, etc.  But then again, the more minds on that the better.<br/>
 <br/>
Something else intresting I talked to Joffrey Clay about was the brought on<br/>
by his opening statement after hailing him.  He said .... and I am trying to<br/>
learn to play the [flute].  So I asked him &quot;What about the flute?&quot;  And he<br/>
said something like &quot;Do you like my flute, Jusean made it for me&quot;, so I say<br/>
&quot;Who is Jusean?&quot; and he says (paraphrase) &quot;Jusean is blah blah, his father<br/>
was a master instrument crafter, and Jusean has taking up the technique<br/>
quite well&quot;, so I say &quot;Where is Jusean?&quot; and Joffrey says he is close by.<br/>
Well, it turns out  Jusean is right outside the door, he is the guy who<br/>
gives you the bard report quest.  I intergated him about being a instrument<br/>
craftsman with no results.  I tried giving him instrument parts in various<br/>
combinations (there are 2 places in Qeynos to get instrument parts, a<br/>
merchant in the guild sells some and the guy on the dock also does, and<br/>
they DO NOT sell completely the same parts, either.) to no avail.  For<br/>
example, I have him an unfinished brass trumpet, Horn mouthpiece, and<br/>
Trumpet Vales.  Then I gave him the same thing, and some money.  Tried Raw<br/>
Bamboo and Flute mouthpiece, nothing... etc etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve discussed this a while back.  No one has been able to get anywhere on<br/>
this and it may be broken.  I would sugest giving Justean the broken flute<br/>
from the Winds of Karana quest.  Perhaps he will fix it and give it back as<br/>
a magical flute of some type.  About the only lead I have.  I have found<br/>
that Herman the hermit has such a short life span due to druids camping him<br/>
for faction that it may be tough to do.  Still the druid&#39;s may happily give<br/>
up the flute, which likely has little use to them. <br/>
 <br/>
 Anyway, I hope this sparks some new discussion and maybe something will<br/>
come out of this.  All I ask from you guys is that you share any info you<br/>
find with the other bards who read this site/mailing list.<br/>
 <br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mr. Pink</div>
