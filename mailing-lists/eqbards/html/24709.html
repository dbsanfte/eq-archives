<div id="ygrps-yiv-720045435">It was mentioned that the exploit was most likely a bug with charm and memblur.  If you charmed something, had it attack somethin else, then feigned death (as a necro) and/or memblurred, the mob would continue to fight the other mob as that would then be the only thing on the charmed mob&#39;s hate list.  Notice that this has absolutely nothing to do with bards.  Notice that this is becoming the norm for Verant.  &quot;didn&#39;t realize the effect it would have&quot;. kthx~<br/>

  I think the exploit MIGHT be that you can use short duration charm to simply soften up two mobs and then kill both for full xp.  Seems to me a poor exploit tho, especially since we pay for a 39th lvl charm with mana and that charm has no enhancements over song of sirens  and the only benefit is that, we can continue to do something we&#39;ve been doing for 12 lvls...<br/>

  That is ridiculous. I have no idea what exploit they are referring to. But<br/>
  all this does is make it more likely I&#39;m going to get carpal tunnel<br/>
  syndrome working aroung this hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
  My lawyer will clean up the suit, but it will go something like; &quot;You get<br/>
  us addicted and then proceed to add enhancements that are progressively<br/>
  debilitating&quot; :)<br/>

  Anyone know how to hotkey the F8 command?<br/>

  I replied that this will really hurt bards. We will lose the services&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
  of our pets for a short amount of time, will have to charm more (more&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
  mana) and will take more damage because of pets having to be targeted&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
  each attack.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
  &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
  I suggested that they consider lengthening the amount of time a&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
  successful Charm lasts as a way of compensation.. even 5 seconds would&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
  be helpful...&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
  &lt;/tt&gt;<br/>
