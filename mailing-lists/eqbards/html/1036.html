&gt;&gt; 2.  I have heard that Wisps can drop great loot (lightstones) but you<br/>
&gt;&gt; need a magic weapon.  What is the easiest/cheapest magic slashing 1h<br/>
&gt;&gt; weapon that I can lay my hands on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Easiest is probably buying a combine weapon from any of the<br/>
&gt;gypsy camps.  A combine longsword will cost a bard between<br/>
&gt;52.5 to 60 pp with 6/28 stats.  A combine scimitar is 5/24<br/>
&gt;(significantly worse) and only 39.9-45pp, and the aftermarket<br/>
&gt;is slightly bigger since druids can use it.  A combine short<br/>
&gt;sword is around 36.7-42pp at 4/23 (much worse).  If you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;been practicing your piercing skill and want the absolte<br/>
&gt;cheapest, the combine dagger is 3/19 at 31.5-36pp.  (Upper<br/>
&gt;prices are my estimates, lower prices are what I&#39;m charged<br/>
&gt;with 110 charisma.)  You may be able to get a better price<br/>
&gt;from a player getting rid of his combine weapon.  You could<br/>
&gt;also have a shaman or enchanter cast a spell to enhance your<br/>
&gt;charisma to get a better price (which as someone else noted<br/>
&gt;becomes well worth it in this price range).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have to disagree about the scim vs longsword.  A combine Longsword has<br/>
a damage/delay ration of .214, a combine scim has a .208 ratio, a mere<br/>
3% increase for the LS, add to this the fact that it is easier for a low<br/>
strength<br/>
character to consistently max the scim and it becomes a very viable choice.<br/>
<br/>
I actually compared a mino axe to a standard scimitar, and did slightly<br/>
better<br/>
(damage over time) with the scim with no buff songs (85 str) but better with<br/>
the mino axe with JWW stacked with Anthem (105 str)<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 cp&#39;s<br/>
