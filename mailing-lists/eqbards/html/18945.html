<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713746521">I didn&#39;t suggest YOU joined your guild for that sole reason... In <br/>
fact, I have no idea what your reasons for joining your guild <br/>
were.<br/>
<br/>
But, you suggested getting into a &quot;cooperative, team-spirited guild&quot; <br/>
and then commented about the 2 guildmates offering you Singing Steel <br/>
Boots in response to the discussion of prices on Singing Steel.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;m assuming when I think you&#39;re suggesting that getting <br/>
into a good guild would alleviate needing to buy or trade for the <br/>
armor.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that&#39;s how your guild works... what&#39;s yours is theirs<br/>
and <br/>
theirs is yours... I think it&#39;s very noble.  I play my character <br/>
differently, and I would not join a guild expecting it to work the<br/>
way <br/>
yours does or because I knew it worked the way yours does.  I&#39;m not <br/>
saying I&#39;d never accept a gift like that (I have) and I&#39;m not saying<br/>
I <br/>
would never offer a gift like that (I have).  But, pricing on all <br/>
items in the game is very important to me, because I intend (I may<br/>
not <br/>
succeed) to acquire all the items I want/need through my own means.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to offend... just give my point of view. :)<br/>
