<div id="ygrps-yiv-105781313">Kalera... You sound familiar. Didn&#39;t you die a<br/>
gruesome death with me and Rymth in the assasain room?<br/>
I had no idea it was you, Miriana. (Was it? I remember<br/>
a lass in almost full lambent, with a rubi bp and a<br/>
guise. And the LoD tag. And the level was about<br/>
right...) Shoulda said something, Kambei speaks highly<br/>
of you. (Prolly just talks about how obnoxious I am.)<br/>

Sylly)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I couldn&#39;t resist the pun on your last name<br/>
Harmonic :P.<br/>
<br/>
Harmonic, having never been on a succesful Dragon raid<br/>
on Innoruuk I&#39;m<br/>
surprised to see your... confidence by which say these<br/>
things.<br/>

<br/>
P.P.P.S. The only reason we put pressure on ML and<br/>
Storm to yield to us<br/>
was because one of our members was bound on the<br/>
pedestal where Vox sits<br/>
from a previous Vox killing and gated back without<br/>
remembering to<br/>
rebind.<br/>
Hence, getting him back was a high priority of ours.<br/>
