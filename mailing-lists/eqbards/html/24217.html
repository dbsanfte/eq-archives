&gt;it&#39;s not even worth that much effort.  the time it would take to sit, unmem<br/>
&gt;one song, mem DDD, use DDD, sit, unmem DDD, remem other song is too much<br/>
&gt;effort for this song.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>30 seconds is too much work for 400+ damage?  heh, you really ARE lazy... KIDDING.<br/>
by the way, was doing hunter/foragers for a bit last night and had 0 resists in about<br/>
6 uses.  one partial did 305 instead of 435.  all the rest were full for 435.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s another subject.  i don&#39;t think bard melee is pitiful, just the least<br/>
&gt;of the melee classes.  bard melee+SSS+songs pushes us way up on the list,<br/>
&gt;though i know that is not what you said is pitiful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the sake of brevity, i&#39;ll just point to my earlier <br/>
&gt; &gt; posts where i pointed out when an<br/>
&gt; &gt; excellent time to use this song was, which wouldn&#39;t mess up <br/>
&gt; &gt; the enchanter at all and would<br/>
&gt; &gt; do a significant amount of damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;again, the damage you do is not even worth the effort, and not worth the<br/>
&gt;mana the healer will spend on fixing the damage you took while the enchanter<br/>
&gt;messed the 2-4 mobs beating on you that DDD hit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like i said, in my situation, i generally play cantana, nivs, and something else.  as long<br/>
as i don&#39;t dip below 2 bubbles of health in that time, which i generally don&#39;t with a decent<br/>
enchanter, i heal myself for &#39;&#39;free&#39;&#39;, due to my normal twist.</div>
