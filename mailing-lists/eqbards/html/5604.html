A Call for Advanced Player Guides <br/>
I&#39;m pleased to announce that we will soon begin overhauling our Player Guide<br/>
section. The majority of our current guides were written during EQ&#39;s third<br/>
phase of beta testing! At this time we are seeking new advanced guides<br/>
written by players who have gained considerable experience in his or her<br/>
class. <br/>
<br/>
One thought we had was to reward guilds that submitted an advanced guide by<br/>
posting prominent hyperlink to the guild&#39;s homepage on any of the content<br/>
written by the guild that was submitted and published on EQV. Of course,<br/>
submissions from individuals are still most definitely welcomed. <br/>
<br/>
Advance Player Guide submissions should be sent via email as an attached<br/>
file (any popular text format would do). And of course all submissions<br/>
should be sent to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aurum@...">aurum@...</a>.</div>
