<br/>
Adventuring in my favored zone of the West Commonlands near Freeport, I<br/>
stumbled upon an interesting fact which has now saved my life numerous times<br/>
- the Accelerando OVERCOMES a GhoulRoot spell!  <br/>
<br/>
While adventuring in this zone with my two other regular fighting companions<br/>
(a cleric and a warrior), we decided to begin taking on the ghouls that<br/>
occasionally spawn at the tower along the north wall.  Because I am the<br/>
speedy one of the bunch, i run up and bait the ghoul out.  Well lo and<br/>
behold he roots me!  In my scramble to keep myself healed, I hit my hot key<br/>
to the accelerando instead and I can suddenly move, even though the<br/>
GhoulRoot was still on me.  Needless to say the next time we got in a fight<br/>
with the ghouls I tried this again, and it worked again.  It also worked for<br/>
other members of my party, after they were rooted.<br/>
<br/>
I have not personally been up against a Shaman or Cleric type outdoors yet,<br/>
so I do not know if this technique will work on their version of root.  Does<br/>
anyone else know?<br/>
