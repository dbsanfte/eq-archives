 </span></blockquote>  You sure those values are high enough?  I mean you could come up<br/>
  with some really good stories with stats like those.  But is it <br/>

  Harmonic, swabbing the decks once again.<br/>
<br/>
  PS&gt; That song would be called, Harmonic is a God if it were true.<br/>
<br/>
  PSS&gt; John(tm) what would happen if the delay on a weapon was<br/>
       effectively 0?  How does that work?<br/>

Almost Harm, you have to weave it with:<br/>
<br/>
Rokenn&#39;s Resounding Rhyme<br/>
Taget: single<br/>
-100% to all resits<br/>
-99% attack speed<br/>
500x3 Dot effect<br/>
<br/>
checks for save vs poison (-100 to save)<br/>
<br/>
Then you could solo naggy :)</div>
