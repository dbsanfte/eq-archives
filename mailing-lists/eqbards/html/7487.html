<div id="ygrps-yiv-316778392">I am afraid this might be getting out of hand but I value your opinion and<br/>
want to continue.<br/>
<br/>
Now that would be boring.  Reduces the game to an arcade game.  wait that&#39;s<br/>
why I don&#39;t play Quake, Diablo, etc.  I want a death penalty.  But losing an<br/>
entire night of playing, not just its gains mind you but a sizeable chunk of<br/>
the actual playing time, is too harsh.  especially when its just because you<br/>
had the misfortune to zone into a 4 griffene train on the bridge in N<br/>
karana.  My game play two nights ago was literally.  Awake in east Karana.<br/>
Zone into N Karana.  Never even appear there, just zoned for 6 minutes.<br/>
Appeared in Halas.  Run to N Karana to get my body whcih had both my drums<br/>
on it since I was doing corpse retrieval at the time anyhow.  Run to Qeynos,<br/>
my original destination.  Camp.  Wow, that was fun.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t disagree with you too often Michael, you hae a good perspective on<br/>
most things I think.  On this though i think you are missing the real<br/>
penalty a lot of us pay for dying.  Death = no playing.  This rule applies<br/>
to 90% of the people I personally know who play during at least 50% of their<br/>
playing sessions.  That&#39;s proabably a defining reason why only one person I<br/>
personally know is over 24th level.  He made 30 while on a two week vacation<br/>
with a broken leg.  He is still at 30 and hating his &#39;Hell&#39; level big time<br/>
now that he can&#39;t play any more than the rest of us and can&#39;t group with us.<br/>

i&#39;ve never played, but i heard in quake 2 if you die you respawn right away<br/>
in the same area and can start killing again with absolutely no downtime or<br/>
zoning.<br/>
