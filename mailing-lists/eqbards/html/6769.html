&gt; you have said you use it depending on the situation, so it sounds like a<br/>

avoiding being attacked via melee.  That&#39;s the distinction I&#39;m<br/>
trying to make, and why I think it&#39;s really stupid that our<br/>
defensive equipment and skills cap at just slightly higher<br/>
than a cleric&#39;s.<br/>
