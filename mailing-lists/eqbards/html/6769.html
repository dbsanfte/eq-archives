&gt; &gt;That clerics are weak at melee is not the point.  The point is<br/>

&gt; or like bard nuking? Doing the DDD/CoD/Warmth/Heal dance does a LOT of<br/>
&gt; damage in group pulls. I mean criminy I learned about it on this list. My<br/>
&gt; group loves it as a new addition,  I understand that will change later, but<br/>
&gt; you have said you use it depending on the situation, so it sounds like a<br/>
&gt; viable option other than melee.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are using it to avoid attacking via melee.  You are not<br/>
avoiding being attacked via melee.  That&#39;s the distinction I&#39;m<br/>
trying to make, and why I think it&#39;s really stupid that our<br/>
defensive equipment and skills cap at just slightly higher<br/>
than a cleric&#39;s.<br/>
