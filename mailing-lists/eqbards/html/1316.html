<div id="ygrps-yiv-745647054">Hello all ,<br/>
	This post isn&#39;t very bard oriented , but i thought maybe someone out <br/>
there could help me. I&#39;ve been in BB , and Cb recently , and i&#39;ve picked up a <br/>
buncha bandit tongues. I know they&#39;re for a quest , and my question is , <br/>
where does the quest start ? can&#39;t find the darned thing anywhere , i assumed <br/>
Kaladim since they&#39;re the BB bandits , but it either wasn&#39;t there , or i <br/>
missed someone ( very very possible). And no one one my server seems to <br/>
know.(been asking around) If anyone could help me out it would be very <br/>
appreciated. Oh and BTW , if anyone out here has done it , is it worth it ? <br/>
not so much for a reward , but in the not-lame sense .  rewards are good <br/>
though.<br/>
