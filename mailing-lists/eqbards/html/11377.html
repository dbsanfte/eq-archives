<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326366379">Was in a full group tonight with 2 clerics, shaman, paladin and an<br/>
additional bard doing MM yard trash.  Two clerics.  A shaman.  LOH.  How<br/>
could I die?<br/>
<br/>
Foolish, yes I know.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, my frustration stems from two points, one: lullaby.  I have bugged<br/>
and petitioned it until my face is blue but like alchemy, Verant just<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any idea what going on in the code.  The programmers who did EQ<br/>
are all long gone, the people maintaining the source tree are clearly not<br/>
familiar with err... ummm... anything.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I was twisting like mad, I was keeping up Guardian+Elemental+Chant<br/>
or Anthem/Bellow/Lullaby, depending on the pull, switching out weapons and<br/>
instruments for maximum effect.  I would invis between pulls.  I was<br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
The other bard?<br/>
<br/>
He equips his lute and plays hymn non stop.  For all I know he went afk but<br/>
he was the toast the group, everyone complimenting him, the mm shield was to<br/>
be given to him if it pop&#39;d, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Not a single person mentions, hey look at all the spells I resisted or way<br/>
to pin down those other 2-3 mobs we didn&#39;t mean to pull because it cheaper<br/>
to run up and whack something than burn an arrow and we can&#39;t spell /assist.<br/>
Bards are so misunderstood that it pains me.  I know its wrong but I was<br/>
hoping they all got slicked after I left.<br/>
<br/>
Karma was at work: I left, zoned back to lfay to camp and someone trained a<br/>
brownie outcast on me.  At least it was over quick, but not before I got<br/>
slammed backwards and fell through the world to die.  Oh well, at least we<br/>
have the tools to do outdoors CR&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m convinced no good deed goes unpunished so from now on I&#39;m gonna be like<br/>
every other bard, bellowing my brains out during fights and playing hymn<br/>
nonstop.  Screw that HOWTO I wrote on twisting songs: Its just not worth it.<br/>
