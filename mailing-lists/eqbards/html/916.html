<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, as I said before I haven&#39;t yet played in commercial. Now that I am <br/>
&gt;settled with moving and all and getting EQ ready, can anyone (especially <br/>
&gt;those that have played on more than one server) give me any suggestions as <br/>
&gt;to what the best servers are to play on?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am currently roaming several planes of Norrath, though Fennin Ro is my<br/>
primary home. I don&#39;t have significant problems with any of them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The group that I was always with in P4 is on Veeshan, and they are right <br/>
&gt;about to hit 50th level (all of them!)...and, well - they are pure <br/>
&gt;powergamers. I was wanting to join them, but there is no way I could keep up <br/>
&gt;with them. Actually, I&#39;m thinking of taking it easy. I did all the <br/>
&gt;powergaming I need during beta. I would like to seriously get into the RP <br/>
&gt;aspect of the game (or help to foster it).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, this will continue to be a problem in a world that rewards combat<br/>
heavily, especially if you are a hybrid profession.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was on Fennin Ro at that time, and that server was a nightmare. I guess <br/>
&gt;it&#39;s ok now? I heard that during beginning of commercial Fennin was even <br/>
&gt;more crowded than before. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been on Fennin Ro since the release (and played there in P4). I&#39;ve<br/>
never had a problem with it. Most of the hype seemed to be that people just<br/>
bottlenecked in the areas immediately around cities, rather than branching<br/>
out a bit. Also, I don&#39;t spend a great deal of time in the dungeons<br/>
(Blackburrow, Crushbone, etc) and I&#39;ve seen them VERY crowded on Fennin at<br/>
prime time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Especially if there are any particular servers I should stay away from. I am <br/>
&gt;thinking getting on the newest server would be ideal, though I don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt;which one is newest. Cazic?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Newest server is Erollisi Marr. Second newest is Rodcet Nife.<br/>
