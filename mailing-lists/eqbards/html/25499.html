<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684445719">The mobs aren&#39;t stupider, getting assistance just isn&#39;t automatic.<br/>
Sometimes, more often for higher level mobs, the mob will &quot;call for help&quot;.<br/>
You&#39;ll hear it call when it does and then look out!  Mobs that you would<br/>
expect to &quot;swarm&quot; in EQ will come running for you from a far greater agro<br/>
range than you might expect.  So while those other hobgoblins won&#39;t always<br/>
assist, when they do it will be very painful.<br/>

<br/>
First off, the newbie levels are IMO just like EQ with the small difference<br/>
that solo is easier and corpse recovery is non existent. I actually let my<br/>
self get killed to get back to town instead of running *shrug* There was no<br/>
death penalty..<br/>
<br/>
I felt that the mobs where more &quot;stupid&quot; than in EQ. Even hobgoblins dont<br/>
assist eachother when youre alone against them.<br/>
*shrug* <br/>
I also miss newbie dungeons. All battle at lower levels is in the open. My<br/>
overall impression was the there really wasent many dungeons.. Hope they add<br/>
some nice ones ala Crushbone, BlackBurrow, Befallen etc.. Dungeon fighting<br/>
is fun :)<br/>
I also like the prospect of getting into some serius PvP Something i havent<br/>
done since the days of Meridian 59 *grin*<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  The three <br/>
&gt; biggest improvements I think they have made are: (1) Quests: <br/>
&gt; Apparently they <br/>
&gt; have some sort of questing journal that helps you keep track <br/>
&gt; of all of the <br/>
&gt; quests you have taken part in and remind you what the next <br/>
&gt; step is that you <br/>
&gt; need to take. This includes picking up a drop from a mob that <br/>
&gt; is part of a <br/>
&gt; quest. No more spamming a zone asking if anyone knows what <br/>
&gt; the Raw Sword is <br/>
&gt; for or something like that. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye the /quest command is soooeeee nice....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, the quests are supposed to <br/>
&gt; change for each <br/>
&gt; character so they are level specific. No more high levels <br/>
&gt; camping low level <br/>
&gt; quests for no experience. (2) Travel: I guess there are <br/>
&gt; horses that you can <br/>
&gt; rent from NPCs which run you from stable to stable at a very <br/>
&gt; fast rate. You <br/>
&gt; can jump off at any time or continue to the destination. <br/>
&gt; Nobody has to waste <br/>
&gt; fifteen minutes of valuable playing time running across West <br/>
&gt; Karana. (3) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mhh debatable..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Death: Whether it is realistic or not, players retain all of <br/>
&gt; their equipment <br/>
&gt; after death. Levels can&#39;t be lost due to death either. <br/>
&gt; Experience loss can be <br/>
&gt; regained by returning to the place of death (marked by a <br/>
&gt; gravestone) and <br/>
&gt; praying. There is also a loss of constitution points which <br/>
&gt; can be bought back <br/>
&gt; from a merchant. Clerics can also revive experience and <br/>
&gt; constitution loss <br/>
&gt; (just like EQ, but I thought I should mention it).<br/>
&gt;        There are other things that I like about DAoC also, <br/>
&gt; but these are the <br/>
&gt; biggees in my estimation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
