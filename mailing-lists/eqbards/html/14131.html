<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421058667">Oh yes..  Virtually every mob has a movement and idle sound of some sort.<br/>
The sounds effects in EQ are the best of any game I&#39;ve every played.  That&#39;s<br/>
the one thing that I have *never* seen a complaint about in any forum.<br/>
There aren&#39;t any sounds that I can think of in the game that sound &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>
The next time you play, pay attention to some of the sounds and try to<br/>
imagine how they came up with them.  Ambient sounds, beetles, spiders<br/>
walking, snakes hissing, frogloks (splicka, splicka, splicka), Aviaks,<br/>
lizards in CT, giants, Spectres, Ghouls...  The sounds effects in EQ are a<br/>
work of art that surpass the graphics by a healthy margin imo.<br/>
<br/>
FYI: I&#39;m using Soundblaster Live!<br/>

&gt; Yeah, I never had any idea.  Apparently bears grumble as they walk, wolves<br/>
&gt; howl, giant beetles and spiders make funny chittering noises when<br/>
&gt; they walk?<br/>
&gt; I assume since no one has laughed and said I was insane that these sounds<br/>
&gt; really occur.  I was floored the first time a groupmate asked why I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; hear a giant coming.  I had no clue what he meant.<br/>
