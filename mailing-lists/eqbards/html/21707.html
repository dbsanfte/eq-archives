<div id="ygrps-yiv-298699024">Pslams of Vitality - The song works. I did not ever have an instance where I<br/>
was cured and still lost HP&#39;s. I did however get the message that I was<br/>
cured when I was already cured. This should be fixed. <br/>
Solon&#39;s Bewitching Bravura - Tested on PvP and non-PVP, there is no<br/>
difference. You cannot refresh charm. <br/>
Jonthan&#39;s Provocation - Working as intended. <br/>
Song of Highsun - It was resisted. If anyone of the effects on a<br/>
mutli-effect spell are resisted, the whole song/spell is resisted. By<br/>
design. <br/>
