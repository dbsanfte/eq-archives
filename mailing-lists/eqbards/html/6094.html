<div id="ygrps-yiv-241910596">That&#39;s because charm works like Lullaby, nix&#39;s the aggression list of the<br/>
monster, with the only person remaining on the list being you as the caster of<br/>
the effect.<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until you are level 40 though, and the fun with giants really begins.<br/>
Every other class I know except druids whines they can&#39;t solo generally, and I<br/>
do so often. 2 giants, a giant + griffin, etc are extremely easy to control.<br/>
However, I do not use selo&#39;s, because if you get bashed you are at the giant&#39;s<br/>
mercy. For soloing I use Journeyman Boots. I have also managed to kill a few<br/>
giants solo using chains and fear, but it&#39;s a much harder battle, and I have to<br/>
break contact and heal with lute at least twice to kill it entirely (note what<br/>
weapons you use play a large part in what you can realistically solo).</div>
