<div id="ygrps-yiv-308695066">I found the same thing in Paw a couple of weeks ago.  There was a dark elf<br/>
necromancer named Nixx Nenix roaming Paw.  I was just coming out after<br/>
successfully defeating Shaman Ren Rex and saw a dark elf swimming.  I<br/>
figured it was another player until he tagged with a damage over time (DOT).<br/>
I made it to the zone before he could catch me and zoned out and the DOT<br/>
still took me down 3 and 1/2 bubbles of health (I had 571 hit points at<br/>
level 19).<br/>

&gt; Apologize beforehand for adding to the increasing number of off topic<br/>
&gt; posts<br/>
&gt; on this list but I had an encounter last night with a NPC in Highpass hold<br/>
&gt; that I had never seen or heard of before.  I was camping the Mucktail site<br/>
&gt; with a level 29 cleric.  While we were waiting, we start to see messages<br/>
&gt; scroll through &quot;Cytodl Krish begins to cast a spell&quot;.  Next thing we know<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; get attacked by a high level DE necro.  He conned red to me (19 bard) and<br/>
&gt; blue to the 29 cleric.  Because we were totally caught by surprise, we<br/>
&gt; both<br/>
&gt; had to make a run for the Keep zone.  We fully recharged and went out<br/>
&gt; looking for him.  I was singing invis and had elemental and purifying<br/>
&gt; ryhthms ready to weave.  We finally found the necro wandering around the<br/>
&gt; zone, with a bunch of corpses in his wake.  We attacked at the cleric<br/>
&gt; tried<br/>
&gt; rooting him several times. He kept resisting and the cleric was OOM (oops,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; used an acronym).  We had to run to the border again.  We recharged and<br/>
&gt; tracked him down once again.  The second time, the cleric just kept<br/>
&gt; smiting<br/>
&gt; him and we eventually killed him.  All told did over 800 damage to him.<br/>
&gt; He<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t drop any loot which was a disappointment.  When we killed him, the<br/>
&gt; factions affected, which all got worse, were The Dead, King and Queen of<br/>
&gt; some wierd name, Keepers of the Art, and Eldritch Collective.  After the<br/>
&gt; fight, we asked around if anyone had ever seen/heard of this NPC before.<br/>
&gt; No<br/>
&gt; one in the zone had heard of him.  Was wondering if anyone on this list<br/>
&gt; could shed some light on his background?  Also wanted to warn everyone in<br/>
&gt; case they ran into him and they were less level 30 they should be prepared<br/>
&gt; to run. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, by the way he was acting, almost 100% certain it wasn&#39;t a GM<br/>
&gt; controlled<br/>
&gt; NPC.<br/>
