<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268235359"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   Wizards do more?  Thats a joke.  They are snowflake button pressers<br/>
&gt;   and gaters.  Yeah i&#39;ve seen a wizard stun or root something but rarely<br/>
&gt;   in a well balanced group.  mumble: wizards have more... &lt;chuckle&gt;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t agree more.  The wizards job is to kill stuff.  on bad pulls<br/>
the wizards job is to kill stuff -- faster.  The only hard part about<br/>
playing a wizard is figuring out when you can blast and not pull,<br/>
and when you can blast and med and still not pull, and thats&#39;s not <br/>
exactly hard.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Enchanters and Bards are the most situation adapative classes and<br/>
&gt;   that makes them the hardest to teach correct gameplay.  All the<br/>
&gt;   other classes are one or two tracked minded with very little <br/>
&gt;   strategy based thinking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Might add shaman to this list, they have a lot of different<br/>
spells, and deciding when to cast which isn&#39;t the easiest.<br/>
I still chuckle to myself as I watch shamans spend half the fight<br/>
trying to slow the target, at which time the wizard stands up and<br/>
finishes it off in 10 seconds.</div>
