<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-588490029">30th.  A good example is last nite.  I was grouped with an enchanter and the<br/>
spells I was twisting was Fulfil&#39;s, Hymn, and Guardian.  Not exactly an<br/>
optimal use of my abilities.  All AoE songs were off limits because the<br/>
&#39;chanter was mezzing.  He was Alacrity&#39;ing all four tanks (including me) and<br/>
never went oom the entire night.  Once he got down to 10% after fighting 8<br/>
or 9 mobs in rapid succession.  Having a cleric, druid, or even Paladin<br/>
would have been far more effective for the group but luckily they were all<br/>
friends.  I was helpful against some of the casters for resist buffing, but<br/>
half the time the &#39;chanter was able to keep 3 mobs mezzed and stun the<br/>
caster continuously without going oom.<br/>

what level are you?  i don&#39;t think i was ever at a level where i didn&#39;t want<br/>
an<br/>
enchanter in the group except when i was soloing thru level 5.</div>
