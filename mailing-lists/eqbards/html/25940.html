<div id="ygrps-yiv-974025501">Everything I&#39;ve seen so far is bought.  Battle cry of the vahl shir in the <br/>
val shir city (didn&#39;t get that one myself so don&#39;t know it&#39;s exact loc).<br/>
<br/>
And the rest as well as come &quot;combine&quot; instruments which I don&#39;t know if <br/>
they are better than normal or not, just more expensive, can be bought in <br/>
Katta Castellum.<br/>
<br/>
When you zone in from Tenebrous mountains, go immediately right, and down <br/>
there are some big doors with guards, go inside and there are merchants in <br/>
a big hall.  Take another right and down at the end are the bardic <br/>
merchants.  The songs are on two different or possibly 3 merchants, so take <br/>
a list and check it twice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps:  I got locked up singing the friggin dex song Dancing Sword thing... <br/>
had to camp out...   so it&#39;s still bugged<br/>
