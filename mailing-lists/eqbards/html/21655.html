&gt;asking for a group, i often end up turning down 2-3 groups. That said, i<br/>
&gt;moved away from kunark to solo some giants (where i&#39;m still getting tells<br/>
&gt;without advertising asking if i want to group).  on a side note, i want to<br/>
&gt;thank the people that posted stuff about rathe mountains here and there in<br/>
&gt;the past, I&#39;ve taken this info and put it to very good use. I have very<br/>
&gt;little time lately to play, so i try to make the most of my time and thats<br/>
&gt;exactly how i spend it, charming giants (which is a hell of alot funner then<br/>
&gt;a ridge group in dreadlands).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not only is my xp actually moving fast in a hell level, but the cash is a<br/>
&gt;bonus too. In only about 2 and half-3 hours or so, i now have 8 rubies on me<br/>
&gt;(i buy them to drop the cash weight) and have gotten well over a bub of xp<br/>
&gt;(which in a hell level means about 2-3 bubs normally). Im not a super charm<br/>
&gt;kiter yet as some people are but im improving, and its sometimes hard to<br/>
&gt;find giants there when other groups are camping them.  Mind you i still can<br/>
&gt;drop 3-4 of them before they pull their second one.  Another thing that is<br/>
&gt;great about them is they max lev at 37, which is same as our low lev charm<br/>
&gt;song so no need for mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyways, thanks for the suggestions to go kill the giants, and also thanks<br/>
&gt;for the suggestion on buying rubies with the cash and reselling afterwards<br/>
&gt;at a loss of about 10-12pp per gem (big deal).<br/>

&gt;P.S. Nothing quite as satisfying watching a 3 druid and a shaman group<br/>
&gt;sitting there while you finish off a couple of giants.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lol. Good to hear Minkin! I am in the same boat as you. I usually can only <br/>
play for 1.5 to 3 hours tops and it&#39;s hard to find a group, get together, <br/>
find a hunting spot and hunt before I have to leave.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 40 as well and find the giant hunting a very nice alternative (I <br/>
have yet to get a forest loop from these stingy buggers), and the money is <br/>
pretty decent from all the tunics and various weaps I get off of &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
However, it can get to be a bit tedious after a while, so I&#39;ve journied to <br/>
City of Mist and am still getting pretty good experience as these groups <br/>
love having a bard. Not a great place during off hours, but I&#39;m going to <br/>
explore the emerald jungle area and see if I can charm/kite around there. <br/>
The trees will make it difficult, but I&#39;ll see if I can find a clearing <br/>
somewhere as I like to use 3rd person perspective when charming.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m on Bertoxxulous so CoM hunters may be different, but there usually <br/>
is only 1 or 2 groups hunting here, and it was fun to use my lament and <br/>
pull for the group, and charming the extra if we get 2 of them.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, at my current level I find that in a group during combat I&#39;m <br/>
either weaving Celerity and Arms with either mana/hymn (for groups with <br/>
more tanks than casters, also improves my melee skills which have waned due <br/>
to all my charm/kiting)or using my 2 chants (w/tambourine) with mana or <br/>
hymn. Kind of curious about what other bards like to weave in a group at <br/>
level 40. I agree with previous bards that throwing in manasong during <br/>
combat is more of a gesture than it is effective, but I refuse to just sing <br/>
manasong.<br/>
