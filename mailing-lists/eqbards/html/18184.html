<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902331215">Bleh, who reads the docs anyhow? And when you do - bah!<br/>
<br/>
Heh, got my retail version yesterday via Fed Ex. I pre-ordered thru EB for a<br/>
retail version just to have the box ver (got a pewter Iskar guy in the box -<br/>
I think it was a spiff for the pre-order.)  Anywho... I go to read thru the<br/>
doc to see if Verant has anything interesting to say.  Well, the manual in<br/>
the retail version is a &lt;expletive strong enough not yet invented - deleted&gt;<br/>
joke!  Ok, there is some debate as to whether Brad, Smed, Gordo, GZ, etal<br/>
actually play the game but there is *no doubt* that the user manual ppl have<br/>
only just glanced at it (prolly had some programmers walk them thru stuff)<br/>
and there is **NO DOUBT** that ***N*O*B*O*D*Y***  who ever played the game<br/>
proof read the manual.  There are errors so blatant that it simply astounded<br/>
me.  They have a nice table to try to explain corpse decay times - well,<br/>
they tell you that your level whatever corpse will last 7 days online and 24<br/>
hours offline.  And there were others that were just as bad.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I am all wrong about the ppl there not really playing the game.<br/>
Maybe they are too busy farming the new zones to do more than merely glance<br/>
at the product they ship to customers.  Or maybe that tank strategy game is<br/>
really fabulous and all 200k of us eq dorks are missing the boat.<br/>
<br/>
Gah - virus - schmirus - they have troubles bigger than that.<br/>

&gt; Actually they&#39;ve publicly appologised on their newsgroups but yes, they<br/>
&gt; should put it in the patch message.  However they did re-patch the files<br/>
&gt; with clean ones so anyone that didn&#39;t read the boards is safe now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However:  They should have notified people via a patch message.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The worst part about this is that they haven&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; &gt; informed anyone via login or on their website that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they downloaded the infected files.  So anyone who </span></blockquote></div>
