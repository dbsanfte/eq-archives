<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813132394">Sorry to hear about this. But it&#39;s not too surprising actually. Verant<br/>
hasn&#39;t typically been very supportive of any type of play other than<br/>
questing and killing. I believe their philosophy is that tradesskills are<br/>
a means to more quests.<br/>

It probably matters little to those of high level, but as someone who<br/>
decided to try a new idea and roleplay a low level merchant/tradeskill<br/>
character on the new deity server I am really torqued off.<br/>
<br/>
Because some people exploited an mistake in the fish fillet/ fresh fish<br/>
prices to make exorbitant amounts of money on Sullon Verant in typical<br/>
fashion has responded childishly by choosing the worst possible solution.<br/>
<br/>
There I was happily fishing/baking my way to being able to slowly work up<br/>
some tradeskills when suddenly the patch comes down today.<br/>
<br/>
Now the one way to actually make some small amount of money without<br/>
endlessly fighting and camping and killing is gone.&nbsp; A fisher can now<br/>
no longer make even the small amount of slow money they once could by<br/>
fishing then baking their catch and selling what they made.<br/>
<br/>
It would have been a simple change to just make merchants charge more for<br/>
the Fresh Fish they sell and eliminate the infinite profit syndrome that<br/>
caused the problem, but that would not allow them to strike back at those<br/>
who bested them...<br/>
