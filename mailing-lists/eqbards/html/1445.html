under the influence of one speed-altering effect at a time.<br/>
If you have SoW on and you start and stop Accelerando, the SoW<br/>
icon will stay up but the SoW effect will be gone.<br/>
<br/>
Since root and snare are speed-altering effects, one tick of<br/>
Accelerando will negate them.  I use it all the time to break<br/>
party members free from ghouls and shamen/soothsayers.  I<br/>
figure since I suffer the negative of this bug with SoW (druid<br/>
and shamen friends are reluctant to group with me), I might as<br/>
well enjoy the positive with root.<br/>
<br/>
One last tip - Accelerando doesn&#39;t work underground, so this<br/>
trick doesn&#39;t work underground.<br/>
