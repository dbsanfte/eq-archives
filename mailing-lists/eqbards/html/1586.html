<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261210737">Last night I duelled a friend and did some research on this.<br/>
<br/>
Background:<br/>
<br/>
Jyzan - level 24 bard<br/>
Str 104<br/>
Dex 107<br/>
Cha 76   (I&#39;m wearing a grotesque mask)<br/>
<br/>
Singing:  125<br/>
Brass: 76<br/>
String: 125<br/>
<br/>
When singing Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord, it was doing 9 damage per tick.  Chords<br/>
of Dissonance was doing 7.  Denon&#39;s also decreased the target&#39;s AC by 9, which<br/>
is very good.<br/>
<br/>
When playing their respective instruments, Denon&#39;s was going 19 damage per tick,<br/>
while Chords was doing something like 15.  Denon&#39;s was also decreasing AC by 19,<br/>
which is a LOT.  This is MORE than taking off a steel breastplate and going<br/>
barechested.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that these songs are &quot;damage over time&quot; songs, so that once you<br/>
make them &quot;wince&quot; once, it will damage them 2 more times, so if I were to juggle<br/>
these two songs and Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow, here are the effects I would have:<br/>
<br/>
Tick 1:  Denon&#39;s makes them wince for 9, and reduces their AC by 9<br/>
Tick 2:  Chords for 7, Denon for 9, AC still reduced<br/>
Tick 3:  Bellow for 13, Chords for 7, Denon for 9, AC still reduced.<br/>
<br/>
The net result of all this:  54 damage, AC reduced by 9.<br/>
<br/>
Compare this to most people&#39;s tactics, which is Bellowing all three rounds, for<br/>
a net damage of 39 and no AC reduction.  Over a long fight, this is a<br/>
significant difference.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing that we tested... Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding, in addition to<br/>
reducing attack speeds, lowered AC by 6.<br/>
