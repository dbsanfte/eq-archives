<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444993376"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; mobs seem to take less damage than from Bellow even when we <br/>
&gt; are fighting one<br/>
&gt; at a time.  With multiple mobs Psalm is awesome.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, bellow would be good, I always forget about Bellow. Whether PoW is<br/>
better for 1 mob depends on how much AC is added I suppose, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At what point do mobs start attacking more often?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am thinking like monks and monk-skellies in the Lake of Ill Omen, I am<br/>
sure there are lots of hasted and/or double attack  mobs can&#39;t think of at<br/>
the moment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is Largo&#39;s safe in Dalnir&#39;s?  I was hesitant to use it given the three<br/>
&gt; levels in Dalnir&#39;s.  Has anyone else had this song causing <br/>
&gt; mobs to teleport<br/>
&gt; to them or cast on them from different levels?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought Z-axis was fixed, I know I had no problem with AE in Highpass<br/>
keep.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	Kit<br/>
&gt; 	&quot;Remember I&#39;m 50% serious, 50% devil&#39;s advocate.  It&#39;s just my<br/>
&gt; nature.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Noooo problem at all, I think it is a good discussion to have publicly, it&#39;s<br/>
a real bard issue. And besides, I COUNT on discussions like this to weed out<br/>
my misconceptions, I get a lot of things wrong, and spouting off on this<br/>
list will often get me a speedy correction :o)<br/>
