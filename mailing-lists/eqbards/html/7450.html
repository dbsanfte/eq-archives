<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084566655">Ok!!  *grin*  here is an Idea, that Im SURE Varant will aggree with to let<br/>
us get bind.... ready...:)<br/>
<br/>
It wont require a reagent.  It wont even require a spell.  Here is what you<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
1st.  Sing the magic /auction song.   You have to word it just right though.<br/>
The most successful version that I have used is as follows.....<br/>
<br/>
/auction Will pay 2 Platnum for bind to first one to /tell me!!!<br/>
<br/>
You will then have to click on your Persona screen.  Select 2 platnum and<br/>
give it to another player.  Casting time on this will be about 2-3 minutes.<br/>
( I have never waited longer than 10 minutes ).  With the time you save you<br/>
can get into battle quicker and make up the lost loot.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that Verant will not approve this though:(  It is just to easy :)<br/>

Me? I&#39;m sick of it. We are hybrids. Verant has stated again and again<br/>
hybrids<br/>
will not get bind. Therefore WE will not get bind.<br/>
