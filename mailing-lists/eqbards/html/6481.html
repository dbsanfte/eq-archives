<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658735517"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have read several postings on this instrument and asked people in-game.  <br/>
&gt;The postings and opinions have not been consistent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I now have one and I am told it increases non-self healing rate.  I plan to <br/>
&gt;test this tonight; I am interested in others&#39; experiences as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My primary question though is: what is it worth?  Has anyone bought one, <br/>
&gt;sold one, or seen one bought or sold?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have one also.  I havent seen any difference between it and a regular <br/>
lute.  (they weigh the same, appear to do exactly the same thing)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, as has been suggested here in the past, it is a quest item? <br/>
However, the description doesnt say LORE ITEM on it. Maybe Verant hasn&#39;t <br/>
implemented what it is supposed to do into the game yet? When you test it, <br/>
could you please post the results here?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was given mine by a guildmate, but I have seen them for trade only on <br/>
Povar. (although I admit, being poor right now, I usually ignore the auction <br/>
channel)<br/>
