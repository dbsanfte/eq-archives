<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889243290">i think plate looks a lot better than banded, so i think bronze for your<br/>
visible pieces is good (i think looks are important hehe).  i would not use<br/>
anything but magical items/jewelry in all other slots.<br/>
<br/>
i try to maximize str/dex/agi (battle bard stats), so i went with plat fire<br/>
emerald rings instead.  the silver ones are 3str/3dex.  don&#39;t know what your<br/>
veil is but to make up for cha lost on rings (if you went with fire emerald)<br/>
there is a star ruby veil that is Cha/Dex.  as far as stamina, it is<br/>
probably the least important stat.  for the extra cash, i would save up for<br/>
a golden black pearl choker, 7dex/7agi and much better than the golden opal<br/>
amulet.<br/>
