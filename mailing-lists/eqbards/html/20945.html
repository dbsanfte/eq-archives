<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-602873212">I am now 15.5 and living in Unrest. You heard me, living, I died a fair<br/>
amount at 13, not much at 14, and haven&#39;t died in 15 so far. Love Selo&#39;s,<br/>
love the drum, love knowing when to bail. Having said this publicly I fully<br/>
expect to die many times tonight, it&#39;s a physics thing, Unrest is one big<br/>
Schrodinger&#39;s Cat Box.<br/>
<br/>
So, here are some things about my experience:<br/>
<br/>
Selos appears to be giving a chance to break Ghoul Root, I swear I am<br/>
breaking it on the pulse. Now, I also have a base 40+ magic resist, which<br/>
might help. I *think* this may only be for the bard and not for the party<br/>
members, then again it very well may be an illusion. the sum total is when I<br/>
have pulled I never have gotten rooted for more than a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
The following is a desperate public service announcement, I may freakin<br/>
macro it and repeat it every five minutes in Unrest: <br/>
When pulling from the porch, if you jump the rail the mob will go through<br/>
the house, probably building MegaTrain(tm). Tag, run to the back door,<br/>
pause, open the door, step outside, pause, run down the stairs, pause, run<br/>
for your group when you see it outside. This assumes Selos or SoW, you can<br/>
subtract the pauses without it I think.  Let me just say this again, if you<br/>
jump the rail the mob will go through the house, probably building<br/>
MegaTrain(tm). *loses composure* ARGGGHHHHHH! <br/>
<br/>
If you are pulling from the back porch there is a &quot;safe spot&#39; in the alcove<br/>
just inside the back door to your left. Enter the house, go to the safe<br/>
spot, listen for other pullers. If you hear another pull when you are<br/>
looking go there immediately and wait.<br/>
<br/>
If you hunt the side room (or whatever the marble, non-entrance, entry is<br/>
called) realize that, no one who is pulling the porch knows or will listen<br/>
to the following public service message:  if you jump the rail the mob will<br/>
go through the house, probably building MegaTrain(tm). MegaTrain(tm) exits<br/>
through this door, so you will get a face full of Ugly Pull and die, getting<br/>
your party killed when you tell them you are rooted and they valiantly try<br/>
to help. Except the bard, he will try to help too but then he will bail when<br/>
he sees your health bar empty, zip damage free to zone, and look for a new<br/>
group that will listen to him about pulling from the house. Or so I&#39;ve<br/>
heard.<br/>
<br/>
When soloing I have been singing Chant of battle, Whistling Warsong and<br/>
Hymn. The added AC of Chant seems to be more effective than the added damage<br/>
of Bellow.  Like a twink I totally forgot about Kelins Lullaby until after I<br/>
went to sell last night. So I will probably swap Chant out for Lullaby when<br/>
I get multi-bugs.<br/>
In a group, Anthem Hymn, Bellow. Making sure to NOT be singing anything when<br/>
the puller comes back has kept me from being a mana sink for the healers, it<br/>
is oh so hard (due to feeling like a slacker) but it makes all the<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All for now,<br/>
