It&#39;s a PITA to get bound in the Arena if you&#39;re going to be in<br/>
a pickup group.  The Arena is usually empty, so you have to go<br/>
out to Rathe Lake and ask there for someone to bind you.  <br/>
People at Rathe Lake are usually busy fighting or camping and<br/>
don&#39;t want to take the time to run over to the Arena, zone in,<br/>
bind you, zone out, and run back (as opposed to towns where<br/>
they are banking or buying supplies or waiting for the boat<br/>
and won&#39;t &quot;miss out&quot; if they take 20 seconds to bind someone).<br/>
