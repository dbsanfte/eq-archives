&gt; &gt;That&#39;s possible.  I didn&#39;t check the lag meter, but I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; &gt;coping with 10%-30% PL most of the time for the last three<br/>
&gt; &gt;weeks.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s been BAD! Wave after wave of linkdeads, and it is happening to friends<br/>
&gt; with cable modems as well as with my dial up connection. I have been<br/>
&gt; wondering if it was regional (Austin) or further upstream. Sounds like trhe<br/>

Early yesterday afternoon after slogging through more of the<br/>
same PL for an hour, something hiccupped dumping about a third<br/>
of the players off the servers.  When I got back on there was<br/>
a message saying they were looking into the PL problem.  For<br/>
the next half hour, I had 0%-3% PL.  Then they took the<br/>
servers down (presumably to fix the PL), and when I got back<br/>
on it was at 10%-30% again.  I fired off a feedback<br/>
complaining about it.  My friends in Toronto, Minnesota, and<br/>
California are reporting the same thing so I think the problem<br/>
is at or near Verant.<br/>
