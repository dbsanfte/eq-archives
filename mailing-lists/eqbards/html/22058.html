<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364493111">true enough, he may be a half breed, but he might actually not give &quot;working<br/>
as intended&quot; as lame excuses to issues that he himself will probably have<br/>
witnessed to not be working as they should. who knows, only time will tell<br/>

&gt; Weee i hope this helps us out, Absor (gordo&#39;s replacement) <br/>
&gt; seems to be a<br/>
&gt; bard. Could it be we might have someone represent us that has <br/>
&gt; a clue now?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Many of my people brag that they have been granted the best <br/>
&gt; traits of their<br/>
&gt; parents. Perhaps. But we also bear the burden of that <br/>
&gt; heritage. Neither<br/>
&gt; Humans nor Elves love us, yet we must find our way in their <br/>
&gt; society. Often<br/>
&gt; enough this isolation breaks our spirit. We have never found our own<br/>
&gt; society, and therefore can find no place to call home. But <br/>
&gt; for some, myself<br/>
&gt; included, this has been a blessing. We are not restricted by racial<br/>
&gt; boundaries, and have the pleasure to claim all of Norrath as home.&quot; <br/>

&gt; Forgive my happiness, i know bards aren&#39;t suppose to be all cheery and<br/>
&gt; affect their entourage in a positive way.<br/>
