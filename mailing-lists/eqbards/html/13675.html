&quot;NEVER&quot; expect more than 2.  (Normally charm is good enough to<br/>
control a 3-mob pull.  The problem with the DW gobs is that<br/>
they&#39;re all named &quot;deepwater goblin&quot; but some of them are<br/>
casters.  If your group is fighting one gob and the two you&#39;re<br/>
charming turn out to be casters, you&#39;re going to be eating a<br/>
lot of nukes in between charms.)<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, *ideally* you want an enchanter, healer, and<br/>
someone who can cast harmony.  You can do it without the<br/>
enchanter, but I found the fights to be much much easier (like<br/>
zoning two times vs. only losing 0-2 bubbles) with an<br/>
enchanter.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pull from Oasis, you need only to run to the inn.   The caster will come up<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; far enough so that it can see you to nuke.  When it does, have a tank engage<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is by far the easiest way to do it (assuming you don&#39;t<br/>
pull an extra caster).  Another benefit of using fear is that<br/>
it&#39;ll disperse those annoying green undead who seem to like to<br/>
crash the fights.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, the inn is a GREAT area for fear and snare since the MOBS will tend to<br/>
&gt; walk back and forth rather then run across the zone when feared here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, the area we found they do this in was also<br/>
close enough to the water for the casters to nuke us while out<br/>
of sight.  :(  We had enough tankage that I let them beat on<br/>
us until they were at half health, then I chain-feared them<br/>
while they stood in place.<br/>
<br/>
The loot on the goblins is not that great - bronze and rusty<br/>
weapons.  So keep an eye out for sand giants to fill out the<br/>
purse.  Also be aware that people running from the spectres<br/>
tend to run straight through the area near the inn on their<br/>
way to the S Ro zone.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are biggest problem was the newbies fighting DW Gob pets got pissed at us<br/>
&gt; for stealing their bread and butter.  We just made sure that when we left,<br/>
&gt; all 6 were spawning pets.  Man there were a lot of newbies crowding the lake<br/>
&gt; for them!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dunno if it was due to their buggy behavior, but the pets<br/>
wouldn&#39;t suicide after I charmed them.  I suspect charm/invis<br/>
would&#39;ve worked, but that&#39;s a waste of a song slot.  Find a<br/>
group hunting the pets and take any pets over to them.  :)<br/>
