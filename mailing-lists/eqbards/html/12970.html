<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946291638">My ranger friend needed to buy some rubies for his ivy<br/>
armor.  I have a cha of 124 so I told him I would buy<br/>
them for him.  With 124 cha with an apprehensive<br/>
clocwork jeweler the ruby would&#39;ve costed 135.  He<br/>
then gave me some more cha gear that bumped my cha to<br/>
143 i believe.  The ruby then costed 131.  So, yeah, I<br/>
don&#39;t know if there are any hard level limits in<br/>
charisma to achieve certain costs.  Probably not.  It<br/>
is probably just the case that most people buy low<br/>
costing things--water, rations, etc. from merchants<br/>
that have such a &quot;small&quot; price that what they pay for<br/>
with 120 cha may still be the same with 140 cha.  It<br/>
may only make a difference on the high priced items. <br/>
Not sure though. I haven&#39;t tried to buy water with 143<br/>
charisma.<br/>

&gt; As near as I can tell, the prices you get are based<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; charisma, faction, and possibly race and diety. <br/>
&gt; With a 110<br/>
&gt; charisma, I was able to get the best possible prices<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; indifferent merchants, but only some apprehensive<br/>
&gt; merchants.  <br/>
&gt; With my current 154 charisma, I&#39;m able to get the<br/>
&gt; best prices<br/>
&gt; from most apprehensive merchants.  I suppose it<br/>
&gt; could be<br/>
&gt; capped at 120 cha (which is between 110 and 154),<br/>
&gt; but based on<br/>
&gt; the extreme nonlinearity I saw when I tested prices<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; different charisma from 75 to 110, I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; Verant<br/>
&gt; would&#39;ve made it quite so simple.  Items do have a<br/>
&gt; maximum<br/>
&gt; buy/minimum sell price though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Btw, anyone notice they finally fixed the wood elf<br/>
&gt; merchant<br/>
&gt; faction?  For the longest time, WE merchants viewed<br/>
&gt; wood elves<br/>
&gt; apprehensively.  They&#39;re amiable now.<br/>
