&gt; Congrats on the EBW, I&#39;ve been wanting one for some time.  My guild leader<br/>
&gt; (50 druid) has one of the teeth, and said if I could get the other he&#39;d<br/>
&gt; let me have it, but finding a group that&#39;s willing to go with me in is<br/>
&gt; rather difficult.  Of course the druid also knows how to solo both maid<br/>
&gt; and butler rooms, but he&#39;s not up for spending the time it takes to get<br/>
&gt; another fang (i.e. luck was vastly on your side with the drops).<br/>

you, they won&#39;t attack you on sight (unlike the familiars who<br/>
will forever attack you - guess they&#39;re ambitious about<br/>
getting promoted :).  So it&#39;s pretty trivial for a level 50 to<br/>
break up the room - just kill one, invis to rest/med up, kill<br/>
the next, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not in the mob&#39;s aggro radius and it&#39;s triggered by<br/>
a runner, the only check seems to be a /con check - if it&#39;s<br/>
green, it won&#39;t come after you regardless of whether or not<br/>
it&#39;d normally aggro on you.<br/>
