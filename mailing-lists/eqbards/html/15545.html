&gt; What you are seeing is definitely texture loading delays.  <br/>
&gt; EQ really likes to have at least 128MB to run with no<br/>
&gt; swapping.  When you&#39;re running with only (God, when did it<br/>
&gt; become ONLY?) 64MB, as I do on my home system, it goes to<br/>

got the delay once *without* hitting the hard drive, so<br/>
something else is going on.  Maybe it&#39;s just psychology and me<br/>
not being used to any frame rate lower than 20 fps.  :)<br/>

rate.)<br/>

As for why I don&#39;t turn mouse acceleration off, I tried that.  <br/>
EQ&#39;s mouse settings seem to override your Windows destop<br/>
settings.<br/>
