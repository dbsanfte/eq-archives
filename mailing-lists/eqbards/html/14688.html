<div id="ygrps-yiv-890562859">yes that&#39;s correct, our enchanters do drain now on dragon raids, but our<br/>
song is nothing in comparison.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Word I&#39;m getting (indirectly) is that the latest enchanter<br/>
&gt; strategy on Vox runs is to stamina drain her so she can&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; as many complete heals off.  Vox (and probably Naggy) were<br/>
&gt; changed so that they can&#39;t be stunned/bashed/mesmerized to<br/>
&gt; interrupt their casting anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dunno how our song compares to their spell, or even if it<br/>
&gt; stacks. </span></blockquote></div>
