<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079111717">Yesterday I filled out a feedback form asking for some kind of hot-key<br/>
for us bards to switch from our equipped weapon(s)/shield to an<br/>
instrument. Kinda like how you can switch from your melee weapon to your<br/>
range weapon. I dunno about anyone else, but its a real pain when you<br/>
want to sit down and rest after a battle to open up your persona, click<br/>
on the Inv button above your player image, then click on your weapon,<br/>
drop it in your inv, click on your shield (or secondary weapon), drop it<br/>
in your inv, and then get your lute (or other instrument) which may be<br/>
in a backpack or something, and put it in your secondary hand. And then<br/>
by the time you&#39;ve done that, you&#39;re fully healed, so you have to do the<br/>
exact reverse.<br/>
This may sound like a tedious task, but when you&#39;re in danger or trying<br/>
to equip your drum while running for your life, it really makes a<br/>
difference. Or when you have to tell your party members to hold on while<br/>
your equip or unequip your instrument before they take off on you.<br/>
I have my mouse sensitivity all the way up, and I keep all my<br/>
instruments and weapons in my inv slots (not in backpacks) so I can do<br/>
this as quickly as possible, but its still not a very quick operation,<br/>
even if it is done smoothly.<br/>
The other alternative is to never, or hardly ever use a weapon/shield<br/>
and just use hand to hand. But thats not always wise, especially when<br/>
soloing, or with a small group who depend on your 16 or 17 dam from your<br/>
minotaur axe to keep the situation from getting ugly.<br/>
If anyone else has feels the same way about this, PLEASE fill out a<br/>
feedback form in-game by typing /feedback and requesting such an option.<br/>
<br/>
Good day to you all, and may your songs of battle bring pride upon us.<br/>
