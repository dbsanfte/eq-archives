<b>Subject:</b> RE: Question about the teleport song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533685499">I tested it from the top floor.  You appear on the ground some distance<br/>
away. The song takes 5 seconds to &quot;re-act&quot; so if you plan to use it &quot;plan<br/>
ahead&quot; Ie: don&#39;t wait until someone is at a sliver of hp - it takes 5<br/>
seconds (2 good rounds of Avo attacks) for the song to stick.  The down side<br/>
is the party members will be spread out and somewhat disoriented - so brief<br/>
them ahead of time and even test it for fun.<br/>
<br/>
But having been camping KFC (so delete me) for more levels than I care to<br/>
admit, I can now run to the top floor - with Selo&#39;s and the drum and pull<br/>
birds without a problem.  The first time I went up there - I fell to my<br/>
death just being disoriented and missing the small ramp.  Practice,<br/>
practice, practice!  Now (or even 2 levels ago - prolly around 25) I can<br/>
jump off the top floor and live (I lose 3 bubbles of health though so its<br/>
not a viable option for pulling.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you move somewhere that causes the mob that is attacking you<br/>
&quot;pathing problems&quot; (ie it for some reason cannot find a good way to run<br/>
after you - like some people who try to &quot;safe zone&quot; or trap mobs against<br/>
terrain features) the mobs will now &quot;teleport&quot; to your immediate vicinity<br/>
and continue their attack.  So, if you Melfious Motion and evacuate - the<br/>
mobs will be along shortly - so you better immediately make tracks for the<br/>
zone!<br/>

p.s. aviaks are sometimes called &quot;chickens&quot; - you can guess why we call it<br/>
KFC<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. memorize this: /ooc Paw neg 3200 pos 800 <br/>
(you will be typing that a lot if you hunt at Aviaks)<br/>

		I was fighting last night at the top of the aviak village in<br/>
South Karana.<br/>
		Fortunately everything went well and I never had to flee for<br/>
the zone border<br/>
		to escape death.  Had I been forced to do so I probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
		survived because of the numerous ramps you have to use to<br/>
get to the bottom<br/>
		of the village.  Since I won&#39;t get levitate for a long time,<br/>
was wondering<br/>
		if the teleport song would work in this situation.  If I<br/>
sing that song<br/>
		while at the top of the village (or any high altitude<br/>
location), will I<br/>
		appear at the same altitude over the ground, and as a result<br/>
take lots of<br/>
		damage due to falling?  Or will I end up on the ground<br/>
wherever the song<br/>
		sends me to? <br/>
<br/>
		Thanks<br/>
