<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287189001">I agree with Rokenn, while it is true that you can be a better member of the<br/>
group by behaving like an air traffic controller, I think that unless you<br/>
are a type A personality you will tire of this sort of mayhem very<br/>
quickly...the point is to have fun.  Will all that extra clicking really<br/>
make that much difference in the end?<br/>

<br/>
Constant swapping for instruments and weapons is only for the truely insane.<br/>
I may switch back and forth during a battle as is called for, but not<br/>
constantly.  You might want to remind your groupmate that EQ is after all a<br/>
social game and it is impossible to be social while twisting constantly.  If<br/>
I am in a group and all is well, I have no problem only leaving one song<br/>
playing so I can chat with my friends, in group, tells, or guildsay.  So<br/>
tell that monk to relax =)<br/>
