<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110511799">I sent these to Tork, thought I would send them to the list for comment as<br/>
well.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sub 50 ideas:<br/>
Selo&#39;s Shooting Star (39th?)<br/>
Percussion - outdoor only<br/>
Combination of Selo&#39;s Accelerando, Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding, and<br/>
Agilmente&#39;s Aria of Eagles + Ultravision.  Party effect, Range: Zone wide.  <br/>
<br/>
A new charm song, if not full charm then atleast a charm animal song (make<br/>
this one 44th or 49th)<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Sonic Disruption<br/>
Target: Single<br/>
Brass (required)<br/>
Disrupts all spell casting from target.<br/>
This could also be interesting as an AE song as well.  If AE having it stop<br/>
all say/shout traffic into/out of AE (this would be interesting on the PvP<br/>
servers).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
50 plus songs:<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Dance of Death<br/>
AE or Single<br/>
Brass<br/>
DoT + drain severe stamina drain(at least the equiv of a full bubble) +<br/>
chance to interrupt any spell casting<br/>
Dot should be twice as strong as Selo&#39;s Chords of Cessation at the same<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Niv&#39;s Chrorus of Restoration<br/>
String Required<br/>
2xHymn of Restoration + Fatigue restoral + 1.5xCassindra&#39;s Chorus of<br/>
Clarity.<br/>
Fully stacks with Hymn of Restoration, Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity, Niv&#39;s<br/>
Melody of Preservation.<br/>
<br/>
No name idea<br/>
Voice<br/>
Converts entire mana bar to HP healing the party.  Not sure what a balanced<br/>
spread would be, maybe a mana to HP conversion of 1.5 to 2 HPs for each<br/>
point of bard mana.  The bard singing the song would NOT be healed by the<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
Denon&#39;s Sonic Reflection<br/>
Brass<br/>
Gives all party members a damage reflection shield. Causing a portion of the<br/>
damage done to them in combat (melee & non-melee) to be reflected back at<br/>
the attacker).<br/>
<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s Solidarity of Form<br/>
Wind (required)<br/>
Bard assumes the form of the target creature, with associated faction<br/>
adjustment.<br/>
Duration either 60 secs or continuous, ie as long as song is being played.<br/>
If continues the effect ends as soon as the song does (no residual effect).<br/>
Targeting a new creature changes form again.<br/>
