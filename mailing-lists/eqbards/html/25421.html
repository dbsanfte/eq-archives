<div id="ygrps-yiv-222175393">Not sure if they could do the stackable haste spells the way they currently<br/>
work.  They might be working on it dont know.  But currently 1 haste<br/>
spell/icon and one item is all that will stack (sure you knew that, just<br/>
rambling).<br/>

We used to have targetted rune songs, they removed the rune from them<br/>
and made them self-only haste songs, not because they were powerful but<br/>
because no one used them except for twinking.  OoS does debuff CR and<br/>
FR, but I know some bards want chants that are for DR and PR which we<br/>
don&#39;t have.  I think better slows and haste would be nice, stackable is<br/>
always nice since that is the essence of bard songs.<br/>

Stacking OOS might be a little extreme :), but there&#39;s got to be some<br/>
good<br/>
ideas we can come up with.<br/>
<br/>
* A stackable slow song like Erjav?<br/>
* A targeted, stackable Rune song ala SOS?<br/>
* More debuff songs ala OOS but for CR, FR, etc.<br/>
* A song that refreshes your groups disciplines faster<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it off the top of my head,<br/>
