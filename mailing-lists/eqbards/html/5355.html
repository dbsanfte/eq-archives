<div id="ygrps-yiv-483650676">I think mine had stopped somewhere around there as well. I know I haven&#39;t<br/>
seen an increase for a while. One thing I have noticed however is that you<br/>
don&#39;t need to take damage from a fall for it to go up. I went up 5 skill<br/>
levels scooting around Everfrost off the riverbanks and taking no damage but<br/>
I&#39;d increase my skill level in it. Now, it could very well be that you have<br/>
to take damage to increase it but I was taking so little damage that the<br/>
extra skill point was compensating for it. Another good place to practice<br/>
Safe Fall up to about 30ish is to go up a ladder and walk back off it. Can<br/>
get the skill up rather quickly there. (Just be sure to keep Hymn playing<br/>
cause you will go though health just as quick. =)<br/>

	Good Journey,<br/>

8)I hate to ask this question again because I know we have gone<br/>
8)over this<br/>
8)topic before on the list, but we have not discussed it for a while and<br/>
8)people might have some new data on it.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)I just made 24th a few days ago and got the &quot;Safe Fall&quot;<br/>
8)skill...I trained it<br/>
8)up to 40 and I don&#39;t seem to be able to take it any higher,<br/>
8)at least during<br/>
8)my initial trials - I fell from a high enough height to do<br/>
8)damage to myself<br/>
8)over and over (about 20 times or so) until I was down to 1<br/>
8)bubble of XP and<br/>
8)it would not raise above 40.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Are we capped at 40 for Safe Fall?  If so what a<br/>
8)let-down...not much real<br/>
8)improvement over not having it all from what I have observed.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Does anyone on the list have any new or revised data on our<br/>
8)Bard Skill Caps<br/>
8)they could share with us?<br/>
