<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049045384">At 30, my songlist in dalnirs is:<br/>
<br/>
COB (I group with an enchanter)<br/>
Largos<br/>
Hymm<br/>
Selos outside/Shaurys inside<br/>
FCC<br/>
Pixie Strike<br/>
Charm<br/>
Fear<br/>
<br/>
I am using a lamatation blade and silvery axe.<br/>
FCC has a better range than bellow and is great for<br/>
pulling altho I don&#39;t notice much damage even with<br/>
drum.<br/>
<br/>
I like chains, but when you&#39;re hit my muliples, Largos<br/>
is nice to have.  I also group with a druid so snaring<br/>
isn&#39;t an issue for me.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I just made 30th level, Up to now I&#39;ve been singing<br/>
&gt; Anthem & Psalm of Warmth, with Pixie, Charm and<br/>
&gt; Chains thrown in when needed. For down time I play(<br/>
&gt; with lute) Hymn.  I always keep Selos mem&#39;d with<br/>
&gt; Screech for a fast getaway. so there are my 8 song<br/>
&gt; slots. I weild weapons most of the time Kirsh & Obs.<br/>
&gt; Shard in off hand.<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;m 30 I got my first Chant...but last nite I<br/>
&gt; was at a loss as how to weave it into my mix, do I<br/>
&gt; do all instruments? do i sing it as a 3rd or 4th<br/>
&gt; song what song do I drop?  Most of the time I fight<br/>
&gt; in High Keep or Karnuk so AoE aggro is not a<br/>
&gt; problem.<br/>
&gt; Please help me :-)<br/>
