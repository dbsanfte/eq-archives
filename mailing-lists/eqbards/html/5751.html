<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301556247">JM Cappozi (sp?) is/was a beta tester who got to be close friends with the<br/>
dev team.  Go back and re-read his posts - NEVER does he claim to be a<br/>
programmer (that I saw) but the detail and quality of his information made<br/>
it sure seem like he - himself had to be a Verant employee.  But really --<br/>
that&#39;s something that _we_ super-imposed on him.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t start calling him an imposter or a fake or a fraud.  I re-read<br/>
all his posts (that I saved and I think it was all the good ones) and while<br/>
he drops names and hints about insider stuff all the time - I never found<br/>
any place we he made any claims  about being on the dev team.<br/>
<br/>
How could I possibly know all this???  Well, you yourself can ask Brad<br/>
McQuaid next time you meet him at Gencon or somewhere.  I asked if JM was at<br/>
the con and Brad certainly knew his name and told me he was a beta tester<br/>
they got to know very well.<br/>
<br/>
So there - how&#39;s that for some EQ Bard Lore on an other wise boring Friday<br/>
afternoon?<br/>
