Think of this:  given how buggy EQ was/is after a *year* of beta testing<br/>
with a large group, just imagine how wondeful the expansion will be with<br/>
only whatever *closed* beta testing they are doing.  And if they have not<br/>
decided on what/where/how spells are going to be and there&#39;s only 6 weeks to<br/>
go... I think it&#39;s going to be rather messy.<br/>

Besides.  I hate that people are even trying to figure this out already.<br/>
All you guys are doing is getting really worked up over something that may<br/>
or may not happen.</div>
