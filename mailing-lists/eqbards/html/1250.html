&gt;Druids have some nifty damage shield spells.  These are the<br/>
&gt;kind that do damage to the attacker every time you&#39;re hit.<br/>
&gt;Since bards often end up being the mob magnet, I was wondering<br/>
&gt;if anyone had tried getting a druid to cast a couple of these<br/>
&gt;on you (there are two types - one low damage/long duration,<br/>
&gt;one high damage/short duration, both stack - cast the latter<br/>
&gt;just as a fight starts).<br/>

Maze, tanking with another bard, a druid, a cleric, a wizard, and a rogue.<br/>
The Druid cast Brambles on me right as a gorge mino, muddite minor and<br/>
muddite elder all decided I was cannon fodder.  I was very fortunate to<br/>
have quick-response medical help, as well as some really buff magic.  WE<br/>
killed them all - but sadly, I was the only one who had taken any damage.<br/>
