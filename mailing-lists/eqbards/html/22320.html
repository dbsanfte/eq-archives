<div id="ygrps-yiv-95435778">I&#39;m not certain if the distance between me and the charmed pet was a factor.<br/>
I usually do not move after I charm them.  I just turn around and target<br/>
another mob.  Guess I need to play around with it some more to see if my<br/>
problem is distance related or if I&#39;m hitting the attack hotkey to soon<br/>
after hitting the back off hotkey.<br/>

I&#39;ve never had much trouble with the drovlorgs and chickens, you just have<br/>
to make sure you are close enough to them and sometimes you need to tell<br/>
them twice to do what you want em to do...not sure why.  Giants on the other<br/>
hand are a royal pain to control while charmed because it seems like you<br/>
almost have to be standing right under them to get them to do anything, and<br/>
if you are too far away (i.e. out of melee range) you often do not get any<br/>
kind of intelligent messages back regarding the effectiveness of your charm.<br/>

Various drolvargs, giants, spiders and chickens in Dreadlands.  I know for<br/>
intelligent mobs you have to tell them to attack every time you charm them.<br/>
In my case they never even attacked the first time I charmed them.<br/>
