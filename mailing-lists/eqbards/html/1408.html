<b>Subject:</b> Re: Macro setup for bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489404259">Though is has nothing to do with the macro setup, I&#39;ll discuss the<br/>
friendly gnoll Grenix. He does anything but spawn regularly. He know<br/>
longer follows the 6 hour schedule, and at times he won&#39;t spawn for 12<br/>
or so hours, and then 3 times the next hour. I&#39;ve sat around, watch many<br/>
fights(lost too many of them to nukers and high level people), and I can<br/>
safely say there is no pattern. Even the captain formula(don&#39;t ask)<br/>
doesn&#39;t work anymore. Getting one of these is pure luck. And yes, it is<br/>
strange they spawn there. Too bad the captain is blind heh...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Quick question: Someone mentioned the named fellow in highpass spawns<br/>
&gt; regularly... what times may this be, if you please? I really want me one of<br/>
&gt; those Tomahwaks but I&#39;ve spent so much time just sitting around watching<br/>
&gt; tons of very organized people take care of that chunk of the zone that I<br/>
&gt; feel I need to resort to more inquisitive methods. Nobody there&#39;s willing<br/>
&gt; to join me in conversation.<br/>
&gt; As an aside: Don&#39;t you think it odd that so many gnolls spawn right near<br/>
&gt; where a captain hangs out and around the corner from a bustling city? Sort<br/>
&gt; of like coyotes in NYC.<br/>
