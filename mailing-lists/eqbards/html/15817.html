&gt; I am not certain that four song weaving is beneficial over three.  I tried<br/>
&gt; throwing in either bellow and/or chains with some twists.  Unless you can<br/>
&gt; minimize the time with just 3 song coverage (to one second or less), you<br/>
&gt; are probably losing more in terms of efficiency than you are gaining with<br/>

turn it off, and your hp will increment only twice.  The 3<br/>
pulse notion came about because  depending on when your song<br/>
hits the server in its heartbeat cycle, it can &quot;last&quot; anywhere<br/>
from 2.00 to 2.99 pulses (and the time to start up the song<br/>
&quot;adds&quot; a half pulse subjectively).<br/>
<br/>
DoTs seem to be 3 pulses.  I&#39;ve been meaning to test them with<br/>
Rokenn in the arena.  If they are indeed 3 pulse songs, then<br/>
you have a bit more flexibility when weaving them.<br/>
