<b>Subject:</b> Bards base stats <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-33902572">A few weeks back I sent out a request for everyone to send me their<br/>
bards base statistics so we could figure out what the the &quot;average&quot; bard<br/>
looked like.  I got a few responses but not enough for a valid sample.<br/>
Would like to ask one more time for this info.  Just tell me your base<br/>
primary stats (without magic item increases) plus what race your bard<br/>
is.  Once I get enough respondents I&#39;ll post the results.<br/>
