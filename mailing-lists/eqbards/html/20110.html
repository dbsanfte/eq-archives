the first island of Sky and got almost every quest mob from the inside<br/>
of the island on his butt instantly. I think the only factor that has<br/>
any effect is if mobs are below you in the dungeon or not. Some places<br/>
that seem ok may just not intersect with other mob holding areas.<br/>
<br/>
Verant (Brad) has said at least one place that I&#39;ve seen that checking<br/>
the z-axis is just something they can&#39;t do in the current server engine.<br/>
Too much cpu. Given that I&#39;m 99% certain the game runs on Sun servers<br/>
and if it was spec&#39;d when they started developing, the servers it was<br/>
spec&#39;d for aren&#39;t even sold anymore, I really think they probably could<br/>
have the cpu for it now if they really wanted to do it but that&#39;s what<br/>
he has said.<br/>
<br/>
Why am I 99% certain it&#39;s running on Sun? Look at Verant&#39;s current job<br/>
offerings. The Sr. Sysadmin position says your duties involve <br/>
&quot;Configure, deploy and maintain game server hardware to power our<br/>
Massively Multiplayer games&quot; While Unix experience is required, NT<br/>
experience is only prefered. As a side note, from what I&#39;ve heard they<br/>
pay, getting a sysadmin with a Cisco ticket is a total fantasy. <br/>
