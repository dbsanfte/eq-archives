<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428498941">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m planning to create a bard either on Rallos Zek or preferrably the<br/>
racewar server (if I can hold out). I&#39;ve already chosen half elf as my<br/>
race and I intend to put most of my points into strength so that I can<br/>
easily carry steel plate, weapons and instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, with the few remaining points I have, where do you guys and gals<br/>
suggest I put them? Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity is important<br/>
for playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does it actually<br/>
increase the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>
frequently you miss a note?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps agility would be better, as if I don&#39;t get hit, I don&#39;t get<br/>
interrupted. Plus plate + agility is a nice combination.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>
steelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t want to be in a<br/>
constant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to be safe, but I<br/>
was thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into dexterity and<br/>
agility).<br/>
<br/>
If less strength is okay, then I might consider just doing a wood elf, as<br/>
they tend to have higher natural agility and dexterity. Either elf fits<br/>
well in my IC perception of my character.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
<br/>
