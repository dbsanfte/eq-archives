<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134886390">Before I rant, I&#39;d like to clearly point out that neither Slyde or myself<br/>
ever said anything derrogatory about the GM&#39;s.  Also, both of us DID take<br/>
responsibility for our own situations.  Perhaps if I quote my post:<br/>
<br/>
Jeez that sounds familiar.  Same thing happened to a ranger and a warrior<br/>
from my guild.  Same spot and all.  And in our situation, the GM&#39;s still<br/>
said tough sh*t.  We finally managed to do the CR after a 6 hour stint with<br/>
the help of a level 30 something Shaman and Druid.  It was a nightmare.<br/>
Glad it worked out for you.<br/>
<br/>
When I said that the GM said tough sh*t, I was paraphrasing.  The GM said<br/>
that we needed to find a way to get the corpses ourselves.  That we did.<br/>
And no one went crying as you so eloquently put it.  Nowhere in either<br/>
Slyde&#39;s or my posts did it say that we expected the GM to do a damn thing.<br/>
I was simply stating that I have seen that same point at which he died and I<br/>
knowits a tough spot, but I am glad it all worked out for him.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I have never bugged anything.  I have never petitioned for<br/>
anything.  I thoroughly enjoy my character and the way he plays, despite the<br/>
flaws.  What I have grown incredibly tired of however is the recurring<br/>
flames on this list.  Perhaps before you post your retort, you should<br/>
attempt to read between the lines on a post.  Instead of downing every post<br/>
that you disagree with, take a position, state it and move on.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all glad to have the info that comes through this list from the likes<br/>
of John, Shada, Harmonic and many others.  I look forward to reading this<br/>
list.  If people who don&#39;t have the experience that you do post something<br/>
that is inaccurate, correct it, don&#39;t laugh at it in public.<br/>
