<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-77170335">When I do a /who all bard on my server (Innorruuk) there are always fewer Bards visible than any other<br/>
class (with the occasional exception of Rogues) at all levels.  Usually in the 8-15 range with 2k people<br/>
on.  My own guild has three Bards above 30:  levels 58, 57 and me (53), plus one level 50 that&#39;s never<br/>
played.  I believe we have the most post-50s of any guild.<br/>
