&gt; Yes we can :)  One of the female wood elf bards in my guild has a druid<br/>
&gt; outfit she likes to goof-off in to confuse newbies.  She has a GWC, leather<br/>
&gt; armor, and wears her Imbrued boots (look just like Efreeti booties).  It is<br/>
&gt; pretty funny.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m almost finished with the druid look.  When I get some<br/>
cash, I&#39;m going to make a cleric look (full plate, blunt<br/>
weapon, shield).  Maybe also a warrior look (full mithril-blue<br/>
plate, something else for the gloves and boots, 2 weapons).<br/>
<br/>
But what I really want to find is some sort of robe that we<br/>
can wear.  The wood elf avatar doesn&#39;t have graphics for<br/>
wearing a robe, but the dark elf does.  Just use my mask of<br/>
deception and presto - a dark elf bard wearing a robe.<br/>
