<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047404367">I certainly hope everyone is reporting this as a bug.  It&#39;s never happened<br/>
to me, but<br/>
this sounds like it could have very serious implications.  You faction could<br/>
really be<br/>
screwed if a named NPC gets killed near you.  I urge everyone experiencing<br/>
this to<br/>
file an in-game bug report.<br/>

&gt; &gt;BTW has anyone noticed a faction hit message whenever something dies<br/>
&gt; &gt;around you??  I was hunting Gnolls in Highhold pass and was constantly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have noticed this as well!  I was not in a group, and was in fact<br/>
brewing<br/>
&gt; for about an hour and a half in Freeport.  I had not been playing any<br/>
songs,<br/>
&gt; only leaning over the barrell crafting Fierce Brew, hadn&#39;t attacked<br/>
anything<br/>
&gt; all night, and received the faction change notice several times.  People<br/>
&gt; tend to attack certain guards and even a spawning tavern NPC, but I took<br/>
&gt; absolutely no part in these nearby battles, just making brew and chatting<br/>
&gt; with drunks (I offered free beer in an auction, heheh).<br/>
