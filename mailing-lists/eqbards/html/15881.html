<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545562441">Just had to mension, when you get charmed, it seem the computer will try to cast the spells memorized in<br/>
the last bottom spell slot.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your druid friend if Starfire was there, and if so to put gate or a heal spell there, so he won&#39;t cast<br/>
on you next time.<br/>
<br/>
This is from my experience... and from my charmed necro friend that was life sucking me in Solusek B.<br/>

&gt; Ok, sorry it took me a bit longer than I thought to write up my Mistmoore<br/>
&gt; Castle comments.  Been busy getting things done in my current zone.<br/>

&gt; Mynthi Davissi is an enchanter.  If it&#39;s a two man operation like I had and<br/>
&gt; your Druid gets charmed, expect a couple of Starfires to hit you.  As a bard<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s your job to make sure that your Magic Resist is as high as you can get<br/>
&gt; it when fighting her.  Even so, as John Kim noted some months ago he got<br/>
&gt; charmed with his MR over 200.  Expect a charm or two to happen and be<br/>
&gt; prepared to run for the zone creating one of those epic MM trains or die.<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re in a larger group you can probably deal with a charm better than<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re in a smaller group.  My 50 Druid was charmed more than once.  Load<br/>
&gt; Pixie Strike and be prepared to use it to interrupt Mynthi and other party<br/>
&gt; members should they get charmed.<br/>
