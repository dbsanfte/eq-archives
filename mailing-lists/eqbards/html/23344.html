<div id="ygrps-yiv-215261401">Well, in order of easiest to hardest, I&#39;d say:<br/>
Karnors, Sebilis/Chardok, Howling Stones<br/>
<br/>
Best bet is to spend a boring evening in one of the moat corners in Karnors, tell the group you want to<br/>
practice mezzing on two-pulls, then move up to three-pulls (and more) when you feel comfortable.  (Charm<br/>
is actually better on two-pulls, since the MOB is helping you out - unless it&#39;s a caster - but the<br/>
practice is worth it.)<br/>
<br/>
Mez something, then just sing your normal song cycle until it breaks.  That gives you a feel for how long<br/>
the thing lasts in relation to your normal twist.  Mez never drops early unless the MOB is DOTted or hit,<br/>
and it lasts a long time.  When mezzing a lot of stuff, I usually don&#39;t bother to fight; if I&#39;m down to<br/>
one (sometimes two if I&#39;m feeling ambitious), I may try switching targets to the MOB that everyone&#39;s<br/>
attacking in between mezzes.  Try not to face the MOBs you mezzed, you&#39;ll hit them!  Three or more extra<br/>
MOBs, I just mez, one or two, I usually mez and twist in a few songs.  The top-down view I find is by far<br/>
the best way to handle mez.<br/>
<br/>
Song of Twilight has an interesting feature that&#39;s sometimes useful and sometimes a big pain in the<br/>
patootie:  it moves the MOBs.  What&#39;s annoying is that, while it SAYS the MOB stumbles towards you, what<br/>
it actually does is move the MOB on a line from where you&#39;re facing to further behind you.  So if you&#39;ve<br/>
turned around, you&#39;re actually pushing them away.  Very useful for keeping MOBs from falling off of<br/>
battlements or yanking them out of rocks, but be careful when turning around that you don&#39;t push them into<br/>
aggroing other MOBs.<br/>
<br/>
I think a druid and a paladin are fine, although I assume you meant that as the core and not as the whole<br/>
group.  I wouldn&#39;t try just three people in any of those places (except maybe Sebilis zone-in or Karnor&#39;s<br/>
front).<br/>
<br/>
Best places to practice are the zone-outs.  So moat or front of Karnor&#39;s, zone-out in Sebilis or Chardok.<br/>
If you mess up, it&#39;s a quick jump out.  (Keep fear memmed just in case, heh.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say you can handle close-to-zone with average 51 in Karnor&#39;s, 53 in Seb or Chardok.  55 in HS, I have<br/>
no idea where the zone-out is if there is one.  At higher levels you can go in further.  (It also depends<br/>
on how well-camped the areas are, the more heavily camped, the safer.)<br/>

&gt; when you have a Shaman you don&#39;t just have healing - you have slow mob...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I WAS four blue bubs away from 53 - but due to an un-rez&#39;d death (long story<br/>
&gt; involving my own stupidity...) I&#39;m not back to five - so I&#39;m looking forward<br/>
&gt; to 53.  I&#39;m in a small guild where we have a core group of people around<br/>
&gt; 47-51.  We do have a 54 cleric but he is either rarely on - or on alternates<br/>
&gt; not in guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The core group in addition to me is Four Druids between 46-53; two 49/51<br/>
&gt; Paladins; and a 49 Ranger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Two questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Do you all think that a Bard/Druid/Paladin group can handle the &quot;hard&quot;<br/>
&gt; areas?  What minimum levels should my partners be?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Any advise on where to go &quot;practice&quot; my crowd control skills and the<br/>
&gt; groups efforts in general without worry about group wipes?  I&#39;m guessing<br/>
&gt; Chardok zone-out.  On Xegony it&#39;s usually pretty empty and you can hunt at<br/>
&gt; the zone out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes with the RIGHT group (ie bard and shaman instead of cleric and<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter) and four other people who are VERY good - you can go without<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; enchanter/cleric combo.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My own personal experience with myself doing crowd control - if I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; either cleric healing power - or shaman slowing power - I&#39;m going to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; killed trying to do crowd control in Sebelis.  Maybe I&#39;ve been unlucky<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the group&#39;s I&#39;ve had; and also - I haven&#39;t got 53 yet - so I&#39;m relying on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Charm or Pixie Strike - but the point I think is still there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         But maybe - I&#39;m just mediocre...  Regardless - maybe you feel that<br/>
&gt; 80 per<br/>
&gt; &gt; cent of the people in the game are mediocre.  Maybe they are - but to me<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game is about having an enjoyable entertainment experience; not about<br/>
&gt; &gt; competing.<br/>
