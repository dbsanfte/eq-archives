[Quote from original post: Tonight, as my group and I were on our way to Dalnir, we decided to take a short cut through Cabilis. So we invised ourselves and strolled past the guards. I was killed lickity-split, while my pals weren&#39;t. Wondering why the guards saw through my invis and not the others, we tried a few experiments to find out. Well we found the answer. <br/>
<br/>
Seems if you invis or camo yourself, then someone else tries to overwrite your invis with one of their own, you are now visible, though the icon remains. <br/>
<br/>
This brings up all sorts of issues (intentional PKing?). I&#39;d like to know if Verant is aware of this bug or not?]<br/>
<br/>
This is a bug that we are aware of. If anyone casts a buff of any kind on you while you are invis, you are then visible to NPCs even though the icon remains. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for bringing it up though, I&#39;ll see if I can find out where it is on the to-do list.<br/>
<br/>
End clip.<br/>

In the meantime, don&#39;t try grouping with 7 of your fiends - you dirty rotten no good exploiters!!!  We have guides posted everywhere who will ban you without recourse!  They have been given strict instructions to stop helping people who die zoning - sorry but some of you are just gonna fall thru the cracks - literally - while we bring you vicious exploiters to justice! And if I remember, and happen to see someone at the water cooler, I&#39;ll ask him to ask around and see if anyone feels like fixing your invisibility bug.<br/>
