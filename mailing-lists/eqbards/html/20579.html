&gt;trouble here and there because they do stun a lot.  I<br/>
&gt;also went to EF and soloed snow orc shaman and a few<br/>
&gt;mamouths.  sometimes you&#39;ll need to throw on selos and<br/>
&gt;bellow a few times to soften the mobs up a bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For the record, I was wearing banded and maybe some<br/>
&gt;bronze at the time.  Normal instruments as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for the missed notes, i would suggest going somewhere and leaving yourself logged<br/>
in overnight to max your brass skill.  i use a corner in butcherblock near the gfay zone<br/>
line.  you definitely won&#39;t have a chance at soloing if everytime you try to start DDD you<br/>
get a bunch of fizzles.  i think other places i have heard that you can leave brass on<br/>
are the shady swashbuckler cave and, um, well i guess that&#39;s all that i remember, heh.<br/>
<br/>
oh, one other place you can solo is at the arena zone, there are 2 aviak guards who are<br/>
pretty weak for their con.  there&#39;s supposedly a single spawn somewhere too, but i didn&#39;t<br/>
spend a lot of time there.</div>
