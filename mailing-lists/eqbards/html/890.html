Enchanters, a Bard&#39;s best friend<br/>

Why should every Bard have an Enchanter as their best friend?<br/>
Well Enchanters are the only class that can buff charisma.<br/>
Charisma is a Bard&#39;s best friend, a higher charisma makes Bard<br/>
songs much harder to resist. Example: The other day while<br/>
waiting for the boat in Butcherblock an friendly Enchantress<br/>
cast a couple of Cha buffs on me raising my natural good looks<br/>
(Cha 105) to 141. When I got off the boat in Freeport I<br/>
noticed a dark elf NPC hanging out on the rocks near the dock.<br/>
She con&#39;d as a dangerous blue, which normally would spell<br/>
death for my at 18th level. But I decided to chance it, to my<br/>
surprise the battle went quickly with none of my Bellows being<br/>
resisted and all of them hitting for max (10) damage. With<br/>
just my base Cha of 105 I have had my bellow&#39;s resisted by<br/>
greens and have never seen a battle were even a majority of<br/>
them would do max damage. So all you enchanters out there keep<br/>
those charisma buffs handy for your team&#39;s bard. It will work<br/>
wonders.<br/>
