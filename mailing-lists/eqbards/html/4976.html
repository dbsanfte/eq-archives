<div id="ygrps-yiv-782134564">This may seem like superstition on my part but the goblin wizards in<br/>
Butcherblock seemed to have been given a boost in their nastiness. I was<br/>
soloing these guys at lvl 12 without losing more than two bubbles of damage,<br/>
then recently at level 13 I hit a few once more and almost died a few times.<br/>
I know that things that con the same can vary in potency but this is a big<br/>
difference. I&#39;ve also noticed this with the skeletons outside of the<br/>
Minotaur Cave in Steamfront, which helped me make my 12th level and turned<br/>
promptly to conning green, only to return to blue now at 14th level.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else see similar things like this happening?<br/>

&gt; &gt; lightning and Shock of Force. Her primary AoE is the Frost<br/>
&gt; &gt; Spiral of Al&#39;kabor. How do I know? Because I usually get<br/>
&gt; &gt; the resist message for force shock, and occassionally get<br/>
&gt; &gt; it for Frost Spiral. I also think the chance of resisting<br/>
&gt; &gt; is weighed against either your level or your defense<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill, because anyone who has been to Unrest at level 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; and tangled with a hag died in 2-3 spells, while a L30<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes quite a beating before dying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I honestly think there are two resist checks going on, kind of<br/>
&gt; like how when we Chain something it can resist or not, then it<br/>
&gt; immediately has a chance of breaking out.  It think there is<br/>
&gt; one extraordinarily difficult resist check to see if you can<br/>
&gt; take zero damage from the spell.  Then there is another resist<br/>
&gt; check to determine how much damage you take.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night while completing the Staff of the Observers quest,<br/>
&gt; I ran across a goblin wizard in Butcherblock.  These guys<br/>
&gt; killed me way too often when I was level 5-7 so I decided to<br/>
&gt; toy around with him a bit.  I used Curtail (L30 song, targeted<br/>
&gt; DoT) on him to kill him - no melee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; During the entire fight, he peppered me with spells (they sure<br/>
&gt; have got a lot of mana - I&#39;d estimate 20-30 spells).  Most of<br/>
&gt; them only took off 4 or 5 points damage, but a couple did<br/>
&gt; about 20.  Then on one spell, I saw a &quot;You resist the...&quot;<br/>
&gt; message and took no damage.  I had *never* seen that message<br/>
&gt; for a DD prior to last night (I don&#39;t remember the name<br/>
&gt; offhand but it was a fire-based DD spell).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That it took a level 8ish mob 20+ spells for me (L30) to see<br/>
&gt; one complete resist should tell you something about how<br/>
&gt; difficult this check is.  I was singing Elemental Rhythms at<br/>
&gt; the time with drum equipped, which put my MR in the 80s and FR<br/>
&gt; in the 70s.  I wasn&#39;t trying too hard to keep it up though, so<br/>
&gt; it may have dropped to my natural 35/25.<br/>
