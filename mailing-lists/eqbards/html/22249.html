<br/>
I have some information about changes we will be making to a few bard songs with the next patch. <br/>
<br/>
-Songs with a damage absorbtion component will have that component removed.<br/>
<br/>
-Pixie Strike will have its secondary resist reduced.<br/>
<br/>
-Song of Twilight will be singable at any time of the day. Its secondary resist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration. And it will require an instrument.  <br/>
<br/>
-The single target haste spells will be self-only.<br/>
<br/>
We will also be revising the bardic epic weapon. <br/>
<br/>
This should all go live with the next patch, which for now we are tentatively scheduling for late next week.<br/>

Well, how lovely :).<br/>
<br/>
OK, am I confused or did Twilight already work at any time of day?  Also, I noticed that Caster&#39;s Realm says Twilight pushes the mobs, rather than pulls them ;P.<br/>
<br/>
And this means Jonthan&#39;s Provocation is now self-only, yes?<br/>
