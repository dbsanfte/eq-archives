<br/>
Each level you get 1 song (later on some levels you<br/>
get more than 1 but not for a long time.)  Save the<br/>
loot off your kills and sell it to a vendor.  Run some<br/>
of the quests and save.  <br/>
<br/>
The level 3 song - Jig of Vigor - can be every<br/>
helpful.  It restores stamina - which you lose when<br/>
you fight and when you jump alot.  Jumping while you<br/>
run is an old trick for running a bit faster.  Jig<br/>
helps you do that when you need to escape from a bad<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 &quot;views&quot; you can selected with the F10 key.<br/>
 One has a smaller view screen and lots of option and<br/>
control boxes.  Another is all grapgical and no text<br/>
or controls. The third one is called &quot;fullscreen&quot;  or<br/>
full screen overlay.  It fills your screen and has<br/>
transparent boxes for essential items (text, spell<br/>
gems, health, group, self and buff icons.)<br/>
<br/>
It sound to me like you have the &quot;screens same<br/>
resolution&quot; checked.  Use F10 to find the view with<br/>
all the controls showing.  Use the &quot;options&quot; button to<br/>
get settings for general, display, keyboard, mouse and<br/>
chat.  In display - look for &quot;screens same resolution&quot;<br/>
and change that setting.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and enjoy!<br/>

&gt; Trilogy and <br/>
&gt; installed everything, seems to run ok.  I now have a<br/>
&gt; level 3 Bard <br/>
&gt; with whom I&#39;ve been practicing singing.  He is now<br/>
&gt; up to &quot;Feeble&quot; <br/>
&gt; does this mean i can start singing?  Do I need to<br/>
&gt; learn songs?  How <br/>
&gt; do i do that?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, is the game supposed to run in full screen? I<br/>
&gt; have it on <br/>
&gt; 800x600 and it doesnt fill the screen.  And at<br/>
&gt; higher resolutions the <br/>
&gt; game screen gets smaller.  Mind I have tweaked<br/>
&gt; voodoo3 drivers <br/>
&gt; running in XP so i can use Glide with other games so<br/>
&gt; that could be <br/>
