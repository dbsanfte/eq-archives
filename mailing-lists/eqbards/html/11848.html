<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609465599">Fflam is too too something!  So Fflamson it is.  Call me unimaginative.  My <br/>
first RPG.  But I read these great books as a kid, and Fflewduer was a kind <br/>
of silly bard that had noble roots (King of a small realm).  I wanted my <br/>
bard to be like that.  All derring do and loyalty to the hilt.  So I chose <br/>
that name for my bard.<br/>
<br/>
When starting a game like EQ, I was confronted with choices covering race, <br/>
class, sex, stats, and name.  I figured I wanted to be a bard because they <br/>
could do so many things and I didn&#39;t have a clear idea of what to get out of <br/>
EQ.  I chose as best I could the most general of possiblities so not to <br/>
limit myself.  A half elf gets to start in 3 different towns, a bard can do <br/>
most quests, I spread my points around not knowing too much, but skimping on <br/>
Charisma (only 5 points there).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway there you have it.  BTW, it is possible to use several different <br/>
email services that don&#39;t have my name in the email, but why hide?  I like <br/>
me.  I like my bard.  I have a good time.  I play the game like I live, with <br/>
honor and a sense of humor.<br/>
