I hope, when the EQ servers at Verant are brought down, or even before, that<br/>
the software is released to us,  so we can run it at home, and be able to<br/>
play with a group of friends.  No lag, no spam, no trains....just you and a<br/>
group (or so) of your friends on your server.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, not many personal machines can come close to the server farms they<br/>
must be running per server, however, (just an example), if only you and 5<br/>
other people are on there, you only need the one zone up anyway.  Maybe<br/>
there&#39;s enough horsepower in a 1GZ machine with 128MB of ram to host 6<br/>
people, the zone their in, and all zones it connects to, just in case you<br/>
gotta run.  :)  Just enough to play...<br/>
<br/>
/wishful thinking off<br/>
<br/>
Until then, I&#39;ll keep playing until I don&#39;t enjoy it anymore, at which point<br/>
I&#39;ll just quietly fade away...<br/>

<br/>
yup, that&#39;s the low down and dirty...<br/>
<br/>
the good side of this though is the getting your spouse/kid&#39;s char off your<br/>
account onto their own though... but it will be basically used for selling<br/>
or twinking purposes i have a feeling.<br/>

<br/>
Big time.  Currently - if you have some &quot;extra&quot; characters you don&#39;t<br/>
want -<br/>
you&#39;d have to sell your entire account.  If there&#39;s characters on that<br/>
account you want to keep you&#39;re SOL.<br/>
<br/>
Now you can simply buy a new account - transfer the char over - and sell<br/>
it<br/>
off singly.<br/>
