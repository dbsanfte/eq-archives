<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439948428">Sorry that it&#39;s a little late.  I&#39;ve been working on a side project.  <br/>
If anyone knows anything about interrupts generated by a keyboard, <br/>
please send me an e-mail (hint hint hint).<br/>
<br/>
Changes from the previous version are:<br/>
<br/>
Jothan&#39;s Provocation does not have a Dam Ab Shld and has 50% haste<br/>
Niv&#39;s doesn&#39;t stick with song of shields.<br/>
Song of Twilight effects were listed under song of Dawn.<br/>
Vov (50) is 30% haste.<br/>
Johnthan&#39;s Prov (45) is Self only, voice and it&#39;s effects are <br/>
currently unknown.<br/>
Melody of Ervaj is now 50.<br/>
Celerity (36) is 20% haste.<br/>
<br/>
Major Change: Since there are large holes in the damage tables, our <br/>
DoT songs (2, 18, 30, 38, 46, 48) now use formulas instead of tables; <br/>
these formulas are close, but not necessarily as accurate.<br/>
<br/>
As in the last time, right click and do a &quot;Save Target As...&quot; on the <br/>
files.<br/>
You can get a .zip version here:<br/>
