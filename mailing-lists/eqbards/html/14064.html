<b>Subject:</b> RE: (OT) Lower level discrimination was Play Time? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279222077">I doubt it will change.  More likely I will still be complaining about<br/>
overcrowding at the higher levels, much as I am now.  The only time I<br/>
thought there wasn&#39;t overcrowding was at levels 12-15 when I was in Paw.<br/>
That place was Empty with a capital E!  So was Kerra Isle.  Once they no<br/>
longer provided useful xp I found myself running into zones with 100+ people<br/>
again.  Even 45 people in Najena is way too many, that zone is tiny!  143 in<br/>
E Karana was pretty pointless too, unless you just wanted to travel.  I have<br/>
no doubt that the higher levels suffer from overcrowding, but I think its<br/>
just as prevalent at lower levels.  &#39;sides we all know you&#39;re not a<br/>
powergamer Harm, else you&#39;d have solo&#39;d Naggy as many times as Rokenn by<br/>
now...<br/>

  I wanted to answer this, and quote things from the message<br/>
  but I haven&#39;t the energy.  I&#39;ll tell you this much:<br/>
<br/>
  I made level 50 after 9 months, Verant suggested it would take 12<br/>
  months to make level 50.  I guess I&#39;m smarter than the average <br/>
  bard.  But clumping me in the powergamers cliq is your own false<br/>
  take on this.  If you&#39;re looking for someone to blame, don&#39;t look<br/>
  this way.<br/>
 <br/>
  All I can tell you right now is your tune will change.  Mine did.<br/>
