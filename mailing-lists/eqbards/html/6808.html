&gt;Actually my main char was a Dark Elf and guess what. You rarely run to the<br/>
&gt;guards. For the most part most newbies of the evil races rarely run to the<br/>
&gt;guards. I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to run to the guards you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;lose any expierence at levels 1-5 and then when you do it&#39;s easyto gain it<br/>
&gt;back. Personally I have no problem with people killing guards. I also don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;see why others complainbecause it gets you ready for the higher levels when<br/>
&gt;there are no guards around to help.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll have to disagree here.  As a low-level Ogre, I regularly run to the<br/>
guards at the dark cities, because I get overwhelmed by one thing or a<br/>
dozen others.<br/>
<br/>
It can be frustrating to newbies to lose their &quot;set-in-place&quot; guards,<br/>
however, I think we ALL appreciate when the wandering guards are<br/>
eradicated.  &#39;otf kill-stealing guards!<br/>
