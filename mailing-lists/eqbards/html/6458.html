<div id="ygrps-yiv-198218962">About an hour ago in Unrest, I was pulling stuff from the first floor.<br/>
The group I was in had a druid who kept everyone sow&#39;d, so I was only<br/>
planning on using Selo&#39;s inside the house if a ghoul rooted me.<br/>
<br/>
Or rather I should say when a ghoul rooted me, as in so many trips in it&#39;s<br/>
bound to happen.  And when it did, I got a rather nasty shock as Selo&#39;s<br/>
neither took effect nor broke the root.  There was no message whatsoever,<br/>
and I was beat down two bubbles before I made it outside.<br/>
<br/>
Fair warning from here, if not from eqnews.txt.<br/>
