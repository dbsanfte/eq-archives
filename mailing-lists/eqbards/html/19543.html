<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098206457">Make sure that you are not playing a song - then open your inventory screen<br/>
and right click it.  I think that you could put the inv slot onto a hot key<br/>
pad but then you may need to be in the F10 view for it to work (not sure but<br/>
I know you have to F10 to open backpacks and such when they are hot keyed)<br/>
Most likely, you just need to stop song then right cilick.  I doubt they<br/>
have a level cap above 44 on the item.<br/>

&gt; Just recently bought a pair of singing steel boots myself and I paid a<br/>
&gt; nice round 2k for them.  I still feel it&#39;s a lot of money for a pair<br/>
&gt; of shoes, but it finally breaks up that damn blue I&#39;ve been getting<br/>
&gt; bored with ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is how do I get the things to give me some water,<br/>
&gt; right-click doesn&#39;t seem to work??  Not sure I want to drink something<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s been so close to my feet when I&#39;m wandering through swamps, but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s the thought that counts!<br/>
