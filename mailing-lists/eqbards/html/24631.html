<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649789928">Does anyone have a url that for a point-based loot-rules system? My current <br/>
guild is going through the &quot;big guild&quot; growing pains.<br/>
<br/>
Current problems are based around things like weighing whether full-time <br/>
should get precedence over part-time players (me being a part-time player <br/>
have my own opinion on this) and whether certain classes should be excluded <br/>
from particular loots (us bards tend to get shunted aside for the melee <br/>
classes as an example).<br/>
<br/>
For the record, at this time, I believe that people who participate in more <br/>
raids should get a weighted advantage over part-timers, but not to the <br/>
part-timer&#39;s exclusion. As for class exclusions, as a bard it&#39;s a sensitive <br/>
subject to me. I&#39;d prefer no class exclusions myself, just restrict it to <br/>
those who could actually use the item. Another bard in my guild left when <br/>
he ranted about being told he could not roll for a breastplate somewhere in <br/>
Velious.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously a sticky situation. Since I&#39;m on the rules committee for my <br/>
guild, I figured I&#39;d find out how other guilds may have tried to solve <br/>
these and other dilemmas. Though, one nice thing is that there are 3 bards <br/>
on the rules committee. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we all feel it&#39;s best to get rules written into stone that are <br/>
approved by a large majority of the guild (3/4th I believe). All sorts of <br/>
problems could be sorted out once we have a set up rules that are not <br/>
changed arbitrarily.<br/>
