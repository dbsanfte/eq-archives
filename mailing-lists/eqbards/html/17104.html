No argument there.  What&#39;s keeping me from playing my<br/>
enchanter is the downtime.  I also have a monk, but I just<br/>
bring him out when I had to camp in the planes.  He kills<br/>
something, then sits on his butt while I read a magazine<br/>
waiting for the word to come back.  :0<br/>

Heh, interesting my monk does the same thing :)<br/>

I put up with this at lower levels, but at the higher<br/>
levels...  They really need to increase the range of this song<br/>
(yes I know they just increased it).  As it is right now, once<br/>
the song starts, someone can run out of range in about 0.4<br/>
seconds.  It is *impossible* for me to keep a group of 6 in<br/>
the song effect unless we all start off running at normal<br/>
speed, then I start the song.  If someone gets lagged, takes a<br/>
wrong turn, or chases a ghost for longer than 0.4 seconds,<br/>
they are out of range.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This is such a pain, I usually try to pick the person in the group with the<br/>
slowest computer to lead and have everyone follow.   They really need to<br/>
make this song zone wide (ya right!)<br/>

Ya, but can the enchanter as easily heal one person as six? :) or Dot one<br/>
mob as 10?<br/>
