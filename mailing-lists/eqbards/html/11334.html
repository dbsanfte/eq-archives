&gt;<br/>
&gt; For awhile on Prexus, there were 4 DW shamans making a HUGE<br/>
&gt; supply of pets to hunt on Tower island.  We spent from level 20<br/>
&gt; to about 24 just pounding on pets with probably about 40 other<br/>
&gt; people (even then there was PLENTY to hunt).  In fact for a<br/>
&gt; while, my guild had two full parties of 6 camping a spot on the<br/>
&gt; island.  My brother&#39;s druid was pulling for one party, dropping<br/>
&gt; the pets off, getting a quick heal if needed and running back for<br/>
&gt; more.  He kept both parties of 6 OOM all night long.  This<br/>
&gt; Nirvana went away after about a week and a half when the servers<br/>
&gt; were reset and wizards spawned instead of shamans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you can get a group of level 50&#39;s to go down there and fix the<br/>
&gt; spawns, it was a GREAT time and awesome XP, although you won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make a dime (no loot).<br/>

&gt; &gt; I also just hit 20 and decided to give Lake Rathe a try. Mind you<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have not<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually hunted anything yet, but from a brief swim around the lake it<br/>
&gt; &gt; seemed as though there would be plenty to hunt and hopefully I will find<br/>
&gt; &gt; some pickup groups.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; This has been asked over and over I&#39;m sure but..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As a level 20 bard, where is a good place to go? I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all about the level chart on AllaKazam&#39;s page, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; found it to be seriously flawed so I don&#39;t follow it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; PS: Maybe we could come up with a list or chart for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bards between all of us..<br/>
