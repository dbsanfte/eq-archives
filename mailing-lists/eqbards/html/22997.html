<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774138215">Kit, I understand what you&#39;re saying and I do have to point out that class<br/>
balance is different on each server - or I would think, depending on factors<br/>
such as how mature the server is.  I bet there are servers where necro/druid<br/>
population is sky high because they were new servers when necro/druid were<br/>
THE choices.   However, I do have to agree that there are fewer bards. One<br/>
of the reasons I think that is is not necessarily the difficulty of playing<br/>
a bard, although I do think it is more difficult, but that bards go through<br/>
their &quot;bad, weak period&quot; very early - say around levels 9-22, and a LOT of<br/>
people never make it through that.  If you do, it only gets better and<br/>
better :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would agree if it were not for one thing.  Difficulty of <br/>
&gt; actual play.<br/>
&gt; There is no other class which even remotely approaches the <br/>
&gt; actual physical<br/>
&gt; difficulty of play which the bard class presents.  I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; think bards are<br/>
&gt; adequately recompensed for that aspect of the playability <br/>
&gt; factor; in fact I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think it even enters into the equation in Verant&#39;s mind because<br/>
&gt; despite their claims to the contrary it is quite evident that <br/>
&gt; no one there<br/>
&gt; plays a bard regularly.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that if all the classes were properly balanced we <br/>
&gt; would see a more<br/>
&gt; balanced representation of the classes in the overall <br/>
&gt; population.  That is<br/>
&gt; not the case.  Certain classes so far outnumber others that <br/>
&gt; it is readily<br/>
&gt; apparent there must be a reason for it.  Certain other <br/>
&gt; classes, including<br/>
&gt; bards, are so vastly underrepresented that there also must be <br/>
&gt; a reason for<br/>
&gt; that.  Personal preference would obviously create some <br/>
&gt; variation, but across<br/>
&gt; a population as large as this one that variation would not be <br/>
&gt; at the levels<br/>
&gt; we see now.  Below is just a sample from E&#39;ci that I took in <br/>
&gt; the off-peak<br/>
&gt; hours when I could get some actual numbers.  Note that <br/>
&gt; &#39;Anonymous&#39; will<br/>
&gt; lower the numbers shown for some classes, but typically <br/>
&gt; should be fairly<br/>
&gt; equal for all classes except those with high &quot;request&quot; <br/>
&gt; factors like druids,<br/>
&gt; shamans, enchanters, and clerics.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Note these numbers are the averages over 4 nites at around 3am mst.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Warriors		32+	too many to list<br/>
&gt; 	Rogues		9.5<br/>
&gt; 	Monks			5.5<br/>
&gt; 	Rangers		30<br/>
&gt; 	Paladins		27<br/>
&gt; 	Shadowknights	17.5<br/>
&gt; 	Bards			5<br/>
&gt; 	Wizards		19.25<br/>
&gt; 	Magicians		29.75<br/>
&gt; 	Necromancers	32+	too many to list<br/>
&gt; 	Enchanters		25+	One night there were too many to<br/>
&gt; list<br/>
&gt; 	Clerics		31+	Two nights there were too many to list<br/>
&gt; 	Druids		32+	too many to list<br/>
&gt; 	Shamans		23.75<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	With over 600 people on the server this means that <br/>
&gt; either half the<br/>
&gt; server was 	Anonymous or Roleplaying (Highly unlikely) or <br/>
&gt; those classes<br/>
&gt; which were too many 	to list were actually much, much higher <br/>
&gt; than 32 in<br/>
&gt; number.<br/>
