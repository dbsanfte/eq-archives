<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-518147810">remember that tidbit of info about Lord Grimlot giving the wakazishi quest?<br/>
that is what the lute used to be for, yet Lord Grimlot no longer gives the<br/>
quest (no i won&#39;t spoil it).  so yes it was a quest item.  i do not know<br/>
this for sure but was told so, and its an educated guess.<br/>
<br/>
currently the lute has no effects like the mistmoore drum.  either it will<br/>
remain useless or they will make it part of a quest or give it an effect.<br/>
so basically hold on to it and use it instead of a normal lute.<br/>

&gt; Yeah, likely it will be a quest item, and when you finish it, <br/>
&gt; you will get<br/>
&gt; 16 copper and a rusty short sword. Oh, and faction, of course. ;)<br/>
