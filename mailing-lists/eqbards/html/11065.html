&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the developers totally at fault on this one either.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, I think once the game went live, the accountants took<br/>
&gt; &gt;over and I strongly suspect that the development group is on a very low<br/>
&gt; &gt;maintenance budget now. The speed at which changes are made, and the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d buy this except that with the money they have rolling in it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; a big proposition to do the minimal testing/consideration they aren&#39;t doing.<br/>
&gt; Also the accountants would be doing everything they could to make sure that<br/>
&gt; gravy train never stops, which means they would be slowing down all changes<br/>
&gt; to make certain they did not piss anyone off and lose customers.<br/>
&gt; Looks more like sloppy developers too busy patting themselves on the back to<br/>
&gt; me.  Hmmm, on second thought maybe they are all too busy playing EQ to<br/>
&gt; actually have time to code!<br/>
