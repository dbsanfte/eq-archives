<div id="ygrps-yiv-626189344">the mobs listed are way out of date.  since most old-world items are<br/>
obsolete with kunark (not all though, e.g. CoF), sometimes the points for<br/>
those are made on the spot and are a fraction of what they used to be.<br/>
<br/>
basically, those who put the time in and attend the most raids have a better<br/>
chance at getting items they want.  i got the 2nd SS BP, the 2nd SS Legs,<br/>
the 3rd SSS, etc.  i don&#39;t put in nearly as much time as the other 2 active<br/>
bards.  our guildleader has 89 points, i have 2 hehe.  the system has<br/>
changed quite a bit with kunark, and while everyone in the guild knows about<br/>
the changes, they have not been reflected on the guild page, but the premise<br/>
is still there.  before kunark started everyone was required to choose a<br/>
primary character, since most of us had mulitple level 50&#39;s.  what&#39;s funny<br/>
is that almost no one chose their original level 50 (i did).  secondaries do<br/>
not get items until all primaries have it or the primary is so negative in<br/>
points from getting other items that the loot sits in an officer&#39;s vault<br/>
long enough to justify a secondary getting it, but that person must use<br/>
their points on the secondary of course.  if you are required to play a<br/>
secondary it does not matter too much, points are earned by the player not<br/>
the character you play.  this system is designed only for boss mobs, not<br/>
planar raids.  after time we have determined which items &quot;should&quot; go to<br/>
which classes.  only thing i can think of as an example may be the cloak of<br/>
piety, which would go to melee before casters.<br/>
<br/>
one officer maintains the system but it is not his responsibility to know<br/>
who went to each raid.  we have 1 person who leads a raid (rotated between<br/>
officers, since leading a raid is no walk in the park), takes names, forms<br/>
groups, and e-mails that information to the officer who tracks points.  some<br/>
raids are set points (trak=1 point, VS=0.5, PD=1.25, etc.).  other raids are<br/>
calculated depending on what drops and how many people are there (total<br/>
points of items dropped/number of people = how many points for that raid).<br/>
they have some type of script to easily update it on the web page.  some<br/>
items are set points (trak BP=20, VS legs=15) and other times items must be<br/>
determined on the spot because they are new (like in VP).<br/>
<br/>
well it sounds complicated but it is very straight-forward once you are<br/>
involved in it.  almost everyone who sees a point system for the first time<br/>
hates it or distrusts it or says they would never use it.  i can not say<br/>
enough how much I LOVE IT.  it is very objective and very fair.  there are<br/>
so many times something drops that there is not a lotto at all, and most<br/>
lottoes are 2-3 people tops.  there was a pick-up nagafen raid once where 35<br/>
people were in on GoFM.<br/>
<br/>
oh well, you could probably write a thesis on our damn system, which i came<br/>
close to, so i will stop now =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; So you guys use a point system?  I seem to remember talking <br/>
&gt; about this in a<br/>
&gt; thread a while back.  We have discussed using points on and off but it<br/>
&gt; always comes down to the fear that they won&#39;t be assigned <br/>
&gt; uniformly and also<br/>
&gt; that nobody would want the responsibility of maintaining such <br/>
&gt; a thing.   We<br/>
&gt; use more of a deferment system.. aka peer pressure.. which <br/>
&gt; seems to work<br/>
&gt; most of the time, though.  Do you like the point system? Can <br/>
&gt; you use point<br/>
&gt; for any item you want or does it have to be an item that is <br/>
&gt; &quot;clearly&quot; for<br/>
&gt; your class?<br/>
