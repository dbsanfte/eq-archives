&gt; For all practical purposes you can assume both are 30th level.<br/>
&gt; One is level 30 and one is level 27 or 28 if I recall, they are<br/>
&gt; not higher than level 30 for sure.  Choon conn&#39;d even at 30, and<br/>
&gt; both are fixed level spawns.  (However, I could be one level off, <br/>

&gt; A level 32-35 bard can solo either of the two with fear+chains<br/>
&gt; very successfully, anything below that and you&#39;ll get too <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually it was easier to charm one and have them fight each<br/>
other.  The zone is huge, and well suited to staying out of<br/>
their melee range with Accelerando.  The tricky part is<br/>
charming the winner.  I charmed Choon, and when he dropped to<br/>
about 5% hp, I switched to Froon who was still at about 30%.<br/>
Well, Choon put up quite a fight, and Froon finally won with<br/>
about 2% hp remaining.  Oh well, at least that made him pretty<br/>
easy to chain/fear.<br/>
<br/>
Just be sure you know where the ogre camp is and stay away.<br/>
Chief Goonda seems to have a huge aggro radius (so do Choon<br/>
and Froon for that matter).  Goonda moves at SoC speed, and<br/>
was able to slowly catch up to me (L36 with a mistmore drum)*.<br/>
I had to Chain him to lose him, which was a problem because I<br/>
didn&#39;t have him targeted.  When I switched to an external view<br/>
so I could target him behind me, I ran into a tree and he got<br/>
a couple hits for 80+ on me.  Yow!<br/>
<br/>
* I think SoC is just 2.0x normal running speed.  I&#39;m<br/>
currently slightly faster than 2.0x normal running speed with<br/>
my MM drum.  But I&#39;ve noticed while playing my other<br/>
characters that NPCs can slowly catch up to me, probably due<br/>
to lag or some &quot;fix&quot; on Verant&#39;s part to assure NPCs chasing<br/>
you can always keep up with you.  So SoC on an NPC is slightly<br/>
faster than 2.0x normal running speed for a PC.<br/>
