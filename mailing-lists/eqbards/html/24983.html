<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776458880">My bard&#39;s wearing pretty pathetic gear, only leather and soft<br/>
wicker... hey, she&#39;s only level 10. Got the green pants and<br/>
sleeves, rest is brown, no hat. Several people have complimented<br/>
me on the look. Dunno what I&#39;ll do when I get higher since I<br/>
can&#39;t stand the look of banded on a human (or just about any<br/>
female for that matter), bronze weighs a ton, and waiting until I<br/>
can get my lambent is an awfully long time to be wearing leather<br/>
even if it does look good. But after spending about 15 levels in<br/>
banded with my cleric (she&#39;s now 29 and working on quests for the<br/>
nice gold plate), I never want to look like a swimsuit model<br/>
again. Suggestions on good looking and relatively cheap gear for<br/>
an low level bard? (besides twinking. The poor cleric&#39;s broke as<br/>
it is, and I&#39;m not too fond of twinking anyway.)<br/>

&gt; When I started getting imbrued though, it didn&#39;t look as good.<br/>
&gt; Then I got<br/>
&gt; some kylong, and a hero bracer, and it was commented on several<br/>
&gt; times that I<br/>
&gt; was really multicolored. Now I have managed to go mostly green,<br/>
&gt; between SS<br/>
&gt; and dragon stuff from WW. Still have my silver helm (I love my<br/>
&gt; hammerhead<br/>
&gt; bucket!) and my imbrued boots to break the monotony of all<br/>
&gt; green and it<br/>
&gt; keeps me from looking like a ranger! I prefer green overall and<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; any major fashion shifts in the near future.<br/>
