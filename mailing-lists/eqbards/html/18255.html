&gt; This would include DD (Below) and DOTs (Chants).  If it doesn&#39;t break root<br/>
&gt; on application, it will have to expire on it&#39;s own or when another damage<br/>
&gt; doing spell is applied.  I watched my brother&#39;s Shaman stack 2 DOTs, Root,<br/>
&gt; and sit to med while watching the mobs hps drop... rerooting as necessary,<br/>
&gt; but usually was a long time.  If he would have Rooted, then applied the<br/>
&gt; DOTs, root would have expired much more often.<br/>

That&#39;s what can break the root. Druid dots and the chants don&#39;t and<br/>
should not cause a check for breaking. Or at least I rarely see my druid<br/>
dots break root. (now that druid&#39;s root is fixed I root/dot a lot while<br/>
soloing)<br/>
