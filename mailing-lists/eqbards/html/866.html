&gt;WTF? They must not know that they will get xp (and plenty of it) with you<br/>
&gt;around. OK, I don&#39;t remember exactly the floor and ceiling limit for<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;level ppl to group. I know up to like 20th it&#39;s a 4 lvl above or below<br/>
&gt;limit. But after 20th things change. When I was 20th I was able to group<br/>
&gt;with a 26th level person and get xp. When I was 23 I was grouping with 30th<br/>
&gt;level ppl and getting xp. 3-5 level differences at your level will not put<br/>
&gt;any significant dent in anyone&#39;s xp gains. They are just being either<br/>
&gt;ignorant, or greedy. My 32nd lvl friend used to party with 40th lvl ppl all<br/>
&gt;the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most of my former friends now hunt in GukBottom.  That dungeon is arranged<br/>
in 5-lvl areas... The first area is for 30-34 lvl chars, the next is for<br/>
35-39, etc..  My &quot;friends&quot; do not want to be &quot;bored&quot; by hunting &quot;mere blues&quot;<br/>
with me, when they could be hunting reds with their 35-39 or 40-44 lvl<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I have yet to be accepted into the Avatar hunting groups in<br/>
CazicThule.  Well, I was offered a temporary 1-hour spot last night, but I<br/>
was with a 33d lvl shaman and we wanted to be together.  Little did I know<br/>
until later that while I was offered a 1-hour slot, she was offered a<br/>
non-temporary spot.  She did not know of my offer.  We both turned down the<br/>
offers because we did not want to leave the other out. When I learned of the<br/>
dual offers, I may have lost one of the few over-35th lvl friends I have,<br/>
for I came slightly unglued over the slight that although we are equal lvl,<br/>
a mere bard is not good enough to warrant a full slot, only a temporary<br/>
while the group awaited someone else.  (Oddly enough, I have often asked for<br/>
spots to be saved for me since my former friends start playing an hour<br/>
before I get home from work... but they refuse to commit to the horrid idea<br/>
of saving a space.  More double standards.. =(   )<br/>
<br/>
Even my status as a &quot;mana bard&quot; does me little good.  I am about the 7th<br/>
highest bard on my server.  Unfortunately, there are only about 6 groups of<br/>
my level or higher people online at any one time.... Guess who gets left<br/>
out?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am quite unhappy in the game.  I have spent many hours helping<br/>
others, even unto my death, yet those I help do nothing for me in return.  I<br/>
see other bards being given plate breastpieces as reward for a single death<br/>
in melee, but I have not received a gift piece since lvl 25 when I received<br/>
a studded collar.  I see lvl 30 enchanters being taken into lvl 35-39<br/>
groups, but not 30-34 bards (no, I am not the only low-30s bard on MithMarr<br/>
with these problems).<br/>
