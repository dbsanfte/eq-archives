<div id="ygrps-yiv-947999410">Yea but I&#39;m only 37th level so its gonna be a while before I go to Karnor&#39;s.<br/>
So until I worsen my VS faction I can still trade/bank there.  If I bind<br/>
there is a completely different issue.  Banking/trading requires the Mask of<br/>
Deception, which I won&#39;t have if I die and return back to the bind point.<br/>
What I&#39;m interested in finding out is if a naked wood-elf can bind somewhere<br/>
in the evil outpost and work my way outside without getting smacked.  <br/>

I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.  A LOT of our gear comes from Karnors and killing<br/>
stuff in there will make you KOS in the evil outpost VERY fast.  Also<br/>
there&#39;s stuff in 2 other dungeons that rapidly lowers your faction at the<br/>
outpost.  I&#39;d recommend not binding there but it is, of course, your call ;)<br/>
