<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549157180">Just checked EQVault, and there is a post from Gordon about quest armor.  Said something about the quest armor being more difficult for some classes than others, and expect changes in the next few patches.  Ya&#39;ll smell that nerf headed straight for us, or am I just paranoid?<br/>

Also, did anybody notice shields on barbarians?  How come they fixed the shield graphic, but we are still strumming a stick, and not banging our my drums all day?<br/>

Sorry if this sounds like whinny...<br/>
