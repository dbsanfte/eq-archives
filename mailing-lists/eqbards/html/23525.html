&gt; &gt; &gt; Greetings...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was in skyfire the other night trying to get Eldrig to spawn.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; question I have is if he is on the same cycle as Black Scar, and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other named ones?  Seems like black scar, and some other named<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; chromodrac spanwed every time.  Is Eldrig just rare?  (Like the lava<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; walkder?)  Or is there some other trick to get him to spawn?<br/>
