<b>Subject:</b> Bard songs canceling spell effects, bug or feature? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536562038">When i found out selo&#39;s accelerando cancels a root i was pretty happy with<br/>
that unexpected feature. I was similarly pleased when i found out i can<br/>
charm a party member back into the group if he gets charmed. I was very<br/>
unhappy to find out however that levitate, underwater breathing, and<br/>
accelerando are over half the time useless in a group situation. All these<br/>
songs do nothing more than get everybody pissed at me because i just<br/>
canceled their sow or broke their journeyman boots. And Quellious help me<br/>
if i turn on levitate. <br/>
<br/>
These songs are rendered basically useless in a group setting because of<br/>
how they cancel their equivelent spell effects. So my question is, is this<br/>
a bug or a feature? I am torn between wanting to be able to cancel roots<br/>
and not cancel sow&#39;s. Ideally i would like to be able cancel roots and not<br/>
screw up a sow. Either way i would love to hear an official answer. The<br/>
whole spell stacking/canceling issue seems to still be fubard, for instance<br/>
i cant use the mask of the deciever to turn into a dark elf while a song is<br/>
playing. And if a song happens to be playing while the mask effect wears<br/>
off my songs lock up and i cant change or stop or start a song unless i<br/>
camp out.</div>
