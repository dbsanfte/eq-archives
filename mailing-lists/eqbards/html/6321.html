<div id="ygrps-yiv-276236095">Hey all,<br/>
1st time poster, long time lurker :) Even longer time Bard :)))<br/>
It&#39;s really nice to be able to read a list where you never really have to worry<br/>
about walking into a flame war.  Unfortunately, i have no interesting stories<br/>
to share, unless one finds the mindless slaughter of North Karanan Beetles for<br/>
4 levels interesting....(which is a good spot to go from 13 to 17-18, if you<br/>
don&#39;t need loot)<br/>
<br/>
I had a couple of item related questions for some of those here more<br/>
knowledgeable than me...but some of the questions may contain info that may be<br/>
viewed as spoiler....<br/>

Does anyone know the location of the Runed Lava Pendant or the Granite Bracer? <br/>
 Both of these items are pretty good stuff for a battle bard. (both have good<br/>
AC and STR buff)  I Believe that the RLP is dropped in Sol A (but i have no<br/>
idea which mob, anyone?)  And i have heard Rathe Mts. on the Granite Bracer,<br/>
but nothing err....concrete...sorry...<br/>
<br/>
Any info that anyone has beyond this (or even a confirmation) would be much<br/>
appreciated.<br/>

P.S. -&gt;  Was very upset when i got to 17th and found out that Mithril Quill was<br/>
Primary Hand only.  ruined my plan for dual wield : (<br/>

&quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>
adultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
