&gt;I don&#39;t get any music.  Is it a hardware issue or something?  Music would<br/>
&gt;make the experience so much more realistic.  Right now I just glow when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;singing.<br/>

conflict with your sound card.  Those who are simply missing the music<br/>
*may* have a sound-card conflict, but more likely, you simply have music<br/>
disabled. (I remember reading somewhere that it starts disabled.  I don&#39;t<br/>
remember if mine was, I always go through and tweak everything, anyway).<br/>
Check under &quot;options&quot; after you have the game started.  There is a button<br/>
for sound, and under sound, there are various sliders for controlling sound<br/>
and music levels.<br/>
IMHO ambient music is one of the things that makes EQ so engrossing.  Some<br/>
of the music really pulls you in, like the sound of Crushbone or the music<br/>
for Kelethin.  The music on the ship is pretty goofy, but it does have the<br/>
advantage of being very appropriate for a sea-faring jig.  Is music<br/>
necessary? No - but it sure makes it more fun!<br/>
