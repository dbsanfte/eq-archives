<div id="ygrps-yiv-700636947">I just did the same thing, when someone mentioned there were two brewing<br/>
lists.  Let&#39;s just hope some joker doesn&#39;t start a EQ-Bards list next or a<br/>
EQBard list.<br/>

&gt;The author is on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eq_bards@onelist.com">eq_bards@onelist.com</a> list.  Has there<br/>
&gt;been any thought to consolidating these two lists?  I was a<br/>
&gt;little confused as to which to subscribe to and ended up on<br/>
&gt;both (although the subscribe request to the other group<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t seem to have gone through yet).<br/>
