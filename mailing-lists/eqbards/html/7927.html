&gt; I agree with this.  Also, there is a big difference in twinking a character<br/>
&gt; that has never played, and twinking one who already has several high level<br/>
&gt; characters.  I have a level 27 bard, and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; suffer through the wimpiness of low levels with a new character I start.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found, after twinking a couple of characters on my original server<br/>
to various degrees, that I&#39;m having a lot more fun playing a new char on<br/>
a completely different server. Obviously this meant no twinking, and<br/>
even more, as I started on the first day the server opened, no cheap<br/>
items easily obtainable by low level chars. Half of the people I liked<br/>
on my original server are long gone now and the other half spend all<br/>
their time gathering gear for their other characters, which I found<br/>
boring, so making new freinds on a new server has also been fun.<br/>
<br/>
But, AFAIK, if someone wants to twink, who cares? I certainly don&#39;t.<br/>
And, with their obvious lack of concern for providing other things for<br/>
higher level people to do, obviously Verant doesn&#39;t either. In fact, I<br/>
think they probably hope people will stay interested in playing longer<br/>
by gathering gear for their newbie characters. There&#39;s certainly not<br/>
much else around to do.<br/>
