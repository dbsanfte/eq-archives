&gt; Could someone please explain something to me? Can a bard use a shield? I<br/>
&gt; have seen quite a lot of bards with shields and they are saying that they<br/>
&gt; can use them and on the other side you are saying here that bards don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; parrying. Doesn&#39;t that mean that we can&#39;t use shields? I allways thought<br/>
&gt; that parrying is the skill that you need if you want to use your shield. Ohh<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Parry typically means to deflect a blow using your weapon.  I<br/>
have no idea why UO chose to apply it to shield skill.  In EQ<br/>
your shield is just extra AC, like any other armor piece.<br/>
Parrying increases your chance to just avoid an attack, like<br/>
dodge does.  Riposte avoids the attack, and deflects it back<br/>
so the attacker takes damage (actually it&#39;s an attack<br/>
immediately following a parry, but the way it works in EQ is<br/>
that the attacker takes damage; the riposter&#39;s combat ability<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to matter - a successful riposte always results<br/>
in the original attacker taking damage).<br/>
