<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727930918">Ok, I am really bloody Mad now. I was contacted In-game by these morons last<br/>
night, after getting my character back. They seemed to have known about my<br/>
&quot;accident&quot; and then offered to sell me, buy things from me over the net with<br/>
real money (hackles raise) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.global-ent-services.com/eq.htm">http://www.global-ent-services.com/eq.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To top it all off, they live close to me in Michigan. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How did they know my character was deleted? And then they have the nerve to<br/>
ask me to buy things from them with a credit card! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can not, and will not stand for having to buy things with real money for<br/>
an online game! Nothing upsets me more than people who FARM items to sell on<br/>
Ebay, or whatever or wherever they sell. Get a damn job. Don&#39;t rob me of<br/>
having fun in an online game so you can make a damn profit!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I cannot even gather my thoughts, I am so mad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts are appreciated. This is just wrong, in my opinion.<br/>
