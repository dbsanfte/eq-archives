<div id="ygrps-yiv-422929933">What are the chances of a bard less than 30th level successfully Lamenting a<br/>
30+ mob? I would guess not very high.  Looks like the quest components<br/>
located in Solusek A as well as the carapace in Lower Guk will be the tough<br/>
ones to get for us younger bards.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Can you safely get to the area where the Solusek Mage and <br/>
&gt; &gt;Champion spawn by singing the Invis song or are there mobs <br/>
&gt; &gt;along the path that can See Invis?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If no shaman are nearby, you can make it.  But chances are if<br/>
&gt; you cannot fight your way in, you cannot fight your way out.<br/>
&gt; Some champions and mages are blue to me at 40.  Level 30 <br/>
&gt; monsters are nasty, it will take a strong group of level 30s<br/>
&gt; to attempt to break into the king&#39;s room.  Use Lament everywhere.<br/>
