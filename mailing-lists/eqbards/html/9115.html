<div id="ygrps-yiv-863886723">I think the reason the named treant attacked you is you probably ran by a <br/>
wolf or lion and accidently hit it with your song.  Those treants are like <br/>
all those goodie-goodie druid types who attack you if you attack their <br/>
precious animal friends.  They don&#39;t even ask if the animal attacked first...<br/>
<br/>
If you ever get a song stuck on again like that, try using the /stopsing or <br/>
/stopsong command.  I forget which it is, but it will stop your song.  Good <br/>
luck to you!<br/>
