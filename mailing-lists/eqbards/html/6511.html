<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229096739">I&#39;ve actually put EQ on a shelf for a while, mainly out of boredom and<br/>
frustration, but I keep thinking I&#39;ll come back to it, and I&#39;ve<br/>
continued to watch this list to see if Verant ever does anything to<br/>
make the game more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
So, now I see that Consonant Chains apparently has a bigger effect,<br/>
but fails much more often.  Is this the general consensus, or is it<br/>
possibly Verant&#39;s infamous non-random number generator at work again?<br/>
<br/>
I also see that Selo&#39;s no longer breaks root.  Sigh.  Well, I&#39;ve<br/>
figured for ages that that was a bug, so I&#39;m not surprised.  However,<br/>
it would be really nice if they fixed Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody at<br/>
the same time, so that we had an alternative way of achieving the same<br/>
result.  Clearly, ADM has been broken forever.  Now, I see that they<br/>
have supposedly fixed Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aura, but have they done<br/>
anything for ADM, or is it still a dud?<br/>
<br/>
In some ways it sucks that SoW overrides Selo&#39;s, but at least I no<br/>
longer have to worry about braking a party member&#39;s SoW when cranking<br/>
up the song.  Ideally, songs such as Selo&#39;s, Water Breathing, and Aria<br/>
of Eagles would temporarily override the spell equivalents when in<br/>
effect, and then the spell effects would continue to have their effect<br/>
once we stop singing.  However, I&#39;m not holding my breath.  At the<br/>
very least, I think we should ask for the ability to be able to turn<br/>
off our own SoW effect, just as you can supposedly cancel your own<br/>
levitation now.<br/>
