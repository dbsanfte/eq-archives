&gt;   I went to Mistmoore to browse around last night and help out some<br/>
&gt;   guildmembers.  I wanted to pick up a few items, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   50 paladin, 50 warrior, 50 bard, 39 druid, 39 wizard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The whole night yielded a few fangs, some wreaths, a few LotGP,<br/>
&gt;   a few Gypsy Lutes, and other crap I had no interest in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I knew enough about Mistmoore to get around, but last night I<br/>
&gt;   explored the whole damn place.  Also did a sacrifice run too.<br/>
&gt;   But first the pulling and clearing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The group above I was in cleared; the Maid, Butler, kitchen,<br/>
&gt;   east conference room, piano room, and foyer with no problems.<br/>
&gt;   That&#39;s half the 1st floor of the entire castle.  I&#39;m thinking<br/>
&gt;   about taking in a high powered group to clean out the whole<br/>
&gt;   place tonight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   So the sacrifice run.  I get Garton Viswin on tracking and<br/>
&gt;   me and the paladin make a run for the tower.  Finally get<br/>
&gt;   up there, and the joker has the damn pike.  Well, I look<br/>
&gt;   around... 3 mobs, two of them have pets, and then Garton.<br/>
&gt;   6 on 2 fight.  Rather, 6 (4 with HT) on 2 fight hehe.  Ah<br/>
&gt;   well, I&#39;ve got L50 experience to burn.  I know I&#39;m gonna<br/>
&gt;   die, I told the paladin.  Just make sure you kill Garton.<br/>
&gt;   I look around the rooom a bit more, trying to pick out the<br/>
&gt;   lucky mob I&#39;m gonna charm.  I always hated mistmoore naming<br/>
&gt;   on mobs.  I found the one I thought to be the most powerful<br/>
&gt;   and ripped off a charm on it.  The paladin then started to<br/>
&gt;   beat the crap out of Garton.  My soul seductress or whatever<br/>
&gt;   is nuking the shit out of a deathly something while two pets<br/>
&gt;   and some vampire defiler are just clobbering me.  A couple<br/>
&gt;   of recharms, and on LH on me, and one of the enemies drops.<br/>
&gt;   Then Garton dies, paladin is oom, and I have like 25 hp left.<br/>
&gt;   Whatever disease DoT I had on me killed me at that point since<br/>
&gt;   I was fearing away all the mobs, waiting for a heal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It was probably one of the best nights I&#39;ve had in a while.<br/>
&gt;   Well, if the dhampyre would have dropped me a cloak, I would<br/>
&gt;   have been much much happier.<br/>
