&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; I noticed that even though Verant has finally given bards something we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; really wanted (meditate), that I got in this morning to a full inbox of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>people<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; griping about the fact that we don&#39;t &quot;surf&quot; anymore.  Boo hoo hoo.  It seems<br/>
&gt; some people aren&#39;t happy unless they have something to complain about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like people complaining about other people&#39;s concerns.  Yes, I see your<br/>
point about people not being happy unless they are complaining.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(then from Kenross Cantoforjado)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hey!  I was complaining about them taking away surfing well before they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>actually did &gt;it!  They kept saying<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;they were going to &quot;fix&quot; it, and I&#39;ve been feedbacking it for a month<br/>
 </span></blockquote>saying I didn&#39;t &gt;want it to happen.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So I&#39;m allowed!  For those who care, don&#39;t get your hopes up that they&#39;ll<br/>
 </span></blockquote>take it out.  &gt;For them to go<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;through all the effort to fix it in the first place suggests that they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>really think &gt;that this graphic is a lot better.  No accounting for taste,<br/>
is there?<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I remember that, and petitioned and /feedbacked the next time I got in<br/>
the game back then.  I very much appreciated the heads up, and the chance<br/>
to let my server GM&#39;s know how I felt on the issue.  Thanks! :)  Alas, no,<br/>
I don&#39;t have my hopes up that it will be &quot;fixed&quot;.. its obvious that Verant<br/>
does not care what the player likes.  EQ is a visual game, and a HUGE part<br/>
of it is how it looks.  Simple and plain, the changes look ridiculous.   I<br/>
would rather there be no animation than to have it the way it is now. /sigh...<br/>
