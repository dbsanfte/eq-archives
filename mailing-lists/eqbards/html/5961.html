&gt; &gt; No that happened to me on the test server and a couple of my friends on<br/>
&gt; &gt; other servers....it seems that if you try to zone with less than a<br/>
bubble<br/>
&gt; &gt; and die during the zone the AI doesn&#39;t know what to do with you so it<br/>
puts<br/>
&gt; &gt; you back at the last saved point or maybe its the safe spot for the<br/>
zone....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Folks, there are three different things going on here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  If you zone with baddies whacking on you, you cannot die<br/>
&gt; while zoning - you will come through with 1 hp.  It used to be<br/>
&gt; that you could die like this while zoning, which led to a lot<br/>
&gt; of confusion (and sometimes corpses out of reach beyond the<br/>
&gt; zone line), but they fixed it by making sure you come through<br/>
&gt; with at least 1 hp.  (This still happens though if you slide<br/>
&gt; through a zone while unconcious - apparently the 1 hp check is<br/>
&gt; bypassed if you are already below 1 hp.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  If you crash or lag at the right moment while zoning, the<br/>
&gt; server loses track of you and has to restore you from the<br/>
&gt; latest backup.  This seems to be more common if monsters are<br/>
&gt; whacking on you, but then I&#39;ve only seen it happen twice. Your<br/>
&gt; hp and mana may be restored to full as some sort of safety<br/>
&gt; mechanism, I haven&#39;t seen it enough to say for sure - neither<br/>
&gt; of the persons I saw it happen to could recall if they were<br/>
&gt; already at full hp when they were last saved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  Sometimes you will zone, and will end up back in the zone<br/>
&gt; you just left (this is not bouncing off someone in the new<br/>
&gt; zone - you only zone once, but end up where you started).<br/>
&gt; Your hp are *not* restored in this case, and your new<br/>
&gt; position is right at the zone, so I think this is just a case<br/>
&gt; of failed zoning due to problems on the server.  I had the<br/>
&gt; displeasure of dying to a train due to this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
