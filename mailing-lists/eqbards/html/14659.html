<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947305383">OK that explains why Largos was sticking better.  I saw the &quot;mob glances<br/>
around nervously&quot; message every time we fought something.  Didn&#39;t know that<br/>
was the message for Tashan though.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; &gt; What message gets displayed when an enchanter successfully casts tashan?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;mob glances around nervously.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve grouped with this enchanter on numerous occasions and I know that<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; normal pulls (1 or 2) mobs, he primarily keeps stunning them over and<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; &gt; again.  The message on screen that popped up numerous times during the<br/>
&gt; fight<br/>
&gt; &gt; was the &quot;scintillating colors&quot; message.  I&#39;ve always assumed this was<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; message enchanters get when they successfully stun.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Believe me, he was using tashan(i)(a).  If you run across an<br/>
&gt; enchanter who doesn&#39;t, boot him from your group.  :)  It has a<br/>
&gt; ridiculously short cast time, is almost never resisted, and<br/>
&gt; costs next to no mana.  In return, it debuffs MR by about<br/>
&gt; 20-45 points.<br/>
