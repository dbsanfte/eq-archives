I am not making a judgement on Abashi. I&#39;m not saying what is or what isn&#39;t<br/>
his job to know. All I was saying was that based on what he wrote in his<br/>
post, I don&#39;t think he was aware of what we were talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Whether he should have known or could have known or used to know has nothing<br/>
to do with what I said.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s a real problem then.  On the recently-wiped Gameplay board,<br/>
there are 10 <br/>
separate posts with the words &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;snare&quot; in the titles which discuss<br/>
the nerf to <br/>
the level 23 song, and 13 separate posts with the words &quot;lullaby&quot; or &quot;mez&quot;<br/>
in the title <br/>
which discuss the problem with Lullaby and Pixie Strike.  This doesn&#39;t<br/>
mention all the <br/>
other threads that discuss these topics that do not have the words in the<br/>
title.<br/>
<br/>
HOW COULD HE NOT KNOW?  Isn&#39;t it his JOB to know?  Isn&#39;t he supposed to read<br/>
at LEAST the <br/>
first post in a new thread?  Or does he just notice the word &quot;bard&quot; in the<br/>
title and blow <br/>
it off?  I work a full-time job, and I STILL know what most of the major<br/>
issues are that <br/>
are bothering other players of ALL types, not just bards.  Two months ago he<br/>
tells us that <br/>
Chains should not have been nerfed, and now he has no idea what we&#39;re<br/>
talking about?  He <br/>
thinks that maybe someone somewhere mentioned in passing that Lullaby is<br/>
just fine, so that <br/>
makes it OK?  I&#39;m apoplectic.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like talking to a freaking rock.<br/>
