<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001664948">Have done this on fairly small samples and it proves true what logically<br/>
(according to basic statistics) should be true.  Over the longer haul the<br/>
variation from average gets smaller for larger weapons and thus they<br/>
outdamage the faster weapons if they have a better ratio.  Unfortunately the<br/>
time needed to flatten tham out to average is longer than a few battles so<br/>
those battles which are below average willbe significantly below average and<br/>
you will die.  The higher ratio always wins out in the long run, but if you<br/>
die due to fluctuation before that &#39;long run&#39; can occurr does it really<br/>
matter?  <br/>
<br/>
I proved this by turning log on and off before and after fights and<br/>
recording them seperately.  This allows one to see how greatly a wepon with<br/>
a delay of 50 (bloodforge hammer) differs from that of delay 28 (Shining<br/>
Star of Light).  The bloodforge had a total over 5 fights that was higher<br/>
damage/time but it had 2 that were below the Shining Star despite having a<br/>
far better ratio.  The Shining Star stayed very much the same over all 5<br/>
fights.  Bloodforge 27/50 Shining Star 13/28.  Obviously I did this test<br/>
with my cleric since both are weapons a bard cannot use.<br/>

	One thing you may want to do, that I haven&#39;t done yet.  Get one of<br/>
the log parsing programs.  They show damage/time, as well as %hit, and<br/>
several other stats..  Try several different combinations of weapons, and<br/>
find which seems to be the best total damage/time<br/>
