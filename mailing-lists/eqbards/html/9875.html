<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438676144">I have a staff of writhing and even though I didn&#39;t pay for it (gift from<br/>
guild), I usually see it go for around 500pp+ or trade. Although the staff<br/>
is a good weapon, the -9 Cha is not good for Bards (as we use cha for<br/>
songs).<br/>
Unfortunately this is as close to a ykesha as I can get for 20 ish levels.<br/>

I have a PGT now, along with a dirk.  I&#39;m level 25, and I&#39;ve had it for ...<br/>
umm... 6? levels.. (can&#39;t remember exactly when I got it).  While its true<br/>
at higher levels the PGT becomes more of a hindrance than a help, at this<br/>
point for me, its still a help.  I&#39;ll be upgrading it at some point, but<br/>
its<br/>
not a priority for me right now.  Lambent armor is :)<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me what the worth of a Staff of Writhing on Povar is? I&#39;d<br/>
love to upgrade to that, if I get the chance.<br/>
