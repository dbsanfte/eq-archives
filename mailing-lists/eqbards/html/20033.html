<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295354328">Umm... this list and the Concert Hall have been around since the game was<br/>
released.  Any bard, no matter if high level or low level, who was so inclined<br/>
could easily have learned as much as they wanted to about the bard class.  But<br/>
sadly since most of them don&#39;t subscribe to this list that means those of us who<br/>
do have to continually educate our groups on what we can do for the group.  <br/>
<br/>
And I agree that there are situations where it is appropriate to play as a<br/>
battle bard.  But there are situations where it isn&#39;t.  Those that only know how<br/>
to play as battle bards will find it hard to adapt to those specific situations<br/>
so therefore can give other classes a bad impression of the bard class.  Those<br/>
that do know how to adapt will amaze their group, establish a reputation as a<br/>
good bard, and usually have no problems finding a group to join.<br/>

  But I really can&#39;t blame some of the higher level bards for not toally<br/>
knowing what something may do.  Some of these people have been playing bards<br/>
for AGES!  And us new little bards can look at all these great web sites<br/>
that tell us exactly what the song does....<br/>
