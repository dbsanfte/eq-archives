<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887449131">I would have to agree with the previous poster that in Oasis, we were seeing<br/>
about 1 helm every 5 gobs or so... Maybe the drop rate is MUCH lower in<br/>
Rathe?<br/>

&gt; &gt; DW Gobs - are hard to pull singles - unless you are level 50.  So get<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; &gt; help or maybe try this idea that was posted a while back (by Harmonic):<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Go to Lake Rathe (why I cant say except maybe roaming singles can be<br/>
found<br/>
&gt; &gt; there?) Get levitate and SoW.  Track (ok have ranger friend track) DW<br/>
&gt; &gt; gobbies. Get right on top of them and agro them with Chords or other AE<br/>
&gt; &gt; song. Run for the zone.  Have a ranger cast snare on one and zone out<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; &gt; right back in.  Find the snared one and kill him. Pray that he has a<br/>
helm<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that you wont have to repeat this 20 times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I must say I was working the DW goblins last night with a shaman<br/>
&gt;   friend of mine.  I killed about 15 of them, no helm, using the<br/>
&gt;   tactics above, we could handle 4 DW goblins at once, very hurt<br/>
&gt;   after battle.  DW goblins are wizards, clerics, or warriors.<br/>
&gt;   I got experience from 2 of the 15 in group, if that indicates<br/>
&gt;   anything about their raw power.  I couldn&#39;t break the spawn,<br/>
&gt;   they spawn way too quickly, and were always available when I went<br/>
&gt;   out to collect them.  I usually got one at a time, but that got<br/>
&gt;   boring so I farmed them in groups.  Still no helm, sigh.  Sorry<br/>
&gt;   Kenross.<br/>
