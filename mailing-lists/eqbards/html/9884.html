fearing, ranger fills with arrows, runs up for melee on successful fear.<br/>
A third group member will shorten the time it takes to drop him.  If you<br/>
approach Froon and Choon&#39;s spot slowly from the side, you can come away<br/>
with just one of them (they apparently don&#39;t warn each other, but have<br/>
large aggro radii).  Bring him back down to the nearby house, run him in<br/>
circles till snare sticks, then break out the horn.<br/>
