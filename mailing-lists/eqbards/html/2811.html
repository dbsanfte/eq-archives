<b>Subject:</b> High Hold Pass Gambling on E&#39;ci <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047251729">Just wanted to mention that on E&#39;ci there&#39;s the Gambling in High Hold Pass<br/>
tonight, 8 PM eastern.  Tiger&#39;s Roar Inn.  Stop by and blow some platinum,<br/>
eh?<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea I had one evening when especially bored.  Was admiring the<br/>
Tiger&#39;s Roar Inn and Tavern, thought there shouldn&#39;t be all these NPC&#39;s<br/>
mentioning gambling yet no gambling, so I just went ahead and proclaimed<br/>
myself Norrath&#39;s first &quot;true&quot; Casino Dealer, hehe.  Way it&#39;ll work: house<br/>
takes no cut.  House will leave the pot intact on a winning hand of 21 or 00<br/>
in roulette.  Players keep playing until someone wins the pot, just trust<br/>
the dealer won&#39;t cheat.  Ah, and I won&#39;t cheat, even if I worship<br/>
Bristlebane.  Only can hope high rollers tip well.<br/>
<br/>
Way this is on-topic?  I had ideas for different competitions folks could<br/>
bet on.  One of my ideas was a &quot;Battle of the Bands.&quot;  A battle to the<br/>
death.  Would be something to see, 12 bards going at it, with the<br/>
stipulation being they cannot engage in melee!  That&#39;s right, two bands<br/>
wielding only instruments....  attempting to slaughter each other.  Also<br/>
note faction adjustments for PvP have been removed since the last patch, so<br/>
now&#39;s the best time to try this before penalties return.<br/>
<br/>
Any bard wants to come by and kill other bards, would be appreciated.  Ah<br/>
yes, and hopefully there&#39;ll be a nice prize for the winning band.<br/>
