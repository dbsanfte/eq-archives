<div id="ygrps-yiv-209722778">Well now there&#39;s a reason for us to use the /stopsong command. BTW, from <br/>
the example 100 = 10 secs, so time increment would be close to 50. You&#39;re <br/>
also limited to 5 lines. Lastly, the pause command can be stacked, but must <br/>
be listed first on the same line. Something like this:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 50 /cast 1<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/pause 50 /cast 2<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/pause 50 /cast 3<br/>
<br/>
May need to change the time increment to allow for general lag, but that&#39;s <br/>
what testing is for. Also, there&#39;s no space for an additional &quot;/stopsong&quot; <br/>
to stop song # 3, so I guess this isn&#39;t a whole fix-all.<br/>
<br/>
More interestingly, my enchanter buddy is lamenting this new addition and <br/>
feels it&#39;ll take any skill out of EQ. Enchanters can now set up macros to <br/>
continually re-mesmerize things since they know exactly how long something <br/>
will wear off. He mentioned that Verant was against macros from the <br/>
beginning and is wondering what has changed to make them implement this. <br/>
He&#39;s pretty much against this enhancement. I just gave him the, &quot;Back in my <br/>
day we actually had to push the buttons &quot; tease and told him he doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to use it if he doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to using this to weave Hymn and Clarity during down times. <br/>
I&#39;ll actually be able to take somewhat of a break, just repressing the hot key.<br/>

&gt;Macro has no intelligence, so I would assume it would keep following it&#39;s<br/>

&gt;  &gt;Yikes!  I&#39;ll bet that will be nerfed within minutes.  Of course there will<br/>
&gt;  &gt;still be no way to deal with missed notes... or will there, hmmm.<br/>

&gt;Don&#39;t know why it would be nerfed. This enhancement allows a caster to<br/>
&gt;perform a number of funtions with one key, same as weaving.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, yes, missed notes would mess the timing up. I wonder if you could<br/>
&gt;then just press the &quot;social&quot; key again to interrupt the current macro or<br/>
&gt;whether you&#39;d be stuck waiting for your it to end? Something to definitely<br/>
&gt;test.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Sounds like you might be able to set up some weaving via the social keys<br/>
&gt; &gt;with this new &quot;pause&quot; command. It&#39;ll be fun to test!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;--------------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;*Pauses in Socials*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause<br/>
&gt; &gt;takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number<br/>
&gt; &gt;of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;For example, a social consisting of:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;/sit off<br/>
&gt; &gt;/cast 1<br/>
&gt; &gt;/pause 100<br/>
&gt; &gt;/sit on<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds<br/>
&gt; &gt;after you&#39;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as<br/>
&gt; &gt;another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the<br/>
&gt; &gt;pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;same line.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;For example:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;/sit off<br/>
&gt; &gt;/pause 100,/cast 1<br/>
&gt; &gt;/sit on<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to<br/>
&gt; &gt;note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from<br/>
&gt; &gt;another, and MUST be specified first on the line.<br/>
