&gt; The hit you make the most often, the mode, (thank you Kaearia) is<br/>
&gt; considered tha &#39;Magic Number&#39; (MN).  This number over a large enough<br/>
&gt; sample size shows up to be 20% (Approx) higher than any other damage<br/>
&gt; amt.  The way to figure out this MN is a set formula which we&#39;re all<br/>
&gt; familiar with (possibly)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;       MN = (wep dmg * 2) + ((lvl - 25)/3)<br/>

&gt; Ok.. now you know what the dmg you can cause in one swing on average is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Er, that&#39;s the problem with that whole thread.  The mode does<br/>
not equal the average.  So it&#39;s really pretty useless for<br/>
comparing which weapons you want to use.<br/>
<br/>
If you can prove that the damage distribution for all<br/>
weapon/atk combinations is identical, then you can use the<br/>
mode in lieu of average for direct comparisons (i.e. given two<br/>
weapons, which is better, don&#39;t care how much better - this<br/>
may actually be the case given some L50 tests I&#39;ve seen).  <br/>
But to properly compare two different weapons, you still need<br/>
to pull out the average damage by parsing your logfiles.<br/>
