***Supplemental Patch Message***<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one minor issue with Paineel that we neglected to mention in the<br/>
patch message. At the entrance to the city, there is an elevator that<br/>
must be activated with a key. The &quot;keyhole&quot; in this instance is a rock<br/>
that is on the ground near the lift. A minor bug exists that does not<br/>
allow people to click on the rock to activate the elevator. In order to<br/>
activate the elevator, players will need to hold the key on their<br/>
pointer, hover it over the rock, and press the &quot;U&quot; key. This will be<br/>
fixed in a future patch.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the patch message made reference to a teleporter being<br/>
placed within the Plane of Hate.  The information provided concerning<br/>
this teleporter was incorrect. The information should read as follows:<br/>
<br/>
- A bug exists within the Plane of Hate that sometimes causes people to<br/>
be transported to an inactive portion of the zone, from which there is<br/>
no exit.  A teleporter has been placed within this area to transport<br/>
people who are trapped back to the entrance of Hate.<br/>

***Announcements***<br/>
<br/>
The City of Paineel, home to the infamous Heretics of Erudin, is now<br/>
available via the Optional Patch.  In addition, Erudites may now also be<br/>
Shadowknights in addition to the other classes available to them.  All<br/>
Erudite Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Clerics who worship the God of<br/>
Fear, Cazic-Thule, now start in the City of Paineel.  As such, if you<br/>
wish to create a character of this type from this point forward, you<br/>
*must* download the Paineel zone-files via the Optional Patch.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that if you downloaded the Paineel zone files recently, you<br/>
must run the Optional Patch again to insure you have the correct version<br/>
of the files.<br/>
<br/>
In related news, all of the entrances to the Qeynos Catacombs have been<br/>
fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

***Patch Message***<br/>
<br/>
The following changes have been implemented on the live servers:<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Changes*<br/>
<br/>
- The recast delay for many of the Shaman buff-spells have been reduced.<br/>
<br/>
- &quot;Reoccurring Amnesia&quot; has had its casting time reduced.<br/>
- &quot;Yaulp&quot; and &quot;Augmentation&quot; should now stack.<br/>
- &quot;Solidarity of Vision&quot; has had its duration increased.<br/>
- The Druid spell, &quot;Skin Like Nature&quot;, has been returned to its former<br/>
status due to popular opinion. As such, the damage-shield component has<br/>
been removed and the regeneration component has been re-applied.<br/>
- &quot;Sense Magic&quot; has been replaced in all cases by the &quot;True North&quot;<br/>
spell.  If you have already inscribed the &quot;Sense Magic&quot; spell, the spell<br/>
icon will now automatically reflect &quot;True North&quot;.<br/>
- A bug that existed with several damage-shield spells, causing their<br/>
damage to be subtracted rather than added when stacked, has been<br/>
corrected.  The spells will now stack properly.<br/>
- The &quot;Feign Death&quot; spell, when cast by a Necromancer, will now have a<br/>
fixed duration.  The Necromancer will receive several warnings prior to<br/>
the spell wearing off. This change was necessary because some<br/>
Necromancers found a way to gain experience through their pet while<br/>
being AFK for an extended duration, such as being in bed for the night.<br/>
Note: This does not affect Shadowknights or Monks.<br/>
- New Necromancer spells are now in game.  Check your spell vendors.<br/>
- Alchemy has been revamped.  Check with your local Shaman.<br/>
- DOT (Damage Over Time) spells will no longer hinder camping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*General Changes/Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- The dungeon of Paw has again received a minor update to slightly<br/>
reduce the difficulty of the zone.<br/>
<br/>
- All known issues with the SBLive sound card have been corrected.<br/>
<br/>
- From this point forward, deleting a character will cause all corpses<br/>
belonging to that character to likewise be deleted.  This change was<br/>
made primarily to stop a no-drop transfer bug.  It also has the added<br/>
effect of cleaning up corpses for characters that people no longer<br/>
intend to play.<br/>
<br/>
- Crippling Blows will now display the correct damage in the &quot;You have<br/>
scored a Crippling Blow (###)&quot; line.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Corpse Looting Exploit*<br/>
<br/>
Recently, an exploit was discovered that allowed certain unsavory<br/>
individuals to loot the corpses of other players without their consent.<br/>
The precise symptom of this is that the owner would find their corpse<br/>
stripped of everything except for no-drop items, and items in a bag with<br/>
no-drop items.  This exploit was fixed in this patch.<br/>
<br/>
If you were affected by this exploit recently, you are entitled to a<br/>
reimbursement of your lost items assuming that we still have a record of<br/>
what you had.  Please contact a GM in-game to arrange for an<br/>
investigation.<br/>
<br/>
During the course of the investigation, people who have exploited this<br/>
bug will be subject to disciplinary action by our GM staff up to and<br/>
including item wipes, suspension, and/or banishment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Rogue Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
Rogues received several enhancements as part of this patch:<br/>
<br/>
- The chance to score a critical hit with a throwing weapon has been<br/>
increased significantly.<br/>
<br/>
- When throwing a weapon from behind the NPC in question, a rogue now<br/>
has a chance to score a &quot;Deadly Strike&quot;, for enhanced damage above and<br/>
beyond that of a critical hit.<br/>
<br/>
- A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the &quot;Hide&quot; skill.  It<br/>
is called &quot;Evade&quot;.  This skill has the effect of lowering the amount<br/>
that the targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential of making<br/>
the engaged NPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) within the<br/>
rogue&#39;s group.  It is essentially a &quot;reverse taunt&quot;.  This ability helps<br/>
mitigate the negative effects of the rogue&#39;s exceedingly high<br/>
damage-output potential. It also will in-turn help the rogue do even<br/>
more damage as the NPC is much more likely to expose its back.  It is<br/>
engaged by targeting the NPC you wish to &quot;Evade&quot; and pressing the &quot;Hide&quot;<br/>
button.  As a note, you must not be in combat mode in order to use this<br/>
ability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Mistwalker*<br/>
<br/>
The Mistwalker will once again cast its spell as often as it used to<br/>
prior to the last patch.  However, the resulting pet will now<br/>
automatically &quot;dissipate&quot; after one combat round.  The change that<br/>
reduced the &quot;proc&quot; percentage on the weapon was made due to an<br/>
unintended interaction between the pet and the target when several users<br/>
of this weapon were attacking the same target.  Since the new pet now<br/>
automatically dissipates after one round, the reduced &quot;proc&quot; percentage<br/>
was no longer necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Class-Specific Armor Quests*<br/>
<br/>
Class-Specific armor quests, especially those belonging to Clerics,<br/>
Paladins, and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms of how long it<br/>
will take the average person to acquire the armor.  These classes, and<br/>
others that found particular pieces of their armor exceedingly difficult<br/>
to obtain should find it much easier now.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, a bug that hindered completion of the Bracer of Ro quest<br/>
for some races has been corrected.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Tallon Zek*<br/>
<br/>
Loot rules for PvP deaths on the PvP-Teams server, Tallon Zek, have been<br/>
changed from &quot;Coin + 1 item&quot; to &quot;Coin Only&quot;.  This change was made to<br/>
study the impact of loot-rules upon server population in reference to<br/>
the loot/efficiency disparity between caster and melee characters.  This<br/>
change is a test, and may or may not be retained or rolled out across<br/>
the other PvP servers, pending the results of the server population<br/>
study over the next few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Plane Changes*<br/>
<br/>
Several changes have been implemented in the Planes as part of this<br/>
patch:<br/>
<br/>
- Characters will now lose all enchantments upon entering the Plane of<br/>
Sky<br/>
<br/>
- Due to the fact that the levitate-series no longer works within the<br/>
Plane of Sky, a teleporter has been placed to allow entrance into the<br/>
quest room.<br/>
<br/>
- A teleporter has been placed within the Plane of Hate in order to give<br/>
non-casters a way out of the zone besides death, potion, or group<br/>
teleport.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Loot Messages*<br/>
<br/>
Messages indicating what has been looted from a corpse will now be<br/>
broadcast to everyone within the looters group.  This change was made<br/>
due to public request and to encourage trust within the group.  We may,<br/>
in the future, employ filters to allow people to choose whether or not<br/>
they wish to receive loot messages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Fiery Avenger*<br/>
<br/>
The greatly anticipated defining blade of the Paladin, the &quot;Fiery<br/>
Avenger&quot;, is again available within game via a quest.  The *first*<br/>
devout Paladin to wield this blade and be validated by a GM in-game will<br/>
be publicly congratulated within a patch message and on the Official<br/>
EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com.<br/>
