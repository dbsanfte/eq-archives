&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I forgot to post that.  The color is a very<br/>
&gt; &gt; attractive deep blue.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ohh, I&#39;m in heaven.  I recently joined a small guild, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; last night the<br/>
&gt; &gt; leader informed me they had acquired the components necessary for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; breastplate.  I&#39;ve been dying to find a new set of armor that<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; &gt; me look like C-3PO with a hatchet, and it couldn&#39;t get much<br/>
&gt; &gt; better than<br/>
&gt; &gt; blue (&#39;cept maybe green, but the rangers already cornered<br/>
&gt; &gt; that market, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have only seen stats for Lambent Bracer and Greaves, and I must say they <br/>
sound pretty nice for mid-levels.  Some of the Imbrued Plate PoF armor <br/>
pieces do have questionable stat raises so these might be a nice alternative <br/>
(come on now, +5 WIS on Imbrued gauntlets??? I&#39;m keeping them though, just <br/>
in case Verant decides to change things) =)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to ask an opinion: I have a Hero bracer (AC9, +10 STR, +something <br/>
disease or poison), and a Serpentine Bracer (AC1, +3 DEX, +9 AGI). Should I <br/>
stick with the Serpentine or go with a Lambent (AC9, +1 CHA, +4 STR)?<br/>
<br/>
Also debating on going with Lambent Greaves (AC13, +1 CHA, +5 AGI) or <br/>
sticking with Mithril (AC10, +7 STR, +5 vs Magic). Nice AC on the Lambent, <br/>
but I like the stat and MR buff on mithril.<br/>
<br/>
Currently stats are: STR 131, DEX 129 (or close to it), AGI 144, CHA 104.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have stats on the other Lambent pieces?<br/>
