&gt; &quot;Theft&quot; under the penal code is specific to tangible and intangible personal<br/>
&gt; property.  Intangible personal property is specifically defined as something<br/>
&gt; like a certificate of deposit or stock shares.  Crimes against intellectual<br/>
&gt; property are like violation of copyright or theft of trade secrets.  Except<br/>
&gt; in the tax code, in which  &quot;intangible personal property&quot; means  &quot;a claim,<br/>
&gt; interest (other than an interest in tangible property), right, or other<br/>
&gt; thing that has value but cannot be seen, felt, weighed, measured, or<br/>
&gt; otherwi1se perceived by the senses, although its  existence may be evidenced<br/>
&gt; by a document.&quot;  It is really, really difficult to get damages for<br/>

characters and items in my account be intangible personal<br/>
property?  Or put another way, if I sell the account, either<br/>
the IRS can tax it and it&#39;s property, or it&#39;s not property and<br/>
they can&#39;t tax it?<br/>
