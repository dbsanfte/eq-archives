<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848626720">I had the same trouble , i made 15 and went to the Bard&#39;s Guild looking for <br/>
the lvl 15 song , but didn&#39;t find it. Then I asked a higher level bard and he <br/>
told me to go to Freeport, I wen&#39;t to Freeport and it wasn&#39;t there, so i hung <br/>
out for a couple of days.(I didn&#39;t want to just turn right back around) Then <br/>
when I went back to the Bards Guild , and was just looking at songs and  i <br/>
saw it. But I swear it wasn&#39;t there before! Weird , anyway I think it was on <br/>
the girl to your left as you go through the second door. If not , i&#39;m losing <br/>
it again.<br/>
