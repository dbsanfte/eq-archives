<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078143893">I&#39;m a flat broke minstrel of the 8th verse bound to Qeynos and I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if it&#39;s worth my while to try to earn enough PP and make trek back to<br/>
Kelethin to purchase Kelin&#39;s Lament.  I can&#39;t recall any of you more<br/>
experienced folks posting anything about how Lament has saved your life more<br/>
times than you can remember or wow&#39;d your friends.  Should I just start<br/>
saving up for Elemental Rhythms?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what&#39;s the next step up from rusty/splintered weapons and is there<br/>
anyplace a bard my age can go to where she may loot them?<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
