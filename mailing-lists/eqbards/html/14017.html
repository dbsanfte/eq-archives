<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365151522"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How about this:  Has anyone EVER successfully use the level 35 song?  Is<br/>
&gt; there a point to it?  It seems to drain mana so slowly that it is useless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I took out a shaman the other day with it.<br/>
<br/>
  Stun, drain, stun, drain, stun, drain.<br/>
 <br/>
  After about 1-2 minutes she had no mana.  Needless to say,<br/>
  caster with no mana = dead caster.<br/>
