<br/>
&gt; In my mind I can justify gadgetry that is intended as part of the<br/>
&gt; game or is separate from the game but can in a reasonable way be<br/>
&gt; considered part of the game, such as this mailing list or externally<br/>
&gt; obtained maps.  Mailing lists and maps are straightforward ways for<br/>
&gt; people to exchange information and can be kept somewhat in game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not missing your point at all.  I understand that you choose to think<br/>
of /loc as unjustifiable.  However, given the far-fetched rationalization<br/>
that you gave for externally obtained information, such as this list,<br/>
my point was that you could just as easily rationalize /loc, *if you<br/>
wanted to*.  You don&#39;t want to, and that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, my biggest gripe with /loc is that t considerably reduces the<br/>
value of sense heading.  I guess it also reduces the value of bards, since<br/>
many people hit /loc just before dying, and therefore don&#39;t need our help<br/>
finding their corpses.  In game, when someone asks me directions to a place,<br/>
I will give them compass headings or directions along the paths, even when<br/>
I know they&#39;re after coordinates.  I&#39;m just mean, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ve been dumped into the Ocean of Tears enough times that I&#39;ve<br/>
recorded the coordinates of the boat stops, just to maintain my own sanity.<br/>
I prefer not to think of the boat crashes as natural disasters, but as<br/>
Verant&#39;s incompetence, and I absolutely refuse to swim around for hours<br/>
trying to figure out where I am.  Call me a bad roleplayer if you will,<br/>
but I find swimming around lost to be monotonous, boring, and a total<br/>
waste of time.  (Well, okay, the first time I got dumped in the ocean,<br/>
I did manage to raise my swimming skill by 65 points or so, but every time<br/>
since then, it&#39;s been a waste.)<br/>
<br/>
As you pointed out earlier, it&#39;s basically a debugging feature.  As long as<br/>
we&#39;re helping Verant debug the game, I see no problem with using it in<br/>
that context.  Heh.  Maybe they should only enable it when you file a /bug<br/>
report, and disable it the next time you zone.<br/>
