<div id="ygrps-yiv-832929386">i played with the level 40 song a little.  it appears to be a single target<br/>
only song, and does not work on party members.  you can use it on yourself,<br/>
just like bellow and chant songs, and i was able to remove SoW.  it is<br/>
basically a debuff/dispel magic song.  so very nice to take down those<br/>
critters that buff themselves up before you attack them.<br/>

&gt; Yep your 100% correct.  I&#39;m the one who mistakely thought you <br/>
&gt; could sing the<br/>
&gt; song without a lute.  My bad.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ryan answered one of my questions (the song is not used to <br/>
&gt; remove positive<br/>
&gt; buffs from mobs).  I haven&#39;t seen a reply to the second <br/>
&gt; question I asked so<br/>
&gt; once more:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone tried playing the 22d level song while under the <br/>
&gt; influence of a<br/>
&gt; negative spell, with a lute equipped, and themselves <br/>
&gt; targetted (by hitting<br/>
&gt; the F1 key or left-clicking on their name).  The times I have <br/>
&gt; tried to use<br/>
&gt; this song in the past I have not had myself targetted.  I <br/>
&gt; just assumed it<br/>
&gt; worked like our other songs and did not require targetting <br/>
&gt; yourself.  I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t been hit with a negative spell since I posted the question so<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t had the chance to test it out for myself.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;One other possibility.  Are we 100% certain that the song <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;is supposed to remove negative buffs from us?  What if the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;song removes positive buffs from a mob?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 110% sure.  This song is party only.  Kinda tough to apply it<br/>
&gt; &gt; to NPCs, when it&#39;s _only_ party only.  The static pulse is<br/>
&gt; &gt; meant to clear out negative effects (which it doesnt).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This song is lute _only_, you cannot sing it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We need to be more careful when posting things like this,<br/>
&gt; &gt; clearly you can tell if you get the message:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You must be using a String Instrument when playing this song.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In order to make more sense of things like this, everyone needs<br/>
&gt; &gt; to take note of everything that occured.  Saying this song can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be sung is just plain incorrect.  It starts more rumors, which<br/>
&gt; &gt; we must dispell... it&#39;s ashame this song does help that ;-)<br/>
