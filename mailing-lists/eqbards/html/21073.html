<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309053957">Heh the more I hear about &quot;how things work in EQ&quot; the more it sounds like a<br/>
dikumud with a spiffy front end client.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;weapons are just a number pointing to an object in a database&quot;<br/>
&quot;Mobs are just numbers in a database&quot;<br/>
&quot;loot tables are just numbers in a database&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If everquest is this much like MUDS on the front end (no I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s<br/>
Diku code, just that the structure is a lot LIKE diku code) then I suspect<br/>
the spell system is a mire of bandaids and &#39;fixes&#39; that nobody really<br/>
understands.  Part of that seems to be that instead of giving each class a<br/>
different spell they give them similar spells that pull from the same data<br/>
tables as each other with nifty names tacked on.<br/>
<br/>
When you mish-mash shit like that changing 1 thing tends to cause minor<br/>
changes to 3 dozen others.  Which is why they&#39;re so leery of messing with<br/>
spells... imho.<br/>

&gt; Pardon a paranoid rant here - but I&#39;ve worked as a programmer since 1984.<br/>
&gt; Several times in my career - I inherited some code (I&#39;m proud to say - I<br/>
&gt; never originated any) - that was so complex and poorly written that<br/>
everyone<br/>
&gt; was really afraid to go in and mess around with it much.  The code was<br/>
&gt; usually too big and important to get management approval to spend a<br/>
&gt; significant amount of time just rewrite the sucker.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;d try to make changes around it as much as possible to get anything<br/>
&gt; done - but from time to time - you just had no choice to open up the hood<br/>
&gt; and muck around there.  After you did - often you&#39;d find you created a few<br/>
&gt; new problems despite your best efforts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes we&#39;d be able to convince the users to live with the new quirks<br/>
&gt; because the end result was still much better than what we started out<br/>
with -<br/>
&gt; and they had other stuff they wanted us to work on.  You&#39;d always hope for<br/>
&gt; that big project that would have the budget to sneak in the time to<br/>
re-write<br/>
&gt; it even if wasn&#39;t necessary to get that project done.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now we&#39;ve seen tons of cool new stuff come in with the client.  New colors<br/>
&gt; for example.  Shoot, the turnaround from when someone suggested the LFG<br/>
flag<br/>
&gt; to implementation seemed like two weeks.  I&#39;m guessing the &quot;chat shell&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;who&#39;s online&quot; etc is simple and nicely written.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sure seems to be lots of signs that the Spell System is one nasty goop of<br/>
&gt; poorly written, implemented, and tested bit of nastiness...<br/>

&gt; Just another example of Verant&#39;s attitude towards it&#39;s players.  They<br/>
screw<br/>
&gt; up a change, then decide since it isn&#39;t (in their opinion) too bad a<br/>
&gt; screw-up, they say it&#39;s now &quot;as intended&quot;.  At this point the only thing<br/>
&gt; keeping me playing is I have already paid for two more months yet, and the<br/>
&gt; other games I am interested in are not out yet.  If either of those things<br/>
&gt; were not true I would already be gone, solely due to Verant&#39;s attitude.<br/>

&gt; See the thread I posted on the Gameplay forum.  Read my post, and<br/>
&gt; Abashi&#39;s response.  Chains is NOT going to be fixed.  Well, maybe in two<br/>
&gt; years, after one of these &quot;we post for four months in order to get a<br/>
&gt; confused one sentence reply&quot; deals.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The last time Gordo shot off his mouth about this, it caused everyone to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; into a tizzy over nothing (ie: Ester basically said that he had no idea<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; was going on in regards to bards).  Therefore, I&#39;ll hold my heated<br/>
&gt; comments<br/>
&gt; &gt; until Ester herself says that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; here&#39;s a quote from Gordon:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes song), chains (level 23<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target mes song) be fixed?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we&#39;ve had some<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; &gt; things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority.<br/>
Regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; chains, it&#39;s working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds to me like they ain&#39;t gonna fix the Chains nerf...<br/>
