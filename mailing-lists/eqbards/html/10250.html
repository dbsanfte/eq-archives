<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516690704">Not really they just don&#39;t want somebody twinking with outstanding items. If<br/>
they wanted to stop twinking they could pure and simple and it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
very hard at that. The 46+ thinghas nothing to do with twinking and more to<br/>
do with Verant&#39;s time consuming process. Verant hascoded so manyuthings into<br/>
this gameto make it harder and longer to reach this level or to get this<br/>
item. Look at PoF and PoH they made all the drops rare in there which is<br/>
insane considering the spawn times. The 46+ thing is just togive the casual<br/>
player one more reason to reach 50.<br/>

&gt;If I recall, he didn&#39;t want to stop a low level character from<br/>
&gt;using the item if he somehow got incredibly lucky/fortunate<br/>
&gt;and got the item early on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; No where has Verant said they do no allow<br/>
&gt;&gt; twinking or anything along those lines.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I already covered this.  There are proc&#39;ing level limits in<br/>
&gt;the game, some items are no-drop, and the planes are<br/>
&gt;off-limits until you&#39;re level 46 because people were running<br/>
&gt;in with level 1 characters to loot the items.  They may not<br/>
&gt;have made a statement on it, but they&#39;ve coded it into the<br/>
&gt;game.<br/>
