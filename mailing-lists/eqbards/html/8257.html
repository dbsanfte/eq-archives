<b>Subject:</b> Travelling to Lower Guk to get a Guise <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-458458988">Yesterday Kitasi and I discussed going to Lower Guk and purchasing the<br/>
looting rights from a group that was camping the spawn that drops the Guise<br/>
of the Deceiver.  To recap, I have never killed a live froglok so they are<br/>
not KOS towards me.  In theory, that combined with the invis song will allow<br/>
me to go through Upper Guk safely.  However, once I get into Lower Guk the<br/>
undead frogloks will still attack me.  I discussed my plan with my<br/>
guildmembers last night and some of them told me that even with Invis to<br/>
Undead, my chances of safely going to Lower Guk to loot a Guise were not<br/>
good.  I was told told that the undead frogloks can sometimes see through<br/>
Invis to Undead.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone familiar with Lower Guk give me some advice with this plan?  I<br/>
do not intend to attack anything while in Lower Guk.  As soon as I enter the<br/>
zone, I will announce that I would like to purchase looting rights for the<br/>
Guise.  Until I get a positive response,  I will stay by the zone border.<br/>
Once I get a positive response, I will get invis to undead cast on me.  Once<br/>
I loot and pay for the Guise, I&#39;m leaving Lower Guk.  How far away is the<br/>
spawn point for the Guise from the zone border?  can someone give me the<br/>
directions I should take?  Invis to undead doesn&#39;t last very long so thats a<br/>
big factor.  Would I have time to run back to the zone border if attacked<br/>
while looting?  <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, how much should I offer for the looting rights? I was planning on<br/>
starting at 50PP and bartering from there.  I can spend up to 300PP but<br/>
obviously would like to get it as cheap as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
