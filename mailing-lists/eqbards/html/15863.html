&gt;Not as scary as you think.  I saw a gaming book on the desk of my then boss<br/>
&gt;at my current job at my interview and struck up a conversation on it.  When<br/>
&gt;he found out I was a role player he said he was sure I&#39;d fit in real well.<br/>
&gt;Since I got the interview thru another gaming friend whose wife worked here,<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s no doubt gaming played a huge role in my getting this gig.  We have<br/>
&gt;about 15 EQ players in Development alone out of about 45 employees in the<br/>
&gt;dept.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got my current job (and the one before that) because of the Live Action <br/>
Role Playing club I belong to.  Grei (who used to post on here a while <br/>
back) used to work at this place, then moved to Seattle.  When they started <br/>
hiring again, he recommended me, and they took me sans interview, based on <br/>
his recommendation alone.  Gotta love friends in high places ;)<br/>
