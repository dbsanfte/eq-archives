<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069087430">Well I found what is probably an &quot;unintended bard nerf&quot; that seems to be<br/>
specifically related to bards.  When you have a social (or a programmed key<br/>
on a keyboard) using the &quot;/doability #&quot; command.  You cannot sing Selo&#39;s and<br/>
get sense heading to work - instead you get the message &quot;You cannot execute<br/>
this command while casting a spell&quot;.  You can mash the sense heading hotkey<br/>
all you want succesfully, but if you use the doability command, then you get<br/>
the message.<br/>
<br/>
	What I was using this for is I had a social (and later a programmed<br/>
keyboard shortcut) in the following format:<br/>
<br/>
	/doability 1 (sense heading)<br/>
	/loc<br/>
<br/>
	As I was travelling, I could get both my heading as well as my exact<br/>
loc, and it made it real easy rather than having to mash a key for loc as<br/>
well -- post patch I have to stop selos, mash the button, then restart<br/>
selos.<br/>
<br/>
	Please test this and let me know if you guys have the same result.<br/>
I am going to /bug it tonight.<br/>
