At level 12, I was still doing OK hunting solo in the Steamfont Mountains. <br/>
 I liked the areas near the Windmills where you can find skeletons, drakes, <br/>
and harpies.  Just pick your targets carefully, and kick in the bardboots <br/>
song and run if your health goes below half or if a second creature engages <br/>
you while you&#39;re fighting the first one.  (Skeletons are especially a <br/>
problem this way, since they stun.  I died only once to a drake, but <br/>
several times to skeletons or skeleton-rat gangups, because they stunned me <br/>
and kept me from runnint.)  And of course if you see the Minotaur Hero, run <br/>
for the city or the zoneline.<br/>
<br/>
Starting from level 10, though, I found that soloing became increasingly <br/>
difficult.  At level 12 it got a big boost from the Bellow song, which <br/>
probably increased my combat effectiveness by fifty percent.  But as you  <br/>
 increase in level, you will find yourself much more effective in a party <br/>
than solo.  I found that teaming up with Monks works especially well.  Even <br/>
if I did nothing but stand there and play the lute twiddling between <br/>
healing song and battlesong (and hit with an occasional punch for a few <br/>
points), the monks and I together got far more experience than either could <br/>
manage on our own, since they fought better and didn&#39;t have to wait so long <br/>
between battles to recover.<br/>
