<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928219335">Apologies that this is not bard specific, but it is certainly strongly<br/>
related to the playing and discussing of EverQuest.   Although we are<br/>
generally bards here, with bardic concerns, it is my belief that, with a<br/>
strong bias toward bardic concerns in bardic terms, this forum is easily<br/>
one of the best, if not the best, for considerations of life in Norrath in<br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
Second only to being there, it is certainly my most important and effective<br/>
means of understanding how Thrush may most enjoy and profit from his life<br/>
in Norrath.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So how is that better than &quot;cast now or I&#39;ll trade you in?&quot;  In fact,<br/>
saying and thinking &quot;cast&quot; seems better to me.  I imagine shaking the fool<br/>
weapon between blows and thinking, &quot;It&#39;s supposed to cast that fool spell,<br/>
why won&#39;t it do it when I need it most.  I need a rune I can touch or a<br/>
word I can say to make it cast when *I* want it to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that the recalcitrant caster is not a weapon that casts in its own<br/>
sweet time and whim but rather a slow, confused, undependable member of<br/>
your party.  I doubt you&#39;d feel the need for a special word to encourage<br/>
the person.<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about it the more clear it is to me that trying to assign<br/>
a special word to the special case overall results in more obscurity than<br/>
light.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that I&#39;ve influenced anyone or even begun to establish a convention<br/>
that will stick, but the participants have helped me clarify my own thinking.<br/>
<br/>
In Norrath we have spell-casting beings and spell-casting weapons.  They<br/>
have varied degrees of reliability.  There may be some that will perform on<br/>
command and some that have their own sense of when to cast.  None need<br/>
special names.<br/>
<br/>
Given that, I bet I can explain to a newbie more clearly and quickly than<br/>
those who pick up programmer slang.<br/>
<br/>
Verant is classic.  To the detriment of useful information floww, the<br/>
programmers and people who run the systems are so steeped in the code and<br/>
the writers of documentation so weak or nonexistent that instead of<br/>
reasonable terminology and documentation we get programmer&#39;s notes and<br/>
system operator&#39;s terminology.  The underlying mechanisms impinge far too<br/>
much on the virtual reality and we are left grasping for understanding.<br/>
