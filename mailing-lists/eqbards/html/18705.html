memory fart :) but the normal place is uguk.  Not sure on Innothule <br/>
swamp.<br/>
<br/>
Also, another vague memory, I seem to remember that we need a magical <br/>
instrument equipped to hit magical creatures, not magical gloves.  I <br/>
could be wrong, but either way, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to test... <br/>
Unfortunately, the easiest magical string instrument to get is the <br/>
Lute of the Gypsy Princess or a Gypsy Lute.<br/>
