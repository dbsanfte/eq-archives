2) Why not bellows?  Extra damage is always good.  Often a resist is a<br/>
partial resist and you&#39;re doing some damage.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Chant of Battle problems<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Battle when I was hasted AND fighting.  The particles would appear, but<br/>
&gt; no one would get the icon or spell message.  When there was no fight<br/>
&gt; going on or I wasn&#39;t hasted the song would work fine.  Does anyone knwo<br/>
&gt; what was going on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Second question, when fighting Avocets I could not get binding to stick<br/>
&gt; at all, so I was trying to think of something to replace it with.  I<br/>
&gt; sung guardian rhythms (for the little ac buff).  Any suggestions for<br/>
&gt; songs to sing when the mob is too high level for my songs to affect<br/>
&gt; them?  I sing Hymm, Anthem/COB, but I need a third song for that<br/>
&gt; melody.  I am lvl 21, so no Psalm yet.<br/>
