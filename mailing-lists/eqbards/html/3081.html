<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292437972">Hmmm - have you ever looked at or seen a programmable throttle (used in<br/>
flight sims)?  Basically, you have 4 - 4 position &quot;hats&quot; and several buttons<br/>
- one for each finger and some fingers can do 4 key presses.  You can<br/>
program it to send many many different key strokes. Your hand wraps around<br/>
it so the position is &#39;natural&#39; and non-cramping.  They are designed so that<br/>
you can keep your hands off the keyboard and still &#39;press keys&#39; for your<br/>
game.<br/>

I have one and use this in my left hand.  I use one hat switch for movement<br/>
(also does a sense heading each time I press it to move or turn) - fwd,<br/>
back, turn left/right (also steer with mouse and plan to replace the turn<br/>
left/right with other functions)  Then have buttons for select nearest npc &<br/>
con (does both on one button); attack button; inventory screen button; f9<br/>
button; f10 button; hot keys 2, 4 & 6 on one button (for my warrior - does<br/>
kick bash and taunt in one press).<br/>
<br/>
Now that I know more how my bard should be working - I need to make some<br/>
adjustments so I can select various hot key pallets - then have buttons to<br/>
fire the various hot keys. Currently I am going to the keyboard to twist<br/>
songs and want to get this onto the throttle. <br/>
<br/>
I know how hard it is (and dangerous) to change once you have &quot;your system&quot;<br/>
the way you like it.  But if you are having trouble - carpal tunnel, etc,<br/>
you might consider this an option.<br/>

		Depends on whether you&#39;re talking head/eye work or hand/eye<br/>
twitch speed.<br/>
		I&#39;ve got no problem with concentration.  I do have a problem<br/>
with having to<br/>
		&quot;work out my wrists&quot; to learn a repeated pattern.<br/>
<br/>
		I am a carpal tunnel &quot;dodger&quot; with the ergonomic keyboard,<br/>
trackball mouse<br/>
		& pad, proper height chair .. etc ... and a diagnosable mild<br/>
coordination<br/>
		problem to boot.  As long as I don&#39;t play &quot;twitch&quot; games<br/>
(a.k.a. most 1st<br/>
		person shooters) I do fine.  I guess I&#39;ve just been a little<br/>
surprised by<br/>
		the Bard&#39;s need to twist constantly.</div>
