<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389616294">I don&#39;t know if they still drop there, but I got my Tattered Mantle from<br/>
Karnor&#39;s.  We were near the moat and pulling from somewhere (that was the<br/>
only time I&#39;ve hunted there).  It came off of either the hand, or one of the<br/>
ghosts.<br/>
Aye, Guller is 50+, but has a HUGE amount of hps (even for his level).  A<br/>
montho or so ago, some guildies were hunting bees when they were attacked by<br/>
one, then two, then THREE Gullers (have I mentioned that they can summon ye<br/>
back to their undead arses?) at the same time.  So if ye go a-huntin em,<br/>
take plenty of tank and healing power (unless ye have a nice necro friend<br/>
;o)~  )<br/>

&gt; crescendo is actually less haste than celerity by a little.  if your tanks<br/>
&gt; already have a haste item, use crescendo because their haste will max<br/>
&gt; anyway, and AC+STR is better than +AGI.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; for a mantle, if you like ac (and hit points are nice too) go to burning<br/>
&gt; woods and grab a tattered mantle.  gullerback is 50+ so you may not be<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; to kill him, but the people in the zone may let you loot one, or like you<br/>
&gt; said the guild can go kill him.  he used to be extremely common when<br/>
kunark<br/>
&gt; came out, dunno if they changed that, but he drops the mantle everytime.<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; buying they are cheap anyway, i think 200-ish.  it is ac12 20hp 10disease.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; for a cloak, you can&#39;t get up to an HBC or cloak of shadows with that<br/>
amount<br/>
&gt; yet, but a simple upgrade to your cloak is either white-wolf hide,<br/>
&gt; lizardscale, or even a cloak of the icebear, which is the highest ac and<br/>
&gt; cheapest of the 3.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; for belt, i don&#39;t think you will find higher ac, or at least can&#39;t think<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shada<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which means I will learn Max&#39;s Beserker Cresendo soon.  When<br/>
&gt; &gt; i am the haster<br/>
&gt; &gt; (IE no enchanter in group) I use Celerity now (which i LOVE,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the agi buff<br/>
&gt; &gt; gives a nice ac boost).  Do the experienced (I aask since its<br/>
&gt; &gt; high level<br/>
&gt; &gt; song) bards think Besrker is better?  (it gives str boost I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think the haste<br/>
&gt; &gt; effect is the same)<br/>
&gt; &gt; (This is excluding the obvious benefit of guildmates saying &quot;Olaf, do<br/>
&gt; &gt; Beserker.&quot;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Loot:  I need to upgrade my belt, back and shoulders.  What do you all<br/>
&gt; &gt; reccomend out there?  I like maxing my AC, Resists, CHA, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; STR (in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; order).  Right now I have a Kunzar Mantle (idiot me looted it<br/>
&gt; &gt; not knowing it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was no drop) (ac7, wis,dex,agi +3), a splinted bronze cloak<br/>
&gt; &gt; (UGH!) and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; straw spun belt (ac 10, but weighs 6...).  I have about 2k<br/>
&gt; &gt; right now and<br/>
&gt; &gt; dont really have trouble making money, though I would rather<br/>
&gt; &gt; go get a guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; run to get new items...  Any suggestions?<br/>
