&gt;     Hello again,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I&#39;m on the digest diet so my messages will always be multipart:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     1.  Thanks for all the feedback on the Lull song.  Tried it last night<br/>
&gt;     and it worked great.  I&#39;m lazy and hate doing the instrument/weapon<br/>
&gt;     swap (Unless I&#39;m running that is... a giant can be very motivating :))<br/>
&gt;     so after I killed one goblin I just renewed the song on the other two<br/>
&gt;     etc. repeat.  It&#39;s a fast spell so this is easy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     2.  I have heard that Wisps can drop great loot (lightstones) but you<br/>
&gt;     need a magic weapon.  What is the easiest/cheapest magic slashing 1h<br/>
&gt;     weapon that I can lay my hands on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     3.  Throwing weapons....  I have been thinking about trying these for<br/>
&gt;     some time.  (Poor mans fetch spell)  Can you ever recover the dagger<br/>
&gt;     after you use it or is it lost for good?  Seems expensive if you have<br/>
&gt;     to replace them every time. (1s+ each)  Do they attract the mob even<br/>
&gt;     if you miss?  (funny image of dagger flying past the nose of Mooto the<br/>
&gt;     Goblin followed by a yawn.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     4.  For Rolande:  I have been hunting in Misty Thicket near Revervale.<br/>
&gt;     You can earn about 2p an hour if you really hump.  You&#39;re to high to<br/>
&gt;     earn any experience there however.  Sounds like Paw might be a good<br/>
&gt;     choice.  BTW I only have 2 smaller pieces of banded that I got a great<br/>
&gt;     discount on (guy was tried and wanted to go to bed) and even then I<br/>
&gt;     had to borrow money from my partner.  (Just paid him back so I&#39;m flat<br/>
&gt;     broke now.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     5.  Where does the Amulet of Order quest start?  Don&#39;t need any<br/>
&gt;     spoilers just a starting spot unless it is ridiculously hard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Thanks again for the information.  This list is amazing!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
