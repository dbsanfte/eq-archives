Keep in mind GZ has said that mobs have a chance of breaking<br/>
out of certain spell effects (e.g. root) every round (I&#39;m<br/>
guessing that&#39;s 2.5 seconds).  Pixie Strike and Lullaby would<br/>
definitely fall under that category since they often do not<br/>
last their full duration.  Assuming that&#39;s the case, the 0 sec<br/>
Strike would be:<br/>
<br/>
Strike not resisted<br/>
Stunned<br/>
Roll to see if mob breaks out<br/>
Success - mob breaks out<br/>
Unstunned<br/>
<br/>
So even a 0 second stun on yourself should be accompanied by<br/>
the &quot;You are stunned&quot; message.<br/>
That might make sense, except that from the data it was apparent with<br/>
Lullaby that either the Mez (your right better term) lasted the full<br/>
duration, or it lasted for 0 duration.  It never lasted for 3 seconds as<br/>
would be the case if they were getting a chance to break out every round.<br/>
Since these mobs all had Speed Factors of 30 it was really easy to see.  I&#39;d<br/>
lullaby, mobs would nod.  Some nodded mobs would attack immediately,<br/>
sometimes in the middle of propagating the nods messages.  No mobs that did<br/>
not attack immediately would attack thruout that entire pulse.  The nodded<br/>
mobs that attacked the first time would attack again.  The nod messages<br/>
would propagate again followed by attacks from some of the nodded mobs<br/>
immediately thereafter.  Often different nodded mobs, no apparent pattern of<br/>
once it sticks you are good, mobs that didn&#39;t false nod for 10 pulses would<br/>
often false nod for 2 in a row thereafter.<br/>
