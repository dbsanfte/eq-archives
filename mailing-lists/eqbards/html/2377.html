use it.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I got knocked off the boat while I was just standing there.  This<br/>
was just before it zoned into BB.  If I was allowed to swim across the zone<br/>
I could have been to BB in 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
You might prefer to drown instead of using loc, but the roleplaying aspect<br/>
of the game was already lost when I was thrown off the boat by a BUG.  I<br/>
have to use these &quot;debugging&quot; commands with dealing with bugs.<br/>

&gt;In a similar vein to the discussion of bards wearing plate and other<br/>

&gt;rather drown than use /loc and numeric coordinates?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally I consider /loc a debugging command and a roleplaying<br/>
&gt;abomination.  I refuse to deal with it.  If we are to have such a pin-point<br/>
&gt;locating and finding capability, it should be a proper in-game mechanism,<br/>
&gt;not a computer programming artifact.<br/>
