<b>Subject:</b> Another question on 30th level song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-425460370">Thanks to everyone who answered my earlier question about the 30th level<br/>
song.  A followup question now.  <br/>
<br/>
Since it is a known bug that equipping a drum does not increase the damage<br/>
from the DOT or increase the amount of magic resistance the mob loses, was<br/>
wondering if there is any positive effect for equiping the drum.  I was<br/>
thinking that its possible that the mobs chance to initially resist the song<br/>
may be decreased if you equip the drum.  For example, against a mob that<br/>
cons blue to you, you have a 60% chance of getting the song to stick just<br/>
singing it with no drum equipped.  If you have a drum equipped, the chances<br/>
of getting it to stick increases to 70%.  Anyone tested this?  Subjectively,<br/>
I have noticed when I sing DDD with a horn equipped it seems mobs resist<br/>
less than when I just sing DDD.  If that is true, you would think equipping<br/>
a drum increases your chances of getting Furfils to stick.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
