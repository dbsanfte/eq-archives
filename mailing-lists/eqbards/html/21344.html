<br/>
as to the verant &#39;&#39;changes&#39;&#39;, amazingly enough, i didn&#39;t notice any changes<br/>
in how my bard played with respect to lullaby over the last 10 months or so.<br/>
actually, my bard is much more powerful now than he was 10 moths ago.  chants<br/>
allow him to solo, higher charm allows him to crowd control mobs over 39 and <br/>
solo charm kiting to 50+.<br/>
<br/>
so there&#39;s no reason to quit for me, i am having as much or more fun playing my bard<br/>
as ever.  did crowd control with charm in karnors last night, kept 4 mobs busy<br/>
(charmed a skeletal warlord who had 3 drolvargs beating on him) while my <br/>
group took out a couple others.  unfortunately the warlord poofed when he died, but<br/>
his sacrifice was worth it, Thanks Skeletal_Warlord!!!!</div>
