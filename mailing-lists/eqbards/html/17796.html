<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165368646">Um. Killing a player is not considered a minor infraction to Guides.<br/>
It is one of the first things I was told by a Guide friend that they<br/>
COULD NOT do. No spells, no fighting players, no interacting with the <br/>
world in other than talking at ALL.<br/>

&gt;Still I think the way they were treated was insulting, and losing their<br/>
&gt;guide status for one very minor infraction was overkill. </span></blockquote></div>
