<br/>
My guild went to PoH Friday night.  By 4am, we had cleared everything (110+<br/>
kills) and had the maestro all alone.  There were about 25 of us and we took<br/>
him without any problems.  One clearing pull that agro&#39;d an outside patrol<br/>
group smooshed us lots harder than he did.  Our pullers brought his guards 2<br/>
at a time and we did them before hitting him.  He was definitely a red to 50<br/>
mob but did not seem as tough as Naggy or Vox.  It has been nearly 10 levels<br/>
since I have see the dragons so I hope you are right.<br/>
<br/>
I got the Six Note Blade and the Seven String Lute (I was the only bard<br/>
there) and they are great!  He was duel wielding the blade and the lute (got<br/>
to love the mob that cheat &lt;g&gt;) but if he tried to twist Verses and Niv&#39;s or<br/>
Hymn, it didn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
After that, we pulled a couple ashenbone drakes into the music room for<br/>
kicks and danced with them.  By 4.30am we called it a night and teleported<br/>
out.  I was so psyched I stayed up another 3 hours and ran around showing my<br/>
new stuff to everyone I could find.<br/>
<br/>
One happy bard here,<br/>

&gt; On Maestro:  Any NPC is harder when they are duel wielding (pretty common<br/>
&gt; knowledge), however,  the last time we faced Maestro he was duel wielding<br/>
&gt; the 6note and evensong.  Let me tell you that he raped us repeatedly.  I<br/>
&gt; would match him up against Vox or Naggy and he would have won with more<br/>
&gt; than half life.  We finally beat him down on our 4th try, but it was the<br/>
&gt; best fight I&#39;ve seen in a long time.  I think there were eight people left<br/>
&gt; after the battle  = ( )<br/>
