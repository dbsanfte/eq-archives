<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205693193">Well, the patch message itself is interesting enough (playing monsters? I <br/>
am SO there!)  but there are also some Bard-related notes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon. Now if the bard has his Epic <br/>
and an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect will take <br/>
precedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That should please those who&#39;ve gotten it.<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
&quot;Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  I&#39;ve been working with a piercing weapon as my primary for a while...<br/>
