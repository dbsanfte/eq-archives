 </span></blockquote>Lullaby IMHO defines the bard in group play from level 15 to<br/>
about level 27 (when you have other options to do with<br/>
multiple mobs than putting them to sleep).  Yes it gets<br/>
resisted, but that&#39;s really besides the point.  When your<br/>
party ends up with 4-10 mobs on it, Lullaby can make it seem<br/>
like 2-3.  They&#39;ll occasionally resist or wake up and take a<br/>
whack at you, but most of them will stay asleep, and your<br/>
party will love you because you&#39;ve turned a hopeless situation<br/>
into an easy win.  Just make sure you have a healer (because<br/>
you&#39;re going to be the center of attention of every mob), and<br/>
everyone in your party attacks the same thing at once (because<br/>
attacking them wakes them up, and they&#39;ll usually whack on the<br/>
bard when awake).<br/>
<br/>
Another use of Lullaby is that if it takes, it is 100%<br/>
guaranteed to interrupt a spellcaster.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pick it up next time you&#39;re in Erudian.  It&#39;s nice for sorting<br/>
out which ogre head is which in your bank box (though if the<br/>
latest no-drop quest item changes stick, this will be moot<br/>
since you&#39;re only going to be doing one quest at a time).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me guess - you were just singing the Rhythm songs, right?<br/>
Try playing them with a drum.  Up til about level 17 I&#39;d say<br/>
their use is minor.  At 17 you get Guardian Rhythms which<br/>
stacks with the other two Rhythm songs (those two don&#39;t stack<br/>
with each other).  With a drum and playing Guardian and<br/>
Elemental Rhythms, you should be able to get your party&#39;s<br/>
magic resist up over 75.  If a caster buffs everyone with<br/>
Endure Magic, that should be close to 100.  *Nobody* can raise<br/>
magic resist like a bard can.  As far as I know, the best<br/>
Endure Magic spell only increases it by 30 points.  At level<br/>
29 with a battle drum, I can raise it by close to 80 points.<br/>
