<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309469970">You don&#39;t have to be in combat... you don&#39;t have to be in PvP, or in a PvP<br/>
&quot;area&quot;.  The graphic doesn&#39;t have to play, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost : Make sure you have at least 1 point of skill already<br/>
trained in it.  I personally dumped 20 or so, when I first got it.  Next,<br/>
find yourself a secluded area in any zone anywhere and fire it up.  It takes<br/>
a LONG time for it to go up.  It took me roughly 3 hours to go from 52 skill<br/>
to 94 skill.  I practice it whenever the opportunity arises... on the boat,<br/>
when people are medding/resting and you&#39;re in a area that&#39;s safe to use it,<br/>
etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
Another point, I do _think_ that the skill will go up faster while in<br/>
combat.  I started using &quot;full instrument&quot; against faeries in Lesser Faydark<br/>
and my skill is up around 125 now.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m Crier Sharpsong, a 26th half-elf Bard on Fennin Ro.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been having a recurring problem getting my Brass skill <br/>
&gt; up and would<br/>
&gt; like to ask people here about it.  I&#39;ve read time and again <br/>
&gt; that I should<br/>
&gt; venture to Arena or a PvP area, start Denon&#39;s Disruptive <br/>
&gt; Discord and leave<br/>
&gt; it running indefinitely to increase my skill.  However, I <br/>
&gt; have not been<br/>
&gt; successful in getting that to work.  Initially I went to <br/>
&gt; Arena in Rathe Mts.<br/>
&gt; and tried this.  I had read that you only needed to be in the <br/>
&gt; area, not<br/>
&gt; actually in the PvP area itself, so I equipped my Minotaur <br/>
&gt; Horn, fired up,<br/>
&gt; fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, <br/>
&gt; fired up, DDD<br/>
&gt; and went to a restaurant for dinner.  Before I left I noticed that the<br/>
&gt; &quot;plays horn&quot; graphic wasn&#39;t running, but didn&#39;t think much <br/>
&gt; about it.  Got<br/>
&gt; back from dinner to find zero skill increase.  Hmm..  Ok, <br/>
&gt; perhaps I *do*<br/>
&gt; have to be in the PvP area, so I tried that.  Same results.  <br/>
&gt; Ok, maybe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the Minotaur Horn - maybe it&#39;s the problem.  So the next time <br/>
&gt; I was in the<br/>
&gt; bank and thought about it, I traded out my Minotaur Horn <br/>
&gt; (tired of the bag<br/>
&gt; in my wrist anyhow) for a standard store-bought horn.  Last <br/>
&gt; night I tried<br/>
&gt; practicing this song in the PvP area of Freeport and it again wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; actually play.  Well now I have gone to Kelethin and bought <br/>
&gt; Screech and am<br/>
&gt; completely unable to start the song due to my brass skill.  I <br/>
&gt; tried to start<br/>
&gt; Screech (literally) about 300 times last night with and <br/>
&gt; without the horn<br/>
&gt; equipped and had *one* success - not too useful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When there is not a mob within range of my song, what I get <br/>
&gt; is DDD starts, I<br/>
&gt; briefly get some orange flares from my hands and then it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; just me standing<br/>
&gt; there.  No playing horn graphic, no orange flares, nothing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone comment on this and/or offer a solution?  I *need* <br/>
&gt; this song, but<br/>
&gt; if Verant has changed it so that the only way for me to <br/>
&gt; increase my Brass<br/>
&gt; skill is to fight experience-giving mobs with it, I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; screwed.  I *WILL* die<br/>
&gt; trying to get DDD and/or Screech fired up against a blue mob.<br/>
