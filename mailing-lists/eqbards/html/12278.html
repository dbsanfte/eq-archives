<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780102673"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Made a level as my cleric last night.  Now lvl 14 casting lvl 4 &quot;Light<br/>
&gt; Healing&quot; spell.  Alteration (obviously) maxed for lvl 13.  112 Wis.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cast, fizz, fizz, cast, cast, cast, fizz, fizz, cast, fizz.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ironically that was my last fight of the evening since Veeshan (or at<br/>
&gt; least Lava Storm) crashed around 11:30 pm EST.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course since as soon as the fight started, we were experiencing that<br/>
&gt; pre-crash packet loss, my connection probably was very bad. So this fits<br/>
&gt; into both theories...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t really noticed fizzles during connection problems, But that is<br/>
probably due to the fact that I am on a Cable Modem. Recently, for the<br/>
very first time, While fighting in CT, there were 6 people in the zone.<br/>
All 6 of us were in a group in the Temple, and I decided i needed all my<br/>
regular songs, PLUS a MR song, AND I was Able to stack FOUR songs. I<br/>
would lose one around 10-20% of the time, but i was still impressed with<br/>
myself :).<br/>
