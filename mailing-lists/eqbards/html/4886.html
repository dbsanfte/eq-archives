<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-261270407">If you&#39;re considering upgrading your Voodoo3/2 (whateva), I HIGHLY recommend<br/>
the TNT2 Ultra (TNT2 vice TNT2 Ultra is only 20 bucks and its worth it for<br/>
the higher quality cores if nothing else).  Yes, I still get some quite<br/>
noticeable lag when the Sand-Giant-at-plat-everyone-come-help!!! stuff<br/>
occurs, but in a normal group with 2-3 casters going apeshit its extremely<br/>
playable at 1024x768x32, with dual layering and part mapping.  Frost rift or<br/>
whatever that shaman spell is for some reason ALWAYS gets me even if its by<br/>
itself, so your mileage my vary in how individual vendors handle certain<br/>
graphical aspects.<br/>
Second, bandwidth.  Upstream is near nothing, MAYBE in a standard gaming<br/>
session something like 500kB/hr, so guys that were concerned about your<br/>
1GB/month upstream limits don&#39;t have any concerns; even if it was 1 MB/hr<br/>
and you were on 24x7, that&#39;s only 720 MB.  Its peanuts compared to<br/>
downstream.  That&#39;s closer to 3.5 MB/hr.  If we make the make the math<br/>
really simple and call it:<br/>
<br/>
3600 kB/1 hr x 1 hr/3600 s x 8 kb/1 kB = 8 kb/s = 8 kbps.<br/>
<br/>
Getting a cable modem or DSL is almost a waste of money if you&#39;re just doing<br/>
it for EQ.  This, of course, assumes there is a constant stream of data,<br/>
when in fact its feast or famine.  The hot spots are, duh, zoning, since the<br/>
game has to extract you from your current zone, zero you out of any<br/>
structures it keeps both on the server and locally and finally insert you in<br/>
the new zone.<br/>
<br/>
Just because I was interested, I did a little network watching: zoning<br/>
generally spews out an odd 300k of data each time for normal density zones,<br/>
high density ones (NRO in particular) are closer to 700k.  You might be<br/>
tempted to think wow, with a DSL I can zone in 10 secs!  But you also have<br/>
the overhead associated with loading the new zone data from disk, which is<br/>
time consuming in and of itself.  If you have a new computer, chances are<br/>
you have support for UDMA/33 or /66 both of which will noticeable improve<br/>
load times (~10% in my experience with /33).  Contact your vendor, its a<br/>
painless patch to enable it under Win98.<br/>
<br/>
Your average V.90 modem is capable of very high bursty transmission rates<br/>
but in all honesty you&#39;re usually waiting on the rest of the internet, so<br/>
common numbers are usually around 3.5-5 kbps on clean lines.  Someone<br/>
mentioned that winmodems, which are software driven, vice hardware modem<br/>
implementations add 100 ms to ping times due to additional CPU load.  Sorta,<br/>
but not quite - the additional load on the CPU is only the actual<br/>
decomposition of data, the relatively laborious modulation/demodulation is<br/>
done by the chip on board the winmodem.  In real terms this only adds MAYBE<br/>
1-2% to the CPU load and its relatively low-priority and almost nil in real<br/>
world transmission rates (maybe +10 ms) - it doesn&#39;t make that big of an<br/>
impact on game play.  The price difference between a winmodem and hardware<br/>
one is just not justified in my mind; go spend that extra 50 bucks on a<br/>
premium motherboard.  Even if you never intend to overclock your system<br/>
(there by making all claims of additional CPU load moot), generic mainboards<br/>
tend to be electrically noisy and often have difficulty maintaining constant<br/>
voltage to all components.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to ping.  Its just not that great of an indication.  Speaking from<br/>
experience (I&#39;m a network programming and sysadmin), opening a socket is FAR<br/>
more reliable.  I&#39;ve got a really quick and dirty pong program which does<br/>
just this as well as dumping out oodles of other interesting network info.<br/>
I&#39;ll tweak it for EQ purposes and post it to my website when I get the<br/>
chance.  On an interesting side note... it wouldn&#39;t be all that hard to<br/>
write a tintin-esque client for EQ knowing what I&#39;ve seen from watching the<br/>
network traffic.  You&#39;d have to run it on blind faith, since what&#39;d you do<br/>
is sniff the incoming data and then handcraft the appropriate response to a<br/>
given keyed trigger.  This would be of use to bards on songs that fail<br/>
however I&#39;m not sure how well it would interact with your local GUI, since<br/>
all button-downs/disabled, etc are handled on your end.  Might futz around<br/>
with it.  If I do I&#39;ll let you know my findings.<br/>
<br/>
Just FYI, I have a celeron 300A o/c&#39;d to 464 (Abit BX6r2), 512 MB RAM (which<br/>
is beautiful, I have windows virtual memory turned off, once you experience<br/>
this you won&#39;t want to go back!), TNT2 Ultra w/32MB, 8.4 GB WD, MX-300, el<br/>
cheapo 44x cdrom and V.90 winmodem.  This was put together for 756 bucks<br/>
TOTAL.  The net is a great place to shop if you&#39;ve got the patience to look<br/>
around for the bargains.  It took me 2 weeks to find and get everything in,<br/>
but it was well worth it considering the financial savings and extreme<br/>
performance of my new rig.</div>
