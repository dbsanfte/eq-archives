<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989319803"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think his gripe was that your guild doesn&#39;t leave any<br/>
&gt; dragons alive long enough for others to kill them.  Dunno if<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s actually the case.  But sharing means sharing with<br/>
&gt; others who want what you&#39;re sharing, not just sharing with<br/>
&gt; your friends.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	No, my take was right.  If anyone on our server wants us to not<br/>
kill a dragon when it spawns, all they have to do is send our guild leader<br/>
a tell saying &quot;we&#39;d like a chance to kill the next Vox spawn&quot; and we have<br/>
always replied &quot;sure&quot; and given them plenty of time (usually 2 or 3 days).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I&#39;ve seen done is for the multi-guild coordinated party<br/>
&gt; to take over the /ooc or /auction channel and use that for<br/>
&gt; coordination in lieu of /guildsay.  (/shout too, but that can<br/>
&gt; get annoying for others in the zone.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not the actual fight co-ordination.  It&#39;s getting another guild to<br/>
get the right people to the right place at the right time.  It&#39;s already a<br/>
pain in the neck to get everyone in our guild to show up, to have to<br/>
worry about another guild too is turning a 2 hour Vox trip to a 6 hour Vox<br/>
trip.  Plus, we can get 24 people to show up in Sol B in an hours notice.<br/>
We can&#39;t do that if there&#39;s another guild involved.<br/>
