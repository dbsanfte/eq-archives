<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361767767">It took me a long time to get the timing of charm right. Mainly because I<br/>
didn&#39;t use it at first because I didn&#39;t realize how powerful it was.<br/>
<br/>
After MUCH experimentation, here&#39;s the best method I&#39;ve found to get the<br/>
timing...<br/>
<br/>
First you need to know the timing of your regular songs pat. I can do 3<br/>
songs with no trouble and about a half a tick of leeway if I do it right.<br/>
(if I anticipate the pulse and drop my songs earlier I can get 4, but it&#39;s<br/>
unreliable and very difficult in a fight)<br/>
<br/>
I usually do this:<br/>
<br/>
Charm<br/>
Off Song<br/>
Off Song<br/>
<br/>
slight pause to allow for the leeway. (anywhere from 1/4 of a tick to 3/4 of<br/>
a tick depending on how good my juggling was and whether there were any<br/>
dropped notes)<br/>
<br/>
Re Charm<br/>
<br/>
Lack of room on my palette usually requires me to sing the same off song<br/>
twice, so I try to make it a useful song for the situation. (usually pixie<br/>
strike vs high caster concentration areas or snare if there&#39;s no druid.)<br/>
<br/>
My palette is organized as such:<br/>
<br/>
1) Charm<br/>
2) Off song<br/>
3) /pet attack (social key)<br/>
4) /assist [main tank] (social key)<br/>
5) /pet back off (social key)<br/>
6) /pet guard here (social key)<br/>
<br/>
/pet back off is there in case my pet decides to beat on a party member<br/>
despite my orders and /pet guard here is there so I can stop him from pacing<br/>
after he&#39;s finished killing his former teamates and I&#39;m waiting for charm to<br/>
break.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while to get used to the timing, but once you do, you may never<br/>
demem it again.<br/>
