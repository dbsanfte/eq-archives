<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346838417">What?  You mean hundreds of bards aren&#39;t lining up for a chance to kill<br/>
Venril so they can all summon food if they get lucky and get their legs<br/>
dropped???<br/>

i know, i said that you can proc even if you miss and do no damage.  but i<br/>
think that is because it is coded as a HIT but for 0 damage.  with a rune<br/>
effect up, there are no hits, so the Venril proc did not work on us.  he<br/>
only hit for 8 or so dmg then, so the rune never wore off.  now he hits for<br/>
300 i think.  i&#39;m not sure if a 200 poison resist will do much against him,<br/>
and not sure if anyone wants to try now =)<br/>
