&gt; Eh, John... how do you do the macro inventory changing thing?  That&#39;d<br/>
&gt; be a big time help for me :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The macro buttons can hold not just buttons, but your<br/>
inventory slots as well.<br/>
<br/>
Flip to a empty macro page (you will need 5-6 empty spaces).<br/>
<br/>
Go to the inventory screen (&#39;i&#39;) and right-click on your<br/>
picture to display everything you&#39;re wearing.<br/>
<br/>
Left-click and hold on the left melee slot.  It&#39;ll attach<br/>
itself to your pointer just like a button.  Switch out of<br/>
inventory mode (&#39;i&#39;) and drop this &quot;button&quot; on one of the<br/>
empty macro slots.<br/>
<br/>
Repeat for your other melee slot.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the inventory screen.  In the lower right are your<br/>
8 primary inventory slots.  Repeat the above procedure to put<br/>
3 or 4 of them in macro slots.  This will not work with slots<br/>
in containers - it must be one of the 8 primary inventory<br/>
slots.<br/>
<br/>
Now you should have both melee slots and 3-4 inventory slots<br/>
on the macro.  Equip a sword and shield, and put your drum in<br/>
one of your macroed inventory slots.<br/>
<br/>
To switch from sword/shield to drum, switch to this macro<br/>
(shift-#), left-click on the sword to pick it up, drop it on<br/>
the drum slot (which picks up the drum), drop the drum on the<br/>
shield to equip the drum (which should pick up the shield),<br/>
and drop the shield on an empty inventory slot.  Reverse the<br/>
procedure to switch back to a weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Practice it a bit at first.  If you miss and don&#39;t drop the<br/>
item in the right place on the slot, the item falls to the<br/>
ground so it pays (literally) to learn how to do it right.  <br/>
Positioning the upper-left corner of the item in the middle of<br/>
the slot seems to work best.  I still drop things sometimes,<br/>
and believe me your heart skips a beat when you drop a combine<br/>
longsword.  :-)<br/>
