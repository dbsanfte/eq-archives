<div id="ygrps-yiv-769601143">I think we are.  Every bard could use more dex (less missed notes, less<br/>
chance of resist) more stamina (my sta is a whopping 67.  I&#39;m sure getting<br/>
it up to 77 would make a BIG difference), the haste effect would actually<br/>
turn us into semi-decent meleers.  At least we&#39;d be able to take up the<br/>
slack if one of the tanks had to back off.  The strength would help too, as<br/>
I&#39;m always within 10-15 of my max limit, so I hardly loot anything.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a vein in my<br/>
&gt; forehead.<br/>
&gt; It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed Bolster Belt.<br/>
&gt; This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste effect. The<br/>
&gt; question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>
&gt; abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>
&gt; had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>
&gt; (Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>
&gt; would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>
&gt; a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>
