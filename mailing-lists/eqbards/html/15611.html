&gt; I just heard on the radio on my way into work that last night <br/>
&gt; a woman was<br/>
&gt; cutoff and hit the back of this guys SUV. He got out of his <br/>
&gt; SUV, she rolled<br/>
&gt; down her window, he reaches in, grabs her dog from her lap <br/>
&gt; and throws it<br/>
&gt; into traffic, where it is killed.<br/>
