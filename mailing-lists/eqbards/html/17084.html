<div id="ygrps-yiv-855087372">Overcrowding is not something that can be controlled by a class of<br/>
characters :p  And on overcrowded servers a group with a Bard will still<br/>
make better experience as they are ready to pull another mob sooner then the<br/>
group with out a bard.<br/>

PS Not every server is overcrowded, and in some cases it is more an issue of<br/>
zone overcrowding then overall server overcrowding.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll see your FBSS and yaks and raise you a HQ Bear Skin that overcrowding<br/>
would beat downtime.  And less people per server would help all classes.<br/>
Just about anyone would be welcome in a group were the ratio of mobs/players<br/>
better.<br/>
