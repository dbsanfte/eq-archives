&gt; Ok, Verant is at a loss as to how to fill in our slots - and the upcoming<br/>
&gt; additions don&#39;t seem to hold much hope of anything &#39;new&#39;. Lets look at what<br/>
&gt; we do, and how we do it...hmmmm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any competent bard twists/weaves (insert your favorite teminology for it<br/>
&gt; here) songs. This results in constant button mashing (twitching) in a non<br/>
&gt; twitch game. I love my bard, I love what we do - I don&#39;t like constantly<br/>
&gt; mashing buttons. Same reason I don&#39;t like having to switch out<br/>
&gt; weapons/instruments.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably too late for EQ, but at this point I&#39;m of the opinion<br/>
that a better implementation of a bard class would&#39;ve been<br/>
allowing only one song at a time, but having the higher level<br/>
songs confer multiple effects, perhaps switching instruments<br/>
to emphasize different effects.  e.g. instead of having one<br/>
song for attack speedups and buffs, one for resists, and one<br/>
for healing; there&#39;d be just one song that did all that.  Use<br/>
it with a drum for extra resists, use it with a horn for extra<br/>
buffs, use it with a lute for extra healing.  The lower level<br/>
songs would only confer one effect, while the higher level<br/>
ones would combine more and more effects.<br/>
<br/>
You lose out on the flexibility of the current system, but the<br/>
constant button mashing (CBM?) is verging on ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll dig up my copy of Bard&#39;s Tale...<br/>
