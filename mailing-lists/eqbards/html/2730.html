<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036466288">Music has always been a huge part in my life.  I&#39;ve been in and out of<br/>
bands for years, helped with distro and recordings and such, put out my<br/>
own music zine, organize shows in my area, all sorts of fun stuff.  I<br/>
can play guitar, bass, a little bit of drums, and a couple brass<br/>
instruments (but not well enough yet.. been working on trombone mostly).<br/>
I&#39;ve mostly stuck to punk rock, as it&#39;s the one music style that appeals<br/>
to me the most, altho I also dabble in 80&#39;s pop,<br/>
ska/skapunk/skacore/etc, and a few oldies covers for fun.  Overall, I<br/>
can&#39;t see myself giving up music anytime soon, it&#39;s always been one of<br/>
my favorite hobbies and a very large part of my life.  Playing a bard<br/>
wasn&#39;t even a choice for me, it was automatic.  *shrugs*<br/>
Take care!<br/>
