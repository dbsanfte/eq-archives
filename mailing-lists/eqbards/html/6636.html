&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I tried a little experiment last night with SOW and Selo&#39;s.  I had a<br/>
&gt; Shaman (9th level) cast SOW while I was playing Selo&#39;s.  SOW did NOT<br/>
&gt; override Selo&#39;s.  Both Icons stayed up on my screen, and I still got &#39;Your<br/>
&gt; feet move faster messages&#39;, and ran at Selo&#39;s speed.  However, once I<br/>
&gt; stopped Selo&#39;s, SOW took over, and I could not restart Selo&#39;s speed.  I got<br/>
&gt; the same thing, song visuals, but no message, and no extra speed, with drum<br/>
&gt; or without.  So, if you are playing Selo&#39;s when SOW is cast on you, you can<br/>
&gt; still run at full speed, but, if you turn it off, you are now stuck.  Also,<br/>
&gt; from my experience of the last 2 nights, the difference between the length<br/>
&gt; of a 19th level SOW and a 9th level SOW is about 2 times.  Night before last<br/>
&gt; SOW from a 19th lasted over half an hour, near to 45 minutes.  The 9th level<br/>
&gt; SOW last night lasted just about 20 to 25 minutes.  Luckily last night I was<br/>
&gt; just playing around, and not out trying to kill stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I noticed something the other night when I was on with my Bard as well<br/>
that was even odder. I was playing selo&#39;s dispite having SoW on and<br/>
zoned. On the other side, when the Selo&#39;s wore off, it seemed as if I<br/>
slowed down to normal walking speed. Someone might want to check if that<br/>
was really the case or not.<br/>
