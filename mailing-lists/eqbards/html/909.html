&gt;Ack!  I find this very disturbing.  What is it exactly, about bards at the<br/>
&gt;30+ level, that makes them so godawful?  With dual wield and the ability to<br/>
&gt;wear plate, I would think a bard could actually hold his or her own at<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Several points... bards are mob magnets... usually at the worst possible<br/>
time. =)  Fighters, even with same type of armor, seem to be able to handle<br/>
dmg better than bards.  And I don&#39;t know about others, but my ability to<br/>
deal out damage really sucks.  I hit about 60% of the time, and maximum<br/>
damage with my current weapons (barbed whip and combine LS) is 42 per round,<br/>
plus bellow for an additional 17 for a total dmg of 59.  Compare this to a<br/>
caster who can do 300+ with a single spell, or a rogue who can do 80+ with<br/>
backstab, or a fighter with a good 2h weapon who can do 70+ with weapon<br/>
alone, plus kick, bash, riposte, etc. And don&#39;t forget rogues and monks<br/>
disarming their opponents.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, bards are, strictly speaking, a luxury item, not a necessity in a<br/>
group.  Every group needs tanks and healers.  After that they need nukers.<br/>
What we do is make everyone else more effective.  We minimize downtime by<br/>
topping off the hurt with our heal song, bringing casters back into action<br/>
faster with mana song, make the tanks deal out more damage with anthem,<br/>
protect with the guardian series, etc.<br/>
But strictly speaking, we are not truly &quot;needed&quot;, not the way a healer is.<br/>
<br/>
You want to show a group how important a bard can be? Go join a group that&#39;s<br/>
camping Drez or any charm-using mob, and do nothing but stack Guardian and<br/>
Elemental.  That ups everyone&#39;s magic resist to 80 or better.  No one gets<br/>
charmed anymore. =)<br/>
<br/>
Or a Tae room group with 2 pallys, cleric, druid, wiz, and a mana bard.  I<br/>
did a group like that the other night and we did a 20 minute non-stop melee.<br/>
No one died, no one was ever totally OOM.  I&#39;d step back and hit mana song<br/>
to recharge the caster and healers, then back into melee and do anthem some<br/>
more.  We piled the bodies high around us that night. =)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I&#39;m finding is that it&#39;s people who were in early beta phases, and they<br/>
want to be with their old friends more than being with new friends. Their<br/>
old friends know the mobs, know how to stay on top of the spawn.  Newer<br/>
friends take time to learn this, and in bad situations, that time might<br/>
spell someones death.  They&#39;ll take a 33 shaman instead of a 33 bard because<br/>
that shaman goes back to P0.5, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But once you become known as someone who is *GOOD*, you can break down those<br/>
walls.  It just takes so awfully long to do that most give up.  I&#39;m too<br/>
damned obstinate to quit. =)<br/>
