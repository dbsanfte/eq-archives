<b>Subject:</b> I have some possible bad news Disenchanting results with Melody <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493181290">I do not mean to raise an alarm especially on a song that was never<br/>
particularly useful.  However I just had been hit with a Steal Strength<br/>
spell by a SK when passing through South Karana.  I took the opportunity to<br/>
test one of our more useless songs.. after 10 pulses it never managed to<br/>
remove the spell.  I ask our stronger kin to please test these results and<br/>
make sure the song was not killed again.<br/>
