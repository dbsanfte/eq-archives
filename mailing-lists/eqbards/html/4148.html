I know if you give a necro&#39;s pet a weapon after a certain level, they get<br/>
really upset - the pet is &#39;nerfed&#39; compaired to the damage it would do with<br/>
the weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, this smells like an exploit fighting harder skele&#39;s to me, or does it<br/>
work differently?<br/>

&gt;Yes you can place items on mobs. Often times when I forage something, or<br/>
&gt;just got done looting a mob, and another agro mob attacks, I simply click<br/>
&gt;the item to the mod, kill it then retrieve the items.<br/>

&gt;Which if bards had a more permanent charm song could really make a mean pack<br/>
&gt;animal/monster exploit.<br/>
