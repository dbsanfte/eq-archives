<div id="ygrps-yiv-672348246">I can&#39;t comment to much on the normal stuff, since my guild is, well, kinda uberish and these aren&#39;t scary<br/>
anymore, but some hints (mostly for Hate, since I&#39;ve only been to Fear twice and they were cakewalks):<br/>
<br/>
1.  Singing on the pull is OK, unless you&#39;re in the pulling group.  Don&#39;t join the pulling group the first<br/>
few times up there, you&#39;ll forget and kill somebody.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Poison resist works great against Maestro&#39;s lifetaps.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Sing resists against Innoruuk, turn to face the wall or it will be impossible to twist a darn thing.<br/>
<br/>
4.  The overhead view works very well in Hate, since the ceiling is at the right height.  I get a LOT less<br/>
lagged playing the overhead view, and it&#39;s a lot easier to see which direction the MOB ran if he starts to<br/>
ping-pong.<br/>
<br/>
5.  The Spite Golems are way way magic resistant, don&#39;t bother singing against them.<br/>
<br/>
Question:  Was the DOT bug fixed?<br/>
