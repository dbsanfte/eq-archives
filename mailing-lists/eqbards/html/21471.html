<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017056097">I fail to understand your point.  Isn&#39;t EVERY spell effect - particularly<br/>
from an item simply &quot;an algorithm&quot;  Technically speaking - all code is<br/>
algorithms.<br/>
<br/>
But more specifically - the fact that the item&#39;s Haste effect added to spell<br/>
haste effects was fundamental to the way that item worked.  Players have<br/>
expected that - and more importantly - as Rokenn pointed out - balancing by<br/>
players (and probably even the final Kunark betas) were done by players<br/>
using these items.  Previously Verant would NEVER change an item<br/>
after-the-fact like this.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, Kyrisha rightly pointed out that there has been a significant<br/>
change in philosophy of the balance and &quot;Vision&quot; since GW took over.<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m wrong in saying they are inconsistent - that there has been a<br/>
fundamental change in philosophy that is now consistent.<br/>
