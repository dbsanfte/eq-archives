<div id="ygrps-yiv-147135998">I&#39;d be perfectly happy with the binding situation if that were the case.<br/>
There would then be plenty of naked casters in cities saying &quot;Will bind for<br/>
food&quot;  Binding would become much easier for all since there are always<br/>
plenty of castersdying at almost any time of nite.  problem now is they<br/>
reappear outside the dungeon miles away from where they could bind anyone<br/>
else.<br/>

Woah,<br/>
Things have been heating up inhere since I left work yesterday =). I will<br/>
just<br/>
throw in my views on the most debated subjects...<br/>
<br/>
I  think the melee/hybrid/caster thread needs to be kaboinged.. now.<br/>
And the bind thread should IMO go the same way, but first I would like to<br/>
support and back Shada&#39;s point of view. I am a casual player who have been<br/>
playing since day one of p4 beta I also only play a few hours a day and is<br/>
nowhere near Shada&#39;s levels (Never played a char that could bind). I have<br/>
also<br/>
been playing my bard since April or so. That said I still agree with Shada<br/>
that<br/>
binding should be keept the way it is or even changed so that casters are<br/>
limited to binding themselves in cities too.<br/>
<br/>
Running back to your corpse is a penalty for dying just as the exp loss is.<br/>
The<br/>
exp loss is not a very harsh penalty unless you die several times in a row.<br/>
So<br/>
IMO the only real penalty is the hazzle of running back to your corpse.<br/>
If there wasent a penalty like this the game would turn into something very<br/>
boring. I for one cant figure out any penalty that I would &quot;like&quot; better<br/>
than<br/>
running back? Bigger exp loss? Loss of equipment? stat penalties?<br/>
I like it the way it is, EQ is not an easy game thats why it still dont bore<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
This hazzle is not even that bad with the bard because of the running speed<br/>
IMO.<br/>
where as with my shadowknight its more tedius because of his slow running<br/>
speed<br/>
and the fact that guards and merchants dont like him much, and even then if<br/>
its<br/>
really far away I can useually find a friendly person to cast sow on me.<br/>
<br/>
As to bards being able to bind?? No I really dont like that idea. With<br/>
selo&#39;s we<br/>
are pretty well off for travelling and giving bards bind will seriusly<br/>
overpower<br/>
unless it was made useless by giving it penalties.<br/>
I really dont understand people who have troubles finding anyone to bind<br/>
(exept<br/>
in Erud offcourse), and I even play from europe which means that most of my<br/>
time<br/>
online there is &lt; 1000 players online (bertox server).<br/>
<br/>
Well these are my views - Feel free to disagree ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Best regards and KABOING TO ME<br/>

<br/>
Shada: what you say in your last sentence sums up the whole issue.  For me<br/>
at least, the time spent travelling back to your corpse from multiple zones<br/>
away is not fun and completely boring.  That time could be better spent<br/>
adventuring, which is the fun part of EQ to me.  Lets say on average it<br/>
takes you 15 minutes to get back to your corpse.  If you could get bound in<br/>
non-cities, the amount of EXP you could gain during those 15 minutes is<br/>
nowhere near the amount you lost when you died.  However, you get to spend<br/>
that 15 minutes playing the game in whatever manner makes it fun for you.<br/>
IMO, the binding issue isn&#39;t a class balance issue but a &quot;Is this really<br/>
what I want to be spending my valuable game time doing&quot; issue.  Don&#39;t take<br/>
any offense, but based on the fact that you have a 50th level character and<br/>
two 20+ level characters, you obviously have more time to devote to playing<br/>
EQ than I do.  My only character is my 23d level bard and I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
him since April.  That gives you a pretty good idea how much time I get to<br/>
play.  As I have said before, for casual gamers who don&#39;t get to play EQ<br/>
that much, not being able to bind in non-cities has a major impact.  When I<br/>
die, that pretty much writes off the rest of the gaming session for me.<br/>
Thats why I support a change to the policy.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; sorry i don&#39;t see the connection.  i advocate not letting melee/hybrid<br/>
&gt; classes to be able to bind, making the game harder.  how does that make it<br/>
&gt; easier to &quot;win&quot; or have anything to do with what you said?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; no one likes dying, not just some folks.  that&#39;s the point, it is bad to<br/>
&gt; die.  if there were no consequences, there would be no challenge.  is this<br/>
&gt; what you are referring to, my point of the game being a challenge?  this<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; nothing to do with wanting to win, it has only to do with wanting to have<br/>
&gt; fun, and not being bored.  it is after all a game, and if you are not<br/>
&gt; having<br/>
&gt; fun, you shouldn&#39;t be playing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Some folks just don&#39;t like dying - that in and of itself is<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; penalty, thank you very much.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is where the paradigm falls back to singlemindset games<br/>
&gt; &gt; - that there<br/>
&gt; &gt; has to be a way to &#39;keep score&#39; - that puts the emphasis on<br/>
&gt; &gt; advancement and<br/>
&gt; &gt; competition with others - instead of living in the world, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; working with<br/>
&gt; &gt; others.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You cannot &#39;win&#39; in a persistent world - nor should the goals be<br/>
&gt; &gt; artificially propped up to encourage that attitude.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One of EQs major shortcomings - is there is a perceived<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;end&#39;. Games - read<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;worlds&#39; of this nature are going to have to mature past the<br/>
&gt; &gt; singleplayer<br/>
&gt; &gt; game mindset baggage they have towed along with them, for<br/>
&gt; &gt; these worlds to<br/>
&gt; &gt; truly reach their full potential.<br/>
