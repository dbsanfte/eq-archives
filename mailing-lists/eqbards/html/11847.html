<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931429638">I honestly suspect that in the next week for two GZ will make some<br/>
pronouncement that Pixie Strike and Lullaby are working correctly or &quot;as<br/>
intended&quot;.  I&#39;m betting we are Lullabying the mobs but that the duration is<br/>
about a quarter second.<br/>

&gt; heh heh, yeah it&#39;d be nice if he said higher level mobs have a greater<br/>
&gt; chance of resisting = lvl 2 mobs suffer no effect 20% of the time.  Really<br/>
&gt; higher level mobs have a really higher chance of resisting =<br/>
&gt; asymptotically<br/>
&gt; approaching 100% chance of no effect despite failing to resist as level<br/>
&gt; approaches 40.<br/>

&gt; Well I couldn&#39;t help myself, I had to try it.  I was camping the<br/>
&gt; Savant and<br/>
&gt; Cavalier (Sav/Cav) last night with a competent group.  We had a Cleric,<br/>
&gt; Shaman, Ranger, Warrior, Magician and Myself (39th bard).  Pretty<br/>
&gt; balanced.<br/>
&gt; We were pulling both rooms to the Savant area and fighting there.  I was<br/>
&gt; brought on as mana pump but my team was very pleasantly surprised to find<br/>
&gt; that I could twist three songs, melee fairly effectively and perform crowd<br/>
&gt; control.  We were so successful that we cleared all the way from the Sav<br/>
&gt; room to the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons (GIBS) and started pulling those.<br/>
&gt; After having to alternately Pixie Strike two GIBS during a 10+<br/>
&gt; minute battle<br/>
&gt; and having resists and missed notes allow them break out and<br/>
&gt; freeze me from<br/>
&gt; time to time I decided I&#39;d dust off Lullaby and try it.  Heh.<br/>
&gt; Never again.<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t die thanks to the Cleric and Shaman, but Lullaby had virtually no<br/>
&gt; effect other than Taunt.  If they&#39;re mezzed with Lullaby, it&#39;s so brief as<br/>
&gt; to be negligible.  GZ would probably remind me that &quot;higher level<br/>
&gt; mobs have<br/>
&gt; a greater chance of resisting&quot;, which is fine I suppose, but damn<br/>
&gt; - give me<br/>
&gt; resist messages.<br/>
