Chant of Clarity) work differently from most songs - when you sing them, <br/>
the instant they pulse, they shoot that extra mana to everyone <br/>
listening.  There is no continuing pulse afterwards.  To get a pulse every <br/>
tick, you would have to keep singing the song constantly, but since this <br/>
isn&#39;t as efficient, most bards weave other songs into the mix.<br/>
