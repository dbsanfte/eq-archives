<div id="ygrps-yiv-103589048">It does not seem to hide your religion. Nek guards hate Evile Sylly as much<br/>
as Goodie Sylly and I think it is religion based. What&#39;s kinda weird is the<br/>
Oger merch just inside Ogg will sell to me as Evile Sylly but attacks me as<br/>
Goodie Sylly - but the Bouncers hate both of me.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly - but which one?  &lt;muhaha&gt;<br/>

		I was concerned that when in dark elf form I would be<br/>
attacked by the guards<br/>
		and inhabitants of the good aligned cities I am normally<br/>
looked upon kindly<br/>
		or warmly by, but this is not the case.  Apparently you keep<br/>
all your<br/>
		faction adjustments while under the dark elf illusion of the<br/>
guise.<br/>
<br/>
		My question is, is it useful in any way to by disguised as a<br/>
dark elf when<br/>
		attempting to enter the evil aligned cities or is the mask&#39;s<br/>
illusion just<br/>
		some nice eye-candy that gives you infravision?<br/>
