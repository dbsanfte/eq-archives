<div id="ygrps-yiv-653212559"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; At 120 charisma I consider the number of missed notes I get to<br/>
&gt; be intolerable.  I&#39;d estimate I&#39;m missing notes about 10%-20%<br/>
&gt; of the time on low-level songs (will have to test it some time<br/>
&gt; this week).  If it&#39;s worse with lower charisma, I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; how any of you are able to stand it.  I worked on my enchanter<br/>
&gt; this entire weekend because I actually get to play the game,<br/>
&gt; instead of assidiously watching the chat window for &quot;missed<br/>
&gt; a note&quot; messages.  I played my bard again a couple hours<br/>
&gt; tonight, and half the time I didn&#39;t even know what was going<br/>
&gt; on or what song effects I had up because I was so busy trying<br/>
&gt; to watch for and recover from missed notes.  It is very<br/>
&gt; frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My understanding of this, based on conversations with some GMs and high level bards<br/>
as well as my own experience is that missed notes is related to dexterity, not<br/>
charisma.  It&#39;s hard to notice a difference, because it&#39;s surely just a few<br/>
percentage points, but I feel like I miss fewer notes with a grotesque mask on than<br/>
without.<br/>
