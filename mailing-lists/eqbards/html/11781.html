&gt; Try this:  In Rathe, you can make HGs spawn by killing the basilisks and<br/>
&gt; skeletons and lizards.  Kill as many of these as you can until you see<br/>

had the other pulled before my giant reaches it.  Now I&#39;m<br/>
stuck with a giant chasing me until I can find another.  With<br/>
the screen update lag in the zone, most people are pretty<br/>
understanding, and I usually give the non-ranger/druid/bards<br/>
pointers to where other giants are on tracking.  If I do<br/>
inadvertently wind up stealing one, I give them the<br/>
almost-dead winner, which they&#39;re usually more than happy to<br/>
take.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of factors working against player cooperation<br/>
in Rathe (screen lag, pathing bugs, short distance/altitude<br/>
beyond which you can&#39;t see other players, etc).  If someone<br/>
&quot;steals&quot; a HG from you, don&#39;t immediately assume he stole it,<br/>
and you&#39;ll find a lot of people are friendly and understanding<br/>
about these things.<br/>
