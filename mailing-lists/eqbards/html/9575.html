the cost of future repairs is increased.  And by the time most<br/>
car engines start to wear out, most people are looking to buy<br/>
a new car anyway.  Once people realize their bladed thulian<br/>
claws could vanish on them in a blink of an eye, they will<br/>
repair it religiously.<br/>
<br/>
Now, a system where weapon and armor effectiveness started to<br/>
degrade with wear and remembered a &quot;repair history&quot; that<br/>
affected wear rate, that might be something.  (And hopefully<br/>
figure out a way to avoid the way UO did it, where you had to<br/>
trust the smith doing the repairs and hand your equipment over<br/>
to him.)<br/>
