<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110313090">I&#39;ve seen four natural 100&#39;s on /random 100 in my career... 2 by me and 2 by<br/>
my wife, and we&#39;ve done A LOT of randoms.  Maybe I&#39;m just lucky and haven&#39;t<br/>
hit that whole bubble of XP lost random yet :-).  If she ever died, I&#39;d be<br/>
able to tell you how much XP she lost.  She&#39;s also level 35 with full<br/>
crafted from questing and 14 days less playing time then I!<br/>

&gt; My friends and I have always assumed that there is a large random<br/>
component<br/>
&gt; involved in how much experience you lose when you croak.  Within a single<br/>
level,<br/>
&gt; the variability seems to be as much as 400%.  I do think that you lose<br/>
&gt; significantly more in Hell Level + 1, and you APPEAR to lose significantly<br/>
less<br/>
&gt; in Hell Levels, but each bubble requires much more exp than the preceding<br/>
(or<br/>
&gt; succeeding) levels there, and I think the net exp loss is about the same<br/>
as a<br/>
&gt; normal level.  It would not be unlike Verant to &quot;play dice with the<br/>
universe&quot;,<br/>
&gt; considering that the amount of lost exp that is restored by Cleric spells<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; random within a set of defined parameters (e.g., 0-25%, 0-75%).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;       I get a chuckle with people trying to come up with elaborate<br/>
theories<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; relating to the experience loss on death.  We all forget Occum&#39;s Razor<br/>
(the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; simplest explanation is probably the correct one).  Sounds to me that<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; completely random...<br/>
