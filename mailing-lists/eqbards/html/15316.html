<div id="ygrps-yiv-515255451">In PVP I&#39;d sing VoV, I think the speedup is the same as warsong (sad huh?)<br/>
but it&#39;s buffs are a bit better<br/>
<br/>
My combo for fighting a melee class PVP:  (just substitute VoV for Warsong<br/>
since you&#39;re 50 and Nivs for Healing)<br/>
<br/>
Warsong, HoR, Psalm... (I will choose the appropriate Psalm based on the<br/>
most frequently used weapon/proc)<br/>
I throw in a cancel magic on THEM a couple times to knock out any and all of<br/>
their buffs.  Meanwhile mine are constantly refreshed.  They tear themselves<br/>
up on my dmg shields while I am constantly healing myself as well as hurting<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Works pretty well, don&#39;t bother using Chain till they&#39;re below 50% health.<br/>
I dunno if anyone else has noticed but things seem to get resisted less when<br/>
someone/thing is below 50% health.<br/>

&gt; would warsong or VoV be better in a solo situation?  i ask because last<br/>
&gt; night i finally won my first duel against a melee class (without kiting or<br/>
&gt; running, i stand up to them!).  out of 4 duels, i won 2.  he&#39;s a level 50<br/>
&gt; rogue in my guild, full hateplane armor, crystalline spear, vexthorne,<br/>
bone<br/>
&gt; razor, cloak of flames, badass rogue by all accounts.  obviously not a<br/>
huge<br/>
&gt; amount of hit points, but a massive damage dealer.  and i have full hate<br/>
&gt; armor and weps, for comparison.  anyway, i never thought to play warsong.<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; played VoV instead.  being level 50 he resisted a lot of songs i tried to<br/>
&gt; hit him with, so i stuck to buffing myself.  when cessation or chains did<br/>
&gt; hit him tho, he was noticeably slower, but even with only 45 MR, just<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; level 50 he resisted too much to help.  first tried instrument only<br/>
attack,<br/>
&gt; but like i said he resisted too much.  second i played VoV/Niv&#39;s and tried<br/>
&gt; to slow him, again he resisted but i won with 36hp left.  third time he<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; some lucky backstabs in, and he also got too close when i dirged and i hit<br/>
&gt; us both.  4th time was the best, i played VoV/Niv&#39;s and with psalm of<br/>
&gt; cooling he tore himself up on the dmg shield.  won with 246 hp left.<br/>
also,<br/>
&gt; i have joined the AC bandwagon.  still have my 4 primary stats over 100<br/>
(str<br/>
&gt; 130, dex 117, agi 110, cha 113) and i hit 801 AC and 1314 hp unbuffed.<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; can i say i&#39;m a tank in a bard&#39;s body.<br/>

&gt; &gt; - Yes, you can use Chain and Warsong to get an equivalent to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; 56% haste (1.3*1.2) relative to the mob.<br/>
