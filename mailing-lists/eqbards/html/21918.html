the loot system is under DKP System on the left.  The Current Standings are,<br/>
well, current.  the ideas in the Explanation are basically up-to-date,<br/>
though rather than pre-kunark mobs that it lists now it is Trak, VS, the 3<br/>
outdoor dragons, epic weapon quest mobs, and some PoS stuff.  but the Values<br/>
page is way way way out-of-date (all pre-kunark items listed there).  the<br/>
best way to see what current item values are is on the current standings<br/>
under some players (i.e. kunark class armor BP=20, legs=15, epic weapon=20,<br/>
etc.).  old DKP values were set values.  now they are usually the same<br/>
(Trak=1, VS=0.8, Talendor=0.5, etc.) but can vary based on how many people<br/>
are on the raid and the total value of what drops.  e.g. if VS drops 2 legs<br/>
it is probably 0.8 per person, if he drops 2 staffs it may be 0.5.<br/>
<br/>
oh well i am getting too detailed, basically most of the new stuff is<br/>
determined by the officers and known by the guild, so this stuff may be<br/>
out-of-date but if you have any questions you can e-mail me.<br/>
