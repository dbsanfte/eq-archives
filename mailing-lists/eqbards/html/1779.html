&gt; Maybe if more people would read the posts instead of just rising to defend<br/>
&gt; their character we would get a lot more intelligent conversation instead of<br/>
&gt; flames!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I said before all the flames &quot;Whether or not bards can ultimately wear<br/>
&gt; plate or not is moot to me, it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard so I won&#39;t&quot;<br/>
&gt; was that too difficult for you to understand???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not once did I ask that Verant remove this ability, in fact I quite clearly<br/>
&gt; stated I don&#39;t care if they remove it or not.  I choose not to wear plate<br/>
&gt; because it doesn&#39;t fit my role-playing image of a bard, period.  I also<br/>
&gt; agree with the previous post where not one person has given a valid<br/>
&gt; role-playing reason for wearing plate as a bard, although I think there are<br/>
&gt; some, but those are not the kind of posts we are seeing.  Instead we see<br/>
&gt; more, &quot;Oh yeah but...&quot; type of posts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heaven forbid someone should make your character weaker in order to further<br/>
&gt; atmosphere or enhance the storyline.  In fact if all characters could do<br/>
&gt; everything we&#39;d all be perfectly balanced, and perfectly boring.  Flame<br/>
&gt; away, since apparently it is all some of you are capable of.<br/>

&gt;        and no one shall work for fame&quot;<br/>
&gt;      &quot;but each for the joy of the working,<br/>
&gt;         and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>
