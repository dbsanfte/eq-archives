&gt;glowing crook staff. the dirk is 6/23 which works out <br/>
&gt;to a ratio of .565 using max damage of 13, the &#39;Glower&#39; <br/>
&gt;as I hear called frequently is 11/35 which means a hefty <br/>
&gt;ratio of .657, very painful.  The BLW is even worse than <br/>
&gt;a dirk at 7/28 which works out to a ratio of only .536 <br/>
&gt;using max damage.  A full point of better ratio is pretty <br/>
&gt;devastating in a one-on-one fight.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How can I put this...  You are wrong.  Dead wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Listen and you may learn something.<br/>
<br/>
There is a thing in EQ called skill.  If a druid could<br/>
wield SSotY, or a Fanged Stilleto (god forbid) they would<br/>
still lose _badly_.<br/>
<br/>
with my 6/22 axe and 6/23 dirk, maximum damage at my level<br/>
is 22 dmg for each.  And I average 19 or 20.  And get this...<br/>
I have (5 * level) + 5 melee capability, druids have what?<br/>
(4 * level) + 5?  bah...<br/>
<br/>
Bards would _cream_ a druid/shaman in melee.  It has nothing<br/>
to do with ratios or statistics.  Druids cannot hit anything.<br/>
<br/>
I watch three druids try to beat up an ice bone skeleton just<br/>
with melee, and it took like 20 seconds.  That was laughable.<br/>
<br/>
miss, miss, miss, crush 18, miss, miss, miss, crush 5, miss...<br/>
<br/>
Bards over level 30, consistantly dual wield.  But since I don&#39;t<br/>
have any proof in hard facts, I will duel a similar level druid<br/>
tonight and post melee combat results for all to see.  Maybe then<br/>
we can shutdown this silly debate, about clerics/druids/shaman<br/>
being able to out-melee bards???  I need the stuff you&#39;re on man.<br/>
hehehe<br/>
