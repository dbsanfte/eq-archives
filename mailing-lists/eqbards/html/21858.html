&gt; &gt; Have you noticed whether other 50+ people in your guild(s) also drop off?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hearing whether it was out of Verant&#39;s responses that they decided to<br/>
&gt; &gt; switch classes would help back up your argument, as it seems to me that at<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher levels EQ is different from your standard gameplay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve lost other 50+ players, as 50+ is mindnumbingly tedious at times,<br/>
&gt;but in their case, they&#39;ve quit, not taken over other characters and<br/>
&gt;continued playing.  Where do you think the characters the 3 bards I<br/>
&gt;mentioned play now came from? :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ugh, maybe it&#39;s my cold, or maybe just really tired at work, but &quot;Where do <br/>
you think the 3 bards you mentioned play now came from?&quot; isn&#39;t registering. <br/>
You&#39;re saying the 3 other bards took over and played the abandoned 50+ <br/>
level players. Ah. Ok, that made sense.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, aren&#39;t these types of players typically worse than the one that <br/>
brought them up from level 1? I mean you get the &quot;ebay&quot; twinks that have no <br/>
idea what they&#39;re doing and get everyone killed. Then again, at least in a <br/>
a guild they&#39;d have more support from a group overall.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In effect, 3 of the bards I mentioned haven&#39;t said they&#39;re tired of the<br/>
&gt;game, they&#39;ve said they&#39;re tired of playing bards. I can&#39;t think of any<br/>
&gt;50+ member of my guild that&#39;s left to play another character. Oops, just<br/>
&gt;remembered one paladin that left to start a cleric on another Torv. If<br/>
&gt;he&#39;d stuck around he probably could have taken over a cleric account<br/>
&gt;from one of those that left.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could it be that level 50+ bards are no fun to play given the environment <br/>
that they are in? If so, maybe the level 49 song could be an improved <br/>
version of AOE mez. I know, a pipe dream. :-)</div>
