&gt;<br/>
&gt;  For those quick browsers of messages, here is my warning.  I used the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>first<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;level attack song alternating it mainly with the level 2 buff song when<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fighting<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;in and around my home town of Kelethin.  Occasionally, when I run back to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>town<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(NEVER still singing my attack song), a guard will kill me for no apparent<br/>
&gt;reason.  Maybe it thinks I attacked another PC if he or she happened to run<br/>

 </span></blockquote>though I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>except<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for my guild of course.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Anyway, on to my question.  How much does a diety effect your actual<br/>
 </span></blockquote>abilities<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and inter-race relations?  I play a Wood Elf bard, and have enjoyed it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>immensly,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;but chose my diety as Tunare for fear of fraction problems.  I roleplay my<br/>
&gt;character as a romantic, so naturally Erolisi Marr (sp?) seems like a good<br/>
&gt;choice, but I am unsure of it&#39;s effects on others.  Would love to hear from<br/>
&gt;another bard who has tried more than one diety perhaps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Laeaus, Wood Elf Bard level...(sigh)...3<br/>
