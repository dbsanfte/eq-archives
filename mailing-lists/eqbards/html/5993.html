<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313713982"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Didn&#39;t someone on this list fall victim to the infamous wcommons/befallen<br/>
&gt;&#39;cat room&#39; bug?  I was wondering how one could get into that room.  I have<br/>
&gt;seen screenshots of it, and of Befallen using the Eye of Zomm, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;recall anyone saying how they got stuck in there.  The screenshot I<br/>

&gt;any more info on this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whenever you overstep a zone line (like the zone load doesn&#39;t trigger<br/>
because of lag or because of some other bug) you end up in an &#39;otherwold&#39;<br/>
space, which is just some overlap created by the game programmers that<br/>
you&#39;re not supposed to see. All you need to do is run back to where the zone<br/>
should have been, and you will zone again, back out to where you wanted to<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
The cat room seems to be only in some of the areas around Freeport (like<br/>
Commons and Befallen) whereas other zones just have a continuation of the<br/>
zone which appears similar to the zone itself, but often ends in a strange<br/>
non-space (like a buggy sky).<br/>
<br/>
The bad thing is, sometimes monsters WILL chase you back there, and you WILL<br/>
die. This happened to me in Mistmoore, and I could see my corpse behind the<br/>
zone line, but I couldn&#39;t /corpse it closer to me, and whenever I tried to<br/>
walk to it I would just zone. :P Had to get a GM to pull it out.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here are some screenshots:<br/>
