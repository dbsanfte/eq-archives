<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237976771">An update on my goal of getting Screech.  Had my first non-positive xp nite<br/>
in RoK last nite.  I have hereafter sworn off Battle Clerics forever!<br/>
Here&#39;s how it came down in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
<br/>
We got jumped by three goblins, a Spirit Caller (White to me) and two<br/>
Warlords (both Blue).  The party was me (lvl 25 Bard), Dronach (lvl 30<br/>
shaman), and Banestrike (lvl 26 cleric).  Should have been a piece of cake<br/>
since I can take any of these three mobs solo.  They immediately took a<br/>
dislike to the shaman and started beating on him.  I was swinging away so he<br/>
tried to back off to let them center on me.  The cleric spent the whole<br/>
fight running around trying to melee the stupid goblins while the shaman<br/>
tried to back out numerous times.  The shaman died as a result of getting no<br/>
heals from our &quot;Battle Cleric&quot; who had several spells interupted solely<br/>
because he would not stay still.<br/>
<br/>
When Dronach fell, the cleric decided to flee despite being at nearly full<br/>
mana and me Rooted, and ran off in the wrong direction.  Needless to say I<br/>
died.  He had enough mana to Smite/Strike/Whatever one of the Warlords to<br/>
death, but the second Warlord killed him as he ran away.  He was so clueless<br/>
he ran from the far east Mine entrance to the Pavement of West Cabilis... by<br/>
way of the Sarnak Fortress!  Dronach offered to help him get his corpse<br/>
since he had already recovered his and knew I could get mine ok.  The stupid<br/>
cleric proceeded to lead him to the Goblin Stronghold entrance thinking he<br/>
died near there and promptly Gated &quot;accidentally&quot; when they were jumped by<br/>
the Spirit Caller and remaining Warlord.  Dronach being Rooted was killed a<br/>
second time.  After the cleric described the body location, Dronach led him<br/>
that way to get it back and the cleric blundered into a building full of<br/>
goblins and promptly died again.  At that point Dronach wisely just invised<br/>
and dragged the corpse to the zoneline.<br/>
<br/>
Word to the wise.  Having a stupid cleric is worse than having no cleric.<br/>

Sorry Kit, off hand I dont recognize that shield.  Now for fear chain stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, like vintage wine - all bard songs tend to get better with some<br/>
age.  Song effect is tested against level difference - when you first get<br/>
songs - resists are high.  Also missed notes if the underlying skill is not<br/>
maxxed and screetch is brass - make sure your brass is maxxed to the level.<br/>
<br/>
Screetch when it sticks and does not end early lasts 3 ticks.  Ideally you<br/>
could:<br/>
<br/>
fear (mob runs)<br/>
chain (mob slows)<br/>
warsong (you hasten)<br/>
<br/>
fear (mob runs)<br/>
chain (mob slows)<br/>
warsong (you hasten)<br/>
(rinse, repeat)<br/>
<br/>
When it is feared, it does not hit you.  Come up behind a mob.  Fear it.  If<br/>
you fear does not stick on the first try, it will turn and hit you. Keep<br/>
fearing it until it runs. Then chain it. Then buff yourself. Then right away<br/>
fear it again. Or skip the buff and do fear/chain only and you will have a<br/>
second try if fear is resisted once it sticks.  If you get a resist, keep<br/>
fearing until it sticks.<br/>
<br/>
Fresh songs with high resist rates can be painfull so try it on the weakest<br/>
stuff you can find and expect it ti get better as you add levels.  I got<br/>
poor results when I first got the song and put it away for many levels.<br/>
Then in my mid-30&#39;s I tried it again and got excellent results.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to hook up with a ranger or a druid who can stick snare on<br/>
the mob.  Then you can fear until it sticks then melee buff.<br/>
<br/>
In practice, find a good open area and pull your mobs here (if they are not<br/>
there already).  It&#39;s better to have them run over known safe ground that<br/>
run into places you are not sure of.  Also, you need to be very close to the<br/>
mob.  Yes, it is AE but smaller radius than you may think and Kunark mobs<br/>
have large melee ranges - so you need to get up close and personal to play<br/>
the song.  That&#39;s why if you can start from behind and get fear in first,<br/>
you are one step ahead of things.  If you have to pull, then chain so they<br/>
hit you slower while you try to stick that first fear on an agro mob.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and let us know how you fare,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Our two main weapons are Selo&#39;s, Chains, and Screech... Our three main<br/>
&gt; weapons...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But seriously, I expect to get Screech tonite and was hoping to get some<br/>
&gt; better understanding of how I might put Screech and Chains to work in the<br/>
&gt; wide open expanses of Lake of Ill Omen and The Overthere.  Perhaps some of<br/>
&gt; the more experienced bards can shed some light on this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
