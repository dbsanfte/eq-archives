&gt;all it requires is time.  To get the gauntlets you have to kill...<br/>
&gt;Babbinsbort, please.  I have already killed him twice at 21st level in a<br/>
&gt;group where I was the highest level there at 20.  Greaves, kill Maugrim.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Babbinsbort or his placeholder spawns every 7.5 hours.  A cleric friend of <br/>
mine made sure that he was at that spawn point every 7.5 hours for 2 weeks <br/>
before he finally spawned. That NPC has been seen on our server exactly 2 <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
Bilge in the Cauldron has been seen once on our server.<br/>
<br/>
3 days of solid camping on that island in OOT yielded that stupid bird.<br/>
<br/>
We killed enough griffennes to get 4 charms in north karana, and in the time <br/>
it took to do that never saw Zahal.<br/>
<br/>
The cleric quests are almost impossible not because of the level of NPC <br/>
required to kill them but because of the rarity of the NPC&#39;s that carry the <br/>
items required.<br/>
<br/>
So far the longest I&#39;ve specifically camped an item was the icy greaves. <br/>
That took 2 and a half hours.  So far my cleric has spent at least 4 hours <br/>
on each of the items required for his armor.  I don&#39;t envy the clerics for <br/>
this quest, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily my cleric friend has pretty much given up on the quests and doesn&#39;t <br/>
bitch about it non stop anymore. He&#39;s not even going to try to get the <br/>
breastplate, the one piece he can&#39;t get because Bilge won&#39;t spawn, and he&#39;s <br/>
given up on the bracers because that stupid ghoul in NK won&#39;t spawn either.<br/>
