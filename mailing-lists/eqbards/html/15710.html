<div id="ygrps-yiv-469568045">I use it when I&#39;m familiar with the area.  And yes, in LGuk, I am of the<br/>
opinion that on the rare chance you do hit something outside the immediate<br/>
area, that&#39;s just one more mob for your group (asuming someone doesn&#39;t grab<br/>
it as it&#39;s pathing to you.)<br/>
<br/>
The Assassin&#39;s room I might avoid, since there are other multi-levels there.<br/>
But that area (garg area to savant room to cavalier room to the area just<br/>
below the garg area) would be the only place I would think twice about using<br/>
an ae song in an overpopulated lguk.<br/>
