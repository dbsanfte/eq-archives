<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836858790">So how does everyone else manage to juggling instruments/weapons and<br/>
not drop something on the ground?  I just lost a fine steel spear,<br/>
which I spent most of my bank account on (money isn&#39;t exactly prolific<br/>
at level 8).  Tried to shout and see if someone would return it, but<br/>
alas to no avail.  Yes I&#39;m using the inventory-as-hotkey method.  I<br/>
have no problem juggling 2-3 songs, but trying to switch instruments<br/>
is a serious PITA with the risk of dropping something.<br/>
