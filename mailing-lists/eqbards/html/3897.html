&gt;Kind of off-topic, but I know all our human and half-elf<br/>
&gt;compatriots are eagerly looking for this stuff.  We got our<br/>
&gt;first piece of medium bronze last night.  It was off a L25<br/>
&gt;goblin we pulled from deep in the cave system past the<br/>
&gt;Archeologist.  That would put it at roughly the same level as<br/>
&gt;the dry bones and nobles that most often drop small bronze in<br/>
&gt;Unrest; except that everything trains in Permafrost and you<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t use Accelerando/SoW, thus requiring a much higher level<br/>
&gt;group to survive there, much less get this stuff.<br/>

Ok, that;s enough space....<br/>
Our group has been finding Medium Bronze by the boat-load in Solusek B.<br/>
Oh, yeah, sure, it can be a nasty dungeon, but here&#39;s a few ideas.<br/>
<br/>
1. We have found that medium bronze in Sol B is just as plentiful as Small<br/>
Bronze is in Unrest. I collected 5 pieces of Medium Bronze in less than 2<br/>
hours!<br/>
<br/>
2. Who carries it? Just about any Kobold.<br/>
<br/>
3. Sol B, right near the entry. Camp there with your group. Right around the<br/>
corner, start luring Kobolds, one at a time. A group of mid 20&#39;s with at<br/>
least once cleric SHOULD be able to handle a single kobold. If things get<br/>
hairy, you are RIGHT by the zone.<br/>
<br/>
4. Whether they do or do not have bronze on them, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
5. Season to taste. I just ended up giving 4 of those pieces away to fellow<br/>
bards who require medium armor. Who says you can&#39;t have Christmas in July?<br/>
