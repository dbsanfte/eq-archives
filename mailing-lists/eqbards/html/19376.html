<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-51607246">Its not a problem with SoW.  This illusion has been around since early Beta.<br/>
It has a lot to do with texture sizes.  Some areas of the game have very<br/>
large textures, which, because they&#39;re not as tightly packed, will give you<br/>
the illusion of moving slower.  Kind of like if you are in a car and look<br/>
down at the dotted lines RIGHT beside the car will seem like they&#39;re flying<br/>
by at mach 10 but if you look ahead of the car a bit they will look much<br/>
slower.<br/>
<br/>
If you play a large race (ogre/troll/barb) you will also notice that they<br/>
seem slower than smaller races (from perspective) but still seem to manage<br/>
to keep up.  It&#39;s a perspective thing and an illusion caused by texture<br/>
sizes.  Nothing is wrong with our song or SoW.  The easiest/fastest way to<br/>
confirm is to find a druid running around with SoW and blow his doors off.<br/>
Restores my confidence every time ;)<br/>
<br/>
Luck and may your voice never fail!<br/>
