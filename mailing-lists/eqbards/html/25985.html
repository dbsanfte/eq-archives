<div id="ygrps-yiv-995553770">Hi all,<br/>
I am returning to Norrath after a looong break.<br/>
I just bought Luclin and is in desperate need of equipment upgrades. I plan<br/>
to try and dump some of my junk at the bazaar, but need some advice on what<br/>
to buy and what to pay :)<br/>
<br/>
My standard gear is as follows:<br/>
- Singing steel boots<br/>
- Singing steel Gauntlets<br/>
- Sleeves of the Ancient<br/>
- Lambent BreastPlate<br/>
- Lambent Greaves<br/>
- 2x Opaline Earrings<br/>
- 2x Velium fire wedding rings<br/>
- Guardian helmet<br/>
- Spider fur coat<br/>
- Troll Hide belt<br/>
- Orc Fang necklace<br/>
Weapons:<br/>
- Journey mans walking stick<br/>
- Icepaw war claw<br/>
- Sarnak Skull splitter<br/>
- Smoldering brand<br/>
<br/>
I have a bunch of junk to sell apart from the above mentioned thigns and<br/>
around 1700pp in cash.. I think I maybe can raise 3000pp if Im lucky :/<br/>
Any suggestions for what to upgrade and what to pay for the upgrades will be<br/>
greatly appriciated..<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m still around but took the last 2 weeks off for back to school and<br/>
&gt; various other stuff. My plan was to get everything around the <br/>
&gt; house caught<br/>
&gt; up and maybe a bit ahead before PoP, but now it looks like I <br/>
&gt; will need to<br/>
&gt; get back on the raid horse. I really don&#39;t care for raid <br/>
&gt; level stuff, all<br/>
&gt; hurry up and wait. Plus I finally got a new job and have to log at a<br/>
&gt; reasonable hour. Being on EST, that means I have to go about <br/>
&gt; the time we get<br/>
&gt; really started in VT or wherever. Songs are the only thing I <br/>
&gt; care about<br/>
&gt; having though so it&#39;s back to grind, I suppose.<br/>
