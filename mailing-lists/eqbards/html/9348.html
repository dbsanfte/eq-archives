<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884322916">Thanks for the advice. I think the best strategy is to only use this song in<br/>
groups I know. I&#39;ll skip it in pickup groups for now, unless someone asks,<br/>
or it&#39;s obvious they use /assist properly.<br/>

&gt; Is there an echo in here?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wrote this PRECISE same message at your level - complete with saying I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; all but given up on teaching people to work with this song correctly.  Now<br/>
&gt; at level 28 I find that almost every competent group that I join (maybe 7<br/>
&gt; out of 10 of them) works this way without being instructed to, and better<br/>
&gt; yet, most are now familiar with spells like Lullaby or the Enchanter&#39;s AE<br/>
&gt; Mesmerization.  Yes, there are still groups that don&#39;t understand Lullaby<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; my level, but they&#39;re typically much more open to listening to and<br/>
following<br/>
&gt; my suggestions.  My frustration at your level was the same - I&#39;d instruct<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; group and they&#39;d either ask me who made me God or ignore me altogether.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bards are second only to Enchanters for crowd control.  Even your beefy<br/>
&gt; Troll and Ogre buddies are going to watch their life drain away with a<br/>
bunch<br/>
&gt; of blue and green mobs smacking on them.  A few startlingly fast deaths in<br/>
&gt; Permafrost, Runnyeye or Guk and your friends will be all ears when you say<br/>
&gt; you can do crowd control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t give up.  Keep explaining it to your groups so that they&#39;ll know how<br/>
&gt; things work 10 levels from now.  It will pay off in a few levels when the<br/>
&gt; tanks realize that their massive HPs only go so far, and the casters<br/>
realize<br/>
&gt; how frighteningly fragile they are when the blue bar is heading South.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve almost given up on trying to perfect this (Lullaby) with<br/>
&gt; &gt; pickup groups<br/>
&gt; &gt; at my level (16-19). Either nobody understands /assist, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t trust my<br/>
&gt; &gt; lullaby to work, or they just plain don&#39;t listen. After one<br/>
&gt; &gt; nightmarish pull<br/>
&gt; &gt; (&quot;A Orc Warrior&quot;s and Priests along the west side of Oasis) in<br/>
&gt; &gt; which I died<br/>
&gt; &gt; because nobody would let my mobs sleep, I pulled out the virtual<br/>
&gt; &gt; chalkboard<br/>
&gt; &gt; and went though it step-by-step:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) I type MEZ<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) Everyone /assist the puller<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3) Stay on one target until it is dead.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4) Healer watch my health as all the other baddies pound on me<br/>
&gt; &gt; between naps<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Everyone said OK. The very next nasty pull I typed MEZ and watched as<br/>
&gt; &gt; everybody chose their favorite Orc and nobody assisted the puller. It<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; late so I said my goodbyes and shuffled home. I think it will take a<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation where this song noticeably saves lives before people will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; convinced. Next time I try it I&#39;m going to make sure to Selo out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of there if<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see a lot of /assisting going on. It only hurts the bard to stay<br/>
&gt; &gt; cause the mobs aren&#39;t going to leave him alone when they&#39;re awake.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The evening was fun and the xp was good, but I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>
&gt; &gt; graduating to more mature groups where satisfaction comes from watching<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good plan come together, rather than marvelling that we didn&#39;t die when<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; &gt; deserved to.<br/>

&gt; &gt; p.s. Who decided that non-SoW&#39;d trolls make good pullers? The ten<br/>
minutes<br/>
&gt; &gt; ours was away selling I pulled and we killed twice as many mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt; with little<br/>
&gt; &gt; downtime.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; This simple tactic seems to be the hardest think for hybrid tanks to<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen even mid 30&#39;s (typically in HK where it is after all<br/>
&quot;safe&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you don&#39;t have to be really skilled to survive) not follow this really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; simple yet effective proceedure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It works!  It really, really works!<br/>
