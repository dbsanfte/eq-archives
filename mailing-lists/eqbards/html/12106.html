<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892382776">How is this evidence of &quot;bard hate&quot; at all?  Gordon said two things:<br/>
1.  Druids won&#39;t be able to track better than Bards.<br/>
2.  Bard&#39;s tracking cap is too high, but won&#39;t be changed (i.e. No Nerf).<br/>
<br/>
If you think this is an example of &quot;bard hate&quot; then I&#39;d think you are too<br/>
paranoid and just looking for any chance to slam Verant.<br/>

&gt; More evidence that &quot;bard hate&quot; is alive and well - unfortunately it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; game designers and not monsters:<br/>

&gt; I am beginning to wonder if _anyone_ at Verant has played chars thru level<br/>
&gt; 50 - start to finish like regular players do?  From what perspective are<br/>
&gt; they getting these _endless_ visions of &quot;class balancing&quot; needs.  And ya,<br/>
