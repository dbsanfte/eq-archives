&gt; &gt;This happened to me a while back while killing Dervs in NRo.  But<br/>
&gt; &gt;I stayed unconscious long enough for my friends to re-appear back<br/>
&gt; &gt;in Freeport and run back to the camp!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I too have experienced this dream state, where my unconscious body continued <br/>
&gt; the Hymn of Restoration as I lay prostrate.  I had been poisoned by a giant <br/>
&gt; spider and collapsed as I looted it&#39;s corpse.  Twice I stood up, only to <br/>
&gt; fall again as poison and hymn battled with each other.  Hymn won out, and I <br/>
&gt; limped back to the nearest guard to regain my strength.  Just another one of <br/>
&gt; those EQ magic moments!<br/>

the above really should be /bugged.<br/>
<br/>
Just make sure you mention that magical weapon effects<br/>
(screaming mace, polished granite tomahawks) screw up our<br/>
songs in the same /bug form.  :-)<br/>
