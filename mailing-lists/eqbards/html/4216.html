 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see any problem with using words/acronyms that are common<br/>
knowledge in-game, when out of game and talking about the game. Very very<br/>
very few people don&#39;t know what RTS is. If they don&#39;t, they&#39;re gonna learn<br/>
pretty fast when playing. Therefore I consider it common knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
In my book, it&#39;s the same as acting as if it&#39;s bad for me to say &#39;the<br/>
ranger guild&#39;. Someone out there, somewhere, might not know that the<br/>
ranger guild is in Surefall and Kelethin. So therefore, according to the<br/>
no-acronyms logic, I should explain the locations of them since someone<br/>
might know them.<br/>
<br/>
And when you get into explaining everything because someone somewhere<br/>
might not know it..<br/>
