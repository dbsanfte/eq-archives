<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494933402">I can&#39;t play until this weekend so if someone has the time here is something<br/>
to check out.<br/>
<br/>
In GZ&#39;s response to Rokenn&#39;s letter, he said he would check into our reports<br/>
that equipping a drum had no effect when singing the Chant series of songs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t mentioned in the patch message but maybe this got fixed.  Could we<br/>
test this by singing Furfil&#39;s Curtailing Chant against ourselves?  If it got<br/>
fixed, equipping a drum should increase the amount of the DOT and the amount<br/>
of MR lost.<br/>
