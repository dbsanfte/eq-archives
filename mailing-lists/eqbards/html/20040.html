<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-350217417">Well, I pulled out Lucid Lullaby again last nite to see if anything had<br/>
changed.  Initially I thought maybe it had been fixed since I was getting<br/>
fewer resists than I remembered against some low blues.<br/>
<br/>
I put on my tester&#39;s goggles after the fighting and headed over to the<br/>
newbie area for some more quantifiable testing.  Here&#39;s the results,<br/>
obviously it isn&#39;t fixed, sigh.<br/>
<br/>
At 90 Charisma vs lvl 1-5 mobs (25+ lvl diff)<br/>
1230 	pulses<br/>
47	total resists<br/>
3.8%	resist rate<br/>
1183	unresisted pulses<br/>
399	secondary resists<br/>
33.7%	secondary resist rate<br/>
36.3%	total resist rate<br/>
<br/>
At 125 Charisma vs lvl 1-5 mobs (25+ lvl diff)<br/>
795	pulses<br/>
21	total resists<br/>
2.6%	resist rate<br/>
774	unresisted pulses<br/>
274	secondary resists<br/>
35.4%	secondary resist rate<br/>
37.1%	total resist rate<br/>
<br/>
At 125 Charisma vs lvl 20-23 mobs (7-10 lvl diff)<br/>
853	pulses<br/>
43	total resists<br/>
5.1%	resist rate<br/>
810	unresisted pulses<br/>
279	secondary resists<br/>
34.4%	secondary resist rate<br/>
37.8%	total resist rate<br/>
<br/>
From these stats it would appear that one of the following theoretical<br/>
scenarios is occurring.<br/>
<br/>
1.	Charisma has no effect on the secondary resist rate, nor does level.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Level has no effect on secondary resist rate, but charisma<br/>
negatively affects it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d lean towards number one being the solution.  My guess is that nothing is<br/>
affecting that secondary resist rate so it stays constant at around 35%.<br/>
The primary resist decreases normally with increased charisma and level.<br/>
The result of this is that the resist rate on the song can never fall below<br/>
35% and on mobs you are fighting for xp will likely be closer to 50%.  This<br/>
made the song useful for keeping a horde of ridiculously green mobs mezzed,<br/>
but was not sufficient to control even two mobs that were high blues.<br/>
