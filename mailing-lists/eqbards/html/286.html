<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117495012">I have no affiliation to said guild nor have I met any of it&#39;s members, nor<br/>
have I met any of the members of this list.  I have nothing against said<br/>
guild, said guild will succeed and prosper without my intervention, I&#39;m<br/>
sure.  I have nothing against the members of said guild, I am sure they hold<br/>
up to the honor and code of their guild.  As I posted earlier, I do take<br/>
exception to one post by one member of said guild.  I do not take this to<br/>
represent the ways and means of said guild, but the attitude of said member.<br/>
I find posts from said guild to be very informative, and I am thankful for<br/>
that information.  As I am thankful for the humor and insight and &quot;good<br/>
deductive logic&quot; put forth by all those who chose to post.  I am also<br/>
thankful for the &quot;POOR deductive logic&quot; put forth by those who chose to<br/>
post, as well, as when they post, it raises a topic for discussion that<br/>
those with the knowledge and the means might not have thought about.  Then,<br/>
it is time to nicely, correct this misinformation.  Not to slam those<br/>
posting.  Should anyone posting have to think twice about how they word<br/>
their statement with the worry of being called one using &quot;poor deductive<br/>
logic&quot;?  I did not know this was a place where one would have to double<br/>
check how they &quot;WORD&quot; the truth as they know it.  If it&#39;s wrong, so be it.<br/>
To tell someone they are wrong, without telling them what is correct is just<br/>
plain mean.  It&#39;s arrogant and selfish, and I don&#39;t care for such behavior.<br/>
My statements were directed at one post, not at the guild to which that<br/>
poster belonged.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and everyone will<br/>
see the EXACT same situation a little differently, for there are 3 sides to<br/>
every story, yours, mine, and the truth.  Truth being for which I am in<br/>
constant search.<br/>

&gt;member, i still think that the opinions put forth ford and greg are<br/>
&gt;not fit to print.  this is an information source not a general gripe<br/>
&gt;board.  please let the rest of us make up out minds about people when<br/>
&gt;we meet them. i am a journalist in that other realm known as earth<br/>
&gt;and what you wrote would there be called libel.  please be civil my<br/>
&gt;brothers.  we are all here to have fun.<br/>

&gt;Well written friend. I also hold no affilliation to said guild nor<br/>
&gt;have I met any of it&#39;s members, yet I have found their information<br/>
&gt;and input on this board to be helpfull, fair, and honorable. From<br/>
&gt;what I have read in the way of complaints against these brothers and<br/>
&gt;sisters, most are petty and malicious. Personally, if someone<br/>
&gt;&quot;slapped&quot; me I would probably question the provoking party rather<br/>
&gt;than attacking outright, but that notwithstanding the comments made<br/>
&gt;sound more like a grudge for having lost a battle that the &quot;slapper&quot;<br/>
&gt;provoked rather than an unbiased evaluation of the guild or it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;members.<br/>
