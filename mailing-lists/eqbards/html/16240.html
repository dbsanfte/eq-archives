<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Bard drum graphic <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-493593690">I made a post on the Kunark General boards asking if the bard drum <br/>
graphic, which i now believe never existed ( they had stated it was some bug <br/>
or somesuch ) would be fixed.Brad stated that it will most likely not be <br/>
fixed in the expansion. They already stated that it was too large a file to <br/>
patch, being a graphics file, so i thought for sure they would put it in the <br/>
expansion, but now, no. bah.... Seems so silly to me, ooh look the trees <br/>
sway, the textures are amazing, the creatures and new weapons are <br/>
fantanstic.....but wait , i&#39;m still strumming a stick. kinda detracts from <br/>
the whole magic of it for me . here is the link -<br/>
