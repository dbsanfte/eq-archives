<div id="ygrps-yiv-219466069">aye, same here hehe.  that&#39;s why i didn&#39;t say the name of what dropped it.<br/>
everyone knows it&#39;s in trakonon by now anyway.  i also heard it&#39;s not a<br/>
whole lot of exp during this camp, which is really making me avoid it for<br/>
the time being.  i don&#39;t get to play all that much, so i want to exp when i<br/>
can.<br/>
