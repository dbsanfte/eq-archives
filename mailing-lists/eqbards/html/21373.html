the bard worked in EQ is gone and they have no design doc to work from,<br/>
and no one left there has a clue what the intent and vision was for the<br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any other explanation for the past 2 years. Even the lack of<br/>
bard songs past 20 in beta 4 makes me think that no one thought out the<br/>
bard&#39;s role past that level very seriously.<br/>
