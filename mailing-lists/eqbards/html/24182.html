<div id="ygrps-yiv-125220071">i think that is where a lot of our experiences differ, since i am rarely<br/>
fighting normal mobs anymore.  most of my experience in 58 has been on mobs<br/>
that double for 190s and are magic (root) immune.  and the uber stuff hits<br/>
for insane amounts of damage.  stepping away may help, but i see mobs<br/>
turning off me right away as soon as Song of Dawn pulses all the time.  i<br/>
see mobs that no one else has even aggro&#39;d turn off me when i pulse it.<br/>
it&#39;s a nice song that works well and i find a lot of use out of it.  now if<br/>
i feel the need for something more important, i&#39;ll got with it.  Song of<br/>
Dawn is in one of my often-changed song slots, but i do have it memmed a<br/>
lot.<br/>

&gt; snare stacking, all you need to do is root a mob and it will <br/>
&gt; go for the nearest pc instead<br/>
&gt; of the pc highest on the hate list. </span></blockquote></div>
