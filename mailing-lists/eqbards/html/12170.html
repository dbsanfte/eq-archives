For one, in a very recent post one of the Verant guys (I forgot which<br/>
one) said our fizzle rate (missed note I assume) is based on dex and<br/>
CHA.  Also most tests I have seen indicate Dex is a factor in your melee<br/>
ability. (With non-proc weapons).  I have never done one of these tests<br/>
myself.  If you have the time simply make two lvl 1 warriors.  Only<br/>
fight 1 newbie mob (say bat or something).  Give one all dex, give the<br/>
other all something useless like cha. Use the log thingy and see how<br/>
often both hit and their ave damage.<br/>
