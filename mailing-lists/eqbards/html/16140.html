<div id="ygrps-yiv-82213">What item were you referring to?  Try this.  Take<br/>
everything off and note your ac.  Put on the item and<br/>
note your ac.  Now repeate with a level 1 of your<br/>
class/race.  You&#39;ll get the same ac boost.  When I<br/>
tested I took a partial set of bronze I had laying<br/>
around and levelled a warrior from 1 to 15 and then<br/>
checked again with a 19 warrior and a 27 warrior IIRC<br/>
and everyone got the exact same benefit from a fixed<br/>
set of armor.  I&#39;ve also tested other things like<br/>
silver jacinth rings on level 50&#39;s down to a level 19.<br/>
 I have yet to find a level or skill based difference<br/>
for a given piece or pieces of equipment.<br/>

No, something besides just the item determines it&#39;s<br/>
effectiveness.  Because the same 5ac item has gone<br/>
from (at level 10) roughly 7AC value to over 12 AC<br/>
Value at level 34.<br/>
<br/>
Something is causing it to be &#39;worth&#39; more at higher<br/>
levels.  Whether it be level dependent or skill<br/>
(defense maybe?) dependent, I have not determined.<br/>
But there is definitely something making armor<br/>
&quot;Better&quot; as you grow.<br/>
