<div id="ygrps-yiv-858954103">Aye.  Sadly I was grouped with a group of casters and tanks the other night<br/>
killing Seafury Cyclops.  The rogue in our group just *would not* lay off<br/>
the Backstab button.  He was routinely getting pounded by the clops<br/>
significantly worse than the rest of us, and the problem was that *I* was<br/>
the primary healer.  So after a fight the rogue would be at two bubbles of<br/>
health and the rest of us are down maybe one at most.  So now the whole<br/>
group is waiting several minutes on the rogue to heal after fights.  So as<br/>
politely as I know how I asked him to maybe not BS anymore - of course he<br/>
got pissed that I was telling him how to run his class.  /sigh<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have to agree with Athren.  A player (of any type) who jumps<br/>
&gt; into battle with<br/>
&gt; guns a-blazin&#39; and doesn&#39;t know when to back off is one of the<br/>
&gt; more annoying<br/>
&gt; player types to have to group with.  This is particularly true in<br/>
&gt; any party with<br/>
&gt; a healing shortage.  By judiciously backing out when I start to<br/>
&gt; attract too much<br/>
&gt; attention, I&#39;ve cut my personal death rate enormously (5 in six<br/>
&gt; levels, all due<br/>
&gt; to other groups&#39; trains), which, IMHO, is a big benefit to any<br/>
&gt; party.  If they<br/>
&gt; have to try to continue without me, or wait for me to return,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a lot worse<br/>
&gt; for them than getting a bit less assistance from me in any one<br/>
&gt; particular fight.<br/>
&gt;  (And it&#39;s more fun for me, too.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve also learned to make more liberal use of:<br/>
&gt; /g RUN<br/>
&gt; &lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;shift-up&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those &quot;glorious&quot;<br/>
&gt; everyone-down-to-one-bubble-surrounded-by-a-pile-of-dead-MOBs<br/>
&gt; fights do not make up for the far more frequent 2-people-deads.<br/>
