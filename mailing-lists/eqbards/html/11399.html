<div id="ygrps-yiv-892249834">I noticed yesterday that a lot of you higher level folks have the skull<br/>
shaped barbute and I am aware of the fact that it drops from the ghoul lord<br/>
in lower guk.  I was wondering if it is the rare or the common drop and<br/>
about how much it sells for.  <br/>
<br/>
Last evening I was on my way out of North Freeport and just as I was about<br/>
to zone I caught someone auctioning one for 400pp, so I went and grabbed it.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a good price but I didn&#39;t care much because I was<br/>
able to turn around and sell my medium steel helm for 333pp so I pretty much<br/>
broke even on the deal.<br/>
<br/>
How do you think this helm compares as a choice at my level (35) with other<br/>
similar headgear like the Crested Helm, the Crown of the Froglok Kings, and<br/>
the Lambent Helm? I really can&#39;t get enough magic resistance and the +35 hit<br/>
points is nice when combined with my lambent BP giving me an overall bonus<br/>
of 60 hit points, which laughably is like a &quot;free hit&quot; from most of the<br/>
stuff I am fighting now.<br/>
<br/>
Comments, suggestions?<br/>
