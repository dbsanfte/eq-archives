<br/>
Maybe the rest of youare just more MUCH more patient than me.  I know your<br/>
much better testers....<br/>
<br/>
As far as bards being ignored...<br/>
<br/>
one song per lvl, 50 lvls...  if the songs there aren&#39;t 50 songs - then we<br/>
aren&#39;t complete.  And they have had 8 months to get them in.  The priority<br/>
should be to complete a class before offering more spells and weapons to<br/>
others classes - and yes that means even the FA to paladins.<br/>
<br/>
What torked me up beyond belief was the Pally/SK enhancement, meant to bring<br/>
them on par with rangers.  I don&#39;t think Verant has addressed the bard<br/>
hybrid issue at all.  They balanced hybrids, and left us off the list.  Roll<br/>
in the lack of testing, the delays on fixes, the admitted mistakes that may<br/>
not ever be corrected - like plane weapons going in as 3 11/25s, and all<br/>
kinds of buggy things happening with songs, procing weapons & items.<br/>
<br/>
... roll all these up, and toss in...<br/>
<br/>
The  little things, like the enhancements that were implemented in the last<br/>
patch, didn&#39;t get mentioned the patch message?  What was up with the whole -<br/>
it&#39;s in this patch, the next patch, coming soon, responses?  Then the patch<br/>
with the enhancements atcually happens,  but they don&#39;t bother to mention<br/>
anything - other than a change to solidarity of vision!  What about the<br/>
three weeks with no explanation given to bards? When other classes were<br/>
addressed specifically.  Again, it&#39;s a little thing, but it&#39;s about getting<br/>
the same attention paid to us as the other classes.<br/>
<br/>
And finally...<br/>
<br/>
Abashi chose my post give his response.  Granted, my post  was a rant, but<br/>
it got his attention.  My post definitely didn&#39;t have the substance that<br/>
John Kim&#39;s lullaby post has.  Nor is my post anywhere near being as thorough<br/>
as Kedian (sp) bard petition post.  Both of these threads have over 200+<br/>
hits, but no response from Abashi.  Answering my rant was the easy way out<br/>
for Abashi, and he took it.  Instead of spending the time and effort to<br/>
offer meaningful responses, we get a flame.  If my post hurt the bards case<br/>
in the long run, I am sorry, but clearly the patient approach isn&#39;t getting<br/>
things done.<br/>
<br/>
what this all adds up to, as far as I am concerned, is that bards are a low<br/>
priority to Verant.  So why don&#39;t they just fess up already?<br/>
<br/>
As far as the enhancements that went in on the last patch.  The see invis to<br/>
clouding makes the song much more useful, and increased range on selo&#39;s is<br/>
great. But did they do anything earth-shattering... no.  Did they fix<br/>
lullaby, increase dodge, implement parry, implement any mid-lvl<br/>
instruments - no.  They increased the range of 4 songs.  Now maybe some of<br/>
you can clue me in, but I have never actually used levitation for a group,<br/>
or actually used tarews as the way to keep the group breathing under water.<br/>
So unless I am missing something * a very likely possibility :) *- those two<br/>
&quot;enhancements&quot; aren&#39;t much of anything.  I would have much rather seen any<br/>
of the other suggestions implemented. And -  NO - they don&#39;t get credit for<br/>
putting the 47 lvl song in, the song should&#39;ve been there along time ago.<br/>
<br/>
Let me say this very plainly - I have played a bard since release.  I<br/>
ABSOLUTELY enjoy playing my bard - just the way it is.  I would NOT want to<br/>
play another class.  But, I don&#39;t think I should get any less of a product,<br/>
or less customer service than any other customer.  It&#39;s only ten bucks, but<br/>
still...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I tell ya all this... I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s different people working on<br/>
&gt; equipment, and if they got another song in.  We are still missing 3 songs,<br/>
&gt; and should not settle.  Why bards are a lower priority than other classes,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And they have continually said that our 4 songs were planned to go in with<br/>
&gt; the Expansion with a hint of throwing one in sooner.  So, we are ahead 1<br/>
&gt; song by 2 months.  I guess I don&#39;t understand the lower priority comment.<br/>
&gt; Disregarding the somewhat evasive answers, is there any other class who<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; a sole Archmage Answers dedicated to them?  Or that got GZ to test things<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; person with?  Did we not get new quest armor at the same time as most<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; classes?  Did we not get a whole slew of improvements (at least as far as<br/>
&gt; the patch message was concerned) last patch?  I really don&#39;t see how we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; treated as lower priority.  One question I do have.. if they wanted us to<br/>
&gt; get something new with the expansion, are we not getting 10 new songs for<br/>
&gt; level 51 - 60?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; All in all... I think he was saying, if I don&#39;t like it, I can leave.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Something about not being able to satisfy all the people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess I read it as, &quot;Give us a break, already!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Abashi is absolutely right... They do get less rants when they nerf!<br/>
