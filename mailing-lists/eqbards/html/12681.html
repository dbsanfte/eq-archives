Hello all,<br/>
I took the original post with all the questions about bards and delivered <br/>
them directy to Geoffrey Zatkin, the Arch-Mage of Norrath. He was kind <br/>
enough to reply with a very well thought-out response, which is below in <br/>
it&#39;s entirety.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that since retail release the Bard seems to be often <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;forgotten when it comes to testing out patches. Things like the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;accidental Selo&#39;s nerf (caused by the mem hacking), the Consonant Chain <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;debacle (Sow&#39;ed creatures could not be chained), and the most recent <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;levitate bug are very obvious to someone who plays a bard. All of these <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;unintended nerfs could have been avoided with less then 5 mins of play <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;testing these changes on a bard. So the question here is beyond compiling <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the code what kind of play testing of changes to the magic system takes <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;place?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
We have a solid internal testing department. The problem is, due to the <br/>
sheer scale of EQ, changes can slip through the cracks. We try to fix the <br/>
ones we miss as soon as we find/hear about them ´┐¢ but in a dynamic world, <br/>
strange things can happen.<br/>
<br/>
You should see some of the bugs we catch that never make it live ´┐¢ or even <br/>
to test.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby, I recently tested this song out vs. a level one <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;human warrior. My Bard was level 37 at the time, using the Lute of the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Gypsy Princess and I have charisma of 141. Every round I got the &#39;so and <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;so head nods&#39; message and every nearly every round the test subject was <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;able to attack me (about 1 in 10 rounds he would not).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
As most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are two saving <br/>
throws that happen with an ´┐¢Enthrall´┐¢ style effect (such as Kelin´┐¢s Lucid <br/>
Lullaby) hits a creature. The first saving throw is against the target´┐¢s <br/>
Magic Resistance. The second saving throw only happens with high level <br/>
monsters ´┐¢ they get a secondary save based on their level. The reason for <br/>
this is that the Enthrall effect is very, very powerful ´┐¢ it allows a single <br/>
player to remove a creature from combat. This means that a party that could <br/>
handle two ´┐¢X´┐¢ level mobs might be able to take three, or even four of them <br/>
on if there is somebody around with the Enthrall effect.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have a harder time <br/>
being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can take out a single <br/>
opponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much harder, and by high <br/>
levels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a single player to remove one or <br/>
more creatures from combat at high levels is sick level powerful ´┐¢ to the <br/>
point that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<br/>
<br/>
The second saving throw does not send a message the environment ´┐¢ and that <br/>
is something that is on our list of issues to address. There are, however, <br/>
no bugs with the Song.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody, It does now work (9 months after release), <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;but it strips good as well as bad spells from the party, making the song <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;worse then useless. Is this the intended effect?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Alenia´┐¢s Disenchanting Melody works as it was intended to ´┐¢ it follows the <br/>
design that we had for it from the beginning. It is particularly useful? <br/>
Depends if your buddy is dying from a nasty DoT. People use Egg Shaped <br/>
Pumice on themselves all the time on the PvP servers. Is the Disenchanting <br/>
Melody as generally useful as Cancel Magic? Not really.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Angstlich&#39;s Appalling Screech, When used against very large creatures <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;(Giants, Mammoths, Elephants, etc..) You have to be standing directly <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;under or in some cases IN the NPC Avatar for the song to take effect. <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Otherwise the creature will glow, but no message or effect will be seen.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Heh. This is due to how the models are built ´┐¢ each has a ´┐¢center´┐¢ point, <br/>
which is what calculates where our servers think the monster actually is. <br/>
Really big creatures have center points farther away from you ´┐¢ hidden deep <br/>
within their polygonal body mass. I will bump the radius of the Screech up a <br/>
bit on the next spell patch and we can see if it works a bit better. Part of <br/>
the problem is that when I play my Bard, I know exactly how these things <br/>
work ´┐¢ and exactly where to stand. Sometimes knowing a bit too much about <br/>
something works against you.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, Often times when using this in a group <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;situation the newly charmed pet will agro on a party member. This could <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;cause a nasty way to get around the PvP switch as the pet is immune to PC <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;attack. The pet needs to ignore any player characters or pets on its hate <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;list when charmed. Also sometimes player pets (party & non-party member <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;pets) will attack the Bard charming a NPC if the pet had been attacking <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the NPC.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
I´┐¢ve had the pet agro on party members too ´┐¢ but it is usually because one <br/>
of my party members did something to the pet that it didn´┐¢t like just after <br/>
I charmed it ´┐¢ whacking it, for example. I usually have my pet commands <br/>
hotkeyed, and retarget to something I want my new pet to be attacking as <br/>
soon as I charm it.<br/>
<br/>
Charm can be dangerous because once you take control of a monster, all of <br/>
its actions reflect on you. If you charm a monster that is fighting your <br/>
friend´┐¢s pet, and the pet hits the monster after you charm it, your charmed <br/>
monster will attack back. When that little fight gets broken up, there is a <br/>
possibility that your friend´┐¢s pet will come after you ´┐¢ you were, after <br/>
all, the controller of the thing it was just fighting. Charming around pets <br/>
can be done ´┐¢ you just need to be a little more careful.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Crission&#39;s Pixie Chase, This song seems to suffer from the same problem <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;that Lullaby does, you get the message that the song has taken effect, <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;but the target completely ignores the fact that it should be mesmerized <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;(similarto the problem with Lucid Lullaby).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
See above.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The percussion aspect <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces no additional effect <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;(damage or resistance debuff).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Hmm ´┐¢ don´┐¢t use that one much. I´┐¢ll check. If so, we´┐¢ll get it fixed right <br/>
up.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Psalm of Cooling, The damage shield portion of this song does not seem to <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;stack as logic would lead me to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>believe. I can understand that it would weaken fire based damage shields, <br/>
but why would it weaken thistle based damage shields? I have not had a <br/>
chance to see if it stacks with the necro damage shield (which I believe is <br/>
cold based).<br/>
<br/>
***GZ SAYS***<br/>
The Psalm´┐¢s Damage Shield will stack with the Druid and Ranger personal <br/>
Damage Shields ´┐¢ but they will not stack with other damage shields ´┐¢ in the <br/>
same way that no other Damage Shield stacks with another. You can not, for <br/>
example, stack Shield of Spikes and Shield of Fire.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Denon&#39;s Dissension, The instrument portion of this song seems to be <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;broken. In tests I have run using a horn made no difference in mana drain <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;in PvP combat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
This was a very tough song to balance. It takes away mana from other casters <br/>
´┐¢ the virtual lifeblood of 7 of EverQuest´┐¢s 14 classes. The amount taken <br/>
away is nice, but not great. Using a Horn increases the amount of mana <br/>
drained. Again, nice, but not great.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;McVaxius Berserker Crescendo, I do not have this song yet, but other <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;bards have informed me using a horn only increases the song&#39;s Strength <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;effect, leaving the attack speed unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
The way our song system works, if an instrument effects a song, it effects <br/>
the entire song. Without specifically hardcoding it, I couldn´┐¢t actually <br/>
make the Crescendo only effect the AC and STR but not the Attack Speed. As I <br/>
didn´┐¢t hardcode it, the Horn should increase the attack speed along with the <br/>
Strength and AC.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, unless my memory serves me wrong (which it could), you <br/>
*must* use a Horn to use this song.<br/>
<br/>
As a completely side note, I saw on a certain website that this song <br/>
increases attack speed by 15 percent. It actually does considerably more <br/>
then that. I stand by an earlier comment that I still haven´┐¢t seen an <br/>
exceptional spell analysis program yet.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Verses of Victory, Many of the higher level bards I have spoken with are <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;very upset by the recent downgrading of the attack speed component, is <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;there any chance this can be restored to previous levels?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Nothing has changed on Verses of Victory since I put the song in. Somebody <br/>
is pulling your leg.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;A while back GZ mentioned the meming time for bard songs would be <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;decreased, but it still takes forever to mem songs (due to the lack of a <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;mediate skill). Can this be looked into?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
It is already on our list of things to add in.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Can a switch be set up (similar to the Fast Destroy option) to give <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;players the choice of 1-Always dropping<br/>
 </span></blockquote>items, 2-Confirm to drop, 3-No dropping of items. Bards I know have lost <br/>
everything from Bladed Thulian Claws to Mistmoore Battledrums due to the <br/>
&quot;cracks&quot; between hotkeys and swapping instruments/weapons.<br/>
<br/>
***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Solid suggestion. See what I can do. No promises, but´┐¢<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Every time an answer is given on when the missing bard songs will be <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;added the answer is very soon. Any chance of a better eta?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
We were initially gong to save them all for the expansion pack. I don´┐¢t know <br/>
if I can wait that long to get at least one of them in (I really want to see <br/>
how people use it), so maybe a bit earlier.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;DoT change a while back lowered the damage of our DoT songs but didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;increase the duration, any chance that this could be balanced in some <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;way?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***GZ SAYS***<br/>
Bards are affected by the Kiting changes just like everybody else. Bard´┐¢s <br/>
kiting creatures will get the disadvantage ´┐¢ in all other cases, the songs <br/>
should work just as before. Minimal combat movement will not lower the <br/>
damage on a DoT or Bard Song.<br/>
