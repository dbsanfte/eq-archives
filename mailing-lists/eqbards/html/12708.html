<div id="ygrps-yiv-76829020">Hi All.  I don&#39;t usually comment on this list.  I just sit back and soak up<br/>
the combined wisdoms of the higher level bards.  But one part of GZ&#39;s<br/>
answers bugged me...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby, I recently tested this song out vs. a level one<br/>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;human warrior. My Bard was level 37 at the time, using the Lute of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Gypsy Princess and I have charisma of 141. Every round I got the &#39;so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;so head nods&#39; message and every nearly every round the test subject was<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;able to attack me (about 1 in 10 rounds he would not).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***GZ SAYS***<br/>
&gt; As most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are two<br/>
 </span></blockquote>saving<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; throws that happen with an &quot;Enthrall&quot; style effect (such as Kelin&#39;s Lucid<br/>
&gt; Lullaby) hits a creature. The first saving throw is against the target&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Magic Resistance. The second saving throw only happens with high level<br/>
&gt; monsters - they get a secondary save based on their level. The reason for<br/>
&gt; this is that the Enthrall effect is very, very powerful - it allows a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>single<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; player to remove a creature from combat. This means that a party that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; handle two &quot;X&quot; level mobs might be able to take three, or even four of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on if there is somebody around with the Enthrall effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have a harder<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can take out a single<br/>
&gt; opponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much harder, and by high<br/>
&gt; levels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a single player to remove one<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more creatures from combat at high levels is sick level powerful - to the<br/>
&gt; point that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The second saving throw does not send a message the environment - and that<br/>
&gt; is something that is on our list of issues to address. There are, however,<br/>
&gt; no bugs with the Song.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it just me or does his answer have absolutely ZERO to do with the<br/>
question as it was asked?  This is a High level bard against a level 1<br/>
warrior.  Now it seems to me, if what GZ said is true, then this warrior<br/>
should have not resisted 9 times out of 10.  He can&#39;t have a high Magic<br/>
resistance, nor is he a High level opponent to have a second saving throw.<br/>
GZ seems to gloss right over the real world example given.  Is this another<br/>
example of Verant ignoring the players as they did for shaman&#39;s alchemy.<br/>
How long did they assure shamans that alchemy worked before they actually<br/>
found that there was a problem, which the players were saying all along.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other questions/answers, I can&#39;t really comment on them being<br/>
only level 17.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you higher level Bards who have done all the research to make<br/>
the lives of us lower level bards that much easier.<br/>
