&gt; As I said, my skills are all at or above 190, and approaching 200. My<br/>
&gt; regrets that your Brass skills are poor, perhaps a little practice is in<br/>
&gt; order. I have tested this and as I said several times I am missing notes on<br/>
&gt; songs I NEVER missed notes on before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard to have sympathy for you, when you turn a suggested explanation into<br/>
an irrelevant attack on my brass skills.  If you&#39;ve done testing, then show us<br/>
the numbers.  So far everyone who has posted numbers, as far as I can tell, is<br/>
showing perfectly reasonable missed note rates.  If you have evidence to the<br/>
contrary, if anyone does, we can start to reasonably believe there&#39;s a<br/>
difference, but most people seem to not be experiencing what you are.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is server specific, btw, since John Kim, who also says his<br/>
missed note rates are up, is on the same server as I am, and I haven&#39;t<br/>
experienced it.<br/>
