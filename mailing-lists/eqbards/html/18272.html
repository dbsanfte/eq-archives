<div id="ygrps-yiv-308783449">I use a &quot;ProThrottle&quot; from CH Products.  Functionally, it works like a game<br/>
pad in that it has buttons that are programmable and will send keystrokes<br/>
when you click them.  But the manufacturer and presumably the design is<br/>
different from yours.  Does your work with &quot;other games&quot; ??  Ie: is it a<br/>
Gravis install issue or an EQ issue?<br/>
<br/>
From time to time in my gaming career, I have had to fight battles with<br/>
joystick drivers.  Sometimes, you could load the equipment and program it<br/>
with the OEM software but the OEM drivers would not work with Windows.  So,<br/>
you had to set the joystick/gameport to a generic one (two-axis/two button)<br/>
to get things to work or to partially work.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you needed to have the resources set to a very specific port<br/>
setting in device manager - resources (201-201 for a certain joystick I once<br/>
had would work where 200-209 would fail.)  And of course if you have<br/>
conflicting interuppts or memory addresses, you need to resolve those.<br/>
<br/>
Mine hooks up inline with my keyboard cable so it can send in keystrokes.<br/>
If the Gravis tries to do it through redirecting the calls to the keystroke<br/>
interupts and EQ is polling that area of ram directly - there could be<br/>
trouble. Are there any &#39;switches&#39; or jumpers on the Gravis you can set?<br/>
Call Gravis Tech Supp? Do they know if it will work with EQ?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that I cant be more help,<br/>

p.s. I splurged on Friday and overnited 2 x 128 meg PC100 ram sticks and a<br/>
generic TNT2 agp card.  basically my 2nd pc (P2-333 128 meg old STB agp<br/>
Lightspeed D3D) was doggin&#39; badly in Kunark.  Now it&#39;s much better &lt;g&gt;  Both<br/>
boxes have 256meg ramski and decent vid cards. Sorry John Kim - I vastly<br/>
prefer my VooDoo3 3k and glide over TNT2 D3D - D3D is very granular and the<br/>
gamma is way off (of course a 3rd party program adjusts it for me and even<br/>
my hummies can kinda see now.)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; From time to time we get onto a hardware topic; my turn ;).  Sylly, I have<br/>
heard you<br/>
&gt; say you use a gamepad yes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I bought a Gravis GamePad Pro USB and it just won&#39;t work.  I downloaded<br/>
the latest<br/>
&gt; driver from Gravis.  I bound it to EQ and defined keys but nothing<br/>
happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions?  Thanks =).<br/>
