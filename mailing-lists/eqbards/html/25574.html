<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653783812">Yeah, if I were just starting I would frankly wait until SOL came out and<br/>
start a Kerran Bard.<br/>
<br/>
1) It will be high in the cool factor<br/>
2) There will be a lot more newbie toons around to group with<br/>
3) There will be a lot of higher characters exploring nearby and twinking<br/>
low characters (more likely to get lucky - but don&#39;t beg!)<br/>

<br/>
As for the quiet, I imagine everyone&#39;s girding for the SoL release.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
BTW, has anyone noticed the SoL skill list for Bards?&nbsp; Lots of nice<br/>
things, but when do those skills kick in???<br/>
