<div id="ygrps-yiv-446553991">While it seems to be dogma among most Everquest players that higher level<br/>
players get a greater percentage of experience (or more clearly - there is<br/>
an xp penalty for lower level players when grouped with higher level<br/>
players) - Good ole Abashi once stated clearly &quot;There is no scaling of<br/>
Experience Points within a group....&quot;<br/>

Who is having a very serious discussion with her paladin husband about<br/>
whether there is a minor or more severe experience split discrepancy in a<br/>
group between a 49th level and a 58th level person, and is getting cold hard<br/>
data to back her up ;)<br/>
