 </span></blockquote>A barbed leather whip has a better damage/delay ratio than<br/>
well balanced weapons.  Getting one instead of a combine (if<br/>
you can afford it) means you won&#39;t need to upgrade until you<br/>
reach around level 30.  If you can stand the stamina loss from<br/>
using it.  I should note that a dragoon dirk has an even<br/>
better damage/delay ratio than a BLW, and won&#39;t chew up your<br/>
stamina.  You&#39;re better off putting the dirk in your primary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depends on the jerk ratio on your server.  On Karana it&#39;s<br/>
seemingly forever camped by kill stealers and casters who<br/>
can&#39;t use it (hint - write down their names, and never group<br/>
with them once you get the mana song).  On Tunare last night,<br/>
I was practically the only one there, aside from a couple<br/>
druids my level who were spending most of their time medding.  <br/>
Seems we were all there for experience though as we could<br/>
barely handle the more difficult gnolls, much less a Mucktail.<br/>
<br/>
Most people I know start itching to trade away their PGT by<br/>
about level 25, usually for a BLW, gladius, or silvery axe.<br/>
