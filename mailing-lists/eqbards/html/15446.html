&gt; &gt; Grouping is best.  Best exp 35-40 is Mistmoore.  You can get<br/>
&gt; &gt; about a bubble every hour or two there with a competent group<br/>
&gt; &gt; that knows how to work around the bugs in the zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please expound on this. I did the outer part of Mistmoore at 25 but<br/>
&gt; never went back. Where do you hunt 35-40? Is it doable on a new server?<br/>
&gt; In other words with one group and few other high level people in the<br/>
&gt; zone?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Invis your group and go to the kitchen (easy now that they<br/>
added see invis to the bard song - you walk, everyone else<br/>
follows).  Agree on a battle plan - who to attack first, how<br/>
to crowd control, etc.  Drop your invis and attack<br/>
simultaneously (if you&#39;re quick enough, you can charm one of<br/>
the cooks and get them to harm touch each other).<br/>
<br/>
After you clear the kitchen, rest up.  When you&#39;re ready, pull<br/>
one hallway mob to the kitchen, kill it.  Repeat with the<br/>
other two hall mobs.  Then start pulling the maid and butler<br/>
room.  Once you have these rooms clear, you can camp them if<br/>
you like since other people like to just waltz in and take<br/>
over the rooms if you&#39;re not physically in them.  Other people<br/>
suggest taking the maid/butler rooms first, but then you have<br/>
to be damn sure there aren&#39;t any runners or they&#39;ll trigger<br/>
the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your group&#39;s abilities, you can keep fighting the<br/>
mobs in these rooms, or you can start pulling from further<br/>
out.  The gargoyles are the easiest, although there&#39;s<br/>
sometimes a wandering familiar/sentry/guard/custodian, so it<br/>
can be a bit risky.  After the gargoyles, you pull the<br/>
negotiator room harmoying/lulling to break them up.  The<br/>
ballroom/music room is a bit trickier as some of the mobs are<br/>
in aggro radius when you open the door.<br/>
<br/>
With a L35-42 group, we were typically killing each mob within<br/>
5-6 song cycles (roughly 20+ seconds).<br/>
<br/>
You can also do the princess room (a bit safer to get to, but<br/>
not as many mobs to pull).  Or the torture chamber, pulling<br/>
out to the piano/window room (riskier due to the pool room<br/>
being adjacent).  Or the garden, pulling the piano/window room<br/>
and nearby rooms (tougher to break up since the piano room<br/>
tends to empty at once).  The maid/butler/kitchen area is by<br/>
far the safest though, immune from trains except those of your<br/>
making.<br/>
