<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lullaby nerfed too?  (was Charm) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-290526169">I have experienced this in Cazic-Thule in the last few days as well.  I<br/>
would equip my mandolin, sing Lullaby, get a &quot;nods&quot; message from EVERY<br/>
single lizzy in the pack and yet two or three would seem to be completely<br/>
unaffected by it.  It was disconcerting, as this is NOT the way the song<br/>
used to work.  In former times I would get (for example) four &quot;nods&quot;<br/>
messages and one &quot;resists&quot; message and ONE mob would smack me as expected.<br/>
Not true any longer.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This happened to me in Permafrost over the weekend.  I had just<br/>
&gt; zoned in and<br/>
&gt; a group was at the zone border fighting 5-6 ice goblins.  I<br/>
&gt; starting singing<br/>
&gt; lullaby with lute equipped.  I was not attacking any of the mobs.<br/>
&gt;  With one<br/>
&gt; or two exceptions for the entire fight, every time the song pulsed every<br/>
&gt; goblin was put to sleep.  I confirmed with their group leader<br/>
&gt; that the party<br/>
&gt; was concentrating on one mob.  In theory, the others should have<br/>
&gt; just stood<br/>
&gt; there doing nothing.  Instead, often 2-3 mobs would attack me<br/>
&gt; even though no<br/>
&gt; one was attacking them.  If the lullaby affected them, it only<br/>
&gt; lasted for a<br/>
&gt; microsecond.<br/>

&gt; &gt; DEV_01: &quot;I know, lets do it like we did Lucid Lullaby.  It will say it<br/>
&gt; &gt; worked, but it will not!&quot;<br/>
