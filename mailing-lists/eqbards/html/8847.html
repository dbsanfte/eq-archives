<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068393193">Can you safely get to the area where the Solusek Mage and Champion spawn by<br/>
singing the Invis song or are there mobs along the path that can See Invis?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The Solusek Mage and champions show up in the area around the<br/>
&gt; king room.  After you zone into Sol A, pass the lava and go<br/>
&gt; through the hole in the wall, you&#39;ll come to a T intersection<br/>
&gt; at the ledge.  If you go straight (off the ledge) there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; doorway.  Go through that door and follow the right<br/>
&gt; wall.  There&#39;s one passage that will loop back (ends at a<br/>
&gt; window above a previous area), but if you skip it and keep<br/>
&gt; following the right wall, it&#39;ll take you straight to the room<br/>
&gt; with the Solusek Mage.  The room immediately prior to this,<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a door on the left which leads to the king room.  So<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s actually not that bad a place to use as a base and pull<br/>
&gt; to.  <br/>
