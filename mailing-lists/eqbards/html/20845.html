<div id="ygrps-yiv-93773521">Heh thanks :)  Its Veeshan (which explains all the Japanese people being<br/>
there, heh)<br/>
<br/>
A lvl one iksar would absorb one attack, heh, my lvl 8 iksar would do the<br/>
same...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who have (or will) reply, I am formulated a few plans in my<br/>
head.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Get enough people to clear the room (obviously best option)<br/>
2.  Get a guide to help (and I always try to be in character or friendly<br/>
when i talk to them)<br/>
3.  Log on, screech and cross my fingers.<br/>
3a.  Get a lesser group to help my Cr from hopefully an esier spot.<br/>
4.  Go down the shore house and wait for option 1.</div>
