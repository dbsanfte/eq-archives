<br/>
Go to www.chproducts.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chproducts.com">http://www.chproducts.com</a>&gt;  and see what they<br/>
have.  There is a gizmo there called ProThrottle and that is what I use (cus<br/>
it&#39;s stuff that I had for playing airplane simulator games.)  Also, it&#39;s<br/>
worth a call to them - they are real nice people and can maybe better<br/>
explain to you how it works and be able to tell you whether or not it can be<br/>
hooked up to a laptop computer.<br/>
<br/>
They also have a USB Gamepad that might help you out.<br/>
<br/>
G&#39;Luck!<br/>

got gets pretty uhmm shall we say uhmm distorted??? &lt;g&gt; (just kiddin&#39; Harm!)<br/>

		A few days / weeks ago there was a brief discussion on using<br/>
a programmable game pad to assist in twisting songs... (significantly reduce<br/>
&quot;button mashing&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
		Since i almost always play on my laptop, anything that<br/>
improves the keyboard layout is of interest to me.  Could someone send me or<br/>
post additional information.  I bought the Sidewinder Game pad pro yesterday<br/>
and can not seem to get eq to recognize it. (not even for mouse movement).<br/>
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
