<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585473374">I&#39;d have to disagree with this. Especially the Erudite Paladin. For one<br/>
thing, the disadvantages were supposed to be coupled with advantages, as<br/>
in the large race warriors being KoS and having a large experience<br/>
penalty, but as we&#39;ve found out, the increased stats of the large races<br/>
are effectively meaningless, giving them nothing except a slightly<br/>
larger hp advantage over smaller warriors. At the same time, we&#39;ve found<br/>
that smaller races with their higher agility likewise recieve no<br/>
measureable improvement in avoiding taking damage. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, even if stats mattered, the Erudite Paladin get&#39;s no<br/>
advantage at all to balance out their pathetic stats. So really all the<br/>
shield will give the paladin is an increased carrying capacity, which in<br/>
the case of a planes ready character means they can wear something other<br/>
than a thick banded belt, and a few more hp. And a nice chunk of AC.<br/>
<br/>
AFAIC, the AC would be the only thing to complain about, if there are no<br/>
similar shields for Paladins of other races.<br/>

&gt; &gt; i have 2 friends who have done this.  a cleric started an erudite paladin<br/>
&gt; &gt; just because of the shield from hate (paladin now level 46) and a shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend created a druid to gate around and get him herbs for alchemy (druid<br/>
&gt; &gt; now level 44, not bad since alchemy just started).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really dislike that shield (35 AC, +20 str, +20 sta,<br/>
&gt; ultravision).  It essentially counteracts all the<br/>
&gt; disadvantages of being an erudite paladin, which IMHO defeats<br/>
&gt; the purpose of having disadvantages to certain races.<br/>
