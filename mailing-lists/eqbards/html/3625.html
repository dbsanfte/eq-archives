&gt; Think thats bad?  I saw a low level Half Elf female, also <br/>
&gt; toting full bronze<br/>
&gt; and weilding a demon claw,  I really hate seeing this around. <br/>
&gt;  Although,<br/>
&gt; little bit of twinking I do is whenever I see a brand new <br/>
&gt; bard in the guild<br/>
&gt; I hand him/her 2plat to let them get the songs and whatever <br/>
&gt; else they need.<br/>
&gt; Another person did the same for me at level 1 ).<br/>

&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am on a mission today for STR increasing items (my base STR <br/>
&gt; is 75 eeeuoo).<br/>
&gt; I have heard people like Shada talk about a purity belt.  <br/>
&gt; What is it, how<br/>
&gt; much is it, and where can I get one?  Also I was wondering, besides<br/>
&gt; rubicite, is there another armor that has the very high AC <br/>
&gt; and yet is light?<br/>
&gt; Is mesh an option for bards?  What exactly is mesh anyway?  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard many<br/>
&gt; Looking to buy&#39;s but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever actually noticed anyone<br/>
&gt; wearing it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And my gripe of the day -- TWINKING HAS BECOME RAMPANT ON <br/>
&gt; EROLLISI MARR!!!!!<br/>
&gt; I saw a lvl 5 bard yesterday walking through Freeport with a <br/>
&gt; full suit of<br/>
&gt; bronze plate.  That&#39;s just silly.  He said a friend gave it <br/>
&gt; to him, nice<br/>
&gt; gift.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, my real life brother-in-law just started <br/>
&gt; about 3 days<br/>
&gt; ago.  No sooner had his new character spawned at the Freeport <br/>
&gt; gates than<br/>
&gt; some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked if he <br/>
&gt; wanted a 2H<br/>
&gt; instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could tell <br/>
&gt; him how to say<br/>
&gt; thank you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.  I guess <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just bent<br/>
&gt; because my bank account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly <br/>
&gt; so there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; way I could buy plate or any other really cool items yet.<br/>
