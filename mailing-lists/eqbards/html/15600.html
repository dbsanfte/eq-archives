&gt;This is somewhat philosophical and IMHO, but anyways:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;These things happen, and these things hurt because online<br/>
&gt;RPGing is more than &quot;just a game.&quot;  The genre is evolving into<br/>
&gt;something I don&#39;t think most people are foreseeing - a virtual<br/>
&gt;world where your persona is not just a role you play, but an<br/>
&gt;alternate ego that is every bit as real as your real life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not evolving. This is typical of the genre -- both offline<br/>
and online. When you play a character, it becomes a part of<br/>
you. Even on MU* that you don&#39;t pay ANYTHING, people get the<br/>
same feelings. They cry RL (even people who do not normally<br/>
cry at ALL) when they do not impress on a Pern-themed MU*<br/>
(PernMUSH, SouCon MUSH, DragonDawn, Dragonsfire MOO, Red Star MUSH)<br/>
and throw temper tantrums when they do not get that bronze/gold<br/>
they wanted. Even firelizard hatchings can become near and dear<br/>
to your heart. Because it is your character that is affected.<br/>
The character you have spent hours and hours playing, such that<br/>
they have become a part of you.<br/>
<br/>
On the MU* I played, you never could kill another player without<br/>
their consent...and very few people ever killed off their characters<br/>
unless they were having to leave the MUSH for one reason or another.<br/>
<br/>
In RL RP, I have seen people panic when they think their character is in<br/>
a no-win situation -- and beg,looking for a way out. I have seen things<br/>
allowed, and no one complain, that would not be otherwise just to<br/>
give another chance.<br/>
