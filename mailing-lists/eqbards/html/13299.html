<div id="ygrps-yiv-587060796">Yup.  Although on a new server, without friends, that is<br/>
much more difficult I would think.  But on a server where you already have<br/>
friends, its especially true if you are able to twink with some decent items<br/>
or even 50pp cash.  Then you don&#39;t need to spend your time running and<br/>
selling and trying to acquire basic items, you also have money to buy spells<br/>
all at once rather than having to run back and forth.  In my opinion they<br/>
keys to good fast leveling are: <br/>
1.	Don&#39;t die<br/>
2.	Don&#39;t die<br/>
3.	Location (i.e. plenty of spawns, low death risk)<br/>
4.	The other thing that REALLY helps is to have higher level friends<br/>
who can tele your butt around when necessary.<br/>
5.	Don&#39;t die<br/>
6.	Don&#39;t have fun.  There is no time for rp or exploring :-)<br/>
<br/>
		Even at the lower levels where you don&#39;t lose exp, the<br/>
amount of time it takes to run and get your body and re-mem spells without<br/>
med could easily get you a bub or two at that level.<br/>

				The other day I was in Cazic deep in the<br/>
sewers with a pretty good pickup<br/>
				group.  I was the lowest at 31st level.  We<br/>
only had five people in the<br/>
				group so when a 34 necro shouted he wanted<br/>
to join a party I told him we had<br/>
				a spot.  When the necro joined the party, he<br/>
told us that that he had almost<br/>
				no experience fighting in groups before.  He<br/>
stated that he had soloed all<br/>
				the way from 1st level to 34th level and<br/>
only had 10 days played time.  He<br/>
				stated that only now since he was at 34th<br/>
did he find it necessary to join<br/>
				groups to get good EXP.  I have heard that<br/>
necros were the best at soloing<br/>
				so I had trouble believing what he said.  I<br/>
am 31st level with 29 days<br/>
				played time.  A friend of mine is a 36<br/>
enchanter with 50 days played time.<br/>
				Someone in the party asked him if he had<br/>
friends that helped him powerlevel<br/>
				to 34th.  He said that he had done it all by<br/>
himself and that he just knew<br/>
				the right places to camp.  Does this sound<br/>
credible that a necro can solo to<br/>
				34th in only 10 days played time?<br/>
