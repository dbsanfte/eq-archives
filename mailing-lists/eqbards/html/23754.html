<div id="ygrps-yiv-656017176">I don&#39;t really know how bard songs work with respect to AC, as my bard is only level 23 currently, but keep in mind that there is &quot;raw&quot; AC and &quot;calculated&quot; AC.  Take off a piece of armor with 10 AC and no agi bonuses and you might like 20+ AC.  So if I reduces your &quot;raw&quot; AC by 16, that could be a large &quot;calculated&quot; AC decrease.  Again, I have no idea if this is how this works.<br/>

  &gt;So is it safe to assume that when you hit a mob with the 51 song, their<br/>
  &gt;agility is also lowered less than 75 and as a result the total AC debuff<br/>
  &gt;from this song is close to 60+?<br/>
<br/>
  yep, this would probably be the case.  oh, assuming of course that their<br/>
  starting agility is the same as your starting agility.<br/>
