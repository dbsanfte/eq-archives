&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Last night I dueled a 22nd level bard friend in the Arena at Lake<br/>
Rathe,<br/>
&gt; I was hoping I could really plink her with arrows and try to snare her<br/>
wich<br/>
&gt; did work. BUT she soon found my range of my weapons and my minimum range<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; the bow (meaning she was too close for me to fire). and she was always out<br/>
&gt; of range or too close for me to fire the bow. Now that said She on the<br/>
other<br/>
&gt; hand could run me down even snared if she was singing the celos<br/>
&gt; acceleration. HOW is it even possible for a melee type to beat a Bard they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to face you to hit you,cus they have an AOE with a huge range<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; it, they can hit you with a DD well out of the range of the bow you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; root them cus the sow song breaks it. if they stand toe to toe with you<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; ghet stomped pretty bad but all they have to do is back off a bit and run<br/>
&gt; from you for a sec or two to regen. In my opinion the bards are the most<br/>
&gt; unbalanced class in the game.  I can easily take down a wizzy or necro<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; out much problem if I can ever get a root off on em a warror is a joke<br/>
once<br/>
&gt; you hit em with snare and have plenty of arrows,  I have not tried to<br/>
fight<br/>
&gt; a druid or shamen yet but, at least I feel it is possible for me to beat<br/>
em.<br/>
&gt; I am not so sure about a bard. anyone got any advise.<br/>
