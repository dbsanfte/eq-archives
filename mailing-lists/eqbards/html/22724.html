<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-378162109">Patch for Velious already:<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s patch requires that Velious subscribers press the &quot;Velious Patch&quot;<br/>
button on the patch program UI.<br/>
<br/>
Emergency Patch<br/>
<br/>
We appreciate everyone&#39;s patience while we address a few issues as tens of<br/>
thousands of new players check out Velious. This emergency patch addresses<br/>
several issues:<br/>
The transparent inventory screen will no longer come up in 640x480<br/>
resolution. It was not supposed to come up as the available screen space is<br/>
not large enough to house the new screen.<br/>
&quot;Disabled&quot; windows in full screen mode will no longer interfere with mouse<br/>
clicks.<br/>
Addressed some item drop bugs in Skyshrine that had the highest-level loot<br/>
dropping off of yard fodder. This has been addressed with a retroactive item<br/>
change. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br/>
Several disciplines (Resistant, Trueshot, Unholyaura, and Holyforge) have<br/>
been upgraded. Please read the updated EQManual_Supplement.doc (or .txt) in<br/>
your EverQuest Directory.<br/>
&quot;Dragon Circles&quot; have been fully implemented. In short, you will not be able<br/>
to receive a teleport to a dragon circle unless you&#39;ve been to the circle<br/>
before and carry a soulbound souvenir that spawns at the circle. Please read<br/>
the updated EQManual_Supplement.<br/>
Innate class-based resistances implemented a year or so ago did not take<br/>
into account levels 50 through 60 with exception to those provided to the<br/>
warrior. As such, each class that has class-based resistance bonuses (with<br/>
exception to the warrior) will get an additional bonus as they level from 50<br/>
to 60.<br/>
The problem of blank faction messages being reported to the players has been<br/>
corrected.<br/>
Screenshots are again enabled.<br/>
Overall the Velious launch is going very well. We are happy to see that the<br/>
problems found so far are minor and that we can address them quickly.<br/>

My impressions:  WOOT!!  SoV is fun.  Mobs are very nice looking.  The dwarf<br/>
city has everything(have not found a bard trainer, but...).  Don&#39;t mess up<br/>
that faction.  Cantana was well received by the casters in my group.  And I<br/>
only saw one bard song.  Below said 4???  I wonder what they were.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, off to logon,<br/>

.Ok, Velious installed, parched and activated: <br/>
Druid ring/circle and Wizard gate/portal spells for Iceclad Ocean are found<br/>
in NK at the gypsies. They are level 34 spells like the Combine Ones. <br/>
It appears ( I forgot to grab /locs on both portals) that the Druid and<br/>
Wizard spells take you to the same location in Iceclad Ocean Zone. A note,<br/>
when I ported in with my level 35 Druid, I was immediately attacked by blue<br/>
/con mobs. My level 48 Wizzie was not attacked, but I think that is because<br/>
nothing was near the porter &quot;shack&quot; when I zoned in. The mobs /con green to<br/>
the Wizzie. <br/>
Barge to the Gnomish Icebreaker is caught in NRO at the new pier, just south<br/>
of the Barbarian Fishing Village. Barge then zones into Iceclad Ocean and<br/>
drops you off on an empty island. You then need to run accross the island to<br/>
the other side to catch the Gnomish Icebreaker. You can&#39;t miss the dock.<br/>
Icebreaker ride takes about 7 or 8 minutes to get you to the mainland. <br/>
Once you disembark from the Icebreaker, head left to the Gnomish Outpost.<br/>
One vendor there sells some of the new Velious Spells. I only saw 1 for each<br/>
class on him (except Bards had 4, go figure, hehe), and I was under the<br/>
impression that there was 2 for each class. So, as of yet, I don&#39;t know<br/>
where the other set is (if infact, there is another set). <br/>
That&#39;s it for now folks.</div>
