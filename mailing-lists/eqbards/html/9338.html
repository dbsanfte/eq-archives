<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420467851">i found most of the players were very nice when it came to lambent stones.<br/>
of the 7 stones i ended up needing (i skipped the helm), 4 were given to me<br/>
for free, 1 i looted myself, 1 bought for 30pp, the last bought for 50pp<br/>
(plus 25pp for a GG to lavastorm, the price not solicited i had just sold a<br/>
crystalline blade and was feeling generous since he was going to GG me for<br/>
free).  the one player i found rude wanted 100pp and told me go find it<br/>
cheaper, so i did =)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I received an offer of a stone for 125pp last night. I told <br/>
&gt; him good luck<br/>
&gt; getting that much, so he asked me how much I&#39;d pay. I said <br/>
&gt; 15pp for loot<br/>
&gt; rights and 50pp to buy in a city. He, a 35th lvl monk, said that was<br/>
&gt; ridiculous because the stone came from a 30+ level mob. I <br/>
&gt; countered with<br/>
&gt; &quot;yes, but they&#39;re lore. Can&#39;t carry too many of them around.&quot; I got no<br/>
&gt; response.<br/>
