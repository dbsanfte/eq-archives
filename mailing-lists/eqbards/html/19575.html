<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-572404550">Does anyone know for certain if these &quot;ghost&quot; faction messages actually<br/>
improve/worsen your faction?  If so I may be amiable now in Cabilis.  Here<br/>
is what happened.  I was fighting in the Overthere when my group pulled 3<br/>
sarnaks.  We snared one and I fired up screech.  The 2d and 3d sarnak<br/>
weren&#39;t snared so they ran so far away that when the fear wore off they<br/>
never came back.  I was pulling but didn&#39;t see the two sarnaks anywhere<br/>
nearby.  I assume they continued to wand around the zone.  Next few pulls<br/>
were nothing but rhinos, tigers, and cockatrices.  Then I started to get the<br/>
&quot;ghost&quot; faction messages for the sarnaks(plus Cabilis/minus sarnaks).  I&#39;m<br/>
assuming that the two sarnaks I feared passed by other sarnaks and added me<br/>
to their hate list.  So when other people killed them I got the faction<br/>
message.  A side benefit to this is that from that point on it was very easy<br/>
for me to pull sarnaks.  Normally to pull them I have to get withing FCC<br/>
range.  But since I was on the hate list for almost every sarnak in the zone<br/>
all I had to do was get one within sight and it would aggro on me<br/>
automatically.  To top it off on some occasions the sarnak I pulled would<br/>
bring a friend with him that wasn&#39;t even in sight.  I ended up getting<br/>
numerous ghost faction messages all night long.  I haven&#39;t been to Cabilis<br/>
yet but with all the ghost faction I&#39;ve gotten while in the Overthere it<br/>
might be possible that I can roam freely in there.<br/>

Well thats lovely...  I hope having ultra negative faction won&#39;t hurt me...<br/>
<br/>
I have learned to ignore faction messages in kunark as I get them<br/>
constantly.  (But its not a bug according to the Veeshan Guides).<br/>
<br/>
In any case its still pretty darn annoying as I usually pull (most people<br/>
don&#39;t pull fast enough for my taste).  Especially against things that run<br/>
fast, like the giants...<br/>
