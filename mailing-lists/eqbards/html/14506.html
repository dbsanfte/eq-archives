<div id="ygrps-yiv-642421734">PErhaps the kobolds believe the only way you can avoid reliving the<br/>
past is by remembering it. So these pictures are their way of reliving<br/>
past treacheries, and thus keeping them from happening again...<br/>
<br/>
We learn about our own past failures after all.<br/>

&gt;&gt; When I look at #13 from the King Room, I always thought that<br/>
&gt;this depicted<br/>
&gt;&gt; the defeat of a former King at the hands of the Goblins, perhaps prior to<br/>
&gt;&gt; the Nagefen raid from #8?  The gold is a crown.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Man, you are absolutely right... that is a crown.  I never saw it<br/>
&gt;  before until I looked really close at it.  Funny that this picture<br/>
&gt;  comes from the king room.  Again, why would kobolds depict on their<br/>
&gt;  walls their own demise?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Is it possible that these tunnels were created by goblins?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  And the goblins had a war with the fire giants and nagafen,<br/>
&gt;  lost and retreated?  Then the kobolds came and took over this<br/>
&gt;  area?  It would explain why there are so many paintings about<br/>
&gt;  the white creatures (goblins).  Still there are many<br/>
&gt;  inconsistancies.  Maybe the goblins conquered the previous<br/>
&gt;  kobold king.<br/>
