<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If we were to generate a petition, I think more important issues should be<br/>
&gt;covered:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Where the hell are our missing songs?!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh ok no comment on that one. Since I havent missed any yet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) Why do half our skills cap at such a ridiculously low level that they<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t even worth using?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am unsure what skills youre talking about, but Forage, hide and sneak comes to<br/>
mind.<br/>
Forage - Imo it is working okay. It might be a bit tedius to keep hitting that<br/>
button, but if I do I am able to forage plenty of food and almost enough water.<br/>
I must admit that I dont do it anymore, but tend to buy my food. Maybe they<br/>
should change the forage skill so it have a even longer delay, but a higher<br/>
succes rate?<br/>
To sum it up. The amount of food you can forage seems ok to me, but the process<br/>
is a bit tedius.<br/>
<br/>
Hide - Well this one you need another person around to use for anything. If you<br/>
do have one around its ok when going afk.<br/>
<br/>
Sneak- IMO its useless. I havent spent much time using it for real. Because I<br/>
have a hard time finding out how it works<br/>
1. When I move slower is that a gurantee that it works?<br/>
2. Is the duration limited?<br/>
3. Is there mobs who can see through it.<br/>
<br/>
Well I am more confident using invisio or fight my way through.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3) Is our level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody broken?  If not, what<br/>
&gt;the hell is it supposed to do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wasent that the one that you needed to target the mob to get the effect?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4) Why do certain of our songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike) work find against<br/>
&gt;monsters, but have absolutely no effects verses players in duels?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IMO they should work in duels!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;5) Why do our songs get stuck due to lag, or when magical effects wear off<br/>
&gt;(i.e. Guise of the Deciever)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I havent had this for a while, but when it did happen I just pressed a song<br/>
hotkey repeatly and it became unstuck rather fast.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;6) Why the $#%@#$ does my drum still look like a small wooden twig?  And why<br/>
&gt;does a mino horn now look like a small burlap sack?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah!! FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;7) How about some high level bard quests?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m sorry if this sounds a little harsh, but I&#39;m sick and tired of seeing<br/>
&gt;petition after petition saying &quot;my monk should get bind&quot; or &quot;my wizard<br/>
&gt;should be able to wear plate armor&quot;.  In my opinion, Bards are the most<br/>
&gt;versitile class in the game, and the most fun to play.  We have more<br/>
&gt;abilities than anyone else, and we get to use one of the widest ranges of<br/>
&gt;equipment in the game.  Please stop trying to make this class into something<br/>
&gt;it was never meant to be, and play your bard as it was meant to be played.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I am getting tired of all the bitching about classes being unbalanced.<br/>
Every class is doing this, but IMO the only ones who can be somewhat justified<br/>
are rogues and as poison skills and more locks, traps and stuff are implemented<br/>
their arguments are falling as well.<br/>
 Some of the things i would like to see is some class related quests and<br/>
equipment. I know that this is something that every class wants more of nomatter<br/>
what there is availible allready. I do however think that bards are lacking some<br/>
weapons esp. if the rumors about some bard/rougue items going rogue only now are<br/>
true.<br/>
Then I htink it would be very nice (and appropiate) with something like &quot;Kelin&#39;s<br/>
stringed dagger&quot; (The piercing mandoline) or &quot;Selo&#39;s warhammer of drumming&quot;.<br/>
These could very well be implemented as rewards for quests?<br/>

P.S. Excuse my less than perfect english skills, but english is a second<br/>
language... and i am in bit of a rush to get this out<br/>
