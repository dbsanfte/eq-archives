<div id="ygrps-yiv-824255103">Don&#39;t think the server I am on (E&#39;ci) has gone down for the scheduled server<br/>
maintenance Abashi mentioned.  Haven&#39;t noticed any downloaded files either.<br/>
Kitasi and I play on the same server so thats why I was wondering if the<br/>
patch went in unannounced.<br/>
