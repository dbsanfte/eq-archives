Fast tip: play, at least 2 and 3 if you can, songs at the same time.  Lots<br/>
of bard songs over lap - so make the most of what you have.  Anthem and<br/>
Warsong go together really well - Warsong is your musical FBSS (same haste<br/>
effect in the song as in the sash - if you have both - your wep speed will<br/>
be at the maximum.)<br/>
<br/>
And learn about the &quot;all instrument attack&quot; - at various stages in your life<br/>
as a bard, your songs and instruments can/will do more damage than melee<br/>
weapons.  You need to set up hot keys and learn how to switch from one<br/>
instrument to another while switching from one song to another. Sounds<br/>
tricky but once your get the knack, you will be amazed!<br/>
<br/>
From 15 to low 20&#39;s is a great time to be a bard.  Early 20&#39;s is painful but<br/>
gets better when you get snare, fear, charm & pixie in the late 20&#39;s.  Then<br/>
the landmark 32 for clarity song.  Then 35 for tracking is excellent.  Then<br/>
46 when you get out of that hellish 45!  And 50 is still an excellent ding!<br/>
By then you wil lhave killed a few dragons and slain some gods and their<br/>
minions and have some excellent instruments and weapons.  At 50, with dragon<br/>
& planes instruments, you can do 1800 dmg per minute or more.<br/>
<br/>
Bards can do really well with partners - your heal song is great for melee<br/>
class who hate the long downtimes: warriors, rogues, etc.  You might want to<br/>
team up down in Oasis playing heal song and haste songs and kill off the<br/>
corrupt crocks and caimens.<br/>
<br/>
So again - welcome and good luck and good hunting!  Keep us posted and fire<br/>
away with any questions you need answered.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] How did you play when you were 15th?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi guys, I&#39;m new to this list and I was hoping I could get a little advice<br/>
&gt; on play tactics. I have a 15th level bard as my secondary character and<br/>
he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an awesome change from my ranger and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to play<br/>
&gt; him most effectivly. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting orcs in Crushbone by<br/>
meleeing<br/>
&gt; them and bellowing at them, it seemed to be working better than bringing<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; Anthem for it&#39;s haste factor. I tried using the 15th level song to mez<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; but it didn&#39;t seem to buy me anything in combat, it did help me escape a<br/>
&gt; training one afternoon though. Is there another way I should be playing<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; encounters? Is there any place you&#39;d recomend that would be hungry for a<br/>
&gt; bard to group at my level?<br/>
