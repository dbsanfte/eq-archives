<div id="ygrps-yiv-595741133">Uldar, you are TOO funny!! I&#39;ve felt this way for about half the posts on <br/>
here. No one talks common anymore; (for all you STRICT rp&#39;ers out there, <br/>
that&#39;s English is.)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone, please make an attempt to make things simple for people like Uldar <br/>
and myself who don&#39;t go on suicide missions in SolB at level 20 or 35, <br/>
therefore having no idea what RL (real life) basis you&#39;re using.<br/>
<br/>
On the behalf of the lower and clueless out there, we thank you! =) Maybe <br/>
now we&#39;ll understand more of what is being said, get more out of the posts, <br/>
and avoid deleting all posts from certain senders who elminate some of <br/>
his/her audience by the language, jargon, and/or text they use. Thank you <br/>
all!<br/>

Hey Hamonic, I would like to say &quot;Oh! yeah, all the way to Djarn huh?<br/>
and from the bat cave too? wow.&quot; But I have no Idea what you are talking <br/>
about, and If I don&#39;t then I&#39;m sure a lot of others don&#39;t too. Do you mean a <br/>
LOOONG way or just a little way? Can they track Bandl McMarrin from <br/>
Permafrost, or maybe just Captain silverwind from the bank in Kelethin? Give <br/>
us a scale to measure that you don&#39;t have to be 40th to go by :)<br/>
