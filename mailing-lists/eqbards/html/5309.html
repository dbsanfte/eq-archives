<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047944571">I am a 35th Rank Bard on Bertox, and I was blasting across West Commonlands<br/>
two days again with my Mistmoore Battle Drums.  I stop right before the zone<br/>
border, and a GM runs up to me and tells me that he had been trying to catch<br/>
me all the way through West Commons and could not gain on me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe all GM&#39;s are not created equal?  All I know is I felt pretty good when<br/>
he said that!<br/>
