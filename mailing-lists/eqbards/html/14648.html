against a mix of &quot;high&quot; green and low blue mobs had a<br/>
secondary resist rate of 53%.  My cleric friend healed me 4 or<br/>
5 times I think.  If I find myself in more of these<br/>
train-stopping situations with my group willing to derail it,<br/>
I will certainly turn on my logfile.  You folks can do the<br/>
same too.  All I did was use the Unix grep -c command to count<br/>
how many times &quot;nods&quot; appeared (N+r), how many times<br/>
&quot;mesmerize&quot; appeared (r), and how many times &quot;Lucid&quot; appeared<br/>
(R).<br/>

a different mob (probably L1 snakes or rats in Freeport) to<br/>
pre-emtively disprove the excuse that Butcherblock snakes are<br/>
special.<br/>
