<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925301196">I&#39;d have to agree it is a heat problem.  I have almost an identical system<br/>
just a creative graphics blaster card instead of the voodoo.  I currently<br/>
have one of the best fan/heatsink combo on my chip that I could find<br/>
on-line, I forget the name of it now but it is a dual fan.  I also have two<br/>
40mm exhaust fans, one 40mm intake fan, some expansion slots open in the<br/>
rear of the system (for extra air intake) and a fan on the video card . . .<br/>
and I still have a hot system.  You can get cooling advise from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.overclockers.com/">http://www.overclockers.com/</a> .  I am currently building a variation of the<br/>
venting system they have on the site ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.overclockers.com/tips285">http://www.overclockers.com/tips285</a><br/>
).  If you can&#39;t find the advise you need on that site, it ain&#39;t out there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a celeron 300 overclocked at 466 running on an abit bh6 or bx6 mother<br/>
&gt;board for about 2 years now runnin on win98. Run a voodoo 3000 vid card and<br/>
&gt;an sb live, oh and a 1* 128meg sim of 100mhz ram.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s my problem, I pretty much only play EQ, check email and surf.  Lately<br/>
&gt;i&#39;ve had a few solid lockups playing eq, some crashes to desktop as well.<br/>
&gt;Yesterday i got 2 in 10-15 minutes and the day before i died while kiting<br/>
&gt;due to this (grrr)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyways, I tried deinstalling EQ, reinstalling EQ, RoK and SoV.  While<br/>
&gt;reinstalling SoV, total lockup again.  This indicated to me that probably my<br/>
&gt;pc is overheating or something.  Another thing i&#39;ve noticed while playing is<br/>
&gt;that my graphics seem to be choppier than normal (more vid lag, and its not<br/>
&gt;swarmcaller) (which indicates to me processing problems).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So... Tonight I&#39;m going to probably rip the pc open, check if my fan is<br/>
&gt;still working, if it is i&#39;ll proceed to downclock the cpu back to 300 like<br/>
&gt;its supposed to be.  If my pc is still acting up from there i&#39;ll reinstall<br/>
&gt;win98 (arg i hate doing this, takes forever with all my apps).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the prob may be, I have a<br/>
&gt;feeling my cpu might be nearing retirement but i&#39;m really hoping this isnt<br/>
&gt;the case because i dont have the cash to buy a new chip/board cause that<br/>
&gt;would run me about 350$ canadian for a 700mhz/board<br/>
