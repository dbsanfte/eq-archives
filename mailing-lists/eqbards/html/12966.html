I agree.  I usually find myself joining pickup groups.  What I have found is<br/>
that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>
considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the problem<br/>
is<br/>
magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when I<br/>
play<br/>
its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull turns<br/>
bad<br/>
and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far<br/>
away,<br/>
the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the<br/>
casters<br/>
leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back to<br/>
the<br/>
zone they died in.  <br/>
<br/>
I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this into<br/>
consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.  I<br/>
think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play<br/>
with<br/>
all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs personal<br/>
welfare.  <br/>
