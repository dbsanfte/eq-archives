<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430375301">same here.  myself and 2 friends in town all started day one, and grouped up<br/>
to level 16 together.  then they switched servers, though even then i am<br/>
sure my solo time is extremely minimal since.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a special case.  My wife started her first character, a <br/>
&gt; warrior, when I<br/>
&gt; started my bard and my brother-in-law started his third character, a<br/>
&gt; Paladin, all at the same time.  I did levels 1 through 5 <br/>
&gt; grouped with them.<br/>
&gt; My first character is a retired level 21 mage that I haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; logged on with<br/>
&gt; in months and consider retired. </span></blockquote></div>
