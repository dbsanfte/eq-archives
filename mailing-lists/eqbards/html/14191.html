There is a way to raise your faction with most guild of Erudin. Just<br/>
yesterday I picked up my Gloves of the Gatecaller (Looks like Blackened Iron<br/>
Gloves, for caster) but your faction has to be Amiable at the least with<br/>
Erudin. I decided to camp Elial Brook (Level 6-7 Erudite Necromancer) for<br/>
the entire level 8 (took me 3 hours). I thought the faction would be small,<br/>
but almost everyone in Erudin looked at me warmly... which not even my home<br/>
city and Magician guild in Qeynos does (they look at me Amiable) So I am no<br/>
a good friend of the citizens of Erudin. =) This faction May or May not help<br/>
you with the quest without starting a very un-common combo, Erudite Paladin.<br/>
Also, when I Hailed the Magician leader about the quest, my faction was<br/>
Aprehensive. I killed Elial Brook about 50-60 times, he spawns every 7-10<br/>
minutes and summons a level 4-5 Skeleton Pet. Hope this helps. <br/>

		&gt; &gt;I hope this isn&#39;t too off topic.  I was hoping to do this<br/>
<br/>
		&gt; quest but can&#39;t<br/>
		&gt; &gt;get my faction high enough with the Deepwater Knights in <br/>
		&gt; Erudin to get the<br/>

		&gt; &gt;used the Charismatic Carillon to get me up to indifferent<br/>
<br/>
		&gt; but that is as<br/>
		&gt; &gt;High as I can go.<br/>
		&gt; &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>		I tried this a while back and ran into the same problem you<br/>
did. I ran all<br/>
		around Tox forest killing creatures to see if I could raise<br/>
my faction, but<br/>
		there were none and those dang kobolds kept &#39;porting away<br/>
from me every time<br/>
		I hit them(buggy). There&#39;s no real quests that I saw for<br/>
this, but I did<br/>
		read a solution to doing it, it&#39;s not really a kosher way of<br/>
completing the<br/>
		quest. People just made an Erudite Paladin and after killing<br/>
the shark would<br/>
		log back in with the &quot;mule&quot;, loot and then complete the<br/>
quest. :-P<br/>
<br/>
		I basically decided not to do it and have stuck to the<br/>
bronze breastplate<br/>
		that I have. I&#39;m just a lute short of getting a lambent<br/>
breastplate so I&#39;m<br/>
		not as motivated to complete this quest as I once was.<br/>
