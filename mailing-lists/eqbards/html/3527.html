 </span></blockquote>Good luck with your theory here...Im a half-elf bard on Cazic-Thule.  Level<br/>
17 (for me) was the most difficult level I have faced with any of my<br/>
characters.  My dual wield skill was low, and I think it hurt more than it<br/>
helped.   After many frustrating nights, I finaly leveled.  I had to go hang<br/>
out with the powergamers in HH where the orcs spawn to do it, tho. I fought<br/>
in EKarana, SKarana, Unrest, and a few other places.  I would solo blue<br/>
reavers, but then I would die every now and then, and lose more exp than I<br/>
gained.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, I have discovered Permafrost, and blasted through level 18 in<br/>
one night...I can now solo again fairly effectively because my skills are up<br/>
now.  My advice to you:  Group heavily at level 17 and try to get through it<br/>
as fast as you can!<br/>
