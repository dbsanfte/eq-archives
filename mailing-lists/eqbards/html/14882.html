<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025187129">supposedly its an evil city for necros and SKs.  you can now start an<br/>
erudite SK and the character starts in paineel.  its on the test server but<br/>
not yet optimized or something.  The Hole is the zone on toxxulia that<br/>
should be a somewhat high-level dungeon.<br/>

&gt; &gt;In case no one has tried today to use the optional patch <br/>
&gt; button, give it a <br/>
&gt; &gt;push!  It seems that Verant has uploaded Paineel onto the <br/>
&gt; patch server.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t know what their plans were for this area, but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; assuming its for <br/>
&gt; &gt;upper levels. </span></blockquote></div>
