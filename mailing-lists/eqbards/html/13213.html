<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571296151"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Only problem with this, is that riposte requires parry.  As i have<br/>
&gt; had it explained to me in the past, the only time you get a riposte<br/>
&gt; check is after a successful parry/block.  So in essence, you are<br/>
&gt; asking for 2 skills =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you sure about this?  I&#39;ve never played a character up to riposte level,<br/>
but I&#39;ve fought a lot of mobs that riposte.  The message is always:<br/>
<br/>
You try to crush EvilWhozit, but EvilWhozit ripostes!<br/>
<br/>
Then immediately after, EvilWhozit gets a chance to attack, and I get the<br/>
normal attack message.  I have never seen a parry/block/dodge message<br/>
accompanying the riposte message.<br/>
<br/>
The way I understand it is that riposte involves BOTH evading the attack AND<br/>
getting a chance at another attack.  A successful riposte will always block<br/>
the attack a la dodge and parry, but it will not always let you get in an<br/>
attack.  But my warrior is only level 17 so I can&#39;t say for certain.</div>
