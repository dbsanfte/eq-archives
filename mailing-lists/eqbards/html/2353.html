<div id="ygrps-yiv-947626981">Find a Mob that cons blue to you - I used the bandits in lesser fay for<br/>
this and brought my piercing up to around 40 from 0 with them - and maxed<br/>
out my dual skill - dodging and defense as well at 17.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry bout the kill - find a group that&#39;s a little above their heads<br/>
- let them get the kills, the loot, the xp - YOU are after skillgain.<br/>
<br/>
If you are using something that isn&#39;t gonna do much damage - you will help<br/>
them - increase your skill, they don&#39;t die so much, get the loot and the<br/>
levels they need.<br/>
<br/>
To me - that&#39;s win&#39;/win all the way round.<br/>

&gt;Hail bards of Norrath:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts about keeping all your skills maxed so you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;pay for it later on and this seems like sound advice. My question is how do <br/>
&gt;you do it? I have switched off between 1H slash, 1H blunt, pierce and HtoH <br/>
&gt;and now I am back about 15 points from my cap on all of them. I level before <br/>
&gt;I can get even one of them up to my cap. Will this change as leveling gets <br/>
&gt;harder or am I &#39;chasing the goose&#39;? Thanks in advance,<br/>
