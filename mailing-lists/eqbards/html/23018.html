Seriously, well it prolly won&#39;t make YOU feel better but I just checked<br/>
Hally and she is at 128 days... a &quot;friend&quot; calculated this in months and<br/>
well, lets just say I considered quitting EQ and being more productive.  But<br/>
then I realized that would probably entail a week of cleaning and exercise<br/>
only to end up with me in front of the couch or spending money going out<br/>
again...<br/>
<br/>
So in addition to days played, I think we should also include how much money<br/>
EQ has saved us over the last two years :)<br/>
