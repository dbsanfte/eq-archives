&gt; That&#39;s 1 dungeon.  Sure there will be other zones.  But I&#39;d rather not give<br/>
&gt; Verant the idea to give us _just_ charm animal.  We _deserve_ an upgrade to<br/>

(their own damn fault - every time they tweak mobs to make<br/>
them more powerful than players, it makes charm, and pets,<br/>
more powerful).  So as a class that is a mediocre tank and can<br/>
&quot;cast&quot; while on the move, I doubt they&#39;ll give us a straight<br/>
upgrade to charm.<br/>
<br/>
The problem they&#39;ll have is there isn&#39;t much room between<br/>
charm and mez for some method of mob control.  If they give us<br/>
a mez that works, it&#39;ll basically be admission that they&#39;re<br/>
not going to fix the mez we already have.<br/>
