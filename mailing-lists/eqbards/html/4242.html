<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059606033">I&#39;ve been playing with charm a lot lately (wonderful for<br/>
pulling a mob off someone it&#39;s frenzied against), and I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed a recurring problem.  Sometimes the mob you charm will<br/>
attack a player (a party member in all cases so far) and will<br/>
not stop despite repeated commands to sit down, follow me, or<br/>
attack another mob.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been able to reproduce this at will, but I *think*<br/>
this happens when I charm a mob, order it to attack another<br/>
mob, it becomes uncharmed, a party member attacks it, and I<br/>
re-charm it.  I know it&#39;s not the command failing because the<br/>
charmed mob says the appropriate things but keeps right on<br/>
attacking.  Does anyone know what&#39;s up with this?<br/>
<br/>
We were almost killed by a cyclops last night because a stupid<br/>
kodiak tagged along and I wasted time trying to charm it to<br/>
take it out of the fight and it kept right on attacking.  <br/>
(OTOH my ranger friend was absolutely ecstatic when the<br/>
cyclops frenzied on him, got him down to one bubble as the<br/>
cleric went OOM, and I charmed the cyclops to pull it off<br/>
him.)<br/>
