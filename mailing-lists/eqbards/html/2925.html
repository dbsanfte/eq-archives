<div id="ygrps-yiv-549393271">Heyo fellow loremasters!<br/>
<br/>
	I was looking for info on the Shimmering Orb.  I heard it is found<br/>
in Upper Guk, but have no idea where.  That place is huge!  Any info on this<br/>
would be appreciated.  Also, what am I supposed to do with this stupid<br/>
Bloodforge Hammer?  I swear, you help a dwarf out, get him his vengeance and<br/>
the little twerp gives ya a really heavy cool magic weapon ya can&#39;t possibly<br/>
use.  What&#39;s up with that?  Must be some kinda dwarf joke on us poor wood<br/>
elves.  So some info on the Orb would be great, surely someone must know<br/>
more than I.  And, if ya got a friend looking for a big hammer on E&#39;ci, give<br/>
me a tell.<br/>
<br/>

as far as casters you are fighting not getting interrupted much, they<br/>
probably have a higher channeling skill than a player caster at the same<br/>
level, just as they can punch or slash for so much more.  channeling is what<br/>
allows a caster to continue casting a spell even while getting hit.  plus<br/>
the other mobs you are fighting may have a bash or stun skill that is a lot<br/>
higher than a player tank at the same level (not to sure how these melee<br/>
skills work, i just started a paladin and have never played anything other<br/>
than bard or wizard).<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t know why i answered i don&#39;t even know what i just said =P  i&#39;m still<br/>
waking up and bored to death at work.<br/>

&gt; While I too would love to be able to have 2 Demon Claws <br/>
&gt; because I think it<br/>
&gt; would look cool, I am becoming more and more convinced that weapons of<br/>
&gt; varrying speeds make little difference when combatting spellcasters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /RANT<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been hanging out in Cazic Thule for a few weeks, and we <br/>
&gt; get our fair<br/>
&gt; share of casters there. It amazes me, day after day, how a <br/>
&gt; low level mob (to<br/>
&gt; us) can sustain over 100 points of damage in a split second, <br/>
&gt; and STILL get<br/>
&gt; their spells off 90% of the time, while a bard is bashed for <br/>
&gt; a single point<br/>
&gt; of damage and their song ends, or a spellcaster is smacked <br/>
&gt; for as single<br/>
&gt; point of damage and their spell is interrupted. Is this <br/>
&gt; something Verant did<br/>
&gt; to &quot;give the monsters a chance&quot;? Kinda like how a low level <br/>
&gt; mob can smack<br/>
&gt; you for 55 points of damage with a single swing, while we <br/>
&gt; bards probably<br/>
&gt; will never be able to dish out that type of damage, even when <br/>
&gt; our levels<br/>
&gt; approach the 40&#39;s?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And does anyone know how &quot;stunning&quot; works? It seems like <br/>
&gt; whenever I am hit,<br/>
&gt; I am auto-stunned half the time, whether it was for 50 <br/>
&gt; points, or 1 point of<br/>
&gt; damage I receive. Does it have anything to do with my armor? <br/>
&gt; With my Stamina<br/>
&gt; or Strength scores? Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /RANT OFF<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for the rant, it&#39;s the only thing I can think of to <br/>
&gt; complain about!<br/>
&gt; (smile)<br/>
