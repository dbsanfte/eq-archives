<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064969601">Had an interesting adventure last nite.  One of our party wandered too close<br/>
to an Evil Eye and got charmed.  Spent the next 15 minutes as the Evil Eye&#39;s<br/>
pets.  Killed a few unsuspecting players, just wished I coulda seen the look<br/>
on players faces to see an Evil Eye trailing three teens characters as pets<br/>
all around e karana.  Unfortunately i was the last one to be its pet.  got<br/>
booted just after i was uncharmed and reappeared on login at a different<br/>
part of the zone and minus the weapons i had been wielding.  No idea what<br/>
happened there, but at least it was only a parrying dagger and a FS<br/>
longsword. Not that I can afford to replace that either, but at least i know<br/>
its readily available once i get some coin.<br/>
