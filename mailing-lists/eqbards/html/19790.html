<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047693267">While I haven&#39;t done or even started that quest yet, I have an awful<br/>
feeling you won&#39;t get much luck in your response.  If it&#39;s like the<br/>
other quests I&#39;ve done, there should have been a &quot;Combine&quot; button when<br/>
you opened the box that you need to press before handing it over to<br/>
the NPC, just like when doing trade skills.  The combine will take all<br/>
the bits and pieces and just convert it into the actual quest item the<br/>
NPC wants.  If you didn&#39;t do that, that will be why it failed. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if there isn&#39;t a combine button it may be bugged after all!<br/>

&gt;what order the coins are inserted in the box?  In hind-sight the NPC said I<br/>
&gt;need to &quot;Combine&quot; them in the box.  Is &quot;Combining&quot; something special I<br/>
&gt;needed to do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	While it would be nice to expect a response from Verant - I&#39;m guessing I<br/>
&gt;can get another set of the coins before I get a response from my email.<br/>
