(quite possibly both)...and it explains where this portal might lead as<br/>
well...(How I wish I were high enough level to explore this place now&lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I read an interview with Brad and they asked him if artifacts are in the<br/>
game yet....he said that they are in the game, but not &quot;in the<br/>
game&quot;...meaning that people have not found any yet.  He did say that you<br/>
would not find any artifacts on critters, but rather, you would have to do<br/>
an extrordinary deed to get them...he also stated that some artifacts would<br/>
be so rare that there might only be one between ALL the servers...(not even<br/>
one per server)...if this is the case, I would bet that these items are<br/>
very, very powerful. (I&#39;ll try to locate the link...if anyone has it, please<br/>
post it).<br/>

&gt;&gt; Well, remember the place.  Did you find the area with another structure<br/>
&gt;&gt; guards by two ice bones?  If you enter it, you will be teleported back<br/>

&gt;If you&#39;re impatient, skip down about 3/4ths of the way till you see the<br/>

&gt;Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network<br/>
&gt;of tunnels and rooms [...]<br/>
