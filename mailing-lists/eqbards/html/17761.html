<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-407628673">This happened to two friends of mine on the same zone, its likely<br/>
they were taking damage at zone time.  They were zoning from Highpass <br/>
into Kith this AM.  A warrior and a cleric.<br/>
<br/>
It also happened to me zoning from E Commons to W Commons.<br/>
<br/>
They dropped into a random place in Kithicor (at night) and being<br/>
mid-teens were promptly slaughered by undead. :(<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t on yet, and a necro did a corpse locate for them from<br/>
*inside* the tunnel to zone and told them they must be &quot;in the wall&quot;<br/>
since thats how he was facing.  &lt;gah&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I got on I was able to find thier corpses (and it was day).  But thats<br/>
three cases in the last 24 hours ... new bug?<br/>
