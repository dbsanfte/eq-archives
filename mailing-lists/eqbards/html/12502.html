<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853742744">Well on Vox the biggest thing is you must stop her from healing.  Your tanks <br/>
need to be slamming/bashing like crazy.  That mean they give up that <br/>
secondary weapon and use a shield.  Nothing is worse then seeing Vox down to <br/>
a silver only to have her get off a complete heal, arrrrggghhhhhhhhh :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; they finally got vox down.  obviously we&#39;re not slamming you Harm, just<br/>
&gt; &gt; rethink the resist theory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   not taken that way, I asked for the advice, just also shared my<br/>
&gt;   thoughts.  I will attempt to guide the next Vox raid, and will<br/>
&gt;   require minimum cold resistance and pick and choose the most<br/>
&gt;   elite of the server group (30 people, since we are learning).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Since we are sharing ideas, we should start a thread on dragon<br/>
&gt;   ideas that work.  We cleared the whole cavern out except Vox,<br/>
&gt;   perfectly.  It&#39;s just Vox made an unexpected appearance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>
