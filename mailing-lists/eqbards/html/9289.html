<b>Subject:</b> What class does GZ play? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138584218">I&#39;m hoping to finally hit level 50 within the next week or so, and I decided<br/>
to do a little reading up on other classes to see if there&#39;s something else<br/>
I&#39;d like to play.  I was on the Shaman&#39;s Crucible, and came across an<br/>
interview they had with GZ.  Found this question interesting. . . <br/>
<br/>
TSC: Alright, now time to take that mask off... What class/race are you<br/>
currently having the most fun playing? <br/>
GZ: I have got to say that I love my 1/2 elf Bard - but mostly because when<br/>
I play, I am a very social player. Bards are good at being social. In fact,<br/>
I built them to be so. This is my current one - I have played a lot of EQ,<br/>
and tend to change my opinion every few weeks. <br/>
