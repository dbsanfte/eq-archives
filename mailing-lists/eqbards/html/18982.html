<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089362170">Compared to what it was - yes, I guess so but I spent 8 hours yesterday in<br/>
Sebilis with a full group (granted there were 2 54&#39;s, another who became 54,<br/>
1 53, 1 52 and me 51) for 1 bubble of exp. (sigh)  We cleared our way in<br/>
past &quot;the pyramid&quot; and camped the 4 named spawn spots and the Emperor&#39;s<br/>
guard&#39;s and the Emperor (who must be the one with no clothes or armor<br/>
because I have fought tougher blues than this guy who somehow is level 60 -<br/>
Infectious Cloud? don;t make me sneeze!)<br/>
<br/>
We got some spells and some weps and some armor and a visit from a guide.<br/>
&quot;Hey do you guys need a key to open that door?&quot;  We were using a a rogue to<br/>
pick it.  Wonder if a nerf for the door and a buff for the Emp will be in<br/>
today&#39;s patch.  We were in Seb from 1pm central time until 9pm and were the<br/>
only group in the place.<br/>
<br/>
When we broke in, we cleared to the first bridge and were fighting a froog<br/>
when a Shroom (myconid warrior? reever?) appeared out of nowhere. He got<br/>
messed and we kept fighting.  Then another shroom. And another, and another<br/>
and we ran back to the zone for ease of CR.  Some managed to camp out,<br/>
cleric gated, a few died inc me.  But my question is - what causes these<br/>
Shrooms to agro?  This is the second time I have seen this in this same spot<br/>
with about the same results. And we were careful not to use an AE - just<br/>
doing the normal kill froog thing.  Anyone know?  Anyone been to the lower<br/>
levels in Seb?<br/>
