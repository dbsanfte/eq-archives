This reminds me of some clerics who say &quot;...only the tanks get symbol<br/>
buffs...&quot; Now what kinda logic is that?  Your casters have the lowest hp/ac<br/>
and so who do you decide to help first?  The ones with the most hp/ac???<br/>
Pretty dumb is you ask me - same deal with this loot - damn good item for<br/>
bard&#39;s and because they are weaker &#39;need&#39; these items more - sheesh.  <br/>

		One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a<br/>
vein in my<br/>
		forehead.<br/>
		It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed<br/>
Bolster Belt.<br/>
		This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste<br/>
effect. The<br/>
		question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given<br/>
their melee<br/>
		abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant<br/>
designed us.. if I<br/>
		had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the<br/>
game<br/>
		(Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt.<br/>
Surely the item<br/>
		would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or<br/>
ranger. But is<br/>
		a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all<br/>
think?<br/>
