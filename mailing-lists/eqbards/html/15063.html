<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855272530">Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the &quot;Hide&quot; skill. It is<br/>
&gt; called &quot;Evade&quot;. This skill has the effect of lowering the amount that the<br/>
&gt; targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential of making the engaged<br/>
&gt; NPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) within the rogue&#39;s group.<br/>
&gt; It is essentially a &quot;reverse taunt&quot;. This ability helps mitigate the<br/>
&gt; negative effects of the rogue&#39;s exceedingly high damage-output potential. It<br/>
&gt; also will in-turn help the rogue do even more damage as the NPC is much more<br/>
&gt; likely to expose its back. It is engaged by targeting the NPC you wish to<br/>
&gt; &quot;Evade&quot; and pressing the &quot;Hide&quot; button. As a note, you must not be in combat<br/>
&gt; mode in order to use this ability.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ohoh....I bet my rogue friends will hate me once again because they<br/>
cannot evade while I sing a song!<br/>
And btw aren&#39;t the sneak/hide buttons inactive too when you get a hit?<br/>
<br/>
I hope they tested it...<br/>
