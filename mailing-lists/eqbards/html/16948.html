<b>Subject:</b> Hate armor drops increased? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944251352">I have parked in Hate for over a week now, and I have had fairly good luck getting<br/>
into groups.<br/>
<br/>
Last Monday night I died something like 8 times.  I was still smiling a the end of<br/>
the night though, because gauntlets dropped and the only other bard there had them<br/>
already.  That made 3 pieces for me; I already had legs and one bracer (from Fear<br/>
haha).  I was told arms had dropped earlier that day, and decayed =(.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday we had good groups and good pulling.  I quit out only once, and we had very<br/>
few deaths.  On one pull the warrior who was chain pulling saw the train coming,<br/>
waved us all back into the corner, and ate the death.  *loud applause*  What a great<br/>
example of knowing your role and making quick, sound judgements.<br/>
<br/>
After we cleared roamers we go a scorn banshee pull.  It dropped boots!  There were<br/>
three of us; one already had boots; I lost the roll.  And I sat there and thought to<br/>
myself, oh now let the clumpy random number generator work its magic (wished on John<br/>
Kim for luck haha)!  A couple more pulls, then another scorn banshee, and my group<br/>
got the kill.  They said &quot;Mara go ahead and look...&quot;  Boots again!  A couple more<br/>
pulls...another scorn banshee...and a bracer for the third bard there.<br/>
<br/>
Last night they were full, so I didn&#39;t get to go up.  The banshees dropped two sets<br/>
of arms and the weapon.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, I don&#39;t know if they changed the drop rates but I hope it keep up!<br/>
<br/>
Arms and breastplate left to go for me (I will leave the scary helm wearing to Shada<br/>
haha).<br/>
