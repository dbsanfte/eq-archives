Shada, female wood elf in plate<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Ok well i am about to start my 47th eq character :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This time i might try a bard, and i had pretty well narrowed <br/>
&gt; the race down<br/>
&gt; to one of the 2 elves. I know all the pros and cons of each <br/>
&gt; race, so what i<br/>
&gt; was looking for here was what they look like in plate (yes i <br/>
&gt; am really that<br/>
&gt; vain :) )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if someone knew an url that had pictures of <br/>
&gt; the various<br/>
&gt; races in lambent, bronze, FS plate, imbrued etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had tried the fashion table at allakhazams, but the quality of the<br/>
&gt; screenshots isnt that good<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance<br/>
