&gt; The Cauldron is a bad idea for a Level 10. It is a bad idea for m at Level<br/>
&gt; 15 unless I have a pretty good group.<br/>

If you&#39;re on Faydwer, either fight in Crushbone (level 10 is sort of a weird<br/>
level for CB, since Centurions generally don&#39;t give you exp, but Legionnaires and<br/>
Slavers will kill you) or in Steamfont (great creatures there, skeles, earth<br/>
eles, drakes etc.).<br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t buy ringmail . . . buy banded armor. Much better, and probably<br/>
&gt; cheaper depending on the smith you get it from. As far as I know, makes<br/>
&gt; your character look exactly the same. I started buying my banded set when I<br/>
&gt; was Level 10 . . . completed it at Level 14 to the tune of about 120 plat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This depends on your size and location.  On Faydwer, size small ringmail is VERY<br/>
common, since it loads in Unrest on fairly low level monsters.  You can buy<br/>
ringmail for 4-10 plat a piece easily in BB and Unrest.  Banded will usually cost<br/>
you more, depending on the piece.  Banded is better though.<br/>
