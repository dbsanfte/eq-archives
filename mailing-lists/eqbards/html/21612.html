<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375401741">hmm, i guess this might work where you didn&#39;t have room to run, but it seems like<br/>
you&#39;d pretty much get your butt kicked while laying the chant on and then recharming.<br/>
if you&#39;re in an open space where there&#39;s room to back off and get a chant and recharm<br/>
before it hits you, i&#39;m almost positive it would be more efficient to either chant kite<br/>
or charm kite.  also, i&#39;m not positive on this, but i think charmed mobs regenerate<br/>
faster than noncharmed mobs, altho that may just have been an artifact of lag.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yep the Chant still has full effect on the charmed mob.  They basically just<br/>
&gt; &gt; sit there and wait to die.<br/>
