<div id="ygrps-yiv-802440625">I&#39;ve seen this stated a bunch...you&#39;ve never seen the code, correct?<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the interface interaction is incredibly Diku-like, but I imagine<br/>
this is similar to Bioware using the D&D game architecture, not the old Gold Box<br/>
code.<br/>
The game design is obviously based on Diku muds, but the code probably isn&#39;t.<br/>
After all, even adapting a Diku code base for a game like EQ would make it<br/>
pretty unrecognizable, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a monstrous package, but the amount of real game stopping bugs is very<br/>
minimal.  Mostly we get trivial bugs that reflect poorly thought out logistics,<br/>
not code.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, even Brian Hook said that they&#39;re a a talented bunch of programmers, and I<br/>
doubt you&#39;re unimpressed with his work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t mean this to be harsh, I just wonder what causes us to blame the<br/>
coders rather than the designers.<br/>
<br/>
Um, and that sign reversal thing does suck, btw.  You have a point there, but<br/>
I&#39;ve done stupid things like that in my code before, and I bet you have, too :P<br/>

Which means that A) They&#39;ve tinkered with the original Diku experience<br/>
tables (NEEDED!) and B) The Hell levels and the H+1 levels are either<br/>
extremely intentional or some collosolly bad coding.  I&#39;d personally support<br/>
either opinion equally.  I&#39;m not that impressed with Verant&#39;s programming<br/>
prowess.<br/>
