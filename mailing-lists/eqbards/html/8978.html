&gt; We spent a good four hours around there.  Is there a [new] trigger for<br/>
&gt; getting the Hero to spawn?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry if this has already been answered (I&#39;ve been away for a bit).  The only way to make the<br/>
hero spawn that I know of is to kill the skeletons who spawn in the set points behind the gear.<br/>
In particular, there is one spot where he spawns instead of a skeleton, and that is the &quot;niche&quot;<br/>
beside the big gear.   My gut feeling is that people have to be killing minotaurs too, but that<br/>
usually isn&#39;t a problem.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t spawn on a set schedule, that&#39;s for certain.  I&#39;ve seen times when he doesn&#39;t spawn<br/>
for days it seems, and other times, he seems to spawn every five minutes.  There was a period in<br/>
beta where I got killed by him 4 times in one 2 hour session.  (Different heros).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, kill him for me!<br/>
