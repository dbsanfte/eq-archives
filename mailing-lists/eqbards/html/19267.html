<br/>
I was in a guild group last week we found and killed the Chief. I just hope<br/>
I can describe the location to you.<br/>

At the back of the dungeon behind the Dining Room there is a large cave with<br/>
several side caves and awnings like in the market in Freeport.  One of the<br/>
side caves contains a lot of boxes and barrels, just near the box room is a<br/>
ramp leading up to a higher room overlooking the main room.<br/>
<br/>
The chief spawns here but seems fairly rare.<br/>
If you see bodyguards spawning you are in the right place. This whole area<br/>
is marked as the store room on some maps.<br/>
<br/>
He spawned once for us in 4 hours, and dropped a locket of escape - 1 charge<br/>
of Bind Affinity.<br/>
<br/>
Almost everything here was green to me at level 43 but there are a heck of a<br/>
lot of spawns and we found we had to keep the whole area clear, we could not<br/>
just fight in the chief room.<br/>
