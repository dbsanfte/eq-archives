Granted, it&#39;s very difficult to provide RolePlay Lore when there are so many<br/>
Duuuudz who wanna kill it and loot it.  But where is the incentive for<br/>
players to do otherwise? Where are the tools to facilitate GM events? And<br/>
they may not have the resources to make dynamic events actually work - ie<br/>
why bother if there is no money in it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very true, Sylly.  Verant has marketed EverQuest as a Massively Multiplayer<br/>
Online Roleplaying Game.  It&#39;s certainly MMO, but I&#39;m not so sure about the<br/>
RPG bit.<br/>
<br/>
Players in EQ don&#39;t roleplay.  The game has become (at most) Quake with<br/>
roleplaying elements between battles. &quot;Lawks, my good sir, thou didst surely<br/>
get a sound spanking from yonder Sarnak.  Prithee, I should heal thee.&quot;<br/>
Lore is hinted at in the game, but all the lore and history I&#39;ve read is on<br/>
*websites*!  Why?  In an interactive game such as this, we should have<br/>
access to the lore through libraries, NPCs and GMs.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no denying that cynical names such as EverCamp, EverLoot, EverFarm<br/>
etc etc have more than an element of truth about them.  If you ask someone<br/>
why they&#39;re going on a Dragon Raid, they&#39;ll undoubtedly answer along the<br/>
lines of &quot;um, because he drops the Horn of War, DUH!&quot; and not something like<br/>
&quot;I rallied my guildmates and these brave souls to slay Nagafen in revenge<br/>
for razing my home village to the ground and killing my family.  His death<br/>
shall be a relief to us all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
EverQuest has taken the capitalist side of real life and put it online.<br/>
There&#39;s some days I feel like a donkey chasing a carrot.  But like the<br/>
donkey, I don&#39;t have any particular reason to go after the carrot other than<br/>
&quot;it&#39;s there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, if you&#39;re happy with that, then welcome to their world.<br/>
<br/>
Think of any (good) P&P (pen and paper) RPG - Vampire: The Masquerade, SLA<br/>
Industries (wow!), Paranoia, Star Wars etc.  What do they all have in<br/>
common?  What&#39;s the one essential thing that makes them work?  STORIES!  And<br/>
GMs.  EQ GM-run events are largely a joke.  Sure, there&#39;s some interesting<br/>
plotlines thrown in, but we have no idea how it fits into the big picture.<br/>
It&#39;s like watching an old 50&#39;s serial show - if you missed last week&#39;s<br/>
episode, too bad; the story goes on without you, but you don&#39;t get the<br/>
two-minute recaps when you tune in next.<br/>
<br/>
I got hooked on EverQuest for what it promised, which it has delivered very<br/>
little of.  Add that to the ever-growing pile of carrots.<br/>
<br/>
I bought Vampire - Redemption last week.  It may not be MMO, but it&#39;s<br/>
*definitely* an RPG.  The sheer brilliance of being able to Storytell (GM)<br/>
online with a group beats anything EQ can do atm.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll continue to play EverQuest, mainly because I have friends in the UK who<br/>
play and it&#39;s a great way to keep in touch since I moved over here.<br/>
<br/>
And those carrots are addictive. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... carrots... that reminds me, it&#39;s lunchtime.  See y&#39;all inna bit. ;)</div>
