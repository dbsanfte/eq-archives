&gt;   If your party identifies which player is whacking them,<br/>
&gt;   charm them right back to your side and make them attack<br/>
&gt;   the Tae.  They are much more efficient under charm control,<br/>
&gt;   than they would be otherwise.  If they seem to break charm<br/>
&gt;   too quickly, drag them in a room, and tell them to sit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is a question I&#39;ve had too.  If a mob charms a player,<br/>
and you charm him back, what happens to the player when your<br/>
charm expires?  Does he become free from all charms, or (as<br/>
you seem to imply) he revert to being charmed by the mob?<br/>

&gt;   a 10 lizard train at the zoneline in 2 seconds.  While being<br/>
&gt;   swarmed in 4C, this song let me escape into the maze and back<br/>
&gt;   to the courtyard.  4 mob limits do not apply &#39;outdoors&#39; and<br/>
&gt;   cazicthule is considered outdoors.  My screen scrolled really<br/>
&gt;   bad with &#39;... flees in terror&#39; as a horde of lizards ran off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll have to test this in Guk, but I don&#39;t think there is a 4<br/>
mob limit.  The only 4 mob limit I&#39;ve seen is that at most, 4<br/>
mobs will be attacking you simultaneously.  If 4 are already<br/>
engaged, the rest will be aggor and facing you, but will not<br/>
attack.  This usually creates the illusion that your area<br/>
effect songs are only affecting 4 mobs, since the rest are<br/>
usually standing out of range.  However, if you physically<br/>
move so that more than 4 are in range, they will all be<br/>
affected.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * Lullaby.  I stopped using this song at level 16 when the novelity<br/>
&gt;   wore off.  Everytime I&#39;d play it, I would usually die.  Parties<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t understand how dangerous this song can be to the bard.<br/>
&gt;   But now I mem&#39;d it back in my song lineup, and at my level with<br/>
&gt;   a lute, jeez, I can put things to sleep instantly with very little<br/>
&gt;   resists.  Same as Screech in that I can nod off as many lizards <br/>
&gt;   that decide to show up, think I did 8 at once last night.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The most I&#39;ve confirmed is 11 (with one resist).  Someone was<br/>
talking about putting 20-30 gnolls to sleep in Blackburrow,<br/>
while a high level caster cast an area effect spell to kill<br/>
them all at once.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   As for blocking casters with this, you either have to be lucky<br/>
&gt;   or continue to strike them over and over.  If you see a judicator<br/>
&gt;   healing and you press your pixie button, you will almost never<br/>
&gt;   catch the lizard in time.  You will _never_ catch smites, they<br/>
&gt;   are too quick, and you probably wont ever catch wrath.  Twitching<br/>
&gt;   the button on a visual spell cue means you are too late.  Almost<br/>
&gt;   need to cycle pixie on one target to keep it in check.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I do - hit it over and over with Strike.  When it<br/>
takes, not only does it interrupt them, it puts them to sleep<br/>
until they&#39;re hit again.  That small pause in their activity<br/>
makes it more likely that your next Strike will catch them in<br/>
the middle of casting again.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Mage and pet are attacking a monster, and I charm it.  Sometimes<br/>
&gt;   the pet STILL has the monster on it&#39;s attack list and decides<br/>
&gt;   to attack ME the master of the monster.  I was beaten up very<br/>
&gt;   bad by a magician&#39;s own pet last night in cazicthule.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, bug it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Party is fighting a monster, and another shows up and I charm<br/>
&gt;   the new monster.  One party member turns to attack the new monster<br/>
&gt;   after charm wears off to &#39;pull it off me&#39; - but I charm it again.<br/>
&gt;   The monster now has the player who attacked it STILL in it&#39;s agro<br/>
&gt;   list.  And without me saying, /pet back off - the monster will <br/>
&gt;   continue to beat down that player.  In fact if I tell the pet<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but it too.<br/>
<br/>
Another bug is that if a monster decides to go somewhere<br/>
(flee, return to home position) and you charm it, it will<br/>
ignore your commands and keep going.  One of the AIs in<br/>
Mistmoore seems to be to return to the castle for<br/>
reinforcements.  I happened to catch a glyphed ghoul with a<br/>
shield returning from a train.  I charmed him to pull him to<br/>
my group (so that nobody could steal him), but he decided to<br/>
return to the castle.  I kept telling him /pet follow me and<br/>
over and over but he kept walking back to the castle.  I had<br/>
to zone because I knew he&#39;d turn aggro to me when uncharmed<br/>
and bring all his castle buddies after me.  I will have to try<br/>
/pet back off next time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   One more bubble til this hell ends...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Harmonic Distortion, 30th drummer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s two bubbles.  In 31 you lose about a bubble<br/>
when you die.  So until you have a bubble in 31, one death<br/>
will send you right back to 30.<br/>
