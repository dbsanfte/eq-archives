&gt; Recently, I was grouped with a necro who asked me to sing Jaxan&#39;s while she<br/>
&gt; was meditating.  She claimed to notice a *big* difference.  Now, I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; the discussions of how Jaxan&#39;s changes the meditation tick interval from<br/>
&gt; 8 seconds to 6 seconds, thereby increasing mana regeneration as a side effect.<br/>
&gt; However, the druid I usually group with has said that she doesn&#39;t notice<br/>
&gt; any difference.<br/>

affect client refreshes, and my conclusion now is that all the<br/>
Jig does is cause the meditator&#39;s client to refresh the<br/>
meditation bar at 6 second intervals instead of 8.  The rate<br/>
at which mana is regenerated is unchanged.<br/>
