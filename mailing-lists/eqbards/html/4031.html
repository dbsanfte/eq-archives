&gt;That&#39;s one of the things I really enjoy about this list too, it makes me<br/>
&gt;feel like less of a weirdo. I&#39;ve played bards in AD&D for about as long as<br/>

&gt;randomly group with people who say things like &quot;You bards kick ass&quot; or<br/>
&gt;&quot;Travelling with a bard in the party is a pleasure.&quot; Now if we could just<br/>
&gt;charm lots of mobs at lower levels I&#39;d be in heaven.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Okay on to more serious business. I completed the Ogre Head Quest in<br/>
&gt;Butcherblock last night by dropping off the heads of two named Ogres<br/>
&gt;(Corflunk and Zarcoomi) to Byzar Bloddforge in Kaladim. As a reward I<br/>
&gt;received a Blackened Iron Crown<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;which I thought was pretty nifty. This morning I was browsing Everlore and<br/>
&gt;someone had remarked that this item had been sold at auction for 250pp. I<br/>
&gt;just about passed out with dreams of avarice. Anyone have an idea if this<br/>

&gt;&gt; Well, one thing I like about this group is you all<br/>
&gt;&gt; actually LIKE playing a bard.  That may sound silly<br/>
&gt;&gt; but a lot of message boards out there are just<br/>
&gt;&gt; whinning about the class.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I had heard about the &#39;tauting&#39; effects of our<br/>
&gt;&gt; songs, but for the most part, it never bothered me,<br/>
&gt;&gt; sure I get the mobs attention, and even take a lot of<br/>
&gt;&gt; dammage, no biggie, just make nice with the cleric.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Well, after turning 21, Guk and Unrest have become<br/>
&gt;&gt; whole new places.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; First guk, near the scryer room my party of six where<br/>
&gt;&gt; bashing every froglock in sight, gaining massive exp<br/>
&gt;&gt; and loot.  So we say, what the heck, lets go in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; room.  Well, on knight comes after us, so I use my<br/>
&gt;&gt; melodic binding song that I love so much.  Big<br/>
&gt;&gt; mistake, from behind one of our tanks I saw no less<br/>
&gt;&gt; than 15 assorted froglocks come up the stairs, and who<br/>
&gt;&gt; do you think they were headed for?  Well, after about<br/>
&gt;&gt; 5 minutes of root, root, root, root, I was taking the<br/>
&gt;&gt; long walk back from freeport.  Get back, grab my<br/>
&gt;&gt; stuff, play anthem for my friends in battle, and what<br/>
&gt;&gt; do you think happened?  Again, I&#39;m dragged down under<br/>
&gt;&gt; a sea of amphibious flesh.  So after a while, I say,<br/>
&gt;&gt; heck, I&#39;ll head over to good ole unrest, what could be<br/>
&gt;&gt; safer?  Get there, find some good friends I could<br/>
&gt;&gt; trust, and we get to slayin undead.  One of the dry<br/>
&gt;&gt; bones makes a run for the house, silly bard that I am,<br/>
&gt;&gt; I chase him, again, still singing a song, forget which<br/>
&gt;&gt; one.  Withing seconds the doors fly open and carrion,<br/>
&gt;&gt; monks and the reclusive ghoul magi beeline right at<br/>
&gt;&gt; the wide eyed me, who didn&#39;t even have time to type in<br/>
&gt;&gt; a profanity.  So I come back from butchers block.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Fighting a while, see a wisp to the left of the house,<br/>
&gt;&gt; facing the back.  Someone in my guild needed a light<br/>
&gt;&gt; stone, so I run to grab it, while singing my little<br/>
&gt;&gt; anthem.  All of a sudden, the hag 3 floors up starts<br/>
&gt;&gt; casting on me from a window, and I wake up at home<br/>
&gt;&gt; among the trees.  That sucked.  Does this mean we<br/>
&gt;&gt; can&#39;t use any of our aoe or buffs anywhere near a<br/>
&gt;&gt; dungeon?  Well, at least my calves are built up from<br/>
&gt;&gt; zone running :)<br/>
