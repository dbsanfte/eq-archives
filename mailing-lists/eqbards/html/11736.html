&gt;<br/>
&gt; My personal opinion on the Guise change (i hope not inflamatory) :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that the guise change is a good one, but they should have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>retroactively<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; changed the old ones as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Verant has learned that changing existing items should only be done as a<br/>
last resort.  Some people have spent time or money, or traded valuable items<br/>
away to get their current Guise.  It would be completely unfair to take this<br/>
item away from them.  Remember the Box of Abu Kar (sp?).....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What they should have (and should do still) is<br/>
&gt; put in a Bar/Trl/Ogr item that has unlimited charges of shrink...something<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Moggok&#39;s bracer of not being a big fata**&quot; or some such nonsense.  The<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guise<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was intended to be Brd/Rog only.  They should also put in an ultravision<br/>
 </span></blockquote>item<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for da hummies.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are all good ideas for replacement items.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, i also think that if the Manastone is &quot;too Powerful&quot; it should be<br/>
&gt; removed entirely (maybe turn it into a diamond so that the people who<br/>
 </span></blockquote>camped<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for it get some ROI)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, do you take something away from someone who may have invested much<br/>
time and effort into getting?  I&#39;d say only if it was game inbalancing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While i&#39;m at it...JBoots should have to be worn to be used IMSO.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Leaving the old items on the people that already had it stratifies the EQ<br/>
&gt; population...Punishing those who did not start early, or were not lucky<br/>
 </span></blockquote>enough<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to acquire the items before they were removed.  In the case of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Manastone,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it makes casters (specifically clerics and druids) that have them better<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; those that don&#39;t, and with the manastone gone, the casters that don&#39;t have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; will always be &quot;inferior&quot; to those that do.  I realize this is kind of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>vague,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but this message is really long already....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that it&#39;s not completely fair,  It rewards the powergames who got<br/>
there first.  There is no perfect solution.  Verant now believes (as I do)<br/>
that items should not be taken from players who already have earned them.<br/>
