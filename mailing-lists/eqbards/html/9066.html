aggro radius in all situations.  If you&#39;ve ever tried to sneak<br/>
up on Chief Goonda in WK, you know that he has a *huge* aggro<br/>
radius (basically he charged me when he was about 5 pixels<br/>
large on my screen at 1024x768).  So it may be that while a<br/>
mob&#39;s initial aggro radius is small, once it has been<br/>
activated, the AI may be taking into account all potential<br/>
hostiles it sees within a much larger radius.<br/>
