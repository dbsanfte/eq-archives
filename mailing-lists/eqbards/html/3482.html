<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444194502">Hmm, I don&#39;t know about your experiences but mine have been along the lines<br/>
of what the song intended. At level 25 in Permafrost I was able to sleep at<br/>
least 4 ice goblins while my party beat the ice cubes out of a fifth. They<br/>
would occasionally wake up and slap me but they would usually go right back<br/>
to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
	Now, one thing I will note is that I&#39;ve heard time and again how we only<br/>
can sleep up to 4 creatures at a time. In Permafrost I fired up Lullaby<br/>
amidst a train of 11 mixed goblins and got a &#39;nods&#39; message from 9 of them.<br/>
I can&#39;t confirm if they were actually sleeping or if I was just receiving<br/>
the wrong message since my party was actively getting the hell outta Dodge.<br/>

8)The Lullaby to my mind is meant to be a train stopper, rescue<br/>
8)song.  I grant<br/>
8)that it should have limited duration and I can accept that it<br/>
8)should make you<br/>
8)unpopular.  BUT I personally think it is FAR below what it<br/>
8)should be.  For one<br/>
8)thing it&#39;s duration is FAR shorter then the Laments even with<br/>
8)a lute. Two as a<br/>
8)constant song even a creature that breaks out should be<br/>
8)subject to the song<br/>
8)again every pulse otherwise like Lament it should be a single<br/>
8)pulse song just<br/>
8)area effect.  I&#39;m not asking for a god song mind you but I<br/>
8)also don&#39;t think<br/>
8)the creature should really want to kill the bard more then<br/>
8)the person pounding<br/>
8)on it. Let me give two case examples.</div>
