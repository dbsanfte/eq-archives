&gt; Our melee is really too weak currently to qualify as a secondary.  I back<br/>
&gt; this opinion up by this experience.  I was grouped at one point with a<br/>
&gt; ranger and a shadowknight.  We agreed to test out our melee skills, letting<br/>
&gt; the monsters be the judges.  None of us cat any spells or used any abilities<br/>
&gt; except the ranger to snare mobs that had ceased to offer their opinion as<br/>
&gt; judges.  The result?  I did not take more than a single attack the entire<br/>
&gt; night in any fight.  In 4 hours of play I took maybe 150 points of damage.<br/>
&gt; The shadowknight won the contest but only barely.  He was attacked 54% of<br/>
&gt; the time, the ranger 46%.   The number of attacks on me was below 1%.<br/>

ranger (and the SK&#39;s 101%) and you could get the same results.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d be better off turning on all attack messages, then<br/>
parsing the file afterwards to figure out damage/sec and<br/>
damage_taken/sec figures.<br/>
