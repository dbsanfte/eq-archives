 </span></blockquote>This is true, reinforced does have higher AC than leather, but it is<br/>
not financially viable.  Compared to banded, the price you could<br/>
sell reinforced for is relatively low given that smiths sell steel<br/>
bonings at about 2pp each, 1pp if you have a smith friend (and<br/>
free if you have a _good_ friend who is a smith).<br/>
<br/>
And for the same reason, studded is also not viable (even less so<br/>
than reinforced).  And as not many (if any) tailors make studded,<br/>
their skills are too low to reliably make reinforced, which means<br/>
it costs a tailor even more to make it.<br/>
<br/>
Have a look around and see how many people advertise studded or<br/>
reinforced for sale, compared to patchwork or banded.  I have<br/>
seen zero in my time playing, since the second week of release.<br/>
<br/>
If you find a friendly tailor with reasonable skill, say 30 (and<br/>
you are unlikely to find anyone with higher skill), then you <br/>
may be able to get him or her to make you reinforced at material cost<br/>
(I know I would).  But expect to shell out at least 8pp plus change<br/>
for a tunic, per attempt (2pp each for 4 bonings, plus pattern<br/>
and high quality pelt).<br/>
<br/>
IMHO the trade skills suck in financial terms.  Sure, it&#39;s fun to<br/>
make and sell stuff, but remember that time you spend making and<br/>
selling is time you are not partying.  In a role-playing sense it<br/>
is good, but any powergamers out there would be well advised to<br/>
steer clear of trade skills.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s hoping that the upgrade to trade skills in the new version<br/>
of EQ helps fix that problem.<br/>
