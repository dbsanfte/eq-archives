<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005725047">Of course, you could look at juggling as singing a medley. Since both tunes<br/>
are in the compilation, both effects are present.Since this is a game, and<br/>
not real life, we don&#39;t have the option of linking the songs to make musical<br/>
sense. But we can view the bard as having done so in the game. We just have<br/>
to deal with the odd implementation in RL(i.e. alternating buttons, vice a<br/>
linked string of different tunes).<br/>
<br/>
Or, you could imagine that using two songs together is actually a third,<br/>
totally different song with a melody, and countermelody. I know I&#39;ve sung<br/>
choral tunes with this structure.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of options for viewing juggling in an RP sense, rather than<br/>
just a game mechanic.<br/>

&gt; I am also a RL musician, and i don&#39;t think that anyone, no matter what<br/>
&gt; you try to say on here, sings one verse of one song, then one verse of<br/>
&gt; another song, then the second verse of the first song, then the second<br/>
&gt; verse of the second song, etc.  if you do then you are annoying the<br/>
&gt; hell out of everybody.  this is what i mean when i say that a bard<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t do it.  a bard is proud of his singing and wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; appear foolish even if it did boost his stats.  this is all IMHO by the<br/>
&gt; way.  everyone is free to their own opinion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The juggling is EXACTLY what I do as a RL solo<br/>
&gt; &gt; club musician.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; the song that continues when you stop singing.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; the EFFECT that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; song has on you.  When I sing a sad song, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; listener doesn&#39;t stop feeling<br/>
&gt; &gt; sad immediately after I stop singing.  It&#39;s this<br/>
&gt; &gt; *effect* that carries over<br/>
&gt; &gt; into the next song.  If the next song is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; toe-tapper, the audience may<br/>
&gt; &gt; still feel a little sad for a while even as they<br/>
&gt; &gt; start tapping.<br/>
