 </span></blockquote>Have you tried the Lake of Ill Omen yet?  That&#39;s where I and my level <br/>
14 Shaman husband are hunting right now.  There are planty of blue <br/>
and even mobs (and yellow and red to keep the adreneline pubmping) to <br/>
beat up on.  We&#39;re  fighting just north of the lake, not too far from <br/>
the river.  I got about a bubble and a half of exp in around an hour <br/>
of fighting last night.<br/>
<br/>
I also got a chance to practice a technique I learned from this <br/>
list.  My husband pulled a goblin skirmisher and just as he was <br/>
reaching me, a goblin battlemaster decided to join in.  We fought the <br/>
2 for a bit, but as the battlemaster was red to me and beating on me, <br/>
things were not going well.  I decided discretion was the key here <br/>
and started to run toward the zone (I had SoW, so didn&#39;t need to fire <br/>
up Selo&#39;s).  As I ran, with one mob behind me and one still fighting <br/>
my husband (who was doing fine with the one) I remembered some <br/>
discussions about crowd control and running circles with mobs in <br/>
tow.  So I made sure I had my mandolin equipped and made a wide turn <br/>
back while healing myself.  Once the battle was done I deposited the <br/>
extra mob back where we were originally fighting and we finished him <br/>
off.  So much better getting exp on the 2 mobs than zoning.<br/>
