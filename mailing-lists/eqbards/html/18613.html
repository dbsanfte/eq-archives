<div id="ygrps-yiv-486395806">Uhh we&#39;ve done it on Test with no guilds whatsoever...  With multiple guilds<br/>
and with a bunch of un-guilded people.<br/>
<br/>
You need 3 things:  1 - A leader who is hard assed.  2 - An organizer and<br/>
3 - a cop to keep track of folks.<br/>
<br/>
As long as everyone can understand their role and group leaders communicate<br/>
well, in the planes you can use OOC as a &#39;guildchat&#39; area so that all group<br/>
can communicate.  Use SHOUT for orders from the leaders and information from<br/>
the various group leaders (IE:  Cleric Linkdead etc)<br/>
<br/>
You can do planes with pickup groups you just need to use your head, keep<br/>
folks organized and make sure everyone keeps OOC and shout clear for event<br/>
use.  If they wanna chitchat they need to keep it in group/guildsay.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; No, but there&#39;s more to it than you might think.  You need to know how to<br/>
organize groups, buff people,<br/>
&gt; pull stuff, battle tactics, and loot rules.  It&#39;s probably impossible to<br/>
do this effectively if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; essentially doing &quot;pickup&quot; groups each time.  Buffing alone can take hours<br/>
if you don&#39;t have it organized<br/>
&gt; well up front.  Heck, just getting people into groups can take a couple of<br/>
hours if you don&#39;t know who you<br/>
&gt; have available and they aren&#39;t organized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If two or three guilds consistently work together, or if one larger (but<br/>
not quite large enough) guild<br/>
&gt; fills in the holes by picking up extra players or another small guild, it<br/>
can work just fine, though.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     I know this isn&#39;t Bard Related -but no Kabong so far - so I have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; question - is it impossible to do a Dragon or Plane raid with members<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; multiple guilds?<br/>
