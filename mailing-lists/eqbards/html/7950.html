<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117965360">Here&#39;s something that you higher level guys already know, and I forgot<br/>
about, kind of funny:<br/>
<br/>
I am hanging out in HighKeep these days and after getting my level 28 pixie<br/>
chase song last week, using it for a few days, and realizing it had little<br/>
usefulness against the gobs for practical purposes I decided I should<br/>
re-evaluate my playlist to suit my environmental variables (as we all do<br/>
when we move from zone to zone).<br/>
<br/>
Going through my spell book and trying to decide which would be the best 4<br/>
songs to twist during combat and realizing that I have been throwing in a<br/>
pixie strike each round which stuns the gobs but nothing else, I decide what<br/>
the heck, I&#39;ll dust off the old bellow and do some damage while I stun them,<br/>
see how that goes for a while.<br/>

A Goblin Warrior is hit for 15 damage non-melee<br/>
<br/>
HA! That is comparable damage to what I am doing with me melee weapons on<br/>
each attack, so its like slipping in a 3rd magic attack - and the last time<br/>
I used bellow it was hitting for a maximum of 8 damage.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I am done the story is not as interesting as I thought it would be,<br/>
but since we were talking about Bellow, it brings up the issue that for the<br/>
duration of our Bards, we can continue to make use of even our older, dusty<br/>
songs if the situation seems to fit.  Its actually kind of fun bellowing<br/>
again :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; experience loss hurts.  For the folks grouped with him though,<br/>
&gt; &gt; this can be another matter, as they end up grouped with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; player who either does not know how to play the class to best<br/>
&gt; &gt; advantage (e.g. bards doing nothing but bellowing during a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fight, then healing after), or gets them into situations<br/>
&gt; &gt; likely to get them killed because hey if one of them is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; close match for me, three of them should be no problem for my<br/>
&gt; &gt; group of six.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, luckily I have a rl level 35 bard friend who I talk all <br/>
&gt; the tima and<br/>
&gt; ask him for advice.  In groups though, I still wonder about my song<br/>
&gt; selections some time.  Soloing I use warsong, bellow, bellow, <br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; fighting white or yellow con&#39;sing monsters and I need the extra damage<br/>
&gt; from bellow to win the damage race.  In a group of two, I <br/>
&gt; actually sing<br/>
&gt; anthem, warsong, bellow, since I am probably better equipped then my<br/>
&gt; groupmate and it would be better for me to tank, so I try and <br/>
&gt; pull it on<br/>
&gt; myself.  In larger groups I sing anthem, healing, bellow, and I think<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s pretty much the standard right?  Obviously I drop the <br/>
&gt; last song if<br/>
&gt; the lag gets too high, which is almost always bellow.<br/>
