 </span></blockquote>PvP doesn&#39;t appeal to me in this type of game.  Presumably you<br/>
want player versus player conflict to determine who is the<br/>
better player.  The best way to do that is to have everyone<br/>
play exactly the same character with exactly the same<br/>
equipment.  Or different characters/equipment that are<br/>
perfectly balanced with each other (which isn&#39;t the case in EQ<br/>
nor UO).  To me, it&#39;s pointless to PvP in a game where someone<br/>
in in full planes gear can kill someone naked trying to get<br/>
back to his corpse.<br/>

&gt; Hmm, how many deaths would it take for you to get back to level 26? Heh.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;d have some nice armor and items and a lot of useless songs.  But then<br/>
&gt; they seem to be pretty useless to you now?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said, I&#39;ve already done all that.  I don&#39;t want to do<br/>
it all again.  I want different challenges that require me to<br/>
figure out different solutions.  Why Verant wants the nature<br/>
of this class to change so much as you level is puzzling to<br/>
me.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you opened the box, they kinda described this (the class and level<br/>
&gt; system) did they not?  It&#39;s not something they changed in the past year is<br/>
&gt; it?  And its not anything they plan on changing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My gripe would&#39;ve been about how easy it is to screw up level<br/>
and class based systems in this manner.  Yes I knew it was a<br/>
level/class based game when I bought it.  Properly done, or<br/>
even decently done, it&#39;s not too much of a problem.  But it&#39;s<br/>
easy to screw it up big time, which is what I think Verant has<br/>
done with bards at high level (though not necessarily<br/>
intentionally).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess alot of people who focus on the get next level aspect feel the level<br/>
&gt; 50 dissappointment.  Unless you have a very active guild, or are really into<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not disappointed at reaching level 50.  I am disappointed<br/>
that:<br/>
<br/>
- I cannot charm anymore.<br/>
- I cannot (practically) mez anymore.<br/>
- The damage shield songs do not keep pace with my healing,<br/>
  making it for the most part pointless to use them.<br/>
- My party buffs are not as good as I&#39;d originally believed<br/>
  (would&#39;ve changed a lot of song strategy early on if I&#39;d<br/>
  known this).<br/>
- My main form of offense is now equipping my lute and singing<br/>
  songs, leaving me no new weapons to seek, no decisions to<br/>
  make about which weapon to use.<br/>
- Resist songs are of specialized use because their<br/>
  effectiveness scales logarithmically - once you get close to<br/>
  100 with normal equipment and spells, there&#39;s not much need<br/>
  for more.<br/>
<br/>
Strategy lately has boiled down to Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD.  <br/>
Facing multiple mobs?  Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD.  Grouped with<br/>
tanks?  Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD.  Grouped with a healer?  <br/>
Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD.  Grouped with casters?  <br/>
Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD.  I could use other songs to spice things<br/>
up, but I&#39;d still know in the back of my mind that this combo<br/>
is almost always the most effective at killing mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Can you understand how boring this is for someone who lived<br/>
off of trying to figure out what worked best in what<br/>
situation?  This is why I didn&#39;t want to play a warrior (tank,<br/>
taunt) or wizard (root, stun, nuke, med) - they are so<br/>
one-dimensional.  Now I find that high level bards approach<br/>
the same level of one-dimensionality.  Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that magic number.  On one hand, I am focusing all my<br/>
&gt; attention on getting the big 50.  On the other hand I am<br/>
&gt; wondering why?  And an expansion with every level a hell<br/>
&gt; level?  Hmm not very apealling thought. [...] more people<br/>
&gt; interaction to have that.  So, far 90% of this game is you<br/>
&gt; vs NPC&#39;s in endless hours of boredom - all for the sake of<br/>
&gt; filling the yellow bard and making a ding.  And you do it<br/>
&gt; because its there. bcause your friends are doing it. &quot;Loot<br/>
&gt; does not matter.&quot;  &quot;Exp & Leveling dont matter&quot; ROFLOL!<br/>
&gt; Thats all that matters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Level and loot do not matter to me, aside from getting a new<br/>
song or weapon to give me more options to play around with.  <br/>
What matters to me is having fun figuring out how stuff works<br/>
so I can do it better.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, that&#39;s a good way of thinking of it.  What I found<br/>
appealing about the bard was that we had so many different<br/>
ways of dealing with a situation.  I could spend days trying<br/>
the same thing over and over with slightly different<br/>
strategies to see which worked better.  But since about L42+,<br/>
contrary to what you&#39;d expect, having more songs does *not*<br/>
translate into having more options.  Due to Verant&#39;s<br/>
(mis)implementation of song scaling with level, it&#39;s actually<br/>
led to fewer options.  I have an easier time now deciding what<br/>
8 songs to load than I did back in my 30s.<br/>
<br/>
For planes trips, I&#39;ve pretty much resorted to playing<br/>
tactical back-seat driver for the person(s) running things;  <br/>
offering suggestions, critiqueing decisions, offering my<br/>
analytical opinion on what went wrong/went right.  Because the<br/>
bard class doesn&#39;t let me do this type of thing anymore.<br/>
