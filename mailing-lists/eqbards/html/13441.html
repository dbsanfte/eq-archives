a charm.  We men are such suckers...<br/>

if I could help a poor fellow bard buy their level four song.  Remembering how hard the first few levels<br/>
were, I turned around to take a look.  She was in full bronze!  What, her twinker was too cheap to give<br/>
her 50 plat?  Of course, she was a wood elf, so I had to cough it up.  (See sucker comment, above...)<br/>
