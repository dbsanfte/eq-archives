<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315124690">Hahahaha I makes jokes about having my thumb up my butt all the time ROFL,<br/>
its a guild joke now.<br/>
Leadership is very interesting, I have to first agree that if people dont<br/>
listen, thats the end of the raid right there.  But also, often leaders<br/>
aren&#39;t clear or get some bug up their butts and end up wasting our time and<br/>
theirs because they &quot;know better.&quot;  Our old raid leader was absolutely the<br/>
worst about this, he knew everything, and although we were successful, he<br/>
claimed all success as his.  And still does, even when he&#39;s gone.  <br/>
<br/>
Paradigm does pretty well overall I&#39;d say, but one of the things that<br/>
strikes me as hugely amusing is when people in other guilds say &quot;I want to<br/>
be in PD, I&#39;m tired of all this dying!&quot;  I just laugh and ask them how many<br/>
times they think we died to Yelinak before we killed him, or Dain, or omg<br/>
let&#39;s not even talk about Trak.  Raids fail all the time and I think its the<br/>
mark or a good group or guild to have the perseverence to keep trying until<br/>
they get it right.<br/>
<br/>
Ok need coffee, think I&#39;m sounding preachy sorry :P<br/>

&gt; Leadership means nothing when the people there don&#39;t listen <br/>
&gt; to commands.<br/>
&gt; Maybe Veeshan is the exception in this case, but I have seen <br/>
&gt; the leader of<br/>
&gt; one of our most powerful guilds fail on a Vox run due to complete<br/>
&gt; incompetence of the people there.  If people had at all been <br/>
&gt; able to follow<br/>
&gt; directions, I wouldn&#39;t be sitting around with my thumb up my <br/>
&gt; butt waiting<br/>
&gt; for my guild to get enough resist gear to down Gone.  (I have <br/>
&gt; pretty much<br/>
&gt; everything else done).  Bitter?<br/>
