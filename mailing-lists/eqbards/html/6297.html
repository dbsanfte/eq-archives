<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545163109">Heh - Actually, the reason I haven&#39;t kabong!ed this borderline thread <br/>
     is the fact that gaining 50th *is* important to all of us, and <br/>
     frankly, many of us want to know what we will be doing when we get <br/>
     there.<br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
By the time I reach 50th level Verant will have upped the level limit to <br/>
about 250...  However I do agree that something must be done about <br/>
harvesting low level mobs for twinkie treasure by high level characters. <br/>
the only cool stuff I own I have bought.  I have exactly one item that I <br/>
got the hard way and it was a quest item. (polar bear cloak)  Everything <br/>
else is bought.  Not a bad thing in theory but there is a sense of <br/>
accomplishment from &quot;winning&quot; your good items that is missing when you are <br/>
temperamentally incapable of sitting in the same place for 15 hours game <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion:  random spawn points for the named NPC&#39;s that carry the good <br/>
stuff.  <br/>
