<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093722336">I think this pretty much sums up my view on really special items, like<br/>
off Gods/Dragons. The other thing worth considering is, if you could<br/>
have (1) item, what would it be off a dragon? I&#39;m sure opinions vary,<br/>
but for my guild we generally shoot for everyone getting one dragon/god<br/>
drop before we start getting 2-3 for select people. I firmly agree with<br/>
this policy, and I was a recipient of a special drop 2 months ago in our<br/>
first victory over Lord Nagafen. I received Selo&#39;s Drums of the March.<br/>
We&#39;ve also had alot of other nifty things drop off other monsters since,<br/>
but there is no way I&#39;d pass up my drums for anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to keep in mind, is who can best use an item. Part of the<br/>
problem, like Harmonic said, is that wizard who sees that Earthcrafter<br/>
is tradeable (druid staff recently fixed from +15 int [duh] to +15 wis,<br/>
common drop on Cazic Thule), and wants in the lotto so he can give it to<br/>
his L1 druid. umm, yuck. I really don&#39;t care if people twink other<br/>
characters with items they take their own time getting, but to my<br/>
knowledge, no one has solo&#39;d a god or dragon yet. ;P<br/>
<br/>
On things like this belt, who could best use it would clearly be a<br/>
melee-intensive class, such as warrior, monk, or hybrid (I don&#39;t include<br/>
Bard because of our limited melee damage potential at higher levels [no<br/>
double attack]). Bards get a very minimal damage bonus from additional<br/>
strength, while an SK, PAL, WAR get several points for the same bonus.<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t want to stir up any controversy by saying that, that is<br/>
simply how I see it. Any caster being involved in that lotto is as<br/>
absurd as a druid wearing a FBSS and thinking he is a tank *laugh* (ask<br/>
the L50s how many druids they know with FBSS though *sigh*). (FBSS =<br/>
Flowing Black Silk Sash, effect: haste). Alot of the drops off<br/>
dragons/gods are either very class/race restrictive, or all/all. We also<br/>
need to kep in mind so many things are Bard usuable, just because we are<br/>
versatile.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a level of trust to handle loot such that the most appropriate<br/>
recipient gets it, it&#39;s one step up from what classes could reasonably<br/>
use it. If this was with groups from several guilds, or with people that<br/>
don&#39;t normally play together, for completeness I&#39;d say you should<br/>
include any class that could reasonably use the belt (so Bards should<br/>
have been in it too, but not finger wagglers, all/all be darned).<br/>

&gt;   Would I bark if I wasnt included in the roll for such a belt?<br/>
&gt;   Probably.  Would it ruin my day?  No way.  If a person wanted<br/>
&gt;   it for a secondary or other toon not present in the raid, I<br/>
&gt;   would chuckle at them.  And I&#39;m sure everyone else would too.<br/>
&gt;   Dragon loot just doesn&#39;t work like that ;-)<br/>
