Resist does help reduce their damage.  I&#39;m starting to wonder<br/>
though if the damage reduction is checked against straight<br/>
magic resist rather than fire or cold.  Last night in<br/>
Mistmoore, we were only using Psalm of Mystic Shielding and<br/>
Guardian Rhythms.  Yet, we took a lot less damage than I<br/>
recall being normal from the cold and fire attacks.<br/>
