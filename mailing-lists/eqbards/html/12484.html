&gt;   Mystic: MR 109, first cast 100 dmg, second cast 300 dmg (full hit).<br/>
&gt;   Ele/Gu: MR 161, first cast 200 dmg, second cast 250 dmg.<br/>

&gt;   Never once did I outright resist the spell.  Resistances are<br/>
&gt;   very cloudy in my mind for dmg based effects right now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup, DDs (and AEs) are nearly impossible to resist.  I never<br/>
saw myself outright resisting one until a L13ish goblin wizard<br/>
decided to attack my L25ish self in Butcherblock.<br/>

Resist does help reduce their damage.  I&#39;m starting to wonder<br/>
though if the damage reduction is checked against straight<br/>
magic resist rather than fire or cold.  Last night in<br/>
Mistmoore, we were only using Psalm of Mystic Shielding and<br/>
Guardian Rhythms.  Yet, we took a lot less damage than I<br/>
recall being normal from the cold and fire attacks.<br/>
