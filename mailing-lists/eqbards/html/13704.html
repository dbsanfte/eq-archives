<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-851163570">This is frightening.  Of course Abashi&#39;s suggestion that bards need to know<br/>
when to stop singing is even more frightening.  Are they aware how little we<br/>
can do if we stop singing.  I can already hear the screams from the casters<br/>
now from 10 levels away. <br/>
<br/>
Casters:	&quot;Hey you stopped singing mana song, start up again!&quot;<br/>
Bard:		&quot;I can&#39;t.  Didn&#39;t you read between the lines in Abashi&#39;s<br/>
post, bards have 		 to stop singing or die!&quot;<br/>
Casters:	&quot;What?!?  You&#39;re useless to us if you can&#39;t sing, go find us<br/>
a warrior.&quot;<br/>

After reviewing this thread as well as some others on the other boards, and <br/>
chatting with some of our inhouse people that play bards (we have several of<br/>
<br/>
those), we&#39;ve decided to decrease the taunt factor of the bard songs. This <br/>
is not going to lead to a drastic change to how the bard class is played, as<br/>
<br/>
bards need to know when to stop singing, but it should definatly be <br/>
noticible.<br/>
The problem centers around how a creatures hate-list works. Without going <br/>
into detail, creatures also hate people who cast beneficial spells on people<br/>
<br/>
they hate. Since bards do this roughly every 6-12 seconds, it can get a bit <br/>
dangerous<br/>

A nice change from &quot;deal with it.&quot;<br/>
