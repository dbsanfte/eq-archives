<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448505934">Heya all =) (Yet another rambling Frashii post),<br/>
<br/>
I use this method myself for power leveling lower people in my guild =)<br/>
 (But upon relfection, MES would be a MUCH easier way to do this, Thanks<br/>
  Jaez!)<br/>
<br/>
I usually take 1 or 2 people to East Karana, pull a Undead Gnoll Reaver, <br/>
Gnoll Reaver or Griffawn (anything yellow/red to them) and beat it to <br/>
within an inch (cm) of its life, snare it, charm it, then lets the <br/>
newbies kill it off.<br/>
<br/>
They get GREAT exp, (Imagine killing reds for 2 hours with no downtime),<br/>
and I get the satisfaction of helping my guildmates and advertising how<br/>
cool bards are :)<br/>
<br/>
Last night, a bard on my server, Tuldar (thanks!), showed me just how <br/>
nifty Pixie Strike was in the Arena. I used it in Highpass Keep, and for <br/>
once, our finger wiggling casters didn&#39;t get hit once!!  I just constantly <br/>
played pixie strike (ignoring the &quot;Just play the mana song&quot;), while <br/>
weaving in the mana song, and my group was AMAZED. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;You mean, you sped up our attack, mana songed AND stopped the monster <br/>
from aggroing on the finger wigglers? WOW! Do you cook too?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What was I to do ?  I handed out Gnome and Troll shaped cookies with <br/>
bottles of Kalish (no milk in highpass keep).<br/>
<br/>
I tend to get chosen for groups pretty quick now :)<br/>
<br/>
Moral(s) of the Story : <br/>
   1) Advertise, Advertise, Advertise<br/>
   Let people KNOW what tricks you are doing. They don&#39;t know<br/>
   what &#39;Eyes glaze over&#39; and &#39;Surrounded by Chains of Music&#39;<br/>
   mean. Communicate. You will find other people in your group<br/>
   will start to do the same.<br/>
	 <br/>
   2) ALWAYS take an opportunity to chat with fellow bards. Make<br/>
   friends. As a class, we of all people need to talk shop<br/>
   a LOT. We have a TON of neat songs, but without the knowledge<br/>
   they are like that sewing machine in the other room. Ie. a <br/>
   great tool, but worthless because lack of skill and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
   3) Take a night off occasionally to help lower leveled friends.<br/>
   They might be your groupmates some day if they suddenly gain<br/>
   a bunch of levels :)<br/>

PS. Wow did I get lucky. I found a Rune that a level 50 finger wigger<br/>
 needed on a deepwater croc, and asked him if he would help my friend <br/>
 (who I was there on a mission with me in Oasis) get the last spoke he <br/>
  needed from the deepwater goblin spire.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, the mob agrod on him, and I went and tanked it until he could <br/>
  cast on it.    We had to zone (had 3 more there too), but when we came <br/>
  back, the one we killed HAD THE OPALINE HELM!<br/>
<br/>
  At the time, I had NO idea what the helm was for I just thought, <br/>
  &quot;Look its black! I look soooo good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Sure glad I looted it =D<br/>
<br/>
PPS. Could have looted a Gypsie Lute Last night <br/>
     had I been in Mistmoor... =(<br/>
<br/>
PPPS. I Sure would like some different clothes to wear to weddings <br/>
      and such. I&#39;ve been the maid of honor at 2 weddings (3 on Saturday), <br/>
      and I&#39;ve attended them in either my all bronze (level 18 or so), or <br/>
      my current getup of &#39;TV Antenna&#39; (quick raise your right arm, <br/>
      channel 7 isnt coming in!) (all silvery). <br/>
       A Nice white dress would be nice :P<br/>

Are you sure Sylly didnt sing Chrissons Pixie strike its a mez song, and<br/>
it would make more sense that it wiped aggressor list.<br/>

my plan... (Umm, Hero Boy, this is your brain. Thanks for the emergency<br/>
request for a plan. I&#39;ll get back to you). So I ran around for awhile<br/>
avoiding hits, trying to figure out where to drag the cyclops child, when<br/>
suddenly a lovely vision in blue swept in to save the day.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Sylly proceeded to whack away on Baby Broon so I joined in. He cons<br/>

worked! Once he got down to a sliver, Broon paused as a glow surrounded<br/>
him. Sylly says, &quot;Finish him off, Opera&quot;. Not waiting to consider the full<br/>
meaning of her words (Brain, stop wasting your 286 processing on the plan,<br/>
we&#39;re ok now), I whacked Mono Focal a couple more times and he went down<br/>
like a third-string QB.<br/>

&gt;Sylly had charmed Broon and left me as the only attacker when it wore<br/>

I was not aware that there was a memory blur effect with charm regarding<br/>
hits taken. But seeing is believing.<br/>
