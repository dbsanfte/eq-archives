talking about, as I am human, and have had to learn to travel without a<br/>
light stone, and without infravision in pitch blackness;) Can you say walk a<br/>

Man, infravision makes a HUGE difference over human vision.  With<br/>
infravision, everything has a reddish tinge (especially when its dark),<br/>
but with human vision you are completly blind when it dark, go to a dark<br/>
zone and see what i mean.  (like Innothule swamp).  Ultravision is even<br/>
better as you see almost the same and day and night, though at night<br/>
everything is bluish...<br/>
