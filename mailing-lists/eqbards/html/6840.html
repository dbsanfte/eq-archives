&gt; My understanding was that the only mobs in Perma that dropped bronze<br/>
&gt; were the elite guards at the back by the diplomat. At L19 I would have<br/>
&gt; thought that they might be a bit hard to reach, even with a full party.<br/>
&gt; Is this not the case? This dungeon wasn&#39;t even itemized until I was in<br/>
&gt; my 30&#39;s so I didn&#39;t get to play there much except for a trip to pick up<br/>
&gt; a crystalline blade and a couple of aborted Vox attempts.<br/>

I&#39;d guess something like 1 in 500 drops it.  When my friends<br/>
and I were L20-27 and fighting the ice gobbies, we&#39;d average<br/>
one piece of medium bronze every other night.<br/>

It&#39;s a shame that Verant made it so difficult to get.  By the<br/>
time we were capable of handling the goblin elites (they are<br/>
*all* linked so you have to be much higher than they con to<br/>
tackle them), most of my medium-sized friends had saved up<br/>
enough plat to buy medium steel plate.<br/>
