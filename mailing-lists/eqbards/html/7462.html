&gt; as i said before, a couple months into the game, this experience loss was<br/>

&gt; 1/4 what i used to.  that to me is more a time saver than running across a<br/>
&gt; few zones.  you can have one or the other, bind or MUCH less experience<br/>
&gt; loss.  i am happy with what they did.  i can&#39;t speak for everyone.<br/>

JM Cappozi, that they also massively increased the amount of exp<br/>
required to level shortly after this without telling us. Still,<br/>
psychologically, not losing 2+ bubbles when you die (man did that suck)<br/>
is a lot easier to take, even if it takes just as long to make back the<br/>
exp you lost as it did when you did lose it.<br/>
