<br/>
&gt; The characters were a joke since the GM&#39;s made us delete the <br/>
&gt; characters<br/>
&gt; anyway ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The characters were a joke?  Oh, you mean they were rogues.  ;^)  Fitting, I<br/>
suppose.  You could always claim you were roleplaying.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; WOW and I thought that my best friend spent a lot of time <br/>
&gt; roleplaying with<br/>
&gt; 44days played at 20th...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahah!  A challenge!  (Actually the challenge will be to get to 20 before the<br/>
wide world of EQ comes crashing down due to all it&#39;s players movign on to<br/>
other games)  <br/>
<br/>
 hehe and she spends HOURS just <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; frittering time away<br/>
&gt; talking to folks ;)  She loves the social aspect of the game. <br/>
&gt;  I keep trying<br/>
&gt; to tell her this isn&#39;t MiRC but she loves to chat :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My game time is spent mostly fishing, drinking, delivering mail, and<br/>
retrieving corpses - sometimes not even my own!  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kudos on 11th!  Have you tried the all-instrument twist of<br/>
&gt; Hymn/Disonnance/Warsong?  (punching of course)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  And no, but I did dust off Disonnance for the first time in ages<br/>
last night.  I hadn&#39;t used since, oh, level 4, except as an initial taunt to<br/>
get a mobs attention.  But last night I found a nice open area (WC, near EC)<br/>
and a mob I knew I could take (giant spider) and tried the ol&#39; wince tune<br/>
for laughs.  I am TOTALLY sold on the HoR/CoD/JWW medley now.  I&#39;d have<br/>
tried it with the lute except I couldn&#39;t rightly tell how much damage CoD<br/>
was doing. <br/>
