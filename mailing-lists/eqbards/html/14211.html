&gt; With DE illusion up and the Carillon song, I can get my faction<br/>
&gt; to the ogre<br/>
&gt; merchants up to Amiable.  Does sneaking with the Carillon get it<br/>
&gt; to Warmly?  If<br/>
&gt; not then the illusion is better than sneaking when selling.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One point I&#39;d like to make is that I&#39;ve been using those<br/>
&gt; vendors in Oggok a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot lately, and if you sneak behind them and buy/sell your<br/>
&gt; prices are a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; better than as a DE, although sneaking is less convenient. </span></blockquote></div>
