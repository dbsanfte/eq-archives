<div id="ygrps-yiv-295512427">Last night I suffered 5 deaths in Hate.  However, the very first scorn <br/>
banshee pull yielded Imbrued Legs and I won the lotto!!! WOO HOO! I <br/>
immediately saw that the stats on the spoiler sites were incorrect regarding <br/>
the AC.  Did anyone ever get a list of the AC upgrades to Imbrued? Other <br/>
stats were the same so I&#39;m assuming they just gave the armor an AC buff.  If <br/>
anyone could direct me to a website or list the AC changes I&#39;d appreciate <br/>
it.<br/>
