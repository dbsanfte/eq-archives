<b>Subject:</b> Song Fizzles upon leveling <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-551904230">Hey guys, just noticed something yesterday about fizzles. You may have<br/>
read the &quot;Archmage&#39;s Answers&quot; where he said:<br/>
<br/>
Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the<br/>
spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells<br/>
at level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had<br/>
a 60 Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in<br/>
Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard<br/>
would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For<br/>
every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of<br/>
fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling. Thus,<br/>
three levels (15 skill points) after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she<br/>
will be able to max out her Alteration and have a mere 5% chance of<br/>
fizzling the spell. <br/>

Well, yeasterday while I was hunting in CT. I leveled to 36 (yay!). I<br/>
did not have my 36th level song, so I was singing EXACTLY the same songs<br/>
I was before. Anthem, Hymn, Pixie Strike, Chains, Clarity, Etc. I<br/>
IMMEDIATELY after leveling got 50% more missed notes than before I<br/>
leveled. I went from Fizzling one in 20 to ~one in 10.<br/>
<br/>
IF song fizzles REALLY used the above formula, I would only have a 5%<br/>
chance of Fizzling before and after leveling. But my theory is that the<br/>
formula is a bit whacked, and checks your skill vs. your current level<br/>
maximum, instead of vs. your max skill at level you gained the song.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, both my CHA and DEX are over 100, so I should have a 5% fizzle rate<br/>
anyway (assuming skill is maxed at previous level). I continued to fight<br/>
and my singing skill went up quickly and was maxed in just a few fights,<br/>
then I ran home and bought Verses, came back and am now back to 5%<br/>
fizzles.<br/>
