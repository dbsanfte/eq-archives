<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812104715">Inspired by Reed&#39;s &#39;Fironia&#39; (very nice, btw :)  here&#39;s a number to sing<br/>
when our many outstanding issues go unresolved for another week :)<br/>
<br/>
To be sung to the tune of &#39;American Pie&#39; - Madonna&#39;s version.<br/>
<br/>
A long long time ago<br/>
I can still remember when<br/>
Verant had time to help us all<br/>
And now we bump for days on end<br/>
When will they fix our songs again<br/>
So maybe we&#39;ll be happy &#39;till the Fall.<br/>
<br/>
Did you write those bug reports<br/>
And do you have faith in Verant&#39;s support<br/>
If Abashi tells you so?<br/>
Now do you believe they&#39;ll fix the drum<br/>
Remove that silly flute we strum<br/>
And can they up our caps to help us solo?<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m not here to flame or whine,<br/>
But I&#39;m still missing song number forty-nine<br/>
My Chain won&#39;t root their shoes,<br/>
Man, I can&#39;t even solo those blues.<br/>
I am our tanking party&#39;s healing Bard<br/>
But the Frogloks turn nasty and they hit me hard<br/>
So they leave me dead and mentally scarred<br/>
Each time my music dies.<br/>
So now I&#39;m singin&#39;<br/>
<br/>
My, my, my poor Half-Elf Bard guy<br/>
Sang a ditty to a Kitty but it was Lullabye<br/>
Resistances make me break down and cry<br/>
Singing this&#39;ll be the day that I die<br/>
This&#39;ll be the day that I die.<br/>
<br/>
I met an Elf from Greater Fay<br/>
She laughed, told the zone my run was gay<br/>
I didn&#39;t know that it had changed<br/>
So I told Verant &quot;I liked our glide,<br/>
Please give it back and restore my pride&quot;<br/>
But the man there laughed and thought I was deranged.<br/>
And then in a patch or so I dreamed<br/>
A Small Brass Trumpet for which we&#39;d scream<br/>
But not a word&#39;s been spoken<br/>
This quest is surely broken<br/>
And the three songs I admire most-<br/>
Our Psalms and Charm, all three are toast<br/>
They&#39;ve been the subject of a lot of post<br/>
The day the music died<br/>
And we&#39;re still singing<br/>
<br/>
My, my, my poor Half-Elf Bard guy<br/>
Charmed a cyclops but the song flops so the charm was denied<br/>
Resistances make me break down and cry<br/>
Singing this&#39;ll be the day that I die<br/>
This&#39;ll be the day that I die.<br/>
<br/>
My, my, my poor Half-Elf Bard guy<br/>
Healed some Clerics in hysterics so the Clerics could fly<br/>
The mobs all turned, mashed me into Elf pie<br/>
Singing this&#39;ll be the day that I die<br/>
This&#39;ll be the day that I die.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re still singing...<br/>
We won&#39;t stop singing...<br/>
Don&#39;t stop us singing...<br/>
<br/>
