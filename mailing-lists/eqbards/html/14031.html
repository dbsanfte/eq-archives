<br/>
While I don&#39;t dispute Harmonic&#39;s point about the fact that higher levels<br/>
need more places to hunt... on my server, and many others, there are just<br/>
too darn many people in on (especially during peak hours - and just forget<br/>
about playing on the weekend) to make it easy to get a group anywhere that<br/>
gives experience for those of us between levels 15-40. My husband and I have<br/>
even joked about coming home from work, going right to bed and setting our<br/>
alarms for the early am hours (1am) to be able to play when there are less<br/>
people on.... (hmmm... no... really, we&#39;re not addicted to the game...hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Verant does need to look to the future, but it also has many pressing issues<br/>
that need to be taken care of right now - first and foremost; the server<br/>
overcrowding issue. That problem alone is making playing this game a tad<br/>
frustrating for me and is more than a little rediculous.<br/>
