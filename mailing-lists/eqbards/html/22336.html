<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975397263"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The only times I have trouble getting my pet to attack (with the 39 <br/>
&gt; song) is if the command comes too close to a previous /pet command or <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m too far away from him to hear the message.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I also have trouble with too many commands in one hot key.<br/>
<br/>
What I want to do is:<br/>
<br/>
/assist Fred<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
/say Pet is attacking %T<br/>
/pet target<br/>
/attack off<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But it rarely works.  In this case, what seems to get missed is the assist portion.  It seems like there is a resolution time for assist and it hasn&#39;t been resolved before the /pet attack, so my pet tells me &#39;that is not a legal target master&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to choose between separate Assist key (which I always have anyway) or trying to add a pause in there.<br/>
<br/>
Other thoughts?<br/>
