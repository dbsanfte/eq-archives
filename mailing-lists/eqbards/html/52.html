 </span></blockquote>I also offer to escort people to places they don&#39;t know how to get to or<br/>
to places that would otherwise take hours to get to (thank Erollisi for<br/>
Selo&#39;s Accelerando!) This frequently includes trips from Kelethin to the<br/>
docks, to Freeport, and for some Enchanters - to High Hold.<br/>
<br/>
However, as far as &quot;official&quot; quests go... I have found nary a one<br/>
besides the first.<br/>
