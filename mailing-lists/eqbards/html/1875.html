<div id="ygrps-yiv-46999816">Dual Wield: I use a Barbed Leather Whip(P) and Well-Balanced Rapier(S)<br/>
myself. Works well.<br/>
<br/>
	Song Efficiency: My personal view, of course. Mileage may vary.<br/>
<br/>
	It&#39;s basically a &#39;depends&#39; situation. Mostly depends on the group makeup<br/>
and what you&#39;re fighting.<br/>
<br/>
	At level 23 I thought that it would be most efficient for me to<br/>
stack(twist/weave/whatever) Anthem, Binding, and Chain whenever we fought<br/>
one, maybe two, mobs. I wasn&#39;t Bellowing for damage but the Binding and<br/>
Chain would slow their attack rate down quite a bit and the party would take<br/>
less damage.<br/>
	Two things were wrong about this strategy. First was that the group had two<br/>
tanks and my songs pulled the mob to me. I consider myself as a decent tank<br/>
so this did not concern me much. Second was that after a fair punishment I<br/>
found that I built up so much agro that it was locked on me and I almost<br/>
died from it.<br/>
	Now I play Anthem, Chain, and another song.<br/>
<br/>
	I often do not start out a battle playing Hymn. I go with some other song,<br/>
possibly Bellow, until someone drops between 1 and 2 bars of health. When<br/>
someone&#39;s health goes critical and the healer(if we have one) can&#39;t keep up<br/>
then I lay down every &#39;piss em off&#39; song I got to pull them to me, ending<br/>
with Lullaby so that we can get reorganized a bit. If someone is using a big<br/>
weapon I mix in a little bit of the Jig every now and then to keep stamina<br/>
decent.<br/>
	Other than that it&#39;s basically watching the health bars, the targets,<br/>
anything that might be incoming, and the song effect messages so I know when<br/>
to hit the next key. Sure it can get rather boring but I can tell you that<br/>
it is nowhere near as boring as kiting is. Imagine running around from<br/>
anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes with a mob on your tail, not being able to<br/>
talk to anyone or risk a fair amount to type in tells, just pounding the<br/>
Bellow and Accelerando hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
	If you&#39;re fighting multiples and have good clearance then area effect songs<br/>
like Discord or Lullably can be more effective than Bellow.<br/>
	Grouped with mana using members might make Clarity worth it(when you&#39;re up<br/>
that high of course) especially in longer fights.<br/>
	Don&#39;t recall where the resistance issue lies but if they work then playing<br/>
the rythms against mages could be helpful although attacking, Bellow, and<br/>
Discord seems to be pretty good at interruptions.<br/>
	When fighting underwater I&#39;d say that Ayre would be efficient. =)<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)So if I&#39;m using a Combine LS and one of those FUNKY Dvinn&#39;s<br/>
8)daggers, I&#39;m<br/>
8)better off sticking the dagger in my secondary? As it stands<br/>
8)I&#39;m doing the<br/>
8)opposite, cuz I figure since I have a veryfast weapon to play<br/>
8)with I&#39;d best<br/>
8)give it all the chances I can to do as much dmg as possible<br/>
8)by using it in<br/>
8)my primary. I might&#39;ve just confused the issue ;) What I&#39;d<br/>
8)love is to stick<br/>
8)another Dvinn&#39;s dagger in my secondary hand... *sigh*<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Just had rather a dull session in Mistmoore. The leader of<br/>
8)the group I<br/>
8)joined commanded me to &quot;do just heal and combat song&quot;...<br/>
8)which is what I<br/>
8)did, along with a bellows every few secs. Kinda boring, but<br/>
8)effective. It<br/>
8)led me to thinking: the most efficient way of fighting is to<br/>
8)whackum the<br/>
8)mob as fast as possible. Less damage done to the group, less<br/>
8)chances of<br/>
8)things going wrong... so if one were to stick to the most boring,<br/>
8)statistically correct methods, most of the bard songs would be pretty<br/>
8)unused apart from in rare situations. Am I wrong here? Don&#39;t<br/>
8)mistake me<br/>
8)however - although I behaved according to the leader&#39;s<br/>
8)desires (didn&#39;t have<br/>
8)the energy to lead them through the &quot;look at what I can do!&quot;<br/>
8)routine) - I&#39;m<br/>
8)much more fond of doing a wider variety of songs, twisting different<br/>
8)melodies that enhance and obstruct... far more elegant and<br/>
8)poetic, I think,<br/>
8)not to mention entertaining. Felt like an office drone<br/>
8)hitting my hotkeys<br/>
8)at the right time without having to think about what I was doing.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)But do folks agree that it&#39;d technically (using Vulcan logic<br/>
8)here) be best<br/>
8)simply to do Anthem with 2 bellows, repeat? This is for me at<br/>
8)lvl 20 btw.<br/>
8)Wouldn&#39;t even heal, leave that for after the battle. The aim<br/>
8)is to zap the<br/>
8)critter as fast as possible from what I&#39;ve seen. And remember<br/>
8)- this is<br/>
8)hypothetical. Why I&#39;ll never deny that sometimes there&#39;s a need and a<br/>
8)desire to be all efficient about this game, most of the time<br/>
8)I&#39;d rather<br/>
8)have fun even if it involves more risk.<br/>
