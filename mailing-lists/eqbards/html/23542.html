<div id="ygrps-yiv-328457995"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What does the &quot;L#&quot; entry supposed to indicate?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The simple answer is that I don&#39;t know the effect of the song for <br/>
your current level, so I use the last level that I do have a number <br/>
for.  The &quot;L#&quot; indicates the level that the reading was taken at.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s the long answer...<br/>
<br/>
There are two ways this spreadsheet generates numbers:<br/>
1)  From formulas.<br/>
2)  From tables.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning... if you wanted to know the effect of a song for <br/>
your level, you tested the song on yourself or a friend and looked at <br/>
the numbers.  Rokenn took it upon himself to encourage people to e-<br/>
mail the numbers to him so he could collect a and post a master list <br/>
of numbers.<br/>
<br/>
One problem with this system is that everyone said they would go take <br/>
some numbers, and then never did (I&#39;m guilty of this as well.)  As a <br/>
result, there are a lot of holes in the tables, or large ranges where <br/>
no one actually calculated the numbers.  I had a choice of either <br/>
trying to interpolate the numbers, or just go with the last number <br/>
known.  <br/>
<br/>
These days we know a lot more of the fomulas and although I know some <br/>
of them are wrong, they&#39;re pretty close.  (They&#39;re only wrong by a <br/>
point or two.)  So with the last version I&#39;ve switched over to <br/>
formulas because I&#39;d rather have a close approximation for my level, <br/>
than a value that&#39;s 20 levels beneath me.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, the 2nd page of the spreadsheet tries to explain this, but I&#39;m <br/>
not sure how good of a job I did ;), and the 3rd page of the <br/>
spreadsheet actually has the tables used.<br/>
<br/>
Re: It&#39;s 40 points for a lute?  Good to know :)  Do you know if the <br/>
40 points multiplied by the string instrumet bonus?  Thanks for your <br/>
updates and encouragement!<br/>
