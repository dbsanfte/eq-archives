<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039313376">Perhaps the song is more useful.  I was Pixie Striking Sonic Bats and Lava<br/>
Beetles in Sol B last night and I thought it seemed like I was having a<br/>
pretty good run of luck.  I definitely *do* remember its giving me the<br/>
message and the bats hitting me soon after, but maybe that was just an<br/>
ordinary short stun.  Man it feels good to stun those bats for a change.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I was grouped with a very nice 50th level Necromancer named<br/>
Cryonax last night.  Cryonax was the 2nd person to hit level 50 Fennin Ro -<br/>
and he still plays just for fun.  He said the first level 50 was Bohdidarma<br/>
(sp?) - a monk!<br/>

&gt; If you use it on yourself, it&#39;s either resist or stun.  It<br/>
&gt; seems to be more effective against mobs as well, although it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; resisted more now that they added the MR debuff to it (or<br/>
&gt; maybe all the mobs I&#39;ve been fighting lately have MR buffs).<br/>
&gt; There are still cases of the song seemingly not working, but<br/>
&gt; they are not frequent enough for me to consider the song less<br/>
&gt; than useless.<br/>
