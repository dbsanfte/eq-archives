&gt; Well since we are the Jack of All Trades (Master of None) I just take it in <br/>

&gt; As always, it depends on the situation. Sometimes a bard might be better, <br/>
&gt; sometimes a specific class would be better. Besides, if you&#39;re grouped with <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you are misreading what he said and allowing your emotional<br/>
attachment to your character cloud your vision of the bard&#39;s<br/>
effectiveness. He didn&#39;t mean a bard would be kicked from a group to<br/>
make room for an enchanter. In the high level game that doesn&#39;t happen<br/>
because groups don&#39;t form unless they have an enchanter anyway.<br/>
<br/>
As to enchanters being happy to have you in the group, every caster<br/>
loves the mana song just like every caster loves clarity. Some of us<br/>
aspired to being a little more than a mana pump when we reached the<br/>
pinnacle of our class at higher levels. With the latest patch you can<br/>
now add ineffective haste to our ineffective crowd control in our list<br/>
of defining abilities.<br/>
