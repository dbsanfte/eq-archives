&gt;umm, it would be pointless in normal combat situations?  why? cuz you can&#39;t<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, your turn to be cranky I guess.  Oh well, we&#39;re all entitled.  Nah it<br/>
isn&#39;t that I couldn&#39;t swing weapons really.  It&#39;s that if I am Lullabying<br/>
with a Lute I literally cannot do anything else until Lullaby is no longer<br/>
needed.  I may as well walk off and get a sandwich.  At least if I could<br/>
swing my weapons I be doing something other than just watching the screen<br/>
waiting till we were down to one mob.  Now if Lullaby required a Lute and<br/>
lasted two ticks I&#39;d be ecstatic about the change.  Then I could argue with<br/>
all my elist friends over what song was best to twist in between rounds of<br/>
Lullaby. ;-)<br/>
