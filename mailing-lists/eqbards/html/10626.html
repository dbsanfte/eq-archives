   I was looking at the list of instruments and songs from the concert hall, and I saw some info that concerdicted the song and instrument list from this site.  I was wondering if any of you have tested the following songs and instruments, and know which site is correct.<br/>
<br/>
song: Denon&#39;s Desparate Dirge, Lev 43, this site says damage is 311+(lev-43)*2 making MAX dame at Lev 50 only 325, and does not say anything about mana; CH says it does 275 dam and requires 800mana?<br/>
<br/>
Instrument: Mistmore battle drums: this site says +20%; CH says +25%<br/>
<br/>
Instrument: Lute of the gypsy princes: this site says no effect; CH says +5%<br/>
<br/>
   Was just wondering if anyone can conferm which site is correct? I am only Lev 22, with no unique instruments, so can not test them, but I am on Bristlebane and if any of you High Lev Bards on Bristlebane can give me or help me obtain the MM Drum and Princes Lute, I will be more then happy to both Pay for the Item and Test them!  HEHE HAHA *LOL*<br/>

P.S&gt; I was wondering if any of you Insturment Figting Bard know about fighting Pickclaws in High Keep?  I was wondering because someone replayed to my post about fighting without weapons, saying it is hard in ereas such as the Aviak Village do to the AE songs DDD or CoT going all the way to the groud and the Aviak there will attack you.  I was wondering if these two songs will go up (i.e. in the basement of High Keep where the pickclaws spawn, two Levels above them are some romming gaurds)and have them come down and kill me?</div>
