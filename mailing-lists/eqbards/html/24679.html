  All The Skill Analsys&#39; Are Wrong      <br/>
  by KingOfFoolsTony       <br/>

  This is just a minor error but many of the skills say (Levl +1) * 5 but <br/>
  thats wrong, its (level *5) + 5<br/>

  Windleaf wipes the tears from his eyes from laughing so hard.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve just got to believe it was a joke, but I don&#39;t have faith that <br/>
  people&#39;s algebra skills are all that great.<br/>
