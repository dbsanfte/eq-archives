<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001027666">i say buy em:<br/>
<br/>
1) they look better, most important factor =)<br/>
2) 2k is extremely cheap for them.<br/>
3) 50 is a very low level to go to the area that they drop in.<br/>
4) they drop off a named mob whose common drop is nothing and whose rare<br/>
drop is the arms.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I didn&#39;t consider the STR factor.  I am a wimpy bard in <br/>
&gt; regards to STR, with<br/>
&gt; mine barely being over 100.  If I didn&#39;t have some weight <br/>
&gt; reducing bags, I<br/>
&gt; could never loot FS weapons to sell for cash without <br/>
&gt; exceeding my weight<br/>
&gt; capacity.  If I switched to the SS arms, not only would I <br/>
&gt; lose the STR bonus<br/>
&gt; for the SotA, but the extra weight from the SS arms would <br/>
&gt; make my situation<br/>
&gt; even worse.  So guess I will stick with SotA for now.<br/>
