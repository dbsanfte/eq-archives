<div id="ygrps-yiv-647502863">People should discuss Loot Rules *before* you start the raid so that<br/>
*everyone* understands how loot will be distributed:<br/>
<br/>
all random on all items<br/>
<br/>
some guru decides who gets what or who gets to roll for what<br/>
<br/>
alpha loot - splits off (double a&#39;s go last) heh, been a while since<br/>

<br/>
Especially pick-up groups.  Why go if you wont get paid?  In a pick-up<br/>
group, I believe that everyone should be allowed to roll for any item they<br/>
want.  Also, if stated ahead of time, once you win a roll, you dont roll<br/>
until every one wins something.  Thats for pickup groups.  In my guild<br/>
groups, we go by our guild policy which is based on highest and best use of<br/>
items, etc. and GM or raid leader has final say<br/>

Miriana posted that link before but there it is again. I am sure there are<br/>
other good loot schemes but to me the most important factor is knowing what<br/>
the rules are before you play the game.  Do not go on those stoopid pick-up<br/>
raids unless you have a clear understand of how loot will be distributed -<br/>
ahead of time.<br/>

&gt; Last night on Veeshan a few members from 3-4 guilds participated in a Fire<br/>
&gt; Giant run,<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I just thought I would post this here and see whether you guys and girls<br/>
&gt; think I should of got to roll for this item? </span></blockquote></div>
