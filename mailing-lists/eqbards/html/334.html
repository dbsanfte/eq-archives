<b>Subject:</b> My Opinion on the soerbard stuff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658341327">I am REALLY enjoying this thread..<br/>
<br/>
You see IN-REAL-LIFE - I am a professional musician.  This is a big reason I<br/>
chose to be a bard (All they need to do is an a trombone as one of the brass<br/>
instruments in the game and I&#39;ll REALLY be happy!)<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know how &quot;realistic&#39; this whole thread thing is.  Mucisians are<br/>
very cliquish.  This whole Soerbard thing pretty much seems like a clique<br/>
type thing.  A lot of musicians only share &quot;gigs&quot; with other musicians in<br/>
their clique (often based on things like what college they went to, etc).<br/>

&gt;Damn.  Yall are like little children.  I love coming home, checking my<br/>
&gt;e-mail, and seeing I have 50 new mails, all gripes back and forth about<br/>
&gt;something that doesn&#39;t concern most of the people on the list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reminds me of one band I was in.  Huge screaming arguements broke out over<br/>
trivial issues.  The people who got the most upset it usually was stuff that<br/>
had nothing to do with them.  Fortunately for me - it was a salsa band - and<br/>
most of the arguements were in Spainish (which I don&#39;t speak) so I didn&#39;t<br/>
get sucked into them.  We can simulate this by having arguements in Elvish<br/>
so the Human bards won&#39;t be able to get involved...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did a recording session in January where we wasted the first hour (on the<br/>
clock in the recording studio) because the piano player refused to play<br/>
until we had a legal document.  Our lawyer had been out of town and then<br/>
sick - so we had to write one ourselves.  He subsequently quit the band and<br/>
demanded huge amounts of money for his rights to the recording - so the<br/>
whole session went down the drain.  It turned out to not be that bad - given<br/>
the mood of the guys in the band at the time- the recording wasn&#39;t very<br/>
good - so it was no great loss.<br/>
<br/>
(As an aside - the band was on the virge of breaking up - and after he and<br/>
another guy quit - and we fired a third - we are trying to turn the thing<br/>
around and are doing pretty good so far)...<br/>
<br/>
So anyways...  WELCOME TO MY WORLD!<br/>
<br/>
Just to add my two-cents about the Soerbard thing...  I haven&#39;t dealt with<br/>
these guys online - so I can&#39;t say anything.  But it&#39;s ridiculous -<br/>
particuarly in an online game (I&#39;ve been involved with these things for a<br/>
long time since Multi-player Battletech on GEnie) - to accuse someome of<br/>
libel.<br/>
<br/>
Simple criticisms to singing flames - are all parts of this.  We are all<br/>
role-playing fictional characters - libeling a fictional character!  Give me<br/>
a break.  (Well I guess our former Vice-President now Presidential candidate<br/>
got into a debate with a fictional character!)  Unwarranted flames are<br/>
criticizisable (is this a word?) but lets call it what it is and not libel.<br/>
<br/>
I too looked at their web site - and it&#39;s a nice site.  I receaced similarly<br/>
to Birk; it turned me off - that they keep the best info for members only -<br/>
but I don&#39;t criticize them.  It is their right.  If that&#39;s the guild they<br/>
want - that&#39;s their business.  It just made me less interested in joining.<br/>
The guild I&#39;d create would have most of that (perhaps all of it) completely<br/>
open.  Also - I think it&#39;s a bit steep to ask 10pp for all members.  If you<br/>
join at level 1 - and they&#39;re buying you songs, weapons, and armor - I&#39;m all<br/>
for it.  But I was already at level 7 or 8 when I found out about it - and<br/>
I&#39;ve never had more than 5 plat to my name (which pretty much gets wiped<br/>
when I level and buy the next song).  So to me - 10 plat is a HUGE amount of<br/>
money...<br/>
<br/>
To be honest - if I join a guild - I&#39;d be more interested in a guild that<br/>
isn&#39;t a class-only guild - and to have one to try to group in - and<br/>
obviously the best groups have different classes. Also - I&#39;m not going spend<br/>
time writing songs, etc for the game.  I don&#39;t have enough time in the day<br/>
to begin with - if I&#39;m writing music - it&#39;s for real-life where I hope to<br/>
maybe get it on a CD that people will (hopefully) pay money for (not that<br/>
I&#39;m much of a songwriter...)<br/>
<br/>
So anyway - I&#39;m rambling (like most bards do).  I&#39;ve never seen an online<br/>
game worth playing that didn&#39;t generate a large number of flame wars.  The<br/>
best thing to do is to pull up a lawn chair; get a stick and some<br/>
marshmellows or hot dogs - put on your sunglasses and enjoy the show!<br/>
