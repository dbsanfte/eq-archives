to see what you are contributing, then find another<br/>
group, another guild...whatever it takes.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it takes an extreme situation ... Screech,<br/>
the &quot;get out of death free&quot; song and lullaby, the &quot;nod<br/>
song&quot;, for as much as we gripe, it has saved my party<br/>
once or twice ... body recoveries from a bad place are<br/>
much easier with Shaury&#39;s ... <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line tho is there are enough people out there<br/>
that like having a bard around that you don&#39;t have to<br/>
stay with a bunch of folks who don&#39;t appreciate you.<br/>
