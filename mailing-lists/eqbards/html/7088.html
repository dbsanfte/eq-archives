<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001578717">My load times are from 2-4 minutes usually more towards 2.  I have seen<br/>
people playin this game with load times of 5 minutes, but how they do it I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine.  Those people actually have a far greater danger than you do<br/>
and can often die trying to zone out of Grobb.  It isn&#39;t they won&#39;t live<br/>
with danger, its that for many the danger is far greater than for those who<br/>
have DSL or better.<br/>
<br/>
Also for most the danger is intolerable because a guard can kill them in 4<br/>
hits.  Many people don&#39;t go to Guk until they are far higher in level than<br/>
was really intended.  I haven&#39;t gotten too many trains there because the<br/>
blue froggies don&#39;t run they fight me till they die.  Its easy to snare the<br/>
few that do run generally.  Convincing my groupmates who don&#39;t have<br/>
Acellerando to go is very difficult though.<br/>

Sounds like you&#39;ve had some bad experiences in Grobb. My condolences. The<br/>
/quit does work, I have had to use it myself. My load times are fairly fast,<br/>
so maybe that&#39;s the difference. <br/>
<br/>
I still consider binding in evil cities an option. Others don&#39;t because they<br/>
choose not to play with that level of danger. That&#39;s alright, I respect<br/>
that. I just am tired of hearing melee classes whine that the ONLY way to<br/>
fight in Cazic or Guk is to be bound in Freeport and that they hate the long<br/>
run back. It&#39;s not the ONLY way. It just may be the only way for some<br/>
individuals depending upon their danger tolerance level.<br/>

Yeah that&#39;s a good one.  You don&#39;t get to hit /quit or any other command.<br/>
You die before you zone in on your client as you zone in on the server for a<br/>
bit before you appear on the client side.  All you see is a never ending<br/>
stream of Loading...Please wait messages. No command bar, no reports of<br/>
damage, no view of Grobb, nothing, period.  And your supposed safe spot may<br/>
also be the real spot for a guard that&#39;s been trained temporarily elsewhere<br/>
which is worse if you don&#39;t know it.  He then returns to his spot every time<br/>
the server is reset, if he ever leaves it.  How do I know all this, there&#39;s<br/>
a lower level Kitasi on Solusek that was my first bard who listened to a<br/>
monk and got bound in Grobb.  Went from 12th to 9th before they lowered the<br/>
death penalty before I realized it wasn&#39;t some glitch and reset my computer.<br/>
Needless to say he hasn&#39;t seen any action since as I moved to a server where<br/>
I had friends who could bind.  Also only the time alive counts towards the<br/>
30seconds.  The time passing thru the Loading period doesn&#39;t so you die<br/>
however many times that guard can kill you before you react and cut the<br/>
connection plus the 30+ seconds of linkdead.<br/>
<br/>
	Kitasi<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a row in one of<br/>
these unfortunate instances. If you respawn and are immediately attacked by<br/>
a guard at your bind point, you need to use the /quit command. This<br/>
immediately exits you from the game without the 30 second camping wait. You<br/>
may need to wait a few minutes for that guard to return to his post before<br/>
reentering the game, or you may have to resort to moving the guard with a<br/>
mule character. Such are the dangers inherent in binding in enemy territory.<br/>
But again, that does not mean it&#39;s not feasible. Just dangerous. Everyone&#39;s<br/>
personal limit of danger varies.<br/>
