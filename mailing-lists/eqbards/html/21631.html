<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759425426">hey all,<br/>
<br/>
i heared you talking about bards and their problems getting into groups just<br/>
before the transformation into a manabattery at 32. i didnt have problems<br/>
finding a group but have been frequently asked for that song, finally made a<br/>
hotkey &quot;/g i get manasong at lvl 32, sorry&quot; ;)<br/>
then i grouped with a shaman and noticed him losing health. i asked him and<br/>
he told me he was transforming hp into mana. hey, i thought, this turns<br/>
healsong into manasong! it worked out well of course.<br/>
do you have any experience with that? at wich level do shamans get this<br/>
spell? can other classes do this as well (necros)? if yes it would be<br/>
interesting to see what is more effective, manasong or healsong while the<br/>
casters eat their legs.<br/>
and then, try weaving heal and manasong with this tactic. should be very low<br/>
downtime for shamans this way.<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
