<div id="ygrps-yiv-415279337">I never hunted Dalnir was too high - but (on Xegony at the time at least) -<br/>
it was a heavily camped zoned - and those were a common drop - so a simple<br/>
trip to zone and a shot and I got it and was on my merry way.<br/>
<br/>
Kaesoria is a rarely camped zone - so I had to put a group together.  The<br/>
problem is its an ultra-random drop.  Some people get theirs after clearing<br/>
the area once - others have had to spend two evenings to get the mob.  You<br/>
need a good mob - and will have to fight your way down.  At your level it<br/>
won&#39;t be easy - but will be fun and get you some XP (I was in my mid-upper<br/>
40&#39;s IIRC)<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Tambourine<br/>
<br/>
Got my 4th coin for the tambourine quest today in Emerald jungle.<br/>
<br/>
Two coins left... the kaesora coin and the dalnir coin.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate any stories/remembrances from anyone getting these<br/>
coins.  Looks like I need 40 - 45 lvl group to get either, but how much<br/>
luck have people had by just shouting from zone in either place?<br/>
<br/>
any info appreciated.  Really looking forward to that tambourine<br/>
