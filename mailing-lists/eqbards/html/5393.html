     A little made jewelry lore.<br/>
      <br/>
       (My friend is an enchanter jeweler.)  Each gem has a specific  <br/>
     magical effect. (plus str, plus ac and magic resist, pus str and dex  <br/>
     for example)  This gem can be combined with 4 different types of  <br/>
     enchanted metal for increasing effect.  silver, electrum, gold and  <br/>
     platinum in order of strength.  Thus a cat&#39;s eye gem combined with  <br/>
     gold is better then the same gem with electrum  (7 vrs 4) This is a  <br/>
     VERY expensive trade to work your skill up in and most jewelers are  <br/>
     only doing gold and that with about half the gems.  The more powerful  <br/>
     the gem the higher skill level that is needed.  I have yet to see any  <br/>
     platinum made jewelry.  Each plat bar costs 110pp and your probably  <br/>
     familiar with how many failures it takes to build up your skill at any  <br/>
     trade.  A failure destroys the metal and gem...  (lets see, a platinum  <br/>
     bar (110) and a ruby(120) ooops failure,  thats 230pp down the drain)<br/>
      <br/>
     So gold jewelry is better then electrum with the same gem.  To make it  <br/>
     even more confusing the type of item changes depending on the metal.   <br/>
     A certain gem combined with silver may be an earring but with gold a  <br/>
     necklace.  There is no hard rule for the level of bonus but this is a  <br/>
     ROUGH guide  <br/>
      <br/>
     Metal     stat Plus    hp/mp plus<br/>
     silver      2-3           5<br/>
     electrum    3-5           10<br/>
     gold        4-7           15-20<br/>
     platinum    5-?           20-35<br/>
      <br/>
     Better gems may have more then one effect.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
     If you ever get a black pearl or a diamond as loot DON&#39;T sell them!<br/>
      <br/>
     Save them till you find a good jeweler and commission him/her to make  <br/>
     jewelry for you.  Those two gems are tops as far as I can tell and are  <br/>
     only available as loot.  Most gems can be bought from vendors but not  <br/>
     the very best ones.  Black pearls add to both str and dex and diamonds  <br/>
     add to 4 different things!   <br/>
      <br/>
     There are many web sites with this info but I though I&#39;d give you all  <br/>
     a quick refresher.<br/>

About the bracelets, you said you have electrum cat&#39;s  <br/>
eye, which is funny because mine are golden cat&#39;s eye,  <br/>
but they are +7 each.  I bought them, didn&#39;t ask where  <br/>
they got them, though.<br/>
