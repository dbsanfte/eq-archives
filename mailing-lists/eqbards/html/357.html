<b>Subject:</b> Roleplaying the details <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393715295">When truly roleplaying the details are important.  who is going to buy<br/>
a bard in platemail gauntlets?  for a weapon i would say longsword<br/>
(ok),rapier(ugh), shortsword(Ugh), or dagger (UGH).  armor i wouldn&#39;t<br/>
go higher than chain or ringmail, though realistically one of the<br/>
variants of leather is probably your best bet.  an image of a bard in<br/>
studded leather looks quite pleasing to me.  yes this detracts from<br/>
your raw killing power.  that is a completely different roleplay.  you<br/>
could be the somewhat askew bard that sing madly to himself whilst<br/>
hacking at a skeleton, or whistles merrily while looting a corpse. <br/>
this guy would be perfect in full plate with a mino axe.  it is your<br/>
choice, but roleplaying always adds to the fun.<br/>
