<div id="ygrps-yiv-752878601">Isn&#39;t 120 CHR a breakpoint for crowd control?  For example, assuming your<br/>
level and mob level stays the same, a bard with a 120 charisma will get<br/>
charm/pixie strike to stick a lot easier than if their charisma is 119 or<br/>
lower.  I vaguely recall someone posting that a long time ago.<br/>

&gt;Not sure how practical that is, yet.  Not much chance to try.  I&#39;ll be out<br/>

ac and hp if you are going to charm, cuz you WILL get hit in between charms,<br/>
and occasionally they will stun you and it&#39;ll take a few secs to get the<br/>
charm off,<br/>
etc etc.<br/>
