<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603413239">Level 12 characters can solo just about anywhere really.  For dungeons you<br/>
just have to usually go a bit deeper.  I would suggest travelling somewhere,<br/>
just travel until you happen on a good place to get bound.  Try Halas, bards<br/>
are a bit rare there for some reason, and are always appreciated.  If you&#39;d<br/>
rather solo, and want an area to hunt without the crowds, try Southern Ro,<br/>
or even get bound in Erudin.  Dunegeon there bereft of other players, with<br/>
green and blue catpeople to slaughter.  One could even potentially solo in<br/>
Crushbone at level 12, the only problem being all the competition and<br/>
campers.<br/>
<br/>
Must agree that teaming with a monk works rather well!  My monk friend is<br/>
decked out in full woven armor (a benefit from knowing a bard who spent a<br/>
good deal of time in Guk, a fun little madhouse).  We were fighting<br/>
scarecrows in Karanas, these things conning red to him but yellow to me.  I,<br/>
with only a fine steel weapon, could not join in the blows, but with only<br/>
bellow and sing an anthem whatnot.  We were doing very very well.<br/>

&gt;Starting from level 10, though, I found that soloing became increasingly<br/>
&gt;difficult.  At level 12 it got a big boost from the Bellow song, which<br/>
&gt;probably increased my combat effectiveness by fifty percent.  But as you<br/>
&gt; increase in level, you will find yourself much more effective in a party<br/>
&gt;than solo.  I found that teaming up with Monks works especially well.  Even<br/>
&gt;if I did nothing but stand there and play the lute twiddling between<br/>
&gt;healing song and battlesong (and hit with an occasional punch for a few<br/>
&gt;points), the monks and I together got far more experience than either could<br/>
&gt;manage on our own, since they fought better and didn&#39;t have to wait so long<br/>
&gt;between battles to recover.<br/>
