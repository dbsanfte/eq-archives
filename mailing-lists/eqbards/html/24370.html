&gt; &gt;SADDERZ for me, i&#39;m gonna have to drag my sorry butt out of sebilis to <br/>
&gt;run<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;town to buy food and water now.  (well mostly water)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t yaz know any helpful clerics/magicians?<br/>
&gt;Summoning Food and Water 1 at a time was so painful, especially since it<br/>
&gt;takes away from /gems time. ;-p<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know it sounds stupid, but I supply water for a good wizard friend.  What <br/>
I had found useful about the Singing Steel boots is that I can summon maybe <br/>
3 pods of water from them, and then drink that while I build up my stock of <br/>
foraged water.  Now, I was only on for a few minutes last night, so I wasn&#39;t <br/>
in a group, but so far the boots effect seems to be self-only (unless it&#39;s <br/>
the whole group).  I tried targetting someone and clicking my heels together <br/>
(hehe) and it lev&#39;d myself only.<br/>
<br/>
Now the greaves having screech as a right-click effect is awesome.  Very <br/>
handy.  I just wish they&#39;d stop putting humerous effects on the pants... <br/>
(ahh, you&#39;re hungry?  Let&#39;s see if I can dig up some food out of my pants... <br/>
   has now been replaced by:  &lt;group&gt; EVAC EVAC!!!  &lt;me&gt; Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll <br/>
wiggle my butt at them and we can get away!  &lt;mobs&gt;  Ewww, stinky, let&#39;s get <br/>
out of here!<br/>
