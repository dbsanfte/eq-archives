&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whooop !!! I spent several hours last night making macros from socials<br/>
&gt; and testing them. Ortez [sp?], the green orc in S Ro that heals himself<br/>
&gt; makes and excellent test subject BTW. Here is what I found with examples<br/>
&gt; listed below.<br/>
&gt; 1. The shortest delay with my equipment and my DSL connection I could<br/>
&gt; get was for all practical purposes      was 30.<br/>
&gt; I might get as low as 28, but start &quot;losing&quot; songs out of the<br/>
&gt; rotation when they don&#39;t have time to get<br/>
&gt; up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. The &quot;/stopsong&quot; command is essential and takes up an entire line by<br/>
&gt; itself. This has a limiting effect on how many songs your can<br/>
&gt; practically use. TWO. You CAN make a macro to sing 3 songs but the last<br/>
&gt; song will stay on and you will have to stop it manually. ....Well, there<br/>
&gt; is a way around it but if you don&#39;t have excellent timing you either get<br/>
&gt; the &quot;Chat screen shivers&quot; , when it shakes telling you you have<br/>
&gt; conflicting commands trying to be processed or the first song seems to<br/>
&gt; drop out of the rotation. My attempt at a single 3 song macro looks like<br/>
&gt; this. Resist messages did not stop the macro for continuing. Missed<br/>
&gt; notes MAY HAVE messed up the timing though... I do know that if I missed<br/>
&gt; a note the macro continued but the timing seemed thrown off enough that<br/>
&gt; the following song had trouble coming up. Not sure about this yet but<br/>
&gt; the solution was easy. Wait and hit the macro again to resynch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3SNG (Macro name, 3 song)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong (to stop the last macro or song that is presumable still going<br/>
&gt; on)<br/>
&gt; /pause 30, /cast 3 (Fufils)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong<br/>
&gt; /pause 30, /cast 4 (Chant of Cold)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong<br/>
&gt; /cast 4 (Chant of Flame) Note.. no pause line needed.. it just plays on<br/>
&gt; anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. Suddenly last night I was able to twist FOUR songs 80 percent of the<br/>
&gt; time ! Never been able to do that with my machine before ! I think this<br/>
&gt; is because Macros remove any Keying errors and inefficiencies in timing<br/>
&gt; from my twisting :) The trick here was to set up 2 macros of 2 songs<br/>
&gt; each.... Run Song and 3 Chants. Run song might flicker but often the<br/>
&gt; icon would just stay up. I tried putting in a line like /say Hit it<br/>
&gt; again Sam ! as a visual indicator a macro was done but found that it<br/>
&gt; just took time away and you knew from the Icon greying/light when a<br/>
&gt; macro was finished.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTL 1 (Label for &quot;Battle song 1 macro)<br/>
&gt; /pause 30, /cast 8 (run song)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong<br/>
&gt; /pause 30, /cast 3 (Fufils chant)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTL 2 (name of second macro)<br/>
&gt; /pause 30, /cast 4 (Chant of Cold)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong<br/>
&gt; /pause 30, /cast 5 (Chant of Fire)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4. They most popular use of the new macro will be the Run/Levitation<br/>
&gt; combination. You CAN keep the Tracking screen UP !!! using a macro<br/>
&gt; similar to the one below. Note, Lev FIRST (just in case) and the line to<br/>
&gt; give yourself a visual signal in the chat window the macro is done. I<br/>
&gt; found I had at lest 12 seconds grace before having to refresh the macro<br/>
&gt; if I got distracted. (Why do I feel that unless I want invisibility, I<br/>
&gt; am not going to be using the level 51 Selo&#39;s Song of Travel much ?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FlyMe (Macro name)<br/>
&gt; /pause 30, /cast 6 (Levitation. Put first because I don&#39;t want my teeth<br/>
&gt; jarred :)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong<br/>
&gt; /pause 30, /cast 8 (Run song)<br/>
&gt; /stopsong<br/>
&gt; /say Fly Me ! (Chat Screen visual cue for when tracking screen covers<br/>
&gt; your song icons)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5. I also made Macros combining Heal Song, Mana Song and Niv&#39;s so I can<br/>
&gt; keep Mana up while healing the party which reduces keystrokes.<br/>
&gt; 6. I found that &quot;/pause 30&quot; on a line by itself MAY be required if your<br/>
&gt; mixing Cast and Say type commands in some situations. The &quot;/pause 30&quot;<br/>
&gt; line ALWAYS has to be the first statement of a line even though it is<br/>
&gt; executed after the second statement. Whenever I tried to make a line<br/>
&gt; with more than 2 statements in it I got garbage. This should be further<br/>
&gt; investigated to be sure. Might just be me :)<br/>
&gt; 7. Finally, if you want to switch songs between battles, say to drop<br/>
&gt; out a chant for a Heat shield, a simple right click on the icon brings<br/>
&gt; up the macro and you only have to retype one line.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am sure more sophisticated programmers out there can come up with<br/>
&gt; better Macros :) but I hope this will help you get started.<br/>
