<div id="ygrps-yiv-837717636">As you progress in levels, every &#39;new&#39; worded category for your skills<br/>
represents the next 10 skill points.  Awful = 0-10, Feeble = 11 -20, and so<br/>
on.  I decided to download a skill table (I think it was from EQ Stratics)<br/>
that gave a chart of what all the worded categories mean.  Right now most of<br/>
my skills that I use say they are &#39;Very Good&#39;, which indicates between 81 to<br/>
90.  The only  one that did not follow the &#39;10 point&#39; standard was good,<br/>
which was from 61 to 80.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Shouldn&#39;t take more than a<br/>

&gt; blue<br/>
&gt; &gt;or higher to increase the skills.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there any clean way to tell if you have a skill maxed?  Sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; very long time between seeing the numbers on an improvement message, if<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; see it at all in the flurry of battle, and sometimes they seem to pile on<br/>
&gt; one another.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would it really be so intrusive as a game mechanism if the numbers for<br/>
&gt; present and maximum skill appeared on the Skills screen, especially since<br/>
&gt; the numbers show up on the improvement messages and since some skills,<br/>
&gt; such<br/>
&gt; as trade skills, tell you when you&#39;re doing something trivial.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t use things like /loc, but I find Awful, Feeble, and such to lack<br/>
&gt; sufficient granularity or sense of progress or limits.  I&#39;d settle quite<br/>
&gt; happily for somthing graphical, similar to the experience or health bar<br/>
&gt; graphs.  As it is the interface is an inconsistent jumble of graphics and<br/>
&gt; numbers with little to help relate them to one another.<br/>
