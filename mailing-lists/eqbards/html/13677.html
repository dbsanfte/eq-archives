<b>Subject:</b> Fear song in dungeons (was perma bug/exploit) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141496122">I&#39;ve only used the fear song for two situations.  First one is in outside<br/>
zones combined with chains to solo mobs.  Second situation is whenever I&#39;m<br/>
fleeing to the zone.  I&#39;ve never used it during a regular combat because I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to risk starting a train.  As a result, I&#39;m not certain how it<br/>
affects mobs inside a dungeon.  Lets use the predator room in Sol A as an<br/>
example.  This room is enclosed and only accessed by two doors. One door<br/>
leads to the foreman room.  The other door leads to the hallway where the<br/>
predator actually spawns.  Lets say your fighting mobs in this room and you<br/>
use the fear song.  Will the mobs open one of the doors and flee or will<br/>
they just ran around the room?  I assume mobs in every zone will open doors<br/>
when feared/fleeing but just want to confirm.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if there was a Wizard Lock spell in the game that works<br/>
similar to the old AD&D spell.  Would be a major way to handle crowd<br/>
control.  Pull a few mobs into an enclosed room, Wizard Lock the door, use<br/>
Fear song, then pick them off one by one:-)<br/>

&gt; really need to see more goblin crack) towards the gated trestles, opens<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; smaller first, stops, turns, opens the larger second, runs to the facing<br/>
&gt; wall then despawns.<br/>
