<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Plane tactics for bards <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388077521">The very *first* thing I would suggest is waiting a little while.  Be at<br/>
*least* 2/3 through 46 before you go up, or 47, preferably.  And that is<br/>
just for Hate.  Fear has a far greater chance of un-ressable corpses, so<br/>
I would suggest being a solid 47 before heading there.<br/>
<br/>
As for tactics, I can only comment on Hate--my friends will not take me<br/>
to Fear until I gain another level or two, as they know all too well what<br/>
happens when a yound bard bites it up there.  I know many of the bards on<br/>
this list will agree, but the best tactic I have found in Hate has been<br/>
mana only.  Keep in mind, my situations are *very* specific.  We only<br/>
fight on the far side away from Inny and Maestro (we tend to sit halfway<br/>
down that far wall and pick off all the clerics and such before pulling<br/>
more).  In addition, we have a *minimum* of one shammy per tank group,<br/>
for all the buffing we need.  My group consists of myself, one of the two<br/>
enchanters, a cleric (this makes for a neigh well unkillable enchie),<br/>
assorted other casters, and (occasionally) one tank who can taunt off the<br/>
enchie, but not always.  We certainly aren&#39;t the highest damage group,<br/>
but with all the casters we often steal the kill.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, it can be considered a little tedious to just sing mana and hack<br/>
away at whatever-it-is, but for my first few times in Hate it was great<br/>
for helping other people and even better for letting me learn the way<br/>
things go before trying anything that might get me (or us) killed. <br/>
Having always been a fan of safely learning your surroundings before<br/>
plunging in too deep, this works out great for me.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, all the little details have to be remembered--tons of great<br/>
shammies who can buff everyone up the wazoo, the right combo of mobs, a<br/>
great puller, and--most importantly--and organizer who *really* knows<br/>
what he is doing.  Not being in a planes-capable guild, I consider myself<br/>
lucky to have gotten into this loose coalition where I can have tons of<br/>
fun with people I like, own our corner of the plane, and not be chewing<br/>
my fingernails in terror the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s my take on it.  Your results may vary ;)<br/>
