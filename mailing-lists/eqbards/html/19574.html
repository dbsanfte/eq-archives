<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053134510">I thought I&#39;d share my sob story with the list:<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe not the whole story as you all have heard it a thousand <br/>
times... <br/>
<br/>
MM Drum slides thru crack in Hotkeys and promptly poofs when it hits <br/>
the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of messing around in MM (I ended up starting a doozy of a <br/>
train exploring with the never reliable invis), I decided to go for <br/>
the Nostrolo Tamborine.  So, I thought I&#39;d share my successes with <br/>
those who might want to grab it.<br/>
<br/>
The Tamborine is NO DROP but the coins aren&#39;t, meaning all those <br/>
little coins are worthless to anyone holding them, unless they&#39;re a <br/>
Bard!  Remember this. :)<br/>
<br/>
There are 6 coins.  <br/>
1 is in Lake of Ill Omen on the bloodgill goblins who you can find <br/>
under each of the platforms in the lake.  Pretty common drop from a <br/>
VERY common mob.  <br/>
2 is foraged in the Emerald Jungle.  I hit forage twice before <br/>
someone answered my shout for it.<br/>
3 is in City of Mist on the Captain of the Guard.  A friend gave me <br/>
this coin, so I don&#39;t know how hard this one is to get.  A shout to <br/>
the zone will probably turn up something before long.<br/>
4 is in Kaesora.  This one appears more difficult as the Failed <br/>
Raider is pretty rare.  I bought the coin from a guy camping down <br/>
there who had 4 coins.<br/>
5 is in Dalnir on the Kly Implicator.  I found a guy in Warsilkwoods <br/>
at the zone to Dalnir who had 3 coins.  He was destroying them as he <br/>
had so many.  I think I&#39;m going to go back into Dalnir to explore a <br/>
bit as this zone looks pretty fun.<br/>
6 is on a Scorp (sp?) Scrounger in The Overthere.  In the middle of <br/>
the zone there is a large ravine.  There are tons of Scorp things and <br/>
a few scroungers scattered throughout.  They&#39;re all casters making it <br/>
tough to solo, but their aggro ranges are real small, allowing you to <br/>
isolate 1 fairly easy.  I tried dots, melee, and charming methods <br/>
before getting my GF&#39;s Mage to come over and help.  Fairly easy kill <br/>
with a 51 Earth pet beating the crap out of them.  First drop, 1 <br/>
coin.  Had a difficult time finding anyone with a coin or even anyone <br/>
who knew where they dropped in this zone, so getting it yourself is <br/>
probably the best bet.  Luckily, it&#39;s probably the easiest to get <br/>
yourself. :)<br/>
<br/>
So... don&#39;t be intimidated by this quest if you&#39;re without a MM Drum <br/>
or even if you have one.  If you can get to the zone, you can <br/>
probably find someone to sell or give you the coin in no time.  And <br/>
not only does the Tamborine have a slightly higher effect than the MM <br/>
Drum you also won&#39;t be dropping it.  Ever. :)<br/>

p.s. Anyone on Xegony who would like the coin from Dalnir (I have 2 <br/>
extras) gimme a tell in game.</div>
