  voice on here and not blow up on them after reading into a post,<br/>
  where I&#39;ve cleared misunderstood.  Sylly is an exception, I get<br/>
  to flame her continually until she stops these silly dragon raids<br/>
  and starts getting more levels.<br/>

&gt; frustrating.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I have heard too many people say, the dragon breath weapon is gonna<br/>
  damage you, no matter what.  And that cold/fire resist won&#39;t cut the<br/>
  damage enough to be worth replacing better ac/stat armor out for.<br/>
  I&#39;m not experienced enough yet in dragon raids to know either way.<br/>
  I hear what you are saying, and am willing to try to go in with <br/>
  250 CR/HR to check it out.  But I&#39;ve heard other servers say the<br/>
  opposite, in that the Fear is the biggest problem.  I don&#39;t have<br/>
  enough time invested into raids yet to know.  Vox tried to fear<br/>
  me and I shrugged it off with MR 59.  I just don&#39;t know how big<br/>
  resistances are to anything anymore.<br/>
<br/>
  In a recent duel with a L50 cleric, with an MR 109, I resisted<br/>
  Flash of Light, Stun, Holy Might, and two other stuns they get.<br/>
  The guy couldn&#39;t get one utility spell off on me.  Then we<br/>
  tried offensive damage spells.  This is where is got all F&#39;d up.<br/>
  <br/>
  Retribution.  normally does what? 530ish dmg?<br/>
<br/>
  Mystic: MR 109, first cast 100 dmg, second cast 300 dmg (full hit).<br/>
  Ele/Gu: MR 161, first cast 200 dmg, second cast 250 dmg.<br/>
<br/>
  Never once did I outright resist the spell.  Resistances are<br/>
  very cloudy in my mind for dmg based effects right now.<br/>
