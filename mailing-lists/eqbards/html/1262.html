<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465605378">re: damage, i like meleeing so i got my strength up as much as i could<br/>
(currently 107) and i hit for 20dmg with a 5dmg 1h slashing weapon, so it<br/>
does get better.<br/>
 <br/>
re: soloing, i never solo.  i think the bard is built for grouping, so i<br/>
have one partner at the very minimum.  of course this gets more important<br/>
the higher level you get, as blue creatures double attack for 80-90dmg.  so<br/>
as far as being higher level and expecting to solo better, i wouldn&#39;t count<br/>
on it.  and i wouldn&#39;t worry about grouping at higher levels, once you hit<br/>
level 32 your mana song is a big hit and quite a valuable addition to any<br/>
group.<br/>
 <br/>
re: levelling, my path to levelling has been oasis til level 19, then<br/>
cazic-thule til level 38, now i am in solusek.  when i went to cazic<br/>
originally i was in a full group and usually was throughout my time there.<br/>
the only problem is i was a bit ahead and missed the crowd, and cazic is<br/>
packed now.<br/>

Hello fellow Bards,<br/>
 <br/>
Man i envy you bards that are in the high 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s,  how did u ever get<br/>
that high?  I seem to be stuck at lvl 15.  My question is focused at u<br/>
higher lvl bards.  The question is does the bard get better?  Don&#39;t get me<br/>
wrong i love my lvl 15 bard but when i comes to dishing out damage in a<br/>
battle i am weak.  I know the bard class is not designed to be a warrior,<br/>
but for example, i bought a mino axe at lvl 9,  i still dishes the same<br/>
amount of damage now at lvl 15 as it did at lvl 9 except for the below song<br/>
and it only does 8 damage.  I would like to solo eventually but i&#39;m afraid<br/>
because i have a hard time with creatures that con blue to me.  You high lvl<br/>
players, is the bard worth the wait?  Will we eventually do more damage and<br/>
be able to hold our own?  I love the bard class but i also like to know i am<br/>
a valuable addition to any group.  Higher in lvl&#39;s groups are looking for<br/>
wizards, tanks, and healers where do we fit in?  Just a little frustrated i<br/>
guess from dying 3 times in Unrest yesterday...<br/>
 <br/>
U higher lvl players post a message with your secrets to success... I need<br/>
it..hehe.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
