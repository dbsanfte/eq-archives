<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052530509">Yea, when I first saw their enhancements for &quot;hybrids&quot; I noticed bards were <br/>
left out and started thinking, &quot;Here we go again.&quot; But then I hit the <br/>
sections that specifically talked about bards. I&#39;m just glad they didn&#39;t <br/>
forget us or relegate us to the dreaded &quot;we&#39;ll fix it later&quot; status.<br/>
