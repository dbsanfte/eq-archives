&gt; Okay, cool, I&#39;ll give it a whirl.  Just out of curiosity, why don&#39;t you /log<br/>
&gt; everything, then just parse the times from the log file?  Is there some<br/>
&gt; inaccuracy associated with this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The times in the logfile (last I checked) are only accurate<br/>
to 1 second.  That gives a maximum possible error of 1.99<br/>
seconds.  Most of the tested times were around 60 seconds, so<br/>
a 2 second error translates into a +/- 3% margin of error.  <br/>
And that&#39;s before you take into account error due to lag.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could just leave it running for 5-10 minutes,<br/>
but that would mean it&#39;d take me several hours to do the 20-30<br/>
different tests.<br/>
