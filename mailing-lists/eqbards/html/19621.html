<div id="ygrps-yiv-174815558">umm, do you know what &#39;&#39;random&#39;&#39; means?  and have you taken any statistics courses?<br/>
do you honestly think that a sample size of 7 is statistically significant for a typical<br/>
random number generator?<br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s an example.  a pair of dice has 36 possible combinations.  roll the dice 7 times.<br/>
even assuming you don&#39;t duplicate any of those combinations during those 7 rolls, that<br/>
means you haven&#39;t rolled 29 of those combinations.  by the stats you&#39;ve accumulated<br/>
they have a 0% chance of occurring.  obviously false.  and that&#39;s only 36 combinations.<br/>

&gt;had two people so far claim it was &quot;easy to get&quot; and three (counting me)<br/>
&gt;reporting it difficult.  My good friend Darkfox who&#39;s on my server and this<br/>
&gt;list has also reported it&#39;s a &quot;Semi-Rare&quot; spawn...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I spent about four hours there.  Hooked up with a group 50-55 who were after<br/>
&gt;the named guy at the Church to get a fang for a quest for a key to get into<br/>
&gt;Howling Stones and to explore the zone.  They cleared the library - no<br/>
&gt;failed raider - no coin.  They had moved on by the time I got there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shortly after I joined them - another group came in to camp the library.<br/>
&gt;They were there a good three hours (by the time I moved on) maybe longer.<br/>
&gt;Unless they were bullshitting me (which I doubt) - they didn&#39;t get a single<br/>
&gt;Failed Raider - and nothing else dropped the coin.  They had a bard in their<br/>
&gt;group - so I was hoping they&#39;d get two.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I doubt they were bullshitting.  If they did get a bunch and were hoarding<br/>
&gt;them for various reasons; they fairly got the room while my group was<br/>
&gt;camping elsewhere - why would they lie?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We all know the rules of random sampling - a 2 hour sample of a 30 minute<br/>
&gt;spawn is 4 samples - you got a 50 pct hit.  Another group got six tried and<br/>
&gt;0 pct hit... (Plus my groups sample - they cleared the room only once<br/>
&gt;though)<br/>
