<div id="ygrps-yiv-714087875">Hello all , <br/>
	Its been a while since i&#39;ve posted on this list , but i&#39;ll just jump <br/>
right in.<br/>
	<br/>
1) I feel that dark elves should have the bard class open to them.  The evil <br/>
races in themselves are very limited in the classes allowed to them. I mean <br/>
whats really the big difference between ogres and trolls. yes they look <br/>
different , and yes they have different cultures and starting locations,  but <br/>
what really seperates them from each other? what makes an ogre stand out from <br/>
a troll ? nothing when it comes deep down to it.  Dark elves have more <br/>
classes open to them , but it still doesn&#39;t measure up to non evil races. <br/>
This is going to be a big thing on the upcoming race war server. <br/>
	Now , why should dark elfs be bards. They are intelligent , civilized <br/>
( evil but civilized) , and have a rich history. so they may sing evil songs <br/>
, or chant drums to evil ceremonies. big deal, doesn&#39;t take away from the <br/>
fact that it is song , and it is history. Now why should dark elfs be allowed <br/>
to be bards and not other races. Ok here goes Ogres- uncivilized and stupid , <br/>
same as trolls. Gnomes , they&#39;re all into their gadgets and don&#39; seem to <br/>
impressed with song.  Barbarians and haflings - earthy barbarians i wouldn&#39;t <br/>
exactly called civilized , their brains are bigger and their bodies are <br/>
smaller than trolls. but they still live in cold shacks in the ice and aren&#39;t <br/>
that smart.  For them its pretty much the stronger you are the better. <br/>
halflings seem like a racethat is in touch with nature, , to be honest they <br/>
just don&#39;t strike me as a race that would want to have bards. they seem more <br/>
like a race that is in touch with their surroundings ( nature , animals) than <br/>
they are with music and keeping history. Dwarves are all about work much like <br/>
gnomes, they are a rugged gruff race. and heck they already have a bunch of <br/>
classes open to them. ( struggling a bit there )  In any case i&#39;m interested <br/>
in seeing what others think of this , thats many why i posted it , so feel <br/>
free to disagree , and post it :)<br/>
<br/>
	Also , i can&#39;t seem to find an effective way to twist bellow with <br/>
others songs. i&#39;ve been trying to twist with heal or chords.  but i know in <br/>
the time i take to twist i could have already casted bellow twice. least <br/>
thats what it seems like. <br/>
<br/>
	And as far as bards having the ability to be bound anywhere. I agree <br/>
that it should be something like that. personally i feel most if not all <br/>
ahould be allowed to too. Of course if this was implemented i would it put in <br/>
a certain way. This is my possible solutions . 1 - put in more specific spots <br/>
that people can be bound at. not just the entrance to a dungeon or a city. <br/>
but a certain house , or landmark or something where you can be bound. Also <br/>
with this i would put level restrictions on it. when you get to a certain <br/>
level you can be bound at those spots , but not until then.  And as you <br/>
progress more bound areas become open to you. or perhaps once you accompish a <br/>
certain task for a gate keeper at the area of the bound spot before he lets <br/>
you in. something , anything is better than running 5 zones to get your <br/>
corpse back. I know its in an attempt at equality and in roleplaying. but it <br/>
isn&#39;t much fun, and it is time consuming. <br/>
<br/>
Ok if you&#39;ve made it this far - woohoo i&#39;m surprised <br/>
All replies are good replies - thanks<br/>
