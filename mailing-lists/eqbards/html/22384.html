&gt; &gt;       I&#39;ve been playing EQ since release - and have just<br/>
&gt; &gt; dinged to 51.  I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; never switched weapons during combat.  I agree with Rokenn<br/>
&gt; &gt; that it&#39;s only<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the most dedicated player.  Maybe it also has to do with<br/>
&gt; &gt; age (I&#39;m 38)<br/>
&gt; &gt; and lack of finger dexterity (I find it enough work to twist 3 songs)!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;       Also - I don&#39;t view leveling as a race.  The fact that<br/>
&gt; &gt; other people level a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot faster than I do doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;       It&#39;s a game - it&#39;s about having fun.  As Rokenn pointed<br/>
&gt; &gt; out for many of<br/>
&gt; &gt; us - the social aspect is as important or more important than the<br/>
&gt; &gt; accumulation of levels and items (please don&#39;t anyone view<br/>
&gt; &gt; this as a flame -<br/>
&gt; &gt; if that is your playing styles that cool and great - just a matter of<br/>
&gt; &gt; personal taste!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;       I pretty much ALWAYS twist in combat - and never in<br/>
&gt; &gt; down-time.  In certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; situations I will - but its very much the exception not the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rule.  I need to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do some socializing and rest the fingers!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Constant swapping for instruments and weapons is only for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; truely insane.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I may switch back and forth during a battle as is called for, but not<br/>
&gt; &gt; constantly.  You might want to remind your groupmate that EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; is after all a<br/>
&gt; &gt; social game and it is impossible to be social while twisting<br/>
&gt; &gt; constantly.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am in a group and all is well, I have no problem only<br/>
&gt; &gt; leaving one song<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing so I can chat with my friends, in group, tells, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; guildsay.  So<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell that monk to relax =)<br/>
