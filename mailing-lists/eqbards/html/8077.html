&gt; &gt;Actually, I agree with him.  &quot;Kiting&quot; has come to mean killing<br/>
&gt; &gt;a monster in a fashion which poses zero risk to yourself<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That may be your interpretation of the word, along with others,<br/>
&gt; but that is not what it means at all to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; kiting: to go in a rapid or flighty manner. (webster&#39;s)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kiting as the word in EQ has come to mean dragging around<br/>
&gt; a monster, much as you suggested some bard do with extra <br/>
&gt; bandits as he runs around with accelerando on.  Reversing<br/>
&gt; that role, you are not fleeing, rather following a fleeing<br/>
&gt; creature, is reverse-kiting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still, you realize this is a conversation of semantics, thus<br/>
&gt; it really has no room for argument.  I say tomato, you say<br/>
&gt; tomatoe.  Let it be, was my point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re missing the point.  Semantics aside, &quot;kiting&quot;<br/>
is a negative term in the minds of many EQ players (basically,<br/>
everyone who can&#39;t do it).  Wanting to apply the term to a<br/>
tactic most players would nod at if they fully understood it<br/>
is sheer lunacy.  I am all for semantically accurate<br/>
descriptions, however there is a matter of public perception<br/>
to consider in that the *wrong* definition may be substituted<br/>
for the correct one by those not so well informed.<br/>
<br/>
Why not just call bards exploiters?  One dictionary definition<br/>
of &quot;exploit&quot; is:<br/>
<br/>
To utilize; to make available; to get the value or usefulness<br/>
out of;<br/>
<br/>
And if anything bards are great at bringing out and making<br/>
available the full value and usefulness of group members&#39;<br/>
abilities.<br/>
