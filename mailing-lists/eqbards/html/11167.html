<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440332863">ZONE WARPS FIXED<br/>
Welhunlo reports that the zone warp which allowed you to hop across West<br/>
Karana by swimming under the water has now been fixed. It now bumps you back<br/>
onto the shore.<br/>
The warp in Commonlands has also been fixed. <br/>
<br/>
This was posted on Caster&#39;s Realm and from what I heard being shouted last<br/>
night it is apparently true.  Why is that Verant will go to any lengths<br/>
seemingly to fix any bug which might cause an unintentional beneficial<br/>
effect, yet totally ignore bugs which produce unintentional negative<br/>
effects?  There are several zones where mobs warp all the time, most notably<br/>
in my mind the semi newbie zone of Qeynos Hills.  Attacking things that flee<br/>
in that zone is mind-numbingly difficult without Root as they will nearly<br/>
always run a short distance then warp to the road near the zone line.  When<br/>
Holly gets trained to that spot the entire zone becomes her personal hunting<br/>
ground as every person who attacks a wolf that flees gets added to her hate<br/>
list while she is near that point.  Has Verant addressed this bug in any<br/>
way?  No.  They sure will fix a warp that might do nothing more beneficial<br/>
than save someone some time.  Not that I really approve of using such a<br/>
warp, I don&#39;t.  I certainly don&#39;t approve of Verant&#39;s devil-may-care<br/>
attitude towards warps that are not beneficial either.  They are equally<br/>
ridiculous, more disruptive of game atmosphere, and bigger causes of player<br/>
(hence customer, least important person in Verant client-provider<br/>
relationship) discomfort.  Just ask anyone who&#39;s ever been to Mistmoore how<br/>
they feel about warping.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t work at Verant that is.<br/>
