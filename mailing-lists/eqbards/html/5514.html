&gt; &gt; &gt;Want to hear something really bizarre? I was<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Highpass and when I got through the zone, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;was at the zone border that goes from Kithicor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to Highpass instead of inside the Keep zone. Woops.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ya got hit with an undocumented feature<br/>

&gt; The thing is, I didn&#39;t die nor was I being attacked<br/>
&gt; or chased. I was a few bubbles down on health due to<br/>
&gt; a previous fight (that ended) and when I rezoned in<br/>
&gt; the wrong place I was at full health. So that was<br/>
&gt; nifty at least - but at the time of hitting the zone,<br/>
&gt; I was nowhere near death and again, not being attacked.<br/>

happens if you get hit by lag or get disconnected at the right<br/>
moment while zoning.<br/>
