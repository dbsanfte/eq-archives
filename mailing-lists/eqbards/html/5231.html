&gt; &gt; Heck, I&#39;ve even had something cast at me through the walls<br/>
&gt; &gt; while I was in Lesser Faydark standing right next to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mistmoore zone.  I know this is supposed to be impossible, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t have believed it if it hadn&#39;t happened to me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Something with a Mistmoore-ish name behind the walls tagged me<br/>
&gt; &gt; with tashan and a DD.  I moved away from the zone and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; stopped casting at me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eh, I find this really really hard to believe, seeing as the mobs simply<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t exist in that zone. If you could go past the zone border, you&#39;d find<br/>
&gt; a dead end (I have friends who have done this when running from a train<br/>
&gt; and died -- bug). Also, if these mobs did exist, surely we&#39;d hear them<br/>
&gt; buff themselves. Additionally, they&#39;d showup on track.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More likely is that some of the fae drakes got stuck in the path to the<br/>
&gt; mistmoore zone. Several of them are enchanters/wizards and can even charm.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was not a fae drake.  Like I said, it was a Mistmoore-ish<br/>
name, fit in with the general theme of custodians, ushers,<br/>
shadowy scribes, etc.  I still don&#39;t understand what happened.<br/>
I don&#39;t really expect anyone to believe me - I have a hard<br/>
time believing it myself.<br/>
