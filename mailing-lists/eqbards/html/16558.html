<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655021775">Very neat idea.  Though wiping the hate list will get it turned down.  I can<br/>
see a LOT of uses for this song even without the hate list wipe.  What would<br/>
be even more cool is if they let it summon all party members regardless of<br/>
zone. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Interesting thought eh? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just my .02 cents.  After all we&#39;re talking over 50<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] New song idea<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: Jada &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:JadaKost@...">JadaKost@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trying to come up with a song that is<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) extremely powerful<br/>
&gt; 2) no other class has<br/>
&gt; 3) makes bards extremely wanted on raids (a la<br/>
&gt; enchanters)<br/>
&gt; 4) and has coding already built into the game<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I came up with a song that is the opposite of<br/>
&gt; Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion.  A song that teleports<br/>
&gt; all party members in the zone to the bards location.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Name: Melanie&#39;s Call to Arms<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This song would be extremely useful in conjuction with<br/>
&gt; a binding group leader.  Imagine doing an Efreeti Raid<br/>
&gt; in SolB and wanting to bring in other members since<br/>
&gt; some need to leave.  Instead of breaking through again<br/>
&gt; the group leader would be bound at zoneline, group up<br/>
&gt; the bard and gate back to his bindpoint.  The group<br/>
&gt; leader would then group up the 4 new members and the<br/>
&gt; song would be sung and would teleport everyone back to<br/>
&gt; the bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are a few problems with this that may make it<br/>
&gt; too powerful.  Such as Plane of Sky (never been<br/>
&gt; myself) where this song could not be used to bypass<br/>
&gt; the teleporters etc...  Also this song may need to<br/>
&gt; remove the party members from all hate lists or risk<br/>
&gt; causing a hellish train through the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it does remove everyone from hate list the song<br/>
&gt; becomes MUCH more powerful (too powerful?) in that in<br/>
&gt; Plane of Hate things go bad.  The bard runs up the<br/>
&gt; wall away from the fight and sings the song, everyone<br/>
&gt; teleports up the bard and is removed from hate list.<br/>
&gt; Therefore removing the need for clerics to camp out<br/>
&gt; etc...  This song combined with Selo&#39;s would make the<br/>
&gt; bard extremely wanted in any group, but especially<br/>
&gt; raids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The song may need to use up mana, although I really<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want all our songs using up mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please let me know what you all think.  Its just an<br/>
&gt; idea I came up with when I should be working =)<br/>
