<div id="ygrps-yiv-303780551">Absolutely!  Get a combine or other magic wep as soon as you can.  I bought<br/>
a combine LS when I was at level 6 (I am 8 now) - actually my warrior loaned<br/>
me the plat and I bought it for him but he lets me use it (oh the joys of 2<br/>
char&#39;s.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I go back to my Giant Snake Fang if I know that there will be no<br/>
magic baddies where I am.  I love the speed and even though I have a mino<br/>
axe - I am lacking the skill and it weighs so much  - I use the GSF.  <br/>
<br/>
But just last night, in the East Common Lands - we get jumped by an<br/>
invisible (yah how do you like that) air ellie-mental case.  Now aren&#39;t you<br/>
glad you learned how to use the /assist function to target something you<br/>
can&#39;t see? Our druid didn&#39;t and he&#39;s screaming &quot;how do you hit something you<br/>
cant even target??&quot;  Well, our wiz ran outta mana and then we basically<br/>
danced the ellie to a zone and our young druid fell in the confusion.<br/>
Enuf&#39;s - enuf - gimme my combine long sword!  Not going to take abuse like<br/>
that from low level magical baddies!<br/>
<br/>
I love the look of terror in their eyes when they realize they are NOT<br/>
invulnerable!~ Sylly hits a ghoul for 12 points of damage!<br/>
