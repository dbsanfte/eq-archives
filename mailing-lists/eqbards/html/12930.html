 </span></blockquote>As near as I can tell, the prices you get are based on<br/>
charisma, faction, and possibly race and diety.  With a 110<br/>
charisma, I was able to get the best possible prices from<br/>
indifferent merchants, but only some apprehensive merchants.  <br/>
With my current 154 charisma, I&#39;m able to get the best prices<br/>
from most apprehensive merchants.  I suppose it could be<br/>
capped at 120 cha (which is between 110 and 154), but based on<br/>
the extreme nonlinearity I saw when I tested prices at<br/>
different charisma from 75 to 110, I don&#39;t think Verant<br/>
would&#39;ve made it quite so simple.  Items do have a maximum<br/>
buy/minimum sell price though.<br/>

Btw, anyone notice they finally fixed the wood elf merchant<br/>
faction?  For the longest time, WE merchants viewed wood elves<br/>
apprehensively.  They&#39;re amiable now.<br/>
