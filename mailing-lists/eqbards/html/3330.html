Freeport after a long dungeoncrawl.  When I zoned into Nektulos Forest, I <br/>
managed to space and think I was in East Commons.  (The two zones look SO <br/>
much alike... NOT!)  So I turned left instead of right.  Didn&#39;t realize my <br/>
mistake until I got to the gates of Neriak and had 3 guards jump me. <br/>
 Fortunately, they didn&#39;t stun me too many times, so I was able to escape <br/>
and make it back to the zoneline with a bubble of health left.<br/>
