<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184928023"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I was surprised myself when it did so little damage.  It is too bad the game <br/>
&gt; does not tell you how much the AE breath does do, it would be easier to see <br/>
&gt; how effective CR/FR is.  All I know is that I will never do a dragon without <br/>
&gt; my dragon kit :)  At the Nag run I forgot my kit and had to get killed in a <br/>
&gt; duel to grap it from the bank.  One of the other bards at the Vox run was <br/>
&gt; NOT in any visible resist gear (in nearly full plane armor, level 50) and <br/>
&gt; she died, I finished with nearly full health.<br/>
