Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am on a mission today for STR increasing items (my base STR is 75 eeeuoo).<br/>
I have heard people like Shada talk about a purity belt.  What is it, how<br/>
much is it, and where can I get one?  Also I was wondering, besides<br/>
rubicite, is there another armor that has the very high AC and yet is light?<br/>
Is mesh an option for bards?  What exactly is mesh anyway?  I&#39;ve heard many<br/>
Looking to buy&#39;s but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever actually noticed anyone<br/>
wearing it.<br/>
<br/>
And my gripe of the day -- TWINKING HAS BECOME RAMPANT ON EROLLISI MARR!!!!!<br/>
I saw a lvl 5 bard yesterday walking through Freeport with a full suit of<br/>
bronze plate.  That&#39;s just silly.  He said a friend gave it to him, nice<br/>
gift.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my real life brother-in-law just started about 3 days<br/>
ago.  No sooner had his new character spawned at the Freeport gates than<br/>
some lvl 20+ came up and handed him a FS Rapier, asked if he wanted a 2H<br/>
instead and then waved and ran off almost before I could tell him how to say<br/>
thank you.<br/>
<br/>
So scratch the gripe unless it is an extreme case.  I guess I&#39;m just bent<br/>
because my bank account hovers between 5 and 20pp constantly so there&#39;s no<br/>
way I could buy plate or any other really cool items yet.<br/>
