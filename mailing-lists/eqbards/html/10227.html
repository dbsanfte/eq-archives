&gt; &gt; I would assume that if Chords of Cessation&#39;s slowing effect is messing up a <br/>

&gt;    Constant Chains breaks the Shaman Drowsy line.  Chains breaks any<br/>

watching for this when an enchanter friend cast a slowdown on<br/>
a mob we were fighting.  Her spell was a much greater slowdown<br/>
than Chain would&#39;ve caused, and based on my eyeball<br/>
observations (combat was too hectic to use a stopwatch) Chain<br/>
didn&#39;t override the spell.<br/>
