&gt;don&#39;t sing dots in a group, I&#39;ll leave the serious damage dealing to the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i&#39;ve been in more than one group where i had to contribute damage cuz we were<br/>
so pathetic.  here was one, sk, enc, dru, cle, me.  the druid nuked occasionally,<br/>
but sk&#39;s damage really isn&#39;t that good.  so i broke out the chants and helped out.<br/>
we cleared down to the bar in sebilis but then a couple folks had to leave.</div>
