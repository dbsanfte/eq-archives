<div id="ygrps-yiv-792743000">I had that happened to me last night in Qeynos Hills.  I <br/>
wish I could have gotten the name of the guy who did.<br/>
Luckily I already had my drum in my hand and playing<br/>
accelerando.  I had just dispatched an ugly gnoll and was<br/>
sitting outside of the entrance when I heard the &#39;leaping&#39; <br/>
sound and caught a glimpse of someone jumping over<br/>
me.  Next thing I see...<br/>

<br/>
The putrids do their putrid breath on me and I am up and<br/>
running and able to get away.<br/>

&gt; On the other side of the coin, I hate people who when attacked by a nasty<br/>
&gt; mob proceed to lead the train into unsuspecting players in hope of<br/>
&gt; transferring the train to them.  That happened to me last night while<br/>
&gt; hunting Crocs in Oasis.  I was healing the backside of the pillar.  When<br/>
&gt; someone who was being chased proceeded to train the SG across the water<br/>
&gt; and onto the pillar.  Sheer stupdity and callousness or just panic?  I<br/>
&gt; would think it would be the former. <br/>
