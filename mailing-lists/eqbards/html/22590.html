<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360928160">I almost got killed by Gorenaire when I was watching a guild fight her. I <br/>
was totally unbuffed and when her AE hit me it dropped me well under 30% <br/>
life so I hauled ass. =)  She cons kindly to me, and never agrroed me. I&#39;m <br/>
not sure what caused her to go aggro on you. During downtime in VP some <br/>
friends of mine decided to duel (don&#39;t EVER do this in VP), and Hoshkar, who <br/>
is kindly to me, stand right on top of me and kill them. His AE hit me HARD, <br/>
but he walked away after my friends died w/out aggroing me. *shrug*<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Side question about Gorenaire.  I was fighting along the castle north wall<br/>
&gt;in Dreads when a Gorenaire raid was going on.  I conned the dragon and I <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;either warmly or amiable.  So I got close to take some screenshots since<br/>
&gt;this was the first time I had ever seen a dragon.  I had Selos up and was<br/>
&gt;standing right in front of Gorenaire when she decided to swat me.  Before I<br/>
&gt;realized what was going on, I was back at my bind point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So did I die to a bug or will Gorenaire, once aggroed, attack anyone near<br/>
&gt;her, even if they weren&#39;t involved in the attack?  BTW I was not in wolf<br/>
&gt;form nor was I grouped with anyone at the time who had pets (which I have<br/>
&gt;been told will cause her to attack you).<br/>
