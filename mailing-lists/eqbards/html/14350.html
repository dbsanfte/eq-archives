<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655586445">Q: Are there enhanced effects for these songs when the proper instrument is<br/>
equipped? In the case of Aquatic Ayre, is the enhancement range increased?<br/>
For Sirens and Pixie Strike, does it increased duration, chance of success,<br/>
or both? <br/>
<br/>
A: Instruments only effect the primary effects of the song (healing, buff,<br/>
attack speed, etc.) - not the range/duration/chance of success, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Is it just me or does this seem like a general answer meaning &quot;all songs&quot;,<br/>
not just the ones in question.  Take Lament for example.  It is played on a<br/>
stringed instrument.  If instruments  do not effect duration/chance of<br/>
success then what is left to effect on this song?  What bonus do we get<br/>
when using a lute/mandolin?<br/>
