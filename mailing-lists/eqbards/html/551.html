That&#39;s funny!<br/>
<br/>
OK, seriously though, I guess it is TECHNICALLY an option.  But be<br/>
warned - after losing my corpse due to a game bug, I petitioned, and<br/>
a week and a day later I finally was contacted by a GM.  Actually,<br/>
that is not true - a friend of mine contacted a GM, as he is on for<br/>
at least double the amount of time that I am.<br/>
<br/>
And if you are not contacted by the GM before your corpse decays,<br/>
then it is GONE!  No they can not, or maybe will not reimburse you<br/>
for items you were carrying.  Mino axe?  gone.  Magic armour? gone.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you may be lucky and play during &#39;peak&#39; times, when the<br/>
concentration of GMs is likely to be higher.  And I guess that the<br/>
number of GMs has increased since my sad and sorry experience.<br/>
