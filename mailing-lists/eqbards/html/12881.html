&gt; Hello all!  I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, and thought I&#39;d post on a<br/>
&gt; subject that&#39;s been troubling me lately: the incompatability of enchanters and<br/>
&gt; bards.  Are there any other two classes in the game that work together as<br/>
&gt; poorly as these two?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

much care how the party gets rounded out.  Our crowd control is a poor second to the Enchanter&#39;s, and we<br/>
have to devote full time to it if it falls on us; I&#39;d much rather have the Enchanter do it.  If you&#39;re<br/>
high enough level to sing Mana Song, and the Enchanter can cast Clarity, you have mana coming out your<br/>
ears.  Nothing like more than one column of buffs before you start singing anything!  Heck, you can even<br/>
tank for a bunch of casters if it comes to that (and I&#39;ve done it a few times).  (Of course, their pets<br/>
are usually better than I am...)<br/>
