<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194507815">i play a wood elf, the biggest advantage being that you can wear small or<br/>
medium armor.  plus i like to melee, i like to play a battle bard, so i put<br/>
all of my points in to strength.  with my enhancing items i am currently at<br/>
113 strength, 102 agility, and 101 dexterity.  so the points will come with<br/>
items as you get them.  also being a wood elf, you can wear all small bronze<br/>
or steel plate, which weighs less.  as far as dexterity, i don&#39;t know if it<br/>
has to do with playing instruments, but it allows you to miss less when<br/>
meleeing (right? hehe), and yes agility allows you to get hit less.  i think<br/>
the biggest factor with playing instruments is merely your skill level with<br/>
that instrument.  the last stat you have to think of is charisma helping<br/>
your charm spell last longer, and some say your songs get resisted less.  i<br/>
believe a wood elf starts with higher charisma than a half elf.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m planning to create a bard either on Rallos Zek or preferrably the<br/>
&gt; racewar server (if I can hold out). I&#39;ve already chosen half elf as my<br/>
&gt; race and I intend to put most of my points into strength so that I can<br/>
&gt; easily carry steel plate, weapons and instruments.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, with the few remaining points I have, where do you <br/>
&gt; guys and gals<br/>
&gt; suggest I put them? Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity is <br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; for playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does <br/>
&gt; it actually<br/>
&gt; increase the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>
&gt; frequently you miss a note?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or perhaps agility would be better, as if I don&#39;t get hit, I don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; interrupted. Plus plate + agility is a nice combination.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>
&gt; steelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t want <br/>
&gt; to be in a<br/>
&gt; constant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to be <br/>
&gt; safe, but I<br/>
&gt; was thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into <br/>
&gt; dexterity and<br/>
&gt; agility).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If less strength is okay, then I might consider just doing a <br/>
&gt; wood elf, as<br/>
&gt; they tend to have higher natural agility and dexterity. <br/>
&gt; Either elf fits<br/>
&gt; well in my IC perception of my character.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your help,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
