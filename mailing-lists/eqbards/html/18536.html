Agreed.  Its the individual choice if they want to switch guilds.  No one forces them to do a /guildremove!  I was one of the orginal members of a guild on Innoruuk called &quot;Higher Arts of Arcane&quot; (sp)   I left that guild in a heart beat when it came time to group and &quot;guild members&quot; come first!  though I played with the party more than 3 weeks straight and got bumped because of guild rules!  Now, instead of bitching about the guild rules, I dropped the guild I was in and joined all my friends guild.  Immediately I got things that I have been struggling to get.  <br/>
<br/>
My point. YOU ARE DAMN RIGHT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PLAYER STEALING.  It is a choice.  Yes, My x-guildmaster had a problem. It was quickly solved after I took anonymous off and he was nearly 20 lvls below me.<br/>

  Ahhh we have gotten to another peev of mine...<br/>
<br/>
  Guilds stealing players.<br/>
<br/>
  This term makes no sense to me.  How do they steal a player?  DO they<br/>
  sneak into your guildhall in the middle of night, creep into DuckFoo&#39;s<br/>
  room, hold a nocked Ashenwood bow to his head and tell him to leave?<br/>
<br/>
  No?<br/>
<br/>
  They convince DuckFoo that joing their guild is better for him than<br/>
  staying in his old guild.  DuckFoo then decides that the gains for<br/>
  joining the new guild outweight the loyalty he holds to old guild.<br/>
<br/>
  Wheres the problem here?<br/>
<br/>
  Its with DuckFoo or with his old guild.  Either DuckFoo is leaving<br/>
  behind good friends, and trustworthy companions for the allure of more<br/>
  power.  Or, his old guild was not providing him with what he wanted from<br/>
  a guild.  In the first case I say &quot;Shame on DuckFoo, and you deserve<br/>
  whatever happens to you.&quot;  In the second, I&#39;d say its a good thing<br/>
  DuckFoo left and everyone is probably better off.  I don&#39;t see where the<br/>
  new guild has done anything wrong.<br/>
<br/>
  If you aren&#39;t getting from a guild what you want, then you should<br/>
  leave.  All the better if its to a guild which will give you what you<br/>
  want/need.<br/>
<br/>
  Personally, I want to be in a guild with people I like and I&#39;m friends<br/>
  with.  Hopefully also with a decent amount of people my level, so I can<br/>
  more esaily find groups.  Other people may want other things.<br/>
