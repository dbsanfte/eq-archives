<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255950938">I just started in Hpass Hold last night and I can definately confirm<br/>
this...It actually made me shake my head and laugh to myself when it<br/>
happened because I expected it...<br/>
<br/>
I walked up the ridge near the Gnoll spawn points and rounded the corner to<br/>
stumble across 2 high level players beating on a Soothsayer...I stopped to<br/>
watch and the thing, already down to 1/2 hit points, turned around and<br/>
started casting on me...this is totally ridiculous.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; As several people have pointed out, mobs that *other* people<br/>
&gt; are attacking, unrelated to your party, will come over and<br/>
&gt; start whacking on you.  Sometimes even when you&#39;re not<br/>
&gt; singing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Surely it can&#39;t be intended that the gnoll soothsayer the<br/>
&gt; other group is fighting turns around every 5 seconds to cast a<br/>
&gt; spell on me even though they are beating the crap out of it<br/>
&gt; and the only thing I&#39;m doing is watching and singing<br/>
&gt; Accelerando on myself.<br/>
