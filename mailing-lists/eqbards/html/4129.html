&gt;&gt; the hassle of selling it?  Go give it to a beetle<br/>
&gt;&gt; in the commons, then invis & watch he glee of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; newbie who finds it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does that actually work? You can give an item to a monster and if they get<br/>
&gt;killed, it&#39;s still on the body to recover? If so that&#39;s a completely<br/>
&gt;fantastic idea and I&#39;ll start doing that immediately with all the rusty<br/>
&gt;stuff I find and maybe the occasional tidbit. Thank you!!!! (No sarcasm<br/>
&gt;what-so-ever, this is a really great idea!) By the way, if this actually<br/>
&gt;does work - is there any kind of time limit as to how long it&#39;ll stay with<br/>
&gt;the monster?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup it works quite well, be a bit careful with weapons as humanoid types<br/>
(orcs, skeletons, etc) will wield those weapons as well.  Of course it would<br/>
be kinda funny to see a skeleton with a BIBS :)</div>
