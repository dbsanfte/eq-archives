<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039679262"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  I was talking to a friend the other day that said the<br/>
&gt;anti magical aura song (lv 40+ i think) does some AMAZING things to PC spell<br/>
&gt;casters.  I&#39;m not too sure the legitimacy of this claim, but if it&#39;s true,<br/>
&gt;that will put us over the top as pvp gods.  And of course there&#39;s other<br/>
&gt;tactics, but none so devastating as the ones previously mentioned (unless<br/>
&gt;someone can think of any, and I would be thrilled to hear of any more).<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I cant get this song to do squat. On mobs it will pulse with the animation<br/>
that looks like selo&#39;s accelerando on us, and this will irritate the<br/>
creature causing them to attack me but thats all i can tell. I tried<br/>
dualing a friend and it wouldnt even pulse on them, though it was<br/>
irritating the snakes and bats around me. For that matter, i couldnt even<br/>
get the dissonance to hurt them. Bellows hurt them, and i could wack all<br/>
day on them with my weapons, but no aoe song hit them. Didnt try fear now<br/>
that i think of it... this happened before todays patch but after the last<br/>
patch. Anybody know what was going on here? I am going to try this again<br/>
today after this patch and see what happens...</div>
