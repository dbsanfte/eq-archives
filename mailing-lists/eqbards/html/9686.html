<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-917372326">I have went through and edited the old (and very outdated) Goatanos Bard <br/>
Song Analysis. Here are the first 20 songs, please put the song level you <br/>
are commenting on in the subject line of your reply.  I now that John(tm) is <br/>
working on a more extensive rewrite, I just thought I would throw this out <br/>
to help out the new folks on the the list :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Level 1: Chant of Battle<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +DEX +STR +AC<br/>
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments<br/>
Location: Any<br/>
Upgrades: Every level<br/>
Notes: Can&#39;t be stacked with Anthem De Arms<br/>
Analysis: This is a good 1st level song and highly recommended as the <br/>
primary buff song until level 6 (healing).  This is a good buff song to <br/>
twist with Hymm of Restoration (level 6).  This song usually get&#39;s dropped <br/>
from a Bard&#39;s arsenal of songs when at 10th level for Anthem de Arms. It <br/>
regains popularity in the mid 30&#39;s as it stacks nicely with the level 36 <br/>
Vilia&#39;s Verses of Celerity.  It is also good in parties where there are many <br/>
procing weapons, as dex helps the weapon fire more often.<br/>
<br/>
Level 2: Chords of Dissonance<br/>
Effects: NON-PARTY, AE DoT<br/>
Skill Used: Stringed Instruments<br/>
Location: Any<br/>
Notes: Area effect song<br/>
Upgrades: Every level?<br/>
Analysis: This is your first Damage over Time (DoT) song.  Commonly known as <br/>
the &#39;wince&#39; song as it causes all affected beings to wince for a few points <br/>
of damage. Be very careful! This song will wince all non-PCs, including <br/>
guards, innkeepers, etc. Many bards have died quite a few times because 1) I <br/>
had this song going when I was too close to a guard or 2) I used this song <br/>
to kill a monster and forgot to turn it off when returning to the safety of <br/>
a guard to heal/rest. For fun, when you get past level 8, go walk around the <br/>
Freeport newbie area with this song on and see how many level 1 monsters you <br/>
can kill just by playing this song. As you level, this song will grow <br/>
stronger. It has a duration of 3 ticks (a tick is 6 seconds) after you stop <br/>
playing it.<br/>
It will stack with your later DoT songs allowing you to do the all <br/>
instrument attack.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Level 3: Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Regen Stamina<br/>
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments<br/>
Location: All<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Note: THIS SONG DOES NOT INCREASE MANA REGENERATION.  It has been confirmed <br/>
by Verant to be a client-side refresh issue.<br/>
Analysis: This song restores lost stamina.  This can be handy when swimming <br/>
long distances or when you or party members are dual weilding heavy waepons <br/>
in a long battle.<br/>
<br/>
Level 4: Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric<br/>
Effects: TARGET, Locate Corpse<br/>
Skill Used: Singing<br/>
Location: Any<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Analysis: This is one of the more useful songs in the game. It allows you to <br/>
find corpses anywhere in your zone. People are getting killed in odd places <br/>
all the time and don&#39;t know where to find their corpse. With this song, you <br/>
can help them. Just click on the person whose corpse you want to find and <br/>
then fire off the song.  Just remember to turn the song off if you ever need <br/>
to stop looking for the corpse (you come under attack/get to the corpse and <br/>
no longer need it) as every few seconds, no matter what you are doing, this <br/>
song will auto turn your body to face the direction of the corpse. <br/>
Necromancers (level 1) and Shadowknights are the only other classes that get <br/>
this ability.  If no player is targeted the song will point you toward the <br/>
nearest corpse (PC or NPC), this can be handy if that orc you just killed <br/>
died and fell into a tree.  Fire this song up, you will target the orc <br/>
corpse, then use /loot to loot the body.<br/>
<br/>
Level 5: Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Increase movement speed, Outdoor only<br/>
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments<br/>
Location: Any<br/>
Upgrades: Every 5 levels?<br/>
Analysis: This song will probably be one of the most used in a Bard&#39;s <br/>
arsenal. It makes you run, run fast. When played with a percussion <br/>
instrument (a skill which you also get at 5th level), you run faster than <br/>
someone with the popular Spirit of the Wolf spell. As you get higher in <br/>
level, you will gradually run faster. By the time you reach the mid 40&#39;s in <br/>
level, with your drum, you will be faster than Spirit of the Cheetah (level <br/>
47 Shaman Spell). When not in combat/healing, sometimes it&#39;s a good idea to <br/>
have this song on, in case a train jumps you, or if a griffin decides to <br/>
reach out and touch you. Keep in mind, that when playing this song with a <br/>
percussion instrument, you are faster than just about any monster in the <br/>
game. If you get attacked, just keep running and ignore them. If you are <br/>
under 25% HP or more, you will run slower, so if you have 1% hp left, do not <br/>
expect to &#39;run like the wind.&#39; There is one problem with this song. <br/>
Sometimes it works too well. When traveling in a party with this song. <br/>
Always bring up the rear, ie: be the last person in the party. People always <br/>
get left behind, due to lag, or packet loss. Run last, keep an eye on <br/>
everyone. Being last also helps out because if the person at the front of <br/>
the party gets too far ahead, he will leave the range of your song, slowing <br/>
down until you catch up again. Lastly, this song will make you swim <br/>
underwater (not on the surface of the water) at a similar speed that you <br/>
would travel on land.<br/>
<br/>
Level 6: Hymn of Restoration<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Heal<br/>
Skill Used: Stringed Instruments<br/>
Location: Any<br/>
Upgrades: Every 6 levels<br/>
Analysis: Second only to the 5th level Accelerando song, this song will make <br/>
you the life of any party that has tank characters. I have received many <br/>
thanks for this song from clerics, who don&#39;t have to cast healing as often. <br/>
In combat, keep in mind that every point that is healed by this song, will <br/>
piss off a monster as much as doing 1 point of damage to it. For example, if <br/>
you are healing 6 players, for 6 points each, the monsters you are fighting <br/>
will react as if you were doing an extra 6*6=36 points damage to each of <br/>
them every pulse. Use with caution, monsters may start to concentrate more <br/>
of their attacks on you. As you go up in levels and your singing/stringed <br/>
skill goes up, this song will slowly heal faster and for more points per <br/>
pulse.<br/>
<br/>
Level 7: Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong<br/>
Effects: SELF, +STR +AC +Attack Speed<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Any<br/>
Note: Stacks with Chant of Battle<br/>
Upgrades: Str bonus increases every other level?<br/>
Analysis: For those soloing, this is an upgrade to the Chant of Battle song <br/>
and is actually better that the 10th level Anthem De Arms. This song also <br/>
will increase attack speed by about 20%. For example, it will reduce the <br/>
delay of a longsword from 28 to 22.4. Also, while this song is stackable <br/>
with Anthem de Arms, the attack speed increases will not stack, the Str <br/>
bonus will.<br/>
<br/>
Level 8: Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament<br/>
Effects: TARGET, Lower Reaction and Help<br/>
Skill: Stringed Instruments<br/>
Location: Kelethin<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: This song causes a monster to &#39;become sad&#39;(lulled) and ignore you. <br/>
This is the first Bard Song that is not continuous. You can Lament several <br/>
monsters, one right after the other. Doing this, you can lure a monster from <br/>
a group, one at a time. This is similar to the Soothe spell that Enchanters <br/>
and other mage classes get, but is apparently stronger, and harder to <br/>
resist. When using this song try to avoid pulling past lulled mobs as they <br/>
may decide to follow. Warning: sometimes when it fails, it will tend to <br/>
attract everyone (including those that are already soothed).<br/>
<br/>
Level 9: Elemental Rhythms<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +Fire resist Cold resist Magic resist<br/>
Skill: Percussion Instruments<br/>
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every level<br/>
Note on Rhythm songs, they will generaly NOT stack with each other. Guardian <br/>
Rythms will stack with most(all?) songs in this series.<br/>
Analysis: This is the first of the protection songs. When you start to <br/>
encounter spell casting monsters, this song will be greatly appreciated. The <br/>
boast to resistances will help you either partially or fully resist the <br/>
effects of spells.  This can be lifesaver at higher levels.<br/>
<br/>
Level 10: Anthem de Arms<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +Attack Speed +STR<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Upgrades: Str bonus increases every other level?<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Note: Will not stack with Chant of Battle<br/>
Analysis: In Party combat, the +Attack speed comes in handy for the tanks. <br/>
The attack speed will increase about 10% to 15%. For example, it will reduce <br/>
the delay of a longsword from 28 to 25. This is a great song to twist with <br/>
another and should be used in almost all combat. It will not stack with the <br/>
Chant of Battle song. Also, while this song is stackable with Jonthan&#39;s <br/>
Whistling Warsong, the attack speed increases will not stack.<br/>
<br/>
Level 11: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon<br/>
Effects: SELF, Add NPC faction<br/>
Skill: Wind Instruments<br/>
Location: Kelethin<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: Click on a target, say, a merchant or NPC, and sing this song. The <br/>
song only lasts a few seconds, but it&#39;s effects will last for several <br/>
minutes. You cannot stack this song on top of itself; there is no added <br/>
benefit. If you are already viewed well by the NPC, the effect will not be <br/>
much. If you are viewed indifferent or worse, this song will increase the <br/>
/con level by 1 in most cases. There are 2 uses for this song. First: you <br/>
will get better prices from vendors that do not like you. Second: it can <br/>
increase faction with an NPC enough so that they will give you quests that <br/>
you would normally not have access to. If used on monsters, its effects are <br/>
not strong enough to keep them from attacking you. This is the first Bard <br/>
song based on Wind Instruments. It is not a good practicing song, however, <br/>
as the song only lasts a few seconds. If you want to practice your Wind <br/>
Instruments skill, wait until level 16 and use Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre.<br/>
<br/>
Level 12: Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow<br/>
Effects: TARGET, DD<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Damage Formula: INT(lvl/2) + 1<br/>
Analysis: This is single person direct damage song.  The extra damage is <br/>
good while solo&#39;ing, pulling from a distance, or hitting runners.<br/>
<br/>
Level 13: Purifying Rhythms<br/>
Effects: PARTY, +Poison rest Disease rest and Magic rest<br/>
Skill: Percussion Instruments<br/>
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every level?<br/>
Note on Rhythm songs, they will generaly NOT stack with each other. Guardian <br/>
Rythms will stack with most(all?) songs in this series.<br/>
Analysis: This song is most useful for combat with mummies, zombies, Necros, <br/>
Shamens, spiders, and snakes.  The boast to resistances will help you either <br/>
partially or fully resist the effects of disease, poison, spells.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Level 14: Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto<br/>
Effects: TARGET, Item Identify<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Erudin<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Analysis: This song will allow you or a targeted party member to indentify <br/>
an item held on their mouse pointer.  This comes in very handy now that many <br/>
quest items have the same name, but may not be the same item, ie Rune of the <br/>
One Eye has three pieces (Top, Middle, Bottom).<br/>
<br/>
Level 15: Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby<br/>
Effects: NON-PARTY, AE Enthrall, Nix hate List<br/>
Skill: Stringed Instruments<br/>
Location: Kelethin<br/>
Upgrades: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: What does &quot;Enthrall & Nix hate List&quot; mean? Well, This song will <br/>
attempt to make all monsters nod off and fall asleep. It will nix the &#39;hate <br/>
list&#39; of a monster. The &#39;hate list&#39; is an internal list a monster keeps of <br/>
everyone who has attacked it, and remembers who &#39;pissed it off&#39; the most. A <br/>
monster uses the &#39;hate list&#39; to determine who to will attack when fighting <br/>
your party. Nixing this list will erase it from the monsters memory, so that <br/>
it will no longer &#39;track you down throughout the entire dungeon&#39;. Enthrall <br/>
basically means that the monster will ignore your presence (until you start <br/>
attacking it). Sounds pretty powerful, eh? Unfortunately, when the H-list is <br/>
nixed, everyone on that list is cleared out´┐¢ when the monster stops nodding, <br/>
you, the bard, will be the only one on it. In multi-monster situations, <br/>
expect to take heavy damage from all the &#39;attention&#39;. Make sure a <br/>
healer-type is monitoring you and heal as needed. Word of warning, just like <br/>
Chords of Dissonance, this song will affect everything, including NPCs. <br/>
Please do not use this song next to a guard, or he will start attacking you. <br/>
Each monster affected has two chances to break out of the Lullaby every <br/>
pulse. The first is a standard resist, which nullifies the song outright, <br/>
and the second is the chance (which varies based on Bard CHA, instrument <br/>
used, level spread, etc) to just plain ignore the song. It does reduce the <br/>
volume of fire to the party, and the nod effect is great for making casters <br/>
flub a spell. Also, the nod effect will interfere with a monster&#39;s melee <br/>
attacks as well, allowing you to get in more hits. Just to re-iterate, <br/>
monsters really hate this song, more than just about anything else. You will <br/>
find this out, the hard way. Look on the bright side; if you need to get <br/>
that monster off the caster&#39;s back, this song is the way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Level 16: Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Water Breathing<br/>
Skill: Wind Instruments<br/>
Location: HighHold Pass<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Analysis: This is the first _ongoing_ song that uses Wind Instruments like <br/>
minotaur horns or flutes (minotaur horns are wind instruments. All other <br/>
types of horns are usually brass). This song allows your entire party to <br/>
breathe underwater. The major drawback is that the range is too small in <br/>
many cases.  If your group plans on doing a major underwater excersion this <br/>
song should NOT be your only means of water breathing.  Since this is your <br/>
first wind based song expect to have a lot of trouble starting it up till <br/>
you get your wind skill up.<br/>
<br/>
Level 17: Guardian Rythms<br/>
Effects: PARTY: +AC +Magic Resist<br/>
Skill: Percussion Instruments<br/>
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every other level?<br/>
Note on Rhythm songs, they will generaly NOT stack with each other. Guardian <br/>
Rythms will stack with most(all?) songs in this series.<br/>
Analysis: This is good for fighting Evil Eyes and other spell casting <br/>
monsters. Many Everquest references describe this song has having a &#39;spell <br/>
shield&#39; which is a confusing way of saying it pumps up magic resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Level 18: Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord<br/>
Effects: NON-PARTY, AE -AC DoT<br/>
Skill: Brass Instruments<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrades: Every level?<br/>
Analysis: This is your second AE Dot song and allows you to use your Brass <br/>
skill.  You will have a lot of trouble starting this song till you get your <br/>
Brass skill up.  You can do this at the Arena zone (off of Lake Rathe) or <br/>
some people will use the large room in the N Ro tunnel (where the Shady <br/>
Swashbuckler is) to practice this skill up.  Just park yourself there start <br/>
this song with horn equipped and let it play for a few hours (4 to 6). At <br/>
the end of that time you should have a maxed brass skill.   Now the good <br/>
part, this song allows you to do the &#39;all instrument attack&#39;.   Create a hot <br/>
key pad with your secondary weapon slot,an inventory slot, and hot key the <br/>
following songs: Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord, Chords of Dissonance, and Hymn <br/>
of Restoration.<br/>
Find your target equip your horn and have your lute on the mouse pointer.  <br/>
Start up DDD, when you get the wince message stop the song start CoD and <br/>
equip your lute (before the wince message).  When CoD winces stop it and <br/>
start Hymn. Repeat.  This will allow you to solo with little or no downtime, <br/>
can also work well in party settings.  For a few extra points of damage use <br/>
hand to hand attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Level 19: Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding<br/>
Effects: PARTY, Invisibility<br/>
Skill: Wind Instruments<br/>
Location: Erudin<br/>
Note: Not weavable<br/>
Upgrades: N/A<br/>
Analysis: Group invisibility is nice. The radius of invisibility is somewhat <br/>
small, so caution. If you are soloing, this song is extremely useful at <br/>
getting through places like HighHold Pass, or if you are a good alignment <br/>
character, helps when you are walking through Nektulus Forest. In a group <br/>
setting, this song is very useful when the party is deep in a dungeon, <br/>
medding and healing, as monsters and trains will just walk right by you as <br/>
if you were not there. This is a pulse based song. Every pulse, a skill <br/>
check is made. If you fail a skill check, you become visible until the next <br/>
tick (about 6 seconds). This is both a blessing and curse. The blessing is <br/>
that if anyone in your party does something to break out of invisibility, <br/>
like looting a corpse, or talking to a vendor, the player will turn back <br/>
invisible on the next tick, even if the character is still looting the <br/>
corpse, or still transacting with the merchant. This is a major plus over <br/>
any spell caster based invisibility. The curse is skill check failures, <br/>
which do not happen very often, but every once in a while, it will. Also, <br/>
some con red monsters seem to have a greater chance of seeing past your <br/>
song. One way to check if a monster will see past your song is to con it. If <br/>
it does not con &#39;indifferently&#39; then it will be able to see you. This song <br/>
will make you invisible to undead (some debate on this point).<br/>
<br/>
Level 20: Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>
Effects: NON-PARTY, AE -Attack SPD AC<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Location: Freeport, Qeynos<br/>
Upgrade: Unknown<br/>
Analysis: Song effects are obvious, reducing attack speed and AC of monsters <br/>
and NPCs. The attack speed of the monster will visibly slow down under the <br/>
effects of this song.<br/>
<br/>
