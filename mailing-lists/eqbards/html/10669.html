<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822665805">Monks way outdmg Warriors, there is no competition.<br/>
<br/>
   Monks dual/double is high enough were they get a good<br/>
   chance each round to hit four times.  Warriors are<br/>
   sometimes lucky to even hit three.  I&#39;ve seen a monk<br/>
   do 30 - 50 points per fist, and a 90 point kick.  A<br/>
   monk can solo the permafrost throne room, a warrior <br/>
   would have to flee.  You completely underestimate the<br/>
   power of monks (yes, at lower levels its not that obvious).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items, why<br/>
&gt; is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th level?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>   You are absolutely right, there is a huge gap in weapons.  Then<br/>
   again you&#39;ve been spoiled by a mature server.  No one would dream<br/>
   of trying to kill Mucktail to get the PGT at level 12, let&#39;s be<br/>
   realistic.  Bonecracker and his necro horde kicked my ass in a full<br/>
   group at level 20.  One handed silvery axe and Dirk is what I used<br/>
   from level 30 to level 42.  Your best bet if you want something <br/>
   better is to beg a higher level group in permafrost to just give<br/>
   you a crystalline blade or silvery axe.  I have handed out two<br/>
   crystalline blades and three silvery axes to young bards who were<br/>
   just there for the greaves (since I couldn&#39;t hold another lore).<br/>
<br/>
   We do need more weapons that are midrange and even highrange.<br/>
   Keeping that dirk (15pp from a friend) from level 19 to level<br/>
   42 just plain hurts.  And a BLW from 19 to 30, then I got a <br/>
   SWA, and then a few levels later a Crystalline Blade.  After <br/>
   level 20, our weapons aren&#39;t very useful in the long run.  I<br/>
   have two Yks now, and yeah they proc alot, and yeah they do<br/>
   nice dmg, but that ranger beside me is kicking my butt in dmg<br/>
   ratios, and the monk is absolutely blowing me away.<br/>
<br/>
   Harmonic.</div>
