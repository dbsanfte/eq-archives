&gt; &gt;The real problem Verant is trying to solve is kiting.  They think its a<br/>
&gt; &gt;problem, so for the sake of argument lets assume it is for a moment.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt;major effect of kiting is that it allows you to combat monsters you<br/>
normally<br/>
&gt; &gt;could not, with little risk.  The main objective is to put that risk<br/>
factor<br/>
&gt; &gt;back in, not to make it impossible.  This could be accomplished very<br/>
easily.<br/>
&gt; &gt;If they set DOT&#39;s to only do damage when a monster is within a certain<br/>
&gt; &gt;range, kiting would still be possible, but more risky.  If they make the<br/>
&gt; &gt;effective range twice the range of the melee attack of the critter, I<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; &gt;think they would achieve their goal.  Sure you could run around with a<br/>
&gt; &gt;critter on you and kite, but one misstep, one hit tree, one bit of lag<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt;the critter will get a swing, proabably a bash, and if he stuns you?<br/>
Well<br/>
&gt; &gt;we all know the result of getting stunned by a deep red, death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that some people are still so &quot;practiced&quot; at it, that they would<br/>
&gt; never take hits.  I agree with the idea of solving it - but what I think<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; that they should instead change it to make DoTs more easily resisted by<br/>
&gt; deep reds.  In fact, DoTs should be pretty much impossible to affect a<br/>
deep<br/>
&gt; red, really hard for red, and kinda tough for yellow.  (Sorta like Melee<br/>
&gt; weapons are, y&#39;know?)<br/>

&gt; My Opinion, your milage may vary.<br/>

Ok, we&#39;re wandering again (and I&#39;ve been one of the worst offenders).  I&#39;ve<br/>
alway pointed out to people that bard kiting requires the mob to be in<br/>
bellow<br/>
range, and that is short enough to  A.  Keep it from dumping on somebody,<br/>
and B.  be a decent bit of risk.  Still tedious as anything though :)<br/>
<br/>
I just dumped EQ_shamans because the whining over there was irking<br/>
me so much that my aggravation spilled over here.  My fault, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
On bard related issues, if they did the same thing you suggest to our damage<br/>
songs, how much use would they be in a group? </span></blockquote></div>
