Qeynos in Fireprides, next to the bank, but it&#39;s horribly<br/>
overpriced there (like twice the normal cost).  It may be a<br/>
wood elf thing as the merchant there originally wouldn&#39;t talk<br/>
to me.  I get the standard minimum price (787.25pp for a<br/>
breastplate) in East Freeport.<br/>
