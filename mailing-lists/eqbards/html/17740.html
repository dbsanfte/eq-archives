point but did drop him into lava,) once from najeena <br/>
and once from sol a... He got a res and we continued<br/>
on our merry way.  Both times he was taking damage<br/>
when he entered the zone point.  We thoerorized that<br/>
was the cause, based on those experiences and talking<br/>
to our other friends.<br/>
