<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582605945">You guys are having a violent agreement!<br/>
<br/>
The point of diminishing returns seems to be just over 100 in agi and prolly<br/>
dex. Yes - boost it up to 100, 110, 120 but beyond that - it make little<br/>
diff. <br/>
<br/>
Now consider the magic buffs - I see my dex into 130 plus buffed with song<br/>
and should I wonder if it need my jewelry dexi boosters?  Or should I wonder<br/>
if I need my dexi buff song?  And can use other sings since my stats are<br/>
good from my jewels.  But then what about the warrior in the party who<br/>
dumped all his points into wis and int and has 80 dex unbuffed - hehe guess<br/>
he needs my songs!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>		This is almost correct. Agility DOES affect your AC. I don&#39;t<br/>
have the<br/>
		numbers written down but I do know that my AC is affected by<br/>
how much<br/>
		+agility I have (just like my HP are affected by how much<br/>
+stamina I have).<br/>
		However, once your agility reaches 100, it takes a larger<br/>
amount of agility<br/>
		boosting items/buffs to see that AC increase.  If you doubt<br/>
this at all,<br/>
		take off all your +agility items and look at your AC then<br/>
put them on and<br/>
		compare again. For those of you with a base agility that is<br/>
lower than 100<br/>
		you should see your AC increase.<br/>
<br/>
		One example I can give and maybe some of you can test this<br/>
with someone you<br/>
		trust, but the dwarven cleric I run around with gets better<br/>
AC from his BS<br/>
		tunic than a bronze breastplate because of the agility<br/>
boost. Because my<br/>
		agility hangs around the 110 mark, my AC went down from<br/>
Steel/Bronze when I<br/>
		tried his tunic on. Had I removed all my other +agility<br/>
items and tried<br/>
		again, the story might have been different. I&#39;ll try this<br/>
tonight if I can<br/>
		remember and let you all know what I find.<br/>
