those poor sand giants;)<br/>
Come to think of it, were you not at one time going to take me sand giant<br/>
hunting, just for fun?<br/>

the one day i went to try for a Kilij (was bored and the quest was just<br/>
patched in, i did not need one) i walked into South Ro and the first giant i<br/>
killed had the plans.  i brought a level 40 bard along with me, and let him<br/>
have it since it would be an improvement on his weapons.  i stayed (was<br/>
bored remember hehe) and killed a half dozen or so more giants and got<br/>
nothing.  actually i did this the next day (bored again) and killed another<br/>
half dozen or so and nothing.  got really lucky that first time.<br/>
