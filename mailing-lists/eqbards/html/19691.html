<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130932121">Interesting. AT 12, I was grouped with a rogue. I would pull (I had Selo&#39;s.)<br/>
And we would then get on opposite sides of the critter, so that the<br/>
rogue could backstab at least some of the time. And &quot;ping pong&quot; the critter<br/>
back and forth. IF either of us were going down too fast in health,<br/>
I&#39;d toss my heal song into the mix. Otherwise, I didn&#39;t play it because<br/>
there were many other things to play and its a big taunt.<br/>
<br/>
Every once in a while, we ended up running when too many things joined in<br/>
(we were fighting in South RO)<br/>

&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve had good success grouping with rogues with my bard, my druid, my<br/>
&gt;&gt; wizard, and my shaman.  Any class that can &#39;get the<br/>
&gt;&gt; attention&#39; of another<br/>
&gt;&gt; mob will find rogues quite valuable.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&lt;cringe!&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s what happens when someone takes pity on me and invites me to group:<br/>
&gt;1) They attack mob 2) I get within agro radius and put my hand near<br/>
&gt;auto-attack key 3) mob turns on me and knocks me down to 80% heath 4) I<br/>
&gt;scream &quot;Get it off&quot; 5) mob gets me down to 40% health and refuses to turn<br/>
&gt;around  6) Groupmate hits mob with everything they&#39;ve got (or attempts to<br/>
&gt;heal me) 7) LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Perhaps when I hit higher levels some class somewhere will be able to taunt<br/>
&gt;a mob off me.<br/>
