<div id="ygrps-yiv-755239552">In the words of Conan Doyle, &quot;The Plot Thickens&quot;...  For those of you who<br/>
are unaware, DIKU Mud - was a popular MUD.  I&#39;m guessing that the code is<br/>
available in the Public Domain...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall Brad specifically saying that Hell Levels was unintentional<br/>
(I sure will take others word for it) - but I do recall him saying they were<br/>
common in MUDs.<br/>
<br/>
It sure is beginning to appear that Verant &quot;borrowed&quot; (Diku?) MUD code and<br/>
it&#39;s in place in EQ.  Whether intentional or not - Verant has made it clear<br/>
it&#39;s hear to stay...<br/>

&gt; I see what you&#39;re saying now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still have to disagree though. Verant has stated, and recent<br/>
investigation<br/>
&gt; seems to bear out their claims, that hell levels were not intended but are<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; side effect of the exp formula. That being the case I find it highly<br/>
&gt; unlikely that they have any code that says &quot;Hell level + 1&quot;<br/>
