<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419403407">Careful not to confuse a monster swarm with area effect bugs.  I use DDD<br/>
all the time, even in indoor zones.  (Though I have had trouble in<br/>
Runnyeye).  Been using it in perma with no problems.  The thing you<br/>
describe below I&#39;ve had happen to non-bard characters as well.  It&#39;s like<br/>
you&#39;ve killed too many of that type of monster, and they all decide to open<br/>
a can of whoop-ass on you.  Had that happen to me most recently in<br/>
steamfont while fighting earth elems.  All of a sudden, I see a whole swarm<br/>
of them moving toward me (slowly, in that menacing earth elem way), wasn&#39;t<br/>
sure what was going on until too late.  :)<br/>

&gt;I assume you intended to say &quot;reels in pain&quot;, which off the top of my head I<br/>
&gt;think is the message you get when you bellow.  DDD and CoD gives you the<br/>
&gt;&quot;wince&quot; message.  You mentioned you were in Highkeep fighting the pickclaws.<br/>
&gt;Probably don&#39;t need to tell you this, but singing DDD or CoD in the basement<br/>
&gt;will sometimes, due to the z-axis bug, affect get the guards who are on the<br/>
&gt;floor above you.  Learned that the hard way last time I was there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The more I think about the z-axis bug, the more I realize that it really<br/>
&gt;puts a hamper on our effectiveness.  I almost never have DDD or CoD<br/>
&gt;memorized unless I&#39;m in a wide open area in outdoor zone.  Don&#39;t assume just<br/>
&gt;because you are outdoors the z-axis bug won&#39;t bite you.  One time I was in<br/>
&gt;the Beholder Maze fighting evil eyes and minos.  My group was camping along<br/>
&gt;the wall in the gorge where the Lord evil eyes appear.  I sang DDD in every<br/>
&gt;fight.  We were having a great time when all of a sudden just about every<br/>
&gt;muddite and mino in the entire zone came rushing into the gorge. Everyone of<br/>
&gt;them starting attacking me so I can only assume that one of them got<br/>
&gt;affected by DDD through the mountain walls and started up a train.  If<br/>
&gt;Verant can&#39;t/won&#39;t fix the z-axis bug, I would likely welcome a nerf<br/>
&gt;reducing the radius of DDD and CoD so we could use it more often.  <br/>
