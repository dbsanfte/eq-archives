I&#39;ve seen people asking as much as 6k.<br/>
<br/>
But, of all the class armors from Kunark, Singing Steel seems to be by far<br/>
the most common. (Or maybe it&#39;s that there are so few bards) I say choose<br/>
the price you want to pay and hold out for it. People on my server are<br/>
having an impossible time selling the boots. One ranger had a pair for 3<br/>
weeks and he was only asking 2k. I&#39;m sure I could have haggled him down, but<br/>
the pair I bought fell in my lap.<br/>
<br/>
As for their use...<br/>
<br/>
From what I hear, you must be 45 to activate the effect. Then the process is<br/>
simple:<br/>
<br/>
A) stop singing<br/>
B) right click on boots<br/>
C) resume singing<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll confirm the level cap as soon as I turn 45.<br/>

Just recently bought a pair of singing steel boots myself and I paid a<br/>
nice round 2k for them.  I still feel it&#39;s a lot of money for a pair<br/>
of shoes, but it finally breaks up that damn blue I&#39;ve been getting<br/>
bored with ;-) <br/>
<br/>
My question is how do I get the things to give me some water,<br/>
right-click doesn&#39;t seem to work??  Not sure I want to drink something<br/>
that&#39;s been so close to my feet when I&#39;m wandering through swamps, but<br/>
it&#39;s the thought that counts!<br/>
