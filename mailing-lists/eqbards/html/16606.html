<div id="ygrps-yiv-139194732">Perhaps I have very little grasp of the song situation since my bard is<br/>
only around 20 (due to paying 6 different characters to the same levels) but<br/>
perhaps more songs could be more...ummm....bardlike.  There are bards<br/>
thoughout history that have built into our collective minds the power and<br/>
character of the bard. I would think it would be nice to have some of THOSE<br/>
abilites.<br/>
<br/>
 1. I like the Pied Piper idea. And it IS practical in a way. Imagine<br/>
pulling a small mob away to an area suitable for mesmerization and general<br/>
extermination. Or pulling a group off a poor, poor caster beleagered by<br/>
creatures the tank could slap into submission (if they could get to them).<br/>
Combined with a memory wipe, that song alone would have none bards crying<br/>
about the bards power being to high.<br/>
<br/>
 2. Everyone seems to be debating on the merits of invisibility to undead,<br/>
whether we have it or not, do we want it or not, etc. Perhaps a song or two<br/>
that deal strictly with undead would not be uncalled for. Imagine a song of<br/>
Life that lowers the aggro range of undead to zero or allows them to realize<br/>
they are dead and, in their despair over their pathetic existence, set them<br/>
to attacking each other instead of living players. Wouldn&#39;t that be a sight?<br/>
It could even require a special type of strings (my, my, could all those<br/>
various packs of strings and instrument bodies scattered thought the game<br/>
become USEFUL?).  Silver strings for instruments that affect the undead.<br/>
Several bards utilized silver strings for just that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
 3.  Songs of Youth could do nothing but make the creatures forget how old<br/>
they are. Useful? Ummm, perhaps not. Then again, if they forget all they&#39;ve<br/>
learned for the last five levels, that could turn a level 50 into a level 45<br/>
or a level 65 into a level 60, thus making it easier to remove from the<br/>
party&#39;s path.<br/>
<br/>
 4.  Songs of the Season.  Spring could regenerate, heal, remove the effects<br/>
of spells for a growing.  Summer could reduce all cold based damage and<br/>
ability to cast cold to minimal use.  Fall,  the slowdown of creatures with<br/>
the snare of leaves, the interuption of casters by wandering thoughts.<br/>
Winter, The opposite of Summer.<br/>
<br/>
 5.  The Song of  the Path.  If cast soon enough and with enough time, leads<br/>
the soul back to the body much like the clerics reserect does. The main<br/>
difference would be the amount of time it would take (perhaps a minute of<br/>
real time) and how soon it needs to be cast. Perhaps it would need to be<br/>
sung within 10 minutes, before the spirit gets to far away.  That would make<br/>
an interesting delinma. Do they reserect a fallen player and quit party<br/>
support or let them go until a cleric can spare the mana? This would not be<br/>
a general replacement for the cleric spell, only a limited copy.<br/>
<br/>
 6.  Song of Material.  A song whose only purpose is to make things more<br/>
like what they are. (What?) Shields are more shieldlike, swords are more<br/>
swordlike, armor...well, I&#39;m sure you get the drift. It could add an<br/>
additional 3 or 4 points to all item stats. A weapon goes from damage 12 to<br/>
damage 15. A breastplate goes from 22 to 25.  It would make items that proc<br/>
want to proc more often.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Of course, these are just off the top of my head. I&#39;m sure similar songs<br/>
have been discussed before and tossed away. With all the discussion, I&#39;m<br/>
assuming the main songs bards seem to want are binding and invis to undead.<br/>
Perhaps when I am higher, they will be the only songs I will feel we are<br/>
missing.</div>
