<div id="ygrps-yiv-478957670">Hmmm...I remember going to LOIO way back when it would peak at about half of<br/>
what it does now, and I can&#39;t stand it anymore.  There are times when I&#39;ve<br/>
gone out to pull, and literally came back empty handed.  This is at a<br/>
population of around 120 or higher...which it seems to reach quite often,<br/>
anymore.  :/<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually - I&#39;ll tell you why some zones are crowded and others aren&#39;t - it <br/>
doesn&#39;t always have to do with population like that.  The Swamp is not a <br/>
popular place because it&#39;s difficult to hunt in without ShowEQ or <br/>
tracking.  You simply can&#39;t see far enough to find something to hunt, and <br/>
since it&#39;s such a wide range of creatures, higher level mobs can be right <br/>
on top of you before you even see them.  The tendency for mobs to hit the <br/>
water is also a problem for following and killing them - we&#39;ve all seen the <br/>
water warp in effect.<br/>
<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen, on the other hand, is a nice, open, clear space that <br/>
people can hunt in, with a good range of monsters, few surprises, and even <br/>
at peak population doesn&#39;t feel over-full.  Ditto for most of the zones you <br/>
described.  Smaller, enclosed zones where mobs can hit you through the wall <br/>
are not as popular - and are only populated because of the phat lewtz they <br/>
have...<br/>
