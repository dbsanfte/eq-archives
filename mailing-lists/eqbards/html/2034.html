<div id="ygrps-yiv-58275351">Greetings Calliope!<br/>
<br/>
I am Sylly and am on my 8th level. I have been running back and forth<br/>
between Freeport and Qeynos - where I was born for various adventures.  My<br/>
next jaunt must be to Kelethin for my next song purchase.<br/>
<br/>
I think bards are great char&#39;s and can do many things at low levels that<br/>
other char&#39;s can&#39;t - thanks to Selo&#39;s for that &lt;g&gt;  If you don&#39;t have a drum<br/>
- get one soon it really helps you run fast and travelling is fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, helping people find their corpse is fun too. And I don&#39;t mean just the<br/>
easy ones - my first one was a mid-teen level ranger who got et out in the<br/>
plains of Everfrost!  Now that was scary - having to find a corpse in a zone<br/>
I&#39;d never been too!<br/>
<br/>
What server are you on? I am on Innoruuk.  I&#39;ll be happy to share adventures<br/>
and advice with you!<br/>

		I am enjoying the sage and experienced words of our higher<br/>
level brothers and <br/>
		sisters.  But where are the young ones such as myself?  The<br/>
tales and <br/>
		adventures I read here are things I won&#39;t be seeing for some<br/>
time to come.  <br/>
		Are there any others in the 5th to 10th season with advice<br/>
and knowledge to <br/>
		share as well?  Let&#39;s speak up and help each other with<br/>
similar questions.  I <br/>
		have questions as well which I will post later (time for<br/>
work!).<br/>
