<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088613804">My 59 Bard has 127 on him, which earns me quite a bit of derision from the newbies.  On the other hand,<br/>
the newbies didn&#39;t play for two nights before they figured out that the the reason everyone else was so<br/>
much faster was the &quot;run&quot; button.  Nor did they wander into Nek forest thinking how cool it was that there<br/>
were Guards to protect them, only to spend the next 3 hours retrieving corpses.  Nor did they spend hours<br/>
of time on boats importing derv rings to GFay (1pp apiece).  Nor were they ecstatic to buy their first<br/>
piece of Banded at level 18 (15pp for a bracer, thanks price fixing).  Nor did they train Smithing to 125<br/>
before cntl-click (you had to move the slider down to pick one thing off a stack).  And the list goes on.<br/>
I did rather lazily level my Warrior to 38 in 12 days, with no help but twinked equipment, and my Druid to<br/>
24 in 3.5 days, ditto, so a lot of it is equipment, knowledge, and better hunting areas.<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t remember Halana&#39;s offhand but its over 200 as well.  Tani is 23 and<br/>
&gt; 12 of those were getting from level 1 to 12.  Non powerleveled/twinked<br/>
&gt; characters that are around 2 years old all have played times that long I<br/>
&gt; think.  I mean just think of all the time we&#39;ve wasted at camps, gaining exp<br/>
&gt; back and running back to corpses before resses were so readily available.<br/>
&gt; Think of all the time its taken us to do Epics, or get our Pre-Kunark<br/>
&gt; armor... and all that time we just sat around chatting (well worth it too!)<br/>
