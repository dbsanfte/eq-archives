<br/>
The old formula for determing the lowest level to get xp was:<br/>
<br/>
Lowest Level to Get XP = Highest Level in Group - (Highest Level in Group/3)<br/>
<br/>
Has this changed?  If so then the question is null for the time being.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well first off you didn&#39;t say what level your own character was.  He has to<br/>
be high enough level to get EXP when grouped with a level 53.  Off the top<br/>
of my head, I don&#39;t know what the minimum level required to get EXP when<br/>
grouped with a level 53 is.  I would guess you have to be at least in your<br/>
40s.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you are high enough level, your % split of EXP would be X/X+53.<br/>
This is the base EXP amount you receive.  The group bonus, class bonus, and<br/>
zone bonus get added to the base value to determine total EXP received per<br/>
kill.<br/>
<br/>
Under the new system, lower level characters get a higher % split of EXP<br/>
when grouping with higher level character than they did under the old<br/>
system.  I have actually been in a group that did not want to add someone<br/>
lower level because the person would steal EXP from them.  This person was<br/>
probably one of those that didn&#39;t want to group with hybrids prior to the<br/>
new system for the same stupid reason.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Question on &quot;Drafting&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greeting everyone I have a question on a technique called &quot;Drafting&quot;.  My<br/>
regular group of friends I group with don&#39;t want me to fall to far behind on<br/>
xp<br/>
while I am out for my son&#39;s impending birth (my wife would kill me if I<br/>
attempt<br/>
to play for the first month).<br/>
<br/>
I was told that with the new xp changes that you can group with a higher<br/>
level<br/>
player in my case a 53 shaman whose toons I group with would take my bard<br/>
and<br/>
group. He would then procedd to solo mobs and let me get the xp.<br/>
<br/>
The figures I saw (in an email) says the lower level character could &quot;draft&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
ride the xp off of the higher level shaman.  They are estimating the lower<br/>
level<br/>
would get about 40% of the xp from such a scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions on powerleviling and recent discussion on mediocre players aside (I<br/>
have played EQ since it came out and have several characters in the 20&#39;s and<br/>
30&#39;s) would this form of powerleveling be an option? Or is the math wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>
<br/>
