<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200558582">Had an interesting instrument experience in Guk this week.  I went over to<br/>
see about getting a Mask of Deception, only to find two 10th level<br/>
characters ahead of me waiting.  I headed up to the spider room to fool<br/>
around and maybe kill the Giant Heart Spider.  I was barely able to solo the<br/>
Giant Heart Spider with weapons, then died to the two others in the room.<br/>
With instruments however, I was able to take on all three, kill them all and<br/>
survive with a bubble of hp&#39;s left.  Having Hymn at full power is critical<br/>
when facing poisoning mobs.  I was very surprised to be able to do it, but<br/>
figured while I was there I better experiment.<br/>
