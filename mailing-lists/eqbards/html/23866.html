<b>Subject:</b> &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing Manasong!&quot; <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434339866">Well, it finally happened to me.  I haven&#39;t played in a lot of pickup<br/>
groups, but have done a bit.  And until now, I&#39;ve not heard this phrase<br/>
uttered.  I thought I had escaped it.  But noooooooooo... the pickup group I<br/>
got last night was the WORST I&#39;ve had in EQ that I can remember.<br/>
<br/>
Players: Bardette, Monk, Ranger, Paladin, Shaman, Wizard (all between 43 and<br/>
45)<br/>
Scene: Solb<br/>
<br/>
The wizard &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be playing manasong?&quot;... me... &quot;uh, I am&quot;...<br/>
her...&quot;well just play it all the time&quot;.... me ... &quot;nope&quot;... her... &quot;well you<br/>
aren&#39;t a very good bard are you?&quot;... me... &quot;nope&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The paladin &quot;Tani, you need to play regen now&quot;... me ... &quot;well this song<br/>
does both so just sit tight&quot;... her...&quot;well i want to regen first then get<br/>
mana&quot; ... me.. &quot;that&#39;s nice&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Ok so I was a little sarcastic, but I wont even get into the pulling<br/>
techniques used by the ranger... Needless to say, I took the advice of<br/>
someone here and with a &quot;OMG I think my roommate just dropped something bad<br/>
.. heard a crash have to go check it out&quot;.. I logged... but wowowowow...<br/>
what an experience.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a nice weekend and a little laugh from my story :)</div>
