<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281374884">Can I request a kabong of the fear topic? (I gotta learn to keep my mouth<br/>
shut)<br/>
A few questions.<br/>
<br/>
I am about to break out of 40 (like 3/4 bub left, it should fall tonight no<br/>
problem)<br/>
<br/>
Which means I will learn Max&#39;s Beserker Cresendo soon.  When i am the haster<br/>
(IE no enchanter in group) I use Celerity now (which i LOVE, the agi buff<br/>
gives a nice ac boost).  Do the experienced (I aask since its high level<br/>
song) bards think Besrker is better?  (it gives str boost I think the haste<br/>
effect is the same)<br/>
(This is excluding the obvious benefit of guildmates saying &quot;Olaf, do<br/>
Beserker.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Loot:  I need to upgrade my belt, back and shoulders.  What do you all<br/>
reccomend out there?  I like maxing my AC, Resists, CHA, and STR (in that<br/>
order).  Right now I have a Kunzar Mantle (idiot me looted it not knowing it<br/>
was no drop) (ac7, wis,dex,agi +3), a splinted bronze cloak (UGH!) and a<br/>
straw spun belt (ac 10, but weighs 6...).  I have about 2k right now and<br/>
dont really have trouble making money, though I would rather go get a guild<br/>
run to get new items...  Any suggestions?<br/>
