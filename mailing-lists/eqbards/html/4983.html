&gt; I for one don&#39;t see the realism of having to manually make these changes.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re annoying at best having to click around so much, and at worst<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re dangerous because you lose weapons/instruments/etc if you mis-click.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s also something that&#39;s not useful for only a Bard. This is something<br/>
&gt; that EVERY class in EQ could make use of. (Except perhaps the Monks since<br/>
&gt; they have no weapons to swap around)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, and maybe I&#39;m alone here, I think that making switching weapons during<br/>
combat any easier would remove an important element of the game.  Baldur&#39;s Gate,<br/>
for instance, was pausable until you went to the inventory screen to switch<br/>
weapons.  THEN action commenced to simulate the difficulty of switching weapons<br/>
in the middle of combat.<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, realistic &#39;difficulties&#39; are important for suspension of<br/>
disbeleif... of course, the debate on where simulating reality becomes too<br/>
tedious for a &#39;game&#39; is for another place and time... but I for one prefer<br/>
having switching weapons modestly difficult (and its not THAT difficult,<br/>
really)...<br/>
<br/>
And I know when you drop that thulien claw, this is the last thing your<br/>
thinking... but when you misclick slightly and that wonderful weapon goes<br/>
tumbling out of your inventory despite all your cries of &#39;nooooo&#39;... THAT, my<br/>
friends, is simulating fumbling.</div>
