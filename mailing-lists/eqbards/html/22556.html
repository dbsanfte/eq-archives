<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Pause Problem <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821131969">I had a godawful time of it last night.  I had already loaded dx7a a few months ago, plus loaded new video<br/>
and sound drivers, so I thought I would be OK.  But after installing the patch last night, I couldn&#39;t run<br/>
EQ at all since it couldn&#39;t detect my 3D card.  So I loaded new video driver.  Then I was getting all of<br/>
the following:  1)  5 minutes to zone, 2) one minute to regain control of my character after zoning, 3)<br/>
3-10 second pauses roughly 3 times a minute while attempting to play, 4) constant disk access.  I loaded<br/>
new sound drivers, that didn&#39;t help.  What made it tolerable (although I still get pauses) was to run<br/>
DXDIAG and set the sound acceleration slider off.  (I don&#39;t play with sound anyway, so I don&#39;t much<br/>
care).  This improved the zoning, and gives me 3 or so 1-3 second pauses each minute, which still stinks,<br/>
but at least it&#39;s playable.<br/>
<br/>
So turn down (or turn off) sound acceleration.  Especially if you have an SB sound card, they seem to be<br/>
the big culprit.  Then hope they fix this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m running on a rather minimal system, and I think I need to break down and buy some more memory, also (I<br/>
only have 64).  Is anyone running problem-free with that little?<br/>

&gt; Post-patch I get 1.5 second pauses every 5-10 seconds or so.  If I kill of<br/>
&gt; EVERY background program (except my firewall - can&#39;t live without that) - it<br/>
&gt; helps - so that the pauses are 1 second ever 15-20 - but it&#39;s still there...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a high end system (Athlon 800, Geforce2 GTS) - so it&#39;s clearly not a<br/>
&gt; performance issue.  Also - turning off sound, and setting display options to<br/>
&gt; the minimum make no difference whatsoever...<br/>
