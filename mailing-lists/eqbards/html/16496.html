<div id="ygrps-yiv-537370935">Actually, that&#39;s not true.  Hags were white to me, and /conned indifferent,<br/>
and didn&#39;t attack.  Same with werebats, skeletal monks, etc.  It&#39;s just that<br/>
some (barbed bones, a skeleton) see through, no matter the difference.  I<br/>
still don&#39;t know why level 5 a skeletons attack me anymore.<br/>

&gt; Everyone that I have ever seen purport that Clouding works vs. undead<br/>
&gt; seems to have 1 major misconception:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All the undead in unrest except Barbed bones (and higher) are under level<br/>
&gt; 20, which means they have green coward code affecting them.  You could, at<br/>
&gt; level 30, walk around in unrest pretty much unperturbed by ANY of the<br/>
&gt; undead simply because they won&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re so far above<br/>
&gt; them in level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just because an undead critter doesn&#39;t attack doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; invisible to them.  Try using clouding then CONNING the undead.  They<br/>
&gt; still con as &#39;ready to attack&#39;.  Which means they can see you.  They just<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t agg because you are higher level than them.<br/>
