&gt;Speaking of all the new velious armors I am kind of confused maybe someone<br/>
&gt;can shed some light on this....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is it not true that all the velious armor has basically the same stats but<br/>
&gt;are arrived at through different avenues depending on what factions you <br/>
&gt;want<br/>
&gt;to destroy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i.e. Melodic = Resonant = Troubador ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-Faras<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Resonant and Melodic are almost identical. It&#39;s just easier to go to PoG and <br/>
farm Resonant than it is to quest for Melodic in Thurgadin.<br/>
<br/>
Highsun armor from Skyshrine was superior to the above in every way <br/>
(example: BP has 50 AC). It had a yellow guardian armor look. A couple <br/>
patches ago it was changed to Twilight armor with a dark gray guardian armor <br/>
look. Stats are same as before, they just changed the name and color.<br/>
<br/>
Troubador armor from Kael is the highest AC armor for bards (BP has 54 AC). <br/>
It had a teal guardian armor look. A couple of patches ago the tint on the <br/>
armor was changed to burgundy, but the name and stats are the same to my <br/>
knowledge.<br/>
