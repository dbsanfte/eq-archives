<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492850111">I think we&#39;d just like to get some attention focused on this now.  If no one<br/>
complains you can be sure Verant will say, &quot;Hey there weren&#39;t any new bard<br/>
songs out there for weeks and everyone knew this, why didn&#39;t you speak up<br/>
then?&quot;<br/>

I agree and understand.  But GZ flat out stated that the information in<br/>
SPDAT.EFF was on test for _testing_ and even made the &#39;joke spells&#39; at the<br/>
end to prove his point.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree it&#39;s likely that our songs will be an afterthought.  Then<br/>
again, they always have been.  The Bard class was the single most nerfed<br/>
class in the game during Beta.  And even, to some extent, during final<br/>
(every DOT nerf affected us, the levitate nerf affected us, etc etc.  Our<br/>
charm song even got nerfed because of the nerf to charm spells (with no fix<br/>
in sight).<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll continue to be ignored.  However, that being<br/>
said, I still think it&#39;s a bit premature to start crying wolf, before it&#39;s<br/>
even out of the womb, let alone in our pasture or yard.  I understand that<br/>
people are unhappy about what&#39;s in the SPDAT.EFF file, however, I think it&#39;s<br/>
premature to start complaining about something that is changing on a weekly<br/>
basis.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And, in response to you, I&#39;ve been playing EQ since Beta 2.  I&#39;ve played a<br/>
Bard since Beta 2 (as well as every other class in the game to level 25+).<br/>
I care very much about the game and love my bard too.  However, the<br/>
difference is, I refuse to complain about something that doesn&#39;t even exist<br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
On top of that I&#39;ve been on Test since day 1 of final and seen some pretty<br/>
wacky stuff that made it to TEST but never went live.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Stop worrying.  SPDAT.EFF is a farcical file at best.  As a matter of<br/>
fact<br/>
&gt; &gt; GZ posted a bunch of false data in it _on purpose_ because they don&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; &gt; people knowing what&#39;s going in for Kunark.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The stuff going in for test is for testing.  I seriously doubt half of<br/>
&gt; &gt; what&#39;s listed goes into final.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   95% of what is listed in that file is live and in the game.  To suggest<br/>
&gt;   that half of it won&#39;t make it to final is pure speculation on your part.<br/>
&gt;   And that&#39;s what this all boils down to.  Everyone&#39;s best guess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If those spells made it into the file this far, chances are they are<br/>
&gt;   going into the game.  Allbeit, their values/stats/effects may be tweaked<br/>
&gt;   you can count on those spells going live.  Such is my experience since<br/>
&gt;   early beta.  (And I don&#39;t mean the bogus InstantKill spell at the end<br/>
&gt;   of the file)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Besides.  I hate that people are even trying to figure this out already.<br/>
&gt; &gt; All you guys are doing is getting really worked up over something that<br/>
may<br/>
&gt; &gt; or may not happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   And I hate people who think they know Verant&#39;s every move, tell others<br/>
&gt;   to chill out, that&#39;s it&#39;s just a game, and then proceed to compose an<br/>
&gt;   irritated mail about why they don&#39;t really care.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The people on this list genuinely care about their bards and the fact<br/>
&gt;   that no songs are even in the file for testing worries everyone on this<br/>
&gt;   list.  Songs were missing in beta, and never made it in.  I believe the<br/>
&gt;   same thing will transpire here.  The songs that I imagine being added<br/>
&gt;   will come one or two weeks before they ship the final for release, and<br/>
&gt;   those songs will be vague and poorly tested.  That comment is based on<br/>
&gt;   my 1.5 years of experience with Brad&#39;s team.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;d love to have the undying support and optimism some people here<br/>
&gt;   try to enlighten us with, but the fact is if you let me down once,<br/>
&gt;   you let me down twice, you&#39;ll probably let me down three, four, or<br/>
&gt;   more times.  That is the Verant way.  They created a great game,<br/>
&gt;   however they are poorly supporting and adding to their creation.<br/>
&gt;   Until something wonderful happens, I will still remain doubtful.<br/>
