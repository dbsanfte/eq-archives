<b>Subject:</b> Bards and Invisibility (and other spells) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-286258771">From discussions on other lists, and my own experiences, I have discovered<br/>
the following things:<br/>
1) Bard songs will cause creatures to see through invisibility, sometimes<br/>
even cancel it.<br/>
2) Bard songs will bring someone out of hiding if they are in your group.<br/>
3) Bard songs can break root and whirl spells - even if you aren&#39;t using<br/>
offensive ones.<br/>
<br/>
In other words - Bard songs are major conflictors with other spell effects<br/>
in the game.<br/>
