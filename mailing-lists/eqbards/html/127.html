 </span></blockquote>Valen is in South Karana more or less in the center, though it&#39;s east of Paw<br/>
as I recall.  If you know the zone at all, there&#39;s a stone building in the<br/>
middle of all the flatness, in the centaur spawning area.  Head north and<br/>
you&#39;ll find Valen.<br/>
<br/>
I did all this in beta only to discover that the quest was broken, and Valen<br/>
wouldn&#39;t take the lute.  Then I discovered that once you destroyed the lute,<br/>
you couldn&#39;t get a new one.  Argh.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that it is fixed now.<br/>
<br/>
For lower level bards, South Karana is mostly safe.  Avoid the lions and the<br/>
undead and the raiders, but generally things are indifferent to you.  North<br/>
Karana, on the other hand, is very dangerous.  Keep your drum out and run<br/>
like the wind.<br/>
