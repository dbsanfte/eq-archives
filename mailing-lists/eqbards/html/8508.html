<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question about bard armor quests <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-576048681"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;For example, we need lambent stones for each of the armor <br/>
&gt;pieces.  Will other classes also need lambent stones for <br/>
&gt;their armor quests or are the components they need completely <br/>
&gt;different than ours?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even so, we are talking hill giants and griffons here.  They<br/>
are starting to be hunted more and more on Innoruuk, but I always<br/>
get some HGs on track in Rathe Mountains, and I always seem to <br/>
stubmle onto a griffon in North Karana.  Your tracking is many<br/>
times better than a druid, thus you should be able to find things<br/>
before they do.  As for wizards killstealing... for lament stones?<br/>
You will find nothing different in hunting these monsters, for<br/>
sure.  There are plenty to go around for any quest.<br/>
