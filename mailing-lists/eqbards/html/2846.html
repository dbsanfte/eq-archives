&gt; I&#39;ve been hanging out in Cazic Thule for a few weeks, and we get our fair<br/>
&gt; share of casters there. It amazes me, day after day, how a low level mob (to<br/>
&gt; us) can sustain over 100 points of damage in a split second, and STILL get<br/>
&gt; their spells off 90% of the time, while a bard is bashed for a single point<br/>
&gt; of damage and their song ends, or a spellcaster is smacked for as single<br/>
&gt; point of damage and their spell is interrupted. Is this something Verant did<br/>
&gt; to &quot;give the monsters a chance&quot;? Kinda like how a low level mob can smack<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s usually due to game balance reasons.  It&#39;s easier to<br/>
balance a game when tweaking monsters does not result in<br/>
changes for the players, and vice versa.  So most RPGs end up<br/>
with different rules for players than for mobs.  One of these<br/>
days someone will make a game where this is not the case, and<br/>
everyone plays by the same rules...<br/>

&gt; I am auto-stunned half the time, whether it was for 50 points, or 1 point of<br/>
&gt; damage I receive. Does it have anything to do with my armor? With my Stamina<br/>
&gt; or Strength scores? Any ideas?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it just depends on the monster&#39;s level compared to<br/>
yours.  Stuff that used to stun me all the time when it was<br/>
white or yellow either never or rarely stuns me when it&#39;s<br/>
green, even if I&#39;m running around without any armor.  Bashes<br/>
knock you out of your song every time, regardless of how much<br/>
damage it does.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also point out that stunning is why melee classes are so<br/>
screwed on the PvP server.  The game is designed so that<br/>
casting classes are balanced if the things they are fighting<br/>
can stun the caster frequently.  Aside from the few<br/>
classes/races which can bash, players cannot stun each other,<br/>
and so the melee classes become sitting ducks to the casters.<br/>
