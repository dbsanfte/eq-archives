<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125119542">Despite what people seem to think at times, Verant has three years of 25 or so<br/>
people having worked on this game.  Somewhere there is a Master Design<br/>
Document that is probably around 1,000 pages long.  If you believe that<br/>
decisions like player binding weren&#39;t discussed for litterally hundreds of<br/>
man-hours you&#39;re sorely mistaken and have no idea how much effort and time has<br/>
gone into this game.<br/>
<br/>
NPCs will never be given the ability to bind.  This would kill &quot;Binding for<br/>
donations at gates&quot;, and the sale of binds.  Verant does not want to do this<br/>
(In fact in the Policies and Procedures manual for Guides it forbids Guides<br/>
from binding players because it would &#39;damage the economy of players selling<br/>
binds&#39;).  NPCs binding would lower caster&#39;s value to the non-casters in<br/>
Norrath and eliminate a point of player interaction, Verant doesn&#39;t want that<br/>
either.  I&#39;ve got a 14th level Enchanter and I bind for free all the time even<br/>
though I could use the cash.  Why?  Because I like that feeling I get when<br/>
some 10th level player say &quot;Hey, thanks a lot!!&quot; when I turn down his 2gp that<br/>
he&#39;s trying to donate.  NPCs binding would eliminate that four thousands of<br/>
players.<br/>
<br/>
Bind anywhere?  Never happen.  In fact, I think the casters are probably lucky<br/>
to have gotten that ability, as it&#39;s potentially quite unbalancing when<br/>
fighting uber-mobs like dragons.  &quot;Yeah, I lost a level dying 14 times while<br/>
fighting Vox, but I would just spawn, mem my spells and nuke until I got<br/>
killed.&quot;  This is precicely why Ressurection effects have been made so<br/>
horrendous.  Probably casters being able to bind anywhere was to offset how<br/>
fragile they are should the group get overrun by mobs.  The casters are the<br/>
least likely to make it to the zone alive in a bad situation.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there absolutely HAS to be a serious penalty for dying; it&#39;s a very<br/>
important part of the game.  Many people make the &quot;game fun&quot; or the &quot;I can<br/>
only play two hours a week&quot; argument, but when you consider the impact that<br/>
binding anywhere would have on group dynamics and strategy, you quickly see<br/>
that it works best the way that it is.  Verant has decided that getting to<br/>
your corpse, in addition to the experience lost is what that penalty is.  When<br/>
there is a penalty for dying you coordinate your actions and fight with more<br/>
strategy.  Verant (and I) want this VERY much.  Conversely, if there were<br/>
little or no penalty for dying, sloppy unbalanced groups would just go into a<br/>
place like Mistmoore with little or no regard of how the zone works.  They&#39;d<br/>
just pull the castle and beat on stuff until everything was dead with the<br/>
minor annoyance of having to loot their corpses.  I wouldn&#39;t be addicted to<br/>
that game.<br/>
<br/>
I have never had the problems that you describe getting a bind.  Getting bound<br/>
in Erudin can be tough, as that continent is currently underutilized.  There<br/>
are only two types out there now.  Newbie Erudite players that are trying to<br/>
get up to level 4 or 6 or so before going to Qeynos where the real action is,<br/>
and higher level Druid types running out to Kerra Isle for a questing reason<br/>
that I won&#39;t disclose here.  However, since nothing is really going on out<br/>
there I never really need a bind out there.  Paineel is due to open in the<br/>
next few weeks.  It is a higher level zone built off of Tox Forrest.  Erudin<br/>
is likely to get a lot busier soon, and when it does Kerra Isle will also<br/>
probably start being used for its intended purpose (a teens level zone)<br/>
instead of just having 6 high level druids in it.  I would personally never<br/>
sit for two hours waiting for a bind.  I&#39;d continue to solicit binds if people<br/>
didn&#39;t show up within five or ten minutes.  11pm Mountain?  I routinely play<br/>
until 3am Central and I never have problems getting binds in the major cities.<br/>

&gt; Actually I am more sick of hearing we won&#39;t get bind.  You are right it<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t happen until people start leaving EQ in droves because they are either<br/>
&gt; A, a melee class that is sick of running to their bodies on Kunark from<br/>
&gt; Freeport, or B, they are a caster who is sick of constantly dying because<br/>
&gt; all the tanks have either quit or are an hour away in Freeport because the<br/>
&gt; lizard race is evil and they can&#39;t bind there.  Verant needs to realize that<br/>
&gt; bind is not a class balance issue it is a game fun issue.  I frankly<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t care if we got bind if either everyone could be bound everywhere by<br/>
&gt; a caster, and or there were npc&#39;s to bind you in cities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have quit playing 5 times in the last 2 weeks because I found myself in a<br/>
&gt; city waiting for over an hour trying to get bound.  Adventuring on faydwyr<br/>
&gt; while bound in Freeport is pointless, as is adventuring on erud while bound<br/>
&gt; in Qeynos.  I have never been able to get bound on Erud unless I brought my<br/>
&gt; own binder with me.  I have sat in Kaladim for 2 hours waiting to get bound<br/>
&gt; after having been sent tells by three different casters in Butcherblock<br/>
&gt; saying hold on they would come bind me.  None of them showed and they are<br/>
&gt; all on my ignore list now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only 3 places I have been able to bind in regularly are Freeport,<br/>
&gt; Qeynos, and Rivervale and even in those places its nigh on impossible after<br/>
&gt; 11pm mst.  I hae been bound in Halas for over a week without being able to<br/>
&gt; get a bind after trying in Kaladim, Freeport and Rivervale.  last nite,<br/>
&gt; after 13 hours of play over the last  week I was able to get bound in<br/>
&gt; Rivervale.  For those of us who can&#39;t play in prime time and don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; regular group that gets online together on a consistent basis, binding is<br/>
&gt; currently a ridiculous situation.<br/>

&gt; We are not getting bind.  We will never get bind and we have less need for<br/>
&gt; bind than any other class, considering the rate at which we run.<br/>
&gt; Talies, please KABONG this before this whole arguement starts up yet again.<br/>
&gt; I think most people are sick of hearing it by now<br/>

&gt; This is a posting that was on alt.games.everquest that I think is<br/>
&gt; logical and something that may be considered for a petition.<br/>
&gt; Let me know what you think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a suggestion for a bardic form of Bind Affinity. Bards are amongst<br/>
&gt; Norath&#39;s primary travellers, so it seems a little odd that, somewhere<br/>
&gt; amongst the song set, there is no bind song.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In an effort to avoid the &quot;Give us bind&quot; syndrome, I have applied some<br/>
&gt; thought. If you are already thinking &quot;No way, bind for casters only&quot;, please<br/>
&gt; read on - you might actually be pleasantly surprised.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The great Songmistress Alenia discovered a song, sung by a bard in South<br/>
&gt; Karana, which strangely and uniquely affected her. She aquired the<br/>
&gt; instructions for the singing of the song, and returned with it to Freeport,<br/>
&gt; thinking nothing further of it until her arrival.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; During her travel, she was accosted by a creature which, when she came to<br/>
&gt; loot it, produced a lump of ore. She placed this in her backpack, and<br/>
&gt; continued to freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The following morning, she dug out her notes, and decided to rehearse this<br/>
&gt; new song, before bringing it before her guildmaster for review. As she sang,<br/>
&gt; she noticed that the strange sensation she had experienced previously was<br/>
&gt; lacking, infact, she was most of the way through the song before that<br/>
&gt; sensation returned. Then the unexpected happened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The lump of ore, which she had not yet sold, began to resonate with the<br/>
&gt; chords and notes. Her mind was filled with a passion for the rocks and<br/>
&gt; stones, the earth and grass that had been hewn, cut, shaped and grown into<br/>
&gt; the town of Freeport. Her soul filled with a passion for Freeport, and she<br/>
&gt; realised she had bonded with Freeport.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Feeling suddenly drained, she ceased the song and sat. She had discovered<br/>
&gt; it! She recognised the drained sensation from tales her mother had told her,<br/>
&gt; and with a clap of joy she cried out &quot;Mana!&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --- The practical explanation ---<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bard&#39;s Bind would have a lengthy casting time instead of the usual &quot;3.0&quot;.<br/>
&gt; And it would use mana, and a component (a piece of ore, or maybe some other<br/>
&gt; item which would fuel a bit of economy).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The mana would be, say, 200 units. However; bard&#39;s bind would ALSO be a<br/>
&gt; group effect, requiring, say, 100 or 150 units of mana per extra person<br/>
&gt; bound. During the bind, each of the targets must be seated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That means: Bard sings bind, 1 member of party (within radius) is not<br/>
&gt; sitting for the entire casting duration, bind fails.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the bard is grouped with, say, 4 people, he would need 200 + 4 x 100 =<br/>
&gt; 600 units of mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The numbers might need juggling so that a bard can bind a full party of 6 by<br/>
&gt; level 30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would suggest that the song be implemented as level 20 or 21, and that the<br/>
&gt; songs be shuffled so that it effectively replaces the level 14 song (the<br/>
&gt; cataloging libretto).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Implementing level 21 makes most sense, since you could then move Melanie&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Melifluous motion down to level 14.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t, however, think that we bards should get bind early (e.g. level 14).<br/>
&gt; I think prior to that point, making sure you can get bound is a good<br/>
&gt; encouragement for people to learn to *play* their character *as* a bard, to<br/>
&gt; socialise and such.<br/>

&gt; Servant of Bristlebane<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ------------------------<br/>
&gt; My Comments:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow, I have to say that you really did think that out.  I like the fact that<br/>
&gt; you have couples the song with mana and with a reagent.  I go back and forth<br/>
&gt; with the group based bind.  One one hand, it would provide the melee classes<br/>
&gt; with a way to avoid a 5 zone run back to their body, on the other hand it<br/>
&gt; would probally cause an influx of people playing bards just to get that<br/>
&gt; ability.  On the plus side, the bard would be even more important to a<br/>
&gt; group.  I think by giving this abilitiy later in life, at say 21 as you say<br/>
&gt; is a great idea.  Its far enough in that the casual player wont play for 21<br/>
&gt; levels if they really dont like it. But not too far that its out of the<br/>
&gt; range of the committed bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One addendum to that idea of yours, would be to put a singing restriction on<br/>
&gt; the bard bind similar or greater to the paladin lay of hands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a restriction like that was put on it, I would have NO problem with it<br/>
&gt; being group based bind.  In addition you might make getting the song be a<br/>
&gt; hard involved quest that someone who is 21 could do solo, but would take a<br/>
&gt; lot of time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, to summarize:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Song: Bardic Binding Bellow<br/>
&gt; Level: 21<br/>
&gt; Casting Req&#39;s:  Mana, 200 (Self) + 100 Per group member, 800 Mana for full<br/>
&gt; group + Reagent (Enchanted electrum or something like that),<br/>
&gt; ore, etc. Possibly make a Zone Specific Reagent<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stipulations: Can only be sung once per day, similar to Lay of Hands<br/>
&gt; Acquired: By multi-part quest, forcing the bard to travel to many zones<br/>
&gt; (thus preventing us from becoming Bind whores)<br/>
&gt;                Possible addendum to this.. make two spells.. the first being<br/>
&gt;                a Self-Only Bind that is bought at a merchant.  Still<br/>
&gt;                would use reagents, but would not have a casting restriction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                The Second Bind spell would be a Quest.  It would be group<br/>
&gt;                bind, but would difficult AND have a casting delay built in<br/>
&gt;                like lay of Hands, etc.  If you did it this way, you could<br/>
&gt;                even make the delay greater, say 2 days.  This would enable<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;                bard to be able to self-bind at any time, but only group bind<br/>
&gt;                on a limited basis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think this is an excellent idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
