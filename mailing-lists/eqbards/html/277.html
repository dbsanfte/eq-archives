<div id="ygrps-yiv-845992026">I would be very interested in such a guild, since that&#39;s what I already<br/>
strive to do - sometimes risking my neck.  Please post information to the<br/>
board if it gets started.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the name Song of Service.<br/>

According to the illustrious Bob Stewart...<br/>
:)We could start one.  Consider a guild, perhaps of bards or perhaps allowing<br/>
:)other classes, whose primary purpose is to help one another and others.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
:)We could name it, say, &quot;Song of &lt;something&gt;&quot;  like Harmony, Service, Aid,<br/>
:)or such.  I like &quot;Song of Service.&quot;  If you&#39;re in trouble, call out SoS.<br/>
