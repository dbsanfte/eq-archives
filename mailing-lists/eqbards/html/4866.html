<div id="ygrps-yiv-844904378">That does make a lot of sense and really makes me think they will have a<br/>
hell of a time fixing it.<br/>
<br/>
My guess would be that in the orignal design you could levitate and attack<br/>
from on-high with little or no risk when attacking a melee only mob. When<br/>
they went in to &quot;fix&quot; this and created our little z-axis bug, they really<br/>
had no way to effectively block mob&#39;s at different elevations or through<br/>
floors and walls from getting hit with songs/spell effects.<br/>
<br/>
Basicially what Verant would have to do is implement some sort of colission<br/>
detection code that would stop the songs effects from passing through the<br/>
enironment where their are barriers (walls, floors). Of course if they got<br/>
really fancy they could try to model sound waves and how they would bounce<br/>
off the surfaces. Imagine singing Denon&#39;s down a long echoing corridor!<br/>

&gt; Z-axis &quot;bug&quot; is in fact a required design flaw to prevent casters from<br/>
&gt; easily whomping tanks.  Picture this, if you will: BigBlaster the caster<br/>
&gt; levitates high over the head of Lockjaw.  Lockjaw, being melee-only, can<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; nothing but whine and complain, while BigBlaster laughs at him and pummels<br/>
&gt; him repeatedly from the safety of his levitation.  With this Z-axis bug,<br/>
&gt; melee-only critters can now hit levitators.  So, instead of taking out the<br/>
&gt; one spell that caused the problem, they added 27 other new problems in<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; place.<br/>
