<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922376342">I&#39;m a bit confused why wouldn&#39;t a bard be a hybrids along those lines? They<br/>
get rogue skills along with a mix of songs from all the casting classes.<br/>
They have some enchanter type spells, some druid/shaman type spells, and<br/>
even some dots which you could throw in under Necros. I&#39;m sorry but because<br/>
of the huge mix from all the classes bards are obviously a hybrid by this<br/>
definition. The definition which happens to be the one Verant obviously<br/>
uses.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Clerics, Druids, and shaman are priest classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok let&#39;s go with that. What is that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They can cast spells.. Caster.<br/>
&gt;They can use weapons and armor.. Fighter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry, from what I can tell that&#39;s a hybrid. If you<br/>
&gt;want to call it a priest, then I&#39;d say a priest is<br/>
&gt;a hybrid. If Clerics, Druids or Shamen aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;hybrids because they&#39;re priests and get their powers<br/>
&gt;from their dieties, then a Bard isn&#39;t a hybrid either<br/>
&gt;because their power comes from music. NO other class<br/>
&gt;does that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re claiming that &quot;preists&quot; aren&#39;t hybrids because<br/>
&gt;of *where* their abilities come from. Thinking along<br/>
&gt;those lines you simply can not disagree that a Bard<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be a hybrid because of where HIS abilities<br/>
&gt;come from like no other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The fact is that they have multiple abilities from<br/>
&gt;other different classes just like a Bard does.<br/>
