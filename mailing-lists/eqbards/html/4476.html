<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133455846"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; I cant get this song to do squat. On mobs it will pulse with the animation<br/>
&gt;&gt; that looks like selo&#39;s accelerando on us, and this will irritate the<br/>
&gt;&gt; creature causing them to attack me but thats all i can tell. I tried<br/>
&gt;&gt; dualing a friend and it wouldnt even pulse on them, though it was<br/>
&gt;&gt; irritating the snakes and bats around me. For that matter, i couldnt even<br/>
&gt;&gt; get the dissonance to hurt them. Bellows hurt them, and i could wack all<br/>
&gt;&gt; day on them with my weapons, but no aoe song hit them. Didnt try fear now<br/>
&gt;&gt; that i think of it... this happened before todays patch but after the last<br/>
&gt;&gt; patch. Anybody know what was going on here? I am going to try this again<br/>
&gt;&gt; today after this patch and see what happens...<br/>

&gt;You were grouped. :)  Our AE songs (thank goodness!) don&#39;t affect our party<br/>
&gt;members.  Good thing -  if they did, I&#39;d be pretty much out of a job.  A great<br/>
&gt;annoyance though is that AE songs do hurt party members pets, making it<br/>
&gt;very tricky to group with them.  Wouldn&#39;t it make sense that if our buff songs<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t help pets, our damage songs wouldn&#39;t hurt them?  :(  Ah well...<br/>
