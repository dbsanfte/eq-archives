<div id="ygrps-yiv-939970414">Splitpaw - most everything is fooled by invis.  Invis up and you can go<br/>
pretty much anywhere (only named mobs are likely to see you if even they<br/>
do.)  But after that, be aware that Paw mobs have a large &quot;social&quot; radius.<br/>
Attack one and others will &quot;know&quot; about it.  Healers will heal the one you<br/>
are fighting if it&#39;s within the social range.  A single group will need to<br/>
pick their spots carefully.  Learn the patrol routes and find a place or<br/>
room you can clear - then pull to that room.  Also, at your level, you will<br/>
prolly not be able to pull singles without using lament and even then you<br/>
will have to pick carefully.  Have your druid save mana for evac and dont be<br/>
afraid to use it.  <br/>
<br/>
Iirc, the kisch drops back near the old commander&#39;s room.  As deep as you<br/>
can go on one side of the dungeon.  And it&#39;s near where the old shaman&#39;s<br/>
line was.  There were like 6 to 8 mobs in close proximity - all shamans -<br/>
and they would heal if your fights got too close.  They would attack if you<br/>
were low enough relative to their level.  Cant remember what they are now<br/>
but the AI is the same - just the mob levels are 15-20 levs higher.<br/>

<br/>
My regular group (28 Pally, 29 druid and 28 warrior)<br/>
and I at 32 are hunting the entrance to Infected PAW<br/>
tonight.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking at the map from eqatlas.com, looks like the<br/>
fabled Kisch drops very far from the entrance but my<br/>
initial contact with the place was very intense and<br/>
enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of action in this place -- looks to me like two<br/>
full groups are needed to keep the entry areas clean<br/>
of spawn...we&#39;ll prolly be here a bit since the xp and<br/>
loot rock.  That said, can anyone give me advice on<br/>
invading the deeper regions? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
