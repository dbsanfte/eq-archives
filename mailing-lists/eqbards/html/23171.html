<div id="ygrps-yiv-745208789">The biggest difference is that the hybrids will no longer take such a huge<br/>
chunk from everyone else.  Under the old system a lvl 35 halfling druid<br/>
grouped with a level 35 half elf ranger got under 40% of the experience<br/>
gained.  Under the new system he will get half plus 2% so it is more<br/>
beneficial for him to group than before.  Under the old system he was far<br/>
better off soloing since a 35th level ranger certainly didn&#39;t more than<br/>
double his combat effectiveness.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Some math on the new xp<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my post on the EQvaults forums, thought maybe th ebard community<br/>
would want to see my figures.<br/>
<br/>
Yea its not really that big of a difference.  Your shadowknight is not about<br/>
to start leveling 40% faster. (Unless you solo all the time).  Some quick<br/>
(and probably not all that accurate) math:<br/>
<br/>
My cleric&#39;s regular group is warrior, wizard, cleric, bard.  I will list the<br/>
individual xp for the cleric only as they were formerly the baseline.  The<br/>
%increase will be equal for all members though (well except that the warrior<br/>
will be slightly higher).<br/>
<br/>
Last Thrusday in Dalinars (not a zone which got an xp bump, more on that<br/>
later), we got 4000 xp total.  I need 1000 xp to level (warrior needs 900,<br/>
wizard 1100, bard 1400).<br/>
<br/>
4000 x 1.06 (former xp bonus) = 4240 xp<br/>
Cleric gets 963 xp,<br/>
Wiz gets 1060<br/>
War gets 867<br/>
Bard gets 1349<br/>
<br/>
All just short of our level (shucks).<br/>
<br/>
This week we do the exact same thing.<br/>
<br/>
4000 x 1.1  (new group xp) = 4400<br/>
Cleric gets 1100 xp<br/>
Wiz gets 1210<br/>
War gets 1100<br/>
Bard gets 1540<br/>
<br/>
All but warrior get 1 lvl plus half a bub into the next (5.5 bubs).  Warrior<br/>
is a hair over a bubble into his second level.  This is about a 14% gain in<br/>
xp for the party.  However, since deaths are not factored in here, the %<br/>
gain will be lower in reality.<br/>
<br/>
Ok now lets take it a step further.  Say we were in Nurga which recieved a<br/>
12% xp increase.  We can merely multipl our total by 12% to see my new xp to<br/>
be the following:<br/>
Cleric 1232.<br/>
<br/>
That is 1 level and a bit into my second bub of the next level (6.16 bubs)<br/>
Or 127% of my original xp.<br/>
<br/>
Again death will reduce this percentage, but still it remains a nice boost.<br/>
<br/>
