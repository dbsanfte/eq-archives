<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581060138">Ahhh Chainmail ... yes I started there too.<br/>
<br/>
Miniatures helped, but you could play without.  I remember one &quot;Oh you have<br/>
to see this idea!&quot; chainmail setup which was masking tape and books for the<br/>
layout on a ping pong table and miniatures for those that had one when the<br/>
idea &quot;hit&quot;.  The rest of us were ... ping pong balls (what&#39;s the movement<br/>
rate on that?).  <br/>
<br/>
Then D&D, Traveler, Call of Cthulu, ICE (both the FRP & Space systems),<br/>
GURPS, then AD&D (orig), and I started to feel the demands of my growing<br/>
family and quit table-topping about AD&D 2nd Edition.<br/>
<br/>
And non of the men in any generation RPed in my family. :)  <br/>
<br/>
So far ... watching my son closely :P<br/>
<br/>
IMHO Women run games & women designed modules/worlds always seemed to have<br/>
a better plot-line, more cohesive events and more depth of plot.  Mainly<br/>
because when we design .. we have to keep asking ourselves .. But WHY would<br/>
the NPC do THAT? (its a female thing - we HAVE to know)<br/>
<br/>
- that grey-haired woman<br/>
(Why are the college co-ops at work discussing 3D cards & and on-line games<br/>
with her?)</div>
