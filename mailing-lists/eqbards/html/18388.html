<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779008327">Wow!  Can&#39;t say enough good things about the exp mi... err goblin mine &lt;g&gt; in Ill Omen.  Went there on a tip from a guildmate at 29 Friday night, and am now halfway to 31 (and that&#39;s with studying for finals, *and* getting a tp to WC to go buy songs in FP, HPH, and Qeynos, then insta-porting back to Kunark via the Qeynos Arena and a helpdul young warrior.    heeheehee).  Even though the warlords still give good experience, the other critters are kinda slow :o/<br/>
    So, any ideas on where I can go next for great solo exp?  I&#39;ld like to hang around Kunark so I can be here for 32, and weasel my way  (using manasong as leverage :op  ) into one of the Karnor groups getting all the nifty bard items.<br/>
