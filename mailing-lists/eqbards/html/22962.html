<div id="ygrps-yiv-50412922">Only one real disagreement, with the new Brownie Scout roaming about Lesser<br/>
Fay is a deathtrap.  That little &$%#@?! can take down a level 52 wizard<br/>
before he can even turn around.  And that&#39;s with J-boots!<br/>
<br/>
Putting in roaming melee mobs that are dangerous and higher than the normal<br/>
zone mobs, aka Hill Giants, is one thing.  Putting in a high level SoW&#39;d<br/>
caster mob that roams and slaughters is ridiculous.  Especially when he&#39;s<br/>
somewhere around 45th level.<br/>
