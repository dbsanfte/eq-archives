<div id="ygrps-yiv-582630154">well first thing to do is hope someone is camping the tower in guk (where<br/>
the ass and supplier spawn)<br/>
<br/>
go to the dead side zone to lower. go down the ramp, go right... go into the<br/>
water, go right again, you&#39;ll go through a small underwater tunnel and pop<br/>
up in the &quot;bedroom&quot; usually some groups 33-37 camping that. Now here&#39;s where<br/>
you have a choice...  there are 2 ways to get to the tower where the bridge<br/>
is. <br/>
<br/>
1. go left with invis undead past the damn greater ice bones (4-5 of em<br/>
casting on ya hurts like hell)<br/>
2. go right and hope the spider halls are camped till the bridge<br/>
<br/>
so basically your best shot is IVU past the ice bones to the bridge, once at<br/>
the bridge, keep going into the tower, go up the second ladder (its around<br/>
the corner). &quot;Usually&quot; if someone is camping the ass the whole tower will be<br/>
frog-free. Be much safer if you get someone to guide ya there though<br/>

Well folks, Elfson has gotten the hell out of... well hell (part 2).  So at<br/>
lvl 36, I think its time to get my guise of deciever.<br/>
<br/>
I have some maps of Lower (and Upper) guk, and have bought a few invis to<br/>
undead potions.<br/>
<br/>
Any reccomendations for making it to the assasin room?  Whats the easiest<br/>
path there?  How do I change over from normal invis to invis to undead<br/>
(without becoming visible and dying)?<br/>
<br/>
thanks :)<br/>
