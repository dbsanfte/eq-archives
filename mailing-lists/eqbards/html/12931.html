<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952475476">This is a far fetched example, consider everything you are saying:<br/>
<br/>
1.  People I group with I don&#39;t know/they look out for themselves.<br/>
2.  I don&#39;t group with a cleric that can res me.<br/>
3.  I am bound &quot;far away&quot;.<br/>
4.  I die late at night when the group is close to breaking up anyway,<br/>
    and the group will abandon me.<br/>
5.  I die in a dungeon, not near a zone.<br/>
<br/>
You have 5 strikes here, I don&#39;t think Verant should have to consider<br/>
such bad luck.  People don&#39;t seem to realize that the &quot;difficulty to get<br/>
back&quot; factor should count into how you play an area.  In outside zones<br/>
or in areas close to a zone, I know my groups usually play it pretty risky<br/>
because we know we can all run away easily.  When we are in the king <br/>
room of LGuk, we are dang careful we never have to evac.  Why are we so<br/>
careful?  For us, its not the time to get back to the zone, its the time<br/>
to clear our way back into the king room.  We as a group will accept<br/>
less xp, fewer kills in return for some added safety.  I&#39;ve made<br/>
it a point never to group deep in/with strangers...  <br/>
<br/>
(Yes I know the king room and the quick exit, there is no need to<br/>
evac, I used a bad example, blah blah blah)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>
&gt; considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the problem is<br/>
&gt; magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so when I play<br/>
&gt; its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull turns bad<br/>
&gt; and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far away,<br/>
&gt; the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the casters<br/>
&gt; leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get back to the<br/>
&gt; zone they died in.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this into<br/>
&gt; consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.  I<br/>
&gt; think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play with<br/>
&gt; all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs personal<br/>
&gt; welfare.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; If the casters in your group gate out and leave you to die, they are not good<br/>
&gt; &gt; groupies.<br/>
