<div id="ygrps-yiv-332288483">Ahh well I&#39;m on E&#39;ci also and while I wasn&#39;t in Kith at the main attack I<br/>
was in West Commons and while wegot quite a few melee items there were no<br/>
classes in are two groups of 44+ mages. Still to me it seemed the melee<br/>
classes got more items then us. I know we pulled two pairs of +18 ac and a<br/>
bunch of other stats rager only legs. Best mage item we got was a measly<br/>
45hp 45mana necklace.<br/>

&gt;Well, E&#39;ci&#39;s version of the event got screwed up by some greedy high<br/>
&gt;leevls.  Most all of the good NPC&#39;s were killed and I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt;anyone got rewarded except for those who got to loot the undead and<br/>
&gt;dark elves (read greedy high level bastards).  The high levels weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;all bad, though, some would leave the loot if they couldn&#39;t use it and<br/>
&gt;broadcast to the zone where it was...so some greedy high level<br/>
&gt;(who probably couldn&#39;t use it) would come and pick it up.  Bitter?<br/>
&gt;Nah.  Actually I only died once in the whole thing, when I was blinded<br/>
&gt;by Innoruk&#39;s hate.  Friend of mine died at least 3 times and lost exp<br/>
&gt;everytime.  My guess for the portal is Kithicor or Nektulos forest.  I<br/>
&gt;doubt they&#39;d put a portal in a town, even if it is Neriak.  I just<br/>
&gt;wish I had something to show for my 3 hours of running around the<br/>
&gt;continent.<br/>
