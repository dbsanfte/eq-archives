<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072547403">I don&#39;t know, if I thought about it I&#39;m sure I could come up with some<br/>
perfectly reasonable argument that my magician should get SoW at lvl<br/>
5...just for himself.  But he never does.  And it sucks.  My bard never gets<br/>
bind.  That sucks, too.  But I&#39;d rather they never got each other&#39;s<br/>
abilities.<br/>

&gt; Hate to bring this up again, but we Bards seem more like the semi-caster<br/>
&gt; shamans and clerics than the Paladins and Shadowknights.  I don&#39;t see why<br/>
