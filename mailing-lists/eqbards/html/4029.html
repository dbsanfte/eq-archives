<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004174671">Was quite a long ways back (months), and I was in the little skiff, playing<br/>
accelerando, outracing the ship.  People on deck were watching me,<br/>
frustrated to say the least, especially with my taunting shouts.  Was like a<br/>
speedboat!  Now those damn skiffs are so slow, I&#39;m faster swimming.<br/>
