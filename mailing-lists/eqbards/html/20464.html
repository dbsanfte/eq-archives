&gt; one of these too!  Oh, and it&#39;s about 4lbs lighter than the bronze<br/>
&gt; helm, which is great as I&#39;m already borderline encumbered as it is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oh, if that is the case, get a Thick Leather Apron for your belt, light<br/>
weight, great AC, very fashionable, about 20pp. Rumored to be available in<br/>
Wheat, Taupe, Ecru and Burgundy. <br/>
