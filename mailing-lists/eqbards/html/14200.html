 </span></blockquote>  I was able to stick Pixie Strike on an ice giant out front of<br/>
  Permafrost keep.  I made both resist checks, but since we were<br/>
  engaging it, I couldn&#39;t tell if the stun would hold it.  I know<br/>
  normal stun spells do not actually stun giants.  A paladin can<br/>
  walk up to one, and boom Holy Might it or whatever series they<br/>
  get and it says &#39;a sand giant is stunned.&#39;  but the sand giant<br/>
  keeps on swinging.  My guess would be that this holds true for<br/>
  us, that when you get a full pixie on the ice giant it will just<br/>
  shrug it off.  I&#39;ll try to test it more sometime this week.  I&#39;m<br/>
  currently in PoF  ;)   And CHA 180 with a flute works really good<br/>
  against scarlings and spinechiller spiders using pixie. ;)<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, damn... I&#39;ve never seen a train that big before:<br/>
<br/>
  4 scarlings, 3 spinechillers, 2 shiverbacks, and a worry wraith.<br/>
<br/>
  And I still camped out without dying, hurrah bad pathing! hehehe.</div>
