&gt; The dark elf was stupid.  Smiting you was a total waste of his mana unless<br/>
&gt; his smites alone could kill you which he should have known they could not.<br/>
&gt; Try that against a dwarf cleric who knows waht he&#39;s doing and you will die.<br/>
&gt; especially now that he can root you and you can&#39;t interrupt his healing when<br/>
&gt; he backs away.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An interesting note on this. A friend of mine plays a dwarf cleric and<br/>
dueled a L40 warrior back when he was L35 (it was not a friendly duel)<br/>
He won, though one of the warrior&#39;s buddys used LoH on the warrior<br/>
before he actually killed him.<br/>
