<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031303591">I had fun as well.  Played a Paladin in beta but didnt get over level 6.  I<br/>
had fun running around and exploring though.  It was really hard for me to<br/>
move around at first.  EQ was my first real game and so using the keyboard<br/>
was tough and it took me a long time to realize it worked better in third<br/>
person in DAoC.  I think you can remap the buttons though.  I especially<br/>
despised the using the right mouse button to move forward.  I was like all<br/>
spazzing out and falling into the moat and stuff.  I really liked how the<br/>
newbie mobs are really small and the things get bigger as you go, that was<br/>
fun.  I think I will play it but am not sure.. maybe between now and when<br/>
Luclin comes out?<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, my guild killed the 4th warder last night!!! Quite a moment<br/>
of excitement, although for some reason some of the people in our guild were<br/>
moving the sleeper around.  (If you didnt know, you can hit him and &quot;move&quot;<br/>
him even though he isnt alive).  Anyway, he fell into the water and for some<br/>
reason teh GMs say that caused the script not to run so now we have to DO IT<br/>
ALL OVER AGAIN TONIGHT.  I hope we can!!!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; First off, the newbie levels are IMO just like EQ with the <br/>
&gt; small difference<br/>
&gt; that solo is easier and corpse recovery is non existent. I <br/>
&gt; actually let my<br/>
&gt; self get killed to get back to town instead of running <br/>
&gt; *shrug* There was no<br/>
&gt; death penalty..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I felt that the mobs where more &quot;stupid&quot; than in EQ. Even <br/>
&gt; hobgoblins dont<br/>
&gt; assist eachother when youre alone against them.<br/>
&gt; *shrug* <br/>
&gt; I also miss newbie dungeons. All battle at lower levels is in <br/>
&gt; the open. My<br/>
&gt; overall impression was the there really wasent many <br/>
&gt; dungeons.. Hope they add<br/>
&gt; some nice ones ala Crushbone, BlackBurrow, Befallen etc.. <br/>
&gt; Dungeon fighting<br/>
&gt; is fun :)<br/>
&gt; I also like the prospect of getting into some serius PvP <br/>
&gt; Something i havent<br/>
&gt; done since the days of Meridian 59 *grin*<br/>

&gt; *Snipped some*<br/>
&gt; &gt;  The three <br/>
&gt; &gt; biggest improvements I think they have made are: (1) Quests: <br/>
&gt; &gt; Apparently they <br/>
&gt; &gt; have some sort of questing journal that helps you keep track <br/>
&gt; &gt; of all of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; quests you have taken part in and remind you what the next <br/>
&gt; &gt; step is that you <br/>
&gt; &gt; need to take. This includes picking up a drop from a mob that <br/>
&gt; &gt; is part of a <br/>
&gt; &gt; quest. No more spamming a zone asking if anyone knows what <br/>
&gt; &gt; the Raw Sword is <br/>
&gt; &gt; for or something like that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Aye the /quest command is soooeeee nice....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Also, the quests are supposed to <br/>
&gt; &gt; change for each <br/>
&gt; &gt; character so they are level specific. No more high levels <br/>
&gt; &gt; camping low level <br/>
&gt; &gt; quests for no experience. (2) Travel: I guess there are <br/>
&gt; &gt; horses that you can <br/>
&gt; &gt; rent from NPCs which run you from stable to stable at a very <br/>
&gt; &gt; fast rate. You <br/>
&gt; &gt; can jump off at any time or continue to the destination. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Nobody has to waste <br/>
&gt; &gt; fifteen minutes of valuable playing time running across West <br/>
&gt; &gt; Karana. (3) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mhh debatable..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Death: Whether it is realistic or not, players retain all of <br/>
&gt; &gt; their equipment <br/>
&gt; &gt; after death. Levels can&#39;t be lost due to death either. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Experience loss can be <br/>
&gt; &gt; regained by returning to the place of death (marked by a <br/>
&gt; &gt; gravestone) and <br/>
&gt; &gt; praying. There is also a loss of constitution points which <br/>
&gt; &gt; can be bought back <br/>
&gt; &gt; from a merchant. Clerics can also revive experience and <br/>
&gt; &gt; constitution loss <br/>
&gt; &gt; (just like EQ, but I thought I should mention it).<br/>
&gt; &gt;        There are other things that I like about DAoC also, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but these are the <br/>
&gt; &gt; biggees in my estimation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
