&gt; I guess I really don&#39;t understand this.  Maybe I&#39;m incorrect in assuming<br/>
&gt; that the whole point of EverQuest is the experience of getting to level 50.<br/>
&gt;  There may be a few challenges left at level 50, but that&#39;s not really what<br/>
&gt; the game is all about.  Once you reach 50, I don&#39;t really see the point.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;ve won, essentially.  You&#39;ve become a demi-god, or whatever. If it was<br/>
&gt; a single player game, it would be over.  Why should Verant have to generate<br/>
&gt; content for those that have maximized their characters, beyond the few<br/>
&gt; really tough encounters that should be the ultimate victories for said<br/>
&gt; characters?  Once you&#39;ve killed Nafagen, or Lady Vox, or other Uber-mob,<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t it be time to retire?  Obviously this stance would cause the<br/>
&gt; level 50 people to stop playing, and move on to other games, but I think<br/>
&gt; that this is how it should be (unless they want to play as a different<br/>
&gt; character). <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I guess as other games, like the Realm, and even UO were able to<br/>
keep people amused for years even after they had maxed out their<br/>
characters, most of us had an expectation that EQ would be the same.<br/>
Online games are _not_ single player games. If they expect to keep a<br/>
user base they have to provide something to do. <br/>
<br/>
 The VAST majority of players still haven&#39;t reached 50, and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; most aren&#39;t even close.  Verant can&#39;t make the game revolve around<br/>
&gt; powergamers, because they would never be able to keep up.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you are very wrong here. One the older servers, the vast<br/>
majority of players are well over L30 now, or at least on Tarrew Marr<br/>
where I play that is the case. And a large majority of the players on<br/>
the server under L30 are second characters.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In fact, I&#39;m for<br/>
&gt; putting level 50 characters into forced retirement until the expansion<br/>
&gt; pack.  That way we could get rid of all this farming for guilds, and for<br/>
&gt; other twinked characters.  Plus we&#39;d stop distracting the developers from<br/>
&gt; fixing the real problems with the game.  In my opinion, lack of things for<br/>
&gt; level 50 players to do is not an important problem in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you think pushing L50&#39;s out of the game would stop farming for guilds<br/>
you are dreaming. It was happening long before there were any L50&#39;s on<br/>
our server. I think it started happening the first week they created<br/>
guilds at all.<br/>
