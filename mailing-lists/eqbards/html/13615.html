<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994500256">I was surprised myself when it did so little damage.  It is too bad the game <br/>
does not tell you how much the AE breath does do, it would be easier to see <br/>
how effective CR/FR is.  All I know is that I will never do a dragon without <br/>
my dragon kit :)  At the Nag run I forgot my kit and had to get killed in a <br/>
duel to grap it from the bank.  One of the other bards at the Vox run was <br/>
NOT in any visible resist gear (in nearly full plane armor, level 50) and <br/>
she died, I finished with nearly full health.<br/>

&gt; &gt; breath as over the weekend we did both Nag & Vox (other guilds were <br/>
&gt;sloted<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do them but they could not take em and yield them to my guild).  And <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; both runs I has taking as little as 1/8th a bubble from dragon breaths.  <br/>
&gt;My<br/>
&gt; &gt; FR/CR was 220+ in both cases.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I wasn&#39;t there, I can&#39;t say.  And I can&#39;t call you a liar.<br/>
&gt;   But it&#39;s my opinion that you are exaggerating quite a bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve been next to a dragon three times, CR 222, FR 170 and<br/>
&gt;   I took 400, yes four-hundred, points of dmg regardless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   And 1/8th of a bubble?  Rokken, come on man gimme a break.<br/>
&gt;   You cannot expect me to believe that. heh.  Your fish is getting<br/>
&gt;   a little too big.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
