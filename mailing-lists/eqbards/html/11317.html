<b>Subject:</b> RE: Guise of the Deceiver question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-368799299">I&#39;ve had a guise for a couple of levels now (I&#39;m 37th) and have been fairly<br/>
careful with it.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found thus far:<br/>
<br/>
After killing a bunch of DE guards in Nektulos Forest (I&#39;d reckon around<br/>
30-50) I&#39;m completely KOS in the Forrest and in Neriak itself with the Guise<br/>
on.  I kinda wish I handn&#39;t killed the DE guards, because it would be<br/>
convenient to be able to use Neriak, but hey...  The DE guards have &quot;KILL<br/>
ME&quot; signs taped on them.<br/>
<br/>
I can use the vendors and Hail the guards in EC with the Guise up, although<br/>
my faction goes from &quot;kindly&quot; to &quot;apprehensive&quot;.  I suspect that a complete<br/>
newbie who is indifferent to them would, in DE illusion, go from<br/>
&quot;indifferent&quot; to &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have never killed any Troll or Ogre guards in my career and I can now<br/>
safely shop and bank in both Oggok and Grobb.  The vendors there are<br/>
&quot;apprehesive&quot; or perhaps &quot;dubious&quot; to me.  It seems like I *have*<br/>
contributed a couple of hits (and thereby received the faction adjustments)<br/>
to a couple of Ogre Guards, but not more than two for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reluctant to fire the Guise up in Freeport or Qeynos, but I<br/>
*think* I&#39;d be ok with most folks.  I&#39;m concerned because the Guise seems to<br/>
drop your faction 2 notches that if I stumbled across a vendor or guild<br/>
leader that was only &quot;dubious&quot; when I was level 1 that I had since raised to<br/>
&quot;indifferent&quot; that he would drop back to &quot;scowling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, using the Guise is taking a bit of cautious experimentation, but I<br/>
*can* use Grobb and Oggok.  It&#39;s been *very* useful to be able to shop and<br/>
bank in Oggok from Cazic-Thule and Rathe Mts.<br/>

&gt; I was concerned that when in dark elf form I would be attacked by<br/>
&gt; the guards<br/>
&gt; and inhabitants of the good aligned cities I am normally looked<br/>
&gt; upon kindly<br/>
&gt; or warmly by, but this is not the case.  Apparently you keep all your<br/>
&gt; faction adjustments while under the dark elf illusion of the guise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question is, is it useful in any way to by disguised as a dark elf when<br/>
&gt; attempting to enter the evil aligned cities or is the mask&#39;s illusion just<br/>
&gt; some nice eye-candy that gives you infravision?<br/>
