<div id="ygrps-yiv-611694462">Not that I&#39;ve done this, my highest charecter is still level 17, but take a<br/>
look at it through a role playing veiw.....<br/>
Father is a retired high level Warrior who finds a nice lady, settles down<br/>
and has kids....<br/>
Son grows up and wants to be a warrior like daddy, so he enters that<br/>
profession<br/>
Father doesnt want son to go through what he did, but he accepts the fact<br/>
that son wants to do this. But, Father doesnt want son to be in too much<br/>
danger if he can help it, so he gives son his old armor and weapons....<br/>
Much like Nobles of ancient times used to inherit thier armor/weapons from<br/>
older family members, and were no where near as good as thier elders when<br/>
they aquired it....<br/>
Just a different point of view....<br/>

&gt;You&#39;re applying single-player game mentalities to a<br/>
&gt;multi-player game.  Spawns that give things like rubicite are<br/>
&gt;a limited resource.  If someone uses his high level character<br/>
&gt;to get equipment like that for his low level characters, he is<br/>
&gt;depriving others of the chance to get that item, thus<br/>
&gt;increasing the camping problem on that spawn.  It is not<br/>
&gt;jealousy, it is a legitimate gripe that someone has figured<br/>
&gt;out a way to cut in line and get two or more of something,<br/>
&gt;when you&#39;re still waiting in line to get one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(And I&#39;ll repeat what I said last time:  The real meta-issue<br/>
&gt;behind this problem is server overcrowding.  If the servers<br/>
&gt;weren&#39;t so crowded, this would be much less of a problem<br/>
&gt;because the &quot;lines&quot; would be shorter or nonexistant.)<br/>
