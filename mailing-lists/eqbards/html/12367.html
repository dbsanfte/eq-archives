<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799639888">I noticed this two, even more strangely I was able to weave healing and<br/>
invis and still not be seen.  It could be there are some mobs which cannot<br/>
see thru invis that can see you when the song pulses.  I was definitely able<br/>
to stand right next to a mob that would normally agro and weave invis and<br/>
healing without activating it.  The mob I tested on was a gnoll reaver in<br/>
East Karana.  He was blue to me and I was right in front of him, yet he<br/>
ignored me and stayed indifferent the whole time I was weaving the two<br/>
songs.<br/>

I&#39;ve read on the Bard Song Analysis page, that in a 2 bard party, you cannot<br/>
have one singing invisibility, and the other singing any other song (such as<br/>
healing, or see invis, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[Ziann] With 2 bards in the group... if you get separated and both are<br/>
singing<br/>
invis you will go visible for a pulse when meeting up.  Also on the same<br/>
note<br/>
you can not have 2 bards singing invis at the same time as both bards will<br/>
go<br/>
visible on the song pulses.  This can be deadly when you are deep in a place<br/>
like Mistmoore Castle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[Kaearia] Any song will allow mobs to see you even if you are still<br/>
invisible.  e.g. If one bard is singing this song, and another is singing<br/>
Hymn,<br/>
the mobs can see you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, my experience in a 2 bard party last night would seem to indicate<br/>
differently.  We seemed to be invis, and healing at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done any tests with this?<br/>
