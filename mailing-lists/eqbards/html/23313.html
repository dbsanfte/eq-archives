<div id="ygrps-yiv-837220499">I was playing my cleric this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I have my #4 button set up to throw my main heal, and #0 set up with the<br/>
Spells hotkey.<br/>

I think I have the following imprint on my left index finger:<br/>

Hehe...  :)  Stand, heal, sit.  Stand, heal, sit.  Had an awesome group.<br/>
Had one main tank that managed to take *all* the beating, so didn&#39;t have to<br/>
jump around targeting people.  :)<br/>

&gt; IMHO - this is a terrible flaw of EQ and needs to be rectified.  Improving<br/>
&gt; Crowd Control capabilities of Bards helped; and improving healing for<br/>
&gt; Shamans and Clerics could be another.  Perhaps there are other better ways<br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t involved &quot;nerfing&quot; clerics indirectly...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with both sides of this :-(<br/>
<br/>
I hate when I can&#39;t get a group going because we lack a cleric.  However<br/>
clerics give up a LOT to be as good at healing as they are. If you are going<br/>
to improve shaman/druid healing, clerics better get thrown a pretty big bone<br/>
too.<br/>
