<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the last lambent bp i saw auctioned was in north fp for 1300pp.  3-5k is<br/>
&gt;nuts.  now i did get all the lambent when the quests came out, but i never<br/>
&gt;used it and i traded it all (minus helm of course) last month for a runed<br/>
&gt;cowl.  wonder what you all think of that?  took me a couple days to decide<br/>
&gt;but i buckled.<br/>

&gt;&gt; The other day in Kelethin a level 6 bard twink offered to buy<br/>
&gt;&gt; every piece of<br/>
&gt;&gt; lambent armor I was wearing ( I have complete set minus 2<br/>
&gt;&gt; pieces).  He offered<br/>
&gt;&gt; me a helluva lot of money for it all.  I laughed in his face.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Told him that I<br/>
&gt;&gt; had been working on completing the quests ever since they<br/>
&gt;&gt; came out in the patch.<br/>
&gt;&gt; No way was I gonna sell it and do the quests all over again.<br/>
&gt;&gt; He bumped his<br/>
&gt;&gt; offer by 1000PP.  Put him on the /ignore list.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Last night was running through EC on my way to Solusek Temple<br/>
&gt;&gt; to complete the<br/>
&gt;&gt; lambent breastplate quest.  Someone was auctioning a lambent<br/>
&gt;&gt; breastplate for<br/>
&gt;&gt; sell.  Sent him a /tell that I was interested in knowing his<br/>
&gt;&gt; asking price.  He<br/>
&gt;&gt; said 3000-5000 PP or items of equal trade. Also told me that<br/>
&gt;&gt; he had already sold<br/>
&gt;&gt; three breastplates for that price.  I would have thought that<br/>
&gt;&gt; they sold for no<br/>
&gt;&gt; more than 1000PP.  Only cost me 270PP to buy the two rubies.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Guess these newbie<br/>
&gt;&gt; bard twinks have a lot of money to throw around.<br/>
