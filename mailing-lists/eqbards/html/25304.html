<div id="ygrps-yiv-602667132">At least on Xegony it wouldn&#39;t go for anywhere near 100pp. Probably 20pp<br/>
just for the convenience of it. COM is hunted constantly for Reavers and<br/>
such so the coins are easy to come by.<br/>

Now, the Kaesora coin - that&#39;s another story...<br/>

G&#39;day all i managed to pick up &quot;an ancient coin&quot;; from the captain of the<br/>
guard in city of mist.<br/>
My question is this: i know this is for the tambourine quest, but is this<br/>
coin worth anything to a bard.<br/>
<br/>
No i dont want to take advantage of anyone, but i need to be able to<br/>
afford next level spells as well :)<br/>
<br/>
So if this coin is worth 100pp or so, the first bard i see can have it for<br/>
free... but if it is worth anything else, then how much?<br/>
