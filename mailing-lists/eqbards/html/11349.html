&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I thought I&#39;d start this post because it&#39;s good to<br/>
&gt; &gt;see what other bards<br/>
&gt; &gt;have got inventory wise so that I know what to aim<br/>
&gt; &gt;for......<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, some of the posted lists were disgustingly good, if you ask me.  <br/>
As a semi-twink, I was getting cocky.  Took me down a peg.<br/>
<br/>
Skull Shaped Barbute, Executioner&#39;s Hood (depending on situation)<br/>
Two +3 Str Earrings<br/>
Bronze Mask<br/>
Spiked Collar<br/>
Lambent Arms<br/>
Bronze Gauntlets<br/>
Serpentine Bracer<br/>
Silver-Plated Bracer<br/>
Two +7 Dex +5 Chr rings<br/>
Crested Pauldron<br/>
Charred Guardian BP, Steel BP (depending on looks)<br/>
Lambent Boots<br/>
Bronze Cape<br/>
Troll Hide Belt<br/>
Silver-Plated Leggings<br/>
<br/>
Runed Falchion<br/>
Tainted Tier&#39;Dal Rapier<br/>
Throwing Knives<br/>
<br/>
Mistmoore Drums<br/>
Mino Horn<br/>
Mandolin, Brass Horn<br/>
<br/>
Evil Eye Bag<br/>
<br/>
Four assorted (unpaired) lambent armor components<br/>
One Lambent Ruby, one Lambent Star Ruby, 2 Star Rubies, 6 Fire Opals<br/>
450pp<br/>
A bank vault completely full of assorted trade junk<br/>
<br/>
Note:  you can have one of each Lambent [insert gem name here], which <br/>
lets you accumulate lambent stones earlier than right when you need them, <br/>
but you can only have ONE of each.  They are LORE, which I noticed to my <br/>
chagrin when two star rubies and a lambent stone vanished upon my hitting <br/>
the &quot;give&quot; button.  Sigh.<br/>

PS - You Innoruuk Bards with the Platinum Ruby Veils and the Golden Black <br/>
Pearl Chokers (you know who you are, Sylly and Harmonic) - who makes <br/>
them?  How much should I expect to pay?  Where do I go to find a Black <br/>
Pearl?</div>
