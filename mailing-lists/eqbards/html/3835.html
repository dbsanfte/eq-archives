&gt;Heh... thanks for the suggestions but here is what I have already<br/>
&gt;experienced with the following in the past....<br/>

&gt;&gt;Beatles (borer?) in north karana - I tend not to spend much time in North<br/>
&gt;Karana as those damnable griffons scare the socks off me. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I spent the time I solo&#39;ed when I was 14 and 15 in North K.  Kiting<br/>
Griffawns,<br/>
(Blue, White, Yellow, and the occasional low Red) and taking down Pincer and<br/>
Borer beetles (kite the borer&#39;s down a third before meleeing them).  The<br/>
worst problem I had, was picking up a green lion while kiting, because they<br/>
run faster than Griffawns fly, I can&#39;t kite the Griff without the lion<br/>
taking<br/>
free swings at my back.  And the lion, which would usually cost me less<br/>
than 1/2 a bubble of health to take, is impossible to take out due to the<br/>
griff breathing down my neck.  So, you end up running for the zone in those<br/>
cases.  Kiting a yellow or red griffawn is a bit tedious (and you won&#39;t find<br/>
many yellows at 16, mostly white or below) but they give GREAT exp,<br/>
big noticeable chunks.  You also get gems, runes, pages, and words from<br/>
them and runes and pages from borers<br/>
<br/>
Kiting isn&#39;t my first choice of activities, but if your on for just a while,<br/>
or<br/>
waiting for someone, so you can head to paw (like I was) then it<br/>
pays off.<br/>
