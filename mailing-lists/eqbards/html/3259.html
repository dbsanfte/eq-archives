<div id="ygrps-yiv-730039431">I am finding areas are VERY class specific as far as being fun and profitable. I am posting some of<br/>
my discoveries as I find them to encourage people to explore them before they are too easy. I have<br/>
already posted about Fire Drakes in Lavastorm, Wisps in Eruds Crossing, Aqua Goblins in Ocean of<br/>
Tears and everything Kithicor (ALWAYS a good bet for mysterious adventure, there is a bizarre hidden<br/>
story in that woods, over on Crossroads of Norath/Discussions we have a little Kithicor fan club). I<br/>
am not including loot and only the most important survival instructions so it will still be an<br/>
adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Feerot: (12-15): Get bound in the Arena, take a boat (do NOT swim) to the entrance to Rathe<br/>
Mountains (notice the gypsies you can sell your loot to when you get overloaded in the Feerot,all<br/>
the loot in this zone is HEAVY) and go from temple to temple outside Cazic-Thule. Hop inside to ask<br/>
if anyone wants to sell a Lizardscale cloak (&quot;trash loot&quot; on Rubicite carrying mob - AC 8, w 2.5, +5<br/>
dex 60-75pp) but be prepared to die if you do.<br/>
<br/>
Aviak Village, Lake Rathe: 13-14: Get bound in the Arena, everyone there is waiting on the Aviak<br/>
Guards, and the other Aviaks are free for the taking. there is a shop to the south at which you can<br/>
sell.<br/>
<br/>
Oasis(15+): Blue Camens and even blue crocs. Great exp but zero loot.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep posting these places as I find them. And I would love to hear anyone elses discoveries<br/>
of areas that matched with their level well. I STILL have to go back to the Ocean of Tears and find<br/>
more, also I only quickly swung by the Barbarian Northlands and there is SO much to discover...<br/>
