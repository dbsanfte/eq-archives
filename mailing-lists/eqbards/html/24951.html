<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421717488">Well I played a little last night in Seb and really love the new Charm&#39;s<br/>
duration. Gives you a lot more time to help bring down the first mob.<br/>
<br/>
Two more things worth mentioning:<br/>
<br/>
1) Is Mez (Pixie) sticking more for anyone else? It&#39;s sticking (just<br/>
guessing) about 50%+ for me instead of 25-33% w/ CHA at 103. I didn&#39;t time<br/>
the duration (prob the same) but just seemed a lot more effective than<br/>
pre-patch for me.<br/>
<br/>
2) Stacking problems. I haven&#39;t tried a lot of combinations, but can<br/>
confirm that SOS and Niv&#39;s don&#39;t stack anymore. I could have sworn that<br/>
that they did pre-patch, so I think this is a buffing nerf. Could someone<br/>
else confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
