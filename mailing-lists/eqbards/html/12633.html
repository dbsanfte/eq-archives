<div id="ygrps-yiv-673288235"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; With eq and<br/>
&gt;   spell buffs, you can bring your cold resist to the 120&#39;s - 150&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   for Vox.  Someone said that 125 doesn&#39;t have any impact, but 225<br/>
&gt;   does.  heh.  It&#39;s my opinion, as I have seen with every single other<br/>
&gt;   mob in this game that regardless of resistance, you are gonna be<br/>
&gt;   lucky and unlucky at times on damage.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is that so hard to believe, that 225 would make a difference where 125 does<br/>
not?  or did i read that wrong.  you&#39;re killing me, Harm!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hell, ice goblin wizards<br/>
&gt;   can still cast their stupid shock spells on me for almost<br/>
&gt;   full dmg, despite the fact I play mystic shielding.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wouldn&#39;t they be ice-based spells, where mystic shielding is MR only?  my<br/>
wiz has a frost shock spell at level 24 and an ice shock spell at 34.  i&#39;m<br/>
assuming they would cast something like that being ice goblin wizzies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m not downplaying resistances, but there is some luck factor<br/>
&gt;   involved which skews everything at times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sounds like you are =P<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;   LoD had one bard (blue to me, poorly equiped) Sagnaria (sp) and<br/>
&gt;   Weadeneye... that was it.  And your crew had their plane gear on<br/>
&gt;   from what I saw, no special cold resist stuff, yet you still <br/>
&gt;   clobbered Vox swiftly.  Level/experience is clearly better than<br/>
&gt;   resistances.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not clearly.  everyone but you thinks resistances are the most important.<br/>
otherwise all the players there would not do everything they can<br/>
equipment/spell/song wise to get both MR and CR/FR both over 200.  i dunno<br/>
what you see on these guys.  most of the items are jewelery, so you may not<br/>
see that.  but every tank at our raids has froglok crowns and gnomish<br/>
environmental suits on.  you can see those easily.  a tank with<br/>
russett/indoclite mixed with a leather tunic and no helm stands out.  come<br/>
Harm, come to the dark side.<br/>
