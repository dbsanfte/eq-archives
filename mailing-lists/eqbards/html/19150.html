<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699702731">Heh, I&#39;ve got a strong cleric, a dexterous rogue (the worst of my mistakes -<br/>
or maybe it&#39;s just that nothing helps a rogue), and a charismatic shaman.  I<br/>
used to have a really brawny Erudite wizard too.  <br/>
<br/>
But then I was talking to someone not too long ago who got their character<br/>
to level 19 before realizing what bonus points were and that he hadn&#39;t used<br/>
them at all.  So I guess I could be worse off.<br/>

&gt; Heh,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok. ok, I&#39;ll fess up.  I went back to some of my very first <br/>
&gt; characters -<br/>
&gt; ones I dropped only after a few weeks or in some cases a few hours of<br/>
&gt; playing.  When I looked at their stats, I did a OMG!!!  What was I<br/>
&gt; thinking????  Just for example, my hunam cleric has *alot* of <br/>
&gt; charisma and<br/>
&gt; some added strength.  Why?  Well, when you are hauling all <br/>
&gt; that loot back to<br/>
&gt; the merchants to get those extra good prices from the high <br/>
&gt; charisma....<br/>
&gt; seemed like a good idea at the time when all you had to go on <br/>
&gt; was what was<br/>
&gt; printed in the *stoopid*  EQ user manual.  Their character <br/>
&gt; creation sections<br/>
&gt; (to this day) really do a bad job of helping people get started.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I mostly lurk here but I really feel that I do have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; comment here.  Remember Gordon is the guy who felt<br/>
&gt; &gt; that putting points into strength for his necro was a<br/>
