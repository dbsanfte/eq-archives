<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123952880">i wish i could find it but i can&#39;t now, but what i read from a guildmember<br/>
of mine who says he spoke with some people at verant, is that all of the PoS<br/>
quest items have hidden stats that are not shown, so even though the stats<br/>
may look bad, you are far more effective wearing any PoS item than not.<br/>
i.e. even though the ranger cloak looks like crap, it can give you a 10%<br/>
boost to your defense, secretly raising it to 220.  sounds weird but just<br/>
passing that along.<br/>
<br/>
we cleared pegs and KoS last night too, dunno our plans for today though,<br/>
i&#39;m at work or with my baby while they are up there in Sky.  good luck!<br/>

&gt; Maybe the bard and cleric items won&#39;t be as crappy as the ranger ones.<br/>
