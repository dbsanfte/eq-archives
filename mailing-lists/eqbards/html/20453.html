Back in last August both these songs worked quite well.  Lullaby actually<br/>
mezzed things.  Now against high blues, whites, and yellows it is suicide.<br/>
Thanks Verant.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Kelin the dubiously talented song writer<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just who was this Kelin anyway?  Some sort of sado-masochist?<br/>
<br/>
Hello, I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while.  Now I&#39;m having a bit of a<br/>
problem figuring out what to do<br/>
with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  I know there&#39;s been a lot of discussion on the<br/>
list about this song, but<br/>
usually in relation to levels far above mine.  I&#39;ve been meaning to write<br/>
this since I got the darn song,<br/>
because I just can&#39;t figure out how to use it.<br/>
<br/>
First, my experience with Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament.  When I first got that<br/>
song it didn&#39;t work for me at<br/>
all.  Always resisted.  Consistently got mobbed.  But as I&#39;ve leveled, it&#39;s<br/>
become more useful.  I really<br/>
only try to use it on blues and I&#39;m having a very good success rate (knock<br/>
on wood).<br/>
<br/>
Then I get Lullaby and it&#39;s even worse than Lament was when I first got it<br/>
because I can&#39;t see when it<br/>
&quot;hits&quot; them -- I&#39;m just all of a sudden surrounded.  I pick a small group of<br/>
blues.  Run up and turn on<br/>
Lullaby.  Nothing.  No &quot;resist&quot; message.  No &quot;sleepy/whatever&quot; message.<br/>
Then they&#39;re all wailing away on<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone tell me if I&#39;m doing something wrong or if this song just really<br/>
sucks that bad?  Should I<br/>
wait a couple (more) levels to start trying to use it?  But then I thought I<br/>
recalled from previous<br/>
discussion that it&#39;s completely useless after level 24? or 27?  So why<br/>
bother for just a few levels of<br/>
use?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice.<br/>

<br/>
p.s.  If I ever run into that Kelin I&#39;m going to have to give him a piece of<br/>
my mind.  Or maybe my foot --<br/>
soundly on the butt.<br/>
