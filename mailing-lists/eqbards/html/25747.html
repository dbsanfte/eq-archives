<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970228854">The undead bard DID spawn again and shortly after, so did the regular Trakanon. Another guild beat us there to kill him so I am once again waiting for an undead bard spawn. <br/>
For those of you interested in hitting Sebilis, I recommend going right after you scribe song of twilight because your group WILL expect you to mezz and I have found this song far superior to Charm in dungeons (and pixie strike is resisted too much).  There is an issue with Sebilis though -- that is getting out again.  It stinks that your group will have to clear a path to the portal when you have to leave.<br/>
My solution is the gate hammer quest in the Overthere.  I used my deciever mask to do the quest:<br/>
Give the foreman a piece of jade to stick in his eye socket (or somesuch place P) and he&#39;ll reward you with a hammer that procs gate to the Overthere.  You&#39;ll materialize in the shipyard -- inside the ship being built.  You&#39;ll need mezz to stop the Skele that will immediately attack you.  Throw on the drum, right click your mask and beat feet.<br/>
If you haven&#39;t been to Sebilis, I highly recommend it.  You&#39;ll meet some of the best players in the game there, and the loot/xp are great.  Just bring that hammer or a gate potion)<br/>

<br/>
If this is true, the seemingly random spawn times seem to come from <br/>
people not knowing when he actually died last (i.e. most of the time <br/>
that knowing precisely when Trakanon spawns) and relating his spawn <br/>
time to Trak&#39;s death, not the Undead Bards.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the server pops and both Trak and UDB spawn.  Trak kills <br/>
UDB.  20 hours from that point, if Trak is dead, the UDB will spawn <br/>
and stay up.  If Trak dies 18 hours after server pop, the UDB will be <br/>
up in 2 hours.  If Trak dies 21 hours after server pop, the UDB will <br/>
be up in 19 hours (he&#39;d already spawned and was whacked by Trak once).<br/>
