<div id="ygrps-yiv-147533598">I had the same blank-wall experience in Unrest a few<br/>
levels ago and boy was I confused.  I died though and<br/>
of course could not find my corpse despite use of<br/>
locating song and a wand.  Another friend came in to<br/>
help me look the next day and still no joy.  A GM came<br/>
to help me (after 2 petitions and a phone call to<br/>
Verant).  He walks in and says: your corpse is right<br/>
there.  Doh!  2nd zone in perhaps as has been<br/>
discussed here before for invisible corpses.  I stood<br/>
there sputtering &quot;But, but, it wasn&#39;t there before! <br/>
Really!&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the topic of strange bugs, here is an amusing<br/>
&gt; one:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are familiar with the Unrest Zone, you are<br/>
&gt; aware of how you run down<br/>
&gt; the twisty tunnel between Cauldron and Unrest and<br/>
&gt; the zone point is in the<br/>
&gt; tunnel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was standing just around the second turn in the<br/>
&gt; tunnel in Unrest having<br/>
&gt; just zoned in and heading for the courtyard when<br/>
&gt; someone yelled &quot;train to<br/>
&gt; zone!&quot; so I stopped and waited.  Around the next<br/>
&gt; corner came 2 tentacle<br/>
&gt; terrors and one of them ran straight at me, hit me<br/>
&gt; with that special attack<br/>
&gt; they have and threw me against the wall toward the<br/>
&gt; direction I had come<br/>
&gt; from.  The I regained my bearings and it hit me<br/>
&gt; again, threw me down the<br/>
&gt; tunnel against another wall and came charging at me<br/>
&gt; for another go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I decide now is a good time to turn tail and run,<br/>
&gt; zone to safety and wait<br/>
&gt; out the chaos - so I turn the next corner and there<br/>
&gt; is a dead end...no<br/>
&gt; zone...a flat wall in front of me!  I get smacked by<br/>
&gt; the tentacles again,<br/>
&gt; and again up against the wall and realize in a split<br/>
&gt; second that they<br/>
&gt; knocked me PAST the zone point so I had to turn<br/>
&gt; around and head the opposite<br/>
&gt; direction back INTO unrest and as I rounded the<br/>
&gt; corner I zoned into Cauldron<br/>
&gt; with 2 bubbles of health.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Crazy place...awful fun though ;-)<br/>
