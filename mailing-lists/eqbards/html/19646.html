 </span></blockquote>Right, we accounted for that, he gated (which in FV is a &quot;loading please<br/>
wait&quot; op) and I zoned. Everything was fine for a while, then, with no<br/>
particular good reason (we hadn&#39;t let a runner go for instance) I became the<br/>
hot topic of the Drachnid public&#39;s venomous malintent.When they came, they<br/>
came to me. Now part of that *might* be that I was singing Clarity when they<br/>
arrived, which I have been noticing is a fairly big taunt for incoming mobs<br/>
(as is Selos, other buffs seem less so). However, he was next to me on the<br/>
beach, at about the limit of pulse range and their vector was for *me* even<br/>
from outside pulse range.<br/>
That is about all the data I have, it&#39;s not great data, but I am convinced<br/>
it is describing a real effect. I was charming at the Giant fort last week<br/>
without the fort-wide hate effect, then Saturday night (after being out of<br/>
town a few days) it started happening. We shall see, maybe it will happen to<br/>
someone with more cycles to test it.<br/>
