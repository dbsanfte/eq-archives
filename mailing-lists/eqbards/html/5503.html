<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364810658">Well, you are right, this was too dangerous for you I think.  A good idea<br/>
would be a /who all for bards 16th and over.  With the water-breathing song<br/>
this would be fairly easy and I have done corpse recoveries in the depths of<br/>
the Ocean of Tears in thi fashion.  It would cost the guy something as it is<br/>
stil a major endeavor, but if he hasn&#39;t gotten his corpse yet you might want<br/>
to suggest this.<br/>
I am on E&#39;ci or I would gladly help out as I am on my way to Erudin anyhow.<br/>

I was spending time on Erud&#39;s Crossing last night.  I&#39;m level 15, nearing 16<br/>
and the wisps are still slow experience and pretty good money for me.<br/>
Anyhow...<br/>
<br/>
There is normally anywhere from 1 to 14 people in that zone (it&#39;s spooky<br/>
seeing only yourself in a /w), and it&#39;s a pretty small island so you come to<br/>
&quot;know&quot; the others that are there and share wisp rotation, etc.  Last night<br/>
about midnight a guy that I&#39;d been playing alongside for hours (but don&#39;t<br/>
have<br/>
any long-term association with) gets killed by the Kerran Cat on the docks..<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what all happened but he claimed that the cat woman killed him<br/>
while he was on the boat.  I never did see how that was possible, but I<br/>
digress.  When he comes back onto the island from Qeynos he /tells me asking<br/>
for a corpse location.  I had done this a couple of times for others on the<br/>
island (always for free), as sometimes your corpse ends up offshore when<br/>
fighting the zombie sailors.  Anyhow, I say &quot;sure, I&#39;ll find it for you.&quot;,<br/>
meet up with him on the dock, target him and &quot;Wow...  I&#39;m pointing offshore<br/>
here...&quot;  Blah, blah, yeah cat killed me on boat, blah blah...  Ok...<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s<br/>
find out how far offshore you are by triangulation.&quot;  I start to move up and<br/>
down the beach now to see how my angle changes as I move.  &quot;Why the hell are<br/>
you running back and forth up the beach?  I thought you were going to help<br/>
me<br/>
find my corpse!?!?!  What&#39;s tringlation?&quot;  Sigh...  Explain.  &quot;Oh kewl.&quot;<br/>
Unfortunately my angle isn&#39;t changing much as I run up and down the beach.<br/>
His corpse is *way* offshore - and it gets seriously deep out there - after<br/>
you swim past the sharks.  &quot;Oh, I died on the boat and I&#39;ll bet my corpse<br/>
fell<br/>
off when it hit the zone border.&quot;  Ok, sounds plausible.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s in<br/>
that<br/>
direction.  Good luck.&quot;  I say.  &quot;Wait!  I need for you to go with me and<br/>
point at my corpse.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whoah now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m standing on this island with full banded armor, spiked collar, rusty<br/>
spiked shoulders, snakeskin mask, misc. magic jewelry, 80pp in cash, a<br/>
Dragood<br/>
Dirk, a Tentacle Whip, A Combine long sword and three backpacks with various<br/>
lighstones in them.  So I, as politely as I can, say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;d really<br/>
like to help you, but most of the valuable items I own are on my person and<br/>
I<br/>
don&#39;t like the thought of putting myself into a position where my corpse<br/>
might<br/>
be permanently irretrievable.&quot;  So he replies &quot;Oh PLEASE!  You have to help<br/>
me!  All of my stuff is on that corpse!&quot;  I say &quot;Yes, but assuming we get<br/>
past<br/>
the sharks, what if we hit the zone and zone into Erudin?  How can we be<br/>
sure<br/>
that we can zone back in this direction?&quot;,  &quot;Oh I&#39;m sure we could!  Or we<br/>
could follow a boat to Erudin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nope.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I saw this guy he was understandably upset, but swimming<br/>
offshore to look for his corpse in the direction that I gave him.  Believe<br/>
me<br/>
I wished him well, but I couldn&#39;t put my character in that potentially<br/>
disarterous position.<br/>
<br/>
How would others have handled this situation?  Given it&#39;s midnight, and you<br/>
plan on logging within an hour or so and there&#39;s no bank on the island.<br/>
<br/>
Do others have experiences where players feel like just because we can<br/>
located<br/>
we&#39;re somehow *obligated* to do so regardless of the circumstances or<br/>
dangers?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering.<br/>
