<div id="ygrps-yiv-50922373">Hmmm, bards have the rep for being monster magnets.  But you prolly need to<br/>
play your songs no matter what  but not AE (Area Effect).  You dint say<br/>
zactly how young you are but the gnolls will go agro on people they see that<br/>
look tasty to them.  they can tell how young you are and will attack you if<br/>
they think they can win. As you get older they get smarter and if they are<br/>
trival to you they don&#39;t attack.  Unless of course their friends have<br/>
whipped them in to a frenzy and they are trying to help - ie you have<br/>
started a train.<br/>
<br/>
Selos is not an area effect on NPC&#39;s so it should not matter.  But if one of<br/>
your party had attacked that gnoll and gotten on its hate list - then when<br/>
it comes up and see you helping the party - it gets mad at you and attacks.<br/>
<br/>
If you play an aera effect - like chords in a place like BB - that&#39;s very<br/>
high traffic and multi- level - you will get a LOT of attention real<br/>
quick!!!  So don&#39;t play AE songs in dungeons - as a rule.<br/>

		Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
		As a young bard who&#39;s had her fill of lurking around here, I<br/>
thought<br/>
		I&#39;d venture forth and ask a really simple question!<br/>
<br/>
		I&#39;ve just returned home from a long long trip to Black<br/>
Burrow where<br/>
		all the gnolls hang out.  Boy was it dangerous!!!<br/>
<br/>
		Anyway, when sitting down with my group while all the spell<br/>
chuckers<br/>
		recovered from their oh so hard zapping, playing a nice tune<br/>
just in<br/>
		case we needed to run for the exit, it didn&#39;t take long for<br/>
the<br/>
		nearest gnoll to suddenly turn and jump on me.  Not the<br/>
meditating<br/>
		high elves oh no, ignore everyone else and straight for<br/>
little old me.<br/>
<br/>
		So what I&#39;m asking is ..... were they just offended by the<br/>
slightly<br/>
		different interpretation I placed on Selo&#39;s, or do I have<br/>
some sort of<br/>
		bad guy magnet attached to me!  I deliberately avoided my<br/>
hymn of<br/>
		restoration because I&#39;d heard they really don&#39;t like you<br/>
helping<br/>
		people, but does this hatred run to any kind of song<br/>
disturbing their<br/>
		clearly very peaceful home?<br/>
<br/>
		Oh, and if a nice friendly L24 and up bard is hanging out<br/>
here who<br/>
		donated a bronze helmet to a rather under-dressed me at the<br/>
docks in<br/>
		Butcherblock a couple of weeks ago, can I just say thank you<br/>
very<br/>
		much, it&#39;s saved my life on a number of occasions :)<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks everyone, see ya out there!<br/>
