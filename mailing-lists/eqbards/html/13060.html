<b>Subject:</b> I fought the Drag.. The drag won <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229874192">Hello all,<br/>
    Went on my first dragon raid tonight. Well it didn&#39;t go well, we had a <br/>
good plan and high hopes. But to no avale we got wrecked like it was our job. <br/>
 Got in a group with 3 tanks , 2 clerics , and me. we ran in , got under nags <br/>
. I played Guard/ Elem like i learned on this list. Well , my connection <br/>
craps out. i Die , everyone else gets nailed, but not before almost killin <br/>
the damned thing. So it was disappointing but not too bad. .....but it ain&#39;t <br/>
over for this bard. I run back to solb , and join lots of naked adventurers <br/>
impatient to get back to their corpses. we walked to the bat room and wait <br/>
for a bit. Some jackass jumps the gun and pulls a full stone room.  I try to <br/>
fear to save lives. and i did ...except my own. back in Freeport I sit on my <br/>
duff and wonder if i should continue or not, i decided to wait and see. A <br/>
minute later i am being ressed by a lvl 50 and i get most of my exp back. I <br/>
get my hope renewed and decide to stick it out, i mean i have a couple of <br/>
hours to get that other corpse res&#39;d. Well, we spend like an hour while <br/>
people try to drag corpses from under nags, then a while trying to reorganize <br/>
and regroup. &lt;&lt;Mind you there are still a bunch of corpses unrecovered.&gt;&gt; <br/>
Before i know it , people start dropping like fly&#39;s , gating , going to bed, <br/>
etc...   I&#39;m tired so i decide to get a druid gate me and a 50 cleric to lava <br/>
, go to solb and get my other res. We go back , and my corpse is gone! Now <br/>
here&#39;s the real kicker, I&#39;m lvl 46 . I lost a bub and a half of exp in all ! <br/>
And with the hours i can play and zones so overcrowded , getting that exp <br/>
back will be like going through 45. This story really has no point. I just <br/>
wanted to vent. I&#39;m going to get 47 by next week &lt;&lt; I hope &gt;&gt;  and also i&#39;ll <br/>
have a better connection. So I haven&#39;t given up, just beat down hehe.... Feel <br/>
free to comment . <br/>
