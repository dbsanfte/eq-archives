<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821205380">Heh..yeah, I tend to make that assumption.  Dunno how accurate (or<br/>
inaccurate) that assumption is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll just make a macro:<br/>
/w all bard count<br/>
/w all darkfox<br/>
<br/>
...and do the math accordingly.  Hehee!<br/>
<br/>
Shoot me a tell sometime, if ya want.  If you&#39;re around level 30, I&#39;d love<br/>
to group.  I&#39;ve always wanted to have another bard in the group that knew<br/>
enough about the songs and how to twist to coordinate a 6 song crescendo of<br/>
power that NONE CAN WITHSTAND..MWHAHAHAHAA!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sorry...heh...I&#39;ve grouped with bards from time to time, and I can see<br/>
where a lot of the misconceptions and plain ignorance comes from.  Even had<br/>
one, no matter how many times we &quot;agreed&quot; on what songs we&#39;d play, he&#39;d end<br/>
up playing hymn and anthem only...anthem when fighting, hymn when not.<br/>

Possibly, but you&#39;re assuming that the only reason someone will go <br/>
anon/roleplay is to avoid people asking them for the services that <br/>
their class can provide.  It&#39;s not the only reason present and it&#39;s <br/>
hard to say if it&#39;s the most common reason or not.  Many Hate/Fear <br/>
raids, for example, ask that everyone goes Anon/RP so they don&#39;t get <br/>
raid crashers. i.e. People would do a /w all 50 55 and if a lot of <br/>
people showed up in Hate, then they&#39;d know it was safe to port up.<br/>
<br/>
And, btw, that 74 count on Xegony more than likely missed me, since I <br/>
usually play during primetime and have been on Roleplay since they <br/>
introduced the ability.  It&#39;s all those damn stalkers. :)<br/>
