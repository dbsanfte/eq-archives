<div id="ygrps-yiv-216882239">I think it&#39;s clear from the contradictory posts here that a lot of people<br/>
HAVE put thought into this and don&#39;t agree that 400 damage is appropriate<br/>
for the mobs that higher level bards would feel.  Also a desire for a single<br/>
targeted spell as opposed to targeted AOE...<br/>

possible ways<br/>
that it is useful?<br/>
<br/>
30 seconds of &#39;&#39;cost&#39;&#39; time to get 400+ damage every 30 minutes or so seems<br/>
fairly useful to me.<br/>
