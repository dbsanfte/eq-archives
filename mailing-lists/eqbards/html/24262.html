<div id="ygrps-yiv-216882239">I think it&#39;s clear from the contradictory posts here that a lot of people<br/>
HAVE put thought into this and don&#39;t agree that 400 damage is appropriate<br/>

<br/>
30 seconds of &#39;&#39;cost&#39;&#39; time to get 400+ damage every 30 minutes or so seems<br/>
fairly useful to me.<br/>
