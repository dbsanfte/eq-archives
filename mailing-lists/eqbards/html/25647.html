<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187610019">Yes, it starts earlier but I think 50+ is when it becomes most<br/>
noticeable.   The person I was replying to said he was level 32.  You<br/>
are at 46 (almost) so your bonus will be a lot more noticeable, but<br/>
still Sainy&#39;s Claw has a pretty inferior ratio even if it is fast.  Most<br/>
who use it only place it in secondary hand for its AC.<br/>

By higher, do you mean 50+, or is there significant bonuses in the mid<br/>
40&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ve got a Symphonic Saber (11/23), and a Sarnak Skullsplitter<br/>
(12/26).<br/>
I&#39;ve switched them between hands, and really don&#39;t see a whole lot of<br/>
difference, except the SS proc, which my will is insufficient<br/>
for...hehe.<br/>
Just to try it, I put Sainy&#39;s Claw (6/19) in primary, and Symphonic<br/>
Saber in<br/>
secondary, and it took roughly half again as long to kill stuff as with<br/>
the<br/>
Symphonic Saber and Sarnak Skullsplitter equipped (I judged by how far a<br/>
feared sabertooth tiger was able to run when there were little to no<br/>
resists<br/>
to chains or fear).  Hardly scientific, I know, but I&#39;ve been more<br/>
involved<br/>
with making the xp bar move, than anything else.  :)<br/>
