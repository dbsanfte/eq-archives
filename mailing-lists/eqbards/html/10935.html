<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487273243">Ok, people time to get organized like those monks on fennin ro!  The one<br/>
time monks get nerfed they get a two-page apology in the patch news the next<br/>
day, we get nerfed nearly weekly and get squat.<br/>
<br/>
I would urge every single bard, regardless of level to /bug the new Levitate<br/>
results and /Feedback them as well every single time you log on to play.<br/>
Maybe several hundred /bugs and /feedbacks will get their F&%@in&#39; attention.<br/>
If not we should plan a Bard sit in like the monks had and see if a 50&#39;<br/>
gnome shows up for that.  If he doesn&#39;t its just one more thing we can throw<br/>
in their faces to prove that no one at Verant gives a Flotsam&#39;s A$$ about<br/>
bards and we are sick of it.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t going to play tonite much do to having a hockey game, but I&#39;ll make<br/>
sure to get on just to /bug the new levitate issue.  Let&#39;s see some<br/>
solidarity out there!!!<br/>

  Once you are levitating, the song will not take hold.  You have<br/>
  to fall first, before the next pulse will reactivate it.<br/>
<br/>
  Otherwise, yes, you get the:  You are already floating   message.<br/>
<br/>
  The song no longer refreshed itself, wtf wasnt that change in the<br/>
  patch message?  Because it&#39;s a nerf, that&#39;s why =)  This does not<br/>
  impact casters whatsoever, it&#39;s aimed at bard&#39;s who can levitate<br/>
  continously higher and higher.  I bet some plat thats the reason.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.<br/>
