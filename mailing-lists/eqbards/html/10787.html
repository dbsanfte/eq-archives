<b>Subject:</b> RE: Cazic-Thule: A recommendation <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-989735704">Sylly?  Are we talking about Cazic-Thule?  The place with all the green<br/>
lizard guys?  Where rubicite used to drop?<br/>
<br/>
The only thing in there that sees invis is the gators (wtf?) and probably<br/>
the Avatar.  There ain&#39;t no lizards what see invis.  I&#39;ve walked right up to<br/>
the throne with Tae Ew Templar sittin&#39; on top and just stood there while<br/>
invised when they were black/white to me.  Now maybe this has *changed* at<br/>
some point, but CT has always worked that way for me.  I zone in, get a soft<br/>
mist to surround me and then jog through the maze and up to the top of the<br/>
temple.  I do this all the time, bumping into Heralds, Judicators,<br/>
Justicars, etc. all the way up.  They don&#39;t see me or I&#39;d know about it.<br/>
<br/>
And something that bears mentioning: Another thread has talked about how<br/>
relatively easy it is to get Shin Greaves and Gauntlets from Lower Guk at a<br/>
level too low to fight there, and that&#39;s true.  However, those that haven&#39;t<br/>
been to Lower Guk need to be warned that invis doesn&#39;t work against the<br/>
frogs down there, it only lets you get there through Upper Guk safely.  I<br/>
just wanted that to be clear.<br/>

&gt; Invis inside CT?  You got to be joking! &lt;g&gt; Every time I try the<br/>
&gt; maze, some<br/>
&gt; freaking caster froggy has see invis and beats on me.  If I don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; caster & tank with me to beat it down, I am done for.   And I have never<br/>
&gt; done a nekkid run inside CT.  But I have done lots and lots of<br/>
&gt; looting after<br/>
&gt; getting rezzed behind the tree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess the different tactics come from the differences in our groups.  My<br/>
&gt; CT time was spent with my regular group: cleric/wiz, sk/wiz, troll war,<br/>
&gt; ench/necro & me - bard.  These are all players I have literally grown up<br/>
&gt; with -- from level one in a couple cases.  Consent them to loot<br/>
&gt; me? I wish I<br/>
&gt; could make it permanent command.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. I am sorely tempted to go back and learn that damn maze.<br/>
&gt; There has to<br/>
&gt; be a trick to it and I feel like I am missing something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s.s. if you are not seeing Specs in Feer it&#39;s cuz you stay close to that<br/>
&gt; wall as you run past the spec cave.  or you don&#39;t have many lev 45<br/>
&gt; enchanters who are soloing them.  I know I have spend many hours with my<br/>
&gt; enchanter fiend. she pulls - yes from the cave - yes you can<br/>
&gt; easily get 3 in<br/>
&gt; which case she will mez then charm.  when there is only one, I chain it -<br/>
&gt; she fears it - I beat on it and she nukes it or dot&#39;s it - whatever off<br/>
&gt; ench&#39;s have and I chain and melee while its feared.<br/>

&gt; 		You&#39;re joking, right?  The flute is for getting to your<br/>
&gt; corpse inside Cazic<br/>
&gt; 		going through the maze and up to the Archon or back to the<br/>
&gt; mud temple, it<br/>
&gt; 		never occurred to me to use it in Feerrott.  A plain-vanilla<br/>
&gt; skelly at the<br/>
&gt; 		zone?  If I&#39;m bard enough to be fighting in Cazic, why on<br/>
&gt; earth would I<br/>
&gt; 		waste my time killing that?  Afraid of a Bouncer with<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s?  Heck I<br/>
&gt; 		routinely smack the Bouncer when he comes up to the CT zone<br/>
&gt; and run him back<br/>
&gt; 		out into the Feerrott so that he doesn&#39;t kill half the folks<br/>
&gt; resting at the<br/>
&gt; 		zone.  As for Spectres - yeah I seem them once in a while<br/>
&gt; but I just veer<br/>
&gt; 		around them; they&#39;ve never killed me.  You&#39;re just about as<br/>
&gt; likely to hit a<br/>
&gt; 		spec in Oasis nowadays with the folks trying to kill them<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 		But as I said, I think the Freeport/Arena thing is pretty<br/>
&gt; much a wash to<br/>
&gt; 		Cazic unless you&#39;re very familiar with the trip from Arena,<br/>
&gt; in which case<br/>
&gt; 		it&#39;s a bit faster.<br/>
