<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Singing Steel missing pieces <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803816027">I&#39;m thinking the same thing. All our Karnor&#39;s pieces exist so far. Yet not one Sebilis piece has shown up.<br/>
If even one piece from Sebilis were to be discovered, I could accept the fact that the other 2 Sebilis<br/>
pieces also exist, but this isnt so.<br/>
Bards are often overlooked, so this wouldnt surprise me. I suggest sending an email to Abashi<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gwrinn@...">gwrinn@...</a>) and perhaps he cant forward it to the Live Team to doublecheck.<br/>

&gt; set of legs (on any server) because we were able to kill venril sathir<br/>
&gt; before he was buffed incredibly (apparently he is a quest npc and not to be<br/>
&gt; killed), and now his loot table is most likely empty.  so we have gloves and<br/>
&gt; boots.  every other class with kunark armor has found one or all of the<br/>
&gt; following, and this includes druid, ranger, shadow knight, paladin, warrior,<br/>
&gt; rogue, shaman, cleric: arms, helm, bracer.  none of these have been found in<br/>
&gt; singing steel.  i refuse to believe they have not been found yet.  every<br/>
&gt; other class with armor in kunark has found these pieces!  maybe bards get<br/>
&gt; lucky and our pieces are so incredible they are found only in veeshan&#39;s peak<br/>
&gt; (laugh).  so what i think is that once again, like imbrued armor in hate,<br/>
&gt; bard armor has been forgotten to be placed in kunark.  anyone who is more<br/>
&gt; familiar and versed want to ask on the gameplay forum?  or am i wrong?<br/>
