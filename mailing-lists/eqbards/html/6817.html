 </span></blockquote>Sit right down and you&#39;ll hear a tale..<br/>
<br/>
I had a level 9 cleric & grouped with a level 10<br/>
wizard and a level 9 wizard (this is on Veeshan<br/>
also). &quot;So what are you hunting&quot; they ask. &quot;Scarabs<br/>
and Tara&#39;s would be good for us&quot; I reply. &quot;Ok,<br/>
I&#39;ll lead&quot; one of them says after I buff them with<br/>
my mini-buffs. Off to the ruins Derv<br/>
camp they run. &quot;Hey, there&#39;s only one derv in the<br/>
camp, let&#39;s get it before the others spawn!&quot; one<br/>
of them says.. I look at said derv. Euridite Caster.<br/>
I con said derv. Blood boiling red. &quot;Um, it&#39;s red<br/>
to me and it&#39;s a caster. I&#39;d rather not.&quot; I say.<br/>
&quot;Ok, who wants to pull?&quot; they ask. &quot;We&#39;re all going<br/>
to die&quot; I think to myself. Before I can say anything<br/>
else, I see a fireball flying towards said derv<br/>
caster. At this point I honestly think I heard<br/>
laughter coming from the derv. *BOOM* Wizard number<br/>
one is at half health. The other wizard casts a<br/>
spell. I decide I may as well do my part since we&#39;re<br/>
here.. I cast a spell.. &quot;Your target has resisted<br/>
your Furor spell!&quot; Doh! Again this happens. I turn<br/>
to healing my group members who, after two more casts<br/>
by the Derv are at 1/4 health each. &quot;RUN!&quot; they say.<br/>
Wow, the first intelligent decision I&#39;ve heard.<br/>
Divine Aura on, boots start walkin&#39;.. Wizard one goes<br/>
off the radar. Wizard two goes off the radar. Cleric<br/>
with brain enters tunnel with full health. I waddle to<br/>
the e.commons zone to get myself out of the derv&#39;s<br/>
mind. I come back and wait at the platform meditating<br/>
what little mana a level 9 cleric gets that I&#39;d spent<br/>
on healing them and using DA. Wizard number two comes<br/>
back to n.ro zone (see him on group list). I&#39;m waiting..<br/>
Waiting.. Wizard number two&#39;s health starts going<br/>
down. I stand, look around.. nope. Not here. Wizard<br/>
two dies. Not a word said to the group as to where he<br/>
was to give him help.<br/>
<br/>
Wizard one /tell&#39;s me.. &quot;Hey, why did you disband?&quot; I<br/>
reply that &quot;I&#39;m going to move on. Do some travelling I<br/>
think.&quot; Wizard one /tell&#39;s me.. &quot;Aw man, we really need<br/>
you!&quot; I don&#39;t reply. You can guess what I was thinking<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s how I get out of bad groups. If you&#39;re<br/>
not wanting to be in a group with the people because<br/>
they&#39;re a bad group, you really shouldn&#39;t worry about<br/>
what they think of you because you&#39;re not going to be<br/>
looking for them again anytime in the near future.</div>
