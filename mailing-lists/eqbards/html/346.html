 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve tried many weapons, but I understand your concern.  A<br/>
minotaur axe looks good in the hand of, say, a dwarf warrior, but I agree<br/>
it looks a bit out of place next to a lute.  For a short time at the<br/>
beginning of my career I carried an axe, but gave over to a bastard sword.<br/>
It is a bit heavier and slower than a long sword, but cuts a bit deeper,<br/>
and personally I find it a suitable compromise between a bard&#39;s proper<br/>
finesse and brute force.<br/>
<br/>
Although its piercing style may not come so naturally and I can&#39;t say how<br/>
effective it would be overall, I can also imagine a bard looking quite<br/>
dashing with a rapier.<br/>
<br/>
One could extend this discussion to armor as well.  If a bard is strong<br/>
enough full plate, for example, may be within the realm of possibility but<br/>
would look, in my opinion, rather odd on a bard.  Image counts when one is<br/>
always in some degree an entertainer.<br/>
