<div id="ygrps-yiv-932022283">There are a variety of websites around with extremelly good information<br/>
about all the lands of Norrath.  Including maps, would have proved very<br/>
beneficial to myself.  One of my favorites is gameznet.com/eq.  There is<br/>
spoiler information there, so be cautious if you are against that, but there<br/>
is a plethora of information there.  I know it is more fun to ask and talk<br/>
about adventures, but if you&#39;re ever in a pinch, and if you ever log out of<br/>
EQ &lt;grin&gt; check out some of the sites.  : )<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a great discussion board... we&#39;ve discussed<br/>
&gt;songs, effects, and bardic life...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;but now, I wanna ask a few new general questions... What is there to hunt?<br/>
&gt;Where should I go?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a level 14 bard and have spent most of my life in<br/>
&gt;the Freeport-commonlands-Nro-oasis area...  don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;me wrong, there is some great hunting there and I have<br/>
&gt;made many friends... but I want adventure and<br/>
&gt;excitment ;)  I&#39;ve done some wandering on my own and<br/>
&gt;traveling, but I usually get really lost or reallydead... both not too<br/>
&gt;good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I ask all wise bards from other areas to give me some<br/>
&gt;advice... what&#39;s out there?  How do I get to those<br/>
&gt;areas that have cool stuff, like spiked collars and<br/>
&gt;bronze armor, etc...  Anything cool out at Qeynos or<br/>
&gt;Halas?  I&#39;ve been to Kelethin and crushbone, but the<br/>
&gt;huntings kinda slim, and very crowded ;)  Lately I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;been cutting down on my random adventures because I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;too scared to die and lose my body in a place meant<br/>
&gt;for levels 40+  Where are these elementals to fight?<br/>
&gt;What&#39;s in the Lavastorm mountains?  anything to hunt<br/>
&gt;near erudin?  Where are the dragons? (even though I<br/>
&gt;probably wanna stay away from that)  How do people<br/>
&gt;keep leveling up so high?  All those beta people know<br/>
&gt;all the areas, I have no idea...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Forgive my ramblings, I just want to see the worldsemi-safely...<br/>
