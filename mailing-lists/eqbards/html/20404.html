<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-124671535">It is not just you, Tani, fear has more misses per level than any other<br/>
song I know.  The way to combat this is to max your brass skill.  This is<br/>
long and boring, so I reccomend doing something like leaving your bard in<br/>
the non-PvP area of Lake Rathe overnight, singing Denon&#39;s (the only real<br/>
brass song you have).  By the next morning, your brass skill should be<br/>
high enough to considerably reduce failures.  Be careful anywhere<br/>
else--you want somewhere with no mobs that might wander close enough, and<br/>
avoid the normal PvP areas, as there are lots of idiotic little juveniles<br/>
who will blast your bard&#39;s buitt while you are gone, just to have done it<br/>
(heh, ask me--I almost lost a corpse for having been on-line nearly 24<br/>
hours after a moronic little caster actually beat me to death with his<br/>
big wooden stick while I tried this in FP arena--he was enough lower that<br/>
his spells would not even stick!)<br/>
<br/>
As for uses, there are two ways I use this.  The first is along with<br/>
chains--you chain/fear/chain/fear (rinse repeat) while you and/or your<br/>
party cast and hack at its back.  This only really works in wide-open<br/>
places, obviously.  The second is as a get-out-of-jail-free card.  When<br/>
you get stuck in a really bad situation (say you are in a dungeon and no<br/>
one can get the mobs off the druid/wizzie long enough for them to cast<br/>
evac), you sing fear, the mobs go flying away, and you have just enough<br/>
time to affect your escape.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
