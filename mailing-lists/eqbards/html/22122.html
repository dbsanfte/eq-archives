Another lesson learned is to set your default to Run.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a wood elf bard who worships Bristlebane.  With DE illusion up and<br/>
&gt; Carrilion, I can get my faction to amiable in the evil outpost, allowing<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; to bank and trade there.  However, I still died there over the weekend.  I<br/>
&gt; was turning in 4 sarnak war braids to the undead captain when I went<br/>
&gt; linkdead.  I knew I would be in trouble when I logged back in (why do<br/>
&gt; illusions disappear when you go LD but standard buffs remain in effect?).<br/>
&gt; As soon as I logged in, I started heading for the countryside.  I got<br/>
Selos<br/>
&gt; up but realized I forgot to toggle Run.  So next thing I know the General<br/>
&gt; and his dragoon goons were whipping up on me.  I might have lasted a total<br/>
&gt; of 10 seconds from the time I logged in to the time I died.  Fortunatly I<br/>
&gt; got far enough away that I could get to my corpse with the invis song up<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; not have to worry about getting close to the dragoons.  So lesson learned<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t bank/trade in evil outpost if your connection is suspect.<br/>

&gt; I just got my Mask of Deception (yeah yeah I know..I should have had this<br/>
&gt; thing 15 levels ago) and the evil Dragoons in The Overthere still are<br/>
&gt; scowling ready to attack when I am a Delf.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a half-elf Bard, Quellious is my Diety.  Is there any way to use the<br/>
&gt; Charismatic Carrilion (sp?) to up faction enough to turn in the braids for<br/>
&gt; faction increases?<br/>
