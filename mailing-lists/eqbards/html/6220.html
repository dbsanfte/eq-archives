<b>Subject:</b> Re: DoT exp loss (was: Instruments vs. melee quandry) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-579620126">I believe as of the last patch that exp loss due to player DoT has changed.<br/>
. . probably some how in conjunction with them &#39;fixing&#39; the DoT bug (that I<br/>
hear is still not completely fixed). . . . anyway, while I haven&#39;t tested<br/>
it, the lastest word is that when a player dies from another player&#39;s DoT,<br/>
it does not result in an exp loss.<br/>

p.s. I&#39;d wish I could give you more hard info on the DoT&#39;s but ever since<br/>
15th level or so, I haven&#39;t been able to stop playing my bard. =)<br/>

&gt;Ouch.  DDD and CoD are DoTs.  If they work like other DoTs and<br/>
&gt;end up killing your friend while dueling, the game will<br/>
&gt;consider it a DoT kill and not a duel kill, and they will lose<br/>
&gt;experience.  Be careful when doing this folks!  Maybe some of<br/>
&gt;you L2-5 folks may want to test it for us with CoD.<br/>
