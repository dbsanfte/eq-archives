<div id="ygrps-yiv-448418476">I noticed this also, being a woodelf bard my forage raised to 51. I am very<br/>
pleased as I have got into a habit of pressing forage all the time, the<br/>
higher the skill the more food I&#39;m gonna have  =)<br/>
I only managed to raise the skill to 51 so not sure what it caps at, I&#39;m<br/>
hoping something like 75-80 (100 would be nice). I wonder now if they<br/>
raised any other skill caps in yesterdays patch.<br/>

Ps, Lost a roll on a sash last night, out of the classes that were in the<br/>
group (bard, ranger, monk, wizard, cleric and druid). The wizard won<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;. I rolled a lousy 23 and the wizard got 83.<br/>

Hey all!  Good news for those us who like the Forage skill!  I was happily<br/>
running along today hitting my forage button as I always do, when I go the<br/>
message: You have become better at Forage (41).  Yippeee.  They have raised<br/>
the skill cap on forage.  I had to log out before I found out what the max<br/>
was, but I thought I&#39;d pass that along to you all.<br/>
