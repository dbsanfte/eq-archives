<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604822596">Wow This sounds so much like me. Galtin!!<br/>
I have been playing Musiker the woodelf bard since day one Bertox was made (Even<br/>
played in beta, so I dident fool much around with classes)<br/>
He is now 27th level and the only other char I have played above level 4 is a<br/>
level 10 troll SK (on a bertox) and the ranger lvl 8 I started out with playing<br/>
on Fennin Ro, but living without Accelrando just isent worth it, hehe.<br/>
I think your observations are true and would like to add that I also have had<br/>
great fun doing the lambent quests. Sneaking into LGuk at 26th is hair raising,<br/>
I just wished that the armor was no drop too. So everyone one would know that I<br/>
had gathered all the pieces myself.... I really dont understand why only the<br/>
components are no drop. Now that I only lack to get the gauntlets boots and<br/>
helmet (doubt I will be wearing that bird *g*), I have slowed down and is<br/>
concentrating on gaining some levels. More of these quests would be great as it<br/>
is a good way for us casual players to get upgrades. I did the langeseax quest a<br/>
couple of times and got a LoW which I traded for a crystalline blade (dam11<br/>
del38 I think). I sold it to get money for the rubies to my lambent BP when I<br/>
had aquired all the other parts. Now Im using a Silvery axe and the good ole<br/>
dragoon dirk. The morale is though - it is possible for the casual player to<br/>
make money  (still have 500+PP in bank) and get good items. You just have to be<br/>
more creative *g*. A good guild is also a way for players like us to get to the<br/>
better equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways quests are fun when the reward is good, but there has to be some kind of<br/>
control with the rewards, I mean look at how the langeseax quest has degraded<br/>
the worth of a quite fine Warrior weapon. The quest was/is great fun to do, but<br/>
I dont think people should be able to do it over and over again (Yes I have done<br/>
the quest 8 or 9 times which yelded 2 LoW&#39;s).<br/>

<br/>
I agree with everything Crier said.  One thing I would like to add is a<br/>
comment on obtaining good items.  Like the original poster, I don&#39;t get to<br/>
play that often.  My bard is my only character and I&#39;ve been playing him<br/>
since April.  When I do play, I only get to play for a couple hours at a<br/>
time.  I&#39;m only 29th level, but I assume that what Crier said about high<br/>
level mobs ripping you to shreds if you don&#39;t have good equipment is true.<br/>
With that out of the way...<br/>
<br/>
IMO, players like me and the original poster are handicapped when it comes<br/>
to obtaining the really good magic items.  In order to obtain those items,<br/>
several factors come into play.  First off, if you want to get the items by<br/>
yourself, you have to be able to camp the spawn long enough.  Many of the<br/>
items are rare drops so that could mean anywhere from a couple of hours<br/>
during one playing session (if you are extremely lucky) or several hours<br/>
over multiple playing sessions.<br/>
<br/>
2d factor: IMO its a lot easier to camp the good magic item spawn sites when<br/>
you are in a well balanced group of players who all know how to work<br/>
together effectively.  This is difficult for the casual gamer because most<br/>
of the friends he makes in game usually end up surpassing him in levels.<br/>
End result is that casual gamers tend to join pickup groups most of the<br/>
time.  In my experience, I die more often in these types of groups because<br/>
everyone seems to have their own agenda.   There is a side bonus to this<br/>
however.  Because you are usually camping with new players all the time, you<br/>
do have the benefit of continually making new friends, which is always a<br/>
good thing.<br/>
<br/>
3d factor:  The people who are able to acquire good items are usually not<br/>
inclined to sell them, preferring trades instead.  This hampers the casual<br/>
gamer assuming factors #1 and #2 come into play.  This hasn&#39;t hampered me<br/>
too much in my mid 20s because all my money I have earned since 25th level<br/>
as gone to acquiring gems for the lambent armor.  Once I get all my lambent<br/>
pieces, I want to upgrade my weapons.  I&#39;m still using a dragoon dirk and<br/>
thulian claws.  I haven&#39;t seen anyone selling weapons better than those in a<br/>
long time.  Lot of people willing to trade them for items of equal power<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
The lambent quests are perfect for the casual gamer.  These quests allow us<br/>
to get good items at our own pace.  If Verant would only put in more quests<br/>
for mid to high level weapons and other non-class armor equipment I would be<br/>
a happy camper.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is even though IMO casual gamers get the short end of the stick<br/>
when it comes to getting good items, I still have fun playing.  Like others<br/>
have said its not a race to get to 50.<br/>
