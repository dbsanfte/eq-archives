<div id="ygrps-yiv-221473207">Sounds like a good guild, however, is the guild careful in its<br/>
equipment distribution or do they do somewhat twinky stuff like<br/>
getting ykesha style equipment for people in their 30s?<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, A guild helping to get equipment is fine, but the person<br/>
that is getting the equipment should contribute adequately helping<br/>
get that equipment.  And no, a level 30 warrior does not help in the<br/>
ghoul lord room. :)<br/>
<br/>
I almost joined a guild, until I found out this is what they meant<br/>
by &quot;helping me get equipment&quot;<br/>

&gt; Hehe - sounds like you need a new guild.  Our guild leader spends a great<br/>
&gt; deal of his time basically doing nothing - &quot;/shout level 50 wiz looking for<br/>
&gt; a group!&quot; So, he is happy to move us around, log in a lev 50 cleric and res<br/>
&gt; us as needed.  If they are breaking planes, raiding boots or dragons,<br/>
&gt; obviously you gotta wait or deal with it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A couple weekends ago, in a hi-mid 30&#39;s guild group we went to the live side<br/>
&gt; and we took the jail room. The login server crashed and I went LinkDead.  I<br/>
&gt; could not get back in and gave up trying after a couple hours.  Next<br/>
&gt; morning, I wanted to play but did not want to &quot;bother&quot; the 50&#39;s.  So, I<br/>
&gt; studied a map real carefully and uncamped. There I was - face to face with a<br/>
&gt; room full of froogys.  I mashed screetch and took off for the exit.  The<br/>
&gt; froogys were not my problem but the mino-cows were. Stunned, spun, and<br/>
&gt; smooshed.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I had to fess up and get some help.  And I was very embarrassed since<br/>
&gt; this was like my first week in the guild.  But they were real nice and both<br/>
&gt; a 50 wiz and 50 clr who were not busy came and got me.  &quot;Wow, you made it<br/>
&gt; much further than I expected!  But really, there is no need for that - just<br/>
&gt; ask us next time.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My guild is quite a unique group of people.  The &#39;culture&#39; is one of making<br/>
&gt; everyone better.  They think about how they can get things for other&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; work hard to make sure that everyone has the best stuff.  I was really<br/>
&gt; impressed when I saw how much they think about others in the guild.  I hear<br/>
&gt; &quot;we have to get (this item)... for (that person)...&quot; much more that I hear<br/>
&gt; &quot;who will help me get this...&quot; As a result we have a really good team.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What you say about respecting their time is correct.  I don&#39;t expect them to<br/>
&gt; drop what they are doing and help little old me.  Even so, they are willing<br/>
&gt; to help us mid levels grow.  Here&#39;s an example:  we had 2 groups in Guk -<br/>
&gt; one camping the frenzy and the other camping the king. I was with the frenzy<br/>
&gt; crew and had 2 50 ench, 1 50 cleric, a 40ish tank and me bard 40.  The king<br/>
&gt; room called for some help and one of the enchanters ran over.  Then he<br/>
&gt; called for some help and the cleric gated over.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hehe, then our room spawned and we needed some help.  The enchanter and the<br/>
&gt; tank were down to less than half a bub of hp and dropping and getting<br/>
&gt; stunned/interrupted.  So, I equipped my lute and played hymn.  More out of<br/>
&gt; instinct and last ditch attempt to heal (I think I cast minor heal on the<br/>
&gt; tank with my crude stein too.)  Anyhow the frenzy or bloodthristy objected<br/>
&gt; to me helping them and he helped himself to me. The others lived and in<br/>
&gt; short order I was ressed back. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Different guilds have different attitudes.  I am not afraid to ask mine for<br/>
&gt; help and they are not afraid to say &#39;sorry&#39; if they are busy.  But we got a<br/>
&gt; lot of high levels and a bunch of us have 2 pc&#39;s and can run 2 logins at the<br/>
&gt; same time.  That along with some strategic binds makes things work quite<br/>
&gt; smoothly.  <br/>

&gt; Please don&#39;t ask guild clerics to run halfway across the world to rez you<br/>
&gt; (or even up from the deep part of the dungeons) Its rude and it impinges on<br/>
&gt; THEIR time. Esp because, if they are guild, they don&#39;t feel like they can<br/>
&gt; say No. A guild&#39;s purpose is not to provide teleporters/rezzes. If you want<br/>
&gt; these, get in a group where one of your members can do it.<br/>
