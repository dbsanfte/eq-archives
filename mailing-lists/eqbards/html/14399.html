<div id="ygrps-yiv-821258727">Unfortunately for me I&#39;ve never noticed the artwork.  Hmmmm.  Pretty bad for<br/>
an art minor.  The only one I remember is the poker playing one.  I think<br/>
this would be really great.  Please get snapping!<br/>

&gt; &gt; So, now we have been playing this game for nearly a year.  Does anyone<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a clue about the actual &quot;lore&quot; of Norrath?  What have they done to tell<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; &gt; some history?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   /ooc<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   On my lunch break today, I will run from innothule to solb.<br/>
&gt;   I will snap pictures of all the paintings on the walls for us<br/>
&gt;   to discuss.  If you have not examined the pictures which are<br/>
&gt;   pasted across the zone, you are really missing out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   /ic, mostly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I will be entering Nagafen&#39;s Lair, visiting the King room<br/>
&gt;   (king, priest, champ) - and nearby areas to record information<br/>
&gt;   as to the meaning behind the art.  I&#39;ve brought this up before<br/>
&gt;   and I love listening to people&#39;s take on what it really means.<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve started conversations with group members in the king room<br/>
&gt;   which have lasted hours about the meaning behind the pantings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   After we talk about the various meanings, I would like to submit<br/>
&gt;   the pictures and comments onto a website which we can ask Verant<br/>
&gt;   to look at and maybe /chuckle at; then give us the &#39;real&#39; intent<br/>
&gt;   or meaning behind the scenes.  There is a story afoot, and I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt;   to know what that story is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It would be in the true spirit of bards to want to pursue such<br/>
&gt;   storytelling in the future.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>
