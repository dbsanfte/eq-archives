&gt; Hee hee.  I hope that&#39;s all it is, but I am not too hopeful as he didn&#39;t<br/>

error in how charisma is factored into all this.  My base<br/>
charisma is 110 so I can&#39;t really test this.  Well, maybe I<br/>
can get a skunk to blast me down to 70 and see if Lullaby<br/>
works better...<br/>

Yes, he didn&#39;t seem surprised it was happening with a L1<br/>
snake.  But that doesn&#39;t contradict the theory that he just<br/>
took the Pixie Strike high-level 2nd resist code and reused it<br/>
with some tweaks for Lullaby.<br/>
