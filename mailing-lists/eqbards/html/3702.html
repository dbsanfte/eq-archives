<br/>
Most folks realize you aren&#39;t doing nearly enough damage with bellow to be<br/>
ABLE to KS - and if it&#39;s a multiple mob, and they are paying attention at<br/>
all, they will kiss your feet for lullaby. If it&#39;s really low level - I&#39;ll<br/>
even tick them off, get them to turn their attention towards ME, take the<br/>
heat and just stand there and not swing, let the person get some backhits<br/>
and heal or at least stop getting hurt.<br/>

&gt;Walk up to a fight, looks close?  Cast a heal or two, and a <br/>
&gt;couple of buffs, walk on.  I&#39;ve yet to find a way to do this well<br/>
&gt;with my bard.  The only way to do it is to directly affect the<br/>
&gt;mob, and that seems rude to me without an invitation, even if<br/>
&gt;there is no chance of kill stealing. </span></blockquote></div>
