&gt; I have probably solo&#39;ed a full half a bubble (I hate solo&#39;ing) of all my<br/>
&gt; XP<br/>
&gt; gained to level 30.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Even levels 1-5?  I didn&#39;t start grouping at level 4, I think, and<br/>
for the most part have grouped constantly throughout (though I do try<br/>
soloing every now and then, it&#39;s not a significant amount of my total xp)<br/>

&gt; weave 2 MR songs when doing MR.  Missing a note and dropping one of the MR<br/>
&gt; songs can be to devistating to risk that possibility.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	My usualy strategy for this, is to make those 2 the most important.<br/>
In other words, I&#39;ll try and do 3 songs, but if I miss a note on anthem,<br/>
I&#39;ll skip it and restart 1st MR song, then 2nd MR song, then try Anthem<br/>
again.  Or if I miss a note of 2nd MR song, restart 2nd MR song, go back to<br/>
1st MR song and repeat.<br/>
