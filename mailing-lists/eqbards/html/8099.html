<div id="ygrps-yiv-121817704">I have played with this song a bit, and while I do not think it is worth <br/>
having memorized, I&#39;m not convinced that it is broken.  On eight <br/>
different occasions, I have had a negative effect disappear as soon as <br/>
the song did its first static charge pulse.  This has only happened on <br/>
the first pulse of the song, it has only removed DOT buffs (from Necros, <br/>
SKs or Shamen), and it has often failed to remove DOT buffs, but the fact <br/>
that eight negative buffs have disappeared on the first pulse suggests to <br/>
me that it may actually be working (it may just be relatively worthless). <br/>
Or I may be the delusional victim of a misleading, albeit unlikely, <br/>
series of coincidences.  ;P   Has anyone else noticed this?<br/>
