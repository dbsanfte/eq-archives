 </span></blockquote>I had to do it a lot figuring out how to do it, but now that I<br/>
have the method down, I haven&#39;t had to do it much lately.  <br/>
Yesterday was the first time I had to use fear in Lower Guk in<br/>
about a week.  First time a friend I was grouped with hadn&#39;t<br/>
gotten any sleep and ran the wrong way (towards the mobs<br/>
instead of away :), and the second and third times we had a<br/>
train dumped on us.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, the Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD strategy works<br/>
pretty well grouped with another tank.  Just get the other<br/>
tank to understand to distribute the damage and you should be<br/>
fine.  I was grouped with a cleric last night and tried<br/>
playing a couple different ways before also settling on<br/>
Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD, albeit in a slightly different way.<br/>
<br/>
First I tried Verses and weapons.  We both ended up at half hp<br/>
fighting a ghoul zol, with the cleric nearly OOM.  Scratch<br/>
that.  Next I tried Chain+Verses+CoC, but still had problems<br/>
doing enough damage to keep stuff off the cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I settled on Hymn+Niv&#39;s+CoC+CoD, but fighting several<br/>
mobs simultaneously.  The cleric just kept me healed,<br/>
occasionally stunning.  The first time I had to do this was<br/>
due to a train.  We had the water ele and a zol dumped on us<br/>
(the rest passed us while we were invis).  We finished the ele<br/>
and zol with the cleric at 40%, but we were fighting in the<br/>
halls and a mino joined in, followed shortly by the returning<br/>
train (zol, 2 wans, urd, yun, and shin).  That&#39;s when we<br/>
bailed (well, after we paused at the bottom of the ramp,<br/>
fearing stuff while waiting for someone who&#39;d gone afk to get<br/>
back).<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, we had a bit more control over the situation and<br/>
were able to fight pretty successfully.  Mino elder (green but<br/>
fights like a blue) + mino (green) + 2 wans went down pretty<br/>
easily.  2 zols was pretty easy too.  The highlight of the<br/>
night was when all the wandering mobs just decided to converge<br/>
at where we were standing.  We killed a zol, 2 wans, 2 urds +<br/>
pets, and 2 minos simultaneously.  I only got exp for a zol<br/>
and urd, but the cleric was 47 and got experience for most of<br/>
them.  It was starting to look bad and the cleric had just<br/>
given me a LOM message, when things started dropping dead. :)<br/>
2 players vs 7 low blue/high green mobs and we won.  Fun fun<br/>
fun.<br/>

&gt; see his corpse poof.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s why I never use it on named mobs unless the only<br/>
way to kill the mob is if I use it.<br/>
