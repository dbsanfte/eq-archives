&gt;&gt; was wondering if anyone can give me hint as to the gnoll that carry a<br/>
&gt;&gt; Tomahawk and what lvl is it?  I am currently lv 19.  I just want to know at<br/>
&gt;&gt; what lvl should I start getting a group together and go and kill it.<br/>

&gt;Generally, don&#39;t even bother unless you can get a spellcaster<br/>
&gt;to help you, or you can get up around 6am eastern to camp the<br/>
&gt;spot.  Highpass basically is a place for mages and wizards to<br/>
&gt;camp and kill things and sell the special weapons to the melee<br/>
&gt;types who could easily have killed the mobs themselves if the<br/>
&gt;mages and wizards weren&#39;t there.  Come to think of it, most<br/>
&gt;places are like this, but nothing exemplifies it more than<br/>
&gt;Highpass (well, maybe Crush&#39;s tower in Crushbone).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wouldn&#39;t mind this so much if there were named mobs who<br/>
&gt;carried nice mage-type items and were so resistant to magic<br/>
&gt;that you needed to melee to kill it.  Unfortunately, things<br/>
&gt;are very one-sided right now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to say one thing on this that may help..as it has helped me in<br/>
the past to get a few items..if you are camping a spot for a peticular item<br/>
and taking turns etc... then along comes mr.nuker to steal that rare..here<br/>
is what i do..when it spawns sing the charm song right away...most of the<br/>
time mr.kill stealer nuker will dump most to all his mana so fast trying to<br/>
steal the kill he wont notice that his spells arent doing any damage..or<br/>
you can run off to a different spot having the rare follow you since its<br/>
charmed...this tactic has helped me and my group many a time and frustrated<br/>
the hell out of would be stealers..usually resulting in alot of WTF?????<br/>
from the nuker...<br/>
