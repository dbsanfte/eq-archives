<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714295884">Almost all classes have a cap of 94 in Hand to Hand, monks being the<br/>
exception.<br/>
<br/>
Using an instrument in lieu of a weapon in combat at later levels is like,<br/>
well, cutting off your hand.  There&#39;s times when it&#39;s useful, but for the<br/>
most part, you&#39;re better off taking advantage of the fact that you hit well,<br/>
and hard, with 1h weapons, and can dual wield.  If you wish to play a nearly<br/>
passive support bard,  I wish you luck.  While your songs are a great aid to<br/>
the party, most would prefer you loan your blade skills as well.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, there&#39;s no increased or decreased spell effects using different<br/>
instruments of the same class.  Was something Geoffrey wanted to implement,<br/>
but never got around to doing.  So use a lute to save a few gold, if you<br/>
wish, it&#39;s functionally the same as a mandolin.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Greetings all.  I was wondering if anyone knew about our skill caps?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Specifically, Hand to Hand - for a while now, mine has stopped at 3 * level<br/>
&gt;+ 1.  Does anyone know if this is the limit for us in this skill?  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;asked several of our bardic kin in-game, and no one seems to know the<br/>
&gt;answer for sure (I got a lot of people curious though  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, and one more thing - does anyone know if there are any specific<br/>
&gt;differences in using the various instruments avaliable in the game?  (for<br/>
&gt;example - the mandolin and the lute - is it just the weight that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;different?  or a brass horn and a mino horn?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
