<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228695756">Jeff&#39;s warning is warranted, but things aren&#39;t as bad as he<br/>
puts them.  I can only think of 2 or 3 occasions out of scores<br/>
where my accidently chaining a mob that&#39;s been snared has<br/>
caused problems.  In fact, when you get to your mid-30s, the<br/>
rangers will *want* you to chain so they can use their ebony<br/>
blades (procs ensnaring roots - 40 point DD and root, which<br/>
cancels snare).  The sword is a nice upgrade from the SSoMorin<br/>
they&#39;ve been using up til now, and the SSoYkesha is still out<br/>
of their grasp.<br/>

Chain usually lasts 3 ticks.  It rarely lasts 3 ticks if<br/>
you&#39;re fighting a very high blue or higher.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; at higher levels, expect the MOB to start moving.  When it comes time for<br/>
&gt; the MOB to start running, you better not be trying to weave chains with<br/>
&gt; another song either.  In most high level dungeons your margin of error for a<br/>
&gt; runner is minimal.  A fire imp running on an efreeti raid doesn&#39;t need to go<br/>
<br/>
The imp familiars are hardly typical.  The only places I can<br/>
think of like the imps are the fire giants, ice giants, and<br/>
the planes.  Maybe the mermaids in Estrella&#39;s room.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; far to bring h3ll down on your raiding party and even in deep paw, a gnoll<br/>
&gt; escapes out of a room into the hallway and you are toast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your chains is in effect and snare is cast, it won&#39;t stick.  It takes a<br/>
&gt; druid or ranger long enough to recycle to be able to cast again that the<br/>
&gt; lost time could mean death as well.  Worse even, I&#39;ve seen bards (including<br/>
&gt; myself) press the wrong key and chain a MOB that is already snared... The<br/>
&gt; effect is to break snare and in a few seconds your MOB is suddenly on the<br/>
&gt; loose.  Have one of these things happen once and I guarantee a good group<br/>
&gt; with make you stop using chains or will disband from you.  You should go<br/>
&gt; talk to high level rangers or druids and ask them what they hate most about<br/>
&gt; bards... you&#39;ll find they all hate the bards that insist on chaining or are<br/>
&gt; convinced chains is better then snare.<br/>
<br/>
I think you may be suffering from an overdependence on snare.  <br/>
:)  95% of the time, chain is sufficient.  98% of the time,<br/>
chain+root is sufficient.  99% of the time, chain+stun+root is<br/>
sufficient.  Snare puts it at 100% for just one spell, which<br/>
makes it the preferred method.  Except for the efreeti run and<br/>
fights against white-red mobs, I&#39;ve *never* been in a<br/>
situation where the group said &quot;We don&#39;t have a snarer, we<br/>
can&#39;t do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; At around level 25 is when the good bards start getting set apart from the<br/>
&gt; bad bards and one of the traits of a bad bard is to tell other classes how<br/>
&gt; to do their job or try to fulfill roles that are clearly already filled by<br/>
&gt; another class in a party.  How many bards would pixie a MOB that an<br/>
&gt; enchanter mezzed?  I keep pixie up, but not as a replacement for mez, but<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that&#39;s a good way to wake up the mob - get it madder<br/>
at you than at the enchanter and his paper-thin robes.  :)  <br/>
The other good ways are stun, or root (though root doesn&#39;t<br/>
wake it up).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My brother&#39;s character is a druid and I can&#39;t even begin to describe how<br/>
&gt; much better snare/fear works then chains/fear on the big stuff.  Especially<br/>
&gt; against larger MOBs where fear gets resisted.  A lot of the time fear lasts<br/>
&gt; a single pulse.<br/>
<br/>
Well of course.  He&#39;s a caster, he doesn&#39;t care of the mob is<br/>
moving.  Play with a bunch of melee types and they&#39;ll like<br/>
Chain/Fear better because the mob stops moving sooner.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You want a group friendly slowdown?  Use binding.  And no, it doesn&#39;t wake<br/>
&gt; up mezzed mobs.  Don&#39;t use either if you have a shaman with togors who can<br/>
&gt; get it to stick.<br/>
<br/>
If it works like chain and CoC, if the shaman casts togors<br/>
first, you can use binding afterwards to get the AC debuff and<br/>
slow down/taunt extra mobs.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my bard and I love my songs, but I also know when<br/>
&gt; to use them and when not too.  I do everything I can to learn about the<br/>
&gt; other classes and their strengths and weaknesses so that I can make sure my<br/>
&gt; song line up augments a party instead of being a detriment.<br/>
