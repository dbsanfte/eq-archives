<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825837125">A couple of things:<br/>
<br/>
My guild&#39;s loot is distributed by the raid leader.  Plain and simple.  You<br/>
just need to trust your raid leaders to be fair :)<br/>
<br/>
Bards are a tough class to decide on loot rights.  For weapons any other<br/>
melee class can use them better than us (since they all have dual attack),<br/>
thus isn&#39;t the guild served best by having them go to the real melees.  No<br/>
to mention, a portion of a bard&#39;s life he isn&#39;t even using weapons.  This<br/>
definitly includes most large mobs, which really make a or break a guild.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  We killed Wuoshi.  He(she?) dropped the Crscent Blade (a SWEET<br/>
1HS) and An Emerald Scimitar (very good ratio, but slow as hell, +100 mana).<br/>
The raid leader (clearly) awarded the crscent blade to one of our warriors<br/>
who does have his epics yet and gave the scimitar to a druid who isn&#39;t in<br/>
our guild but id on at least half our raids (we have about 10 players who<br/>
are members of small guilds, but might as well be in our guild for raid<br/>
purposes).  However, the warrior was asked to give his lammy (replaced by<br/>
the crescent blade) to me, since I did not get the scimitar. (then we<br/>
discovered bards can&#39;t wield lammy&#39;s, heh)<br/>
<br/>
A similar case can be made for armor.  Would the guild not be better served<br/>
by having a tank with a higher ac?  THough bards do take a beating too...<br/>
<br/>
However bards can&#39;t be totally shafted by loot either.  1.  No raid leader<br/>
wants to shaft anyone.  2.  (at least on my server) Good bards are rare, and<br/>
most guilds don&#39;t have enough (I go on raids with at least 3 other guilds,<br/>
and we have a group of 4 bards who regularly join us from those same guilds.<br/>
The 6 (2 from my guild) of us have discussed forming a union, hehehehe)<br/>
<br/>
I like point systems and if I was in charge of a guild, we would use one.<br/>
However, there is something nice about just doing &quot;whats best for the guild&quot;<br/>
