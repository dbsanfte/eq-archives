<br/>
I&#39;ll share my insights on these items...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;B:  I was wondering about the instrument pieces. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Before the Sunderings (back in P3 & P4), there was a bard in Qeynos who<br/>
would make instruements for you if you provided the pieces. I know he could<br/>
make a flute, at least, and I think a trumpet or lute as well. Anyhow, he<br/>
now says that he&#39;s out of the flute making business.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard the rumor that gnomes can tinker instruments and I&#39;m VERY<br/>
VERY interested in this. If anyone knows anything, please share.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;C:  Often when I play my songs my music sounds very strange.  I was<br/>
&gt;wondering if any others have experienced this.  It definately sounds as if<br/>
&gt;my Mandolin is out of tune, which would give credence to the usefullness of<br/>
&gt;Lute Tuners.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lute Tuners aren&#39;t for tuning the lute in that fashion; they are, in fact,<br/>
the knobs that hold the strings that you turn to tune a lute. So, they are<br/>
a lute part, to be used in the construction of a lute, not in the<br/>
enhancement of one.<br/>
