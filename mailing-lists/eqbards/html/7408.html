<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063924335">Just out of curiosity, do spell casters skills (conjuration, abjuration,<br/>
etc) cap at 200 also?  If they do, it may be hard to argue that our<br/>
instrument skills should have higher caps (not that I disagree).  If casters<br/>
skills cap at 250-255, I&#39;d say we have a damn good arguement.<br/>

&gt;Okay, I haven&#39;t been at the office for a few days (which is where I do all<br/>
&gt;of my emailing), but I&#39;m back now and have a revised version of the letter<br/>
&gt;than I&#39;ll be sending to GZ.  The point on Selo&#39;s and SoW cancelling it has<br/>
&gt;been removed, as a fix for this has been put in with the last patch.<br/>
&gt;I almost took out the point about our skills capping too low, as a few<br/>
&gt;people felt that 40 foraging is adequate, but more people seemed to agree<br/>
&gt;that this skill caps too low to be useful, so I&#39;m leaving it.  I&#39;ve added a<br/>
&gt;point regarding the lack of instrument information when right clicking on a<br/>
&gt;song in our spellbooks (as suggested by John).<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m starting to lose my steam on this now, so if there are no further<br/>
&gt;comments/corrections/suggestions/ additions, this will be the version that<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another thing you might want to add is it is near impossible to stack your<br/>
high level songs (I miss on average 20-30 notes a fight trying to twist<br/>
cessation and cresendo) So if ya think you are smashing buttons now just<br/>
wait =) Maybe add in that our instrument skills should not be capped at 200<br/>
but 250 or 255.. (Why on earth would they want to cap us in these skills??)<br/>
I am fearing the thought of stacking Cessation and Verses...<br/>
As for skills the only one I am partial to is track...nice high cap ; )<br/>
maybe hide would be good if they didn&#39;t cap it insanely low.<br/>
