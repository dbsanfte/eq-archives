<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336153288">What a great story!  And great advice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;After a few battles, he took me aside and<br/>
&gt;told me he should maybe &quot;explain&quot; to me how bards worked, &quot;The bard buffs<br/>
&gt;are worthless.&quot;  ???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He just wanted two songs, and only two: accelerado and hymn of restoration,<br/>
&gt;&quot;the only worthwhile bard songs.&quot;  What I did?  I laughed in his face.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then I explained to him how MAGES should work: Stated I actually hated<br/>
&gt;waiting around for five minutes as he recharged after every skirmish with a<br/>
&gt;gnoll pup, so he shouldn&#39;t do anything at all--nada / zilch / stand there<br/>
&gt;stiff / do nothing--except in dire emergencies!  Told him a mage<br/>
&gt;should--never--cast spells (except for a pet), until that rare time the<br/>
&gt;battle is turning for the worse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This IS good advice.  Not only that, it will keep the creatures from<br/>
frenzying on the mage and ignoring the fighters.  Seen a lot of fights go<br/>
bad like that.  People don&#39;t understand that, yeah, maybe our buffs aren&#39;t<br/>
all super awesome like the clerics, but they are FREE and they affect<br/>
EVERYONE.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Keep this in mind: it&#39;s your character, not the leader&#39;s.  Personally, if I<br/>
&gt;find myself in a group with a bad &quot;general,&quot; I either disobey (and see how<br/>
&gt;he reacts) and/or leave.  You can be arrogant, see,  because you are a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BARD,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;special, who needs the rest of them, eh?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very good advice.  Keyeon, my bard, is an exteremely arrogant and<br/>
overconfident guy.  But I try to do it in a fun and entertaining way: making<br/>
incredible boasts, etc.  It&#39;s way fun! 8-)<br/>
