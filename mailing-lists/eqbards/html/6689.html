<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437230145">As example of how great accel is compared to sow, last night i was<br/>
47 pounds over and i was still running faster then my druid friend that was<br/>
in wolf form. They need to make sow removable by clicking on it<br/>

&gt; Our cancelling SOW was a fluke.. SoW overpowering Accel was not an<br/>
&gt; accident.  And WHY would you prefer SOW to Accel?  Obviously outdoors you<br/>
&gt; would not since Accel is far faster especially as the bard playing grows.<br/>
&gt; In our desire to not fall into the morrass of me too and I wanna be<br/>
&gt; superman flame wars with Verant many of us (bards) have adopted the well<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re fine we&#39;re balanced banner.  It&#39;s simply no longer true in my<br/>
&gt; opinion.  To discuss being worried about being a superclass is rather<br/>
&gt; silly and after the point so few players over all choose or understand the<br/>
&gt; bard that the other classes already point at us and complain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To close I&#39;m not interested in having our powers majorly overhauled.. or<br/>
&gt; special super powered bard only weapons.  I would like to see the quest<br/>
&gt; system fixed.. I&#39;d like to see some more special items for bards.  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to see some more useful songs. And I&#39;ld like to see them stop nerfing<br/>
&gt; us without reguard to the results. I won&#39;t even get into balance, as right<br/>
&gt; now I feel we are underbalanced now and others seem to think we are just<br/>
&gt; fine. Anyway those are my two cents.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think a lot of classes think they are &quot;most ingnored&quot;. I think however<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; we don&#39;t get a lot of &quot;attention&quot; it is because  we are one of the most<br/>
&gt; &gt; balanced classes in the game, that really need not a lot of effort to<br/>
&gt; &gt; balance us out. I could see more magic instruments, but I could also see<br/>
&gt; &gt; that making us too powerful in unintended ways, leading to nerfing,<br/>
&gt; leading<br/>
&gt; &gt; to screw-ups, etc. No, I don&#39;t think we need a bunch of new equiptment,<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; it complicates what is to my mind a a fairly balanced equasion. I hope<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are careful with the changes that are coming to the test center (class<br/>
&gt; &gt; specific quest-only weapons) because in the long run balance is WAY more<br/>
&gt; &gt; important than goodies.<br/>
