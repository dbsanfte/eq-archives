<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486904155">Bards should not have any problem with binding. With Selo&#39;s Accelerondo you should be back and fighting extremly quickly. As for dying early on it&#39;s problem but at higher levels like 20+ you begin to die much less. At 30+ you basically don&#39;t die if you do then the binding issue is the least of your problems. As for making spell casters bound only in cities it just plain won&#39;t happen. As it is you basically either keep on playing a class without bind or you go play a spellcaster.<br/>

&gt;I am curious then, what is the rationale behind allowing casters to bind<br/>
&gt;right outside of a dungeon.  My beef has never been that only casters can<br/>
&gt;bind.  Heck, I party up 100% of the time, and always with someone who can<br/>
&gt;bind.  I have no problem with this.  But what ungodly reason made you guys<br/>
&gt;decide to make 2/3rds of the classes have to run for long periods of time,<br/>
&gt;sometimes VERY long periods of time to get back to the dungeon they were<br/>
&gt;in, while the binding classes are back in a matter of minutes.  One of the<br/>
&gt;most discouraging problems in EQ is DOWNTIME.  I would rather die several<br/>
&gt;times in a row trying to get my corpse than have to run for 30 minutes<br/>
&gt;before even getting to TRY.  Now granted, the one nice benefit of this is<br/>
&gt;that it makes adventuring in far away dungeons more difficult, and<br/>
&gt;therefore less people populate these dungeons than otherwise would, but it<br/>
&gt;is still unbalancing to the game.  I&#39;m with the folks that say NO ONE<br/>
&gt;should be able to bind outside cities.  Nothing more frustrating than<br/>
&gt;getting killed in Paw, and have to run all the way back from Highhold,<br/>
&gt;while your cleric and wizard buddies are back in the dungeon, with all<br/>
&gt;their stuff, making experience and cash while you&#39;re just running naked,<br/>
&gt;trying not to get killed by Griffons and Hill Giants.  This isn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;bringing up the bard specific problem that it takes forever to remem all<br/>
&gt;your songs since we don&#39;t have meditate.  So the casters get a huge bonus<br/>
&gt;there as well.  They die, and 30 seconds later they&#39;re back up and ready to<br/>
&gt;go, with basically no loss in offensive power, but some loss in defense.  I<br/>
&gt;hate to suggest gimping another class, but in this case, I see it as the<br/>
&gt;only way to address a serious game inbalance.  The ONLY thing that keeps me<br/>
&gt;playing a bard at all is that I do get accelerando.  I would never play a<br/>
&gt;non-caster, non-bard though, due to the incredible frustration of running<br/>
&gt;back to your corpse.  Some would say, &quot;Just don&#39;t die.&quot;  To which I say,<br/>
&gt;&quot;If I&#39;m not dying, I&#39;m not taking enough risks for the game to be fun.&quot;<br/>
&gt;The running back part is far from fun however.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry, rambling.  :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;It was decided early on that all casting classes (not hybrids) would have<br/>
&gt;&gt;Gate, and only a couple classes would have Bind Affinity.  As a matter of<br/>
&gt;&gt;fact, some of you early phase testers might recall that Bind used to require<br/>
&gt;&gt;a then hard to find and costly stone to cast.<br/>
