&gt;armor?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, though charm no longer works for SS armor you can use it for the choker <br/>
quest.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;someday I can get the SS armor if I get the gems.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sneak still works for SS armor. The problem is the Laochmaster that converts <br/>
helmets is right on the teleport spot to the quest hall, and he sees invis, <br/>
so you would need to kill him if you are KoS. Probly not too hard (blue to a <br/>
60th), but I wouldn&#39;t really know.<br/>
