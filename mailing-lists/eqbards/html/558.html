<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402547872">Well, this may be true in a role-playing sense . . . but don&#39;t let your<br/>
sensibilities regarding realism cause you to desire a game that is more<br/>
like reality and less like fun. If I can&#39;t talk to my fellow players, then<br/>
the game quickly becomes an absurdity. This is why when they make movies<br/>
that have a fantasy setting, everyone normally speaks English.<br/>
<br/>
Other absurdities include the extremely slow heal rate, and the inability<br/>
to run away from a fight (which are THE reasons I am a Bard, without the<br/>
heal and speed song I would have quit EQ out of total frustration).<br/>

&gt;Maybe I am incorrect, but I am under the impression that you need<br/>
&gt;to &#39;hear&#39; a language before you are given the option of training<br/>
&gt;a point in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I never had gnoll, dark speech, elder tier&#39;dal (sp?) available as<br/>
&gt;language options until later in the game (presumably after I had<br/>
&gt;heard it in my travels).<br/>
&gt;Maybe the languages have level restrictions?  That would also explain<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
&gt;But even Barbarian or Dwarf were not available to me to train in<br/>
&gt;until a friend spoke to me in these languages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And following this thread of conversation, am I relatively alone in<br/>
&gt;my hatred for the &#39;common tongue&#39; language?  While I am not a hard-<br/>
&gt;core role-player, I find that it seriously detracts from the role-<br/>
&gt;playing experience.<br/>
&gt;Honestly, how realistic is it for a dwarf, having grown up in <br/>
&gt;Kelethin, travelling to Freeport and easily able to converse with <br/>
&gt;humans?<br/>
