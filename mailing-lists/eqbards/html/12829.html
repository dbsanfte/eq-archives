<div id="ygrps-yiv-226075211">Has anyone had any luck at all getting the /stopsong command to work?<br/>
I was fighting in Unrest last night (note to self, never ever go there<br/>
again!) and managed to get my song stuck a number of different times<br/>
(sigh).  And of course my party is asking for the healing song in down<br/>
time, and I would have loved to.  Except I&#39;m stuck playing binding and<br/>
daren&#39;t move in case I bring the whole house down on us!<br/>
<br/>
So, nothing I could think of doing would stop the silly song from<br/>
playing.  Tried /stopsong, no luck.  I hope I just had the syntax<br/>
wrong please!  But I even tried .... sitting, ducking, reading my<br/>
songbook, even went so far as unmemming a song and re-memming it, but<br/>
no luck.  Didn&#39;t want to zone for fear of having a train behind me all<br/>
nodding!<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me I&#39;m not alone in this!  And is there any way of<br/>
actually correcting it apart from getting stunned, or how about what<br/>
causes the song to get stuck and I&#39;ll try to avoid it again!<br/>
