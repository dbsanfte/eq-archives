<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077230871">Hi, nice to see this group here!  I just got the EQ Trilogy and <br/>
installed everything, seems to run ok.  I now have a level 3 Bard <br/>
with whom I&#39;ve been practicing singing.  He is now up to &quot;Feeble&quot; <br/>
does this mean i can start singing?  Do I need to learn songs?  How <br/>
do i do that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is the game supposed to run in full screen? I have it on <br/>
800x600 and it doesnt fill the screen.  And at higher resolutions the <br/>
game screen gets smaller.  Mind I have tweaked voodoo3 drivers <br/>
running in XP so i can use Glide with other games so that could be <br/>
the culpret.<br/>
