<div id="ygrps-yiv-206775884">I was told about the &quot;walk&quot; trick and tried it, but it didn&#39;t seem to make <br/>
me run quite as fast as I&#39;m used to.  Granted, it was faster than trying the <br/>
use the drum normally.  I&#39;ll have to do some more testing to see if it&#39;s <br/>
anywhere near the speed of my Nostrolo Tambourine... hehe<br/>
<br/>
As for obtaining one, to be honest I wasn&#39;t able to attend the raid that it <br/>
dropped in.  My guild presented it to me as a gift.  According to <br/>
Allakhazam&#39;s site, it&#39;s an uncommon/rare drop off of a Shimmering Spirit, <br/>
which is an uncommon/rare spawn mob around level 52-ish in Siren&#39;s Grotto.  <br/>
According to reports on Allakhazam&#39;s, it would probably be a safe assumption <br/>
that 3 level 50-60 groups can handle the area in which it spawns.<br/>
<br/>
It has an instant-cast, targettable Enduring Breath effect and you wear it <br/>
in your primary slot.  You can weild a weapon in your secondary slot at the <br/>
same time.  You cannot, however, weild an instrument in your off-hand while <br/>
weilding it, unless either the Lute of the Howler or that Sky quest horn <br/>
would work.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, after getting this drum, the dot-kiting method works <br/>
tremendously better... hehe  I bought a sow potion and did 3-chants on the <br/>
few remaining blue-conning mobs in Dreadlands and made 2 blue bubs of level <br/>
53 in maybe 3-4 hours, finally dinging into 54!<br/>

&gt;From all reports I&#39;ve seen - the speed variable is overflowing and rolling<br/>
&gt;past 0.  I&#39;ve heard if you toggle to walk-you go at maximum speed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By the way - what mob dropped it in SG - and what&#39;s it&#39;s location?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

&gt;I know you hate updates after you release a new version, but I just got<br/>
&gt;Drums of the Beast, and I can say with a certainty that Selo&#39;s Song of<br/>
&gt;Travel gives 0% run speed improvement while weilding it.  In fact, and this<br/>
&gt;seems REALLY weird, I seem to run faster while singing it and weilding a<br/>
&gt;sword rather than that drum.  I&#39;m thinking it may actually be a negative<br/>
&gt;speed increase, but of course that&#39;s hard to quantify.<br/>
