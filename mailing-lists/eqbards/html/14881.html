<div id="ygrps-yiv-219307291">There is a little program called EQ zone explorer - it uses the tutorial,<br/>
and not all zones are explorable - but some are. Can be a little<br/>
tempermental to get fired up - but for the zones that work - it&#39;s great to<br/>
just walk around and learn layout.<br/>

says he doesn&#39;t play anymore - and future changes to EQ may make this<br/>
inoperable - but it works at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been inside MM castle either - but you can do it with this<br/>
program. It lands you on top of the castle - and you are stuck with a human<br/>
that can only walk, but you can&#39;t be hurt from falling - and you can&#39;t drown.<br/>
<br/>
I also explored Kedge a bit - although where it lands you is in the middle<br/>
of the thing.<br/>
<br/>
It takes me FOREVER to learn the layout of mazes - my last name should be<br/>
Wrongway - but after going from the zoneline in upper guk - to the first<br/>
lguk zone about a dozen times - I THINK I won&#39;t get lost next time (maybe).<br/>
<br/>
MM castle is simply stunning - too bad it&#39;s so deadly few ever get to<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>

&gt;    Someone posted a query a day or two ago asking for advice on camping the<br/>
&gt;Mistmoore Gypsy Room for the Gypsy Lute.  My guild is planning a Mistmoore<br/>
&gt;Raid Saturday to help me get the Lute (and the Battle Drums would be great -<br/>
&gt;and Gypsy Princess Lute would be okay as well!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Any advice from people who have successfully camped the room would be<br/>
&gt;appreciated.  I&#39;ve never been inside the castle.  So how do you get in - and<br/>
&gt;where should we camp?  In that room - or another and pull from that room.  I<br/>
&gt;have looked at the maps - but not sure of strategy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks! </span></blockquote></div>
