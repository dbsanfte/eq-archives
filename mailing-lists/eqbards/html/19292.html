<b>Subject:</b> Bristlebane bards in Overthere zone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336435112">I posted this earlier on the Concert Hall board.  Not certain if this is has<br/>
been mentioned before or is common knowledge to everyone so I&#39;ll post it<br/>
here as well.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have a Mask of Deception and worship Bristlebane, then you can<br/>
buy/sell/bank (but not bind) in the evil outpost in the Overthere zone.<br/>
Those two combined will raise your faction to Apprehensive with the guards<br/>
and merchants (at least the ones I conned).  Throw in the carillon and you<br/>
can raise your faction to Amiable:-)  I tried this today and was able to<br/>
roam freely through the outpost.  A big bonus to this is that now<br/>
Bristlebane bards can do the sarnak war braid quest.  This is an awesome<br/>
quest.  I turned in 4 war braids and got a noticeable increase in EXP (at<br/>
36th level).  Sarnak war braids are frequent drops so I see myself hanging<br/>
out in the Overthere for a level or two.  <br/>
<br/>
Not certain is agnostics with a Mask can bank there.  Also don&#39;t know if<br/>
people with bad Venril Sathir (sp?) faction can do this.  If you have done a<br/>
lot of fighting in Karnor&#39;s Castle then be sure to /con from a distance<br/>
before you go in.    <br/>
