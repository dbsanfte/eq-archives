<div id="ygrps-yiv-429841047">The Lambent blue was very distinctive, and I liked it as a differentiator, but the color was really too<br/>
much.  And the Imbrued looked like, well, like what everyone says Mountain Dew looks like.  Ugh.  The<br/>
Singing Steel is a very pretty color though.  I do wish I had that BP instead of the Melodic BP, which<br/>
looks like a Liberace-induced hallucination, what with all the gems sprinkled all over the place.  My<br/>
Blazing Gauntlets of Fennin Ro (a dark red) add a nice touch; I think those drew a massive number of<br/>
inspects (even if people weren&#39;t consciously aware of it) even before the Epic.<br/>

&gt; When I started getting imbrued though, it didn&#39;t look as good. Then I got<br/>
&gt; some kylong, and a hero bracer, and it was commented on several times that I<br/>
&gt; was really multicolored. Now I have managed to go mostly green, between SS<br/>
&gt; and dragon stuff from WW. Still have my silver helm (I love my hammerhead<br/>
&gt; bucket!) and my imbrued boots to break the monotony of all green and it<br/>
&gt; keeps me from looking like a ranger! I prefer green overall and don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; any major fashion shifts in the near future.<br/>
