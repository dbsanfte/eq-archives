<div id="ygrps-yiv-953252042">My guild held a &quot;joust&quot; in the PVP area of Qeynos.  It<br/>
was a friendly event, casters vs melee.  Casters were<br/>
defined as &quot;anyone who can bind&quot;.  Everyone else is a<br/>
melee class.<br/>
<br/>
Simple, but it worked out well.<br/>

&gt; announcing the coming of<br/>
&gt; the Test of Flight on my server. The MoTD also said<br/>
&gt; that we should go to<br/>
&gt; everquest.com<br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html)">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h.html)</a><br/>
&gt; and get<br/>
&gt; the details on the event, so I went.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, it turns out that the test of flight is an<br/>
&gt; archery contest. It looks<br/>
&gt; fun, but as a bard, I cannot compete, because,<br/>
&gt; despite the discover of a<br/>
&gt; bard usable bow, there are no arrows we can use. So<br/>
&gt; I was poking around on<br/>
&gt; the same events page to see what else was up and<br/>
&gt; comming that I could<br/>
&gt; participate in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Test of Steel... Nope.<br/>
&gt; Warrior, Monk, Paladin, Ranger and Shadow Knights<br/>
&gt; are the only ones who can<br/>
&gt; enter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Test of Mystics... Nope.<br/>
&gt; Necromancer, Wizards, Mages and Enchanters only.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Test of Faith... Nope.<br/>
&gt; Clerics, Paladins, Druids and Shamen only.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So basically, I found out that there is an event for<br/>
&gt; every single class,<br/>
&gt; except for bards. I was a little disappointed that I<br/>
&gt; am unable to compete in<br/>
&gt; any of these events merely because Verant has no<br/>
&gt; idea where bards belong in<br/>
&gt; the grand scheme of things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was gonna post all of this to the EQ message<br/>
&gt; boards, but I wanted to see<br/>
&gt; if you guys had any input first. I&#39;m generally<br/>
&gt; opposed to whiny posts, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure that regardless of how I word my<br/>
&gt; disatisfaction, that is how it<br/>
&gt; will be construed.<br/>
