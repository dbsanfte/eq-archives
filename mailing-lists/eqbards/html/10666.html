<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-951092575">Went to get my Shin Gauntlets and Greaves for Lambent yesterday. I wish I had gone 13 levels ago (as soon as I got Sonorous Clouding). When I walked into lower Guk, turned the first corner, see Shin Corpse on ground, click, greaves. Joined a group in the bedroom and killed Undead Shin Knights, 2nd knight, gloves. (forgive me if I have switched these, can&#39;t remember which dropped what)<br/>
<br/>
So, My advice to young bards, Get a map, enter Guk, go invis, trot down to Lower Guk and wait. I could have looted 2 more gloves and greaves from corpses at the exit. Plus, even if you can&#39;t complete the quests just yet, the gloves(AC 7,+5poison Wt5) and greaves(AC 10,+5disease,Wt7.7) are nice (plus they look cool).<br/>
