 </span></blockquote>Are you serious about this?  You can&#39;t be.<br/>
How can you say &#39;starts to attack your L10 party?&#39;.  One round and<br/>
you guys would be all but dead!  In the time it takes for the mage<br/>
to stop meditating and stand up, he would be dead.<br/>
You sound like you are saying &#39;if you can get away in the first<br/>
round or two of battle, you&#39;ll be OK&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I say, &#39;if you say for the first round of battle, chances are you<br/>
will die&#39;.  Given the amount of time it takes to physically turn<br/>
and run, equip instruments and fire up songs, you have LITTLE<br/>
chance of survival at L10.  Hell, I&#39;m L13 and have only survived<br/>
once, and that was because I had accelerando and the drum going<br/>
already!<br/>
<br/>
In my experience there are only two types of encounter your group<br/>
can have with a super-monolith (side note - to me &#39;mob&#39; means<br/>
&#39;more than one&#39;, monolith means &#39;one big one&#39;) such as an SG.<br/>
Either you see it coming and keep out of its way, or you don&#39;t<br/>
and a large proportion (approaching 100%) of your party gets<br/>
squished.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen an SG coming, equipped my drum and fired up accelerando,<br/>
turned and run, and STILL been squished!<br/>
