<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653328494"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;In a Roleplaying sense the Guise of the Deceiver was also abused<br/>
&gt;in its former anyone can get it form.  A paladin would never<br/>
&gt;concent to hide their valor, a cleric would be confident in their<br/>
&gt;god to see them through, etc about the only other classes the<br/>
&gt;MIGHT have had a roleplaying cause for the mask would have been<br/>
&gt;enchanters and magicians and that is iffy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um. Enchanters get Illusion:Dark Elf themselves. They don&#39;t need a silly<br/>
item<br/>
to do this. They would have loved the charisma of course... but not being<br/>
able to equip it would have stumped that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any particular reason that druids, etc would NOT want to look<br/>
like<br/>
a dark elf, though. ROLEPLAYING-wise. Sometimes it is useful to be able to<br/>
appear<br/>
other than what you are. Unless you have a specific reason to be more<br/>
honorable<br/>
in your dealings (The ONLY one I think that can be proven here, is paladins)<br/>
The only reason that one would have a roleplaying reason not to is if,<br/>
because<br/>
of your class, it would be considered dishonorable to be other than who you<br/>
are.<br/>
Perhaps a wood elf would not want to be a dark elf, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But I do not think you can generalize this way across all.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, maybe Verant only wants bards and rogues to be able to become dark<br/>
elves -- but they have created different ways for you to turn yourself<br/>
into such things as fire elementals that are not bard/rogue only so<br/>
it is obviously not the case that changing in general is a bad thing for<br/>
other classses.<br/>
