 </span></blockquote>If you look at the histograms, you can see it&#39;s obvious the<br/>
sample size is not big enough.  Except for the peaks at 2x<br/>
weapon damage (very odd indeed, I have a couple theories on<br/>
that brewing...), basically there is no pattern.  If he ran a<br/>
standard deviation on his damage values, I suspect it&#39;d be<br/>
pretty clear the st. dev. exceeds the damage variation for<br/>
different str/dex values (which is another way of saying your<br/>
results are statistically insignificant - you need a variation<br/>
of at least 3 st. dev. to be significant, i.e. less than a 5%<br/>
probability of occurring due to random chance).<br/>
