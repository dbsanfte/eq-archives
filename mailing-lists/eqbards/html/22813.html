<div id="ygrps-yiv-370373432">Well, I&#39;d love to make some suggestions but what you have is as good or in<br/>
most cases better than what I am wearing at 33.  In some cases much better.<br/>
About the only suggestion I have is that you might want to do the Kerran Toy<br/>
quest as the AC from the toy is more useful than the Runed Bone Fork unless<br/>
you are fighting a lot of casters.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Armor and Weapon Advice<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello all. I have been playing EQ very sparingly the last few months. <br/>
I was wondering if I could some equipment/weapon advice (or point me <br/>
to a post, etc..) for my bard.<br/>
<br/>
I am on the Rathe, Level 30 almost 31. I should be able to hit 32<br/>
next week. I would like to try and get XP and a chance at upgrading my <br/>
stuff. I don&#39;t have a lot of cash either. I am currently in Cazic <br/>
Thule going between the Temple and TR&#39;s whereever I can find a group <br/>
(it&#39;s fun going from Main Tank, to healer (only healer at one point), <br/>
to crowd control).<br/>
<br/>
If any of you can suggest some upgrades and price ranges I would <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I have:<br/>
<br/>
Weapons<br/>
Blade of Fiery Lamentations (Dam: 5,Del: 18, Proc: Fiery Fingers)<br/>
Obsidian Shard (Dam: 6, Del: 25, Proc: Obsidian Shard)<br/>
