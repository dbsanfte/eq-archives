<b>Subject:</b> Is there a usable list of bard songs? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-150352991">I am looking for a real list that describes the actual effects of the <br/>
bard songs.  I am tired of +attack spd, +AC, dmg etc.  Chant of Battle <br/>
and Anthem de Arms are almost indestinguishable in effect as far as I <br/>
can tell and with no detailed description I have no clue when one is <br/>
better to use then the other.  Chord of Dissonance gives me no <br/>
indication of much much dmg I do and if I choose not to juggle then I <br/>
give up STR and AC to use it.  <br/>
<br/>
Basically I am trying to decide what the right song or combination of <br/>
songs to use are based on the situation and verant (I hate them) gives <br/>
us no idea what the songs actually do.  As most of our songs work on <br/>
the group as a whole it is nearly impossible to determine whether I am <br/>
helping or my teammates or if they just happen to be making good die <br/>
rolls.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I have just taken to juggling between anthem, chant, and CoD <br/>
while wading into battle.  Just made 12th but have not purchased many <br/>
songs above 7th lvl.  Asside from healing (with mandolin) during or <br/>
after battle my groups have not been overly enthused about the bard <br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy with the class have intrument and song juggling down pat be <br/>
have no clue as to when to sing and wade in or stand back and play?<br/>
<br/>
One last note is it true that song 11 and 14 do not work.  If so that <br/>
really blows.  We only get 1 song a level (most of which are truely <br/>
useless I only use 4 songs now and I am 12th level for cripes sake and <br/>
now I get double screwed at 11 and 14th?!?<br/>
