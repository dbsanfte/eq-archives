<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800608260">The Lvl 51 spell also has invisibility. Invisibility drops when you fight. <br/>
Thus, the song drops. This is consistent with how invisibility works.<br/>
(Also, scale of wolf, the faster SoW, is specifically designed to<br/>
work like invisibility, and not to be used while fighting.)<br/>
<br/>
Windsong keeps Selo&#39;s up for when she&#39;s fighting and only uses the 51 for <br/>
traveling.<br/>

&gt;Last night, I was tracking and pulling in Trakanons. At first was <br/>
&gt;using my Selos drum and out running the mobs thus losing them. So <br/>
&gt;I switched to weps and was slow enough but noticed something.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;When you get attacked or attack something, while playing SSoT <br/>
&gt;(song of travel), the effect drops immediately. And you have to <br/>
&gt;re-key it to get going again. It looks like it will be un-workable <br/>
&gt;for fighting mobs if it drops as soon as you key anything else. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Anyhow, I was trying to pull some named spectre/skell thing who <br/>
&gt;had a pet and was getting whacked pretty good so i started to run. <br/>
&gt;But with the song dropping and the pet on me, I did not quite make <br/>
&gt;it far enough away. I got low health and a random froogie agro&#39;d <br/>
&gt;and I died - ugh. </span></blockquote></div>
