<div id="ygrps-yiv-313216111">DEX and CHA are checked to start a song. Each song has a difficulty%<br/>
associated with it. The higher your DEX+CHA is, the more you&#39;ll succeed at<br/>
singing. The higher your level is, the more you&#39;ll succeed also. Some songs<br/>
are harder than others, but will become trivial (still 5% or so minimum<br/>
failure rate) with some more levels.<br/>
For combat DEX only affects the procs of weapons (and works like strentgh<br/>
for ranged weapons, ie. increases the damage dealt upon a successful hit,<br/>
which we don&#39;t care much about).<br/>
CHA is used to modify the succes rate of the mesmerize / charm and memory<br/>
blur spells, and thus our songs.<br/>
So if you wanna be best at crowd control, raise CHA over DEX. If you wanna<br/>
deal more damage do the opposite and use procing weapons. Best bet is to<br/>
have 2 sets of equipment.<br/>
 <br/>
On the other stats now, namely STR, AGI and AC. The to hit % is ONLY skill<br/>
based (ie. depends on the your level and the MOB&#39;s, along with the<br/>
defense/offense/dodge/parry/riposte skills), with the exception of AC (which<br/>
is also factored in that calculation). So raise AC to get hit less (you also<br/>
need to get your defensive skill maxed but I guess that each and every bard<br/>
maxes them pretty fast, ahem). STR will make the attacker hit for more upon<br/>
a successfull hit and AGI will lower the damage taken by the target. These<br/>
are not worthless stats, though I think CHA / DEX and AC are 1st priority.<br/>

Hail and well met everyone!!<br/>
<br/>
One question today:<br/>
<br/>
My guildmates, namely 2 monks, 2 paladins, and our resident rogue have begun<br/>
formulating a rather distressing theory of late.  They seem to all be of the<br/>
opinion that the only real stats that matter are AC and STR (and agility for<br/>
the monks).  Now before anyone begins to think these people are soft in the<br/>
head, these are all very intelligent players.  The monks are 30 and 38<br/>
respectively, the paladins are 33 and 35, and the rogue (the guild&#39;s most<br/>
valuable asset by far) just chimed hell level one (30) last night.  Can<br/>
their theory be right?  If so, I just spent the better part of 3 months<br/>
getting items for AGI and DEX, all the while sacrificing most of my STR gear<br/>
and quite a bit of AC, for naught.  <br/>
    <br/>
From what this list has told me, CHA and DEX are our main attributes<br/>
correct?  So what exactly does our AGI work towards?  And if DEX is so<br/>
important in starting songs, then how do I still miss 2 notes per battle<br/>
with 130 DEX?  Should I ditch the AGI stuff and move back to STR and even<br/>
more CHA stuff?  Any input would be greatly appreciated!</div>
