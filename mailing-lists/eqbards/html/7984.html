 Melee range, or perhaps a bit more.  Very short, shorter than Hymn (or<br/>
 even with, I don&#39;t recall).  It&#39;s for this reason I prefer Chords or<br/>
 Denon&#39;s to bellow, as the overall damage inflicted is greater.  It&#39;s not<br/>
 as noticeable since you don&#39;t get the instant hit report, but there&#39;s<br/>
 definitely more of it (especially if you swap in your lute between swings<br/>
 ;). &gt;&gt;<br/>

Actually its a good deal more than melee range, ise use these two all the <br/>
time to kite multiple aviaks and the only tim ei get hurt is when i make a <br/>
bad turn. </span></blockquote></div>
