From a purely ratio perspective, I can&#39;t imagine any weapon is going to make<br/>
you a high agro magnet.  Your song choices have way more effect on mob agro<br/>
thatn even dual wielding moss twigs would have.  It&#39;s not like you have<br/>
double attack.<br/>

            Last night in Karnor Dog Tower I won the lotto for a Jade Mace<br/>
(9/18) (was a huge argument attached - and at 1:45 AM I was pretty grouchy -<br/>
but I got it in the end)<br/>
<br/>
            Anywho - a buddy Warrior of mine was concerned that it&#39;s high<br/>
rate might make me an aggro mob magnet<br/>
