&gt; IMHO it would be interesting if you could add some stat data from these<br/>
&gt; logs for &quot;missed notes&quot; maybe we get something nice here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There were only about 30 missed notes in the latter logfile,<br/>
which probably means the sample is way to small to see a trend<br/>
for missed notes.  Missed notes is probably one of the easiest<br/>
things to test though - just get your stats in the<br/>
configuration you want to test, turn on your logfile, then<br/>
rapidly stop/start a song over and over.  Don&#39;t even wait for<br/>
the song to actually start playing, since you&#39;ll get the<br/>
missed note message afterwards.  Then count up the number of<br/>
&quot;your song ends&quot; messages (successes), and compare with the<br/>
number of missed notes (failures).<br/>
