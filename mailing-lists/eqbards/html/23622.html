<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-525502312">My apologies for dropping any threads and not staying current. Our SDSL ISP<br/>
dumped us a couple weeks ago with no warning; getting email in and out has <br/>
been problematical. They went under and didn&#39;t notify the customers prior to<br/>
service termination. <br/>
<br/>
Sharkskin drum: This was actually patched some time ago, I forgot about it<br/>
til I got ingame after our drum discussion and realized it has a drum/stick<br/>
graphic now. It&#39;s no longer a lute graphic. <br/>
<br/>
Mediocre players: Playing my baby cleric (L9) last night and get asked to<br/>
heal a bard twink. When I stand up, I see he&#39;s singing Hymn. Where&#39;s your<br/>
lute, boy? Yep, this guy will be a good bard, you can just tell . . .<br/>
Another bard twink I saw the other day was clearly singing Selos and running<br/>
a distance that made me really wonder why he didn&#39;t equip a drum. I would<br/>
have in the same circumstances. Maybe I&#39;m just a speed freak though.  I<br/>
think I&#39;ll learn to be a good cleric though, after all, I sit right beside a<br/>
master, hehe. I can count on him providing feedback! <br/>
<br/>
The FAQ: Talies, in reference to the last question, don&#39;t have a 49th song<br/>
now? Melody of Ervaj from Velious is listed as being 49th level. And<br/>
speaking of the issues of bad bards, wonder if we could get that fabulous<br/>
FAQ posted on the Concert Hall. It might possibly help the new crop of<br/>
bardlings.<br/>
<br/>
Weapons bards: I&#39;m primarily a weapons bard. I go to instruments primarily<br/>
on big raids. Typically, my normal experience group is tank light, so I tank<br/>
and sing. We almost never have a warrior or paladin in the group unless it&#39;s<br/>
a raid. Our clerics use Divine light much more than CH I&#39;ve noticed. He used<br/>
CH when he got is but now DL seems to be much preferred. I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
similar leveled clerics seem to prefer it as well. I was instrument barding<br/>
the other weekend in HS front room since we had a pally to tank, but the<br/>
cleric decided it was taking the pally too long to kill stuff! &quot;Get your<br/>
swords and get in there, bard!&quot; We ended up holding the front room with me,<br/>
a robo&#39;ed mage, and enc and a cleric.  I was using Twilight on the mobs<br/>
right after the enc finished his spells on the pulls, (slow, etc) and he<br/>
observed things were less likely to try and eat him first when we got the<br/>
timing right. Anyone else have this experience? <br/>
<br/>
CC: I&#39;ve done quite a bit of CC in the front room of HS. I don&#39;t know of any<br/>
zone out there, was told there was none. Also, I had 3 mobs mezzed and one<br/>
charmed while doing the cleric epic quest segment that takes place inside<br/>
the Sol temple. You have to kill a plasmatic priest that is pretending to be<br/>
a keeper. The trouble is when he goes agro, he tends to aggro some of the<br/>
normal temple residents and they will KS him, making your cleric redo some<br/>
of his quest. We had done this previously with no problem but the second<br/>
time 4 npcs dove into the fight and I CC&#39;ed them to prevent us taking the<br/>
faction hits as well as protect our interest in the priest.<br/>

Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (hoping the new exp changes will ease 54) <br/>
