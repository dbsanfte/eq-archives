&gt;excited about it when I got to 16, but to my dismay,<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t do the dance! :( I even left my computer on,<br/>
&gt;and put my bard in a safe place just so I could max<br/>
&gt;her skill out to see if maybe that was the problem,<br/>
&gt;but it isn&#39;t. Maybe it&#39;s just on some servers that<br/>
&gt;female bards don&#39;t? I&#39;ll ask on my server if this is<br/>
&gt;the case. <br/>

so I was quite pleased when I learned it. Brangwen, is<br/>
it possible that you are playing with the mino horn<br/>
instead of with the flute? It has been told that using<br/>
the mino horn causes the bard not to dance. I can<br/>
understand since blowing through a horn ripped from<br/>
the head of a mino would hardly make me want to dance.<br/>
That is why I play my flute, even when I&#39;m not<br/>
underwater!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

P.S. Anyone know where I can but tall beers? I want to<br/>
make beer braised bear, but can&#39;t find the beer for it.</div>
