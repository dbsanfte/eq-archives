I have no trouble believing that GZ told him this.  The same GZ that told us<br/>
&quot;xyz&quot; was not broken and then later changed his tune when it was<br/>
demonstrated to him.  So, yes, GZ probably did tell him that and yes the<br/>
song makes you &quot;invis&quot; to undead in some places.  You are in their world<br/>
now.  Things can be two different ways at the same time.<br/>

&gt; I seriously doubt GM&#39;s or Verant staff told you that clouding does not<br/>
&gt; effect undead.  We on this list have battled over it for a long time but<br/>
