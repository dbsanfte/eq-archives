I have no trouble believing that GZ told him this.  The same GZ that told us<br/>
&quot;xyz&quot; was not broken and then later changed his tune when it was<br/>
demonstrated to him.  So, yes, GZ probably did tell him that and yes the<br/>
song makes you &quot;invis&quot; to undead in some places.  You are in their world<br/>
now.  Things can be two different ways at the same time.<br/>
