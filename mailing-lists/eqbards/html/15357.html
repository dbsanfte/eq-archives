<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017071844">Take a look at this item:<br/>
<br/>
Cloak of Flames (off Lord Nagafen)<br/>
<br/>
AC 10  Dex +9 Agi +9 HP: +50 sv FIRE +15<br/>
Effect: Haste<br/>
WT: 0.1<br/>
All/All<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so here we have an item that drops off one of the hardest mobs in the<br/>
game.  It should be a pretty good item.  AC 10 for a shoulder slot item is<br/>
&#39;ok&#39; (crafted pauldrons is better; even crested is better). Dex/Agi +9 would<br/>
be damn nice if those stats did anything. HP +50 &lt;cough&gt; what is the HP buff<br/>
from a Bloodstone symbol? Jasper? Peridot? And Sv FIRE + 15 is damn nice but<br/>
were they thinking this will be usefull for camping Naggy?  You need the<br/>
Fire resist before you take Naggy not after &lt;sheesh&gt; And Haste is damn nice<br/>
effect no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like they had some idea about dex/agi/str etc all being meaningful but<br/>
somehow lost something along the way.  Any item boosters they give to HP or<br/>
Mana are all jokes.  Except mana stones - which they scared them selves<br/>
with.  Did GZ &quot;stone down&quot; and kill himself the night before he decides it&#39;s<br/>
too powerfull and should be out of the game???<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like they had some ideas but did not quite get everyone on the same<br/>
page when stuff got coded.<br/>
<br/>
Am I ranting again?<br/>
