<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178064280">I made several trips thru last nite during nite hours.  I got spell blasted<br/>
once (that I didn&#39;t resist by twisting Guardian and Elemental with<br/>
Accellerando).  Otherwise no troubles.  I rescued one poor enchanter whose<br/>
tanks had been killed.  It was fun, though the people in the zone were not<br/>
as friendly as they had been in days past.  There are some truly scary<br/>
things out there, fun though.<br/>
<br/>
Had another instance of Bard hate.  I zoned into Kithicor and ran up to<br/>
where people were camping by W Commons.  I wasn&#39;t going anywhere so I turned<br/>
off all my songs to be sure I didn&#39;t gain any unwanted attention from their<br/>
pulls.  One group pulled a skeleton squad leader.  In the middle of the<br/>
fight he suddenly left their group, ran over to me standing in the<br/>
background (strangely enough he even ran past 2 people who were meditating)<br/>
and whacked me upside the head for 40 odd points.  He then proceeded to Fear<br/>
me.  What bizarre AI convention made him decide to ignore the 5 people<br/>
beating on him, run past two meditators and whack a bard standing behind<br/>
looking around.  Even weirder, why on earth would he fear me?  <br/>
Not once, not twice, but three times he feared me.  Every time it wore off<br/>
and I fled back to the zone line area he would turn, leave the group, run<br/>
over to me and whack me, followed immediately by a Fear spell.  Once I got<br/>
the two MR songs twisted up and resisted him, but the other two times I got<br/>
feared and sent off to wander up the path into the middle of the zone.<br/>
Fortunately the ghoul clerics I waltzed right by while feared ignored me.<br/>
Now that was scary.  Still fun though, kinda like a roller coaster ride.<br/>
When I finally returned the group was arguing amongst themselves as to<br/>
whether I had tried to kill steal from them, but once they learned I was a<br/>
bard they all laughed and said &quot;Oh, sorry that explains it.&quot;  Pretty<br/>
amusing.  Two of them were betting on whether I would come back from each of<br/>
the fearings.  I shoulda got a cut from the guy who bet on me, he won every<br/>
time!<br/>

I don&#39;t see how this applies to Kithicor?  Careful planning should guarantee<br/>
that you don&#39;t die in the woods.  Simply check the time before zoning.  Were<br/>
it only so easy to avoid SG&#39;s...<br/>

&gt; &gt;What fun is it if you are not scared? (The whole game I mean.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See, I am totally from the other school - I have no fun if I AM scared.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, not on a continuous basis at least - that is the difference<br/>
&gt; between a<br/>
&gt; &#39;game&#39;, and immersing yourself into a world. Humans cannot create<br/>
&gt; societies<br/>
&gt; based solely on danger - and this is one lesson Verant refused to learn<br/>
&gt; from other games they studied. They did learn the one about setting one<br/>
&gt; group of players up to be fodder for another group - but went just a tad<br/>
&gt; overboard in some areas overcompensating with monsters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I for one am NOT amused when I am out happily gathering silk - or hides -<br/>
&gt; to be wacked in the back of the head by a sand giant or griffin.<br/>
&gt; If I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a hope of fighting back - thats not fun, thats not scary,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s pking<br/>
&gt; via monster. Death may be an inconvience at most - but I just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like to<br/>
&gt; die - for starters - it tends to break the fantasy - I will avoid death<br/>
&gt; whenever possible by cautious hunting and careful planning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got like 40 days on my bard played - and only lvl 23 - don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; particularly care if I EVER get to lvl 50 - my main goal in life<br/>
&gt; was not to<br/>
&gt; be jumped by everything and it&#39;s brother while I was going about my normal<br/>
&gt; business. And yes - my bard can outrun most of this stuff - IF I don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; disconnected (which happens to me with annoying frequency - 6 times<br/>
&gt; yesterday). I also play an enchanter a bit - we as bards may be fast - but<br/>
&gt; a lot of classes don&#39;t have that kind of native defenses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was in Oasis last night with my enchanter - having ubermonsters (to low<br/>
&gt; levels) in the mix also provides the perfect material for high level grief<br/>
&gt; players to work with - was getting trained by specters on the average of<br/>
&gt; every 5 min - for about an hour and a half. Petitioned and<br/>
&gt; petitioned - did<br/>
&gt; a /who all gm - one GM and about 4 guides all on their asses in the plane<br/>
&gt; of air.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play safe - and I pick my battles - I just don&#39;t like idiots being given<br/>
&gt; the tools to do this, or being blindsided by something in an otherwise low<br/>
&gt; level zone that I can&#39;t even scratch. Guess I don&#39;t find running for my<br/>
&gt; life scary OR fun.<br/>
