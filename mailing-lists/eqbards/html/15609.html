<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341084557">Its things like this that make me wonder if vigilantes are really a bad<br/>
thing.  How can people still doubt the existence of evil after hearing about<br/>
incidents like this?<br/>

It could be worse, at least this is just a game. But I totally understand<br/>
your frustration. I consent to people all the time and cross my fingers. I<br/>
usually will only consent to someone in a reputable guild, but that&#39;s no<br/>
guarantee anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Just to put things into perspective:<br/>
<br/>
I just heard on the radio on my way into work that last night a woman was<br/>
cutoff and hit the back of this guys SUV. He got out of his SUV, she rolled<br/>
down her window, he reaches in, grabs her dog from her lap and throws it<br/>
into traffic, where it is killed.<br/>

Some people are just plain mean.<br/>

&gt; Yes, that is pretty normal. You can only imagine the number <br/>
&gt; of /petitions<br/>
&gt; that get filed every night.  I get loads of crazy  requests <br/>
&gt; from people.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes they start out: what items do you need for Lambent <br/>
&gt; Helm?  Followed<br/>
&gt; by: do you have any for sale?  Then: can you come help me get <br/>
&gt; one?  This is<br/>
&gt; from people totally out of the blue &lt;no pun intended&gt; and <br/>
&gt; then I go /anon<br/>
&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;.  &quot;Sorry, I am kinda tied up here with these Fire <br/>
&gt; Giants and cant<br/>
&gt; come help you right now....&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But any how - keep talking to the guides and GM and be calm <br/>
&gt; and nice but<br/>
&gt; persistent.  They can restore you to a point prior to your <br/>
&gt; incident.  There<br/>
&gt; is a lot of discretionary room for guides and gm&#39;s.  Keep <br/>
&gt; talking to them<br/>
&gt; and eventually you should get some help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would love to see someone who is a real life attorney or <br/>
&gt; has some bucks to<br/>
&gt; hire one go after these loot item stealers.  Subpoena Verant <br/>
&gt; for the real<br/>
&gt; life name of the loot thief and file both criminal charges <br/>
&gt; and civil suit.<br/>
&gt; That sot&#39;s local newspapers would have a field day with a <br/>
&gt; story like that.<br/>
&gt; The thieves (and/or the farmer&#39;s) have established &quot;real - <br/>
&gt; life&quot; value of<br/>
&gt; these items by selling them for cash on e-bay.  &quot;Your honor <br/>
&gt; and esteemed<br/>
&gt; members of the jury, I beg your patience in this matter but I <br/>
&gt; must show you<br/>
&gt; what grievous mental anguish my client would suffer if she <br/>
&gt; were to have to<br/>
&gt; endure another Ykesha camp.  Now this may take a few hours so get<br/>
&gt; comfortable and watch....And remember she had TWO of the <br/>
&gt; items stolen!  OMG!<br/>
&gt; Lord with a Sword!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s only a matter of time before this will happen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the meantime, be nice but persistent and stay in contact <br/>
&gt; with your guides<br/>
&gt; and GM&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I did report it and was told there was nothing that <br/>
&gt; could be (or<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; be) done about the situation.  However, at the end of the <br/>
&gt; night, the gm<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally asked that I write her an email explaining the situation.<br/>
&gt; Hopefully<br/>
&gt; &gt; that will help matters.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The character who actually stole it was Razel, although he <br/>
&gt; said it was his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;friend&quot; Bonewalker who was playing Razel and stole the <br/>
&gt; items.  I am told<br/>
&gt; &gt; that Razel is actually a good guy and was taken advantage <br/>
&gt; of as well but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just don&#39;t know what to believe.<br/>
