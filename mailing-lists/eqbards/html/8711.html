<div id="ygrps-yiv-891386348">I would guess that in the case of the Bard items, which with the exception of<br/>
th lambent stones, are not needed by any other classes, would be free from most<br/>
people.  The items are not useful to anyone high enough level to kill the<br/>
associated mobs (assuming they are not bards).  There are not a large enough<br/>
number of bards to create a demand.  Chances are if you hang out long enough,<br/>
or make some friends of appropriate level, you can get the NODROP items for<br/>
free. (once all the high level bards that CAN kill the mobs are gone)  <br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
