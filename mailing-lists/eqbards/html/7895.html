<div id="ygrps-yiv-395930397">I bet this is the way it is.  I tried hitting my 35th level monk friend with<br/>
a newbie ranger in the Arena in Qeynos and logged it.  343 attacks and zero<br/>
hits.  We want to try again with 10 or so newbies and see if there is an AC<br/>
reduction for multiple attackers!<br/>

Well yes, but I was thinking more in terms of 1000 AC vs 1 Atk<br/>
not being 100% guaranteed to prevent being hit, while at the<br/>
same time 1 AC vs. 1000 Atk does not 100% guarantee a<br/>
successful hit.  If you went with straight subtraction, you&#39;d<br/>
have to apply a cutoff, beyond which extra AC or Atk just<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter.  The few pieces of EQ&#39;s underlying number<br/>
system strongly suggests Verant wouldn&#39;t go for such a simple<br/>
solution.<br/>
