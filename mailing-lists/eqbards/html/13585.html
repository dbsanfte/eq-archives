playing without an enchanter now. High level Bards are real rare on our<br/>
server at high levels and there&#39;s only a couple of good ones. &lt;Hi Downs&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You mean while standing? I don&#39;t think so but I haven&#39;t tried any<br/>
quantative tests. It is definately faster even standing though. Standing<br/>
with clarity and the bard song playing my mana bar definately goes up a<br/>
lot faster than without either. I can run the entire distance across W<br/>
Karana (with SoW) with neither and not notice any movement in my mana<br/>
bar, yet one time standing up in the Froglok King room summoning food I<br/>
gained a half a bubble of mana in the time it took me to summon 5 food.<br/>

Also, dispite what GZ said about pixie strike not being broken, it looks<br/>
like they may have changed it recently. Our guild bard wanted to duel my<br/>
druid while we were standing around last week after the patch and he<br/>
basically locked me up with pixie strike. I wasn&#39;t able to move once if<br/>
I got the message and icon. This is considerably different from my tests<br/>
with the song months ago.<br/>
