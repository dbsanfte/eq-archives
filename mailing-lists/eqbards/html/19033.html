<div id="ygrps-yiv-277992698">Some people are just willing to pay a &quot;large&quot; amount of money for online<br/>
gaming.  I played a LOT of Multiplayer Battletech on GEnie in the<br/>
pre-Internet days. (Early-mid-90&#39;s)  GEnie charged $6.00 (eventually lowered<br/>
to $3.00) an hour - and the only dialup number was far enough from my house<br/>
where I had to pay the phone company by the minutes as well (.10 on off<br/>
hours - but that would add up as well).<br/>
<br/>
I easily paid $100-$300 a month...<br/>

&gt; I think that some people, not in the US, pay per minute for their<br/>
&gt; internet access.  So they download the digest version...and if everyone<br/>
&gt; were to not clip the junk it would add up to a noticable degree..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However...I have always wondered how they can afford to be into<br/>
&gt; EQ with such a connection..:)<br/>
