 </span></blockquote>You hit it right on the head Tani.  How many times do you hear people <br/>
say, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know bards could do that!&quot;  I don&#39;t know about you <br/>
all, but I hear that quite a bit.  And it doesn&#39;t surprise me that <br/>
usually, those are the people that say play mana song during the <br/>
fights!<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me of a recent mana song story of mine... I was playing <br/>
with a guild that we have an alliance with in Sebilis.  We did <br/>
Sebilis all weekend with pretty much the same group of people.  Some <br/>
rotated, but all were in the same guild.  One night, we had 2-3 <br/>
clerics in the group at a given time.  One in particular was telling <br/>
me to keep playing mana song when he would go OOM.  Now, I don&#39;t know <br/>
about you guys, but when I have more than one cleric in the group <br/>
with one OOM and 2 frogs on us, I&#39;m not going to stop singing just <br/>
for mana song.  So he keeps going on about it and I just ignore him, <br/>
then finally he says it in caps.  I immediatley say &quot;CHILL OUT!  I&#39;M <br/>
SINGING WHAT I SHOULD BE!&quot;  I usually tell them to not worry about <br/>
what I&#39;m singing and I won&#39;t tell them how to play.  That usually <br/>
shuts them up ;)<br/>
<br/>
The second day, the group decided that the 56 wiz would do better <br/>
crowd control with root than I could do.  So, I agree to try it <br/>
because I have never been to the Gang beetle room so don&#39;t know what <br/>
to expect.  Well, needless to say, we failed that more than once <br/>
before I could explain that I could do a way better job after <br/>
noticing they are all blues.  After the weekend, I reflected back and <br/>
realized that their guild no longer has a bard in it!  Rokenn was <br/>
their only high level bard until he switched servers!  It seemed to <br/>
me that they thought bards were only good for buffing resists and <br/>
mana.  Hey Rokenn!  You should&#39;ve done a better job at teaching those <br/>
folks what we are all about, lol!  ;)  JK Rok. I guess I get the fun <br/>
task of teaching them.  Or maybe Rokenn tried and they are just <br/>
hopeless, lol!  No, they are a great guild, but they just don&#39;t <br/>
understand a bard&#39;s power... just as Tani said.<br/>
