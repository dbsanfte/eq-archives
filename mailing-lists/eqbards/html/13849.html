<div id="ygrps-yiv-633491968"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Has anyone killed and looted the bards in the guilds? <br/>
&gt; I know it flies in the face of &quot;RP&quot;, but I know for<br/>
&gt; sure there are several Guild Masters holding lutes.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t think of any holding trumpets though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I just said that like several posts back, heh.<br/>
<br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t suggest taking the faction hits either, get a handful<br/>
  of DE necros to hang out at the zoneline, and have a monk FD pull<br/>
  each of the bards to the zoneline.  You just stand around ready to<br/>
  lute, err loot ;)<br/>
