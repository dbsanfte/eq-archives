<div id="ygrps-yiv-298024411">As of late Friday night, ALL bard quests are working properly.  at least one<br/>
of every piece has been obtained on my server.  If you are on the bottom<br/>
floor where the bard NPCs are, go up the ramp on the lava and through the<br/>
back door, then make a right and curve around through about 3 steel double<br/>
doors and Genni is there.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I acquired the fixin&#39;s for two of the bard quests (arms and<br/>
&gt; boots), but when I got to the Temple, another bard told me <br/>
&gt; that all the<br/>
&gt; bard quests were broken, according to a GM, and that nobody could find<br/>
&gt; Genni, the person who makes the lambent gems, anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did people have trouble making any of the pieces of armour besides the<br/>
&gt; previously mentioned breastplate problems? <br/>
