level 56 SK in my guild does 1400 hp of damage with his harmtouch. That&#39;s<br/>
over 3x the damage of dirge.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; harmtouch would have to do more than twice as <br/>
&gt; much damage as dirge <br/>
&gt; and you must only get a single target with dirge every time <br/>
&gt; in order for this to be true.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i think it is in fact more than 2X damage, especially with it being resisted<br/>
less (now disease based) and with the disc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how many other classes are not extremely unimportant on <br/>
&gt; raids?  clerics, warriors,<br/>
&gt; rogues?  any others?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>shaman (HP buffs), enchanter (haste/clarity/crowd control), paladin (divine<br/>
strength), monk (huge damage, pulling) are all extremely important.  yes 200<br/>
extra HP from a 60 paladin on every person makes a huge difference, and no<br/>
bards can not do crowd control on these raids with the number of targets<br/>
exceeding our mes and charm caps.  that&#39;s 7 out of 12 that are extremely<br/>
important.  important are magician (pet damage, dispel staffs, CotH), necro<br/>
(pet damage, mana pump), wizard (spell damage, much less important in SoV<br/>
but were hugely important in Kunark). not important are SK and bard.  hell i<br/>
could be completely off on all of this, i&#39;m not the guildleader just a<br/>
grunt.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; except<br/>
&gt; for the few people in uber guilds who only go on raids, what <br/>
&gt; is the percentage of raids to<br/>
&gt; &#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39; hunting?  maybe 90/10?  so if we&#39;re overpowered in <br/>
&gt; 90% of the game and underpowered<br/>
&gt; in 10%, doesn&#39;t that work out to being overpowered as a class?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>let&#39;s not get into percentages again, cause as you said percentages don&#39;t<br/>
matter when it is yourself in the minority.  for me, it is completely<br/>
opposite, with 90% of my time on raids, 10% grouping/exp&#39;ing.  maybe even<br/>
more skewed than that. and for the 60s in our guild, which is almost<br/>
everyone, their time is spent 100% on raids, 0% exp&#39;ing.  what else are you<br/>
going to do when you hit 60?  and every time you level isn&#39;t that what you<br/>
are one step closer towards?<br/>
