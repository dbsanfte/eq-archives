<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144281039">Sense and Disarm Traps<br/>
 <br/>
In addition to rogues, bards, who always had the ability to disarm traps,<br/>
have gained the ability to sense them as well.  Since we are aware that some<br/>
may have not bothered training sense or disarm traps due to them formerly<br/>
being unimplemented, bards and rogues will have the ability to gain skill<br/>
without training once they have reached the appropriate level and have<br/>
crossed a zone boundary.<br/>
 <br/>
These skills now have use within Velious.  There are traps, and they range<br/>
from annoying to deadly throughout Velious.  They are invisible and can only<br/>
be detected and disarmed by rogues and bard.  <br/>
 <br/>
Use &quot;Sense Traps&quot; to see if there are any traps in the vicinity.  If so, you<br/>
can then use &quot;Disarm traps&quot; to try and disarm the trap.  Once disarmed, the<br/>
trap will remain inactive for a short period of time (about a minute) while<br/>
your group passes through the area.  <br/>
 <br/>
If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be<br/>
directed towards the closest one.  <br/>
