<b>Subject:</b> Do I have enough strength? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654721494">I have a base strength of 85.  I took 85 because a friend of mine is a high<br/>
elf paladin and seems to be able to wear bronze.  I am a half elf and<br/>
figured 85 strength would be plenty since you can get +strength items if<br/>
need be.  Did I make a mistake?<br/>
