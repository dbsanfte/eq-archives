<div id="ygrps-yiv-394340881">Ummm...  This has been thoroughly researched by many of us on this <br/>
     list.  It seems to effect how often the bar is refreshed but does not <br/>
     actually improve the speed of mana regeneration.  We have conducted <br/>
     many tests with stopwatches and such.  In fact we have beat the <br/>
     subject to death..  (he he)  It doesn&#39;t help at all.  Period.  We WISH <br/>
     it did, in fact it would be a great way to cure the level 15 to 32 no <br/>
     one wants to party with Bards blues but, sigh, it is not to be. Trust <br/>
     us, that web site is wrong.<br/>

Greetings all,<br/>
     <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that nobody seems to know how Jaxan&#39;s Jig can be helpful... one <br/>
of the websites mentioned that it increases the recovery pulse rate for all <br/>
three bars (not just stamina) from approximately 8sec/pulse to 6 sec/pulse.  <br/>
So what? Well, what this means is:<br/>
     <br/>
- If you are in a party with casters, they get a 20-25% increase on mana <br/>
regen <br/>
  (this has been independently verified with a cleric)<br/>
- If you are in a party with other bards, your healing songs should <br/>
increase at the <br/>
  same rate (haven&#39;t tested this one) <br/>
     <br/>
Just the first one alone, along with psalm and selo&#39;s, make you an even <br/>
more critical member of a party.  Some bards, when presented with this <br/>
information, say &quot;but that makes my mana regen song useless,&quot; and so won&#39;t <br/>
even try it.  Of course, the mana regen song is, what, 50%?  So it&#39;s still <br/>
an upgrade.  But bards who don&#39;t take advantage of this &quot;side effect&quot; of <br/>
Jaxan&#39;s are, in my opinion, slighting themselves and their party.<br/>
     <br/>
Anyhow, just thought I&#39;d share :-)<br/>
