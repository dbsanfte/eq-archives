<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238159651">Even at lvl 20, I don&#39;t think that warsong is useful for group work,<br/>
unless I am in an all caster group, and I don&#39;t really care about<br/>
buffing my teamates.  Though in that situation I now use the triple<br/>
damage combo with instruments to keep all the baddies taunted on me. <br/>
(That is chords, discord and bellow, though I may replace bellow with<br/>
binding now that I have it).<br/>
<br/>
WHen I want to melee solo that when warsong is great (and it is great<br/>
for that).<br/>
<br/>
In a group, I hope theres somthing better for me to do that buff up my<br/>
(pretty pathetic) damage a bit.  Even in my two bard group over thw<br/>
eeekend, I found better things to do...  (He did anthem and the<br/>
approprate rhythms, I did binding, hymm, and discord)<br/>
