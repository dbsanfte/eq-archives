<div id="ygrps-yiv-873199903">Hmm, I wasn&#39;t pulling so I doubt many Sarnak&#39;s were seeing me (except<br/>
the ones we were killing).  Though perhaps my song was pulsing when they<br/>
saw the puller (Though I rarely had the song going while he was<br/>
pulling).  <br/>

Since apparantly their agro radius is as far as you(they) can see in the<br/>
zone, then that explains the huge agro radius I was wondering about<br/>
yesterday.  I played around for about an hour yesterday (found the<br/>
bank!) and killed a few iksars, and they did not have the agro radius of<br/>
Sarnaks, so I had assumed it was just the one creature.<br/>
