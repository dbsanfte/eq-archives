<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025541511">I have found my guild invaluable in getting a group together.  Many times<br/>
now we have too many set to group up and have to split up.  we aren&#39;t quite<br/>
your levels yet but are getting close.  I am 21st and our SK is 22nd.  The<br/>
rest are 19 or so.  I think there are places that 3 would be enough however.<br/>
The king pit is an unusual case in that I have seen groups of 6 fail to hold<br/>
it, and group of three hold it easily.  The group of three I saw take out<br/>
the High Priest was 26bard, 30 Paladin, 28 wiz.  The bard sat back and only<br/>
played songs.  With the double MR boost they said they only failed to resist<br/>
one spell from the High Priest, a root on the Paladin.  Between the wiz and<br/>
Paladin they had no trouble killing the High Priest that I could see.  They<br/>
did get in trouble later when 3 gobs spawned at once, but a wandering shaman<br/>
saved their bacon with a few timely heals.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is my biggest problem with the game.  I&#39;m level 28 and up until<br/>
this point, my boyfriend and I could just go around and hunt in a pair<br/>
and make decent exp.  Together, we have acquired a full set of crafted<br/>
for him and an almost complete set of lambent for myself (I&#39;m missing<br/>
the helm, bp, and boots right now).  Yes, for some of this, we joined<br/>
a larger group or, in his case, bought 2 or 3 pieces that we couldn&#39;t<br/>
get ourselves.  Lately, we&#39;ve had a wizard from my guild join us, so I<br/>
basically have a regular 3 person group.  This is not enough to do<br/>
much of anything anymore.  At our level (my 28, wiz 28, bf 30) ,<br/>
there&#39;s not much to kill outdoors and breaking into a decent spot in a<br/>
dungeon requires a full group.  So, here&#39;s my little grouping<br/>
mini-rant.  Two nights ago, we took over the Permafrost king room from<br/>
a level 50 who was looking for a cloak.  I sat in a preacher room<br/>
group until the rest showed up; the rest being my 2 regulars and a<br/>
friend of the wizard who had grouped with us a couple of times before.<br/>
We waited at least 2 hours to take the room over, not counting the<br/>
time it took them to get a teleport from Unrest to North Karana and<br/>
run to Permafrost.  Once the room was secured, we were fine.  An honor<br/>
guard spawned with a 2 hander and we let the wiz&#39;s roll, since they<br/>
had helped us out before and hadn&#39;t really gotten any of the good<br/>
stuff.  The non-regular won, and shortly thereafter, deserted us while<br/>
we were trying to find his replacement.  Note to self:  my regular<br/>
group is not enough to hold the room.  The high priest spawned and<br/>
killed all 3 of us, starting with the nuker.  After corpse retrieval,<br/>
with the help of a really nice level 47 druid from my guild, it was<br/>
12:30am and I was back where I started for the night.  <br/>
<br/>
This is typical of my experiences lately.  Either we can&#39;t find enough<br/>
people to take a room in a dungeon or we can, but can&#39;t find a room to<br/>
take.  And once we finally take the room, someone has to leave so<br/>
we either have to find a replacement quickly or leave the room<br/>
ourselves.  At least most people who have to leave warn us enough<br/>
ahead of time that the new person arrives as soon as they disband. <br/>
I&#39;ve started to feel like I&#39;m wasting my time playing. Sure,<br/>
occasionally I&#39;ll have a really great time (Gnomestock was a blast,<br/>
and once I was in a group killing the diplomat in Permafrost which was<br/>
great), but those times are few and far between now.  Even being in a<br/>
guild doesn&#39;t seem to help much...Does anyone have any ideas on how to<br/>
make this feel more worthwhile?  <br/>
