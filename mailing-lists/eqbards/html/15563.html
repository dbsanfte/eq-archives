<br/>
Welcome to the wonderful world of groups!  &quot;So, who&#39;s twink are you?&quot; Hehe,<br/>
at least it&#39;s a bit better these days because there is the very real chance<br/>
that you will be fighting with someone who really does have a level 50 char<br/>
and maybe they have some clue as to how to work in a group.<br/>
<br/>
Speed, AC, HP, & resists are things that really matter.  Look at your song<br/>
list and see what you have to raise these for your party and lower them for<br/>
your enemy.<br/>
<br/>
It kind of depends on what other classes are in your party to define what<br/>
role you should fill.  Bards are versatile so you can kind of fill in the<br/>
blanks.  If you are tank heavy but healer light, you can use lute and hymn.<br/>
If you have healers and are tank light, I&#39;d go so far as to say use<br/>
whistling war song to maximize your damage output - its 20% attack speed<br/>
increase is significant if you have good weps.  You have claws and they are<br/>
very fast weapons.  As long as your healer can keep you alive - maximize<br/>
your damage output. If you have other tank type, you may settle for Anthem.<br/>
If you go against casters, be sure to use elemental rhythms or the<br/>
appropriate resist song.  Note that they add AC so they are good to twist in<br/>
vs. melee class mobs too.<br/>

&gt; So, I really have been reading these posts and I&#39;m sure these questions<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; been answered but...........<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just starting to group up with more than two people with my Bard.<br/>
What<br/>
&gt; songs are the best to do?  I&#39;ve been using buff song plus hymn for the<br/>
most<br/>
&gt; part....and do most people use their weapons or instruments at my level<br/>
&gt; (20)... I do have a claw and a harpoon from Kedge so I do quite a bit of<br/>
&gt; damage if I&#39;m fighting...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks :)<br/>
