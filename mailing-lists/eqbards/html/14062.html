<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315154996">Wow.  That&#39;s the most pessimistic post I&#39;ve seen from you!  Looks like it may be time for you to move on<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to say.  I ask you why you would punish yourself further by playing the game if you&#39;re really<br/>
that bored with it?  What I would do is cancel my account, then start it up again when the expansion gets<br/>
released to see if it&#39;s any good.  They don&#39;t delete your characters.  Vote with your wallet.  There are a<br/>
lot of other nice games out there to play.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is, why would someone play a game when they are completely bored with it?  That kindof<br/>
defeats the purpose.  I know we all want more, and MORE of what we love, which is EQ.  But if there is no<br/>
more to be had, throwing money at the vendor doesn&#39;t help.  It&#39;s like buying apples, and when the vendor<br/>
is sold out of apples, handing him $10 and demanding apples because you paid him for apples and dammit,<br/>
you had better give me more apples or I&#39;ll get irate and flame you on the internet.  &quot;Uh, but sir.  We<br/>
don&#39;t have any more apples.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not to get your hackles up Ryan.  This is certainly not directed specifically at you.  :)<br/>
