<div id="ygrps-yiv-145204137"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters <br/>
&gt; have a harder time <br/>
&gt; being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can take <br/>
&gt; out a single <br/>
&gt; opponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much harder, <br/>
&gt; and by high <br/>
&gt; levels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a single player <br/>
&gt; to remove one or <br/>
&gt; more creatures from combat at high levels is sick level <br/>
&gt; powerful - to the <br/>
&gt; point that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how many times do you have to say it for him to finally understand?  you<br/>
have repeatedly told him that the song is not working regardless of the<br/>
level of the mobs, have you not?  you specifically chose mobs 20 levels<br/>
below you to prove your point!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Crission&#39;s Pixie Chase, This song seems to suffer from the <br/>
&gt; same problem <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that Lullaby does, you get the message that the song has <br/>
&gt; taken effect, <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;but the target completely ignores the fact that it should <br/>
&gt; be mesmerized <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(similarto the problem with Lucid Lullaby).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***GZ SAYS***<br/>
&gt; See above.<br/>
&gt; **************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yah me too, see above!  same as lullaby, they are just not understanding<br/>
what we are trying to tell them is wrong.  over and over they say higher<br/>
level mobs resist more often.  they never mention what we keep saying, the<br/>
message says success, there is no effect.  that is different from resisting.<br/>
sheesh, are we speaking english?<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Fufil&#39;s Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The <br/>
&gt; percussion aspect <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces no <br/>
&gt; additional effect <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(damage or resistance debuff).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***GZ SAYS***<br/>
&gt; Hmm - don&#39;t use that one much. I&#39;ll check. If so, we&#39;ll get <br/>
&gt; it fixed right <br/>
&gt; up.<br/>
&gt; **************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yah sure you will.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;McVaxius Berserker Crescendo, I do not have this song yet, <br/>
&gt; but other <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;bards have informed me using a horn only increases the <br/>
&gt; song&#39;s Strength <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;effect, leaving the attack speed unchanged.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***GZ SAYS***<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Speaking of which, unless my memory serves me wrong (which it <br/>
&gt; could), you <br/>
&gt; *must* use a Horn to use this song.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It NEVER required a horn, a horn only doubled its STR effect.<br/>
