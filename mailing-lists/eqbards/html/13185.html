<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;As much as I would love a bind song, it would go against how every song <br/>
&gt;works. Our songs are not permanent effects.  They are not even long <br/>
&gt;lasting.  In general, the effects we create only last for a few seconds <br/>
&gt;after we stop singing or playing our song.  Binding is very different: it <br/>
&gt;is a permanent change to the environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The one exception to this is the charismatic catillion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I agree that all of our songs are temporary.  But I would point out that <br/>
&gt;all spells in the game are temporary, with the exception of Bind.  Magician <br/>
&gt;summoned items are no-rent, and all others are buffs, DD&#39;s, DoT&#39;s, Heals, <br/>
&gt;etc.  There are no environment altering spells in the game that I know of <br/>
&gt;except Bind.  Perhaps a case could be made for Mem Blur, but that&#39;s one <br/>
&gt;spell out of 700.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excellent example... and one which holds equally true for bards.  When you <br/>
play Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, you *permanently* erase the damage register <br/>
of the charmed monster.  This song removes, for the remainer of the <br/>
monster&#39;s lifespan, all recollection of who did damage to it.<br/>
<br/>
The delineation of melee skills is compelling in my eyes as one reason bards <br/>
are not hybrids.  As John said, we&#39;re &quot;not-a&quot;, or put another way we share <br/>
characteristics of many classes without being classified as a member of that <br/>
class.  We&#39;re kinda like rogues (silly skills), kinda like enchanters (some <br/>
buffs, debuffs, and crowd control), kinda like shamans (some more buffs, <br/>
minor healing).  Yet we&#39;re not-a-fighter, not-a-healer, not-a-caster.  We <br/>
got plate mail for no other reason I can see than because we get hit so <br/>
often - like clerics we were judged to be too fragile to drape in leather <br/>
granted our huge taunt power and low hit points.<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant calls us hybrids only because they&#39;re trying to simplify the <br/>
description of classes.  I think a more honest and accurate division would <br/>
be as follows: there are 3 fighter classes (warrior, monk, rogue); 3 healer <br/>
classes (cleric, shaman, druid); 4 caster classes (wizard, magician, <br/>
enchanter, necromancer), 3 hybrid classes (ranger, paladin, shadowknight); <br/>
and 1 bard class (bard).  Our songs are NOT like the spells of any other <br/>
class in the way they are implemented (pulses?  what&#39;s a pulse?  why would I <br/>
weave spells?); we have unique nondisposable spell foci (instruments) which <br/>
are required for some spells (e.g. Shauri&#39;s Sonorous Clouding) and augment <br/>
others; and almost every one of our spells improves linearly with the level <br/>
of the caster.  Plus of course there&#39;s the fact that we only get one spell <br/>
per level (well, in theory anyways).  Ok, ok, they&#39;re songs, not spells - we <br/>
differentiate our effects from all other casters&#39;, don&#39;t we?  = )<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether bards are or are not hybrids, I think Verant&#39;s <br/>
publicly expressed logic for why some classes get bind is easy to apply to <br/>
bards.  They claim that &quot;casters&quot; get bind because they die more often.  I <br/>
contend that bards die as often as any single casting class.  Regardless of <br/>
arguments about travel time (e.g. bards don&#39;t need binding because they run <br/>
so fast - which would also eliminate druids from needing bind, as they can <br/>
SoW, SoC, and port about), the reason why some classes have bind is claimed <br/>
to be due solely to the frequency of deaths of said class.<br/>
<br/>
Some food for thought, anyways...<br/>
