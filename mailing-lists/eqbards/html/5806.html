&gt; back), and was nailed with the typical regeneration effects.  This effect<br/>
&gt; is supposed to prevent you from immediately being buffed and ready to<br/>
&gt; charge - however, Bardic songs seem to be immune to this particular effect.<br/>
&gt;  I was able to sing all of my songs immediately afterwards, and suffered<br/>
&gt; nothing except a massive loss of mana. Not that I use Mana.... ;)<br/>

<br/>
Ask the Cleric that revived you (Or a Shaman, Ranger in your group) for a<br/>
Strenth Buffer, the buffer will cancel the &quot;Resurection Effect&quot;, giving you back<br/>
your agility, dexterity, strenght...<br/>
