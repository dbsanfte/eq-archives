<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614206901">I beg to differ... a corpse relocate can only be done at the cost of the<br/>
bard.  When we are out there looking for someone&#39;s body we are not getting<br/>
gaining the valuable knowledge from defeating critters or making the<br/>
almighty coin.  A simple Bind takes a few seconds, where a corpse relocate<br/>
can take from a few minutes to a half hour.  This is not to say I do not<br/>
give out freebies to newbies who don&#39;t know better to not /loc before they<br/>
snuff it, but this is aimed more at the people who know enough and have<br/>
enough equipment that a few GP is well worth the time and energy they save<br/>
by hiring me.<br/>

I never ever charge for corpse location.  If the corpse is in a spot I<br/>
really don&#39;t want to go to, I give them the location and let them find<br/>
it on their own.  I don&#39;t like people who charge for binding, but at<br/>
least that takes mana.  The only cost to the bard for finding a corpse<br/>
is personal risk, which can be avoided usually.<br/>

&gt; Ahem..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone else has set a standard for corpse relocations.<br/>
&gt; I usually charge 5 GP minimum for up to level 5, plus 1 GP/2 levels<br/>

&gt; this sound like too little?  Maybe it should be 1 PP/2 levels after level<br/>
&gt; 10?<br/>
