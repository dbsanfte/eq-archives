Got past the spectres in the tunnels and eventually ran up a ramp guarded by<br/>
3 DBS&#39;s and a named Necro.<br/>
Sorry, no time for introductions! Have a date with Mr. Thule! &lt;&lt;-- said as I<br/>
ran by. =)<br/>
Zoned in and WOAH! What a view!<br/>
Tons of new critters and some re-hashed(old art) familiar ones with<br/>
different names.<br/>
The one that caught my eye was a Dracolich. H-U-G-E bone dragon-type thing!<br/>
I am assuming it would eat me really fast so I just stayed my distance and<br/>
took a few pictures.<br/>
There is a castle surrounded by a lake of fire. Not your regular lava here<br/>
bud. This is FIRE. Looks really cool.<br/>
Looked around for about 30 minutes carefully avoiding ALL creatures because<br/>
everything cond Red as Lenin to me (of course).<br/>
Took about 50 megs worth of Screenshots. I especially like the one where I<br/>
top a hill and bump into Cazic Thule himself. YIKES!<br/>
Run away!  Lord Thule begins shouting something about infidels and such, but<br/>
I had no time to chit-chat with him, for these big-o-ape-like guys named<br/>
Shiverbacks took an interest to me along with their buddy the Phantasm(looks<br/>
like a fat spectre).<br/>
I saw a wisp-like critter, but was not close enough or in a stable enough<br/>
state of mind to target it to get its name. However, I DID see an animation<br/>
next to it. Hmm. Wisp pet? Cool!<br/>
I&#39;ll have to go through my SS&#39;s to get the name of most of these, as I am<br/>
posting directly after logging off.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
Oh, BTW I used my 13th level gnome magician to run around in there because i<br/>
wanted to bind inside in case I got killed so I would not have to run all<br/>
the way back. =) SCARY! (is that a run-on?)<br/>
