<br/>
In lesser fay there is an orc camp that has some tasty orcs.  But it also<br/>
has the orc legionere from Innoruuk (or what ever is the equivilent of<br/>
Hell).  I happened by there and healed up a dwarf who was in his 20&#39;s - 25<br/>
or 27.  He says he just solo the orc leg and got xp.  Then he whacked him<br/>
again.  Turns out he was a cleric and he says I can kill this orc. You gotta<br/>
be kidding I say - I was like 18.  He says he&#39;ll fetch him out and heal me.<br/>
Wow that was fun!  (Just got under the xp cap for high level mobs I guess -<br/>
cuz I got xp we were not grouped and he healed me while I melee&#39;d.)  So if<br/>
you hunt that camp - it was like mid zone - have a good strong party ready<br/>
for the lege.<br/>
<br/>
The good bandit camp in lesser fay is the Nybright Sisters.  They drop<br/>
precious gems pretty often and also supply necklaces for a kelethin quest -<br/>
talk to the drunk - whoever he is.  But you will prolly need help and it can<br/>
be a busy campsite. They were easy kills when I was 18 and I got xp from a<br/>
couple of them.  I also had to endure whines from other campers - who did<br/>
not want to share with me. Any how the camp is by the zone wall way down<br/>
near the Mist Moore tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
 But the more fun thing to get in lesser fay is Crookstinger!  He is a named<br/>
giant wasp and if you can find him he drops a nice magic dagger - with a<br/>
poison effect.  Well, its nice for his level - which I&#39;d guess around 10 to<br/>
12.  I was just wandering down a path and see my text scrolling<br/>
&quot;Crookstinger stings you for dmg 8&quot;  Wtf?? Crookstinger? I get ready to run<br/>
then con him green. Ohh, theeee Crookstinger! Now I remember Nummy!<br/>

		Heh...had a few interactions with the Mino Hero...most were<br/>
exciting, but<br/>
		only one ended up in my becoming food :)<br/>
<br/>
		I don&#39;t really know how to get to the camps in Lesser<br/>
Fay...I can get to the<br/>
		ones in BB, but I need a bigger group for those<br/>

		&gt; At levels 10-15, I spent a lot of time fighting the<br/>
bandits in Lesser<br/>
		&gt; Faydark and the Dervish Cutthroats in North Ro and West<br/>
Commonlands.  That<br/>
		&gt; was the point at which I decided to leave the homeland of<br/>
Kelethin and<br/>
		&gt; Crushbone and start exploring.  Lots of stuff out there to<br/>
fight at that<br/>
		&gt; level range, both in groups or solo.  I recommend doing<br/>
the bard mail<br/>
		&gt; delivery quests and explore some on the side.  As long as<br/>
you don&#39;t run<br/>
		into<br/>
		&gt; a griffon or giant, you can outrun just about anything you<br/>
might bump<br/>
		into.<br/>

		&gt; &gt; btw, where is a good place to hunt for this level?  I&#39;ll<br/>
go pretty much<br/>
		&gt; &gt; anywhere (in Steamfont now, soloing stuff outside the<br/>
mino caves, but<br/>
		&gt; &gt; grouping within)<br/>
