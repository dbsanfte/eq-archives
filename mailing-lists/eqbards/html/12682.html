<div id="ygrps-yiv-837694618">Actually, many of the answers are exactly what I expected with the added bonus that it is confirmed<br/>
they&#39;ll eventually be fixing certain things (meditate times, giving a resist message on that 2nd saving<br/>
throw for lullaby/pixie&#39;s).  One thing about the original letter is that while it points out many specific<br/>
little problems of the bard class, it doesn&#39;t clarify exactly what all these add up to.  For example, if<br/>
we could get GZ to comment on an overall balance issues:<br/>
<br/>
1) Monsters get increasingly difficult to enthrall as their levels increase (independent of singer&#39;s<br/>
level).<br/>
2) You can&#39;t charm monsters above 37th level.<br/>
3) Our melee (especially defense) skills either cap low, or weren&#39;t given to us at all.<br/>
4) There are virtually no bard specific items that aren&#39;t dropped by gods/dragons, so we have to take the<br/>
discards of other classes like warriors/etc.<br/>
5) Several of the skills we have virtually no practical use to us (stealth, pick locks).<br/>
<br/>
All of these add up to a class, that when over 38th level becomes a magic resist buffing mana pump.<br/>
Almost all of our defining abilities reach a point where they simply don&#39;t work well anymore, whereas<br/>
other classes that have these abilities get upgrades on them that work better on higher level monsters<br/>
(whether in the form of better spells, or higher skill caps).  There&#39;s no point in being a jack of all<br/>
trades if you&#39;re not good enough at any of the trades to be useful after a certain point.  If you are to<br/>
look at the bard as a stricly &quot;jack of all trades&quot; character, this weakness at high level would certainly<br/>
make sense.  The question I have is, does it make sense to even have a class of that type in the game if<br/>
no one wants to play them past level 38?  I guess what I&#39;m saying is, the bard is a very fun class to play<br/>
up to about level 38, but after that seems to lose its identity to the minor roles of mana recouperation<br/>
and magic resist buffing.  Important roles to be sure, but can they alone define an entire class and make<br/>
them entertaining to play?<br/>
<br/>
Whew.. rambling here, but that&#39;s the core of the question I&#39;ve never really seen asked and certainly<br/>
haven&#39;t seen answered.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the limits placed individually on each of our skills that can<br/>
be argued about, since they can always be easily explained away in the name of &quot;class balance/jack of all<br/>
trades/etc.&quot;  It&#39;s the combination of all the limitations that hurts the overall balance of the bard class<br/>
at high levels that needs to be addressed.  For example, I&#39;d gladly give up the ability to solo hill<br/>
giants in my low 30&#39;s to have more defense melee skills at higher levels.  (I use this as an example as<br/>
I&#39;m sure that this ability is factored in when we see Verant spokesmen that claim that many at Verant feel<br/>
the bard is too powerful as it is.  That one ability certainly is powerful, and one of the most boring<br/>
things you can do in the game.  Get rid of it and make the bard class more powerful in other ways that<br/>
we&#39;ve been asking for!)<br/>
<br/>
My inconcise two cents.<br/>

&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt; I took the original post with all the questions about bards and delivered<br/>
&gt; them directy to Geoffrey Zatkin, the Arch-Mage of Norrath. He was kind<br/>
&gt; enough to reply with a very well thought-out response, which is below in<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s entirety.<br/>
