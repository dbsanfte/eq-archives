<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907612344">Ahhh, they just don&#39;t know what you can do, especially in unrest.<br/>
<br/>
The little cheat sheet I have that outlines areas and gives approx lvl<br/>
ranges suggests not even THINKING about going to unrest till lvl 15 - and<br/>
it&#39;s probably correct.<br/>
<br/>
However, I started going there with my bard at 13 - the next couple levels<br/>
flew by - and I was in a very mixed group of mostly high teen players - the<br/>
highest being 21 or 22 - I STILL got excellent exp.<br/>
<br/>
Once this group figured out I could run up to the house and break the<br/>
puller out of a root with speed - or for that matter, get us out of there<br/>
in a hurry, didn&#39;t matter that I didn&#39;t have a magic weapon, or for that<br/>
matter at that time, could even hit a beetle 1 out of 10 times.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to mention all my nifty other utility songs - and folks died a<br/>
few times, but not NEARLY as often as we would have could I not have gotten<br/>
us out of that nasty situation - especially for the guy fetching in the<br/>
house. There is nothin quite like the feeling of zoning - and seeing your<br/>
group pop thru one at a time with less than a bubble of life - but they<br/>
MADE IT.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about a wisker from 17 now - and finally got my hands on a combine<br/>
longsword - looking forward to going back soon.<br/>

&gt;I am a lvl 17 bard trying to find a good place to hunt.  I am mostly around<br/>
&gt;Oasis but willing to travel for exp and loot.  I need a good place with<br/>
&gt;decent amount of plp to group with.  I tried Unrest, and Highpass.  It seems<br/>
&gt;that no one wants a bard because we attract too much attentions.  Please<br/>
&gt;give suggestions.<br/>
