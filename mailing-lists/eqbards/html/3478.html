<br/>
I wanna be a big, kilt-wearing, bagpipe playing bard.  Gimme some bagpipes!<br/>
Heh, that should do great for a AOE Damage Song.  Play the MacNasty&#39;s<br/>
Bagpipe Revenge:  A &lt;insert MOB name here&gt; bleeds at the ears!<br/>
A massively dangerous, massively damaging song!<br/>
<br/>
I want bagpipes and a kilt! Oh, yeah, and some Haggis!<br/>

&gt; &gt;halflings seem like a racethat is in touch with nature, , to be<br/>
&gt; honest they<br/>
&gt; &gt;just don&#39;t strike me as a race that would want to have bards.<br/>
&gt; they seem more<br/>
&gt; &gt;like a race that is in touch with their surroundings ( nature ,<br/>
&gt; animals) than<br/>
&gt; &gt;they are with music and keeping history.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I beg to differ, but I almost decided *not* to play a Bard when I<br/>
&gt; found out<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t be a Halfling.  This has been my biggest rant since day 1!  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; incredibly disappointed that NO little people or evil race can be a Bard.<br/>
&gt; This should be fixed!!! Please?  *grins*<br/>
&gt; When I asked about it, all I was told is that there were no CURRENT plans<br/>
&gt; to change class/race limitations.<br/>
