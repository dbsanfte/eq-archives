<div id="ygrps-yiv-473585202">Hee hee.  I hope that&#39;s all it is, but I am not too hopeful as he didn&#39;t<br/>
seem surprised that he saw it vs the level one snake.  He only seemed<br/>
surprised and upset that we didn&#39;t see it too.  I was getting almost exactly<br/>
20% secondary resists before the patch that put in the message, will have to<br/>
see if I get nearly 50% now as well.  For me it was 5% R, 20% r, pre-message<br/>
path, will let you know what it is now.<br/>

&gt; Oh its worse than that from what I see.  Looks like Lullaby has two<br/>
effects,<br/>
&gt; a stun and a mez? and the second resist is from the mez.  On higher level<br/>
&gt; mobs I&#39;d expect it nearly never works as there will be three! saves.  I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t imagine why this song is nerfed this badly.  It must be really tough<br/>
&gt; to use at levels over 35.<br/>
<br/>
No, I think GZ just screwed up the level dependency formula<br/>
for this second save.  It works correctly with Pixie Strike -<br/>
the &quot;your target resists your attempt to mesmerize it&quot; message<br/>
only starts to become common against L35+ mobs.  He may have<br/>
tried to copy it over for Lullaby, tweak it for Lullaby being<br/>
a lower level song, and screwed up there resulting in L1 mobs<br/>
resisting as if they were L40+.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try it on some high level mobs (assuming I survive :).<br/>
