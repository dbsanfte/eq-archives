<div id="ygrps-yiv-230169669">Well, the cli plane is for a future patch that will in fact allow those<br/>
with Really Hot Systems to extend the viewing range to the horizon.  They<br/>
warn it will be very slow on most machines, so lower is better for this. BTW<br/>
it is not dependent on your ISP connection as the graphics are totally<br/>
independant from the position updating that you get from the server. It just<br/>
says move that here, or put that there. Your PC does all the work. Even when<br/>
I am getting dumped (ie: numbers go yellow, then red, then bye bye) I can<br/>
still run around at full speed, and when I log back in most times I am where<br/>
I was when I was finally timed out, not when I first lost the server. Hope<br/>
this helps.<br/>
