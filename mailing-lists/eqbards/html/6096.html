<b>Subject:</b> offense and defense caps <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-267202864">Has anyone on this list ever, ever had their offense or defense capped for <br/>
their level? I just made 17 a little while ago (so most normal caps, <br/>
including melee skills should be 90) and I think my offense is in the low <br/>
80&#39;s and my defense is in the high 70&#39;s. I have meleed and soloed most of <br/>
the way to my current level, since I usually play at weird hours, so for the <br/>
most part, the only person tanking for me was me. But I&#39;m still not capped.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so much worried about my offense skill so much as I am my defense <br/>
skill. From what I&#39;ve heard, at higher levels, mobs tend get angry at bards <br/>
first, and make short work of them. I&#39;m always on the lookout for better <br/>
armor, but I want every defensive advantage I can get, including the defense <br/>
skill.<br/>
