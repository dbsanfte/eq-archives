<div id="ygrps-yiv-396462112">heh it would be the only explanation for the statement that PoS items make<br/>
other high-end stuff look like rusty longswords, though i agree it is fishy<br/>
at best.  maybe not a skill, but wearing that crap should give you some<br/>
benefit you maybe aren&#39;t aware of on the surface, otherwise why bother with<br/>
any of it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Sounds fishy, since VI has stated it the past that no items <br/>
&gt; would boost <br/>
&gt; skills in the that matter.<br/>
&gt; I believe they answered that when Gordon was asked if <br/>
&gt; mechanical lockpicks <br/>
&gt; added anything to the lock pick skill and his answer was no <br/>
&gt; and no items in <br/>
&gt; the game would add to a skill.<br/>
