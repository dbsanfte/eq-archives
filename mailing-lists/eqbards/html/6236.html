<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649466152">I once was doing 4 songs, but it was 4 a.m. on a<br/>
Sunday morning with less than 800 people on the<br/>
server, and I had 3d sky and particle density turned<br/>
off.  The key is to stop the song a millisecond before<br/>
it&#39;s effect comes up.  The effect for the first song<br/>
starts at almost the same time.  But to be honest, it<br/>
takes so much button mashing (a word I picked up in<br/>
KY) that I&#39;d much rather sit back and do 2 or 3 songs.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As far as stats, at  one point I had 130 str, at<br/>
another point I had 130 charisma, now I just have 4<br/>
stats (str, char, agil, dex) that I keep in the low<br/>
100&#39;s, reason being, as a player of many roles in<br/>
combat, you never know what skill you&#39;ll be using<br/>
next.  By keeping them all high and even, it gives you<br/>
a lot more flexablity.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m off to stalk Karisma<br/>
