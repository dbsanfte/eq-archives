<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286723733">Well.  DUH!<br/>
<br/>
I can vouch for the fact that my cute *female* half-elf Bard got a lot more<br/>
stuff in her early levels (I *never* asked) than my wizened male gnome<br/>
Magician or male human Monk.  Sylly can probably vouch for this, and if I&#39;m<br/>
not mistaken John(tm)&#39;s character is female as well.  Even though most<br/>
everyone knows (and I freely admit when asked) that there&#39;s a male playing<br/>
that character, somehow me as a male gamer is largely separated in other<br/>
player&#39;s minds from Crier the Bard while playing in that world.  There&#39;s<br/>
doctoral dissertation material here, I just know it.<br/>

&gt; gives her a bunch of leather armor and a silvery war axe.<br/>
&gt; This just reconfirms my past experiences where female<br/>
&gt; characters get a lot more freebies than male characters. =P<br/>
