<b>Subject:</b> [EQBards] A little fuel for the Singing AC fire <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372799672">I saw this in an Enchanter story on Casters Realm.<br/>
<br/>
      Baelish: Since Enchanters are beat on more than any other class in the game. Could the stats on insidious armor be looked at give higher ac / hitpoints? Perhaps a self only AC spell be introduced at higher levels to help out? Unlike other casters, Enchanters are forced to engage mobs that are currently not attacking them in order to be effective in performing their duties. With the use of charm and mesmerise at high levels this is even more dangerous, yet Enchanters get no new tools to really help in this. Even 700HP on Rune V won&#39;t last more than a couple of rounds, and at a cost of 14p a cast.<br/>
     <br/>
      GZ: Actually, Bards are beat on more then any other class in the game. And no - Enchanters, need a party to help keep monsters off them - it is a downside to being one of the most powerful classes in EQ. <br/>

Just thought it might be useful for ammo in any threads about the AC on the Singing Steel.<br/>
