<div id="ygrps-yiv-73186207">This particular bug makes me think, though, that jhenders is correct.  <br/>
Verant obviously modified their code to correct a &quot;problem&quot; that they saw <br/>
with Levitation.  It took a whopping eighteen seconds for some Bard <br/>
playing Aria for him to realize that it was completely busted.  They <br/>
could not possibly have tested this.  I would be lined up against a wall <br/>
and shot if I did this on my job.  This is not some subtle and intricate <br/>
consequence of some complicated piece of code buried in some hidden <br/>
module somewhere.  They &quot;fixed&quot; levitation, they failed to test <br/>
levitation.  For Bards, of course.<br/>
<br/>
The initial Selo&#39;s/SOW &quot;fix&quot; is another example.  I&#39;m quite sure they <br/>
tested this for everyone who might be grouped with a Bard, but they did <br/>
not test it for the Bard himself.  And why did it take six months for <br/>
them to fix the level 22 song?  I can live with the thought that Bards <br/>
may not have an affirmative advocate inside Verant, but this suggests <br/>
that nobody at Verant even bothers to consider Bards when making changes, <br/>
which bothers me.<br/>

&gt; The bard at Verant probably plays mana song all the time, even<br/>
&gt; in combat :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry about the complaint in the previous message, but it is<br/>
&gt; getting annoying to me how many people from every class in this game<br/>
&gt; think that verant hates them their class more than the rest of the<br/>
&gt; classes.  As the one post said, by what I read about<br/>
&gt; EQ, Verant hates every class more than all the rest of the<br/>
&gt; classes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; specific incident. It really looks like either they don&#39;t have someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; at Verant who &quot;owns&quot; bards, both from a programming and testing<br/>
&gt; &gt; standpoint, or if they do, it&#39;s someone who is incompetent or doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; care.<br/>
