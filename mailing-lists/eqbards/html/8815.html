<div id="ygrps-yiv-535310995">True, not only is it impossible to verify this but according to the EQ<br/>
Guide document thing that snuck around for a while both apprentice guides<br/>
and full guides are not allowed to create items for players, even in the<br/>
case of item loss. Senior guides are allowed to but it is usually for a GM<br/>
run quest.<br/>
	So keep in mind that when a guide says they can&#39;t help it might not be that<br/>
they don&#39;t want to or know how to, it could be that their &#39;rank&#39; doesn&#39;t<br/>
allow them to. You can always ask for it to be escalated to a higher guide<br/>
if you feel that it is important enough (and they are on, of course :)<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)&gt; I was curious if anyone had had any luck getting quest<br/>
8)items that went<br/>
8)&gt; into the Quest Black Hole (i.e. you gave the right items, but got<br/>
8)&gt; nothing back) back.  I&#39;m asking because a friend had this<br/>
8)happen with<br/>
8)&gt; his crafted gauntlets while trying to do the resize quest.<br/>
8)The Guide<br/>
8)&gt; (I&#39;m assuming it was a newer or lower level guide, not a<br/>
8)senior) told<br/>
8)&gt; him that there was nothing that they could do, after making him wait<br/>
8)&gt; for almost an hour (but that&#39;s another gripe) and that<br/>
8)there was no GM<br/>
8)&gt; on anyway.  Is there any chance he might get his gauntlets back?<br/>
8)<br/>
8)No chance. There&#39;s no way to verify that the quest was done<br/>
8)properly or done at all.<br/>
