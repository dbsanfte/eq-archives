&gt; 2) nobody ever thinks that they&#39;re looting their fair<br/>
&gt; share of FFA bodies; and 3) too many people leave the<br/>
&gt; &quot;junk&quot; bodies behind, then mentally count them off against<br/>
&gt; you if you choose to loot them yourself.<br/>

encumbered with too much loot, so most people tend to just<br/>
loot what they need which is why FFA works.  At least I<br/>
haven&#39;t met anyone past about level 30 that went on a looting<br/>
binge when it was declared FFA.  In fact, I&#39;ve noticed we tend<br/>
to have a lot of corpses rot on us unlooted when it&#39;s FFA -<br/>
nobody wants to pick up the extra weight.  Looting out of<br/>
order was a pretty big problem at lower levels though.  One<br/>
guy I was grouped with immediately looted anything with a<br/>
weapon whether or not it was his turn, then began complaining<br/>
he was encumbered.  Needless to say, that group didn&#39;t last<br/>
long.<br/>
