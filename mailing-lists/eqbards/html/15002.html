<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463806575">I am completely negative about it.  I do believe that no matter how many<br/>
tests you do Verant is going to quietly ignore it.  Same with the shaman<br/>
post in the EQ forum that ran tests on AGI, DEX and the like.  Gord-o asked<br/>
them to run the test, yet that post has been ignored.  All the man has to<br/>
do is reply to it with at least a simple, &quot;ok, thanks for running the test<br/>
for me.  We&#39;ll look in to it.&quot;.  I personally feel that Gord-o has turned<br/>
in to more of a corporate man recently, not a person for the people.  All<br/>
these posts about problems are getting bumped while he is busy responding<br/>
to posts about the history or Norrath. Grrrr<br/>

&gt;Well, John&#39;s post on the EQ boards concerning Lullaby now has 5+ pages of<br/>
&gt;bumps and has remained at the top of the boards.  Yet there has still been<br/>
&gt;no response from Abashi or GZ.  It is my hope that they are secretly going<br/>
&gt;to de-nerf it in tomorrow mornings patch without ever admitting that there<br/>
&gt;was a problem.  Am I a wild-eyed  optimist?<br/>
