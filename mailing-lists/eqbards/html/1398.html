&gt;This isn&#39;t related to the first question but it has something to do with <br/>
&gt;Area<br/>
&gt;Effect songs so I figured I&#39;d continue with this header.  My part hunted<br/>
&gt;Mistmoore for the past 3 days and we hunt right at the zone.  Well...either<br/>
&gt;Mistmoore is bugged or my area song is hitting the npcs you hear casting<br/>
&gt;through the walls, because we have had trouble with those same npcs coming <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the zone and killing us all when we did nothing to provoke them. The AoE<br/>
&gt;songs I used were fear, lull, and denon&#39;s. My only conclusion is that my <br/>
&gt;song<br/>
&gt;radius is reaching them, I tried to talk to a GM who just told me that <br/>
&gt;higher<br/>
&gt;lvl dungeons need a bit of tweaking.  If anyone has any other information <br/>
&gt;I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;love to hear from you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>DAMN does this bug still exist???<br/>
I&#39;m not looking forward to going to Mistmoore, but I will probly head there <br/>
around 20th because I&#39;d love to own some lupine items.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since beta3 Mistmoore has had a bug where if you brush or touch the <br/>
wall near zone (not sure which wall, I think the left one) it will cause a <br/>
train from back of zone to come kill you. It was VERY annoying. I hear <br/>
Tanara (a VERY nasty female DE vampire) used to be attracted to zone this <br/>
way. I also hear she is no longer in Mistmoore?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, one time this happened and she was stuck at zone (kinda like Dvinn <br/>
being stuck at zone in Crushbone, only FAR worse as she can charm you). <br/>
There were about 20 ppl outside afraid to go in because of her so we <br/>
petitioned a GM. Forget his name, but a 50th lvl wiz GM showed up, went <br/>
inside and shortly thereafter appeared in our midst naked, and muttering <br/>
&quot;stupid wench...&quot; So we all went in with him and helped kill her.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if the wall thing is what is happening to you, but I would suggest <br/>
NOT touching the walls, as the bug may still exist.<br/>
