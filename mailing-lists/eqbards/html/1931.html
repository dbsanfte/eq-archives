<div id="ygrps-yiv-359998179">I cannot resist a truely terrible pun, so I&#39;ll relate again my out of bard<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure how long poison, not lesser, but the normal variety lasts... but<br/>
had it put on me imeedietely before zoning, and when outside I began singing<br/>
hymn and then collapsed.  I managed to come to once, but immedietly fell<br/>
down again.  In that weird sort of state where one is dying and staring down<br/>
on one&#39;s own lifeless form I was, for a long time, until the poison finally<br/>
cleared.  I think a bug.  Was a long time I was singing in my sleep.<br/>
