classes.  A &quot;well balanced group&quot; typically means cleric,<br/>
2 warriors, enchanter, and 2 hard nukers.<br/>

&gt; Necro&#39;s are very weak in groups because there&#39;s no time for their DoT&#39;s to<br/>
&gt; ramp up in dmg.  Typically it takes a full minute or more for a Necro DOT to<br/>
&gt; realize full potential in dmg.  Most fights with a good group last far less<br/>
&gt; than that (unless you&#39;re talking dragons/planes).<br/>

killing stuff that&#39;s too easy for them, or (2) overnuking.  <br/>
The /con and exp system is a bit screwy in this game so I<br/>
won&#39;t go so far as to say exp is better if you kill at an<br/>
optimal rate, but all other things being equal it is.  <br/>
Remember, being grouped *increases* your survival time, so<br/>
(nuking mana permitting) you are free to let fights go on<br/>
*longer* than if you&#39;re playing solo.  Fighting a mob of<br/>
proper difficulty for the group (i.e. the R ratio I came up<br/>
with being less than but close to 1), the fight duration will<br/>
be near the survival time for the group.<br/>
