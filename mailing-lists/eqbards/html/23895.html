&gt;I&#39;m so disappointed it hurts. Why bother trying to &quot;balance&quot; the classes if<br/>

that bards are overpowered already?  And if you won&#39;t accept that if bards are currently overpowered<br/>
compared to other classes as a whole that they won&#39;t get major improvements while some other<br/>
classes will, then I predict you are about to be even more disappointed.</div>
