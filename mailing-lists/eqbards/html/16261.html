<div id="ygrps-yiv-809731736">I agree totally.  I see much of the new rules as nothing more than an<br/>
official excuse for why they should not have to provide additional server<br/>
resources, and a mechanism for allowing them to more smoothly deal with the<br/>
problems arising because they have already decided not to provide additional<br/>
server resources.  Let&#39;s face it, their building may be bursting at the<br/>
seams with servers with nowhere to expand to if they underestimated the<br/>
demand.<br/>

Of course what Gordon completely ignores here is that Verant&#39;s<br/>
negligence in providing adequate server resources for the number of<br/>
people at some levels means people are having to camp just for<br/>
experience, not items. But then, he wouldn&#39;t be Gordon if he didn&#39;t miss<br/>
the point or pretend to in order to avoid addressing the real issue.<br/>

&gt; Found this posted on EQ Vault from a discussion with Gordon:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sharing Spawns<br/>
&gt; We do realize how long it takes. If I had my way, many items would be made<br/>
&gt; much more rare than they are, to the extent that no one would camp for<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; People would then do the dungeons, and if they got something cool it would<br/>
&gt; be a real reward.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, we&#39;re not going to force you to camp. However if you insist on<br/>
camping,<br/>
&gt; then you&#39;ll need to deal with others who insist on camping in a civilized<br/>
&gt; manner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These rules change nothing for people who already work well with others.<br/>
For<br/>
&gt; instance, lets say you are camping something that always has a list going.<br/>
&gt; If someone new comes in, putting them on the list is perfectly acceptable,<br/>
&gt; much the same as you did before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These rules don&#39;t let them come in and demand that they get the next loot,<br/>
&gt; they only say that you need to work something out, or a GM/Guide will work<br/>
&gt; it out for you.<br/>
