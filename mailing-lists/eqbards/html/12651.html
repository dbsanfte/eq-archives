<b>Subject:</b> RE: Here&#39;s a clip from the elite Innoruuk guild. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517491325">we got a lot of flack on our server when our guild was formed.  i won&#39;t lie,<br/>
we have the same kind of effort.  the guild was formed to do events and be<br/>
able to do them in one guild without all the organizing that we used to have<br/>
to do that took so long.  many of the most experienced players from several<br/>
different guilds got together and started this one.  the difference may be<br/>
that we are at least civil.  when the servers crashed a couple days ago,<br/>
obviously people were going to make runs at the dragons ASAP.  we were going<br/>
to go to nag, had everyone at lavastorm, and found out that there were<br/>
groups forming inside that had been at FGs before the crash, and decided to<br/>
go after Nag while there.  obviously they could not plan on doing nag since<br/>
the crash was unexpected, and no FG group could ever do Nag, but they had<br/>
plans in motion and people there, so we did Vox instead.  the next day when<br/>
the servers crashed again (may they crash every day!) again we made an<br/>
agreement to alternate the dragons we did last time.  and both times we were<br/>
done many hours before the other guild(s) were, and if we were so inclined<br/>
could have walked in and did the other dragon if we really wanted to, but<br/>
what&#39;s right is right.<br/>
