&gt; not doing much of the damage, and perhaps the fights would go the same <br/>
&gt; either way... the results exceeded my expectations by quite a bit.  Where <br/>
&gt; before one or both fighters and sometimes the mage would be down a bubble or <br/>
&gt; two after each round of a few GKs, now nobody lost even a half bubble of <br/>
&gt; health.  I still waded into melee and did *some* damage with my fists, but <br/>

Basically, you have everyone&#39;s readiness status up in front of<br/>
you all the time (their health bars).  So you can play around<br/>
with healing and pulling to settle on a rate where the action<br/>
is pretty much non-stop without having to ask &quot;mana?&quot; all the<br/>
time.  (Casters can join in on the nonstop fun too if they&#39;re<br/>
good about conserving their mana. :)<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, playing Hymn with a lute instead of using weapons<br/>
meant each fight was taking a little bit longer.  But if you<br/>
were waiting to heal up after each fight anyway, then your<br/>
kill rate would be better if you can keep everyone almost<br/>
topped (since waiting to heal time = not-doing-any-damage<br/>
time).<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people complain about excessive downtime in this<br/>
game.  The one thing no other class can touch a bard at is<br/>
reducing or eliminating downtime.<br/>
