&gt; stilleto fang piranhas in Kedge (red at 42) with Pixie -<br/>
&gt; they&#39;d resist maybe 70%-80% of the time.  My shaman friend put<br/>
&gt; sympathetic aura on me bumping me up to 184, and all of a<br/>
&gt; sudden my Strikes were sticking about 2/3rds the time.  I got<br/>
&gt; so carried away I started weaving another song with it instead<br/>
&gt; of just Striking the fang.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Speaking of pixie strike...  Last night I was in CT and ended up<br/>
having to pixie strike a yellow gator.  I only got about 1 failure out of 5<br/>
without flute, and no failures out of about 30-35 attempts with a flute.<br/>
(had to keep it pixied while a pallie medded and healed himself). After the<br/>
first failure, I had no reason not to switch to a flute, so I did.  My<br/>
charisma is about 120-125 or so.<br/>
