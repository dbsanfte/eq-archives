<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-297214779"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Other than that I can&#39;t see what they have in mind.  There is little need<br/>
&gt;for an upgrade to most of our existing songs, upgrade to hymn highly<br/>
&gt;unlikely to ever occur.  I still greatly doubt that a high level binding<br/>
&gt;song would be unbalancing.  Given the lack of knowledge other classes have<br/>
&gt;about bards, if it was self only most people would never even know it<br/>
&gt;existed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I had a plat for every time I&#39;ve been ask to bind - or sow - I&#39;d be one<br/>
rich bard.<br/>
<br/>
Note - this is usually asked as I have a lute in my hand.</div>
