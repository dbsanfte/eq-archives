<div id="ygrps-yiv-347663827">Mabey I am being overly cynical but...<br/>
<br/>
Hooray for you.<br/>
Honestly..EQ is boring.<br/>
I dont want it to be, but it is.<br/>
<br/>
Im tired of logging on and doing nothing for 2 hours because there are 100<br/>
people in a zone and<br/>
I dont feel like spending an hour walking to the next appropriate zone ( and<br/>
I will NEVER waste<br/>
15pp just to be teleported...im cleap).<br/>
<br/>
I am also tired of all the anger and dissapointment I feel towards Verant.<br/>
Lets face it...those bozos have done some laughably stupid things, not only<br/>
to<br/>
bards, but to a whole slew of classes.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep on playing, what else is there to do?<br/>
It only gets worse, and one you hit the big 60 and<br/>
have all the best gear, will it have been worth it?<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it.  Save your money and your sanity.<br/>
<br/>
Log out permanetly..:)<br/>

&gt; Question is - how should we respond if and when they state &quot;It works as<br/>
&gt; intended&quot;...<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Could you give EsterTheTester a small ring and let her know that<br/>
&gt; resistance rates are based on player level NOT spell level?<br/>
&gt; Actually there are components of both depending on the spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some spells are inherently more or less resistable than others. An example<br/>
&gt; of this is the &quot;Fear&quot; series. The higher levels of the fear series are<br/>
&gt; inherently less resistable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Concerning caster level, it&#39;s not so much the casters level as it is the<br/>
&gt; casters level versus the level of the target. Resistance values receive a<br/>
&gt; modifier based on this difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If you could let her know this it would really help with her testing of<br/>
&gt; Lullabye for Bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The testing is complete, the game designers and programmers have been<br/>
&gt; consulted, and results are in. I&#39;m afraid that the bards will not like<br/>
