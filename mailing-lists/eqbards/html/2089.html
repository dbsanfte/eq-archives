<b>Subject:</b> Questions about lvl 18 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883514075">I just reach lvl 18 yesterday and I was wondering if all experience bards<br/>
can help me out on the used of the lvl 18 spell.  I know that it does dmg<br/>
and lower ac.  I was wondering, if the MOB get hit by this song then I stop<br/>
playing does their ac still down and still do dmg to them for another 2<br/>
melee or does it stop when u stop.  Any info on this would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx,<br/>
