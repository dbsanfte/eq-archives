<div id="ygrps-yiv-667221845">Got a chance to run a couple tests with my level 31 enchanter friend (my<br/>
bard&#39;s 35th)<br/>
<br/>
Times are just for one bubble of mana....<br/>
<br/>
Clarity Alone : 72 seconds<br/>
ManaSong Constant: 65 seconds<br/>
ManaSong Juggled: 65 seconds<br/>
Clarity+Song : 48 seconds<br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t find another bard around to test if the song stacks with itself,<br/>
that&#39;s still left to be decided but at least we&#39;re sure now that clarity &<br/>
the song do stack.  And the song is just like most other bard songs in that<br/>
it has a 3 round effect, and can be juggled with two other songs w/ no drop<br/>
in regen rate.<br/>
