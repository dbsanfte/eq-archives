Trust me, it&#39;s in there, now do you really want that cheap feeling in your<br/>
gut for knowing?<br/>
Sure you do!<br/>

&gt;Does anyone know what the level 30 song is and where<br/>
&gt;to find it?  Or who to talk to if it is (as I have heard) a<br/>
&gt;quest item?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know what it is, not where to find it.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up a utility some fellow wrote which reads a data file in the EQ<br/>
directory, and will list the title of spells, the message you receive, and<br/>
what class can use the spell.  The reason I even grabbed it was because a<br/>
friend was wondering if his druid spell was removed from the game, which<br/>
apparently it was (the spell was in the data file, however no class could<br/>
use it.)   In case you&#39;re wondering, winged courier, it&#39;s in the list but<br/>
has a null value as to &quot;who may use.&quot;  There are other strange songs<br/>
like this, for GMs?  It&#39;s a handy utility for getting a grasp of what<br/>
those high level songs do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the bard song for level 30 is entitled:<br/>
<br/>
Drum roll, feet begin to move faster....<br/>
Adagio&#39;s Centrifugal Fuge.<br/>
Here are the messages you would receive from it: &quot;You begin to spin,&quot; &quot;xxx<br/>
begins to spin,&quot; &quot;You stop spinning.&quot;   Hehe sounds like the effect when<br/>
turning and getting stunned, and a great deal of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Now then where O where could it be??  All I know is that I&#39;m only level 12<br/>
now, and by the time I reach level 30 enough people will have probably found<br/>
it that it will start being sold in the shops.  The powergamers have all the<br/>
fun, don&#39;t they?  Least I knew before any of them, and now you do too.<br/>
