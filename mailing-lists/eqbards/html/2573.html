 </span></blockquote>Hey, Cooter, I have a message for you.  I won&#39;t be subtle because that<br/>
would be too far beyond your ability to comprehend.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a boneheaded jerk of limited vision who can&#39;t tell a fantasy game<br/>
from just another bit of software to wring dry and discard.  You wouldn&#39;t<br/>
recognize a reasonable principle if it slapped you in the face.  You&#39;re<br/>
also an ignorant bigot who assumes anyone who disagrees is stupid or evil.<br/>
You&#39;re the sort that spoils whatever they do by making it a contest they<br/>
must win at all costs, no holds barred, no rules, no consideration other<br/>
than winning.<br/>
<br/>
	In Norrath a bard name of Cooter<br/>
	Was only a bug-using looter<br/>
	He just didn&#39;t care<br/>
	For a fantasy, fair<br/>
	He&#39;d ride through and shoot from a scooter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably not skilled enough to offend you sufficiently that you&#39;ll go<br/>
away.  I like alternate points of view that make me think but some are<br/>
simply so ignorant and stupid they make me vomit.  As far as I personally<br/>
am concerned please feel free to leave us powermad control mongers and our<br/>
more honorable, perceptive opponents to discuss how many angels look nice<br/>
arranged on the head of a pin.<br/>
<br/>
