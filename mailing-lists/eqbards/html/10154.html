&gt;But I don&#39;t want to stop surfing, does anyone?  I think that is one of our<br/>
&gt;coolest animations that we surf across the ground as we blaze across Norrath<br/>
&gt;in a cacophony of light bubbles.  It will be a sad day indeed when even our<br/>
&gt;appearance is nerfed.  Heaven above forbid bards should look cooler at any<br/>
&gt;time than someone else.  That might be unbalancing.  Never mind that we have<br/>
&gt;a stick for a drum, and we strum it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yesterday, i feedback&#39;ed and petitioned this.  (because of a silly mistake<br/>
on my part, i thought that they had already nerfed the surfing-- I was<br/>
running, using Selo&#39;s and had an item picked up with my cursor, so I would<br/>
remember to put it in the bank when I got there.  Evidently that nullifies<br/>
the surfing effect, too)<br/>
I know, I probably shouldn&#39;t have petitioned, but I was pretty dissapointed<br/>
that they would take such a fun element out of the game.  To my surprise, I<br/>
received a tell from a Guide bard, Allie, who said that she would put in a<br/>
good word for us.  :)<br/>
