<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601473297"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;this time not by verant , but by the people at Gameznet<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Bards will be added to this site at a later date, but we here at B&F think<br/>
that their melee skills aren&#39;t really what defines them, as such they are<br/>
the last to be written about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, dear old Platt doesn&#39;t have a clue how Bards are played and<br/>
is neatly dodging the issue.<br/>
<br/>
I read a few of his articles.  I didn&#39;t see anything that was written<br/>
objectively, which put me off lickety-split.  Take a look at &quot;How to get<br/>
your FBSS&quot;... it&#39;s a novel approach, guiding a player using screenshots, but<br/>
it just doesn&#39;t work.  A map would have put over in one page what he tried<br/>
in 16 screenshots.  Admittedly, it&#39;s nice to see a screenshot of the room in<br/>
question but a map would have been more effective.  I think it&#39;s safe to say<br/>
I won&#39;t be visiting that site again.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, we&#39;ve already got EQSongs and The Concert Hall.  What more do we<br/>
need? :)</div>
