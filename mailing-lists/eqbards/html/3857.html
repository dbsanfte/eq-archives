<b>Subject:</b> Rubicite, Cazic Thule, and Verant&#39;s Biggest Mistake <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586781142">Simple post . . . no lengthy explanation needed:<br/>
<br/>
1. I like computer games. I play them because they are fun.<br/>
<br/>
2. I play Everquest a lot, because it is a hell of a lot of fun<br/>
<br/>
3. I play a Bard, because I think Bards are one of the most fun classesin<br/>
the game. We can heal fast, run fast, root, lull, fear, charm, stun, buff,<br/>
invis, find our corpse, sing some good damage, breathe underwater,<br/>
levitate, cancel magic, track, and more. We get to wear the coolest armor<br/>
in the game, and wield some good weapons and handle them pretty well. Being<br/>
a bard is a blast.<br/>
<br/>
4. When I play Everquest, I want to have fun. If I am not having fun at any<br/>
given time, I stop playing, or I go to another zone, party, etc.. Duh.<br/>
<br/>
5. Rubicite armor is probably the coolest armor that any of us have a<br/>
reasonable chance of wearing. Having it would be really neat, and would<br/>
definitely enhance the fun I have in the game.<br/>
<br/>
6. Rubicite armor is found in Cazic Thule, on a variety of reasonably rare<br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
7. Cazic Thule is hell on Norrath. It isn&#39;t like each mob with Rucicite is<br/>
camped by a single party in a room somewhere (like Najena for instance).<br/>
No, most of the armor is camped by multiple parties, who have some sort of<br/>
system for figuring out which GROUP gets the next loot of something that<br/>
MIGHT have Rubicite. It is the silliest thing I have ever encountered in<br/>
EQ, and I have seen a lot of silliness.<br/>
<br/>
8. Getting a reasonable amount of Rubicite would require sitting in Cazic<br/>
with a bunch of people who are constantly stressed about looting, and doing<br/>
this for a LONG time . . weeks or MONTHS.<br/>
<br/>
9. Number 8 is not fun.<br/>
<br/>
10. Verant&#39;s Biggest Mistake: To acquire the best items in Everquest, you<br/>
must often be willing to have no fun. This is insane. This is nuts.<br/>
