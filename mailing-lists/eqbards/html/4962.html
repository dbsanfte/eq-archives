<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227551704">Well then, <br/>
  AS someone who has a mid level Druid in addition to my Bard, kiting<br/>
is nothing new.  Furthermore, I&#39;ve seen more than my share of BARDS<br/>
doing quite a bit of kiting.  Our songs may not hit HARD...but they<br/>
never run outta mana, and we Suuuuuure can outrun druids.  Personally,<br/>
I&#39;d get over this &quot;grass is always greener&quot; thing.  My high level<br/>
cleric ALWAYS welcomes a bard in the group (and did at all levels) and<br/>
any time I&#39;ve seen a group lucky enough to have 2...yes gasp...2 bards<br/>
in it...folks have ALWAYS remarked on how AMAZING bards were.  <br/>
  We get our advantages, and we get our disadvantages.  I&#39;ll take a<br/>
lesser kiting ability over spending all night medding ANY DAY (which is<br/>
about all my cleris seems to do any more).  All I seem to play anymore<br/>
is my bard.  <br/>
  Every class talks about how POWERFUL another one is.  I think they<br/>
are pretty much all balanced well, and the nerfs are indeed usually<br/>
well thought out.<br/>
  I WOULD like to see more bard only items (a weapon would be nice<br/>
instead of JUST an instrument...or a more powerful instrument) but<br/>
wouldnt we all?  hehe<br/>
