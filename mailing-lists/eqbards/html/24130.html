<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848645502">Hi!  Chant and Anthem don&#39;t stack.  But Anthem and Johnathan&#39;s Whistling<br/>
Warsong do.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought of a use for Melliflous Motion...never tried it (you must be<br/>
21 RL years or older to attempt part of this...hehe).  First you get drunk.<br/>
Then, get your character drunk.  Get together a group of fellow (21 yr or<br/>
older of course) drunkards, and just start playing it.  If you get out of<br/>
effect range, attempt to return in range.  Better yet, if you can get<br/>
multiple bards in the group to all play this song, slightly staggered.<br/>

<br/>
Heh..on just the first 3 pulses.  :P<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure the sight of several drunken people randomly stumbling about then<br/>
suddenly poofing would be fun for a while!  For participants and spectators<br/>
alike!<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] UseFUL songs...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of listing ways in which songs are useless, let&#39;s talk about how to <br/>
use different songs.  I haven&#39;t played a bard in a long time, and there&#39;s a <br/>
whole lotta new songs out there - so I&#39;d like to know which songs will be <br/>
useful in which ways and combinations.<br/>
So.... as a starter,<br/>
<br/>
1st Level - Chant of Battle:<br/>
The first (and for a while, most useful), it&#39;s sung in combat - but since <br/>
it&#39;s not harmful, it should be sung at all times during a young bard&#39;s <br/>
early life until they&#39;ve maxed out their singing skills.  It enhances <br/>
combat abilities for the Bard and everyone in their group, and can be <br/>
successfully twisted / stacked / harmonized with most other below-tenth <br/>
songs.  It becomes outdated with the tenth level song: &quot;Anthem de Arms&quot; <br/>
(can it still be stacked with that, though?)<br/>
