<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646525587">Stop by the local magic shop and buy some egg shaped pumice stones.  Save<br/>
one for breaking root and use the other for de-spelling his buffs on him<br/>
and/or pet.  Do lev 15 mages have damage shields? There might be some other<br/>
items you can get there that would be handy... invis portions (and sit to<br/>
regen hp - can you bandage your self while invis?), shadow step potions, not<br/>
too sure if any of the healing/regen ones are any good or not - one<br/>
heal/regen also roots you - heh, cast that on him to root him or drag his<br/>
pet away and root it and then see if your CoD and weps can beat the healing<br/>
effects?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a fun event!<br/>

&gt; If you don&#39;t want to be quite so dirty, I&#39;d drag the pet away,<br/>
&gt; run back and attack the mage, drag the pet away again when it<br/>
&gt; returns, repeat.  You can use Warsong and melee to hope to<br/>
&gt; interrupt his casting, or Accel to try to get out of range<br/>
&gt; before his spell fires (note that neither consumes mana, so<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d be relying on fizzles to deplete his mana).  And if the<br/>
&gt; pet roots you...<br/>
<br/>
pumice stones - dont leave home without one<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The key I think is that you can stay out of attack range and<br/>
&gt; heal indefinitely, while he cannot (gotta run out of bandages<br/>
&gt; some time). </span></blockquote></div>
