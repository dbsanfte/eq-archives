&gt;This happened to me a while back while killing Dervs in NRo.  But<br/>
&gt;I stayed unconscious long enough for my friends to re-appear back<br/>
&gt;in Freeport and run back to the camp!<br/>

the Hymn of Restoration as I lay prostrate.  I had been poisoned by a giant <br/>
spider and collapsed as I looted it&#39;s corpse.  Twice I stood up, only to <br/>
fall again as poison and hymn battled with each other.  Hymn won out, and I <br/>
limped back to the nearest guard to regain my strength.  Just another one of <br/>
those EQ magic moments!<br/>
