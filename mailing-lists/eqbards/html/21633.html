<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829760057">Wow, I refuse to weave in downtime, unless there is a real good reason.  (IE<br/>
spawn timer running down, on a corpse retrival)  My fingers can;t take the<br/>
strain, and I need down time to rest myself.  I&#39;m hoping once I get these<br/>
macros going, I can weave in down time with minimal button mashing, but<br/>
until then...</div>
