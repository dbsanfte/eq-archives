<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-156010087">I remember being frustrated around 10th level, and I also chose<br/>
Steamfont to level up in. Let me first say that Steamfont is a great<br/>
place to gain experience. I spent alot of my time grouped with a friend<br/>
who is a cleric, and we did quite well, dying extremely infrequently.<br/>
The trick with groups is that many people do not understand the benefits<br/>
of a bard on a party. Part of that is because some bards (namely ones<br/>
that don&#39;t read this list *smile*) don&#39;t give our class a very good<br/>
showing. They may not twist songs, or use their songs effectively. They<br/>
also may not have good weapons or have weak armor (examples would be a<br/>
L20 bard still wearing patchwork leather with some banded). Also keep in<br/>
mind that your damage in battle will significantly increase when you get<br/>
Bellow. It&#39;s like getting a kick that always hits (unless resisted).<br/>
<br/>
The wonders of bards to me seem to be more subtle. We are neither the<br/>
nuking mage nor stereotypically the tank (although perioidcally I do<br/>
more damage then the tanks in our group, and take more hits).Our healing<br/>
song is a more subtle heal then that of the cleric, etc. However, given<br/>
a perceptive group they will know the benfit of the bard. Especially<br/>
once you leave, and they realize just how long their downtime is without<br/>
Hymn of Restoration healing 8-10 ever 5 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice to say, hang in there, and start by finding 1-2 people that are<br/>
good to group with, then go from there.<br/>
