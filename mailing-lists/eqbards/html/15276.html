<b>Subject:</b> RE: New Lullaby theory <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-123002627">I regretfully tell you that I was a couple of levels below level 15 when the<br/>
patch that nerfed Lullaby went in, so I&#39;ve never seen what it could do<br/>
pre-nerf.  My experience with lullaby even at level 15 was that &quot;it&#39;s a<br/>
great taunt song&quot;.  I&#39;ve never been able to reliably crowd control to this<br/>
date.  I guess when I get charm in four more levels I&#39;ll be able to control<br/>
a crowd of three, but if pixie strike is as bugged as Lullaby I guess that<br/>
will be the best I will ever do.<br/>

This make the most sense of all the theories I&#39;ve heard so far...  As a<br/>
programmer - I am often surprised when a user tells me of a &quot;new bug&quot; in<br/>
code that I know I haven&#39;t touched since the application was installed many<br/>
months before.  My gut reaction is that the user is making a mistake not me.<br/>
<br/>
What often is the case - is the data changed - or the users started using a<br/>
seemingly unrelated feature of the application where the interaction exposed<br/>
the bug that never was exposed before.<br/>
<br/>
I can see GZ and company chuckling to themselves; they know they haven&#39;t<br/>
touched that code - why would it not work?<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby sure worked great for me back when I was a in my teens and lower<br/>
twenties - so I assumed the change was from a patch; not the simple fact<br/>
that I&#39;m level 36...<br/>

&gt; This theory came up on the concert hall board.  A bard there<br/>
&gt; claimed to have used Lullaby with great success in Runnyeye.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyways, my new theory is that somewhere in the resist check<br/>
&gt; when GZ should&#39;ve used the mob&#39;s level, he accidently used the<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s level.  So if you (the bard) are relatively low level,<br/>
&gt; the song works reasonably well against even con mobs.  But if<br/>
&gt; you are high level, the minimum resist rate is that of a high<br/>
&gt; level mob.<br/>
