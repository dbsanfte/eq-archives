&gt; IMHO - this is a terrible flaw of EQ and needs to be rectified.  Improving<br/>
&gt; Crowd Control capabilities of Bards helped; and improving healing for<br/>
&gt; Shamans and Clerics could be another.  Perhaps there are other better ways<br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t involved &quot;nerfing&quot; clerics indirectly...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with both sides of this :-(<br/>
<br/>
I hate when I can&#39;t get a group going because we lack a cleric.  However<br/>
clerics give up a LOT to be as good at healing as they are. If you are going<br/>
to improve shaman/druid healing, clerics better get thrown a pretty big bone<br/>
too.<br/>
