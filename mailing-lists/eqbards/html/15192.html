&gt; see invis song is still useful. Clouding only gives party see invis. In<br/>
&gt; other words, the only invis you can see are the members of your party that<br/>
&gt; you have invissed. You do not see all invisible creatures and players,<br/>

under their own spell or yours. :)  But, your point stands that you can&#39;t<br/>
see anyone else outside your party who is invised.<br/>
