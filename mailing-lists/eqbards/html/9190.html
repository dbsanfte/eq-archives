<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546018340">Cool, thanks for the tip as every one I have seen auctioned was for 150pp+.<br/>
That&#39;s highway robbery!  Every one was a flippin wolf too.  Why is it the<br/>
druid class seems to attract unpleasant people so much, wonder if that&#39;s<br/>
where the idea for the Unkempt Druids came from };-)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe how many tells I have gotten over my shin greaves and shin<br/>
gauntlets.  Apparently the color is one many people find appealing.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t have the heart to tell them I will be getting rid of them as soon as<br/>
I can get their paired components.<br/>

&gt; I am kicking myself in the head!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night, someone in South Karana was auctioning a lambent stone for 25<br/>
&gt; plat!!!!  And I had nooo cash :(((<br/>
<br/>
If you really want lambent stones, go to the Rathe Mountains.  <br/>
I see a couple shouts every night saying free lambent stone on<br/>
a giant corpse.  They drop frequently enough that a party of 6<br/>
can each get one in an hour or two, and can&#39;t loot any more.<br/>
