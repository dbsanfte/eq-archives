I like being a bard!<br/>

&gt;One thing about being a bard.. people seem to be very nice to you, for some<br/>
&gt;reason.  A dwarf warrior gave me a small bronze cloak, and someone else <br/>
&gt;gave<br/>
&gt;me a Mithril Quill, both while I was just hanging out near the bank in<br/>
&gt;Freeport waiting for someone.  Others have giving me things, or &#39;traded&#39;<br/>
&gt;things as well, where it was obvious I was getting the better end of <br/>
&gt;things.<br/>
&gt;I hope this continues into the future. :)  Maybe someone will be nice <br/>
&gt;enough<br/>
&gt;to give me some lambent armor.  &lt;wink, wink, nudge, nudge&gt;<br/>
