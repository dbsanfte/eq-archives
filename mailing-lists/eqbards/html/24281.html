<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815660542">Did you say Engineer? /em runs away screaming! (I keep saying I&#39;m going to<br/>
write a book on my experiences in the Nuclear industry, lots of stories<br/>

For exp before 50 Kedge Keep rocks, but you need a decent group. Through the<br/>
mid 40&#39;s the second floor is great, then you move in past Estrella&#39;s Mermaid<br/>
Bordello to the Roman Pleasure palace. As you get better, you can pull a<br/>
wider and wider area from either loc. Leveled my bard about 12 levels there<br/>
and now my wiz is leveling there too. I will say I am completely conditioned<br/>
to yell for EB whenever I hear a Palm Pilot beep. Coworkers just don&#39;t<br/>
understand &#39;Stone now!&#39; though.<br/>
