<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543247657">I found the last statement to be very contradicting.  Hasn&#39;t the bard<br/>
community, on numerous occasions to no avail, sent Verant extensive test<br/>
results proving that some of our songs weren&#39;t working properly?  Wonder why<br/>
they are now asking players to send them test results when they seem to have<br/>
ignored ours for the most part?<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully GZ&#39;s response to Rokenn&#39;s post will have good news and Verant will<br/>
agree that the bardic issues we have raised need to be addressed.<br/>
