for pulling off mobs that have frenzied.  Just be sure the guy<br/>
low on health is getting healed while the mob is charmed<br/>
(instead of standing around wondering why the mob stopped<br/>
attacking, and then deciding to take advantage of the pause by<br/>
trying to hit it with a few spells to finish it off).<br/>
Otherwise when the mob becomes uncharmed, it&#39;ll look around,<br/>
see this almost-dead guy, and decide to off him first.<br/>
