singing the lyrics and then add a line a two from another song that happens<br/>
to be in the same key? (If you&#39;re old enough to recall Live Aid, I&#39;m<br/>
referring to what U2 did singing Ruby Tuesday over Bad)<br/>
<br/>
Not trying to nit-pick, just that I&#39;m also into the rp side of it & don&#39;t<br/>
think stacking is necessarily out of character.</div>
