<div id="ygrps-yiv-282855366">I totally agree.....I dont remember the starting amount, but I&#39;m a half elf<br/>
and put points to raise my Str to 77, 90 Charisma, and the rest is in Dex<br/>
and Agility....I dont get hit alot by creatures, albiet when they do hit me<br/>
it usually hurts, but getting 1 hit for 5 or so misses really is nice, plus<br/>
I use piercing, so I am almost always getting full damage for my level every<br/>
stab I get....I have a few different Str+ items, Spiked Collar, Str<br/>
earrings, and a few other things and I do ok with it....I dont really think<br/>
I would have wanted to change anything yet...<br/>

&gt;Unless you get your Str over 100 and get the mythical str bonus I disagree.<br/>
&gt;I put all my stats and buffs into Dex and Agil, my feeling is if they cat<br/>
&gt;hit ya they cant hurt ya. I almost always hit for near max dmg and any blue<br/>
&gt;mob will miss me 9 out of 10 tries either from Dodge or straight misses. My<br/>
&gt;high Dex makes my PGT fire off its spell several times per battle so that<br/>
&gt;makes me invulnerable the few times I am hit. My Shaman partner buffs me as<br/>
&gt;well when we are together bringing Str to 121 Dex and Agil to 151, casts<br/>
&gt;quickness and I am a whirlin twirlin Ginsu choppin machine. But just my<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; You know what&#39;s really sad?  I wrestle with the decision to restart<br/>
&gt;&gt; my currently &quot;of the 11th Chorus.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t pump my strength all the way, I had decided when creating my<br/>
&gt;&gt; character to &quot;play the bard&quot; -- which meant being a great singer /<br/>
&gt;&gt; instrumentalist  and  being an extremely charismatic person.  So I<br/>
&gt;&gt; have 100 Dexterity and 100 Charisma.  My strength is only 80.  (I do<br/>
&gt;&gt; have the basic +2 ring from a jeweler friend, and a purity belt, but<br/>
&gt;&gt; I would really like to get some earmufflers!)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The first time I donned my banded tunic, I was awed by how good I<br/>
&gt;&gt; look in it.  Admit it, how many characters get that golden armor look<br/>
&gt;&gt; without resorting to bronze?  And then when you complete the outfit<br/>
&gt;&gt; (I actually hate the headpiece, so I never bought it), you get that<br/>
&gt;&gt; golden/blue-boy look.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; But the damn thing was so heavy that you have to watch what you loot.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  And I was training my tailoring at the time.  Not to mention the<br/>
&gt;&gt; inordinate amount of time it takes to loot your own corpse.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So, off goes the armor, into two backpacks in the bank, and I started<br/>
&gt;&gt; my poaching-in-the-nude era.  That&#39;s also when I saw my Defense skill<br/>
&gt;&gt; finally catch up with my level.  That&#39;s also when I first met Ness<br/>
&gt;&gt; (who probably conned me red, inspected my inventory and found out I<br/>
&gt;&gt; wasn&#39;t wearing anything ...)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Well, anyway, back to the present.  I&#39;m level 11 now, and the only<br/>
&gt;&gt; monsters I can get exp from are those that do incredible amounts of<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage and have bash skills to boot.  I come out at half life with<br/>
&gt;&gt; blues, and blacks can kill me if I don&#39;t kite them around the block a<br/>
&gt;&gt; few times while I heal up.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; One time after getting easily killed by a darkweed, I decided to take<br/>
&gt;&gt; the banded out of cold storage.  Lo and behold.  Darkweed, easy solo.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Young Kodiak, can&#39;t even hit me enough times before it starts<br/>
&gt;&gt; running away.  I was a happy poacher with two HQ bear pelts, and four<br/>
&gt;&gt; HQ cat pelts.  Granted, I was encumbered at 100 lbs, but when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; fighting, my two songs give just enough strength not to suffer any<br/>
&gt;&gt; encumberance penalties.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Still, it would be nice to have 100 strength in the first place, just<br/>
&gt;&gt; so I can walk to the inn instead of crawling.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Pheh.  Hopefully I&#39;ll find some more strength boosting items soon.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; just need to make money now.....<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Quit on Stormtower?  NEVER!  Well ... not a second time ...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; (My original character was Sturmtower, who reached level 4 before I<br/>
&gt;&gt; decided that agility doesn&#39;t do as much as dexterity.  I didn&#39;t twink<br/>
&gt;&gt; -- there was nothing to twink at that level anyway.  But ol&#39;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Stormtower _is_ not really the original.)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt; Stormtower of the 11th Chorus<br/>
&gt;&gt; a very happy new owner of a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
&gt;&gt; and subsequently cash poor<br/>
