&gt; version of this song would be perfect for the level 39 slot if not just a<br/>
&gt; tad late.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That was my major gripe with it going in at 39, it&#39;s just too late<br/>
  at that point.  Not too late for Lguk, just in general most classes<br/>
  with invis undead get it very early in the game.  This song should<br/>
  have come soon after our L19 song.  I&#39;m not arguing that having it<br/>
  wouldn&#39;t be nice.  It&#39;s just I have no problem with bumming an <br/>
  invis from someone at the zoneline.  People are usually pretty<br/>
  helpful in that manner.<br/>
