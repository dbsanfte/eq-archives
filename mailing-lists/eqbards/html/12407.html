<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-130870936">I noticed Ogguk has become increasingly easy to visit since the guards are<br/>
getting killed regularly.  Watch out though, I have seen a merchant stuck in<br/>
the front area before and those will whip you like a goblin whelp if you<br/>
appear near them.<br/>

Also the flute will likely be gone shortly after you enter Cazic<br/>

  The flute will disappear as quick as anything else would.  5 mins?<br/>
  I dunno, drop some foraged grubs on the ground and start a timer.<br/>
