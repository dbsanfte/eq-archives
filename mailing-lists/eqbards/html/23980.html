<div id="ygrps-yiv-396534032">Only double the percentage of non-anon, non-rp bards on Xegony.  Highly<br/>
unlikely to be the same thing.  You&#39;ll never see Kitasi pop up on a /who all<br/>
bard on E&#39;ci as I am always /roleplay.  Also most of those people logged<br/>
onto pvp servers are not engaging in pvp activities most of the time.  The<br/>
decision to balance anything because of pvp is one of Verant&#39;s most<br/>
ludicrous ideas.  Even if every single one of the people in your example was<br/>
engaged in pvp when you took the sample they would still only constitute<br/>
less than 7% of the people playing.   Since that is 7% out of two possible<br/>
choices it is an insignificant amount.  4% out of 14 possible choices on the<br/>
other hand is not insignificant by comparison.<br/>
<br/>
Also yes bards may be less than 5% of the population on some servers.  But,<br/>
since you are taking a sub-part that is virtually guaranteed to be small in<br/>
percentage your argument has no weight.  If there were an equal number of<br/>
every class in the populations then bards would still only number 7.14%<br/>
(100/14).  Given that fact, even 3% would be a very significant percentage<br/>
since they would still number half as many as could be expected all else<br/>
being equal.  <br/>
<br/>
Statistical analysis guarantees in fact that if a classes percentage falls<br/>
below a certain threshold in relation to this equality, then that class is<br/>
in fact underpowered or less enjoyable to play.  If all the classes were<br/>
equally balanced then the percentages of each across such a large base would<br/>
be effectively equivalent to 100/14.  The unmistakable fact that it is not<br/>
is analytical proof that the classes were not balanced in terms of power<br/>
level, usefulness, and enjoyability.  Apparently someone at Verant finally<br/>
realized this which is why we see so many intensive changes recently.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I laugh whenever someone says that bards are overpowered.  The<br/>
statement is ludicrous on its very face.  If that were true, in a game<br/>
dominated by the mechanics of level advancement and ability to overpower<br/>
foes, then there would be more than the flat (100/14)% bards.  There are<br/>
not.  It is not because bards are some great secret either.  Sure a lot of<br/>
people don&#39;t know all that bards can do, but that is because it takes far,<br/>
far more work to play a bard than any other class.  Probably why I like<br/>
them, they are much more challenging.  Anybody can hit autoattack and the<br/>
occasional taunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>
