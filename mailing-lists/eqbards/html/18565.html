<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122927955">i&#39;m speechless.  i&#39;ve never had an opinion of FoH (heard of them but big<br/>
deal it&#39;s another server i&#39;ve never logged on) until now.<br/>
<br/>
sounds like these guys are ruining the experience for a massive amount of<br/>
people.  i hope they get systematically banned if they&#39;re still doing this.<br/>
<br/>
(true, individuals and actions speak louder than mob rule, but silently<br/>
wearing a guild tag that condones this action is as good as holding the<br/>
victims down for the mugging)<br/>

I&#39;ve seen them come in and KS<br/>
Nagafen when another guild was still fighting him.  With the excuse that &quot;He<br/>
would have killed you anyway&quot; and absolutely no remorse or apology for<br/>
KS&#39;ing the dragon, taking all the loot and calling the other guild a bunch<br/>
of losers among other things.<br/>
