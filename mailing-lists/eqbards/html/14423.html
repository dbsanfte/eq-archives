 </span></blockquote>This is actually a gripe of mine too with nearly all the RPGs<br/>
I&#39;ve seen.  The way the rules work, the best strategy is for<br/>
everyone to concentrate on one opponent at a time, while the<br/>
extras beat on you.  In real combat, that&#39;ll get you killed<br/>
real quick since the extras will be getting free shots at your<br/>
backside.  I&#39;d really like to see a CRPG with some sort of<br/>
engagement/disengagement system.  Then the warrior wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have to taunt, he&#39;d just step between the cleric and mob and<br/>
engage the mob in combat.  If the mob turned to attack the<br/>
cleric, the warrior would get a free shot in for max or<br/>
critical damage.  Yes this would require mobs to have better<br/>
AI, which IMHO is always a good thing.<br/>
