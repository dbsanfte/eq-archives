<div id="ygrps-yiv-20061841">I&#39;m suprised verant lets you keep that name, but then again, despite the so<br/>
called rules on character names I have seen a lot of stupid player names<br/>
(not saying yours is stupid).  <br/>
<br/>
I *almost* reported a pc one afternoon at the bazaar on E&#39;ci - I was<br/>
auctioning a couple of black pearls at the tunnel and got a tell from an<br/>
enchanter named &quot;Balonie&quot; who said to come meet her by the first inn.  I ran<br/>
over and when I got close to her I saw that her last name was &quot;Sandwych&quot; -<br/>
and this was no newbie either.  It kind of ticked me off at first but I<br/>
finally I decided not to be whistle blower and went ahead and sold the<br/>
pearls and went about my business.<br/>
