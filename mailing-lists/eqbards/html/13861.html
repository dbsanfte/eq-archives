<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001716107"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; People would be running all over and yelling &quot;Hey I see WaxOnius, has<br/>
&gt; anyone seen WaxOffius?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That reminds me.  Another thing I would change is the AI so<br/>
that if you attack a named social mob, it would aggro nearby<br/>
mobs regardless of whether or not they&#39;re &quot;afraid of&quot; (green<br/>
to) you.  Likewise if you attack a green mob near a named mob,<br/>
the named mob would aggro, causing all other nearby mobs to<br/>
aggro.  Currently, it&#39;s too easy for a high level player to<br/>
run through a low level dungeon, find the named mobs (easy<br/>
with tracking), and kill just them with little risk to<br/>
himself.<br/>
