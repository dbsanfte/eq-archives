<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261072965">Let me clarify my earlier post.  I was referencing John Kim&#39;s recent post<br/>
comparing Bind and Chain where he showed that both of them reduced attack<br/>
speed by 25%.  The recent patch message states Chain now works better and<br/>
Lost Child posted that Chain is now resisted more but works better.  What I<br/>
was trying to get was a clarification on what Lost Child meant by &quot;works<br/>
better&quot;.  In other words, does Chain now slow down attack speed by more than<br/>
25% or does it work the way it did prior to two patches ago (i.e. Chain once<br/>
again works on mobs that are SOWed plus you get a success/failure message).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the confusion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 3)  Chain is resisted more but works better.  Yesterday John Kim posted<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; numbers that Chain reduced attack speed by around 25%.  Does that mean<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the new changes this % is even higher.  For the more experienced bards,<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; this a good thing or would you rather have a higher chance for the spell<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; work and keep the 25% reduced attack rate?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, the attack speed reduction has always been there, even<br/>
&gt; when I first tested it some two months ago when I first got<br/>
&gt; Chain.  I only retested it because some people were insisting<br/>
&gt; that it stacked with Binding, which wasn&#39;t what I found when I<br/>
&gt; first tested it.  As far as I know, there has been no change<br/>
&gt; to the degree of attack slowdown.<br/>
