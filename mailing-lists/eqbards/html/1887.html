&gt; &gt; Try this if you are fighting bigtime casters, put on a drum <br/>
&gt; and sit that<br/>
&gt; &gt; melee out, play guardian AND elemental rhythms, and see how <br/>
&gt; happy everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; is with 100+ magic resistance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At L19, Guardian Rhythms raised magic resist by +25 using a<br/>
&gt; drum.  Elemental Rhythms raised it by +25 as well.  At L20, it<br/>
&gt; was +27 each.  So I imagine it&#39;ll be a while before I can use<br/>
&gt; just these two songs to get everyone&#39;s magic resist to 100.<br/>
&gt; Right now I can only do that if a spellcaster casts Endure<br/>
&gt; Magic first.<br/>

but if most ppl have average of 25 MR, and have an item that boosts it at<br/>
all, you can still get 80+ at your level.<br/>

&gt; That will feel very strange, not having Restoration memorized.<br/>
&gt; :-)  Does Clarity increase the mana regeneration rate only<br/>
&gt; during meditation, or all the time?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are right, it was weird at first. Since the higher you get the harder it<br/>
is to pick 8 songs to memorize, i now use the top slot for<br/>
accelerando/restoration.  most of your time at higher levels you spend in a<br/>
dungeon, where accelerando will not work anyway.  when i am inside i use<br/>
hymn, outside accelerando.<br/>
<br/>
It increases mana regen at all times, but like my opinion on restoration, it<br/>
is much better off after fighting while the casters are meditating, as it is<br/>
just not worth it during a fight.<br/>

&gt; We pulled off one helluva feat last night.  One of the<br/>
&gt; low-level paladins kept insisting on pulling, and due to the<br/>
&gt; monster frenzy thing, we ended up with an entire orc camp and<br/>
&gt; just about every orc nearby on us, along with a couple undead.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d estimate there were about 12-15 orcs total, ranging from<br/>
&gt; green to white to me at L20.  I pulled every trick I knew with<br/>
&gt; lullaby, getting the train fixated on me, then running around<br/>
&gt; in circles nearby while the group finished off the few orcs<br/>
&gt; that stuck with them.  Then I&#39;d swing through the group again<br/>
&gt; to let them pick off a few more orcs, repeat.  It was close<br/>
&gt; and a lot of passerbys jumped in to help, but we all lived.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think we could&#39;ve done it if the group hadn&#39;t learned<br/>
&gt; the &quot;everyone attack the same mob&quot; and &quot;let the bard handle<br/>
&gt; the train&quot; strategies I&#39;ve been pounding into them. <br/>
