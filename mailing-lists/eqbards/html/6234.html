<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036246379">Im on a P2 400Mhz, 256 Megs (still get swapping sounds from time to time, <br/>
wonder why?) and ISDN from Europe with an avg. ping of 250.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem twisting three songs unless:<br/>
<br/>
1. Stunned (Oh, dont we hate em :)<br/>
2. Lagged (Oh, dont we hate it :)<br/>
3. Casters generate to much fireworks with multiple mobs, this seem to bog <br/>
down my machine.<br/>
4. Mob resists a lot<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately one of the above will often be true. For me going from two to <br/>
three songs was just a matter of practice,  but wour machine/connection may <br/>
well set the limit lower. As for twisting 4 songs...John how do you do it??? <br/>
Most impressive! Do you stop the songs before the effect message shows? Ive <br/>
noticed thay you can stop a song slightly before the message shows and still <br/>
get the message pop up a sec later.<br/>
<br/>
As for remembering to equip my weapons, not sure I will ever learn hehe.<br/>

&gt;3.´┐¢ You&#39;re doing what am doing - I got ISDN and fastest PC you can buy - <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;I think maybe if i am lucky and dont get stunned I can get 3 going.´┐¢ But 2<br/>
&gt;for me - even 2 with screen icons is hard enough.´┐¢ John Kim is the only one<br/>
&gt;I know that has reported 4 songs - but that&#39;s a huge achievement - he must<br/>
&gt;be well out of melee combat when he does.´┐¢ I think 3 would be great but am<br/>
&gt;pretty happy if i can do 2 and remeber to equip my weps.<br/>
