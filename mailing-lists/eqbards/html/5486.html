&gt;Well it&#39;s me again. I&#39;m sorry if my appology about my english is bothering<br/>
&gt;you but I said that because I mean it. The fact is that I got a few mails<br/>
&gt;about my language and they weren&#39;t very pleasent to read. If you think my<br/>
&gt;english is good enough then I can say just one thing. Thanks god at least<br/>
&gt;one. Beleive me this is the first mail in which my english is mentioned as<br/>
&gt;something good. So I&#39;ll never write that appology about my language again.<br/>
&gt;I hope I didn&#39;t iritate you to much, If I did then I&#39;m sorry I just wanted<br/>
&gt;to help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heck, I&#39;m just glad y&#39;all can play the game.  Everquest is written in<br/>
English, and I&#39;m sure that makes it a pain in the rear for non-English<br/>
speaking players to understand quests and such.  I&#39;ve seen numerous sites<br/>
in other languages, so I know there are lots of &#39;foreign&#39; players (It&#39;s the<br/>
internet, how can we be foreigners?).  I myself have been accused of being<br/>
British on more than one occasion, which, personally, I find quite<br/>
humourous. ;)<br/>
Anyway, keep on trucking, and if you understood this missive, yer probably<br/>
more than qualified to post here.  Bad grammar and all.<br/>

Did I mention that Bards rule?<br/>

P.S. Where *are* you from, you english-as-a-second-language types?<br/>
