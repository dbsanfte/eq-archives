<div id="ygrps-yiv-84210997">I think you answered your own question - did you end the night with a good<br/>
amount of xp _gained_??? I think not.  Not with 2 or 3 deaths.<br/>
<br/>
Getting the message is one thing.  Yes, a 33 gets the message when grouped<br/>
with a 50 (if you say so - I never actually tested it.)  After 2 hours of<br/>
grouping with many people in the group &gt;5 levels above does he have a bub of<br/>
xp? No.  When I talk about getting xp (at a good rate), I don&#39;t mean seeing<br/>
the message after a kill.  I mean seeing a full bub of xp every 90 minutes.<br/>
When I was grouped with them, we fought for 3 hours and I had _less_ than<br/>
half a bub.<br/>
<br/>
I still do group with them but for the sake of getting xp I need a group<br/>
where I am very near the top in levels.  Having one person &gt;5 levels higher<br/>
is sorta ok but not having 4 of the 5 of us &gt;5 higher.   I grouped with<br/>
Nadare (45 enchanter) and she and I killed spectres (ok she killed em, I<br/>
chained em and pumped her with mana & heals after combats.)  I was 36 and<br/>
she was 45.  I was getting a bub and some about every 2-3hours (then we&#39;d<br/>
quit, I&#39;d go adventure, die and lose my gains - ugh.)  I got 4 bubs that way<br/>
- trouble is - same four bubs over and over. <br/>
<br/>
Now I have seen some people power gaming xp by having a 50 babysit them:<br/>
they group and attack stuff that is too green to give the 50 xp but blue<br/>
enough for the lower level.  That is one technique if you have some really<br/>
good 50 friends to endure the boredom with you.  Also, I have seen and done<br/>
this: enchanter and cleric beat the crap out of an avo, ench mem blurs it,<br/>
bard kills it when its down to only a sliver of hp.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I prefer grouping for mobs that are hard for the group but<br/>
feasible - ie: you can win and if you do you get good xp.  Right now Kith is<br/>
pretty good for me - like I said a couple times: if I can be near the top of<br/>
the levels of the group.  There are lots of mobs and if we are smart<br/>
(assist) and well balanced (healer), we can win.  If you go to places with<br/>
people who are much higher level than you, the mobs will also be much higher<br/>
level - and you will die.  Bards die - a lot. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
p.s. the times I have grouped with level 50&#39;s we attacked stuff that was too<br/>
red for me to get xp from.  Zazamoukh for one.  Ogerfiend for another.  The<br/>
named tree in NK (Xan-something) I disbanded to avoid the faction hits.<br/>
Hmm, me and Alyx do camp the WK ogers from time to time and most are too<br/>
green &lt;g&gt; but I do get xp from Chief Goomba and the occasional sha-person<br/>
(or did - it&#39;s been a couple levels.) Hehe, maybe I should see if he will<br/>
baby sit me on some guards somewhere &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

		A character as low as level 33 can get experience grouped<br/>
with people right up <br/>
		to level 50.  Why don&#39;t you join them?  I had a great time<br/>
the other night <br/>
		camping the Savant room in Lower Guk with a bunch of<br/>
mid-forties.  If I hadn&#39;t <br/>
		rushed off to loot a Basalt Carapace and forgotten to get<br/>
myself re-invised to <br/>
		undead after looting (thus creating an amusingly huge train<br/>
of froggies and <br/>
		skeletons), I would have made it through six hours without<br/>
dying once, and I <br/>
		got two bubbles net, anyway.  (I wouldn&#39;t have died at all<br/>
if the <br/>
		bleepity-bleep wizard had kept enough mana for an evac.  He<br/>
managed to med up  <br/>
		just in time to see me croak.)  (Well, I take it back - I<br/>
died 30 seconds into <br/>
		our very first fight.  The Cleric, who is really quite good,<br/>
told me that he <br/>
		had forgotten just how fast Bards can dump Hit Points if<br/>
four things are <br/>
		whacking them.  hehe)<br/>
