<div id="ygrps-yiv-998768488"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The lament song will be a good one for in about 2 more levels <br/>
&gt; and then up.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Not to pick on your grammar, Sylly, but I&#39;m not sure what you meant right<br/>
&gt;there.  Are you saying it won&#39;t do me much good until 2 more levels (level<br/>
&gt;10) and then it will always be a keeper?  Or are you saying after level 10<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;won&#39;t use it much?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lament is a great song, you will still be using it long after 10th level.  I<br/>
use it quite often at 18th and my group laments (doh, the regular non-magic<br/>
kind) when I am not around to play it cause they can&#39;t handle 3 of the<br/>
things we usually can get one at a time when I am there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At your age you can be hunting the first and mid parts of <br/>
&gt; BlackBurrow Paw.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Hmm, I&#39;d been liking West Karana.  Room to run, less lag.  I&#39;ll have to<br/>
&gt;check out Paw though.  Can&#39;t stand Blackburrow.  Is the loot in Paw similar<br/>
&gt;to that in BB?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Far better Loot in Paw than Blackburrow. I too hated Blackburrow until I<br/>
made 10th level when the trash gnolls started to ignore me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can get Menkes Tolbet in South Qeynos to make you Snake Fang <br/>
&gt; Necklaces and<br/>
&gt; re-sell those in the snake places in east commonlands for 1 <br/>
&gt; to 2pp. Their<br/>
&gt; value goes way up when your buyer is sitting there with the <br/>
&gt; poison icon on<br/>
&gt; his screen &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;THANK YOU!!  I thought I needed a cleric to cure poison.  This is very good<br/>
&gt;to know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t get too excited they only give a bonus to poison resistance.  You can<br/>
get a bracelet with 14 charges of cure poison from a Quest in Misty Thicket<br/>
though.  I have gone thru 3 of these to date and am on my 4th.<br/>

&gt; NPC&#39;s near Surefall <br/>
&gt; Glade (Baobob and Chanda Miller).  They will <br/>
&gt; make wolf and  bear hide armor <br/>
&gt; items that are usuable by the caster class.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Aaaahhh!!!  I&#39;ve been selling those pelts!!  Of course, on Tunare, the<br/>
&gt;Millers&#39; life expectancies are about 3 seconds anyway...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had that problem too, but the campers agreed to let me speak to the<br/>
millers before they killed them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hmm, I was under the impression you had to keep them within the songs range<br/>
&gt;and keep lament in your mix of songs.  Guess not.  So, let&#39;s say I lament a<br/>
&gt;blue mob, pull a white mob off to the side & kill it, then decide to leave<br/>
&gt;the blue mob alone.  When the lament wears off, am I on it&#39;s hate list?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;if I am, will it come across a zone to find me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, if Lament succeeds you do not get on its hate list.  Also many times<br/>
when it is resisted you still do not get on its hate list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just WISH her lull lined worked as effectively as lament <br/>
&gt; has for me since<br/>
&gt; the day I got it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;So if lament is really that great, why are you higher level folks always<br/>
&gt;arguing about whether crowd control is best done with Lullaby, Chain, or<br/>
&gt;Charm?  Is it just that they hit multiple mobs at once?  Or are they better<br/>
&gt;than Lament even for single mobs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lament only works before a mob is after you.  It has no effect on a mob who<br/>
already has you in its sights, whereas Lullaby will put those mobs that are<br/>
running after you to sleep.  Lament is a before combat spell, Lullaby is a<br/>
during combat spell for the most part.<br/>
