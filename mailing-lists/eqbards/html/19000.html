<div id="ygrps-yiv-709111863">My thinking is simply that enough effort went into<br/>
that foraging page that if the cake were a foraged<br/>
item, it would have been noted.<br/>
<br/>
While the oven theory sounds very likely, no receipe<br/>
has surfaced...<br/>
<br/>
Obviously we are missing something here....<br/>
<br/>
My pet theory is there is a mail-bard somewhere in<br/>
Cabilis that will give the cake in exchange for yet<br/>
another quest and the cake and helmet are both<br/>
no-drop.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Below is a link to foraged items in kunark.  No<br/>
&gt; bundt<br/>
&gt; &gt; cake listed.  Maybe we are looking in the wrong<br/>
