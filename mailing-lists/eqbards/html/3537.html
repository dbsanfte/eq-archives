<b>Subject:</b> Necros wanting hymm of restoration <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776195010">:All necros I&#39;ve ever grouped with want me to play hymn of restoration and<br/>
:they claim it greatly helps their mana regen.  All other mana users see no<br/>
:increase in mana regen no matter what song I play.  Maybe this is a bug<br/>
that<br/>
:just affects Necros?<br/>
<br/>
Necros have a spell that swaps their hits for mana that acts over time (I<br/>
think they get this at 24), and so they take damage. When I am in a group<br/>
with one playing the Hymm, they dont take the damage :)<br/>
<br/>
Probably the reason they always want you to play it.....<br/>
