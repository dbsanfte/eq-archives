<div id="ygrps-yiv-21989516">Pure caster and priest types definitely cap at 255 (in-game spouse is a 50 <br/>
cleric). Good question about the hybrids though.<br/>
<br/>
I TOTALLY disagree with our musical skills capping at 200. I mean I think <br/>
i&#39;m doing ok with 200, but a Bard&#39;s main skills are song. Without song we <br/>
are basically a nerfed, useless version of every class (except our tracking <br/>
being superior to druids MUAHAHAHA... j/k). Song defines us. Magic defines a <br/>
wizard. Why the hell should they get 255 and not us? I mean what do we get <br/>
that we actually use that caps at 255? Swimming? Alcohol Tolerance?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;i was curious.  i have been thinking more about this lately.  do all the<br/>
&gt;pure caster classes have their casting skills (e.g. evocation) max out at<br/>
&gt;255?  along these lines, what skill caps do the priests (shaman, cleric,<br/>
&gt;druid) and hybrids (ranger, shadow knight, paladin) have?  i am almost<br/>
&gt;positive the pure casters max at 255, but i am not sure on the other <br/>
&gt;casting<br/>
&gt;classes.  and in our petition, was anything mentioned about our four song<br/>
&gt;skills capping at 255 instead of 200?  i can easily understand that they<br/>
&gt;should in fact cap at 200, was just wondering what everyone else thought,<br/>
&gt;and if it was mentioned.<br/>
