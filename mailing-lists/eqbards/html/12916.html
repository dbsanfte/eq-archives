&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sometimes wonder if Brad and Verant play the game the same way we do.<br/>
&gt; Over the last couple of levels, when I have died, the circumstances are<br/>
&gt; almost always the same.  Puller screws up and we get a bad pull.  I go into<br/>
&gt; crowd control mode to try to save the party.  Mobs all get pissed off at me.<br/>
&gt; At that point, one of two things always occur: 1) Because most of the mobs<br/>
&gt; are focused on me, I die and everyone else makes it out safely. 2)  Casters<br/>
&gt; gate out and leave me and the melee classes to fend for ourselves.  Melee<br/>
&gt; classes can still usually make it out safely since everything focused on me.<br/>
&gt; In either situation, the caster always gets out safely.  Over the past few<br/>
&gt; weeks, the only caster who has died in a party I was in was an enchanter who<br/>
&gt; did an AE mez on a nasty pull.  Mez wore off before we could get rid of them<br/>
&gt; all and she got bushwhacked when they woke up.  Since that occasion,<br/>
&gt; whenever I group with an enchanter, the only crowd control song I keep<br/>
&gt; memmed is lullaby.  I let the enchanter handle charm, mez and fear duties<br/>
&gt; and will only use lullaby as a backup if the enchanter is getting attacked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A lot of bards like to say enchanters and clerics are our best friends.  I<br/>
&gt; bet all the caster classes say a properly played bard is there best friend<br/>
&gt; because we draw all the mobs attention away from them (in addition to the<br/>
&gt; endless supply of caster crack we give them).    <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just posted in EQ Vault - it was posted by Brad McQuaid (EQ&#39;s producer<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Lead Designer) on the official forum:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...  The idea is that casters are more prone to dying and thus can bind<br/>
&gt; &gt; in more places.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmmm.  I did a /guildsay to ask my guild which class they think dies most<br/>
&gt; &gt; often.  The answers?:<br/>
