<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198834782">Pick-up groups in Blackburrow Paw or Crushbone suck. They continued to suck<br/>
in Unrest. Ditto, Cazic. Sol-B. And Lower Guk.  People just don&#39;t change<br/>
much.  You get the kind that is so focused on loot that unless they are<br/>
getting loot - they are sure someone else is stealing it from them.  They<br/>
don&#39;t trust others because they project their own personality traits.  On<br/>
our server, we have recent reports of a guy in lower guk stealing off a<br/>
party member who has died and has given consent to drag. Instead of getting<br/>
better at high levels - it seems like it gets worse.  <br/>
<br/>
In reality, it&#39;s just the same idiots but instead of level 5, they are level<br/>
50.  Do you honestly expect that someone is going to have major personality<br/>
changes in like 6 to 9 months simply by playing a computer game? Granted<br/>
some do, but for the most part - they don&#39;t. Any power they get just<br/>
enhances already ingrained traits.  Simply a guild does not cure this<br/>
either.  There are plenty of guilds with bickering about loots.  But if you<br/>
are guilded and you are with your guild group, at least you know what to<br/>
expect and you maybe have some standard loot rules.  <br/>

		Last night....  Got invited to a Plane of Sky trip - my<br/>
first trip to the planes.  It was not a guild trip but a bunch of people<br/>
just going.<br/>
<br/>
	So my question is this... what do I do?  I know in the<br/>
future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more clear rules<br/>
set up.  Does this happen on other servers?  Has this happened to any of<br/>
you?  <br/>
