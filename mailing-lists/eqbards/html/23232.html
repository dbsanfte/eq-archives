Subject: [eqbards] Detail level - Low ...?<br/>
<br/>
I personally love the particle effects and I never play with out them.  I<br/>
always kept the density set to low ...but the sparkles look the same to me<br/>
on low, med and high.  Is it just me?  I hit 39 last night and the particle<br/>
effects are killing me.  I don&#39;t want to turn them off but I am not seeing<br/>
a choice here.  Any suggestions?  I play in the &quot;out of body&quot; views already.<br/>
<br/>
