<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574693206">Bah.  I am almost never able to Chain wisp at level 27.  I haven&#39;t had chain<br/>
all that long so I can&#39;t speak to whether it&#39;s changed or not, I just know<br/>
it rarely, rarely sticks on the little lighbulbs even though they&#39;ve been<br/>
green to me for 10 levels.<br/>
<br/>
As for Gix - all bets are off with him.  You should know that!<br/>

&gt; Last night the Cerf.net servers all went down so I logged into Tarrew<br/>
&gt; Marr to play my bard for the first time in a while. I decided to go see<br/>
&gt; if I could kill some hill giants in W Commons and while looking ran<br/>
&gt; across Kizdean Gix. He attacked dispite being 20 odd levels below me and<br/>
&gt; I fired up chains intending to chain and fear him. Hmm. 8 resists in a<br/>
&gt; row. After killing him and determining there weren&#39;t any hill giants in<br/>
&gt; the zone, I happened to spot some big wisp spawns and killed them.<br/>
&gt; Again, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist rates gone up<br/>
&gt; on chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much trouble last<br/>
&gt; time I played my bard. My druid can get snare to stick on reds with more<br/>
&gt; reliability than this.<br/>
