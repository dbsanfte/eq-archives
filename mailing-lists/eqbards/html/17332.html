<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567901493">About a year ago or so - I did some research on video cards - and people<br/>
told me that TNT2 and better video cards -- with a processor speed of less<br/>
than 400 Mhz (I have a p2 300) you wouldn&#39;t see any improvement over a TNT<br/>
or a Voodoo3.  I got a Voodoo 3 2000 real cheap -so I stuck with that.<br/>
 BTW - I&#39;m oversimplifying what they said and these WERE people who knew<br/>
what they are talking about...<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone upgraded a Pentium II box ~300 Mhz to GeForce from a Voodoo3?<br/>
Did they see a significant improvement?<br/>
<br/>
Basically - I&quot;m holding out till fall or so to upgrade - and figured I&#39;d<br/>
just sit with what I have.<br/>
<br/>
Another question - how many games actually use 32-bti video?  I thought it<br/>
wasn&#39;t supportred in DX7?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you are running a PII computer and think you need to<br/>
&gt; &gt; upgrade to a PIII to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play some of these new games, I&#39;d highly recommend dropping<br/>
&gt; &gt; the $300 or so<br/>
&gt; &gt; (got my GeForce for $275) on a new video card instead and buy yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt; another 6 to 9 months before your framerates start to go south.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmm, what if that PII is only a 300 w/ 64 MB RAM?  Worth getting the card<br/>
