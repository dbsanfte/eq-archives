<div id="ygrps-yiv-363332356">I love Sol A, I know where every spawn is except for the Lava Elemental and<br/>
I would like to camp him (if I can do it solo that is). Also is he the<br/>
thing that drops the Amulet that sells for quite a bit. I would quite like<br/>
to get my hands on that item.<br/>
Does it spawn near the captain side or the King side?<br/>

&gt; are doing a major guild outing to Sol A to try the Predator, our scouting<br/>
&gt; expedition went well except for when the lava elemental wandered by.  We<br/>
&gt; suspect we were feign trained as when the corpse recovery team got back<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the room it was camped by another group.  Since the CR team was only gone<br/>
&gt; the length of time it took to run back from their gate point on the Sol B<br/>
&gt; zoneline, it was awfully convenient.  Especially since one of their<br/>
number<br/>
&gt; was a monk that two members were sure they saw dead as they ran towards<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; zoneline.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like it.  The lava elemental is pretty far the predator<br/>
spot.  OTOH, if it was a blazing elemental, that&#39;s a bit<br/>
closer.<br/>
<br/>
Weren&#39;t you the one who shot down my idea of faction hits for<br/>
getting other players killed?  It would really help with<br/>
situations like this (whether it was intentional or<br/>
accidental), forcing people to consider the consequences of<br/>
their escape attempt on others instead of only their own skin.<br/>
