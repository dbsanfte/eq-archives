&gt; I haven&#39;t been able to reproduce this at will, but I *think*<br/>
&gt; this happens when I charm a mob, order it to attack another<br/>
&gt; mob, it becomes uncharmed, a party member attacks it, and I<br/>
&gt; re-charm it.  I know it&#39;s not the command failing because the<br/>
&gt; charmed mob says the appropriate things but keeps right on<br/>
&gt; attacking.  Does anyone know what&#39;s up with this?<br/>

  I&#39;m guessing here because I don&#39;t use charm yet(4 and a half bubbles til I<br/>
get it), but I&#39;ve noticed some pretty weird things happening if you use the<br/>
/assist command to fight something another party member is fighting.  Are<br/>
you using /assist?<br/>
