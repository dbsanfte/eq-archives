<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; How about this in the leaching catagory. The mask of deception, my<br/>
&gt; &gt; understanding is that this rots a lot on most servers. I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; see a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; lower level bards with one. When I have 19th level invis song<br/>
&gt; &gt; is it possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get to the Assissin room (provided it&#39;s camped) and wait<br/>
&gt; &gt; patiently and<br/>
&gt; &gt; politly for one to drop?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tszaaz recently got one (at 35), I even got the kill! That was very<br/>
&gt; satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So the level range of the room is around 35?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; (making it more likely that you will get grieves). It is hard to see on<br/>

 </span></blockquote>life<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; will most likely depend on it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I might collect the greves, not sure, I might proceed with that quest with<br/>
my ranger.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bats and skellies will eat your lunch. Your invis will probably not cut it<br/>
&gt; either, which means you are going to have to offer to buy both of those<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a tolerant cleric. Why tolerant? I think that folks near the zone get a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tired of newbies making runs for nodrop stuff. So you have to make it<br/>
&gt; something they WANT to do, which means money or (if you are lucky and a<br/>
&gt; showman) entertainment. Money is your best bet. With the price of potions<br/>
&gt; coming down Invis to Undead potions might be a good buy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm ... I have a shaman friend that&#39;s getting close to Alchemy range ...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Next, make SURE that the BR and ass sup (assassin/supplier) are very<br/>
 </span></blockquote>camped.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I poped up in the BR one night to see it empty of all but Undead<br/>
&gt; Frogluks...I have NO idea how at 6 and *swimming* I lived. Next, *wait*<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mind you looting the mask. Drink your potions/get your spells and go. You<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t see on a map that it is up a ladder.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I do this, I do it naked, I&#39;m not going to have anything I&#39;m going to<br/>
need to come back for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now, cower behind some barrels trying hard to look like an inanimate<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Be aware that the group could get into trouble and evac. Also you could<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a good plan. My ranger will be playing there soon, I&#39;ll make<br/>
some friends so that later I can ask the favor. Thanks for the info.</div>
