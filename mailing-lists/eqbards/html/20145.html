&gt; &gt; understanding is that this rots a lot on most servers. I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; see a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; lower level bards with one. When I have 19th level invis song<br/>
&gt; &gt; is it possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get to the Assissin room (provided it&#39;s camped) and wait<br/>
&gt; &gt; patiently and<br/>
&gt; &gt; politly for one to drop?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tszaaz recently got one (at 35), I even got the kill! That was very<br/>
&gt; satisfying.<br/>
<br/>

my ranger.<br/>

&gt; coming down Invis to Undead potions might be a good buy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm ... I have a shaman friend that&#39;s getting close to Alchemy range ...<br/>
<br/>

some friends so that later I can ask the favor. Thanks for the info.</div>
