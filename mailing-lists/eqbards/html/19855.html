<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210763313">I remember helping out a cleric friend of mine on his armour quests<br/>
before, and Zahal is a part of that.<br/>
<br/>
We were looking for Zahal just south of the gypsy camp and tower, but<br/>
north of the wizzie spires.  It used to be on a regular timed spawn<br/>
and he had the times through good fortune, but they&#39;ll have been reset<br/>
since.  I do remember it was a long spawn time however :-(<br/>
<br/>
I think Zahal is the first one, I just remember that killing the first<br/>
made the second NPC spawn for the cleric armour, and the second one<br/>
spawns right at the north end, wanders a bit and then gets killed by<br/>
the werewolf hunters!!  Nasty!<br/>

&gt;&gt; Anyone know where in teh North Karana Zahal the Vile spawns? <br/>
&gt;&gt; I assume the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Undead Monolyth, but I spent a loooong time there and no Zahal. Hints?<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Also, Has Fabian been spotted yet?<br/>
