<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271893363"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     Is this song of ANY use whatsoever fighting Mobs?  Don&#39;t they have<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  They don&#39;t have unlimited mana.  I fought a cleric deepwater goblin<br/>
  caster for Kenross ;-) last week.<br/>
<br/>
  Brought the goblin to 1/4 health, and crap... I had charm mem&#39;d<br/>
  instead of pixie... /sigh  Goblin greater heals to 1/2, I beat him<br/>
  down again to 1/4, he greater heals, I beat him down, etc. etc.<br/>
 <br/>
  Then I see:<br/>
<br/>
  a deepwater goblin begins to cast a spell.<br/>
  a deepwater goblin feels better.<br/>
<br/>
  ??  Hmm... feels better = Light Healing.<br/>
<br/>
  I mush his face into the ground some more....1/4, 1/8....<br/>
  come on you dumb thing heal yourself!.... I know you want to.<br/>
<br/>
  You have slain a deepwater goblin.<br/>
  You gain experience. <br/>
<br/>
  uhh, woohoo (green exp!)  lol.<br/>
<br/>
  NPCs do _not_ _not_ _not_ have unlimited mana.<br/>
<br/>
  They have a whole s-load of it, and it regens very very fast<br/>
  when they are not in combat.  But once you see a mob spend alot<br/>
  of mana like this, The force shocks turn into burst of flame, and<br/>
  the healings turn into light healing.  You know the mob is running<br/>
  out of mana.  <br/>
<br/>
  The thing is you have to be much higher than the con of the mob<br/>
  in order to make it become spent from casting.  I imagine a white<br/>
  con caster could kill you 2-4 times over with the amount of mana<br/>
  it has.<br/>
