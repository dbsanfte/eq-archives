<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067928100">Well, in addition to all that has been said about fae drakes, let me add my<br/>
two CP:<br/>
<br/>
1 cp)They tend to swarm! If I ever take one on, I check the surrounding are<br/>
very carefully.<br/>
<br/>
2 cp)I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Norrath, Karma or the Gods, but I crash about a<br/>
third of the time when dealing with Fae Drakes. Sometimes during combat,<br/>
sometimes after a kill, sometimes if they&#39;re just on my screen! No other<br/>
creature has had this effect on me. Has anyone else seen this?<br/>
