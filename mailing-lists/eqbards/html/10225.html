<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720581783"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I would assume that if Chords of Cessation&#39;s slowing effect is messing up a <br/>
&gt; shaman&#39;s Yawn, the lvl 20 chords of melodic binding song may do the same? <br/>
&gt; Again, haven&#39;t tested it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Constant Chains breaks the Shaman Drowsy line.  Chains breaks any<br/>
   vector movement effect AND any attack speed reduction effect, AFAIK.<br/>
<br/>
   My tests were done on ice giants in everfrost, with a level 50 shaman<br/>
   and myself.<br/>
<br/>
   We may want to note this on the webpage, the dualality of chains<br/>
   allows it to break the two stated (movement/atkspeed) effects.<br/>
<br/>
   Harmonic.</div>
