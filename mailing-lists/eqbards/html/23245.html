<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683293459">124 is fine.  you will slowly build that up with items that have +CHA and<br/>
are also worth using anyway (crown of king tranix, symphonic saber, SSS).<br/>
<br/>
and what does level 52 have to do with money? =P  i am level 58, and 1 week<br/>
ago i had exactly 170pp to my name, on ALL characters.  funny story, i went<br/>
with myself and a 60 warrior (as a guide) to go complete my cobalt scar key.<br/>
you need the note and 200pp.  i had 170pp, he had 11pp on him.  we killed 10<br/>
green giants in Kael on the way there to get the other 19pp LOL.  that is<br/>
how broke i was.  i&#39;m back up now, i seem to go in spurts... 20k, 0k, 20k,<br/>
0k, 30k, 0k, 15k... etc.<br/>

&gt; about 4k in the<br/>
&gt; bank...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What about Charisma?  Maybe I&#39;m not itemed properly - but <br/>
&gt; without that one<br/>
&gt; ring I&#39;m at like 124 now.  Thought the CHA rings were important?<br/>
