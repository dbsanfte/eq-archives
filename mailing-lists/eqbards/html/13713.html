<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775856092">20th was my first no-death level.  21st has been rough I don&#39;t think my<br/>
&#39;net&#39; bar has moved in a month.  Sigh, oh well at least there is a lite in<br/>
the tunnel ahead, train or not.<br/>

I have noticed the same as well.  In my mid 20s, I died quite a bit due to<br/>
&quot;bard hate&quot;.  Since I made 30th level, it hasn&#39;t been nearly the problem<br/>
like it was before.  I&#39;m finding that the damage the tanks and casters are<br/>
inflicting outweighs the taunt effect of my songs.  As a result, I&#39;m now<br/>
ending combats nearly at full health.  I&#39;ve even resorted to keeping the<br/>
heal song up several pulses to try and spread out the damage.  I died three<br/>
times in 30th level but that was mainly my fault.  Didn&#39;t die once during<br/>
31st level (first time in a long time I&#39;ve gone an entire level without<br/>
dying at least once) and so far I&#39;m halfway thru 32d and still haven&#39;t died.<br/>
To say the least, EQ has been a lot more fun lately:-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s pretty bad at your level (teens to low 20s).  It gets<br/>
&gt; better in the mid 20s to 30s.  It was almost completely gone<br/>
&gt; (for me) in my 30s, then started coming back in the 40s.  I<br/>
&gt; suspect that&#39;s because by level 40 all the tanks have capped<br/>
&gt; their taunt and combat skills, whereas our songs keep getting<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
