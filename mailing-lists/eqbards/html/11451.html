<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592510637"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Wow!  I guess I didn&#39;t know how lucky I was when I got mine then!  I was<br/>
&gt; camping the secret room off of the Mistmoore Graveyard for my Black Silk<br/>
&gt; Gloves and experience when the Caitliff just sauntered in and we killed him.<br/>
&gt; He had the helm and I won the roll and have been wearing it ever since: AC<br/>
&gt; 10, STR 6, CHA 3, Weight 5.0.  Good bardic stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I know a wizard, well, let&#39;s just say took advantage of the door<br/>
  room near the graveyard.  He told me that during his time there<br/>
  he would estimate the drop (when the Caitliff spawned) is like<br/>
  1 in 10.  This guy sold spaulders like there&#39;s no tomorrow, but<br/>
  was fairly stingy enough on the helms.  I have been there and<br/>
  seen the Caitliff slain without helm on a few occasions.  But,<br/>
  I seem to get the bad effects of the random number generator.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
