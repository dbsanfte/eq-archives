<br/>
&gt; I was thinking about this the other day...<br/>
&gt; and...rangers, warriors and paladins have a lot of<br/>
&gt; button pushing too... Kick/Bash/Slam/Taunt as<br/>
&gt; appropriate... Dont get me wrong. I hate all the<br/>
&gt; button pushing too, but I dont see how it is worse<br/>
&gt; than the other melee classes, and the upside is we<br/>
&gt; dont have to stare at a spell book.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got a few characters & while they&#39;re all low levels it&#39;s pretty clear<br/>
what sort of keyboard & mouse skills I&#39;m going to need to play each.  The<br/>
biggest difference between the twitching of the bard and that of the other<br/>
classes is the focus needed on timing.  For example, a warrior hits taunt or<br/>
kick or something, waits for the button to pop back up, and hits it again.<br/>
A bard hits a song, counts to three, hits it again to stop the song,<br/>
hopefully just as the effect is happening, waits for the songs to un-grey<br/>
themselves, and starts the next.  Add in missed notes, resists & the like<br/>
and we have more we need to pay attention to.  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I find song juggling far easier than mouse-targeting.  I admire<br/>
enchanters who use single-mob mezzing effectively.  THAT is a b*&^%.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
