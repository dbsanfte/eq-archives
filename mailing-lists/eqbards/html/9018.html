&gt; &gt; Hmm. I&#39;ve tried lullaby on other players at least twice since March and<br/>
&gt; &gt; it never worked at all. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tried it in the Arena about a month ago.  At least one of<br/>
&gt; the players reported it was stunning him, though he was only<br/>
&gt; level 24 (to my 35 at the time).  This was back when I was<br/>
&gt; first beginning to suspect Strike was broken, so we didn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; any of the tests I suggested.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you make any more tests have them actually try to attack you. While<br/>
my test subject reported he got a message (can&#39;t remember what now) he<br/>
was still attacking me just fine.<br/>
