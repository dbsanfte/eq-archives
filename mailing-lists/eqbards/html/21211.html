<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550573997"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As to your question, looks like you will trade the +23<br/>
&gt; agility and 20% speed for 6 AC, +15 strength, and 17%<br/>
&gt; haste.  I&#39;m going for berserkers the moment I get it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always found this kind of intriguing...even with the haste reduction,<br/>
6AC and 17STR is sufficiently more valuable than 23AGI (from VI&#39;s point of<br/>
view), to make Crescendo 6 levels higher than Celerity. Personally, I think<br/>
I&#39;d use Celerity to buff monks and Crescendo to buff warriors.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, for shoulders I&#39;m wearing crested spaulders.  11<br/>
&gt; AC +5 or 6 stamina.  Not a bad item I think and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; selling for fairly cheap these days.  As to back, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; clueless on what to go for.  I&#39;m wearing a cloak of<br/>
&gt; the icebear which has a nice cold protection to it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m using this combination, too, but I&#39;m leaning towards getting a lizzy<br/>
cloak (AC8, 5DEX) for day-to-day use, saving the icebear cloak (AC8, 20Cold,<br/>
10HP) for cold-resist situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As to belt, I&#39;m camping the thick banded belt.  That<br/>
&gt; +15 strength just makes me DROOL.  Course, I&#39;m also<br/>
&gt; trying to get into the frenzied groups so I&#39;m either<br/>
&gt; going for a FBSS (+20% haste can&#39;t hurt) or the TBB<br/>
&gt; (+15 strength /cheer).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve taken the &quot;AC is all-powerful&quot; attitude and chosen a straw-spun belt<br/>
(AC10), but I&#39;d have a hard time passing up either a TBB or an FBSS.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that bards, more than any other class, need to be flexible in<br/>
their role in a group, and this extends to equipment. There seems to be so<br/>
little hard, specific data available about the pros and cons of one<br/>
attribute versus another, though, that it can be a very tough decision.<br/>
Basically, I choose Haste and STR as a &quot;battle bard&quot; and DEX and CHA when I<br/>
rely on songs. AC and AGI are always nice to have, so I&#39;ll sacrifice either<br/>
Haste/STR or DEX/CHA for AC/AGI depending on my role. Now that I have<br/>
Tuyen&#39;s, I&#39;m moving toward the &quot;singing bard&quot; role a bit more, because I<br/>
know that with Tuyen&#39;s, Fulfil&#39;s, and my MM drum (next quest: Tambourine!),<br/>
I&#39;m more dangerous than I am with weapons as long as I&#39;m not getting<br/>
resisted.<br/>
