<div id="ygrps-yiv-294342905">UWOO and Anarchy Online are in the same category.  The developers from both<br/>
of those games have promised a new PvP system which will largely eliminate<br/>
grief PKers but still promote PvP (i.e. guildwars).  UWOO has guaranteed<br/>
their new system will work.  Remains to be seen though.  Also, I&#39;ve never<br/>
played UO, but from what I&#39;ve read on the UWOO mailing list, grief PKing in<br/>
UO now has been largely solved.  No idea how it was solved though.  <br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t Horizons another one of those games where the developers think<br/>
that in spite of UO having nothing but problems with PKs and grief<br/>
players, and EQ showing the overwhelming majority prefer a PvP<br/>
switch, that they can come up with the perfect, abuse free forced PvP<br/>
environment?<br/>
