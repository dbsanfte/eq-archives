<br/>
A question lately was about leveling low teens in OOT, I think some of my <br/>
guildmates were killing sirens in OOT for good exp and possibly cash. <br/>
Lavastorm is good if you are brave and Paw if you care to really travel.<br/>
<br/>
On lambent stone prices, I have yet to buy one. Here is another area where <br/>
guilding really shines like Sylly pointed out. I get tells from guildmates <br/>
very often saying &#39;I got you a lambent, let me know when you need one.&#39; Even <br/>
the kiting druids were shouting to the zone for bards to loot them and this <br/>
on Xegony even! I have offered to pay for looting bracelets in Unrest and <br/>
Shin greaves in Lower Guk, each time it has been refused. I agree with <br/>
capping the price for lambents and currently when I am in a dungeon or zone <br/>
with bard armor items, I make sure I or someone with me loots it before <br/>
letting it go to waste. Another bard in the zone hunting the item would get <br/>
first cut though. My plan is if we gather enough pieces, we will be able to <br/>
do the quests for bards who aren&#39;t having any luck getting them themselves. <br/>
And now that Gediprie has joined my guild, I have to look afte him too &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
Currently I have greaves, arms, and both bracers and only need the <br/>
firewalker boots to finish boots. The gems for these pieces plus guantlets <br/>
has cost me 1000pp. Then it was time to kill more HG&#39;s for money as well as <br/>
lambents, I was down to only a few gold in the bank! This leaves no roo to <br/>
pay for the lambent. Being guilded really helps though, just put out the <br/>
call for an HG expedition and I had a mid 30s to 40s crew in route <br/>
immediately for a profitable night. Also the guild is always finding things <br/>
for the various quests and makes a great info network. My wizard is holding <br/>
the basalt carapace and will go to MM when the time comes for the lute.<br/>
<br/>
Great job on rescuing and updating the Song Analysis, Rokeen and John Kim! I <br/>
get alot of questions from people making new bards about where this info can <br/>
be found. Talies&#39; site and the Harpers were where I always sent them. I <br/>
refer often to the printed copies I have! Xegony being an old server, some <br/>
higher levels have become bored with their original characters and several <br/>
are trying barding. I am never Anonymous and get questions all the time. <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
