<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-32210686">Trakanon has been speculated on as the BP dropping mob for Kunark armor <br/>
since the first time Venril was killed and dropped a few sets of legs (as <br/>
many know). Well, I certainly doubt this bard armor drop has ANYTHING to do <br/>
with the recent patch. Someone was bound to bring up this coincidence sooner <br/>
or later tho. The bottom line is we still don&#39;t have our damn bracers and <br/>
arms. Just tonight FoH took Trak out a second time. He dropped a shaman and <br/>
SK breastplate, as well as the teeth yada yada yada. They&#39;ll be hitting <br/>
Veeshan&#39;s Peak before long, and from the kinds of drops we&#39;re seeing outside <br/>
of that place, I will die laughing if VP loots turn out to be as much of a <br/>
joke as PoS. Watch EQ get patched and FoH enters VP only to find our Singing <br/>
Steele Vambracers. Must&#39;ve been that last patch, right?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Heh and to clarify further:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was dropped by a Dragon which had never been killed before on _any_<br/>
&gt;server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;**looks around for the guys in black suits with mirrored shades**<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SHH!!!  They&#39;re all after me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; em listens for the sound of Black Helicopters(tm)....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, not exactly &quot;found&quot; on a server.  Afaik, it was dropped in the <br/>
&gt;first<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill of Trakanon - the poison dragon when Fires of Heaven took him down<br/>
&gt; &gt; early this weekend.  Not like &quot;finding&quot; a foraged item or a bag on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; ground in the woods.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A patch goes on the server.  THEN a Singing Breatplate is found on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
