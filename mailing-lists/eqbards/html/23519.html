<div id="ygrps-yiv-524501430">While Verant has claimed they fixed the problem - I know of at least one<br/>
person who&#39;s had problems that were fixed by setting the option (since the<br/>
first of the year). Considering it&#39;s an easy tweak - it&#39;s definitely worth<br/>
trying.<br/>

I&#39;ve myself have tried both 75% and 100% and haven&#39;t noticed a difference. I<br/>
think Verant fixed the acceleration problem with it. I had to load the<br/>
latest drivers for it though to fix other weird sound problems that I had<br/>
been having.<br/>
<br/>
As for everyone&#39;s comments about the possible problems that the computer has<br/>
been having, I&#39;d have to agree. Over time some of the hardware may have been<br/>
fried despite the robust cooling system.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to reinstall the OS though, just to make sure. It&#39;d probably<br/>
be wise to make a Ghost image (if you have access to Norton Ghost) of your<br/>
primary partition, then wipe your primary partition and reinstall your OS.<br/>
That way, if it turns out it wasn&#39;t your OS, you can just restore the ghost<br/>
image and not have to reinstall all of your apps.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Win 2k, I&#39;ve run EQ on both and it seems fine on Win 2k. But for<br/>
now, I&#39;d recommend sticking to 98se unless you like riding the bleeding edge<br/>
of gaming. :-)<br/>
