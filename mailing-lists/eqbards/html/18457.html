<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-539742931">Lambent Vambraces have no +str.  Mithril are +7.  Only 1 AC less as well,<br/>
probably better as +5 magic is usually better than +2 all.<br/>
<br/>
BP is 3 less AC but definitely has stat bonuses.  +30hp and +15 AGI.<br/>
Probably a push in this area with the +5 STA and +25 HP from Lambent.<br/>
<br/>
Mithril Greaves are also +7STR and +5 MR just like the Vambraces.  They are<br/>
3AC less than Lambent though.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what other Mithril is out there but I think at least 2 of these are<br/>
pretty close to their Lambent counterparts unless you really need the +1<br/>
CHA.<br/>

&gt;BP had less AC, no stat bonuses and weighed more.<br/>
&gt;Vambraces?  had less AC and less +STR.<br/>
