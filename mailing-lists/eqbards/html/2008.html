&gt;Quick note in case some of you don&#39;t know:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    The Dragoon Dirk can be equipped in your ranged weapon slot. This is<br/>
&gt;good if you don&#39;t use Piercing but still want to reap the magical benefits<br/>
&gt;of the Dirk. We can&#39;t use ranged weapons, so we might as well make some use<br/>
&gt;of that slot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Actually we can use thrown weapons.  And to a degree, once you have a<br/>
sufficient enough throwing skill, this could be the factor that tips the<br/>
scales in favor of coming out of melee, wielding an instrument & playing<br/>
your songs instead of staying in the fight & singing.  You can still throw<br/>
weapons while playing an instrument.<br/>
<br/>
   Unfortunately raising thrown weapons is terribly slow, and now at 23rd<br/>
level I think it&#39;s probably too late for me to start trying to raise this<br/>
skill to an acceptable level.  (well there&#39;s still always the cash route)<br/>
