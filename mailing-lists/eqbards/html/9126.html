<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004255520">i&#39;ve done a number of bone headed things. as my enchanter, going through the <br/>
stein of moggok quest, i attacked two or three npc&#39;s i *really* think i <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
mistake #1<br/>
that guy in Freeport who starts the quest (been a while, forget his name). <br/>
sure enough hit the good old &#39;a&#39; while talking to him but missed the stupid <br/>
enter key, the third largest one on the keyboard. yup he mauled me pretty <br/>
good. being bound at the west gate wasn&#39;t so much of a hassle, nor was it <br/>
going to be a diffucult task retrieving my corpse being a high elf with good <br/>
faction and a handy dandy benevolence spell. =)<br/>
<br/>
mistake #2<br/>
same character. same quest. i never saw the reason for getting all the <br/>
illusion spells until this point. i decided i  couldn&#39;t get into oggok (ogre <br/>
town i believe) without making myself into an evil race. i happened to have <br/>
the DE illusion. so *poof* and i &quot;felt different.&quot; my ogre guildmate was <br/>
guiding me to and through the town so i was in good hands. for those who <br/>
don&#39;t know, the last part of the quest requires you to give a recipe book or <br/>
something to the barkeep in oggok. thankfully, to this point i had not <br/>
killed any ogres. my default con was dubious for all npc&#39;s in town. i got to <br/>
the bar, cast benevolence, and gave the barkeep the book. upon that, i was <br/>
ordered to leave town while i still could!!! and mumbled something about <br/>
being enemies of the ogres! ACK!! he didn&#39;t kill me or anything, but i was <br/>
very scared that someone was about to. =)<br/>
   guildmate asked what happened, and said will hmm let&#39;s go to the dark elf <br/>
ambassador in town to see what he has to say. i didn&#39;t know why but is <br/>
sounded good you know... after all i was disguised as one still. one bad <br/>
thing happened though. some stupid female ogre shaman was casting spells <br/>
near where i needed to go. friend said con her... i did and i was hit twice <br/>
and fell right to the dirt floor. i had no idea what her problem was... i <br/>
was in relatively good standind with everyone else there. she was just sick <br/>
of seeing dark elves i suppose!!<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s something i hated at the time, but i think it pretty funny now that i <br/>
look back on it. so if any of you attempt to do this quest see that you <br/>
indeed have the proper illusion spell and good standing with ogres. that <br/>
includes that meanie caster woman!! LOL<br/>
