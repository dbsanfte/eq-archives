<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200379538">I havent tried this as a bard, but seeing as how<br/>
I did it primarily with a druid when she only had<br/>
melee ( FS scim ) and her ignite spell...you should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Go to steamfont...<br/>
<br/>
Near the mino caves are some HUGE gears in the ground.<br/>
Fight the skeletons that spawn there.<br/>
<br/>
They should be blue and they got me to level 14 VERY quickly.<br/>
<br/>
While there may be mobs that give more exp...I rarely see anyone camping<br/>
here.<br/>
Steamfont is usually only camped by people killing minos/mel or guards.<br/>

You will amass bone chips doing this...you can either sell them off<br/>
( I usually get 3 to 5 pp a stack ) OR my friend suggected taking them to<br/>
the<br/>
cleric guild in felwithe, Bronze leaf will take them 4 at a time ( you can<br/>
stack the 4)<br/>
and he will give you exp, faction, and a spell you can sell for about the<br/>
price of one<br/>
bone chip.  However the exp here is very minute, so it may not be worth it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Over the last few weeks, Adagia&#39;s goal was to acquire a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
&gt; and to reach level 12 so she could finally sing Brusco&#39;s Boastful<br/>
&gt; Bellow.  Last weekend her call to purchase a Dirk in Crushbone was<br/>
&gt; finally answered, and last night she earned the right to scribe the<br/>
&gt; 12th song.  She&#39;s currently calling E. Freeport home, and she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; finding the adventures there entertaining, but she has suddenly found<br/>
&gt; herself without any burning immediate goals.  What excitement waits<br/>
&gt; for a Bard of 12 songs?<br/>
