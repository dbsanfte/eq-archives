&gt; Have you tried getting out of Oasis? I think that is one of the more<br/>
&gt; boring places to hunt, at least if you&#39;re killing crocs. What level are<br/>
&gt; you now? Have you tried any other places where pickup groups are<br/>
&gt; relatively easy to find?<br/>
<br/>
I am actively looking to get out of Oasis. I&#39;ve pinged a couple other bards<br/>
at twentieth or near twentieth level to see what they were up to. Most were<br/>
either in KFC, or considering Unrest, a few were also in Lake Rathe hitting<br/>
the Aviak tower. When I was in Upper Guk last night I would have loved to<br/>
stay there but the only group of people I could find were part of a guild<br/>
out. They were nice, but they were not letting me in.<br/>
<br/>
So I am open to any suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
