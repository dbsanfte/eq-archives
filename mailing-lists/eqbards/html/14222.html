<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372015907">a 50 druid friend and i held the tower all day once after getting me my<br/>
first waki way back.  he fell asleep, which i realized after 50 &quot;Shada tells<br/>
the group, HEY!!!!!&quot;s as the room started respawning.  stupid me i didn&#39;t<br/>
want him to die, so i start fighting stuff.  i was so scared at the time, i<br/>
got my ass kicked by the first one, lost 3 bubbs of health when the second<br/>
one spawns, and the first one was still alive.  so i got two on me and down<br/>
to 1 bubb of health when i kill the first and a 3rd spawns.  then i remember<br/>
seeing a druid friend in the zone.  i start screaming in tell &quot;COME TO TOWER<br/>
NOW GONNA DIE!&quot; as i am fighting the other two.  the whole time i am fearing<br/>
the crap out of everything.  i kill the second one and am down to 1/2 bubb<br/>
of health.  down to 1 left and i hear him in the hall below me, saying he is<br/>
here and i am screaming &quot;UP UP UP&quot; and finally he clicks on the little lift<br/>
mechanism, nukes the last one and heals me at 1/4 bubb life.  you&#39;re right<br/>
Harm, that kind of stuff is very fun ;)  luckily i was group leader and<br/>
invited him to drop my fool friend off in lavastorm.<br/>
