<div id="ygrps-yiv-628224702">300 to 400pp?  I wish I knew that Saturday - someone was auctioning a Claw<br/>
and when I asked him, he said 200pp!  I almost bought it, but I have been<br/>
saving up for some bronze armor and bought that instead.  Almost have the<br/>
full suit :)<br/>

&gt; The Avatar is level 38 or 39.  I think a group of 6 level 30&#39;s would have<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; very tough time taking him out.  He has a ton of hit points, does a Harm<br/>
&gt; Touch at the beginning of the battle good for at least 2 bubbles of life,<br/>
&gt; and resists chain and root bigtime.  i couldn&#39;t chain him before level 40,<br/>
&gt; and we always had to fight him far from the door and have all our casters<br/>
&gt; keep nuking mana cause if he runs and makes it out, you will have a train<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; gators and lizzies like you wouldn&#39;t believe.  I would suggest 6 level<br/>
&gt; 35&#39;s<br/>
&gt; to take him.  it&#39;s been a while since i fought him, so correct me if i am<br/>
&gt; inaccurate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh and the demon claw is very nice.  i think closer to 300 to 400pp for it<br/>
&gt; though, especially if 500pp is everything you have.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never seen a demon claw at 500pp; if your getting it fo <br/>
&gt; &gt; that much I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would say buy it. They are low weight, and very fast. Defintely worth<br/>
&gt; &gt; the money unless your heading into lower guk anytime soon and getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of the great stuff there. At 30 I wouldn&#39;t expect you to pay for<br/>
&gt; &gt; one anyway. Pick up digs and head into Cazic-thule and start <br/>
&gt; &gt; hunting up<br/>
&gt; &gt; that rubicite. The same guy with the breastplate has the <br/>
&gt; &gt; claw. I&#39;m kinda<br/>
&gt; &gt; surprised you haven&#39;t hunted it down yet, as on Solusek Ro I <br/>
&gt; &gt; rarely see<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone above 30 or so not in cazic-thule once they&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; &gt; there a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; days, and I kinda feel bad that I haven&#39;t gotten it once, <br/>
&gt; &gt; though I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunted in groups that kiled both golems, and many tae ews, considering<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve hunted there for quite some time now.<br/>
