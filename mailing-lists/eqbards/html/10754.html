<div id="ygrps-yiv-136493921">Heh.  Yes, it is dangerous, and they resist a lot.  Hence my ~10 deaths.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have it down now, and the only thing that causes deaths are lag spikes.  But even those you can<br/>
avoid problems with (was doing it last night with occasional spikes into 50% ploss...damn Road Runner).<br/>
The trick is just to always be moving, assuming that the giants are running at you, even if the client<br/>
shows them standing there facing each other.  The clue is when they stop swinging at each other.  That&#39;s a<br/>
good indicator to start running.  I&#39;d say that with 119 CHA, the level 35 ones resist about 50% of the<br/>
time, and the level 36 ones about 75% of the time.  But hey, it&#39;s the best soloing I can do at this<br/>
level.  Cyclopses are much easier, and net about eh same exp (I guess that&#39;s that penalty for killing deep<br/>
reds kicking in).  Oddly, the cyclopses, which are all level 29 to 31, resist about as much as the level<br/>
35 giants.  Odd.<br/>
<br/>
One amusing death I had was against a giant that I tried to charm, only to realize it wasn&#39;t a normal<br/>
giant, but Broog Bloodbeard, which I found out later is around level 46, and has some 15000hp.  :)  I was<br/>
so shocked I ran into a tree, and that&#39;s all she wrote.  He hits for around 130, and stuns a level 30<br/>
player real good.  I went from full health to death without even being able to move.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Err, with all due respect, I&#39;ve killed at least 3 dozen hill giants<br/>
&gt; &gt; with charm at level 30 so far.  It works just fine.  That&#39;s not to say<br/>
&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t died a lot (and I mean a LOT) getting good at it.  But I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; halfway through level 30 on giant exp alone, and have made around<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1500pp from doing it.  Just don&#39;t tell anyone!  Lest nerftdom come!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   No doubt it can be done, but even when I did it at level 35, I got<br/>
&gt;   enough resists to make it a big hassle.  Plus lag deaths are the<br/>
&gt;   worst...  I think the part that caught my eye, was the person said<br/>
&gt;   he was pulling it off flawlessly with very little resists / effort.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You are definitely smarter than I was at level 30, =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Now if I could only go back in time &lt;g&gt;<br/>
