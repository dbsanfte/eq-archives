<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bellow song Damage <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-234758904"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I being a level 27 Bard probably use Bellow more than any <br/>
&gt; other song as<br/>
&gt; that little extra dmg is great. However I do feel that this <br/>
&gt; song should do<br/>
&gt; more dmg than just the 1/2 level +1. It&#39;s quite pathetic to <br/>
&gt; think that at<br/>
&gt; level 50 you will only do 26 DMG with it. Currently I am <br/>
&gt; doing 14 dmg and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s good but not good enough to solo stuff without having lots of<br/>
&gt; downtime.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You should consider Bellow nothing more than a warriors kick.  The higher<br/>
you get in level the less you&#39;ll start using it in actual combat (IMO).<br/>
Heck, even at level 27, Psalm of Warmth is probably going to perform better<br/>
for you... if a MOB hits you 3 or more times in a given &quot;round&quot; it&#39;s going<br/>
to end up doing more damage than your bellow (against critters like skeletal<br/>
monks, the damage starts piling up fast).  I&#39;ll use Bellow in dungeon<br/>
settings, when it&#39;s not really safe to use CoD or DDD.  I also use it for<br/>
pulling, and helping out nearby people who are in a tough fight.<br/>
