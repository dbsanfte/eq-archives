 </span></blockquote>Well, what&#39;s interesting is that it&#39;s not as great as you think - I was<br/>
originally playing on a T-1 connection, then I switched to the home<br/>
computer (a 14.4) and suffered VERY little lag difference - usually only<br/>
during big magic-fights (another reason I like soloing).  I&#39;ve upgraded to<br/>
56k, and the only difference is I go linkdead less often.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; The increased speed<br/>
&gt;&gt; DOES mean a lot, btw - much more than the increased str.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has anybody figured out exactly what it is increased str does?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Increased str = increased attack score, thus, you hit more often, and have<br/>
more potential to do more damage.  I&#39;m right on a threshold for both STR<br/>
and DEX, so I notice immediately when STR and DEX bonuses make a<br/>
difference.  (For example, I recently bought two dervish rings, and instead<br/>
of boosting my ac by 2, they boosted it by 5, because the dex bonus pushed<br/>
me over that threshold.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And as I said yesterday, the speed boost for both the anthem<br/>
&gt;and the whistling warsong do not stack, so there&#39;s less of a<br/>
&gt;reason to use both together.  (Would be interested if others<br/>
&gt;find differently)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t aware that the warsong gave a speed bonus - in fact, in my<br/>
comparisons (I use scarabs as my &quot;baseline&quot;) with no bonus, I hit less<br/>
often than the creature I&#39;m fighting, with the Warsong, it&#39;s the same, but<br/>
the Anthem puts me at equal-to or faster.  Pretty sweet if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
In regards to stacking, I had someone point out that this might be<br/>
considered &quot;abuse&quot; - what are your thoughts?<br/>
