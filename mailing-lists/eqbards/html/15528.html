&gt; &gt; Get more RAM. :)  I don&#39;t get ANY disk thrashing when zoning.  It accesses<br/>

&gt;It doesn&#39;t thrash while zoning.  Immediately after you zone<br/>
&gt;and start turning, the game loads (I&#39;m guessing) zone info to<br/>
&gt;draw buildings and terrain in your field of view.  It hits the<br/>
&gt;disk then.  I suspect having a slower hard disk (mine is 7200<br/>
&gt;rpm with a 6ms seek time) may actually be an advantage when<br/>
&gt;this happens, as the CPU isn&#39;t as tied up handling the data<br/>
&gt;from the disk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It also happens when I go to the FP bank.  From the area where<br/>
&gt;the jeweler and cleric&#39;s guild are, you have to go through a<br/>
&gt;series of sharp turns to get to the bank area.  I usually end<br/>
&gt;up doing a 180 on that first turn, as the game loads in the<br/>
&gt;info for the buildings in the new area.<br/>

rather than textures.  It&#39;s a phenomenon reported a lot in Quake-style <br/>
games, especially those with high r-speeds.   I guess Verant never did the <br/>
timedemo test ;)<br/>
