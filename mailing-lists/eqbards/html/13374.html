<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651778510">I&#39;ve never played a character with meditate skill so I have no idea how it<br/>
actually works.  Now that we have it, are we supposed to click on the<br/>
Meditate button on the spellbook right after we start memorizing a new song<br/>
or does it kick in automatically?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to be able to play again until the weekend so would appreciate<br/>
someone providing some feedback on how this new skill helps us out in<br/>
combat.  What I&#39;m hoping is that we can now memorize songs fast enough to<br/>
where, if in the middle of a tough combat and you realize you don&#39;t have the<br/>
song memmed that is best suited for that particular combat, we can back out,<br/>
sit down (assuming we aren&#39;t getting attacked) , and memorize a new song<br/>
that is beneficial for that combat.<br/>
