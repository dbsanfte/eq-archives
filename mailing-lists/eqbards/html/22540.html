<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366821369">Personally I think Sean Bean would have made a better Aragorn then Boromir.<br/>
I do not feel he has the physique to pull it off.  He is one of my favorite<br/>
actors though and I am glad he is in it.  I am looking forward to these<br/>
three movies and I really, really hope they do not suck :)<br/>

&gt; Yikes!  I thought the animated version was ok, but certainly <br/>
&gt; not of that<br/>
&gt; caliber.  Gandalf is being played by Sir Ian McKellen <br/>
&gt; (Magneto from X-Men),<br/>
&gt; Liv Tyler plays Arwen, Sean Bean (Sharpe of the Sharpe&#39;s series) plays<br/>
&gt; Boromir, Elijah Wood plays Frodo, Samwise is played by the Sean Astin<br/>
&gt; (Rudy), Saruman is played by Christopher Lee, Bilbo by Ian <br/>
&gt; Holm, Gimli by<br/>
&gt; John Rys-Davies, Galadriel by Cate Blanchett, Wormtongue by <br/>
&gt; Brad Dourif.<br/>
&gt; The cast alone makes this an immense undertaking.  Throw in <br/>
&gt; the fact that it<br/>
&gt; will be three movies, one for each book in the trilogy and I <br/>
&gt; think it will<br/>
&gt; be very exciting.  more info available at <br/>

&gt; It doesn&#39;t matter, it would be like so one remaking the white <br/>
&gt; album, (or<br/>
&gt; redoing Psycho, say...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found the animated movie to be nearly perfect (I really love it that<br/>
&gt; much).  Computer generated monsters will never be as scary as the Ring<br/>
&gt; Wraiths were.  What are the chances whoever is playing <br/>
&gt; Gandalf (anyone have<br/>
&gt; a cast list yet) is as much of a bastard as he was in the <br/>
&gt; animated version?<br/>
&gt; And somehow I can&#39;t see being Mini Me (I forgot his real <br/>
&gt; name) being as<br/>
&gt; appealing as Pippen was...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ll see and again I hope I&#39;m wrong :-)<br/>
