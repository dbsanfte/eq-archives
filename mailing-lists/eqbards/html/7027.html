<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136729551">One thing to keep in mind with asking for changes; anything that<br/>
requires major programming changes just isn&#39;t going to happen.  As someone<br/>
pointed out - it would be nice to have more than 8 song slots; but even if<br/>
Verant decided it wouldn&#39;t un-balance the game (or whatever reasons they<br/>
might be opposed to it from a design perspective) - they would have to<br/>
totally revamp the interface and make other programming changes to<br/>
accomplish it.<br/>
<br/>
    Similar - when requesting other changes - we have to try to imagine the<br/>
amount of effort it would take on Verant&#39;s behalf to implement it.  Anything<br/>
that is going to take a lot of programming resources just won&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
    For that reason I fear that the &quot;Identify in Trade Window for No<br/>
Trade/No Drop&quot; won&#39;t happen.  To accomplish this - they have to move the<br/>
check from when you move it to the window to when you click ok.  This well<br/>
may be a HUGE programming change (maybe not - we can&#39;t tell since we don&#39;t<br/>
have access to the code).   So some of the things people want to see just<br/>
won&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
    I fear that this may be the case for binding by NPC&#39;s.  When JM posted<br/>
he pointed out that the binding issue was a huge philosophical/design<br/>
argument by the designers at Verant (we don&#39;t know how accurate his sources<br/>
are - but it rang true).  From what he said - we&#39;re never going to get the<br/>
ability to bind ourselves - and probably also won&#39;t be ever be able to be<br/>
bound anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
    The NPC binding though seems from the design perspective to be<br/>
consistent the limitation the designers seemed to want to employ.  My<br/>
concern is that it could be a major programming effort - since as far as<br/>
I&#39;ve seen there is nothing equivalent to it within the design.  The closest<br/>
would be to sell an item (scroll?) that cast the same spell.  This might<br/>
stray from their design philosophy...<br/>
<br/>
    So perhaps we should ask them to create a scroll or potion or some other<br/>
item with one charge that casts the same spell that people cast when they<br/>
bind us (i.e. it will fail if cast in a non-city zone)...<br/>
