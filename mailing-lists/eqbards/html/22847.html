<br/>
yeah, there&#39;s a mini-dungeon in thurgadim.  mobs are approximately 28-31(?),<br/>
as they con blue to yellow, and i&#39;ve spotted one red there as well.  it&#39;s a<br/>
maze, of sorts, the left hand side loops back on itself, but not very<br/>
complicated.  There are a few dead ends, and only a few mobs down that way.<br/>
The right side leads to a pool, beyond which lie some &#39;mine shafts&#39;, with<br/>
drops below, a few mobs spawn down that way, but i have yet to explore it<br/>
deeply, since it&#39;s a bit tough to fight those yellows in a cramped space<br/>
solo.  (loot stinks, too...bats and rats, drop newbie stuff, but the spiders<br/>
drop &#39;crystaline silk&#39; or some such...magic item, stackable...sells for a<br/>
gold or so, if i remember right.  Probably some new sewing item, if I had to<br/>
guess (haven&#39;t seen it listed anywhere, but i don&#39;t do tailoring alot)<br/>
<br/>
I think that those tunnels may/probably lead to the area that you fall into<br/>
if you drop off the bridge on the way into Thurgadim.  Not sure, though...At<br/>
31, i&#39;ll prolly go a bit deeper, since i&#39;ll have levitate, and won&#39;t drop<br/>
into some of the holes in the passageways.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Thurgadim hunting?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; anyone hunt in Thurgadim? I was lost in there other night and came upon a<br/>
&gt; curve where i saw a bat on the other side, it conned blue to me at 42 and<br/>
&gt; ready to attack where as all the dwarves were amiable to me.  So i guess<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a mini dungeon in there. Anyone try it out yet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And for that matter anyone try icewell keep yet? i zoned in by accident,<br/>
hit<br/>
&gt; tracking and everything on track was red to me except for 1 sentry which<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; blue.<br/>
