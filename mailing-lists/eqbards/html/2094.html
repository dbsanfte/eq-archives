I love this song, what it does is it raises your faction with people that<br/>
normally dont sell to you. I dont know why it doesnt work for you, but<br/>
everytime I use it merchants give me better prices. And those who would not<br/>
normally sell to me do. I am only Level 11 and I love this song.<br/>

&gt;How are you people using the charismatic carillion?  I have never had it do<br/>
&gt;anything for me.  After reading all these messages I thought maybe it had<br/>
&gt;been fixed, so I tried it on a merchant in Oasis of Mar who conned dubious<br/>
&gt;and refused to sell to me.  I equipped my mino horn, targeted the merchant,<br/>
&gt;played the carillion, and conned her again.  Still dubious.  Right clicked<br/>
&gt;her, she still refused to sell to me.<br/>
