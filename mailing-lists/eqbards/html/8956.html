<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044374617">my experience has been this.  if you are chaining AND fearing a mob it will<br/>
stop running at half health.  however, if a mob runs from you at half health<br/>
because it is a very low green, it will continue running (slowly of course)<br/>
even while chained, though the closer to death he becomes the slower he will<br/>
run.<br/>

&gt; Once nice change I noticed is that Chain now stops runners if<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re below half health, which coincidently is when most<br/>
&gt; greens start to run.  If you&#39;ve got an annoying green runner,<br/>
&gt; snare (and the old Chain) will not stop it until it&#39;s at about<br/>
&gt; 25% health.  The only option used to be rooting it.  Now you<br/>
&gt; can Chain it.  It also makes Chain/Screech a much easier combo<br/>
&gt; to use since your opponent will be immobile half the fight.<br/>
