<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024527702">i&#39;m lucky to get 2 on dragons and planes, but that just brings us back to<br/>
another point.  there really should be some type of skill for bards in<br/>
expansion to relieve some of our twisting woes don&#39;t you think?  doubtful i<br/>
know but after 110+ days played as a bard, i simply can not stand twisting<br/>
anymore =)<br/>

&gt; all they can<br/>
&gt; reliably medly.  I medly four all the time (3 for dragons/planes).<br/>
&gt; Basically if you&#39;ve got a good connection and a reasonably <br/>
&gt; speedy system 4<br/>
&gt; songs is no problem in most situations (also have to have <br/>
&gt; good reflexes ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sing on ;)  4 songs is a POWERFUL combo if you can get it going. </span></blockquote></div>
