<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948122899"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I just reached level 12, and now the things<br/>
&gt; I used to hunt in Steamfront all con green.<br/>
&gt; Where should I go from here? I could stay<br/>
&gt; here and kill mino&#39;s, but they&#39;re too hard<br/>
&gt; to find (camped most of the time). Where<br/>
&gt; should I go from here? What&#39;s good for level<br/>
&gt; 12? Any help is greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My suggestion, and what I did, is to get a magic weapon, Tentacle Whips seem to<br/>
be going for as low as 15pp nowadays, and head to the island in Eruds Crossing<br/>
and hunt zombie sailors and wisps. I did this from 11th thru 14th and made well<br/>
over 200pp. Enough to get a full suit of banded, trade in the tentacle whip for<br/>
a combine longsword, buy my songs and still have a little over 100pp in the<br/>
bank. And that was just selling the rawhide and lightstones to vendors.<br/>

Just my 2cp.<br/>
