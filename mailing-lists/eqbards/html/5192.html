<div id="ygrps-yiv-359416451">And you know what?  Not to sound rude, but I&#39;m getting tired of people saying<br/>
that there IS a bug without doing tests about it.  Everyone here who has sat<br/>
down and started a variety of songs and counted missed notes seems to have<br/>
normal failure rates, yet you&#39;re accusing everyone of &quot;black helicopter crap&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I tested last night with my level 30 song, which I had never even played before<br/>
(I just levelled), and I missed 6 notes in 60 tries.  That&#39;s a reasonable fizzle<br/>
rate, in my opinion.  With Bellow, I missed one note in 60.  With Hymn, I missed<br/>
3 in 60.  After that, I grew weary of counting. :)<br/>
<br/>
If your test was Denon&#39;s Discord, I think I know what the problem might be...<br/>
perhaps there IS a bug in that it&#39;s checking the instrument skill regardless of<br/>
whether you&#39;re singing or playing an instrument.   If you&#39;re like me, your brass<br/>
skill is one of the only ones not maxed out, and denon&#39;s discord uses brass.<br/>

&gt; Look, I for one am getting tired of the nay-sayers on this missed note<br/>
&gt; thing. Last night I couldnt even get Denons to start I missed notes 10 times<br/>
&gt; in a row and finally erased it from my list and added a different song. ALL<br/>
&gt; my skills are over 190, my Dex is a base of 124, char is 110, there is a<br/>
&gt; problem. I am a level 38 Bard and I KNOW when something has changed with the<br/>
&gt; way I play. So knock off the black helicopter crap, you dont have a clue<br/>
&gt; what your talking about. This is a very serious problem in how the Bard is<br/>
&gt; played, it means we cannot twist songs like we used to effectively. I cannot<br/>
&gt; depend on Chaining a fleeing mob like I used to be able to. In fact I find<br/>
&gt; myself anticipating that missed note, hovering over that hotkey waiting to<br/>
&gt; push it again when I miss. Its too bad if you dont play enough to notice a<br/>
&gt; huge change like this, or arent observant enough to notice it, but dont tell<br/>
&gt; us we are imagining things. </span></blockquote></div>
