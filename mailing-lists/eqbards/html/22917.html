<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640332790">whats worse is that they stated that they&#39;re not fixing it till next patch,<br/>
they&#39;re not putting in an emergency patch. So not only is selos busted, but<br/>
all the people trying to root/snare better have lotsa tanks around or<br/>
they&#39;re in trouble when root busts after a nuke.  Hmm selos is not the only<br/>
busted thing. Come on Verant, make an emergency patch, i cant run around<br/>
slow for a week 8(<br/>

Unfortunately we broke the bard drums with this patch. That&#39;s already fixed<br/>
and ready to go in with the next patch. <br/>
We understand the effects of not having drum bonuses for bard movement songs<br/>
(and that is the only thing that appears to have been affected). <br/>
<br/>
Again, we&#39;re sorry about the error. We will have it fixed with the next<br/>
patch. <br/>
<br/>
But, honestly, if this is the only thing that needs to be changed, we will<br/>
probably not be putting up an emergency patch to fix it.<br/>

	I hate being right about something like this :(.  I really would<br/>
like to know why such a blatant bug on test would be propped to the live<br/>
servers.<br/>
<br/>
	Also, why is it that i can no longer outrun sow speeds without the<br/>
drum? Prepatch I was still faster than SOW without an instrument, now i am a<br/>
bit slower.<br/>
