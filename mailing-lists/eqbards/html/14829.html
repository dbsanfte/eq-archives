<div id="ygrps-yiv-218957248"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; A warrior in my guild solo&#39;s HG&#39;s regularily.  I&#39;ve seen it.  She not even<br/>
&gt; an ogre either, but a wussy dark elf.  Monks can do it even more easily,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen this too.  I don&#39;t know off hand any paladins or rangers that have<br/>
&gt; tried, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they could too.  Well, maybe not<br/>
&gt; rangers =)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  When I mean solo, I mean no shields, no buffs other than the ones<br/>
  they possess.  Completely solo, no outside help.<br/>
<br/>
  When you factor that in those people have no chance against npcs<br/>
  of that nature.  If you reso,sow,symbol a tank you&#39;ve just given <br/>
  them 50% more hp than they would normal have.  I&#39;ve seen warriors<br/>
  and paladins with full cleric/shaman buffs beat a sand/hill giant.<br/>
<br/>
  But a pure solo attempt on a hill giant from a warrior means base<br/>
  hp, base stats, base ac.  For a paladin it means valor, weak symbol,<br/>
  guard and use of LoH.  For a ranger it means skin like steel, wolfform,<br/>
  agi, str, thorns.  A monk??? hahahahaha, sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s a little tidbit of info, L50 monk = 1200 hp.  nuff said.<br/>
