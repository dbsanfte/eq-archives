<div id="ygrps-yiv-604295060">it&#39;s been reset for us too (after that time i mentioned in fact).  i don&#39;t<br/>
know if it&#39;s a bug or by design, but i guess a new guardian spawns for every<br/>
seahorse you kill.  i would guess a bug, phin is not supposed to be quite so<br/>
hard.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Really?  They reset it for you?  One of my guild leaders, who <br/>
&gt; has spent a <br/>
&gt; great deal of time studying Kedge, figured out that there are <br/>
&gt; specific MOBs <br/>
&gt; who, if killed, cause an additional guardian to spawn.  <br/>
&gt; Seeing a dozen isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; at all unusual if you wait too long after a server reset.  If <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll reset <br/>
&gt; that, it&#39;s an interesting thing to know.  Right now, we just <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t bother with <br/>
&gt; Phinny if it&#39;s been more than a few days since the last reset.<br/>
