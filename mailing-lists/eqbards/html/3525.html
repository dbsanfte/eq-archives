<div id="ygrps-yiv-461524942">Lets put this Jaxan&#39;s thread to rest once and for all...J.M. has confirmed<br/>
that there is absolutely no affect or relation whatsoever between the Jig<br/>
and Manna restoration.  Don&#39;t mean to be curt as you probably were not<br/>
following the thread when this was revealed - but I don&#39;t want us to start<br/>
flogging a dead horse again.<br/>

&gt; Recently I had this same experience with a Ranger... who, <br/>
&gt; when grouped with<br/>
&gt; my party, insists on one of our bards singing Jaxa&#39;s Jig during her<br/>
&gt; meditation.  She claims it greatly speeds her mana regeneration.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally I think it&#39;s her imagination.<br/>
