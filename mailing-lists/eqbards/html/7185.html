<div id="ygrps-yiv-97639594">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I remember that someone wrote that begging from a ship is not possible<br/>
anymore. Well I tried and it worked. When I tried to beg from the ship, I<br/>
was on my way to Freeport I got the message &quot;You are to far away from<br/>
targeted npc&quot; or something like that, but when I came closer to that wooden<br/>
thing that goes out of the ship, I think it&#39;s mast ut I&#39;m not sure I was<br/>
able to beg from the ship.<br/>
 Ohh yes I have met a warrior and he said that if you get drunk every day<br/>
with fish or red wine then after a week or so the efects will be permanent.<br/>
The strenght boost will stay forever. You&#39;ll still be as inteligent as a<br/>
brick but it&#39;s good for tanks I suppose.<br/>
