<div id="ygrps-yiv-555249998">I think you missed something there, Mr. Kim.  If you would dig back to that<br/>
original post, you&#39;ll see that I said something that amounted to &#39;all else<br/>
being equal, or near equal, opt for the faster weapon&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a few hard numbers to chew on:<br/>
<br/>
The actual formula for double attack is (SKILL+LEVEL)/500, with the integer<br/>
converted to a percentage.  50th level with 200 skill equals 250/500, with<br/>
.50 being the result.  50 percent chance to double attack. Monks cap at 250<br/>
in DA, all other classes cap at 200.<br/>
<br/>
For dual wield, it&#39;s (SKILL+LEVEL)/600.  50th level with 200 skill equals 40<br/>
percent.  Monks cap in Dual Wield at 250, and rogues cap at 210.  All other<br/>
classes cap at 200.  Also, once dual wield exceeds 149 in skill, checks are<br/>
made to see if you double attack with the secondary as well, provided you<br/>
have double attack as a skill.  This check is based on your dual wield<br/>
skill, and its corresponding percentage chance.<br/>
<br/>
[For those of you wondering why monks get such a bonus in DA/DW, keep in<br/>
mind that monk hand speed never drops below 30.  They need the increased<br/>
attacks to remain competitive with other melee classes who can use faster<br/>
weapons, weapons with proc effects, etc.]<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to bore you all to tears with all the charting and the<br/>
formulae used, Monte Carlo simulations, how the fixed damage bonuses due to<br/>
strength, offense and weapons skills seriously skew the results in favor of<br/>
speed, and about half a dozen other variables.  Most of those numbers are<br/>
intentionally and forever hidden from the end users view.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice it to say with two weapons of a given efficiency, the faster will<br/>
always win out in terms of real damage in any time period beyond 30 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
And, the faster the weapon is (while maintaining the same eff. rating), the<br/>
wider the gap in damage results between it and the slower weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
<br/>
Using round numbers here, and mythical weapons, both with a .25 efficiency<br/>
rating, a 5 dam/20 delay and a 10dam/40 delay weapon.  All results assume a<br/>
50th level player, with 200 in all his combat skills, and 100 STR.<br/>
<br/>
The 5 dam/20 delay  weapon will outperform a 10dam/40 delay weapon by about<br/>
27 percent in a two minute time period, in the primary.  If you have double<br/>
attack, it goes up to 44 percent, thanks to double the amount of DA<br/>
activation checks.<br/>
<br/>
It will outperform by 39 percent if used in the secondary, mainly thanks to<br/>
twice as many DW activation checks.<br/>
<br/>
If your class is capable of &#39;quad&#39; attacks (see above),  it goes up to a<br/>
staggering 73 percent overall spread between the faster and the slower<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is an extreme example, most real world weapons aren&#39;t that<br/>
polarized.  But you can still expect a marked advantage over the faster<br/>
weapon.  Enough of an advantage to even sacrifice some small amount of<br/>
efficiency in favor of speed.  A well balanced scimitar, (5 dam/21 delay,<br/>
.238 eff rating), outdoes a barbed leather whip,( 7 dam/28 delay, .25 eff<br/>
rating), by 14 percent in a two minute period used as the primary, and 19<br/>
percent as the secondary.<br/>
<br/>
At 50th level, in pure melee combat, two minutes is pretty close to how long<br/>
a typical fight lasts.  Drop the time period down to one minute, the gap<br/>
narrows, but is still evident.  Drop it down to 30 seconds, it&#39;s a dead<br/>
heat, still.  Anything less than 30 seconds tends to favor the whip.<br/>
<br/>
You can run this trend down all the way to 17th level for a bard, and the<br/>
corresponding skill levels, the spread remains the same for primary weapons,<br/>
and reaches it&#39;s narrowest point with secondary, but it&#39;s still within 10<br/>
percent of the peak spread.<br/>
<br/>
This, by the way, totally disregards the target&#39;s defense, assuming a<br/>
randomized hit with every swing.  If you factor in the highly variable<br/>
factors of target defense and AC, first you go nuts, then you come up with<br/>
results even more in favor of the faster weapon, as you get more chances to<br/>
hit as well.<br/>
<br/>
There are some cases, though,  where the raw damage numbers DO matter.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting mobs with damage shields(druids, fire elementals, etc), it&#39;s best<br/>
to use a slower, heavier damage weapon, to minimize the damage YOU take.<br/>
<br/>
For a  Rogue, your backstab damage is predicated on the amount of normal<br/>
melee damage you can inflict with one hit, as backstab is simply a fixed<br/>
multiplier(based on skill and level) on a normally resolved pierce attack.<br/>
Higher the base number, the bigger the backstab.<br/>
<br/>
If you take a look at the good 2h weapons, you&#39;ll find they are generally<br/>
*much* more efficient than a 1h weapon, by as much as 100 percent.<br/>
<br/>
They HAVE to be, to make up for being so much slower than the 1h<br/>
counterparts, and to compete with dual wield.  2h weapons, especially 2h<br/>
slash, are purpose designed to be the most efficient weapons in the game.<br/>
They don&#39;t break the above results, at all, but the natural efficiency<br/>
brings the curve around again, offsetting reduced attack chances.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for using such a large chunk of bandwidth, this was never intended to<br/>
be such a lengthy thread on my part, simply an interjection, and a lot of it<br/>
was due to perhaps less than clear language from me.  This is my attempt to<br/>
correct that.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Oh I completely agree, most of what he says is spot on.  But<br/>
&gt;&gt; this was just plain wrong.  :-)  He was considering only one<br/>
&gt;&gt; attribute (weapon speed) when slecting the best weapon to have<br/>
&gt;&gt; in your second hand.  While I agree speed is of overriding<br/>
&gt;&gt; importance if you&#39;re trying to rapidly increase the dual wield<br/>
&gt;&gt; skill, once you have it maxed it&#39;s damage rate you want to<br/>
&gt;&gt; maximize.  Damage rate is determined by speed *and* damage, so<br/>
&gt;&gt; the rule of &quot;fastest weapon&quot; does not apply any more. </span></blockquote></div>
