&gt;  I replied that this will really hurt bards. We will lose the services<br/>
&gt;of our pets for a short amount of time, will have to charm more (more<br/>
&gt;mana) and will take more damage because of pets having to be targeted<br/>
&gt;each attack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I suggested that they consider lengthening the amount of time a<br/>
&gt;successful Charm lasts as a way of compensation.. even 5 seconds would<br/>
&gt;be helpful...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a coincidence. I suggested the same thing, lengthening the duration of <br/>
charm. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The change will require an adjustment of &quot;socials&quot; keys for me, especially <br/>
in a group.<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
/assist &lt;tank&gt;<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
/g My pet is attacking %t<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
<br/>
For solo kiting, you may need to issue a /pet follow command now as instead <br/>
of automatically following like regular pets, they do like to wander off.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m not happy with the change, I do not believe it totally ruins solo <br/>
charm kiting. However, it does make it more difficult and you will <br/>
definitely take more damage as you try to reacquire your pet&#39;s target <br/>
before it clobbers you.<br/>
