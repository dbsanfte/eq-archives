<div id="ygrps-yiv-784254194">sometimes i can keep 2 up, sometimes only 1, guess it depends on your<br/>
system.  and we only take 30 to do nagafen, if you have more along the lines<br/>
of 40-50 it is gonna be hard to twist 2 let alone 3.  elemental rhythms is<br/>
most important.  the second song is up to you, it does not have to be<br/>
guardian.  with elemental and other classes resist buffs for fire and magic,<br/>
you will be doing well enough against the breath and fear.  so you have the<br/>
choice of guardian, VoV, or Niv&#39;s for the 2nd song.  i kinda like<br/>
elemental/Niv&#39;s myself, just seems right to me.  little regen, little<br/>
strength, little magic damage absorption.  not much of course, but with all<br/>
the tanks having haste item+augment to cap haste anyway, you don&#39;t need the<br/>
haste of VoV.  bottom line though is elemental first, others much less<br/>
important.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; That being said, if I weezle into the prime nag group,<br/>
&gt; has it been your experience to try and keep just<br/>
&gt; guardian and elemental rhythms up or should I go for 3<br/>
&gt; (I&#39;m very good at twisting without queues so heavy lag<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t hamper keeping 3 up 90% of the time).  If 3,<br/>
&gt; then what to add?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
