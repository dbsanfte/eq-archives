<div id="ygrps-yiv-432553790">that&#39;s what it sounds like to me too.  go put 1 point in it just to be sure.<br/>
i know for a fact that within the last week my level 26 bard friend went to<br/>
the ecommons tunnel in the shady swashbuckler room, equipped a horn and<br/>
started DDD and maxed it overnight.  if the icon is grayed and you have the<br/>
horn equipped, you ARE playing the song and will get the increases.  you<br/>
will only see the animation and sparkles if someone is within range.  it<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be a PvP area, just somewhere remote.  in the far corner of<br/>
the shady swashbuckler room myself and my friend (and others on this list)<br/>
have maxed their brass skill.<br/>

&gt; Yow!  I hope this isn&#39;t accurate and that some other problem <br/>
&gt; was affecting<br/>
&gt; you.  If thay have truly changed DDD and brass skill raises <br/>
&gt; in this way I<br/>
&gt; may as well plan on never buying a horn.  You did remember to <br/>
&gt; train 1 point<br/>
&gt; in it at the trainer right?  I know you cnnot use any of the <br/>
&gt; music skills<br/>
&gt; unless you train that first point and get the &quot;You have <br/>
&gt; learned the basics<br/>
&gt; of XXX&quot; message.  If you&#39;re not sure, go try to train it and see.<br/>
