Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve played a bard to 30ish levels 3 times but I&#39;ve<br/>
never had difficulty solo&#39;ing ;)  Even in beta I didn&#39;t have that hard a<br/>
time levelling up (well at least till after 30th.  The 30&#39;s are sheer and<br/>
utter hell.  Especially now that the servers are so crowded ;)<br/>
<br/>
But yes, we&#39;re one of the most difficult classes to play _well_.  Anyone can<br/>
play AT a bard.  Only a very few have the talent, patience and knowledge to<br/>
BE a bard.  Those of us that can have a ton of fun.  Generally speaking<br/>
people who make a bard just to see what it&#39;s like will hate it.  It&#39;s a<br/>
class you either adore or you hate. To play, that is ;)<br/>
<br/>
Kudos Crier!  Job well done on 50 ;)<br/>
<br/>
Now if I can just get Lyrnia through her 30&#39;s on Veeshan I can join you in<br/>
the 50&#39;s {8^D<br/>
<br/>
Lyrnia Jongleur - 35 Bard - Veeshan<br/>
Lyrniali Windsinger - 50 Bard - Test Server  (trying to level up to 5X to<br/>
try the new songs)<br/>
Lyrnia Windsong - 30 Bard - Beta 2, 3, 3.5, 4<br/>

&gt; I want to make a comment on Talies&#39; remark.  It&#39;s true.  I&#39;m in a high<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; guild with a lot of people that have two and some even three level 50 (or<br/>
&gt; high 40s) characters.  I would say that around 8 people in my guild have<br/>
&gt; confessed that they started a bard character and gave it up in their teens<br/>
&gt; or early 20s.  &quot;I die too much.&quot;  &quot;Those songs are too big of a taunt.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t solo a bard.&quot;  &quot;I couldn&#39;t believe how few hitpoints I had.&quot;  &quot;Mana<br/>
&gt; song at 32?  Geez that&#39;s a long wait.&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s the only character I&#39;ve ever<br/>
&gt; started that had to run to guards from a snake at level 1. (this one was<br/>
&gt; really said to me)&quot;  Etc., etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Playing a bard of any level is hard work and should be commended.  It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; very fun and original class that is really unlike any of the others, but<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve said on this list countless times, we do die a lot and generally<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; very slowly...  Focus on the fun!<br/>
