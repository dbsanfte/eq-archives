<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655358976"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; Btw, does anyone know how to raise faction with the clerics in<br/>
&gt; Rivervale?  It&#39;s annoying having to use a faction raising<br/>
&gt; spell every time I want to recharge the ring.  They took out<br/>
&gt; the faction gains/losses for recharging/getting the ring when<br/>
&gt; they made it no-drop.  I suppose I could just destroy them and<br/>
&gt; get another from the marshall, but I don&#39;t want to lose the<br/>
&gt; ring if they ever raise the faction requirement to get it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how to raise it, but I think I know how to lower it -- the Pirates<br/>
of Guntak in the Ocean of Tears have the faction &quot;Fizzlethorpe&quot;.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
for certain if the halfling clerics are this faction, but I know that the only<br/>
halfling deity is Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, and that my halfling cleric is<br/>
amiable to kindly to the Pirates.  The pirate&#39;s natural enemy in the OOT are the<br/>
Sisters of Erollisi, but killing them does not raise your Fizzlethorpe faction.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t help more.<br/>
