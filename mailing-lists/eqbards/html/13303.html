 </span></blockquote>  This guy had silver and black going on.  Assorted steel with BE breast<br/>
  I would assume.  He had a sprinkler, but his skill is way too low for<br/>
  it to be effective so he switched to soulfire.  One valorium bracer and<br/>
  a hero bracer it appeared to me as well.  So I suppose that is<br/>
  underequip&#39;d, cause I woulda rocked him hard had I played songs and<br/>
  fought at the beginning of the duel.<br/>
