<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625457250">At level 34 I raced my brother&#39;s druid with Spirit of Cheetah across East<br/>
Commons.  While his spell lasted, he was slightly faster... Of course I have<br/>
selo with MM drums all the time and he gets 15 seconds of Cheetah.  Haven&#39;t<br/>
tried the same race at 35.  How often does the song get an upgrade?<br/>

&gt; Just something I wanted to share with you speed freaks out there...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I was crossing North Karana when I picked up GrimFeather on<br/>
&gt; tracking.  I was feeling a bit reckless, and figured I&#39;d see how fast GF<br/>
&gt; really is... so I ran under him (GrimFeather hits YOU for 72 points of<br/>
&gt; damage!) and sped off.  Well, turns out he is quite a bit slower than me<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; 36 with MM drums.  So now I am wondering if there is anything in the world<br/>
&gt; faster than me other than Shadowed Men and higher-level bards...<br/>
