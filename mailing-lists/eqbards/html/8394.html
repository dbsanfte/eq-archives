CHARISMA - THE NATURE OF CHARM<br/>
<br/>
I checked with GZ this morning regardng the effect Charisma has in<br/>
charming.  The answer is that its effect is twofold.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly it effects the chance at resisting the initial charm cast.<br/>
Secondly, and more importantly, it makes it harder for the charmed NPC&#39;s<br/>
save to successfully roll.  This basically means it does effect duration.<br/>
<br/>
Also charm does have a maximum duration.  The higher level charm spell you<br/>
use the longer the maximum duration can be.  So there is a good reason to<br/>
use that Allure spell even though its more mana.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ok so now the bard related part :).  Since it has been confirmed that<br/>
charisma directly effects charm resist and charm duration, does this also<br/>
apply to our charm song?  I would bet the silvery 2 handed axe (21 48<br/>
serpent sight) Im trying to sell on it ;) (1kpp in cash or items on Povar<br/>
btw).  I&#39;d also be willing to bet that our mesmerize songs (pixie strike<br/>
and lullaby) have the same properties as charm... Duration and resist rate<br/>
directly determined by charisma.  Im almost willing to bet that on all of<br/>
our monster affecting songs have thier resist rate based on charisma.  The<br/>
other thing I feel the songs are affected by is wether you are using the<br/>
proper instrument for the song.  IE. if you are using a lute, CoD would be<br/>
resisted less and do more damage.  Anyone want to ask GZ or do some testing?<br/>
