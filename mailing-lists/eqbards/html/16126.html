<div id="ygrps-yiv-173819668">My +2 STA earrings have yet to show any worth from lvl 4 (where I got<br/>
them) to 19 (where I am now, Hopeing for that last name tommorow!).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Note this is for my cleric, my bard got Oppaline earrings very early in<br/>
life... (first 75 plat I had went to pair of earrings + Jagged band)<br/>
