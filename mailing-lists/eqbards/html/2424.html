<div id="ygrps-yiv-577462181">I suppose that is a good enough topic for this question. Last night, I<br/>
saw a bard playing a song that I thought I had never seen before. I<br/>
found out that it was Selo&#39;s, but it looked different than when I play<br/>
Selo&#39;s. It had the white pulsing flashes, but it also had small purple<br/>
lights or something. When does Selo&#39;s start to look different? Anyone<br/>
know?<br/>

Oh, one last thing - about the Heartstone Saga. I am trying to get<br/>
involved in this. I e-mailed the guy who made the post to eqvault (from<br/>
the Hand of Chaos), and he has yet to respond to me. Does anyone have<br/>
any info on the Heaststone Saga on Cazic-Thule. Information I am<br/>
looking for is how do I get involved, and how do I get my guild<br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
