&gt; Ruh roh!  Time to start moving.  So then as I am heading to the Plains of<br/>
&gt; the Western Karana, I sees old Guard Frederick killing some corrupt lion and<br/>
&gt; I train Merv onto poor old Guard Fred.  Well, old Fred starts whacking on<br/>
&gt; Merv but Merv don&#39;t care about some lame greenie whacking at him and keeps<br/>
&gt; chasing me.  So, I just keep on kiting and eventually Fred nibbles him down<br/>
&gt; and KS&#39;s him off me.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now I am thinking, hmmm, I bet I could do this with a party member and we<br/>
&gt; would get he kill and the xp??? Might have to try it sometime.  I think that<br/>
&gt; Merv might view things a little differently if a party member is slashing<br/>
&gt; his tail feathers or not?  Or charm Fred when he has Merv down to low health<br/>
&gt; - I guess that would have worked too.  I was in a risk adverse mood right<br/>
&gt; then.<br/>

immediatley turned on him and killed him. If the griffon was already low<br/>
enough and fred killed it, you would have gotten XP, and could have<br/>
looted it and run for the zone. Since fred does not die in this<br/>
scenario, no faction hit. Have to test if you get faction hits from your<br/>
pet dying to an NPC, not sure on this one.<br/>

Sylly, no offense, you seem to have trouble charming? (just from your<br/>
post here) One misconception I think many Bards have is that you sing<br/>
charm, it works and you sit back and watch the show. This is not true.<br/>
I&#39;d say charm fails at LEAST 50%, maybe 75% some times. The trick is to<br/>
weave charm and selo&#39;s(with drum) so you can run backwards from the<br/>
targets and re-sing charm as many times as needed. During a particularly<br/>
bad run yesterday I had to sing charm NINE times before I charmed my HG.<br/>
