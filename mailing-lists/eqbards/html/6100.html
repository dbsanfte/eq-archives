<div id="ygrps-yiv-109178239">Last night I was camping the Preacher room in Permafrost with a 23rd Wizard, a<br/>
22nd Wizard, a 22nd Cleric, and a 19th bard.  I&#39;m pretty damn young to be<br/>
there, as those are hard-hitting Ice Goblins and heavy casters that we&#39;re<br/>
fighting.  We held our own there for about five hours - with me mostly using<br/>
instruments and not weapons - in fact we were TANKLESS.  We got a tell at<br/>
about the four hour mark from two Warriors wanting to join our group - and we<br/>
declined!  I routinely pulled Gobs from the surrounding area when mana<br/>
permitted as well.<br/>
<br/>
If heavy casters were in the pull (and they throw Force Shock and the like) I<br/>
would switch to button bank 2 (my &quot;caster&quot; bank) and play Anthem, Guardian and<br/>
Elemental while holding a drum.  Anthem was played because my cleric was<br/>
melee&#39;ing fairly often as was one of the Wizards, so it&#39;s better than nothing.<br/>
Our magic resists with the drum equipped were in the low 70s, and 40ish for<br/>
heat and cold.  Not shabby, but can I do better at my level without a MM drum?<br/>
Any stacking advice would be welcome.  I didn&#39;t play Hymn much fighting the<br/>
casters &#39;cause .. what&#39;s the point?  They&#39;re either gonna burn you for 150<br/>
points or not, and Hymn isn&#39;t going to help much since my drum is equipped.<br/>
Besides, we had a Cleric in the group (she saved my bacon when down to 30HPs<br/>
on about three different occassions).<br/>
<br/>
If there were no casters involved I would switch to button bank 1 (my &quot;melee&quot;<br/>
bank) and play Warsong, Anthem and Hymn of Restoration.  In appropriate<br/>
situations I can also use Bellow or Denon&#39;s Distruptive Discord on this bank,<br/>
but Bellow is pretty pathetic when you&#39;re fighting multiple mobs and DDD can<br/>
really get you in trouble in a dungeon where you can&#39;t even use Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby was also used a fair amount and the Gobs didn&#39;t resist TOO much.  I<br/>
would equip my mandolin and just stand there playing Lullable while the<br/>
casters burned the gobs or beat on them with sticks.  Usually during this type<br/>
of cheezy caster melee combat I was typing &quot;Fight one&quot;,  &quot;Fight one&quot; over and<br/>
over.  It takes some people a long time to realize what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, we did pretty well.  I didn&#39;t die once (and gained level 20), and the<br/>
casters only had one round of deaths, so I think we fared very well all things<br/>
considered.<br/>
<br/>
What could I have done differently and/or better?  More experienced bards<br/>
please speak up!<br/>
<br/>
For reference, when in melee my weapons are Dragoon Dirk or Barbed Leather<br/>
Whip in the offhand with Thulian Bladed Claws in my primary hand.  This<br/>
character is *not* twinked believe it or not...<br/>

<br/>
PS - My bard is still leveling discouragingly fast.  I&#39;m having too much fun<br/>
with her and sure don&#39;t want to see it end.  My damn monk took 5 times longer<br/>
to level than this bard.<br/>
