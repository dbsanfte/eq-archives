<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653486282">I just hesitate to actually hit the monster with anything,<br/>
just because it is part of the etiquette I follow.  Now,<br/>
lullaby is a bit of a different manner.  I played punching<br/>
bag for someone one, by doing this to the two orcs<br/>
that jumped him, and I believe it was OBVIOUS that I<br/>
was not attacking, as I just stood and played, without<br/>
swinging back :)<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I would love to see (but probably won&#39;t,<br/>
for balance reasons) is for a small set of our beneficial<br/>
songs (Chant, Hymm, the Psalms) to work on a<br/>
targeted, non-grouped PC.  I consistently invite people<br/>
sitting and healing to share my song, while I&#39;m healing,<br/>
but you can only do that when you&#39;re solo.  I saved<br/>
someone from poison the other day, but I had to group<br/>
with him first, and if I&#39;d been grouped he would have<br/>
died (I&#39;ve intended to get my bind wounds skill up for a<br/>
while now, I just haven&#39;t had time).<br/>

&gt;&gt; Something neat about shamans (and I assume clerics, druids<br/>
&gt;&gt; and enchanters) is the ability to commit random acts of kindness.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Walk up to a fight, looks close?  Cast a heal or two, and a<br/>
&gt;&gt; couple of buffs, walk on.  I&#39;ve yet to find a way to do this well<br/>
&gt;&gt; with my bard.  The only way to do it is to directly affect the<br/>
&gt;&gt; mob, and that seems rude to me without an invitation, even if<br/>
&gt;&gt; there is no chance of kill stealing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyone got any tips for this sort of activity as a bard? </span></blockquote></div>
