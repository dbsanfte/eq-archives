<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207931890">On the subject of armor and weapons.. ithink the creators allowed bards<br/>
this purely for a balance issue..if the bard couldnt wear/use these better<br/>
things he would be far less effective at combat..which would mean his songs<br/>
would need to be pumped up...but if they did this he&#39;s becoming to much<br/>
like a spell caster...so to maintain the bard mix of melee/spells they made<br/>
such things available to the bard..altough like all things if you want to<br/>
role play it ...you dont have to use them.<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s a great topic - what weapon should a bard roleplay? I suddenly feel<br/>
&gt;guilty about my Mino Axe - Luini has a great point. Before EQ, I always<br/>
&gt;thought the bard to be far more roguish than warriorish. After all, they<br/>
&gt;struggle in the streets, searching for musical success, they linger about in<br/>
&gt;bawdy bars, and are generally lounge-abouts. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you think in this vein, perhaps something more like a dagger is<br/>
&gt;appropriate. I find the giant snake fang works well, but seems a little<br/>
&gt;&quot;crude&quot; from a roleplay standpoint. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In swords, I find the bastard sword might be a worthy choice for roleplay,<br/>
&gt;but not that great for combat. It seems to me axes wouldn&#39;t really be a good<br/>
&gt;roleplay choice - they&#39;re cumbersome, have exposed blades (usually) and are<br/>
&gt;&quot;aggressive&quot; weapons (a sword/staff can be used for sparring and parrying,<br/>
&gt;but an axe is built to rip skin). I think a bard, who probably doesn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;fulfillment from combat, rather from performing, and carousing, would carry<br/>
&gt;an unobtrusive weapon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I realize I didn&#39;t truly answer the question, but with EQ, we must choose -<br/>
&gt;do you want to use a weapon for roleplay? Or for combat effectiveness?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This leads me to ask the inevitable - why is it that bards can wear plate,<br/>
&gt;chain and even banded? How can ANYONE play an instrument in that attire? I<br/>
&gt;know when my comrades perform in public they switch to less combative<br/>
&gt;apparel. But I wonder if the bard is a class that was fully thought out by<br/>
&gt;the creators of EQ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;More questions than answers,<br/>

&gt;Greetings, name&#39;s Luini figure since I don&#39;t know much about the<br/>
&gt;Soebards I won&#39;t talk about them, instead I have a question. I know that<br/>
&gt;a Mino Axe is a good 1h-slashing weapon, however I don&#39;t feel it fits in<br/>
&gt;with my &quot;bardic attitude&quot; if you understand my meaning. Its a massive,<br/>
&gt;slow, big axe thing from a minotaur, and I&#39;m a bard who likes to travel,<br/>
&gt;sing his songs and bring mirth. I was using a bronze long sword, now<br/>
&gt;switched to a plain old Axe (smaller and quicker than a mino), So I ask<br/>
&gt;you all Whats a good weapon that is not imposing like a mino axe for a<br/>
&gt;level 8 bard, or even for any level bard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
&gt;Luini<br/>
