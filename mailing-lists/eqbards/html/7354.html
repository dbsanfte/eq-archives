<b>Subject:</b> Re: Accelerando vs Chain breaking root <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-619089027">After Chain breaks Root, you will move at a slow rate until the Chain affect <br/>
is gone (usually less than 5 to 10 sec).  It is not as good as breaking Root <br/>
with Accelerado, but better than being rooted for 30+ seconds.  And if you <br/>
are outdoor, once root is broken, you can fire up Accelerado and that will <br/>
cancel the Chain effect right the way.  Chain works both indoor and outdoor, <br/>
and most the stuff that will root you will be inside a dungeon anyway after <br/>
level 23.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Knowing that you can break root with Chains by targetting yourself, what<br/>
&gt;happens once the root is broken? Do you suffer the effects of Chains until<br/>
&gt;it wears off or can you move at normal speeds?   This is a viable tactic to<br/>
&gt;use if you resume moving at normal speeds.  If you suffer the effects of<br/>
&gt;Chain, it doesn&#39;t appear to be a viable option to me unless you assume the<br/>
&gt;effect of the Chain will wear out before the original root would. </span></blockquote></div>
