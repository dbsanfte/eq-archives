<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233840539">I put a post on the Concert Hall boards which shows stacking rules for<br/>
most of our party-based songs up to my level (57).  For each song, it<br/>
lists all the songs that a) it overwrites, b) are overwritten by it, and<br/>
c) mutually block each other.  There are also charts at the end which<br/>
show the rules for the two major song groups (attack and defense).  This<br/>
is useful for me just building a single song list, but is even more<br/>
useful if you&#39;re stuck working with another Bard.  I&#39;m not reposting it<br/>
here because it&#39;s pretty long and it doesn&#39;t format well on this board,<br/>
but if you would like to check it out, see the thread:<br/>

One thing I&#39;d like to note even if you don&#39;t want to look is that Melody<br/>
of Ervaj (level 50 stackable haste) overwrites most of our resist<br/>
songs.  They can&#39;t be sung if MoE is up, and MoE will just replace the<br/>
icon.  Just an FYI.<br/>
