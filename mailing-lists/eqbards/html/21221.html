<br/>
aye i would use it too, but our groups always make a caster be designated<br/>
dispeller, and we make sure it is done before the snare/slow is on.  boy do<br/>
shaman/snarers hate their stuff getting dispelled :)  seems a lot of the<br/>
stuff we fight, if it has been up long enough and clerics/shaman mobs are<br/>
nearby, has tons of buffs on it.  sometimes it takes 2 or 3 dispels (each<br/>
dispel being 3 buffs gone) to get rid of those damn DMG shields.  that would<br/>
take a bard a long time, but if no one is doing it at least you are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yup, casters have better ones!  But I&#39;ve found, <br/>
&gt; discouragingly, that most<br/>
&gt; casters never have theirs memmed and that&#39;s precious time <br/>
&gt; that we need those<br/>
&gt; buffs OFF :)  and I can have their dmg shield down in at <br/>
&gt; least 3 seconds<br/>
&gt; (and I&#39;ve never needed more than 2 pulses)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i would say most of the fights i find myself in are single mobs and for<br/>
whatever reason i seem to almost always find myself grouped with a shaman.<br/>
so in my case, the damage shield is not as effective since the mob is<br/>
swinging so slowly, and there are not multiple mobs beating on us.  so i<br/>
would sing mystic shielding against caster mobs, especially shaman to avoid<br/>
the tanks getting slowed.  whatever we are fighting i will always have<br/>
rondo+cantana up, just depends on the group and what we&#39;re fighting what my<br/>
third song will be, just usually is not a damage shield.  or i am lazy and<br/>
don&#39;t play a third song (very often!) =b  lots and lots of single mobs+long<br/>
long long experience camps = lazy.<br/>
<br/>
i do need to mess around more with damage shields though, since i have<br/>
bracer+rondo w/horn+psalm+druid/mage to get some serious DMG shield going.<br/>
another thing is the psalms cancel people&#39;s ultravision (or did they fix<br/>
that?) and i have gotten that complaint before.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hmm I haven&#39;t messed with mystic shielding much.  I usually use warmth<br/>
&gt; (because it stacks with druid and magician shields) and extra <br/>
&gt; dmg is always<br/>
&gt; nice.  Do you find it more useful than dmg shields?  Groups <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m in actually<br/>
&gt; prefer it over Hymn during combat.  (Dunno for sure which is <br/>
&gt; better ;)<br/>
