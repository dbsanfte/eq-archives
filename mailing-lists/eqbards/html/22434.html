I followed a link off Lum&#39;s site to Dark Age of Camelot. I think they are<br/>
starting closed Beta 2 with release scheduled for next summer. It sounded<br/>
like a great game IF they can keep the system from being abused. I did read<br/>
something this week about them having to do some redesign of the rules due<br/>
to Iron Crown (?) folding. All this is off the top of my head though so<br/>
don&#39;t take it as gospel. Go check out the FAQ.<br/>
