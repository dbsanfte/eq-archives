<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024417733">The weapon is nice for clerics who want to sit back and enjoy the +10MR and<br/>
only occasionally melee.  Also, the faction hit isn&#39;t particularly<br/>
important.  I killed the renegade Trumpy many times and am still only<br/>
dubious to the corrupt guards.  Since I don&#39;t want to have anything to do<br/>
with the corrupt guards anyhow, that&#39;s a plus in my book.  Also killing<br/>
Trumpy raises your faction with merchants, not lowers it.<br/>

&gt; p.s. sometimes I have seen Trumpy swimming off the dock in South Qey -<br/>
wtf??<br/>
&gt; I wonder if you could pull him far enough away from the dock and kill him<br/>
&gt; under water and not get his pals and the guards agro&#39;d on you?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the NPC LOS bug/feature.  Trumpy hangs around in one of<br/>
the buildings close to the docks.  People who are KOS to him<br/>
wait for the boat at the docks sometimes end up getting within<br/>
his aggro radius through the wall.  He then runs out the<br/>
building, through the streets, and to the docks to attack that<br/>
person.  If that person manages to get on the boat, he will<br/>
swim after them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to kill him.  The weapon you get<br/>
is not really that good, and the faction hit is substantial.  <br/>
Repairing your faction with the merchants of Qeynos is easy<br/>
enough (visit Blackburrow).  But everything I&#39;ve found that<br/>
raises your faction with the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos also<br/>
lowers it with the non-corrupt guards.<br/>
