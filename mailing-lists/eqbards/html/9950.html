<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561981651">At 21st, I was mostly in Unrest pulling from the 1st floor (2nd floor if we<br/>
had a good group).  Setup near the backdoor of the place - least chance of<br/>
getting trained there.  I rocketed from 17th - 23rd while at Unrest.  A good<br/>
place from 25th - 28th is fighting Crag Spiders in Eastern Karana.  There is<br/>
a particular mountain (hill) next to an abandoned farmstead that is usually<br/>
crawling with the buggers - although their spawns seem to vary with time of<br/>
day.  There have been a handful of occasions where I couldn&#39;t find any.<br/>
<br/>
The ULTIMATE place for a bard to solo (IMO) is the Fearie camp in Lesser<br/>
Faydark.  It&#39;s INCREDIBLE exp and pretty good loot (Fine Steel galore,<br/>
gemstones, words, runes, etc) from level 28th - 35th.  I&#39;ve soloed there<br/>
almost exclusively since level 28.  I made it from level 31 to 32 in about 7<br/>
hours of playing.  What&#39;s really great about the place, is that it&#39;s a<br/>
bard&#39;s paradise.  You get to play with so many tactics while fighting those<br/>
guards and gearheart.  Charming, full instrument, fear / chain, pixie<br/>
strike, melee, etc, etc.  I&#39;ve hunted there with groups before, but I<br/>
honestly think this is one of those rare places / times when you can<br/>
actually generate more loot and exp while solo.  This morning I made just a<br/>
little under a bubble of EXP in about an 1 1/2 hours.  The trick is finding<br/>
out which guards you can safely pull w/o pulling the entire camp.  Also,<br/>
Princess Joleena spawns from time to time and fights with her can be VERY<br/>
scary (she roots and whirls A LOT).  In fact, I couldn&#39;t really win a fight<br/>
involving her until I made 30th.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I cannot recommend this place enough for bards in the 28 - 33 level<br/>
range.  Unfortunately, this place is starting to attract more attention with<br/>
each passing day.  I used to be able to hang-out there for hours on end<br/>
without seeing another soul.  Recently, there&#39;s usually one or two other<br/>
groups working the camp (the spawn times are really quick so it&#39;s no big<br/>
deal).<br/>
