glitch (the music plays in one key for a bit, then switches to<br/>
another, repeat).  Zoning seems to fix it.  At least they got<br/>
rid of the bug where you get two songs playing at once (your<br/>
bard music, and the local &quot;theme&quot; background music).  Maybe<br/>
they&#39;re related?<br/>

Who or what are Lute Tuners?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good advice, but if you&#39;re trying to save money for armor or<br/>
weapons you need NOW, you may regret it.  I&#39;ve been doing a<br/>
lot of travel lately (have actually lost one bubble in<br/>
experience for the weekend due to intermittent deaths), and<br/>
once you get to learn the lands, the trip from Kelethin to<br/>
Erudin is not that outrageous.  If you get lucky and don&#39;t<br/>
have to wait long for the boats, you should be able to make it<br/>
in just over an hour.  I&#39;ve just decided to start adventuring<br/>
in the area that holds my next song.  I get to see more of the<br/>
world that way (elephants and centaurs and mermaids, oh my).<br/>
<br/>
Also, some of the songs are just not worth the trip, and I&#39;ve<br/>
deferred those until I happen to be in the area (the Charisma<br/>
and Identify songs in particular).<br/>
