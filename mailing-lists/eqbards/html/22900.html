<div id="ygrps-yiv-247561142">No, I don&#39;t post on the EQ forums, too much crap to wade through there for<br/>
my limited &quot;dead time&quot; at work.  If you think it would generate some<br/>
intersting conversation, by all means post it there.  (Just make sure I get<br/>
50% of all the royalty checks, hehehe).<br/>
<br/>
I have given a decent amount of though to the repercussions of the &quot;horse&quot;<br/>
idea.  I don&#39;t think it would affect druid&#39;s and wiz&#39;s too much.  They would<br/>
not take the place of boats (which I hate too, but thats another story).<br/>
They only would go to zones on the the continent you are currently on.  I<br/>
think they are pretty wedded to their idea of putting distance between<br/>
various continents (I somewhat agree with them here, somewhat).  The horses<br/>
would be limited.  Probably only originate in cities and end in outdoor<br/>
zones.  Perhaps on Antonica (where their is some business for druids/wiz&#39;s<br/>
porting across the continent), they could be limited to something like a 4<br/>
zone radius. Something to keep it from stepping on the porter&#39;s toes too<br/>
heavily.</div>
