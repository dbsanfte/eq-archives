Maybe I have an honest face?<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s what I thought too, but apparently the teleport spot for <br/>
&gt;Butcherblock<br/>
&gt;is at about 10,000 ft.  You immediately fall and take 10,000 points anyhow<br/>
&gt;which is as you can guess instantly fatal.  Not good when you are bound in<br/>
&gt;Halas at the time as I was.  The GM&#39;s never responded to my petition even<br/>
&gt;though I was beneath the world and was supposedly teleported to a &quot;safe<br/>
&gt;spot&quot;<br/>
