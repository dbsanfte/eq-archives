<div id="ygrps-yiv-741815543">There is no power guild on E&#39;ci.  I am still toying with the thought<br/>
of starting one, although from reading on this list how much people<br/>
hate them, I&#39;m taking a second look at it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Everyone has opinions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Every server is being aflicted by a power guild(s) taking over the <br/>
&gt;   things that 90% of the rest of the server would like to do.  This<br/>
&gt;   in every way affects Bards... and Enchanters, and Warriors, and etc.<br/>
&gt;   In the past this list has proposed solutions to non-bard questions,<br/>
&gt;   thus is the nature of the list to investigate and solve problems.<br/>
&gt;   I can guarentee that this list distributes more in-game mechanics<br/>
&gt;   than any of list out there.  But more than that, it distributes <br/>
&gt;   a fun and cheerful attitude.  As bards, we know a little bit about<br/>
&gt;   everything, justly so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed, I believe I started this whole mess by asking this list for<br/>
advice on how to split dragon loot.  I did this because I also think<br/>
the people of this list to be some of the most knowledgeable people<br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
But it is off-topic, maybe we need to start a new list, ... after all,<br/>
I haven&#39;t played my bard in weeks, but I keep posting because<br/>
of the quality of this list.</div>
