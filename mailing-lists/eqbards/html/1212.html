Great, it&#39;s nice to provide an answer for a change.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Give it a try! I think bards are the most fun of any of the classes!  I <br/>
have tried several and it&#39;s my favorite.  (lost interest it the others)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Sing your songs all the time even when you selling.  You need all the <br/>
practice you can get to get your singing skill up.<br/>
<br/>
3.  but DON&#39;T practice with the level 2 song!!!!!  Chords of Dissonance.  <br/>
Nice little damage song but it will attack everything including guards and <br/>
merchants who will kill you instantly for you pain.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Hunt the nearest newbie area diligently.  I found it very easy to get <br/>
to 5th level in one evening of play.  The first level song and a rusty long <br/>
sword or scimitar should do the trick.  <br/>
<br/>
4.5  Kill any orc/skel/gnoll that is holding a weapon.  These weapons are <br/>
your better loot at low levels not to mention arming yourself. <br/>
<br/>
5.  My favorite area to level below 10-12 is Misty Thicket near Rivervale.  <br/>
If you can get there go.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Sell stuff at the local bards guild (if there is one) for better <br/>
prices.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Learn to fish for food.  Saves a lot of money at lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
8.  Soon as you can scrape together 4 plat. go to Kelethin and buy a Mino <br/>
ax from another player.  (they are almost constantly on sale.) Should only <br/>
cost 4 palt and certainly don&#39;t pay more then 5<br/>
<br/>
9.  Buy tattered armor from player tailors.  best money to ac ratio at <br/>
lower levels.  2-5 gold a piece.<br/>
<br/>
Nuff for now<br/>
