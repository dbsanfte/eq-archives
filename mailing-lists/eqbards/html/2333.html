<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-909049598">I have found another, possibly unintentional effect of the Melifluous<br/>
Motion.<br/>
Hardly worth the memorization, but when the song teleports you off a ledge<br/>
you can appear at the bottom unharmed.  I say &#39;can&#39; because if the cliff<br/>
wall is<br/>
slanted there is always that possibility that you could get teleported on<br/>
the<br/>
slant and immediately slide down, possibly taking falling damage.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the song will teleport to the bottom of any body of water you<br/>
may be in.  Uses again are limited, but if you wanted to see the bottom of<br/>
the ocean...<br/>
Or perhaps you are getting chomped by a shark in the OOT and need some time<br/>
to yourself before you die?<br/>
