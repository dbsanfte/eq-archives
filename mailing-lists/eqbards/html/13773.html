<div id="ygrps-yiv-569194785">I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not there but you complain about no new zones being<br/>
added but you have so many more zones then we do. Verant messed up big time<br/>
and thought it would take skill and a long time to get to 50 all it takes is<br/>
time and that&#39;s where they messed up. they figured they could add zones over<br/>
time. I agree that overcrowding is felt at lower levels during prime time<br/>
but at high levels it&#39;s 24/7 because well we play a lot heh. Ahh well I just<br/>
think they need to add some more zones before we get to even half of what<br/>
you guys feel.<br/>

&gt;I dont think that anyone disagrees.. Crowding is a problem for higher level<br/>

&gt;Heh only 200 50.  The diffrence is these 50&#39;s are not the average player we<br/>
&gt;are all huge addicts and play a good 10 hours a day usually. So maybe you<br/>
&gt;should rethink that. Ok how many 49&#39;s? About 200 again. How many 48&#39;s about<br/>
&gt;300. How many 47&#39;s ? About 300 and so and so on. How many 46+ zones ? The<br/>
&gt;planes and I guess lower guk and sol b but they have level 30&#39;s in them and<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s crowded in with the high levels. You also have kedge keep but the<br/>
&gt;spawns in there is like 4-6 hours on most mobs so 2 good groups can go in<br/>
&gt;and clear the spawns and leave. So you got sol b, lower guk, and the 3<br/>
&gt;planes. Now even when we did all the planes that&#39;s about 30-40 in each<br/>
&gt;plane. That&#39;s not even 10% of the 46+ people online. The dragons are a long<br/>
&gt;spawn so they get done quickly and fire giants are a 8 hour spawn to. So<br/>

&gt;hours a day. So why do you think were ocmplaining now?<br/>
