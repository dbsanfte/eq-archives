&gt; &gt; 45+ to get invited on a dragon raid.  By the time you get to that level a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few months down the road, the expansion will likely be out.  Lets say in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; expansion Verant raises the level cap to 75.  So by the time us non 45+<br/>
&gt; &gt; people get to 45th level, the current level 50s will be fastly approaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; 75.  You have to assume that a lot of these 75 people will still go on<br/>
&gt; &gt; dragon raids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Now to apply that to the issue at hand.  You L25 people, you L35<br/>
&gt;   people, you will be L50 in what 6 more months? 9 more months?<br/>
&gt;   Who cares? ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My own concern is this:  I play less than the people who are currently earning level 50, but by the time I<br/>
actually get there, I will have as much (if not more) played time than any current level 50 had at the<br/>
time they achieved the level.  They will be wearing Planes Armor, they will have Planes Weapons, they will<br/>
be playing Planes Instruments.  And I will not be able to get any of those items.  Why?  Because either:<br/>
a) the levels of those areas will be increased, or b) a ton of level 60-75s (whatever, it doesn&#39;t really<br/>
matter...) will be there beating me to it.  I have, for a couple of months now, been admiring the Planes<br/>
stuff I&#39;ve seen other people wearing, and checking out the stats of new stuff as it is discovered, and<br/>
dreaming of owning it.  By the time I get level 50, I will have earned the right to go after this stuff,<br/>
as far as I am concerned.  Now I may have to play *another year* before I get to have any of it?  I hope<br/>
they don&#39;t screw up this badly, but I doubt it, and if they do, you probably will not see me around<br/>
anymore.<br/>
