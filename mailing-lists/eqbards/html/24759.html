<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590809916">Yea, magic resistance is important. I think 42 is ok if you go with an <br/>
experienced raiding party and if they need bards.<br/>
<br/>
I know for a pick up Naggie raid that we only had 3 wizards, which my guild <br/>
said was way too little (and it turned out to be true). I&#39;m not sure how <br/>
different Vox is, but I don&#39;t believe anyone in my group died from breathe <br/>
weapons from Naggie. They all got clawed to death as it took us way too <br/>
long to kill him.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of different things required for a successful dragon raid and <br/>
you&#39;ll have to rely on the raid leader to know what he/she is doing as well <br/>
as the pull group.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember, if you go on a large raid, listen to everything the raid <br/>
leader says and obey her/him. Also, do not go on the raid expecting to <br/>
receive experience or loot. Make sure you know ahead of time that you <br/>
understand what the raid leader&#39;s rules for loot are so that you aren&#39;t <br/>
disappointed. Some will make seemingly arbitrary decisions (only warriors <br/>
should roll for such and such an item), but that&#39;s their rule, just be <br/>
aware of it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, realize that if the raid doesn&#39;t go well, you&#39;ve got to stay and help <br/>
for corpse recovery. Not glamorous, but the most important people are the <br/>
clerics and the people who supply them with mana (enchanters/bards), necros <br/>
for corpse recovery, and someone to transport you guys out when all is said <br/>
and done (wizzie/druid).<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find a good guild who have some fun people you can hang out with <br/>
and are experienced at organizing raids.<br/>

&gt;I have my own theory why the raid failed.<br/>
&gt;1. There was no minimum MR/CR demand<br/>
&gt;Thats it..<br/>
&gt;I myself was one of the people who did not realise just how important those<br/>
&gt;resists is. I was not clawed once. All damage I took was from breath and my<br/>
&gt;health dropped by 1/4 each time I dident resist! 4 unresisted breaths and I<br/>
&gt;was dead.<br/>
&gt;Mind you I played resist songs with my drum and had my buffed MR/CR well<br/>
&gt;above 100, but that was not enough.<br/>
&gt;Next raid I will only go if I can take my MR/CR (or HR if nafgen) to 100<br/>
&gt;unbuffed.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Level for Vox raid?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;I hit 42nd lvl last week and am looking for a serious raiding guild on<br/>
&gt;Rodcet Nife.  I recently posted to one guild&#39;s website and got an answer<br/>
&gt;back that bards must be 45th lvl in order to be effective on a Vox raid.<br/>
&gt;Is this correct?  Please let me know<br/>
&gt;Tyunes<br/>
