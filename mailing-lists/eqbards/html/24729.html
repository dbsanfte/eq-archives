<div id="ygrps-yiv-106131656">I have used charm in Karnor&#39;s with some pretty good results. Not to the <br/>
point where our puller intentionally pulled multiples, but in a bad <br/>
situation, it was very handy.<br/>
<br/>
I have loused up using charm a couple of different ways (usually when I&#39;m <br/>
tired), however. First, I forget to retarget my pet. I end up charming his <br/>
target and really confuse my party. Second, I&#39;ve had the wrong version of <br/>
charm memed. I had accidentally mem&#39;ed Song of the Sirens and was <br/>
bewildered for some time as to why everything resisted charm. I was <br/>
obviously too tired to understand the &quot;mob is too high a level to be <br/>
charmed&quot; message until after we ran to the zone one time. I decided it was <br/>
time to log and get some sleep after that. :-P<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wouldn&#39;t give up on charm. When I first acquired charm it took a <br/>
lot of practice before I got comfortable with it as it takes a lot of work <br/>
to get used to the timing. Then again, it&#39;s always good to play to your <br/>
strengths. If you&#39;re a great mezz&#39;er and love it, then no real need to work <br/>
on your charming skills. :-)<br/>

&gt;find it annoying and frankly not worth the time and effort (or the healers<br/>
&gt;mana).  But messing seems to work fine, can keep 2 things off pretty<br/>
&gt;reliably and still manage to sing haste.  However if I&#39;m in an area where<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m getting high resists I usually just suck it up, sing haste, regen and<br/>
&gt;nivs and try to mitigate damage.  But thats just me, maybe I need to learn<br/>
&gt;the right way to charm.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree but that it doesn&#39;t ruin charm kiting, just makes it more<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult. I hate reaching over to the F8 key in between<br/>
&gt; &gt; selo, restoration<br/>
&gt; &gt; and re-targeting pet. Just one more finger stretching operation.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would be tempted to mez more but I fail too often at 105<br/>
&gt; &gt; CHA and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to lose the AC to get it to &gt; 125.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried singing the CHA song before mez? I wondering if that<br/>
&gt; &gt; would help get mez to stick without switching gear in between<br/>
&gt; &gt; chanters.<br/>

&gt; &gt; BTW, I tested charm kiting some frost giants (in velious) and didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; really have much of a problem at all. After charming a frost giant<br/>
&gt; &gt; captain, I had him attack a frost giant savage. I restarted selos&#39;,<br/>
&gt; &gt; retargetted my pet and waited for charm to break. Then I re-charmed my<br/>
&gt; &gt; pet, pressed my &quot;target nearest npc&quot; key, and hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; my &quot;/pet<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack&quot; social while backing away to stay out of melee range.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Worked like a charm.<br/>
