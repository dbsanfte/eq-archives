&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe it was 8 gold or so but they were concerned that<br/>
&gt; &gt; teleporting classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could use the quest to get rich quick?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Think about it, the fastest way to do this would be a Wizard<br/>
&gt; &gt; (with JBoots)<br/>
&gt; &gt; porting to West Karana, or maybe a druid porting from North Karana<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering high level SoW or Scale of Wolf sould toast<br/>
&gt; &gt; JBoots. Even at that<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s several minutes for 8gold and faction, I imagine not a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of mail will<br/>
&gt; &gt; be flowing along that route.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heh, guess I should have included &quot;&lt;/sarcasm&gt;&quot;  :-)<br/>

Oh I knew you meant that. It&#39;s a totally lame reward for that delivery.<br/>
Especially since Qeynos is someplace you don&#39;t visit much when you get to<br/>
the level that can operate in Kunark. What&#39;s over in that region? Kerra<br/>
Island? Paneel? The Hole soon? Certainly there&#39;s little reason for someone<br/>
to leave Kunark and head for Qeynos too often.<br/>
