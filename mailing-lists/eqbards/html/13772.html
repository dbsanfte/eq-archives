<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816013489">I agree, I&#39;ve never heard a squawk about it, but I imagine it&#39;s been on the<br/>
&#39;fix&#39; list since Beta.  And the animation guy probly isn&#39;t swamped these days,<br/>
as he can&#39;t address any of the balance issues. So, I guess he had a little free<br/>
time and checked it off his list.<br/>

I wish the Modeler would get some time and whip up a drum...<br/>

Golias of the Invisible Drum that must be beat with a single Flute....<br/>

Hmm, never noticed that.  Always had so much trouble making sure I was<br/>
stopped before casting I never ran until I was sure I was done.  Even so,<br/>
who has ever heard a complaint about that animation difficulty?<br/>
