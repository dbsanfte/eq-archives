<div id="ygrps-yiv-361444131">There is no doubt in my mind that Verant&#39;s RNG is really bad.  It seems that<br/>
most things in this world happen in pairs.  Not only do missed notes happen<br/>
more in pairs; so do weapon procs.  Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there was a real<br/>
simple bug fix there if they bothered to look at the code...<br/>

&gt; I need to run a test comparing the missed note frequency<br/>
&gt; during normal play and right after a missed note.  My<br/>
&gt; subjective feeling is that there&#39;s a much higher chance of<br/>
&gt; getting a second missed note right after you&#39;ve already missed<br/>
&gt; one.  The random number generator really does seem to be<br/>
&gt; screwy that way.  We got two 2h-mithril swords off successive<br/>
&gt; king spawns (i.e. no placeholder in between), and the next day<br/>
&gt; we got 2 ghoulbanes of successive shin lord spawns (that one<br/>
&gt; was at 4am and I specifically asked everyone to stick around<br/>
&gt; just in case the RNG burped, which it did).<br/>
