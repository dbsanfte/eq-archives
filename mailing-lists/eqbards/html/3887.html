 </span></blockquote>We had a small discussion about this on the list last week. If<br/>
you start/stop Hymn in this manner, all that happens is that<br/>
your hp display refresh starts to look funny.  It will go up<br/>
as if the trick is working, then go back down to the X hp/6<br/>
sec you&#39;d expect if you just left the song running.  The net<br/>
effect is that you still heal at the X hp/6 sec rate.<br/>
<br/>
One person speculated that Hymn actually increases your hp<br/>
regeneration rate, instead of restores hp every time it<br/>
pulses, and the pulse effect is just due to the client being<br/>
refreshed once every 6 seconds.  I don&#39;t think this is exactly<br/>
what&#39;s going on because even if I start/stop Hymn, it still<br/>
ends up healing in increments of X hp/6 sec.  e.g. if Hymn<br/>
normally heals 11 pts/pulse, I&#39;ve never had Hymn end and I&#39;ve<br/>
healed anything other than multiples of 11 points even if by<br/>
start/stopping it I&#39;ve made it last a half-pulse longer than<br/>
normal.  Anyway, you can&#39;t exceed the X hp/6 sec rule with<br/>
Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
There was some other discussion about getting Hymn to stack<br/>
with another bard whose Hymn healed a different amount.  I<br/>
still haven&#39;t heard if anyone has tested any of the theories<br/>
we came up with about this.<br/>
