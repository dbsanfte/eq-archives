<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; well it started out by someone saying dirge was useless due <br/>
&gt; to recast time and<br/>
&gt; resists.  i said what resist problem, i never have any, and <br/>
&gt; it is useful in some<br/>
&gt; situations including pvp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>never huh?  i will go with some nevers too.  i have never had this land on<br/>
an uber mob.  i have never had this land on a character i am dueling who is<br/>
equal or higher level than me and has any sense to put some MR gear on.  and<br/>
i will never have this memmed if i am exp&#39;ing or raiding.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i pointed out 2 good ways to <br/>
&gt; get quite a bit of damage<br/>
&gt; out of this song (one of which was in an enchanter group, <br/>
&gt; where many people think<br/>
&gt; they are useless).  the song has been compared to harm touch, <br/>
&gt; and i think it compares<br/>
&gt; favorably to harmtouch with respect to damage/refresh time.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you call good damage 0.20 damage/second?  and that&#39;s being conservative,<br/>
it&#39;s actually less.  you pointed out ways you can use the song, they are not<br/>
good ways they are just ways you used to point out to people that you do not<br/>
think it is useless.  harm touch doesn&#39;t take a spell slot, and does a lot<br/>
more damage and is resisted far less with it&#39;s recent changes and i think a<br/>
new SK discipline, and DDD is a waste of a song slot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i almost never solo.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i am guessing you almost never go up against uber mobs in SoV or even Kunark<br/>
either.  you would not think bards are overpowered.  i think we kick ass in<br/>
an exp group, but i don&#39;t think that means we need to be extremely<br/>
unimportant on raids.<br/>
