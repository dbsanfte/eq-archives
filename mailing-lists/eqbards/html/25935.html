<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435319833">Well, it looks like they will be looking into balancing bards after <br/>
all...  From &quot;Absor&quot; on the EQ Developer&#39;s Corner board...<br/>

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen a plethora of post already for what I&#39;m about to <br/>
ask... but here goes.<br/>
Will some of these spells be available to the Hybrid casting classes?<br/>
Also I don&#39;t play a bard, but I&#39;ve seen them on TV, so I will ask on their <br/>
behalf.. Do bards get anything similar to this? It seems like they would <br/>
have the same issues.<br/>

Rich sent me this in reply to your questions:<br/>
quote:<br/>
<br/>
During this stage of the rebalance, we&#39;re looking at issues specific to <br/>
pure caster classes (cleric, shaman, druid, necromancer, wizard, mage, <br/>
enchanter). Bards certainly also need some improvements, and that&#39;s going <br/>
to receive attention after we finish with the casters. Bards are a very <br/>
unique and interesting class, and they differ so much from the rest of the <br/>
classes that they need to be addressed individually.<br/>
After we finish with casters and then bards, we&#39;ll take an overview look at <br/>
how everything is stacking up. The melee changes were very successful, and <br/>
we have high hopes for this upcoming round of changes as well. If we find <br/>
that any particular class or class archetype needs some attention at that <br/>
point, they&#39;ll definitely get it.<br/>

Thanks again Rich.<br/>
It&#39;s a big project. There are a lot of details to look at and compare. And <br/>
we want to get it right. So please be patient. I have every confidence that <br/>
Rich and the team will nail this down just as they did with the melee classes.<br/>
