<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002690292">Wow!  This is an oldie!  I can&#39;t remember when I originally posted it.<br/>
<br/>
I had a look at your guild&#39;s site and read up on your loot systems (you were<br/>
in the negative loot points, iirc ;)  That sounds like a very good system,<br/>
and I was wondering if other guilds on other servers did similarly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not in any position to worry about that yet, having just<br/>
gotten level 32 (yay me!) and my guild certainly isn&#39;t in the realms of<br/>
uberness like others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well with us it merely depends on how many points you have in our loot<br/>
system.  last night a bard got a white scale off gorenaire and a warrior got<br/>
a red scale off talendor.  i&#39;m in no rush to get one, the pieces will come<br/>
as they come.<br/>
