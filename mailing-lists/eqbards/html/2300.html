<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This has resulted in everyone I know camping for Fishbone Earrings<br/>
&gt; as no one wants to drown just because the Ranger or Druid in the<br/>
&gt; party died and hasnt got back, and the bard song is too dangerous<br/>
&gt; to be a good backup, which is what I would have thought it was<br/>
&gt; intended to be. </span></blockquote></div>
