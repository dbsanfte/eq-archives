My personal opinion is skip the steel.  You have 850 plat.  that is enough $ to<br/>
start getting lambent.  I am only lvl 23 and i have 2 lambent bracers and the<br/>
lambent [arms].  I also have the Black Silk Gloves (looted last night..first<br/>
time in mistmoore) and a lambent stone....hopefully i will get the shin<br/>
gauntlets soon.  My biggest problem has been the money, which you have got.  I<br/>
cannot even run thru North Karana without hearing someone shout &quot;Free Griffenne<br/>
Charm at Loc XXXX, XXXX&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, steel does look cool, and 1 or 2 ac is a significant difference.  But, you<br/>
can start questing for lambent now.  I try to avoid expenditures on stopgaps. <br/>
(i am using Snakeskin Gloves, because i looted them myself at 11th lvl, and i<br/>
would rather save any extra resources becuase Elf Hide Gloves are a band-aid<br/>
between Snakeskin and Lambent, IMSO)<br/>

Mistmoore is cool, but man those are some ugly trains.  Great for loot, bad for<br/>
XP (at lvl 23 mind you)  I was in a group with a 28 Pal, 28 Cler, 27 Cler, 25<br/>
Dru, 24 Monk, and me.  The monk and i were just there because the others were<br/>
bored i guess?  it was just the monk and i, and the other 4 straggled in and<br/>
asked to join our group...weird.  But, i like grouping with people higher level<br/>
than me.  In spite of the danger, i get to learn alot about how the zone<br/>
functions.<br/>
