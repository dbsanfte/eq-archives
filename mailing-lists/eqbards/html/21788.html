<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011166154">Hmm. I wonder if Jeffrey Sue is the same person as Algara Offkey on the<br/>
Whineplay forums?  In case you don&#39;t know who Algara is, she is a bard who<br/>
for some reason or another attempts to shoot down many of the issues<br/>
Kaearia, Rokenn and other well known bards have been fighting for.  She<br/>
apparently has no problems with how Verant is handling the many issues<br/>
facing bards.  <br/>
<br/>
One other point to make.  Just because Kitasi (31st level) and I (39th<br/>
level) are not high level bards doesn&#39;t mean we are not aware of all the<br/>
problems higher level bards have to put up with.  Both Kitasi and I have<br/>
been members of this mailing list since it was created.  Because I read this<br/>
list as well as the Concert Hall board, I probably know more about the 50+<br/>
bard songs than some of the 50+ bards on my server.  If you are content with<br/>
primarily functioning as a mana battery, then you don&#39;t have anything to<br/>
worry about.  No need for you to get involved with any of the discussions on<br/>
these issues.  For the other 99% of the bards out there who want full,<br/>
working functionality out of the class, then there are still issues to<br/>
discuss.<br/>

heh, the bard&#39;s flexibility only increases up to about level 52.  once you<br/>
start fighting<br/>
52+ mobs, you lose the ability to crowd control with charm.  so you made it<br/>
all the <br/>
way to 31 and make sweeping generalizations about the flexibility and<br/>
effectiveness<br/>
of a bard?<br/>

don&#39;t<br/>
have manasong.  but taking a step back and looking at all the classes,<br/>
outside<br/>
of clerics and enchanters, what class has an &#39;&#39;in&#39;&#39; to get into a group over<br/>
all other<br/>

<br/>
and you really have all those choices still at level 31.  as far as i know,<br/>
chords,<br/>
anthem, and psalm, as well as hymn, charm, fear, etc all work just fine.<br/>
i&#39;ve<br/>
never had the problems with pixie that other bards complain about.  i was a<br/>
mezzing machine in solb on beetles and ldc&#39;s at level 50ish.<br/>

flexibility<br/>
of a bard then.<br/>

a bard was snaring and crowd control this might be true.  i personally like<br/>
a lot<br/>
more things about my bard.  just as a side note, what is your cha and do you<br/>
use a wind instrument when using pixie?<br/>

understand<br/>
a lot about our songs and the way the game works and other classes before<br/>
you can<br/>
be that superpowerful bard.  most people either don&#39;t stick with it long<br/>
enough or don&#39;t<br/>
have enough knowledge to really master the bard class.<br/>
