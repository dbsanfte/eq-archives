Ok, lets say you have 2 guides on every server most of the time.  You take 1<br/>
guide off 5 other servers for 2 hours and give them a character on a<br/>
particular server, rotating this to cover all servers.  If they can&#39;t do<br/>
this they don&#39;t have nearly enough guides/gms and obviously do not<br/>
recompense the guides/gms they do have sufficiently.  You don;t have to hold<br/>
all the events at one time on all the servers.  I imagine they could easily<br/>
get a good group of volunteers to run events like this who only did that and<br/>
had no other guide duties.  It would be the dream assignment who wouldn&#39;t<br/>
jump at the chance to run 2 official Verant events like this on different<br/>
servers every week.  If they wanted the people to do it they could certainly<br/>
get them.<br/>

Generally, its difficults to have enough Guides online to have<br/>
&quot;a half dozen GM controlled mobs&quot; for the high levels.<br/>
<br/>
Look at how many guides you can get on at once in the first place.<br/>

&gt;Hasn&#39;t been that way on E&#39;ci in any of the events I&#39;ve seen.  Also it makes<br/>
&gt;events like the undead invasions totally pointless.  What<br/>
&gt;challenges a level<br/>
&gt;40+ in those case, slaughters everyone who would normally be in<br/>
&gt;one of those<br/>
&gt;zones.  Better to do that by having a horde of lower level mobs for the mid<br/>
&gt;range characters to battle, while having a half dozen or so gm controlled<br/>
&gt;mobs which concentrate on targeting the high levels who come to &quot;play&quot;<br/>
