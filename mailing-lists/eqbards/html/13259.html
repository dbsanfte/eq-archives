&gt;Last night in lower guk a fellow was auctioning a &quot;shark-skin drum&quot; that he<br/>
&gt;said he picked up in Kedge Keep and he claimed that a bard friend who tested<br/>
&gt;it for him said that it was about 15% faster speed increase over the MM<br/>
&gt;drum.  I tried to trade an Enameled Black Chestplate for it but he wanted<br/>
&gt;like 10kpp worth of stuff for it.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant &quot;makes<br/>
&gt;the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and the price<br/>
&gt;&quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wouldn&#39;t that be stupid - won&#39;t the price DROP when it&#39;s a more limited <br/>
weapon?!<br/>
