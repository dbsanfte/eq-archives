<b>Subject:</b> How to know if Anthem is really working <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563407749">Sure I have read everlore, eqvault, harpers, etc. but as much as I had read<br/>
what the effects of Anthem de Arms was, I was never able to guage if the<br/>
weapons speed increase was really working. Part of the problem was that I<br/>
use a Mino axe, (very heavy, long delay) and most of the people that I group<br/>
with are also using mino axes, or equally heavy/slow weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I grouped with a rogue double wielding daggers. I have never seen<br/>
someone hit so hit a mob so many times in my life. It was almost comical.<br/>
