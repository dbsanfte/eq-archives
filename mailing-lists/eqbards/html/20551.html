<b>Subject:</b> Re: Mages soloing..... err Grouping? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-102330969">Having grouped with a Mage for 51 Levels, I figure I should share my <br/>
opinion on the subject. :)<br/>
<br/>
First of all, it&#39;s bad players, not bad classes.  Period.  If you <br/>
take a Bard who&#39;s soloed his way to 50 (/laugh), I&#39;d be willing to <br/>
bet he&#39;s not a very good group player.  So, Mage&#39;s, Necro&#39;s, Druids <br/>
all have a slight disadvantage in that they can solo, so they might <br/>
not pick up the group acceptable behaviors along the way, while Bards <br/>
are generally forced to group and thus forced to figure out HOW to <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
Pet classes in particular have a little more trouble in that their <br/>
pets aren&#39;t smart.  But, knowing how dumb pets are, a good mage can <br/>
control him... and pets have gotten smarter over the course of <br/>
commercial.  I remember when they&#39;d run off if sent to attack a <br/>
red. :)<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like this mage in particular needs to be taught how to <br/>
a) /assist b) /pet back off and c) understand that he/she does not <br/>
have to get the kill.  There are bugs with assist, so having <br/>
an /assist key is not foolproof.  Being aware of their role what&#39;s <br/>
going on is a definite advantage. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always thought that a group of 4 mages, 1 bard and 1 cleric in <br/>
the right spot could mow thru mobs and exp so fast, it&#39;d be <br/>
unbelievable.  We often group with no tanks, letting the pet be the <br/>
primary tank... I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for most dungeon settings, <br/>
but in controlled settings (usually outdoor, but not always - said <br/>
mage and I controlled The Kly room alone) it works great.<br/>
