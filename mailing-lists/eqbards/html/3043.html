I don&#39;t toggle songs while resting unless it&#39;s an emergency (for example, <br/>
after the first time we fought four Greater Ice Bones in lower Guk, we had <br/>
two party members dead, cleric out of mana, and most of the survivors below <br/>
half health).  I haven&#39;t had any groups object to this after I explained <br/>
that toggling prevents me from typing, eating, or doing any of the other <br/>
things players normally do between fights.<br/>
<br/>
(P.S.  The same group fought the same Ice Bones an hour or so later, using <br/>
different tactics, and had no deaths.  We still ended up with most of us <br/>
below half health, though.  We were mostly in the low 30 levels, perhaps <br/>
one 28 or 29.  Those suckers are nasty!)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, has anyone found a 39th level song anywhere?  I&#39;m at 39 now, <br/>
and haven&#39;t spotted on in any of the usual locations.<br/>
