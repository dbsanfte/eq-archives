<div id="ygrps-yiv-979933866">Good question!~  I presume you mean besides the ones that you buy from your<br/>
bard guild?<br/>
<br/>
Mino horn - found on dead minos - good to use as a wind instrument.  Can get<br/>
from 12 to 15 with a party and solo above 15-16??<br/>
<br/>
Battle Drum - found in MistMoore?? - good to use as percussion - does it<br/>
have extra strength? Need to be 30&#39;s and up to get?<br/>
<br/>
Lute of the Gypsy Princess - not sure where - part of a quest?  can it even<br/>
be played as instrument? <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I know - but I&#39;d sure like to know more!<br/>

		I&#39;ve been looking for a listing of instruments, their powers<br/>
and where to<br/>
		find them (or how much to pay for em) but I can&#39;t find<br/>
any...maybe we could<br/>
		compile a list ourselves...anyone have any info?<br/>
