<div id="ygrps-yiv-728162431"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How would others have handled this situation?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly as you did. There&#39;s no bank there to store<br/>
your items in. There&#39;s absolutely NO reason for you<br/>
to have put yourself in jeopardy like that. If it<br/>
was a friend, I would have gone to Qeynos, banked my<br/>
stuff and came back - but for someone you just know<br/>
by seeing occasionally, and you were getting ready<br/>
to log out? &quot;Best wishes..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two corpses are worse than one.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do others have experiences where players feel<br/>
&gt; like just because we can located we&#39;re somehow<br/>
&gt; *obligated* to do so regardless of the<br/>
&gt; circumstances or dangers?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t even bother to ask someone to<br/>
help me retrieve my corpse in a horribly dangerous<br/>
situation like that. When I died in the Ogre camp<br/>
I asked for help of higher level characters and told<br/>
them what I needed help with so that they knew before<br/>
even answering. Even when I found one willing to help,<br/>
they backed out when he saw just how many Ogre&#39;s were<br/>
there. I thanked him and let him go. No use making <br/>
him die too.</div>
