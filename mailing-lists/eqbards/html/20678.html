<div id="ygrps-yiv-74276341">I&#39;m running the latest bios and AGP drivers.  It still locks up in all AGP<br/>
modes at all aperture settings that I&#39;ve tried.<br/>
 <br/>
From my research on the net (guess I should have done this first), I&#39;ve<br/>
found out that alot of Via chipset mobos have problems with GeForce cards.<br/>
Some work (like yours), but many, many, many more don&#39;t.  I&#39;ve also found<br/>
out that there are no reported problems with the Voodoo5 5500s on those same<br/>
mobos.  When I have the choice of waiting for updated drivers and bioses<br/>
while experiencing lockups, or running a slightly lesser video card that<br/>
won&#39;t lockup, I&#39;ll take the slightly lesser card (which games support or<br/>
will support T&L anyway?).<br/>
 <br/>
So, I still stand by my statement that the nVidia cards have problems with<br/>
Via chipsets.  If you get lucky (or pick the right vendor who has a bios<br/>
that will work), go with the GTS.  It&#39;s an absolutely amazing card with<br/>
great features and capable of hardware T&L.  If you don&#39;t get lucky, go with<br/>
the Voodoo5 which has hardware FSAA (GTS is only software) and might<br/>
benchmark a little less in some areas.<br/>

I&#39;ve never had a single problem with the system I built using an Asus K7V<br/>
Motherboard, Athlon 800 and a Leadtek GTS.<br/>
<br/>
Daryl - I would look into upgrading your BIOS and your AGP drivers before<br/>
giving up on the GTS...<br/>

Another issue to factor in is that the GeForce2 GTS has problems with Via<br/>
chipsey motherboards (in my experience).  This mean that most people using<br/>
Athlons, Durons, and Thunderbirds will probably experience problems with the<br/>
GTS.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the process of return my GTS and will be purchasing a Voodoo5 5500<br/>
tonight.  I&#39;ll let you know how it goes assuming this doesn&#39;t get Kabong&#39;ed<br/>
before then.<br/>
<br/>
Other than compatibility, I will agree that the GTS is the better bang for<br/>
the buck.<br/>

Expect that this will get Kabong&#39;ed soon but:<br/>
<br/>
Price per pound the best card out there is the GeForce 2 GTS at around $290.<br/>
The only card that can touch it is the (as yet) unreleased Voodoo 5 6000.<br/>
It performs slightly better but costs $600.<br/>
<br/>
The Vodoo 5, 5500 isn&#39;t bad either at $290ish as well.  I personally prefer<br/>
the GeForce 2 because it&#39;s performance window is far higher and it offers a<br/>
lot of features that games are now starting to support.  As of right now<br/>
there aren&#39;t many but the game industry is starting to support more and more<br/>
features that NVidia is offering.<br/>
<br/>
If the system is JUST for EQ I would get the Voodoo card since EQ was<br/>
specifically designed for Voodoo technology back when it was built (circa<br/>
1997).  If you want to have the performance of the GeForce 2 on future<br/>
games, however, I&#39;d recommend the GeForce.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO:  GeForce is better bang for the buck.<br/>
