I ended up buying a chipped bone bracelet for 500 pp and trading that for<br/>
the MM Drums.<br/>

&gt; The Paw is worth WAY more than the drum.  On Sol Ro the drum goes for<br/>
around<br/>
&gt; 250 to 300, the Paw is a TRADE ONLY item that if sold would fetch over<br/>
&gt; 1000pp and probably closer to 2000pp.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m very close to completing a Paw of Opolla.  This is perhaps the best<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-Planes item for Clerics, Druids and Shamans (AC 9, STA +5, WIS +9,<br/>
AGI<br/>
&gt; &gt; +9, MANA +5, SV DISEASE -5 and CHA -5).  I started the quest a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few weeks ago<br/>
&gt; &gt; before we knew about the Lambent quests :-)  A 50th Wiz on Fennin Ro the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other night was auctioning for trade a MM Battle Drum.  I told him I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; close to completing the Paw and he offered to trade TWO sets of MM<br/>
Battle<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drums for the completed Paw.  A friend of mine that is familiar<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the Wiz<br/>
&gt; &gt; says that he bought the drums on ebay, I dunno...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What is the consensus?  Is this a fair trade?  Be it known that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve camped<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paw pieces for approximately 25 hours and had to get my baking skill up<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well (and we bards are the brightest bunch).  At 28th I think that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; approaching the level that I would expect to be able to get a MM<br/>
&gt; &gt; Battle Drum<br/>
&gt; &gt; with my own group.  Is this correct?<br/>
