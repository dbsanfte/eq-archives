&gt; Had the pleasure last night of grouping with Kemvar in the Tiger room for a <br/>
&gt; good amount of time. Up until I came into the group He said he had been using <br/>
&gt; Anthem de Arms. Kem had mentioned that He and a monk had done some testing <br/>
&gt; anf they felt Anthem was faster that Celerity. Wondering if there was anyone <br/>
&gt; out there who had also done some testing and if so what were the results?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tested this and a bunch of enchanter spells during the hours<br/>
I spent helping the guild paladins collect 4 ghoulbanes.<br/>
<br/>
Warsong - 17% (I got 15% once, 20% another time, which is<br/>
    about my estimate for the margin of error)<br/>
Anthem - 10%<br/>
Quickness (enchanter) - 20%<br/>
Augmentation (enchanter) - 15%<br/>
Celerity (bard) - 15%<br/>
Celerity (enchanter) - 30%<br/>
<br/>
The song and spell do not stack, but the faster seems to<br/>
override.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already complained on that ask the archmage thingy about<br/>
the relative ineffectiveness of our speedups compared to<br/>
enchanter spells 20 levels lower.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t timed Beserker&#39;s yet, but it does seem slower than<br/>
Celerity.  Word from other bards who&#39;ve tested it is that<br/>
Beserker&#39;s works by increasing your chance to dual wield and<br/>
double attack, for a net damage increase greater than<br/>
Celerity&#39;s speedup.<br/>
