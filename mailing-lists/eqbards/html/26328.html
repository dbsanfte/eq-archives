<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084385236">Because testing games is not the most popular job in the world, most people have no idea what to expect when applying for such a position. Because of the multitude of scam websites that exist on the Internet, most people are disappointed when realizing that being a game tester is not as it is usually described.<br/>
That is the reason why I came out with this list of things you should definitely know before applying for a game testing job:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t be making $200/hour. I am sorry I have to break the news so quickly, but this is the truth. Beginner game testers usually make about $10-$15 an hour, whereas advanced game testers can easily make $40-$50 per hour. <br/>
Not every company will hire you at first. Trying to get a game testing job at Blizzard having no previous experience is completely useless. Big companies hire people only after they have proven they can take care of the job they are assigned. Game testers usually start with smaller companies, that are not very picky, working their way to the top, where higher salaries are involved. <br/>
Game testing is a real job, after all! Even small companies require their employees to have their job done within a period of time. Of course, working at home and setting up your own schedule is a great thing, but it should be kept in mind that gaming companies cannot afford waiting for every tester to go through the entire game. <br/>
Computers or consoles are not usually provided. Of course, there are companies offering their best game testers the required devices to play certain games, but this does not usually apply for beginner employees. That is why before applying for a job for the first time, you should be familiar with the platform the game is designed for.<br/>
<br/>
Becoming a video game tester is not hard, but there are certain things people should know before making this step. <br/>
