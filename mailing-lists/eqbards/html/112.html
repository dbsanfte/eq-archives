<div id="ygrps-yiv-2599612">Ok Jythri i see some repeating questions on this board, and i would like it if you could clear the most often stated ones up.  thanks<br/>
1.  what servers?  is this all servers or a specific?<br/>
<br/>
2.  what if you are already a high level and would still like to join.  i already have the patchwork armor, drum and lute.  should i still pay the 10pp if i don&#39;t get these bonuses?<br/>
<br/>
3.  what is the patron thing?  i&#39;ve never met one of you so how would i get a patron?<br/>
<br/>
anyway just help us out here because i can tell some of our brethren are interested but confused.<br/>
