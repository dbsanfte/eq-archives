<div id="ygrps-yiv-633749293">An interesting update to the patch server, for those who don&#39;t frequent.<br/>
Remember this doesn&#39;t mean all these changes will filter down to the<br/>
standard worlds.<br/>

----------------------<br/>
<br/>
The following enhancements have been made to the Test Server:<br/>
<br/>
- Experience and looting rights is now awarded based on group aggregate<br/>
damage (i.e. If a group&#39;s combined damage if greater than an individual<br/>
player, the group members will be given the exp. and looting rights).<br/>
- NPC corpses will only remain for 8 minutes.<br/>
- If a party member goes link-dead, the remaining members will be<br/>
notified.  When the link-dead player returns, the group members will be<br/>
notified as well.<br/>
- Pets with greater than 20 hit points cannot receive hit point buffs.<br/>
<br/>
- The EverQuest Team <br/>
<br/>
Made me wonder, if I&#39;m charmed will my groupmates get a message that I&#39;m<br/>
link-dead?<br/>
