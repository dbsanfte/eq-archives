&gt;&gt; Why does everybody think the spectre tower in oasis is a gate pt? Only<br/>
&gt;&gt; thing up in the tower is a pentagram with a flame shooting <br/>
&gt;&gt; up, would be the<br/>
&gt;&gt; wierdest zone pt in the game then. Unless i am missing <br/>
&gt;&gt; something anyways.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;because it is.  it will be the gate to the Plane of Hate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have heard this before, but thats gonna be one wierd gate point. Its just<br/>
a pentagram with a flame.  Regardless, there is no reason for people to be<br/>
dragging spectres all over the oasis now trying to get to this plane, cause<br/>
their is NO GATE POINT RIGHT NOW. Sorry, we got several idiots on our<br/>
server trying to take a look see at this and they are killing the poor<br/>
people in the zone left and right :p</div>
