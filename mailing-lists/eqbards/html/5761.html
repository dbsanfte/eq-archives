&gt; &gt; &gt;Hopefully you&#39;ll learn to do otherwise. If you don&#39;t, I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;guarantee you&#39;ll have a very difficult time getting groups<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;as you advance.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, because I disagree with you and then you rattle off a<br/>
&gt; &gt; comment like above will make me say this.  I am one of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; more popular 2nd wave bards on our server.  No one has ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; questioned my tactics, and I have people immediately asking<br/>
&gt; &gt; me to join up with them.  Druids and rangers are NOT typically<br/>
&gt; &gt; extremely intelligent people, and either like to pure melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; or pure burn/heal.  The bard has always been stuck with making<br/>
&gt; &gt; many songs work to their advantage, where other classes specialize<br/>
&gt; &gt; in one or two areas.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) Druids don&#39;t group much.  They solo anything they can.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I&#39;ve been in group with druids about 5% of the time I<br/>
&gt; &gt;    play EQ.  And half of that 5% was with you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) Rangers are melee people.  Their spells are for the extra<br/>
&gt; &gt;    utility perks.  They are not the best casters, I often see<br/>
&gt; &gt;    the snare spell cast (the green/yellow flying circles) and<br/>
&gt; &gt;    almost always see a full resist.  (ie: no snare message)<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I don&#39;t have time to wait for the snare to kick in.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;    do not get resisted that often on chains.  I miss more notes,<br/>
&gt; &gt;    than I get resists.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3) In the last two weeks, my steady group DOES NOT have a<br/>
&gt; &gt;    druid or ranger.  Tactics change based on the group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ...and all this speculation about breaking out of chains,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think you should get your bard to level 23 and then come<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to the table, J.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In cazicthule, I can chain blue defenders/sentinels and it lasts<br/>
&gt; &gt; the whole battle (~20 secs), without reapplication.  Yellow/Red<br/>
&gt; &gt; zealots, judicators... different story... however, once I chain<br/>
&gt; &gt; them near the end of the battle - they do not move.  This may<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes four or fives resists, but the end goal is to stop runners.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And I accomplish this without ANY problems.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Michael is right - Snare is superior in effect to chains when it works, i <br/>
don&#39;t understand why this is being argued. There are disadvantages to both: <br/>
Ensnare cost mana (big w00p, it&#39;s lvl 1 druid spell), and caster must stand <br/>
still. Chains does not last very long, but the cool thing about it is you <br/>
can do it on the run. I&#39;ve seen many cases where a druid in my group tried <br/>
to snare a mob only to have it run around a corner where line of sight is <br/>
lost. That&#39;s where you come in - chain it on the run hopefully before it can <br/>
bring back friends. I will always hold off on chaining unless the mob starts <br/>
to retreat if i am with a druid.<br/>

eachother..<br/>
