<div id="ygrps-yiv-453059743">Yes , I experienced this as well, SoW now overrides Selo&#39;s instead of the other way around. Heck if I was on a PVP server and wanted<br/>
to slow down a bard i would cast SoW on him.<br/>

&gt; About an hour ago in Unrest, I was pulling stuff from the first floor.<br/>
&gt; The group I was in had a druid who kept everyone sow&#39;d, so I was only<br/>
&gt; planning on using Selo&#39;s inside the house if a ghoul rooted me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or rather I should say when a ghoul rooted me, as in so many trips in it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; bound to happen.  And when it did, I got a rather nasty shock as Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; neither took effect nor broke the root.  There was no message whatsoever,<br/>
&gt; and I was beat down two bubbles before I made it outside.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fair warning from here, if not from eqnews.txt.<br/>
