Let&#39;s be nice.  When we all started a bard, most of us weren&#39;t quite as<br/>
sarcastic.  For me, my bard was my second character ever.<br/>
<br/>
I started because the variety of things a bard could supposedly do with<br/>
their songs.  I liked the fact we got Selos at level 5(my first character<br/>
was a shaman and sow was very nice to have).  I liked it that we could wear<br/>
armor and melee(naive wasn&#39;t I?).  And the challenge that twisting<br/>
represented(and the sore fingers - hehe), always doing something, intrigued<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I know we all love our bards.  And that makes it so frustrating when it<br/>
seems others don&#39;t care.  Well, anyway, my thoughts and memories...<br/>

Perhaps nothing more than a blue mana battery ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have always dreamed to spend 45 days of my life play a battery,<br/>
what a great feeling.<br/>
I will never look the battery of my car with the same eyes.<br/>

I was under the assumption that i was a tank that could heal and also run<br/>
fast as hell, but now i&#39;m nothing more than a broken class 8(<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wondered why other Bards started playing the Bardic class.  When<br/>
I first learned of the game, a friend mentioned that Bards could always find<br/>
their corpses (and the zones were huge when I first saw the game), and could<br/>
run faster then others...that got me to start playing the Bard, and I&#39;ve<br/>
been hooked ever since.  (It also helped that the Bard class is so flexible<br/>
once you learn it...that&#39;s a huge bonus.)<br/>
<br/>
So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>
<br/>
