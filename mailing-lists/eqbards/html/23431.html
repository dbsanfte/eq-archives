<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628657311">I stand corrected, I never used bellow except to pull with.  Guess I shoudl<br/>
have...  Though if I had been able to solo at 14, I wouldn&#39;t have met my<br/>
guild in oasis that fateful day...  &quot;Hey we&#39;re a pretty good group, we<br/>
should find a few more players we like to play with and form a guild&quot;  I&#39;m<br/>
still with them, about to ding 51 (I think lvl 50 will be my shortest level<br/>
since 25, got 4 bubs of it at Death Beetle camp in SolB last night).  Though<br/>
sadly we are pretty much out of commision, lost 75% of our core players to<br/>
another guild and everyone but me that remains is going to join some huge<br/>
guild (where we have a lot of friends).  Which means I will be lvl 51 and<br/>
guildless most likely :(</div>
