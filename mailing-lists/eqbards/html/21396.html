<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419596633">Slyde, yes I&#39;m 52 now but I have charmed something all the way up and<br/>
everywhere we went and not had noticeable resists. I also thought your<br/>
comment was you were having trouble charming blues. We rarely have an<br/>
enchanter so if the pull is too many, I use charm to deal with spares. I&#39;m<br/>
not disputing you, I just found it odd that I didn&#39;t have the smae<br/>
impression with my bard.<br/>
 Lullaby I never mem, unless we are bailing out someone in an area so green<br/>
the resists don&#39;t matter,i.e. &quot;Frogluk hits you for 1 point of damage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gediprime (who finally got to 32), and I were talking about Mana song this<br/>
week. It does change a bard&#39;s life. You can just sing mana for most groups<br/>
and they could care less about anything else. I am frequently afk and no one<br/>
notices, unless the monk overpulls, hehe. If we have a druid, I don&#39;t chain<br/>
unless he&#39;s oom, so that leaves me with little to do besides battle song<br/>
during fights when the casters have mana and charm if we have more than we<br/>
want at once. Charm makes a decent taunt for me, even on a resist. These<br/>
days, I&#39;m usually doing laundry or cooking while playing; my partner yells<br/>
for me if the group gets into a bad fix and he can&#39;t drive both the bard and<br/>
the cleric effectively. I felt a bit better when he told me it was easier to<br/>
play my wizard with his characters than my bard.<br/>
I wonder if Verant is afraid to tinker with Lullaby, or has some mental<br/>
scars about that song. Way back when, Lullaby let you kill things without<br/>
getting a blow in return. That got nerfed, and rightly so. Of course they<br/>
also nerfed our speed about that same time. Maybe they have a mental block<br/>
about what we see as the problems with lullaby. I&#39;d consider loaning my bard<br/>
to a bonafide Verant Tester, if I thought it would show them what we all<br/>
see. You&#39;d think they would have the ability (and the smarts) to test any<br/>
level range character though.<br/>
I haven&#39;t quit playing but I play much less these days and my bigger focus<br/>
is getting my wiz to 34 so she can tp.<br/>
