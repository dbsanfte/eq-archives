<b>Subject:</b> RE: Question about 30th level song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066834503">I thot of using this song to lower mob&#39;s MR and tried to clue my casters and<br/>
see if it helped.<br/>
<br/>
In testing the song (on yourself) you can see that it drop MR for 2 pulses.<br/>
So, unless you play it more or less constantly, and make it stick (ie mobs<br/>
do not resist), I&#39;d say you are not gonna be successful.  I&#39;d think that<br/>
trying to get a caster to time his cast off your screen message is not the<br/>
way to go. They would be able to synch to a single pulse.  If they see your<br/>
message, it can bolster their confidence - knowing you are helping them get<br/>
better results.  But you gotta keep that song going for several pulses.<br/>
Casters&#39; spells take 3 to 5 seconds to cast and with lag and what have you -<br/>
you need to keep pulsing your song.<br/>
