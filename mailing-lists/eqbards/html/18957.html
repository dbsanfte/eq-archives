<div id="ygrps-yiv-336719489">Let&#39;s put it this way.  At 38 (maybe 39), I could solo blue frogs on the<br/>
ramp of dead side LGUK with FCC,COF, and Chains.  And I&#39;d usually only be<br/>
down to 60% health.<br/>
<br/>
Shaman were even easier.<br/>
<br/>
Using weapons, sometimes I&#39;d have to run away (granted, I don&#39;t have great<br/>
weapons).<br/>
<br/>
I could have made it go faster using the level 2 songs, but thought chaining<br/>
them to reduce damage was more important.<br/>
<br/>
So, you won&#39;t be having too many problems with these songs, unless you&#39;re<br/>
fighting pretty nasty reds (or mobs that are resistant to magic, Ogres,<br/>
etc.)<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s good to hear.  I saw the damage figures and the potential double<br/>
&gt; resist and thought my lvl 30 song might turn out to be as unexciting as<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; level 29 one I just got.  It still seems peculiar that our level 2 song<br/>
&gt; outdamages it though.  At what level will my songs start moving up the<br/>
&gt; scale?  I noticed last night something that has been bugging me a bit for<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; couple of weeks.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here I am 29th level and except for special situations I still pretty much<br/>
&gt; use mostly the same songs I did at 10th.  I&#39;m using Anthem (or Chant of<br/>
&gt; Battle depending on enchanter), Jig, Hymn, Accelerando, and Chords.  Of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; other 3 slots only Largo&#39;s and Psalm of Warmth see extensive usage.  Charm<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; keep for mega taunting off our casters.  So basically 5 of my 8 spell<br/>
&gt; slots<br/>
&gt; are still 10th level or below.  I tried using Denon&#39;s instead of Chords<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; a while, but the double resists on Denon&#39;s definitely lower its<br/>
&gt; performance<br/>
&gt; significantly.  I found it to be resisted by whites and up 14.7% more than<br/>
&gt; Chords.  That lowered its damage potential to below Chords.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even in all instrument I&#39;ve found that in my combo of Largo&#39;s, Chords,<br/>
&gt; Hymn,<br/>
&gt; and Denon&#39;s, its Chords and Hymn that have the most effect.  Denon&#39;s gets<br/>
&gt; resisted too often, and Largo&#39;s isn&#39;t far behind.  These experiences leave<br/>
&gt; me wondering how songs with 3 or 4 effects will ever stick.  What sort of<br/>
&gt; resists are you higher levels seeing?  Maybe I&#39;ve just had a bad run of<br/>
&gt; randoms lately but from what I&#39;ve seen, songs with more than one effect<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; get resisted way too much.  A grouping class ends up fighting mostly stuff<br/>
&gt; that cons above them which just magnifies the problem at least in my<br/>
&gt; experience the last month or two.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve found FCC to be pretty reliable against yellow and below mobs.  The<br/>
&gt; double<br/>
&gt; resist rate problems you have with Lullaby don&#39;t appear to work the same<br/>
&gt; way<br/>
&gt; with this song.  In fact, I&#39;m inclined to believe the mob only gets one<br/>
&gt; chance<br/>
&gt; to resist.  And if it sticks, then it helps getting your other songs to<br/>
&gt; stick.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had this song memmed every since I got it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So FCC never outdamages our level 2 song???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With double the resist rate (due to two effects) and less damage is this<br/>
&gt; really worthwhile for the -MR?<br/>
