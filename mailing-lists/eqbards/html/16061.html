<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896141705">I got extremely lucky and was given a Kirsch Der Pavz (which I use in my<br/>
off-hand) and a Claw.  When that Strong Poison procs (and hits with a 30pt<br/>
dd), I know the fight is pretty much over ;o)<br/>

&gt;In my 30&#39;s, I used dragoon dirk and ashenwood short spear (low 30&#39;s) then<br/>
&gt;upgraded to Staff of Writhing and Dragoon Dirk (48dd proc on staff).  Late<br/>
&gt;30&#39;s/lo 40&#39;s I wanted more damage and figured out Obsidian Shard with 30dd<br/>
&gt;proc is off had wield-able so I set forth trying to get one.  I was with a<br/>
&gt;group (later to become my guild) and turned down a runed falchion.  They<br/>
&gt;must have been kinda astounded when I told them my StoW and Obsid Shard is<br/>
&gt;better than RF and whatever in off hand.  Heh, some 40 minutes later they<br/>
&gt;ported me off some where and presented me with an Obsidan Shard. I presume<br/>
&gt;they did some trading with the RF or whatever.  That was a good combo for<br/>
&gt;me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lo to mid 40&#39;s I became 2YK compliant.  In my 47/48 merry go round, I got a<br/>
&gt;Flowing Black Silk Sash and became rather dangerous (to myself anyways<br/>

&gt;So something obtainable for you might be a Staff of Writhing (75dd proc) -<br/>
&gt;use with dragoon dirk until you can get an obsidian shard (30dd proc).<br/>

&gt;&gt; Nope, not a cue for a bad song, but a combat question.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now they&#39;re all fast weapons and very light so I can fight all day<br/>
&gt;&gt; with barely a pause.  But also low damage, a 12 here, a 16 there, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; that&#39;s it.  So maybe I should be looking to improve on them, to give<br/>
&gt;&gt; me a feeling I&#39;m doing more than nibbling.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m hoping to hear from everyone else what weapons you are using,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and how you feel they compare to what I&#39;ve got and to what other<br/>
&gt;&gt; supposed (phooey!) hybrids are doing.<br/>
