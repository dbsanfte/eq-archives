<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320174403">i don&#39;t know about the most recent patch, but i know a bard who wears the<br/>
mithril chest.  i guess i will have to ask him if he still can.  i am not<br/>
sure about the black enamelled chest.  and i thought the bone dirks were<br/>
always rogue only,  but as i said i am not sure.  its ok, rubicite looks<br/>
besy anyway =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have noticed this, too, using the lute no less.  Easily <br/>
&gt; lulled creatures <br/>
&gt; &gt; now resist as though I were 8th and trying the song for the first <br/>
&gt; &gt; time--without a lute.  I have completely given up on it as <br/>
&gt; it is a huge drag <br/>
&gt; &gt; having to swim a few miles away from a couple angry birds.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d petition but <br/>
&gt; &gt; GMs are generally the enemy anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought people would have noticed this a while ago. The <br/>
&gt; effectiveness<br/>
&gt; of the Lament was drastically reduced a couple of patches <br/>
&gt; ago. I stopped<br/>
&gt; using it then, as it became less than useful on the mobs I <br/>
&gt; was fighting<br/>
&gt; at the time. Maybe it&#39;s been reduced in effectiveness even more in the<br/>
&gt; most recent patch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few more silent changes I&#39;ve found that you may find dismaying. The<br/>
&gt; serrated bone dirk, formerly usable by bards, is now not. <br/>
&gt; Same with the<br/>
&gt; Black Enamored Chest (actually I think that&#39;s supposed to be black<br/>
&gt; enamaled and eq&#39;lizer has it spelled wrong but I&#39;d have to <br/>
&gt; wait until I<br/>
&gt; get in game and check with our cleric to be sure), which is <br/>
&gt; now wearable<br/>
&gt; by every plate wearing class but the bard. I&#39;ve also heard but haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; yet confirmed, that the Mithril chest plate is also not wearable by<br/>
&gt; bards. It looks like we have effectively been turned into <br/>
&gt; honorary chain<br/>
&gt; wearers in terms of magic armor, in that Rubicite so far is the only<br/>
&gt; armor other than steel and bronze that we can actually wear.<br/>
