The bard-specific part is:<br/>

    Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma and<br/>
    one&#39;s saves. Your charisma is related to how well you<br/>
    interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<br/>
    Bard&#39;s singing skill has a check against charisma. <br/>
<br/>
I guess this explains where the talk about charisma affecting<br/>
missed notes started.  And the talk about charisma not<br/>
affecting resists is a misinterpretation (your charisma does<br/>
not affect *your* resist rate).  The entire post is included<br/>

Spell News From Zatkin: Ensnare <br/>
Community News [ 11:51 PM PT ] - Den &lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:den@...">den@...</a>?subject=EQNews&gt; <br/>
From Edward: <br/>
<br/>
    In a series of recent emails with Geoffrey Zatkin [Verant<br/>
Interactive&#39;s resident magic guru], I pointed out the results<br/>
of some experiments with Ensnare. According to<br/>
    GZ, Ensnare was designed to last substantially longer than<br/>
Snare (which only makes sense, as Druids get Ensnare at 29th<br/>
level). However, based on a series of<br/>
    controlled tests on a yellow monster, it appeared that<br/>
Ensnare would last only 5 to 10 seconds. GZ just sent the<br/>
following message, indicating that Ensnare might be<br/>
    fixed tomorrow: <br/>
    &quot;Hmm - I made a change - we are patching spells tomorrow<br/>
morning - see if it works better for you then. :) <br/>

    Thanks! <br/>

<br/>
    Last week Verant held a social at a local Milwaukee bar,<br/>
Bucky Bradleys. Yes, there was free food and drinks, however,<br/>
there was also easy access to three of the<br/>
    four persons I most wanted to ask questions of. The only<br/>
one missing was Mr. Zatkin. <br/>
    From 7pm to 10:30pm we deluged Verant bigwigs with<br/>
questions concerning EQ. To our astonishment and pleasant<br/>
surprise we were given direct, concise answers<br/>
    to all questions. These guys even did it with a twinkle in<br/>
their eyes. Personally I was very impresses with how they<br/>
handled themselves. There were approximately<br/>
    100 to 125 players there all wanting to bend Verant&#39;s ear.<br/>
I think no one was disappointed. Of course there was a machine<br/>
gun type atmosphere of questioning. Here<br/>
    is what I found out. <br/>
<br/>
    Camping is a major priority with Verant at this time.<br/>
Smedley&#39;s thought is the world is overcrowded. He leans<br/>
towards making similar items available in other areas.<br/>
    An example of this would be Jboots (call them Tboots for<br/>
travelers boots) and put them somewhere other than Najena.<br/>
Much is in the works here. <br/>
    When told that we maxed our characters in under 30 days<br/>
/played time Smedley suddenly was Very interested in us and<br/>
queried us on how. He called us the<br/>
    Milwaukee guard killers and said to pay attention to them<br/>
after the next patch. (and started dialing his cellphone :-()<br/>
<br/>
    Plane of Fear (PoF). Why is the God CT was such a wimp.<br/>
Smedley told us to drink to our characters tonight because in<br/>
a week, upon entering the PoF they would<br/>
    not be around.Smedley said the 16hour respawn time was due<br/>
to the economics of high level items in the game. (He thinks<br/>
the PoF is WAY too easy) <br/>
<br/>
    Smedley said the penalty levels (divisible by 5 levels)<br/>
was an uncontrollable error and was unavoidable. <br/>
<br/>
    Smedley said that the Shaman was one of the most difficult<br/>
classes to balance. He also stated that they were going to get<br/>
an entertaining revamp to their much<br/>
    nerfed disease spells.<br/>
<br/>
    Smedley said the tracking screen probably will never get a<br/>
scrollbar and yes, Druids only get track to 20% skill. <br/>
<br/>
    McQuaid said that outdoor shrink was not going to be<br/>
implemented because he thinks shrunken PCs outdoors look<br/>
terrible. <br/>
<br/>
    McQuaid said that personal gate was probably going to be<br/>
removed as a way out of the PoF. <br/>
<br/>
    McQuaid hinted at there not being ANY way out of the PoF<br/>
in the future other than a Zone line he himself places in<br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
    McQuaid said he is considering putting a 200 to 400HP<br/>
damage effect just from zoning into the PoF. <br/>
    McQuaid smiled mischievously when we asked if the portal<br/>
out was in the Temple in PoF. He said the Hate plane opening<br/>
is not yet on the schedule. <br/>
<br/>
    McQuaid is disappointed at how the ranger turned out. He<br/>
wanted him to be the master of Dual Wield. <br/>
<br/>
    McQuaid said there wouldn&#39;t be an Improved Spirit of the<br/>
Wolf. He thinks the world is too small already. <br/>
<br/>
    McQuaid said they forgot to place the shield icon on the<br/>
Barbarian class (WHOOPS) and that it is a 10meg library file<br/>
that controls that so no fix soon. <br/>
    McQuaid said he wanted warriors to be jazzed up just a bit<br/>
more. Perhaps weapon specialization.... <br/>
<br/>
    McQuaid said there is a marked difference in experience<br/>
required according to class and race. He also said that they<br/>
would not give out formulas and to question<br/>
    what the rumor mill says about this. Obviously, there is a<br/>
huge spreadsheet somewhere detailing class experience charts<br/>
and penalties.<br/>
<br/>
    Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma and<br/>
one&#39;s saves. Your charisma is related to how well you<br/>
interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<br/>
    Bard&#39;s singing skill has a check against charisma. <br/>
<br/>
    Bulter gave me a 20 minute history of the Guide program.<br/>
He explained what Verant&#39;s position and policies on exploiting<br/>
were and that there have been quite a high<br/>
    number of banned players. The golden rule here is that if<br/>
you are decreasing another player&#39;s enjoyment of the game you<br/>
are going to be in trouble. If you do same to<br/>
    multiple players you will be starting over.</div>
