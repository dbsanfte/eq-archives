<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-895027931">Hi everyone. :)  I&#39;m hoping that maybe you guys can help me out.  I&#39;m FAST approaching my 17th season when I will get that wonderous skill, dual wield.  Now, I have a few questions. *smiles*<br/>
<br/>
1) How do you determine what weapon to put in what hand?  I&#39;ve heard to make sure they have different delays, and that makes sense, but I&#39;m a bit baffled on the rest.<br/>
<br/>
2) Is it possible to dual wield weapons of different skills?  i.e. a slashing and a blunt...<br/>
<br/>
3) Is it better to dual wield that way, if it&#39;s possible, or to use the same kind of weapon?<br/>
<br/>
4) Currently I have a Water Crystal staff, a Dragoon Dirk (that sits in my range slot for the stats), someone&#39;s Poker (can&#39;t remember the NPC name), and a SWA and a sword that a higher level let me &quot;borrow&quot;, though I don&#39;t remember the name of stats, so I guess I&#39;ll get back to you on that and the poker.  Would these be good for dual wielding, or should I look into getting something else?  Bear in mind, I&#39;m only 15-17th level and NOT that rich anymore.  (Spent way too much of it on armor for myself and friends.)<br/>
<br/>
Anything you guys can suggest, advice, pass on will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks a heap. *smiles*<br/>
