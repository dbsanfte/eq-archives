<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876336413">In the strictest powergaming terms, the Voice Graft spell isn&#39;t worth much. But in in roleplaying terms it can be hilarious. I allude to an incident I had several weeks ago whilst playing my gnome magician.<br/>
<br/>
 I was in North Ro making Dorn&#39;s life a living hell. (hey, after all, he does it to everyone else, so turn about is fair play.) As I was waiting for Dorn to gather his charcoaled body parts back together (respawn), a dark elf necromancer happened by and didn&#39;t care too much for what I was doing to his kinsman. Unable or unwilling to take any direct action against me, instead he cast the Voice Graft spell upon my summoned elemental (I was not aware this had happened at the time of course.) Next thing I know, my elemental begins to berate me for a number of things (like he had this long laundry list of complaints he had been saving up andf just now had the opportunity to voice them.) He accused me of being overbearing, a coward (I always sent the elemental into a fight first and hid behind him like any good mage would), and of course, called me SHORT!! <br/>
<br/>
Well, out of character, I knew what the necro had done and was almost laughing my @ss off, but in character, my gnome was furious with the disrespect he was being shown. So he calmly and cooly stated (with /say so the necro could here it) &quot;Your statements may or may not be true. But always remember that it is I who hold ultimate control over your meager existence.&quot; I then followed this with a /pet get lost command, to which the pet stated, as he always does, &quot;As you wish Master.&quot; My insolent pet was gone and the dark elf necro and I had an excellent role playing experience, though we never actually exchanged a word during the entire episode. All due to the &quot;worthless&#39; Voice Graft spell.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, any one who can have that kind of sense of humor and is not playing a bard is wasting their talent.<br/>

Well then the problem with this is that all mages get this spell which is<br/>
also useless not to mention other useless spells. For instance Necros get a<br/>
spell called Voice Graft that lets you talk through your pet. What good is<br/>
that?<br/>
