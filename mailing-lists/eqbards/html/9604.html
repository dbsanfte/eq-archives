<div id="ygrps-yiv-746202751">I think there have been some great thoughts and suggestions to try to solve the incessant economy, camping, and framing problems in the game.  But speaking as an experienced Programmer - who&#39;s primary area of expertise is database programming; I am skeptical that these changes are possible in the base release of the code. <br/>
<br/>
    A decay feature would require each item type to have a decay rate associated with it (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to have all items decay at the exact same rate).  Each INDIVIDUAL item would have to have a date or some sort of variable to track it&#39;s decay state.  Verant is already struggling with the size of the database.  (Hence the change to decay time of duplicate corpses)<br/>
<br/>
    The one Loot once would have a similar type of major database change - codewise even much trickier.  Lore is pretty easy - just check what you have.  Loot Once would require a historical database of every item a player ever looted.<br/>
<br/>
    In addition to increasing the size of the database - they will have to do a conversion the existing database to populate these values.  This would probably take many hours to run - and would have to be done while the servers are down.<br/>
<br/>
    This would take a lot of coding and a lot of testing - and would definitely take resources away from fixing things that are broken.  This couldn&#39;t really be done as part of the expansion - since then players who don&#39;t buy the expansion - wouldn&#39;t have this code.  The easiest way to implement and avoid a major database conversion - would be to make all existing items no-decay and new ones decay.  But this would make the problem worse - as people would be selling &quot;pre-patch&quot; items - and how would you tell?  It would be a detriment to new players - as they won&#39;t have items in their inventory that are no-decay.<br/>
<br/>
    I think these types of suggestions are more likely to be included in EQ2 - which is probably a good two or three years away (look how long it&#39;s taking Origin to get to UOL2...)<br/>
