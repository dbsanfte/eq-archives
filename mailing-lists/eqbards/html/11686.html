<b>Subject:</b> Charm and Bellow being nerfed on Test Server? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-617900774">Don&#39;t know if this is true or not.  However, a bard<br/>
that plays on the test server claims they have<br/>
introduced some nerfs--err enhancements to charm and<br/>
bellow.  <br/>
<br/>
Apparently bellow&#39;s distance has been reduced to 2/3<br/>
of the normal distance.  Charm distance has been<br/>
reduced to the NEW bellow distance.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm this?  This would really blow.<br/>
