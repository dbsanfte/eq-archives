&gt; &gt; well it started out by someone saying dirge was useless due <br/>
&gt; &gt; to recast time and<br/>
&gt; &gt; resists.  i said what resist problem, i never have any, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; it is useful in some<br/>
&gt; &gt; situations including pvp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;never huh?  i will go with some nevers too.  i have never had this land on<br/>
&gt;an uber mob.  i have never had this land on a character i am dueling who is<br/>
&gt;equal or higher level than me and has any sense to put some MR gear on.  and<br/>
&gt;i will never have this memmed if i am exp&#39;ing or raiding.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well never having a resist problem doesn&#39;t mean i have no resists, just that the<br/>
resists are not excessive.  i don&#39;t know what you consider &#39;&#39;ubermob&#39;&#39; being from<br/>
afterlife, but i was able to land this on innothule and maestro.  i don&#39;t have the opportunity<br/>
to fight mobs much bigger than that at this time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; i pointed out 2 good ways to <br/>
&gt; &gt; get quite a bit of damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; out of this song (one of which was in an enchanter group, <br/>
&gt; &gt; where many people think<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are useless).  the song has been compared to harm touch, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and i think it compares<br/>
&gt; &gt; favorably to harmtouch with respect to damage/refresh time.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;you call good damage 0.20 damage/second?  and that&#39;s being conservative,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s actually less.  you pointed out ways you can use the song, they are not<br/>
&gt;good ways they are just ways you used to point out to people that you do not<br/>
&gt;think it is useless.  harm touch doesn&#39;t take a spell slot, and does a lot<br/>
&gt;more damage and is resisted far less with it&#39;s recent changes and i think a<br/>
&gt;new SK discipline, and DDD is a waste of a song slot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, for those people who complain that they are useless when grouped with an<br/>
enchanter, they should have plenty of open spell slots since they can&#39;t figure out<br/>
anything else to sing.  harmtouch does a lot more damage on a per second basis<br/>
than dirge?  harmtouch would have to do more than twice as much damage as dirge <br/>
and you must only get a single target with dirge every time in order for this to be true.<br/>
i pointed out 2 good ways to get more than 1 target on a regular basis even when<br/>
grouped with an enchanter.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; i almost never solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i am guessing you almost never go up against uber mobs in SoV or even Kunark<br/>
&gt;either.  you would not think bards are overpowered.  i think we kick ass in<br/>
&gt;an exp group, but i don&#39;t think that means we need to be extremely<br/>
&gt;unimportant on raids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how many other classes are not extremely unimportant on raids?  clerics, warriors,<br/>
rogues?  any others?  balance could mean overpowered in some instances and<br/>
underpowered in others.  clerics for example are very good in groups and uberraids<br/>
but aren&#39;t very good solo.  druids are very good solo, pretty good in groups, and not<br/>
very useful on uberraids either.<br/>
<br/>
like i have said many times prior.  the bard&#39;s biggest strength is filling the gaps in a party.<br/>
on a large raids there aren&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) be gaps to fill so we will be less effective.  except<br/>
for the few people in uber guilds who only go on raids, what is the percentage of raids to<br/>
&#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39; hunting?  maybe 90/10?  so if we&#39;re overpowered in 90% of the game and underpowered<br/>
in 10%, doesn&#39;t that work out to being overpowered as a class?<br/>
