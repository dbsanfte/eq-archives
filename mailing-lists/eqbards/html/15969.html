&gt; Yes, that kept you alive but our solution not only kept me alive but allowed<br/>

The only real problems I&#39;ve had (only times I&#39;ve died not due<br/>
to DT and not while trying to camp from an overpull) are when<br/>
we get multiple unannounced mobs, and the enchanters aren&#39;t<br/>
quick to mez them.  Normally on multi-mob pulls, I wait a bit<br/>
before singing.  But if it&#39;s unannounced, I usually have my<br/>
songs playing and the extras tend to all stick on to me.<br/>

&gt; Been there already.  We (group who&#39;s member got the DT) camp out as soon as<br/>
&gt; the first DT hits.  We try pretty hard not to agro the bosses while we are<br/>

fight.  :(<br/>
