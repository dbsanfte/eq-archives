<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407337025">Congratulations on level 30!  It&#39;s not long now until 32 when you&#39;ll become<br/>
every caster&#39;s friend.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s excellent that you explored some of Lower Guk, it&#39;s a fun place,<br/>
however, I&#39;d like to offer a friendly word of advice.  Go elsewhere until<br/>
you get 35th or so (Cazic-Thule, Rathe Mts., Mistmoore, Paw), because from<br/>
35th up about the only places you can go routinely for experience are Lower<br/>
Guk, Sol B and occassionally Mistmoore and Paw.  Believe me when I say that<br/>
you will get VERY VERY tired of these zones, and the earlier you start going<br/>
there the sooner you get tired of them.<br/>
<br/>
As to Mistmoore, I do have some tips for getting drums.  I don&#39;t have time<br/>
to type it up and the moment (cause I&#39;m damn longwinded as we all know), but<br/>
I will do so today and post what I know.  That&#39;s an interesting camp.<br/>

&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This weekend was good to me as I finally hit level 30. Then I<br/>
&gt; ventured deep<br/>
&gt; and fought in lower guk for the first time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, now I&#39;m looking forward once again and I&#39;ve set my sights on a MM<br/>
&gt; Battle Drum, a lute of the Gypsy Princess and a Gypsy Lute. (So I can make<br/>
&gt; my lambent BP)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was hoping that you all could share some of your tactics used when<br/>
&gt; fighting in the castle to prevent the famous MM trains as well as<br/>
&gt; to give me<br/>
&gt; some idea of what level party (and which classes) would be necessary to<br/>
&gt; break and hold the ball room.<br/>
