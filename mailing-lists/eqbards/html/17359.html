<div id="ygrps-yiv-276213368">Biggest thing is, no slashing weapon can do Backstab damage.  I know our<br/>
rogue before he retired was using some kind of rapier.  Burning rapier<br/>
maybe?  I think its a Solusek quest.  Any rogue that isn&#39;t backstabbing is<br/>
missing out on a lot of damage.<br/>

That was my belief also, but when I looked through the item lists I have, I<br/>
was unable to find all of the awesome piercers I expected.<br/>
<br/>
The best I could find was the Serated Bone Dirk (8 dam, 27 delay, procs<br/>
engulfing darkness) I&#39;m not sure how much damage the engulfing darkness<br/>
does, but stat wise the EBW is better. So basically what I need are some<br/>
examples of awesome rogue piercers that he should be using instead of MY<br/>
EBW. : )<br/>

Hi Adam,<br/>
<br/>
While I will no longer be playing EverQuest I would have to say that your<br/>
Rogue is being a bit silly.  There is no need for a Rogue to get an EBW.<br/>
They are far better off using the awesome piercing weapons that rogues get.<br/>
Giving an EBW to a Rogue is silly.  I personally feel they should not be<br/>
able to use the EBW.<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone wonders, yes, I play a rogue as well.  We get far superior<br/>
pierce items to the EBW within the game and the EBW is much better suited<br/>
for warriors, rangers and bards.<br/>
<br/>
Sure Rogues get DW and DA.  But I strongly feel that any rogue that uses<br/>
anything except pierce weapons needs to re-consider their class choice.<br/>
<br/>
Thieves do not run around lugging swords.  Nor do assassins.<br/>

I sure hope Verant takes that stupid line out of the EULA soon.  I miss<br/>
playing but I refuse to pay for a game that will snoop around on my hard<br/>
drive and upload information across the internet.<br/>
