<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353888976">Is PoG faction (or any faction, for that matter) unfixable?  I&#39;ve heard that all faction can now be fixed<br/>
except that which has no positive faction quests of any sort.  And the negative PoG factions (aside from<br/>
the ones inside PoG itself) can be fixed by running around Crushbone with AE songs on (to get to dubious),<br/>
then giving a ton of muffins to Pandos (that guy&#39;s a pig).  (I&#39;m warmly now, but I only got one<br/>
inadvertent kill in PoG).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here thoroughly crushed their factions and then tested to see whether they were able to get it<br/>
back?<br/>

&gt; 1.  It takes 2-5 minutes to camp each time.  Believe me, unless you are the<br/>
&gt; only viable pulling option, your friends and guildmates are going to get<br/>
&gt; VERY irritated waiting for you to come back each mob.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  We had seveal guildmembers of the high elven cleric and wood elf druid<br/>
&gt; and ranger persuasions along with us as scouts.  Two of them had little<br/>
&gt; messups.. one healed when he thought there was no aggro and the other had a<br/>
&gt; mis- /assist and they took faction hits.  They went to KOS in ONE faction<br/>
&gt; hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My advice... if you don&#39;t want the faction hit, don&#39;t pull.  You&#39;re going to<br/>
&gt; get one unless you&#39;re VERY careful and VERY slow, which will annoy everyone<br/>
&gt; else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my two cents....<br/>

&gt; &gt; Avoiding faction hits in PoG when pulling<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why can you not camp once the mob is off you? surely you can&#39;t take a<br/>
&gt; &gt; faction hit if you&#39;re not logged on? Pulling in PoG is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; breeze when you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have lightning speed. In my experience, many things have SoW<br/>
&gt; &gt; or better, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bard will have the best time making it back to the ambush<br/>
&gt; &gt; unharmed (or<br/>
&gt; &gt; dead).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also.. I seem to remember very few times at all that i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; been either snared<br/>
&gt; &gt; or rooted while playing Selo&#39;s.  I don&#39;t remember actuallly<br/>
&gt; &gt; being able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; *break* them when firing up the song though.  Since this last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;fix,&quot; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; has everyone discovered? Can you still be immune to movement<br/>
&gt; &gt; hindrances such<br/>
&gt; &gt; as these, or can you be caught mid-stride with a root or<br/>
&gt; &gt; snare from a long<br/>
&gt; &gt; distance caster?<br/>
