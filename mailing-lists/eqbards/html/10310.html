<div id="ygrps-yiv-751413959">i have heard lots of different things.  i believe from a test done on this<br/>
list, it shows that the haste sash definitely stacks with our songs.  the<br/>
delay reduction on the sash is i believe 20-25% give or take.  i am pretty<br/>
sure the sash effect, since not a spell, will stack with anything.  what i<br/>
have heard different things about is whether our songs will stack with<br/>
enchanter&#39;s speedup spells.  i have been told yes and no.  seeing as the<br/>
enchanter spells are a &quot;foot&quot; icon and our songs are a &quot;fist&quot; icon i<br/>
believed they do stack.  would love to know for sure.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now there&#39;s a good question.  What happens when someone with<br/>
&gt; &gt; haste effects active gets hit by slowdowns?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Does the haste sash stack with any of our songs?<br/>
&gt;   What is the delay reduction on the sash, as well?<br/>
