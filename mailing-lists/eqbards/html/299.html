<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144844759">Yes keeping things in the bank is a good ides. I find saving coin to travel<br/>
to Kaladim to buy a spare large box or two helpful. It allows one to keep a<br/>
large number of items in the bank for storing. But alas, my own nature<br/>
defeats my fugal nature...<br/>
<br/>
	From time to time I find my self giving away what I squirrel away to those<br/>
less fortunate than I. Many times I have come across those that have fell to<br/>
the indicrosynicrities(sp?) of the world of Norrath. After not having the<br/>
powers that be of this world help them there left cold, hungry, and if the<br/>
boat is involved dripping wet. I have jumped boat even to lead one person to<br/>
the dock on an island (losing all my possessions and my life also for some<br/>
island residents do not care for visitors- I know how it feels). This has<br/>
caused me to give away all that I can without leaving me much to fill my<br/>
bank vault, I also wind up selling the boxes when the pangs of hunger hit,<br/>
or to get coin to help another. Fishing, and stomping rats is how I usually<br/>
start the path to rebuilding my funds.<br/>
<br/>
	I also find a cheep way to practice Weapon craft skills is to take the<br/>
rusted weapons to be found on the skeletons near the West Gate of Freeport,<br/>
buying the cheep shaping stones there and trying to improve them. Then<br/>
selling/given them away.<br/>
<br/>
	I also must admit, fishing is the best for a bard. it gives them the most<br/>
time to talk, and weave tales for those waiting for the boat out of<br/>
Freeport. Hunting gives little time to just enjoy the company of people. it<br/>
is hard to carry on a nice conversation with a Deathfist poking you in the<br/>
cod piece with a pick.<br/>
<br/>
	But such is the world of Norrath...<br/>

&gt; &gt; The gold from the fish gave me enough to buy a sewing kit, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; ventured out to get some ruined cat pelts to replace my armour.  A<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon was easily looted from a skeleton in the newbie area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmm, I personally just keep a backpack full of supplies in the bank in<br/>
&gt; case I die. Relatively full suit of low-end patchwork/leather armor, a<br/>
&gt; weapon, food and water. Does the job. =) It was filled out as I upgraded<br/>
&gt; to banded equipment. The majority of the time I don&#39;t even need it as I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t travel very far, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll come in handy at some point.<br/>
