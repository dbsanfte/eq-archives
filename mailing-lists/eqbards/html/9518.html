<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403329791">I beginning to think there should be a level check on a critter when he dies<br/>
that his corpse disappears immediately if your level is more than a certain<br/>
amount greater than the mob.  I was vehemently against this idea when it was<br/>
initially proposed by Verant.  Its better than making everything &#39;no drop&#39;<br/>
the way it is becoming now.  This would chase away some of the higher levels<br/>
from lower level events however.  I think cutting it off at the xp gaining<br/>
point would be too tight though, get 4 mobs on me that are just barely too<br/>
green to give xp and I may still be in trouble depending on the zone.<br/>
There&#39;s nothing I hate more than killing a new mob, only to find a cool item<br/>
for a monk or caster that is &#39;no drop&#39;.  Normally I could give it away or<br/>
sell it to a guildmember, making it &#39;no drop&#39; just makes it useless.  Quests<br/>
are becoming especially true for this.  Do a quest and get an item you can&#39;t<br/>
use.  If this is supposed to make us do quests that are for our class only<br/>
then it sucks even worse as there are many monk and paladin quests but<br/>
nearly no bard quests.  &#39;No Drop&#39; is no solution its merely a crutch used to<br/>
avoid a real solution.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t agree with you more Kitasi.  It&#39;s pure greed, plain and simple.<br/>
This always happens in games of this nature : High level players abusing<br/>
their powers.  I wish there were effective and sensible ways of keeping<br/>
certain level ranges away from each other.  Like an island for characters 1<br/>
- 15, then a two hour boat ride to the next island (16 - 30), etc, etc.  It<br/>
would definitely go a long way to restoring some sense of balance to the<br/>
economy and keep incidents like Kitasi described from happening (but it<br/>
would probably create a whole new slew of problems as well).<br/>
