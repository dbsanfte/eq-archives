&gt; I find this uninformed. We are perhaps the most versatile class in the<br/>
&gt; game. People that can find nothing but faults in their class make me<br/>
&gt; think one thought - you are playing the wrong class. We have so many<br/>
&gt; ways at our disposal to do almost anything, it&#39;s truely terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
I find using deliberatly flame invoking commentary followed by strongly held<br/>
and uncompromising opinion to be more uninformed then the flame invoking<br/>
comment uninformed.  In other words a polite hint to the art of flameless<br/>
debate don&#39;t call someone who disagrees with you uninformed.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of one who has ONLY one active character since day one of release<br/>
who happens to be a bard and who has taught many bards how to be bards,  I<br/>
find our class to have several CRITICAL problems that make it less the fun<br/>
to play at times.  Does that mean I find nothing but faults in my class? No<br/>
does it mean you are letting your opinion close you off to what others are<br/>
trying to say? Yes.  The fact that using bard song in any area that has and<br/>
upper or lower level can result in instant death by huge uperpowered train<br/>
alone is woth the cost of complaint,  now does this warrent the action our<br/>
estimied brother suggests is a matter to discuss.  You apparently disagree<br/>
with him fair enough.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dodge is capped at 125 for a reason - a bard is not a tank. This is also<br/>
&gt; why we don&#39;t get bash, parry, or double attack. When dodge caps at L24<br/>
&gt; you already should have begun occupying roles in your party other than<br/>
&gt; tank. Just look at how a bard solo&#39;s in the 40+ range to see how true<br/>
&gt; this is. Do you tank a blue or higher monster to kill it? of course not.<br/>
&gt; You use charm or chains and fear as two possible options.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you aren&#39;t able to effective employ Lullaby, or it seems ineffectual,<br/>
&gt; ask constructively how others use it in this forum. Personally when I<br/>
&gt; solo, if there is any chance I&#39;ll fight a caster, Lullaby is memm&#39;d. It<br/>
&gt; may very well be mem&#39;d while I am grouped as well. There is nothing like<br/>
&gt; repeatedly interrupting a jin frogluk shaman attempting to cast heal to<br/>
&gt; make your group immediately value your presence. Pixie chase not useful?<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve watched a bard hold a bok ghoul knight in place for 2 minutes while<br/>
&gt; the other 5 in the group fought and killed a second bok and the ghoul<br/>
&gt; lord. Many of our songs at the level we get them are very weak, but<br/>
&gt; unlike most classes, whose spells have damage caps, our songs continue<br/>
&gt; to increase in power without limit. A L50 Bard is truely one of the most<br/>
&gt; formidable and broad-spectrumed options to play.<br/>

Well that&#39;s fine and good. At level 21 however that doesn&#39;t cut it, and I<br/>
have watched some of the best bards on the povar server curse the failure<br/>
rate of the self same songs lately and etc etc etc.  This has worked for you<br/>
I appreciate that.. but it seems a growing number of bards do not agree with<br/>
you perhaps you might want to listen to what the bards who disagree have to<br/>
say before deciding none of them deserve to sing?<br/>

&gt; P.S. The ill-effect on bards produced by levitation was reported as a<br/>
&gt; bug, it will be corrected next patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is there any interest among those on this list in an organized protest<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; our class&#39; mistreatment by Verant?  How many songs must become bugged,<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; &gt; many times must we be nerfed, how much longer must we stand under the<br/>
&gt; &gt; oppressive weight of the man...  Ooops, sorry got carried away there.<br/>
But<br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously, we have several unimplemented songs (you all know the<br/>
numbers),<br/>
&gt; &gt; several songs which suffer from bugs that render them of limited value<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Lullaby, Pixie Strike), and several other abilities which are either<br/>
capped<br/>
&gt; &gt; too low (Dodge at least) or outright have no value (Find Traps at the<br/>
least)<br/>
&gt; &gt; that we deserve attention.<br/>
