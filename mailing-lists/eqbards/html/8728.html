&gt;Last night I logged on at midnight PST and adventured in Cazic.  First<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I did was a /who to see how many people were in the zone.  Not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>surprisingly,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;there were only 16 people in there.  Most of these people were in their 20s<br/>
&gt;and low 30s.  Prior to the patch there would usually be 30+ people despite<br/>
&gt;it being late at night with several of them in their high 30s- low 40s.<br/>
&gt;Most likely explanation is that with no more rubicite the high levels<br/>
 </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;have a reason to be there anymore.  This turned out to be pretty good<br/>
&gt;because the entire time I was there not one train was started.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There were also a lot of bards and rogues in Cazic as well.  Someone<br/>
&gt;confirmed that the Mudwater Rune is No Drop like most of the other bard<br/>
&gt;armor quest components.  I was told the lizard fanatic that drops it spawns<br/>
&gt;in the temple.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One thing that didn&#39;t change though was killstealing.  A group with a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>couple<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of rogues in it were camping one of the spawns that now drops rogue armor.<br/>
&gt;They had been there over 5 hours trying to get the armor.  While they were<br/>
&gt;waiting, a 48 magician came into the room.  Sure enough the spawn appeared<br/>
&gt;shortly and the 48 magician KS&#39;d it and got a piece of rogue armor.  To add<br/>
&gt;insult to injury, he immediately started auctioning it.  I guess even with<br/>
&gt;the new anti-KS patch, the magician was still able to do more damage than<br/>
&gt;the group.<br/>
