<div id="ygrps-yiv-397858843">Well this is definately strange because it isn&#39;t working for me.  I was in<br/>
Ogguk fighting bouncers near the zone when I activated the illusion.  There<br/>
isn&#39;t a light source there so it became very dark.  When I told my party I<br/>
couldn&#39;t see anymore, the shaman buffed me with Ultravision and I could then<br/>
see very well.  The ultravision buff from the shaman gave everything a<br/>
bluish tint to it so thats how I knew that the DE illusion wasn&#39;t working.<br/>
<br/>
The end result is that I hardly ever activate the illusion anymore.  Only<br/>
reason I do it in Ogguk is so I can sell to the merchant with an amiable<br/>
/con.<br/>
