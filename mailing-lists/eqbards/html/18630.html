<div id="ygrps-yiv-303063067">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been having some fun recently with Solon&#39;s, and spotted something<br/>
unusual happening.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting outside the castle in the Dreadlands, our puller was<br/>
sometimes bringing 2 or 3 back as they appeared along his path.  No<br/>
problem, I thought, charm a spare 1 and keep it and its friend busy.<br/>
<br/>
So off I go, charm a giant, and set it to attack the other one the<br/>
rest of the party is hitting.  My new friend is happily bashing the<br/>
other one until it wears off, and then jumps on me.  So charm it<br/>
again, and lo and behold it suddenly starts hitting my party members.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute, I think!  Stop it, attack the giant.  But no, it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t leave my party alone, and then jumped on me when the charm<br/>
wore off again.<br/>
<br/>
Testing this out a little more .... I&#39;ve been playing around lately in<br/>
Rathe Mountains with my dwarven cleric companion.  He roots them, I<br/>
chant them to death, it&#39;s great!  Anyway, when we had 2 giants, I<br/>
charmed 1 and set it to attack the other.  When charm broke, I<br/>
recharmed and it went straight back to hitting the other giant.  No<br/>
problem at all.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else had any little hiccups with charm?  Is it just a<br/>
Dreadlands thing?  A Kunark thing?  A me thing?  Or don&#39;t they like<br/>
the kind of music I play! &lt;sniff&gt;<br/>
