<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, because I disagree with you and then you rattle off a <br/>
comment like above will make me say this.  I am one of the <br/>
more popular 2nd wave bards on our server.  No one has ever<br/>
questioned my tactics, and I have people immediately asking<br/>
me to join up with them.  Druids and rangers are NOT typically<br/>
extremely intelligent people, and either like to pure melee<br/>
or pure burn/heal.  The bard has always been stuck with making<br/>
many songs work to their advantage, where other classes specialize<br/>
in one or two areas.<br/>
<br/>
1) Druids don&#39;t group much.  They solo anything they can.<br/>
   I&#39;ve been in group with druids about 5% of the time I<br/>
   play EQ.  And half of that 5% was with you.<br/>
<br/>
2) Rangers are melee people.  Their spells are for the extra<br/>
   utility perks.  They are not the best casters, I often see<br/>
   the snare spell cast (the green/yellow flying circles) and<br/>
   almost always see a full resist.  (ie: no snare message)<br/>
   I don&#39;t have time to wait for the snare to kick in.  I<br/>
   do not get resisted that often on chains.  I miss more notes,<br/>
   than I get resists.<br/>
<br/>
3) In the last two weeks, my steady group DOES NOT have a<br/>
   druid or ranger.  Tactics change based on the group.<br/>
<br/>
...and all this speculation about breaking out of chains,<br/>
I think you should get your bard to level 23 and then come<br/>
back to the table, J.<br/>
<br/>
In cazicthule, I can chain blue defenders/sentinels and it lasts<br/>
the whole battle (~20 secs), without reapplication.  Yellow/Red<br/>
zealots, judicators... different story... however, once I chain<br/>
them near the end of the battle - they do not move.  This may<br/>
takes four or fives resists, but the end goal is to stop runners.<br/>
And I accomplish this without ANY problems.<br/>
