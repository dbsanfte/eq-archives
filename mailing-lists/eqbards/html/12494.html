&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Congrats.  Well earned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; p.s. LoD spanked Naggy - SOL-B is horrible with 70 plus in the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Spanked?  Try they had many casualities, and almost lost.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; p.s.s. ML and Storm got spanked by Voxxy and yielded the camp to LoD by<br/>
&gt;&gt; prior agreement on a certain time.  LoD prolly got Voxxy and Naggy in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; same night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  What the f*ck?  Were you there?  Hell no you werent.  You have no<br/>
&gt;  clue as to what happened.  We didn&#39;t get spanked at all.  I&#39;ll share<br/>
&gt;  with you what happened Ms. Naive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  LoD (ala FoH) does everything, they just dropped Nagafen, and threatened<br/>
&gt;  to come take Vox next.  The Vox teams rushed around trying to do it all<br/>
&gt;  before LoD showed up and the was the first major problem.  Then some<br/>
&gt;  shaman pets got lose after pulling monk FD, and inadvertantly pulled<br/>
&gt;  Vox right into the King Room.  People paniced, and ran around, and then<br/>
&gt;  chaos ensued.  It really pisses me off that those mistakes were made,<br/>
&gt;  but it even pisses me off more that you think we got spanked.  We didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  even fight Vox.<br/>
