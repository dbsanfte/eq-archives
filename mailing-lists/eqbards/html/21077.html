<div id="ygrps-yiv-333772929">Actually in this case I was staying away from it since I didnt want to get<br/>
hit (group is better served with the Ranger taking most of the attacks since<br/>
he has a better ac, skills, etc...)  I couldnt go too far away since I was<br/>
using DDD, but I was generally out of melee range (I would try to punch but<br/>
stopped when the toofar away messages got annoying...)</div>
