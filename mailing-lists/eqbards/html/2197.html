<div id="ygrps-yiv-855456446">I played for about 20 hours this weekend, with 3 different parties, each<br/>
party consisted of at least 1 spell caster, (druid, magician, enchanter, and<br/>
wizard mixed thruout each of my parties.)  Everyone I partied up with I<br/>
asked them to watch their mana regen.  everyone of them noticed an<br/>
improvement, but without definative numbers, there is no way to determine<br/>
what % increase.<br/>
<br/>
From what I hear is that when your stamina drops, your mana regen also<br/>
drops.  So since this jig song seems to try to increase it, what might be<br/>
happening is that it raises your stamina about your max, even tho it doesn&#39;t<br/>
show it on the screen, this would then throw off verants math for keeping<br/>
mana regen speed down.  Which maybe is what causes the mana regen to be<br/>
faster.<br/>
<br/>
My question is tho, will this increase the bards mana regen at 42nd level.<br/>
<br/>
Any high level bard wanna give this a try and report back.<br/>

(I camped in Crushbone all weekend, got me my Shiny Brass Shield, Dvinn&#39;s<br/>
Dragoons Dirk, and Crushes Tunic.<br/>
<br/>
Only Crush and Dvinn gave me exp.  I died once, so I came out with the same<br/>
amount of exp I went it with......<br/>
<br/>
(But at least I finally got some halfway decent magical items.) <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  The Dirk is a very awesome weapon.  I don&#39;t know of anything better<br/>
for our level, unless you buy someone elses weapon, or twink.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mana and the Jig O Vigor, true or rumor?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tonight with a group, one member complained about me negating his SoW, but<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; had no accel going (sheesh was in the group three minutes and hadn&#39;t sung<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; note, besides why would I?  They were campers).  So I memorized Jig and<br/>
&gt; played it, mentioning how I thought it was supposed to increase<br/>
&gt; regeneration<br/>
&gt; %15.  The cleric informed me Jig was making his mana regenerate slower, he<br/>
&gt; &quot;should have been done by now.&quot;  Far from it for me to play a song not<br/>
&gt; wanted, forgot the Jig.  After an easy battle and burnt mana, he told me,<br/>
&gt; indeed, mana regenerates faster without any bard Jig.  Then things became<br/>
&gt; nasty, one fellow brought a train and I saved them all with a lullaby, and<br/>
&gt; no accelerando might I add, and quite a haul to the zone.  But they<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; they were just good or lucky for all surviving that time and I didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to try explaining to them what I did, so I just camped!  Got me a little<br/>
&gt; irritated, just the remark that Jig was making them regenerate slower!?<br/>
&gt; OO,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s what got me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All I know--these folks were hostile towards bards, and the fellow who was<br/>
&gt; the leader had to flee so I only met him briefly, perhaps he understood<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; usefulness better.  When I hit a bad group I don&#39;t stick around, so I was<br/>
&gt; with them maybe ten minutes tops, but perhaps I can&#39;t fault them from<br/>
&gt; experiences I&#39;ve had with fellow bard&#39;s I&#39;ve grouped with--some bards just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, this class takes some skill to wield with<br/>
&gt; finesse.  I was with a bard once who consistently played hymn when all<br/>
&gt; health was full, and only used bellow in battle.  That, now that, got me<br/>
&gt; irritated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Er, back to my original question about Jig and Mana, sorry.  Has anyone<br/>
&gt; done<br/>
&gt; any definitive tests on this?  With all my bard songs I have been able to<br/>
&gt; &quot;play around&quot; with them enough, to my satisfaction, to understand O how<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; work.  This is the way I like things, dead reckonings hands-on kind of<br/>
&gt; &quot;feel&quot; for how they work rather than really writing up numbers myself.<br/>
&gt; Thing is, I studied way too much experimental methodology in school to<br/>
&gt; really enjoy doing it when I&#39;m playing, heheh.  (Memories of torturing lab<br/>
&gt; rats!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I have no way to get an instinctive feel for this!  DOES mana<br/>
&gt; regenerate<br/>
&gt; faster with Jig or not?  Anyone really use a stopwatch with a buddy?  My<br/>
&gt; friends keep telling me they don&#39;t have stopwatches and have no time for<br/>
&gt; testing.  I know it doesn&#39;t make regeneration slower, that cleric tonight<br/>
&gt; was just an arse, but I saved him anyway, fool didn&#39;t even realize it.<br/>
