<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791300600">What I&#39;m finding since I made 32d level is that groups consisting of people<br/>
several levels ahead of me have no problems including me in the group if<br/>
they don&#39;t already have a bard or enchanter.  Basically I give up getting<br/>
decent EXP for the chance of obtaining a nice item.  I got my gloomwater<br/>
harpoon and shark tooth in Kedge that way.  I was in a group of five other<br/>
45+ people.  After four hours of killing stuff that was always red to me, my<br/>
EXP bar had hardly moved.  Bard hate hasn&#39;t been much of a factor either<br/>
since the damage they are inflicting is far outweighing the taunts from my<br/>
songs.  After combats I&#39;ve been ending up at almost full health.  I&#39;m hoping<br/>
that will be the case when I get close to 40.  If a mid 40s group camping<br/>
the Lord will have me then I&#39;ll give it a shot.  The good thing is that by<br/>
the time I get to 40, a lot of my guild mates will be in their mid 40s and<br/>
likely trying to get Ykeshas themselves so we can help each other out.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The key question<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that by the time I can camp for Ykeshas (late 30s/early <br/>
&gt; &gt; 40s), will the +9<br/>
&gt; &gt; DEX increase the number of procs by enough to outweigh the <br/>
&gt; &gt; benefit of having<br/>
&gt; &gt; +5 to all resist rates? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Whats a good price if I decide to sell the Exe Hood? <br/>
