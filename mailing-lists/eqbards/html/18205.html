While we were doing CR, one of our team hailed this Guard in Firiona Vie:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Guard Ivak says &#39;A fellow paladin who was a member of an expedition into<br/>
the jungles of Kunark returned with a Jade Green Broadsword.  He said came<br/>
across it while they were fighting their way out of some ancient city filled<br/>
with golems.  They lost many strong troops on that expedition. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
No kidding!<br/>

<br/>
p.s. we also located the guy who talks about getting to Veeshan.  Stuff was<br/>
posted on casters realm by others:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hail Emporer Ganak.<br/>
<br/>
Greeting..It has been long since I have been aware of this plane..Who are<br/>
you, and what do you want of I, Ganak, slayer of Jaled-Dar?<br/>
<br/>
You wish to know of Veeshans Peak?! You are either very brave or very<br/>
foolish! There is nothing there for the uninvited but a fiery death. I have<br/>
been away from this plane of existance for a long time yet sill I feel the<br/>
presence of the ancient wurms. I am sure they sense my presence as well,<br/>
being as I hold the only [key to the Chambers] of the Ring of Scale.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. If you are exploring and you find zone portals (assuming that you can<br/>
tell it&#39;s a portal before you zone) you might wanna duel down and pop in<br/>
nekkid, just in case it&#39;s a one-way portal guarded on the inside by some<br/>
mean and nastys.  Although it&#39;s looking like the really scary ones: fight<br/>
your way in, one-way in and some other way out, insta-spawn mobs on evac<br/>
spells, keys to get in - nobody knows how to get out are not something you<br/>
are going to just stumble into.  It&#39;s been a long time since I have been<br/>
this scared!  Feels good.<br/>
