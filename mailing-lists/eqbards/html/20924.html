I haven&#39;t been under a rock. (although it may have been safer there, maybe I<br/>
should try it) I&#39;ve seen and contributed to many of the posts. But when I<br/>
read Abashi&#39;s reply, I honestly believe he has absolutely no idea what we<br/>
are talking about when we reference the problems with chains and lullaby.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;I&#39;m not sure what is supposed to be wrong with chains. Some changes were<br/>
put in to put in a maximum amount that a creature could be slowed prior to<br/>
applying any slowing related to damage. The change was intentional.<br/>
<br/>
As for lullaby, I just said in another thread that Ester, the one who was<br/>
going to look at this, is on vacation, and I&#39;ll have to check with her when<br/>
she gets back. Now that I think of it, I think I may remember someone<br/>
stating that lullaby&#39;s current functionality is intended, as it&#39;s the only<br/>
thing to keep them from trivializing encounters. I&#39;ll have to check with<br/>
Ester when she gets back to be sure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Like you, I refuse to believe they are outright lying, so I come to the<br/>
conclusion that he has no clue. He remembers the patch that nerfed chains,<br/>
but he doesn&#39;t know how it affected the lower level song. Again with<br/>
lullaby, he remembers the last time it was looked at, but doesn&#39;t know that<br/>
we still see a HUGE problem.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m hopelessly optimistic and refuse to see the truth that is evident,<br/>
but I just can&#39;t imagine that he knows and is covering it up. Instead I<br/>
think that he is hopelessly swamped by email, message board postings and<br/>
whatever other work he may have and in that mountain of information, ours<br/>
got pushed to the bottom and  never seen.<br/>

I generally try to be open-minded, but...<br/>
I agree with you on the experience parts of your post, not a big deal, and<br/>
its not going to change.<br/>
<br/>
On the song related parts of your post though, have you been living under a<br/>
rock for the last 6 months?<br/>
<br/>
There have been numerous postings to the EQ boards, emails directly to GZ<br/>
and Abashi, posts on the EQ_Caster&#39;s Board (which they do read), as well as<br/>
messages sent thru Baelish (runs EQ_Casters, talks to GZ nearly daily).  <br/>
<br/>
Many of these posts have contained ridiculously detailed information on the<br/>
problems with the broken songs.  John Kim and myself have broken the things<br/>
down statistically to the point where it was readily apparent that the<br/>
resist rates were down to tenths of a percent with variances of +/- 2 tenths<br/>
of a percent.<br/>
<br/>
There is ABSOLUTELY no way they can claim they don&#39;t know what we think is<br/>
wrong with these songs and still be truthful.  They ARE ignoring us.<br/>
(Harmonic is gone right?  If not, my apologies Harm)<br/>
Well maybe they aren&#39;t ignoring us, but in that case they are purposely<br/>
lying to us instead.  I prefer to assume the former.<br/>

1) They aren&#39;t ignoring us. Instead they just have no idea that we think<br/>
there is a problem that needs to be looked at. Abashi is a busy man, I&#39;m<br/>
willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that he missed our<br/>
posts or forgot them.<br/>
<br/>
2) If we can make them aware of what we think is wrong, then we can get them<br/>
to look at it and there is a possibility that we can get it fixed. This to<br/>
me is good news. The only problem is how to get our thoughts looked at. I<br/>
suggest we write up a concise description of the problems. (insane resist<br/>
rates on pixie strike and lullaby and ineffectiveness of snare since the<br/>
patch) then we post it to the bug board and the gameplay board, as well as<br/>
emailing it to abashi.<br/>
