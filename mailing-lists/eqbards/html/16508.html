&gt; Coward code, for whatever reason, is not implemented on undead found in the<br/>
&gt; wilderness.  They didn&#39;t bother.  Any undead you find in a _dungeon_ have<br/>
&gt; the coward code implemented.  This was because of the ungodly trains that a<br/>
&gt; green conned skeleton would cause if for some reason someone would scare it.<br/>
&gt; During beta coward code was put on every npc in every dungeon.  The undead<br/>
&gt; that wander around outside in the wild don&#39;t have it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How would coward code stop trains?  Seems to me having mobs<br/>
run away because you&#39;re red to them and aggroing other mobs<br/>
would cause more trains.  I think you&#39;re thinking of the code<br/>
that makes it so green mobs that normally aggro on you won&#39;t<br/>
unless they actually see you (i.e. they can&#39;t be triggered by<br/>
another aggro mob that runs past them).<br/>

since been raised to like L28 I think (a lot of bards were<br/>
complaining about invis not working on stuff anymore).  This<br/>
was a long long time ago, like last summer.<br/>
<br/>
There *is* something screwy with they way they&#39;ve classified<br/>
undead and normal mobs.<br/>
