<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564968431">Was using Pixie in Karnors last weekend and noticed something really odd.  I&#39;ve always assumed the knockback component pushed the mob away from the Bard.  Instead, it pushes it in the direction the Bard is facing (was very handy to learn &#39;cause we were in the tower, and it&#39;s easy to knock mobs off of it :).  Does anyone know if the 53rd song does the same?  Only 51 here, so it&#39;s gonna be a while before I can test it.<br/>

BTW, anyone ever climbed outside of Chardok? : )   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/chardok.jpg">http://www.clandlc.com/chardok.jpg</a>  Very easy to do with Song of Travel, and was a blast.<br/>
