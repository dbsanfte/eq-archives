<div id="ygrps-yiv-355467264">Hail all!<br/>
<br/>
Over the last week or so, I&#39;ve heard many accusations that the Soerbaird<br/>
have acted spitefully or dishonorably here and there, and that we are a<br/>
closed, rude group of people who only serve ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Let me again assure you that is far from our intention. My whole purpose<br/>
for creating the organization was to do exactly what several of you have<br/>
recently suggested on this list--that is, to reestablish the role of the<br/>
ancient bard. We record and report the history of Norrath, as best as we<br/>
can, from a neutral standpoint. We also, as bards, try to answer all<br/>
requests for information and news, and try to do so as truthfully and<br/>
informatively as we can. We&#39;re providing escorts, and heraldry services,<br/>
and sometimes, yes, we do charge a fee for these, usually negotiable.<br/>
<br/>
As far as being cliquish, we are a guild. We do have standards for our<br/>
members, and requirements that must be accomplished as a student before you<br/>
can wear the title of Soerbaird. We are not interested in being one of<br/>
those 1000 guilds who allow anyone in, and are just to &#39;have fun&#39;. We do<br/>
hang out together, as we certainly enjoy the company of other bards, but we<br/>
also spend much time traveling individually to meet others. We have a goal,<br/>
we work hard toward it, and I am proud to say that we are accomplishing<br/>
that goal on a daily basis. Stop by our library in Iona hall (on our site)<br/>
and read or submit ballads or stories.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, if you have ANY problems with a Soerbaird&#39;s behavior, either<br/>
in Norrath or on a forum, I invite you to send a mail directly to me,<br/>
Jythri,  with as many details as you can include. I take matters of<br/>
misconduct VERY seriously, and have already placed a couple of our bards on<br/>
probation because of things they&#39;ve done.<br/>
<br/>
My contact address is:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rvarnell@...">rvarnell@...</a><br/>
<br/>
The bardic profession is a noble and often thankless one, and I hope that<br/>
all bards in or apart from the Soerbaird may ascend to the higher calling.<br/>
Let us work together to enliven the culture of Norrath!<br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live!<br/>
<br/>
