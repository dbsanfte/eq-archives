<br/>
Level 14 - Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto, unless you are doing the lambent<br/>
quests and need a rune identified.<br/>
<br/>
Level 21 - Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion, unless you are PvP i guess.<br/>
<br/>
Level 57 - Cassindra&#39;s Insipid Ditty, same boat as Denon&#39;s Dissension<br/>
<br/>
Level 59 - Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord, this is what i am working for?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 53 - Song of Dawn:  Reducing aggro on secondary MOBs doesn&#39;t help when<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re the only one on the list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, i am no expert on how aggro works, but when i have a secondary mob on<br/>
me that i believe no one else has aggro&#39;d, Song of Dawn has worked to get it<br/>
off me and on someone else.  maybe someone else did have aggro and i was not<br/>
aware, but not that i could tell.<br/>
