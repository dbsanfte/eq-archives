<div id="ygrps-yiv-172623861">Actually what happens is not that the monster &quot;despawns&quot;, but that it<br/>
can goe up into the gate (just like a player), but where a player gets<br/>
stuck and has to gate out to become unstuck, the monster registers it as<br/>
a path it can&#39;t move on and slashes itself. I suppose it is exploitable,<br/>
but would only work if the gate were going down when the monster tried<br/>
to go through it.<br/>
<br/>
My learning experience of those awfully designed gates was from the two<br/>
hours I spent stuck in one once, and then a second time when a High<br/>
Priest Zaharn who kept resisting chains ran there then slashed himself.<br/>

Please keep comments on reputation unmentioned, however, (with regard to<br/>
whoever this L50 cleric was), or we can discuss yours, Torky, exhile of<br/>
