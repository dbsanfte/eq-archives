<b>Subject:</b> Thurgadim hunting? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-85521014">anyone hunt in Thurgadim? I was lost in there other night and came upon a<br/>
curve where i saw a bat on the other side, it conned blue to me at 42 and<br/>
ready to attack where as all the dwarves were amiable to me.  So i guess<br/>
there&#39;s a mini dungeon in there. Anyone try it out yet?<br/>
<br/>
And for that matter anyone try icewell keep yet? i zoned in by accident, hit<br/>
tracking and everything on track was red to me except for 1 sentry which was<br/>
blue.<br/>
