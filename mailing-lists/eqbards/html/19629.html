<div id="ygrps-yiv-656043481">Here we go, you hit my territory.  I deal Roulette and I can tell you <br/>
that on a legit wheel, I have seen the same number show up 3 times in <br/>
a row!  Yes, that is right, 1 number of 38 possibles, three times in <br/>
a row.  How&#39;s that for random?  Seen it happen twice.  As you can <br/>
imagine, 2 in a row happens all the time.  And yes, have seen 10+ of <br/>
same colors.  I also deal Blackjack and one night, in a single deck <br/>
deal, after 5 shuffles and 1 cut, I dealt all 4 Aces in a row!  <br/>
Amazing!<br/>

See how far off topic we are folks?  Let&#39;s get back to bard stuff :p<br/>

My contribution.... I got my butt kicked in the Arena this weekend by <br/>
a ranger that was 1 level below me because his MR was buffed beyond <br/>
belief :(<br/>

&gt; the problem is you are just using your perceptions of what <br/>
happens.  and what sticks<br/>
&gt; out is going to be the anomaly.  if you sat down for an hour and <br/>
kept clicking the song<br/>

to the others, i would<br/>
&gt; think that you would find that it is random.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i mean take a roulette wheel.  it&#39;s almost a 50/50 chance for red <br/>
or black to come up.  strings<br/>
&gt; of 10+ red or 10+ black are hardly uncommon. </span></blockquote></div>
