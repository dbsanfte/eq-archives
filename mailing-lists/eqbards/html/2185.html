&gt; Alot of people just don&#39;t seem to understand just what a Bard can give to<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; party.  They think either think that a Bard sucks as a tank, or sucks at a<br/>
&gt; healer, or sucks at something else, and there&#39;s always someone that could<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; something better than a Bard!  I recently tried to discuss the advantages<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; a Bard in a party with some guy on the EQVault board, but he really didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to understand what I was saying about the advantages of Bards.  Alot<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; people have their own ideas on things, sometimes something happened to<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; once, and they think it&#39;s a fact from that point onward, sometimes they<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; like to believe in superstition.  The thread on the boat crashing and it<br/>
&gt; being Bard&#39;s fault is one example.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I typically group with the same people all the time so I generally don&#39;t<br/>
run<br/>
&gt; into these things, except possibly when we add another member.  Maybe when<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re joining they choose to keep their mouths shut a little bit more.<br/>
&gt;   )  But, I have been asked to not play Selo&#39;s when a Druid joins.... I<br/>
say,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Okay, NP, Can I get a SOW?&quot;  : )  IMO Sow is much better for saving a<br/>
party<br/>
&gt; when things turn ugly, cause I don&#39;t have to stick around and make sure<br/>
&gt; everyone&#39;s under the effects of my song.  I&#39;ve died numerous times this<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; while saving the whole party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the Jig... Every member of my regular party has said it helps.  There<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t been a stopwatch timing kinda thing going, but they still say they<br/>
&gt; notice it.  Every mana user that groups with us I ask if it helps too, and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t heard even one person saying no.  I&#39;d say there&#39;s enuf people<br/>
saying<br/>
&gt; Yes, it does, to warrant believing it.  : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the URL to that EQVault thread if anyone cares to read it.... With<br/>
&gt; the new boards, I&#39;m not sure it will work, but here goes anyway....<br/>

&gt; &gt;Mana and the Jig O Vigor, true or rumor?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Tonight with a group, one member complained about me negating his SoW,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;had no accel going (sheesh was in the group three minutes and hadn&#39;t sung<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt;note, besides why would I?  They were campers).  So I memorized Jig and<br/>
&gt; &gt;played it, mentioning how I thought it was supposed to increase<br/>
&gt; regeneration<br/>
&gt; &gt;%15.  The cleric informed me Jig was making his mana regenerate slower,<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;should have been done by now.&quot;  Far from it for me to play a song not<br/>
&gt; &gt;wanted, forgot the Jig.  After an easy battle and burnt mana, he told me,<br/>
&gt; &gt;indeed, mana regenerates faster without any bard Jig.  Then things became<br/>
&gt; &gt;nasty, one fellow brought a train and I saved them all with a lullaby,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt;no accelerando might I add, and quite a haul to the zone.  But they<br/>
thought<br/>
&gt; &gt;they were just good or lucky for all surviving that time and I didn&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; &gt;to try explaining to them what I did, so I just camped!  Got me a little<br/>
&gt; &gt;irritated, just the remark that Jig was making them regenerate slower!?<br/>
&gt; OO,<br/>
&gt; &gt;that&#39;s what got me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;All I know--these folks were hostile towards bards, and the fellow who<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt;the leader had to flee so I only met him briefly, perhaps he understood<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; &gt;usefulness better.  When I hit a bad group I don&#39;t stick around, so I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;with them maybe ten minutes tops, but perhaps I can&#39;t fault them from<br/>
&gt; &gt;experiences I&#39;ve had with fellow bard&#39;s I&#39;ve grouped with--some bards<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, this class takes some skill to wield with<br/>
&gt; &gt;finesse.  I was with a bard once who consistently played hymn when all<br/>
&gt; &gt;health was full, and only used bellow in battle.  That, now that, got me<br/>
&gt; &gt;irritated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Er, back to my original question about Jig and Mana, sorry.  Has anyone<br/>
&gt; done<br/>
&gt; &gt;any definitive tests on this?  With all my bard songs I have been able to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;play around&quot; with them enough, to my satisfaction, to understand O how<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt;work.  This is the way I like things, dead reckonings hands-on kind of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;feel&quot; for how they work rather than really writing up numbers myself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thing is, I studied way too much experimental methodology in school to<br/>
&gt; &gt;really enjoy doing it when I&#39;m playing, heheh.  (Memories of torturing<br/>
lab<br/>
&gt; &gt;rats!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;But I have no way to get an instinctive feel for this!  DOES mana<br/>
&gt; regenerate<br/>
&gt; &gt;faster with Jig or not?  Anyone really use a stopwatch with a buddy?  My<br/>
&gt; &gt;friends keep telling me they don&#39;t have stopwatches and have no time for<br/>
&gt; &gt;testing.  I know it doesn&#39;t make regeneration slower, that cleric tonight<br/>
&gt; &gt;was just an arse, but I saved him anyway, fool didn&#39;t even realize it.<br/>
