<div id="ygrps-yiv-390298647">Okay, my opinion on this.  Last night I died on the 3rd level of<br/>
Befallen... I didn&#39;t see the hole in the floor... well, to make a long story<br/>
short, many people offered to help and all they did is train monsters into<br/>
the room at the bottom of the hole (I was going to corpse train my corpse<br/>
back to that room and then die, then /corpse it up through the hole on my<br/>
next trip).  Even some high level person offered to help and then he took<br/>
off and never came back.  Needless to say, I was FRUSTRATED.  No one in my<br/>
guild (The Freeport Raiders), save one of the paladins, could help me and<br/>
Befallen seemed to be full of idiots that day.  He suggested that I ask some<br/>
Guide that &quot;happened&quot; to be in Befallen on one of his/her non-Guide<br/>
characters for help.  I guess I didn&#39;t realize that that same person was<br/>
shouting that he would help people retrieve their corpses if they met him at<br/>
the well, needless to say that I kept shouting back that my corpse wasn&#39;t at<br/>
the bottom of the well. &gt;:D  Silly me.  Anyways, on my FOURTH trek to (DAMN!<br/>
McNichols&#39; arena had a power outage during the Detroit/Colorado NHL playoff<br/>
game! HAHA!) Befallen I was summoned and when the area load was done, there<br/>
I was standing in front of him next to the well, with my corpse at my feet.<br/>

&gt; 1. Either you were rude in your /petition<br/>
&gt; 2. You tried this when there weren&#39;t as many guides in the game<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Few weeks ago I saw a low-mid level fellow resurrected by a guide outside<br/>
&gt; the minotaur cave within the hour of his death, around 1 AM EST.<br/>
&gt; I had been<br/>
&gt; the one who suggested he /petition, and told him to phrase it somewhere<br/>
&gt; along the lines of, &quot;A bug where I was charmed through a wall caused me to<br/>
&gt; die and now I cannot get my corpse.&quot;  Important to have the word &quot;bug&quot; in<br/>
&gt; there somewhere, I told him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is not ridiculous, you will get help.  Now, if one phrased a petition<br/>
&gt; something like, &quot;Stupid game got me killed. Get me my corpse now,&quot; there<br/>
&gt; likely will be no assistance.  Not implying you petitioned this<br/>
&gt; way, Mully,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m certain many do.  Time shouldn&#39;t matter too much, believe Guides<br/>
&gt; play at all hours like anybody else. </span></blockquote></div>
