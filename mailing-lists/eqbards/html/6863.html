&gt; He is absolutely right.  For those thinking of trying Begging who have <br/>
 </span></blockquote>not yet done so, there is a (very small) possibility of dismal failure <br/>
(which I believe is related to charisma/begging skill/faction/race), at <br/>
which point they WILL try to kill you.  I recommend practicing only <br/>
near Zone boundaries or from NPCs where you are sure that there are <br/>
no networked NPCs between you and the Zone point.  <br/>
<br/>
I made the mistake in Rivervale of Begging from an isolated guard on the <br/>
theory that I could run from him.  By the time I (almost) made it to the <br/>
Zone, there were six of them pounding me.  (How humiliating - taken down <br/>
by a six-pack of half-pints!)<br/>
<br/>
I think the monster attacks Kim saw were coincidence.  If they were mad <br/>
at HIM, they would have tried to kill him.  The dismal failure rate is <br/>
low (maybe one in fifty) even at very low Begging levels.</div>
