<div id="ygrps-yiv-322065360"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My group had just finished off some goblins, taking some <br/>
&gt;damage, so I was singing healing at the point when the main <br/>
&gt;group pulled two Ice Giants by accident.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was in the primary group leading the attack.  Those two<br/>
ice giants weren&#39;t the accident, the other two that followed<br/>
and the 3 giant spiders were the accident.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

&gt;than ANY of the other players that this caused the Giant to get <br/>
&gt;ticked at me.  This is just the life of a Bard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll willing to venture I had one of the highest charisma there<br/>
(with buffs) at around 150 - 160.  I got belted good too, but<br/>
tanks taunted very well to keep extras off me.  However I did<br/>
watch several giants B-line for many of you guys who were back<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I went down fighting; our evac druid was dead and me and a ranger<br/>
stood back to back slashing until the end.  One ice giant, one<br/>
ice giant priest, and two giant spiders eventually overwhelmed<br/>
me.  I couldn&#39;t get AE Fear off because the combined damage from<br/>
those monsters killed me in less than 5 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened about 30 minutes later as well, but<br/>
this second evac was a complete success as Screech feared almost<br/>
everything in that room without resist.  No deaths in a no win<br/>
situation, I like those odds.  Screech is definitely the &#39;Divine<br/>
Aura&#39; of the Bard world.<br/>
