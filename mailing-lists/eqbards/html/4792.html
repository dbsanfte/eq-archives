 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s one other factor that&#39;s under your control.  If you<br/>
bought a winmodem because it was cheaper, you may want to go<br/>
buy a real modem.  Winmodems use the computer&#39;s CPU for the<br/>
analog-to-digital and vice versa conversions.  That leaves<br/>
fewer CPU cycles for the game graphics, and it introduces<br/>
about 100-200 ms of lag.  Both of these will kill your ability<br/>
to switch songs.<br/>

Another thing I noticed is that oddly enough, with a Voodoo3<br/>
card, the refresh rate is faster using DirectX than using<br/>
glide.<br/>
