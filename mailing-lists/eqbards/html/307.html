<b>Subject:</b> Re: Kiting - Is it bad? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712419118">I&#39;ve been reading the messages about kiting but I have never done it. As of<br/>
yet, I don&#39;t really have strong enough songs to perform it effectively.<br/>
My question is: why is it an exploit? Certain songs/spells have a ranged or<br/>
radius effect. What if I&#39;m out singing (don&#39;t have a lute or mandolin yet)<br/>
the Chords of Discord (hurts my throat) and killing beasties. While looting<br/>
a corpse I&#39;m set upon by a beastie that I feel is too tough for me. I begin<br/>
to run from it. Getting lost, I run around in circles reading messages that<br/>
the beastie winces and I occasionally take damage. Let&#39;s say that I<br/>
accidentally kill the beastie before it kills me.<br/>
Have I exploited a bug or not? I was running away the entire time. Is it my<br/>
fault that the beastie is so enraged it will follow me to the ends of<br/>
Norrath (or the nearest zone wall)? If this is exploiting a bug, what is<br/>
the bug? Is the bug the fact that I have a song that can damage beasties at<br/>
range or that I can run as fast or faster than some or that beasties chase<br/>
you?<br/>
What if I had a missle weapon and was singing Selo&#39;s Accelerando. Running<br/>
backwards, I am faster than some beasties. By throwing daggers or axes at<br/>
them I stay out of range and they take damage. Taking damage they will<br/>
continue to follow me in which case, I will continue to lob whatever I can<br/>
at them. Is this exploiting a bug? It seems like the same situation, but is<br/>
now OK.<br/>
I am confused and a little scared. Who decides where the fine line between<br/>
clever and exploitation is? I fear to try new things only to discover that<br/>
I&#39;ve &#39;cheated&#39; and will now be banned.<br/>

&gt;Kiting is an &quot;exploit,&quot; apparently, officially.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Read the new Guide section on the offical website.<br/>

&gt;Check this quote about exploits:<br/>
&gt;Farming - using broken spells or specific spell effects to kill, drag, or<br/>
&gt;lure monsters, thus gaining experience/loot from them. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Boom.  Right there, they are looking for that kind of business.  Don&#39;t do<br/>
&gt;it. <br/>
