<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564874480">I grant that it may be far-fetched to expect Verant to take it into<br/>
consideration when it comes to the bind policy, but the actual events have<br/>
happened to me on so many occasions since I&#39;ve been playing that I&#39;ve lost<br/>
count.  When it happens now, I don&#39;t even worry about it anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
I still stand by what I said in regards to the dynamic of pickup groups.<br/>
Unless I am doing something with my guild, almost every time I log on I end<br/>
up in a pickup group.  That&#39;s not my choice but something I just have to<br/>
deal with based on where I live and the fact that my wife doesn&#39;t let me<br/>
play that much during peak hours :-).  For the most part, the people I<br/>
grouped with last month are now several levels higher than me.  If I want to<br/>
group with people around my level, I have to find new people that I haven&#39;t<br/>
grouped with before.  This ends up being a continuous cycle.  I&#39;ve gotten to<br/>
know a lot of good players since April but have never gotten the enjoyment<br/>
of adventuring with a group of core players, which IMO is the best way to<br/>
ensure overall group success.  <br/>
<br/>
One last thing on your #2 comment below.  If I know the people in my group<br/>
are honorable,  I&#39;ll /consent someone to pull my corpse to the zone if I<br/>
die.  But if I&#39;m in a pickup group with players I&#39;ve never grouped before,<br/>
I&#39;m very hesistant to /consent someone to pull my corpse.  I&#39;ve read to many<br/>
horror stories about people getting screwed by dishonest players.    <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; This is a far fetched example, consider everything you are saying:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  People I group with I don&#39;t know/they look out for themselves.<br/>
&gt; 2.  I don&#39;t group with a cleric that can res me.<br/>
&gt; 3.  I am bound &quot;far away&quot;.<br/>
&gt; 4.  I die late at night when the group is close to breaking up anyway,<br/>
&gt;     and the group will abandon me.<br/>
&gt; 5.  I die in a dungeon, not near a zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have 5 strikes here, I don&#39;t think Verant should have to consider<br/>
&gt; such bad luck.  People don&#39;t seem to realize that the &quot;difficulty to get<br/>
&gt; back&quot; factor should count into how you play an area.  In outside zones<br/>
&gt; or in areas close to a zone, I know my groups usually play it pretty risky<br/>
&gt; because we know we can all run away easily.  When we are in the king <br/>
&gt; room of LGuk, we are dang careful we never have to evac.  Why are we so<br/>
&gt; careful?  For us, its not the time to get back to the zone, its the time<br/>
&gt; to clear our way back into the king room.  We as a group will accept<br/>
&gt; less xp, fewer kills in return for some added safety.  I&#39;ve made<br/>
&gt; it a point never to group deep in/with strangers...  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Yes I know the king room and the quick exit, there is no need to<br/>
&gt; evac, I used a bad example, blah blah blah)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; that in pickup groups, players tend to look out for themselves before<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering the welfare of the party.  To add salt to the wound, the<br/>
&gt; problem is<br/>
&gt; &gt; magnified because of the time I usually log on.  I live in Hawaii so<br/>
&gt; when I play<br/>
&gt; &gt; its usually after midnight on the mainland on weeknights.  When a pull<br/>
&gt; turns bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; and someone dies,  especially if it is a melee class bound in a zone far<br/>
&gt; away,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the party usually either breaks up because its so late at night or the<br/>
&gt; casters<br/>
&gt; &gt; leave the group because it will take the melee class too long to get<br/>
&gt; back to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; zone they died in.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think its safe to say that Verant doesn&#39;t take situations like this<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; consideration when they have the mythical class balance tuning sessions.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think they just assume everyone has a regular group/guild that they play<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the time and as a result they are focused on group welfare vs<br/>
&gt; personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; welfare.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If the casters in your group gate out and leave you to die, they are<br/>
&gt; not good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; groupies.<br/>
