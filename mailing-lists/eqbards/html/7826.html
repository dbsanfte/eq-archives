&gt;Subject: Re: Binding or not...<br/>
&gt;&gt;I will be bold and say that well if you really feel the<br/>
&gt;&gt;need to be able to be bound anywhere, play a class that<br/>
&gt;&gt;can bind. If you cant live without the bind spell, then a<br/>
&gt;&gt;bard, warrior, ranger, shadowknight, paladin, rogue is<br/>
&gt;&gt;properly not your kind of class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Great, just what we need a bunch of pansy wizards and wimpy<br/>
&gt;druids running around.  By making a comment like the one<br/>
&gt;above, you alienate 50% of the players of the game.  This<br/>
&gt;is not the intention on a company who would like to make<br/>
&gt;money.  Last time I saw a party without a melee player, they<br/>
&gt;littered the floor of SolB, dead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry I really dont get that one? You say that EVERYONE wants to play a class<br/>
that can bind?<br/>
I&#39;m just saying that if bind is so important for YOU to have fun. Then maybe<br/>
bard is not your class?<br/>
As stated a gazillion times. I dont mind living without bind, and Im not the<br/>
fingerwiggling type anyways.<br/>
The things that could move me away from melee classes is if they get useless in<br/>
group combat.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Let us morons who dont mind running the 1208402 (or 2-3<br/>
&gt;&gt;which is much more common) zones to get our corpse play<br/>
&gt;&gt;the other classes. I still think that I can get to almost<br/>
&gt;&gt;any zone within a reasonble amount of time<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hate to say this, but you&#39;ve misspoken.  Gain some levels and<br/>
&gt;graduate from Blackburrow.  We had to Succor to North Karana<br/>
&gt;3 f&#39;ing times the other night.  It&#39;s a MINIMUM 10 min run<br/>
&gt;back to Permafrost.  But the casters just personal gated<br/>
&gt;right back into the action.  It doesn&#39;t always have to do<br/>
&gt;with corpse recovery.  I was bound in Halas, and _still_ had<br/>
&gt;a long walk ahead of me.   I am the fasting moving thing in<br/>
&gt;Norrath save two things, bards higher than me and SoN.<br/>
<br/>

when I last hunted in BlackBurrow, I am currently hunting in permafrost too ya<br/>
know!<br/>
<br/>
Well groupteleporting to NK saved your life though, right? IMO it sounds ok,<br/>
thay you had a penalty for doing it. As for the casters gating back to their<br/>
bind point... Well as mentioned above. If its that much a pain to you then play<br/>
a fingerwiggler? Every class cant do everything.<br/>
<br/>
I am bound in Halas and the run to Perma is like 2-5mins excluding re-meming of<br/>
songs. Now with my Troll Shadowknight I would proberly have some trouble getting<br/>
bound in Halas and a bind in Qeynos could be the only way. Then the 10mins run<br/>
is more likely, but that is the penalty I have to pay for being so evil and<br/>
trying to make it in a &quot;good&quot; area.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s completely idiotic that I cannot be bound anywhere a<br/>
&gt;caster will bind me.  You don&#39;t need a popup box, because<br/>
&gt;you already have to be in a group with the person.  How can<br/>
&gt;someone maliciously bind me unless I group with them?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m tired of running from Arena to Guk, and running from<br/>
&gt;North Karana to Permafrost when all my other group members<br/>
&gt;are either 1) waiting for us melee folk  2) blasting up<br/>
&gt;monsters left and right, gaining exp/loot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It ruins my night.  And as it ruins more and more people&#39;s<br/>
&gt;fun, you will most likely see this change - count on it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aye, I never said that it wouldent change, just that I dident feel the way you<br/>
did about the issue.<br/>
Well if it do I will get bound where the rest of my party is bound, why<br/>
shouldent I.<br/>
If youre right and all people will get tired of the lack of bindspots and<br/>
starting to choose the caster classes over melee because of the bind spells.<br/>
Then<br/>
its a balance issue and something needs to be done to improve the melee classes.<br/>
As it is now I think there still is some compelling reasons to choose a melee<br/>
class.<br/>
I guess only time will tell which way it goes. You can argue for your view and I<br/>
will do the same with mine, but I doubt that we can agree as things are now.<br/>
