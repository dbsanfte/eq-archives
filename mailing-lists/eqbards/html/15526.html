 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t thrash while zoning.  Immediately after you zone<br/>
and start turning, the game loads (I&#39;m guessing) zone info to<br/>
draw buildings and terrain in your field of view.  It hits the<br/>
disk then.  I suspect having a slower hard disk (mine is 7200<br/>
rpm with a 6ms seek time) may actually be an advantage when<br/>
this happens, as the CPU isn&#39;t as tied up handling the data<br/>
from the disk.<br/>
<br/>
It also happens when I go to the FP bank.  From the area where<br/>
the jeweler and cleric&#39;s guild are, you have to go through a<br/>
series of sharp turns to get to the bank area.  I usually end<br/>
up doing a 180 on that first turn, as the game loads in the<br/>
info for the buildings in the new area.<br/>
