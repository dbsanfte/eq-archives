&gt; Even singing it, if you don&#39;t understand the fundamentals of brass notes,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll have a hard time with that Discord.  (And it&#39;s MUCH more effective<br/>
&gt; with an instrument anyway, don&#39;t bother singing it)  It&#39;s a strangely<br/>
&gt; fitting first song for bards to learn their brass skills with.  The whole<br/>
&gt; point of the &quot;song&quot; is to make a deafening racket, something easy to do<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; you can hardily play a horn!<br/>
