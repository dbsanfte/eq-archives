<div id="ygrps-yiv-411732399">I guess this is a subject that will continue to pop up periodically as long<br/>
as this list is around.  Once again, the level 3 song Jaxan&#39;s Vigor has<br/>
absolutely no impact on mana regeneration.  This issue was answered by JM<br/>
Capozzi, a Verant employee, who used to post on this list.  The song<br/>
apparently increases the screen refresh rate on the mana bar but the actual<br/>
amount of mana regenerated over time is always the same.  All it does is<br/>
create the illusion that mana is regenerating faster.   <br/>
