<div id="ygrps-yiv-614081617">Ya and don&#39;t be picking on list newbies either! &quot;Welcome!! by the way!&quot; Go<br/>
whine to that other guy who said &quot;32k&#39;d&quot; about using jargon!  <br/>
<br/>
I got enough small bronze in the Torture Chamber room (first basement room)<br/>
of Unrest last nite to fully equip a char.  Some times it just rains bronze!<br/>
Actually, I master ninja loot for our regular party (gods, I love saying<br/>
those words: regular party!) and gave it all to our cleric.  Reagents are<br/>
not cheap you know!<br/>
<br/>
Wanna hear something funny?  A lev 36 enchanter was asking to join our party<br/>
and we kept saying &quot;sorry - our stuff prolly too green for you and we are<br/>
doing just fine and NO we will not come camp the Ghost with you.&quot;  Well<br/>
finally he stands there and says: &quot;Unless you invite me and camp the ghost,<br/>
you are going to get a lot of trains on you.&quot;  Hehe was this a threat or was<br/>
he just saying he needed our help?  Hard to know when English is not always<br/>
the common tongue.  Anyways, we were all lo 30&#39;s except our cleric who<br/>
dinged into 34.  And we did see a bunch of trains!  Which actually turned<br/>
out to be kinda nice way to fill in the dead spots between spawns (sorry, no<br/>
pun intended! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

p.s. BIG THANKS!!! To Kalvidar - the super bard!  He gave me a spare MM<br/>
drum! Woo Hoo!  Big thanks to Lyly who gave it to him to pass on to a very<br/>
lucky bard - as it turns out: me!!!<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. MM = MistMoore - ok!<br/>
