&gt; Aside from a few spots in kedge you can&#39;t really just go to a spot with a<br/>
&gt; group and camp there. you need mutiple groups, and you go through and &quot;do&quot;<br/>
&gt; the dungeon. My guess is that most if not all dungeons will be like this<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All I can say is that you obviously have no idea how to use charm<br/>
effectively in a dungeon.  I _frequently_ use charm in lower guk if things<br/>
get out of hand and we get 1 or 2 too many monsters attacking us.  I simply<br/>
step out of the fight, charm one and have it attack another un-engaged mob.<br/>
<br/>
This ties up 2 NPC&#39;s while the party deals with the rest.  If we have an<br/>
enchanter I dont need to worry about it as much but it&#39;s still a VERY useful<br/>
tactic.   However, it&#39;s a VERY useful tactic that GOES AWAY once the NPC&#39;s<br/>
we fight are over level 37.  Bet your ass I want charm upgraded.  It&#39;s FAR<br/>
more powerful outdoors but then again there are 26 new zones going in in the<br/>
kunark expansion.  MANY will be outdoor zones.  So even THAT aspect of Charm<br/>
will still be useful.<br/>
<br/>
I really hate it when a bard who hasn&#39;t explored all the uses for the more<br/>
powerful songs we get disses one as &quot;it&#39;s not useful&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll state rather bluntly that there isn&#39;t a single song in our lineup<br/>
(except maybe the Chant series and some of the psalms) that I don&#39;t/haven&#39;t<br/>
_needed_ to use at one point or another.  They&#39;re all useful.  Sure some<br/>
more than others.<br/>
<br/>
And NO, I DONT want form over function.  I don&#39;t really care if my song<br/>
LOOKS cool.  I want it to be something I can USE.<br/>
<br/>
OOOO FLASHY LIGHTS<br/>
<br/>
umm no offense... who needs the light show if it doesn&#39;t make me more<br/>
effective in the team?</div>
