<b>Subject:</b> RE: &lt;-------idiot <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284534902">Well, I did report it and was told there was nothing that could be (or would<br/>
be) done about the situation.  However, at the end of the night, the gm<br/>
finally asked that I write her an email explaining the situation.  Hopefully<br/>
that will help matters.<br/>
<br/>
The character who actually stole it was Razel, although he said it was his<br/>
&quot;friend&quot; Bonewalker who was playing Razel and stole the items.  I am told<br/>
that Razel is actually a good guy and was taken advantage of as well but I<br/>
just don&#39;t know what to believe.   <br/>
<br/>
The funniest part of the story is that Razel actually gave a friend of mine<br/>
all his druid items for me to hold as collateral.  However, when my friend<br/>
tried to trade them to me, one of the items was a full LIght Burlap Sack<br/>
(which is lore).  When we hit trade, the items in the bag and the bag itself<br/>
poofed.  And of course the gms won&#39;t believe this either - they say my<br/>
friend kept the items but I know he did not.    So, now I will have to<br/>
replace all this guys items as well.  I&#39;m told that there is a fairly well<br/>
known bug with lore containers poofing but I did not have any knowledge of<br/>
that before...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks for the support friends :)<br/>

Agreed, report this now and don&#39;t stop until you get an answer.  There is an<br/>
old saying that I think applies here:<br/>
<br/>
Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.<br/>
<br/>
You are no idiot for trusting someone you could not have known could not be<br/>
trusted.  I sad lesson to learn but it seems that your perspective is such<br/>
that you will have learned from the situation without allowing it to harden<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and please keep us posted, also, what was this persons char name?<br/>
It needs to be posted to all the message boards.<br/>

&gt; Ack, I am very sorry to hear your misfortune.<br/>
&gt; Now, this is the type of person I am but I would be really <br/>
&gt; pissed right<br/>
&gt; now, you should report this person to a GM, I am sure <br/>
&gt; something can be done<br/>
&gt; because I remember reading a post on www.everquest.com about <br/>
&gt; a guy who was<br/>
&gt; given consent, looted the corpse and then logged, he posted <br/>
&gt; saying that his<br/>
&gt; brother wanted to play, well anyway, the gm&#39;s banned his <br/>
&gt; account, he then<br/>
&gt; logged onto his brother account and got that one banned, he <br/>
&gt; then continued<br/>
&gt; to get another brothers account banned. The GM&#39;s also got the <br/>
&gt; equipment<br/>
&gt; back for this unfortunate person who had it stolen from him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go report this person NOW. He deserves all he gets for being <br/>
&gt; such an ass<br/>
&gt; hole.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, rant over. Goodluck, I hope you get your stuff back.<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I just wanted to tell you a little tale so that you can <br/>
&gt; all remember<br/>
&gt; not to make my mistakes.  Last night, I made the mistake of consenting<br/>
&gt; someone to drag Tani&#39;s corpse out of the Scryer room in Guk.  <br/>
&gt; Well, long<br/>
&gt; story short, all my armor and weapons were stolen (punishment <br/>
&gt; for twinking,<br/>
&gt; heh) by this guy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are all sorts of complicating sidelines to this story which I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; spare<br/>
&gt; you.  Although I know it was always a risk, I just never <br/>
&gt; thought someone<br/>
&gt; would be so mean and viscious.  The items are just items, but <br/>
&gt; people that<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; that stuff just plain suck!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Guess I&#39;ll have to make a contest to see how much of my quest <br/>
&gt; stuff I can<br/>
&gt; get back in one week.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope you&#39;re all having a great day... and DON&#39;T CONSENT <br/>
&gt; SOMEONE YOU DON&#39;T<br/>
&gt; KNOW!!!<br/>
&gt; (most of you have probably figured that out - guess I get to <br/>
&gt; wear the naive<br/>
&gt; banner for the week)<br/>
