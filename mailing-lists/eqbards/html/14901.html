<div id="ygrps-yiv-837645725">Hi there, I&#39;m Hire. 14th level bard on Vallon ZEK! I&#39;m nearing<br/>
the magical L17 and dual wield, and I&#39;m wondering what are the <br/>
most effective weapon? I was thinking of combine longswords <br/>
for a while, but it seems now-adays with my fine steel <br/>
longsword I&#39;m missing 2/3 of my swings anyway (exaggeration<br/>
alert!). Recently switched to a fine steel short and even <br/>
though I went from 12 dmg per round to 8, I&#39;m missing a lot<br/>
less. There is obviously a balance to be reached, so my question<br/>
is .. high delay : high damage? Or vice versa?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and interrupting casters is of obvious importance. ;-)<br/>

P.P.S. Come join us on Vallon, its fun! (And we need the help!)</div>
