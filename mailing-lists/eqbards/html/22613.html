<b>Subject:</b> Hymn/Mana song macro, Macros in general and 20&#39;s <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731829329">Here is what I do:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 2, /stopsong<br/>
/pause 30, /cast &lt;heal&gt;<br/>
/pause 2, /stopsong<br/>
/cast &lt;clarity&gt;<br/>
/e sings a soothing tune<br/>
<br/>
I put stopsong at the beginning so the macro kills any song currently being<br/>
sung(too lazy to stop current song).  And I just let clarity keep singing at<br/>
end of macro in case I forget to restart the macro or in case I go afk -<br/>
clarity keeps going which I am more concerned about during downtime.  <br/>
<br/>
In general, I don&#39;t like long macros - once one starts, it must finish<br/>
before you can sing a different song.  Maybe we should ask for an interrupt<br/>
command like /stopmacro to be able to stop a longer twist to get at the song<br/>
you really need NOW(i.e., mob pops and starts beating on medding cleric -<br/>
you want to charm it off them and can&#39;t since you just started the downtime<br/>
macro).  So, my normal macros during a fight are:<br/>
<br/>
/pause 2, /stopsong<br/>
/cast &lt;song you want&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I then time it(based on current lag) to hit next macro for the next song<br/>
which stops the current song and starts the next.  It saves you one<br/>
keystroke as you don&#39;t have to stop any songs if you create a similar macro<br/>
for each slot.  So in a normal fight, I hit half as many hotkeys now and I<br/>
don&#39;t get the &quot;you have not recovered&quot; message anymore since I no longer can<br/>
jump the gun on starting the next song after I stopped the previous.  Also,<br/>
if you miss a note, you don&#39;t have to wait to restart the macro as there is<br/>
no pause after song casting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for that where to go in 20&#39;s question - definitely Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
It will take you to charm at 27 and beyond.  My favorite charm target there<br/>
- Sabertooth Grimalkin, but you will test it out for yourself one day....<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
My two cents,<br/>

PS - I just reread this and while I understand it, it is confusing with all<br/>
the stops/nexts/etc.  Sorry.  Hope it helps.</div>
