<div id="ygrps-yiv-447604869">Heh..I&#39;m pretty much in the same boat.  The more I play, the longer it takes<br/>
to level, the harder it is to get level appropriate stuff...and I play about<br/>
2-3 nights a week, normally.  This week however, I haven&#39;t even turned on<br/>
the gaming machine.<br/>
<br/>
I keep trying other games and demos...all it will take is the one to catch<br/>
my interest like EQ did.  Problem is, none are doing it.<br/>

Its not sour-grapes so much as what the contest is about.  Look at the<br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
The contest will find the &quot;best&quot; according to what EQ rewards in achievement<br/>
(as detailed in your response - time,guild,organization,gear that is<br/>
rightful result of those three).  I won&#39;t argue its hard - the endgame<br/>
demands so much I had to just plain quit.  I enjoyed EQ - but I can&#39;t devote<br/>
the time it takes to do the endgame well.  I tried with two different<br/>
classes to be sure ... and this is long enough ago its all water under the<br/>
bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I could figure out what the contest does to choose the better<br/>
&quot;Bard&quot;. ;)<br/>
<br/>
The contest is a fanstastic reward for all those who are playing to win, and<br/>
have the time and resources to do so.<br/>
<br/>
The contests are totally without meaning to people who either play to have<br/>
fun or have limited time available to pursue the game.<br/>
<br/>
You also can&#39;t convince me that with those rules it will find the better<br/>
&quot;Bard&quot;.  It will find the Bard with the best in-game resources.  Since, as<br/>
you correctly point out, gathering those resources takes a herculean<br/>
effort - winning the contest will certainly mean something to the person who<br/>
does, and his/her backers.  However, it won&#39;t infuse any meaning into the<br/>
contest for the rest of us either.<br/>

First off, other bards have the same weps - one other bard that I personally<br/>
know of does.  I would guess that others do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snipped the rest of message to spare those that get this on long digest&gt;<br/>
