get my revenge, is<br/>

<br/>
		I&#39;m pretty sure she is aligned with the cutthroat dervishes.<br/>
		Yes, all those messages you ignored saying &quot;Your faction<br/>
with<br/>
		the Cutthroat Dervishes got worse&quot; has a consequence.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
		I&#39;m still trying to figure out what the faction connection<br/>
is<br/>
		with the merchant in the first building on the right as you<br/>
		enter East Commonlands from Freeport.  She stopped selling<br/>
to<br/>
		me long before I ever met dervishes.<br/>

		Kill her and find out &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
