		Yes, all those messages you ignored saying &quot;Your faction<br/>

		the Cutthroat Dervishes got worse&quot; has a consequence.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
		I&#39;m still trying to figure out what the faction connection<br/>
is<br/>

		enter East Commonlands from Freeport.  She stopped selling<br/>
to<br/>
