<div id="ygrps-yiv-612638012">I&#39;m not saying you don&#39;t die I&#39;m saying you don&#39;t die near as often and if you do there are so many more ways to get back quickly at high levels not to mention you can also avoid death a lot easier. I also play a Necromancer and with Journeyman Boots I basically never die for the most part. I died twice yesterday before that it had been over two weeks before my last death. All I&#39;m saying is that the bind issue is not that big of a deal especially at high levels.<br/>
