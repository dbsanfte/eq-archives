<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-72322373">Hi everyone!!<br/>
<br/>
Just a quickie, since I&#39;ve spent all my remaining cash on buying some<br/>
Lambent armour (even though I think I got a really fantastic deal<br/>
hehe) I&#39;m looking to finish off the set so I can at least say I&#39;ve<br/>
completed it!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy at finding just about all the bits and pieces to make the<br/>
last few parts, but I&#39;m just not sure where or how tough the Solusek<br/>
bits are.  Playing at the more quiet times it&#39;s difficult to find<br/>
anyone at all inside there when I&#39;m on so I&#39;ve got no knowledge!<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone gimme a few hints about where and how tough the Solusek<br/>
Mage and the Solusek Champion are.  An opinion of how frequent the<br/>
spawn and drops are would be helpful too ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks muchly!<br/>
<br/>
PS Hi to Shada, who I met in person last night while on my first Hill<br/>
Giant hunting trip!  My heroine *sigh*<br/>
