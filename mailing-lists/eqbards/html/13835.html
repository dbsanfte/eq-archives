<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764831308"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My take on this is that these two instuments will only be discovered if<br/>

<br/>
  Merchants cannot be considered, as they poof on death.<br/>
<br/>
  However, three people were carrying lutes, and one a flute/drum.<br/>
<br/>
  I forget the spelling of the names (silly bard that I am) but<br/>
  the guildmaster had a lute (L50), Clay had the flute/drum (green), <br/>
  the female watchperson had a lute (blue), the trainer outside<br/>
  had a lute too.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m probably going to get the more evil half of the guild to<br/>
  attempt to break-in and rock the bard guild house.  See what<br/>
  turns up.  Has anyone done this yet?  I know it was suggested<br/>
  by someone else a while back.<br/>
