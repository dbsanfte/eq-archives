&gt; I beginning to think there should be a level check on a critter when he dies<br/>
&gt; that his corpse disappears immediately if your level is more than a certain<br/>
&gt; amount greater than the mob.  I was vehemently against this idea when it was<br/>
&gt; initially proposed by Verant.  Its better than making everything &#39;no drop&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about this. There&#39;s a ton of problems with this and it<br/>
would require changes Verant won&#39;t want to make. For one, they&#39;d have to<br/>
rethink their current &quot;everything about L18 attacks&quot; setup. If I&#39;m going<br/>
to have to fight green mobs 32 levels below mine, I better at least get<br/>
loot from them, no matter how pitiful. As well, what about necros<br/>
hunting for bone chips or druids hunting for bat wings?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the way it is becoming now.  This would chase away some of the higher levels<br/>
&gt; from lower level events however.  I think cutting it off at the xp gaining<br/>
&gt; point would be too tight though, get 4 mobs on me that are just barely too<br/>
&gt; green to give xp and I may still be in trouble depending on the zone.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s nothing I hate more than killing a new mob, only to find a cool item<br/>
&gt; for a monk or caster that is &#39;no drop&#39;.  Normally I could give it away or<br/>
&gt; sell it to a guildmember, making it &#39;no drop&#39; just makes it useless.  Quests<br/>
&gt; are becoming especially true for this.  Do a quest and get an item you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use.  If this is supposed to make us do quests that are for our class only<br/>
&gt; then it sucks even worse as there are many monk and paladin quests but<br/>
&gt; nearly no bard quests.  &#39;No Drop&#39; is no solution its merely a crutch used to<br/>
&gt; avoid a real solution.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally I also hate letting items go to waste, but it at least fits<br/>
in with Verant&#39;s appearant philosophy of keeping items rare by any means<br/>
possible. If they didn&#39;t have the items no drop, they&#39;d probably cut the<br/>
spawn of items even more to assure that everyone didn&#39;t have one.<br/>
