a 30 year career dealing with programming and programming tools and bug<br/>

on its terms.<br/>

If I can&#39;t treat the negative effects of a software bug as if I&#39;d, say,<br/>
been washed overboard by an errant wave, then I&#39;ll pack it in as far as<br/>
game playing is concerned and expect Verant to bail me out.  The idea of<br/>
observing the sun for direction, having a sense of where you are overall,<br/>
and swimming for an island to me is playing the game for all it&#39;s worth, no<br/>
excuses.<br/>
