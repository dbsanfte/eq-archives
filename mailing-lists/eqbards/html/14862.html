&gt; It&#39;s far easier to test it on level 1 mobs that can&#39;t double<br/>
&gt; attack.  Just let it beat on you, chain/torgors it, and time<br/>
&gt; how long it takes between hits.  Or duel a shaman/enchanter<br/>
&gt; and time your own swings.<br/>
<br/>

  them, so your health bar will be the indicator of success ;-)<br/>

  Ice giants don&#39;t take their time swinging either.  It definitely<br/>
  doesn&#39;t feel like 3.0 seconds between swings.  They are some of the<br/>
  fastest attackers (maybe perceptively) around since they theorectically<br/>
  are of level where you will see possible quadruple attacks.<br/>
<br/>
  I can easily last twice to three times as long in toe to toe against<br/>
  an ice giant with togors on it.  It would be obvious after chains<br/>
  wore off (and didn&#39;t effect togors) if my survivability was still<br/>
  intact.  Snakes don&#39;t offer such challenges, and you then need to<br/>
  resort to logging and timing.  With larger npcs the dmg output will<br/>
  be noticably different without parsing.<br/>
