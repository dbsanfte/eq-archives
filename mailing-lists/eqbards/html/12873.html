<div id="ygrps-yiv-631027071"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; IMO, the best thing you could possible do is find a good enchanter to make<br/>
&gt; friends with and group with him on a contiuous basis.  Bard and enchanters<br/>
&gt; go together like peas and carrots. <br/>
<br/>

  Harmonic, who wears the pants in his house.  Well until midnight,<br/>
  when she bitches at me for playing for 6 hours and not fixing dinner<br/>
  or cleaning up the place, and not holding her, etc.. etc.. etc...<br/>
