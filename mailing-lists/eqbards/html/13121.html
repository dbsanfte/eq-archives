<div id="ygrps-yiv-132584310">The plan was for 2 attack waves - not all groups to rush in at the same<br/>
time.  Whether that happened or not - hard to say. I am sure everyone was<br/>
very anxious to attack.  If the second wave held back even momentarily, then<br/>
it probably was a big help to preventing a mass LD situation.<br/>

I followed pretty much what everyone here said to do.  The battle<br/>
  was fairly smooth I suppose.  If you call throwing 48 people at a<br/>
  dragon, smooth.  heh.</div>
