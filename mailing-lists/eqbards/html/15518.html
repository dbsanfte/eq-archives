<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126738837">I was at the Event on E&#39;ci, and it was a vast disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
First Mayong showed up.  Some k3wld00ds attacked him, and he slapped them <br/>
away.  He had the elf slave with him (who, it turns out, was a bard) and <br/>
Lord Whatshisname (Garamond?).  Well, some preadolescent killed the slave, <br/>
who was not invulnerable, and was an integral part of the storyline.  After <br/>
that things went downhill.<br/>
<br/>
Mayong stood there for 10 minutes, not moving or saying anything.  Feeling <br/>
full of spunk, and noticing that the event had stalled, I walked up to him, <br/>
/poked him in the chest, and asked him why he crawled out of his hole after <br/>
all this time hiding like the craven worm he is.  He replied with something <br/>
along the lines of &quot;Fear me, child.  I can bring you a fate far worse than <br/>
death.&quot;  I told him he would never understand the valor of good races, and <br/>
said I did not fear death, which was in truth all he had to show.  He paused <br/>
dramatically, then killed me. = )<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyways, after that he went on a rampage, gravity fluxing and pointing <br/>
the Finger of Doom at everyone around.  When the dust settled, he was gone.  <br/>
His assistant, Khasra, led us to the graveyard entry, where she tried to <br/>
tell us the remaining storyline.  A few loudmouthed idiots kept chattering, <br/>
and some folks kept attacking her (and disappearing) until finally she got <br/>
fed up and left for Neriak.<br/>
<br/>
I heard secondhand that Lanys T&#39;vil met with Mayong there, and took a vial <br/>
of his blood to use in some arcane ritual.  Sadly, nobody I spoke to was <br/>
quite sure of the nature of the ritual, only that it involved Veeshan&#39;s Veil <br/>
somehow.<br/>
<br/>
This had the potential to be a great event, but people were bound and <br/>
determined to attack every NPC in sight.  Visions of k3wl l00t obscured the <br/>
dramatic potential of the affair, and only a few people were interested in <br/>
roleplaying or learning anything.  This was obviously part of a long <br/>
evolving storyline, and exactly the kind of event I always wanted to see... <br/>
or it could have been, anyways.<br/>
