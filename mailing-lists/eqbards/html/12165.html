<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847539486">In reality the risks are really based on the quality of your party and I&#39;ve<br/>
been fortunate to have been part of the best.  I was scared to death of<br/>
dungeons and I thought Perma trains had permanently scarred me... but then I<br/>
found a little place I call home... Sol A & B.  I haven&#39;t missed Selo since.<br/>
Only time I leave is to bank money and buy food (I can sell to vendors<br/>
inside the dungeon).  The action and the XP are non-stop and much more<br/>
enjoyable then standing around waiting for some guard to spawn.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
there for 9 levels now and I&#39;ll likely be there for 5 to 6 more (unless I go<br/>
running off to Cazic.  I hear that is great also).  I still have yet to see<br/>
and kill a number of the rare spawns in Sol A and none in Sol B yet.  I&#39;ve<br/>
conquered Kindle, Singe, Predator, Foreman, Drunkard, Bartender, King,<br/>
Torturer, EXG, Efreeti to name a few and have been in groups where the rare<br/>
drop has fallen for each...  Have I died?   A number of times, but I&#39;ve also<br/>
been racking up the rare items, wealth from selling fine steel and lots of<br/>
XP.  No complaints here.  There is nothing outdoors that compares.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wow, I really am beginning to feel like the only person left playing EQ<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t kill druids, treants, guards, dwarves at the docks,<br/>
&gt; gnomes, etc...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Doesn&#39;t anyone care about faction anymore?  Or is it just players don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to take risks anymore...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Only having a 22nd level char as my highest, I may be wrong.. but are the<br/>
&gt; risks worth taking?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now isn&#39;t it a lot more fun using the tools at our disposal to clear a<br/>
&gt; &gt; dungeon then to stand around watching a couple of HG&#39;s beat on<br/>
&gt; each other?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe it is just me...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not just you.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever do that, except to test out<br/>
&gt; charm when (if) I get it. Mind you, I&#39;m not really partial to<br/>
&gt; dungeons, but<br/>
&gt; unfortunately a lot of lambent quest items are in them so I guess<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d better<br/>
&gt; start liking them. :)<br/>
