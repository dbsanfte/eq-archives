 </span></blockquote>Nice social, but I would like to offer one word of caution -- there <br/>
are times when /assist &lt;main assist name&gt; will not return the correct <br/>
target. While I have found these times to be rare, they do happen. <br/>
For this reason, I would separate the social into two.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pet Assist&quot;<br/>
/pet back off<br/>
/assist &lt;main assist name&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pet Attack&quot;<br/>
/pet attack  (or /pet kill)<br/>
/em Charmed pet attacking &lt;&lt; %T &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I always try to take the extra fraction of a second to confirm I have <br/>
the correct target. If you are fighting two different MOBs, you can <br/>
get a pretty good feel by looking at your target box; if you are <br/>
fighting more than one of the same MOB, I try to look and make sure <br/>
the correct name is flashing. Our relationship with enchanters is <br/>
often shaky anyway, the last thing I want to do is break mez on the <br/>
wrong MOB. *Grins*<br/>

Be well,<br/>
