<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193277324">I was in CT today, and heard &quot;Train coming, move it or lose it&quot;. my<br/>
group was just organizing at the tree in the CY, so i popped on Invis,<br/>
and we watched. The warrior who shouted train came the door and had AT<br/>
LEAST 8 lizzies. So it does seem that more will chase you than 4.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, my group got a big kick out of me saying &quot;Hail a silvered lizard&quot;<br/>
and Hail to every other type walking by. that is how we know there were<br/>
at leat 8, they all walked in a nice parade by us. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well I must admit that my speed did indeed cause what several people told me<br/>
&gt; &gt; was &#39;the biggest train in Cazic-Thule that I&#39;ve ever seen&#39;.  A few levels<br/>
&gt; &gt; [...]<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe 15-20 lizards behind me.  Then I hit the maze.  The maze is just that,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I got lost.  While frantically searching for the way out, I&#39;m getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; hit by lizards that I blaze past and picking them up in turn.  Well by the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not really sure this is possible if you&#39;re alone.  If you<br/>
&gt; wade into a 5+ mob camp with your AOE songs going, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; notice only 4 of them will attack you at a time.  The rest<br/>
&gt; will stay where they are and ignore you until one of the mobs<br/>
&gt; attacking you dies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose it could be that if they&#39;re all chasing you, then<br/>
&gt; none of them are attacking you, so all of them can chase<br/>
&gt; you.  I&#39;ll have to try that.<br/>
