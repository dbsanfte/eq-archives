<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984233675">what is exactly wrong with it again?  in the ghoul lord room last night,<br/>
with 2 boks and the lord we decided that i use pixie strike to take one bok<br/>
out of the equation while the lord and other bok were killed.  hell i will<br/>
admit i have not used this song in combat much (worked good in duels)<br/>
because frankly i was never asked to nor has the situation come up much<br/>
where i was in charge of messing.  it took many tries to get the bok messed,<br/>
even though i got no resist messages, but after the first few tries once it<br/>
finally stuck i could sing it repeatedly and keep him messed indefinitely.<br/>
i have very little experience with the song so i am wondering what it is<br/>
that is broken or what i should expect.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Was Pixie Strike not working properly mentioned in the GZ <br/>
&gt; letter?  Are bards<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the capability to sing this song submitting bug <br/>
&gt; reports?  I assume some<br/>
&gt; &gt; of you have.  Perhaps if enough people submit a bug report <br/>
&gt; it will get<br/>
&gt; &gt; fixed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was not in the letter.  I&#39;ve been /bugging it.  Now that<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m hitting the upper level limit for charm, I&#39;m getting more<br/>
&gt; annoyed by it and will probably fire off an email to GZ asking<br/>
&gt; about it at some point.<br/>
