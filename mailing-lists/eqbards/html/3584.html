<div id="ygrps-yiv-580650228">The ultimate use for charm for me is pulling a monster off a tank or wizard<br/>
that&#39;s taking too many hits. My example was my group was camping the tower<br/>
in Unrest (we do this a t 2 am est, with 20 people in the zone trust me we<br/>
aren&#39;t hurting anyone&#39;s spawn) and the knight of unrest spawn. I ate the<br/>
harm touch then backed off, while the cleric was patching me up the knight<br/>
jumped on our caster and a hag and barbed spawned. ack!<br/>
<br/>
Suffice to say, there is nothing more staggering to me then charming the<br/>
Undead Knight of Unrest and ordering him to attack the festering hag. I was<br/>
L27, the Knight was 29th. The duration is short on the song generally, but<br/>
the good thing is if you re-charm it it goes right back to do your last<br/>
command. Since I&#39;ve never played a necro, SK, etc. I didn&#39;t know the pet<br/>
commands until I asked a friend. I&#39;ll list them here for anyone else. I made<br/>
a seperate bank of hot keys for the ones I needed, to be used when charming.<br/>
<br/>
/pet guard me<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
/pet follow me<br/>
/pet guard here<br/>
/pet back off<br/>
<br/>
As John pointed out, at least in Unrest, the charmed pet was doing far more<br/>
damage than me. I charmed a Carrion Ghoul and ordered it to attack a<br/>
werebat. In the first combat round, it did two hits for ~50 each, and in the<br/>
second round it did the same. The CG actually got a hit in each round for<br/>
over 50 points, and a CG has never hit me for over 50 (although I have been<br/>
hit for 50 many times). That&#39;s far better then my Bladed Thulian claw and<br/>
Dirk manage in that short time. Now anyone who has fought a werebat knows<br/>
they are like hitting a rubber blob - they really soak up melee damage. The<br/>
CG came uncharmed in the 3rd round, but recharming it in one pulse put it<br/>
back on track. If your group has a big battle, then this is probably a poor<br/>
song to use. However for this pair it worked great. The CG was actually<br/>
doing so much damage that the werebat ignored the 3 tanks to start beating<br/>
on it, and after all isn&#39;t that what we want?<br/>
<br/>
I have to same I&#39;m a bit guilty, I think it&#39;s alot of fun to have a barbed<br/>
bone or skeletal monk waltzing beside you awaiting orders. The other reason<br/>
I like this song is that when it becomes uncharmed, it WILL attack you. When<br/>
this happened with the Knight, it saved the wizard, and a L27 bard in bronze<br/>
can handle taking the hits from the Knight easily with some backup (and so<br/>
can a L22 bard for that matter).<br/>

&gt; I got to play around with Sirens (level 27) a bit before I<br/>
&gt; lost the level helping a friend recover his corpse.  Only the<br/>
&gt; second time that&#39;s happened, and I&#39;m not particularly careful<br/>
&gt; about this type of thing, so I&#39;m surprised when I hear people<br/>
&gt; who say they&#39;ve lost a level many times.  Anyway, my<br/>
&gt; comments on charming:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Duration is like our other songs - 3 pulses, except being a<br/>
&gt; charm song, it is also random.  So it may last 0.1 seconds, or<br/>
&gt; it may last the full 3 pulses.  Haven&#39;t been able to figure<br/>
&gt; out if charisma makes any difference in this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a wind song, but doesn&#39;t require a wind instrument.  I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t able to notice much difference between using a flute or<br/>
&gt; not.  Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bad song to use in dungeons or in camps.  Stuff that is green<br/>
&gt; and normally will not attack you *will* attack your pet if<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s low enough level.  Very easy to start a low level train<br/>
&gt; this way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s difficult to join the fight since you have to target your<br/>
&gt; pet to re-charm it.  If you recharm it, it seems to continue<br/>
&gt; its last attack order.  When it uncharms, both it *and* the<br/>
&gt; thing it was fighting usually come after you.  Don&#39;t order<br/>
&gt; your pet to attack guards or sand giants.  :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Monsters do a *lot* more damage than this little bard can do.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s kinda nice being able to do double 20-50 point damage,<br/>
&gt; albeit indirectly.  In the proper situation, this song can<br/>
&gt; easily be more effective than wading into combat yourself.<br/>
&gt; This is a very viable strategy for when you&#39;re not<br/>
&gt; participating in combat yourself - you can weave Sirens with<br/>
&gt; Hymn or Rhythms with an instrument equipped.  The only problem<br/>
&gt; I had was that my group had gotten pretty used to me chaining<br/>
&gt; runners.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can use it to take a break from a fight.  If you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; soloing a blue and it&#39;s a close fight, charm it, equip a lute,<br/>
&gt; and weave Hymn and Sirens.  You will heal and the mob will<br/>
&gt; mostly stay charmed.  When you&#39;re comfortably healed, continue<br/>
&gt; the fight.  Be careful of the green-stuff-attacking-pet note<br/>
&gt; above - stuff that you&#39;re not used to having attack you may<br/>
&gt; attack your pet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It works beautifully for stopping kill stealing casters. Since<br/>
&gt; the duration is random, you just keep hitting charm over and<br/>
&gt; over while a melee friend keeps attacking.  His melee attack<br/>
&gt; will go through during the brief windows when the monster<br/>
&gt; becomes uncharmed.  Casters will not be able to anticipate<br/>
&gt; these windows, and if they&#39;re not quick enough they&#39;ll end up<br/>
&gt; casting at a recharmed mob.  Was very nice to turn the tables<br/>
&gt; last night - we got the goblin king despite two casters trying<br/>
&gt; to take him from us after he and his guards had become fixated<br/>
&gt; on our party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It does not work for pulling stuff from camps.  The moment<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s charmed, it becomes your pet, and anything aggressive to<br/>
&gt; you will attack it.  In fact, stuff that normally will not<br/>
&gt; attack you will attack your pet because your pet is lower<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If your pet dies due to other monsters attacking it, its<br/>
&gt; corpse disappears because the majority of the damage was not<br/>
&gt; dealt by a player.  Be careful if you&#39;re using this to charm a<br/>
&gt; mob that carries a nice item.<br/>
