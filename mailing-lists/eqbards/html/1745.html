<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361799607">Well like I said as long as they allow us to wear plate, I&#39;ll not set any<br/>
precedences and be the only bard out there at my level to be poorly armored.<br/>
Aside from the roleplaying aspects (which I must admit I care little about<br/>
and I chose to take a devil&#39;s advocate stance) wearing plate gives others<br/>
the illusion that we are a tank.  I am lv 27 and I cannot solo a carrion<br/>
ghoul in a straight melee fight, full plate or otherwise.  A friend of mine<br/>
is a lv 24 ranger, wearing only chain, that can whoop up on a carrion ghoul,<br/>
using little or no magic.  I give almost the perfect illusion of being a<br/>
tank.  You look at me, you see a wood elf, full plate, dual wielding combine<br/>
longswords.  First thing that comes to mind if you dont happen to see the<br/>
blustering sparkles that pulse around my body every couple seconds is oh,<br/>
there&#39;s a warrior.  If we want to get even deeper into MY opinions (and why<br/>
the hell not eh?) I think we should be double attacking instead of dual<br/>
wielding.  this would allow for much easier transitioning between weapon and<br/>
instrument, and would reinforce the light and airy bard impression that our<br/>
HP already seems to warrent.<br/>
