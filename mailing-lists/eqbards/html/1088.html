<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001421152"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;Is it possible to run through Beholder with Accelerando?  I made the trip<br/>
&gt; &gt;through last weekend crawling along high on the cliff and it was nerve<br/>
&gt; &gt;wracking.  I would much rather make a fast dash through and get it over<br/>
&gt; &gt;with!  But I saw at least a dozen evil eyes from my vantage point on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;cliff wall...can I run past fast enough to avoid trouble?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh.  I make the run through the maze all the time, using Accelerando,<br/>
rarely see any eyes at all.  I just run along the gorge floor, hugging the<br/>
left wall (from runnyeye, that is).  Used to get poked by the occasional<br/>
muddite, rarely happens to me anymore, waaaaay to fast for &#39;em &lt;grin&gt;  Of<br/>
course, if I do see an eye, I turn tail and run back and wait.<br/>
<br/>
Very important to give a shout if you start pulling a train, though, to warn<br/>
the folks who will have to deal with it at the zone borders, seem to be lots<br/>
of folk hunting thereabouts these days.<br/>
