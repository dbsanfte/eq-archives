<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086158913">I&#39;ve worn the 5ac, 55hps rings for a long time now, and recently <br/>
upgraded to the velium 6ac, 65hp rings.  I keep some +7 all resist <br/>
rings around for resistance type situations.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, didn&#39;t you guys hear?  No one on Xegony is allowed to hit 53 <br/>
until they get an extra Vox scale for me. :)  Hmm... I just thought <br/>
of something... I&#39;ve never been the eBaying kind of guy, but it may <br/>
just pay to buy a 52 account JUST to get the Vox Scale.  Then again, <br/>
maybe there&#39;s already a Vox scale there. :)<br/>
