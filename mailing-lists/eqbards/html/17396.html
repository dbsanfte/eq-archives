<b>Subject:</b> Geforce and SBLive! questions for p3 800 system <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-274975282">Hi all!<br/>
It has been ages since I posted anything.  I do lurk though :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem with system lock ups while playing EQ.  I have a new <br/>
Gateway P3 800 (coppermine), 256 ram, Geforce 256 DDR (by creative), <br/>
SBLive!, and a cable modem.  I get a system lock up for no apparent reason.  <br/>
I can be just waiting for a boat at the docks....LOCKS up.  I have <br/>
downloaded the latest drivers and and reinstalled Direct X 7, and this fixed <br/>
a funny sound problem (the one where everything sounds ok only when <br/>
sitting).  I do get flashes of lines or boxes on the screen.  Even just <br/>
standing with no songs going.  The game plays ok with these flashes (if you <br/>
call that ok).  I have changed all the resolutions in the game control box, <br/>
I have turned on and off all the effects, and nothing seems to matter.<br/>
<br/>
It is disappointing to upgrade to a rig that should run the bejeeezous out <br/>
of EQ, then have it do crashes and whatnot.  OTH, the game loads FAST, and I <br/>
zone darn quick now too.<br/>
<br/>
Please, someone say they have an idea of what I can do!!!!<br/>

P.S.  Good to see more and more CT Bards about! :)<br/>
