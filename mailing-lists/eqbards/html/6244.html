The general jist however is about the out of control<br/>
camping and twinking and personally I think the best<br/>
solution to this is in the name of the game. <br/>
<br/>
EverQuest.  <br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem I have seen with Verant <br/>
ist their short sightedness and quick fix mentality<br/>
most of which winds up messing with our class.  I believe <br/>
my following suggestion would be the best option and would<br/>
cause the fewest problems.. On the other hand it would mean<br/>
they would have to actually FIX something else.<br/>
<br/>
They should make all these specialty items Quest only no drop<br/>
items.  Ie you find out from the captain in highpass that there is<br/>
this Really powerful Gnoll leader cutting though the ranks of his guards<br/>
with a mighty axe.  Now you when you kill him have the ability to loot that axe.<br/>
<br/>
Now granted several people will be able to get the quest at the same time.. but only one can loot it at a time and then only once.. no droping no trading etc.  Of course this would mess with the powergamers but then they&#39;re the onese who keep convincing Verant to Nerf classes for no particularly good reason.</div>
