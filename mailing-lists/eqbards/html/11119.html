<div id="ygrps-yiv-378781740">Just a reminder.  Here&#39;s what GZ said regarding Selo&#39;s breaking root a<br/>
little while back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elwyn: It has been the case (since release) that playing Selo&#39;s when in an<br/>
outdoor zone, would &#39;break&#39; the effects of the root spell.  With a recent<br/>
patch, this is no longer the case.  Was it a bug that it broke root<br/>
originally, or is it a bug that now it doesn&#39;t?  When could we expect a fix<br/>
for this if it is a bug?<br/>
<br/>
GZ: Selo&#39;s breaking root has been back and forth since Beta 1.  We had it<br/>
breaking root for a while, but this proved to be just too powerful, since it<br/>
is a free song that bards keep mem&#39;d all the time.<br/>
