&gt; Two lag-zones that I&#39;ve noticed.. The area out front of (and inside of) the<br/>
&gt; Freeport Bank brings me to a crawl everytime. In ButcherBlock mountains, the<br/>

&gt; the mountain and can see the dock entrance - it slows down considerably.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Both docks (Freeport and BB) are slow.  When I was using a<br/>
Voodoo1 card on a K6-200, it was basically impossible for me<br/>
to get on the boat because my framerate droped to about 2 fps<br/>
at the docks (1 fps when the boat appeared).  All of<br/>
Butcherblock is pretty slow, about the same as North Ro, but<br/>
it is by no means the worst.<br/>
<br/>
The West Freeport gate is really bad (go fight at the South<br/>
Gate if you&#39;re a newbie here - yes you&#39;ll have to zone if you<br/>
die, but you are much less likely to die when you can actually<br/>
see what&#39;s going on).  Other places with noticable slowdowns<br/>
are:<br/>
<br/>
The stairs in Unrest just outside the barkeep room<br/>
The entrance and courtyard in Cazic<br/>
Pretty much all of Rivervale<br/>
Any place in Crushbone with line of sight to the castle<br/>
Open portions of Blackburrow<br/>

much lag there, so others may not be experiencing your<br/>
problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hah.  In UO, they made the entrances to all the banks one tile<br/>
wide.  To move through someone you had to have full stamina.<br/>
Idiots would stand in the entrance thus requiring that you<br/>
shove through them to get by.  If someone else wasn&#39;t at full<br/>
stamina and waiting to shove through, you  basically couldn&#39;t<br/>
leave or enter.<br/>
