&gt; Then that is really wrong. Im sorry but every class has something they are<br/>
&gt; really good at and Bards should be singing and playing instruments and for<br/>
&gt; us males Dancing (haha sorry ladys I had to say it ;) ) it is wrong of them<br/>
&gt; to cap it off at 200. We really need to write GZ a letter and ask them to<br/>
&gt; change that. Paladins are hybrids but they can max thier weapon skills out<br/>
&gt; at 255 same thing with ranger from what i hear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No actually, almost all the melee classes get capped at 200 too. I<br/>
think only monks and rogues go over 200 in any melee skill. Only casters<br/>
ever see skill improvements over 200.<br/>
