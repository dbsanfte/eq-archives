<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118807656">Too bad, there are things, people even, in some of those locked houses.  <br/>
<br/>
More spookiness, there are three types of bears in Kithicor, Black, Young<br/>
Kodiak, and Thumper, Kithicor&#39;s Grizz.  So why when I went to see Ole Kith<br/>
last nite was there a regular Grizz standing in his place?  Wasn&#39;t him<br/>
transformed either, unless he suddenly drops to somewhere around lvl 10 when<br/>
he does.  Imagine my fright though?  If I had come up from the house side<br/>
I&#39;d have died for sure as Grizz still jump me, and surely Ole Thumper would<br/>
jumped right in making me one big heap o Grizz food.  Also that &#39;a goblin&#39;<br/>
shows up in place of one of the &#39;a wolf&#39;s gray wolf compatriots.  Wonder if<br/>
he has the mythical grappling device the Sheriff wants so badly that at<br/>
least three people will tell you to take it to him if ever you find one...<br/>
<br/>
Helped someone find their way out of Kithicor last nite.  Scary thing was I<br/>
nearly got lost while doing it and I know the place.  Those high ridges sure<br/>
look like zone edges when you get tired.  Spooky to run two thirds the<br/>
length of the forest and not find the HighHold Pass you know is there!<br/>
<br/>
Decided to be really brave and actually camped in Kith.  With my back to the<br/>
crossroads stone!<br/>

&gt;&gt;Suddenly he realized the full enormity of the situation.  The door closed,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;AND?!?!?!?!?! What was IN there!?!?!?!<br/>

Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Not a thing.<br/>
<br/>
It was dead empty.<br/>
