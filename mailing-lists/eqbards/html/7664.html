&gt; It&#39;s ENTIRELY CPU related.  I recently upgraded my X2 connection which<br/>

&gt; There is ABSOLUTELY no difference in zoning times in Everquest.  So don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get your hopes up that getting that nifty cable modem, DSL Line (or playing<br/>
&gt; on that T1 at work when your boss isn&#39;t looking) is gonna erase the annoying<br/>
&gt; zone time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is one difference though...  In the analog world I saw that anything<br/>
&gt; over about 5-7 pct packet loss would create lag.  At the ping times I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; getting now (averages around 125 - occasionally I see two digits pings and<br/>
&gt; sometimes close to 200) Even packet loss of close to 20 pct doesn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; cause noticeable lag...<br/>

takes 15-40 seconds.  When I get 10-15% PL, it can take over a<br/>
minute, sometimes two.<br/>
