<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684574286">If we wanted to the lemming thing a better choice would be woodelves in<br/>
Kelethin.  We could all walk off the platform near the priest of discord<br/>
lift.  Now that would be fun and heck we could easily get bound right at<br/>
the platform.<br/>
<br/>
Not quite lemmings but we could easily pile up those dead wood elf corpses<br/>

<br/>
However lava diving is a whole lot of fun.<br/>

&gt; This idea was brought up on this mailing list quite some time ago, and never <br/>
&gt; reached fruition. I therefore would like to entreat the EQ bardic community <br/>
&gt; to join ranks and set out to do something truly silly and pointless <br/>
&gt; together.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this point, I am sure you are thinking, &quot;What can we do together, Aloro, <br/>
&gt; that would be silly and pointless and FUN?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You ARE thinking that, aren&#39;t you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good! So here is my proposal:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What: Gnomestock &#39;99<br/>
&gt; When: Friday, November 26th, starting at noon PST (or another time if the <br/>
&gt; community prefers...)<br/>
&gt; Who: Anyone who plays a bard on EQ, or any of their friends, family, or <br/>
&gt; pets.<br/>
&gt; Where: E&#39;ci, starting in Ak&#39;Anon, we shall make a glorious lemming-like run <br/>
&gt; to Lavastorm, there to practice cliff-diving ito lava. We&#39;ll need to get <br/>
&gt; bound in Freeport so wave after wave of gnomes can hurl themselves into <br/>
&gt; fiery doom.<br/>
&gt; How: Create a first level gnome character. We should all have names that are <br/>
&gt; somehow similar... one idea would be that all our names start with Gn, so <br/>
&gt; the puzzled PCs who watch wave after wave of gnomes run by will see the <br/>
&gt; connection. If we all have similar names it will make it easier to find each <br/>
&gt; other too... it might be advisable to try to make a gnomish equivalent of <br/>
&gt; your bardic name (thus e.g. I could make a gnome named Gnaloro). I suppose <br/>
&gt; it might even be possible to form a guild for this event (Gnomestock would <br/>
&gt; be a good one... I don&#39;t really know how hard it is to start a new guild or <br/>
&gt; how long it takes, but it would be nice to have guildchat, and the guild <br/>
&gt; name would be priceless).<br/>
&gt; Why: Because we like you! </span></blockquote></div>
