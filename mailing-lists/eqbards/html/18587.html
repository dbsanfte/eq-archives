<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744226971">I have no idea, but this is very cool.  You found another Bard quest!  Wonder if it&#39;s broken like all the<br/>
others.  (Slap myself for being cynical!)  Good luck!  I&#39;ll ask around for you.<br/>

&gt; ... Scout Treekill gets excited.  What?!! Do you know how to bake a<br/>
&gt; Burynai Bunt Cake.  Glinya said she would marry me if I baked one!!<br/>
&gt; She won&#39;t let me use her oven so I had to search for one.  I finally<br/>
&gt; located one in some goblin mine, but I can&#39;t find the recipe or bake.<br/>
&gt; Please!! I would give you this bards helm for a Burynai Bunt Cake.<br/>
