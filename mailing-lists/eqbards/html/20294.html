<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538209213"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Something wrong with a PII 200 with 64 MB RAM?  Heh heh.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your best cost/benefit upgrade would be another 64meg of RAM, <br/>
&gt; that should<br/>
&gt; improve things a LOT.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I priced that out a while back and have been putting it off.  I&#39;ve<br/>
already upgraded the modem (to a winmodem of all things!  F1 /bonk), the<br/>
hard drive (it&#39;s a bad sign when you have to delete Powerpoint to fit<br/>
Everquest), the sound card, and countless drivers.  I feel like I&#39;m sinking<br/>
time and money into a junk car at this point.  So my intention is to live<br/>
with it for a while longer then splurge on a whole new unit.  <br/>
<br/>
But anyway, that doesn&#39;t alter the fact that Blackburrow is laggier than any<br/>
other low level zone (except perhaps low-level RoK zones) and still seems an<br/>
odd choice for a bard to hunt in.  Tszaaz, do you experience lag ANYWHERE???<br/>

Pain and suffering hit YOU for 5 points!<br/>
You were injured by running smack into a wall that you were unable to steer<br/>
away from<br/>
You tell the group, &quot;zoning&quot;<br/>

You have entered Qeynos Hills<br/>
