<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872490317"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1.  Counters can get in the way.  You&#39;ll see a failure message (target is <br/>
&gt; too far away?  target is not visible?  not sure, but you&#39;ll see one).  <br/>
&gt; Stand next to him/her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You cannot see your target.   That is the message you will receive.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.  It&#39;s a wind-based song, it will be better when you can use your flute <br/>
&gt; (which you will really only be able to practice when you get underwater <br/>
&gt; song).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  As with all of our other wind based songs, the flute is utterly<br/>
  useless unless it&#39;s required (invisiblility).  Using a flute for<br/>
  our other songs doesn&#39;t do anything.  Charm, Pixie, Charisma,<br/>
  WaterBreathing, no duration improvement, resist lessening, or<br/>
  statistical adjustment can be noticed.  Which is sad, and probably<br/>
  explains why my Darkwood Piccolo has no stats.<br/>

  Verant1&gt; Hey, I&#39;m gonna put a flute on Cazic Thule.<br/>
  Verant2&gt; Ok, cool, is it gonna be like the horn on Vox, or drums on Nag?<br/>
  Verant1&gt; You mean useful?  Since when were flutes useful? &lt;chuckle&gt;<br/>
  Verant2&gt; &lt;chuckle&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Fill in those people with names like, Gordo, GZ, or Bradboy.<br/>
  They all fit ;)<br/>

  Harmonic, who can bash himself &#39;a revultant verant&#39; if need be.</div>
