<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  As with all of our other wind based songs, the flute is utterly<br/>
  useless unless it&#39;s required (invisiblility).  Using a flute for<br/>
  our other songs doesn&#39;t do anything.  Charm, Pixie, Charisma,<br/>
  WaterBreathing, no duration improvement, resist lessening, or<br/>
  statistical adjustment can be noticed.  Which is sad, and probably<br/>
  explains why my Darkwood Piccolo has no stats.<br/>

  Verant1&gt; Hey, I&#39;m gonna put a flute on Cazic Thule.<br/>
  Verant2&gt; Ok, cool, is it gonna be like the horn on Vox, or drums on Nag?<br/>
  Verant1&gt; You mean useful?  Since when were flutes useful? &lt;chuckle&gt;<br/>
  Verant2&gt; &lt;chuckle&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Fill in those people with names like, Gordo, GZ, or Bradboy.<br/>
  They all fit ;)<br/>

  Harmonic, who can bash himself &#39;a revultant verant&#39; if need be.</div>
