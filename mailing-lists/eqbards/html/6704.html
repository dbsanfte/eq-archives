Marshall Anrey in Rivervale gives you this quest.  It requires you to give<br/>
him a dragoon dirk. In return, he will give you the leatherfoot raider cap.<br/>
According to some spoiler sites, you have to give him a polar bear skin/hide<br/>
(can&#39;t remember which) first before you can do the leatherfoot raider cap<br/>
quest.  I thought I had read a long time ago on this list that you could<br/>
bypass the first quest and just give him the dirk from the outset.  I tried<br/>
that last night and ended up losing my dragoon dirk without getting the cap.<br/>
Can someone who has completed the leatherfoot raider cap quest tell me how<br/>
they did it?  Also, the Marshall conned amiably to me and I was singing the<br/>
carillion when I gave him the dirk.  That didn&#39;t make a difference.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
