I get casters in my groups in their friggin&#39; FOURTIES that still get panicy<br/>
when I weave Hymn in while medding.  They see the Hymn icon but no Clarity<br/>
icon and they start saying &quot;Mana song!  Mana song!  WTF!?!?&quot;  I&#39;ve had guys<br/>
*disband* calling me &quot;incompetent&quot; because I wouldn&#39;t sing pure Clarity, but<br/>
insisted on continuing to sing [Clarity, Clarity, Hymn...] when the tanks<br/>
were a half-bubble of HPs low.  I have yet to find a way to talk to these<br/>
pig-headed morons (and yes, they&#39;re almost always Wizards).  It seems to me<br/>
that the amount of DD that a class can do in this game is inversely<br/>
proportional to the brains that it takes to run it.<br/>
