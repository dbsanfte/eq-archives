 </span></blockquote>  It kept me busy for a few days.  Collecting those things wasn&#39;t<br/>
  too bad a chore, but it gave me something to do.<br/>
<br/>
  First DW goblin had a helm.  Go figure.  I remember having to kill<br/>
  like 20 or 30 of them before.  I even broke the spawn in Lake Rathe<br/>
  with no help, although I almost died twice ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve always had all the charred pieces.<br/>
<br/>
  I auction&#39;d for BI arms, and got nothing for a while until some<br/>
  fellow sent me a tell that he&#39;d sell his.  I pulled out my wallet<br/>
  not knowing how much those things cost.  I was about to drop 50pp<br/>
  on him, sounded fair to me.  And he only asked for 5pp.  Ouch, is<br/>
  blackened that cheap now?  I tossed him 15pp, and let him keep the<br/>
  change (kinda low level, 15pp is a lot - although I would have paid<br/>
  him 50pp for expediating the deal as fast as he did)  He took the<br/>
  money, gave me the arms, and was off.  I suppose I need to get<br/>
  BI bracers now, however I think the silver ones look decent too.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone recommend a good shield and 1hs sword that looks like <br/>
  something a shadowknight would use? (ie a long, longsword)<br/>
