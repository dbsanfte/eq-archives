<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420168355">My experience:<br/>
<br/>
10-15 West Commons and S Ro hunting Dervs.  There is a<br/>
guy in S. Ro you can turn rings in to for some xp and<br/>
faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro.<br/>
<br/>
15-20 Lake Rathetear or hunt orcs in the Rathe Mtns. <br/>
There is an orc village near the Paladin Camp in the<br/>
Rathe Mtns that is seldom camped.  I recommend a<br/>
partner for this.  you can run to the Pally camp if<br/>
you get into trouble<br/>
<br/>
20-30 Lake of Ill Omen.  Start near the ruins on the<br/>
South side of the lake, then look at the gob mines in<br/>
the NW corner, then the Sarnak Castle in the NE<br/>
corner. (cool stuff drops in the castle)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>
stuck in the first lvl of hell<br/>

&gt; &gt; 10-12 Blackburrow <br/>
&gt; &gt; (I know it inside out and it is a great dungeon<br/>
&gt; for bards) <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 12-15 Kurns Tower <br/>
&gt; &gt; (which means dropping lots of silver, but all<br/>
&gt; those warriors <br/>
&gt; &gt; are going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; love being hasted)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 15-20 Unrest <br/>
&gt; &gt; (I never hunted there before as my previous<br/>
&gt; computer couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; handle it)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 20-25 Lake of Ill Omen <br/>
&gt; &gt; (I took Tszaaz from 25-30 there, it might get<br/>
&gt; tedious, might not)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am not feeling particularly inspired by this<br/>
&gt; list however. <br/>
&gt; &gt; If anyone has<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggestions for when, as a bard, to go where I<br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; appreciate it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m entirely unqualified to give you advice, but I<br/>
&gt; would like to know why<br/>
&gt; you feel Blackburrow is such a good dungeon for<br/>
&gt; bards.  I&#39;ve found it to be<br/>
&gt; lag-city (2 song max) and have not been able to<br/>
&gt; successfully hunt there with<br/>
&gt; either my bard, shaman, wizard, or rogue.  I<br/>
&gt; understand it&#39;s a good spot for<br/>
&gt; a necro though.  But then, what isn&#39;t?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Peace<br/>
