&gt;Well, two of us rendevoused out in the Barbarian village in West K, and<br/>
&gt;found Frostbite.  Mcmannus stands just within aggro range at times, so you<br/>
&gt;have to watch him, and make sure he leaves.  Also, another wandering<br/>
&gt;Barbarian walks around near the pen on an irregular basis.  After both Barbs<br/>
&gt;were clear, I took Frostbite for a bit of a run, to get him away from the<br/>
&gt;camp, and proceeded to solo him.  Easy fight at 17th level, using<br/>
&gt;dirk/barbed whip/songs.  But, no fish.  Just a ruined wolf pelt.  so my<br/>
&gt;guildmate shows up, we wait a bit, new spawn, let the barbs run off, and he<br/>
&gt;nukes the wolf.  Same thing, ruined wolf pelt.  So, there is something more<br/>
&gt;to getting Frostbite to have a fish on his corpse, or another way to get it<br/>
&gt;from him, without killing him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is possible to get the fish from Frostbite, you don&#39;t need to do<br/>
anything else.  I tried it once as a bard but got nothing except a<br/>
nice bit of xp :-)<br/>
<br/>
As a wizard I killed Frostbite a few times and eventually got the damn<br/>
fish.<br/>
<br/>
However, she is now unable to go anywhere near Halas due to the<br/>
faction hits you take.  Just as well, she hates the cold anyway!!<br/>
<br/>
So you take your choice what way to get the fish.  Either no-go in<br/>
Qeynos, or no-go in Halas.  I might suggest doing it from Qeynos since<br/>
there is probably a way to raise your faction with them again.  As far<br/>
as I can tell, there is no way to raise your faction in Halas, so no<br/>
partying with the barbarians as a wizard for me!!!<br/>
