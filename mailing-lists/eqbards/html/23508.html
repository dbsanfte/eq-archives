While it&#39;s just a game, you are still dealing with people and this person is not honorable or honest at all. I&#39;d never group with them personally.<br/>

&gt; Were you in a pickup group when the Harmonic Dagger dropped?  I know there<br/>
&gt; are a lot of greedy players out there, but if I was in a group that made me<br/>
&gt; roll for the Harmonic Dagger or any Bard only item, I would quit the group<br/>
&gt; in disgust and never group with any of them again.<br/>
