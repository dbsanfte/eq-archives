<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603776168">I would like to know if there is significant benefit to agi and dex above<br/>
120 and 130 levels - compared to 100-110.  With drum and chant, my dex goes<br/>
to like 160 (ya, I have some really insane stat boosting jewelry.)<br/>

<br/>
		FYI.  Just read the following on the E&#39;ci board at EQVault.<br/>
The poster got<br/>
		it off a monk website.<br/>
<br/>
		Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
<br/>
		There was just a post on the monk board where someone used<br/>
the log programs<br/>
		to test combat against 10 DW Caimans with 93 AGI and again<br/>
with 107 AGI.<br/>
		While most of the numbers were within general tolerances,<br/>
average Dodges per<br/>
		fight went from 0.4 to 1.0, and average Blocks per fight<br/>
went from 1.4 to<br/>
		2.4. Also, the mob&#39;s hit/miss ratio dropped from 48% to 44%,<br/>
which is not<br/>
		surprising.<br/>
		So I&#39;m taking this as evidence that there IS an AGI boost to<br/>
Dodge and Block<br/>
		(at least for monks, but probably for everyone), and likely<br/>
for Parry as<br/>
		well. If anyone&#39;s skeptical, well, you can type /log as well<br/>
as any of us..<br/>
