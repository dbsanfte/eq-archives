<b>Subject:</b> Quest components in MM (was AC Dilemma) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-38370993">I have also followed a similar strategy to acquire the quest components.  So<br/>
far I have eight pieces but have yet to find anyone selling a lambent stone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the past two weeks, I have been hanging out in MM trying to get a lute.<br/>
I guess my timing has been bad because the times I have been online, none of<br/>
the higher level characters are camping the music room where the gypsies<br/>
spawn.  As a 26th level bard, the furthest into MM I have gone is the<br/>
courtyard and the secret room with four doors near the graveyard.  I know<br/>
where the secret walls are that lead up into the castle but have not dared<br/>
to go any further (I assume that mobs will see through my invis song if I go<br/>
upstairs).  Would appreciate it if someone can give me directions to the<br/>
music(piano) room from the secret room just in case someone finds a gypsy<br/>
lute and is willing to give it away or sell the looting rights. <br/>
<br/>
Many times while camping besides the lake, massive trains will go by heading<br/>
to the zone.  I&#39;ve sat there and watched to see if any gypsies are part of<br/>
the train.  So far there haven&#39;t been any.  I am beginning to believe that<br/>
parties have no incentive to camp the music room if a bard isn&#39;t in the<br/>
party.  As a result, I am contemplating leaving MM and only returning when I<br/>
am 32d level.  At that point, I can offer to be a mana bard in exchange for<br/>
the parties agreeing to help me get the gypsy lute.  I think that is<br/>
probably the best course of action because I can&#39;t get the lambent<br/>
breastplate until I also get the basalt carapace.  Once again, my chances of<br/>
finding a party to help me get the basalt carapace are much better if I can<br/>
sing the mana song.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing concerning the basalt carapace.  Last night in MM another<br/>
bard was auctioning to purchase looting rights for a basalt carapace.  I<br/>
told him that they were found on the gargoyles in Lower Guk.  He told me<br/>
that they could also be looted off the tougher gargoyles in MM.  I have<br/>
never heard of anyone getting a basalt carapace in MM.   Can anyone confirm<br/>
if this is a possibility.  I do know for a fact that the black silk gloves<br/>
are dropped by mobs other than the deathly usher.  I have personally seen a<br/>
deathly aegis and a deathly harbinger drop the gloves.  I guess its possible<br/>
that the basalt carapace can be dropped by mobs other than those told to you<br/>
by the quest giver in Solusek temple.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Actually I have been hunting parts for lambent armor since it where added.<br/>
&gt; Until now I have:<br/>
&gt; 1 lambent stone, bought for 30pp.<br/>
&gt; 1 Shin greavers<br/>
&gt; 1 Shin gauntlets<br/>
&gt; I looted the shin stuff in LGuk with help of some of my higher level<br/>
&gt; friends/guild, but I would not think that it would be to hard to get them<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; just going there and waiting. Got the gaunts from another person who did a<br/>
&gt; /shout Gaunts to loot at entrance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1 Dark bracelet (sp?)<br/>
&gt; The Dark bracelet was aquired during my normal fighting in Unrest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Currently I am trying to get the Icy greavers, but my main problem is that<br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; one on Bertox seems to hunt in Perma during my normal playing hours<br/>
&gt; (evenings<br/>
&gt; CET around 8-12PST), but getting to king room is not a problem if someone<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; keeping the area around the first gate clear. Anyone else notice that<br/>
&gt; invisio<br/>
&gt; seems to fail EVERY time you get near it (Atleast it did when I was 23<br/>
&gt; havent<br/>
&gt; tried at 24 yet)?<br/>
&gt; Well I was in one group who camped the king room for some time and it was<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; tough to hold for a group of level 23-30 or so people with the right<br/>
&gt; pulling<br/>
&gt; strategi.<br/>
&gt; When I get the icy&#39;s I will be of to MM again to try and get the gloves<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; lute. Or maybe the karanas to get a griffene charm.<br/>
&gt; So dont give up. You can get the stuff with a bit of help. Just give<br/>
&gt; yourself<br/>
&gt; time to get to know the zones where the items is - and how to get there.<br/>
&gt; Using your invisio song you can go far in on your own to get the loot.<br/>
