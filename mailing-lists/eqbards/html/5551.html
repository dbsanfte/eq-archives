<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The last time I saw this guy he was understandably upset, but swimming<br/>
 </span></blockquote>offshore to look for his corpse in the direction that I gave him.  Believe<br/>
me<br/>
I wished him well, but I couldn&#39;t put my character in that potentially<br/>
disarterous position.<br/>
<br/>
How would others have handled this situation?  Given it&#39;s midnight, and you<br/>
plan on logging within an hour or so and there&#39;s no bank on the island.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That happened to a guild member and good friend of mine.  We both agreed<br/>
that it was ridiculous to try to swim all the way to the zone.  He<br/>
/petitioned and explained that he was killed on the boat and the corpse was<br/>
dumped when the boat zoned.  The guide kindly summoned his corpse for him,<br/>
since it was where it was through no fault of his own.<br/>
