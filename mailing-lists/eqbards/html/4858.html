<div id="ygrps-yiv-604378633">This probably falls under the issue of &#39;balance&#39;. For healing - I just<br/>
group with them anyway till they are healed, then simply ungroup.<br/>
<br/>
For buffs - you&#39;re probably not supposed to be &#39;helping&#39; those that are so<br/>
far under you that you would mess up their exp gains. Course - that doesn&#39;t<br/>
explain why ANY caster can do it - it lasts FAR longer, and they never have<br/>
to be grouped.....but that&#39;s likely the explaination anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Our classes is DESIGNED for group stuff - I can also hear the howls now<br/>
that bards are killing SoW&#39;s left and right, either accidentally or on<br/>
purpose with Selo&#39;s.<br/>

&gt;One thing that I would like added for bards, but I don&#39;t know if other&#39;s <br/>
&gt;would want it, is a button we could toggle between &#39;Group&#39; and &#39;All&#39;.  This <br/>
&gt;would then effect our songs to effect only those in our group, or those with <br/>
&gt;in the song&#39;s radius around us. Many times sitting at a guard tower I wish I <br/>
&gt;could play the Hymn to help the people around me heal faster. Or in the <br/>
&gt;newbie areas I&#39;d love to buff their stats, but can&#39;t group because I kill <br/>
&gt;their experience.  Any other thoughts on this idea?<br/>
