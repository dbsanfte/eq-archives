&gt; No no, I&#39;ve encountered no camps yet. Forage is a really difficult one to<br/>
&gt; raise since it recycles so seldom and fails a lot. Keep trying, it&#39;ll go<br/>
&gt; up. As far as other caps - I&#39;m sneaking about at 60 or so (and rising) at<br/>
&gt; 23rd, so that&#39;s not capped at 40 for sure. Seriously doubt other skills<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; capped, wouldn&#39;t make sense.<br/>

&gt; I recently noticed that despite getting the foraging skill at 12th level<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; has never increased.  I was then informed that many of our skills have<br/>
caps<br/>
&gt; on them of 40 or so.  What&#39;s the deal with this?  I really don&#39;t like the<br/>
&gt; idea of skill caps, especially on a simple self preservation skill like<br/>
&gt; foraging.  You already can&#39;t sell what you forage so why put a cap on it?<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know any more on this and what the possible reasoning behind<br/>
&gt; them could be?  What are bards just too stupid to learn these things<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; well?  Its not bad enough we all get the useless skill of brass<br/>
instruments<br/>
&gt; at 12th level, which cannot be used till 18th.  Now Wood Elves get no new<br/>
&gt; skill at 12th since forage is already maxed and hide is already at the<br/>
&gt; supposed cap as well.  Does that mean the xp penalty we take for being<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; to start with those skills will go away once we actually have them?  I<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; not.  I&#39;m usually not big on ranting, but this has me really steamed.<br/>
What<br/>
&gt; good is it to get a skill at 25th level that caps at a point where it will<br/>
&gt; only work on things 10+ levels below you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; J.M.  Any thoughts on this one?  Please tell me this will change at some<br/>
&gt; point.<br/>
