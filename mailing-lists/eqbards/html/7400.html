 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good point.  One &quot;benefit&quot; of not being able to bind<br/>
anywhere is that you will not die 10-20 times and lose a level<br/>
or two when your guild decides to fight a dragon.  Heck, being<br/>
bards, you&#39;re not likely to die at all, as your main function<br/>
will be to play Clarity for the clerics so they can resurrect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um, the only people who suffer resurrection effects during a<br/>
battle are melee people, who don&#39;t want to waste time running<br/>
back.  Casters as you point out just respawn, memorize their<br/>
spell(s), and nuke, leaving their body(ies) for resurrection<br/>
later after the fight is over.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess it depends on your group.  In mine, the casters are<br/>
most likely to make it out alive, as they all gate (usually<br/>
helped out by Screech).  Then the melee folks have to make the<br/>
long, twisty run to the zone past a dozen other mobs that will<br/>
join the train.  The people I see being most likely to die is<br/>
the bard and healer.  One song pulse and all those mobs you<br/>
were just overrun by go aggro on the bard.  One heal and those<br/>
mobs go aggro on the cleric.<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that everyone should be allowed to bind<br/>
only in cities.  But we&#39;re probably beyond the point where it<br/>
would be viable to make that change.  The uproar from the<br/>
players (well, half the players) would be deafening.</div>
