&gt; I&#39;m curious though what would happen if you had about a dozen<br/>
&gt; L50 bards continuously Pixie Striking Nagafen to interrupt his<br/>
&gt; spells.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well on our server we tried stun, and that doesn&#39;t work at all, so I<br/>
doubt pixie strike would. People just have to face it. Verant really<br/>
doesn&#39;t like the dragons being killed. As soon as anyone figures out a<br/>
strategy that allows them to kill it, that strategy will be fixed. They<br/>
obviously don&#39;t care that you&#39;ve made a high level and would like to<br/>
participate in something big before you finally wander off, bored, as<br/>
they probably did the numbers and figured out that most of the rapid<br/>
advancers were so excited about the game on release that they signed up<br/>
for the 6 month deal, and thus if you leave early they get a free month<br/>
out of you right now without you hanging around being a drain on server<br/>
resources.<br/>
