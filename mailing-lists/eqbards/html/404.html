<div id="ygrps-yiv-707772824">&lt;OOC&gt; I have had a lot of experience with ICQ chat, and found it to be<br/>
buggy at best. That is why I use IRC servers. the tech is a bit more solid,<br/>
and designed for larger groups. And with all the free servers out there (I<br/>
frequent StarChat, it is smaller and less crowed than DalNet, and some of<br/>
the other well known IRC nets). The other advantage is that it has better<br/>
security for founders, and it does not require the founder be online<br/>
(without interruption) for a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
	This way people can gather anytime they want to live chat. And those picked<br/>
to be ops can keep control at all times though Chanserv. I would like to<br/>
suggest you investigate this method. I have created, oped, and attended many<br/>
channels on IRC and find it the best for such an endeavor.&lt;/OOC&gt;<br/>

&gt; I like the idea - but can ICQ be used (efficiently) for a large<br/>
&gt; chat?  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; only used it for at most 4-5 people.  Anyone have experience with this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also - having done large group things like this in other multi-player<br/>
&gt; games - I&#39;d STRONGLY recommend not doing anything without an agenda worked<br/>
&gt; out in advance...<br/>
