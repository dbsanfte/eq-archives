<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756826638">I&#39;ve had some great success with pixie strike.  Mostly<br/>
tho, I use it to interupt casters.  There does seem to<br/>
be a pretty good resist rate, but it&#39;s still one of my<br/>
primary songs when I am in a caster heavy environment.<br/>
<br/>
I was in the Temple Room of Dalnirs the other day and<br/>
we had a coeressed goblin that just wouldn&#39;t hold<br/>
still.  It ran everywhere, casting all the while and<br/>
nobody could keep up with it to wack it.<br/>
<br/>
I finally zeroed in with Pixie strike and used that to<br/>
stop the casting, hold it still and beat it to death.<br/>

&gt; the feedback given <br/>
&gt; from this list.  I die enough as it is, I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; particulary open to <br/>
&gt; testing something out under fire that I&#39;m almost<br/>
&gt; certain is gonna <br/>
&gt; fail. :)  Lullaby, I use to powerlevel my<br/>
&gt; girlfriend&#39;s twink and <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s about it.  And I don&#39;t imagine that working<br/>
&gt; so well when she <br/>
&gt; gets to around 30 or so...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I almost exclusively use charm to do crowd control. <br/>
&gt; If I&#39;m the main <br/>
&gt; crowd controller (i.e. no enchanter) I can usually<br/>
&gt; effectively handle <br/>
&gt; a 3 pull... put your pet on the 3rd mob and they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; beat each other <br/>
&gt; up for awhile... But, you need a cleric to keep you<br/>
&gt; alive with 2 mobs <br/>
&gt; beating on you during resists or mis-timed recharms.<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve been in a <br/>
&gt; few parties where the paladin would taunt the 2nd,<br/>
&gt; move out of range <br/>
&gt; and root it... Frustrated me trying to get my pet to<br/>
&gt; attack while he <br/>
&gt; was rooted, but a pretty effective method<br/>
&gt; nonetheless.  If there&#39;s 4 <br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t think the group can handle at least 2<br/>
&gt; beating down the <br/>
&gt; tanks at once, then it&#39;s time to call ZONE before<br/>
&gt; you even get into <br/>
&gt; the fight.  Hell, have the puller zone it off the<br/>
&gt; bat. :)  I plan <br/>
&gt; excursions to Sebilis/Chardok, etc. around a cleric<br/>
&gt; and/or enchanter <br/>
&gt; (no way I&#39;m going anywhere tough without at least<br/>
&gt; one), so it&#39;s just <br/>
&gt; pick up groups I have to worry about.  Karnor&#39;s is<br/>
&gt; the prime spot for <br/>
&gt; pickup groups on my server and luckily, the zone is<br/>
&gt; close to most of <br/>
&gt; the camp spots. :)<br/>
