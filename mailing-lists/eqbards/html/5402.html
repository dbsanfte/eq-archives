&gt; I think a lot of you people gushing about how easy it is to make money via<br/>
&gt; loot are exaggerating.  I have a 23rd monk that works his butt off and he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; never had more than about 125pp in the bank at any one time.  I&#39;ve spent time<br/>
&gt; in unrest.  Where&#39;s the money there?  FS weapons?  The cash drops aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; *that* great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired of reading about<br/>
&gt; how others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably a little harder now. The people who talk about making 100+<br/>
plat a trip to Unrest may, like me, have been in the group ahead of the<br/>
bell curve of player population. When I was playing in unrest, you could<br/>
sell small bronze chests for 70pp, with other pieces proportionate.<br/>
That, plus specials I got I couldn&#39;t use, like Savant&#39;s caps,<br/>
bloodstained gloves, a second and then third bloodstained mantle, plus<br/>
fine steel and the cash dropped by mobs put me into partial steel plate<br/>
by L25 (at that time no one had a clue where medium bronze could be<br/>
found) After I moved on from Unrest to Cazic and we started finding<br/>
rubicite, my bank went up even faster, as I replaced my steel with Rubi.<br/>
That was an interesting time, as instead of the case you have now, where<br/>
you can&#39;t get a templar or diviner because of campers and kill stealers,<br/>
we had the problem or trying to figure out how to break the spawn in the<br/>
throne room with just the 10-12 people who were down there. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
until the guy who got the first pair of rubi legs went to unrest to show<br/>
them off that the crowds started showing up, and even that took a while<br/>
as he told everyone who asked that he&#39;d got them in Guk. :-)<br/>
