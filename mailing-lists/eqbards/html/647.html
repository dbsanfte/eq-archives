&gt;Does anyone know what the level 30 bard song is?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am approaching level 31 and all the bards i have talked to on<br/>
&gt;different servers don&#39;t think there is a level 30 song.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, there IS a level 30 song, although last I have heard, no one has<br/>
located it yet.... or rather, no one has retrieved it yet.<br/>
<br/>
The level 30 song is a Group Haste song which is supposed to be stackable<br/>
with Anthem.  It is a quest item.  If the quest is the one I have found (as<br/>
I&#39;ve been told it is), don&#39;t expect to complete the quest unless you are in<br/>
a party of near-40th-level characters.<br/>
