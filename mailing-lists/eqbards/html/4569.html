From the Journals of Angarth Bladedancer, Wolf-Warrior of the Anstruther <br/>
Clan <br/>
     <br/>
Tuesday, 3rd of November, in the Year 3174 <br/>
     <br/>
        The forest was covered in a thick fog, giving the illusion of<br/>
walking on clouds.  A steady chorus of insects serenaded us as we traveled <br/>
beneath the huge oak trees in a southwesterly direction.  The druid in our <br/>
company, Morrel Direstorm, led us to a small wood elf village where we were <br/>
able to refresh our provisions and continue on our journey.  Not far from <br/>
the hamlet we encountered a lone orc centurion.  The beast was adorned in <br/>
the trappings of the Crushbone orcs, with a sickly, gray hide and yellow <br/>
tusks protruding from its misshapen maw.  We followed the creature, trailing <br/>
it to its camp situated at the bottom of a hill.  The encampment consisted <br/>
of three small huts surrounding a huge campfire.  The huts were made of <br/>
tanned skins stretched taut over hickory poles with primitive designs drawn <br/>
on the surface of the skins.<br/>
        The orc we followed stopped to talk to one of the orcs by the<br/>
campfire then retreated into a hut.  Morrel informed us that the orc was the <br/>
oracle, considered the wise leader of the camp.   Having a high hatred for <br/>
the foul beasts, we started formulating a plan to remove the blight from the <br/>
land.  I proceeded to enter the camp and take out the leader, when the <br/>
largest orc I have ever seen came rushing from the center tent!  The beast <br/>
was just a few inches shorter than my 7-foot height, but twice the girth. <br/>
With a flurry of swings and bashes, the legionnaire kept me busy trying to <br/>
dodge, parry and attack.  Luckily the other orcs in the camp did not have <br/>
the gumption to join the fray.  With the druid healing and the wizard, <br/>
Maurek Maelstrom, igniting the orc with lightning and fire, it finally <br/>
succumbed to death.  In my travels in all of Norrath, I have not found a <br/>
stronger orc than this legionnaire.  Even the powerful Shralok orcs of High <br/>
Hold pale in comparison.  Fatigued from the battle, we moved to the south <br/>
away from the camp to recuperate.<br/>
        We followed the line of hills to the west, passing by a few vacated<br/>
camps.  At one point we passed by a structure of stones that had fallen in <br/>
disrepair. Morrel informed us that it was a gathering place for what the <br/>
wood-folk call fae drakes, related to the pixies and brownies of Lesser <br/>
Faydark.  They were not malicious to us, so after a brief rest and vigilance <br/>
over the &#39;butterflies&#39; (that is what they reminded me of) we continued on <br/>
our journey. <br/>
        As we continued traveling westward, the forest became unnaturally<br/>
quiescent.  No sound.  No wind.    From what we could tell, not a living <br/>
entity stirred in this part of the forest.  Unsettling?  Yes.  Oppressive? <br/>
Very. An ill omen of what was to come?  Perhaps.  But we are hardened <br/>
adventurers.  Brave.  Daring.  And foolish.<br/>
        We found a trail that lead southward through the hills.  As we<br/>
followed the roughly hewn path, the stagnation increased, almost like moving <br/>
through the fetid swamp of Innothule.  There was no water, or mud bogs, just <br/>
the stench of rotted vegetation and decay.  And the air was thick with the <br/>
cloying smell of death.  The trail continued to the southwest, each step <br/>
taking us closer to whatever was causing the decadence.  There was a point <br/>
that we crossed when the ground was suddenly covered in a fine mist, so <br/>
thick that it seemed like snow.  We stopped at this point and moved <br/>
backwards, and the mist just as suddenly disappeared.  Something was <br/>
definitely wrong here, and we were determined to find out what. We entered <br/>
the mists...<br/>
     <br/>
        Ahead, built into the side of a towering mountain, stood a massive<br/>
edifice.  The path we followed led into a small courtyard with a pool in the <br/>
center.  A turret stood on a hill to the right of the path, standing like a <br/>
huge, stone guardian watching over the entrance to its master&#39;s domain.<br/>
Just as we reached the base of the tower, a hideous scream filled the air. <br/>
A dark elf adorned in plate armor came running toward us!  Atop his head <br/>
rested a helm shaped in the form of a demon, with horns protruding from the <br/>
crown and jagged teeth just above the mouth.  The dark elf spoke in a voice <br/>
that seemed like it emitted from within a sepulcher, and his breath smelled <br/>
of decay and rot.<br/>
                &quot;Welcome to Mistmoore.  I am the harbinger of your death!&quot;<br/>
        I brought my swords up in front of me, trying to deflect the blows<br/>
of the harbinger.  The speed of the demon was phenomenal, his dirk and <br/>
rapier darting between my defenses and scoring several severe blows.  The <br/>
wizard stood back and unleashed a lightning bolt, the hot energy coursing <br/>
over the harbinger at the same time the druid cast his spell. <br/>
        With a demoniac laugh, the dark elf continued his onslaught,<br/>
unaffected by the magical attack.  Morrel moved back a few steps and healed <br/>
me, but the wounds the black fiend inflicted on my person were far more <br/>
deadly than the druids&#39; power could overcome.  I slowly retreated, keeping <br/>
the harbingers attention to me while my comrades fled the mist.  At my first <br/>
opportunity, I turn and followed my friends to safety. Oddly enough, the <br/>
harbinger did not follow us from the mist.  Perhaps the dark elf gained his <br/>
power from the mist.  Perhaps he was bound to the mists in a way we did not <br/>
understand.  I believe he was fettered to the mists by the vileness of his <br/>
own heart and his veneration to the God of Hate.  <br/>
        We tarried at the edge of the mists until my wounds were made whole<br/>
and the two spellcasters had finished meditating.  We were determined to <br/>
investigate the courtyard that we glimpsed from the trail, to at least gain <br/>
some knowledge of the area so that we might come back when we were more <br/>
powerful and greater in numbers.  By the time we recuperated, the sun was <br/>
sinking below the mountains, leaving the region in ever-shifting shadows. <br/>
We gathered our belongings and entered the mists once again.<br/>
     <br/>
        With sunlight streaming through the mountains the courtyard had<br/>
looked foreboding to say the least.  With darkness descending, the courtyard <br/>
transformed into something more horrific, something directly manifested from <br/>
the insane mind of Cazic-Thule himself.   The mist had thinned somewhat with <br/>
night approaching.  The first thing I noticed were the dead.  Corpses were <br/>
strewn everywhere, covering the ground like misshapen lumps of earth.  Some <br/>
had been dead for some time, naked from the scavengers except for a few <br/>
pieces of rotted clothing.  Others had been slain recently; their eyes still <br/>
wide in terror,  blood seeping from their many wounds.  Some I recognized - <br/>
Aramis, Garan, Mahlyn, Morstangar.   Others were as strange to me as the <br/>
land I now found myself.  There were wolves lying dead next to humans and <br/>
dwarfs and elves. Morrel informed us in a strangled voice that they were <br/>
druids in the guise of wolves.  The dissonance was the most disturbing, <br/>
however.  Screams of pain and torture filled the night air. Sounds of battle <br/>
could be heard coming from a trail leading up the mountain.  Then silence.<br/>
        We stood there for a few moments, listening to the dead, eyes wide<br/>
open for any danger lurking in the darkness.  A faint din broke the silence. <br/>
It sounded like running footsteps that grew louder and louder with each <br/>
passing moment.  The three of us were turning in circles, to see where the <br/>
noise was coming from.  Then I heard the shout.<br/>
         &quot;Run!&quot;<br/>
        Coming down the trail was a lone paladin, his silver armor covered<br/>
in dents and blood.  Trailing behind him were creatures so unspeakable I <br/>
shutter just remembering their ghastly visages and malformed bodies.  Some <br/>
were dark elves dressed in armor and wearing the same demon-skull the <br/>
harbinger wore.   Some were much worse.  <br/>
        We turned and started running up the trail, leaving swirling eddies<br/>
of mist in our wake.  I heard the crumble of armor on stone and turned to <br/>
look.  The paladin had fallen, his gore-splattered helmet slowly rocking <br/>
back and forth.  I took a step forward, my heart telling me to help the poor <br/>
fellow.   But my mind stopped me.  Perched on the back of the fallen paladin <br/>
is a werewolf, its mangy coat glistening with the blood of the hero.  I look <br/>
into the eyes of the beast and it smiles menacingly.  It smiles!   Something <br/>
drops from the open maw.  The arm of the paladin!  I quickly turned and ran <br/>
just as the salivating beast leaped toward me.  Ahead I saw where the mist <br/>
ended and started running faster.  A vicious blow sent me reeling through <br/>
the air, striking the ground hard.  Dazed, I felt something at my shoulder <br/>
pulling at me.  I turned around and brought my dirk out, ready to thrust it <br/>
in the chest of the foul beast. But it wasn&#39;t there.  Morrel is standing <br/>
over me, his spells sending healing warmth through my body.  The ground is <br/>
clear of the mists, and it seems the beast stopped at the edge.  We did not <br/>
enter the mists again.<br/>
