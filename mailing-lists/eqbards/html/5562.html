<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867692953">I&#39;m replying in hopes that other &quot;like levels&quot; such as myself<br/>
will find the information useful. I hope I&#39;m not being way<br/>
off topic. I think the info is bard related or at least useful<br/>
to bards of around 17th level..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Highpass is also good at this level, but if you&#39;re like me,<br/>
&gt; the camping and kill stealing in that place will make you<br/>
&gt; want to quit the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On Veeshan at least, Highpass is usually only camped<br/>
on the Orc side. The gnolls (still blue to me) are usually<br/>
fairly empty. But being that they love to back each other up,<br/>
it makes it kind of dangerous to solo sometimes. Just keep<br/>
your eyes open I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unfortunately, Befallen is the only real dungeon your level.<br/>
&gt; The &quot;next step&quot; are L20+ dungeons - Najena, Upper Guk, Unrest,<br/>
&gt; entrance to Permafrost, entrance to Cazic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I went into Najena last night while following a fellow list<br/>
person&#39;s advice to Lavastorm. I went so far as the first room<br/>
and then saw someone fighting a tentacle terror. It didn&#39;t<br/>
look pleasant, I didn&#39;t continue. (By the way, when your<br/>
faction goes down with &quot;Najena&quot; - who is it really going<br/>
down with? I&#39;ve been around Upper Guk alone too - but again,<br/>
not very far. I&#39;ve seen the entrances to Permafrost and Cazic<br/>
and they looked none to pleasant. Not to mention I get really<br/>
scared walking through the back entrance tunnel to Permafrost.<br/>
<br/>
I did find the suggestion of Lavastorm to be a good one, but<br/>
I think it would be better with 2 or more people. The fights<br/>
were just a little too close for comfort. I also found that<br/>
if you want to be silly at 17 and try to enter Solusek that<br/>
you should learn which hole goes there. :) Needless to say<br/>
I didn&#39;t make it in. Everfrost is also good at 17 (Fire & Ice<br/>
places eh?) but fairly devoid of things to kill except<br/>
spiders. *yawn*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I take it you&#39;re like me and like to sweep through dungeons<br/>
&gt; clearing as you go, instead of camping?  Find a group of<br/>
&gt; like-minded people and stick with them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been through 17 levels of my bard, 11 levels of my shaman,<br/>
7 levels of both my clerics (2) and wizard - and have yet to<br/>
find such a group. Sure, it&#39;s easy to find groups and I&#39;m<br/>
invited to them all the time - but I just don&#39;t like camping.<br/>
Maybe all of the Bards on this list could join the new <br/>
Tribunal server and be one big group. Heh.. Imagine the sight<br/>
of around 30 bards all strumming away in a big pack. Hehe<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; PS: I recently went to King Xorbbs Gorge (Beholder)<br/>
&gt; &gt; and loved it. It was new, it was the first time I<br/>
&gt; &gt; saw (killed) muddites and I was fairly safe. I of<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Beholder&#39;s Maze is supposed to be good around your level too.<br/>
&gt; I dunno, I visited once at 14 (way too crowded then), and<br/>
&gt; again when I was like 21 and most everything was green to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The time that I went there, it was a weekend and there was a<br/>
total of maybe 7-10 people there. (Probably camping the spot<br/>
for the item everyone camps for) I mostly stayed around the<br/>
Runnyeye zone area pulling Mino&#39;s and muddites back to there.<br/>
It was fairly entertaining. (Did I ever mention how quickly<br/>
blocks of clay and ore add to your weight?) All the goblins<br/>
are green, but the mino&#39;s and the muddites are still blue. The<br/>
loot (to me) was fairly decent for the level of difficulty. I<br/>
plan on going back if only to explore the maze further and<br/>
because I&#39;ve never seen an evil eye.</div>
