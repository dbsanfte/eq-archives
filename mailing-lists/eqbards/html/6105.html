Even though all this damage is applied in the same instant,<br/>
the animations happen sequentially, and thus the average pause<br/>
between animations becomes shorter simply because there are<br/>
more double attacks and dual wields.  Like I said, I have yet<br/>
to see any empirical evidence that their punches do in fact<br/>
get faster.<br/>
