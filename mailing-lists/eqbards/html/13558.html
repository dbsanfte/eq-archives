&gt; 1. I too will /feedback the surf-nerf every time I log on, which may<br/>
<br/>
Lots of folks are having the EQ Blues.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2. Great.  Now I can look forward to being a portable manastone.  Yay.<br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah kinda. Do you know what a mana stone is worth? And you can regen<br/>
5 casters where a stone can only do one at a time (yeah, they do get passed<br/>
around but still.)  Maybe it takes 35 to 40 levels for it to finally &#39;sink<br/>
in&#39; or maybe mid levels is where the classes are finally maturing into more<br/>
distinct entities and their roles in groups are better defined because they<br/>
have acquired their main powers.  And for bard that means a few specific<br/>
things:<br/>
<br/>
Primary:  Mana regen;  Melee buff (Berzerker Krashendo!  Woo hoo!); MR/CR/HR<br/>
buff.<br/>
<br/>
Secondary: Melee attack (&quot;with dual Yk&#39;s you do a fair amount of damage<br/>
[said in a surprized tone]&quot;); after combat healing; misc duties to supplant<br/>
a missing primary (crowd control, chain/snare/root, debuff.)<br/>
<br/>
And while it seems like you are &#39;forced&#39; into a niche, it really is an<br/>
important role.  Once you get to the point where you are in a group that has<br/>
synergy (the whole is greater than the sum of the parts), I think you will<br/>
be happy with the results.  A good, well balanced group that has experience<br/>
working together can do some amazing things (like survive so hairy fights<br/>
[&#39;OMG!  we lived!!!&#39;])  And 2 or 3 good groups working together can do some<br/>
amazing things. Dungeon crawl the old fashion way: Kedge Keep - 3 groups,<br/>
clear to the boss, win and gate out.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT un happy being the &quot;portable mana-stone&quot; at all.  My groups love<br/>
me!  &quot;Hooray!  we get the bard!!!&quot;  &quot;Oh good!  My bard is here!&quot; &quot;Great, we<br/>
will have lots less downtime now...&quot; &quot;King room looking for a Bard or<br/>
Enchanter!&quot;<br/>
