&gt;Since the &quot;Identify&quot; song (Lyssa&#39;s Cataloguing Libretto) is totally<br/>
&gt;useless, they will likely replace it someday.  What would YOU (as Bards)<br/>
&gt;like to see it replaced with?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No it isn&#39;t, and Verant won&#39;t be replacing the song.  I use Cataloging Lyric<br/>
often.  The items that are &quot;pending lore&quot; will be used with our song to<br/>
gather clues about the item, and those that already lore can be used with<br/>
this song.  For instance, in the brewer&#39;s compendium quest, you get an ogre<br/>
head instead of the compendium.  I used the song to find out just whose head<br/>
it was.<br/>
