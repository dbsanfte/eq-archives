&gt; &gt; I have probably solo&#39;ed a full half a bubble (I hate solo&#39;ing) of all my<br/>
&gt; &gt; XP<br/>
&gt; &gt; gained to level 30.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; 	Even levels 1-5?  I didn&#39;t start grouping at level 4, I think, and<br/>
&gt; for the most part have grouped constantly throughout (though I do try<br/>
&gt; soloing every now and then, it&#39;s not a significant amount of my total xp)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a special case.  My wife started her first character, a warrior, when I<br/>
started my bard and my brother-in-law started his third character, a<br/>
Paladin, all at the same time.  I did levels 1 through 5 grouped with them.<br/>
My first character is a retired level 21 mage that I haven&#39;t logged on with<br/>
in months and consider retired.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; A side note:  I usually always ask that any bard (including myself) only<br/>
&gt; &gt; weave 2 MR songs when doing MR.  Missing a note and dropping<br/>
&gt; one of the MR<br/>
&gt; &gt; songs can be to devistating to risk that possibility.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; 	My usualy strategy for this, is to make those 2 the most important.<br/>
&gt; In other words, I&#39;ll try and do 3 songs, but if I miss a note on anthem,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll skip it and restart 1st MR song, then 2nd MR song, then try Anthem<br/>
&gt; again.  Or if I miss a note of 2nd MR song, restart 2nd MR song,<br/>
&gt; go back to<br/>
&gt; 1st MR song and repeat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to try this, but in my parties, which are usually tank heavy, so much<br/>
is flying by in the chat window that I&#39;m already at information overload.<br/>
Maybe I should turn on some of those filters...  Nah, I can&#39;t stand to miss<br/>
something :-).  It wouldn&#39;t be the same if I didn&#39;t throw in that &quot;Nice<br/>
Crit!!&quot; comment here or there.<br/>
