  My point being, we&#39;re investigating a case here.<br/>
<br/>
  I am dedicated to objectivity and common sense, while still <br/>
  staying open to extreme possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
  Clearly, if a one weapon makes the difference in the ability <br/>
  to tackle a hill giant by oneself, you would question whether<br/>
  that class itself is balanced in relation to the npc.  Most <br/>
  warriors are not wielding Monsoon, Sword of the Swiftwind.<br/>
<br/>
  If Bladestorm or Monsoon are the turning point in the battle,<br/>
  then I&#39;m not sure it becomes the class&#39; skill which is winning,<br/>
  rather an extremely rare highpowered weapon which is winning.<br/>
<br/>
  If I had Bardstorm, Sword of the Asskicking I could probably <br/>
  solo a hill giant too. ;-)<br/>
