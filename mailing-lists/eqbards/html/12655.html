<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753886374">Taken from the everquest.com Gameplay forum, Abashi&#39;s thread &quot;Necromancers <br/>
and Feign Death: Decision&quot;... this is Abashi responding to some responses to <br/>
his post:<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
Notice it says no ´┐¢direct save´┐¢. This means they don´┐¢t roll versus feign. <br/>
What they get is what amounts to an intelligence check, which every creature <br/>
gets for these ´┐¢I´┐¢m going to fool you so you don´┐¢t attack me´┐¢ abilities and <br/>
spells. It&#39;s a very low chance. All cases of direct saves have a much higher <br/>
percentage of the creature saving.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
What this seems to be saying is that any spell/effect which &quot;fools&quot; <br/>
creatures can be overcome by an intelligence check.  Since invisibility <br/>
&quot;fools&quot; monsters into thinking you&#39;re not there, it seems to me this would <br/>
account for the reason invisibility (whether bardic or from a caster) fails <br/>
occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in situations where I was attacked (e.g.) by GIBS in Lower Guk, <br/>
when my Invis to Undead was still up (well, until they hit me), or where <br/>
(e.g.) I was attacked by silly lil&#39; ice gobbies in Permafrost while my <br/>
(druid-cast) invisibility was still up (well, until they hit me).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, just thought I might have found, accidentally, a reason for one of <br/>
the great mysteries of EQ life - why did they attack me when I was <br/>
invisible?<br/>
