are usually not above lying about how many they&#39;ve sold at<br/>
that price in order to sway you into paying it thinking you&#39;re<br/>
getting a fair deal when they&#39;re ripping you off.  The stones<br/>
are too common to sell economically at 100pp.  I usually find<br/>
2-3 in a night fighting giants solo.  If I sat around waiting<br/>
around for someone to buy one for 100pp, I&#39;d end up letting<br/>
the other two rot because they are lore.<br/>
<br/>
No high level bard I know pays for the stones - it&#39;s way too<br/>
easy to get them via normal play.  I talked my guild into a<br/>
Rathe expedition to get stones.  We got 8 that night, but now<br/>
I realize it was unnecessary.  I have all but two pieces of<br/>
lambent armor, and we still have like 10 stones behind held by<br/>
guildmembers, most picked up in subsequent &quot;regular&quot; play.  I<br/>
suspect the people driving up the price, if they really are<br/>
selling for 100pp, are low level folks who somehow have<br/>
amassed large amounts of plat (trade skills, pie sketch<br/>
exploit, indirect twinking, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Hang around Rathe, offer to trade plat for gold (HGs tend to<br/>
drop 5x as much gold as plat and it gets heavy quick, but<br/>
charismatic bards can convert it back to plat at a 10% loss by<br/>
buying/selling combine weapons at the gypsies), sell weapons,<br/>
etc.  I&#39;ve seen just as many stones /auctioned as &quot;free on<br/>
corpse&quot; as I&#39;ve seen for sale.<br/>
