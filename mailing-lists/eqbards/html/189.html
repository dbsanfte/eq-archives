<b>Subject:</b> Easy Money with Bard Quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-661192629">I am pleased to provide a little detail about the bard quest in Kelethin and<br/>
how to make a little cash. Now there is no reason to be totally destiture as<br/>
long as you can get to Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I bought-out all the spiderling-silk in Freeport and it&#39;s<br/>
environs. It cost me a little over 2 silver pieces each, so the expense is<br/>
not too demanding. I filled eight backpacks and placed tham in the bank (64<br/>
silks). I then filled-up six more that I carried on me. This left two for my<br/>
own personal belongings.<br/>
<br/>
The trip to Kelethin was uneventful. By playing my drum, the trip went<br/>
rather quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Upon meeting with my &quot;foreign&quot; elf guildmaster, I exchanged the silks for<br/>
gold and drums. Each set of four silks (cost about 1gp) nets 1gp in reward<br/>
and a drum worth about 2.6gp to me. A total of 28 transactions were<br/>
completed. The net cash to me was about 72gp. Not bad for a little<br/>
scavenging. The other &quot;incidental&quot; benefits are the increased faction<br/>
standing with the bards group and the 1/2 bubble of experience I gained.<br/>
