&gt; <br/>
&gt; As several people have noted, one cause of overcrowding is a higher level<br/>
&gt; character soloing in a spot designed for a group of lower level characters.<br/>
&gt; One level 50 camping Item X takes a potential spawn area from a group of<br/>
&gt; level 20&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Potential solution:  Magical items don&#39;t drop if the character doesn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; any experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; + reduces farming<br/>
&gt; + reduces twinking<br/>
&gt; + frees up spawns for appropriate level groups<br/>
&gt; - forces you to get an item before you gain a certain level<br/>
&gt; - forces you to trade for an item you can&#39;t get yourself<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any comments?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems like a nice idea.  I was thinking about it myself earlier.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
what you do about the situation where a group kills stuff and some earn experience <br/>
from it while others don&#39;t.  (A &quot;group&quot; can be two people, one L50 and one L1, for <br/>
that matter.)  No drops if ANY of the people getting credit don&#39;t get EXP?  I just <br/>
don&#39;t know.  And even if you do that, it doesn&#39;t stop an L50 from helping a low-level <br/>
group in ways that don&#39;t let him get credit, then looting afterwards.  I just don&#39;t <br/>
know...<br/>
