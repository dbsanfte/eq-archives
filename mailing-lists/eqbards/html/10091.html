It&#39;s simply the design of the game that people your level<br/>
aren&#39;t supposed to be getting lambent armor.  If you don&#39;t<br/>
like it, then either you need to gain a few more levels, or<br/>
you&#39;re playing the wrong game.  If you&#39;re suggesting that you<br/>
deserve the armor at L22, then I suggest you email Verant<br/>
stating your reasons why you think a L22 bard should be able<br/>
to complete some relatively simple quests for armor that in<br/>
some cases is better than that dropped by L35-40 mobs.<br/>
<br/>
What people are really griping about is that there are in fact<br/>
ways around the in-game limitations to what &quot;level&quot; of<br/>
equipment you can obtain.  We&#39;ve got a bunch of people who<br/>
like to play the work-for-everything-you-get game, and a bunch<br/>
of people who like to play the monty-haul-start-off-with-the-<br/>
best-of-everything game.  Unfortunately, we all have them<br/>
playing in the same universe.  If you were playing a pen and<br/>
paper RPG and found the group playing in a style you didn&#39;t<br/>
like, you&#39;d pack up and find another group.  That&#39;s where the<br/>
resentment and bitterness comes from.<br/>
<br/>
That and Verant only taking half-measures to clearly define<br/>
exactly what type of game they want.  This is another of those<br/>
all-or-nothing issues.  Either you place no restrictions on<br/>
those wanting to play monty-haul, or you do everything you can<br/>
to stop them.  Taking half-measures like proc level limits and<br/>
making some items no-drop just legitimizes the gripes of<br/>
anti-monty-haul players, while not really getting in the way<br/>
of monty-haul players.  You create an issue where none<br/>
would&#39;ve existed in-game if you&#39;d gone the all-or-nothing<br/>
route.<br/>
