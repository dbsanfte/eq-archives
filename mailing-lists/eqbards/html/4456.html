&gt; Some bards on the list have said that charm is the greatest thing since<br/>

&gt; try to continually &quot;recharm&quot; the creature, this works a little better, but I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s your charisma?  Charm consistently lasts 3 pulses for<br/>
me (120 chr).  I charm something, order it to attack, switch<br/>
to Hymn (or Anthem if my party is busy fighting something<br/>
else), then back off.  When both mobs start to run towards me,<br/>
I know the charm is up, and usually I have enough time to<br/>
charm it again before it reaches me.  My timing is getting<br/>
good enough that I don&#39;t even have to run back now - I just<br/>
hit charm again a short while before it&#39;s supposed to be up,<br/>
and the mobs gets at most one hit on me.  Mind you I do take<br/>
damage, but usually not enough that Hymn with a lute can&#39;t<br/>
patch up while I&#39;m waiting for charm to expire again.<br/>

&gt; song?  You have to target the creature you want to strike, then NO ONE can<br/>
&gt; hit it while it is in lala land, or it wakes up.  What this means is<br/>
&gt; effectively to keep a monster out of the fight I have to keep it targeted<br/>
&gt; and continually sing pixie strike at it, and not attack anything else.  Why<br/>
&gt; not use lullaby (aside from the obvious area effect dangers) and just have<br/>
&gt; everyone in the party attack the same MOB?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Like charm, Pixie Strike consistently lasts 3 pulses for me.<br/>
That hasn&#39;t been the case with Lullaby - a lot of mobs seem to<br/>
wake up immediately or before three pulses are up with<br/>
Lullaby.  When fighting a single mob, I use Strike to pause<br/>
the battle while I weave Hymn so my party can heal up.  When<br/>
fighting multiple mobs, I use it to pause one or two mobs<br/>
while the party works on the other(s).  It&#39;s very useful in<br/>
buggy places like Mistmoore where an area effect song/spell<br/>
too close to a wall can get a bunch of level 40+ mobs casting<br/>
at you through the walls, or where there&#39;s a lot of &quot;green<br/>
trash&quot; wandering around.<br/>
