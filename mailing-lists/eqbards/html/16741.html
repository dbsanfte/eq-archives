<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161005275">I don&#39;t know if those of you that keep proposing songs that use mana are aware of these facts:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Bards meditate never goes above 10 skill<br/>
2)  Bards are immune to the effects of Clarity and Manasong<br/>
3)  Bards don&#39;t have very much mana to begin with<br/>
<br/>
I bring these points up because our mana is very limited.  We already have one song that burns our entire mana bar.  I really don&#39;t want to see _any_ of our songs using mana.  We are already horribly restricted in that we can only keep 2, 3 or (for those with powerhouse systems) 4 songs running at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t propose mana costs in our songs unless you also propose that our meditate cap be removed and our immunity to clarity effects be removed.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally I play a bard because I don&#39;t have/need to meditate.  I _loathe_ sitting on my can waiting for mana.  I stopped playing casters completely because of it and once my ranger hit 34th I got so sick of it I started another bard on Rallos.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
