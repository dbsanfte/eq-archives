<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992852992">Bought mine for 4.5kpp on Tarew Marr.  The shield is a 9 pt shield that doesn&#39;t stack with thorn type shields, but still stacks with ours.  It lasts about 5 minutes (about a fight and a half : ), and has about a 5 second casting time.<br/>
<br/>
Something I&#39;ve noticed on Bards and using items....&#39;cause we&#39;re bards we can activate items while moving etc, but I can&#39;t find a way for us to interupt the casting on an item (the others in my guild just move, crouch, or sit and it interrupts them...but none of those work for us).<br/>
<br/>
Also, for laughs, go out to third person sometime, and activate an illusion mask, then duck while it&#39;s still casting.  You&#39;ll get a very interesting look :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>#2) I have been thinking about trying to get a SS bracer, but really <br/>
do not want to put the time in the camp. EQ Prices has them listed in <br/>
the 2K-2.5K range, but a couple of my friends kinda laughed and said <br/>
I would be looking in the 10K-15K range┬à what is the price of the <br/>
bracer, and how good are they? (BTW, this is on Xegony.)</div>
