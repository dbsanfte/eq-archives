<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054523570">Hi everyone, I&#39;m an experienced player, but a newbie bard. I&#39;ve been waiting a long time to ask these questions, hoping they would answer themselves on the list, but I&#39;m still curious! (The list has of course answered MANY other questions I had.) The FAQ that was sent to the list earlier is really good, and answered a lot of things I was wondering about, perhaps these questions could be added to it. And yes, I looked in the archives, but they seem almost impossible to search.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here goes. Sorry if these have been gone over already to death. :P<br/>
<br/>
1. What are a bard&#39;s more important stats for playing songs? I&#39;ve heard Charisma is important - does it make it so the songs are more potent or so that they are resisted less?<br/>
<br/>
2. What is a good bard website?<br/>
<br/>
3. What is the best way to cycle songs? Basically what I&#39;m doing now is making a panel of hotkeys, then hitting 1 to start song, 1 again to stop, 2 to start second song, 2 to stop, etc. But I kind of got the impression from the list that using  a /stop hotkey might be faster? (It is almost impossible for more to cycle three songs.)<br/>
<br/>
4. Is it true bard 2h slash skill is capped at 1 (or something like that?)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm I guess that is it for now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance! :)<br/>
