&gt;I entered the lake (west commons) just enough to where I could see to the<br/>
&gt;bottom but before it changed the colors to dark (sorta like your head is<br/>
&gt;half-way in the water) and I didn&#39;t see anything down there. I did see some<br/>
&gt;large piranah&#39;s but that was about it. Am I missing something? It&#39;s<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah well, maybe they fixed it?  Nothing there I ever found, but as I swam<br/>
along the bottom, squinting my eyes in the murk, I somehow dropped through<br/>
the earth (although I hoped it was a future zone spot) and received a<br/>
message that I was being placed somewhere legal.  Perhaps you should explore<br/>
more other waters, and find a chest which actually says it&#39;s locked some<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t bother with Fear after completing a long broken quest which had<br/>
a payoff of a loss of factions, gold and time.  The idea of dying hard just<br/>
wouldn&#39;t save my feeling of digust with EQ at that point.<br/>
