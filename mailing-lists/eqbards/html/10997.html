<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000112308">This is exactly why we need a sit-in or other crusade here.  Apparently the<br/>
only way to get Verant&#39;s attention is to make a huge fuss.  One nerf in the<br/>
entire history of the game to monk&#39;s and they get a two page apology almost<br/>
instantly?  We get nada, no mention, no eta, no explanation, nothing.  It<br/>
isn&#39;t as if this is the first time they broke something concerning bards, or<br/>
nerfed it as I am still unwilling to take one GM&#39;s word as gospel on the<br/>
real motivation or lack thereof behind the change.  I have been bugging<br/>
Lullaby for 2 weeks now with no response.  I now continually see the same<br/>
things John(tm) was seeing earlier.  About 50% of the time Lullaby is not<br/>
resisted, that is a get a successful nods message, the song does absolutely<br/>
nothing.  I can nod a green Mob that is attacking or fleeing and 50% (or<br/>
more) of the time nothing will happen.  The Mob will continue to attack or<br/>
walk away despite my doing absolutely nothing else.  I know the song will<br/>
stop a walking away Mob in it&#39;s tracks when it nods it correctly because<br/>
that does happen nearly 50% of the time.  I have still had no response on<br/>
this.  I am not high enough level to Pixie Strike yet so I can&#39;t say on that<br/>
one, but John(tm) has reported the same problems with that song.  So what is<br/>
going on?  Did they decide that they wanted us to be resisted more, but knew<br/>
if we started seeing tons of resists that we&#39;d all throw a fit so instead<br/>
they just inserted some code that would give a song a % chance of having an<br/>
effect if it wasn&#39;t resisted?  Or is their coding just so suspect and their<br/>
testing so miniscule that this bug has slipped in unintentionally?  Who can<br/>
tell with these guys.  Its so obvious they don&#39;t even do minimal testing on<br/>
their changes, despite all their claims to the contrary, that you just can&#39;t<br/>
tell if the changes they make are intentional or hideous blunders.  I mean,<br/>
damn they didn&#39;t even realize Alenia&#39;s was broken till we complained for 6<br/>
months it didn&#39;t do anything.  Five minutes of testing showed Harmonic, not<br/>
only that it now did work, but even revealed some of the circumstances in<br/>
which its working appeared quirky.  Five whole minutes.  In his spare time<br/>
while at work.  If that little testing was required to show that the song<br/>
works, it shows how little testing they did to see if it did work in the<br/>
first place.  Zero, absolutely none.  If the application development team<br/>
here, or anywhere I have worked for that matter, worked in such a matter we<br/>
would all be sacked.  Every last one of us, without a second though or<br/>
minute&#39;s remorse.  In the business world, behavior like this is totally<br/>
unacceptable, and would not be allowed to continue.  Why is this not true at<br/>
Verant?  Either because their attitude is its just a game, bugs are not<br/>
really important and they can fix them when the players find them; or<br/>
because they are so busy patting themselves on the back for having a<br/>
successful product, they can&#39;t be bothered to actually spend time making<br/>
sure the quality of the product doesn&#39;t suffer every time they need to make<br/>
a change.  Verant has 300,000 customers.  Most software companies with 1/10<br/>
that number do 100x better at making certain that coding changes do not<br/>
adversely affect their product in unforeseen ways.  The job Verant does at<br/>
this is pathetic.  They come across as a bunch of kid-whiz programmers who<br/>
may be technically sound, but so disorganized and undisciplined they have no<br/>
idea what the changes they make to their code might do, and don&#39;t give it a<br/>
second thought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I can see why it slipped by.  They were changing ADM, and<br/>
whoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>
coded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>
it.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>
*every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>
the patch would be rather long in getting out.  That bug will likely<br/>
be fixed in the next patch.<br/>
