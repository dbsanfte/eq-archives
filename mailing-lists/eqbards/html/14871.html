<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441838145">Ack!!  I&#39;ve been duped again!  (damn erudite mind tricks)  I never said the<br/>
zone was complete,<br/>
 I just wanted Harm to know that yes indeed there was going to be a second<br/>
use for that optional<br/>
download button. And Talies, about this crystal ball, where can I buy one<br/>
eh?  Would it be worth<br/>
a full suit of lambent and say 500pp?  Come on....<br/>
<br/>
I did see apost that the Hole was soon to be up as well, and Abashi also<br/>
mentioned a third zone<br/>
on Odus that would be implemented.  He was very tight lipped about this one<br/>
though -- and no its<br/>
not Kerra Ridge - allegedly.<br/>
<br/>
So for now I will return to my lurker status :(<br/>

&gt; The crystal ball tells me much - first of all, this zone is not yet<br/>
&gt; complete.  Second, it appears full of rats, bats, beetles and kobolds, so<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; wonder about the &quot;high level&quot; concept - methinks it is actually for<br/>
&gt; low-level necros and such.  Third, any queries as to the nature of my<br/>
&gt; crystal ball shall be ignored ;)  It wouldn&#39;t be a mystery if I told you,<br/>
&gt; now would it?<br/>
