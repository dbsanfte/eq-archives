&gt; you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  If I stand there for a few seconds they do, like you said.<br/>
  They do not simply ignore me.  The post earlier made it seem<br/>
  like you could stroll in and never be attacked by the little<br/>
  goblins.  Any goblin starting with the word fire or inferno<br/>
  takes about a second or two to trigger, and all the others<br/>
  will still attack me regardless of anything.  It may take<br/>
  a few seconds but they still attack me, most definitely.<br/>
<br/>
  Some are easier to piss off than others, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
  But you&#39;ll never be able to stroll through this place like<br/>
  you can in Blackburrow for example.<br/>
