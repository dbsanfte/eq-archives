<div id="ygrps-yiv-275936753">I sure as heck didnt have the best equipment in the world. At the time I had<br/>
Black iron leggings, a basalt Carapace, Black Iron arms, bronze Bracers, elf<br/>
hide gloves, raw hid cloak and bronze boots with some +3 strength earrings<br/>

&gt; I soloed Gargoyles at level 23 With very few mishaps. I<br/>
&gt; twisted COD, DDD,<br/>
&gt; and Hymn. at 25 I found I killed the gargoyles faster with<br/>
&gt; weapons (shrug)<br/>
&gt; Silvery war axe and Black enameled mace.<br/>
&gt; I never had to kite the Gargoyles, but I did run from them<br/>
&gt; once, when I got<br/>
&gt; 4 of them<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, I must just be a wimpy bard then. :-P My equipment at the time wasn&#39;t<br/>
all that impressive, but it got a lot better after spending some time on<br/>
this island. :-)<br/>
<br/>
At 25 I usually found that I would do the COD,DDD,Hymn to start off with and<br/>
near his last bubble or so of health switch to Whistling/Chains/Hymn with<br/>
weaps as they started running away from me.<br/>
