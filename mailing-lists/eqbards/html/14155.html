<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943105772">My main character is on Vallon Zek, a Halfelf Bard named Catnip Silentpaws.<br/>
I would no way be on a regular server..  its way too boring for my taste.<br/>
I&#39;d rather always be on my toes..  it makes the game more exciting!  Sitting<br/>
in MM isn&#39;t as boring when a group of 20 Darkelves/Trolls/Ogres suddenly<br/>
attack!  All of your songs suddenly gain seconds uses..  For instance<br/>
everyone on this list says how much Mel. Motion is a waste of a songbook<br/>
slot..  Its one of my most useful songs and is always memmed.  You can&#39;t hit<br/>
what you can&#39;t catch!  Well, for those of you who want to spice up your life<br/>
a little..  try it out.  Thats all!  ^_^;;<br/>

&gt; Pick-up groups in Blackburrow Paw or Crushbone suck. They continued to<br/>
suck<br/>
&gt; in Unrest. Ditto, Cazic. Sol-B. And Lower Guk.  People just don&#39;t change<br/>
&gt; much.  You get the kind that is so focused on loot that unless they are<br/>
&gt; getting loot - they are sure someone else is stealing it from them.  They<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t trust others because they project their own personality traits.  On<br/>
&gt; our server, we have recent reports of a guy in lower guk stealing off a<br/>
&gt; party member who has died and has given consent to drag. Instead of<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; better at high levels - it seems like it gets worse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In reality, it&#39;s just the same idiots but instead of level 5, they are<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; 50.  Do you honestly expect that someone is going to have major<br/>
personality<br/>
&gt; changes in like 6 to 9 months simply by playing a computer game? Granted<br/>
&gt; some do, but for the most part - they don&#39;t. Any power they get just<br/>
&gt; enhances already ingrained traits.  Simply a guild does not cure this<br/>
&gt; either.  There are plenty of guilds with bickering about loots.  But if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; are guilded and you are with your guild group, at least you know what to<br/>
&gt; expect and you maybe have some standard loot rules.<br/>

&gt; first trip to the planes.  It was not a guild trip but a bunch of people<br/>
&gt; just going.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So my question is this... what do I do?  I know in the<br/>
&gt; future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more clear<br/>
rules<br/>
&gt; set up.  Does this happen on other servers?  Has this happened to any of<br/>

&gt; Subject: Mask of Deception and ultravision<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since DEs have innate ultravision, I was always under the impression that<br/>
&gt; when you activated the DE illusion with the Mask of Deception that you<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; supposed to gain this ability.  As a wood elf, I have infravision so can<br/>
&gt; normally see fine at night.  However, whenever I activate the DE illusion,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m blind as a bat (i.e. I lose infravision and don&#39;t gain ultravision).<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have had shamans buff me with the Ultravision spell and I have also had<br/>
&gt; magicians give me a Coldstone to equip so I know what Ultravision is<br/>
&gt; supposed to look like.  The difference at night when I have either of<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; two buffs versus the vision I have with the DE illusion is literally the<br/>
&gt; difference between night and day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So is the Mask of Deception supposed to also give you ultravision?  I have<br/>
&gt; talked with enchanters who regularly cast the DE illusion spell on<br/>
&gt; themselves so they can see at night.  Is it possible that this component<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the Mask of Deception is broken?<br/>

&gt; The Guise of the Deceiver did and still does give Ultravision. I am not<br/>
&gt; sure if the Guise of Deception does or not, I will try and check and get<br/>
&gt; back to you if no one posts an answer before then. The ultravision was a<br/>
&gt; big reason why everyone wanted a mask, and not just large races for it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; economy-shirnk effect (DE Form). Humans in particular got a real bonus<br/>
&gt; from the Ultravision.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I discovered the other day was that I cast the mask illusion and<br/>
&gt; got ultravision, but during the course of a fight I wove in psalm of<br/>
warmth<br/>
&gt; and when the song ended, poof, there went my ultravision.  I just recast<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; illusion and got the UV back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its annoying but it seems to work still, oh but this is with the pre-patch<br/>
&gt; mask too so this test doesn&#39;t really validate your question...it just<br/>
raises<br/>
&gt; a possible issue that I have experienced with respect to the affect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reminds me of when I used to have a shiny brass shield back in the olden<br/>
&gt; days and whenever I entered and exited water I would have to unequip and<br/>
&gt; re-equip the shield to get the lightsource effect back.  That was a royal<br/>
&gt; pain the wazoo when I went to innothule for the first time!<br/>

&gt; Subject: What I do when I get bored of the regular server<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings all,<br/>
&gt; What I do when I get bored is change to Vallon Zek, a pvp teams server.  I<br/>
&gt; am experimenting with a few different classes, but I have 2 bards at level<br/>
5<br/>
&gt; (started half-elf bard in Kelethin &lt;only place to start a half elf bard<br/>
&gt; there&gt;). I have 2 bards because I started a half elf bard first on the<br/>
first<br/>
&gt; week of release and couldn&#39;t get any Medium size armour in Kelethin.  So<br/>
&gt; that bard tweaked (hehe a level 5 tweaking a level 1) my Wood elf bard and<br/>
&gt; she leveled up quickly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The point is if some folks find that they get bored on their regular<br/>
server,<br/>
&gt; doing the same old same old, then try a pvp server.  I have decided to try<br/>
&gt; to make an Troll Shadow Knight now.  His mission will be to kill casters<br/>
&gt; (most casters are Human and Elf based).  He will be a sort of anti-PK<br/>
pk&#39;er.<br/>
&gt;   His MO will be to shadow step and hunt down those medding casters  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, ok....that is just an idea based on frustration, but it does add a<br/>
whole<br/>
&gt; new dimension to the game.  If you have friends or guildmates that you<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; convince to meet you with you on a pvp server, then you could watch each<br/>
&gt; other&#39;s backs, and hunt PC&#39;s and NPC&#39;s alike.  And be hunted :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am now level 40 on Cazic Thule server, and quite sick of waiting lists<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the like.  I also have a hard time with the Hill Giants, because I get<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; fighting and some group or other will move in and kill em off for me<br/>
  I<br/>
&gt; just want a short diversion.  Nothing permanent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone else have a secondary character on the pvp servers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fflewduer Fflamson 40 Cazic-Thule<br/>
&gt; Aria 5 Vallon Zek<br/>
&gt; Brushof SK lvl 1 Vallon Zek  (should he be a REALLY bad Troll and lay<br/>
waste<br/>
&gt; to medding casters?)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well this is definately strange because it isn&#39;t working for me.  I was in<br/>
&gt; Ogguk fighting bouncers near the zone when I activated the illusion.<br/>
There<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t a light source there so it became very dark.  When I told my party I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t see anymore, the shaman buffed me with Ultravision and I could<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; see very well.  The ultravision buff from the shaman gave everything a<br/>
&gt; bluish tint to it so thats how I knew that the DE illusion wasn&#39;t working.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The end result is that I hardly ever activate the illusion anymore.  Only<br/>
&gt; reason I do it in Ogguk is so I can sell to the merchant with an amiable<br/>
&gt; /con.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Splitting Spawns using Lament -  Pumice - Resists<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have had some threads regarding Fire Giants and their resistance to<br/>
certain<br/>
&gt; spells and songs.  I cannot remember if we covered all of these questions,<br/>
and I<br/>
&gt; have missed about a week&#39;s worth of posts, so please bear with me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I split the frenzied room in Lower Guk last night with Lament (to the<br/>
amazement of<br/>
&gt; some group members, by the way, who said the frenzied _always_ comes - go<br/>
bards!!).<br/>
&gt; I am level 48 and the frenzied is only about 45 I think.  I have pulled<br/>
Sol B king<br/>
&gt; area; it is no problem with Lament.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have not tried to split the Lord room in Lower, although it is quite<br/>
open and<br/>
&gt; would be easy to try.  The King room is a different story.  Seems you<br/>
would have to<br/>
&gt; invis into the room to get into a position to even try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, the group of 4 fire giants in Sol B - I know they cannot be<br/>
mesmerized.  Is<br/>
&gt; lament the same spell type and thus also not applicable?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another question relating to pulling. John, you have used pumice<br/>
extensively.  What<br/>
&gt; is its range?  I hear it is quite large.  Now that debuffing causes a mob<br/>
to aggro,<br/>
&gt; could you use the pumice as a ranged weapon with which to pull?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Comments and suggestions about pulling higher level areas are welcome 8).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally, I felt sick to my stomach as I saw the second resist messages<br/>
flow when I<br/>
&gt; tried out Pixie and Lullaby in Lower Guk Frenzied area last night.  They<br/>
seem<br/>
&gt; useless songs now.<br/>

open<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be easy to try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is very doable. I&#39;ve done it two times now. Put 8 minutes between<br/>
each<br/>
&gt; pull so that there was a nice spread between fights and we pulled all<br/>
night.<br/>
&gt;   I lost all the lottos though. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also, the group of 4 fire giants in Sol B - I know they cannot be<br/>
&gt; &gt;mesmerized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know about Lament and the fire giants (we had a monk pulling for<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; the 2 times I did this), but Pixie Strike worked on the fire giants. Tenya<br/>
&gt; kept one giant out of the fight while we killed Skarlon. I had always<br/>
heard<br/>
&gt; that mez didn&#39;t work on them too until I saw it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So my question is this... what do I do?  I know in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;future I&#39;m not looting a thing and that we should have had more clear<br/>
rules<br/>
&gt; &gt;set up.  Does this happen on other servers?  Has this happened to any of<br/>
&gt; &gt;you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since Martyr decided to steal the Dawnfire off Cazic Thule&#39;s corpse this<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; been a big issue on our server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It happened again in Fear the other night when one ranger looted some<br/>
ranger<br/>
&gt; greaves even though he lost the lotto.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because of these two incidents, those who would normally be completely<br/>
&gt; rational go a little overboard when someone doesn&#39;t do something as quick<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; they expected it. Its truly sad that these two individuals have made it<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; difficult to go on any planes run unless you join a power guild because of<br/>
&gt; loot stealing issues and its made people who are normally very nice into<br/>
&gt; people who trust no one and are looking for conspiracy at every turn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m assuming that most decided that this theft never actually occurred<br/>
&gt; though because its not plastered all over the solusekro.org message boards<br/>
&gt; so I think you are in the clear.<br/>

&gt; Fire giants are special in that you have to be in melee range to cast on<br/>
&gt; them.  And do to how they agro there would be no way to do this :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The cancel magic series is now an &#39;aggressive spell&#39; and will cause agro<br/>

are.<br/>
&gt; Its possible that the ultravision works for humans (who only have normal<br/>

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; back in April).  Lake is no problem, even get the group all sing &quot;Come<br/>
&gt; &gt; sail away&quot; on the boat.  (I love getting the messages to stop spamming<br/>
&gt; &gt; the /ooc channel). &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ugh! I&#39;m one of those people who find this stuff to be annoying. I mean,<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re doing it on /say or /group that&#39;s fine, but IMO (nothing humble<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; it) it is obnoxious to broadcast this stuff and revel in the complaints.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But in your favor, at least you&#39;re doing it on ooc where I can turn this<br/>
&gt; off. :-P I really hate when people do this stuff on shout, which is<br/>
&gt; necessary for train updates. *Windleaf ducks the pie thrown by Papa*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am not saying this to bash Verant, to try to get you to<br/>
&gt; &gt; quit or try to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get you to convince me to keep playing (I have neglected too<br/>
&gt; &gt; much RL for<br/>
&gt; &gt; this game).  Verant as a whole did a great job with this<br/>
&gt; &gt; game.  Perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; thats the problem, it is so tantalizing close to greatness that its<br/>
&gt; &gt; short-comings glare so brightly.  Most of the people playing are fun,<br/>
&gt; &gt; polite, and enhance the experience.  However they only make the<br/>
&gt; &gt; obnoxious players a little harder to ignore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve gone through this type of depression before. But once I got DDD at<br/>
&gt; level 18, I switched to all instruments for soloing and had an absolute<br/>
&gt; blast. Also, for me, nothing gets me back into the game like shopping.<br/>
&gt; Getting a new weapon or piece of armor always gets me going, and once you<br/>
&gt; hit level 20, you can start hunting gargoyles on Spectre island in OOT<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; a partner. At level 23 you can start soloing them with your all instrument<br/>
&gt; attack and earn enough money to seriously upgrade your weaps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well until Diablo II makes it to the shelves, &quot;See you around&quot;<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been waiting for this for a few years and will be shocked when<br/>
Blizzard<br/>
&gt; finally does release this. It&#39;s gotten to the point where I&#39;m pretty<br/>
&gt; non-chalant about it. I was real excited for this to be released early<br/>
last<br/>
&gt; year. Let&#39;s see if they do indeed release it as expected.<br/>

&gt; Do you use Psalm of Warmth? A tank told me last week he hates when bards<br/>
&gt; use this, because it kills Ultravision, whether it be the spell or the<br/>
&gt; guise effect (he is a 50 warrior with a guise of the deceiver). I forgot<br/>
&gt; to check this, and he wasn&#39;t 100% sure which song it was. He simply said<br/>
&gt; &quot;the song that puts up the wimpy damage shield that&#39;s a cold resist<br/>
&gt; buff&quot; ;P. I&#39;ve noted a large number of bards like to play this song for<br/>
&gt; the damage shield in the L30s range. Perhaps if you are doihng so, this<br/>
&gt; is the cause of your problem.<br/>
