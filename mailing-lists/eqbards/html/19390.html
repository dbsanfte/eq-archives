&gt; Sylly shouts to the zone, &quot;Did you see the login message??? <br/>
&gt; Littering zones<br/>
&gt; with foraged items is now a BANNABLE offense!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Is it still OK to litter the landscape with stacks of several hundred<br/>
copper?&quot; asked the poor, encumbered bard scouring the zone for free money<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sylly tells the guild, &quot;Did you see Gordon&#39;s latest post??? They have<br/>
&gt; discovered that some players are killing NPC&#39;s purely for exp <br/>
&gt; and getting<br/>
&gt; levels.  After the next patch, you will no longer get *any* <br/>
&gt; exp from killing<br/>
&gt; NPC&#39;s.  All exp will be earned through quests only.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, then they&#39;d have to fix the broken quests. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; p.s. level 51 is bad, real bad, really really bad.  But now I <br/>
&gt; am done and 52<br/>
&gt; seems a bit better.<br/>
