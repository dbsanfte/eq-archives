 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I was thinking.  So next question, where do you get them?<br/>
Froglok&#39;s I&#39;m figuring.  But can I get them in the swap (one of the few<br/>
zones left that I really want to see someday) or do I have to go into one of<br/>
the Guks?  I&#39;ll settle for woven or mesh if I can&#39;t get them solo at level<br/>
10 or 11.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the info!<br/>
