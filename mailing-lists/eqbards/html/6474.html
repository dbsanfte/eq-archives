<b>Subject:</b> What have people seen change with the patch? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329861601">Apparently there&#39;s been a lot of unannounced changes with the last patch.<br/>
Just wondering what new things people have seen/noticed.  I&#39;m not looking to<br/>
hear complaints about this being nerfed and that being ruined.  Just<br/>
wondering what funky new stuff people have seen like Shadow Men, mushrooms<br/>
and cabbages.  Also any changes that we, as bards should watch out for.<br/>
