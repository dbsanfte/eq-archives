<div id="ygrps-yiv-429593656">We managed to kill VS last night (for the first time as a guild), despite the bouncing HP problem.<br/>
Although it really ticked off the Clerics.  He dropped Bard pants!  (I didn&#39;t get them, but I moved up to<br/>
first in line.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; ROFL, EVERYTHING was messed up last night.. sounds were<br/>
&gt; &gt; distorted, health<br/>
&gt; &gt; bars showing 2% heath when you hadn&#39;t even taken a hit.. my<br/>
&gt; &gt; stomach even got<br/>
&gt; &gt; upset from the weird sounds... some people had gamma<br/>
&gt; &gt; problems, etc.  Hoping<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they fix this today<br/>
