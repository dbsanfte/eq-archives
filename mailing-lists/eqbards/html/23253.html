<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049066553">The overhead view is much less laggy, and I find it easier to do crowd control that way, anyway, except in<br/>
really big, messy fights.  I&#39;ve got timing down now well enough that I can twist 3.5 (BoH) to 4.5 songs<br/>
without anything dropping, even if it&#39;s muddy.  Big events (dragons and stuff), it&#39;s 2-3.<br/>
