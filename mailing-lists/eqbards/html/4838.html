&gt; Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but with a group of people that high up in level<br/>

spread at which you stop getting experience is actually based<br/>
on a fixed percentage of total experience (scaled to account<br/>

So the difference between level 5 and 9 is something like 80%,<br/>
but the difference between 20 and 27 is 35%.<br/>

I&#39;m level 30, and a level 22 friend grouped with me was making<br/>
experience at about the same rate I was.  Probably because<br/>
most of the stuff we were fighting that was blue to me was<br/>
yellow/red to him.  So he was getting a smaller piece of the<br/>
total experience, but that total experience was huge compared<br/>
to what he would&#39;ve gotten grouped with other 22s and fighting<br/>
what to them were blue.<br/>
