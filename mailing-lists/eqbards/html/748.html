&gt; That is correct.  I often will buy several songs ahead and drop them in my<br/>
&gt; bankbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I told one person this, I was warned that if I were to die, I&#39;d loose<br/>
&gt; my songs.  Wrong.  Believe me, I&#39;d be out lots of pp by now.  You don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; loose songs, either in bank or in your backpack, when you die.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You did used to lose songs if you died.  I have heard that as long as<br/>
the song is in a backpack or other container, it will not disappear, but<br/>
the rumour I heard is that if it is in the base level of your inventory,<br/>
it will still disappear.<br/>
