<div id="ygrps-yiv-632177779">Heh, ya really does depend on what you are fighting.  I have been fighting<br/>
stuff that is 50-53 (ok, me and 23 of my fiends have).  Last night my cleric<br/>
asked me to play mana song only when in melee and asked a warrior to stop<br/>
taunting (me 48 and war 47; mob 52+).  He said it was just too hard keeping<br/>
us alive.  That seemed to reduce the &#39;attention&#39; I got from the mobs while<br/>
contributing my slashes for 10 and 12.  I switched my Yk to off-hand to<br/>
*reduce* the amount of procs.  Yes, even though it getst resisted, it still<br/>
does 75dd worth of taunt.  And when the Gorg or whatever finally decided to<br/>
pay attention to me: hits YOU for 320; hits YOU for 412; kicks YOU for 68!<br/>
Have a nice round!  My bar would blip down 2 bubs in a flash.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I might even try 6 Note and Dragoon Dirk just to avoid that proc<br/>
taunt.<br/>

p.s. we speculate that the hate list is pretty short.  so we move everyone<br/>
into melee range in hopes that peeps are moved on to and off of the hate<br/>
list as much as possible.  talk about bard hate?  one of our enchanters died<br/>
fast one time and all she did was cast rune 3 or 4 on herself - no melee, no<br/>
nuking - just buffing and whammo!  Down she went.  In fact, she died lots<br/>
more than i did (i may have gone the whole night with either 0 or only 1<br/>
death.)<br/>

&gt; Depends on what you are fighting.  Heck, I was in a group with 2 mages, an<br/>
&gt; enchanter, a druid, and a shaman on seafury island and I still had time<br/>
&gt; during the battles to get 4 to 5 procs in with my YK and 1 to 2 with my<br/>
&gt; Kisch. </span></blockquote></div>
