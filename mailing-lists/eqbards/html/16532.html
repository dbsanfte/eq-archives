<div id="ygrps-yiv-559715247">ok, some quick thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From: &quot;Elijah Meeker&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:elijah@...">elijah@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just made 26 and couldn&#39;t train Instil Doubt in Freeport (though it was<br/>
&gt; late I was tired and I think I didn&#39;t check the other guildmaster), no<br/>
&gt; biggie, I need to go to Kelethin to buy Screech anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I think it&#39;s from the master at the very top?  The room with the guy<br/>
and the girl.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, just want to make sure that I am headed in the right direction, based<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; what I am reading on this list I am selling my stat boosting items that<br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; me over 100 and replacing them with AC, I also traded my Kobold Hide boots<br/>
&gt; for a Staff of Writhing (I know, it won&#39;t proc for two more levels but it<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; better than my polished granite Tomahawk). The charisma hit was no fun, it<br/>
&gt; takes me to 98 chr, but I will probably strade a +3str earing for a +?<br/>
&gt; charisma earing and be fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have about 400pp now (though barefoot :o) still have to sell the PGT,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; trying to decide on armour choices, I can&#39;t play a lot, and when I do will<br/>
&gt; probably solo, so my money situation is not going to skyrocket, here are<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; partially informed ideas, all suggestions are very welcome.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Before I get into specific peices, you seem to be forgetting bronze.<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s ugly, but it&#39;s easy to get and cheap to buy.  A bit heavy for a<br/>
wood elf, but go bronze before you go steel.<br/>
<br/>
	You&#39;re also neglecting Lambent.  Quite a few of the quest items are<br/>
available at your level.  They&#39;re a bit expensive, but not as bad as steel.<br/>
Plus some have decent modifiers on them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Arms:<br/>
&gt; Keeping my Barbed Armplates: (AC 7. +2 Dexterity), Steel Vambraces: (AC 8)<br/>
&gt; only get me 1 AC<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I kept Barbed over bronze for a long time, but you can look at<br/>
bronze or Lambent, both pretty easy I think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Back:<br/>
&gt; Figure I will keep my Lizardscale Cloak: (AC 8 + 5 to Dexterity), at level<br/>
&gt; 17 I did comedy standup (died once, lizzies do NOT get social commentary<br/>
&gt; humor) for about 2 hours at Cazic Zone until someone sold me it for 80pp.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; think I made a third of that banking at the same time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	You&#39;ll keep the lizzie cloak for a long time, unless you get really<br/>
lucky.  Plan on staying with it till 40 or so.  I got lucky with a seahorse<br/>
scale cloak at about level 30ish :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Chest:<br/>
&gt; I still have a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic: (AC 12, +8 to heat, cold and magic<br/>
&gt; protection.) which frankly is still nice for pulling with it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; resists..but<br/>
&gt; that AC hit is hurting...so, not having 1kpp for a Brigandine Tunic (and<br/>
&gt; however much for a Mithril) I am thinking Steel Breastplate (AC 17)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	The Lambent might be difficult, but bronze will give you 17 AC as<br/>
well, of course it&#39;s really heavy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Face:<br/>
&gt; Until my dream of a Mask of Deception dreams come true I am going to stick<br/>
&gt; with my bronze mask, I don&#39;t see a huge benefit to steel<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	You could also think about jewlery here.  I have a +7 CHA mask, just<br/>
waiting on the upgrade to Mask of Deception +9 CHA<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Feet:<br/>
&gt; Of course I would love Dwarven Work Boots: (AC 8 STR+3, DEX+5) but though<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have no idea what they go for I am guessing it is too rich for my blood,<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; Steel Boots (AC 8) seems the thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Once again, if you can take the extra weight, go for bronze.  The<br/>
Lambent boots are usually hard to get, but if you can get in a decent group<br/>
in the King room of SolA, you might get lucky.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hands:<br/>
&gt; Gah, I love my Elf Hide Gloves (I checked, it is no one I know :o) (AC 4.<br/>
&gt; +5<br/>
&gt; desterity, +5 Agility) but if I can keep my dex and agi above 100 I am<br/>
&gt; going<br/>
&gt; to go for Plate gauntlets (AC 9), or, I suppose, if they don&#39;t cost a<br/>
&gt; fortune Shin Gauntlets ( AC 7. +5 poison)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Keep the Elf Hide or try for Lambent.  Or you could just use the<br/>
no-drop portion of the lambent quest, though they&#39;re a bit heavy too.  But<br/>
at least they&#39;re free :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Head:<br/>
&gt; I have a Blackened Iron Crown (AC 5. +5 Strength, and +5 each to poison,<br/>
&gt; fire, cold, disease and magic resistances) but am thinking I would start<br/>
&gt; saving for the (Crested Helm: AC 10. +6 st, +3 char) or at least a Fine<br/>
&gt; Silk<br/>
&gt; Turban (AC 10, SV Fire +10) though, and I know this places me in the<br/>
&gt; extreme<br/>
&gt; minority, I *like* the Bird-Head look of a metal helm on a Wood Elf. There<br/>
&gt; is also a Griffon Helm (AC 10. +9 str, +5 agil).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Hmm..  I like the resistances on that BI Crown, I might need to swap<br/>
it out on occasion for my Lambent.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Legs:<br/>
&gt; I am thinking of keeping my Barbed Legplates (AC 8. +2 Agility) until I<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; get Silver-Plated Leggings (AC 10. +3 strength, +5 agility)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Wow, you have expensive tastes :)  Again, go for bronze or Lambent,<br/>
IMO<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Neck:<br/>
&gt; Ack, finally goingto give up that Spiked Collar (AC 3. +3 to Strength) and<br/>
&gt; go with a Steel Collar (AC 6)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Can get bronze or some +CHA jewlery here as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Shoulders:<br/>
&gt; Love the Bloodstained Mantle: (AC 6. +3 to strength, +10 magic protection)<br/>
&gt; and I am rueing the day I sold the Crested Spaulders (AC 11, +6 stamina) I<br/>
&gt; had bought for *80pp* of a hurried fellow in Freeport bank.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Aye, I have one of both, but opt for the crested almost all the time<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Waist:<br/>
&gt; Sticking with the Thick Leather Apron(AC 8), at 26 I figure the Thick<br/>
&gt; Banded<br/>
&gt; Belt:(AC 8, +15 strength) is a looong way away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	There&#39;s another belt, just for bards/rogues.  I forget the name now.<br/>
AC8, STR +5/Sta +5??  something along those lines anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wrist:<br/>
&gt; I have one Silver Plated Bracers (AC 7 +5 disease resistance, +5 poison<br/>
&gt; resistance) I figure I need another. No real contenders here...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Again, look into lambent, or another Silver Plated Bracer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Weapons:<br/>
&gt; Finally, to replace my Dragoon Dirk I will start looking for an Obsidian<br/>
&gt; Shard (Damage 6, Delay 25, Effect of Obsidian Shatter)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	I just recently got one of these.  They&#39;re pretty fun :)  Right now,<br/>
I use Obsidian in primary and Dragoon Dirk in my off hand.  I have a few<br/>
other weapons, but none of them seem to be signifigantly better, so I prefer<br/>
the speed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; With jewlery this should dramatically raise my AC and keep my stats all<br/>
&gt; around 100. Am I correct in thinking that this is the best approach at 26?<br/>
&gt; Any hints on prices would be greatly appreciated, and would make a lot of<br/>
&gt; people on Povar happy because I wouldn&#39;t keep offering to trade them a<br/>
&gt; 350pp<br/>
&gt; item for a 1-2Kpp item *laughs* criminy that is embarassing :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for any replies, I greatly appreciate it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tszaaz E&#39;Taurguin<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S. Has there ever been any sort of mention why at level 26 you get both<br/>
&gt; Screech and Instill Doubt? Was it just bad planning and they figured the<br/>
&gt; lesser of all evils was to give them at the same level? Seems odd...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
