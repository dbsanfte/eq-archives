&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t attempt to apply real world standards to EQ&#39;s <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It just irks me that they&#39;ll work on something like<br/>
&gt; kiting when things like camping and kill stealing are<br/>
&gt; such larger problems. Not to mention a bazillion other<br/>
&gt; complaints that people have with things in the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously they consider kiting more of a problem. Someone on Usenet was<br/>
claiming that they have fallen into a trap many bad PnP rpg gms do, that<br/>
of being at war with their players. This explains the ill thought out<br/>
nerfings of Permafrost, after the first party killed Lady Vox, and the<br/>
more recent multiple nerfings of the fear plane.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just too bad that Asheron&#39;s Call appears unlikely to give EQ enough<br/>
competition to put a huge dent in EQ&#39;s user base. There&#39;s nothing like<br/>
declining revenues to get game designers rethinking their priorities.<br/>
