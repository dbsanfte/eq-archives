<b>Subject:</b> My overcrowding solutuion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-901187329">This comes from a flippant comment from one of the VErant guys when<br/>
talking about over crowding. (They said somthing like we could just make<br/>
a world where all zones are lower guk, oasis,... etc...)<br/>
<br/>
Was that comment really that far from a good idea?  In EQ they have<br/>
decided that fun over rides reality in mud terms.  As opposed to UO<br/>
which tries to be more real (in my opinion less fun).  We have the tell<br/>
command, auc channels, guild channels, group hp bars on screen all<br/>
times, a consider command.  Thats a few reality based things we have<br/>
traded off to gain more fun (or ease of play).  I like every one (and<br/>
would make a few more if I was king of Norrath).<br/>
<br/>
Why dont they make a copy of the overcrowded zones?  For example Lower<br/>
Guk 1 and Lower Guk 2.  Carbon copies which you chose which one you go<br/>
into when you zone (Or make a second zone entrance, I dont care).<br/>
Programming wise this would be a breeaze, it would require more<br/>
hardware, but they need hardware for new servers anyway.  Perhaps<br/>
Crushbone, Lower Guk, Solusek B, Oasis would be the important ones to<br/>
double up.  Since Naggy should be unique (in their thinking, this will<br/>
be more of a problem in about a month when he will never be alive for<br/>
more than 30 minutes), perhaps he&#39;s only in Solusek B1.  Maybe if they<br/>
wanted to really do something fun, they&#39;d make a third dragon (nagy&#39;s<br/>
brother) for Solusek B2.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be offended by this?  It would help to bring their dungeon<br/>
crawl vision to reality, and I am willing to sacrafice a little more<br/>
realism for a lot more fun (IMO)...<br/>
