<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934876832">i can&#39;t deny the possibility.  i hope, however, that it is either &quot;just let<br/>
them do it already&quot; or &quot;no never&quot; hehe.  if binding is as complex as some of<br/>
these posts hope for, it just doesn&#39;t seem worth it.  i think that people&#39;s<br/>
imagination is going wild in order to make it as complex as possible just in<br/>
case it will be hard enough for verant to say &quot;OK&quot; and change the policy.  i<br/>
figure it will be an easy way or no way at all if it is ever changed.<br/>

&gt; Which is why I said in an earlier post that the possibility <br/>
&gt; does exist that<br/>
&gt; Verant would change the binding policy somewhere down the <br/>
&gt; road to accomodate<br/>
&gt; the melee/hybrid casters.   If we provide Verant with a <br/>
&gt; viable option on how<br/>
&gt; to implement the change, they just might consider it. <br/>
