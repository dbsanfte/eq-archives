<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314389669">Um, because on a test server, it&#39;s a lot more likely for big screwups to happen?  And the player base<br/>
might just be a very valuable resource that shouldn&#39;t be lost?  My test environments at work not only get<br/>
backed up with the same normal regularity as my production environments, they get special backups prior to<br/>
any major changes.  Just in case we have to back them out.  Which we have had to do.<br/>
