<b>Subject:</b> OFF TOPIC - email problems?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221062150">For those of you who receive this via email AND for whomever manages - troubleshoots this list:<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else receive responses to posts before they get the actual original post??? This happens to me all the time, and sometimes it&#39;s days before I get the original post and can figure out what is being discussed...<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve noticed that some posts of mine come back throught right away, while others I have posted take days...<br/>
<br/>
Is there a technical problem someone can look into???<br/>
