<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481190941">I bought the Creative Labs GeForce Anihilator Pro, 32<br/>
meg on the card and was really happy that my video<br/>
refreshes enough that I can usually twist 3 songs<br/>
without effort.  My card was $249 -- pricey but I am<br/>
happy with the performance.  My last card, the Diamond<br/>
Stealth 540 III (also with 32 meg) just didn&#39;t refresh<br/>
the songs-gems fast enough for me to twist well.  I<br/>
was really frustrated with my performance, even with<br/>
the latest drivers.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, I have a slow processor, AMD K6-III<br/>
400 with 3D Now technology and 128 meg of RAM.<br/>
