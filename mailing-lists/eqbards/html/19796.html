<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] A Lone Bard in Runnyeye? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-15419486">Spent about 3 to 5 levels in Runnyeye with my guildmates during my early twenties.  Camping the Knight room, a full group of six (that work well together) can pull and hold about 20 spawns in that part of the dungeon.  It was awesome exp too.  A bard at 30th can easily solo the Knight room (AE Fear, they run up and down the stairs, so you DOT them and Fear em).  If your group is holding the Knight room, then you have to stay against the back wall during down times.  Else, the runners&#39;ll aggro on you...they&#39;ll bring back 3 to 20 gobbies depending on how much you&#39;ve killed already.  <br/>
<br/>
I also spent a half an hour in the King room...uhh...only thing I can say is there were a lot of gobbies there (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/Runny1.jpg">http://www.clandlc.com/Runny1.jpg</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/Runny2.jpg)">http://www.clandlc.com/Runny2.jpg)</a>.  The fight took so long that the original mobs&#39; corpses rotted :(.<br/>
<br/>
Also, using our Rhythms series, we fought Evil Eyes several times.....every single spell cast against us was resisted.<br/>

how it works.  I&#39;d like to see how a party fares with a bard playing<br/>
ele&guardians or purifiyn&guardians - then camp the evil eye room behind the<br/>
baracade:  evil eye, & 2 dazed goblin guards for a total of 3 casters.<br/>
