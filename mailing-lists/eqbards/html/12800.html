<b>Subject:</b> RE: Sitting down during a dragon raid <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-74128604">i remember a few patches ago they fixed the fact that if you did sit while<br/>
feared, you would stop fleeing.  so possibly this means if you are sitting<br/>
when feared, you will actually flee.  either way, sitting makes you a big<br/>
target, as the mob sees you as much more vulnerable.  so sitting at the feet<br/>
of a dragon may just equal instant death anyway.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; What I&#39;m wondering is this: If a bard is participating in a <br/>
&gt; dragon raid and<br/>
&gt; is sitting down for the duration of the fight, what happens <br/>
&gt; if they fail the<br/>
&gt; resist check for the dragon fear spell?  Will they stand up and start<br/>
&gt; running or will they remain sitting? </span></blockquote></div>
