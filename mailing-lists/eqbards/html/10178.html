<div id="ygrps-yiv-521772750">He should be as safe as ever in Q Hills.  I travel thru there regularly and<br/>
was there last nite as well, no sign of unusual mobs.  Unlike Kithicor Q<br/>
Hills appears to have been a singular event.  What concerns me more is the<br/>
change to Paw and the trend you mentioned.  While its great for high level<br/>
characters, what are the people who aren&#39;t high level supposed to do?  My<br/>
guild has a whole group of six on its way to Paw now as its one of the few<br/>
uncrowded places perfect for their levels.  If they really want upgrade a<br/>
zone how about Kerra Isle?  It would be a month before word would even get<br/>
out most likely.<br/>

PS No more monks pulling apparently as Feign Death has now been nerfed to<br/>
near uselessness.  If you get back up any mobs that aggroed on you now<br/>
return to kill you.  Which means in the depths of a dungeon FD doesn&#39;t do<br/>
squat as you still have to run just as far as soon as you get up cause the<br/>
monsters are coming back.  If you et one of those critters that stands over<br/>
your body until it wanders away or is led away its even worse.<br/>

This rambles a bit, but I ain&#39;t had no coffee so bear with me:<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so Infected Paw is being upgraded.  Hell we all complained that IP was<br/>
too far from bind points for its designated level to be very useful, so it&#39;s<br/>
high time for a revamp there.  I&#39;m concerned, however.  Not so much about IP<br/>
being upgraded as the general trend that we&#39;re seeing to make existing zones<br/>
more and more difficult as the mean player base gains in level.  Kithicor,<br/>
for instance, has been raised to the point where level 50s can&#39;t be assured<br/>
of traveling through the zone without dying.  From what I hear Qeynos Hills<br/>
now spawns high 20s undead such as Skeletal Monks that will make quick work<br/>
out of anyone traveling to/from Qeynos and Blackburrow.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I met up with a friend who had just purchased and installed<br/>
EverQuest.  He started a warrior in Qeynos.  I&#39;m teaching an experienced<br/>
gamer, but complete EQ newbie things like &quot;don&#39;t kill wolves and bears near<br/>
Holly and Cros Treewind&quot;, &quot;/con everything&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t be afraid to run&quot;,<br/>
&quot;monsters can&#39;t follow you through zones&quot;, dmg/atk ratios, what is AC, etc.,<br/>
etc.  I&#39;m not big on twinking so I didn&#39;t give him much.  A fine steel sword<br/>
and 20pp for milk and muffins.  But is Qeynos Hills going to kick his ass?<br/>
<br/>
What about Enchanters born on the East side of the world from Kithicor?<br/>
Their level 8 animation spell in in High Keep, as are bards level 16 songs<br/>
(some better because of Selo&#39;s, granted).  At level 8 a true EQ newbie has a<br/>
very difficult time just finding out that his spell is *in* High Keep and<br/>
then making his way from Ak&#39;Anon or Freeport.  My god, now the obvious route<br/>
takes him through Kithicor.  He might never have ever seen anything more<br/>
aggresive than a Young Kodiak or the odd Hill Giant.  The sad thing is that<br/>
the Hill Giants that he&#39;s seen are *considerably* easier to kill than any<br/>
undead that he&#39;s going to run into in Kithicor.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose what I&#39;m saying is that Verant is increasing the difficulty by<br/>
leaps and bounds of *existing* zones in order to compensate for the high<br/>
level player base.  This is detrimental to the true EQ newbies.  If *I*<br/>
started a Gnome Enchanter right now, I&#39;d know that I could invis (lvl 4<br/>
spell for them) and travel the boat to Freeport, EC, NRo, Oasis, SRo,<br/>
Innothule, Feerrott, Rathe Mts, SK, NK, WK, HH, HK if I really wanted to<br/>
avoid Kithicor.  OR get a high level escort during the day and save a bunch<br/>
of time and zoning.  But a real newbie has no idea of what awaits him when<br/>
he zones from the tranquil WC in to Kith.  Mayhem, madness and swift death<br/>
and exp. loss.  What would *you* do if you had no friends in EQ and got<br/>
killed with one spell by an Undead Cleric somewhere between WC and the<br/>
Rivervale entrance?<br/>
<br/>
Most people on this list are experienced players.  Some of us are *very*<br/>
experienced players.  If we started new characters, even completely<br/>
untwinked, we would be able to avoid these things because we know the game<br/>
*so* well.  We take the depth of our knowledge for granted.  I remember back<br/>
in late May when I first install EQ - do you remember when you first<br/>
installed it?  Remember how completely freakin&#39; lost you were?  Now put<br/>
Kithicor between you and something that you need as much as a level 8<br/>
enchanters needs Mircyl&#39;s Animation.  Say you&#39;re a level 6 bard in Freeport<br/>
and hear &quot;Are you [interested] in delivering [mail]?&quot;, &quot;We need [mail]<br/>
delivered to [High Keep].  Are you [interested]?&quot;<br/>
