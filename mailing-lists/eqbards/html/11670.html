He spawns in the jail.  Go like you are going to the zone to the dead side<br/>
of lower (hugging right side the upper) Before you get to the place where<br/>
the bugs are on the rocks and you cross that catwalk, there are some forks<br/>
off to the left as you head for dead zone. (It might be way before - there<br/>
are at least 2 left forks. Explore some.  Take the first left fork and then<br/>
a second left fork (hard left I think).  Look for the &#39;jail&#39; - a room with a<br/>
platform in the center and cells with troll prisoners in them and some<br/>
guards.  And there maybe a good reason you have not seen the Warden - hehe<br/>
he spawns invis!  So have see invis on.  One spot between 2 cells is where<br/>
he spawns - if not him then his place holder. Kill and wait 18 min. Kill and<br/>
wait. Warden is about 1 in 5 spawn.  Elf hide gloves are the common drop.<br/>
THB is the uncommon.  Prolly 3 or 4 to 1.<br/>
<br/>
I went there when the rest of the room was  too green to agro on us.  Not<br/>
sure what happens if you are mid/upper 20&#39;s.  Prolly need a full party to<br/>
take and hold the room.<br/>
