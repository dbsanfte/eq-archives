<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422728108">You want to use a plain ol&#39; horn. And you will miss MANY notes at first. I <br/>
would suggest going someone far away from people, kicking the song up, and <br/>
let it sit for a couple hours. That will give you a good start into the <br/>
skill. And contrary to what some people say, you do not have to have a target <br/>
for the skill to rise. <br/>
The place I chose for my AFK practice was in Qeynos Hills all the way across <br/>
the zone from the entrance to the karana&#39;s, up on the hill. I didn&#39;t see one <br/>
living thing and even after letting it sit all night I was still alive :)<br/>
Anyways, good luck to ya.<br/>
