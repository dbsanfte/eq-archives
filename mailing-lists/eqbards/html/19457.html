<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935217767">Can anyone come up with a reason Chains should be in testing?  Until the<br/>
earlier message today about chains not stopping runners in their tracks at<br/>
low health I was always under the impression this song worked fully as<br/>
intended.  The only reason I can think of that for it to be in testing is<br/>
that it wears off prematurely sometimes.  Example: I&#39;ve been using<br/>
chains/fear combo a lot the last few times I&#39;ve played.  I weave the two<br/>
with Celerity.  On numerous occasions the following has happened:  1)<br/>
initial chains wears off (yellow text message), 2) restart chains and get<br/>
the blue text message it sticks, 3) immediately get yellow text message<br/>
saying chains has wore off again.  So either one of two things is happening:<br/>
1) Mobs are getting a second chance to break the chains earlier than its<br/>
normal duration (by design?) or 2) chains doesn&#39;t always stick even if you<br/>
get a success message (bug).<br/>
<br/>
Something else I&#39;ve noticed that may be a bug.  Sometimes after I chain the<br/>
mob they will resist my first Screech attempt.  I then restart screech and<br/>
if it sticks skip celerity and go straight to another Chains.  On a few<br/>
occasions I will get the blue message that the mob is chained before I get<br/>
the yellow message that the initial chains has wore off.  But when I do get<br/>
the message that the first chains has wore off, the mob starts to run away<br/>
again at full speed.  So in effect since the second chains didn&#39;t stick even<br/>
though I got the message it did.  This has only happened on a few occasions<br/>
so I didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time.  I only remembered it when I<br/>
saw the message that they were testing Chains for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
Its been a real long time since we&#39;ve had to discuss Chains on this list so<br/>
if these have already been discussed then I&#39;ve forgotten about it.  <br/>
