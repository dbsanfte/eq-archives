<div id="ygrps-yiv-311941070">Still playing EQ, but I have DAoC preordered and should get it today.  My group (9 of us) all plan to try to install and play tonight.  We are going to the Midgard realm and I plan to play a Skald first and Healer or Shaman second.  Charisma seems to be high as a bard attribute again.  And you specialize between song, weapon and parry skills.  Boy am I confused, but I suppose EQ seemed complex at the beginning too.  I plan to max song, with a weapon close behind and then throw some points in parry.  Not sure about charisma, strength and constitution initial distribution.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is an EQ list, but I was wondering if anyone else is looking to see if the grass is greener.  I hope you don&#39;t mind.  I am a member of the DAoC group, but that is general and not bard specific.  I have also found some bard related sites for DAoC if anyone is interested.  Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
See you on line somewhere,<br/>

Excellent!  I&#39;ll give it a try tonight since my DAoC hasn&#39;t arrived yet ;-)<br/>
That was my biggest gripe with EQ which probably still won&#39;t have changed<br/>
enough.  You can&#39;t even begin to handle mobs 1-on-1 that are many levels<br/>
below you.  Many times even when they are too far below you to provide<br/>
experience.</div>
