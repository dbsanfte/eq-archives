<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348952487">Yeah, since I orginaly started this thread I did a few<br/>
duels with my wizzie friend.  We are both 23.  She had<br/>
a good strategy, she was doing her random teleport<br/>
then waiting for me to run at here to blast and<br/>
teleport again.  Lullabye was sucking, so I switched<br/>
to bellow.  That made all the difference.  Every time<br/>
it hit it interupted her, and at a much faster rate<br/>
that lullabye does AND I never saw a resist message<br/>
for it come up.  So for now at least, I go start off<br/>
with the guardian/purifying to try and resist the<br/>
first blast then get in close with fast weapons and bellow.<br/>
