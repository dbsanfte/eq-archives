<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028692430"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;However, if I<br/>
&gt;was within 20% of the other people&#39;s damage output over the course of 50<br/>
&gt;fights, statistics would tell you that during some of those fights I would<br/>
&gt;actually do more damage than them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re attributing the occasional ability to outdamage someone<br/>
with a higher percentage on the randomness of the RNG.  Is that correct?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In no fight did I<br/>
&gt;outdamage them for more than a few mob swings.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems to support your reasoning above, if I understood it correctly.<br/>
It sounds like there were occassions where you outdamaged them, despite<br/>
their higher melee ability.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In many fights I never outdamaged them and took not one attack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this makes sense, since samples over time negate the random factor.  If<br/>
you&#39;re only 80% as effective, over time, you expect the mob to stay on him.<br/>
