<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017406184"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; breath as over the weekend we did both Nag & Vox (other guilds were sloted <br/>
&gt; to do them but they could not take em and yield them to my guild).  And in <br/>
&gt; both runs I has taking as little as 1/8th a bubble from dragon breaths.  My <br/>
&gt; FR/CR was 220+ in both cases.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I wasn&#39;t there, I can&#39;t say.  And I can&#39;t call you a liar.<br/>
  But it&#39;s my opinion that you are exaggerating quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been next to a dragon three times, CR 222, FR 170 and<br/>
  I took 400, yes four-hundred, points of dmg regardless.<br/>
<br/>
  And 1/8th of a bubble?  Rokken, come on man gimme a break.<br/>
  You cannot expect me to believe that. heh.  Your fish is getting<br/>
  a little too big.<br/>
