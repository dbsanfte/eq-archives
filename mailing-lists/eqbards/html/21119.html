<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172612060">How does one go to an already broken Fear plane and not expect to be bored <br/>
off his ass? The only time I could see this being even remotely exciting is <br/>
if a GM showed up and re-popped the entire zone at once, which they would <br/>
only do if some mobs were bugged.<br/>
<br/>
As the other guys said, all imbrued armor is dropped in the Plane of Hate, <br/>
unless you get lucky and see it drop on a cube in Fear.<br/>
<br/>
If you want an exciting experience, try not farming Fear for once, and <br/>
instead breaking it open on a full pop. You might actually have a challenge <br/>
*gasp* and fun. Instead of seeing maybe 2-3 dozen mobs in 5.5 hours, you <br/>
will more than likely see 2-3 dozen mobs in your first couple hours, <br/>
depending on how efficient your raiding party is. Not only will you kill a <br/>
lot more in less time, but you will see more loot drop in a shorter amount <br/>
of time. Last time I was on a Fear raid, we saw no less than 8 drops in the <br/>
first hour. It reminded me of the candyland that was the original Fear plane <br/>
opening.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;d have to say that breaking Fear on a full pop is one of the <br/>
most fun experiences I have ever had in EQ, next to maybe killing Trak. <br/>
Kiting dracolich around is pretty fun too. =)<br/>
<br/>
People farming Fear and then wondering where the fun went baffle me.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of a running joke some friends have about farming Fear (if <br/>
this offends any of you, oh well):<br/>
Lleluvyn says, &#39;Hail there hardy adventurer, would you be interested in <br/>
[Farming The Plane of Fear]?&#39;<br/>
Kruegen says, &#39;How do I farm the plane of fear?<br/>
Lleluvyn says, &#39;It is an easy task, done by many! Simply fetch me [a shovel] <br/>
and [Treasure bag] and we can get started! There is a [reward]!<br/>
Kruegen says, &#39;What is the reward?&#39;<br/>
Lleluvyn says, &#39;Ah! The reward you ask? The reward is free [phat lewtz] with <br/>
no risk other then [/random 100].<br/>

&gt;Did my First Fear Raid last night.  Have to say was one of the most boring<br/>
&gt;nights I&#39;ve ever had in Everquest.  The Plane had been broken early <br/>
&gt;Saturday<br/>
&gt;morning (I believe they said at 9:30 AM CDT) and I got there in <br/>
&gt;anticipation<br/>
&gt;of a respawn at approx 9:30 PM EDT.  I left at about 3:30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We saw maybe 2-3 dozen mobs over the course of about 5.5 hours camped there<br/>
&gt;and no Bard stuff Dropped.  I was the only Bard - so it would have been <br/>
&gt;nice<br/>
&gt;if I got a couple of Imbrued.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone know any details of Respawns?   The folks there were expecting a<br/>
&gt;major spawn at between 12-14 hours - but we saw nothing of the sort.<br/>
