&gt; &gt; I have to disagree on the Lambent BP vs Mithril BP. I get more AC and <br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt; &gt; HP from the Lambent BP.  My Agl is 100 btw (without the MBP).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Well the hp isn&#39;t in question here.  Clearly, one has an hp bonus<br/>
&gt;   and one doesnt.  AC17 on the MithBP and AC20 on the LambentBP is<br/>
&gt;   what I&#39;m referring too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I think we talked about this before.  Every 10? AGI gives you some<br/>
&gt;   sort of AC bonus applied across all your armor?  I don&#39;t remember.<br/>
&gt;   But if my 105 AGI drops to 99 AGI, I lose AC for sure.  I&#39;m willing<br/>
&gt;   to bet bumping my AGI to 110 will then increase the AC.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   So, does a +15 AGI increase/bump your overall armor up enough to make<br/>
&gt;   just +3 AC?  If it does then the MithBP is equally as good as the<br/>
&gt;   Lambent one.  (Not to mention the added AGI makes your combat effective-<br/>
&gt;   ness increase as well)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If I followed all the numbers correctly, I still wouldnt wear the<br/>
&gt;   MithBP even if it was better =)  Baby blue is for those wimpy paladins.<br/>
