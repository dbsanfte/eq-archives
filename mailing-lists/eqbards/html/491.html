<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631149130">Your looking in the wrong place. Its High Keep is where you need to be. You<br/>
get there by going through High Hold. Look for the castle not the inns<br/>

&gt;&gt;I have searched all of High Hold Keep and have yet to find the song.  In<br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;&gt;frustration I moved out of the keep into the pass, and subsequently died<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt;a VERY nasty Dark Elf NPC in one of the Inns.  I realize this is<br/>
&gt;requesting<br/>
&gt;&gt;a spoiler, but when I died to the NPC last night I lost my level, and am<br/>
&gt;&gt;pretty frustrated at this point.  E-mail privately if you wish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The guy selling the bard songs in High Hold is standing in front of a<br/>
&gt;picture a few rooms away from the bank.  I can&#39;t give any better directions<br/>
&gt;than that, but that should be enough for you to find him if you search a<br/>
&gt;bit.<br/>
