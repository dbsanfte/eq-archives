<div id="ygrps-yiv-449457373">All of what Keith said about Shadowed Men is true from what I&#39;ve read.  They<br/>
are summoned Shadow Knights.  They have &quot;Spirit of Norrath&quot; speed (none faster<br/>
in the game - they can outrun Guides), and their weapons are summoned.<br/>
However, in addition they seem to be a source of random magical items that are<br/>
not summoned.  I was speeding through South K last night and saw a herd (eight<br/>
or so) of SMen standing near the zone border between the Av Villiage and the<br/>
Stone Bridge.  One of them was holding an object that looked like a magical<br/>
orb or something.  My money is that that particular item would not be NO RENT.<br/>
What it was I cannot say, as at level 23 they all conned red to me.  Several<br/>
of them had skeletal pets that were risky blue to me.  Since pets are usually<br/>
several levels below the summoner, I would expect the SMen to be roughly level<br/>
30.<br/>
<br/>
Taking on a herd of these fellows would be a challenge indeed.  A group in<br/>
their mid to high 30s would likely be required to smack down the eight or so<br/>
that I saw.  Since flight is not an option, you&#39;d definitely want someone with<br/>
group evac with you.  Eight Harm Touches could ruin your day.<br/>
<br/>
I think these guys are a wonderful addition to Norrath.  They (potentially)<br/>
address several problems that people have been complaining about.<br/>
<br/>
1) They are high level - giving the growing high-end base of players a bit<br/>
more to do.<br/>
<br/>
2) They are a source of random items.  Camping them for a particular item is<br/>
not likely to get too out of hand because of this.<br/>
<br/>
3) They are very fast - creating an additional challenge.  Much like fighting<br/>
on an island in the OOT, there is nowhere (no way) to run to a zone.<br/>
<br/>
4) They are likely part of one or more quests, enriching the world even<br/>
further.<br/>
<br/>
So basically I believe that they, while seemingly unfinished as of yet, are<br/>
Verant&#39;s response to some of the complaints that players have been having.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Anyone wandered around Kilthkor lately?  Saw some<br/>
&gt; &gt; names just hanging in the air.  Shadow men.   Targeted<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re new since the last patch. They can be found<br/>
&gt; in Kithicor, Highpass, Lesser Faydark and a few<br/>
&gt; other places as well. They are summoned creatures so<br/>
&gt; those dispel summoned spells work great on them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; motto to this point has been, if you can&#39;t be safe, be<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast.  But for the first time since I got the speed<br/>
&gt; &gt; song, something odd happened.  At level 30, with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mistmoor Drum, I was getting hit from behind.  A lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is no running spell, song or device that will<br/>
&gt; outrun the Shadowed Men. Including Spirit Of Cheetah<br/>
&gt; and the Guide&#39;s speed girdle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; these little inviso guys?  I hear there&#39;s more stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; now in our spooky liitle woods, can anyone verify.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They usually drop shadowed weapons which say they can<br/>
&gt; be equiped by warriors, but can&#39;t be equiped by anyone<br/>
&gt; at this time. This detail might be a bug. But the<br/>
&gt; items may also be for a quest that hasn&#39;t been found<br/>
&gt; as of yet. The items these mobs drop are also summoned<br/>
&gt; and thus disappear when you log off.<br/>
