<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223399387">Greetings Fellow Bard!~<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion to you is make a journey to Everfrost and Halas!  You will<br/>
need to learn how to scoot thru the Black Burrow Paw but once you know the<br/>
drill it should not be too hard.  Because of your young age, the bigger<br/>
Gnolls will find you a tasty morsel, so you will want to avoid those.  They<br/>
generally stay in the lower levels and should not pose too much of a<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get thru the BB, you will need to learn the canyons of Everfrost<br/>
Peaks but you should be well able to handle the stuff that roams thru there.<br/>
I know of level 3 Shamans that have made the journey in reverse so I know a<br/>
level 6 can do it.  The game in Everfrost Peaks is plentiful and rich<br/>
especially for you.  I&#39;d suggest learning tailoring while there because all<br/>
the materials are close at hand and if you invest the time and material to<br/>
learn and it does take some practice, I think you will be satisfied with the<br/>
returns.<br/>
<br/>
Halas as a city is smaller than Qeynos but has all of the comforts you need.<br/>
The people there - whilst they be Barbaric are not the less quite<br/>
hospitable.<br/>
<br/>
My first real corpse rescue happened out on the plains of Everfrost.  A<br/>
higher level ranger - I think she was even 16 or more - got killed before<br/>
she could determine her location.  Believe me that was quite exciting for me<br/>
a low level 5 running across those treacherous plains for the first time of<br/>
my life.<br/>
<br/>
Once you reach level 9 or 10 and tire of the fighting inside BB can travel<br/>
to West Karana for big game hunting.  Then seek your fortune in the lands<br/>
near Freeport.  Actually at level 8, you could make the journey to Freeport<br/>
- but a stop in Rivervale and Misty Thicket for a couple levels would be<br/>
good too.  If you do stop in Rivervale - invest all of your time there in<br/>
quest of the Squad Ring.  You will be killing gobbies and orcs anyways - why<br/>
not get something for your efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and give me /tell if you are on Innoruuk,<br/>

		Heya,<br/>
<br/>
		You fine folks have any suggestions for a level 6 Bard on<br/>
where to hunt?<br/>
		Im was born in, and live around the Qeynos area. I have been<br/>
helping keep<br/>
		the rat population down, and lately have been working on<br/>
keeping the<br/>
		dreaded Black Burrow entrance free of Scouts and Guards.<br/>
However I am in<br/>
		need of greater adventure. As a bard, I need great<br/>
adventures to write<br/>
		songs about.<br/>
<br/>
		ooc: So if I help someone who is a level 23 warrior find<br/>
their body, and<br/>
		they give me stuff, is this considered twinking? <br/>
<br/>
		ooc2: Ever notice how many of us bards have names that start<br/>
with T?<br/>
