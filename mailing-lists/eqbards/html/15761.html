<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103607107">Gotta agree, get out of Unrest.  I have a 23 bard that is stuck at 23 and 2<br/>
bubbles in Unrest.  I have been in Unrest for two weeks now and only gained<br/>
half a bubble.  I die at least once a night, usually due to bone-heads in<br/>
the group.<br/>
<br/>
I left Antonica mainly because it was getting over camped in the Karanas.<br/>
I decided to hunt Mistmoor and Unrest for a while.  I did fairly well in<br/>
Mistmoor my first few days, the rest of my days were terrible.  I then went<br/>
to Cauldron and found it impossible to find a person to hunt Tidal Lords<br/>
with.  I went to Unrest the past 2 weeks.  I had not been there since April<br/>
of &#39;99 (it hasn&#39;t changed).  Well like I said, I gained half a bubble.  I<br/>
went back out to Cauldron 2 days ago with a friend to hunt Tidal Lords, but<br/>
the spawns were painfully slow.  So I gave up on that.  Back in to Unrest<br/>
last night and another death.  Now I am heading back to Karana area<br/>
tonight.  Oh, 2 weeks and I still have not been able to loot a bracelet for<br/>
the bracer quest :(.<br/>
<br/>
Although Crier suggest decent places that are easy for you to hunt, I would<br/>
advise avoiding these especially during prime time as they are generally<br/>
camped to the teeth: Oasis (90+ people is too damn much), Chickens in SK<br/>
(way over camped and I found the exp to be terrible, the centuars are much<br/>
better), Scythe beetles (they really only spawn during the daylight hours<br/>
and are rare compared to borer and pincer beetles, they should be blue to you.)<br/>
<br/>
I plan on going to Lake Rathe, Rathe Mountians or Highkeep basement (yes,<br/>
yes, I know it is way over camped too but I am tied of the long corpse run<br/>
right now)<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Other nice places that are train-free are crocs in Oasis (deepwaters at your<br/>
&gt;level), Giant Skeletons in Rathe Mts., Aviaks in SK (dull), Scythe Beetles<br/>
&gt;in NK, DE guards in Nektulos, and if you can stand the occasional train try<br/>
&gt;Sol A, Permafrost, Upper Guk.<br/>
