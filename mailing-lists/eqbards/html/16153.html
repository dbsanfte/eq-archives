<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273499422">If you can get to the bedroom then you&#39;re halfway there.  Get invised vs<br/>
undead and from the bedroom take the left tunnel out, hug the left wall if<br/>
bats are there and squeek by their agro radius.  Follow the tunnel a few<br/>
paces until you see the chamber with the Greater Ice Bone Skeletons (GIBS)<br/>
in it.  If you&#39;re on a crowded server they may be all pulled.  If they are<br/>
there, know that they do see through invis vs undead.  Hug the right wall<br/>
this time and you will just squeek past their agro radius.  Follow the<br/>
tunnel a bit more and you&#39;ll see four or five steps leading up to some stone<br/>
walkways.  There&#39;s usually two frogs stationed here.  Up the steps, straight<br/>
along into some buildings where you&#39;ll shortly be forced to take a left.<br/>
Turn left 90 degrees and about 50 feet in front of you you&#39;ll see a ladder.<br/>
Climb that ladder (it&#39;s pretty short) and you&#39;ll be in the &quot;tower&quot; where the<br/>
Assassin spawns - it&#39;s a fairly small room with barrels in it.  There&#39;s<br/>
either three or four spawn spots in this little room, and you get some<br/>
wizzies and stuff spawning.  This room is not that hard for a group in the<br/>
low to mid thirties to hold if they aren&#39;t stupid.  Once you get a grasp on<br/>
the room you can pull stuff from nearby up into this room for experience.<br/>
And as always in Lower Guk - no runners.  Chain &#39;em.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) I can get to the bedroom (who can&#39;t) but I don&#39;t know the exact way to<br/>
&gt; the assassin&#39;s room. How do I get to the room? I have several<br/>
&gt; maps, but they<br/>
&gt; are all a bit sketchy in the assasin area, and I&#39;ve heard there<br/>
&gt; are ladders<br/>
&gt; involved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Does anyone know what level group usually camps the room, or what the<br/>
&gt; common loot practices are? (eg. if I go for the mask, will I be excluded<br/>
&gt; from the other loot since I can use the mask, or is it not even counted<br/>
&gt; since it&#39;s no drop) It&#39;s not that I care, I&#39;ll go either way, I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt; curious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Is there anything in particular I need to watch out for?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
