<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094641371">Do you know if the new item also gives the charisma bonus and DE illusion that<br/>
the Guise gave.  I have been wanting a Guise for a long time now but have not<br/>
been high enough level to get one for myself.  Sure hope the only change is that<br/>
the new item must be equipped to be used.  Would also be nice if it isn&#39;t NO<br/>
DROP.  Don&#39;t think we will be that lucky though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; single biggest Enhancement Verant has made to date.  Is it still No Drop I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, they didn&#39;t fix it.  They made a new item.  The old<br/>
&gt; guises still work without being equipped, much to the chagrin<br/>
&gt; of the non-bard/rogue non-powerlevelers.<br/>
