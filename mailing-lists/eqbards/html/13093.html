<div id="ygrps-yiv-61939290">this exact subject has been the majority of guild chat recently.  and<br/>
everyone in my guild agrees, AC and STR are the most important stats for<br/>
melee players.  DEX is important for bards, but not for other melee classes<br/>
unless they have procing weapons.  AGI is good to a point, around 100, but<br/>
after that the increase in AC is not as large as just getting good AC items<br/>
themselves.  the rogues, monks, and warriors are all swapping out items for<br/>
AC and STR.  they are picking jagged bands over fire emerald plat rings, for<br/>
example.  a favorite of the monks are plat fire opal rings, 5AC 55hp.  they<br/>
are getting away from player made jewelery, which for the most part has no<br/>
AC but only stats.  i&#39;m thinking of messing around with this a little<br/>
myself, as with 147 STR, 149 DEX, and 119 AGI i have room to play with.  i<br/>
am going to go for some more CHA and AC, my CHA is a pitiful 103 (i&#39;m coming<br/>
over to the good side, Harm).  i fear i may go into a seizure if my STR goes<br/>
under 140, but i&#39;m going to risk it.<br/>

&gt; Hail and well met everyone!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One question today:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My guildmates, namely 2 monks, 2 paladins, and our resident <br/>
&gt; rogue have begun formulating a rather distressing theory of <br/>
&gt; late.  They seem to all be of the opinion that the only real <br/>
&gt; stats that matter are AC and STR (and agility for the monks). <br/>
&gt;  Now before anyone begins to think these people are soft in <br/>
&gt; the head, these are all very intelligent players.  The monks <br/>
&gt; are 30 and 38 respectively, the paladins are 33 and 35, and <br/>
&gt; the rogue (the guild&#39;s most valuable asset by far) just <br/>
&gt; chimed hell level one (30) last night.  Can their theory be <br/>
&gt; right? </span></blockquote></div>
