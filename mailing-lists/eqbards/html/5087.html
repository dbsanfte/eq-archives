<div id="ygrps-yiv-38851163">Okay - I ran into that one, and at 14th, he was easy to solo, even though<br/>
blue (I usually have problems with anything tougher than blue.  Blues seem<br/>
&quot;equal&quot; to me. Dunno why).  Here&#39;s the weird thing - he had some pages from<br/>
a diary, and I remembered hearing about that not too long ago, so I tucked<br/>
the pages away (after reading them *hehe*), but when I got to Halas....<br/>

I ran into a lady wandering the main part of town, when hailed complained<br/>
about her missing brother.  After talking to her for a moment, I determined<br/>
that she was looking for the missing pages to his diary.  Thinks me, &quot;Hey -<br/>
those pages!&quot; so  I give them to her.  But they aren&#39;t the right pages. :P<br/>
Dunno why?  Any ideas?<br/>
