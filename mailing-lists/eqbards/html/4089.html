&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, I suppose if your primary goal in this game is to get to<br/>
&gt; level 50 as quickly as possible, then selling the crown and<br/>
&gt; using the plat to equip yourself is the way to go.  Just<br/>
&gt; remember, there will *always* be something bigger and meaner<br/>
&gt; than you in this game for you to fight.  While advancing<br/>
&gt; quickly may inflate your ego (and I don&#39;t mean that in a<br/>
&gt; derogatory way), it deprives you of time to explore and<br/>
&gt; experience things meant for people your current level, good<br/>
&gt; and bad.  Some day, a level 15 player will gaze at your level<br/>
&gt; 45 awesomeness, and ask you for advice, and you will be unable<br/>
&gt; to give him any because at his level you had equipment way<br/>
&gt; beyond his means.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never did understand people who paid $49.95 for Diablo, then<br/>
&gt; immediately hacked themselves 50th level characters.  If you<br/>
&gt; sell the crown and buy yourself full bronze armor, a barbed<br/>
<br/>
&gt; whip, and dragoon dirk, I predict you will be very very bored<br/>
&gt; for the next 10-15 levels because the only thing you&#39;ll have<br/>
&gt; to look forward to is leveling.  Just about everything dropped<br/>
&gt; by stuff you fight until you reach about level 25 is going to<br/>
&gt; be inferior to the equipment you bought at level 13.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just my opinion.  To each his own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I realize you don&#39;t exactly like twinkers, but there are several<br/>
inaccuracies I can think of with that argument.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, having better equipment doesn&#39;t mean you explore *less*. It<br/>
means (for instance) being able to go to High Hold, or the Eastern Karanas,<br/>
a level earlier than you normally could. Nor does it affect knowledge of<br/>
equipment- at level 13, you&#39;re either wearing leather, banded, or bronze,<br/>
with a quest item or two mixed in (again, the quests are made MORE fun<br/>
because, just maybe, you can now solo the mob that&#39;s eluded you for the last<br/>
two levels, not less.)<br/>
<br/>
Second, 250pp is not 250,000. Yes, that will buy you a set of bronze, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean you must immediately stop looking for better stuff until you<br/>
make 10 more levels. On the contrary- it means you can save up money for the<br/>
*truly* useful items, like some elf hide gloves (if you&#39;re not an elf, that<br/>
is &lt;G&gt;) or a battle drum. It&#39;s not exactly a godly plate of the whale-<br/>
actually, every one of my characters after the first have made at least a<br/>
hundred pp by level 15 (fairly, I might add, without using any trade skills<br/>
or even camping for lore items like everyone else), and some have gotten<br/>
much more than that.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, why is having a full set of bronze, a dirk, and money in the bank<br/>
(i.e., not having to worry about where your next song is coming from- that<br/>
was a very real concern to me at that level) somehow less &#39;noble&#39; or &#39;fair&#39;<br/>
than wearing all patchwork except for an admittedly very nice crown on your<br/>
head? I freely admit the situation would be very different if this was an<br/>
active twink- that&#39;s part of why all my characters are independent of each<br/>
other. But using a fairly gotten reward to make the next few levels less<br/>
painful- to, perhaps, get to see High Hold or Unrest a few days ahead of<br/>
time- isn&#39;t exactly cheating, at least in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Flame away...<br/>
