<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841701316">Try the command /pet back off.  That might do it.  Your pet should back<br/>
off in a non-aggro manner as long as your are not being attacked and it is<br/>
not being attacked.  I learned the command the hard way playing my mage.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been playing with charm a lot lately (wonderful for<br/>
&gt; pulling a mob off someone it&#39;s frenzied against), and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; noticed a recurring problem.  Sometimes the mob you charm will<br/>
&gt; attack a player (a party member in all cases so far) and will<br/>
&gt; not stop despite repeated commands to sit down, follow me, or<br/>
&gt; attack another mob.<br/>
