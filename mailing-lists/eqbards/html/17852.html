<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318162846">id simply refuse to twist your dragon/god songs at these events, between <br/>
guild enevts dont sing mana until your demands are met, and swap out vov for <br/>
johnathon&#39;s war song.  when the other tanks wonder where that extra touch of <br/>
haste has gone, tell them since you are already at a loss of haste speed, <br/>
you decided to sing self only haste songs to make you about the speed of <br/>
dragon haste.  thatll show them.<br/>

&gt;it&#39;s on Karana server.  i&#39;d rather hold back the guild name so i don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;smear<br/>
&gt;their name.  (hoping that I can convince the guild to let bards at least<br/>
&gt;have loot rights to swirlspine and fbss)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;with the speed cap, it makes sense for the top-notch speed gear go to the<br/>
&gt;melee&#39;s without a haste song.  (since we hit it with just about any haste<br/>
&gt;item)<br/>
