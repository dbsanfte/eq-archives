<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300639887">OMG, that really is ridiculous and unacceptable.  I&#39;d like to say<br/>
unbelievable but...<br/>

&gt; No way to fix it.  Egroups made the change.  You can pay to <br/>
&gt; have it not<br/>
&gt; appear, but I don&#39;t know anyone who has gone that route yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; btw  The main thing you missed was the huge uproar over <br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;s claim that<br/>
&gt; Lullaby was just fine.  Many bards have left for other lands <br/>
&gt; and I shall<br/>
&gt; soon be following.  Even Lyrnia has retired which suprised me <br/>
&gt; greatly.  If<br/>
&gt; even Verant&#39;s staunchest supporters are outraged then things <br/>
&gt; are worse than<br/>
&gt; I imagined.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Glad you had fun in Dalnir&#39;s Tani, be well.<br/>

&gt; Ok and hmm replying to my own message, all of a sudden the <br/>
&gt; sponsor stuff is<br/>
&gt; at the top of my emails.  Is this a change or is it cuz i upgraded to<br/>
&gt; Outlook 2000?  If its the latter, anyone know how to fix it?<br/>
