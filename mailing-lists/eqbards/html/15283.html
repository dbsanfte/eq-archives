government office, I tend to be treated badly in return.<br/>

Bah!  I look at it this way:<br/>
1. In the long run we pay their salary.<br/>
2. We give them something to do.<br/>
3. They should be thanking us!<br/>
4. I don&#39;t think we are annoying them, as it stands now the post is only<br/>
ignored.<br/>
5. As George Carlin said to the cop, &quot;Hey!  You&#39;re a public servant right?<br/>
Don&#39;t I pay your salary?  Get me a glass of water!&quot;<br/>
6. Someone alread sent this in to eqcasters to see if they can do something<br/>
about it.<br/>

&gt;Not saying I disagree with you, but perhaps we need to go about this<br/>
