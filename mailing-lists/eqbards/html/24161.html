my first point was that 0.20 damage per second is worst case, and secondly, if you thought<br/>
DDD was useless (which it may be in most situations, although for those folks who<br/>
always complain they have nothing to do in enchanter groups, this seems like something<br/>
that might be worthwhile) that you must also think HT is useless.<br/>
