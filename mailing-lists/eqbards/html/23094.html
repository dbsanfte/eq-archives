<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819582894">I advise against using your WB song as primary for yourself either.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you rather be singing something else to help your group?  Group<br/>
with someone that can cast it - but keep your WB song memmed - it&#39;s a nice<br/>
backup to save someone&#39;s life.  If you hear the gurgling drowning sound -<br/>
fire it up right away.  I&#39;ve saved ppls life before.<br/>
	The Singing Steel Gloves are really nice to have permanent WB.  I did a<br/>
raid Kedge Raid a couple of weeks ago (Damn Phin didn&#39;t spawn - and was due)<br/>
and it was really nice to not have to worry about it.<br/>
