&gt;Ok, Int DOES increace the amount of mana we bards have. At the same time <br/>
&gt;it also effects our DOT songs (lvls 2,18,30,38,46,49) after having int <br/>
&gt;higher that 100 increases damage by 5%. I think the next magic number is <br/>
&gt;around 120ish then 144ish. I have not been able to get enough int to test <br/>
&gt;these. But at 99 and less int lvl 30 38 and 46 songs with selos drum <br/>
&gt;played once in a twist does 315 dam at lvl 46. With 100 int it did 331. <br/>
&gt;There are TWO songs at this point that use mana, lvl 39 charm and lvl 43 <br/>
&gt;dirge. At lvl 43 a bard has just enough mana to play Dirge song once.<br/>
&gt;BTW - most parts to the bard planer armor has a int bonus not a wis bonus. <br/>
&gt;Hmmm... could be a hint :)<br/>

&gt;My primary offense these days is in songs - Chant series and when able the <br/>
&gt;CoD, DDD, CoC medly - with planar/dragon instruments.  So, if int is a <br/>
&gt;good boost then I am gonna rob my wizzy twink of his int gear!  &lt;j/k&gt; One <br/>
&gt;reason I give some creedence to this is the blurb in the original user <br/>
&gt;manual that said INT was a component in bard song effectiveness.<br/>
