&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, drat, this is a role call so I have to fess up. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tszaaz, Wood Elf Bard 35, Povar<br/>
&gt; Tsengu, Wood Elf Bard 15, Nameless<br/>
&gt; Orphe, half Elf Bard 18, Povar<br/>
&gt; Tssaas, Iksar Warrior 12, Povar<br/>
&gt; Crowshadow, Barbarian Shaman 10, Povar<br/>
&gt; Vaem Teir&#39;Dal Enchanter 10, Povar<br/>
&gt; Vitaesaur, Iksar Shaman 3, Povar <br/>
&gt; Tsengu, Teir&#39;Dal Cleric 10, Rallos Zek, Champion of Dark Unity<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No longer are inspired by the soul of their creator, rather <br/>
&gt; they all have a<br/>
&gt; replacement soul, I wish them all well in their future endeavors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am sad to report that I have handed my account off to a few <br/>
&gt; friends, to<br/>
&gt; carve up between them. My reasons are a bit personal, but it <br/>
&gt; had nothing to<br/>
&gt; do with EQ, I LOVE playing, I was very very excited about taking Orphe<br/>
&gt; farther than I had gone with Tszaaz, but...it just isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; going to happen,<br/>
&gt; nor will I be popping up in UO AC or Anarchy Online.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you all for this list, it totally changed my experience <br/>
&gt; of playing EQ.<br/>
&gt; The quality of the information and the maturity and <br/>
&gt; positiveness of you all<br/>
&gt; really made it a great place to be. Thank you all again. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t be quitting the list until I hear what Ester <br/>
&gt; discovers, because I<br/>
&gt; just HAVE to know :o) but after that I will be fading away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck to you all, keep your sheet music dry, swap in your <br/>
&gt; weapons before<br/>
&gt; melee and make sure you are clear which icon is Cindas <br/>
&gt; Carillon and which is<br/>
&gt; Kellins Lament...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
