<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899621674">Lake Rathe is great until level 23 if you the boredom doesn&#39;t get to<br/>
you after a couple of levels.  After Lake Rathe head to the Aviak City in<br/>
South Karana.  If you don&#39;t get burned out on Aviaks, you can stay there<br/>
until level 27 or 28 easily..  longer if you just go after mainly Avocets.<br/>
Pretty good loot on the mobs in the Aviak City too.<br/>
