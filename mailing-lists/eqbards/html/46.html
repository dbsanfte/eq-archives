Here&#39;s a tip:  Keep at least two.  Often you will die in a very scary<br/>
place, and your invisibility song is the key to getting your body back,<br/>
but with your horn on your body, you can&#39;t sing the song (Sonorous<br/>
Clouding is one of the first songs that requires you to use an<br/>
instrument).<br/>
