<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017650038">I was getting ready to play EQ last night right<br/>
after dinner and thought I would post the results<br/>
of my Lullaby testing after the latest patch.<br/>
Here&#39;s the scenario.  I encountered a 2nd (nearly<br/>
3rd) level young human named Duncan in his lair.<br/>
He is the common spawn in the &quot;child&#39;s bedroom&quot; of<br/>
the Estate of Klug. Not wanting to ruin my Wife of<br/>
Klug faction, I decided I&#39;d use Lullaby to nod the<br/>
mob, so that I could run away and continue<br/>
adventuring.  Now keep in mind that I&#39;m 31st<br/>
level, which is WELL beyond the level where I<br/>
should have any problems with Lullaby functioning<br/>
at peak efficiency.  Well, my first attempt was<br/>
resisted entirely...the mob continued to attack<br/>
me, saying, &quot;You will not escape me so easily,<br/>
Daddy00!  More stories!!!&quot;  My second attempt<br/>
appeared to work, but just as I was running away<br/>
(down the stairs) the mob woke up and began<br/>
attacking me again, &quot;Daddy00, I&#39;m scared of the<br/>
fire alarm!&quot;  Again, I fired up Lullaby.  Again,<br/>
the mob appeared to nod off, and I actually almost<br/>
made it to the zone, when it woke up again.  I ran<br/>
back up the stairs to avoid aggroing anything<br/>
else, and Lullabied again.  Only this final one<br/>
stuck.  Now that&#39;s only one out of four attempts,<br/>
for an overal resist rate of 75%!  I think this is<br/>
intolerable, and I may have to stop playing EQ if<br/>
Verant doesn&#39;t fix this obvious nerf.<br/>
