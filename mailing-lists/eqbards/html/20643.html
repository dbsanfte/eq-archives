<div id="ygrps-yiv-335194200">Hi, Jacana!  You ARE awfully cute.  :)  I&#39;ll have to try that with my<br/>
favorite complaining Cleric.<br/>
<br/>
  - /em blushes fiercely<br/>
   Awww your a sweetie to say so....<br/>
<br/>
  I am sure your cleric would just love you for that little trick....<br/>
<br/>
  Only one this time, but it was Kelin&#39;s Lute!  Also got an Imbrued Bracer,<br/>
which I will proudly  wear,  even though the Lambent is better.<br/>
<br/>
  - You&#39;ll have to stop by some time with your clothes on so I can see :)<br/>

  Is the Sarnak Fort good for level 24s?  I want to find someplace in Lake<br/>
of Ill Omen where my Warrior  can sit for a few levels.  She&#39;s too darned<br/>
slow to move around.<br/>
<br/>
  - I hunted at the Lake till level 27(makes that song so long ago...) so<br/>
exp around the whole area is good.  If you want a full group of 24 and up<br/>
the back door of the fort would be fine.  If you have a damn good group<br/>
storm it (we did - and I remember dragging corpses too..).  If you can only<br/>
find one or two people the water ruins are a great pull spot.  The ones that<br/>
are a marker of sorts for the FM zone.  There&#39;s plenty of blues to yellows<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
  If you have any questions about the lower levels of Kunark let me know :)<br/>
I have been living there since 16.  And 11 of those levels were spent at the<br/>
Lake.  The other two in Frontier Mountains.<br/>
