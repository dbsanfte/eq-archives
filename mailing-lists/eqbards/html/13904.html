 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not mad about anything.  I&#39;m just pointing out that it&#39;s<br/>
obviously unbalanced, as counter to your claim that it&#39;s<br/>
balanced.  Classes can do lots of stuff other classes can&#39;t<br/>
do.  But when a class can do something they&#39;re not supposed to<br/>
do better than a class that&#39;s supposed to do it, something is<br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;grass is greener&quot; argument doesn&#39;t prove anything.  <br/>
Either people are complaining because of the &quot;grass is<br/>
greener&quot; phenomenon, or they&#39;re complaining because there&#39;s a<br/>
real problem.  Blaming it on &quot;grass is greener&quot; without<br/>
stating any points to back up your case really doesn&#39;t help us<br/>
determine what is the actual cause.<br/>
