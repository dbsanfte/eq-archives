<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681503154">I hear this a lot.  &quot;Man, did you see that 49/50 Necro soloing the Lord<br/>
room?&quot;  I&#39;ve never seen it done, and no one that I know personally on Fennin<br/>
Ro has seen it done.  I always hear words to the effect of &quot;it just takes a<br/>
bit of strategy&quot;, but no one has every had any comment on what that strategy<br/>
might be.  The Ghoul Lord room, if broken and the three spawns staggered<br/>
perfectly could not be held for any length of time by only one or two<br/>
individuals in my opinion.  The Boks and Guks that spawn there probably have<br/>
around 15,000 hit points and do serious melee damage.  I&#39;ve been in high<br/>
40s/50s groups that have spent three or four minutes killing a single frog.<br/>
If you get a Guk Wizard spawning as the Lord placeholder you&#39;re in serious<br/>
trouble with only two folks and a pet.  When the Lord spawns he has even<br/>
MORE hitpoints and he&#39;s gonna Harm Touch one of ya (and hopefully) be<br/>
procing Ykesha on you.  If you know how one guy can stand up to that I sure<br/>
would like to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
Now granted, I have been in groups with a 50 necro where the pet solod Lava<br/>
Duct Crawlers in Sol B and the pet had more than half health at the end of<br/>
the fight.  Not only that, the necro (Cinder) said &quot;Sigh - you shoulda seen<br/>
my pet *before* they nerfed Necros.&quot;  Well damn.  A single LDC can make a<br/>
full group in their lower 40s run for the zone with a couple of deaths but<br/>
one Necro pet (blue to me) can solo one?  And Necros complain?<br/>

&gt; Heh the lord room is so easy. It&#39;s not as hard as people can<br/>
&gt; think and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen it held with a couple diffrent combos of two people casters<br/>
&gt; and usually<br/>
&gt; one is with pet though. However even after the patch the room is<br/>
&gt; quite easy<br/>
&gt; to crack with 1 necro and 1 person of any other class. It just takes a bit<br/>
&gt; of strategy.<br/>
