<b>Subject:</b> PoA bard quests plus a rant <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409391922">Someone posted a link on the new Concert Hall message board of the new bard<br/>
quests on the PoA.  There are six bard quests and each quest requires you to<br/>
obtain three items to get the reward.<br/>
<br/>
Abashi posted earlier that 200+ class specific items were included in the<br/>
new patch.  It appears that most, if not all, of these 200+ items are<br/>
related to the PoA quests. Each class gets six quests.  Thats 84 new items.<br/>
I only looked at the bard quests, but assuming all class quests require<br/>
three components, thats 252 quests components (84 x3).  Some of the quest<br/>
used the same components so this number is probably a lot lower.  Most of<br/>
the quest components were items I had never heard of so I don&#39;t know if they<br/>
are dropped only in PoA or in other zones.  I assume the 200+ class specific<br/>
items Abashi referred to were the 84 quest reward items and the 252+/- quest<br/>
components.<br/>
<br/>
Rant on: <br/>
I have no problems with Verant adding more stuff for the 46+ players to do.<br/>
That gets them out of the zone where I&#39;m at.  What I do have a concern with<br/>
is the apparent lack of attention given to players less than 46th level.<br/>
With the exception of the class armor quests added a few months back and new<br/>
loot found in Paw, almost every new item/quest that has been recently (past<br/>
few months) added to the game is geared toward the 46+ player.  I am not<br/>
aware of any new items/quests added to the game geared toward medium level<br/>
characters.  Perhaps my observation is subjective, but it seems to me that<br/>
Verant is focusing on keeping the 46+ characters happy at the expense of the<br/>
45- characters. Am I out of line thinking this way?<br/>
<br/>
Caveat: Its quite possible that the new PoA quest component items are<br/>
usuable until they are traded in and obtainable in zones outside of PoA.<br/>
Its also possible that these items are ideally suited for use by medium to<br/>
high level characters.  If this turns out to be true I&#39;ll eat my words.<br/>
<br/>
Rant off<br/>
