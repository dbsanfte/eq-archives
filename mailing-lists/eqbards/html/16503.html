<div id="ygrps-yiv-766257113">Also remember that in Unrest some mobs don&#39;t agro on you once you reach a<br/>
certain level. I can walk around the bottom floor of the house without<br/>
anything agro&#39;ing on me, it&#39;s only when I start going down to the basement<br/>
or up stairs that mobs get higher in level and are more agressive.<br/>

Actually I could go back and get my e-mail from the last great clouding<br/>
debate where I did exactly that test the con and the result with invis on<br/>
and invis off.  What I tend to think people forget is the possibilty of see<br/>
invis being part of some of these creatures.<br/>

&gt; Everyone that I have ever seen purport that Clouding works vs. undead<br/>
seems<br/>
&gt; to have 1 major misconception:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the undead in unrest except Barbed bones (and higher) are under level<br/>
&gt; 20, which means they have green coward code affecting them. You could, at<br/>
&gt; level 30, walk around in unrest pretty much unperturbed by ANY of the<br/>
&gt; undead simply because they won&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re so far above<br/>
&gt; them in level. Just because an undead critter doesn&#39;t attack doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re invisible to them. Try using clouding then CONNING the undead.<br/>
They<br/>
&gt; still con as &#39;ready to attack&#39;. Which means they can see you. They just<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t agg because you are higher level than them. Lyrnia the amused.<br/>
