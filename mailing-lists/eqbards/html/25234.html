<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178399131">You very well maybe right and even if there isnt a low delay cap that makes<br/>
other weapons even better, because there IS max haste.  5/24 + max haste is<br/>
still slower and less dmg then 9/18 + max haste or even 6/23 which would be<br/>
pathetic as well.  The only way I see this weapon being worth a flip is if<br/>
its a proc, the proc lasts a descent amount of time, and you find yourself<br/>
in a group without a bard/enchanter or shaman.  Otherwise I think its<br/>
nothing more than eye candy.  Dont get me wrong I like good looking gear I<br/>
have a set of wicker armor I wear on my Iksar monk from time to time when<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to look &quot;cool&quot;  hehe.  But unless you are rich or really<br/>
just want to look good I think the weapon is going to be over priced.<br/>

It is definitely a twink weapon.  The only one I have seen was on a<br/>
twink, and it does look awesome.  And I think the low delay cap is just<br/>
a rumor, refuted by tests.  No not my tests I am too lazy, just from<br/>
what I have read.<br/>

I think it is trash.  5dmg?  That&#39;s pathetic.  The haste is irrelevant<br/>
as<br/>
you can only have one haste item and one haste &quot;spell&quot; at any given<br/>
time.<br/>
5dmg is dreadfully low and there is a limit as to how low, even with<br/>
haste,<br/>
the dly on a weapon can be.  Max haste isnt that hard to get, and 5/24<br/>
is<br/>
rotten, jade mace 9/18 less than 10k on my server and I am sure lots<br/>
cheaper<br/>
on others.  If you are just looking for the looks then maybe you will be<br/>
happy with it.  But as a weapon for anyone high enough to actually group<br/>
and<br/>
get it.  You probably already have better.  <br/>
