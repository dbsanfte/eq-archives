<div id="ygrps-yiv-558798323">i myself use Blackice firewall. I&#39;ve got no complaints, except that when you<br/>
unban some ip&#39;s they automatically go to your trusted ip list, which is<br/>
silly. I know a friend of mine uses the one that comes with win2000, but i<br/>
dont want to install 2000 on my pc, its running smooth and im not<br/>
reinstalling/giving myself a headache for nothing<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] OT: Recommendation for a home firewall<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of you out there are using firewall software in<br/>
conjunction with EQ.  I currently use Microsoft Internet Connection sharing<br/>
on my home network, but havent installed any firewall software at all, and I<br/>
am a bit nervous about that.<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations?  I am currently looking at WinRoute Pro as a solution.<br/>
