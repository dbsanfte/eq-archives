<div id="ygrps-yiv-709048198"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But in my defense, being a Bard has been<br/>
&gt; *the best* time I&#39;ve had playing EQ to<br/>
&gt; date.  I&#39;ve got a level 24 monk, and he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; dull, dull, desperately dull.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love my Bard; it&#39;s my highest level character, and I&#39;ll keep playing<br/>
him unless Verant nerfs them too much in the future.. But.. if you want<br/>
a *really* fun character to play, make an Ogre Shaman.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me.<br/>

As unamusing as it may sound, my group spent 15 minutes in tears and<br/>
laughter as I ran around sitting on people and passing gas.. Telling<br/>
people to hold still because Zuug&#39;s butt itched. (Ogre&#39;s walk around<br/>
itching their butts all the time) Yeah yeah, so it&#39;s disgusting and<br/>
gross.. but so are Ogres. Believe me when I tell you that my friend had<br/>
to leave the room because he was laughing so hard. Someone kill-stealed<br/>
something from me so I sat on their head and passed gas. It&#39;s amazing<br/>
how people get up and run when they see &quot;Zuug emits an oderous vapor<br/>
towards you!&quot; thinking they&#39;re being attacked.  :) Watching an Ogre<br/>
sneaking up to someone (crouch and walk - looks like you&#39;re sneaking<br/>
and it&#39;s especially cute with Ogre&#39;s.. gives them that &quot;Im guilty&quot;<br/>
look) is enough to make anyone laugh.<br/>

Zuug of Oggok<br/>
&quot;Zuug hav mofo mojo! Zuug give zugg-buffs(tm)!&quot;</div>
