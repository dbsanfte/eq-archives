<br/>
[re: successful leveling]<br/>
I advise all bards overly concerned with the best weapons and damage dealt, <br/>
to review the gifts that you have been given. Nothing sickens me more than <br/>
seeing a forceful party in danger, while the bard is selfishly fighting. <br/>
SHAME ON THAT BARD! If you the bard wants to utilize your talents most <br/>
efficiently, group with 2 warriors (or a monk), 2 rogues, and 1 party member <br/>
that can do emergency heals. Stand back and play your heal with your lute, <br/>
twist whatever other song fits the occasion, and you can fight for hours and <br/>
hours, gain &quot;circles of knowledge&quot; quite quickly. A healthy group prevails, <br/>
so if you want to succeed and learn quickly, this is your best source. Use <br/>
your combat skills when soloing, or with weak groups, BUT always remember in <br/>
large groups, you ARE NOT a tank or a fighter, you are a talented musician.<br/>

[re: biographies]<br/>
I had a great pleasure of leading a rich and comfortable life in the world <br/>
of Ultima. But due to the destruction and corruptions of the lands my &quot;male <br/>
guardians&quot; gave the option of living there alone (and for sure I would have <br/>
suffered) or leave everything and relocate in the lands of Everquest. <br/>
*sniffles* I must say I chose the latter and I remain miserably homesick. <br/>
But enough about my (OT) whining, my bio reads:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Forced to flee my beloved home, my male guardians sang lullabies to comfort <br/>
my woes, may the love for music instilled in my heart protect my guardians <br/>
and the life Tunare has granted us.&quot; (and aye, I read everyone&#39;s bio & for <br/>
you paranoid freaks that fear inspection, NO, I AM NOT LOOKING AT YOUR <br/>
UNDERWEAR, get over it! I wish Verant would do away with the damn inspect <br/>
message)<br/>

[re: twinking]<br/>
Many older EQ citizens have memories of working hard for everything they <br/>
have, and now the youngsters these days are having everything given to them. <br/>
Jealousy runs rampant, but so goes the world. I have had everything given to <br/>
me by my guardians, lol, so I have little to say on the morality of the <br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
(And yes, begging is so annoying but so are the will work for food signs  <br/>
and the &quot;can you spare some change?&quot; line when I &quot;zone&quot; to the real world. <br/>
At least in EQ, I have /ignore!)<br/>
<br/>
May your music allow you to prosper,<br/>
