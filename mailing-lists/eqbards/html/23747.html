<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031704937">Agility over 100 isn&#39;t 1-1, but below 100 there are points where it is more<br/>
than that at your level.  Over 100 I think its about 1-3 AC-Agility.  The<br/>
difference at 75-80 though is considerably more than that.<br/>

I didn&#39;t think Agility was a one for one exchange for AC.  When I have<br/>
gotten Agility buffs in the past, I do not recall my AC increasing the same<br/>
the amount of the Agility buff.  I could be wrong though and if so, that<br/>
would explain why I lost 60 AC when I hit myself with the 51 song.  <br/>

The loss of 45 Agility had the secondary effect of lowering your AC by the<br/>
remainder.  I imagine this was originally tested by encumbering oneself so<br/>
as to lose 45 pts of agility and observing the resultant drop in AC.<br/>

I hit myself with this song last night to test it out.  My agility dropped<br/>
45 pts like the info below states.  However, my AC dropped over 60 pts, 65<br/>
IIRC, which is a big difference from 16 as listed below.  Anyone know why<br/>
there is a disparity between the two numbers?  Does the song work<br/>
differently against PCs versus NPCs?  In other words, PCs lose 60+ AC while<br/>
NPCs only lose 16-18 AC.<br/>

Whats the slow percentage for this song?  It isn&#39;t listed on the EQSongs<br/>
website.  I assume it is 30% like Chains and Largos but just want to<br/>
confirm.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
