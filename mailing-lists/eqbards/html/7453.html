<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bard workaround to binding in evil cities- will thi s work? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100934920">true on both counts, we&#39;re bards and a bit of everything is in us.  we all<br/>
knew that and that&#39;s why we chose the class.  is there anything about the<br/>
bard class that you didn&#39;t know that hit you later on and is making you want<br/>
to switch to another class?  that is the option by the way, switching it<br/>
another class not asking for things we don&#39;t have that other classes do<br/>
have.  this is a general comment, i know you were not suggesting this John.<br/>

&gt; Another interesting twist on this debate:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bards:   Give us bind.<br/>
&gt; Verant:  You are a melee class, you will not get bind.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bards:   Raise our Dodge cap, or give us Parry.<br/>
&gt; Verant:  You are not a true melee class, your defensive combat<br/>
&gt;          skills will only be slightly better than priests.<br/>
