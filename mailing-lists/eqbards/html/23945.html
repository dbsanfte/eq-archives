<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123352853">Sorry Sylly, my question was mainly for the group.  I was agreeing <br/>
with you.  Every dragon/resist necessary encounter that I&#39;ve been to, <br/>
I have never been feared, resist gravity fluxed, taken minimal <br/>
damage, etc.  I was just wondering why people are talking about this <br/>
soft resist cap.  This is the first place that I&#39;ve heard of it.  And <br/>
I was joking about the bard conspiracy.<br/>

the bard<br/>

time<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has this soft cap on resists been confirmed?  Or are we just <br/>
relying <br/>
&gt; on this uberguild leader that may have a conspiracy against bards? <br/>
&gt; LOL!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Not true in my experience.  Bard songs that buff resists do still <br/>
&gt; make a<br/>
&gt; &gt; difference.<br/>
