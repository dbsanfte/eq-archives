<br/>
i see your point, and it struck a cord, somewhat leaves a sour taste in the<br/>
mouth cause i&#39;d rather have a full tackle box with real fishing gear then an<br/>
all in one fragile gimmick.<br/>
<br/>
ya kinda leave me speechless and pondering...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I read the threads on Chains.  And I posted a reply on the Sony board.  And<br/>
I<br/>
tried not to whine TOO much.  But I sure do hate killing my friends :(.<br/>
<br/>
I love playing my bard.  I have played her almost exclusively for the last<br/>
18<br/>
months and I still have a lot of fun.  The bard class suits me and I have<br/>
had<br/>
some amazing times when everything went right and I saved my group.  But<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
getting harder and harder to do that hehe.  Still, I am not going to give<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I got this mental image that I wanted to share here (and I am<br/>
going<br/>
to date myself here)...<br/>
<br/>
You are watching TV late at night, or bowling on Sunday afternoon maybe, and<br/>
a<br/>
commercial comes on for (drumroll please...) the Ronco Fish-O-Matic!<br/>
<br/>
Folks, this is 68 fishing tools in one!  You can leave that heavy, extra box<br/>
full of tools at home, just slip one of these beauties in your tackle box<br/>
and<br/>
you are set!  It&#39;s shiny!  It looks great!  Be the envy of your friends!<br/>
<br/>
So you buy one and head out on your first fishing trip.  And guess what?  It<br/>
sorta works.  It almost does what they said.  You have to put extra effort<br/>
into<br/>
everything, and you have to be really careful because it isn&#39; very sturdy<br/>
and<br/>
you might break it.  And even when you are careful from time to time it just<br/>
snaps and you get a nasty cut.  But it isn&#39;t JUNK exactly....<br/>
<br/>
You getting where I am going with this?  LOL that&#39;s right - bards are the EQ<br/>
equivalent of the all-in-one Fish-O-Matic.  We do work OK much of the time,<br/>
but<br/>
ya gotta be really careful.  And if you can afford to haul the real thing,<br/>
you&#39;d be better off.<br/>
<br/>
With a wry smile and a jaunty salute,<br/>
