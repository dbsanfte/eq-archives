<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628293435">I think it&#39;s great bards can wear chain/banded/etc. What looks more<br/>
dashing than a suit of silver or gold=) As for weapons, I&#39;m not a big<br/>
RPGer so I&#39;m going to continue to use my mino axe until something better<br/>
comes along, like some kind of bard specific weapon( though I doubt<br/>
they&#39;ll have any because of our songs) On a side note What is the best<br/>
place for a 10th level bard to gain good money and decent exp. because I<br/>
am in the process of buying some banded armor.<br/>
