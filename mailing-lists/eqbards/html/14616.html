<div id="ygrps-yiv-71684373"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 45+ to get invited on a dragon raid.  By the time you get to that level a<br/>
&gt; few months down the road, the expansion will likely be out.  Lets say in the<br/>
&gt; expansion Verant raises the level cap to 75.  So by the time us non 45+<br/>
&gt; people get to 45th level, the current level 50s will be fastly approaching<br/>
&gt; 75.  You have to assume that a lot of these 75 people will still go on<br/>
&gt; dragon raids.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Purely speculation on my part, however, I don&#39;t think the new level <br/>
  limit is going to be L75, I think maybe L60 at most.  And that each<br/>
  consectutive level is going to be a hell level.  The fact is Verant<br/>
  can barely meet the needs of today, how on earth are they going to <br/>
  make 25 more songs, when they cannot even finish off 3 of our missing<br/>
  ones.  An extra 25 levels means 4 more circles of spells per class.<br/>
  Those extra levels mean new melee based skills.  Frankly, I don&#39;t<br/>
  think they have the time to do it.  They haven&#39;t gotten it right<br/>
  today, I don&#39;t think they will get it right tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
  Now to apply that to the issue at hand.  You L25 people, you L35<br/>
  people, you will be L50 in what 6 more months? 9 more months? <br/>
  Who cares?  Live up the game to the fullest that it has to offer<br/>
  you at your current level.  Dragons are just a massive deathtrap.<br/>
  When the expansion comes out, based on what I&#39;ve said, you&#39;ll find<br/>
  that you still have plenty of time to build your character to a <br/>
  level where you finally catch up to the people who are doing <br/>
  the big things and you will not be excluded.<br/>
<br/>
  I see a lot of people bash L50s because they are &#39;powerlevelers&#39;<br/>
  and they &#39;don&#39;t understand the fun of the game&#39;, yet I turn around<br/>
  and see those same people whining because they aren&#39;t allowed to<br/>
  go to the planes, or aren&#39;t allowed to be on a dragon hunt.  I <br/>
  put in way too many hours to get where I did.  That said, I have<br/>
  been to and seen 90% of Norrath, and I&#39;d say 75% of it I know<br/>
  like the back of my hand.  I still see L50 players get lost, but<br/>
  I&#39;ve explored, I&#39;ve roamed, I play with and help out the people<br/>
  who need it.  But damn I&#39;m a L50 so I have no idea what it&#39;s <br/>
  like being L25, or shit he&#39;s L50 he won&#39;t talk to me or he won&#39;t<br/>
  help me out.  This bard doesn&#39;t fit that stereotype, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
<br/>
  You see us talking about cool things, or you see us ego boosting<br/>
  it&#39;s because we worked hard to get this far.  I don&#39;t immediately<br/>
  turn on people because they are &#39;green&#39; to me.  I cannot even list<br/>
  the things I&#39;ve done for countless people in different areas of<br/>
  the world.. it&#39;s too staggering.  One guy even said &#39;Wow, I thought<br/>
  you Level 50 people just ignored people like me.&#39;  That makes me<br/>
  feel damn proud when I hear things like that.  I play non-anonymous<br/>
  every night, and I answer every single line of purple text that<br/>
  arrives on my screen.  I don&#39;t need to /who the person and figure<br/>
  out who they are or what level they are, I answer everyone with<br/>
  the upmost respect regardless of their EQ ranking.  I got at least<br/>
  10 tells last night related to bard songs, bard quests, bard info.<br/>
  And I&#39;m happy to help people out in any way I can.  I made 5 new<br/>
  friends in permafrost last week, when me and a friend helped these<br/>
  people clear out the king room whlie getting them exp and quest items.<br/>
  Just yesterday I handed out a full suit of bronze to a L10 warrior.<br/>
  Two shaman were watching us kill ice giants and cheering us on,<br/>
  so I handed each of them 25pp.  Why?  Because I&#39;m a f*ing nice guy,<br/>
  that&#39;s why.  I know exactly how hard it is to be L5, L10, L15, ...<br/>
  I was there, I suffered through those times.  I was broke, I wish<br/>
  I had suchandsuch an item.  I&#39;ve been where all of you have been.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the best way Verant can solve this problem for those of us currently<br/>
&gt; not high enough to go on a dragon raid (if they even consider it a problem),<br/>
&gt; is that once the expansion comes out, put a maximum level limit to zone into<br/>
&gt; Permafrost or Sol B.  Kind of like a reverse Plane level limit.  If they<br/>
&gt; limit entering those zones to level 50s and below , then they don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; worry about level 75s coming in and easily killing a dragon.  They also<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to worry about continually making dragons tougher.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s sort of extreme, but I wouldn&#39;t mind them blocking specific <br/>
  dungeons in the reverse like that.  However, lots of items for quests<br/>
  drop in so many different places, it&#39;s so hard to exclude that broad<br/>
  a range of people.  They need to impose the yield rule and enforce<br/>
  it in a more strict manner.  I will never try to steal exp spawns <br/>
  from a player if it can be helped.  Although, I do not appreciate<br/>
  lower level players busting in on me if I&#39;ve been waiting on something<br/>
  for several hours.  That rarely happens, in fact I&#39;ve never had an<br/>
  item/mob conflict with any lower level person ever.  Then again I&#39;m<br/>
  not usually camping things, I&#39;m out kicking ass and taking names.<br/>
<br/>
  blah blah blah... I talk to much.<br/>
<br/>
  Bottom line, Level 50 players aren&#39;t always what you may think and<br/>
  you will be there one day and you will have all the fun we are <br/>
  having trust me.<br/>
