&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>
&gt; and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk up to 23rd and an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing that the best class in<br/>
&gt; the game was bard..  but I digress.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent, dual Ykeshas, Flowing Black<br/>
&gt; Silk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked out like a level 50<br/>
&gt; that hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago I saw a level 15 in<br/>
&gt; full Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other goodies as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly* discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor that I have and I *still*<br/>
&gt; lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on the sands of Oasis,<br/>
&gt; being *less* complete than a guy that started his bard last weekend.  Not<br/>
&gt; only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having 38 &#39;played&#39; days and not<br/>
&gt; being level 50.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry this bummed you out. This was probably a bored level 50<br/>
playing his twink. It&#39;s a shame he was one of the immature a**hole L50&#39;s<br/>
but unfortunately the game attracts them as well as some pretty cool<br/>
people as well. It&#39;s also too bad that Verant has left the game so empty<br/>
for people at higher levels that all they can do while waiting for the<br/>
occasional plane breakin or dragon run is play other characters. I know<br/>
a lot of my former friends got a lot of fun out of going out and<br/>
gathering equipment for their twinked characters with their L50<br/>
characters. Personally, I tried it for a while, but I found playing a<br/>
twink to be a rather boring thing. When you have an enchanter, as I did,<br/>
decked out in equipment only a L40+ could obtain, it didn&#39;t leave much<br/>
to look forward to but endless levelling. I still don&#39;t begrudge people<br/>
that enjoy playing a twink though. Whatever floats your boat. Personally<br/>
I found it a lot more fun to go play a character on a new server. I had<br/>
(am having) a gas with my druid I started on the tribunal, who used a<br/>
cracked staff for the first 14 levels because he couldnt afford anything<br/>
better and had to pick and choose which spells to buy until L24. Guess I<br/>
just like a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When there ceases to be any way for players&#39; characters to differentiate<br/>
&gt; themselves from one another other based upon level (i.e. time and effort<br/>
&gt; expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want, when people look at me,<br/>
&gt; for them to know that I braved death and died many times to achieve the<br/>
&gt; armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to assume that I bought it from<br/>
&gt; a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>
&gt; &quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>
&gt; different story.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of people bitch and moan about no drop but I actually agree it<br/>
would have been a nice thing if they had made the class quest armor no<br/>
drop. However, I really don&#39;t see the difference between someone who is<br/>
L40+ getting things for themselves or another character they run.<br/>
Really, dispite the jerk factor you&#39;ve experienced from this guy, people<br/>
who are twinking their other characters did put the time and effort in,<br/>
on their other character, and, as someone on the list mentioned in an<br/>
unrelated thread, they probably did it under harder conditions than<br/>
newer characters experience, because they started back when bronze<br/>
wasn&#39;t obtainable until the 20&#39;s or more, and the best weapon most<br/>
people could look forward to was a combine scimitar at that point.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s certainly no reason to look down on people who didn&#39;t advance<br/>
as quickly. Some people just have so little a sense of self worth they<br/>
have to get it any way they can. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;...The bard that I saw in Oasis would have been in steel<br/>
&gt; probably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based upon<br/>
&gt; my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know* that I had earned the<br/>
&gt; pieces for myself.  They would know that I had pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>
&gt; for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not being NO DROP has reduced my<br/>
&gt; efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes me<br/>
&gt; feel this way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather than let it bum you out, why not see that anyone who would laugh<br/>
at you for not being 50 yet should be pitied. While I sympathize with<br/>
your plight however, I also think that this really stems from a bit of<br/>
jealousy, I also think learning to deal with that can be valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Even if they made lambent armor no drop, there would be low level bards<br/>
running around in mithril bp&#39;s, silver legs, azure sleeves, froglok<br/>
crowns and dual ykeshas. The only way that Verant could deal with this<br/>
is to make every item in the game no drop or put level limits on items<br/>
so you can&#39;t equip them and they&#39;ve repeatedly said they won&#39;t do that.<br/>
