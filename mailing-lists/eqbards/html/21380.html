<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771465608">Lol! Well Safe Fall didn&#39;t protect me from my own stupidity of trying to <br/>
chat while twisting Accelerando and Agilmente&#39;s Aria in Dreadlands. I was <br/>
so high up and I had time to attempt to restart Agilmente&#39;s and it would <br/>
have worked, had I not still been in &quot;chat&quot; mode.<br/>
<br/>
But I do love jumping from the Kelethin platforms that got me killed as a <br/>
newbie. :-P<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Talies, I didn&#39;t see that additional qualifier in the poll. Without <br/>
safe fall, the newbies in the nro zone would just hear a&quot;ow, ouch, OUCH, <br/>
OW, ouch, ow&quot; (note doppler affect) throughout their zone as a bard goes <br/>
dune hopping. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My favorite is announcing that something is &quot;on track&quot; and having other&#39;s <br/>
say, &quot;Geez, you get that too?&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;Are you able to hotkey Safe Fall? I use this skill just by falling off<br/>
&gt; &gt;things, not by pressing a hot key for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nah - you&#39;ll notice it also mentioned &quot;can&#39;t live without&quot; - my guess is, a<br/>
&gt;lot of Bards have problems with cliffs ;)<br/>
