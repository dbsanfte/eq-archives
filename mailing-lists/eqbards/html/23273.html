<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769749214">My favorite Cleric (my best RL friend) was grouped with me the last few nights.  He was first complaining<br/>
about being bored.  Twisting Cantata in during combat and singing it in downtime, he wasn&#39;t getting to<br/>
heal anybody.  (Rogues rock).  Then he realized that he could nuke.  Hehe.<br/>

PS - I love the fix they did to mez.  I had a four person group in Seb tonight that handled 7 frogs (five<br/>
initial, two adds) with no Enchanter and no Cleric.  Mez seems to last a little longer than the normal<br/>
song, I can sing a full five during a twist, which lets me control 3-4 things with 1-2 resists.  (Lag<br/>
depending.)<br/>

&gt; doesnt it?) have learned to wait on healing up the less banged up members of<br/>
&gt; the party until they have medded to full mana.  The health regen is quite<br/>
&gt; impressive when I am singing the lvl 55 cantana with the 7 string lute in<br/>
&gt; hand during downtime, especially if another group regen spell is active on<br/>
&gt; the party.  Why should a cleric burn mana on a party member that will regen<br/>
&gt; up over the same time it takes the cleric to regain his mana to a &quot;Ready&quot;<br/>
&gt; level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is just another way of reducing downtime that we have discovered, but<br/>
&gt; one which less experienced clerics and groups do not recognize.<br/>
