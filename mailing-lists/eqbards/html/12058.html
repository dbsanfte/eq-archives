&gt;   ACK!  Healing, yuk yuk.  That&#39;s a big no-no.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Playing Hymm in battle at your level is like hanging a sign<br/>
&gt;   on your back that says, Please Kill Me.  You are more likely to <br/>
&gt;   receive blows in the 30s and 40s at your level.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My hunch is your experience is colored by dual-wielding Yaks<br/>
and doing way more damage than is typical for a bard.  The<br/>
primary problem I&#39;ve been having lately is that I never get<br/>
hit in fights.  Lately, even Hymn hasn&#39;t been enough to get<br/>
mobs on me.  I&#39;ve had to resort to direct taunts like the<br/>
Chant line (which when I tested it last night did 13*3 damage<br/>
and -12 resist to myself, and looked like about (16-18)*3<br/>
damage against mobs).  Btw, the Chant songs are still broken -<br/>
using a drum makes no difference.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of fights, what else is there to play besides Clarity<br/>
and Hymn?<br/>

that you say 12-14 points (healed) each round just doesn&#39;t<br/>
keep up, yet you suggest a damage shield in its place which<br/>
will only do about 8-12 points (damage) each round.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we&#39;ve yet to determine the effectiveness of Clarity when<br/>
the caster is not meditating.<br/>
