&gt;Trying to figure out why they attacked me I make a circle around the temple<br/>
&gt;making sure to con everything there. Ah, there it is. Chief Dooga.<br/>
&gt;Threateningly. How rude.<br/>

teleport to the Karanas when I was trying to do my &quot;fastest time across the<br/>
world&quot; trip.<br/>
Fortunately, a very generous spirit not only teleported me there, he<br/>
invis&#39;d me, and walked me to my corpse, guarding me the whole way.  And<br/>
then refused the payment.  Wow - what a nice guy =)<br/>
<br/>
The difference between my story and yours?  I was bound in Kelethin, and<br/>
heading for Erudin.  Death #1 = the exact same place you died, but Death #2<br/>
was in Kithicor (thanks, Capt. Shralok!).  That&#39;s when I decided to ask for<br/>
a teleport.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and I was only 15th ;)<br/>
