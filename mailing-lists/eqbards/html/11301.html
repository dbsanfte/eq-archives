<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010143474">Hmmm, maybe if someone told verant I use Lullaby to help out lowlevel folks<br/>
they&#39;d get off the stick.<br/>
<br/>
Go to CB - fire it up when a train comes - newbies LOVE it. As it seems to<br/>
most often misfire now - I&#39;m taking the heat - big deal, if they can&#39;t hit<br/>
ya, they can&#39;t hurt ya. If it worked as intended, I still wouldn&#39;t take any<br/>
damage, the area would just be a bit quieter.<br/>
<br/>
Bard hatred is hard on folks that play the game the way Verant intended -<br/>
GET TO LEVEL 50!. I don&#39;t care if I EVER reach level 50, I have too much<br/>
fun helping lower level folks, and bard hatred is THE best tool in the game<br/>
when helping a newbie - while still letting them do the work.<br/>
<br/>
Gee - think they might rethink that whole bard hate thing cause of this,<br/>
muhahaha.<br/>

&gt;If you aren&#39;t able to effective employ Lullaby, or it seems ineffectual,<br/>
&gt;ask constructively how others use it in this forum. Personally when I<br/>
&gt;solo, if there is any chance I&#39;ll fight a caster, Lullaby is memm&#39;d. It<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So now you&#39;re trying to tell me Lullaby is only for interrupting casters?<br/>
&gt;Not true, when it works it definitely causes a mob to stand there and do<br/>
&gt;nothing until hit or the duration ends.  However, it is broken.  Perhaps<br/>
&gt;last nights example can make this clear to you.  I was running thru BB and<br/>
&gt;paused to watch a couple of people fighting near the entrance in case they<br/>
&gt;need help.  After a bit I punched up a song to run again and hit the wrong<br/>
&gt;button, Lullaby.  I got the following, obviously incorrect results.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	A gnoll pup nods<br/>
&gt;	A gnoll pup nods<br/>
&gt;	A gnoll pup nods<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The incorrect part is the three gnoll pups then ran over to me and started<br/>
&gt;attacking immediately.  The song did absolutely nothing to the gnoll pups<br/>
&gt;except add me to their hate list.  Absolutely nothing.  As soon as the<br/>
&gt;effect hit them they zipped over to me and started attacking.  I stood there<br/>
&gt;with the song up waiting just for experimentation.  It took 12 pulses, all<br/>
&gt;successful nods by the way, no resists, before all three gnoll pups stopped<br/>
&gt;attacking.  Now no matter what class I was playing if I cast a spell on a<br/>
&gt;mob and got the message showing it failed to resist and the song had no<br/>
&gt;effect I would be upset.  The majority of my issues have as little to do<br/>
&gt;with the bard class specifically as with Verant&#39;s attitude towards bugs in<br/>
&gt;general.  If they are beneficial fix them immediately!  If they are<br/>
&gt;negative, fix them when they get around to it.  This attitude is compounded<br/>
&gt;by the fact that Verant very apparently never, ever, considers the effects<br/>
&gt;of their code changes on bards.  I mean wtf?  It took them 6 months of our<br/>
&gt;saying that Alenia&#39;s did not do anything before they bothered to look into<br/>
&gt;it?  Had someone instead complained that Alenia&#39;s was removing all buffs<br/>
&gt;from every mob in the zone about 1 time in 1000 it would have been looked<br/>
&gt;into instantly and an immediate patch put in if it was found to be true.<br/>
&gt;Being versatile is no recompense for being ignored and dismissed as<br/>
&gt;unimportant.<br/>
