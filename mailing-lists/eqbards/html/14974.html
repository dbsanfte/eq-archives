<div id="ygrps-yiv-737897844">Hi all,<br/>
    It seems the new song ideas debate crops up every month or so, thus I<br/>
decided to cull all the ideas together on a web page for everyone discuss.<br/>
If you&#39;d like to submit a song idea or a proposal (a tweak to an existing<br/>
song), please email it to<br/>
<br/>

subject: eqbards song ideas<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post the ideas to<br/>

<br/>
Hopefully we can get the best of the lot then I&#39;ll try and direct exturnal<br/>
traffic to the information (read: hopefully Verant).<br/>
<br/>
There is a sample format on the page, please try and follow it, employing<br/>
strong writing skills.  Nothing wrong with biffisms (well, yes there is, I<br/>
HATE them -- ur not mad r u d00dz? k3wl.), but it is generally easier to<br/>
persuad someone if your presentation is lucid and well structured.  Also,<br/>
please bear in mind that, with 2 exceptions, none of our songs are as<br/>
powerful as a comperable casted verison and I would not anticipate any new<br/>
song to deviate.  As well, our songs are generally party in nature or area<br/>
of effect and fall in the broad categories of buffs, debuffs, and travel.<br/>
We have three ulility songs, perhaps thats an area of exploration.  As<br/>
always, try and consider the implications of the your proposed<br/>
implimentation with respect to stacking, twisting combinations and class<br/>
balance.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
