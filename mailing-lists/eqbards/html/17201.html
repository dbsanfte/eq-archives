 </span></blockquote>When I took my Bard there at about that level, I found the best thing was <br/>
to group with one or two tanks (Trolls and Ogres LOVE this), and just sit <br/>
back and play the healing song.  The only thing that slows tanks down here <br/>
is healing - and if you can keep them healed (and throw in some occasional <br/>
damage like with Chords of Dissonance or Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow, so you <br/>
don&#39;t even have to switch instruments), they&#39;ll love you forever.<br/>
<br/>
I got about half a level in one night just doing this.  In fact, I went afk <br/>
to work on some paperwork and just left my Bard standing nearby, strumming <br/>
the Hymn.  When the tanks were wounded, they&#39;d sit near me, then run out, <br/>
kill some more, and come back.  Spent about two hours like that and only <br/>
got hit twice ;)<br/>
