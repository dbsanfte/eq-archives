<br/>
I have full platemail (bronze) and it suits me nicely. The damage it can<br/>
take seems to have a significant advantage over banded. In a group I am<br/>
valued as a tank in that I can take a lot of damage, though not necessarily<br/>
dish it out. Whatever hits me, hits me for less than my non-platemail<br/>
companions.<br/>

&gt;1) Acually, Paladins get Double Attack, but not Dual Wield. It&#39;s still true<br/>
&gt;that only a warrior has both.<br/>

&gt;P.S. I agree about the plate. I can&#39;t see my bard ever wearing plate<br/>

&gt;&gt;Dual wield at 17 is really cool, and Bellows in place of kick is fine, but<br/>
&gt;&gt;why no dual attack?  Apparently the bardic class was VERY powerful in beta<br/>
&gt;&gt;and had to be toned down but I am thinking maybe it was toned down in the<br/>
&gt;&gt;areas that made it too powerful and forgotten about in the areas it is<br/>
&gt;very &gt;weak in.  Am I totally off base?  I mean why give me the capability<br/>
&gt;to have &gt;skills I will never be very good at?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Paladins also do not get dual attack.  It&#39;s what makes a warrior<br/>
&gt;special.  Remember, we can even wear plate (which I personally think is a<br/>
&gt;mistake.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) cf. JOAT (Jack of All Trades, Master of None.)  We can do a lot of<br/>
&gt;different things - but we will never be the masters at any one of them that<br/>
&gt;the class we&#39;re borrowing them from is.  Rogues will always be better<br/>
&gt;lockpickers, sneakers and trap disarmers. Monks will always fall better<br/>
&gt;than we can.  Rangers will always forage better.  And Warriors will always<br/>
&gt;fight better.  It is not in a single thing that we are great, but that in<br/>
&gt;all things we are good.<br/>
