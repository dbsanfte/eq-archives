<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049446433">Last night I sold my Lute of the Gypsy princess to a vendor for 3pp. Damn<br/>
game, that was a gift from my guild.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard rumors that this Lute doesn&#39;t do anything good, can anyone<br/>
confirm this for me? Might make me feel a little better.<br/>
