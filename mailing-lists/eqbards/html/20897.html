<b>Subject:</b> dex and procing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-107336574">does anyone know how much more procing goes on at various dex levels above<br/>
100? My base is 95, with my best AC stuff it&#39;s at 107. I have a BP neclace<br/>
(mostly to get my agility above 100) which takes it to 114. I *could* swap<br/>
out a jagged band or two for 5 dex/7 cha rings and so get it as high as 124.<br/>
but I lost 5AC for the neclace and would lose another 5 or 10 with the rings<br/>
(mind you I am in full lambent at 15, so I should have a *bit* of room to<br/>
move on AC)<br/>
<br/>
Procing will be a big deal for me this time around (I haven&#39;t mentioned my<br/>
latest bard project), I have an Obsidian shard and a Blade of Fiery<br/>
Lamentations. The shard procs at 16 and I have not found an answer on the<br/>
BoFL but one person (I think on concert hall) claimed theirs did at 19, I am<br/>
heading towards finding out. If the BoFL procs a lot more with higher dex it<br/>
could be a huge difference in my teens and twenties.<br/>
<br/>
Quick side note, I have shelved Tszaaz and started this new bard to replace<br/>
him. Why? Lots of reasons, but hunting at lower levels is easier when you<br/>
can&#39;t play much. I DO like the big difference in stats (new guy is a half<br/>
elf) even if I hate the Star Trek (Original) pants and bucket head.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone have any real statistics? Also I assumed that getting agi over<br/>
100 was important, is there some magic number in particular to reach?<br/>
