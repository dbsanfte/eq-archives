<div id="ygrps-yiv-909774844"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; - You can cast cancel magic on pets.  If a mob you&#39;re fighting has<br/>
&gt; several buffs on it, you can charm it, then let a party member hit <br/>
&gt; it with several cancels without it going aggro on him.  This <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t work so well with casting mobs since they usually just <br/>
&gt; rebuff themselves.  I suppose you could try doing this to drain <br/>
&gt; their mana (cancel tends to be a cheap spell).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The cancel-&gt;nullify-&gt;pillage line of spells do not count as offensive spells (hence why you can cast it on non-grouped PC&#39;s).  If a mob is not within agro range, or if they cons dubious or better, you can cancel indefinitely and they will take no offensive action towards you.<br/>

I used this tactic on my cleric to solo the evil eye in lower guk.  Keep nullifying it it&#39;s completely debuffed and start nuking when it&#39;s still trying to rebuff itself, so that it&#39;s in the middle of casting when my nuke hits and it take the eye a few seconds to finish casting before it can do anything to me.<br/>
