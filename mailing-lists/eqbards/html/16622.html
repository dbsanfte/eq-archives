&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s something similar to an idea I&#39;ve been tossing around for a<br/>

about UO (from a designer&#39;s standpoint) was people recalling<br/>
from the bank to the hunting grounds, fighting until full of<br/>
loot, recalling to the bank, selling and dropping stuff off,<br/>
then recalling bank.  While it was convenient, it destroyed<br/>
most of the immersion factor of the game by eliminating the<br/>
travel component.  Verant has been very careful to avoid this<br/>
(why none of the teleport points are in or very near high<br/>
level hunting grounds, PoH and PoS excepted since it costs<br/>
money to teleport to them).  They&#39;re not going to give us a<br/>
song that lets us do it.<br/>
