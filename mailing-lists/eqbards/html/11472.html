&gt; I used to try this, but in my parties, which are usually tank<br/>
&gt; heavy, so much<br/>
&gt; is flying by in the chat window that I&#39;m already at information overload.<br/>
&gt; Maybe I should turn on some of those filters...  Nah, I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stand to miss<br/>
&gt; something :-).  It wouldn&#39;t be the same if I didn&#39;t throw in that &quot;Nice<br/>
&gt; Crit!!&quot; comment here or there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After my first day in the priest room in Sol B, I turned off all hits and<br/>
misses except those made by me and on me.  I was of the same opinion as you<br/>
at that time, but the spam from three different groups of 6 in three<br/>
different room around the priest room changed my mind. :)<br/>
<br/>
This is a long winded way of saying I still get to say nice Crit, because<br/>
apparently that is something that can&#39;t be turned off.  I still see each and<br/>
every one of them.<br/>
