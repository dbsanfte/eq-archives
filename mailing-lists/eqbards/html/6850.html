&gt;- A lot of players don&#39;t understand that when two mobs fight, it&#39;s usually<br/>
&gt;because one is charmed, and they&#39;ll jump in to &quot;your&quot; fight without<br/>
&gt;asking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This part can be kinda funny though.  I was using charm to take on a pair of <br/>
shadowmen in WC the other night.  I had charmed the Necro caster and was <br/>
doing well (it had feared it&#39;s ex-pet away and was beating the melee mob <br/>
down well) when a party came by and &#39;decided&#39; to help.  Well they blew all <br/>
their mana on the Necro mob (my pet).  It killed the melee SM and then <br/>
easily finished of the nearly dead caster.<br/>
<br/>
Also if anyone has not volunteered yet I have a chunk of webspace available <br/>
on my @home account that can be used to host the final guide, along with the <br/>
FAQ for the list if it is needed.<br/>
