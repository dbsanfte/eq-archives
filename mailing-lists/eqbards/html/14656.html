<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632525548">This is my first stab at a serious song. This one is about a couple, a cleric and a wood elf, who actually met in game, and are now dating long distance in RL. <br/>

<br/>
Someday, <br/>
We´┐¢ll be together. <br/>
Through stormy weather, <br/>
We will hold each other. <br/>
Until then, <br/>
I will be with you, <br/>
In the world we make true, <br/>
In our own imagination <br/>
<br/>
You´┐¢re a nimble wood elf girl <br/>
From the tree´┐¢s of Kelethin <br/>
Your fairness is beyond compare, <br/>
More lovely though, your heart within. <br/>
A laugh from your will make me smile; <br/>
I´┐¢m at rest when you´┐¢re at play. <br/>
Many friends can bring good cheer, <br/>
But I´┐¢m alone when you´┐¢re away. <br/>
<br/>
One way <br/>
Or another, <br/>
We will discover, <br/>
The joy of touching. <br/>
(Until then) <br/>
We´┐¢ll meet <br/>
In a world of beauty <br/>
A world of danger <br/>
A world we call our own. <br/>
<br/>
You´┐¢re a healer through and through <br/>
Helping out ones in distress <br/>
You´┐¢ve healed my body many times. <br/>
You´┐¢ve healed my heart of loneliness <br/>
I wish upon the stars and moon <br/>
And on the paths that planets roam <br/>
Longing for the coming day <br/>
When children´┐¢s laughter fills our home. <br/>
<br/>
Someday <br/>
We´┐¢ll be together <br/>
And we´┐¢ll remember <br/>
Our home away from home</div>
