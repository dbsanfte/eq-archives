<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975806084">After having read the original message, and this further explanation I feel<br/>
very uncomfortable. A bard in the classical sense was a teacher of the<br/>
masses, in their historical guise as first level Druids they where charged<br/>
with helping the masses where the priests where unable to. Their stories and<br/>
songs contained news, moral lessons, and good advice on life, love, and<br/>
happiness. For any to say you are wrong, and I do not have the time to<br/>
correct is only self serving. Even the message I am replying to seems more a<br/>
justification that and explanation... Even to say Look at my &#39;experience&#39; is<br/>
a misnomer for much &#39;experience&#39; can be granted for being in the right place<br/>
at the right time. It does not mean one has learned anything.<br/>
<br/>
	A bard never has to say here are my credentials, for they know it is in<br/>
their words, songs, and actions where they will be found. A bard is a<br/>
chronicler of others not themselves. Leaving it to others to decide on the<br/>
value of their  works. I am greatly distressed by this thread, but more over<br/>
the personal attack on others without offering help. For that shows one that<br/>
is more worried about being found inadequate rather than wishing to be a<br/>
light in the darkness. For it is good to offer what one thinks is true, and<br/>
allow ones self to be corrected. rather than keep quiet and not know the<br/>
true value of ones knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
	It is easy to throw snipes, to be a source takes much more.<br/>
<br/>
	I also an thankful this thread came up, for I had just sent a application<br/>
to that guild. For it has allowed me to see I was wrong in applying. I am<br/>
glad for it allows me to ask that the application be rescinded before anyone<br/>
puts any work into it. I can not belong to a group that would allow, and<br/>
possibly foster this attitude. For a group is as strong as it weakest<br/>
member. and all members reflect on the whole. I have nothing bad to say<br/>
about them, and still believe them to be a good group, with good ideals. it<br/>
is just not for me.<br/>
<br/>
	I wish I could find a guild that I feel comfortable with, and may some day<br/>
will. Who knows maybe I will find a like group of people who seek service to<br/>
others over personal fame and recognition. I may someday find a group who<br/>
think the same as I and we could form such a group our selves. but that is<br/>
to time to choose...<br/>
<br/>
	So please, if you have advise to offer, please do. If not please do not<br/>
just defame, but rather allow others to offer the proper corrections. For it<br/>
will help the poster as well as the reader if a post (no matter how wrong)<br/>
is made. so all can find the truth. To remain silent is to remain ignorant.<br/>
I am not saying that you do not have a right to your option, say what you<br/>
feel you should, I only hope to say that others should not stop speaking for<br/>
worry of what another may say. For if I have a problem, that is what the<br/>
&#39;Ignore&#39; feature of my Mail client is for...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
	PS - I have left the reply train mostly in tact (which is unlike I usually<br/>
do, for I like to keep them short but) for those that do not have access to<br/>
the full train of thought that I am replying to. I am sorry, but felt it<br/>
important in this respect. I will do my best to refrain from doing it again.<br/>

&gt; Dear Berk,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &#39;Tis sad to see a bard speak so harshly. You don&#39;t know me well, then. My<br/>
&gt; intent is to prevent a novice bard from getting incorrect information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Being a founder of the Soerbaird, with members who have put hours of time<br/>
&gt; into various Beta Phases, and much research into all things<br/>
&gt; Bardic, I would<br/>
&gt; say I have access to a lot of good information and research. I<br/>
&gt; need only to<br/>
&gt; turn to my fellow Soerbaird for accurate information I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; already have. A<br/>
&gt; level 25 bard in our guild seems to be quite a rich source of experiential<br/>
&gt; knowledge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our guild is built to be a boon for Bards, and thus it&#39;s my<br/>
&gt; charge, as well<br/>
&gt; as the charge all Soerbaird to be helpful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess I don&#39;t think it&#39;s arrogant or selfish to ask people to<br/>
&gt; be accurate<br/>
&gt; rather than wrong. I don&#39;t think young bards want to be given incorrect<br/>
&gt; information. &quot;Guesstimates&quot; are fine, so long as they are posed<br/>
&gt; that way. My<br/>
&gt; contention was that people were posting incorrect information as truth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for time, I give what time I have to providing a source of<br/>
&gt; information to<br/>
&gt; Soerbaird as well as to anyone interested. I built the Soerbaird<br/>
&gt; web site as<br/>
&gt; a resource for you or anyone else - as well as for my guild. I have indeed<br/>
&gt; invested many hours into developing this information storehouse<br/>
&gt; for you and<br/>
&gt; anyone else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While it&#39;s only 1 week old, the site will soon be overflowing with<br/>
&gt; information for young and old bards alike. I can tell you the<br/>
&gt; leaders of the<br/>
&gt; Soerbaird spend little time powergaming, and much time tinkering with<br/>
&gt; quests, writing ballads, and testing techniques for bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you might imagine, it takes time to document research, and I&#39;m always<br/>
&gt; grateful to those who do.<br/>

&gt; Why don&#39;t you enlighten all us poor dunces<br/>
&gt; with your incredible deductive prowess?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, what, you don&#39;t have the time?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You would prefer to passively benefit only<br/>
&gt; from the most exacting research of others,<br/>
&gt; and not their guesstimates? Personally I follow<br/>
&gt; the big grain of salt rule for almost anything<br/>
&gt; that comes across my cable modem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My preliminary deduction is that you are selfish<br/>
&gt; and arrogant.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I could spend hours trying to correct a lot of misinformation<br/>
&gt; being posted<br/>
&gt; &gt; by some people. I would ask that if you aren&#39;t 100% sure about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; information you give, don&#39;t post it as a statement, rather ask it as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; question.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It reveals to me there&#39;s a lot of poor deductive logic going on<br/>
&gt; with some<br/>
&gt; &gt; players - drawing conclusions from game experiences that are<br/>
&gt; more based on<br/>
&gt; &gt; coincidence than on good research.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t care to try and correct some of these things - I just ask that,<br/>
&gt; &gt; going forward, people be more cautious about the things they declare as<br/>
&gt; &gt; truth.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There&#39;s a big difference between:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ---- &quot;Hill Giants can outrun Selo&#39;s&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; ---- &quot;A Hill Giant seemed to outrun my Selo&#39;s, has anyone else<br/>
&gt; seen this?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The complicated thing is that one MAY have tested this fully, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; thus could<br/>
&gt; &gt; say:<br/>
&gt; &gt; ---- &quot;I tried running 10 times from a Hill Giant and here are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; results....&quot;<br/>
