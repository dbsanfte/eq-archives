<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-310571479">Not so far.  The Arctic Wyvern Studded armor has not been made yet since one<br/>
of the components does not appear to be in game.  There is one new type of<br/>
tailored armor that bards can wear,(Reinforced Cobalt Drake) but the AC is<br/>
so low I doubt we ever would except perhaps for the Charisma plus arms.<br/>

Several new tailoring recipes were added with the Velious expansion.  Some<br/>
of these recipes were class specific.  Monks can wear items tailored from<br/>
the pelts of black panthers.  Rangers use tigeraptor pelts.  Not certain if<br/>
any other classes get class specific tailored items.  Does anyone know if<br/>
there are new tailored items for bards only?<br/>
