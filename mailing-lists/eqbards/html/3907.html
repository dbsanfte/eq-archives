<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375906179">Well, I just wanted to say this list is a real gem. Tons of good info and<br/>
quality folks. I have been studying online cultures for a lot of years now,<br/>
usenet, a martial arts mailing list, web boards, UO and EQ (and RZ which was<br/>
a whole different animal till they broke it), it&#39;s just a hobby, the<br/>
sociology of online cultures. And this is a good un.<br/>
<br/>
I DO wish there were a better mechanism for off topic stuff, because when<br/>
you have a good group of smart folks you begin to want to know what they<br/>
think about off topic, er, topics. Subject flags can help I suppose but<br/>
folks always forget to put them in, a seperate mailing list breaks the<br/>
perception of a social collective. *sigh* I don&#39;t think there is an easy<br/>
answer. But I just wanted to say I have no problem with off topic issues (in<br/>
fact there was one I really liked- about women run quests-that had to end<br/>
*sigh* at least I missed it if it continued as I was changing addresses<br/>
where I got the list) but I do understand the culture also breaks down if<br/>
it&#39;s not focused. SO! Keep up the good work everyone,<br/>
