<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445537613">Its simpler than that, and worse in most cases.  generally resisting either<br/>
one cause a total resist of the spell.  That sends you back to the 49.75% I<br/>
sent in the other post.  Yech.<br/>

&gt; We all know that mobs get a second resist check against pixie strike and<br/>
&gt; lullaby.  Lets say for the first check they get a 25% (1 out of 4) chance<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; resist and a 33% (1 out of 3) chance for the second resist.  Whats the<br/>
&gt; overall chance that they make just one of the two resists?<br/>
<br/>
/em steps up to the plate.<br/>
<br/>
Two resist checks, first (.25), second (.33).  If they succeed in<br/>
resisting just one, they must fail the other, so<br/>
<br/>
(.25)*(.67)=(.1675) for a success and failure,<br/>
(.75)*(.33)=(.2475) for a failure and success,<br/>
for a total of (.41) or 41% chance of resisting just one.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, not knowing whether it was a single or double resist, you might<br/>
want to factor in a success and success, that being<br/>
<br/>
(.25)*(.33)=(.0825)<br/>
<br/>
totalling (.4925) or 49.25% chance of resist on a strike with given<br/>
values.<br/>
