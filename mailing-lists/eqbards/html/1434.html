Best I can figure, after 40 odd levels of barding, is that Charisma is a<br/>
very very mild stat for anything other than shopping.  Even wearing a<br/>
grotesque mask (-9 CHA) and skunk sprayed, dropping my CHA down to 52, my<br/>
resist rate is still insignificant.  Boosting it up to 140 via a Shaman&#39;s<br/>
44th level Charisma spell likewise had little effect.  It may have more<br/>
impact in the future as Geoffry tunes the class a bit more, and gets some<br/>
more coding time to do things the way they had planned, but don&#39;t hold your<br/>
breath.</div>
