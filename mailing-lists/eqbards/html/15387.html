<div id="ygrps-yiv-593277987">Hehehe, I remember a AD&D module where a black dragon (fairly bright<br/>
creature, mind you) had a black-dragon slayer in his treasure horde.  My<br/>
dragon-slayer paladin was of course pretty excited to get the sword, but<br/>
it bothered me that the dragon never figured out a way to destroy it... <br/>
Talk a &quot;sword with you name on it&quot;<br/>
