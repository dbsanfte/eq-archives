<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828206412">Hail all,<br/>
Well, just made 20th level over the weekend (and as a result of my recent,<br/>
now ending, unemployment :o).<br/>
<br/>
For the last couple of levels when I solo (90% of the time) I have taken to<br/>
the following cycle (this was against reavers in E Karana, vs. Magic users<br/>
to follow)<br/>
<br/>
Accelerondo to pull<br/>
<br/>
Bellow to tag, and to give a little head start on damage while going back to<br/>
an area to fight that was on no wandering mob path.<br/>
<br/>
Warsong/Dennons Disruptive Dischord for the fight.<br/>
<br/>
This was the best combo I found, any suggestions of things I missed? Against<br/>
Magic casters it was<br/>
<br/>
Guardian Rhythms to pull<br/>
 Warsong/Guardian/Bellow or Dischord depending on the location<br/>
<br/>
Now I am adding Largos binding so against non casters I figure it will<br/>
change to<br/>
<br/>
Warsong/Lago/Dennons Disruptive Dischord for the fight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At this level the healing song is still useless in the fight correct? Any<br/>
thing I am missing?<br/>
<br/>
Since the bronze armour question was raised, my Str is 80 (85 with item<br/>
buffs) I am sticking with the Dwarven tunic until I find something better,<br/>
those 33 heat/33 cold/33 magic resists are still nice to have around. I<br/>
forget my total AC, but my current armour set (weighing in around 50)is:<br/>
<br/>
Bronze helm (sorry, the wood elf/bronze look was to good to pass up, no<br/>
other reason for buying it *blushes*)<br/>
Bronze mask<br/>
Onyx earrings (+2 dex)<br/>
Spiked collar (+3 str)<br/>
Bronze shoulders (hope to replace with Blood Stained Mantle)<br/>
Dwarven ringmail tunic(12 AC, 33 heat/33 cold/33 magic resist)<br/>
Lizardscale Cloak (+5dex)<br/>
Barbed arms(+2 dex)<br/>
Banded bracers (bronze is WAY too heavy for little gain, currently searching<br/>
for an &quot;exotic&quot;)<br/>
Elf-hide gloves(+5 agi, dex, JUST got them have wanted these forever, I like<br/>
to imagine they are Teir&#39;Dal :o)<br/>
Dervish rings<br/>
Purity belt(dex,str, I have been THINKING of a thick leather apron just for<br/>
the AC, but there is also an Elf-hide belt, no idea on stats, just that it<br/>
is Bard only)<br/>
Bronze legs<br/>
Bronze boots (which HAVE to go, they are way to heavy, but I haven&#39;t found a<br/>
good replacement yet)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or idea would be helpful.<br/>
