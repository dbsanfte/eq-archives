<div id="ygrps-yiv-398585487">On another somber note.  The highest level incarnation of Dragoon Zytl now<br/>
also cast that same spell or a lower level equivalent.  It does heavy damage<br/>
and slows me with accel and drum to below normal walk speed.  At first I<br/>
thought I was at really low health, but I actually still had two bubbles+.<br/>
It was very deadly as he easily caught up to me and ripped me in two with<br/>
that halberd of his.  How he does that kinda damage with a rusty Halberd<br/>
will always remain a mystery.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, E&#39;ci&#39;s version of the event got screwed up by some greedy high <br/>
&gt;leevls.  Most all of the good NPC&#39;s were killed and I don&#39;t think anyone <br/>
&gt;got rewarded except for those who got to loot the undead and dark elves <br/>
&gt;(read greedy high level bastards).  The high levels weren&#39;t all bad, <br/>
&gt;though, some would leave the loot if they couldn&#39;t use it and broadcast to <br/>
&gt;the zone where it was...so some greedy high level (who probably couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;use it) would come and pick it up.  Bitter? Nah.  Actually I only died once<br/>
<br/>
&gt;in the whole thing, when I was blinded by Innoruk&#39;s hate.  Friend of mine <br/>
&gt;died at least 3 times and lost exp everytime.  My guess for the portal is <br/>
&gt;Kithicor or Nektulos forest.  I doubt they&#39;d put a portal in a town, even <br/>
&gt;if it is Neriak.  I just wish I had something to show for my 3 hours of <br/>
&gt;running around the continent.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrm.  My experiences in this event were somewhat underwhelming as well... I <br/>
was in Mistmoore when a friend told me something was happening in Nektulos <br/>
and HighKeep.  Having missed every server event so far in the time I&#39;ve been<br/>
<br/>
playing (well, there weren&#39;t that many, come to think of it) I decided to <br/>
come check it out.<br/>
<br/>
As I arrived in Freeport, I discovered that the Tier&#39;dal GM had moved to the<br/>
<br/>
East Commons... warning sign #1.  When I entered the East Commons, I was a <br/>
bit surprised to see a Tier&#39;dal Chaplain, a Tier&#39;dal Ritualist, and a <br/>
Tier&#39;dal High Priest all sitting around chattign by the zone.  Well, I had <br/>
my MM Battledrums, and this was countryside I have known well for months, so<br/>
<br/>
I had no fear.  I ran away with full confidence... until I was smitten by <br/>
some bloody spell or other that slowed me to a crawl and took nearly all my <br/>
life.  The follow-up, of course, killed me - I think it was the High Priest,<br/>
<br/>
so I didn&#39;t feel too bad... after all, he was probably twice my level.<br/>
<br/>
Once I recovered my body, I followed the GMs to the West Commons - a glutton<br/>
<br/>
for punishment, me... but honestly I was rather hoping I&#39;d be able to gather<br/>
<br/>
all the plotlines and writeup the story on behalf of the League of Antonican<br/>
<br/>
Bards.  Well, I found the Tier&#39;dal NPCs with an attendant crowd of PCs: DE, <br/>
troll, ogre, and a handful of others all invisible and (speakig for myself <br/>
at least) rather scared.  There was one Tier&#39;dal attendant, whose name is on<br/>
<br/>
the many screenshots I took but which escapes me now, who was easily more <br/>
intimidating than Innoruuk&#39;s Daughter.  This guy was levitating over <br/>
everyone&#39;s heads (I mean his feet were at all times at eye level), and he <br/>
carried a horrible looking scythe... I was careful not to get too close.<br/>
<br/>
We all entered Kithicor, and that&#39;s where the Hells broke loose.  The GMs <br/>
were supposed to meet each other in battle apparently.  Well, the evil group<br/>
<br/>
stopped at the crossroads, and we all waited around while Lanis T&#39;vil <br/>
(spelling, sorry do&#39;t recall exactly) taled to her daddy Innoruuk.  Well, <br/>
after a few minutes her bodyguard walked over to me and said, &quot;Be gone&quot;, <br/>
then turned and went back to the group.  I should have heeded his warning...<br/>
<br/>
within 5 seconds I heard &quot;A Tier&#39;dal Elder Ritualist begins to cast a spell&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and I was fleeing through Kithicor, scared out omy wits.  I ran right into <br/>
the open arms of some other DE necro, who I never even had a chance to greet<br/>
<br/>
before I awoke in Freeport yet again.  You have lost a level!  You are now <br/>
level 25.<br/>
<br/>
At this point the zone went down, and it took me some 30 mintues to get back<br/>
<br/>
into Kithicor to loot my corpse.  I found most of the others, who had <br/>
somehow lost track of the GMs.  The battle waged on, and, as you al know, <br/>
evil prevailed that day.  The crowning moment was when we were warned by <br/>
Innoruuk himself to flee, and then my screen showed &quot;Hate0 tries to cast a <br/>
spell on you, but you are protected.  Pain and suffering tries to strike YOU<br/>
<br/>
but misses.  You died.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I returned to the zone and recovered my body, and watched the <br/>
aftermath - I noticed that, of about 180 people in Kithicor at the end of <br/>
the event, 16 were bards.  Way to go, guys!  I do&#39;t think I have ever been <br/>
anywhere with so many fellow songweavers, or anywhere where we comprised <br/>
such a large portion of the populous.<br/>
<br/>
Kithicor is now chock full of NASTY undead, as is Qeynos Hills - after 3 <br/>
deaths at this &quot;event&quot; I went to Qeynos to help a young bard recover his <br/>
corpse (lost in the aquaducts) and discovered that Qeynos Hills is also <br/>
teemig with undead.  I personally met Varshoon the Undying (red as death) <br/>
and got to experience once agai the joy and marvel that is fleeing across a <br/>
zone out of control.  Argh, I hate necromancers.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I was unimpressed with the whole event - there were precious few <br/>
things that I had any chance of fighting, far too many I had NO chance <br/>
against, and PL and lag were horrible across 5 zones.  To top it off, I <br/>
missed most of the story, and had topiece it together by asking friends.  Ah<br/>
<br/>
well, someone else has to play historian, next time they throw an event I am<br/>
<br/>
staying in Mistmoore where it&#39;s safe. = P<br/>
