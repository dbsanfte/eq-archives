&gt; <br/>
&gt; There seemed to be some confusion this weekend about Medium Bronze Armor on the<br/>
&gt; list. <br/>
[...]<br/>
&gt; I got my Med Bronze breastplate from Perma, however i did buy the Hat (ick) and<br/>
&gt; Legs, because i am too much of a not-camper to sit in a dungeon that long.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding was that the only mobs in Perma that dropped bronze<br/>
were the elite guards at the back by the diplomat. At L19 I would have<br/>
thought that they might be a bit hard to reach, even with a full party.<br/>
Is this not the case? This dungeon wasn&#39;t even itemized until I was in<br/>
my 30&#39;s so I didn&#39;t get to play there much except for a trip to pick up<br/>
a crystalline blade and a couple of aborted Vox attempts.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; -----<br/>
&gt; To add to the stuff about what to wear, i think that (based on stats) the only<br/>
&gt; Bronze worth wearing are the 3 pieces listed above.  All the other pieces are<br/>
&gt; just 1 point better than Banded (i think) and REALLY HEAVY.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
They do, however, make a big difference, according to what I&#39;ve heard.<br/>
Wasn&#39;t it on this list where someone said they definately knew that<br/>
different armor types provided different protection, independent of the<br/>
AC value? I remember someone saying a Programmer GM had grabbed him or a<br/>
friend in beta and equipped him in various armor to test this.<br/>
<br/>
A few other sources of medium bronze I&#39;ve heard are, Guards in HighPass<br/>
and some mobs in Mistmoore.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, the point still stands that medium bronze is totally<br/>
unattainable by characters off mobs at anywhere close to the level that<br/>
small bronze is.<br/>
