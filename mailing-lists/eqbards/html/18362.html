If you want a location try looking at some of the screen shots and match up<br/>
the landscape.  I don&#39;t know anything about this zone so I can&#39;t help there.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;For anyone that knows what drops where , I have one question I hope you could <br/>
&gt;answer :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been in the zone for days looking for this thing, originally i heard <br/>
&gt;it was a roaming non static spawn , so i just ran around killing some things <br/>
&gt;, and also hoping that other groups hunting there might cause it to spawn. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But , now it seems its static . <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So my questions are ( if you can answer them )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) is it a roamer or a static? , just looking for a confirmation on this one. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) this one I hope you&#39;ll answer hehe. Not looking for a name or  specific <br/>
&gt;location , but in my search ( solo ) , this would help a lot.    There is a <br/>
&gt;kind of zone divider on one side is frogs and mantraps and other such stuff , <br/>
&gt;and then there is that gate , and the spectral / treasure hunter side . could <br/>
&gt;you possibly say which side its on , in either case there is still a ton on <br/>
&gt;either side. but it would really help.  I wanna find this sucker on my own , <br/>
&gt;but its getting old hehe. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you don&#39;t want to answer this on the list you can email me privately at <br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kevikazzam@...">kevikazzam@...</a> <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think it gives away too much , and would be a great help to me <br/>
&gt;In anycase thanks for your time. <br/>
