<b>Subject:</b> Re: Proper way to use Lucid Lullaby <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025773275">There have already been a few really good replies to this, but I just<br/>
want to add and reiterate a few things.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is my most powerful ability at level 23 and has been for<br/>
the past few levels.  This song is also a death-trap for us if we have<br/>
uninformed or uncooperative party members.  Don&#39;t assume anything about<br/>
new party members.  Tell them how the song works and make sure they<br/>
understand the /assist command (telling them to assist someone is not<br/>
sufficient--if they don&#39;t know about the command).  Also make sure any<br/>
spellcasters in your party that have Damage Over Time spells do NOT cast<br/>
them on the mobs that you are singing lullaby to.  This subtlety might<br/>
escape them, and again result in your death or severe beating.<br/>
Everytime their spell pulses the monster will wake up, and my experience<br/>
is that it will still be more angry about being put to sleep than it<br/>
will about the damage from the spell.<br/>

&gt; someone could detail a play by play on how it might be best used<br/>
&gt; against 3 or 4 creatures my group and myself might encounter.  I<br/>
&gt; honestly haven&#39;t seen much effect when I have tried to use it....ok<br/>
&gt; things nod but that doesn&#39;t seem to have any other effect.  Also it is<br/>
&gt; an area effect right, so do I target a creature, myself, what? Thanks<br/>
&gt; for any help y&#39;all can give!!! Ryleth Stormsong </span></blockquote></div>
