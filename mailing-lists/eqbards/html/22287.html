<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068276690">Well, I did my usual ritual last night and pulled out Lullaby and Pixie<br/>
Strike to see what unannounced changes might have occurred.  It was prompted<br/>
after I used Pixie a few nights ago on some irritating casters.  Here is<br/>
what I found (*boggle* at will).<br/>
<br/>
Neither Lullaby or Pixie Strike gave a secondary resist message in over 200<br/>
applications of each.  I tested Lullaby in the usual way versus some lvl 1<br/>
newbie mobs in Misty Thicket this time.  My resists for Lullaby were in the<br/>
range of 35%.  Pixie Strike also showed no secondary resists and the overall<br/>
resist level for Pixie Strike against level 1 mobs was 7%!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now for some analysis.  I figure one of three things has happened<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
1. Secondary resists have been removed and basic resist chance modified to<br/>
compensate.<br/>
<br/>
2. Secondary resists have had their message component removed so it doesn&#39;t<br/>
hit you in <br/>
   the face how high the secondary resist is.<br/>
<br/>
3. Secondary resists are now correctly only occurring on mobs above a<br/>
certain level (originally claimed by GZ directly to be 35th).<br/>
<br/>
From what I observed, the resist rate on Lullaby was too high to simply be a<br/>
case of the secondary resist being removed on mobs under a certain level.<br/>
On the other hand, the resist rate I saw for Pixie Strike showed little<br/>
possibility that the secondary resist could still be there as it was before.<br/>
<br/>
I Pixie Strike&#39;d myself 50 times and never saw a secondary resist message so<br/>
level 32 isn&#39;t the point at which it starts if that&#39;s the issue.  I did<br/>
resist Pixie Strike 50% of the time however with an MR of 42 which seems<br/>
high.<br/>
<br/>
Overall I think I&#39;m leaning towards the possibility that the secondary<br/>
resist is either gone from both and the primary resist rate adjusted<br/>
accordingly, or that the change has already gone in to reduce the secondary<br/>
on Pixie while at the same time removing the secondary message and just<br/>
giving one resist or not based on the two resist chances.<br/>
<br/>
thoughts?<br/>
