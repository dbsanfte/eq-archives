&gt;My Bard, has never ever been given a single item or money!  Not that I do<br/>
&gt;not have friends who offer.  But I always turn it down.  If you twink a<br/>
&gt;character, you are giving them something, but you are also taking something<br/>
&gt;even more valuable away from them.  The wonderfull experience of leveling<br/>

&gt;I have played several characters till early teens, I must say my new bard<br/>

&gt;everyones right to an opinion then things will be fine.<br/>
