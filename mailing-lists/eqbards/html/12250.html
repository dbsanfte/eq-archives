<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856774126">When you train in a non-language skill you should be getting it with a<br/>
number of skill points equal to your level, not the max for your level<br/>
(unless they changed this on us recently). So training at level 18 should<br/>
have started you with a skill of 18 instead of 11. Granted that an extra 7<br/>
skill points is no comparison to 35 but those 7 that you get are more<br/>
important, I think. I have always trained my skills to 21 when I had the<br/>
extra points. The skills seem to take off faster from 20 than they do from<br/>
10.<br/>
	I think the reason we got brass at level 11 is because the current song for<br/>
level 11 isn&#39;t the original. For the life of me I can&#39;t remember what the<br/>
old one back in Beta4 was but I think it might have been a brass song.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

&lt;&lt; I just hit lvl 11 and got my brass skill.  Am I wrong when I look at the<br/>
 song list, or is the first song I can use this for at lvl 18?  Is there<br/>
 anyway to practice it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nope your right. And nope there isnt. When I saw this I didnt train my brass<br/>
skill until I got my 18th song. This gave me a lil boost in the skill as I<br/>
started at 90 instead of 55 skill.  A few less missed notes in the long run<br/>
