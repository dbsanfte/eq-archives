<b>Subject:</b> Twinking (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729238608"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; They&#39;re indistinguishable to you. What business is it of yours? None. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve stated over and over how twinking can negatively impact<br/>
&gt; the gameplay of non-twinkers.  That makes it my business.  If<br/>
&gt; all of a sudden your pay was cut by 25%, but you were unable<br/>
&gt; to determine exactly who was responsible for the decision,<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t you say it&#39;s your business?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your pay has not been cut by 25%. In fact, it could easily be said your<br/>
pay has increased by 25%, since there&#39;s less competition for the same<br/>
items for you. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most everyone agrees the servers are overcrowded.  If 20% of<br/>
&gt; the players are twinked, and they clear out 30% of the mobs in<br/>
&gt; an area because they are more effective, that leaves 70% of<br/>
&gt; the mobs for the other 80% of players.  See the pain?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an issue of overcrowding, not of twinking. Additionally, the<br/>
faster outdoor wandering mobs are killed, the faster they respawn.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; different class/character quickly, with little regard for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the toes they&#39;ll be stepping on on the way.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh yes, look at all those toes I stepped on by not camping for tomahawks..<br/>
&gt; &gt; oh my god. I guess I better go camp those items (with my new char), making<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone wait longer and the game less and less fun for everyone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reread the first line in my message you&#39;re quoting.  I have no<br/>
&gt; problem with giving equipment to other characters when you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; done using it.  All I was saying is that that sort of twinking<br/>
&gt; is indistinguishable from the evil sort, and as such you are<br/>
&gt; going to catch some of the flak aimed at the evil kind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me it sounded not like you&#39;re saying that &quot;I&#39;m gonna catch some flak&quot;.<br/>
It sounded more like you&#39;re saying &quot;I&#39;m evil&quot; and am stepping on the toes<br/>
of others, when truly I am stepping on their toes less than if I hadn&#39;t<br/>
passed down my old equipment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; The alternative is to stop crying and whining over things that are most<br/>
&gt; &gt; likely not hurting you and most likely do more good than harm.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Your choice seems to be to shoot all the innocents just in case there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bad guy in there. What an honorable decision, yes, you shot the bad guys..<br/>
&gt; &gt; nevermind those people who are actually making the situation better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I find it odd that you&#39;re so upset about this.  If you&#39;re one<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, perhaps I overreacted a bit, but your entire message felt like it<br/>
was accusing all twinkers (which to some extent definitely includes me) as<br/>
being &#39;bad guys&#39;. You made very little distinction between people recaming<br/>
for equipment and passing it down. In fact, I repeatedly referred to<br/>
passing down old equipment and you repeatedly berated my actions as<br/>
somehow hurting you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of these innocents, the *only* problem you&#39;ll have which can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be handled by the /ignore command is people withholding help<br/>
&gt; from you.  Why should people be obligated to help you?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who ever said they were obligated to help me? WHO EVER asked for help in<br/>
the first place?! This clearly wasn&#39;t a discussion about whether people<br/>
should be obligated to help me or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I sense a double-standard - twinkers should be free to play the<br/>
&gt; game the way they choose, but other players shouldn&#39;t be free<br/>
&gt; to withhold help from twinkers?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sense an effort to throw up a smoke screen of confusion with words and<br/>
quick changes of topics in the middle of the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Never, not once (by me or anything I quoted) was it suggested that<br/>
people should be obligated to help twinkers. This debate was simply<br/>
whether or not people passing down their old equipment to new characters<br/>
was hurting you (the average other player).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And if it bothers you this much, you can stop it immediately -<br/>
&gt; put away your twinked items until they&#39;re appropriate for your<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What bothers me is your repeated insistance that by NOT making your wait<br/>
in line for an item longer, by NOT camping things with a fixed limited<br/>
rate of appearance, I&#39;m somehow hurting you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if your change of topic was simply a misunderstanding or an<br/>
attempt to quietly back out of a losing argument, but either way it<br/>
doesn&#39;t help to pretend someone was arguing for something they weren&#39;t.<br/>
