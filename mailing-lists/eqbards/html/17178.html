&gt;any one has. Could you please tell me what level they could solo one and<br/>
&gt;what tactics they used. This is my first times playing a bard! Over my<br/>
&gt;shaman the songs are kinda a strange to me!<br/>

Dirk)  it was 50/50 win/flee. I didn&#39;t trust all instrument at the time, in<br/>
retrospect I can see I was wrong :o) Anyway, in my experience don&#39;t assume<br/>
you will have the same success with weapon attack.<br/>
