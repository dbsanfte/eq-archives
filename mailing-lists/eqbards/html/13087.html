<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-582227965">First off ,thanks J.K. for the advice- a couple more questions tho- I know<br/>
the black silk gloves are no drop, but are the gypsy lutes as well?<br/>
Also, how does regular invis work against the mobs-at least the ones outside<br/>
the castle?<br/>
I have been having pretty good luck in acquiring many of the bard items due<br/>
to the generosity and help from others I&#39;ve come in contact with-it always<br/>
pays to be nice to people:)-hoping my luck can hold out in MM and SolA-(my<br/>
next stop for the vambraces and boots). I just HATE dying :)-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
