<div id="ygrps-yiv-231803332">Jaez -  hehe -- this is me - I think you think &quot;silky&quot; was me but she is<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
I admit I am totally twinked!  In fact, I even made a social key.  But it is<br/>
still great fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is the story:  <br/>
<br/>
Late one night, early 4th of July weekend, me and couple of my fiends are in<br/>
Rivervale begging for a bind.  I see Silvera Tinkerbelle who I know from a<br/>
server email list and run over to say &quot;hi I just wanted to meet you!&quot; (She<br/>
is lev 48 or 49 and I am impressed!)  She actually talks to me and I nearly<br/>
faint!  Well, we do some duck dancing and other stoopid char tricks and<br/>
generally hang out.<br/>
<br/>
Then she inspects my equipment and goes: &quot;Greetings Sylly, looks like you<br/>
could use some armor?&quot;  I say: &quot;Well yes, if you know anyone selling banded,<br/>
I do have some plats saved up.&quot; She says come to the bank and lemme look<br/>
what I might have... Then my trade screen come up and she drops in a couple<br/>
of pieces of stuff I don&#39;t even recognize. Then she fills the trade screen<br/>
and says &#39;take&#39; <br/>
<br/>
At that point - I say to her &quot;ya know I am way too low level for this...&quot;<br/>
And she says &quot;I will understand if you say no...&quot;  But I think - hey this is<br/>
the chance of a life time! So I take!<br/>
<br/>
Then she fills the trade screen a second time and I am frantically looking<br/>
to see if I got nuff slots and destroying all my food and beetle eyes. She<br/>
says take.<br/>
<br/>
And that is how the Bronze bard was born (I even told her: &quot;I will have to<br/>
call you Silvera Twinkerbelle from now on&quot; and she goes LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s for penance for my sins or what - one of my &#39;things&#39; is I will<br/>
make free patch work armor for young adventurers.  If they bring me skins,<br/>
fine otherwise ill even buy em and make.  I really enjoy helping the young<br/>
ones get a start.  Patch is the best thing for new adventurers and I try to<br/>
help as many as I can.  Casters - you need to go to Millers by Surefall<br/>
tunnel in Qeynos Hills and get them to make you stuff - casters can wear and<br/>
it has AC.<br/>
<br/>
A long time ago, I saw a guy in all banded running back to the guards at T2.<br/>
I thot that was too ridiculous and posted a rant on some web site about<br/>
twinking.  This was back when I thought you should stand toe to toe with the<br/>
monsters and fight for your honor! Well, now I am the one in all bronze<br/>
running for the zone yelping &quot;trin tran train to the zone@!@<br/>
&lt;mailto:zone@!@&gt; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
More and more are bronze is coming out now and I have made some decent<br/>
levels so my days as a spectacle are nearly over &lt;sigh&gt; I am going to miss<br/>
all the attention! <br/>
<br/>
/ooc you are NOT anonymous on the internet - you are who you are!  What ever<br/>
you do is how people will know you.  I have many friends in char and love<br/>
meeting new people.  I thank you for seeing the real me - I am a bronze<br/>
twink no denying that but I also try to do other stuff and keep things for<br/>
everyone!<br/>

		Be carefull Sylly <br/>
<br/>
		You were, and still Are, running around in full bronze plate<br/>
at way to low<br/>
		a level, but since you are such a nice person, I dont mind. <br/>
<br/>
		That and Ive seen you many times and you havent gone from<br/>
9-30 in 3 weeks. <br/>
		you seem to get enjoyment from the little things and I like<br/>
that....<br/>
