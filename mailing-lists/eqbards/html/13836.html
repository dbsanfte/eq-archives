<div id="ygrps-yiv-305244689"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>
&gt; since about three weeks after release.  It simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>
&gt; could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>
&gt; characters, each on a different server:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve got 65 or so /played days, I hit L50 just before 60 days played.<br/>
  I didn&#39;t rush Harmonic along, and have played a few classes up to L10<br/>
  to see how the feel.  Still, I stick with the bard.  I&#39;ve got a L20<br/>
  druid that I play more and more these days, however.<br/>
<br/>
  I used to hit the PoH every night, but now since Verant has changed<br/>
  the plane, no one even bothers going up there.<br/>
<br/>
  So now the PoH joins the other planes as weekend only events.  Now<br/>
  during the week, I hardly play my bard.<br/>
<br/>
  I work 9am to 6pm ET.  I have a kitten and a girlfriend to feed.<br/>
  /chuckle  I usually play for about 4-5 hours a night.  Eat dinner<br/>
  at the keyboard, horrible dinners at that.  Need to start eating<br/>
  better.  After EQ last night for example, I finished the Hobbitt<br/>
  and started on the Fellowship of the Ring, while my girlfriend<br/>
  was reading Harry Potter.  Weekends, she works all day, so I get<br/>
  to bust my neck sitting at the computer all day.<br/>
<br/>
  Not as hardcore as some people by far, and I still have a little<br/>
  life outside EQ left =)<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
