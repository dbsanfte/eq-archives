<div id="ygrps-yiv-96667968">I have 110 days played on my Bard.  I have a level 32 Warrior with 9.5 days played and a level 20 Shaman<br/>
with 4.  Those were both twinked but not PLed in any way (and I&#39;ve spent some time with both of them<br/>
exploring some of the low-level zones that I missed with my Bard).  You can level things a lot faster<br/>
when:  a) you have good gear, b) you know what you&#39;re doing, c) you don&#39;t do anything but level.  Necros<br/>
are kind of uber, though.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; [The paladin] is lvl 54 now with 128 days played and well over 18<br/>
&gt; months of hard core gaming. Sure he died quite a few times and many of them<br/>
&gt; before anyone even heard of a lvl 49 res, but I spent days with very little<br/>
&gt; exp movement after 45 or so. [The necromancer] on other hand has officially<br/>
&gt; passed [the paladin]up exp wise. Get this in 29 days played, 4 of those<br/>
&gt; camping Pyzin. I think I may have 1 or 2 days in group time, which cutts exp<br/>
&gt; in half at least. That adds up to less than 25 days to go from 1 to 54 for a<br/>
&gt; necro and 128 hard core cant leave your pc days for the pally. How can this<br/>
&gt; be right?<br/>
&gt; *********************<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not just bards that have issues. I will really hate the loss of mezzing<br/>
&gt; and CCing things and see it as a major impact on my ability to contribute to<br/>
&gt; group survival/success.<br/>
