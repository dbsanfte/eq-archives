 </span></blockquote>  Well the hp isn&#39;t in question here.  Clearly, one has an hp bonus<br/>
  and one doesnt.  AC17 on the MithBP and AC20 on the LambentBP is<br/>
  what I&#39;m referring too.<br/>
<br/>
  I think we talked about this before.  Every 10? AGI gives you some<br/>
  sort of AC bonus applied across all your armor?  I don&#39;t remember.<br/>
  But if my 105 AGI drops to 99 AGI, I lose AC for sure.  I&#39;m willing<br/>
  to bet bumping my AGI to 110 will then increase the AC.<br/>
<br/>
  So, does a +15 AGI increase/bump your overall armor up enough to make<br/>
  just +3 AC?  If it does then the MithBP is equally as good as the<br/>
  Lambent one.  (Not to mention the added AGI makes your combat effective-<br/>
  ness increase as well)<br/>
  <br/>
  If I followed all the numbers correctly, I still wouldnt wear the <br/>
  MithBP even if it was better =)  Baby blue is for those wimpy paladins.<br/>
