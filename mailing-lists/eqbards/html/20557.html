<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068391246">yikes!  sure hope you put all those casters on your /ignore /scowl lists.<br/>
What a bunch of jerks, like you are going to be able to get your corpses<br/>
from Dalnir&#39;s where you have to run thru 2nd level to tp out without a bunch<br/>
of deaths.  <br/>
<br/>
course I did have a painful, if funny experience last night.  Had gotten<br/>
killed in Crushbone with my rogue and was running back to my corpse.  I&#39;m<br/>
about 5 seconds from it when I get the group tell.  &quot;Okay time to run,<br/>
everybody zone!&quot; <br/>
I look around and don&#39;t see anyone around my corpse so figure they are<br/>
behind me already.  I head for the corpse only to have my group come around<br/>
the castle and run over me with their train including Dvinn.  At least I<br/>
think it was Dvinn, didn&#39;t live long enough to be sure.<br/>

Last week I joined a pickup group in Dalnirs.  We did<br/>
pretty well in the Temple room so somebody suggested<br/>
we go down to lvl 2.  As we all landed in the pool of<br/>
water, sombody got excited and pulled a nice train<br/>
into the room before we got set up.  THings got bad<br/>
and somebody said gate -- The monk and I were left to<br/>
die.  Funny thing, all four casters in the group had<br/>
to log at that point ... <br/>
7 deaths (6 during corpse recovery) at lvl 30 sure can<br/>
ruin your night. sigh<br/>
