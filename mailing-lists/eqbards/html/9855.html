&gt;Sartori,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I want to believe that you are 100% correct.  However, gonna put on the<br/>
&gt;devil&#39;s advocate hat here for the sake of discussion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First:  There is a big difference between the AC of a caster and the AC of<br/>
&gt;someone wearing platemail, especially if they are the same level.  The only<br/>
&gt;way a caster will have a higher AC over a plate wearing class is if they <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;higher in level and get the benefit of a higher Defense skill rating.  In<br/>
&gt;the observations where you have seen casters getting hit for more damage<br/>
&gt;than plate wearers, were the casters a lot higher in level or similar in<br/>
&gt;level to the plate wearing classes?  If they were a lot higher in level and<br/>
&gt;therefore, in theory, had AC values that were close to one another, then <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;fact that the caster was getting hit for more damage than the platemail<br/>
&gt;wearer could be attributed to the platemail deflecting part of the blow.  <br/>
&gt;If<br/>
&gt;the caster and platemail wearer were similar in levels, I don&#39;t think you<br/>
&gt;can compare the two.  The platemail wearer would almost certainly have had <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;higher AC than the caster and therefore shouldn&#39;t have been hit for as much<br/>
&gt;damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Second, there have been so many patches since beta who&#39;s to say that <br/>
&gt;changes<br/>
&gt;made in beta are still in effect?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I grant that you have a lot more first hand experience than I have (my only<br/>
&gt;character is 26th level) and you may be very well correct.  But like I said<br/>
&gt;earlier, I haven&#39;t seen an analysis posted anywhere, even on this list, <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;had conclusive evidence that armor type can deflect part of the blow.<br/>
&gt;Everything I have read indicates that the only thing that matters is total<br/>
&gt;AC.  If you or anyone else knows where an objective analysis with hard data<br/>
&gt;is posted on this topic I would like to read it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>

commercial), but I still like the armor type theory over just plain old AC. <br/>
I know many monks who&#39;s AC get to be pretty damn high through buffs and just <br/>
from natural Defense skill, along with the armor they wear (higher than my <br/>
AC alot of times and I wear plate), but they are consistently hit for full <br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
And I am talking about relative levels here, people, not a 20th level <br/>
players AC vs a 50th level player&#39;s AC. I hang out with 45-50th level people <br/>
daily and I notice these things. Confirmed? NO. But I don&#39;t care HOW MUCH AC <br/>
you give a mage-type (they can have VERY nice AC with all the high level <br/>
buffs available), I think they will be consistently hit for max damage <br/>
moreso than a melee type.<br/>
