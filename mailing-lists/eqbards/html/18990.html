<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709359716">that&#39;s not bad in a group with everyone higher level than you.  i think<br/>
before the patch it took me about 4 hours to get half a bubble, and the<br/>
other night i got 3/4 bubb in the same time.  but now in 54 it is just<br/>
extremely slow, worse than 51.<br/>

&gt; Sebilis with a full group (granted there were 2 54&#39;s, another <br/>
&gt; who became 54,<br/>
&gt; 1 53, 1 52 and me 51) for 1 bubble of exp. (sigh) </span></blockquote></div>
