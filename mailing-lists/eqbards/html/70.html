<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618642063">Greetings to all from Windsong, elvish bard on Solusek Ro.  I have several <br/>
questions that I&#39;m hoping some more experienced bards may be able to <br/>
answer...<br/>
<br/>
1) I&#39;ve seen a few instrument parts for sale.  Is there a trade skill for <br/>
building instruments?  How is this done?<br/>
<br/>
2) Does it make any difference what instrument you use within a category? <br/>
 I bought a Mandolin rather than a Lute because it weighs less.  I got a <br/>
Minotaur Horn right off the head of one of the filthy beasts, and I&#39;ve been <br/>
using that for a wind instrument rather than buying one.<br/>
<br/>
3) Can anyone tell me what &quot;Enthrall & Nix S.&quot; means?  That&#39;s all the <br/>
description the Strategy Guide gives for the 15th level bard song.  I have <br/>
tried to figure it out in game, and all I&#39;ve succeeded in is getting myself <br/>
killed.  It seems to be an area effect that makes every NPC in the area <br/>
decide to attack me if I&#39;m solo, and I haven&#39;t spotted any effect when <br/>
turning it on in the middle of a big melee. (Does it bother anyone else <br/>
that the game doesn&#39;t provide spell descriptions? It makes me really mad. <br/>
There is no in-character justification for this; the senior-level NPC bards <br/>
who teach the songs should tell you what they do!)<br/>
<br/>
4) Any information on the &quot;stuck song bug&quot; and how to cope with or prevent <br/>
it?  I had only experienced this twice before last night.  Last night we <br/>
killed a named Gnoll and I got a magic axe that casts Berserker Strength, <br/>
and with that equipped I started getting &quot;stuck&quot; songs every couple of <br/>
fights.  (Seems to get stuck when the Berserker Strength spell kicks in <br/>
while I&#39;m switching songs, or something like that.)  The &quot;stuck song bug&quot; <br/>
symptoms are that you aren&#39;t singing (all song buttons are visible) but it <br/>
shows a song icon active and gives messages as if you were singing that <br/>
song. You can click this icon to get rid of it but it comes back again a <br/>
moment later. Any song that you try to sing ends immediately. It&#39;s like <br/>
part of the program thinks you&#39;re still singing the song, but another part <br/>
doesn&#39;t, so you can&#39;t stop. The only ways I&#39;ve found to cure it are to log <br/>
out or zone. It sometimes goes away by itself eventually (might be when I&#39;m <br/>
stunned by a monster, not sure).<br/>
<br/>
5) I haven&#39;t found the level 14 (Identify) or 19 (Invisibility) songs yet. <br/>
I thought they were in High Pass, but we got there last night and found <br/>
only a few songs for sale. (They did have the level 16 water-breathing <br/>
song, which is GREAT.) They aren&#39;t at the Kelethin, Freeport, or Qeynos <br/>
bard guilds, and I haven&#39;t heard of any other city with a bard guild. Has <br/>
anyone found these? (I won&#39;t be level 19 for a while yet, but I&#39;m still <br/>
craving the song.)<br/>
