<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582214445">I was thinking of the KS&#39;ing crowd, though indirectly.  A druid or other<br/>
tracker could just sit by while people wandered about killing stuff and when<br/>
the single named mob showed up race to it and have a fair chance of getting<br/>
there first as the people who cleared the way for it have moved on to other<br/>
areas and are likely in a fight when the special spawns.  If there are<br/>
twelve different specials it would make it that much harder for the &quot;tracker<br/>
in the shadows&quot; to just rush over and nab the special when it popped up as<br/>
likely several specials would be popping up at any given time if the place<br/>
has a fair amount of explorers in it.  Since the container guy doesn&#39;t move,<br/>
but is protected from camping by a respawning dead zone it wouldn&#39;t do much<br/>
good for anyone to go after him until they felt they had several of the<br/>
items.  Plus the container would take up 8 potential spots in their<br/>
inventory if it held only small objects.  Make it weigh 20# and see who<br/>
would want to go grab it before they needed it.<br/>

&gt; Not totally as it would force someone to hunt down 12 randomly placed<br/>
named<br/>
&gt; mobs to get a Ykesha quality item rather than just waiting around until<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; named mob spawned somewhere and then going after that.  Especially since<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; would mean only a ranger or other tracker would be likely to get the<br/>
special<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t see the difference except one of degree.<br/>
<br/>
One named mob, randomly placed drops the Ykesha.  Tracking<br/>
helps, running around killing stuff (to make more stuff<br/>
spawn) helps.<br/>

12 &quot;special&quot; mobs, randomly placed to drop items you need for<br/>
the Ykesha quest.  Tracking helps, running around killing<br/>
stuff (to make more stuff spawn) helps.<br/>
<br/>
Just what do you gain by doing it the latter way that you<br/>
can&#39;t duplicate with tweaks to the former way?<br/>
