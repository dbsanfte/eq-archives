&gt;   Nope, heh.  These little pricks still find it in their heart to attack<br/>
&gt;   me anytime they see me.  You will never be high enough level for these<br/>
&gt;   twerps not to attack, unfortunately.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  I&#39;ve always thought that your faction (how far<br/>
into &quot;ready to attack&quot; you are) affected the aggro radius and<br/>
rate.  I was pulling for a L30s group in Sol A a couple nights<br/>
ago.  The young goblins completely ignored me.  The Inferno<br/>
and Solusek goblins would aggro on me after a few seconds, but<br/>
I was able to pull singles from a room with 3 Sols without<br/>
having to lull.  Fire goblins took about 5 seconds before<br/>
they&#39;d aggro on me.  This was at level 45.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re saying these things all attack you the moment they see<br/>
you?<br/>
