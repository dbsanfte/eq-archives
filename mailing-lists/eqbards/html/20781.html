<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284652635">Perhaps I am just a glutton for punishment, but I thought I would <br/>
share a letter I just posted on ye ole gameplay forum and one I will <br/>
email to those I can at Verant (don&#39;t really expect it to be read <br/>
though).   <br/>

--------------------<br/>
First and foremost I want to say thank you for providing a game that <br/>
has so captured my attention and provided countless hours of fun and <br/>
enjoyment for well over a year (and such a cheap price for soo many <br/>
hours of entertainment).   My first character is a Bard.  I started <br/>
this character on Innoruuk on March 26th, 1999.  I believe I took a <br/>
bit longer than the projected average to level as I just recently <br/>
obtained level 51 after 1 year and 4 months of playing.  I love <br/>
everything about the Bard class.  I think this class is well done, <br/>
fills so many roles, and has so many choices.  It is not an easy <br/>
class to play well and I feel it is under appreciated and perhaps the <br/>
most misunderstood class in the game.  It is great to hear players <br/>
say, &quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t know Bards could do that, I just thought they ran <br/>
fast and played mana song&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
On the flip-side, it is discouraging to read remarks from Abashi that <br/>
say (and I paraphrase) &quot;I don&#39;t really know much about bards, they <br/>
are very mysterious to me&quot; or even worse, to read Geoffrey Zatkin <br/>
plays &quot;A pretty suave Bard&quot;.  Why do I find this discouraging?  It is <br/>
not because I feel bards as a class are unbalanced or that we lack <br/>
certain skills or abilities.  No, it is because there have been so <br/>
many reports of problems with the core of barddom.  Our songs.   <br/>
<br/>
When I first began playing EverQuest, there were several songs <br/>
missing from the Bard&#39;s repertoire.  I did not fret much because I <br/>
felt confident the songs would be implemented well before I achieved <br/>
those levels.  I was pretty much correct.  By the time I had leveled <br/>
to 45, all the missing songs had finally been implemented with the <br/>
exception of the level 49 song.   Overall, I have been happy with the <br/>
song selection.  I have not found any song to be worthless and I have <br/>
used every song up through level 51 at some point or another and in <br/>
useful manners.  Some songs are always on my &quot;play list&quot; and others <br/>
are rarely played, but I do see a use for every song to date.<br/>
<br/>
I never fully understood why bard songs were weaker variants of many <br/>
other classes spells.  I know our songs use no mana and have fast <br/>
refresh times, but the weakness comes from a couple of things.  We <br/>
must continually play the song and most songs only affect group <br/>
members.  It seemed to me that our songs should be more powerful than <br/>
their counterpart spells.   I was thrilled when I finally figured out <br/>
I could &quot;twist&quot; songs and that I could &quot;hotkey&quot; inventory slots to <br/>
make switching instruments and weapons much easier.  I dedicated <br/>
myself to learn as much as I could about being a bard, always putting <br/>
my group&#39;s effectiveness first and trying to learn how to best <br/>
maximize the group as a whole.  I discovered a web site with much <br/>
detailed analysis and information about the songs.  I then found a <br/>
message board where many knowledgeable players congregated and shared <br/>
information, ideas, strategies, and tactics about playing a bard.  I <br/>
delved in and began my growth as a bard and I have loved every moment <br/>
of it.  <br/>
<br/>
So why am I discouraged to hear remarks from Abashi and Geoffrey <br/>
about bards?  It is because several of our songs do not function <br/>
properly.  Some have never functioned properly from the beginning and <br/>
others functioned well but were changed for some reason or another <br/>
and now they do not work.  Many people have tried presenting facts <br/>
and tests which support these conclusions but are always met with &quot;We <br/>
will check it and get back to you&quot; or &quot;Thank you for that <br/>
information, we will place this on a list to have it looked at&quot;.  <br/>
Again and again it seems players of bards are simply left out in the <br/>
cold.  How can we expect to be heard and understood when it seems <br/>
fairly obvious the public relations people, developers and testers <br/>
know little to nothing about the actual class?   Yes, we know-&quot;We <br/>
have several in-house players who play bards&quot;.  Honestly, I can&#39;t <br/>
believe that at all.  These people must be playing on a special <br/>
client or be artificially enhanced or in a controlled environment.  <br/>
They definitely don&#39;t play on a production server with normal groups <br/>
(or they are just a Mana Bard, only playing the one song).  It&#39;s a <br/>
trial in itself educating other players that a Bard brings much more <br/>
to a group other than &quot;Mana Song&quot;, but to have to try to convince <br/>
those who we hope would at least understand the class seems an <br/>
insurmountable task at this point in the EverQuest lifecycle.  This <br/>
is not a goodbye.  I enjoy EverQuest now as much as I have all <br/>
along.  I am still very pleased with the game and the Bard class.  I <br/>
am just expressing some frustration in what I see as an otherwise <br/>
exceptional class.  I will still be playing as much as I have and I <br/>
am looking forward to the newest expansion even though its still <br/>
months away.  Again, I thank you for this wonderful world you have <br/>
provided.  Safe Travels to you!!<br/>
