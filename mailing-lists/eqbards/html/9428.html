<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016762729">i haven&#39;t tried pixie strike in PoF yet.  this message just came through a<br/>
couple weeks old hehe, and since then we have all been seeing how the song<br/>
is broken.  by the time you can get it to stick you&#39;ll be at your bind<br/>
point.  i asked another level 50 bard up there once if he thought we should<br/>
use it, as i read about bards in PoF using it successfully, but as it was so<br/>
tough to get to work we decided not to bother.  so other than pixie strike,<br/>
i use the same songs you do.<br/>
<br/>
i was ecstatic to get back in and complete my set after so many weeks since<br/>
getting my legs and boots.  picked up breastplate, bracer, gloves in the<br/>
first 3 days back.  have it all but one bracer and arms (have mithril<br/>
anyway, imbrued arms are weak hehe and the helm stays in the bank til a<br/>
graphics patch or forever possibly).  it&#39;s fun and a nice change, but after<br/>
those first few days back, it seems more like each trip is wondering if and<br/>
when i will lose my corpse.  when things go bad, and everyone dies and the<br/>
roamers and gate spawn, the groups turn pretty chaotic.  the other day after<br/>
losing to draco (in hindsight don&#39;t try draco a few minutes before the<br/>
gate/roamers spawn) we actually all got back in and got all corpses, only to<br/>
pull way too many mobs and have to all gate out.  would have been ok if not<br/>
for my GGer going LD and myself dying as the others in my group self-gated.<br/>
after sitting around on our asses for 2 or 3 hours after everyone died and<br/>
not being able to break back in (nor trying much for that matter), i<br/>
basically got to the &quot;f**k it&quot; stage of worrying about my corpse and went in<br/>
alone, dragged my corpse to the SW ledge, and waited for a GGer to come get<br/>
me.  on 2 occassions someone trained something to me.<br/>
<br/>
however this WAS one of the coolest things ever... we all know everything in<br/>
there sees invis, though camo/invis does lower the aggro range.  well<br/>
sitting up on the ledge, playing invis song next to a feigned monk, a druid<br/>
trained a scareling to the ledge trying for his corpse.  after he was killed<br/>
right next to me, the scareling sat there for a good minute and stared<br/>
straight into my eyes.  i have never been so frozen in the game.  the monk<br/>
was laughing his ass off and in awe at the same time.  i didn&#39;t even want to<br/>
speak, in case the scareling could hear my text hehehe.  after the face-off<br/>
he slowly flew away, and i could breathe again.  this scareling was no more<br/>
than a foot away, well within melee range, but did not see me.  well a<br/>
second person trained me and this time 2 scarelings did take me out, just<br/>
after my GGer arrived and was going to invite me.  well i went back with a<br/>
GGer, both invis and sow&#39;d, looted, reinvis during, GG out.  not hard when<br/>
done right and not trained.  still the 2nd time in a week with a 5 to 6 hour<br/>
corpse recovery for me.  that 8 hour limit is just getting too close for my<br/>
taste.  and we have to all go through it again for PoH hehe =)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you other bards do in the PoF? Would be curious to <br/>
&gt; hear what all<br/>
&gt; the other strategies are. <br/>
&gt; Oh yeah, i am also the primary puller alot of the time too <br/>
&gt; heh, with the<br/>
&gt; enchanter buff and just one magic resistance song playing i never die,<br/>
&gt; simply resist everything that kills our tanks like fear, <br/>
&gt; stone breath, etc.<br/>
&gt; Well actually i did die once today with all that running a <br/>
&gt; worry wraith<br/>
&gt; dispelled my sow and i dropped like a rock. Didnt have near <br/>
&gt; enough time of<br/>
&gt; course to start up selos. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Egads i am tired, did two spawns today of the pof (12 hour spawn). No<br/>
&gt; cazic, bastard wont spawn for us =(<br/>
