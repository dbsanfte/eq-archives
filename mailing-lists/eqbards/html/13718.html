&gt;Subject: RE: PoA bard quests plus a rant<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m now level 40, my wife&#39;s wood elf warrior is 38 going on 39 and my<br/>
&gt;brother&#39;s druid is 37.  Until now, we&#39;ve had no problems finding places to<br/>
&gt;hunt.  Sol A kings room, Lower Guk BR, MM, CT, Perma, etc.  When one is<br/>
&gt;camped we would simply go to another.  We haven&#39;t had problems finding a<br/>
&gt;spot since we&#39;ve graduated from aviaks at 23.  Now that I&#39;ve hit 40 and the<br/>
&gt;non-green spots in each of these are camped, we have to go elsewhere to get<br/>
<br/>
&gt;xp.  My brother is a druid, so he pulls out the spell book and we go off and<br/>
&gt;flying looking for places to hunt.  Zone into sol b and everything is camped<br/>
&gt;but the circle room.   That sucked with a whole 4 miserable spawns every 25<br/>
&gt;or so minutes ASSUMING that someone from noble or pool didn&#39;t pull one of<br/>
&gt;our precious few spawns first.  Zone into lower guk and everything is camped<br/>
&gt;including the live side bridge.  Zone into Ogguk to find two groups already<br/>
&gt;sharing bouncers, one with a waiting list and the other made up of two high<br/>
&gt;40&#39;s not interested in more, spectres taken, dw gobs in oasis camped, giants<br/>
&gt;boring, Kithicor is nap time in the day and horrible xp at night, troll<br/>
&gt;guards camped and boring... Paw was even crowded and we don&#39;t know the zone<br/>
&gt;well enough to find those places where a level 40 can hunt without pulling<br/>
&gt;trains from hell and half the place cons green.  Worst part is that a huge<br/>
&gt;portion of the populous in most of these areas were level 45 to 50 trying to<br/>
&gt;farm items or fill the xp bar for the next plane raid.  If the PoF, PoH, and<br/>
&gt;PoS are supposed to help eliviate the high level dungeon over crowding, then<br/>
&gt;they have not accomplished their goal.  Not being a college student and<br/>
&gt;having 2 kids, I don&#39;t have the option of getting on at 2 in the afternoon<br/>
&gt;and squawting a spot until my group logs on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just Imagine.... A Global solution to most major problems with Everquest =P<br/>
<br/>
What if, just what if Verant in there ultimate wisdom (heh)decided to throw<br/>
a hardcap on all Servers of say 1500 peeps. Now this would most likely<br/>
require an initial investment on Verant&#39;s part for new servers to<br/>
accomodate the surplus of people that were left over, but, a hardcap solves<br/>
everyone&#39;s problems (well most) I think.<br/>
<br/>
Camping becomes a non-issue due to the fact that people who want experience<br/>
would easily be able to find a new place to hunt that would yeild good<br/>
exp.It&#39;s safe to say that not everybody will be on at once. <br/>
<br/>
Lag becomes a non-issue as well due to the reduction in the amount of peeps<br/>
on at any one time. <br/>
<br/>
Link Dead&#39;s should be minimized for the above reason. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are other things that would be alleviated with this kind of<br/>
change, and the only thing I can think of that would detract from something<br/>
like this is if peeps wanted to bring in friends on their server. However,<br/>
this could be accomodated by allowing a character transfer of some sort<br/>
once a month to a server that wasn&#39;t at full capacity. Then the friends<br/>
could cooridinate what server to transfer to. It seems at least as far as<br/>
this last part is concerned, they are heading in the general direction. I<br/>
just don&#39;t see anything getting better by simply adding more servers. The<br/>
population is just going to max out (and then some) and the same problems<br/>
will come up again. <br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that regardless of what Verant says, there is no cap.<br/>
Initially it was 1500, then a few months ago it became 2000, and now who<br/>
really knows, I guess Fennin Ro was up over 3000 this weekend. There is no<br/>
cap at all. The game is great, but it could be that much better and IMHO<br/>
many of these problems would be taken care of with a hard cap on all<br/>
servers or better yet, hehe, how about just some servers if Verant is<br/>
worried about spending more money for all the servers I am proposing, how<br/>
about servers with a hard cap but with an increased monthly fee. I know I<br/>
would pay much more money a month to play Everquest on server with a cap.<br/>
Would you? <br/>
