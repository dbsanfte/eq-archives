<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-187501716">I agree Steve.  I am angry that they wiped so fast and with so little<br/>
notice.  I am not angry that they wiped.  Just that we got little to no<br/>
warning.  I found out this morning when I tried to log in to play on test<br/>
for a change.  It&#39;s never been my primary server (ok it was while I was<br/>
powerlevelling myself to 50 there) so it&#39;s no big deal.  But it was my only<br/>
50 char :(  My character on Saryrn is only 44 as of now.  It was nice to be<br/>
able to say I had a 50.  Guess I just gotta work that much harder to get<br/>
another ;)<br/>
<br/>
Am I going back?  Hell no.  I lost all my gear more times than I care to<br/>
remember to corpses getting stuck in walls, in geography in gates, whatever.<br/>
Then to get wiped with no notice because Verant f&#39;d up?  Nah, thanks I&#39;ll<br/>
stick to a live server.  At least they back those up regularly.<br/>

&gt; Well, I hate to sound like a hard ass but, it has always been said since<br/>
&gt; day one that test is not a live server and be aware that your toon could<br/>
&gt; always be wiped.  Anyone playing on there agreed to that.  People are<br/>
&gt; supposed to be there to test the new patches, zones, items . . . what<br/>
ever.<br/>
&gt;  Not to &quot;play&quot; like people on the live servers do.  Anyone on test should<br/>
&gt; have seen that it would one day come down to a p-wipe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;In case some of you don&#39;t know, the entire player-base on the Test server<br/>
&gt; &gt;was wiped yesterday.  Verant&#39;s reason being they wanted a clean slate to<br/>
&gt; &gt;conduct ongoing tests.  Fair enough, I suppose - we wipe our test<br/>
database<br/>
&gt; &gt;from time to time to clear out all the junk that accumulates - but for<br/>
those<br/>
&gt; &gt;that had characters there, my condolences.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I can only imagine what it must feel like to have built up a character<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; &gt;the last year to have it wiped, and with little or no warning from what<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;heard.<br/>
