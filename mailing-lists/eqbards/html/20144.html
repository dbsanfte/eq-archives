 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure we are third rate at everything, but things like the lullaby<br/>
nerf are distressing.  I&#39;ve gotten left out of two groups in the last week<br/>
because they &quot;needed&quot; an enchanter for crowd control.  They were both 4 tank<br/>
groups so clarity wasn&#39;t really an issue.  They said, and I believe them,<br/>
that if my crowd control songs weren&#39;t broken they would have rather had me<br/>
in the group since I could help them out with downtime (they had no healers<br/>
other than a ranger).<br/>
<br/>
I play a bard primarily for RP reasons, but I think the bard class is a good<br/>
one.  If they would fix our broken or useless songs we would be fine.  Most<br/>
of the weakness I perceive in the bard class is not because of Verant&#39;s<br/>
vision of a bard.  It is mostly because Verant has made melee classes so<br/>
much less common than casting ones through some of their decisions.  EQ is<br/>
definitely a caster&#39;s game powerwise.  Melee characters might get all the<br/>
neat toys, but caster&#39;s get all the things that make playing easier.  If I<br/>
played with less casual players maybe it wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue.<br/>
Every time I get in a melee heavy group we have a great time and I can<br/>
contribut enormously.  In a caster heavy group all the weaknesses of the<br/>
bard class come to the forefront, and if there&#39;s an enchanter present I feel<br/>
pretty useless.  Unfortunately caster heavy groups seem to outnumber tank<br/>
heavy ones by about 5-1 at least.<br/>
