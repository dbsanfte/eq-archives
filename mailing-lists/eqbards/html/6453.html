&gt; Well when you have a very good chanch of losing all your hard earned<br/>
&gt; equipment then you probably will be afraid to go there. Especially for items<br/>
&gt; that may have took forever for you to camp like jboots.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a sneaky way to avoid this that people have used. just duel<br/>
someone and leave your no drop items on your corpse after getting res&#39;d<br/>
before going to fear. Doesn&#39;t matter much with the current fear nerfs<br/>
but will probably be a good idea for testing out their upcoming &quot;fixes&quot;.<br/>
