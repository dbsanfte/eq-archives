<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086128411"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ok I looked at them again.  Maybe they aren&#39;t froglocks, but why are the red<br/>
&gt; guys pictured with big kobold ears at first, and then later like red<br/>
&gt; goblins?  Too weird.  Might have to go check it out myself someday, but<br/>
&gt; since invis doesn&#39;t work in Sol b it&#39;ll be a while.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  If you like I&#39;ll post pictures of a greater kobold, a fire giant,<br/>
  a undead froglok, a froglok, a fire goblin, and an ice goblin.<br/>
<br/>
  Pictures of Vox and Nagafen I have were taking by someone else.<br/>
  Probably someone using bind sight or a guide snapping off picts.<br/>
<br/>
  Hmm... maybe I can sneak in and get some picts of vox with bind <br/>
  sight... after all you can target her from the king room heheh.<br/>
<br/>
