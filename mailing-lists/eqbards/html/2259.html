<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181964215">You wouldn&#39;t believe what some people think of Bards.  I was in Lesser Fay<br/>
last nite hunting for Crookstinger last nite, blast his elusive hide, when<br/>
all of a sudden a passing cleric started healing me.  I thanked him and told<br/>
him he could save his mana as I was able to play a healing song that kept me<br/>
in good shape.  He sais he had no idea bards could heal themselves???<br/>
Anyways we ended up teaming up for a bit of bandit bashing while we waited<br/>
for Crookstinger to show his ugly mug.  He finally did, but still no dagger.<br/>
the cleric told me it was real nice not to have to blow all his mana after<br/>
one lousy bandit cause he knew I could heal him of 100 pts before the next<br/>
one showed up.  I didnt have the heart to tell him that was without my<br/>
mandolin.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have another name from the depths of Lesser Fay to add to my book of<br/>
grudges.  Some brownie named Bracken Underbrush, a high level druid,<br/>
ambushed me as I headed back from the wood elf outpost to Greater Faydark.<br/>
With SOW he was able to stay in range for some stunning spells and a lot of<br/>
stings and blasts.  Ouch, where the heck did this guy come from anyway?<br/>
Have the brownies taken to wandering at the bandits behest?  He assaulted me<br/>
again on that hallowed hill but I was able to pop up a drum and race to the<br/>
zone.  He totally ignored the other 3 on the hill despite them being lower<br/>
level and my never having killed a single brownie, faerie, pixie, or other<br/>
diminutive humanoid.  Some day Bracken, some day...<br/>
