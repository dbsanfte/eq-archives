<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028567310">On the topic of strange bugs, here is an amusing one:<br/>
<br/>
If you are familiar with the Unrest Zone, you are aware of how you run down<br/>
the twisty tunnel between Cauldron and Unrest and the zone point is in the<br/>
tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
I was standing just around the second turn in the tunnel in Unrest having<br/>
just zoned in and heading for the courtyard when someone yelled &quot;train to<br/>
zone!&quot; so I stopped and waited.  Around the next corner came 2 tentacle<br/>
terrors and one of them ran straight at me, hit me with that special attack<br/>
they have and threw me against the wall toward the direction I had come<br/>
from.  The I regained my bearings and it hit me again, threw me down the<br/>
tunnel against another wall and came charging at me for another go.<br/>
<br/>
I decide now is a good time to turn tail and run, zone to safety and wait<br/>
out the chaos - so I turn the next corner and there is a dead end...no<br/>
zone...a flat wall in front of me!  I get smacked by the tentacles again,<br/>
and again up against the wall and realize in a split second that they<br/>
knocked me PAST the zone point so I had to turn around and head the opposite<br/>
direction back INTO unrest and as I rounded the corner I zoned into Cauldron<br/>
with 2 bubbles of health.<br/>
<br/>
Crazy place...awful fun though ;-)<br/>
