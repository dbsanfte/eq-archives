<div id="ygrps-yiv-210254893">Wow, I guess we haven&#39;t been ambitious enough.<br/>
<br/>
We had no problem with the maid / butler (4 spawns), hall (3 spawns),<br/>
kitchen (3 spawns) and the 2 close gargoyles. When we tried to pull the 2<br/>
far gargoyles, the buggy pathing would bite us in the ass and the negotiator<br/>
room would come to investigate what all the ruckus was. (leading to a prompt<br/>
evac)<br/>
<br/>
Would you have any tips on the harmoing of the gargs / negotiator / ball<br/>
room ? We tried to break the ball room a couple of times, but to no avail.<br/>
We all lined up in the south east corner of the room while invis, we let<br/>
invis drop which would pull the 2 mobs at the doors. Problem was about<br/>
halfway through the fight the gypsys would agro and jump on board. After 4<br/>
attempts we called it a night.<br/>
<br/>
Since that time I was lucky enough to catch Mynthi sitting at the zone all<br/>
alone. (I soloed her to earn my drums) And a pair of level 50s camping the<br/>
ball room let our warrior loot a talon so he got his BP. That sort of<br/>
eliminated our need to go to the ball room so we haven&#39;t returned. (Although<br/>
I would love to pick up a second lute so I have a NO DROP one for switching)<br/>

You need to get a druid/ranger in your group to summon up the<br/>
courage to harmony, or get a high level person to pull for<br/>
you.  When my friends and I were at the maid/butler, we pulled<br/>
those two rooms, the 3 hall mobs, the 3 in the kitchen, the 4<br/>
gargoyles around the corner, the music room mobs (8 of them),<br/>
and the negotiator room mobs (7? mobs).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my question to all of you more experienced bards: What level can I<br/>
&gt; expect to have a reasonable shot at soloing the maid butler area? I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; quite content to just do the maid and butler room, and leave the hall and<br/>
&gt; kitchen alone.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t tried soloing there.  Maybe I should.<br/>
