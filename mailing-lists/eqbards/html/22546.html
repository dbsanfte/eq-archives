<div id="ygrps-yiv-605522761">The cleric I hunt with all the time couldnt believe it when i showed<br/>
him my melee speed and damage with Provocation, Nivs and Absonant Binding.<br/>
I got a message from him a while ago that he was working a trade for an FBSS<br/>
for me already :)  The effect is so pronounced someone watching you fight<br/>
can very easily see the difference.<br/>
<br/>
	Basically there are times in a caster heavy group with no main tank<br/>
that we NEED to take that role for taunt and interrupt purposes.  This song<br/>
lets us do that much better than previously.<br/>

&gt; My only thought now is that I need to get a FBSS, hangman&#39;s noose or<br/>
&gt; something, as I finally have a NEED for a haste item!  <br/>
