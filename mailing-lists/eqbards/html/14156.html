&gt; Ugh! I&#39;m one of those people who find this stuff to be annoying. I mean, if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re doing it on /say or /group that&#39;s fine, but IMO (nothing humble about<br/>
&gt; it) it is obnoxious to broadcast this stuff and revel in the complaints.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But in your favor, at least you&#39;re doing it on ooc where I can turn this<br/>
&gt; off. :-P I really hate when people do this stuff on shout, which is<br/>
&gt; necessary for train updates. *Windleaf ducks the pie thrown by Papa*<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No pie coming, I agree with you (essentially).  Spamming shouts annoy me<br/>
as they are supposed to be in chracter and should be used for important<br/>
stuff (like trains).  It seems the point would be to do whatever you<br/>
want with (within reason).  Perhaps singing &quot;Come sail away&quot; is a bit<br/>
too far, but I dont see it as any difference than talking about Super<br/>
Bowl or your plans tonight.  Then again perhaps the reason I had such an<br/>
awful day was all the bad karma generated when I was singing...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve gone through this type of depression before. But once I got DDD at<br/>
&gt; level 18, I switched to all instruments for soloing and had an absolute<br/>
&gt; blast. Also, for me, nothing gets me back into the game like shopping.<br/>
&gt; Getting a new weapon or piece of armor always gets me going, and once you<br/>
&gt; hit level 20, you can start hunting gargoyles on Spectre island in OOT with<br/>
&gt; a partner. At level 23 you can start soloing them with your all instrument<br/>
&gt; attack and earn enough money to seriously upgrade your weaps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunatly I am pretty ppor right now (20P maybe), however my druid<br/>
friend said he has a new whip for me (from Paw).  Any one know if its<br/>
any good?  I think he&#39;s just trying to bribe me into playing some<br/>
more...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well until Diablo II makes it to the shelves, &quot;See you around&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been waiting for this for a few years and will be shocked when Blizzard<br/>
&gt; finally does release this. It&#39;s gotten to the point where I&#39;m pretty<br/>
&gt; non-chalant about it. I was real excited for this to be released early last<br/>
&gt; year. Let&#39;s see if they do indeed release it as expected.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll cut Blizzard some slack.  They have been REALLY good about making<br/>
their release dates in the past. And they&#39;re games are always released<br/>
in a nearly final version (as opposed to most companies, who release<br/>
games that I shudder to call Beta).  One big blown release date (they<br/>
are going to be min of 9 months late on this one) is very forgivable if<br/>
the game is fairly clean when released.  I have no idea what they were<br/>
thinking when they made that original release date, I always follow the<br/>
progress of games I am eager to play and I (knowing nothing other than<br/>
public info) could see they weren&#39;t going to come close to making it.<br/>
<br/>
In any case I bought the complete Myth cd&#39;s for $19 yeseterday, so I<br/>
have something to pull me away from EQ.  Hopefully I will be in a<br/>
barding mood again soon.  I was really hurt to lose that cool lvl 18<br/>
song, that was what really &quot;killed&quot; me.  (And that 4/6 deaths were bugs,<br/>
I dont mind dying when I&#39;m adventuring)<br/>
