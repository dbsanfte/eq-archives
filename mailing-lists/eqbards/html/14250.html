&gt; Just a point but the actual claim was that Verant are liars when they<br/>

with bard bugs have been due to secondary interations with<br/>
spells.  So they could quite easily be testing what they think<br/>
a change might break, while missing some unanticipated<br/>
interaction.  (The levitate bug was simply unforgivable<br/>
though.)<br/>

&gt; (emergency) patch they said they had to put in some changes half<br/>

&gt; pet changes. Don&#39;t any of the programmers on the list find it odd that<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t appear to have some kind of source control system that would<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re proposing they bring down the servers again to repatch.  <br/>
They may have decided that disruption was not worth the<br/>
benefit of temporarily removing a nerf to one of the strongest<br/>
classes in the game.  OTOH, when the bard proc bug showed up<br/>
again, they did an emergency patch two days later.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in large software projects, you tend to go with tested<br/>
executables rather than pieces.  The executable they tested<br/>
had the necro pet nerf in it.  Rolling back just that one<br/>
piece of code may have caused unanticipated and untested<br/>
problems in other sections of the code.<br/>
