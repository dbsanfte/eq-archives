<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494395139">How on earth did they let a bard have a runed bolster belt? =)<br/>
Seriously, being the weakest of the melee classes what sort of dragon<br/>
loot system is used that allowed you to be have such an item. Also does<br/>
it make you ineligible for Selo&#39;s drum and Horn of War?<br/>
A few improvements in your equipment I might add if you dont mind which<br/>
you&#39;re probably already aware of.<br/>
Wear Imbrued gloves (assuming you have them), the lambent ones are just<br/>
awful looking. If you&#39;re ever able to get a Tranix crown, wear that over<br/>
Imbrued (assuming you dont have one). Imbrued helm also looks awful =).<br/>
Crested spaulders -better ac and hp, dex useless since your weapons dont<br/>
proc. Hooded black cloak if you&#39;re lucky enough to obtain one - the 45<br/>
hp outweighs the extra 2 ac on cloak of shadows in my opinion.<br/>
Diamondine earrings - 122 charisma is plenty so you can afford to lose<br/>
the opallines, especially if you choose Tranix over Imbrued.<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to figure out why your dex is so high. Imbrued BP (13),<br/>
bracer (3), Gloves (5), Belt (10), Pauldrons (7 or 9?), Cloak (5). Also<br/>
how much hp does the bolster belt give you? I&#39;m assuming roughly 30 hp.<br/>
Please let me know.<br/>
