<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316584536">I think you are close to time to go to unrest where<br/>
the Opaline earrings drop (+5 cha) they can usually be<br/>
bought for 15pp in unrest on bristlebane. To fight<br/>
them and successfully loot them yourself you want a<br/>
around 25th lvl group.  Im also wearing a split tooth<br/>
gnoll necklace which is +5 to cha, it was a gift from<br/>
a friend. I think you could get it around lvl 28 or<br/>
so.  It is from Paw. <br/>
<br/>
The rest of my pluses come from jewelry. Find your<br/>
self an enchanter who will make stuff out of the gems<br/>
you find  (Im lucky that my RL husbands &#39;chanter has<br/>
jewelry 160 skill...)<br/>
<br/>
And finally while you are in unrest be sure and ask<br/>
[often] to loot the bracelet from a greater dark boned<br/>
skeleton.  This is for your lambent bracers, and the<br/>
bracers are a plus to str... which is very good for me<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m new to the list and running a 13th lvl half elf<br/>
&gt; bard.   I&#39;m camping Dervs in W.C. right now but want<br/>
&gt; to start hunting for dex and charisma items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What mobs can I hunt that will drop this stuff?  I<br/>
&gt; realize I&#39;m not going to be picking up platinum ruby<br/>
&gt; veils at this point...just need some places to<br/>
&gt; start.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
