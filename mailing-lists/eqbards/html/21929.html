<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129528220">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad they fixed the tamborine, I guess my point was they could fix one<br/>
stick in a couple of months but it&#39;s taking over 2 years to fix the first<br/>
stick and they still make excuses? That ends to defy all logic to me. They<br/>
just seem to be hugely choosy about their priorities, not to preach to the<br/>
choir here. Let&#39;s start a trust fund to send them to Effective Management<br/>
training! Talk about 7 Habits of Highly Defective People, Dr. Covey would<br/>
have his hands full.<br/>
<br/>
/em waves at Slyde. I hadn&#39;t seen you much either, but I only get playtime<br/>
on the weekends these days it seems and sometimes play my wizard. You did<br/>
drag my mage and shaman out the BW to kill that cleric quest guy last<br/>
weekend, Altoidus and Chubb. We were trying to talk them into joining us in<br/>
Sebilis. Gratz on the armor! I&#39;ve been trying to trade for the gloves but<br/>
haven&#39;t had the right deal yet.<br/>
<br/>
I think the helm art alone proves Verant has no fashion sense, let alone the<br/>
silly animations.<br/>
