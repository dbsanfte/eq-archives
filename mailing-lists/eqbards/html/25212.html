<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279461582">As far as weaps vs insts - your weapons do make a difference (heh plus<br/>
haste) that is - what weapons you have.  Also - when I&#39;m in a group without<br/>
either an enchanter or a shaman (but WITH a snarer was very common when I<br/>
was in a small guild without either) - and I&#39;m doing hastes and slows -<br/>
those are both singing songs - so I&#39;d use weaps regardless.  Point being -<br/>
even if you do prefer insts over weaps - there are situations where you&#39;ll<br/>
be tanking and the better weaps you have in those situations you&#39;ll be in.<br/>
<br/>
As far as upgrading instruments; well I&#39;ve found that 90 pct of the time I&#39;m<br/>
using Drums and Lute.  At your level you are better off trying to camp your<br/>
upgrades (7-String Lute in Hate and Naggy Drum - get your red scale before<br/>
you hit 53).  The Lute is No Drop - so you can&#39;t trade for one if you<br/>
want...<br/>
<br/>
So again - as I said in my prior note - camp the Velious Armor, camp the<br/>
instrument upgrade, buy weapon upgrades.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks a lot for the advice.. I asked mainly because I am unsure if keeping<br/>
the haste gloves are the most bang for the bucks considering the other gear<br/>
I have.. Furthermore I often feel that my damage output with weapons really<br/>
cant stack up with what I add to a group with my instruments. So improving<br/>
my own haste have never been _that_ important to me. Am I way off on the<br/>
feeling that improving haste isent a main issue for us bards?<br/>
<br/>
Things I considered trying to trade these gloves for are:<br/>
- Better weapons<br/>
- Better armor (singing steel BP *grin yeah right*)<br/>
- Better instruments??<br/>
<br/>
Well Im still in doubt what will be the most bang for my bucks *shrug* Its<br/>
the first time I have had an item this valuable...<br/>

&gt; allakhazam lists this item at 18K.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe 10K is more realistic.  Here&#39;s why:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FBSS is only haste and goes for 8K (average price)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This item has AC and +3 to **ALL** resists.  The<br/>
&gt; resists make it a great item for dragon raids.<br/>
&gt; (And for that reason you might want to just keep this<br/>
&gt; item...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The item is rare at the moment and that may<br/>
&gt; artifically increase the price.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is haste broken?  I would make a point of testing<br/>
&gt; that.  ALSO, a guy on this list posted last year that<br/>
&gt; any haste item, regardless of percentages and a bard<br/>
&gt; speedup song resulted in a 75% speed increase.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His name was John Kim and he backed this up with<br/>
&gt; posted statistics.  You may want to check the archives<br/>
&gt; for that information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my thought:  even if haste doesn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; normally, does it make the jump to 75% with bard haste<br/>
&gt; song?  I would test this to be sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best of luck and good hunting to you,<br/>
