&gt; ... My name is Bruen Bladesong a bard of the 21st song on Erollisi Marr.<br/>
&gt; ... Basically the problem is that I keep getting killed<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ... Where am I going wrong? Or is bard hate really this bad? If it is that bad<br/>
&gt; then how do you all manage?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Looking back at it from the ripe old age of 35 songs, I have to say that 20-24 was the pits for Bard<br/>
hate.  I suspect that the relative taunt values of our lower level songs are highest at this point.  I got<br/>
killed in Cazic 8 times in two consecutive evenings.  And I was bound in High Keep, so most of my time was<br/>
taken up in travelling.  I got killed in whatever-the-heck-Karana is next to High Keep four times in the<br/>
last bubble of 21.  I got killed... oh, never mind.  There was just about nothing I could have done about<br/>
it except stop singing altogether (and even that didn&#39;t stop the two Ice Giants, eh, Harmonic?), and that<br/>
seemed pretty pointless.  So I did the cop-out approach:  I went to High Keep.  You can also probably<br/>
group/solo the crocs/caimans in Oasis.  I did that on and off over a couple of levels.  Just remember:<br/>
this will pass, my son.  ;)  (My roommate is standing looking over my shoulder saying &quot;I remember what it<br/>
was like back then - you were SO MAD!&quot;  hehe)<br/>
