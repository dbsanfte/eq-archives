<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-49308755">FYI.  Just read the following on the E&#39;ci board at EQVault.  The poster got<br/>
it off a monk website.<br/>
<br/>
Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
<br/>
There was just a post on the monk board where someone used the log programs<br/>
to test combat against 10 DW Caimans with 93 AGI and again with 107 AGI.<br/>
While most of the numbers were within general tolerances, average Dodges per<br/>
fight went from 0.4 to 1.0, and average Blocks per fight went from 1.4 to<br/>
2.4. Also, the mob&#39;s hit/miss ratio dropped from 48% to 44%, which is not<br/>
surprising.<br/>
So I&#39;m taking this as evidence that there IS an AGI boost to Dodge and Block<br/>
(at least for monks, but probably for everyone), and likely for Parry as<br/>
well. If anyone&#39;s skeptical, well, you can type /log as well as any of us..</div>
