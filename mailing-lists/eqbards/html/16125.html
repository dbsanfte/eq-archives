<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326906650">Well, taking the good advice from this list (defined as any post that isn&#39;t<br/>
one of mine involving the specifics of game mechanics) I headed off to find<br/>
the Hermit.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is in one morning I made a bubble and 25 pp, using the ol&#39;<br/>
DDD, CoD, Binding and Hymn. when I could pull him before he cast thorns on<br/>
himself I would add fisticuffs, but all instrument attack with no auto<br/>
attack was just fine.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news was, not able to sleep I logged in at 5AM and *just* beat out<br/>
someone else to camp him, criminy he is seriously camped, though this being<br/>
spring break it might be worse than normal. The second startling news is<br/>
that a Tesch Val Gnoll (I think that was it, it was level 26) now<br/>
occasionally spawns right outside the wall of the camping spot. I lucked out<br/>
both times it spawned, I am not sure if it is random or once per hour,<br/>
anyway something to watch out for.<br/>
