<br/>
Sorry you caught us during a brief (hopefully) interlude where instead of<br/>
playing bards we prefer to play lawyers and speculate about legalities &lt;g&gt;<br/>
but now back to the non-stop barding...<br/>
<br/>
MM is tough.  The castle is tough - especially.  The agro ranges and pathing<br/>
of the mobs is very different from anywhere else you have been.  You can<br/>
agro something and it will &quot;run off&quot; (different pathing - goes away rather<br/>
than directly to you) aggravate many more and then come back with a small<br/>
army and do battle.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes less is better.  A level 50 druid can prolly pull the gypsy(s) you<br/>
need and kill them fairly easily.  Then you could come in invis and loot<br/>
what you need.  That is the easy way.  If you dont have a lev 50 druid at<br/>
your disposal, then a full party of 35 to 40 or two partys of low to upper<br/>
30&#39;s could clear in thru the tower (secret wall by the crypt.  secret doors<br/>
to the stairs going up.  one way to tower - other way (left) goes in to<br/>
bedroom and castle 2nd floor.)  Clearing thru the pit and up the ramp is<br/>
risky.  One runner gets loose and you can pull the castle.  Clearing in thru<br/>
the front door is also risky for same reason.  But this time it does not<br/>
need to be a runner.  Your pull mob may have a path that goes away first and<br/>
it will agro lots before they all return to deal with you.<br/>
<br/>
Or, I guess you could hang out and wait for inevitable trains and try to<br/>
pick off the back end of trains.  Maybe a ranger can watch for gypsys,<br/>
snare, then he zones.  As the train receeds, the snared gypsys are prime for<br/>
you party to pounce on. (Kind of like old Harm&#39;s cheese pull for DW Gobs.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, check the archives here - there are some good MM tactics and advice<br/>
given fairly recently.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted and tell us how you fared,<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Writing again to garner any information you all may have on the ball room<br/>
&gt; (or gypsy room) in MM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most specifically I&#39;d like to find out what level range you suggest is<br/>
&gt; necessary to break and take the room, as well as any tips on breaking and<br/>
&gt; holding the room long enough to pick up a MM drum, and some lutes.<br/>
