<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099935669">From what I&#39;ve heard ALL levitate spells are affected by this.  The latest <br/>
patch made it impossible to cast levitate on someone with levitate <br/>
apparently. That would pretty much mean our song pulse would now check to <br/>
see if we already have levitate, if we do, we can&#39;t cast it again until it <br/>
wears off.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m willing to bet that Aria wasn&#39;t broken as a result of the ADM fix.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d bet that they were trying to change Aria so that it wouldn&#39;t cancel<br/>
&gt;other, non-bard forms of levitation.  i.e. our song won&#39;t take hold on<br/>
&gt;someone already levitating.  It seems they&#39;ve been doing this to a lot of<br/>
&gt;our songs lately (selos, clouding) and I think its a good thing, well,<br/>
&gt;assuming they could get it right that is.<br/>

&gt;I doubt the change to ADM would have affected Aria.  Its possible, but<br/>
&gt;unlikely.  The problem with ADM didn&#39;t involve its playing time, it stills<br/>
&gt;plays like it did before, it just actually does something now while its<br/>
&gt;playing.  And yes, if I changed a subroutine I knew was used by other<br/>
&gt;processes I sure as hell would make sure what I did didn&#39;t break those <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt;processes.  If I didn&#39;t I would soon be looking for a new job.  In fact, <br/>
&gt;now<br/>
&gt;that I think of it, that is my new job.  I spend 80% of my time making sure<br/>
&gt;that exactly that sort of thing does not occur.  Something Verant obviously<br/>
&gt;cannot be bothered to do.  Come on remember those three DoT&#39;s that when<br/>
&gt;implemented would only work if you cast them on yourself, their testing<br/>
&gt;record speaks for itself and it is mute.<br/>

&gt;Actually, I can see why it slipped by.  They were changing ADM, and<br/>
&gt;whoever was working on it was probably not the person who originally<br/>
&gt;coded the spells, and didn&#39;t realize that Aria would be affected by<br/>
&gt;it.  It happens, even to me.  They don&#39;t have time to go back and test<br/>
&gt;*every* aspect of the game for each patch, simply because if they did,<br/>
&gt;the patch would be rather long in getting out.  That bug will likely<br/>
&gt;be fixed in the next patch.<br/>
