<br/>
&gt; try to pick locations where the group can get started on easy <br/>
&gt; creatures and<br/>
&gt; get a feel for things before taking on tougher fights and <br/>
&gt; risking death.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Getting a group to do this has been one of the most difficult things for me<br/>
to do.  I must be presenting myself in a way that makes me sound cowardly.<br/>
But I&#39;m glad to know I&#39;m not the only one who thinks this is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BTW, the idea behind my guild (Imperturbable Fellowship) is <br/>
&gt; to learn the<br/>
&gt; various classes (capabilities and limitations) and grouping <br/>
&gt; strategies that<br/>
&gt; promote teamwork, strong communication and lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too bad we&#39;re on different servers.  I think I&#39;d love that guild.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You were looking for a last name, right?  How do you pronounce the first?<br/>
