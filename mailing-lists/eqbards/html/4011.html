<div id="ygrps-yiv-430390506"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The boats seem to be cut off from the rest of the world.<br/>
&gt;While riding the large boats or a canoe, everything will be<br/>
&gt;indifferent to you.  I once hopped on a canoe to flee a tidal<br/>
&gt;lord train, and the instant I got on, they walked away as if<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d zoned.  I&#39;ve never tried attacking from one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that might have been a recent change. i remember a couple months ago<br/>
taking a canoe from the south karana exit in lake rathe to the rathe<br/>
mountains zone - going past the orc camp, they all jumped in the water and<br/>
started hitting me.<br/>
<br/>
i bet the boat thing is related to how you can jump in the scryer pool in<br/>
guk, or the pool in cazic, and have all the monsters stop attacking you.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Only one man could kill this many russians. Find him, and bring his guitar to me.&quot;<br/>
