aye i heard that too, i think they have 4 machines powerlevelling one<br/>
character hehe.  doesn&#39;t that sound like a lot of fun? *heavy sarcasm*<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m sure we&#39;d all love one of those masks, i haven&#39;t heard where it is from<br/>
yet though other than Trakonon&#39;s Teeth.<br/>

&gt; I read a post on Fires of Heaven noos board that two of them <br/>
&gt; hit 56 and<br/>
&gt; heard rumor that they are being power played 24/7.  They want <br/>
&gt; to be the<br/>
&gt; first to hit 60 and do it a.s.a.p.  And playing 24 hours a <br/>
&gt; day for exp will<br/>
&gt; definitely get you there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; p.s. also saw some equilizer/stratics posts from miriana&#39;s <br/>
&gt; guild on phat<br/>
&gt; l3wt&#39;s they hauled in.  one was the new mask with illusion <br/>
&gt; iskar effect. i<br/>
&gt; think stats were the same as mask of deceiver but the <br/>
&gt; illusion is Iskar.<br/>
&gt; WTG LoD! </span></blockquote></div>
