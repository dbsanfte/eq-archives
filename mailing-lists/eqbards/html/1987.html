&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve seen it advertised from as low as 10pp to 100pp.  The big<br/>
 difference between the dirk and other special weapons is that<br/>
 the mob who carries it spawns often, and has it every time.<br/>
 It is going to cause a serious realignment of prices for<br/>
 weapons in the L15-25 range.  I personally wouldn&#39;t pay more<br/>
 than about 15pp for one, maybe 20pp if I were in Qeynos &gt;&gt;<br/>

     Heh... I was in West Commonlands yesterday and someone was selling the <br/>
dirk.  She wanted me to make the first bid and laughed at 50 plat.  She said <br/>
the lowest she would go would be 120 plat.  In fact, a guildmate said he&#39;s <br/>
seen them go for over 300 plat... I guess I&#39;ll pick one up when I&#39;m in <br/>
Faydwer next time.<br/>
