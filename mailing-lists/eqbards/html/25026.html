<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961082929">I use a PIII 800 with 256 Meg of Ram and  GForce II with 32 meg of video memory.  <br/>
I can do three songs with ease -- barring lag which gets pretty heavy at times in Europe -- even with an adsl connection.  4 songs are managable under really good circumstances with, as some others have mentioned, a bit of drop off at the end...<br/>
on guild raids with six groups fighting in close proximity, twisting more than two songs is tough, but managable.<br/>
SOmebody mentioned that Win98 is a poor memorymanager and I must agree -- Can anybody comment on Win ME doing a better job of this?  If upgrading to ME will help me twist songs better, I&#39;ll do it in a heartbeat.<br/>

Months back I went from 128 meg of PC100 memory to 256 PC100.  I didn&#39;t get<br/>
any noticeable improvement.  I replaced my 300a Celeron (overclocked to<br/>
450) with a P3 700 three weeks ago (fastest chip the mobo will take).<br/>
There was a huge improvement in frame rate.  I can keep my clipping plane<br/>
maxed in burning woods and still have a _nearly_ flicker free run.  I fact<br/>
I did auto-follow through there a few days ago with out a problem.<br/>
However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  If I turn the<br/>
clipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent trade off<br/>
in viewable distance and twisting time.  Right now I feel the TNT card is<br/>
holding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming out later in<br/>
the year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.  To what I don&#39;t<br/>
know yet, depends on the prices and Verant&#39;s recommendations.<br/>
