  If the bard uses lev, you can get your group up to the exit of Kaesora,<br/>
then<br/>
  work your way down.<br/>
<br/>
  My first trip into the dungeon was nasty.  An enchanter friend went down<br/>
the<br/>
  drop in the middle and got slaughtered by at least 5 spiders.  I decided<br/>
to<br/>
  help with CR, and thought I could lev down, any maybe avoid the spiders.<br/>
I<br/>
  was wrong :(<br/>
<br/>
  So a rogue came to help with CR.  We decided to lev him, and then after<br/>
the<br/>
  pulse, he&#39;d go hide/sneak, and I&#39;d turn off song, so he could float down.<br/>
  That didn&#39;t work either.<br/>
<br/>
  Now we&#39;ve got 1 level 40, and 2 level 45 corpses that seem irretreivable.<br/>
  We were all afraid to jump down the pit again, and we realized that with<br/>
  levitate, I could get us up to the exit ramp, and then we worked our way<br/>
  down (with a bigger, higher level group).  If it weren&#39;t for guild help,<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
  convinced my corpse would still be there, rotting away today.<br/>
