<div id="ygrps-yiv-866227215">I don&#39;t believe in requesting any type of pay. I don&#39;t even accept<br/>
donations(personal beliefs), though I have no problem with other people<br/>
asking for donations. Why? Have you ever needed to be bound to a place?<br/>
How much do most spellcasters charge for it, 5gp. Ever spellcaster that<br/>
I&#39;ve met who charges has said they only do it because other mages do,<br/>
and because necros and bards charge for finding corpses. Personally I<br/>
believe if nobody charged everyone would have a lot more money.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ahem..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone else has set a standard for corpse relocations.<br/>
&gt; I usually charge 5 GP minimum for up to level 5, plus 1 GP/2 levels rounded<br/>
&gt; up.  This is standard, plus I usually ask for tips or danger pay.    Does<br/>
&gt; this sound like too little?  Maybe it should be 1 PP/2 levels after level<br/>
&gt; 10?<br/>
