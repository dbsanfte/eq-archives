<b>Subject:</b> plane tactics <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167471809">as lvl 46 is quickly approaching, ive been having a few thoughts about the <br/>
best way to go into the planes.  i know i always see casters duel outside so <br/>
they dont lose their nice items in the planes, so i was thinking that a bard <br/>
should be able to do the same with a bag of instruments and food and drink.  <br/>
ive been doing alot of instrument only fighting in solb, and there are times <br/>
where i think im actually doing more damage/help with my lute and songs, <br/>
than with my weapons.  has anyone tried this tactic?<br/>
