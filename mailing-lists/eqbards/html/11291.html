<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808446684">Yeah, I used to do this too but about a month ago or so it stopped working.<br/>
My charisma is 117 so it&#39;s not like I some poor human with minimum stats<br/>
here.  At level 21 I can sleep the green gnolls on reaver hill about 50% of<br/>
the time they don&#39;t resist.  This was where I first noticed that it was<br/>
broken.  It used to work the way you describe and when I first got it I<br/>
could solo the small bandit camp in lesser fay by sleeping the bandits I<br/>
wasn&#39;t attacking just as you say.  Now, I&#39;d get waxed easily and I&#39;m 6<br/>
levels higher.  It just does not work the way it is supposed to anymore, and<br/>
since nothing has ever been said by Verant and the nods message is unchanged<br/>
I assume its broken.  Wiser heads than mine have noticed this.  John Kim is<br/>
a very successful bard and yet he has seen this and documented it before I<br/>
noticed it.  I started using it again after he reported it being broken and<br/>
found that he was correct.<br/>

Possible use for lullaby at L17...<br/>
<br/>
A friend on his L17 Bard, and I on my 19 shaman were in East Karana<br/>
killing gnoll reavers and undead reavers. He&#39;d go pull 2-4 and come<br/>
back. He&#39;d use lullaby to keep them all asleep except for the one he was<br/>
attacking. The paladin with us used /assist to target the correct<br/>
target, then tanked it. At the beginning of the fight, I AE&#39;d the mobs<br/>
with Infectious Cloud, a Disease AE DoT. Next pulse he&#39;d put them right<br/>
back to sleep, nixing me off the hate list so I could heal or med<br/>
without being mobbed. By the time the first target was dead, the other<br/>
2-3 targets would have been chewed to half health by the AE everytime.<br/>
It was quite a sight.<br/>
<br/>
Two things to keep in mind however, his stats were much higher than a<br/>
new player on a L17 because he was outfitted with better equipment, and<br/>
he&#39;d also played with many bards all the way to L50 in group on his<br/>
primary character, so he&#39;d been able to see Bards in action and ask many<br/>
questions about the techniques and tricks of others.<br/>
