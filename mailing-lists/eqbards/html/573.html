<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364825217">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
This my first post to the list but I thought I should say something<br/>
regarding the charging of fees for services.  Although the task is<br/>
sometimes time consuming and heck even irritating at times, doing this<br/>
task for free can have it&#39;s own benefits.  Usually I get a decent sized<br/>
donation from the person I help.  Many times I do not.  THough it is<br/>
frustrating that I do not get compensation there are still some benefits.<br/>
<br/>
First off, helping people is a great way to meet people.  I have made a<br/>
good number of friends doing this.  Heck one even made the trouble of<br/>
finding to give a thank you gift.  I wasn&#39;t to complain when she gave me a<br/>
banded belt. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, you never know when this person will in turn help you.  I helped<br/>
a cleric to find her corpse somewhere around orc camp.  She thanked me<br/>
profusely and offered payment which I refused.  Around two weeks later<br/>
someone started a train in CB(like that isn&#39;t a new occurance) and I was<br/>
barely able to get awy.  To me that was surprising since the whole castle<br/>
was bearing down on me.  In the end I found out that the cleric had<br/>
started a bard character and upon seeing me return my kindness by<br/>
sacrificing herslef to save me.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is not an occurance that you will see on a regular basis, but<br/>
these are somethings to consider when you announe that you are charging<br/>
for services.  People are less likely to be friendly to you.<br/>
