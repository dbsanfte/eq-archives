<b>Subject:</b> RE: Watching Shada level . . . <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237454463">it&#39;s hard now, but Shada started on day one and there was NO crowding and my<br/>
wife and i both play so that&#39;s a lot of time spent on the character.  as far<br/>
as my other characters, can&#39;t say i didn&#39;t have help (remember some thread<br/>
about twinking hehe). the other characters are a lot of fun, and sometimes<br/>
level in spurts when i get bored or Shada has nothing to do.  that will<br/>
definitely change Wednesday, can you say LAMBENT armor? wooo.<br/>

&gt; Hehe!  Keep up the good work <br/>
&gt; Shada!  How about<br/>
&gt; you start some characters on my server next and give me a few <br/>
&gt; pointers.<br/>
