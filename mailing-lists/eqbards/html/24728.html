&gt;This sounds like a good idea, until you realize what you are really<br/>
&gt;saying. Let&#39;s say, Gaelthorne, the bored Bard is soloing. Now, I am<br/>
&gt;lucky and I find two mobs with 2000 hp each (hey, it&#39;s just an<br/>
&gt;example, go with it.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I charm MOB A to fight MOB B, when MOB B is down to 500 life, I go in<br/>
&gt;for the kill. If I use MOB A to finish the fight, I get half exp (As<br/>
&gt;far as I know -- I believe this to be true.). If I let charm drop and<br/>
&gt;kill MOB B, MOB B will disappear and I will get NO exp. Why is this?<br/>
&gt;Simple, 1500 HP of damage is assigned to a MOB (remember the guards<br/>
&gt;in the newbie areas?) If you are outdamaged by a MOB, say bye, bye to<br/>
&gt;the exp.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aren&#39;t you supposed to charm your victim before you kill it to clear it&#39;s <br/>
exp history list? I thought this would ensure that you got the exp.<br/>
