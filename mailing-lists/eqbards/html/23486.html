<div id="ygrps-yiv-704507355">I&#39;ve twice had a guildmate win a roll for an item claiming to want to use<br/>
it, only to sell it within minutes of leaving the hunting area.  Both times<br/>
other guildmembers wanted the item for secondary characters.  I&#39;ve taken to<br/>
grouping with this person only when absolutely necessary, any suggestions on<br/>
another way to handle this?  It has caused me some discomfort.  Fortunately<br/>
the other bards in my guild are both excellent players and would never<br/>
participate in such shenanigans.<br/>

Were you in a pickup group when the Harmonic Dagger dropped?  I know there<br/>
are a lot of greedy players out there, but if I was in a group that made me<br/>
roll for the Harmonic Dagger or any Bard only item, I would quit the group<br/>
in disgust and never group with any of them again.<br/>
