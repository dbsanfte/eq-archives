<div id="ygrps-yiv-554232685">Too bad you aren&#39;t on E&#39;ci Talies I would gladly give you an infusion of<br/>
cash for some thicken mana potions so I could make some glowing silk gloves.<br/>
Having another friend who could bind would be the icing on the cake.  Expect<br/>
more complaints about binding to start showing up now that the ressurection<br/>
teleport duels have been eliminated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But that part of the economy is already broken.  I play a very poor gnome<br/>
enchanter (less than 1 plat most days because of trying to buy his 12th<br/>
level spells).  I sit near the gate in Freeport /shouting things like &quot;Poor<br/>
gnarled gnome binding for donations&quot;, while I meditate, which immediately<br/>
gets followed by someone else shouting &quot;Binding for free!&quot;  So, there is no<br/>
economy as long as people give things away or donations are not given.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Potentially??<br/>
I&#39;m half-tempted to start posting false stories about how we &quot;camp Vox with<br/>
our kamikaze casters&quot; just to get Verant to see the illogic.<br/>
I&#39;m all for game fun, too, which is why, when I have that incredibly rare<br/>
opportunity to join a group, I jump on it, even though I&#39;m bound in Arena,<br/>
and the group is in Mistmoore.  Let me tell you, that was one long walk.<br/>
So was I supposed to abandon the group for who knows how long (this is 4am<br/>
EST, btw), hoping to get a bind closer?  If NPCs had bind, and I could go<br/>
there great.  They still wouldn&#39;t be able to bind me at (for example) the<br/>
lesser faydark zone point (like PC casters can).  The economy wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
broken.  Heck - once the first person gave it away for free, it already<br/>
was.  Do you guys remember when it was &quot;Binding for 2pp&quot; instead of<br/>
&quot;donations&quot;??  That&#39;s a case of the economy being broken by uncaring<br/>
casters.<br/>
