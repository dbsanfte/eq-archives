Oh sorry couldn&#39;t resist, he&#39;s red to me you know.<br/>
<br/>
I have gotten slightly better prices than you list with my Charisma of 101.<br/>
I think I know why but I&#39;m not sure.  I agree that faction/race/deity plays<br/>
a part though faction and charisma are the big factors.  I definitely get<br/>
better prices with my charisma at 101 than at 97, even from warmly regarding<br/>
merchants of my own race.  Carillion has no effect on the prices from those<br/>
who already regard me at amiable, with the notable exception of those not of<br/>
my race.  I can carillion an amiable human, they stay amiable but the prices<br/>
go down a wee bit.  On those above amiable, kindly and warmly, it has no<br/>
effect on prices.<br/>
If you want the best prices consider your deity carefully.  Worshippers of<br/>
some deities are welcomed by nearly all the good races.  While most wood<br/>
elves are dubious to pixies, I am apprehensive.  The only difference I can<br/>
find is my religion over other wood elf bards I&#39;ve talked to.<br/>

&gt; Will the song, Cinda`s Charismatic Carillon aid you in getting better<br/>
prices<br/>
&gt; for selling/buying items?  Even if it just a few copper.  I wonder.<br/>
<br/>
Prices seem to be determined by charisma, faction, and<br/>
something else - possibly race and/or diety.  In general, when<br/>
I started the game at 110 charisma, I got the best possible<br/>
prices at all merchants who were indifferent or higher.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve played, I&#39;ve noticed that several friends with<br/>
charisma around 90 were getting the same prices as me (or<br/>
close to) from merchants who were amiable or higher.  There<br/>
are other instances which I haven&#39;t quite figured out yet<br/>
which I&#39;m chalking up to race or diety for now.  But in<br/>
general, especially with the Charisma song, a chr of 90 or so<br/>
should be sufficient to get you the best prices from most any<br/>
merchant.  (For reference, best selling prices are: minotaur<br/>
axe 3.33pp, greater lightstone 4.3?pp, bronze 2H sword 4pp,<br/>
combine rapier/longsword 47.621pp; best buying prices are:<br/>
combine rapier/longsword 52.5pp)<br/>
<br/>
Charisma definitely affects the duration of charm type songs<br/>
(Lament, Charisma, etc).  Other people here seem to complain<br/>
about the effect not lasting long enough for them to finish<br/>
lamenting all the mobs, or for them to buy/sell an item.  My<br/>
experience with 110 (120 now) charisma has been that the<br/>
effects of these songs last several minutes, even when played<br/>
without an instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Charisma is also rumored to affect the chance of certain songs<br/>
being resisted.  I&#39;ve seen no evidence to back this up, other<br/>
than a general observation that I find the Lullaby to be a<br/>
great song to use, while others seem to feel it gets resisted<br/>
too often.  Several enchanters also swear that charisma<br/>
decreases their resist rate, while others swear that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
In short, if I were starting a new bard knowing what I know<br/>
now, I&#39;d probably distribute my points equally between str,<br/>
dex, chr, and maybe agi.  I hadn&#39;t really intended to play a<br/>
bard full-time, and just thought it would be a good class with<br/>
which to get a feel for the game.  So I put all my points into<br/>
chr to test its effect on prices.  Little did I know I&#39;d end<br/>
up hooked on playing a bard...  :-)<br/>
