<div id="ygrps-yiv-203426381">It does not refute it at all.  Clarity pulse once every six seconds, our <br/>
songs have a 3 second casting time (time from when you start the song till <br/>
the first effect is felt). So weaving clarity with 1 song = little to no <br/>
loss of mana regen, as the clarity song will pulse every 6 to 7 seconds <br/>
depending on your manual dexterity, computer&#39;s framerate, and missed notes.  <br/>
You can even weave it with to songs and still get nearly the same effect <br/>
like this:  Song1 -&gt; Clarity -&gt; Song2 -&gt; Clarity -&gt; Song1 -&gt; Clarity, etc...<br/>

&gt;Greetings all =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This seems to refute the findings that John Kim came up with<br/>
&gt;when he did the Mana Song vs. Mana Song/Heal Song twist test.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I can recall correctly, he found NO difference between singing<br/>
&gt;the mana song by itself versus singing the mana song with the heal<br/>
&gt;song mixed in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Did I miss something ? GZ seems to imply that &quot;If she aint<br/>
&gt;singing it, the finger wigglers arn&#39;t getting their crack&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Comments ?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Clarity)?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A: There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an<br/>
&gt; &gt; icon on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>
&gt; &gt; seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration -<br/>
&gt; &gt; this means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep the song effect going indefinitely.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it<br/>
&gt; &gt; does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your<br/>
&gt; &gt; screen.<br/>
