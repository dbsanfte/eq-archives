<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985056594">I think they cast some type of faction spell on each other that makes them<br/>
con differently than they really con.  Sounds funny but I seriously heard<br/>

&gt; amiable to indifferent, so I cruise up there and WHAMMO.  Dead as a<br/>
&gt; doornail.  I was 16th level, and I was dead in less than 2 <br/>
&gt; seconds.  Not to<br/>
&gt; mention I lost my level retrieving my corpse. *sigh*.  Now...last I<br/>
&gt; checked, amiable and indifferent didn&#39;t make them want to <br/>
&gt; kill you..or I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; REALLY be dead in most cities.  What&#39;s going on w/ that? </span></blockquote></div>
