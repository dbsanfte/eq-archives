<div id="ygrps-yiv-779119914">Ugh - that is not so good in some spots.<br/>
<br/>
We were hunting the Shraylok orcs in kith some time ago and could see one<br/>
casting.  Ranger tracked to him and we were right on top of him.  I somehow<br/>
got one glimpse of him before he slipped under the world and targeted him.<br/>
I could bellow him down to ´┐¢ health but he would heal him self back.  I<br/>
could not out dmg him and gave up after 30 minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow - he was stuck &quot;under the world&quot; but he could fight me and cast on me<br/>
and melee me too.  Dragging enraged dreads to the zone and them getting<br/>
stuck under the world there could be really ugly - zone in get attacked hard<br/>
by stuff you cant see - ugh.<br/>
<br/>
In some places, Verant has code for stuff going &quot;under the world&quot;  - you can<br/>
see this if you use any of the &quot;short cuts&quot; - the message says that the<br/>
system detects you under the world and moves you to a &quot;safe spot.&quot;<br/>
Hopefully, they track mobs the same way and they get moved to the &quot;safe<br/>
spot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BTW - if you die a weird death in South Karana - and suspect some thing<br/>
strange has happened or you saw a &quot;you fell off the world&quot; message.  The<br/>
&quot;safe spot&quot; is about 500 meters on a diagnol to the right (southwest) of the<br/>
stone bridge as you face to the south or into the zone.  Of course, you are<br/>
a bard and your loc song will find you but you will be very suspicious<br/>
because it will find you in a very different spot from where you (or the<br/>
adventurer you are helping) thinks you (he) died.<br/>
