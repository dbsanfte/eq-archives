<div id="ygrps-yiv-434316236">With Lullaby, it took me a few levels before it seemed to work well.  I was<br/>
using it last night in Permafrost too.  I found out the best way is to equip<br/>
lute, then back out of the fray.  This way when they do wake up, they&#39;ll<br/>
attack a tank, not you, until they go back to sleep the next pulse.<br/>
<br/>
	I used to try singing lullaby while wacking them with my swords, and that<br/>
did nothing but get them really pissed at me.<br/>
