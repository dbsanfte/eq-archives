&gt; &gt; &gt;I also bought my combine longsword for 52.5pp and my charisma is 90.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just went to the Oasis gypsies yesterday on Veeshan with my 95 <br/>
&gt;charisma<br/>
&gt; &gt; and was quoted 54.8 plat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Obviously there&#39;s more going on here.  Can you answer the<br/>
&gt;following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is your race and diety?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How did the gypsies view you (amiable?  indifferent?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What is the selling price you&#39;re offered for the combine<br/>
&gt;longsword at your guild merchant?  (47.5pp here)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can you check the price for a well-balanced longsword on the<br/>
&gt;shady swashbuckler between North Ro and Easy Commonlands?  I<br/>
&gt;get 223pp plus change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm interesting. You must be wood elf i&#39;m guessing then.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The gypsies were indifferent (or amiable) to me. I&#39;m human.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Oasis gypsies are indifferent to me as well.  My bard is a<br/>
&gt;wood elf, diety is Erollisi Marr.  (DON&#39;T LAUGH!  I figured<br/>
&gt;it&#39;d be nice to be friendly with the paladin guilds and the<br/>
&gt;diety description says many paladins follow Erollisi, so I<br/>
&gt;picked it.  Now that I&#39;ve played the game some, the only<br/>
&gt;followers of Erollisi I&#39;ve found are the Sisters of Erollisi<br/>
&gt;in the Ocean of Tears. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I checked with the oasis gypsies and the shady Swashbuckler, and the <br/>
both consider me indifferently. As I stated before I have a CHA of 93, and <br/>
my deity is Quellious the Tranquil. The gypsies will sell me a combine long <br/>
sword for about 54.7 plat. The other day the Shady Swashbuckler was asking <br/>
231 plat for a well-balanced long-sword. Last night he was asking 238.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve noticed the sisters of Erollisi &quot;kindly consider me&quot;<br/>
&gt;instead of considering me amiably or indifferently.  Is this<br/>
&gt;what other people are seeing from NPCs with the same diety?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure this is the case. My high elf wizard of Tunare was kindly <br/>
considered by most of the denizens of Felwithe (especially the Paladin <br/>
guildmasters).<br/>
