&gt;I was headed toward Kithicor tonite and was running along the dessert wall<br/>
&gt;in West Commons and lo and behold I caught up with Gix, taking the path<br/>
&gt;along the wall .  Never had seen a mob on a wall like that before, but I<br/>
&gt;digress.  Back to what I was saying when I saw him he conned blue to me at<br/>
&gt;19th.  He probably has different levels at which he spawns in at.  And<br/>
&gt;another thing I found odd was that he only viewed me threatingly, not<br/>
&gt;scowls.  Hmph go figure.<br/>

&gt;19th Bard - yea I know I level slow, working 50 to 60 hours a week will do<br/>
&gt;that to ya.  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dorn B&#39;dynn in N. Ro used to ignore me (but not the Ogre Thug who<br/>
was standing next to him once).  My first time in Ro, I ran right up to<br/>
him, and hailed him, and he did nothing.  I&#39;m assuming this is due to<br/>
my diety being Bristlebane, god of thieves.</div>
