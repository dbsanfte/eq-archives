&gt;I think overall as a class - MOST bards - at least those well suited to the<br/>
&gt;role have matured past having to be the center of attention and HERO of the<br/>
&gt;day.<br/>

minor features the game provides in that area are in need of a huge ammount<br/>
of work.  In short, if you like non combat EverQuest just isn&#39;t for you.  I<br/>
would never want to give anything away just for a skill where I target an<br/>
NPC or get within a certain distance and press a button, get a few copper if<br/>
you are successful or nothing if you fail, and then do it over and over and<br/>
over and over again.  At least combat is a little more complex then that,<br/>
even if a bard is a twitch character.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are the true jack of all trades in EQ, and I LOVE that.  I don&#39;t even<br/>
have downtime compared to my other classes!  Forget meditating for five to<br/>
ten minutes after a fight, I am a bard.  :)  I get to run fast, wear armor,<br/>
get weapons, duel weild, cast spells in the form of songs, have  a very<br/>
diverse list of song abilities, and to top it all off I get tracking!  We<br/>
get some of everything.  We may not be masters at any on thing, but boy is<br/>
it fun to do so much!<br/>
