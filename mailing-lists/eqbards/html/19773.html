given instances - if a positive doesn&#39;t turn up (like a drop) it is <br/>
subsituted. I once camped the SBS for 7 straight hours - killing <br/>
every single one - nothing - then 3 in a row. Why should anyone have <br/>
to camp for that length of time for one item? <br/>
That is one reason some folks term this game Evercamp.<br/>
<br/>
I love this idea.  And they could actually take it one step further <br/>
to not make it so predictable.  If they want a 20% spawn rate, for <br/>
example, they start at 10% immediately after it spawns and for every <br/>
PH spawn they increase it by 5%.  If you&#39;ve gone 5 spawns without <br/>
one, you&#39;ve actually got a 35% chance of it spawning.  If it doesn&#39;t <br/>
spawn for another 5 cycles, you&#39;re up to 60% chance.  Cap it at 90% <br/>
so there&#39;s no absolute.  This would give statistical weight to the <br/>
thinking of &quot;We haven&#39;t seen it in hours, we&#39;re due!&quot; and put the <br/>
statistics and perspective back in balance.<br/>
<br/>
Verant also needs to seriously reconsider how they place the &quot;uber&quot; <br/>
mobs of a dungeon.  In Dalnir&#39;s, the uber mob is The Kly.  He drops <br/>
the Necklace of Superiority.  He&#39;s a level 40 or so mob that casts a <br/>
500 pt AE Ice based spell and he cast&#39;s it FAST.  The rest of the <br/>
mobs in the room (or the whole dungeon for that matter) are &lt;35.  I <br/>
can&#39;t think of any possible combination of a group that could take <br/>
The Kly down and still get exp on all the surrounding mobs.  So, if <br/>
you want to go for this item, you&#39;re not only in for a long camp <br/>
(very rare spawn, we&#39;ve seen 2 in 20+ hours), you&#39;re also in for <br/>
getting absolutely no exp the whole time you&#39;re there.  Which leads <br/>
to high level players camping in spots that really should be reserved <br/>
for lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, imo, the combination of these 2 changes would make <br/>
drastic improvements to the game.<br/>
