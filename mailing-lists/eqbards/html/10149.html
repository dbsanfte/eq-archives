&gt;Subject: [eqbards] dual weild<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1999 15:54:21 PST<br/>

&gt;Hello Bards and friends,<br/>
&gt;    Seeing that I&#39;m nearing lvl 17, i was curious about a few things<br/>
&gt;really...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) What is a good strategy to use while dual weilding?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you want to maximize your skill checks and your chance to DW place your <br/>
fastest weapon in your secondary slot.  Your DW skill is checked whenever <br/>
the delay on your secondary weapon goes off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) I&#39;m currently equipped with a PGT (dmg 6 del 24, berserker str proc wt <br/>
&gt;6)<br/>
&gt;and SBS (shield of course will go bye bye), and a Pugius Dagger (dmg 5 del<br/>
&gt;21 wt 2.?) which I use to hone my piercing skills after the PGT has already<br/>
&gt;proc&#39;d. [BTW, i realize that proc means cast, but what does it stand for or<br/>
&gt;mean? =)] So will weilding both of these drain my stamina too quickly you<br/>
&gt;think?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually the Dagger is a good, fast secondary weapon.  The PGT on the other <br/>
hand is heavy and will drain your stamina in a medium to long battle while <br/>
DW&#39;ing.  You can devote a song slot to Jaxon&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor to replenish <br/>
stamina in battle or find a lighter primary weapon.  The PGT is a great <br/>
weapon up till your mid to high 20&#39;s, around 27/28th level you will find <br/>
most mobs will blast through it in ont to two rounds leaving you with a <br/>
mediocore  str buff and a massive agility penalty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;3) And what are some good hot keys to have set up as I&#39;m just learning the<br/>
&gt;skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No hot keys required.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4) When you auto attack, do both weapons go auto or must you continue to<br/>
&gt;click on some key or repeatedly type something?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both weapons will attack automaticly and independently of each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;5) What are some other good relatively inexpensive weapons to use for this?<br/>
&gt;Some ideas i have are Bladed Thulian Claws, Dragoon Dirk, and a 1h staff<br/>
&gt;possibly a Staff of Writhing. Those are still a little out of my price <br/>
&gt;range<br/>
&gt;though; Dirk is not, but no one seems to ever want to let one go. =P Unless<br/>
&gt;they just ran across a Runed Bone Fork - in my dreams!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Well I guess I can wait on some gift from the Gods or help from you<br/>
&gt;friendly wanderers of Norrath. My ears have turned to you folks (good <br/>
&gt;choice<br/>
&gt;eh? lol)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The slower, heavier weapons will be stamina hogs in battle, and going OOS <br/>
(out of stamina) in a battle is a bad thing, you will take big hits to your <br/>
attributes.  The light fast weapons will aliviate this problem at the <br/>
expense of damage dealt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Pava, Bard of measure 16<br/>
&gt;Silent Dragons<br/>
&gt;Cazic Thule<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One final note on DW, is you need to place no skill points in it at all for <br/>
it to go up.  You get it free at 17th level.<br/>
