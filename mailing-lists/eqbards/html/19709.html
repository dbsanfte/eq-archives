&gt; Grouping I get, I&#39;ve got to sell myself better to get in a group.<br/>
<br/>
    I don&#39;t normally have trouble finding a group or creating one.  Here&#39;s<br/>
the way I normally find one.  I go to an area where there are likely people<br/>
my level.  Then I look around using /who to find people around my level<br/>
(from approximately 2-3 levels below --&gt; 2-3 levels above mine.)  Then I<br/>
wander around to the various areas within the zone and observe the existing<br/>
groups.  I&#39;ll ask to be invited into a group if they seem to need a bard.<br/>
If I can&#39;t find a group that way, I /tell people who aren&#39;t yet grouped to<br/>
invite them to *my* group. =)<br/>
<br/>
    I try tanks first. If they don&#39;t have a healer, they are usually very<br/>
happy to group with me.  Then I&#39;ll invite casters to round out the group.  I<br/>
try to take groups to places that aren&#39;t normally explored (e.g. find people<br/>
in Oasis then once grouped suggest going to Upper Guk, find people in East<br/>
Commons and suggest Najena, etc.)  Be sure to discuss where you will be<br/>
going AFTER they are grouped or many people will shy away. ;P<br/>
<br/>
    I sometimes end up fighting in the same zone but quite often people are<br/>
interested in a little adventure.  It&#39;s great to be a bard and get people<br/>
quickly to unusual places and it creates memorable grouping experiences.  I<br/>
try to pick locations where the group can get started on easy creatures and<br/>
get a feel for things before taking on tougher fights and risking death.<br/>
Dying always sucks and you really don&#39;t want to create that kind of grouping<br/>
experience. ;P<br/>
<br/>
    Quite often at the lower levels people won&#39;t necessarily know how a bard<br/>
can help.  Show them your song combos before battle if possible so they get<br/>
an idea.  For example, when I explain my strategy for taking down casters by<br/>
resist buffing, I&#39;ll get out my drums and play my resist songs then ask<br/>
people to let me know their stats.  It shows them how much I can buff and<br/>
gives me a good idea of how much damage they are likely to resist.  People<br/>
with resists significantly under 100 won&#39;t resist as much but I&#39;ve had<br/>
people who were buffed to near 100 MR almost entirely resist 15 blasts in a<br/>
row (regularly) from con even ice goblin wizards.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the fun places I have grouped and hunted from around level<br/>
15:<br/>
-    Upper Guk (clear scryer room from the antechamber)<br/>
-    Permafrost (clear the way to the flag room)<br/>
-    Befallen (lower level)<br/>
-    Crushbone (castle and the tower)<br/>
-    Blackburrow (Commander rooms)<br/>
-    Oasis of Marr (Orc highway or Crocs solo)<br/>
-    South Ro Desert (derv camps, dry bones, ghouls)<br/>
-    West Commons (derv camp, ghouls outside Befallen)<br/>
-    Lesser Faydark (Orc Chief camp)<br/>
-    East Karanas (Gnoll reavers, Gorge hounds, beetles)<br/>
-    Lake Rathetear (Gnoll camp and some aviak spawns)<br/>
-    South Karanas (Aviak Village and elephants)<br/>
-    Gorge of King Xorbe (Muddites and Gorge Minotaurs)<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;m sure there are many more fun areas that I haven&#39;t found yet since I<br/>
haven&#39;t even begun to explore Kunark.  Some non-kunark zones that I haven&#39;t<br/>
explored enough to list include Kerra Isle(haven&#39;t been there since it was<br/>
upgraded), the Hole, Lost Temple of Cazic Thule(too hard for 15), Lavastorm<br/>
(fire elementals, fire drakes, rock dervishes?), Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron (Aqua<br/>
Goblin Mariners?), Estate of Unrest (Death beetles and other yard trash?),<br/>
Mistmoore Castle (group of 17+ to take the familiars?), Steamfont (Minotaur<br/>
slavers?), etc. I hope that answers your questions about grouping and where<br/>
to hunt!  Explore around and there are lots of interesting things to find.<br/>

BTW, the idea behind my guild (Imperturbable Fellowship) is to learn the<br/>
various classes (capabilities and limitations) and grouping strategies that<br/>
promote teamwork, strong communication and lots of fun.  I&#39;m always looking<br/>
to learn new things so if anyone has suggestions for grouping, please let me<br/>
know. Thanks! And sorry for another long post :)<br/>
