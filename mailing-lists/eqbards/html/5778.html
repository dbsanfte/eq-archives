<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857959649">Solusek B (Nagefen&#39;s Lair) is flagged See Invisible as a dungeon. Every<br/>
single monster there can see invisible. In Lower Guk, Undead Frogs can now<br/>
see through Bard invis. Spiders and bats cannot, and neither can the live<br/>
frogluks. I am not sure whether Greater Iced Bones can or not, but I would<br/>
recommend having your cleric invis you to Undead.<br/>
<br/>
The undead froggies could not see through bard invis last patch and it was<br/>
changed.The Undead in Unrest still cannot however. One good thing about Bard<br/>
invis in Unrest is that neither the living things (tentacle terrors, fungus)<br/>
or the dead things (skeles and hags) can see through our invis. Anyone else<br/>
needs both invis and invis to undead, and a quick prayer that neither wear<br/>
off to fast, since I don&#39;t believe any class has both. Yay bards.<br/>
<br/>
Two things about bard invis - the higher you get, the less it blinks. I&#39;d<br/>
say mine has blinked maybe once in the last 4 hours of use (now at 195<br/>
skill). Secondly, remember that if you go into auto-attack mode you<br/>
immediately become visible, so be careful when you are typing (ever try to<br/>
talk to an NPC and accidentally auto-attack him? I have).<br/>
