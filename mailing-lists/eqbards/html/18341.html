&gt; It appears that the number of reaver spawns in the City of Mist is<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, the number of reavers isn&#39;t proportional to the number of groups as far<br/>
as we&#39;ve been able to tell on Saryn.  So far we&#39;ve gone with 4 groups twice<br/>
and gotten 2 reavers once and 1 reaver the other time.  Hardly anyone does<br/>
CoM right now, they&#39;re all in Karnor&#39;s ;)  So I&#39;m reasonably sure that the<br/>
number of Reavers isn&#39;t affected by the number of groups in the zone.  To be<br/>
honest I dont see how the code could support something like this anyway.<br/>
