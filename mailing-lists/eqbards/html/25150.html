Seems to me that with what they are charging - it&#39;s going to be a<br/>
&quot;profit<br/>
center&quot; for Verant.  I&#39;m concerned that Bards will be the type of<br/>
character<br/>
where we&#39;ll see significant E-Bay&#39;ers.  I expect to see a lot of bards<br/>
in SS<br/>
and POG armor with no idea how the songs work - let alone twisting.</div>
