<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872191697">I did find a short list that attempts to put prices on the most<br/>
commonly sold items, at least on the Mith Marr server anyway.  It has<br/>
been rather helpful in not getting ripped off on certain items I&#39;ve<br/>
bought, and also in making sure I&#39;m not getting ripped off when<br/>
selling too  hehe<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to know the URL, let me know and I can post it here or<br/>
email it to you so others don&#39;t have the temptation to peek!<br/>

&gt;The more I think about it, I think someone needs to set out a full out price<br/>
&gt;scale of items for everyone to use at least as a reference.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;consistantly annoyed to see people trying to oversell items to people who<br/>
&gt;just don&#39;t have a feel for what an item is worth.<br/>
