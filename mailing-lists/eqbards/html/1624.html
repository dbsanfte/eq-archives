<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566535329">Actually, the patch message seemed to indicate their would be no method<br/>
possible to speed up a bard&#39;s mana regen rate, it gave no indication of<br/>
any change that would alter how current bard songs *may* speed mana<br/>
regen for other party members (or maybe I just read it wrong).<br/>
