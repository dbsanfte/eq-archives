<b>Subject:</b> Too much EQ (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-896330934">Been reading this list since digest #50, figured I&#39;ve spent way too much time at it. I&#39;ve enjoyed many of the threads here, disliked some of the bickering.  <br/>
<br/>
Thought I&#39;d post a couple Signs you&#39;ve been playing to much EQ as posted to our guild message board by two members, maybe you&#39;ll get a grin:<br/>
<br/>
1. You have to squelch a cry of &quot;Griff&quot; when you catch a glimpse of a low-flying small aircraft. <br/>
<br/>
2. You mutter &quot;Why don&#39;t people loot their kills&quot; as you pass a dead animal on the side of the road. <br/>
<br/>
3. You finally camp for the night, and reaching your bedroom, say &quot;Hail, a irate spouse&quot;. <br/>

4) When your spouse enters the room and sees you at the computer, she automatically cons red and &quot;poised ready to attack - what would you like your tombstone to say?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
5) You know the family pet will give you no exp, but you really need a pair of fur-lined gloves.....<br/>

On another note I&#39;m just about to get Lullaby and I fight in large groups whenever possible, what song combo would you suggest? (I&#39;ve got full banded, snakeskin gloves & mask and a dragoon dirk)<br/>
