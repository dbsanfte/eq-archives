<div id="ygrps-yiv-450964171">I would agree with the suggestion to make bear hide boots at least.  I have<br/>
made and sold maybe 50 or so of these things at 5pp each.  Also a quick run<br/>
to surefall will net you a mail run at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Lament is the best song you get other than Selo&#39;s until you are 11th level.<br/>
It will allow you to easily solo critters characters 5 levels higher than<br/>
you just look at because they can&#39;t take 3 at once.  It allowed me to sol at<br/>
the bandit camp in Lesser Faydark 4 levels before anyone else I ever saw<br/>
there.  No one else could handle the multiple spawns they would have to<br/>
face, but I could easily pull one out at a time and make boocou plat off the<br/>
bronze spears they carried.  same deal in w karana with bandits if you are<br/>
careful.  If Lament is resisted you just flee immediately via Selo&#39;s and<br/>
there&#39;s no problem.  <br/>

I&#39;m a flat broke minstrel of the 8th verse bound to Qeynos and I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if it&#39;s worth my while to try to earn enough PP and make trek back to<br/>
Kelethin to purchase Kelin&#39;s Lament.  I can&#39;t recall any of you more<br/>
experienced folks posting anything about how Lament has saved your life more<br/>
times than you can remember or wow&#39;d your friends.  Should I just start<br/>
saving up for Elemental Rhythms?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what&#39;s the next step up from rusty/splintered weapons and is there<br/>
anyplace a bard my age can go to where she may loot them?<br/>
