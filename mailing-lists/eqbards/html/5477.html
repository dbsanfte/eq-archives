&gt;    However, the problem I have with using Pixie Strike<br/>
&gt;    for crowd control is this, I have to keep changing <br/>
&gt;    targets. And I don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but<br/>
&gt;    sometimes, I find it impossible to click on the mob<br/>
&gt;    I wish to target. This is esp true when all of them<br/>
&gt;    are clumped together. <br/>

being a good little group and all attacking the same target,<br/>
the others should fixate on you.  Back off to separate them<br/>
from the one lone target.  Now target any of the ones you&#39;ve<br/>
separated and Pixie Strike it.  Back off again to separate<br/>
that one from the others (though at this point there really<br/>
should only be one other, otherwise you should be using<br/>
Lullaby).  Pixie Strike the remaining mob, then position<br/>
yourself so you can easily target the two mobs you&#39;re pausing<br/>
while getting a good view of the mob your group is fighting.<br/>
With lower level blues, I don&#39;t have a problem keeping two<br/>
Struck while Chaining the mob my group is fighting.<br/>
<br/>
This is also a good tactic to separate out mobs for your<br/>
enchanter to mesmerize if you have one.  It works especially<br/>
well if the enchanter can mesmerize the extras outside of<br/>
aggro range, so when they become un-mesmerized they either<br/>
stand there or go away.  (Which incidently is probably why<br/>
Pixie Strike doesn&#39;t clear the hate list - if it did, we&#39;d be<br/>
unstoppable.  :-)<br/>
