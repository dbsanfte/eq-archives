<b>Subject:</b> Weapon dmg formula (Boring calculations) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-90593105">Ok, does anyone know the *real*, *actual* formula for the maximum weapon<br/>
dmg?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to explain why i&#39;m confused over this issue.<br/>
With a skill lvl of 180 in piercing and 1h slash, and 175 in offense...<br/>
And my strength remained at 116...<br/>
<br/>
With a barbed whip - 7 dmg 28 delay, my maximum dmg was 23.<br/>
With a dragoon dirk - 6 dmg 23 delay, my maximum dmg was 21.<br/>
With an ashenwood short spear - 6 dmg 22 delay, my maximum dmg was 21.<br/>
With a silvery war axe - 6 dmg 22 delay, my maximum dmg was 21.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, all my 6 dmg weapons were maxing at 21. And the barbed<br/>
whip, 7 dmg, was maxing at 23.<br/>
<br/>
The following formula would be true according to my above examples:<br/>
Weapon dmg * 2 + skill lvl/strength bonuses. Every couple levels, as my<br/>
skills increase, my max dmg goes up as well.<br/>
So, with my current skill levels and strength factors, it would be<br/>
Weapon dmg * 2 + 9<br/>
Barbed whip - 7 * 2 + 9 = 23<br/>
Silvery axe, dirk, ashenwood spear - 6 * 2 + 9 = 21<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s where I became confused and threw a wrench into my whole<br/>
formula.<br/>
I equipped a new weapon, which has a dmg of 11.<br/>
But, so far (haven&#39;t had oppurtunity to test it a whole lot), its max<br/>
dmg peaked at 35<br/>
Certain weapon - 11 * 2 + 9 = 31. So how was I hitting for 35?<br/>
Obviously my formula is not correct.<br/>
Reminding you again, my skill levels and strength stayed constant<br/>
through out this experience.<br/>
<br/>
So, what is the correct formula? I haven&#39;t a clue anymore. I sure would<br/>
like to know though. Knowledge is power afterall =)<br/>
<br/>
J.M., you&#39;d probably have the most insight into these matters, and<br/>
you&#39;ve become the Brad McQuaid of Bards, hehe. So if you know the weapon<br/>
dmg formula and would like to share, I&#39;d be most interested.<br/>
If any other bards, or non-bards for that matter, have some kind of<br/>
insight into this matter I&#39;d sure appreciate any light you could shed on<br/>
the subject. I don&#39;t want to pin this on J.M., just because he&#39;s a<br/>
celebrity now =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
