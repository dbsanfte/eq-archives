<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000948049">I doubt that.  I have played about 3 times the hours total with my other<br/>
characters that I have with my bard and have NEVER seen it with any of them.<br/>
I have seen it dozens of times with my bard.  Even Verant&#39;s random number<br/>
generator is not that clumpy.<br/>

You lost that bet.  I am a cleric and it happens all the time.  &quot;Bard Hate&quot;<br/>
is a myth.  It happens to all classes and the reason is unknown.<br/>

&gt; Sure other classes may get a random spell thrown at them<br/>
&gt; occassionally, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m willing to bet your cleric has never had a MOB leave it&#39;s fight, run<br/>
&gt; across the battlefield and start beating on him when he was just<br/>
&gt; standing by<br/>
&gt; observing.<br/>
