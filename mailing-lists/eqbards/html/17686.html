great deal of time studying Kedge, figured out that there are specific MOBs <br/>
who, if killed, cause an additional guardian to spawn.  Seeing a dozen isn&#39;t <br/>
at all unusual if you wait too long after a server reset.  If they&#39;ll reset <br/>
that, it&#39;s an interesting thing to know.  Right now, we just don&#39;t bother with <br/>
Phinny if it&#39;s been more than a few days since the last reset.<br/>
