<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451949828">I tried one that worked in all modes (slight variation of the original EQ one), even though you could read it in all modes, you had to strain to read some of the lines.<br/>
<br/>
Heh....never thought of it as a Klingon name...based it as a Drasnian name from David Edding&#39;s Belgariad and Mallorean.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on the colors, I&#39;m still not happy with the bright red shouts (still VI&#39;s defaults)...anyone have a better idea on the shout color?<br/>

you have to end up in low-res occasionally (check the XP bard - inventory,<br/>
etc)...<br/>

I&#39;m currently using Khelan and it&#39;s working fine..<br/>

Heya Khelan - your name would also make a great Klingon name!<br/>
