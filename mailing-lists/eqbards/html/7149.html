 </span></blockquote>I have dueled Shamans and Clerics of equal level without spells.  I lost 5<br/>
out of 7 duels.  They were stronger, had more hit points and had about equal<br/>
armor if not superior due to superior strength.  I had higher dex and<br/>
agility which seemed to matter, but not enough to make me win.  I imagine I<br/>
could beat most druids in pure melee due to far better ac, but a glowing<br/>
crook staff would rapidly even things out as we have no equivalent melee<br/>
weapon below the 30+ levels.  That staff rocks!  Too bad we have a max skill<br/>
of 1 in 2HS and 2HB.<br/>
<br/>
I have only dueled a ranger in ranged combat only.  No contest he smoked me<br/>
taking only 2 bubbles of health.  Of course he did use a bow which we cannot<br/>
use.  Main problem was we were 16th at the time and he could camo and I<br/>
could not.  He knew when he was in range, I did not.  He knew which way to<br/>
run to get in range, I did not.  I am sure I could beat either if we used<br/>
only spells.<br/>

&gt;Many (most) of the Bard songs improve the entire group.  A solo Bard is<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;fighting with one arm tied behind your back.  Comparing Bards to any other<br/>
&gt;class in solo capabilities is not a fair comparison of the overall<br/>
&gt;powerfulness of a class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never compared just the solo ability.  Always said our group abilities help<br/>
mitigate our solo weaknesses.  At 20th level those weakness become zero<br/>
effectiveness.  Balancing that would require group invincibility.  Instead<br/>
we become group target without the ability to properly defend ourselves.  I<br/>
agree we are more powerful in party combat.  I do not compare simply our<br/>
solo ability to that of others.  You cannot always get a competent group to<br/>
play with in non-primetime hours.  I do however maintain that our<br/>
CONSIDERABLE group play advantages are not equal to our VAST solo<br/>
deficiencies.  The two do not balance out.  I find no other class where this<br/>
is true.  Every other class is fairly balanced when one considers its solo<br/>
abilities  and its party benefits together against each of the other<br/>
classes.<br/>

&gt;Bard songs will never be as magically powerful as other casters (pure and<br/>
&gt;priest types).  But Bards have a huge advantage of never needed mana (lvl<br/>
 </span></blockquote>43<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;song excepted).  It is not a fair to compare the effectiveness of a bard<br/>
&gt;song which can be repeated as much as needed to a spell which comsumes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mana.<br/>
<br/>
Not entirely true.  I can only continue to use the song until the mob kills<br/>
me.  If in that amount of time another class can kill then mob without dying<br/>
when at 75% mana then I would say it is obvious they are more effective than<br/>
a bard.  It is relatively easy to maintain a resource of known value (mana)<br/>
at a reasonable level.  The result is less downtime for bards since we don&#39;t<br/>
need to meditate to regain mana.  The cost of that downtime is far greater<br/>
ineffectiveness when at full power or even at 75%.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The above statements are facts and cannot be disputed.  Every Bard should<br/>
&gt;understand these facts.  If you base your discussion on something to the<br/>
&gt;contrary, your whole logic chain falls apart.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No need to base the discussion on anything else, they clearly are opinions,<br/>
not facts.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line again is I play a bard because it is my nature.  Not because it<br/>
is the most powerful class, or even in my opinion equally powerful to any<br/>
onther class.  It is more fun, FOR ME, because it is my nature.  The<br/>
continuing ineffectiveness is reducing that FUN bit by bit.  Eventually, at<br/>
the current rate of nerfing, it will not be fun and I will play another<br/>
class or another game.  While there is no other class that can do all the<br/>
things I like to do, there is nothing I can do as a bard that another class<br/>
cannot do better, well except that flute dance thing.  There are other<br/>
things I would like to do that other classes can do that I cannot.  One is<br/>
being able to play without being at the whim of others to &quot;tie one hand<br/>
behind my back&quot; for me.<br/>
