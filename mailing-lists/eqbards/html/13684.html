&gt; I would have to agree with the previous poster that in Oasis, we were seeing<br/>
&gt; about 1 helm every 5 gobs or so... Maybe the drop rate is MUCH lower in<br/>
&gt; Rathe?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  No, thats not it.  The monster table that Verant uses says<br/>
  that a DW goblin will drop a helm X % of the time.  Because you<br/>
  happened to get a helm 1 out of 5, doesnt mean the next time a<br/>
  helm did drop it wouldn&#39;t have come maybe on the 20th one?  I got<br/>
  my helm on the first DW goblin I killed.  It took me well over<br/>
  20 griffennes to get a charm the first time.  The second time I got it<br/>
  on the third try.  It&#39;s the way statistics work.<br/>
