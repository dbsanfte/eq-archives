<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654505145">I&#39;ve never seen a demon claw at 500pp; if your getting it fo that much I<br/>
would say buy it. They are low weight, and very fast. Defintely worth<br/>
the money unless your heading into lower guk anytime soon and getting<br/>
some of the great stuff there. At 30 I wouldn&#39;t expect you to pay for<br/>
one anyway. Pick up digs and head into Cazic-thule and start hunting up<br/>
that rubicite. The same guy with the breastplate has the claw. I&#39;m kinda<br/>
surprised you haven&#39;t hunted it down yet, as on Solusek Ro I rarely see<br/>
someone above 30 or so not in cazic-thule once they&#39;ve been there a few<br/>
days, and I kinda feel bad that I haven&#39;t gotten it once, though I have<br/>
hunted in groups that kiled both golems, and many tae ews, considering<br/>
I&#39;ve hunted there for quite some time now.<br/>

&gt; Anyways, is a demon claw worth 500 pp? It&#39;s a dam 5 delay 19 weapon and comes off the Avatar of Fear in Cazic.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to shell out my entire bank just because it&#39;s the loot of a high level creature.<br/>
