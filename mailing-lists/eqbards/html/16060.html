<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631875999"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;Adam Wasserman&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wassermana@...">wassermana@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m here for some advice. I don&#39;t want to spoil anyone&#39;s fun so I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;mention the name of the mob or the zone, I was just wondering if any of you<br/>
&gt;have killed him firsthand. If so, what level would you recommend for <br/>
&gt;soloing<br/>
&gt;him or for a party killing him. Also, what faction hits do you take (if you<br/>
&gt;remember)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can answer this for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
1) the spawn time on this NPC is 6 hours with no placeholders.<br/>
<br/>
2) The earring is his rare drop. I&#39;ve happened upon him 6 or 7 times, he&#39;s <br/>
never had it.<br/>
<br/>
3) You take bad faction with the area (don&#39;t remember the factions offhand <br/>
but its the same as the factions you&#39;d take for killing a guard in that <br/>
zone).<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember now what level I was when he conned white to me, but it was <br/>
in my 20&#39;s somewhere. He is pretty easy for his level, but at least on our <br/>
server, its impossible to find him uncamped (and even when he appears <br/>
uncamped, if you hang around til he spawns you&#39;ll find a few druids and <br/>
wizards gate in just in time to kill him then gate out again).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
