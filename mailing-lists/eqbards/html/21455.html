<br/>
*Level 1 Character Purge*<br/>
<br/>
The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take <br/>
place on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7).  Any <br/>
level 1 characters that haven&#39;t been played within the previous 30 <br/>
days will be deleted.  If you wish to keep any level 1 characters <br/>
that you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***Patch Day***<br/>
<br/>
As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more <br/>
content for EverQuest players, today&#39;s patch primarily consists of <br/>
*many* content-additions to the game.  <br/>
<br/>
*New Epic Quests*<br/>
<br/>
We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new &quot;Fiery <br/>
Avenger&quot; style quests for every class in the game (including <br/>
paladins).  The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model <br/>
with unique particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to everyone on your quest.<br/>
<br/>
*Class Issues*<br/>
<br/>
Rangers:<br/>
<br/>
Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills <br/>
for all melee-centric classes.  In the course of these tests we <br/>
determined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended <br/>
level, and have made the following changes:<br/>
<br/>
- The &quot;Jolt&quot; spell has had its casting time reduced.<br/>
- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<br/>
<br/>
Monks:<br/>
<br/>
High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty.  The <br/>
additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<br/>
<br/>
Cleric:<br/>
<br/>
Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that <br/>
are incompatible with that configuration.  We have therefore removed <br/>
the cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<br/>
<br/>
After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark <br/>
of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell&#39;s <br/>
current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less <br/>
desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its <br/>
duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; <br/>
value decreased.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Fungal Regrowth*<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fungal Regrowth&quot; is now a self-only spell.  It was being used as an <br/>
offensive spell by virtue of its &quot;snare&quot; effect upon the target.  <br/>
Furthermore, we ruled out making it &quot;group only&quot; as with other spells <br/>
that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern.  The spell was <br/>
reducing the group&#39;s desire for classes capable of casting <br/>
regenerative magic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Attack Speed Buffs*<br/>
<br/>
In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any &quot;Haste&quot; item <br/>
combined with any &quot;Haste&quot; spell to automatically yield maximum haste, <br/>
regardless of the level of &quot;Haste&quot; granted by each individual <br/>
component.  This fix increases the usefulness of better &quot;Haste&quot; <br/>
equipment and spells.  The downside to this is that those who usually <br/>
have both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed <br/>
unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*<br/>
<br/>
Veehshan&#39;s Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order <br/>
to address disparities in risk and reward.  For the most part, the <br/>
quality of the &quot;common&quot; loot in Veeshan&#39;s Peak is at least as good as <br/>
the &quot;rares&quot; from Sebilis.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*<br/>
<br/>
In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay <br/>
weapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand.  Included in this <br/>
change are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip.  The delay <br/>
on these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the <br/>
primary hand made these weapons much too powerful for their <br/>
availability and the risk associated with their acquisition.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus <br/>
modified.  The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or <br/>
below) created a problem similar to the weapons above and has been <br/>
reduced. The damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) <br/>
two-handed weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed <br/>
weapons (40+) has been increased.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Server Selection Screen*<br/>
<br/>
It has come to our attention that new players often think that the <br/>
high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if <br/>
everyone else is there, it must be a good server.  However, in <br/>
Massively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often <br/>
considered superior for gameplay.  Therefore we have marked servers <br/>
that would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing <br/>
them in &quot;green&quot; in the server selection window.  The preferred <br/>
servers have populations such that an influx of new people would <br/>
benefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Custom Emotes and AFK*<br/>
<br/>
Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned <br/>
emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to <br/>
be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type &quot;/point <br/>
Baobob&quot;, the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom <br/>
text to the emote, but you must specify the target as &quot;say&quot; as the <br/>
target. For instance: <br/>
<br/>
/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it. <br/>
<br/>
...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text <br/>
output will be: &quot;CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he <br/>
is ready to kill it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK.  <br/>
Type &quot;/AFK &lt;message&gt;&quot; (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK <br/>
message.  For instance, if you type &quot;/afk Grabbing a snack&quot;, you will <br/>
reply with &quot;Grabbing a snack&quot; when someone sends you a /tell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Skill Gain*<br/>
<br/>
The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by <br/>
character stats.  This will allow those with natural affinities <br/>
towards certain skills to improve at a greater rate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Trade Skills Enhanced*<br/>
<br/>
Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, <br/>
including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging <br/>
items, and other things to be discovered once in game.  <br/>
<br/>
In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented.  <br/>
Players will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the <br/>
generally available tradeskills. This includes: <br/>
<br/>
- Baking<br/>
- Blacksmithing<br/>
- Brewing<br/>
- Jewelcraft<br/>
- Tailoring<br/>
- Fletching<br/>
- Pottery <br/>
<br/>
Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be <br/>
able to exceed 200.  Specialization restrictions do not include class <br/>
or race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and <br/>
Tinkering.  Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be <br/>
able to exceed 200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally <br/>
available trade skill. <br/>
<br/>
The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project.  Further <br/>
enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.<br/>
