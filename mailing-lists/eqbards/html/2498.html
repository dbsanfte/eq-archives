<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334020672">My friends and I played around abit with Disenchantment (L22)<br/>
and couldn&#39;t figure out exactly what it does.  I thought it<br/>
was a straight cancel magic song, identical to the<br/>
spellcasters&#39; cancel magic spells.  But it only works on party<br/>
members (i.e. you can&#39;t use it to take down a mob&#39;s buffs),<br/>
and it doesn&#39;t take down your party&#39;s buffs like cancel magic<br/>
does.<br/>
<br/>
Am I right in thinking this song is what all the spellcasters<br/>
have been asking cancel magic be changed to do - remove just<br/>
the bad spell effects from your party members?  So if you&#39;re<br/>
fighting a mob which charms or tosses lots of nasty DoT spells<br/>
on your party, you can play this song and wipe out those bad<br/>
effects?  Does this break root underground?  Btw, this song<br/>
requires that you equip a stringed instrument.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of charm, I&#39;ve been investigating uses for the<br/>
L27 song (Sirens - basically charm).  With the other classes,<br/>
the charm duration is influenced by the caster&#39;s charisma.  Is<br/>
that the case for bards as well, or is the charm limited to 3<br/>
&quot;ticks&quot; like most of our other songs?<br/>
<br/>
Creative uses I&#39;ve learned so far:<br/>
<br/>
Thwarting kill stealers (or more usually, named mob nukers at<br/>
camps).  Charm the mob.  The nukers will usually waste all<br/>
their mana trying to kill your pet, which isn&#39;t allowed on the<br/>
non-PvP servers.  They lose the mana, but your pet takes no<br/>
damage.  When your charm wears off, kill the named one.  With<br/>
a bit of creative zoning/hiding/invising, you can use this to<br/>
get the mob to attack the kill stealer after they&#39;ve dumped<br/>
all their mana.<br/>
<br/>
Killing pets.  Several mobs have summoned pets that you have<br/>
to fight after you&#39;ve killed their master.  Charm the pet (so<br/>
that it becomes your pet), then hide or invis yourself.  The<br/>
pet will kill itself because it can no longer see its master.<br/>
<br/>
Dueling.  Charm your opponent.  Send him off to waste his<br/>
mana/hp fighting monsters nearby while you kick back and sip a<br/>
soda.  You can order him to attack a guard, but I&#39;ve heard<br/>
some of the humanoid NPCs are smart enough to recognize a pet<br/>
and will attack the master before the pet.<br/>
<br/>
Just hit L24 today.  Only two more levels until I get into<br/>
what on paper appear to me to be the most &quot;fun&quot; songs in our<br/>
repertoire for mob manipulation - Screech (L26), Sirens (L27),<br/>
and Pixie Chase (L28).<br/>
