Mistmoore should also give reasonable exp at your level from what I<br/>
hear. Permafrost as well. Unfortunately all these areas need a _good_<br/>
party to play with. I&#39;d say your chances of finding a good cleric to<br/>
work with would be best in Unrest.<br/>

Oh, and the aviak village might be another possibility. It looks like<br/>
the some of the mobs there should still give exp at 24.<br/>
