<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005188216">Good advice. Sylly just described my entire evening last night! :) Putting<br/>
theory into practice, I used techniques learned from this mailing list and<br/>
the boards and came up with gold. (You can, too, if you send $74.95 and a<br/>
self-addressed, stamped envelope, to the League of Antonican Bards)<br/>
<br/>
Firing up my shiny new Purifying Rhythms, I meleed Darkweed Snakes in E<br/>
Commons (average 5gp loot per kill - not bad for a 13 bard). Am I sick to<br/>
take satisfaction in killing them with their own fangs? Though I resisted<br/>
the venom often, I eventually resigned myself to learning a new skill for<br/>
the evening: Poison Tolerance.<br/>
<br/>
Also my first All Music Attack night. I killed wisps with CoD and Bellow,<br/>
twisting in Hymn (no magic weapon yet). I found that I was actually gaining<br/>
health during the fight, even while still poisoned. People would stop to<br/>
watch, curious why this goofy half-elf was taking those hits and not even<br/>
swinging back.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, my first true Kite night. It was late and I was a sliver from<br/>
leveling so took some reckless chances. After another Darkweed, and another<br/>
poison, I saw a high-blue Young Kodiak and rushed in. The bear (I think it<br/>
was a monk in a former life) got in so many critical-size hits that I was<br/>
forced to flee at 1.5 bubbles, pesky poison still in my veins. I blended<br/>
Selo&#39;s and Hymn while I ran from Mr. Bear in disgrace. The poison finally<br/>
ran its course. Suddenly it came to me. Why should I give up this juicy<br/>
kill? He was half HP and I had a longer range kick than the Mauling Monk. I<br/>
switched to an outer view and confirmed that he indeed wanted one last<br/>
morsel (me) before hibernating. Twisting Selo&#39;s and two Bellows, I stayed<br/>
ahead of him and whittled away for 2 minutes. He finally turned to limp away<br/>
and I just stood there, bellowing and bellowing. I walked up to him and,<br/>
with one fateful timely punch, slew the beast that had threatened my<br/>
death-free night. I was rewarded with a cathartic DING! Welcome to level 14.<br/>
You cannot believe how satisfying that was!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the experts on this list. Success is easy when you stand on the<br/>
shoulders of those who have gone before.<br/>

&gt; Greetings! And Welcome!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The best thing to do is get a &quot;regular group&quot; - find a group that will<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; the same days, hours and times - then you can learn together instead of<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; having to teach the group every time.  Other than that - there are many<br/>
&gt; morons out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How are you trying to solo? Toe to toe melee?  If yes, you need to change<br/>
&gt; your tactics.  Bards have low HP compared to true tanks and mobs are<br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; stronger while you stay about the same (ok you get more hp each level but<br/>
&gt; the mobs get more).  Use tatics where you damage them but prevent them<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; damageing you.  Hit and run - stay just far enough away that you can<br/>
damage<br/>
&gt; them but they cant get you.  Use magic songs for damage - Chords, Denon&#39;s<br/>
&<br/>
&gt; Bellow.  And do not be in a hurry - it takes longer and you need to learn<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; out side.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You would be better off to have a same-level partner and the 2 of you kill<br/>
&gt; more mobs with less downtime.  From 15 thru 25 - most other classes get<br/>
&gt; arrogant and ignore the need and value of partys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Get a better weapon - soon you will have dual wield.  The whip is ok but<br/>
&gt; there is better - Dragoon Dirk or Combine Longsword.  I used a giant snake<br/>
&gt; fang and mino axe along with my combine long sword for a long time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You lose hp when monster hits you - don&#39;t let him get close enough to hit<br/>
&gt; you - as much. Hit him, run, hit him , run.  Use songs to hit him!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

&gt; Hi all<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I play EQ I allways get asked to play the Jig to increase mana<br/>
&gt; regeneration. I was asked this for 4 times today and I really hate<br/>
&gt; it. I<br/>
&gt; even got kicked from a group when I refused to play it because the<br/>
&gt; mana is<br/>
&gt; not regenerating faster. Can anyone recommend me what to do?<br/>
&gt; I have one more problem. I&#39;m lvl 15 at the moment and I can hardly<br/>
&gt; ever solo<br/>
&gt; a blue creature. I&#39;m wearing full banded armor, and I have my 1H<br/>
&gt; slash<br/>
&gt; allways maxed. I&#39;m using tentacle whip as a weapon, no it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; twinked I<br/>
&gt; got it as in a bet when someone didn&#39;t beleive me that selo&#39;s is<br/>
&gt; faster than<br/>
&gt; sow. And I just bought the armor. Can anyone please tell me why<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t I solo<br/>
&gt; a blue creature without loosing 90-95% of my health.<br/>
