&gt; &gt;i wouldn&#39;t blame verant for this.  blame your greedy fellow players.<br/>

&gt;So if someone should happen to steal my car because someone else stole<br/>
&gt;theirs I should blame the original thief and not the one who actually stole<br/>
&gt;my car?  What kind of f&#39;d up logic is that?  The wrongful actions of one<br/>
&gt;party do not excuse the wrongful actions of a second party in any case<br/>
&gt;unless you are claiming Verant suffered from extreme emotional distress and<br/>
&gt;was unable to act coherently.  Not that I&#39;d doubt that to be true all that<br/>
&gt;much.  Their typical responses do seem to show an extreme lack of maturity.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>what?  how does the stealing a car analogy have anything to do with this?  the<br/>
actions of these players caused a need for a rollback, which due to other circumstances<br/>
(kunark beta characters) was not possible.  therefore a player wipe was done.</div>
