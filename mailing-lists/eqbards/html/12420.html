&gt; &gt; Hehe - the DoT from Fufils - is minimal at best.  To me the MR debuff from<br/>
&gt; &gt; it was what attracted me to its use - we were fighting stuff that had high<br/>
&gt; &gt; resist rates - ie my bellows were getting resisted so I figured other<br/>
&gt; &gt; caster(s) were facing same problem and maybe my de-buff MR would help. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s what I thought at first too.  The DoT by my estimate at<br/>
&gt; L40 did 15-18 points per tick against mobs, or 45-54 points<br/>
&gt; damage per application.  Much better than Bellow, and<br/>
&gt; (assuming I&#39;m reapplying the song every 10 seconds as part of<br/>
&gt; a three-some) equals a good fraction of my damage with<br/>
&gt; weapons.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might want to check that again. At least when I tried it, prepatch<br/>
(the one that was supposed to make the songs do more damage but didn&#39;t)<br/>
it did 15 dmg in 2 tics. After said patch, it did 10 dmg for 3 tics.<br/>
That was when I was L45, IIR.<br/>
