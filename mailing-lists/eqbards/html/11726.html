<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234910158">There isn&#39;t a bard guild like the Soerbaird (Fennin Ro) on E&#39;ci.  There are<br/>
several E&#39;ci bards who post a lot on this list.  Off the top of my head,<br/>
Faras or Aloro are the highest level and they are in their mid-30s.  Don&#39;t<br/>
know if any of the high level bards on E&#39;ci subscribe to this list.  If they<br/>
do, they don&#39;t ever post.  Of the regular posters, here is the guild<br/>
affiliation of the ones I remember:<br/>
<br/>
Galtin: Mystical Alliance<br/>
Laluni: Mystical Alliance<br/>
Faras:  Crimson Legacy<br/>
Kitasi: Armigers of Mirth<br/>
Aloro:  Flying Brethren <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak for the other guilds, but there are at least four bards in the<br/>
Mystical Alliance that are of similar level to you.  Send me a private note<br/>
if you want more info.<br/>
<br/>
If there are other E&#39;ci bards on this list that I have left out, please send<br/>
me your name and guild info as well.  I plan on trying to organize guild<br/>
events over the Christmas holidays in Mistmoore and Lower Guk to help all<br/>
the bards in my guild get the lambent armor components.  If you and other<br/>
members of your guild would like to help out it would be appreciated.  I&#39;ll<br/>
post more details later on.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Greetings, my experienced colleagues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; _Rhimshot bows_<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am Rhimshot, a bard of but the 17th song.  None come before me in my<br/>
&gt; family, so no generational gifts aided me in life.  I am finding it harder<br/>
&gt; and harder to defeat creatures that should be defeatable by myself.<br/>
&gt; However, I had the chance to join 2 of my fellow bards in Highhold pass<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; had a wonderful time.  I would love to have the opportunity to travel with<br/>
&gt; my fellow bards again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thus, I turn to you for guidance and support.  Is there a guild for bards<br/>
&gt; on the planet of E&#39;ci?  Or a good guild which is heavily populated with<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; singing folk?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for your help,<br/>
&gt; Rhimshot<br/>
&gt; E&#39;ci bard of the 17th song<br/>
