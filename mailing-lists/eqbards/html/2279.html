<div id="ygrps-yiv-166493788">If you want to take a time for a small boat trip, head to Feydwar. Head off to Greater Feydark and get yourself into Crushbone. Kill anything that moves except some of the larger folk running around (See one of my earlier posts to this list for a good spoiler about this area). You&#39;ll need to make several runs to Kelethin, as you can easily become overburdened. Centurions are probably your best target of choice around here. Sometimes they have weapons, and sometimes they have cloth armor (I much prefer the cloth armor for loot....)<br/>

  Hail and well met again,<br/>
      <br/>
      I am requesting the assistance of some of you yet again.  Tonight I finally made the 11th rank.  We were in W. Commons killing the Derv&#39;s when lo and behold a werewolf arrived and decimated all but 2 of us, myself and a ranger friend.  Upon zoning to E. Commons and then returning to the Bard&#39;s guild, I came to the realization that I needed &quot;real&quot; armor.  Up to this point, I have been wearing all leather.  It is affordable and light but is not as effective against the Derv&#39;s and such.  I NEED BANDED!!!<br/>
      And now on to my problem, where do I pick up the plat to buy this wonderful armor?  I seem to only make around 5 pp a night at best.  Would joining a guild help me in this situation?  If so does anyone no any good guilds on Erollisi Marr?  I&#39;ve taken to fighting darkweeds but there is far too much downtime.  The orc cents in my area have very little loot, so soloing in this area is pretty worthless.  The derv&#39;s have lovely loot, but I am afraid of grouping with people I don&#39;t know.  Especially in a zone like W. Commons.  Tonight they actually attacked the werewolf!!<br/>
  Yesterday someone in my group decided, despite my warnings, to walk up and slap Lord Shin Ree.  What should I do?<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you in advance for your advice,<br/>
