about level 8.  I was grouped with a level 10 bard and with me<br/>
tossing a couple heals his way, he could easily defeat a red<br/>
orc oracle.  At low levels the casting mobs don&#39;t have many hp<br/>
and are pretty easy to kill before they can do much damage.<br/>
<br/>
This changes at higher levels.  Drastically.  The casting<br/>
bandits you&#39;ve run into are the tip of the iceberg.  If you<br/>
run into one I&#39;d imagine they&#39;re not much of a problem.  You<br/>
know that if you run into two, you can die pretty quick,<br/>
right?<br/>

From about 15-20, casting desert madmen can drop you 3-4<br/>
bubbles in just two spells, even the green ones.  The goblin<br/>
evokers in Permafrost like to cast area effect spells that<br/>
usually wiped out about a bubble from each party member.  And<br/>
last night in Cazic, a yellow judicator was casting wrath on<br/>
me that was wiping out about a bubble and a quarter, even<br/>
though I had both bravery and symbol (nearly +200 hp in<br/>
buffs).  If I were soloing him, it would take a good 2-3<br/>
minutes to whittle him down.  Meanwhile he&#39;s casting wrath on<br/>
me every 5-10 seconds.  A couple days prior, I screwed up on a<br/>
pull and got two justicars, and they killed me with 4 spells.  <br/>
I barely had time to tell the others to zone and kick in<br/>
