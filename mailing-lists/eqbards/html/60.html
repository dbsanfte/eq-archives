<div id="ygrps-yiv-675511970">Ah the lute quest, possibly one of the best quests in the game. You can<br/>
seemingly do this an inifinte number of times, as one time when I was 3<br/>
plat short of buying a needed item I just went and did this quest by<br/>
going from store to store buying up every spiderling silk possible. I&#39;ve<br/>
done it atleast 30 times, so its a quest to keep in the back of your<br/>
mind. In other towns there are quests bards can do, and if you hunt<br/>
enough orcs/&quot;give&quot; stuff to other guildmasters they will give you<br/>
quests, though none of them are as good as the bard one.<br/>

&gt; Greetings all, I am the wood-elf Kendrin, bard of the 4th rank, in Kelethin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a question regarding the quest given by Sylia Windlehands -- how<br/>
&gt; many times can you do it?  Every time I talk to her (hoping to get another<br/>
&gt; quest) she asks me for the spiderling silks.  Having done this quest 3 or 4<br/>
&gt; times, I can only ask -- how many lutes do they have there that need strings?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are there other quests in Kelethin that a bard can do, aside from offering<br/>
&gt; to locate people&#39;s corpses for them?<br/>
