&gt; Still don&#39;t agree with it though.  I think Abashi totally missed the point<br/>
&gt; in regards to his casual gamer comment.  I have no problem with the fact<br/>
&gt; that people who have more time to play than me will level faster and have<br/>
&gt; time to camp for good items.  Abashi stated they should get rewarded (i.e.<br/>
&gt; really nice items) for the time they invest.  Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I have yet another point to make...  For each level 50 who plays an average of 12 hours a day (who<br/>
pays Verant 10 bucks a month) there are, what, 10 players who play an average of 2 hours a day (who pay<br/>
Verant a total of 100 bucks a month)?  It is appropriate to reward high-level players, but I see no reason<br/>
whatsoever why they should be rewarded disproportionately.  I pay these guys just as much as my guild<br/>
brother who has two level 50s and a level 38 (that I know of, he may have more).  It would be nice if,<br/>
when I get to an area that he was previously able to rape for tons of nice stuff, if:  a) it is not so<br/>
overcamped by hordes of higher-level people that I am never able to get an item or b) I can at least<br/>
*live* if I fight there.  Verant&#39;s bread is buttered by the casual gamer, and they really need to<br/>
understand that part of the equation.  If every level 50 in the game quit in disgust tomorrow, it still<br/>
would not bring the server high-load average down to their stated 1500 maximum...<br/>
