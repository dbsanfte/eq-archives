immune to the Jedi mind trick...<br/>

Well, at least at our running speed, a trip to Freeport and<br/>
back is shorter than a trip to Murissa and back for other<br/>
classes...<br/>

I tried it on the Erudite merchant behind the orc Ortallis in<br/>
South Ro.  No change with him as well (which is bad since<br/>
AFAIK he is the closest &quot;good&quot; merchant to Guk and generally<br/>
gives really really bad prices).  Same with the gypsies<br/>
(although they already give me the best prices).<br/>
