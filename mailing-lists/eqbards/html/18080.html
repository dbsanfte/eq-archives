<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700949118">tonight i found out that no longer will bards in our guild be allowed on<br/>
lotto for haste items, ever. (unless it&#39;s bard-only)<br/>
<br/>
2 cloak of flames dropped off nagafen last time (i wasn&#39;t there or i<br/>
would&#39;ve known about this sooner) and bards were excluded in the lotto.  no<br/>
more runed bolster belts will be going to bards either.  (fbss only likely<br/>
one now, and only then if no other guild members that need it are in group<br/>
according to guild rules)<br/>
<br/>
i need some pursuasive arguments to back me up. this is a guild of 150+<br/>
different players.  (tho minus a few bards lately)<br/>
<br/>
i tried a few arguments mentioned on this list, but the leaders of the guild<br/>
are pretty sure that since bards have haste songs, they don&#39;t need a haste<br/>
item. (even tho they stack)  being a huge guild, the leaders get whines and<br/>
rants all the time, so our chances of convincing them otherwise is very<br/>
slim.<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
This reply is very late in coming, and I apologize if the thread has been <br/>
closed or kabonged.  I haven&#39;t had much time the last week to read my Email, <br/>
and am just now getting to it.  However, this post stuck a chord with me (no <br/>
pun intended), and I felt it necessary to reply:<br/>
<br/>
Under no circumstances would I remain in a guild that treated me in such a <br/>
manner.  If I was present to help kill the critter that dropped an item I <br/>
could use, I would expect to be included in the lottery if I didnt already <br/>
have the item, or one better.<br/>
<br/>
This treatment of bards is ridiculous, and I believe that this type of <br/>
thinking needs to be quashed now before it spreads to other guilds and <br/>
servers.  Its bad enough we often get the back-hand treatment from Verant, <br/>
but should we allow our guilds/friends to treat us in the same manner?<br/>
