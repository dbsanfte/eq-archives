<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933678399"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;After this incident, I am on a quest to gather as much charisma equipment<br/>
&gt;as possible.  There are very few items we can wear that increase charisma<br/>
&gt;in some slots (belt, back, shoulders, next to if not nothing).  The<br/>
&gt;dexterity items that are available are excruciatingly rare drops, dragon<br/>
&gt;drops, or plane stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Give muffins to Guard Wenbly in Qeynos. He gives you a waist piece with +1<br/>
charisma<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This period will pass.  If you bear with it, and suffer the weight, maybe<br/>
&gt;pick up a few +3str gold amber earrings or whatever the rings are for the<br/>
&gt;interim, a bloodstained mantle, studded collar (the +3 one, whatever that<br/>
&gt;was, maybe spiked), in the long run you&#39;ll be much happier having boosted<br/>
&gt;your other attributes instead of strength.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spiked collar off of elite gnolls in Blackburrow<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So where might I find a Siryn Hair Hood?  EQlizer mentioned &quot;rare spawn in<br/>
&gt;Rathe Mountains,&quot; but no name was given.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was given one of these to my enchanter on another server. But have not<br/>
been<br/>
able to find out where it came from. Charisma +13 though. Yum!</div>
