<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-539600714">biggest problem was no one else in the group would acknowledge it was a bad<br/>
pull until after I died.  In fact on several occasions the group said<br/>
afterwards, &quot;It wasn&#39;t that bad a pull, only one person died.&quot;  I did stop<br/>
singing several times, but this was all before they lowered our taunt<br/>
factor.  Back then once something got on me it was nigh on impossible to<br/>
taunt it off.  I never did the chicken ranch.  Might have been possible to<br/>
solo there, I have heard that aviaks are particularly weak for their con.<br/>

well, the only way every mistake ended up with 1 dead bard is if that bard<br/>
either<br/>
wasn&#39;t paying attention to the individual situation or didn&#39;t know how to<br/>
adapt to<br/>
the situation.  just as one example, what did you do when there was a bad<br/>
pull?<br/>
i would break out weapons and just bellow at my current level of 21.  at 23,<br/>
i might<br/>
twist bellow and chains.  another thing that is important is knowing when to<br/>
run for<br/>
the zone and to just do it once the call goes out.  in the 18-21 level range<br/>
you should<br/>
be able to tank some on single pulls even with bronze armor.  if there is a<br/>
3 or 4 mob<br/>
pull and the only tank goes ld, then just call out for everyone to zone and<br/>
go.<br/>
