I DO NOT CONDONE THESE TACTICS (sorry Harm), but knowing how the pathing<br/>
works in any zone is very important to being successful there, the Archon<br/>
Temple top is no exception.  The Archon Temple is fun to hold and great<br/>
experience when held in a sportsmanlike fashion, however, I am only human<br/>
and have used these pieces of information to save my cute bardic ass a few<br/>
times when I&#39;ve gotten into a jam.<br/>

The Archon Temple is very buggy pathwise.  There are two primary ways in<br/>
which groups exploit this:<br/>
<br/>
1) A puller is SoWed and (with or without levitation) runs down the tiers<br/>
and away from the Archon&#39;s steps to pull.  He punches a lizard in the nose<br/>
and runs back to the group at the base of the steps.  Generally speaking<br/>
that lizard hasn&#39;t followed him back, it is somewhere away from the Archon<br/>
steps, aggrod and &quot;frozen&quot;.  Quite often groups will curse the bad pathing<br/>
and run to the lizard to defeat it (nothing wrong with that).  However, if<br/>
the puller stands *on the steps* themselves at the Archon Temple top, the<br/>
lizard will unfreeze and run to the puller at the steps.  To be perfectly<br/>
clear: You MUST stand upon the steps for the mobs to come to you.<br/>
Therefore, the puller&#39;s presence on the steps becomes something of an on/off<br/>
switch for mob activity and movement.  The exploit part of this occurs once<br/>
these lizards have come to the puller at the steps.  If the puller to whom<br/>
the lizards are aggrod removes himself from the steps they will once again<br/>
&quot;freeze&quot; due to the pathing bug.  The group can now fire at will with little<br/>
chance of the lizards leaving the steps to actively engaging them in melee.<br/>
Other melee members of the party can sometimes melee the lizard on the steps<br/>
in safety - it&#39;s as though the hate list of these buggy lizards doesn&#39;t<br/>
reorganize itself.  Regardless of the damage others do to them, the lizards<br/>
remain aggrod on the first guy that bonked them on the head.  If the lizards<br/>
*do* engage in melee, the entire party can move away from the steps to the<br/>
first 90 degree corner (either seems to work) and the lizards have another<br/>
very good chance of freezing when the party reaches the corner.  A group<br/>
that knows how to work the pathing of the lizards up there can have a *very*<br/>
safe time of taking out lizzies.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in groups that had the puller deliberately go out and smack as<br/>
many lizzies as possible to create a 12 liz train to the Archon.  Once<br/>
there, the puller stands on the steps and takes a bit of abuse while all the<br/>
lizards catch up.  Then the puller does his best to arrange the lizards into<br/>
as closely knit a group as possible on the steps, then jumps from the steps<br/>
freezing them all in place.  Wizards and Mages then AE the whole bundle down<br/>
at their leisure.  I quickly departed these groups because this is BORING as<br/>
hell, and actually not any faster (I&#39;d argue slower) than a good<br/>
old-fashioned fight or three.  The only reason I was invited was as a mana<br/>
pump for the casters.  Basically I was to stand around watching and playing<br/>
Clarity continuously.  Forget it - the Throne Room is more fun and better<br/>
potential loot in that case.<br/>
<br/>
2) Mobs that are aggrod to a party cannot reach the actual flat top of the<br/>
temple.  If (when) trains of lizards occur, simply run up the sloped walls<br/>
of the Archon&#39;s Temple and you will be both out of melee range and out of<br/>
spell range.  The mobs will remain aggrod on you, but will mill around on<br/>
the Archon steps.  Casters can cast on the lizards from here in relative<br/>
safety (this is an confirmed exploit by Verant, you can get BANNED if caught<br/>
doing this).  Large races will either need a levitation (maybe a shrink<br/>
would work too) or old Guise of the Deceiver in order for them to reach the<br/>
top.  If the situation with the lizards gets unmanageable, simply camp out<br/>
up here and come back to clear their aggro lists.  All members of your party<br/>
must camp for this to work.  I have camped overnight on the top here many<br/>
times.  Lizards simply cannot get up here, and the two or three times that<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it they 32k (suicide) themselves.  I have *never* heard that<br/>
running to the top to escape lizards is an exploit, only that casting from<br/>
here is.<br/>
<br/>
Use your knowledge wisely.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what you are saying is that because pathing is screwed up at the top of<br/>
&gt; the temple, mobs standing on the steps will not move down to the bottom of<br/>
&gt; the steps and attack anyone standing there?  That may explain why I rarely<br/>
&gt; got attacked.  I was standing at the bottom of the steps along with the<br/>
&gt; cleric and enchanter.  The other three characters were on the steps<br/>
&gt; meleeing. </span></blockquote></div>
