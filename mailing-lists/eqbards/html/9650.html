<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573024938"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;This happened to a friend, and learned how mobs end up trapped<br/>
&gt;below the world.  He ran for the zone.  The mobs chased<br/>
&gt;him.  The path to the zone is twisty.  The mobs ran straight<br/>
&gt;for him.  The mobs don&#39;t care about the height of obstacles<br/>
&gt;(they will walk right over trees and mesas and buildings<br/>
&gt;regardless of whether or not a player could).  They walked<br/>
&gt;right over the wall, and presumably fell below the<br/>
&gt;world.  Neither the wolf nor the rest of the train came back<br/>
&gt;from the zone, except my original pull which teleported to me<br/>
&gt;like mobs do when they get stuck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my limited travels - I&#39;ve found 2 places like this.<br/>
<br/>
My poor little Ogre warrior which shall probably never see lvl 10 - runs<br/>
for the landing at Guk whenever one of those nasty human type NPCs decides<br/>
to start wacking at her - without fail, they run up the side and disappear.<br/>
<br/>
Last night in Oasis - at the south end of the beach was something stranger.<br/>
Was pulling from the South camp - down to the water - if the mob ran North<br/>
up the beach, they just poofed!  No zone there, no nothing.  Do do do do,<br/>
do do do do - it was like the twilight zone - and after awhile started to<br/>
get irritating.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere there must be a room just choked full o&#39;orcs.</div>
