├ì have a gravis gamepad pro USB (and might have mentioned it here) and it works<br/>
fine, I think what you do wrong is that you have tied it to: &quot;everquest.exe&quot; You<br/>
should tie it to &quot;eqgame.exe&quot;. Another option (and what I do) is just to use the<br/>
setup for &quot;all other games&quot; and delete the one you have tied to everquest.exe, I<br/>
hardly play anything but EQ and when I do I just make a specific gameset to that<br/>
game. I do it this way because of two things:<br/>
1. Most other games can you ALT+TAB out of or start/end quickly, so its easy to<br/>
experiment with attaching the gamesets to different .exe files until you find<br/>
the correct one.<br/>
2. I can test the combos in notepad before starting up EQ (Its easy to make a<br/>
ENTER, misspell etc)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly I found it nessesary to insert short delays between some of my commands.<br/>
Its no problem since you can do custom key sequences (Where you specify<br/>
everything, like mousbutton down, delay(100) , mousebutton up) by holding down<br/>
ctrl and pressing the mouse when opening a keypad button for editing...Atleast I<br/>
think you open the custom menu this way, but anyways its noted in the help or<br/>
readme files.<br/>

Hope this helps, if not youre welcome to email me on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hholms@...">hholms@...</a><br/>

From time to time we get onto a hardware topic; my turn ;).  Sylly, I have heard<br/>
you<br/>
say you use a gamepad yes?<br/>
<br/>
I bought a Gravis GamePad Pro USB and it just won&#39;t work.  I downloaded the<br/>
latest<br/>
driver from Gravis.  I bound it to EQ and defined keys but nothing happens.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  Thanks =).<br/>
