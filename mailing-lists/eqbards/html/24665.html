<b>Subject:</b> RE: Guild Loot Rules <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-699846126">Venator Sapentia is currently discussing loot rules. Inside the guild, I<br/>
think the system is mainly who needs (doesn&#39;t have something as good or<br/>
better), then who can or will use, and if none of those 2 apply, it gets<br/>
open lottoed. I personally won&#39;t put in on a lotto unless it is something I<br/>
will actively use. The reason we&#39;re discussing loot rules is we do alot of<br/>
raids with other guilds and there has been some discussion between the<br/>
guilds about how it&#39;s done. I think the issue is more about folks walking in<br/>
5 minutes before the God mob dies and winning lottos. Being loot happy does<br/>
count against you in VS and Excalibur. Both those guilds will quickly point<br/>
you to the Xegony guild that is famous for that.<br/>
As to Bards, we were leaving CoM a few weeks ago and a couple of guilds were<br/>
doing some lottos of dragon drops in EJ. They were using shout/ooc. The<br/>
leader made a statement that bards were ineligible for haste items. I<br/>
mentioned something about &#39;remind me never to help that guild do anything&#39;<br/>
to my cleric. He was really incensed that anyone would exclude a bard on a<br/>
haste item. His comment to the zone was along the lines of never piss off<br/>
your bards since you depend on them for so many things. I myself have a sash<br/>
of Dragonborne. I got it by default in HS by being the only melee in the<br/>
group that didn&#39;t have a similar item. The group didn&#39;t bother to lotto it,<br/>
just told me to pick it up. We also hand stuff around. My cleric has lottoed<br/>
for anf won 2 shields off dragons. The second one he liked better and gave<br/>
his first one to our shaman friend. He won a scale for the green BP from<br/>
Wooshi. When he got his Donal&#39;s bp shortly after, the green BP went to the<br/>
shaman also.<br/>
My luck is so good at lottoing, I even won the &#39;who gets to be the key<br/>
corpse&#39; lotto last night! Took the enchanter forever to kill me!<br/>
