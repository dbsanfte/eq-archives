<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122098499">All the justicars/judicators/pages/probationist etc lizards are clerics. <br/>
They tend to smite, wrath, and greater heal. The newer lizzies (added for <br/>
the quest armor patch) are the crusaders and silvered guards. The crusaders <br/>
are SK&#39;s with a nasty HT, not sure if they use any other SK spells on you. <br/>
My necro buddy got charmed yesterday by the tae liz that&#39;s off to the side <br/>
in lower tae (not the one on the chair). I guess they are enchanters? Didn&#39;t <br/>
know that.<br/>
<br/>
So anyways, the only lizzies in cazic that could possibly see invis are the <br/>
tae(if they are enchanters) and the crusaders if they for some reason <br/>
decided to use deadeye. The rest of the casters are clerics and could care <br/>
less if you walked by invis (I walked all the way to the archon ziggurat, <br/>
fell down into the AoF chamber, and walked out while camo with my 30th druid <br/>
last night. I think I passed a dozen zealots/fanatics and a ton of <br/>
defenders, sentinels, and gators - not to mention that stupid lizzie <br/>
Radiant. =)<br/>

&gt;The first time I walked all the way from the zone to 4C in Cazic I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;attacked.  I conned everything along the way and everything was <br/>
&gt;indifferent.<br/>
&gt;Next time I walked thru I assumed I was safe and didn&#39;t con any lizards as <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;moved.  I walked by a lizard in the maze and got attacked.  The best<br/>
&gt;explanation I have to why it saw thru the invis was that the lizard had the<br/>
&gt;see invis spell buff.  I don&#39;t know if lizard spellcasters can actually <br/>
&gt;cast<br/>
&gt;this spell but if they can that would easily explain it.  If they can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;cast<br/>
&gt;see invis then I have no idea what happened.<br/>
