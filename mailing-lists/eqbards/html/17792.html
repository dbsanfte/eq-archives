<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956012689">Hmm, Kelethin is where we go to buy pumice stones in between resses.  One<br/>
night there were like 4 of us nekkid level 50&#39;s stumbling around Kele trying<br/>
to find the vendor.  I think he is either right by the bank or right by the<br/>
warriors guild which is by the bank (one platform over?) or was it the<br/>
bard&#39;s guild.... hmmm.  Well, you can see why I hire a newbie to guide me<br/>
around Kele.  But there is a merch somewhere near the Preist of Dischord<br/>
lift plats that sells these items  - they look like light stones (egg shaped<br/>
pumice) or bottles (potions.)<br/>

&gt; I hope this isn&#39;t a stupid question but since I&#39;ve had no need up until<br/>
&gt; now....where would the local magic shop be in the GF/BB area?<br/>
