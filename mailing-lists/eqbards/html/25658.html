  I believe you are right on as for how &quot;bane&quot; damage works (vs. undead, <br/>
vs. grimlings, etc.).  Verant has also commented that we should see more <br/>
and more of these as time goes on.<br/>
   vs resist damage, on the other hand, is treated differently.  The bonus <br/>
value is calculated as an increased DMG stat on the weapon, except that the <br/>
elemental portion is run through the resistance system before calculating <br/>
the strength of your hit. I believe the way that this would work is if you <br/>
had a 10/30 +4 fire sword, it would be treated like a 14/30, but the 4 (and <br/>
associated bonuses) would be given a chance to resist, so, depending on <br/>
resistance checks, the weapon would do anywhere from 10-14 / 30.<br/>
