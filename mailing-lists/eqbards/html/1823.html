<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-43045415">J.M. Capozzi,<br/>
  First off, thanks very much for the information you have posted<br/>
here about Bards.  It is very reassuring to know someone in the know<br/>
is reading this board and willing to respond to some of the questions<br/>
those playing Bards have been wondering about.<br/>
  With that in mind, I was hoping you might be able to comment on the<br/>
issue already being discussed here of Bards being public enemy #1 for<br/>
many many monsters, to the point that monsters will stop attacking<br/>
members of another group and jump a bard who wasn&#39;t doing anything to<br/>
the monsters or assisting at all the group that was beating on them. <br/>
This has been reported by several people, and any insight into this<br/>
would be apreciated.  For example... is this a bug... why would<br/>
monsters jump someone who hadn&#39;t touched them in any way when there<br/>
is alrady a group pounding on them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much for any information you find the time to share,<br/>
