<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190387149">That&#39;s because there is some sort of problem or &#39;feature&#39; that causes an<br/>
unreasonable number of hits for 1.  The number of hits for 1 damage<br/>
generally exceeds the sum of all the other hits for less than average damage<br/>
every time I have parsed a file.  Whether this is because a hit was totally<br/>
absorbed by armor and there is a minimum of 1 damage or some strange coding<br/>
I cannot tell.  I was totally flabbergasted the first time I laid out my<br/>
damages on a graph by number of occurrences per damage value and was sure I<br/>
was mistaken, but I redid the test three times and it stayed just as<br/>
unbalanced.  When was the last time anyone hit for 2 with a weapon with a<br/>
damage of 6 or more?  The last two logs files I parsed had over 150 hits for<br/>
1 each, but not a single hit for 2.  That&#39;s way bizarre in terms of<br/>
statistical likelihood unless there is some other force like a minimum<br/>
damage after armor in effect.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I woudln&#39;t be surprised if they coded it so<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the best weapon at a certain str/dex/sta was not the best<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon at a different str/dex/sta.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Interesting idea. Does anyone have any data? I&#39;m especially curious about<br/>
&gt; the effects of strength bonuses. If strength &quot;x&quot; gives &quot;y&quot; points of bonus<br/>
&gt; damage &quot;z&quot; percent of the time, regardless of weapon, then 2*dmg+1/delay<br/>
&gt; becomes (2*dmg+1+(x*z/100))/delay...<br/>
<br/>
Most of the data I&#39;ve seen on the effect of strength is that<br/>
it increases your max damage without changing your average by<br/>
a noticable amount.  That could be because of too small a<br/>
sample size, or because Verant coded it wrong.<br/>
