<div id="ygrps-yiv-86189367">Great Idea on the pulling message!  I am gonna implement this for myself<br/>
tonight.  How about:<br/>
<br/>
/g Charming %t -- do not waste your mana on it!<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/pause 30, /cast 1 (or the number spell where Charm is memmed)<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
/g There is a %t close by (while standing at the camp spot)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; That &quot;screen shiver&quot; was pretty wild, but it does seem that another press <br/>
&gt; of the hot key does start the whole sequence over again. However, for<br/>
&gt; pulls <br/>
&gt; and healing I love the %t command. Nothing was sweeter than our puller <br/>
&gt; saying &quot;/g inc %t&quot;, and having our enchanter say &quot;/g Mezzing %t&quot; and me <br/>
&gt; saying &quot;/g Healing %t&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I convinced my enchanter friend that these are very handy and he loves <br/>
&gt; them. The &quot;pause&quot; command didn&#39;t really work well for me with a caster,<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure that just needs to be refined.<br/>
