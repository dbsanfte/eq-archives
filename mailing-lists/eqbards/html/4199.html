&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not a fan of high level characters swooping in and stealing kills -<br/>
&gt;&gt; which seems to be what you are describing, but is there really any<br/>
&gt;&gt; difference between that and his lower level coming in, plopping down with<br/>
&gt;&gt; you for a few hours?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Because that guy is lower level than me, I should&#39;ve been able<br/>
&gt;to get the stuff before him, and when he went to camp for the<br/>
&gt;item it wouldn&#39;t have mattered to me because I&#39;d already have<br/>
&gt;the item.  Instead, he&#39;s gotten it before me, and thus dumped<br/>
&gt;the camping congestion his item caused onto me when I go to<br/>
&gt;get them.  Like I said, cutting in line.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How does this cause camping congestion?? I would think it would help<br/>
alleviate the problem because the so-called &quot;twinked&quot; character doesn&#39;t need<br/>
it any more, so doesn&#39;t need to camp around for the item.......<br/>

&gt;Calling them jealous because someone behind them got to go to<br/>
&gt;the front is just plain stupid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is annoying, yes, but that&#39;s life and people should just deal with it.<br/>
Life isn&#39;t fair, why should some particular set of &quot;fairness&quot; rules apply<br/>
here?? Not that I&#39;m saying people should run about with abandon and just do<br/>
whatever they want without regard to others... I am one who likes to help<br/>
others as much as possible... but who gets to play &quot;God&quot; in this game???<br/>
