<br/>
Take the broken flute to the female bard (Caldera?) standing at the teleport<br/>
towers next to the bridge in North Karana (from SK).  She will give you the<br/>
other sheet.  Give both of the sheets to Vhalen.<br/>
<br/>
PS  Why did you have to kill the hermit *cries* He didn&#39;t do anything wrong!<br/>
Heh....there is another way to get these two items from him without killing<br/>
him or even attacking him.  If you get close to his front door, and turn<br/>
Walk on..strafe to the right, where the door meets the frame...there is a<br/>
crack large enough for you to target the hermit.  Then walk around to the<br/>
back side of the house, and facing the chimney, get in the right corner of<br/>
the chimney where it meets the house, and Hail away!  This is where I am on<br/>
the quest, looking for.....well, I can&#39;t spoil it ALL    heh<br/>

&gt; TINY SPOILER ALERT<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for all the great input on my weapons question.  After two nights<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; grouping with a friend to kill the hermit in SK (he&#39;s around lvl 21-23 I<br/>
&gt; think, and is at -5411, -2646), I now have enough to buy a Dirk (just<br/>
&gt; shelled out 50pp on banded so I&#39;m rebuilding my funds).  Speaking of Ye<br/>
Olde<br/>
&gt; Hermit, he gives out a cracked flute and the first sheet of the WInds of<br/>
&gt; Karana (to give to the bard at the water fountain in SK), does anyone know<br/>
&gt; if this quest works, or where the other sheet(s) are?<br/>
&gt;     Also, is any particular instrument better than any other?  (ie:  Is my<br/>
&gt; mino horn better or worse than my brass horn. etc)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
