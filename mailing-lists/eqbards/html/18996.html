We zone in, run by the zone campers who are typcially slacking off and kill<br/>
the last 2 of the first six froogs.  Then open the door and down the ramp.<br/>
Kill the 3 at the bottom of the ramp.  When we got the Shroom&#39;s up, it was 3<br/>
wizard froogs and with 2 enchanters in the raid, very likely that one<br/>
charmed a wiz as they do make good pets.  After CR, there was a bug and 2<br/>
froogs at the ramp base.  We kill whatever is there and wait for the<br/>
patroller to go away.  Then if we are heading for the pyramid,  we typically<br/>
cross to the far side and train-pull the first few back off the bridge<br/>
proper and towards the first bugs.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We went in Sebilis in the firsts week of Kunark and, that Mushroom poped<br/>
on us at the bridge. So it is not<br/>
&gt; &gt; a patch effect, it is just poor testing from Verant. If it ever happen<br/>
to your group again, i would<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggest /bug&#39;ing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heh. Like /bug does anything. We&#39;d been in there quite a bit and hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seen this before the patch. In our case, it wasn&#39;t one mushroom, it was<br/>
&gt; 10 ilis and krup frogs. One shroom we could have handled.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now we just make sure we don&#39;t fight/stay at the bridge.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re headed towards the scarabs area, where do you pull to before<br/>
&gt; moving up? We don&#39;t stay at the bridge area, but we usually pull to<br/>
&gt; there to clear for the next stage of advancing deeper. </span></blockquote></div>
