&gt; Hello fellow bards !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been perusing this site for a while amongst others and have<br/>
&gt; noticed no references to specialty items available only to bards, other<br/>
&gt; than their instruments of course.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone know if bards get their own special equipment?  If so, I<br/>
&gt; would be interested in hearing about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
