the programmers always get blamed. I can tell you as a matter of fact that<br/>
most of the poor practices implemented in my code are not of my own volition<br/>
but rather because I was told by a producer &quot;do it this way, that&#39;s what so<br/>
and so decided&quot;. At that point, I find that the producer generally has<br/>
complete resistance to logic or perssuation and the issue is promptly<br/>
closed.<br/>
<br/>
Blame the designers or the middle men that approve the designer&#39;s decisions,<br/>
but don&#39;t turn on the poor lowly programmers, it&#39;s probably not thier doing.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen this stated a bunch...you&#39;ve never seen the code, correct?<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the interface interaction is incredibly Diku-like, but I<br/>
imagine<br/>
this is similar to Bioware using the D&D game architecture, not the old Gold<br/>
Box<br/>
code.<br/>
The game design is obviously based on Diku muds, but the code probably<br/>
isn&#39;t.<br/>
After all, even adapting a Diku code base for a game like EQ would make it<br/>
pretty unrecognizable, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a monstrous package, but the amount of real game stopping bugs is very<br/>
minimal.  Mostly we get trivial bugs that reflect poorly thought out<br/>
logistics,<br/>
not code.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, even Brian Hook said that they&#39;re a a talented bunch of programmers,<br/>
and I<br/>
doubt you&#39;re unimpressed with his work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t mean this to be harsh, I just wonder what causes us to blame<br/>
the<br/>
coders rather than the designers.<br/>
<br/>
Um, and that sign reversal thing does suck, btw.  You have a point there,<br/>
but<br/>
I&#39;ve done stupid things like that in my code before, and I bet you have, too<br/>
:P<br/>

Which means that A) They&#39;ve tinkered with the original Diku experience<br/>
tables (NEEDED!) and B) The Hell levels and the H+1 levels are either<br/>
extremely intentional or some collosolly bad coding.  I&#39;d personally support<br/>
either opinion equally.  I&#39;m not that impressed with Verant&#39;s programming<br/>
prowess.<br/>
