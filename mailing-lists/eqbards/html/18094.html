<div id="ygrps-yiv-253458844">I&#39;ve heard Maestro had been buffed up, but not sure. Didn&#39;t seem like it to <br/>
me. We had 22 people, 1 group with all casters. We found that his lifetap <br/>
seemed to have little to no effect if you were standing behind him. We also <br/>
waited until 50% to nuke him so he wasn&#39;t jumping all over the place. Unlike <br/>
other times, he stayed in one spot the entire time beating on our tanks. Our <br/>
necro slapped a couple dots on him and used the rest of her mana to regen <br/>
the clerics.<br/>
