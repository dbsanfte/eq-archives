 </span></blockquote>Yes it does compare to gate.  With a drum, Accelerando at<br/>
around level 20+ is fast enough that in the time it takes a<br/>
caster to gate to town, run around to buy/sell, and run back<br/>
to a dungeon, a bard can run back to town, run around to<br/>
buy/sell, and run back to the dungeon.  *All* my caster<br/>
friends, even the druids, are insanely jealous of how fast I<br/>
run.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You really have a knack for picking worst case scenarios to<br/>
try to make your point.  You won&#39;t convince many people<br/>
arguing like that.  It&#39;s like saying because wizards cannot<br/>
survive more than a couple hits against a high level mob if<br/>
root fails while a tank can last a minute, wizards should be<br/>
allowed to wear plate.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll be much more convincing if you can give the best-case<br/>
scenario, and still point out an imbalance.  Arguing like you<br/>
have been just makes you sound cynical and bitter, and thus<br/>
not impartial.<br/>
