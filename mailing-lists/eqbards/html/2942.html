usually 80-130 ms.  I have *no* trouble twisting three songs,<br/>
and if I really try hard I can do four maybe every other<br/>
round.  But once the spells start flying, it&#39;s three if I&#39;m<br/>
lucky, usually two.  I&#39;m running at 1024x768 which probably<br/>
doesn&#39;t help, but I don&#39;t want to give up the high resolution.<br/>
