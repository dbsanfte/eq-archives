<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The Lute of the Gypsy Princess used to be used in a Grimrot<br/>
&gt; quest for the Wakizashi.  That quest has since been changed,<br/>
&gt; and the LotGP has no currently known purpose.  As of latest<br/>
&gt; report (about 3 weeks ago I believe) it does not enhance any<br/>
&gt; of your songs.  It comes from the named gypsy - Mythani<br/>
&gt; Dvissi or something like that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A Gypsy Lute is needed for the lambent breastplate quest.  It<br/>
&gt; is +5 magic resist and works like a normal lute.  It is<br/>
&gt; NO-DROP - you will have to loot it yourself from a generic<br/>
&gt; gypsy musician.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All this is hearsay.  I have never seen either of these items.<br/>
