<div id="ygrps-yiv-228884510">I don&#39;t think a max forage skill of 40 is any problem.  I am 37 at the <br/>
moment, but once I reached 30 I was foraging more than I could eat.  I&#39;m <br/>
human, so foraging wasn&#39;t an innate skill either.  As someone else <br/>
mentioned, I simply set it up as a hotkey and hit it whenever I could.  If I <br/>
could just forage water a little more often, I would be completely <br/>
self-sufficient!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I recently noticed that despite getting the foraging skill at 12th level it<br/>
&gt;has never increased.  I was then informed that many of our skills have caps<br/>
&gt;on them of 40 or so.  What&#39;s the deal with this?  I really don&#39;t like the<br/>
&gt;idea of skill caps, especially on a simple self preservation skill like<br/>
&gt;foraging.  You already can&#39;t sell what you forage so why put a cap on it?<br/>
&gt;Does anyone know any more on this and what the possible reasoning behind<br/>
&gt;them could be?  What are bards just too stupid to learn these things really<br/>
&gt;well?  Its not bad enough we all get the useless skill of brass instruments<br/>
&gt;at 12th level, which cannot be used till 18th.  Now Wood Elves get no new<br/>
&gt;skill at 12th since forage is already maxed and hide is already at the<br/>
&gt;supposed cap as well.  Does that mean the xp penalty we take for being able<br/>
&gt;to start with those skills will go away once we actually have them?  I <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;not.  I&#39;m usually not big on ranting, but this has me really steamed.  What<br/>
&gt;good is it to get a skill at 25th level that caps at a point where it will<br/>
&gt;only work on things 10+ levels below you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;J.M.  Any thoughts on this one?  Please tell me this will change at some<br/>
&gt;point.<br/>
