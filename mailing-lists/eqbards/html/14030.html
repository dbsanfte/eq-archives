&gt; No just make the corpse poof if no experience was gained.  Should be easy<br/>

- Can&#39;t gather spell components from greenies (bat wings, bone chips...)<br/>
- Can&#39;t do quest that involved killing a greenie.<br/>
<br/>
Those both are not too bad, but some people would complain.  If players were<br/>
forced to buy bat wings from level 1&#39;s it might help the economy.  But some<br/>
people were afraid that every low level player would band together and<br/>
charge 50pp per bat wing, and you would have to pay since there was no way<br/>
to loot one yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;No Exp - No Magical Loot&quot; idea has been around for a long time.  It was<br/>
originally proposed to prevent high level KillStealers.  Brad actually liked<br/>
this idea, and wished he would have put it in Beta, but didn&#39;t want to put<br/>
such a change in the Final.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the arguments against NE-NML were kinda stupid.  They mainly<br/>
complained that once you passed the level range for an item you would never<br/>
be able to get it yourself again.  They came up with all kinds of theroies<br/>
about a lvl 50 losing their corpse and never being able to replace that<br/>
Shiny Brass Shield.  Or that Verant might add an item to the game that was<br/>
too low for them to get.  They felt that lower level players would extort<br/>
them for 1000&#39;s of plat for some low level item they wanted/needed.<br/>
