<div id="ygrps-yiv-983585339">Please bear with me fellow historians of Norrath but I must say a few things.<br/>
Our board has over 100 members in the first weekend and as the witness to all posts and messages I must say that there have been some good questions.  Some better answers, and some great ideas.<br/>
I must thank everone who has contributed so far, but i must ask another favor.<br/>
We have over 100 voices now and as the legendmakers of our world I want your stories for a newsletter.  I figure if we get 2 or 3 stories a week i will compile them and send them out to our fellows.  If there is anyone who has a web page or link that involves EQ or Bards please send that to me as well I will include all links on the final page of the newsletter as well as the eqbards bookmark section of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Please send me your stories straight to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:legendsoflore@...">legendsoflore@...</a></div>
