<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034683178">This is the most overly-semantic, nitpicky thread I&#39;ve ever read here. :) Oh <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just gonna quote people w/out names, so it&#39;s gonna be kinda random. My <br/>
opinions:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;well it started out by someone saying dirge was useless due to recast time <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;resists.  i said what resist problem, i never have any, and it is useful in <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;situations including pvp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t call it useless, but I would call it not very useful. *shrug* I <br/>
definitely agree with Shada on the resist rates - they further reducing the <br/>
already LOW chance that this would ever take up one of my spell slots.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;they are useless).  the song has been compared to harm touch, and i think <br/>
&gt;it compares<br/>
&gt;favorably to harmtouch with respect to damage/refresh time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why. With Dirge I can hit multiple targets for 450ish damage <br/>
once every 30-40 minutes or so. It is 100% useless on raid-level mobs that <br/>
require lure-level spells (which is a mostly what I see daily). HT is a free <br/>
ability, doesn&#39;t take any mana or spell slots, drops a sizeable nuke on a <br/>
target at lure-level resistance when paired with discipline. I guess in <br/>
terms of regular xp-ing dirge might seem more useful. Not using it won&#39;t <br/>
make you less of a bard though, thx.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have never fought what is now an &quot;uber mob&quot;.  However, according to &gt; <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;on this list (and others) they take in the range of 10 minutes to kill.<br/>
&gt;Which means med times matter.  SO why wouldn&#39;t having a bard in the &gt; <br/>
&gt;wizard<br/>
&gt;group be useful?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pre-Velious mobs take anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 or 4 minutes to kill <br/>
depending on which mob, how many people are engaging it, and how well they <br/>
survive. Velious mobs can take upwards of 15 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am assuming that resist rates are useless on these mobs...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re talking about dirge, you are correct.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So, now that we all (except whee) agree it&#39;s worthless to mem, what changes <br/>
&gt;would need to be made to make it worth memming in place of some other song?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take it out of the game and replace it with a mem-wipe song. :) So solly <br/>
PVPers.<br/>
<br/>
About what classes are good for raiding:<br/>
I still feel that I have my place on raids, and I NEVER have any &quot;your class <br/>
is useless&quot; stigma hanging over my head from my guildmates. This goes for <br/>
every member in my guild. You can get through this entire game and kill just <br/>
about every mob in the game using just clerics, warriors, rogues, and <br/>
enchanters. Thankfully, my guild hasn&#39;t devolved to this point like I know <br/>
one prominent guild on my server (Veeshan) has.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with the single-shaman stress syndrome. You only NEED 1 <br/>
active, but I&#39;d never want to be in his shoes. :)<br/>
