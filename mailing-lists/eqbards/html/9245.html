<br/>
Last night I was in Mistmoore at 9PM Hawaii time.  Thats 3 AM EST.  When I<br/>
logged on, there were less than 15 people in the zone.  The entire time I<br/>
was in Mistmoore, my packet loss percentage never went below 25%.  A<br/>
guildmate was also in MM and I asked if they were having problems as well.<br/>
They stated they weren&#39;t having any problems and suggested I quit the game<br/>
completely and log back in.  Tried that but it didn&#39;t do any good.  Decided<br/>
to go ahead and play despite the lag.  <br/>
<br/>
Got into a fight in the GY and packet loss zoomed up to over 50%.  Was<br/>
fighting a pledge familiar that started to run away.  Tried to cast chains<br/>
on it but, due to the lag, it ran down the cave and soon brought a train of<br/>
ancilles back with him.  I ended up dying and appeared at my bind spot in<br/>
GFAY.  <br/>
<br/>
When I got to GFAY, I had absolutely no lag problems whatsoever.  Packet<br/>
loss was 0% and the lag number was very low.  LFAY was the same as well.  As<br/>
soon as I zoned back into MM, packet loss went back up to over 25%.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing since April and I have never had lag problems like I did<br/>
last night.  Any idea what was the cause? I know MM is considered a buggy<br/>
zone but there weren&#39;t that many people in MM and the other five people in<br/>
my group were having no problems whatsoever.  Don&#39;t think it was my<br/>
connection (cable modem) because I had no lag problems when I was in GFAY<br/>
and LFAY.  <br/>
