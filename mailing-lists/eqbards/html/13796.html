<div id="ygrps-yiv-993029198">Strumming the &#39;flute&#39; drum is an animation.  At least they could have fixed<br/>
it so we beat on the &#39;flute&#39; drum.  Then they&#39;d be halfway there and only<br/>
need to change the &#39;flute&#39; into a drum when they do a graphics patch.  Also<br/>
unless this &#39;animations&#39; guy does other work, he&#39;s been sitting around doing<br/>
nothing most of the time.  I doubt they have a programmer who just does<br/>
animations for the existing game.  If so, he put a bunch of animations in<br/>
once, fixed the playing while sitting, and that&#39;s about it since release.<br/>
Also the people who could have fixed the other things like our broken song<br/>
din&#39;t not fix it because of time constraints.  They didn&#39;t fix it because as<br/>
far as they were concerned it wasn&#39;t broken.  Once they decided it was<br/>
broken it got fixed pretty quickly.  Same thing with Shamanic Alchemy, etc.<br/>
This isn&#39;t a resource issue.  All that matters is whether they think<br/>
something&#39;s broken, and it takes 6+ months of customers complaints to<br/>
convince them that something they think works is fact broken.  That&#39;s their<br/>
real problem.  If we say something appears to be broken their approach is<br/>
ask some programmer if its broken, when they say no it works fine, repeat<br/>
that to the customer or ignore them depending on current whims.  Actually<br/>
getting them to test to see if it might really be broken takes a ridiculous<br/>
amount of effort.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody should also point out to Abashi that Microsoft doesn&#39;t put out word<br/>
processors that are missing 5 letters of the alphabet when they release<br/>
them, and then claim they are waiting to put those in later.  His comparison<br/>
of user complaints between Microsoft and EQ was ludicrous.  My company puts<br/>
out software and we&#39;d for sure be getting customer complaints, in fact<br/>
lawsuits, if we had half the bugs in our code that Verant does.  I can hear<br/>
the help desk now.  &quot;I know it looks like your buying a Tech fund whenever<br/>
you buy our Asian Growth product, but its just a graphics glitch.  We can&#39;t<br/>
fix that in a patch right now.&quot;<br/>

Again, &quot;THEY&quot; are not identical modules that do generic EQ &quot;work&quot;.  The guy<br/>
that<br/>
does the animations is not the guy who can fix our songs.  He&#39;s not the<br/>
programmer that changed our Bard Taunt.  He&#39;s not the guy who makes the<br/>
instrument models.<br/>
<br/>
He probly had time, he fixed it.  I don&#39;t think we have any other animation<br/>
issues that he should have been working on, do you?<br/>

Ah but that&#39;s the whole point.  They consider it broken and that&#39;s all that<br/>
really matters as far as Verant is concerned.  What the customer considers<br/>
broken is of little consequence to them, hence the 6+ month delay in<br/>
recognizing that Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody was in fact broken.<br/>

Which was just as cool an effect as the bard &quot;surfing&quot; and makes you<br/>
wonder, don&#39;t they have better things to do that fix things that no one<br/>
considers broken?<br/>
