 &gt; &gt; Last night I tried to cast Selo&#39;s in Paw and got the message that I must be<br/>
 &gt; &gt; outside to cast this spell. Has this always been like this? I&#39;d swear I had<br/>
 &gt; &gt; done this many times before.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; I noticed this in Paw too.  All I can say is that it also happens<br/>
 &gt; in the Qeynos Aqueduct system, and that it happened to me during <br/>
 &gt; the beta phase 4.<br/>
 &gt; Both zones are &#39;underground&#39;.<br/>
