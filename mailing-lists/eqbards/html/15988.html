&gt; We generally don&#39;t hunt with non guild members, unless they <br/>
&gt; are people that<br/>
&gt; are being considered for guild admission. <br/>
&gt; On the occasion when people are invited, they are made well <br/>
&gt; aware ahead of<br/>
&gt; time that they will not be eligible for loot, unless an item <br/>
&gt; comes up that<br/>
&gt; nobody else wants (which is faily common these days).  If <br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; it, they don&#39;t have to attend.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This really only applies to dragon/god class mobs.  If we&#39;re <br/>
&gt; just getting<br/>
&gt; planar armor, then generally it is available to all that <br/>
&gt; attend.  Sometimes<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ll make exceptions, i.e. Player A has been to 40 planes <br/>
&gt; runs and still<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t gotten a breastplate.  Player B is there for the first <br/>
&gt; time as a<br/>
&gt; guest.  Generally we will tell Player B ahead of time that he <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; eligible for a breastplate should it drop.<br/>
