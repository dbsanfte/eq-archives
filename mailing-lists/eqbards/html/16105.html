<div id="ygrps-yiv-959398327">Yeah, as I said in my last message, this is just what some members of my guild are arguing for Dragon<br/>
raids.  No Bards.  And even with six bards in the guild level 45 and up, we&#39;re having a hard time arguing<br/>
the point.  We&#39;re *supposed* to be the most powerful *grouping* class in the game, but our songs have been<br/>
nerfed to the point where, even in a *full* group, someone else does it better.  Have you seen the<br/>
discussions on other boards where people are asked to list their ideal parties, or the player type they<br/>
would choose to group with first?  If we&#39;re the best grouping class, we should be way up on those lists,<br/>
shouldn&#39;t we?  Instead, most people out there don&#39;t even put bards down as an alternate for the sixth<br/>
slot!  I&#39;m getting a complex.<br/>
