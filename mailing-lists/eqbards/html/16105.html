<div id="ygrps-yiv-959398327">Yeah, as I said in my last message, this is just what some members of my guild are arguing for Dragon<br/>
raids.  No Bards.  And even with six bards in the guild level 45 and up, we&#39;re having a hard time arguing<br/>
the point.  We&#39;re *supposed* to be the most powerful *grouping* class in the game, but our songs have been<br/>
nerfed to the point where, even in a *full* group, someone else does it better.  Have you seen the<br/>
discussions on other boards where people are asked to list their ideal parties, or the player type they<br/>
would choose to group with first?  If we&#39;re the best grouping class, we should be way up on those lists,<br/>
shouldn&#39;t we?  Instead, most people out there don&#39;t even put bards down as an alternate for the sixth<br/>
slot!  I&#39;m getting a complex.<br/>

&gt;   songs are really not meaningful in that scenario.  When a group of<br/>
&gt;   people hunting gods, dragons, etc can say &#39;We really don&#39;t need a bard<br/>
&gt;   for this.&#39;, &#39;We need better tanks, and better healing, bards will just<br/>
&gt;   lag us.&#39;, &#39;I would rather have a warrior with decent gear instead of a<br/>
&gt;   bard.&#39; - something is seriously wrong balance-wise. </span></blockquote></div>
