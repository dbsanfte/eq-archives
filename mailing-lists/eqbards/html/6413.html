<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594200389">Its not, but what is your point?  I am just expressing my personal opinion,<br/>
not saying that anyone agrees or disagrees.  I don&#39;t have a problem with<br/>
Fear/Root either.  Maybe I am missing something...<br/>

&gt; Ok I am confused, how is this any different from Fear/Root?<br/>

&gt; I personally believe that chain/fear is a valid tactic, why not?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do not have the occasion to use this combo often as I <br/>
&gt; mostly adventure in<br/>
&gt; groups but it did save my hide once in Unrest vs. a con <br/>
&gt; Yellow barbed bone<br/>
&gt; caster and even though I would not have known to try it if I <br/>
&gt; had not learned<br/>
&gt; it from this list, I was still amazed and ran around telling <br/>
&gt; all my friends<br/>
&gt; that I solo&#39;d a barbed for days to come.  I had never solo&#39;d <br/>
&gt; a con Yellow<br/>
&gt; mob in all my levels before that and was I think 24th or 25th <br/>
&gt; at the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe we need to hush up about this one before it gets nerfed <br/>
&gt; like the other<br/>
&gt; overused kiting thingy - someone is going to get upset and <br/>
&gt; take this edge<br/>
&gt; away from us.<br/>

&gt; &gt; speaking of fear/chain, i was running to rathe mountains and <br/>
&gt; &gt; on my way from<br/>
&gt; &gt; freeport saw a ranger getting wooped by Dorn... well well <br/>
&gt; &gt; well payback time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I start pounding away at him with my normal buff songs and <br/>
&gt; &gt; he&#39;s doing about<br/>
&gt; &gt; the same damage as i am than he is to me, well to hell with <br/>
&gt; &gt; this, i chain<br/>
&gt; &gt; him down and fear him, so i took off about half his health <br/>
&gt; &gt; using fear, this<br/>
&gt; &gt; tactic is great against cyclops when ya get a druid to snare <br/>
&gt; &gt; it, then fear<br/>
&gt; &gt; it and just pound away. Its sad when a level 14 npc is <br/>
&gt; &gt; pounding the hell out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of a 31th level pc. I just decided to not take any chances <br/>
&gt; &gt; with him. And<br/>
&gt; &gt; upon zoning into Sro afterwards, i saw terrorantula, but was <br/>
&gt; &gt; alone and not<br/>
&gt; &gt; taking any chances against it, since i would have needed to <br/>
&gt; &gt; charm a giant<br/>
&gt; &gt; against it so it was too dangerous for me and my untrusty ISP.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Nothing kills me more then my connectivity.<br/>
