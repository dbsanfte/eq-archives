<b>Subject:</b> Re: My opinion on the safest Freeport&lt;-&gt;Qeynos route. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613089124">I started going through there on my own at Level 13, and found if I simply<br/>
ran, I could get 10 things on me and I would not even get scathed. Just<br/>
turn on the run song, play the drum, and run. For fun I right into<br/>
everything, just see how many times I can get attacked. Tis easy. I do it<br/>
without even thinking now. Just another zone to pass through on my way from<br/>
Rivervale to Paw.<br/>

&gt;In my opinion, if you want the absolute safest route, go the Runnyeye <br/>
&gt;route. I&#39;ve never had a bad experience in either, but the former is <br/>
&gt;definitely as safe as you can get if you&#39;re careful. There&#39;s very little <br/>
&gt;chance of getting trained or something spawning right where you&#39;re <br/>
&gt;standing. Just remember, in the gorge go CRAZY high up on the wall. You&#39;ll <br/>
&gt;be fine, trust me. Be anal about it, take 20 minutes to do it if you <br/>
&gt;wish... unless you have extreme bad luck or make an awful mistake you&#39;ll be <br/>
&gt;alright.<br/>
&gt;Just my opinion. It&#39;s not the fastest or the most convenient way but it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;the safest as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Finally used Lament to escape certain death, very fun ;) I was basically <br/>
&gt;crawling as a beastie whacked on me. Managed to keep it from getting close <br/>
&gt;cuz I lamented it every time it did. Must&#39;ve looked odd to the crowd of <br/>
&gt;bemused onlookers. But while I was fumbling in my inventory to equip my <br/>
&gt;drum I accidentally dropped a backpack I was carrying full of juicy loot. I <br/>
&gt;went back for it, like the fiend that I am - with about 15 hp&#39;s or so (this <br/>
&gt;is AFTER I had zoned), but didn&#39;t find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I pulled a MASSIVE PSYCHO TRAAAAAAIN on everyone there out of spite!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just kidding ;)<br/>

&gt;I keep hearing two opposing statements about travel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know I&#39;m fast, I can outrun a griffin (sometimes), but then I hear if<br/>
&gt;I want to go to Qeynos there are two options. Either RunnEye or High<br/>
&gt;Hold Pass. I hear in HighHold there are gnolls who will kill me and in<br/>
&gt;RunnEye I&#39;ll have 10 creatures trained on me. I don&#39;t like to train, nor<br/>
&gt;do I like to die. So please let me know, whats the safest way for a<br/>
&gt;level 10 Bard to travel from Freeport to Qeynos.<br/>
