<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584735320">I had a cool day with my guild yesterday.  We killed Trakanon in the<br/>
afternoon, cleared Plane of Sky far enough to finish our first Paladin<br/>
epic weapon in the early evening, offed Ixlblat Fer twice for some more<br/>
Cleric epics, then decided what the heck, let&#39;s take a shot at<br/>
Talendor.  And we got him!  Only the second guild on the server to get<br/>
him, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
Trak didn&#39;t drop the guts (he did the first time we killed him), but now<br/>
that I know we can do it, it&#39;s just a matter of time.  And now that we<br/>
know we can kill Talendor, the red scale is within reach (the guild has<br/>
one banked for the next person to need it, who will be me or a<br/>
warrior).  But...<br/>
<br/>
That stinking white scale!  If we have to rely on a Vox raid, every<br/>
caster and his brother wants to roll for the thing (we don&#39;t have enough<br/>
twinks to do it ourselves, we have to organize a multi-guild thing).<br/>
And he doesn&#39;t even drop the thing reliably.<br/>
<br/>
My question for those of you who are hugely uber (hehe) is, then, have<br/>
you managed to kill Gorenaire and, if so, are there techniques that<br/>
help, or is it just a matter of levels/numbers/weaponry?<br/>
<br/>
My other option is to pay 50-75pp for a White Dragonscale Robe and offer<br/>
to trade it to whatever caster wins a Vox lotto for the scale straight<br/>
up, but I&#39;m just not that rich.<br/>
