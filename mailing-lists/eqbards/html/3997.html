&gt; How would a combination of a tentacle whip and a Polished Granite Tomahawk<br/>
&gt; be?  I have both, and was planning on using them at level 17 for dual wield.<br/>
&gt; Which shoud be the primary weapon, or is there a better combo?  I also have<br/>
&gt; a Dragoon Dirk.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you have a dirk, whip and tomahawk, I would say ditch the whip and use the<br/>
tomahawk and the dirk, as the whip isn&#39;t a very good weapon, damage ratio wise.<br/>
The effect is nice, but it doesn&#39;t proc enough to make up for the general<br/>
weakness of the weapon.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of which weapon should go in which hand, in terms of pure damage, the<br/>
dirk should go in your primary hand, and the tomahawk in your other.  If you are<br/>
tanking though, reverse this, as the tomahawk will proc more often in your<br/>
primary hand, and you want that sweet magic skin.<br/>
