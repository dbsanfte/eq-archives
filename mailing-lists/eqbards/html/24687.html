<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626524518">Aye without participation we could not kill the things we want to kill.  I<br/>
had become a casual player, or even less, so that is one reason I decided to<br/>
go.  Casual players can get loot, but it is only going to be after everyone<br/>
else has what they want, and if you are lucky enough that the mob you want<br/>
something off is still being killed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I would have been kicked out or anything, but I also wasn&#39;t<br/>
contributing anymore.  Most of the guild plays every night or at least 6<br/>
nights a week from 5:30pm on.  Recently it was asked (or ordered, however<br/>
you want to see it hehe) that every member attend at least 1 raid per week,<br/>
which isn&#39;t much to ask at all but I wasn&#39;t even doing that much when I<br/>
quit.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I had seen one of your previous posts a long time ago on this <br/>
&gt; subject, but <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t find it. A very involved system. I&#39;m guessing that <br/>
&gt; there aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; any casual gamers in Afterlife, or if they are, they don&#39;t go <br/>
&gt; on raids or <br/>
&gt; if they do, they just know they will not get any loot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It definitely slants rewards to the full time player: Keep up <br/>
&gt; or drop out. </span></blockquote></div>
