&gt;find a pick up group.  If people decided that Swamp of No Hope was the place<br/>
&gt;to be, it would overcrowded and Lake would sit empty. I assume Lake became<br/>
&gt;the hotbed it is because its convient location for all races (especially<br/>
&gt;good since they represent most the games population).   I dont expect to see<br/>
&gt;people hanging out in the entrance room of Najena shouting &quot;22 warrior<br/>
&gt;looking to join Trazden camp&quot;.  However for the people with the organization<br/>
&gt;and friends to do it, these changes will be a nice plus...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually - I&#39;ll tell you why some zones are crowded and others aren&#39;t - it <br/>
doesn&#39;t always have to do with population like that.  The Swamp is not a <br/>
popular place because it&#39;s difficult to hunt in without ShowEQ or <br/>
tracking.  You simply can&#39;t see far enough to find something to hunt, and <br/>
since it&#39;s such a wide range of creatures, higher level mobs can be right <br/>
on top of you before you even see them.  The tendency for mobs to hit the <br/>
water is also a problem for following and killing them - we&#39;ve all seen the <br/>
water warp in effect.<br/>
<br/>
Lake of Ill Omen, on the other hand, is a nice, open, clear space that <br/>
people can hunt in, with a good range of monsters, few surprises, and even <br/>
at peak population doesn&#39;t feel over-full.  Ditto for most of the zones you <br/>
described.  Smaller, enclosed zones where mobs can hit you through the wall <br/>
are not as popular - and are only populated because of the phat lewtz they <br/>
have...<br/>
