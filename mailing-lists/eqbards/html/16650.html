<div id="ygrps-yiv-519281684">I agree mostly John.  That&#39;s btw how I really figured out how ridiculously<br/>
overpowered Necros are, to the point where I think anyone who thinks they<br/>
aren&#39;t is misinformed, ignorant, or purposefully blind.  I have done a lot<br/>
of 2 person groups, more than any other size due to the casual gaming style<br/>
of the majority of my friends.  Grouping with any other one person allows me<br/>
to increase the level of similar mob I can handle by 2-3.  I go from taking<br/>
a light blue aviak solo, to maybe a white with a second person at the same<br/>
frequency.  With a Necro I go from light blue to light red with no decrease<br/>
in frequency (downtime).  The difference is, the Necro goes from feeling a<br/>
little shaky versus a yellow solo, to feeling pretty safe vs a light red<br/>
with me.  He gains 1 whole level of mob level adding me (or anyone he says)<br/>
maybe 2 at most.  I gain 5-6 levels of mob level difficulty adding him.  At<br/>
best that&#39;s a 5-2 ratio which is pretty unbalanced.  The only time I seem to<br/>
add more than another class to a group is when its a group without a healer.<br/>
Then I reduce the downtime significantly, otherwise I might as well be just<br/>
about anybody else.<br/>

Unfortunately, that&#39;s not the proper comparison to make.  The<br/>
number of people in your group will make a big difference in<br/>
the group&#39;s ability.  The biggest jump is going from 1 person<br/>
to 2 people (double the hp, double the damage output = killing<br/>
stuff twice as fast with half the downtime).  So when your<br/>
bard leaves, the drop in your group&#39;s effectiveness is not<br/>
just due to lack of a bard, it&#39;s also due to lack of a 4th<br/>
group member.<br/>
<br/>
You need to replace the bard with someone else (hopefully as<br/>
competent a player :) and compare.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; so far the least important char in our group is the wizard.  She&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; great player (remember how I said I never had to cast heals on her? <br/>
&gt; Thats a pretty good sign of a good wizard), but I don;t think the group<br/>
&gt; really hurts without her.  Obviously fights go slower, but I would say<br/>
&gt; our xp gain is about the same with or without her.  Theres a definite<br/>
&gt; drop off when any of the other members leave.  I may change my tune at<br/>
<br/>
I would expect that to be the case early on.  Early on, the<br/>
damage mobs do is really not that great relative to your hp.  <br/>
You end up killing stuff and having little downtime.  Having a<br/>
nuker there to shorten your fights does not really affect<br/>
things much because your group is already operating at near<br/>
top effectiveness.  i.e. The ratio of mob survival time to<br/>
your survival time is already very low.  If the wizard<br/>
accounts for half the group&#39;s damage, nuking to cut it in half<br/>
from 0.1 to 0.05 does not make that big a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Later on, the mobs do a lot more damage so you end up killing<br/>
stuff and having lots of downtime.  The ratio of mob survival<br/>
time to your survival time is rather high, say 0.8.  Nuking to<br/>
cut it in half from 0.8 to 0.4 makes a big difference.<br/>
