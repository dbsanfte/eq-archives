&gt; This may seem like superstition on my part but the goblin wizards in<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock seemed to have been given a boost in their nastiness. I was<br/>
&gt; soloing these guys at lvl 12 without losing more than two bubbles of damage,<br/>
&gt; then recently at level 13 I hit a few once more and almost died a few times.<br/>
&gt; I know that things that con the same can vary in potency but this is a big<br/>
&gt; difference. I&#39;ve also noticed this with the skeletons outside of the<br/>
&gt; Minotaur Cave in Steamfront, which helped me make my 12th level and turned<br/>
&gt; promptly to conning green, only to return to blue now at 14th level.<br/>

been fighting orcs in Highpass, and the majority of them were<br/>
conning green to me at 19.  Then came a patch and the majority<br/>
were blue again.  A couple weeks ago someone on this list<br/>
noted that it had happened again, and the Highpass orcs now<br/>
give you experience up into your low 20s.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine they&#39;re tweaking the level spreads in different<br/>
areas to give folks more things to fight, but I wish they&#39;d<br/>
announce these things.  It can be a major pain to attack<br/>
something you&#39;d been killing easily last night, and die to it<br/>
tonight; especially once you hit level 25 and the /con<br/>
messages are the same for all blues - you cannot tell a low<br/>
blue from a high blue.<br/>
