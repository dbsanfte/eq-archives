<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012439802">On Bristlebane last night, I saw what looked to be a world emote that said<br/>
something like: &quot;The undead have been cleansed from Kithicor.. for now.<br/>
They will be back soon, with a vengeance!&quot;  I got the impression that it<br/>
was something of a test, and the spawn will be permanent (at night,<br/>
that is) after tomorrow&#39;s patch.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought I&#39;d introduce myself:  I play Selianth, a level 22 bard on<br/>
Cazic-Thule.  Been reading the list for a week or two now :)  Look me up<br/>
if you&#39;re ever around! <br/>

&gt; 		On Solusek Ro last night, someone in my party talked to a gm<br/>
&gt; and apparently the undead spawn in Kithicor was cancelled because the<br/>
&gt; newbies were complaining about dying.  Don&#39;t know how true this is but<br/>
&gt; perhaps it is why they stopped the spawn.<br/>

&gt; 				I went thru kithicor today and ... no more<br/>
&gt; undead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				As for what they dropped yesterday, the<br/>
&gt; NORMAL undead spawns dropped<br/>
&gt; 				&quot;Tainted&quot; weapons of all varieties, (1hs,<br/>
&gt; 2hs, piercing, 1hb, 2hb) the<br/>
&gt; 				only one I heard stats on was:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				Tainted Rapier, Piercing,  Dam 19 delay<br/>
&gt; 5,several +5 stat bonuses and<br/>
&gt; 				-5sv disease.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				All the weapons were no-drop, and I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get a chance at any of them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 				Side note: everyone in the zone was saying<br/>
&gt; &quot;I hope hope leave it this<br/>
&gt; 				way forever&quot; just like last week in Lake<br/>
&gt; rathe when the pets were<br/>
&gt; 				spawning like crazy and everypne was saying<br/>
&gt; &quot;I hope it stays this way&quot;.<br/>
&gt; 				TWO examples of people LOVING a zone, BOTH<br/>
&gt; of which Verant KABONG&#39;ed.<br/>
&gt; 				Makes you wonder if they really WANT us<br/>
&gt; happy.<br/>
