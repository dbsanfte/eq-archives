<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349357142">Greetings.<br/>
<br/>
Just joined the list today, and I happened to notice a thread that I&#39;d<br/>
posted on at the Concert Hall Website<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/)">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/)</a> regarding weapon effectivness.<br/>
<br/>
What I learned here came from the SK Website over at EQStractics, but I<br/>
decided to apply it to bards because it made sense (To my limited<br/>
knowledge that is)<br/>
<br/>
To sum up what they had learned:<br/>
The hit you make the most often, the mode, (thank you Kaearia) is<br/>
considered tha &#39;Magic Number&#39; (MN).  This number over a large enough<br/>
sample size shows up to be 20% (Approx) higher than any other damage<br/>
amt.  The way to figure out this MN is a set formula which we&#39;re all<br/>
familiar with (possibly)<br/>
<br/>
      MN = (wep dmg * 2) + ((lvl - 25)/3)<br/>
<br/>
The first part (wep dmg * 2) determines the base dmg caused by the<br/>
weapon, the second part ((lvl - 25)/3) is the bonus you get as you<br/>
progress up levels.  At lvl 50, you get a +8 bonus (Always round down.)<br/>
<br/>
Ok.. now you know what the dmg you can cause in one swing on average is.<br/>
<br/>
If you take this number and divide it by the delay of the weapon, you<br/>
now have an effective way to compare the weapons between levels.<br/>
<br/>
    MN = (wep dmg * 2) + ((lvl - 25)/3)/dly<br/>
<br/>
When you look at this on a spreadsheet, it makes some really interesing<br/>
facts come to life, such as:<br/>
Compare Bladed Thulian Claws to a Silvery War Axe at both Lvl 25 and<br/>
then at 50.<br/>
                 LVL 25      LVL 50<br/>
Thulian Claws      37          18<br/>
Silvery War Axe    34          24<br/>
<br/>
Or take the Mithrill Quill compared to a Obsidian Shard<br/>
                 LVL 25      LVL 50<br/>
Mith Quill         88          36<br/>
Obsidian Shard     54          42<br/>
<br/>
Or, one of the most shocking IMHO.<br/>
                 LVL 25      LVL 50<br/>
SS o Ykesha        17          17<br/>
Shark Tooth        31          14<br/>
<br/>
If anyone cares to take a look at the spreadsheet for themselves feel<br/>
free.  The website where you can find it is at<br/>

<br/>
A few disclaimers first though...<br/>
*  This formula is only valid for characters over lvl 25, I don&#39;t know<br/>
the formula for characters under 25<br/>
*  Proc&#39;s are -NOT- factored in in any way shap manner or form.  I&#39;m<br/>
trying to figure out a way that I can.<br/>
*  The format for the spreadsheet is Excel 97<br/>
*  There are a bunch of blanks.  If you could all help me fill it it,<br/>
it&#39;d be appreciated. =)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy what I created, and I hope you are able to put it to good<br/>
use.<br/>
