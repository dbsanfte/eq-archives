<div id="ygrps-yiv-339557364">Reguarding the Lambent stones, we killed about 16 hg&#39;s in mountains zone and<br/>
did not get any stones at all.  We were 2 bards and a druid.    Then last<br/>
night i bought a lambent stone for 70pp from a guy who then proceeded to ask<br/>
me tons of questions about my bard quests and my icy greaves...<br/>
<br/>
On another note, a paladin on my server had a lambent stone the other night<br/>
and cashed it in for a staff of solusek ro which he then traded in for a<br/>
staff of writhing....   So i&#39;d say the 70pp i paid for my stone was no loss.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotta go see if genni is fixed or not on sol ro, i have what i need for<br/>
the pants, and my buddy got his breastplate last night, lucky sob<br/>

&gt; I found a lambent stone on the first giant I killed, then had a<br/>
&gt; mini-drought.  I would say from<br/>
&gt; my experience, which is four lambent stones worth, that about one in four<br/>
&gt; giants in Rathe<br/>
&gt; Mountains seems to drop a stone.  This seems to be higher than the<br/>
&gt; reported incidence from other<br/>
&gt; bards though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m finding it easier to get the armor quest components versus getting a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lambent stones.  So far I have five quest components.  I have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; auctioning to buy a lambent stone ever since the patch came out.  I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried this in every zone I pass through.  Not once has anyone had one to<br/>
&gt; &gt; sell.  I&#39;ve asked my guild to be on the lookout for them.  Despite<br/>
&gt; killing<br/>
&gt; &gt; numerous giants, no one in my guild has looted one.  Do lambent stones<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; get dropped in specific zones or can they get dropped in any zone with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; giant or griffin?  How often do they get dropped?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, can non-bards complete the bard armor quests in order to sell the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lambent armor pieces?  If the armor is NO DROP, I guess its possible<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; people are hanging on to lambent stones so they can complete the quests.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; know most of the quest components are NO DROP but I can&#39;t remember if<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; lambent armor is NO DROP so can someone confirm this for me?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>
