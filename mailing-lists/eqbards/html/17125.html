<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460493946">Not true.  that would only occur is vs every mob I was a few % points<br/>
behind.  Odds are if I was even 80% as effective as them I would win out by<br/>
random chance vs some mobs when I did well and they did not and I would get<br/>
the mob attention.  This never happened.<br/>
<br/>
All combat messages were on and they way outdamaged me, not even close.<br/>
Ranger has double attack in addition to dual wield and the sk was just scary<br/>
with double attack and his 2-hddr.  <br/>
<br/>
Its the typical problem many game systems have.  Being focused is all that<br/>
really counts.  Being versatile just means you stink at everything.  Neither<br/>
the ranger nor the sk worried about putting points anywhere but strength and<br/>
agility and stamina because it just didn&#39;t matter.  Where I have higher<br/>
stats overall, particularly in Charisma, they have much higher combo of<br/>
strength and stamina than me.  Agility is about the same all around.  the sk<br/>
can hit twice in a round for 40+ points each hit (Dark Reaver), the ranger<br/>
has the same combo I do, PGT and Dirk, plus he has double attack so can hit<br/>
twice as well.  Their focus on melee stats (extra hp&#39;s and more melee<br/>
skills) makes them far more effective than me.<br/>
<br/>
Consider.  All melee classes get 6 or 7 melee skills except bards.  we get<br/>
two, dodge (which everyone gets) and dual wield.  That&#39;s not even close to<br/>
50%.<br/>

&gt; Our melee is really too weak currently to qualify as a secondary.  I back<br/>
&gt; this opinion up by this experience.  I was grouped at one point with a<br/>
&gt; ranger and a shadowknight.  We agreed to test out our melee skills,<br/>
letting<br/>
&gt; the monsters be the judges.  None of us cat any spells or used any<br/>
abilities<br/>
&gt; except the ranger to snare mobs that had ceased to offer their opinion as<br/>
&gt; judges.  The result?  I did not take more than a single attack the entire<br/>
&gt; night in any fight.  In 4 hours of play I took maybe 150 points of damage.<br/>
&gt; The shadowknight won the contest but only barely.  He was attacked 54% of<br/>
&gt; the time, the ranger 46%.   The number of attacks on me was below 1%.<br/>
<br/>
This is a bit misleading.  Your melee could be 95% that of the<br/>
ranger (and the SK&#39;s 101%) and you could get the same results.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d be better off turning on all attack messages, then<br/>
parsing the file afterwards to figure out damage/sec and<br/>
damage_taken/sec figures.<br/>
