&gt; My trip would have been death-free, except for the Ghoul Lord <br/>
&gt; and his pet,<br/>
&gt; who were waiting at the zone and charged me all my hit points for my<br/>
&gt; goodies. But even that had a plus, cause I got to meet <br/>
&gt; Kenross on my CR<br/>
&gt; journey. Nice to meet you, Song Brother!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Query: Looking for a replacement for my Bronze helmet, <br/>
&gt; entirely for cosmetic<br/>
&gt; reasons. I&#39;m going without a head piece right now because <br/>
&gt; bronze is so ugly<br/>
&gt; compared to the shin items. I&#39;d prefer a graphic-less item or <br/>
&gt; a steel helmet<br/>
&gt; looking piece (Don&#39;t have the cash for actual steel right <br/>
&gt; now). And I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care for the chain look so Black Iron Crown is out. Thanks <br/>
&gt; for your advice! </span></blockquote></div>
