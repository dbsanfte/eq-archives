<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557657696">Nope, but that will work as well, I think - never really tried that one for<br/>
this reason.<br/>
<br/>
Enchanter spells that clear the hate list, also clear the damage list (I<br/>
think) - try it and see.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, they want it that bad, I back off and let them have it - and<br/>
occassionally - the mob has THEM instead - pity....but it does keep them<br/>
out of my hair for awhile.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Once you get high enough to charm - that IS something<br/>
&gt;&gt; a bard can do, charm the mob - the caster wastes his<br/>
&gt;&gt; manna, mob goes uncharmed, proceed to kill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By Charm are you talking about the level 15 song? I&#39;ve had to resort to<br/>
&gt;using that song before when someone really got on my nerves to clear the<br/>
&gt;damage list and then start bellowing and hitting it as hard as I can hoping<br/>
&gt;to finish it off first. As a Bard (15th song) it&#39;s the only way I know of to<br/>
&gt;keep something I&#39;m fighting from being stolen. And when you&#39;d much rather be<br/>
&gt;playing songs to improve your speed or AC or something, that&#39;s a real<br/>
&gt;bummer.<br/>
