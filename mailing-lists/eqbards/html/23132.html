<div id="ygrps-yiv-822249601"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; #2) I have been thinking about trying to get a SS bracer, but really <br/>
&gt; do not want to put the time in the camp. EQ Prices has them listed in <br/>
&gt; the 2K-2.5K range, but a couple of my friends kinda laughed and said <br/>
&gt; I would be looking in the 10K-15K range... what is the price of the <br/>
&gt; bracer, and how good are they? (BTW, this is on Xegony.)<br/>
