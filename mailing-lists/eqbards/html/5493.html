<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433848838">That&#39;s fascinating.  I many times after spending some time with a person<br/>
online form a picture in my mind of what they sound like and what sort of<br/>
accent they might have.  Its amazing how ridiculously far off I usually am<br/>
in the few times I have actually spoken to the person later.  Its a lot of<br/>
fun being grouped with three Japanese players for 4 hours and being the odd<br/>
man out for a change.  It was a lot of fun and we all struggled to<br/>
communicate at one time or another.  Still the exchange of info and playing<br/>
styles was invaluable.  They were all fascinated to find that one of my<br/>
favorite sites was Quesstor&#39;s since it is in Japanese for the most part.  I<br/>
told them I was sad I couldn&#39;t read all the info but the maps were the<br/>
coolest I&#39;d ever seen.  Much like the meticulous hand drawn maps my<br/>
character would purchase in the game if he could!<br/>
On a side note, for some reason I always pictured you with a southern drawl<br/>
Rebecca.  Mine has softened a bit living in the Rockies, but when I get mad<br/>
or excited it still comes out.  What part of the south are you from?  I came<br/>
from Virginia, but have lived in Miami and South Carolina.<br/>

I love meeting players from other countries! I can sometimes spot them per <br/>
english skills but most times not, ingame. Then its the &#39;where are you, <br/>
anway?&#39; routine. We have several Eurpoeans in our guild but only 1 is <br/>
usually on at anything remotely like our American play hours. I have run <br/>
into the odd Japanese ocassionally on Xegony during our play hours but their<br/>
<br/>
main continent is logging about the time we are getting started. We also <br/>
have a few French Canadians in our guild. You would think Canadians would be<br/>
<br/>
very close to Americans but not always. The thing that will trip you up <br/>
fastest with folks of different countries is culture references. Sometimes <br/>
its harmless:<br/>
<br/>
Guild wizard (american) meets guild barbarian warrior (canadian) for the <br/>
first time:<br/>
Wiz: You look like Peter Rabbit in that horned helm!<br/>
Barb: Umm, who is Peter Rabbit?<br/>
<br/>
I always take it as a new opportunity to learn things. We are going to try <br/>
out the BattleField Communicator this week and the Canadian is already <br/>
worried about his speaking English and accent. And then there&#39;s me with my <br/>
Southern Drawl. I can&#39;t wait, LOL.<br/>
