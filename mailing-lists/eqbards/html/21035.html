<div id="ygrps-yiv-715748778">I&#39;m still around lurking in the shadows, work has been keeping me extremely<br/>
busy this summer and long hours in the office 7 days a week are keeping me<br/>
out of EQ.  I&#39;m not planning on going anywhere and hope to get some more<br/>
playing time again starting in September.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, nothing to report...Faras is level 49 now and still in full<br/>
lambent armor, how pathetic.<br/>
