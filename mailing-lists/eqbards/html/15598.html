<br/>
These things happen, and these things hurt because online<br/>
RPGing is more than &quot;just a game.&quot;  The genre is evolving into<br/>
something I don&#39;t think most people are foreseeing - a virtual<br/>
world where your persona is not just a role you play, but an<br/>
alternate ego that is every bit as real as your real life.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the companies running these things have figured<br/>
this out to the extent that people will pay more for this than<br/>
a normal game.  Would you pay $10/mo for a license to play D&D<br/>
or Traveller?  Would you pay $1000 to a GM in one of these<br/>
games if he&#39;d let you have a Super-Weapon-of-Critter-Slaying?  <br/>
But people are willing to pay more for EQ and UO because<br/>
they&#39;re more than a game - they&#39;re your opportunity to run an<br/>
alternate personality in another world.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, none of the companies have really addressed the<br/>
full implications of this.  You&#39;re not playing a game; you&#39;re<br/>
running around in a virtual world.  To prevent it from<br/>
dissolving into the anarchy where every guttersnipe can get<br/>
away with whatever he wants to do, you need a social support<br/>
structure - laws, some form of government (a dictatorship by<br/>
the GMs would be sufficient for now).  Based on some<br/>
pre-release comments by Verant on how they&#39;d deal with<br/>
cheaters, I&#39;d hoped that they&#39;d seen the light.  But<br/>
unfortunately they only seem interested in punishing violation<br/>
of programming code laws (hacking, bug exploiting), not social<br/>
laws.  Oh well, maybe the next game...<br/>
<br/>
To be fair to the people who do these types of things like<br/>
steal items or PK, they may still see it as &quot;just a game.&quot;  <br/>
The problem is that the people playing the same game have<br/>
different expectations of the seriousness with which other<br/>
people consider their actions.  I see this genre splitting<br/>
into more serious virtual worlds and more laid-back &quot;just a<br/>
game&quot; type environments.  Sort of like the schism that&#39;s<br/>
growing between the current crop of perpetual online RPGs and<br/>
multiplayer shoot-em-ups.<br/>
