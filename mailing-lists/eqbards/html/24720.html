<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182694034">BTW, I tested charm kiting some frost giants (in velious) and didn&#39;t really <br/>
have much of a problem at all. After charming a frost giant captain, I had <br/>
him attack a frost giant savage. I restarted selos&#39;, retargetted my pet and <br/>
waited for charm to break. Then I re-charmed my pet, pressed my &quot;target <br/>
nearest npc&quot; key, and hit my &quot;/pet attack&quot; social while backing away to <br/>
stay out of melee range.<br/>
<br/>
Worked like a charm.<br/>
<br/>
The savage never got close enough to me to even touch me and I soon had to <br/>
find something for the captain to beat up on. It was a bit of a pain to <br/>
wait for the captain to keep up with me while I found him something else to <br/>
fight, but since charm had broken, he obligingly chased me.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say this latest change has ruined charm kiting. The only difficulty <br/>
I foresee is when the creature my pet is supposed to kill is starting to <br/>
run away when low on life. At least in Velious or Kunark, I just circle my <br/>
victim while re-establishing charm so that I can retarget it easily and <br/>
order the attack. Of course, it&#39;s best to charm kite in a nice open <br/>
territory where there aren&#39;t a lot of other wandering creatures or trees to <br/>
run into.<br/>
