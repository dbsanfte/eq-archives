<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106142872">my bard doesnt have one piece of rubicite on him, and im proud of that fact,<br/>
i cant stand cazic, so many jerks in that zone its sickening, the only<br/>
reason im looking for rubicite is for my rogue friend, which has a silvery<br/>
war axe to spare for rubi if i trade mine off, i also have Hatar&#39;s fine silk<br/>
turbin which im trying to pawn off for some rubi for him, but no takers on<br/>
that either...<br/>

&gt; Wondering where you heard this rumor from?  I read on EQVault that rogues<br/>
&gt; and shamans were soon going to lose the ability to wear rubicite but saw<br/>
&gt; nothing about bards being included.  This may end up being a moot point if<br/>
&gt; the Solusek bard quests give bard unique armor.  I think I would prefer<br/>
&gt; doing the quests, no matter how hard, versus camping for rubicite.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; And just because some of you actually read my messages, here is today&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; secret: Get your rubicite armour while you still can.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
