 </span></blockquote>  Charisma isn&#39;t that important.  Not as important as you play it out<br/>
  to be.  I have 130 CHA and I rarely get resisted on songs versus<br/>
  blues or lower.  Anything over 100 seems to be all the same to me.<br/>
  It just so happens the DEX I want also comes with CHA, otherwise<br/>
  I would lower my CHA more.  All L50+ mobs exist in other planes,<br/>
  except for a few in remote spots on Norrath.  Those said mobs can<br/>
  annihilate you in 5 rounds of combat, and have magic resistances<br/>
  of unspeakable proportion (tashani+malosi and I _still_ couldn&#39;t get<br/>
  many pixie strikes to land on Clerics of Innoruuk).  Charisma really<br/>
  doesn&#39;t do anything for me after it&#39;s at 100, I&#39;ve been at 110, 130,<br/>
  and 170 (buffed) and seen no difference in song effectiveness.  When<br/>
  I was small I had no problems with resists either, if the mob wasn&#39;t <br/>
  red, I usually got a song to stick (permafrost and highkeep).  Back<br/>
  then I didnt have a guise, or star ruby rings.  Base CHA of 95, and<br/>
  no problems.<br/>
<br/>
  If Verant told you tomorrow that AGI made bard songs work better<br/>
  you&#39;d swear by it and boost your agility.  I&#39;m not so easily blinded.<br/>
  I&#39;ve been around the block testing my bard, Verant obviously hasn&#39;t.<br/>

  I missed four notes in a row a night ago on Clarit.  Still doesn&#39;t <br/>
  top my record of five missed on Selo&#39;s.  Whenever I miss notes,<br/>
  it&#39;s almost always consecutive.  Poor, poor random function.</div>
