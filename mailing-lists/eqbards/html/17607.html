<div id="ygrps-yiv-438093448">Good news bad news.  I&#39;m 38 - so I should get it soon.  But 5 mana?  Granted<br/>
that&#39;s not much mana - but considering that Clarity etc doesn&#39;t work for<br/>
us - why are we getting charged mana for using songs.  The one exception<br/>
(Dirge? I&#39;m 38 so I forget the name) was explained to us that the mana use<br/>
was a convenient timer to keep it from being used rapidly...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I&#39;m curious to see how it really works.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure which vendor sells it, however a 46th level bard in my guild<br/>
&gt; found the 39th level song today after the patch.  I was logging when he<br/>
&gt; started yelling about it, so I didnt get which town... all I saw was &quot;the<br/>
&gt; girl in the back&quot;.  That could mean any of the guildhouses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The 39th level song is a new charm song, and requires 5 mana to use.<br/>
&gt; *cheers*<br/>
