<br/>
My husband and I ventured into ButcherBlock for the first time today. <br/>
Briefly put -- it was broken.  For some reason, the client-side locations<br/>
and the server-side locations (of players, critters, etc.) refused to stay<br/>
synched.  Sounds like the same problem as that that of &quot;falling off the<br/>
boat.&quot;  BTW, the boat was apparently sometimes crashing the BB zone,<br/>
although we didn&#39;t experience that for the several hours we were there.  (At<br/>
least we didn&#39;t notice it.)<br/>
<br/>
Ever wondered how you can explore new regions, find profitable new critters<br/>
(a giant scarab is a thing of beauty), have only one person die once, and<br/>
STILL have a lousy time?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Zak, where did you go?  I don&#39;t see you.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Hold on, I&#39;ll find you...&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Zak, why are you running around in circles?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m NOT!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(three minutes later)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Zak, you didn&#39;t really run up that cliff wall, did you?&quot;<br/>
&quot;No....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You get the idea.  It didn&#39;t matter whether I auto-followed or did it by<br/>
sight, he&#39;d still disappear on me.  And we didn&#39;t have this problem in<br/>
Faydark.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody know if this is a Xegony-only problem (memory leak?) or if it&#39;s<br/>
something broken system-wide?<br/>

    I had one heck of a night trying to get back to Freeport from<br/>
Butcherblock - the boat crashed  three times.  What would happen is first<br/>
all the other players on the boat would disappear then you&#39;d get dumped... <br/>
The first time I was back on the dock in BB then next time on the boat on<br/>
the way to BB and then finally on the boat on the way to Freeport.<br/>
 <br/>
    The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny players claimed<br/>
that the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on the boat...  The first<br/>
time I was in fact playing a song and thought that it might contribute.  The<br/>
second time - no bards were playing (assuming no one in the hold was) and it<br/>
crashed anyways.  I think this was true the third dump as well.  <br/>
 <br/>
    So I am wondering if people have any experience in this.  My gut is that<br/>
there is no relation between the two - and this is yet another myth (like<br/>
all bard songs will require mana!)<br/>
