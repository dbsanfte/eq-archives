<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569817362"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;First, I want to make one point: most deaths<br/>
&gt; occur 2 to 3 zones from the bind point.<br/>
&gt; Agreed this would be the average death distance<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With those points made, I believe that Verant gave <br/>
&gt; magic-users and priests the ability to bind anywhere<br/>
&gt; because making the 2 - 3 zone run to fetch a corpse<br/>
&gt; can be darn near impossible.  Magic-users are roughly<br/>
&gt; 40% less effective in melee combat because of their<br/>
&gt; reduced OFF/DEF, and priests are down 20%, and neither<br/>
&gt; group has any special melee attacks like the melee<br/>
&gt; classes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A melee class that depends completely on their armor<br/>
and weapons, which are now 2-3 zones away on their<br/>
corpse. A casting class depends on their spells which<br/>
are on them at ALL times no matter where they are.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s more dangerous for a caster to run 2-3 zones<br/>
away completely armed with their weapons (spells) and<br/>
their shields (spells), and less dangerous for a melee<br/>
class to make the same run with no weapons and no<br/>
armor at all.<br/>
<br/>
Please explain that again. I think I missed something.</div>
