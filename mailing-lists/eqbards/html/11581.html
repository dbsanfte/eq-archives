&gt;I have a problem with obtaining lambent stones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying to cash in<br/>
&gt;on lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>
&gt;cheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>
&gt;saying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>
&gt;refuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent over 1000pp<br/>
&gt;purchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not going to<br/>

&gt;I still need about 7 lambent stones total for the rest of my armor and I am<br/>
&gt;certainly not willing to pay another 200-1000pp to obtain them, &gt;Does<br/>

I feel your pain brother- :)<br/>
I have been extremely lucky in obtaining my first 4 Lambent stones. I paid<br/>
20 pp for one, the rest where given to me by friends or guildmates, who<br/>
actually held on to them for me until i needed them.<br/>
I also refuse to pay more than 20 pp for one-and I sincerely believe that<br/>
the only way we can accomplish this is by being in aggreement across the<br/>
board as the Bardic community,not to spend more than 10-20pp for a stone.<br/>
Yes you may get the occasional butthead with money to burn who will throw<br/>
100pp+, but I think these people are few and far between-hang in there, and<br/>
make friends.<br/>
I have always used humor to get what I need or want- its tough to refuse a<br/>
request if you make someone laugh- they&#39;ve been camping or hunting for<br/>
hours,and I&#39;ll say something that I know can bring a smile or laugh. You&#39;d<br/>
be suprised how many responses I get to the positive.<br/>
Also, having the mana song doesnt hurt either :)<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
