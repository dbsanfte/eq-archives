<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441126898">I used to group quite a bit with an enchanter friend.  He was a high elf but<br/>
would almost always have the human illusion up.  He said that the reason for<br/>
this is that he would get more EXP as a human instead of a high elf.<br/>
Supposedly this was common knowledge among the enchanter community.  Now I<br/>
don&#39;t know for certain if this is a fact or not, but if it is true, then it<br/>
would be a safe assumption that bards with a DE illusion would get the same<br/>
EXP modifier as true DEs.  <br/>

I&#39;ve been told that ShowEQ shows that when you are using the guise<br/>
illusion dark elf your exp table gets changed to dark elf, so I guess<br/>
it&#39;s possible, though I haven&#39;t heard of it being tested yet. All bards<br/>
seem to get the same exp penalty regardless of race so I don&#39;t know if<br/>
you would get a change or not. When I heard the issue discussed it was<br/>
from testing a warrior with the pre-patch guise so the exp difference<br/>
would matter.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if a troll sk who used the old guise would actually need less<br/>
exp.<br/>

&gt; Now, I have looked over all the bard sites and been reading here for quite<br/>
&gt; some time and never seen mention of this.  The other bard that I talked to<br/>
&gt; said he had searched the rogue sites with no info found.  Has anyone here<br/>
