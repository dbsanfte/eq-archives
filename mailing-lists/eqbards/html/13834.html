<div id="ygrps-yiv-970198832">Greetings and Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
My bard has &gt;100 days played and is level 42 (hoping to ding 43 tonight!)<br/>
but my times are badly  skewed by many nights of falling sleep while zoning<br/>
or camping or running or simply staying up far too late.  And I spend a lot<br/>
of my time doing non-exp stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My close fiends who were pretty much power gamers got their first 50 chars<br/>
there in about 40 days played. They spent 95% of their time killing mobs for<br/>
xp.  They did a few quests for good equipment and one night actually did<br/>
something social.  But most of the time they were simply focused on killing<br/>
stuff for xp.  In fact they re-started chars to have a better balanced group<br/>
and played all night - every night.  They had wizard chars that could<br/>
tele-port the group at will.  If Unrest was camped, we tele&#39;d to CT or<br/>
Sol-A. Downtime was very minimal.  And one is a master jeweler who made lots<br/>
of money and funded many things.  Everyone was always symbol buffed. We got<br/>
to the point where there was nothing left to buy (yes, even tinkers bags.)<br/>
<br/>
A lev 50 in my guild has gotten his halfling warrior twink to 47 in under 10<br/>
days played.  He has 2 PC&#39;s so he can play both char&#39;s at the same time and<br/>
has been doing some serious twinking with equipment and weps as well a exp<br/>
camps.  And he says he is really liking the halfling warrior so much he may<br/>
make it his primary.  This guy is obviously quite good and very<br/>
knowledgeable about mobs and such.  And he has preserved his factions in<br/>
Ogg.<br/>
<br/>
But when I say &quot;I really need to level - I want to beat so-and-so to level<br/>
45...&quot;  I get told &quot;relax, who cares about other&#39;s levels - play the game<br/>
for your own enjoyment.&quot;  Much of the game is very tedious.  Especially if<br/>
you are simply trying to get xp to make a level.  In fact, the better you<br/>
get or more powerfull your group, the more tedious it becomes.  For sheer<br/>
terror, you need to be on the edge and stretching your limits.  My high 20&#39;s<br/>
were loads more exciting than what I do now.  I am looking at some really<br/>
boring hours until I can get to 46+ and venture into the planes.<br/>
<br/>
But knowing where to go and what to kill and some of the techniques - really<br/>
helps alot.  Also having a good guild and regular group makes a world of<br/>
difference.<br/>

&gt; Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>
&gt; since about three weeks after release.  It simply blows my mind that<br/>
anyone<br/>
&gt; could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got<br/>
three<br/>
&gt; characters, each on a different server:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my first character ever)<br/>
&gt; Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>
&gt; Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>
&gt; I just have to know what the play time is on a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>
&gt; characters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>
&gt; than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?  I&#39;m not trolling...just<br/>
bloody<br/>
&gt; well amazed and curious (and obviously jealous).<br/>
