dropping in Najena. I&#39;d kill to get my hands on a rubi bp<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Najena was a zoo over the weekend.  It looked like most of the server&#39;s<br/>
post-50 retirees had come out of retirement to own the mid 20/30 Froglok<br/>
mobs.  Most spawns were double and triple camped and this little &#39;event&#39;<br/>
seemed to bring out the worst in people - there was a lot of KSing, farming<br/>
and ninja-looting going on.<br/>
<br/>
The place was so well camped, a level 1 newbie could have walked through the<br/>
entire zone with carefree audacity, safe in the knowledge that should<br/>
anything aggro on him/her, the aggressor would have been swiftly dispatched<br/>
by at least 6 high level players.<br/>
<br/>
At one point, one of the GMs popped on to have a word with the masses... I&#39;m<br/>
not sure what was said, because the person I asked looted Rubi gloves and<br/>
ran off before his group could roll for them.<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK, the breastplate doesn&#39;t drop.  I did see people with greaves, gloves<br/>
and helm.  I think boots and bracers were also dropping, but I can&#39;t be<br/>
sure.  People were having most luck from the named spawns in areas such as<br/>
the Bonecracker and Captain&#39;s rooms.<br/>
<br/>
What did I get for my 2-3 hours down there?  Two bunches of Whore&#39;s bane and<br/>
a lump of clay. :P<br/>
