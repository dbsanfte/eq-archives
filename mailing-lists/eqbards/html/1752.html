<div id="ygrps-yiv-241231917">Just to make sure: Area effect songs affect people in your group too in PVP <br/>
situations? If you&#39;re grouped with people and get jumped by some others, <br/>
Lament would work on your group too?<br/>
<br/>
Btw, how does something like Lullaby or Lament affect other players? Is it <br/>
sort of like being charmed for a bit? Or do they not work well on players <br/>
at all?<br/>
<br/>
No idea what you could solo, sorry. And congrats for reaching that level on <br/>
Rallos! Have any stories of how your songs helped in pvp situations? ;)<br/>

<br/>
 &lt;&lt; File: ATT00002.htm &gt;&gt; Hey all!<br/>
I am a level 28 bard on the Rallos Zek server.  I play some odd hours, wake <br/>
up in the middle of the night and need my EQ fix etc. : ) I would love <br/>
input into what I could possibly solo at my level.  I use a demon claw and <br/>
a tomahawk as weapons, and seem to use bellow alot in fights.  Also keep in <br/>
mind that since I am on PvP I can not use all songs the same way other <br/>
bards do.  If anyone is around my non-party spells effect them and I hate <br/>
to go around putting everyone to sleep all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
