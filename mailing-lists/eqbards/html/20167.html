<br/>
I am almost never the one originally inviting or leading, because I hate<br/>
being leader.  Call me lazy or whatever, but I would really rather have<br/>
someone else do it, assuming there is a competent person who is willing. <br/>
However, my groups tend not to see it this way.  No matter how much I try<br/>
to take the back seat, if the original &quot;leader&quot; ever leaves, 10:1 they<br/>
all decide that I will be the new leader, no and&#39;s, if&#39;s, or but&#39;s about<br/>
it.  I don&#39;t claim to be very knowledgeable, or a great leader (though I<br/>
*do* tend to take charge in a power vacuum, ask my guild :P), so I can<br/>
only think of one reason groups seem to want me to lead--I know when to<br/>
leave well enough alone.  <br/>
<br/>
If there is a problem, I will happily fix it and I will gladly resolve<br/>
any conflicts or whatnot in a diplomatic way, but if there isn&#39;t a<br/>
problem and the group is running great, I keep my mouth shut and let<br/>
everyone have fun.  No one especially likes other people telling them<br/>
what to do, and when people are comfortable doing their jobs, the whole<br/>
group has a better time.  Not that I have not asked people to change<br/>
tactics in some cases, or even kicked out threats to the group in others,<br/>
but I think most people like a leader who is in that in-between<br/>
area--neither bossy and overbearing nor too timid if changes need to be<br/>
made.<br/>
