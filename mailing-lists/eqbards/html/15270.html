<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591913242"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;Tim Burke&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tjohnburke@...">tjohnburke@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;tested this...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i can see anyone who is invis...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way I understood this from the patch message is that it wouldn&#39;t work <br/>
this way, but I went back and searched my logs to be sure I was right <br/>
because I specifically tested for this feature.  I found out why I thought <br/>
what I did. I was grouped with a friend specifically to test this song.  I <br/>
disbanded him from the group to see if I could still see him, at which <br/>
point, being the master tester I am I changed songs. That killed my invis, <br/>
which killed my see invis. :)<br/>
<br/>
D&#39;oh!<br/>
<br/>
I went back and checked with someone outside my group who could cast invis <br/>
and I could indeed see them whether they were grouped or not.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I inadvertantly deleted the email a few days ago from someone who <br/>
responded about this, but I want to state up front, being level 50 doesn&#39;t <br/>
affect my ability to make boneheaded testing decisions. If you think I&#39;m <br/>
wrong, my level should have nothing to do with whether you decide to speak <br/>
up or not.<br/>
