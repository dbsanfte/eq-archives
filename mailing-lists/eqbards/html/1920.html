&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, this debate has certainly heated things up.  Its clear there is an<br/>
&gt;easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not sure where you draw this line.... Please define it a little more so<br/>
&gt;I can figure out if you&#39;ve pre-classified me as a powergamer or a<br/>
&gt;roleplayer.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was speaking in general about some prior posts, so at that point hadn&#39;t<br/>
&#39;classified&#39; you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From your message, I believe you&#39;re talking about the Platemail<br/>
&gt;issue, but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  If so, I believe you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;labelling me as a powergamer, because, as I&#39;ve previously mentioned, I<br/>
&gt;believe our class is Balanced with the use of Plate in mind.  I believe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a Bard that doesn&#39;t use Plate is like a Monk that doesn&#39;t use his punch<br/>
&gt;because &quot;Every class can punch&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, can now classify you as a powergamer, since you plainly imply that<br/>
anyone who doesn&#39;t take the utmost advantage of the abilities of their class<br/>
is stupid, so we should all wear plate and all use the weapon combo that<br/>
numericaly deals the most damage per unit time.  so in real life no one<br/>
should drive red cars by your logic since they function as well as any other<br/>
and statistically get the most speeding tickets.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now, if that doesn&#39;t fit YOUR image of a<br/>
&gt;Bard, then you&#39;re more than free to take the AC hit and not wear it....<br/>
&gt;Please don&#39;t tell those of us that do choose to wear plate that we&#39;re<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wrong,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;or aren&#39;t roleplayers.  I am roleplaying the Bard class as Verant designed<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never said they were wrong, in fact plainly said I don&#39;t care but I wont,<br/>
and no you are taking the utmost advantage of the class as designed, no<br/>
eveidence you are roleplaying it just because you wear plate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>
&gt;image of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>
&gt;while sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bazooka too.  Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>
&gt;is moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard.  to me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;image is more important than being as effective as possible.  I kinda wish<br/>
&gt;they&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>
&gt;light armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>
&gt;even equal, just better than nothing.  If not, oh well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I like the idea of having some bard specific items.  Singing swords,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>magical<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;instruments, any of these would be great!  Most of the other classes seem<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;have items tailored towards them with the exception of bards.  Oh yeah sure<br/>
&gt;we can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>
&gt;like a monk, why would we?  It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt;could make better use of than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Bard&#39;s are Jack of All trades - Borrowing from many different classes.<br/>
&gt;We&#39;re different than monks, Monks have their own set of skills.  Ours are<br/>
&gt;part fighter, part rogue, part magical, part of many things.  I&#39;ll use any<br/>
&gt;weapon or skill that&#39;s available to me, that betters my class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, not much to complain about here, but by this logic shadowknights are<br/>
just warriors mixed with necromancers, why do they have shadowknight only<br/>
weapons?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>
&gt;The way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>
&gt;they should travel more than any other character.  To have to do this<br/>
&gt;without being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>
&gt;minstrel could bind himself anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I am wholeheartedly against Bind for Bards.  No other Hybrid gets this.<br/>
&gt;This is reserved for the pure casters.  Yes it would be nice to have, but<br/>
&gt;&quot;it&#39;d be nice to have a bazooka too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ummm, no other hybrid gets pick locks either, so they should probably take<br/>
that away too by your logic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I somewhat agreed with everything on the petition but the Bind and the Exp<br/>
&gt;issues.  I was a little bit peeved to see the petition ask for a bonus in<br/>
&gt;ability (Bind) that makes the class stronger, and at the same time ask for<br/>
&gt;less of an exp hit.... We are hybrids.  Hybrids have a penalty.  We can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tank<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and cast spells with our songs.... We get a penalty in Exp for that and we<br/>
&gt;should.  As far as soloing... Verant has always said this is a group game.<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t level any noticeably slower than my GF (High Elf Magician) who I<br/>
&gt;group with on EVERY kill.   So in groups, as Verant designed the game, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;been my exp that we&#39;re not really disadvantaged at all.  While Bards CAN<br/>
&gt;solo and DO solo, I believe Bards belong in a party.  If someone chooses to<br/>
&gt;solo, then they should take the extra penalties for doing so in a group<br/>
&gt;based game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Best part of your piece hands down.  While I disagree on the bind issue, I<br/>
too think we do not suffer from an overly large experience penalty.  I keep<br/>
up with the human monk I most often group with and do better soloing against<br/>
some critters than he does.  In groups he ends up taking most of the damage<br/>
since he deals out so much and wears no armor to speak of.  I have not seen<br/>
any real evidence we advance much slower than the average character,<br/>
although many bards are wood elves and wood elves advance slower than<br/>
humans.  But then why would you want to be a human and live in some smelly<br/>
stone city, yech!  Oops, sorry let my character run away with itself there,<br/>
no offense intended to our human readership.<br/>
