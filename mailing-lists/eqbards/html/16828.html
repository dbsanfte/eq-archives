<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829676854">actually omnipresent is everywhere omnipotrent is all powerful and<br/>
omniscient is all knowing.. personally I cant see how you can be one without<br/>
being the other two so perhaps your point was actually validated in the<br/>
first email without using the intended wordage. Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a point to be made that while some of us do not punctuate<br/>
properly to create visions of accurate grammer, that it is less a matter of<br/>
intellect or charisma and more a matter of sheer laziness than a lack of<br/>
said attributes.<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m not insinuating Harm thinks us all to be peons and imbeciles<br/>
only to clarify a point to those who may have misread his post on<br/>
capitilization.<br/>
<br/>
by the way personally I am too lazy to break out the thesaurus or<br/>
deictionary as I deinstalled word and every other app that I every placed on<br/>
this computer with a spell check and thus may have a few mistyped words in<br/>
the body of my text, as for the run-on sentence i&#39;ve managed to create, i<br/>
think that may have just been out of spite. also too lazy to capitilize as a<br/>
general rule.. and for some reason i acquired the awful habit of ending<br/>
sentences with two periods rather than one.. something i picked up on MUDS<br/>
to demonstrate that i always had some other thought on the current subject<br/>
floatin in my head but paused to think of something else and may have<br/>
changed subjects entirely during the course of the pause. its been a bear to<br/>
not use it in any professional emails and documents as i have begun to use<br/>
the subconsciously when i am thinking at the end of a sentence. that along<br/>
with abreviations. I once told a client over the phone I was going afk..<br/>
that was quite odd.<br/>
At any rate enough of the random ramblings of a bard.<br/>
