<div id="ygrps-yiv-634652814">Actually, theres a necro that roams around sometimes (high level, 55 or 56 I believe) and his pet will come up with sense undead.  What my guild has been doing is sitting over near that big drovlar temple/hall thingy and killin pretty much anything roaming near there (theres a spawn spot right in front of the hall) until it spawns..usually a long wait.  Uhm, to get to the hall, either follow the water to the right of the FV bridge until you get to it (no zones along the way I don&#39;t believe), or starting from the dreadlands tunnel or loio, go past the two Swamp zones until you get to it.  Good luck :)<br/>

  i parked my naked level 24 paladin in FV, logged on every so often and cast<br/>
  sense the dead.  if the AJ is up, it&#39;s the only undead mob in the zone.  if<br/>
  not, you won&#39;t sense anything.<br/>
<br/>
  Shada<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; But<br/>
  &gt; I was looking for the Ancient Jarsath in FV the other night <br/>
  &gt; (any hints?<br/>
  &gt; does he have a PH?)<br/>
