<div id="ygrps-yiv-242065521">I know that this is the case even for us higher leveled bards.  I recently<br/>
had the pleasure of grouping with severel level 30ish characters, while I am<br/>
only level 15 :) in the estate of unrest.  They were happy because I made<br/>
them fight better and bumped their magic and disease resistance a ton, using<br/>
the drum of course.  And I was happy because I walked away with 3-4 pieces<br/>
of bronze plate as well as a bloodstained mantle several fine steel weapons<br/>
and many plat just from looting.  All in all it was an amazing evening and<br/>
very profitable.  The only negative was this was the first time I recieved<br/>
NO exp when grouping withhigher level players.  I guess they were just too<br/>
high.  heh oh well it was still worth it in my mind since after I sold all<br/>
the FS weapons I had plenty to puchase a dragoon dirk.  woohoo incredible<br/>
weapon, which, thanks to JM Capozzi&#39;s post about the soon to be increase in<br/>
their rarity, caused me to buy one, even if only for the turn around profit<br/>
that there is sure to be.<br/>

&gt; Greetings Weiland,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am not an expert at making money, but I have a<br/>
&gt; friend who is.  Here is some of the advise that he<br/>
&gt; gives me.  I&#39;m not loot hungry so I probably won&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; it and it seems like you are not either, but it will<br/>
&gt; atleast help you get your banded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First of all make sure you are hunting a loot heavy<br/>
&gt; zone.  What I mean is since you are lvl 11, the best<br/>
&gt; place for you would be either Crushbone(Kelethin) or<br/>
&gt; Splitpaw (South Karanas) or of course the Derv camps.<br/>
&gt; I myself am not a big derv fan, because of all the<br/>
&gt; camping.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next make sure you find a party that is high enough<br/>
&gt; level to not care about loot in that zone.  For<br/>
&gt; example find a party of lvl 16+ that will take you in<br/>
&gt; as an understudy.  That way they will  let you loot<br/>
&gt; practically everything that comes their way, because<br/>
&gt; they probably care more about the exp.  Make sure you<br/>
&gt; let them know, that these are your intentions.  This<br/>
&gt; is a an effective, but seldom used technique.  I have<br/>
&gt; done it a few times and I made about 15-20pp a night.<br/>
&gt; But it got old.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally don&#39;t leave out anything, sell everything.  I<br/>
&gt; have seen a lot of people get shoulder pads, or<br/>
&gt; legionnaire belts or rustys, and I&#39;ve seen them just<br/>
&gt; leave it on the corpse.  DON&#39;T!  It all adds up.  Just<br/>
&gt; keep collecting and selling, keep collecting and<br/>
&gt; selling.  It takes discipline, but in about 3-4 days<br/>
&gt; you will be able to afford a full suit of banded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh and one last thing, if you are hunting in<br/>
&gt; Crushbone.  Make sure you sell at the Warror&#39;s guild<br/>
&gt; in kelethin, they give great prices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok I hope that helps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Farewell,<br/>

&gt; Hail and well met again,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I am requesting the assistance of some of you yet<br/>
&gt; again.  Tonight I<br/>
&gt; finally made the 11th rank.  We were in W. Commons<br/>
&gt; killing the Derv&#39;s<br/>
&gt; when lo and behold a werewolf arrived and decimated<br/>
&gt; all but 2 of us,<br/>
&gt; myself and a ranger friend.  Upon zoning to E. Commons<br/>
&gt; and then<br/>
&gt; returning to the Bard&#39;s guild, I came to the<br/>
&gt; realization that I needed<br/>
&gt; &quot;real&quot; armor.  Up to this point, I have been wearing<br/>
&gt; all leather.  It<br/>
&gt; is affordable and light but is not as effective<br/>
&gt; against the Derv&#39;s and<br/>
&gt; such.  I NEED BANDED!!!<br/>
&gt;     And now on to my problem, where do I pick up the<br/>
&gt; plat to buy this<br/>
&gt; wonderful armor?  I seem to only make around 5 pp a<br/>
&gt; night at best.<br/>
&gt; Would joining a guild help me in this situation?  If<br/>
&gt; so does anyone no<br/>
&gt; any good guilds on Erollisi Marr?  I&#39;ve taken to<br/>
&gt; fighting darkweeds but<br/>
&gt; there is far too much downtime.  The orc cents in my<br/>
&gt; area have very<br/>
&gt; little loot, so soloing in this area is pretty<br/>
&gt; worthless.  The derv&#39;s<br/>
&gt; have lovely loot, but I am afraid of grouping with<br/>
&gt; people I don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;  Especially in a zone like W. Commons.  Tonight they<br/>
&gt; actually attacked<br/>
&gt; the werewolf!!<br/>
&gt; Yesterday someone in my group decided, despite my<br/>
&gt; warnings, to walk up<br/>
&gt; and slap Lord Shin Ree.  What should I do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you in advance for your advice,<br/>
&gt; Weiland of Freeport<br/>
&gt; 11th Rank Bard of Erollisi Marr<br/>
