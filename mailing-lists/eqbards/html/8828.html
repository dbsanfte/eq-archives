<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032201518">Yup, you are correct.  If you charmed a mob to kill another and your pet is <br/>
doing most of the damage, you HAVE to have your pet in charmed mode when the <br/>
other one dies.  The reason is the stronger mob was doing most of the damage <br/>
and game remembers that, so when the weaker mob die, it will credit the <br/>
stronger mob for the kill and if the stronger mob is not charmed at that <br/>
time, your party will not get any xp and the weaker mob will poof.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is Pixie Strike is not broken.  It just won&#39;t work against <br/>
some of the mob like HG or Cyclops.  They have a natural immunity to stun, <br/>
mes, or pixie strike type of spells.  I don&#39;t know if this was introduced <br/>
after the recent patch or what, but one of the enchanter from my guild told <br/>
us that she can no longer Mes a HG.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not certain, but I think that corpses only go *poof*<br/>
&gt; &gt; when the mob dies and the thing you&#39;ve been charming to<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill it is not currently charmed.  They check to see who<br/>
&gt; &gt; did the most damage, and since the thing that did the most<br/>
&gt; &gt; is an unaligned NPC, *poof*.<br/>
