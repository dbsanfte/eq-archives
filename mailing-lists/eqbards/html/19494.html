<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] A recap of the 6/6 patch. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-112919713">Thanks for the breakdown Rokenn!  My thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of Bard news from yesterday&#39;s patch.  Of course as usual none of the<br/>
changes were listed in the patch message (Gordon if you read this put a big<br/>
yellow post-it note on your computer monitor that reads: &#39;ANY BARD CHANGES?&#39;<br/>
*grin*).  Anyway here is the good, bad, and the ugly:<br/>
<br/>
The Good<br/>
Ah at last a reason to go buy a Psalm ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The Bad<br/>
ACK!  Chains was a big time annoyance for me last nite.  This nerf did hit<br/>
hard.  My mobs went from stopping at 33% or so to stopping at 25% to 20%.<br/>
<br/>
The Ugly<br/>
Kellin&#39;s has been referred to our testing department.<br/>
*About time, lets hope they fix lullaby this time.<br/>
Let&#39;s hope so.  Pulled it out after the patch as usual to try it again.  Got<br/>
80% resists on a mobs 15 levels below me.  Useless, dememmed immediately.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Broken Quest Issues&quot; are not broken quests. They are preexisting<br/>
stories for future expansion.<br/>
*Not sure if this applies to Fabian or not.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don&#39;t buy this answer.  These partial quests have been around<br/>
forever.  You wouldn&#39;t think there would be much story behind replacing a<br/>
guy&#39;s lute strings anyhow.<br/>
