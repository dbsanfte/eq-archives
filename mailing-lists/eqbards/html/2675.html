<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-920126777">I actually do have a bit of musical talent.  I have competed in several Barbershop<br/>
Quartet contests and done quite well, I have been accepted to All State choirs two<br/>
years in a row, at one time I performed in 10 different groups at once one of which<br/>
was a show choir (dance and sing stuff) I was also the Drum Major of my high school<br/>
marching band.  Musics is in my blood I guess and being a bard seemed only natural<br/>
to me personally.<br/>

&gt; Most of the musical abilities of bard is  game has nothing to do with what<br/>
&gt; musical training I have :-) My lyrics are shotty at best, but it doesn&#39;t stop me<br/>
&gt; from trying!  Two years of college music playing brass instruments-- everything<br/>
&gt; from Mozart to Ska and back again :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; So we are all real good online Bards and have excellent musical abilities to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the point of powerful magic, etc.  But what about in /ooc real life? Anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; have any talent or interest?<br/>
