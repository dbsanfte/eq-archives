the same results after having her cast a spell afterwards and it dropped the<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know what everyone has said on this subject of the Jig not helping<br/>
mana<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I have done my own tests. My exgirlfriend has a highelf enchanter<br/>
and we<br/>
&gt; &gt; tested that rumor out. I had her meditate for 15 mins to make sure she<br/>
had a<br/>
&gt; &gt; total bar of mana. had her cast chaotic feedback a major DD spell on her<br/>
&gt; &gt; self till she was out of mana. then i we timed how long it took her to<br/>
&gt; &gt; meditate. it took about 5 mins for her to get a full mana bar back at<br/>
lvl 18<br/>
&gt; &gt; with her wearing 0 int and mana giving items. we did it again and this<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; &gt; i sang the Jig and timed it once again this time it took about 4 mins<br/>
&gt; &gt; 13seconds to get the mana bar back up. so it does help slightly. My<br/>
theory<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did you have her cast a spell afterwards to see if that mana<br/>
&gt; was real?  There&#39;s a phantom mana bug with Clarity, where<br/>
&gt; sometimes the mana bar will appear to fill faster than your<br/>
&gt; real mana.  But when you cast a spell, the server sends the<br/>
&gt; client the correct amount, and that first spell seems to use a<br/>
&gt; lot more mana than it should.  This is a client/server synch<br/>
&gt; problem of undetermined origin, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if<br/>
&gt; our other songs could cause it.<br/>
