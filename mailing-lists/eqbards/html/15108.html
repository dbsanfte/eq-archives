<div id="ygrps-yiv-788751756">Actually, I&#39;ve found with sense heading, wisdom seems more of a bonus<br/>
than int, because sense heading skill only improves when it&#39;s<br/>
successful, unlike most other skills. And, wisdom definately seems to<br/>
make a difference with it improving. The easiest way I&#39;ve found to deal<br/>
with sense heading is to not waste time on it until you can dump 20 odd<br/>
points into it. That usually means around L5 or 6. Then start mashing it<br/>
while medding or resting. At least with wisdom casters like my druid and<br/>
cleric, this method seems much less painful than I remember it was for<br/>
my bard. IIRC, with my bard I used to fish and practice sense heading.<br/>
It went up a lot slower and the fishing wasn&#39;t worth the time spent on<br/>
it, unlike in beta when not only could fishing be slightly profitable<br/>
but you also had a cool social scene around the docks.<br/>

&gt; Atually I&#39;ll probably use that a lot on my troll shaman ( currently level<br/>
&gt; 21 ) because his intell is so low. It&#39;s just a pain hitting the skill over<br/>
&gt; and over.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;wouldn&#39;t bother complaining about it though, or they&#39;d probably replace<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;it with a new find true north song. Then they&#39;d probably fill in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;missing songs with find true east, find true west and find true south.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Note that the spell they replaced with True North, Sense Magic, is a<br/>
&gt; &gt;lvl 1, MAYBE lvl 4/5 spell. It did NOTHING before. Now, if you are<br/>
&gt; &gt;young, it will be a useful spell. Sure, you don&#39;t want it if you are<br/>
&gt; &gt;now lvl 49 (except to train that skill perhaps) But how many<br/>
&gt; &gt;people still use Flame Lick at lvl 49 either?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think Verant really did improve Sense Magic, for the levels that<br/>
&gt; &gt;spell is put in at. I work to max Sense Heading first thing when I<br/>
&gt; &gt;create a new character. 1) it takes forever. Only in lvl 8, when<br/>
&gt; &gt;I had to travel across the continent and used SEnse Heading every<br/>
&gt; &gt;time it came up, did my bard FINALLY max Sense Heading. And even<br/>
&gt; &gt;maxxed, its not very consistent yet. At levels 1-4, your MAX<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sense heading, after all, is 10-25... And sometimes it can be useful to<br/>
&gt; &gt;know. Just because you stay in your newbie area at that time does not mean<br/>
&gt; &gt;that everyone is.<br/>
