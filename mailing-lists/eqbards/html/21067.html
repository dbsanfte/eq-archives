Pretty sad that it takes basically a couple of months before they will come<br/>
out and say &quot;Sorry we nerfed it&quot;.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Prior to your patch of the level 54 AE Snare song, the lower level Chains<br/>
 </span></blockquote>song (level 23), for high level Bards, was able to stop a SINGLE damaged MOB<br/>
dead in its tracks at 50% health. In order to do this, considering the high<br/>
resist rate and the early break problem, Bards had to devote ALL of their<br/>
casting to doing this one thing and this one thing alone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;We know that green MOBs that run run at 50% health, and that blue MOBs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that run run at 25%. After the change, the song does not stop MOBs dead in<br/>
their tracks until 20%. This means that, prior to the level 54 patch, Bards<br/>
could stop ALL runners. Post the level 54 patch, Bards can stop NO runners.<br/>
We CAN&#39;T STOP TRAINS now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The change that was implemented about two months ago placed a cap on the<br/>
maximum amount that a creature can be slowed prior to the addition of<br/>
damage. At the time, the people making that change didn&#39;t think that it<br/>
would affect any other spells or songs than the 54th level song. After it<br/>
did, and due to the complaints here, we tested the song in depth, and<br/>
determined that the way it was working before was far too powerful. The<br/>
current functionality that you are describing is the correct functionality<br/>
for the spell.<br/>
