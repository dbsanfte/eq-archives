<div id="ygrps-yiv-506555300">I have yet another bard project going *sigh* I know I know, I could possibly<br/>
be addicted to the class. At any rate, I went to the Field of Bone at 8,<br/>
bringing only my level 9 song, surely I would die before 10 and could grab<br/>
Anthem from my bankbox in Firiona Vie then. Well, I did have to make a trip<br/>
back to Kelethin to train dodge, but I am now level 11 and have yet to die.<br/>
Field of bone is great, highly recommended for 9-12. Hunt the area between<br/>
the Swamp zone and the pit for 8 and 9, the pit itself for 10-11. <br/>
I have also been taking the oportunity to sing some Iksar folks songs in<br/>
/shout, to mixed reviews, they are not a very musical race (they attribute<br/>
this to having no ears). Here are a few I have found so far:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s what makes you not a mammal<br/>
That makes you dear to me<br/>
Your color patches are my favorite fun<br/>
When your flashing red and yellow<br/>
For all the world to see<br/>
My heart starts beating like I&#39;m layin<br/>
on a hot rock in the sun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another:<br/>
<br/>
Your lips are soft,so soft my love, <br/>
it&#39;s almost as if you are molting<br/>
My battle scars, and slight fungus collection<br/>
must surely leave you shy unto bolting<br/>
But you caught my eye e&#39;en before you grew limbs<br/>
and I set out to win you or die<br/>
And I built you this nest, and just look at these grubs!<br/>
Oh please wag your tail or I&#39;ll cry<br/>
