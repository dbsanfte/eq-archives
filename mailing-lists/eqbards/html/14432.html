<div id="ygrps-yiv-992061531">I was showing off for some newbie friends once at the chessboard in BB and I<br/>
charmed a skeletal knight and told it to sit down.  We all got a good laugh<br/>
and I said, &quot;when it stands back up, attack it...if you get in trouble I&#39;ll<br/>
recharm it and let you heal up.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Well, the skeleton broke charm and my two friends proceeded to beat the<br/>
marrow of it.  Keep in mind I have not struck the skeleton one, just charmed<br/>
it.  The fight lasted about a minute and the skeleton never stopped hitting<br/>
me the whole time...it had absolutely no concern whatsoever that there were<br/>
two con green PCs standing behind it killing it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hmmmmm....&quot; I thought, and I helped my two friends get to their next level<br/>
killing one yellow after another.<br/>
<br/>
I think charm has mem blur, doesn&#39;t it? I once saved myself from a KSing<br/>
nuker in Highkeep by charming the gobbie he was trying to nuke while I was<br/>
meleeing.  Not knowing what was going on  he continued to blow mana on it,<br/>
then I let it break charm and finished it off.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Q: Is Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (Lvl 15) supposed to have a <br/>
&gt; memory blur <br/>
&gt; &gt; component?<br/>
&gt; &gt; A: Nope.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Follow up: The old spell lists from Beta indicate that <br/>
&gt; Lullaby nix&#39;d the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hate list.  And in the first few months of retail it did so <br/>
&gt; as well (work <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as I could tell, this song never had a memory blur<br/>
&gt; component.  Its taunt effect was sufficient to pull mobs off<br/>
&gt; others in most cases, but I never had an instance where I<br/>
&gt; could &quot;rescue&quot; a random player being beat up by a mob by<br/>
&gt; simply pulsing this song once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Q: Ok this is a personal question and probably completely <br/>
&gt; trivial, the <br/>
&gt; &gt; enameled black chestplate from lower guk is a black plate <br/>
&gt; that is wearable <br/>
&gt; &gt; by all the plate wearing classes except Bard. I wear an <br/>
&gt; inferior black plate <br/>
&gt; &gt; because I like the black plate look, can this plate be made <br/>
&gt; available to <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bards?<br/>
&gt; &gt; A: No reason. I changed it so that Bards can use it too - <br/>
&gt; should be in this <br/>
&gt; &gt; patch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This actually went in a couple patches ago.  I noticed it when<br/>
&gt; my paladin friend listed off the stats on a BE BP we got from<br/>
&gt; the Savant a couple weeks ago.<br/>
