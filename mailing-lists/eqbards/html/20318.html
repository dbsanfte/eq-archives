know.<br/>

p.s. I have been having some problems with folks on auto-follow and my Selos<br/>
drum.  With 2 PC&#39;s side-by-side, I see the follower getting &quot;lost&quot; and<br/>
spinning in circles quite a bit at times.  So, I have taken to swapping in<br/>
my lute for long distance running with someone on auto-follow and that seems<br/>
to help.   Also, I have problems with folks if I try to follow them and have<br/>
selo&#39;s song with selo&#39;s drum going as they start running.  Typically, I say:<br/>
&quot;You lead, I&#39;ll speed.&quot;  They do a quick 360 degree spin to look around, see<br/>
they wanna go 90 degrees left or right of the way they are facing and take<br/>
off like a rocket.  They instantly vanish from my sight thus starting a<br/>
session of: &quot;Lost you!&quot;; &quot;What&#39;s your loc?&quot;; &quot;Did you move?&quot;; &quot;What&#39;s your<br/>
loc now?&quot;; &quot;Stop moving, damnit. Gimme your loc now.&quot; So, maybe a &#39;slower&#39;<br/>
drum for group travel would be worth carrying around.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Anyhow, I screamed:<br/>
&quot;KILL THIS NOW!!!!&quot; And a few short moments later, looted the Sharkskin<br/>
Drum.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Wow, congrats! How does it look when equipped?<br/>
