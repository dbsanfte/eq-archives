&gt; Here is what I know about using the Mystic Clouding song:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It works verses all creatures including undead (AND your fellow group<br/>
&gt; mates), HOWEVER, there are some creatures that can innately see<br/>
&gt; invisible...which ones those are, I do not know, but there are apparently<br/>
&gt; some that can.  (As a matter of fact, does anyone know which creatures in<br/>
&gt; the game can innately see invisible?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The strange behavior with the invis song is that if any member of the<br/>
party<br/>
&gt; does ANYTHING to drop their invis like cast a spell, or are in Auto Attack<br/>
&gt; mode (whether actually attacking or not) and another mob targets them,<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; that mob will see everyone else in the party regardless of whether they<br/>
&gt; appear to be invisible or not.  One member of your group on a monster&#39;s<br/>
shit<br/>
&gt; list adds everyone in your group to that monster&#39;s shit list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Every tick of the invis song causes a skill check to be made and every now<br/>
&gt; and then a character will fail, and turn visible for a single tick, until<br/>
&gt; the next tick of the song and then they pop invisible again.  While this<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; uncommon, it does happen, and during that tick of visibility, if you are<br/>
&gt; near enough to a mob to be noticed and targeted, invis is shot for the<br/>
whole<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This seems to fall under the group hate thing...where a bard singing Hymn<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &quot;helping&quot; the members of his party (like the puller for example) so the<br/>
mob<br/>
&gt; targets the bard - just like when a cleric heals another group member it<br/>
&gt; often attracts the monster&#39;s attention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But all alone with the mino horn and a skill of 105 in wind I sang<br/>
Clouding<br/>
&gt; and wandered all over the first 3 floors of the Unrest mansion invisible,<br/>
&gt; checking it all out...at one point the 2 hags from the basement walked<br/>
RIGHT<br/>
&gt; past me through the hall and just about made my heart jump out my throat,<br/>
&gt; but did not see me at all.  This is a fun song to play with.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A similar thing happened to me twice when I was camping<br/>
&gt; &gt; behind the back<br/>
&gt; &gt; porch.  One time, my group was resting after a fight.  I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; been using<br/>
&gt; &gt; Denon&#39;s Discord during the previous fight.  While everyone is<br/>
&gt; &gt; resting, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; back door opens up and a festering hag makes a beeline<br/>
&gt; &gt; towards me.  Next<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing I know she zaps me for 300+ hit points and I&#39;m dead.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bug with the  axis whatever is it something that Verant is<br/>
&gt; &gt; aware of and is<br/>
&gt; &gt; working on fixing?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;snipped from earlier post by Faras&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Last night in Unrest I camped off the side porch<br/>
&gt; &gt; because there was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion that singing songs off the back porch might<br/>
&gt; &gt; be affecting<br/>
&gt; &gt; mobs in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the basement due to an unlimited Z axis affect bug.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; also did not<br/>
&gt; &gt; stand<br/>
&gt; &gt; around and sing songs while our puller was in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; house...I waited<br/>
&gt; &gt; until our<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill was brought to the fence and whacked once or twice and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; kicked in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my playlist.  This worked awesome and I did not die once.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t think the bards invis song worked against undead.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; know for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact I have been attacked by zombies before while singing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; song.  Can<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone clarify this please.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the people I group with generally recognize<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I do a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard, shuffling instruments and weapons, jumping in and out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; physical<br/>
&gt; &gt; melee, playing a variety of different songs, some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;simultaneously&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they also recognize the benefit of our songs because I tell them<br/>
&gt; &gt; things like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;check out your magic resist&quot; and get the &quot;wholly<br/>
&gt; &gt; crap!&quot; or invis<br/>
&gt; &gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; while they are medding and they are amazed that it works against<br/>
&gt; &gt; undead too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Our party was sitting against the fence medding and watching a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Festering Hag<br/>
&gt; &gt; run around the yard wasting people, finally being<br/>
&gt; &gt; killed by a group<br/>
&gt; &gt; only 15<br/>
&gt; &gt; feet away from us - we watched the whole thing as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; group leader<br/>
&gt; &gt; nervously<br/>
&gt; &gt; commented &quot;don&#39;t stop singing that song Faras...&quot;<br/>
