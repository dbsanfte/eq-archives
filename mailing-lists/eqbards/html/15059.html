<b>Subject:</b> Hello! and Looking for advice on Mask of Deception <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-661705704">Hello all!<br/>
I have been reading this list for about 3 months now and thanks to you all I have a level 15 half-bard and am absolutly loving him. This is a very helpful,fun, and informative list. Seeing that I just reached 15 I would love to try on a mask of deception. I looked through the archives and did not find much. Would anyone please point me in the way of current info on this or maybe give me some suggestions as I take on the mission for it this weekend. I know that basically I need to find my way down to lower guk and ask to loot it off the ghoul assassin there that it is a common drop on. I&#39;m scared to death though. Should I go naked and maybe bring a mandolin to sing heal for a group? Any advice would be awesome.<br/>
A fellow bard who feels at home thanks to all the advice that this list pours into my inbox each day,<br/>
