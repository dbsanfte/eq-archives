<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417701041">We bought a harware firewall (they are cheap and it is a little more<br/>
efficient), as well it acts as a hub.<br/>
<br/>
We have a UMAX UGate 3000 (its a firewall/hub combo for use with a<br/>
cable/ADSL modem)<br/>
 and I can open up by port and not have to totally expose the host to play<br/>
EQ.<br/>

No compliants with EQ .. UO was unreliable tho.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] OT: Recommendation for a home firewall<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if any of you out there are using firewall software in<br/>
&gt; conjunction with EQ.  I currently use Microsoft Internet Connection<br/>
sharing<br/>
&gt; on my home network, but havent installed any firewall software at all, and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; am a bit nervous about that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any recommendations?  I am currently looking at WinRoute Pro as a<br/>
solution.<br/>
