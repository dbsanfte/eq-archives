&gt;full. He is a tough fight even at 50 to solo. The item goes in the neck<br/>
&gt;slot. I was surprised to see some people use this item, everyone I know<br/>
&gt;that melees uses a gold black pearl necklace (if not a mithril torque<br/>
&gt;pal/rng/sk) and considers this &quot;cape&quot; to be a P.O.S.. ;P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not to seem terribly argumentative, but i thought that tanks didn&#39;t wear it<br/>
because they _can&#39;t_.  If you look at a screenshot, you would see that the Cape<br/>
Clr, Dru, Shm, Wiz, Nec, Enc, Mag, Brd.  Since the Cape does not provide<br/>
Wisdom, Int or MANA, it is by default Bard Only [since none of the other<br/>
classes listed would want it].  But, the GBP Choker gives +7 AGI and +7 Dex,<br/>
vs. the 2AC, +5 STR, +7 sv magic.  I personally feel that the Cape is a<br/>
superior item.  the 7 AGI might compensate for the 2AC, but the 5 STR and 7 MR<br/>
is IMHO superior to the 7 DEX.  I have several friends who play tanks, and have<br/>
complained several times that they thought it was unfair that I was wearing a<br/>
Cape, and they couldn&#39;t.  Also, i know for a fact that the Butler can be soloed<br/>
by a lvl 32 druid (considering that is how i got mine).  According to the druid<br/>
in question, it was an &quot;easy&quot; solo.  (ie-easier than the ancient croc in uguk)<br/>
<br/>
With the exception of the Runed Lava Pendant, and the Mithril Torque, the Cape<br/>
is probably the best neckpiece in the game for bards, and tanks would wear it<br/>
if they were able.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
