<div id="ygrps-yiv-223350318">I find a similar problem with the /who command finding fellow guild<br/>
members, my guild name is &lt;Lords of Chaos&gt; and when I do a /who all Lords<br/>
it will show me a list of all my guild friends who are on but are not anon.<br/>
This is fine, but the problem is when I am in the same zone as fellow guild<br/>
members and I do a /who Lords then nothing comes up, why is this??<br/>

I&#39;ve always thought of it as more of a smirk.  As in, &quot;I wonder if he<br/>
realizes just how dumb a bard looks carrying around a skull on a stick.<br/>
Probably not.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Gak! I was just copying what was from the previous email. Just too busy<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; keep up on the list and &quot;proofread&quot; previously written email. Oh well.<br/>
Now<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have to go and apologize to my own Staff of Writhing for the blunder. I<br/>
&gt; wonder if he&#39;ll still smile at me like he always does. :-)<br/>
