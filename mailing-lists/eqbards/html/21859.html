Kaearia has a couple of comments in the thread.  Part of the one I referred<br/>
to is pasted below:<br/>

I&#39;ve never felt any of the folks working on EQ were particularly strong in<br/>
the math department. I won&#39;t attribute to malice what can be explained by<br/>
stupidity. This game is going to be killed because of that stupidity once<br/>
some reasonable competition appears. I don&#39;t see much point in trying to<br/>
argue with a rock about esoteric game balance issues, and am just glad to<br/>
see some resolution of the less esoteric ones. <br/>

Ugh. Well obviously if you can&#39;t convince them with cold, hard statistics <br/>
then I guess that would encourage ranting.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a copy of his post (or a url to it) I&#39;d appreciate reading what <br/>
he said. Sounds like bad news to me though.<br/>

&gt;no, that&#39;s not me.  of course kaearia posted on the concert hall that he <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have a lot of problems with the way verant is handling the issues either, <br/>
&gt;at least<br/>
&gt;with regard to gordon&#39;s monster post.<br/>
