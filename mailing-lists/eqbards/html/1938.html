<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-772844382">Very long post, please ignore if you&#39;re bored by this thread already.  This will be my last post on this thread in a public forum.  If Kitari wishes to respond here, I don&#39;t mind, if I have anything to say I will respond directly.  (I don&#39;t want Kitari or anything thinking I have to have the last word so feel free to respond here.  I do feel I need to respond to this particular post in the public forum since that is where I believe I&#39;ve been wrongly labelled)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;Well, this debate has certainly heated things up. Its clear there is an<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;I&#39;m not sure where you draw this line.... Please define it a little more so<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;I can figure out if you&#39;ve pre-classified me as a powergamer or a<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;roleplayer. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I was speaking in general about some prior posts, so at that point hadn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
    &#39;classified&#39; you.<br/>
<br/>
    At that point.  But it&#39;s clear that you now HAVE classified me.  Because I choose to wear plate.  Silly, really.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;From your message, I believe you&#39;re talking about the Platemail<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;issue, but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. If so, I believe you&#39;re<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;labelling me as a powergamer, because, as I&#39;ve previously mentioned, I<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;believe our class is Balanced with the use of Plate in mind. I believe<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;that a Bard that doesn&#39;t use Plate is like a Monk that doesn&#39;t use his punch<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;because &quot;Every class can punch&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Ok, can now classify you as a powergamer, since you plainly imply that<br/>
<br/>
    anyone who doesn&#39;t take the utmost advantage of the abilities of their class<br/>
<br/>
    is stupid, so we should all wear plate and all use the weapon combo that<br/>
<br/>
    numericaly deals the most damage per unit time. so in real life no one<br/>
<br/>
    should drive red cars by your logic since they function as well as any other<br/>
<br/>
    and statistically get the most speeding tickets.<br/>
<br/>
    I believe what I said was, &quot;I believe that a Bard that doesn&#39;t use Plate is like a Monk that doesn&#39;t use his punch because &quot;Every class can punch&quot;.&quot;  Not sure where I imply stupidity, since I&#39;ve always felt that it&#39;s every persons opinion to do what&#39;s right for them.  I&#39;m making a comparison, not a judgement.  I&#39;m telling you MY opinion on something, what I think about it, but I believe I stop short of making any judgements.  Now of course the quoted part itself was trying to illustrate a point with something that was said previous, but I didn&#39;t save the previous emails, so I can&#39;t illustrate it clearer now.  Now, on the other hand, you HAVE made judgement on me, assuming I am a powergamer because I take the utmost advantage of my class.  I guess you should define Powergaming then, since I don&#39;t see how this has anything to do with it.  And it&#39;s my personal opinion, that a person&#39;s decision to wear plate or not has nothing to do with being a powergamer.  Would a powergamer wear plate?  Yup, I&#39;m sure they would.  But common logic does not mean that the opposite works.  Plate wearers are powergamers.  That&#39;s incorrect.  And that&#39;s what I believe you suggested.  I believe roleplaying reasons for wearing plate HAVE been suggested, but I don&#39;t believe that a person has to have a roleplaying reason to wear plate.  Not in this game.  Not in Verant&#39;s world.  This fantasy world was created in someone else&#39;s mind.  I roleplay my character in that world.  I use the rules of that world to roleplay my character.  I don&#39;t try to redefine the world, I don&#39;t argue with the world, my character has the strengths and powers and abilities that were defined for him.  Kind of like some of a real persons abilities and strengths were defined when they were born.  Now, people are free to go against their abilities.... For example, let&#39;s say I was born with absolutely NO musical talent.  I could choose to become a musician, struggling all the way.  I love the idea of being a musician but I don&#39;t excell at it.  I fight against the no musical talent and I end up being a fairly good musician.  No rock star, but I satisfy myself.  That would be wonderful.  And if that was my dream, all the more power to me.  But, if instead I saw that I sucked at music and I decided to become a doctor instead, I was much more suited to being a doctor, that was where my strengths were.  Now, which is right and which is wrong?  Neither.  Both are valid, both are right.  Both are individual&#39;s choices.  I, personally, would choose to be the doctor instead of the musician in this example... I like to be successful at what I do.  I use my talents to the best of my abilities and try to be the best person I can.  Does that make me a &quot;Real Life Powergamer&quot;?  I play games the same way.  I play by the rules of the game and immerse myself there.  Logic and reason be damned.  &quot;How can a bard play a Mandolin with Plate Gloves?&quot;  God, I have no freakin clue in this world... But, when I get into the game, I don&#39;t question Verant&#39;s design.  And here&#39;s my point, I DO NOT HAVE TO!  It does not make me a powergamer by accepting things as they are and bettering myself.  It does not mean I do not roleplay if I play within the system!  No matter how YOU feel about the system and how it fits into YOUR roleplaying.  To insinuate, no, to directly SAY that someone is not a roleplayer, they are a powergamer, because they choose to wear plate, and you don&#39;t, is absolutely wrong.  Here I will make a judgement.  It&#39;s stupid.<br/>
<br/>
    If you expect me to live by your rules you&#39;ve created, then please define them so I might have a chance.  I believe I&#39;m living by Verant&#39;s rule in EQ, tho.<br/>
<br/>
    BTW, I drive a RED car and I&#39;ve gotten DOZENS of tickets in it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;Now, if that doesn&#39;t fit YOUR image of a<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;Bard, then you&#39;re more than free to take the AC hit and not wear it....<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;Please don&#39;t tell those of us that do choose to wear plate that we&#39;re<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;wrong, or aren&#39;t roleplayers. I am roleplaying the Bard class as Verant designed<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Never said they were wrong, in fact plainly said I don&#39;t care but I wont,<br/>
<br/>
    and no you are taking the utmost advantage of the class as designed, no<br/>
<br/>
    eveidence you are roleplaying it just because you wear plate.<br/>
<br/>
    No, you didn&#39;t say they were wrong, that&#39;s my mistake.  You said they were powergamers and I&#39;ll go out on a limb here and say that you implied it was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
    Yes, I am taking advantage of (Actually, I&#39;m PLAYING) the class as designed and no, that doesn&#39;t make me a roleplayer either.  But it also doesn&#39;t make me NOT a roleplayer.  You can pick and choose as my quality of roleplaying all you want, but NOT on whether I choose to wear plate or not.  Wearing plate has nothing to do with it.  It&#39;s not even a consideration.  You choose the plate issue as part of YOUR roleplaying.  I have NO problem with that.  Just don&#39;t shove that choice down my throat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;image of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see, and<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;while sure its nice to be able to absorb more damage, it&#39;d be nice to have<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    a bazooka too. Whether bards can ultimately wear plate or not at some point<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;is moot to me, I won&#39;t &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t fit my image of a bard. to me<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    that image is more important than being as effective as possible. I kinda wish<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;they&#39;d institute something similar to the monk&#39;s increased AC when wearing<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;light armor for bards as an option, not necessarily better than plate or<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;even equal, just better than nothing. If not, oh well.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;I like the idea of having some bard specific items. Singing swords, magical<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;instruments, any of these would be great! Most of the other classes seem<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;to have items tailored towards them with the exception of bards. Oh yeah sure<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;we can use some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon, but so can a monk, and just<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;like a monk, why would we? It&#39;d sure be nice to see something that bard&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;could make better use of than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;Bard&#39;s are Jack of All trades - Borrowing from many different classes.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;We&#39;re different than monks, Monks have their own set of skills. Ours are<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;part fighter, part rogue, part magical, part of many things. I&#39;ll use any<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;weapon or skill that&#39;s available to me, that betters my class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Ok, not much to complain about here, but by this logic shadowknights are<br/>
<br/>
    just warriors mixed with necromancers, why do they have shadowknight only<br/>
<br/>
    weapons?<br/>
<br/>
    I have nothing against Bard only weapons.  They&#39;d be great to have.  It&#39;d make the class much more distinct.  Shadowknights have them, Paladins do, even Rangers.  But, would I use a Bard only weapon if I found &quot;some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon&quot; to be better?  Hell no, I wouldn&#39;t.  I&#39;d hang the Bard only weapon on my wall as a memento, and go squash Lady Vox with the warrior weapon.  Monks happen to be better WITHOUT a weapon at all... That&#39;s why they wouldn&#39;t use &quot;some warrior&#39;s castoff magic weapon&quot;... not because it doesn&#39;t suit their roleplaying of a monk.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;On most of the other issues I&#39;m pretty close to neutral except for binding.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;The way I see a bard, and certainly the way Verant seems to portray them,<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;they should travel more than any other character. To have to do this<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;without being able to bind is difficult, and one would think a travelling<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;minstrel could bind himself anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;I am wholeheartedly against Bind for Bards. No other Hybrid gets this.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;This is reserved for the pure casters. Yes it would be nice to have, but<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;&quot;it&#39;d be nice to have a bazooka too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Ummm, no other hybrid gets pick locks either, so they should probably take<br/>
<br/>
    that away too by your logic.<br/>
<br/>
    Please stop making judgements on me and assuming my logic.  Maybe I should rephrase what I mean.  Simply, I believe Bind should be reserved for the Pure Spellcasting classes.  I am happy with the skills I have... Actually, that&#39;s not correct either... I live with the skills I have.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;I somewhat agreed with everything on the petition but the Bind and the Exp<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;issues. I was a little bit peeved to see the petition ask for a bonus in<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;ability (Bind) that makes the class stronger, and at the same time ask for<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;less of an exp hit.... We are hybrids. Hybrids have a penalty. We can<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    tank and cast spells with our songs.... We get a penalty in Exp for that and we<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt;should. As far as soloing... Verant has always said this is a group game.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;I don&#39;t level any noticeably slower than my GF (High Elf Magician) who I<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;group with on EVERY kill. So in groups, as Verant designed the game, it&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;been my exp that we&#39;re not really disadvantaged at all. While Bards CAN<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;solo and DO solo, I believe Bards belong in a party. If someone chooses to<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;solo, then they should take the extra penalties for doing so in a group<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;based game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Best part of your piece hands down. While I disagree on the bind issue, I<br/>
<br/>
    too think we do not suffer from an overly large experience penalty. I keep<br/>
<br/>
    up with the human monk I most often group with and do better soloing against<br/>
<br/>
    some critters than he does. In groups he ends up taking most of the damage<br/>
<br/>
    since he deals out so much and wears no armor to speak of. I have not seen<br/>
<br/>
    any real evidence we advance much slower than the average character,<br/>
<br/>
    although many bards are wood elves and wood elves advance slower than<br/>
<br/>
    humans. But then why would you want to be a human and live in some smelly<br/>
<br/>
    stone city, yech! Oops, sorry let my character run away with itself there,<br/>
<br/>
    no offense intended to our human readership.<br/>
<br/>
    I personally don&#39;t take offense to much of anything (And no, I did not think you directed this last part at me directly).  One of the things I do take offense to is someone labelling me without basis.  I know I shouldn&#39;t care, but I do.  And that&#39;s one of my weaknesses... <br/>
<br/>
    BTW, I am not a doctor and I do have some, not much, but some talent in music.  I am poor at telling stories, tho. <br/>
