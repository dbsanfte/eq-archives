Huh? I don&#39;t know about this.  I have hunted here quite a bit (100 hours?).<br/>
And I have never seen these guys charm.  = P.  I have charm mem&#39;d here a<br/>
lot.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a mob smart enough to DoT himself.  <br/>
<br/>
Mu<br/>
<br/>
On a side note I have seen a lot of mobs that I couldn&#39;t mez after Tash and<br/>
I am not a bard expert by any stretch of the word, I play an Enchanter, so I<br/>
am not sure of the name of the spell you use says something about &quot;xxxxx<br/>
hair stands on end&quot;.  This spell REALLY helps alot.  I would have the bard<br/>
use this first before the argo change to tashania , why  not he was meleeing<br/>
anyways, and I could slow without having to cast Tashania and get myself<br/>
beat down.  Then I could tashania after it was slowed.<br/>

<br/>
I was in The Courtyard Area of The Hole last night and twice we fought<br/>
Elemental Channelers would couldn&#39;t be mezzed.  Both a 52 Enchanter and<br/>
myself (54 Bard) couldn&#39;t get our Mez&#39;s to stick.<br/>
<br/>
Channelers can cast spells that group members have; and our Druid (a VERY<br/>
good player) insisted she didn&#39;t DOT him by mistake.  The Wizard in the<br/>
group is new to my guild and I haven&#39;t played with him very much - but there<br/>
was no evidence that he was a sloppy player and not a single instance all<br/>
not (otherwise) of mis-targetted mobs.<br/>
<br/>
I did notice that when I was finally able to get the Mez to stick - that<br/>
there was a significant amount of damage on the mob.<br/>
<br/>
The only conclusion I could make was that they DOT themselves.  Again -<br/>
Channelers can cast any spell that any player in the group has memmed - you<br/>
