<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289376072">How long does the effect of the Lament last after you sing it to the mobs?<br/>
Will I have to do it over again when I take on the next mob?<br/>

&gt; Song #8, Keliens Lubrous Lament (sp) is a WONDERFUL addition to your<br/>
&gt; bardsong list. If you want to wow your friends, try this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Find 2-5 mobs that you want to fight, but don&#39;t want to fight all at<br/>
&gt;    once. (ie. if you attack one, they all come running)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. &#39;Lament&#39; (Make em sad) the ones you DON&#39;T want to fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Attack one of the ones you DO want to fight, pull it back a ways (to<br/>
&gt;    get out of the aggro range of his buddies)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Repeat with the next mob =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy =)<br/>
