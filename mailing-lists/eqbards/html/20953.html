<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] New colors pretty - any good combo&#39;s? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669098841">i had such a habit of hitting my run hotkey that i had to take it out so i<br/>
would break the habit heh.  now i have to break the habit of immediately<br/>
hitting full screen as well.<br/>
<br/>
i used the eqcasters color wizard too, works really well.  the only changes<br/>
i made were to tone down the brightness of the guildchat green, slightly<br/>
darken the ooc and auction green to make it easier to read in full screen,<br/>
lighten up the tell and who colors for full screen as well, and make skill<br/>
increases bright yellow so i don&#39;t miss em anymore.  still need to find a<br/>
good color for spells.  i tried light blue, orange, i just can&#39;t find one i<br/>
like since it is spammed so much from everyone else&#39;s spells.  also hope<br/>
they tell us what all those other id&#39;s are in the ini since it goes up to 32<br/>
or so, or someone figures em out.  my group loot and blue con is super dark<br/>
blue and i can&#39;t read it at all.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; So, I want to share what I did and see if any of you have had <br/>
&gt; any success<br/>
&gt; with the color changes.  I first made my songs red - I wanted <br/>
&gt; to see them<br/>
&gt; boldly, but that mixed in with resist so not good.  I then <br/>
&gt; changed songs to<br/>
&gt; yellow - that shows up really well in all modes.  Damage <br/>
&gt; shields (if you<br/>
&gt; still have them on) also show up in yellow, but I typically <br/>
&gt; am not getting<br/>
&gt; beat on that long even if pulling, so not a problem.  I also <br/>
&gt; changed skill<br/>
&gt; increases to red.  I use a parser sure, but I like to see <br/>
&gt; them (or at least<br/>
&gt; have a chance - blue sucks imho - I could never catch what <br/>
&gt; was said - song,<br/>
&gt; skill or whatever - in blue).  Anyone else play with this?<br/>
