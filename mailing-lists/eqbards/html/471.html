&gt;<br/>
&gt;A general question about expending practice points:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I got to 8th level I expended one practice point to train in String.<br/>
&gt;The first time I sang a song that used a stringed instrument, my skill<br/>
&gt;raised one point to 9.  That indicates that expending the initial practice<br/>
&gt;point to get the String skill gave me a skill level of 8.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the other hand, when I first started my character I expended one<br/>
 </span></blockquote>practice<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;point in Sense Heading.  The next time I went up a level in Sense Heading,<br/>
&gt;my skill level was only 2.  That indicated one practice point spent and one<br/>
&gt;skill level gained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, does expending a practice point give you a random amount of skill<br/>
 </span></blockquote>levels<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;based on your INT and/or WIS score or does it only give you one skill level<br/>
&gt;per practice point?  If the second case is true, how do you account for me<br/>
&gt;getting 8 skill points in String while only expending 1 practice point?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Reason for asking:  I am about to embark on a secondary career as the<br/>
&gt;Kelethin brewmaster for E&#39;ci.  I haven&#39;t expended any practice points in<br/>
&gt;brewing yet.  I want to get my skill up to 10 before I start the learning<br/>
&gt;process.  Just need to know if I only need to put a couple of practice<br/>
&gt;points in it or will I need to expend 10 practice points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
