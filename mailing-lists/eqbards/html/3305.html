&gt;Ever since I moved to bronze plate (slowly switching it with<br/>
&gt;steel plate), I get the impression that mobs get an attack<br/>
&gt;bonus if you are close to encumbered but not there yet.  I am<br/>
&gt;regularly being hit for close to max damage, while my lower<br/>
&gt;level friends in banded seem to be taking less.  The only one<br/>
&gt;who seems to take more is my monk friend, who is 6 levels<br/>
&gt;behind me and has woven/mesh (leather/chain equivalent for<br/>
&gt;damage absorbtion).<br/>

AH! Thank you John!! At least now I know it&#39;s not just MY imagination on<br/>
this one. I was thinking the same thing, but was kinda afraid to admit it,<br/>
fearing people would say I was just whining about something. I am usually,<br/>
because of loot, within 5 or so points of my weight allowance (but not<br/>
encumbered) and it seems like mobs NEVER miss me, ALWAYS do tremendous<br/>
damage, and I get stunned alot. The stunning part, as I HAVE &quot;whined&quot; about<br/>
in other messages, REALLY has been getting to me as of late since it seems<br/>
almost every other hit &quot;stuns&quot; me for some reason. I was actually beginning<br/>
to wonder if armor is worth anything, if I am going to be hit all the time<br/>
and stunned half the time ANYWAY. (smile)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is because we are so close to max weight. I will have to play with<br/>
that some, too.<br/>
