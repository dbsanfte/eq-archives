<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631037524">The big difference between being guilded and not guilded is that I<br/>
can log onto Innoruuk right now and guildsay &quot;Vox is up, let&#39;s go&quot; and get<br/>
24 people with the right mix of classes to Permafrost in under an hour.<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t just the co-ordination once you get to permafrost, it&#39;s<br/>
the co-ordination of people to get them all in the same place at the same<br/>
time.  Without the channel for communication, a 24+ person event on the<br/>
same day is next to impossible.<br/>
	I would also be willing to /consent any person in my guild if<br/>
asked.  I am not willing to do so for the majority of non-LoD people on<br/>
the server.  Being in the same guild and working together with the same<br/>
people builds a sense of trust and teamwork.<br/>
