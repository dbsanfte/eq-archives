<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116767488"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m entirely unqualified to give you advice, but I would like <br/>
&gt; to know why<br/>
&gt; you feel Blackburrow is such a good dungeon for bards.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; found it to be<br/>
&gt; lag-city (2 song max) and have not been able to successfully <br/>
&gt; hunt there with<br/>
&gt; either my bard, shaman, wizard, or rogue.  I understand it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; a good spot for<br/>
&gt; a necro though.  But then, what isn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, Well, I have never had super bad lag in BB, however, I mostly hunted<br/>
there before I was twisting a lot so we shall see. What I like about it is<br/>
that with selos I can bail from all the way at the top of the snake ramp<br/>
(unsure what other people call it now) and often make it out of the zone<br/>
alive *laughs*. I like hunting the area of  the snake ramp in particular,<br/>
moving past the door to the chamber between the two commander rooms as level<br/>
permits. The other nice thing about it is if you get in trouble chasing a<br/>
runner through the ramps around the big hole, you can jump in and make your<br/>
getaway. Then there are the Qeynos and halas fang quests, both of which are<br/>
really good. Mostly I just think it&#39;s fun, in a very rambunctious, stay on<br/>
your toes constant crisis sort of way :o)<br/>
