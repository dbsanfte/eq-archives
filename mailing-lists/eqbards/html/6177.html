<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292479089">Actually, if it makes you feel any better, the Germans had spikes on their<br/>
helmets in world war one, not world war two.  So you don&#39;t actually look like a<br/>
Nazi, you look like one of the Kaiser&#39;s boys :)<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, btw, all the plate helms are getting looked at for redesign.  I have<br/>
no idea when, but I Brad said so at GenCon (or someplace similar).<br/>

<br/>
p.s. for all the wood elves out there, the helmet looks much better in steel, as<br/>
the bird is a different colour from the rest of the helmet.</div>
