&gt; &gt; You&#39;re saying the 3 other bards took over and played the abandoned 50+<br/>
&gt; &gt; level players. Ah. Ok, that made sense.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, aren&#39;t these types of players typically worse than the one that<br/>
&gt; &gt; brought them up from level 1? I mean you get the &quot;ebay&quot; twinks that <br/>
&gt; have no<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea what they&#39;re doing and get everyone killed. Then again, at least in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; a guild they&#39;d have more support from a group overall.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;[Thought this question might lead to some good discussion]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think there&#39;s a heck of a lot of difference between an e-bay twink and<br/>
&gt;a character who&#39;s played to 50+ switching to another character. And<br/>
&gt;especially a bard, who&#39;s probably in the best position to watch how<br/>
&gt;other&#39;s play their characters. Assuming some intelligence in the<br/>
&gt;person involved, I&#39;d say the 2 harders characters to pick up would be<br/>
&gt;the cleric and the enchanter myself. I&#39;ve run across L50+ enchanters I<br/>
&gt;know played those entire 50+ levels themselves who still aren&#39;t very<br/>
&gt;good. At the same time, I&#39;ve played in guild groups with one of our<br/>
&gt;enchanter characters played by a cleric who was excellent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To introduce another possible discussion point, the most noticable thing<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve noticed about enchanters I don&#39;t consider very good is that they<br/>
&gt;seem to stun less. The enchanters in my guild always seem to stun first,<br/>
&gt;sometimes twice, before going to mez. This seems to allow them to keep<br/>
&gt;way more mobs mezzed than other enchanters I&#39;ve played with. Anyone else<br/>
&gt;notice this? I have a rl friend on another server who has a 50+<br/>
&gt;enchanter who said she doesn&#39;t use stun much because she&#39;s paranoid of<br/>
&gt;the through walls and ceiling problems with AoE spells in dungeons. The<br/>
&gt;only time I&#39;ve seen this be a problem for our guild enchanters was on<br/>
&gt;the first isle of Sky where the AoE stun brought the quest mobs up from<br/>
&gt;inside the island (twice, we still don&#39;t let him forget that one). It<br/>
&gt;sure served to show how ingrained the stun first, mez later habit was<br/>
&gt;with him though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have another character that I play with my wife since I eventually <br/>
convinced her to start playing. This is a close little group of friends. <br/>
I&#39;m playing a cleric and my friend an enchanter and we are now around level <br/>
22-23.<br/>
<br/>
We both use stun regularly to pull mobs off of each other. I love my <br/>
stun/holy might during combat, and with my enchanter friends&#39; 2 stun spells <br/>
can keep all sorts of things on ice.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t really thought much about stunning a mob before mezzing them. <br/>
I&#39;ll bring this up with my friend and maybe give it a try. Unfortunately, <br/>
we&#39;ve moved away from Frogtown in Lake of Ill Omen which was pretty common <br/>
for multiple pulls. Of course, we don&#39;t have AOE stun spells so I can&#39;t <br/>
comment about that, but AOE mez has been extremely nice as long as our <br/>
group keeps the frogs together.<br/>
