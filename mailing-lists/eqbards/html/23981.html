<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082612798"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That&#39;s why I laugh whenever someone says that bards are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>overpowered.  The statement is ludicrous on its very face.  If that <br/>
were true, in a game dominated by the mechanics of level advancement <br/>
and ability to overpower foes, then there would be more than the flat <br/>
(100/14)% bards.  There are not.  It is not because bards are some <br/>
great secret either.  Sure a lot of people don&#39;t know all that bards <br/>
can do, but that is because it takes far, far more work to play a <br/>
bard than any other class.  Probably why I like them, they are much <br/>
more challenging.  Anybody can hit autoattack and the occasional <br/>
taunt, bash,  or kick hotkey.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When someone says Bards are overpowered, they&#39;re making a comparison <br/>
of a well played Bard vs. a well played &lt;whatever class&gt;.  That <br/>
comparison _ignores_ that Bards are inherently more difficult to play <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ludicrous, you&#39;re adding difficulty in <br/>
playing the class into the equation of a Class&#39; power.  It&#39;s 2 <br/>
different comparisons, really.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re saying, &quot;That&#39;s a big grape.&quot; and you&#39;re responding <br/>
with, &quot;That&#39;s silly, anyone can see that it&#39;s one of the smaller <br/>
fruits.&quot;<br/>
