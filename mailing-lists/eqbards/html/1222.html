<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693308526">Mino Horns are a Wind Instrument ( you can play the water-breathing song one dry<br/>
land for practice).<br/>
<br/>
I do not know of any good way to practice the brass skill because the first song<br/>
we get is the improved chords.  I went to Paw at level 19 to practice it.  I<br/>
figured it would be safe.  At one point we had about 8 shamans and a couple<br/>
guards and captains all pissed at myself a cleric and a warrior.  It was very<br/>
difficult to kill any of them because the shamans kept healing each other.<br/>
Eventually we had chase them down one by one into a corner.  So, if you go to<br/>
Paw or some other low level dungeon to practice your brass skill, be warned&lt;g&gt;!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there is another way to do it.  If you can find a remote enough<br/>
location where no npc&#39;s will wander by, you can play the song if there is a<br/>
player character who is not in your party within range.  Pretty neat animations<br/>
go along with playing the horn.<br/>

&gt; collection of Mino Horns.  Are these Wind or Brass instruments?  Also I<br/>
&gt; noticed we get the Brass Skill at 12, but there are no level 12 brass<br/>
&gt; songs... or am I missing something?<br/>
