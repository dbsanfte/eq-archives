<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832667036">Welp, my /played times are somewhat unrealistic because I tend to let<br/>
characters idle a great deal.  My bard - which is the one I have played the<br/>
most was started in May &#39;99 and has 220 days /played - although like I said,<br/>
lots of time idle (fell alseep crossing West Karana or just zoning more<br/>
times than I care to recount).  But, I login about 6pm on weekdays and stay<br/>
till 10pm - sometimes 11 or 12.  Weekends, begin around 8am and go, on and<br/>
off, til midnight or 2am - with the occasional all-nighter - like last Sat<br/>
when our little group killed the PoD in Gfay, rescued a Freeti room wipe<br/>
out, then as we were killing the fire giants, saw Ragefire spawn so we<br/>
called in a cleric friend and killed a dragon.  The monk in our group won a<br/>
Cloak of Flames and our warrior won a red dragon scale at 4am when the dust<br/>
settled.<br/>
<br/>
And ya, my house is a mess, girl friend moved out a year ago, the lawn needs<br/>
mowing, and I order food for delivery way too often.  But any zone I enter,<br/>
someone invariably sends me a greeting!  ;)<br/>
