 </span></blockquote>No but they are looking to perfect the art it seems.  I got killed after a<br/>
page fault in EQGame.exe dumped me to windows in the middle of a fight.  The<br/>
senior guide who responded to my petition all but accused me of writing a<br/>
process to purposely page fault eqgame whenever I was about to die so I<br/>
could get a free rez.  He further informed me that it was official Verant<br/>
policy to treat all customers as if they were deliberately causing page<br/>
faults in order to get free rez&#39;s unless incontrovertible proof otherwise<br/>
was available.  Like there could be such proof.  I sent in a long letter<br/>
expressing my displeasure with the page fault info from windows to our<br/>
server&#39;s Head GM, and various others at Verant.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, think how Shaman&#39;s feel too.  They have been /bugging the specific<br/>
problems with Alchemy for months and no one at Verant has seen fit to<br/>
actually see if what they said was true.  This was posted just about<br/>
everywhere over the weekend when Brad admitted they had been testing Alchemy<br/>
incorrectly all along.  Obviously they have about as much regard for their<br/>
customers at Verant as the average 20th level has for a fire beetle.<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s that annoying clicking sound&quot; after playing lullaby for testing and<br/>
forgetting about the test subject who easily managed to follow me into<br/>
Qeynos while the guards were off chasing some Necro.<br/>
