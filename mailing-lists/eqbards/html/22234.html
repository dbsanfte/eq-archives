<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131977597">Yeah, Absor later posted, and corrected himself.  The damage shield<br/>
components on the Psalms are staying, the damage absorbtion portions of the<br/>
songs that have them are being removed.  (march of wee?, something else?)<br/>
As I only have psalm of warmth right now, and use it while grouped for the<br/>
damage shield...I was mighty concerned until Absor reposted.<br/>

&gt; I am at work and can&#39;t get on to the Internet now to check out the post.<br/>
&gt; So maybe someone can clarify this for me.  Is Absor also referring to<br/>
Psalm<br/>
&gt; of warmth and cooling?  They have &quot;damage shields&quot;, not damage absorption<br/>
&gt; shields.  If the Psalms are being nerfed I&#39;ll be pretty pissed... I like<br/>
&gt; the damage shields.  I would like to assume that Absor is refering to ONLY<br/>
&gt; damage absorption shields but assuming something that Verant does only<br/>
&gt; makes and ass out of you and me.<br/>
