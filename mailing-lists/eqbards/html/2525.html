<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457495866">It ranges 5-7 dm for me, and I find it quite useful.  I still cant decide<br/>
what to wield just yet.  I like my FS longsword cause with buff I often get<br/>
2 strikes, but the damage is hard to compare to my mino hittin for 17 a<br/>
swing.  A friend told me the FS longsword would probably be better in the<br/>
end since you get more swings in with the buff song goin the delay is alot<br/>
quicker than the mino.  I know these weaps dont even come close to you all<br/>
wieldin dirks and such but hey I&#39;ll get there someday.  At the moment I&#39;m on<br/>
the search for a combine longsword, scitmar perhaps.  Altough I know bellow<br/>
is a single target spell, does it attract mobs in dungeons and caves?  I had<br/>
some fighters complaing last nite that I was attracting them.<br/>

&gt; Nah, I&#39;m playing a woodelf as well.  It usually does 7pts for me.  Maybe<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; was tweaked since you first got it.  BTW, I love wood elves too much to<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; any other race unless forced to (my next chrt is an enchanter, and I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think wood elf is an option). I just love having forage & hide at lvl 1.<br/>
:)<br/>

&gt; &gt; And Bellow goes up a point in damage every other level or so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m curioius though why you&#39;re finding it does 7 points when<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;ve just gotten it.  If I recall correctly, it only did 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; points max when I got it.  Maybe wood elves have smaller<br/>
&gt; &gt; lungs?<br/>
