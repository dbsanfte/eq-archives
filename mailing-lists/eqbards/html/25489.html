<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863328586">I&#39;m brand new to this list, but I am also looking at the Dark Age of <br/>
Camelot. It has an advantage over EQ because gets to utilize all the things <br/>
that EQ did right and try to improve on all the worst elements. The three <br/>
biggest improvements I think they have made are: (1) Quests: Apparently they <br/>
have some sort of questing journal that helps you keep track of all of the <br/>
quests you have taken part in and remind you what the next step is that you <br/>
need to take. This includes picking up a drop from a mob that is part of a <br/>
quest. No more spamming a zone asking if anyone knows what the Raw Sword is <br/>
for or something like that. Also, the quests are supposed to change for each <br/>
character so they are level specific. No more high levels camping low level <br/>
quests for no experience. (2) Travel: I guess there are horses that you can <br/>
rent from NPCs which run you from stable to stable at a very fast rate. You <br/>
can jump off at any time or continue to the destination. Nobody has to waste <br/>
fifteen minutes of valuable playing time running across West Karana. (3) <br/>
Death: Whether it is realistic or not, players retain all of their equipment <br/>
after death. Levels can&#39;t be lost due to death either. Experience loss can be <br/>
regained by returning to the place of death (marked by a gravestone) and <br/>
praying. There is also a loss of constitution points which can be bought back <br/>
from a merchant. Clerics can also revive experience and constitution loss <br/>
(just like EQ, but I thought I should mention it).<br/>
       There are other things that I like about DAoC also, but these are the <br/>
biggees in my estimation.<br/>
