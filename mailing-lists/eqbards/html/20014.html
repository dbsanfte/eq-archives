Subject: [eqbards] Happy Happy Joy Joy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;From Friday night:<br/>
&gt; I finally went to bed on Saturday morning at 2:00am a happy level 19.  As<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; guild was doing a Najena raid I really wanted to get back to the<br/>
&quot;mainland&quot;<br/>
&gt; from Kunark on Saturday...  Saturday night I still found myself in Kunark<br/>
&gt; trying to help a friend get his char. to level 19 for the raid.  We found<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; great group near the goblin ruins at the Lake and just flew.  We cycled<br/>
&gt; through a heap of group members but almost always kept a full group.  It<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; insane!  We were basically fighting non-stop pulling blues to yellows.  We<br/>
&gt; tried one or two pulls out of the Ruins and died massive deaths ;)  So at<br/>
&gt; 2am(+10 GMT) Sunday morning I made level 20!  One level in one day! I was<br/>
&gt; just wrapped!  At 2:02am  my first skill hit master and I was already off<br/>
&gt; and pulling again for the group (after we stopped for some SS&#39;s of my<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; 20 group).  I had a guild member and friend that wanted to come along for<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; naming &quot;ceremony&quot;.  So at 2:35am Jacana got her surname and more SS&#39;s were<br/>
&gt; taken :)  A few more pulls were done and then I went to bad a very happy<br/>
&gt; camper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sundays guild Najena raid was a bomb for us (and for the rest of the<br/>
guild).<br/>
&gt; A group of us decided we were going to head back to Kunark.  As we went<br/>
&gt; through the forest we smacked around some DE&#39;s :)  Then in ECommons I got<br/>
&gt; side tracked (MMMMM! Male Half-Elf Bards) and they headed on with out me.<br/>
&gt; Of the group of 5 two logged but 3 would still be enough in Kunark.  So I<br/>
&gt; finally caught up with them in FV and it was only then I realised I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get my songs I wanted.  So I ran back to the boat in time to see it pull<br/>
off<br/>
&gt; (bloody trams!).  That was enough!  Another member logged so two were<br/>
left.<br/>
&gt; I shouted for a TP back to BB and we found one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Off to get songs I went.  And suddenly got in my head that tonight was<br/>
&gt; Lambent Bracers night!  After a few hours of shouting I got my &#39;feene<br/>
charm<br/>
&gt; and a lambent stone (from a friend) and the darkbone was already in my<br/>
bank<br/>
&gt; from some nice people in Unrest days...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So after I hit Eurdin for my songs it was off for the Lambents.  I<br/>
realised<br/>
&gt; when I got to the temple it said 550gp.  I had everything in PP *DOH*  So<br/>
&gt; back to the bank I went and back again.  Finally at about 10:45 last night<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; ended up with my first piece of lambents!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I was given two amazing weapons by a very very sweet high level bard<br/>
&gt; this weekend (as well as a few pieces of armour).  My thulian claw and<br/>
&gt; silvery war axe have been replaced with a Sainy&#39;s Claw and a Gleaming<br/>
Broad<br/>
&gt; Sword (or is it short sword?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that&#39;s what I call bards luck ;)<br/>
