&gt;Being able to Summon Food and Water is totally a joke.  It would be a joke<br/>
&gt;if it were on armor I could get at 28th level.  At 50+ it&#39;s extremely<br/>

&gt;really useful to have at 50+.  What do we have now, Verant clones?  Please.<br/>
&gt;Why would characters who have been leaving behind 5pp weapons for 10+ levels<br/>
&gt;because they were trash loot suddenly care about 6cp muffins and milk?<br/>
&gt;Great, now we can save everyone in our party 1.2 sp a day, whoopee.<br/>
