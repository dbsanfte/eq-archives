<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348032228">Again, I take 2 days off from checking e-mail, and I am flooded with <br/>
posts :).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think people should be allowed to bind other people <br/>
anywhere.  You don&#39;t design a game around the people who can play 6 or <br/>
more hours a day, you design it for your average person who plays 3 or <br/>
4 hours tops, and probably not every day.  For those people, running <br/>
through many zones to get a corpse is by far more of a waste of time <br/>
than many of us can imagine.<br/>
<br/>
People talk about the necessary &quot;penalty for dying&quot;.  Fighting your <br/>
way from Innothule swamp down to the scryer room in upper guk at lvl <br/>
18 is a penalty.  Losing 3 or 4 hours of exp is a penalty.  Being <br/>
forced to run through 3 or 4 zones naked is a waste of 30 minutes.  <br/>
I don&#39;t mind being forced to spend hours getting back to my corpse in a dungeon, or hours making up the experience.  It&#39;s all part of the <br/>
enjoyment of the game.  However, running from Freeport to Guk, and <br/>
forcing my group to wait nearly an hour every time I die is just <br/>
plain dumb.<br/>
<br/>
Being able to bind anywhere will mean melee classes are slightly less <br/>
afraid of dying, true.  But so what?  All it means is that Revive will <br/>
be used for its intended purpose (bringing someone back deep into a <br/>
dungeon when the group wins with casualties).  In fact, if classes <br/>
were allowed to bind anywhere, the absurd rules regarding corpse <br/>
ressurections would never have been needed.  One of the primary <br/>
reasons the rule was changed was that people were leaving duel corpses <br/>
for the purpose of being teleported places.<br/>
<br/>
Everquest&#39;s status quo is constantly changing.  I remember a time when <br/>
Verant stated that it was their intent for Selo to always break root.<br/>
Well... ahem.  Need I say more?  I still don&#39;t know if the current <br/>
selo/root interaction is a feature or a bug.  Just because Verant has <br/>
taken one stance in the past doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right, or shouldn&#39;t <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
Primary my belief that the way melee classes are treated vs casters<br/>
is unfair.  There&#39;s no reason inherently in the game that justifies<br/>
why you can only bind others in city zones while you can bind yourself<br/>
anywhere except as a convenience for lazy programming because they<br/>
don&#39;t feel like changing it in a way that would prevent malicious <br/>
binds.<br/>
