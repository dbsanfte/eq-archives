<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053662205">This is a good point!  How many bards actually use the throwing skill?  How<br/>
&#39;bout substituting the &quot;ranged weapon&quot; with a &quot;instrument&quot; slot for bards?<br/>
Although that would mean not carrying around a runed fork... hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue, what about the darned mask of the deciever?  Aren&#39;t you bards<br/>
getting a little ticked off that EVERY 30+ character has one, AND USES IT!<br/>
The item is bard/rogue only, it bugs the hell outta me to see my dwarf<br/>
cleric friend morph into one of his mortal enemies?  As well, it detracts<br/>
from the unique rogueish character of our class.  Just my opinion<br/>

&gt; Well, if ya send another letter, PLEASE ask them to add a instrument slot<br/>
&gt; for us - much like folks using a bow - there is ALREADY a way for the<br/>
&gt; client to switch them out without having to manually juggle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Folks with weapons don&#39;t disarm to use a bow - casters don&#39;t have to<br/>
disarm<br/>
&gt; to cast - why do WE have to disarm to go to an instrument?<br/>

&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t mean to sound like I&#39;m disagreeing with you (I agree 100 pct) -<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t really see the need for a petition.  As far as bards are<br/>
concerned -<br/>
&gt; &gt;who&#39;d vote AGAINST it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We definitely should start think about sending another GZ letter - and<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt;belongs on it...<br/>
