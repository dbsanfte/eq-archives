<b>Subject:</b> Re: Suggestions for a level 6 baby bard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161869571"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Heya,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You fine folks have any suggestions for a level 6 Bard on where to hunt?<br/>
&gt; Im was born in, and live around the Qeynos area. I have been helping keep<br/>
&gt; the rat population down, and lately have been working on keeping the<br/>
&gt; dreaded Black Burrow entrance free of Scouts and Guards. However I am in<br/>
&gt; need of greater adventure. As a bard, I need great adventures to write<br/>
&gt; songs about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s adventures you want you may be interested in visiting Splitpaw. It is a<br/>
dungeon in the middle of south karana. There are around 5-7 splitpaw gnolls<br/>
outside that are 5th - 6th level. I believe it to be the best place for going<br/>
from 6th to 9th (assuming you can live with a long walk if you die). With a<br/>
group you could even head inside and hunt everything before the first bridge<br/>
(you&#39;ll see it when you go in a little and thru some doors).<br/>

&gt; they give me stuff, is this considered twinking?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my opinion, no. Others may differ.<br/>
