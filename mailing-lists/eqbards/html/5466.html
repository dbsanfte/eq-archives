<div id="ygrps-yiv-990529047">Well it&#39;s me again. I&#39;m sorry if my appology about my english is bothering<br/>
you but I said that because I mean it. The fact is that I got a few mails<br/>
about my language and they weren&#39;t very pleasent to read. If you think my<br/>
english is good enough then I can say just one thing. Thanks god at least<br/>
one. Beleive me this is the first mail in which my english is mentioned as<br/>
something good. So I&#39;ll never write that appology about my language again.<br/>
I hope I didn&#39;t iritate you to much, If I did then I&#39;m sorry I just wanted<br/>
to help.<br/>

&gt; Does it ever bother anyone else that people who say, &quot;Sorry if you couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand, English isn&#39;t my first language,&quot; often speak more coherently<br/>
&gt; than about 70 -80% of the people whose first language it is?  I mean, I meet<br/>
&gt; people who have been speaking English their entire lives, and I guess its<br/>
&gt; just degraded from over use.  For all of those people out there who think<br/>
&gt; they aren&#39;t being understood, don&#39;t worry about it, chances are you get your<br/>
&gt; points across more clearly than we naturals do :)<br/>
