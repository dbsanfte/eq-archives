<br/>
<br/>
I play a bard (she&#39;s L25, wood elf) and my husband plays an enchanter (L29,<br/>
high elf). We play together all the time, and play very well together, too.<br/>
Here&#39;s why:<br/>
<br/>
COMMUNICATION: We have found that one of the biggest things is<br/>
communication. I can&#39;t stress that enough! We make it a point to find out<br/>
who we are grouping with so we know what tactics to use. We also explain -<br/>
preferrably while we&#39;re not in the heat of battle - about what the enchanter<br/>
brings to a party; crowd control (most people don&#39;t know this - including<br/>
some who play the class). As a group, we decide who will be the puller and<br/>
that we should all assist the puller, as well as why or why I won&#39;t play<br/>
songs certain times of the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Example; We&#39;ve been hunting in Mistmoor (MM) a lot lately. I discovered that<br/>
if I play a song while our runner is pulling something for us to fight, and<br/>
he brings more than one mob, the extras run right past him directly to me<br/>
when he/she gets back, which is not a good thing as it&#39;s easier for my hubby<br/>
enchanter to mezz the entire mob if they&#39;re in a clump - not to mention it<br/>
HURTS my lil wood elf self!!! So, I wait until we&#39;ve started assisting the<br/>
puller and then sail in with songs and weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Also pre-fight: Choose songs according to who is in the group and what area<br/>
you are playing in (i.e. inside someplace like MM, I do never play AE songs,<br/>
there is way too much training in there for it to be safe). At L20, you can<br/>
contribute to the group by assisting in melee, and by party buffs (Chant,<br/>
Hymn, any of the Rhythms, etc) --- you CAN contribute.<br/>
<br/>
The others who responded to this made many very good points. One being that<br/>
there are good enchanters and bad enchanters. A good enchanter will save a<br/>
party, a bad enchanter gets his/her party killed. This is VERY true. My<br/>
husband spends a lot of time researching everything thoroughly, so he&#39;s very<br/>
knowledgeable on good enchanter tactics and is not afraid to use them. Plus,<br/>
it helps that he&#39;s a nice guy and knows how to get the group to work with<br/>
him (with my help).<br/>
<br/>
OFF TOPIC: Harm --- sometimes I use caps to emphasize a specific word... but<br/>
I&#39;ll try to bear in mind that they seem to bother you *grin*<br/>
