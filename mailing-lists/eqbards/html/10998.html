<div id="ygrps-yiv-400472483">Where did you get a rebreather?  I heard that it cost 1000pp for components<br/>
for a gnome to attempt to make one.<br/>

<br/>
p.s. the one and only time I was in Kedge - I had EB cast on me but had<br/>
Aquatic Ayre memmed just in case (or more like when.)  But having to rely on<br/>
Ayre - means one less song you can twist - although ayre seems to have an<br/>
extended linger time - like aria used to.<br/>

		Oh yeah you&#39;re right.  I forgot that the new Magician<br/>
summoned Waterstone<br/>
		makes tinkers unnecessary for Kedge Keep runs.  At least I<br/>
got a 50% rebate<br/>
		for selling back my rebreather.  Wait, I&#39;m a bard what do I<br/>
need a<br/>
		Waterstone for either?  That damned gnome!<br/>
