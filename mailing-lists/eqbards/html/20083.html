<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857442474">I&#39;ve never understood why people think enchanters and bards don&#39;t mix well.<br/>
Even at my middle level of 33, I think most people will agree that crowd<br/>
control is the most important thing in a dungeon.  (I think crowd control<br/>
begins with a good puller and ends with mez and charm).  Enchanters are the<br/>
best at this, we are almost the only second option.  Stick and root is a<br/>
poor third.<br/>
<br/>
The person in my guild I group with the most is our enchanter (we are a<br/>
small guild, I am the only bard, and we have 2 enchanters in the above 30<br/>
range).  We do great as we can add just about any third (or more) to us and<br/>
be successful. With just the two of us, its a bit rough as our damage output<br/>
is pretty flimsy.  (We try to find groups of mobs and both charm one, and<br/>
let them beat each other sensless, but its hairy sometimes without a<br/>
healer).<br/>
<br/>
The clarities stack.  This is a good thing.  Divide up the buffing and<br/>
debuffing depending on the mobs your fighting.  Divide up the crowd control<br/>
(basically if we get 2 mobs, I charm, otherwise she mezz&#39;s and I just back<br/>
her up and keep her alive).  Having multiple stunners is great against<br/>
casters.  Fighting in Dalinar&#39;s most the casters we faced never got a spell<br/>
off (our third was a troll warrior so he was bashing too).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have never seen met a class I didn&#39;t like to group with.  Merely<br/>
players I didn&#39;t like to group with.<br/>
