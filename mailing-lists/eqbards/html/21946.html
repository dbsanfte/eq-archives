&gt;&gt; I haven&#39;t really thought much about stunning a mob before mezzing them. <br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll bring this up with my friend and maybe give it a try. Unfortunately, <br/>
&gt;&gt; we&#39;ve moved away from Frogtown in Lake of Ill Omen which was pretty common <br/>
&gt;&gt; for multiple pulls. Of course, we don&#39;t have AOE stun spells so I can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt; comment about that, but AOE mez has been extremely nice as long as our <br/>
&gt;&gt; group keeps the frogs together.<br/>

&gt;All enchanter stuns are aoe.<br/>

<br/>
To me, the single target ones aren&#39;t proper stuns, more like very<br/>
short mez, and break easily (sound familiar) ... whirl til you hurl<br/>
series and the dizzying draught one .... all see to break stun as soon<br/>
as someone hits them. /shrug<br/>
<br/>
All the colour series are AOE however :)<br/>
