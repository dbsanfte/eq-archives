&gt; Now, on to the good stuff:<br/>
&gt; Our armor is Singing Steel, neon green plate - like Hero Bracer type green<br/>
&gt; not drab ranger green.  Yes Tork is sporting Singing Steel and loving it.<br/>
&gt; ;)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I got dawnchaser (first one on Nameless) this weekend, last night I got a<br/>
&gt; near godly piercing weapon: Sacrdioan&#39;s (sp) Partisan!  That time spent<br/>
&gt; with the ol&#39; obsidian shard to get to 200 was worth it - I&#39;m a regular<br/>
&gt; pigsticker with the new shoulder armor... um nevermind... =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh come on spoil us (or at least me)!!  What zone should I start looking in<br/>
for this stuff?<br/>
<br/>
I know its not Karn&#39;s Castle, they seem to hate Bards there, nothing that we<br/>
saw that dropped there was equippable by bards except one cloak that was<br/>
all/all...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d gotten so bored with EQ, its great to be excited about playing again!!<br/>
