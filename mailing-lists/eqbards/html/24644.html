<div id="ygrps-yiv-715009329">grats on your level and bp.<br/>
<br/>
reminds me of some events in our guild as well<br/>
last week we got our first cleric epic (damn ragefire bottle neck), and he<br/>
dinged the same night into 56 i beleive.<br/>
<br/>
and last night was the bday of 2 guildies, one of which got his druid epic<br/>
last night too.<br/>
<br/>
Last night in hate i pulled a sage of innoruk by accident 8).  I knew i was<br/>
going to die probably, but was trying to find a corpse ( i think it<br/>
gfluxed).  But as i was going towards the corner/up the wall, i started<br/>
getting hit abit by a sage of innoruk, she finally came down to main floor,<br/>
which the guild promptly pulled after i died, she didnt drop anything<br/>
though...<br/>
<br/>
Was fun though 8)<br/>
<br/>
