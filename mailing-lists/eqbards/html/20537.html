<div id="ygrps-yiv-195020546">Go to the Warriors Guild in Firiona Vie.  Go down the tunnel there until you<br/>
are knee deep in the water, equip your trumpet and begin singing.  I<br/>
practiced there for 8 hours unmolested last week.  The only difference<br/>
between what you will do and what I did is that I used Screech instead of<br/>
DDD.  I don&#39;t believe your results will vary though.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Practicing Brass in Kunark<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve read a lot of posts about where to practice DDD/brass <br/>
skills, but I&#39;m afraid I deleted them all and now need the <br/>
information.  You see, I had decided (having been there and verified <br/>
the safety) to do it in the Arena in Lake Rathe.  Well, 18 came and I <br/>
am in Kunark.  I am not going all the way to Lake Rathe just to <br/>
practice! <br/>
<br/>
Someone said that they think brass skills are checked even when this <br/>
song is sung without an instrument.  I am convinced that person <br/>
was right.  The number of missed notes I&#39;m having is just astounding <br/>
(frequently 20 or more in a row).  I realize that missed notes are<br/>
not <br/>
uncommon for a new song, but this is ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you have suggestions, please make them somewhere that a <br/>
&quot;good&quot; level 19 can get to.  Thanks!<br/>
