So it&#39;s possible to get enough faction for the warrior&#39;s<br/>
merchant to view you more highly than the bard merchant (who<br/>
has always viewed me amiably).  I was surprised to find at<br/>
least one merchant in Kaladim who kindly considers me (which<br/>
is higher than warmly which is higher than amiable).<br/>
