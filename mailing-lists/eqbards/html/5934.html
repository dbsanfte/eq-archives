<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503703142">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I noticed something very disturbing the other night along similar lines; SoW <br/>
doesn&#39;t only seem to override Consonant Chain, but also Accelerando now <br/>
(Accelerando used to override SoW, didn&#39;t it?). A friendly shaman was <br/>
buffing me and cast SoW (he didn&#39;t mean to, poor guy) while I was singing <br/>
Accelerando with a drum. For the rest of the duration of SoW, Accelerando <br/>
didn&#39;t work. I&#39;m only level 16, but even at so low a level, a bard with a <br/>
drum can outrun SoW slightly (I&#39;ve been stuck at 16 long enough to notice <br/>
the difference). I zoned several times and even logged out a couple of times <br/>
while the SoW was still in &quot;affect&quot; (If you try to cancel SoW yourself by <br/>
left-clicking the icon, you get the &quot;You cannot remove this affect&quot; <br/>
message). No matter what, Selo&#39;s didn&#39;t work. I still ran at SoW speed.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I still kept strumming my drum. And the song icon bubble was greyed out. <br/>
And I made little song sparklies. But there was no &quot;Your feet move faster&quot; <br/>
message, and I was stuck running at SoW speed until the darn thing wore off.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s been like this for a while, sorry. It&#39;s just that I seem to remember <br/>
that Accelerando used to override SoW, not the other way around (you would <br/>
still have the SoW icon, but you&#39;d run at Accelerando speed and get the <br/>
&quot;Your feet move faster&quot; message).<br/>

&gt; &gt; You can now no longer use Selo&#39;s Consonant Chains on rooted, ensnared or<br/>
&gt; &gt; SoW&#39;d mobs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The rooted or ensnared part I dont mind, but not being able to chain<br/>
&gt; &gt; SoW&#39;d or SoC&#39;d mobs is very aggravating. When they flee, they cannot be<br/>
&gt; &gt; stopped. Especially in dungeons where the NPCs can cast SoW indoors,<br/>
&gt; &gt; although PCs cannot. The mob will flee from you and bring back a nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; train.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is very distressing.  I&#39;ve written at length about the<br/>
&gt;problems and ill-feelings that develop when you make monsters<br/>
&gt;work by different rules than players.  Instead of reducing<br/>
&gt;these differences, Verant seems to be increasing them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unless of course this means that players with SoW or<br/>
&gt;Accelerando cannot be rooted by mobs?  That still seems<br/>
&gt;terribly unfair to the classes who cannot SoW or Accelerando<br/>
&gt;themselves.<br/>
