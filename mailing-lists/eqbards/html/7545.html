&quot;kabonged&quot; after you get your opinion noted. Everyone should be free to<br/>

doesn&#39;t even come close to comparing to gate.<br/>

I&#39;d be interested in seeing the results of a caster<br/>
and a bard racing from Freeport to Qeynos and back.<br/>
I can see it now. Caster pays 1pp for SOW and nearly<br/>
keeps up with bard. Bard arrives in Qeynos let&#39;s<br/>
be generous and say 10 minutes before wizard does.<br/>
Bard heads back and gleefully waves at wizard still<br/>
on his way to Qeynos. Wizard gets to Qeynos. Wizard<br/>
gates back to Freeport and laughs it up for 45 minutes<br/>
while the bard is still running.<br/>
<br/>
Or better yet, high level bard & high level wizard in<br/>
the same race. Bard takes off a runnin&#39;.. Wizard does<br/>
his fancy teleport to the Karana&#39;s. Runs rest of way<br/>
to Qeynos. Gates back to Freeport. Bard arrives in West<br/>
Commons on his way to Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Selo&#39;s makes up for all of that.</div>
