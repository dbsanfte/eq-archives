each other out (and goof off too but that&#39;s another topic :).<br/>
<br/>
Top priority for an item goes to people who can AND WILL use<br/>
it, and are there to help kill the mob.  Even though a ranger<br/>
might get better use out of a sharkjaw cutlass than a bard, if<br/>
he&#39;s only planning on using it to trade, he&#39;s the same as a<br/>
caster on the priority list.  After that, we consider when the<br/>
recipient last got a special item, how rare the item is (i.e.<br/>
is this something we&#39;d want to keep in the guild for when<br/>
someone of the right level might find it useful - e.g. my<br/>
sceptre of rahotep), level of the recipient, whether that item<br/>
represents the &quot;best&quot; item possibly obtainable for a class (so<br/>
a druid would probably have a higher priority than melee<br/>
classes on a runed falchion), and any other factors.  None of<br/>
these rules are set in stone too, which sometimes leads to<br/>
lengthy discussion or us deferring the decision until a later<br/>
date.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, if the low level person actually helped kill the mob,<br/>
they can get the item.  OTOH, the vast majority of the time,<br/>
the item will be lottoed as trade material before it&#39;s used to<br/>
&quot;twink.&quot;  (And most of the folks in my guild seem to feel as I<br/>
do that twinking puts you into a doldrum for a many levels<br/>
where you have zero chance of improving that equipment.)<br/>
<br/>
My EBW was kind of a special case because I got the maid tooth<br/>
playing on my own.  If we&#39;d gotten it as a guild, it probably<br/>
would&#39;ve gone to a ranger.<br/>
