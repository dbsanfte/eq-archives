<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251578663">Some spend their lives staring at pages<br/>
My time&#39;s better spend performing on stages<br/>
Some spend their strength swinging a sword<br/>
My strength returns with a beat or a chord<br/>
Some waste their words on pets of mystic design<br/>
My words are weapons, battle and glory are mine<br/>
Some waste their money on scales and on wings<br/>
Do they not see magic in everyone who sings?<br/>
Some say bards are weak, but do they know we are fun?<br/>
We are the jack of all trades, if the master of none<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
