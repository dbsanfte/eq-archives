<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141993572">Well, when I began playing EQ, I was brought in by a group of people that I<br/>
work with.  I asked some of the guild members what was needed in the guild<br/>
and was told &quot;Please play a Bard!&quot; so I did.  I haven&#39;t regretted it since<br/>
and must say that I find myself rarely in need of a group.  Then again, I<br/>
haven&#39;t been around as long as some of you &quot;old timers&quot; &lt;G&gt; so I may not<br/>
have developed the sense of sarcasm that seems prevalent among our class.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the bind issue goes, I tend to agree with what&#39;s been said about<br/>
most zones, though I think that they may add a point someplace between<br/>
Qeynos and Highhold Pass. (Splitpaw sounds good to me!)<br/>

<br/>
Before I bought the game at release, I was looking at the available <br/>
classes and decided that since I&#39;m a musician in RL, the bard class <br/>
would fit me very nicely.  It was my first character and first love :)<br/>
