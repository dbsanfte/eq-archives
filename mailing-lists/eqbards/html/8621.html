<div id="ygrps-yiv-369877586">Lambent armor is not better than crafted.<br/>
Crafted has had stat boosts added to it:<br/>

Crafted Chest: +5 Sta, +25 HPS <br/>
Crafted Wrist: +2 Dexterity and Intelligence <br/>
Crafted Legs: +2 Fire and Cold Resist <br/>
Crafted Boots: +5 Agility <br/>
Crafted Gloves: +5 Strength<br/>
<br/>
...and all the crafted pieces are at least 1 ac better than lambent.<br/>
I think this is all good, because warriors should have better armor than bards.<br/>
<br/>
   However, the rangers that are complaining about the Lambent being better<br/>
than their Pea-Soup Banded or whatever it is called have no ground to stand on.<br/>
 Bards have better armor than rangers because BARDS ARE A PLATE WEARING CLASS.<br/>
The classes that can wear PLATE will have better armor than CHAIN classes. <br/>
Period.  But, Bards will always have better AC armor than Rangers, and by<br/>
definition, this is correct.  When they designed the classes initially, they<br/>
decided that Bards get Plate armor (to make up for our lack of defensive skills<br/>
i am sure) and that Rangers DO NOT.  The only thing that surprises me is that<br/>
rangers are surprised.  Bards have always had better armor than rangers.  Now<br/>
since there is &quot;Bard Only&quot; armor, it puts that fact in the spotlight.  Oh<br/>
well....pardon this mess, i get a little riled up sometimes...:(<br/>
<br/>
hmm...gonna take me a little while how to get the lambent armor components at<br/>
my level...i guess i will try to get in a group of people 9 lvls higher than me<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
