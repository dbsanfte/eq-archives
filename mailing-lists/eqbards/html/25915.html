&gt; took me long enough, huh? We&#39;ve spent time exploring Luclin, still have a<br/>

difficult, then found out that the whole moon is not /supposed/ to be<br/>
pitch-black beyond fifty feet or so.<br/>

This seems to be some kind of insane video bug...it&#39;s not just fogged beyond<br/>
that point, there is simply no graphic display beyond the fogging of fifty<br/>
feet or so, no matter how high the gamma or anything else I tweak.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else had this problem? And if so, what can be done about it? I&#39;ve<br/>
reinstalled my video drivers, which for Verant is as automatic and useless a<br/>
bit of advice as when an ISP asks if you&#39;ve rebooted your machine, no matter<br/>
what the tech support call is about.<br/>
