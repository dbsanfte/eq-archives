You DO realize that what you are describing, the trapping of a creature and then<br/>
killing it without risk to yourself, is a bannable offense right?  That if a GM<br/>
sees you doing it, the least that will happen is that you get a warning and a<br/>
note on your account?<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t, I&#39;ll do you the favour of letting you hear it here first instead<br/>
of from a GM.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a case of RPers whining, this is a case of you cheating, whether you<br/>
knew it or not, or acknowledge it or not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who doesn&#39;t have a problem with what you did could only be a cheater<br/>
themselves, as far as I could imagine.<br/>
