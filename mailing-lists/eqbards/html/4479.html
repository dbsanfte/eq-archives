&gt;I was in CB last night to replace my Dragoon Dirk and decided I always<br/>
&gt;wanted a little wood elf slave girl pet.  I am taking a break from being an<br/>
&gt;experience junky for a few days.  I just completed a vacation trip to kill<br/>

<br/>
At 33rd Level, you can still get some XP in Cazic Thule. Sure,  a lot of<br/>
mobs will be green, but there&#39;s good loot, and for me, it&#39;s ALWAYS been<br/>
fairly easy to get a group there.<br/>
<br/>
Mistmoor is another alternative. To me, however, Mistmoor Is a &quot;Crusbone on<br/>
Steroids&quot;, meaning, a lot of stuff is green, a lot of stuff is red, and<br/>
there are a lot of trains. This is a good zone for us especially if you<br/>
don&#39;t have a drum yet.<br/>
<br/>
Solusek B is very good for you level. EVERYTHING SHOULD be blue or up, but<br/>
dont even think about soloing there.<br/>
<br/>
Lower Gukk is also good for XP, there are two sides you can enter, as well.<br/>
I have played zone warrior on the &quot;live side&quot;, or mino side, where you can<br/>
usually make it to the zone as you dont have to go in very far to find mobs.<br/>
(On a side note.... you can also get one of the best Arm Armors I&#39;ve seen in<br/>
this area, and its relatively easy to get, as well. MUCH easier than rubi<br/>
arms in Cazic). THe OTHER side is the &quot;dead&quot; side, noted for tons of Undead<br/>
Frogloks, Ice Bones, etc. This side has been much harder for my guild. I<br/>
wouldnt do this side without a group for sure.<br/>
<br/>
There are the &quot;singles&quot; areas and mobs you could do... the basement in<br/>
Unrest, giants, griffs, etc. Depends on what you want!<br/>
<br/>
I am sure there are plenty of other areas, too. These are just the ones I&#39;ve<br/>
frequented.<br/>
