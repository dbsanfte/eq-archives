<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975771273">Back in Neverwinter Nights, the way dying was set up was that you went<br/>
back to the nearest entry point that was the closest to Neverwinter (It<br/>
being the center area for the game).  So if a guild was having a promotion<br/>
or squiring in the Gardens area in Neverwinter, folks would either jump into<br/>
a fight (combat took place on another screen) and ask the folks there to<br/>
kill them (which was always fun if that person was of a rival guild).<br/>
     Unless they change the way Bellows can hit you when you target<br/>
yourself, I&#39;ll be using this myself  ;o)<br/>
(It&#39;s not an exploit, it&#39;s a &quot;feature&quot; :oP  )<br/>
