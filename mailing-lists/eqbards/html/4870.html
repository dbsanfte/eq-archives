&gt; no debate.  The higher song should be better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chant is only better if you&#39;re using a drum.  Without it, the<br/>
aggregate str and dex buff is about equal to the str buff of<br/>
Warsong.  The AC buff is similar.  Warsong on top of this<br/>
speeds up your attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Athem may be a bit weak.  It has the same str buff as Warsong,<br/>
but no AC buff, and the speedup is slightly less.  I can&#39;t<br/>
really comment on Celerity since I&#39;m 6 levels away from it,<br/>
but judging from Anthem, I&#39;d tend to agree with the other<br/>
fellow who said that the speedup on these songs just isn&#39;t<br/>
enough.  Yes a bard speeds up the entire group, but an<br/>
enchanter can easily cast the speedup spells on the tanks<br/>
(who are really all that matter).  As a percentage increase to<br/>
damage, I suspect an enchanter casting just one spell on one<br/>
tank may be a bigger factor than a bard speeding up all the<br/>
tanks.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.  I think we should get a message if we succeed in hiding like the rouges<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think knowing if you&#39;ve successfully hidden is stupid.  But<br/>
then I also think hiding should be subjective, dependent on<br/>
each observer (so more observant people/mobs may see you,<br/>
while others do not).  I&#39;ve discussed this with some UO<br/>
friends and while we all agree this would be best, we also<br/>
agree it would be a pain to code and run in an efficient<br/>
manner.<br/>
<br/>
The Selo/SoW/Root bug/feature is kind of a tossup.  Yes it&#39;s a<br/>
pain to have to be careful with druids and shamen.  But it&#39;s<br/>
really nice being able to break root (another discovery I made<br/>
is that Accelerando *ending* will also break root, as it sets<br/>
you to your normal running speed - so if you have Accelerando<br/>
up and zone into a dungeon, and a train is there an roots you,<br/>
you will become free when Accelerando ends).<br/>
<br/>
Right now the biggest fix I&#39;d like to see is to get rid of<br/>
those stupid missed notes on low level songs.  I agree with<br/>
the other person who said that hitting a different spell every<br/>
6 seconds (4 actually) is not that much of a twitch factor.<br/>
But having to do it while assidiously watching the chat window<br/>
looking for the red &quot;you miss a note&quot; messages interspersed<br/>
with with &quot;a mob HITS you&quot; messages *does* make it a twitch<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
If I hit the song button, that means I want to start a song.  <br/>
If I miss a note, I should be penalized for the time, but the<br/>
game should automatically try again until I finally start the<br/>
song or until I hit the button again to give up.  I&#39;d even do<br/>
the same thing with bashes - if I was playing a song and was<br/>
bashed out of it, logic would dictate that I really wanted to<br/>
be playing that song, so the game should automatically restart<br/>
it for me.  There&#39;s a difference between difficulty and<br/>
annoyance.  The gameplay difficulty increase for these changes<br/>
is the time penalty to restart your song - that is fine.<br/>
Requiring that I watch for these messages and manually restart<br/>
the song every time I see one (and sometimes accidently<br/>
stopping a song that I successfully started because I thought<br/>
I saw one) is just plain annoying, and very arcadish.<br/>
