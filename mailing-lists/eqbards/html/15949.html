<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394012725">No Offense taken....i have seen alot of really bad names, but I picked mine for<br/>
an actual roleplaying purpose (which seems to be unique enough on its own).  I<br/>
modeled Glyphed as the &quot;Anti-Bard&quot; (no offense guys, i still like my bard<br/>
better).  I wrote a brief history on Glyphed...it can be found at:<br/>
<br/>
www.wrathofdragonclaw.org  <br/>
(you have to scroll down the left frame to the bottom, and then click on the<br/>
&quot;Glyphed&quot; button)  <br/>
<br/>
I figured since Mistmoore and League of Antonican Bards were factions in<br/>
opposition, it was actually an opportunity to roleplay something in my<br/>
patterned disjointed and goofy way.<br/>
<br/>
some of the goofy names that i have seen on Prexus:<br/>
Kittka t&#39;bar (actually a guildmate)<br/>
Tommy Hillfinger (which has been changed by gms)<br/>
Buffysommers (don&#39;t know if she has a surname....DE necro btw)<br/>
<br/>
one that i liked was<br/>
<br/>
Xtra Large (troll warrior i think)<br/>
<br/>
but i am sure everyone has a ton of names they have seen like this<br/>
<br/>
Kaleid<br/>
23rd Song Half Elf Bard<br/>
Glyphed Aegiss<br/>
27th Level Dark Elf Magician<br/>
&lt;Wave of the Dark Tide&gt;<br/>
Prexus<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m suprised verant lets you keep that name, but then again, despite the so<br/>
&gt;called rules on character names I have seen a lot of stupid player names<br/>
&gt;(not saying yours is stupid).  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;I *almost* reported a pc one afternoon at the bazaar on E&#39;ci - I was<br/>
&gt;auctioning a couple of black pearls at the tunnel and got a tell from an<br/>
&gt;enchanter named &quot;Balonie&quot; who said to come meet her by the first inn.  I ran<br/>
&gt;over and when I got close to her I saw that her last name was &quot;Sandwych&quot; -<br/>
&gt;and this was no newbie either.  It kind of ticked me off at first but I<br/>
&gt;finally I decided not to be whistle blower and went ahead and sold the<br/>
&gt;pearls and went about my business.<br/>

&quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>
adultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
