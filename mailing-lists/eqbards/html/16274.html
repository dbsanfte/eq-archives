&gt; Right, but all it takes is one of these groups who will not agree to a<br/>
&gt; compromise to force an intervention by &quot;Big Brother&quot;.  They make it<br/>
&gt; perfectly clear that No One will like the decision that &quot;Big Brother&quot; is<br/>
&gt; going to make so you better sort it out yourselves.  This is just an<br/>
&gt; invitation to get someone to officially irritate someone for those who<br/>
&gt; desire to irritate.  They know they won&#39;t like the compromise already, so<br/>
&gt; they are perfectly willing to use the threat of forcing others to accept<br/>
&gt; &quot;Big Brother&#39;s&quot; unacceptable ruling to bend reasonable people to their will.<br/>

made agreement that&#39;s been in effect in Sol B on our server. They did it<br/>
the first day of the new policy.<br/>
