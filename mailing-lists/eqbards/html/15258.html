<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146019363">Thanks John for the logs, i&#39;m going through them now. <br/>
A few comments.  First I grabbed eqparse and used the<br/>
same program you did I believe and got the same<br/>
summary numbers so I got the log files ok and intact. <br/>
I believe that when you run analysis on the log with<br/>
eqparse it finds &quot;soandso saved.&quot; to determine your<br/>
name and a /who on the zone to determine the rest of<br/>
your information.  I deleted the /who entry with you<br/>
on it and it no longer knew your race/class. :)  I<br/>
whipped up a little parser of my own to extract some<br/>
of the data I wanted and found this distribution. <br/>
(Btw eqparse does do a histogram for you but its<br/>
overall combat statistics so the easy way to get this<br/>
distribution is strip out all your pierces and run<br/>
eqparse on the log again.)  These are the numbers of<br/>
hits for each damage number given with the indicated<br/>
weapon in primary hand.  <br/>
<br/>

*the 0&#39;s were marked as &quot;miss&quot; and do not include<br/>
enemy dodges, parry&#39;s or ripostes.<br/>
<br/>
Preliminary Analysis:  You&#39;ll see that every hit was<br/>
given a +7 damage...this is consistant with the<br/>
primary hand damage bonus of (level-25)/3 (subject was<br/>
46 in the test).  You will see 2 large modal spikes in<br/>
each column.  1 at 8 points of damage and one at<br/>
2*dmg+bonus (21 for Wak, 23 for Yak).  Also note that<br/>
the min dmg spikes are not insignificant in size.  <br/>
<br/>
Another note.  If you&#39;re looking at hit %&#39;s something<br/>
to consider is how does the combat formula work with<br/>
respect to dodge/parry/riposte?  My presumption is<br/>
that A checks for a successfull hit against B, then if<br/>
successfull B gets a dodge check, if it fails, a parry<br/>
check, if it succeeds a riposte check.  If this<br/>
supposition is correct then d/p/r&#39;s would count into<br/>
your chance to hit.<br/>
<br/>
So i&#39;ve written a rather long and windy blurb<br/>
here...just ignore me if you&#39;re not interested. :)<br/>
