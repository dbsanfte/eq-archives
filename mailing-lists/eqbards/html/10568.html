 </span></blockquote>Yes, thanks.  Got a set this past weekend.  I don&#39;t care if they ARE <br/>
nerfed; I fly!  Had a quite a successful weekend (for me).  In addition <br/>
to the drums, I got my Mudwater Rune, Fiery Vambraces, Shin Greaves, <br/>
Basalt Carapace, and won a lotto for the Ring of the Goblin Lord.  Plus, <br/>
I got to explore Sol A for the first time, mapped lots of Upper Guk, and <br/>
saw some of Lower Guk and parts of Cazic Thule that I had never ventured <br/>
into before.  Killed all sorts of creatures on my personal hate list <br/>
using Chain/Fear (Dorn died three times - I&#39;m still not even), got in my <br/>
first Charm kiting practice (I stink at it).  Oh, and I got a full level <br/>
out of the deal.<br/>
