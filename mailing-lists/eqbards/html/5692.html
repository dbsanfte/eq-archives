<div id="ygrps-yiv-525800010"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; is implemented and you pull with a dot spell it will no <br/>
&gt; longer do damage because it will be chasing after you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Then you stop, and it starts taking damage again.  The <br/>
&gt; increased duration makes up for the lost ticks of damage<br/>
&gt; during the pull.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s incorrect if we&#39;re all reading it correctly. It&#39;s<br/>
not being based on whether YOU the player are moving. It&#39;s<br/>
being based on whether the mob is moving. So the argument<br/>
above stands. If you pull with a DOT spell and the mob<br/>
is running towards you - the DOT isn&#39;t doing any damage.<br/>
<br/>
And again, long term damage is not as preferred to me as<br/>
damage done up front. I&#39;d prefer to have a lot of damage<br/>
in the beginning and end the fight faster rather than<br/>
the DOT lasting longer.</div>
