<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936668760">That should be it.  If you login, and have problems, uninstall and then<br/>
reinstall your video card drivers.  If you have a geforce card, keep in mind<br/>
Nvidia released new drivers today (or yesterday..heh, not sure).  If you<br/>
reinstall drivers, go get the new ones.  You&#39;ll want the newest drivers as<br/>
soon as possible, though, regardless of issues, or lack of them.  :)<br/>
<br/>
If you *still* have problems, there are a couple things in the everquest.com<br/>
Dev Corner forum.  For example, I have a GeForce256, and I was having<br/>
trouble with my video during the DX8 test period.  There was no &quot;fog&quot;, and<br/>
things in the distance, even sections of the ground, would pop in when I was<br/>
in range.  Everything looked washed out, lots of little stuff.  I entered<br/>
the line &quot;UseTnL=FALSE&quot; into my eqclient.ini, and it took care of all of<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope the servers are up when I get home...hehe.<br/>
