&gt; &gt;&gt; A fellow bard has heard rumor of a bard only &quot;ultimate&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; weapon called the <br/>
&gt; &gt; quill that procs gate.  He says it is found in the Plane of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hate on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maestro of Rancor. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Plane of Hate?  I thought that wasn&#39;t going to be &quot;open&quot; to the general<br/>
&gt; public until march (when, allegedly, the expansion is coming out).<br/>
