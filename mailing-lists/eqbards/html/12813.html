&gt;   I definitely need to test this again, because the flute made no<br/>
&gt;   difference whatsoever in any faction adjustments when I used it<br/>
&gt;   in the past.  Dubious to amiable?  Are you sure?  That&#39;s a bit<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It could be that it affected the first faction adjustment - dubious to<br/>
indifferent, next pulse flute is equipped = indifferent to amiable. Might be<br/>
something to try when testing - see if you can bump it up twice? first dose<br/>
of the song without the flute, second dose with it?? Just an idea. heh<br/>
