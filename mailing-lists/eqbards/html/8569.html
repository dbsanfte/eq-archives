 </span></blockquote>Umm...  Uhh...  I *think* so.  Probably.  If I recall correctly my skill is<br/>
currently at &quot;Feeble&quot;, not &quot;Very Bad&quot;, which would indicate a coupla points<br/>
in it.  I WILL check tonight.<br/>

&gt; Yow!  I hope this isn&#39;t accurate and that some other problem was affecting<br/>
&gt; you.  If thay have truly changed DDD and brass skill raises in this way I<br/>
&gt; may as well plan on never buying a horn.  You did remember to<br/>
&gt; train 1 point<br/>
&gt; in it at the trainer right?  I know you cnnot use any of the music skills<br/>
&gt; unless you train that first point and get the &quot;You have learned the basics<br/>
&gt; of XXX&quot; message.  If you&#39;re not sure, go try to train it and see.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m Crier Sharpsong, a 26th half-elf Bard on Fennin Ro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been having a recurring problem getting my Brass skill up and would<br/>
&gt; like to ask people here about it.  I&#39;ve read time and again that I should<br/>
&gt; venture to Arena or a PvP area, start Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord and leave<br/>
&gt; it running indefinitely to increase my skill.  However, I have not been<br/>
&gt; successful in getting that to work.  Initially I went to Arena in<br/>
&gt; Rathe Mts.<br/>
&gt; and tried this.  I had read that you only needed to be in the area, not<br/>
&gt; actually in the PvP area itself, so I equipped my Minotaur Horn, fired up,<br/>
&gt; fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, DDD<br/>
&gt; and went to a restaurant for dinner.  Before I left I noticed that the<br/>
&gt; &quot;plays horn&quot; graphic wasn&#39;t running, but didn&#39;t think much about it.  Got<br/>
&gt; back from dinner to find zero skill increase.  Hmm..  Ok, perhaps I *do*<br/>
&gt; have to be in the PvP area, so I tried that.  Same results.  Ok,<br/>
&gt; maybe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the Minotaur Horn - maybe it&#39;s the problem.  So the next time I was in the<br/>
&gt; bank and thought about it, I traded out my Minotaur Horn (tired of the bag<br/>
&gt; in my wrist anyhow) for a standard store-bought horn.  Last night I tried<br/>
&gt; practicing this song in the PvP area of Freeport and it again wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; actually play.  Well now I have gone to Kelethin and bought Screech and am<br/>
&gt; completely unable to start the song due to my brass skill.  I<br/>
&gt; tried to start<br/>
&gt; Screech (literally) about 300 times last night with and without the horn<br/>
&gt; equipped and had *one* success - not too useful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When there is not a mob within range of my song, what I get is<br/>
&gt; DDD starts, I<br/>
&gt; briefly get some orange flares from my hands and then it&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; me standing<br/>
&gt; there.  No playing horn graphic, no orange flares, nothing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone comment on this and/or offer a solution?  I *need*<br/>
&gt; this song, but<br/>
&gt; if Verant has changed it so that the only way for me to increase my Brass<br/>
&gt; skill is to fight experience-giving mobs with it, I&#39;m screwed.  I<br/>
&gt; *WILL* die<br/>
&gt; trying to get DDD and/or Screech fired up against a blue mob.<br/>
