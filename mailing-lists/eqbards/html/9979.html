<div id="ygrps-yiv-970113401">You should think yourself lucky, I have got base Cha 85 and I have a -18<br/>
hit due to my Staff of Writhing and Grotesque Mask, I am currently saving<br/>
for a Platinum Star Ruby Veil (+9Dex/Cha) but they are so expensive and<br/>
it&#39;s hard to find people that can make them!!<br/>
I was a bit dissappointed with the stats on the Lambent Vambraces, +1 Cha<br/>
doesn&#39;t really make alot of difference, they should of made it +3/4 just to<br/>
make it that little bit better.<br/>
Does anyone know the stats for the Lambent Boots??<br/>

My CHA is around 105 with standard equipment on, another 15 if I use my<br/>
Crude Stein.<br/>
<br/>
It has become apparent in reviewing the last couple of posts in this thread<br/>
that I&#39;m either not coordinated enough to pull this off or I just need more<br/>
practice.  I&#39;ll try and hit the Orc Cents again and give it another go, but<br/>
hell, if I can&#39;t even finish off two Orcs without losing half a bubble of<br/>
health, how am I going to fare with Froon and Choon?<br/>
<br/>
Charming Griffs or HGs is simply laughable to me.  I would die so damn<br/>
fast...<br/>

&gt; From posts I&#39;ve seen - Charisma is the overriding factor when it comes to<br/>
&gt; the charm line of things.<br/>
