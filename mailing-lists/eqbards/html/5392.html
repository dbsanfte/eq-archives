<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854814310"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think a lot of you people gushing about how easy it is to make money via<br/>
&gt; loot are exaggerating.  I have a 23rd monk that works his butt off and he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; never had more than about 125pp in the bank at any one time.  I&#39;ve spent time<br/>
&gt; in unrest.  Where&#39;s the money there?  FS weapons?  The cash drops aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; *that* great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if you have some advice for a player that is really tired of reading about<br/>
&gt; how others have more than 1,000pp in the bank, let &#39;er rip.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, well, I&#39;m level 39 now so cash comes in more freely. Giants drop<br/>
0-35plat usually, might wipe out a few dozen giants in a day. Most any<br/>
monster I kill drops 4 plat in cash, plus fine steel a third of the time<br/>
(another 5 plat), plus occasional bronze (which is sold for 20plat or<br/>
given away).<br/>
<br/>
So, with that, it&#39;s safe to say that without paying attention at all to<br/>
loot, it&#39;s easy to make 100 plat a day. If I really wanted to make plat,<br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be hard to make 500 plat, although it might be somewhat<br/>
boring. =)</div>
