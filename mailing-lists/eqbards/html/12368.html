<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095281355">I agree.<br/>
The only time I do not get along with another bard is usually when one of<br/>
the powergamers create a bard twink (Ykeesha, All the best non planes, non<br/>
no drop equipment) and spend time Training the group I am in because they<br/>
bite off more than they can chew. hopefully, they don&#39;t play that bard long.<br/>
They also cannot seem to play more than one song at a time;)<br/>

  All the bards I know are good people.  It&#39;s odd.  Bards really<br/>
<br/>
  stick together more so than any other class I&#39;ve seen.  It could<br/>
<br/>
  be the friendly group mentality we have.  A bard is truly a <br/>
<br/>
  different beast.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I noticed that a L50 cleric was trying to powerlevel a bard<br/>
<br/>
  the other day.  Needless to say, I&#39;ve seen very few bards<br/>
<br/>
  powerleveled.  It&#39;s not an easy thing to do.  Most powergamers<br/>
<br/>
  cannot stand being so weak, because in their mind if you cannot<br/>
<br/>
  heal, melee, or nuke then you are no good.  The inherent bard<br/>
<br/>
  trait is to group, and to powergame you cannot do such.  <br/>
<br/>
  Therefore you build this community of very intelligent, patient,<br/>
<br/>
  fun, and likable people.  I&#39;ve never seen two bards really hate<br/>
<br/>
  each other like I&#39;ve seen wizards hate wizards, and druids hate<br/>
<br/>
  druids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I love bards.<br/>
