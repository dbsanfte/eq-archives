&gt; I think the time has come that I pick up an ebw.  I&#39;ve got a ykesha for my<br/>
&gt; primary, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m willing to do that camp again for a while.<br/>
&gt; The ebw seems like a good choice for a secondary weapon anyway since its<br/>
&gt; faster than the ykesha, and off hand proc&#39;s never seem to happen much for<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, not having a whole lot of experience with MM, I know how to get to<br/>
&gt; the maid and butler rooms, but I&#39;m not really very familiar with spawns<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; aggro radius&#39; in there, I was just wondering if anyone can offer any<br/>
&gt; advice.<br/>
&gt; Where is the best/safest place to camp?  Can I do it solo, or should I<br/>
&gt; bring<br/>
&gt; along anyone else?  About how long does it take on average to get both<br/>
&gt; fangs?<br/>
&gt; Any advice would be helpful.<br/>
