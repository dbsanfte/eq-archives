<b>Subject:</b> Sitting down during a dragon raid <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141645577">Even though its something that I will not be able to participate in for a<br/>
long time, I have enjoyed reading about all the strategy and tactics that<br/>
are required for a successful dragon raid.  Whenever I read a post that has<br/>
a lot of good info, i.e. the recent post listing all the dragon raid<br/>
equipment, I file it away for future reference.<br/>
<br/>
One of the big topics discussed recently is the feasibility of taking<br/>
characters lower than high 40s-50 on dragon raids.  The primary concern is<br/>
that lower level characters are more susceptible to dragon fear spell and<br/>
will end up hurting the raid more than helping it because they could start a<br/>
train while fleeing in fear. <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m wondering is this: If a bard is participating in a dragon raid and<br/>
is sitting down for the duration of the fight, what happens if they fail the<br/>
resist check for the dragon fear spell?  Will they stand up and start<br/>
running or will they remain sitting?  If you remain sitting even when you<br/>
are feared, then that means any bard level 32+ could participate in a dragon<br/>
raid.  On E&#39;ci, a lot of the raiding parties have a standard group of five<br/>
clerics and one bard.  The mission of the five clerics is to continuously<br/>
cast Stun on the dragon and cast res on anyone who dies.  The bard is there<br/>
to sing mana song to pump up the clerics.  A lower level bard could perform<br/>
this duty while the higher level bards perform the resist buffing duties.<br/>
<br/>
Of course its all a moot point if the dragon fear spell makes you stand up<br/>
and start running.<br/>
