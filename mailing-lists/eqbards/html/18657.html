<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971304393">Hi Everyone ,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this mailing list and have only recently<br/>
started to play a bard after my characters made it to<br/>
level 50.<br/>
<br/>
I started a newbie bard because I can remeber one day<br/>
while hunting SG&#39;s in Oasis - I saw a bard defeat a SG<br/>
without the SG laying a hand on him. <br/>
<br/>
This intrigued me as my 50 Ranger has to tank, kite<br/>
and use a lot of brain power to take down an SG and it<br/>
takes well over 10 minutes to kill one solo.<br/>
<br/>
Well - I do digress ( bard character is affecting me<br/>
already ) the question I wanted to ask was - DO WE<br/>
DANCE.<br/>
<br/>
Many people come up to me and ask me to dance because<br/>
they can see I am a bard ( flashing lights etc. ) I<br/>
then do a kind of dance that involves walking<br/>
backwards ( moonwalking type thing ) coupled with a<br/>
few other moves. But I really doubt if this is Bard<br/>
Dancing.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the anim of the Male bard that looks kind<br/>
of like a Pied Piper jumping on eggs when the male<br/>
bard plays the flute. I can only assume this is the<br/>
dancing that people are talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Do we have another DANCE anim ?<br/>
