<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370712965">Ok you&#39;ve all convinced me.  Plus I got to actuall see one.  But I need to<br/>
know one thing.  What is the right price to pay for a Dragoon Dirk?  The<br/>
best place to get them is Felwithe right?  Its my understanding that they<br/>
come from crushbone.  Any help would be greatly appriciated.<br/>
