<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111439536">That&#39;s ok, to make it up to Slyde, Verant has included in this patch a <br/>
trombone. It enhances wind songs and they&#39;ve added a special disorienting <br/>
attack called &quot;Spit Valve of Doom&quot; which causes all mobs that chase a bard <br/>
to slip and slide.<br/>

&gt;Actually the reason for the deaths had nothing to do with aria. It was <br/>
&gt;part of a series of &quot;fixes&quot; to prevent chain and over casting that broke <br/>
&gt;bards.  All bard songs were effected Aria was the only one that got people <br/>
&gt;killed.  No bard songs would refresh so you got one pulse had to stop the <br/>
&gt;song and then had to restart it.  Aria at the time had about 4 seconds of <br/>
&gt;duration beyond the pulse just enough to get you out of safty and into a <br/>
&gt;long drop :)<br/>
&gt;The next batch which fixed that problem then made it that weapons would <br/>
&gt;not proc while bard song was active.  That took them about a week or so to <br/>
&gt;fix.  The lists go on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Our Aria still will allow us to gain altitude and so does caster <br/>
&gt;recasting.  However there is now a &quot;glass celling&quot; that dictates how high <br/>
&gt;you can go in a specific area.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The problem we old bards are talking about has nothing to do with Selos and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Arie of Eagles stacking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At one time non bards could cast their levitate spells before they ran out;<br/>
&gt; &gt; which made the levitate higher - so they could use multiple casts to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Climb&quot;.  Verant nerfed it by requiring it to completely end before<br/>
&gt; &gt; recasting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This broke our levitate song.  The second and subsequent pulse of AOE <br/>
&gt; (and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; assume Selo&#39;s Traveling - didn&#39;t have it then) wouldn&#39;t work until it ran<br/>
&gt; &gt; out and you fell.  The unlucky bards who found this out the hard way - and<br/>
&gt; &gt; used the song THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO WORK often fell to their death.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It was clear that Verant made a change to the spell system without doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; ANY testing on the bard class.        Literally 19 seconds of testing <br/>
&gt; would have<br/>
&gt; &gt; caught this bug.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums didn&#39;t add to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; affect of Selo&#39;s. Again - many bards died expecting their songs to work<br/>
&gt; &gt; they way they were designed (i.e. running away from mobs etc). In this case<br/>
&gt; &gt; - 3 seconds of testing would have caught it. They admitted it was a bug -<br/>
&gt; &gt; but refused to fix it until the next patch went in.  They said it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; critical enough (we were upset about this wondering the reaction from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; player base is SOW was broken...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure other old-timers could probably come up with a half-dozen or more<br/>
&gt; &gt; bugs caused by changes to the spell system not intending to affect Bards<br/>
&gt; &gt; that were introduced into the live servers because the most trivial level<br/>
&gt; &gt; of testing the bard class wasn&#39;t done by Verant.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Heck the Selo&#39;s speed bug was even discovered on Test by players and<br/>
&gt; &gt; reported to Verant - and they missed it...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a nessesary nerf because<br/>
&gt; &gt; bards would outrun guides and make fun of them. Now the will plummet to<br/>
&gt; &gt; their death in many areas<br/>
