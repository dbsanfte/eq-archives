<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-767261329">I&#39;m sorry but I STRONGLY disagree.  I don&#39;t see how raw data from ANY survey<br/>
is useful to ANY bards young or old.  Raw data is raw data.  It&#39;s NOT the<br/>
least bit useful to a beginning bard.  Seeing 40 lists of people&#39;s stats is<br/>
not going to educate someone on the ramifications of low strength up the<br/>
road.  If they don&#39;t know that 75 str means you can&#39;t wear bronze already<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll figure that out if they see 40 posts of people with 90+<br/>
strength.  If you want to help young bards - put together of FAQ (This list<br/>
needs one bad - but I do confess I&#39;m too lazy to do it myself!)  If you want<br/>
this to be useful - then perhaps asking people to post WHY they selected the<br/>
stats they did - particularly if they restarted their char.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve participated in several Internet Email Mailing lists that have gone<br/>
from great-to-mediocre-to-worse and then I sadly drop out.  &quot;Surveys&quot; on the<br/>
list has been problem on some.  I believe answers to surveys belong OFF of<br/>
the list and in private Email.  Anyone interested can request the info from<br/>
the person taking the Survey.  The person building the survey will then post<br/>
the results and everyone is interested.<br/>
<br/>
As far as bandwidth.  I AM on several other lists.  When I have to download<br/>
85-150 emails off my mailserver - it takes a significant amount of time.  I<br/>
go out of town and for several days and that number snowballs.  If 250<br/>
people respond to a survey on a 250 person list that&#39;s 62,500 emails.<br/>
Certainly this isn&#39;t going to have any impact on the Internet as a whole -<br/>
and perhaps not even OneList&#39;s server.  But if 62,500 emails doesn&#39;t<br/>
constitute SPAM - I don&#39;t know what does...<br/>
<br/>
In-My-Humble-Opinion - this is one of the best lists I&#39;ve been on.  As of<br/>
late my rating of it has dropped a bit.  We&#39;ve had a few flame wars and the<br/>
twinking subject that seemed to refuse to die.  Mailing lists constitute a<br/>
&quot;Community&quot; (read Esther Dyson&#39;s 2.0 about this - it&#39;s a great book).<br/>
&quot;Communities&quot; need rules.  I&#39;m am absolutely willing to accede to the will<br/>
of the majority.  My vote - keep survey raw data to private email keep it<br/>
off the list.  If the majority of the group disagrees - I&#39;ll happily shut up<br/>
(or unfortunately leave if I find that 90 pct of the postings don&#39;t interest<br/>
me anymore as had happened on other Mailing Lists I was on)...<br/>
<br/>
Sylly - please don&#39;t take this as a flame - I respect your opinion  - I just<br/>
respectfully disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; Stop with this bandwidth b.s. - the internet is made out of huge<br/>
bandwidth.<br/>
&gt; Even 200 emails on bard stats is not gonna make your modem light blink.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boring to you is another issue - but dont say bandwidth when you mean<br/>
&gt; boring.  Delete or filter stuff you dont wanna read.  (hehe you can prolly<br/>
&gt; &quot;killfile&quot; me and save half your &quot;bandwidth&quot; &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is valuable info for young bards here -- when you are young is the<br/>
&gt; time to know how you compare.  For example, with my lowly 75 in str - I<br/>
CANT<br/>
&gt; carry a full set of bronze.  If you wanna be a bard and wear plate and<br/>
wear<br/>
&gt; bronze plate, then you better have alot of str.  I got lots of str booster<br/>
&gt; and am bearly able to walk around with a minimal amount of stuff and all<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; visible bronze pieces except boots - cant wear with being encumbered from<br/>
&gt; the git go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sylly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, if there are young bards out there who want plate, then they need to<br/>
&gt; know - cuz a restart at level 5 is LOTS better than a restart at level 15.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;People - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE respond via private email to this survey.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt;am sure the majority of us - while perhaps interested in the results of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;survey - aren&#39;t interested in the raw data.  I am guessing there are<br/>
&gt; &gt;something like 250+ people on this list (no clue - just a guess) - making<br/>
&gt; &gt;250 people see your stats is a big waste of bandwidth..<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
