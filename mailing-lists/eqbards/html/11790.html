<br/>
  0 people in SolB is rough (will never happen tho).<br/>
  24 people in SolB imo is perfect (4 groups can run the whole place)<br/>
  32 people seems to be average (my happiness is declining however)<br/>
  40+ people is bad (and I get irritable.  lots of complaining in ooc<br/>
      about who stole whose kobold.  or ten people shouting for groups<br/>
      or a list to even get into groups.  just plain nasty)<br/>
<br/>
  On Innoruuk, we have waiting lists to get into specific room<br/>
  groups, such as the king+adjoining rooms and the bat/bug entrance.<br/>
  On E&#39;ci I heard 3 separate groups each take the king, priest, champ.<br/>

  When you grow up, your tune will change silky.  You all think unrest<br/>
  and highkeep are bad, you aint seen nothing yet.<br/>
