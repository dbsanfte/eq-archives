<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731040905">Now let me get this straight. As i understand it the chance to dual<br/>
wield is checked every time you attack, right? therefore you should<br/>
equip a fast PRIMARY weapon, the speed of the secondary shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
anything to do with the chance to Dual, right?<br/>

&gt;I found that at level 17, using a fast second weapon, I got to the max (90 I<br/>
&gt;think) rather quickly.  It was worth it the moment I dropped my shield and<br/>
&gt;picked up my second weapon.<br/>
