<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902259466">I just hit 37 in OT.  I find my best xp is in pickup groups.  I never <br/>
really was good at solo.  I did fear kite in LOIO, decent xp, but <br/>
charm kite and denons kite can&#39;t seem to get the knack.  Any <br/>
suggestions?  I heard that you can kite 2 or 3 thing with brass and <br/>
sow, but always wound up beaten and fearing it to keep from dying.  <br/>
Maybe the new tables will allow me to hit harder.  My best so far is <br/>
36 with 11/29 icetooth.</div>
