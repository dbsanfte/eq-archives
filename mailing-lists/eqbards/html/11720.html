<div id="ygrps-yiv-193085113">I haven&#39;t made a run on the castle yet but I have been able to go up<br/>
through the front door with invis. I think the best way to approach the<br/>
music room is to go invis up to the foyer. The first pull will be the two<br/>
gargoyles from the room. From there, the music room is through the hallway<br/>
between the gargoyle spots and behind the wall in ront of you, getting<br/>
through it going either left or right for a few paces.<br/>
	Watch out for the will sappers in there, though. I think they can see<br/>
invis.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey<br/>

Greetings!<br/>
Yesterday I was allowed to tag along with the Esprit de Corps guild on Cazic<br/>
Thule server.  We did an assault on Mistmoore castle.  4 groups of 30&#39;s to<br/>
low 40&#39;s (i am lvl 35) went in the secret way from the crypt up to the<br/>
bedroom.  We cleared all the hallways and the bathrooom, then set up base in<br/>
the bedroom.  Got the black silk gloves off the 10th Deathly Usher I looted.<br/>
  Not as common as I was expecting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I had the gypsy musicians on track, but the groups were reluctant to<br/>
pull them.  They said there were 5 hard mobs between us and the musicians.<br/>
I believe it.  At one point our 4 groups were completely destroyed.  The<br/>
spawns there are very deadly.  We often were fighting 6-8 mobs.  Perhaps<br/>
part of the problem was the groups learning to work together.  Anyway, for<br/>
those who have yet to get the gypsy lute, be advised that this is no small<br/>
task.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I was able to get the Deep Water Goblin&#39;s Opaline helm on<br/>
the 3rd try.  I knew nothing of these DW Goblins, so be warned that<br/>
attacking one will likely get you 5-6 plus their pets.<br/>
