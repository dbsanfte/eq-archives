Put that up there with: (at early 20&#39;s)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Play the mana Song&quot;<br/>
(Then the bard launches into a long explanation that the &quot;Mana Song&quot; comes<br/>
at 32 and why Jig of Vigor doesn&#39;t really increase mana and why it seems to<br/>
increase mana)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay, but play the mana song&quot;....<br/>
<br/>
My advise (probably obvious but worth stating) is to join a guild - where<br/>
you can explain these things to people who hopefully will be intelligent<br/>
enough to understand what we&#39;re doing...<br/>
<br/>
Back to the Jig topic - it&#39;s amazing how many people still insist that it<br/>
speeds mana.  I was in a group with a 31 Bard who argued with me - that he<br/>
tested it.  He tested it by timing how long it took for the casters to get<br/>
full mana after a battle.  When I asked if the casters always made sure they<br/>
used up their mana - his response &quot;What difference would that make?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another case I was with another bard - and a Druid.  I asked the Bard why he<br/>
was doing Jig?  Because the Druid asked him.  I told the Druid that it<br/>
didn&#39;t (the usual blah-blah-blah).  Her response (I can&#39;t remember exact<br/>
words - but to the affect) - She had a 41 level Bard character - so she<br/>
obviously knew more about it than I did (I was level 27 at the time).<br/>
(Pardon me for having a life!)<br/>
<br/>
Back to your initial complaint..  You were in a no-win situation - if you<br/>
tried to point out their flawed thinking - you would have looked like sour<br/>
grapes.  Those people were especially ignorant - given that since Anthem<br/>
doesn&#39;t stack - you couldn&#39;t have been doing what he was if you wanted to!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - good luck to you - and hopefully you&#39;ll find better groups!<br/>

&gt; Was in a full group tonight with 2 clerics, shaman, paladin and an<br/>
&gt; additional bard doing MM yard trash.  Two clerics.  A shaman.  LOH.  How<br/>
&gt; could I die?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Foolish, yes I know.<br/>
