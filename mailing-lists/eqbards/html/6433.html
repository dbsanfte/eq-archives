From the latest patch message...all I can say is WOOOOOO! No more chasing<br/>
SoW&#39;d goblins though SolA like some Keystone Cops movie!! Annnd, Bard Nuking<br/>
looks like it juuuust got an upgrade, as well, Fear/chains is untouched! I<br/>
have edited out all parts unrelated to Bards.<br/>

PVP Changes:<br/>
- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more<br/>
viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells<br/>
cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would<br/>
do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a<br/>
20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon<br/>
the<br/>
m.<br/>
<br/>
- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.<br/>
- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.<br/>
- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed - AoE spells will now effect<br/>
more monsters.<br/>
<br/>
DoT Changes:<br/>
- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell<br/>
works.<br/>
- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no<br/>
change to how a DoT spell works.<br/>
- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens<br/>
every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.<br/>
- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased. If the monster<br/>
moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the<br/>
DoT as it would before the patch. If the monster moves for less then 18<br/>
seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done<br/>
before the patch. If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the<br/>
fight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch.</div>
