<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836893917">Over the last few days, I&#39;ve met up with some people I once knew<br/>
  a long time ago and also people whom I have no recollection of ever<br/>
  knowing.<br/>
<br/>
  Of the people I knew, I played with them in Permafrost long before<br/>
  Brad made his post about &#39;upgrading&#39; drops in there.  Hell in beta,<br/>
  I owned that place.  Anyway, I started with a regular group in there<br/>
  around L14.  I often found myself in there alone night after night.<br/>
  I could not convince people to come, some people didn&#39;t even know<br/>
  where or what permafrost was.  Around L19-L20, still working perma<br/>
  I met a few people who are now (as of yesterday) L32.  Seven or <br/>
  eight months ago they were my level (L19).  And now all of them call<br/>
  me a &#39;powergamer&#39; telling me that I &#39;haven&#39;t enjoyed the game as<br/>
  much as they have&#39;.  This is where about 10% of my daily humor<br/>
  comes from, as it&#39;s worth a /chuckle.<br/>
<br/>
  Then and again, I get tells from people out of the blue when I&#39;m<br/>
  in a zone about &#39;what does a L50 want in this zone?&#39;  I was passing<br/>
  through Blackburrow the other day, and had just zoned in and I got<br/>
  a tell from some L20 person asking me why I was there.  I could have,<br/>
  without a doubt, asked him the same thing.  These same people also <br/>
  are whining to me about &#39;how bored you must be to come into X zone<br/>
  since you powerleveled to 50&#39;.  Doesn&#39;t everyone realize the only<br/>
  way to the Icy North is via Blackburrow?  I thought as the server<br/>
  populace had become more mature in information that things like that<br/>
  would leak out.  Regardless this guy hounded me for being L50 in the<br/>
  zone.  Time to break out Screech and ride a few trains to zone ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  /rant<br/>

  I&#39;m bored as hell in EQ because I want some more quests or some<br/>
  more challenges.  I don&#39;t consider giving a mob 10k more hp or an<br/>
  attack which does 900 dmg challenging.  That&#39;s just frustrating.<br/>
  One could argue there are new quests in the PoS, however I cannot<br/>
  stroll up there anytime I want to work on them.  My boredom stems<br/>
  mostly from lack of new things to experience.  If I wanted to talk<br/>
  and chat all day, I&#39;d irc or something.  An integral part of my day<br/>
  now consists of learning more mechanics.  I timed mana regain on<br/>
  my druid medding, standing, and sitting not medding.  But that&#39;s <br/>
  sorta boring too hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  They&#39;ve pushed the expansion back a month.  What in the world have<br/>
  they been doing?  All the excuses I hear on their behalf seem to<br/>
  suggest they aren&#39;t doing much to the existing EQ, because they<br/>
  are hard at work on the expansion.  While polygonal streams, and<br/>
  better detailed texture maps on giants is cool and all, and while<br/>
  making the trees 3d (finally) is neat, Verant needs better thought<br/>
  out AI and zone pathing which could drastically improve the existing<br/>
  game.  I&#39;m not holding my breath for the expansion in April.  It&#39;s<br/>
  going to be the same AI, the same poor pathing, the same mobs with<br/>
  ac/hp/atk upgrades.  I&#39;m sick of goblins, I&#39;m sick of gnolls, the<br/>
  planes are being tweaked so badly that people rarely even want to <br/>
  go there anymore.  The 6 hours I spent in hateplane this weekend<br/>
  yielded one warrior pants and one cleric shield.  Six f&#39;ing hours<br/>
  over half the zone cleared, and two items.  Then the server crashes,<br/>
  and the plane is reset.  Before that I linkdied 2 times because <br/>
  of this constant network code upgrade they&#39;ve done.  My SBLive<br/>
  desktop crashes only add to the annoyment.  Latest DirectX and<br/>
  latest sbl drivers and I cast &#39;Ring of Desktop&#39; every day now<br/>
  it seems.<br/>
<br/>
  A GM once visited us in the Plane of Fear.  His words stick in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
  -- &quot;It&#39;s all going downhill from here&quot; --<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve yet to see that proven wrong since then.<br/>
<br/>
