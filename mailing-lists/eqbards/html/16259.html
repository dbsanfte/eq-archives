<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437396465">I read the &#39;Play Nice&#39; rules last night and was completely flabbergasted.<br/>
The rules are ill-conceived, nearly impossible to enforce, and don&#39;t address<br/>
the real problems most people see on a nightly basis.  The rules do endorse<br/>
the following, farming by 50th level wizards who want to just wander into an<br/>
area and take a rare spawn as you have to share; no one ever calling CS<br/>
(hereafter referred to as Big Brother) as the wording makes it perfectly<br/>
clear their intent, Make up your own compromises because if you bother us<br/>
you WON&#39;T (Sorry Harm) like the decisions we will make; and lastly forget<br/>
role-playing in any sense, we don&#39;t care about it, we won&#39;t support it, and<br/>
if your role-playing causes anyone to lose game satisfaction we will punish<br/>
you.  Notice that while such actions are not allowed to adversely affect the<br/>
enjoyment of others, other acts which are approved and definitely do affect<br/>
one&#39;s game enjoyment are specifically protected such as the right to camp<br/>
guards.  Does anyone who plays this game really not care that the guards of<br/>
their own race&#39;s city are being slaughtered before their eyes?  Does this<br/>
act not reduce anyone&#39;s game enjoyment?<br/>
<br/>
All in all I think the &#39;Pay Nice&#39; rules are worthless at best and<br/>
destructive at worst.  Every instance of EQCSSR could be replaced by Big<br/>
Brother which makes me uncomfortable.  The one line that actually made me<br/>
laugh was one which is almost a direct quote from the old Role Playing game<br/>
Paranoia.<br/>
<br/>
From the Producer&#39;s Letter<br/>
&quot;It is recommended that players make judicious use of the /report command<br/>
when reporting abuse. The proper course of action is to file a /report, then<br/>
file a petition informing the EverQuest Customer Service Staff that a<br/>
/report has been filed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Paranoia as I remember it, forgot to go look it up<br/>
&quot;It is required that all citizens judiciously report unapproved activity.<br/>
The proper procedure is to file a report, then notify The Computer that a<br/>
report has been filed.  Failure to do so will result in termination.  Thank<br/>
you for your service, The Computer is your friend.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A pretty sad attempt on Verant&#39;s part.  From what I could read the majority<br/>
of these rules are designed for high level players only.  I have never seen<br/>
a group or guild monopolize an area at the levels I have played (up to<br/>
28th), but have heard of it happening at higher levels.  Many of the rules<br/>
seem designed to force people to accept overcrowded servers by making them<br/>
share spawns that really cannot support multiple groups.  <br/>

Here are 2 articles that deal with &quot;online worlds&quot; worth reading (well<br/>
skimming at least - first one is ok, but second one is very long)<br/>
<br/>
Basic premise of game mechanics:<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan Baron&#39;s article entitled, &quot;Glory and Shame&quot;, which may be found at<br/>

With Verant deciding they want to go &#39;hands-on&quot; with their &quot;Play Nice&quot;<br/>
policy, these have some merit reading.<br/>
<br/>
Play Nice is doomed to fail.  The number of issues that will come up for<br/>
resolution is so much greater than the resources that Verant has allocated<br/>
to handling them (ie not enough Guides to handle all of the whiners that<br/>
will surface.)  Verant should have stuck to the mechanics of computers that<br/>
gives them power: program code.  If a program lets the user do something,<br/>
some user (or many users) will do that thing. If Verant wanted to stop<br/>
KS&#39;ing, they should have done it in code.  That way they stop each and every<br/>
instance and rules get applied to everyone.<br/>
