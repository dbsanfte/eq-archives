<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003828930">I tested this on newbie rats, and all of you can too!<br/>
I played Denon&#39;s Discord for one pulse on a rat.  Used a normal horn.<br/>
I watched the rat&#39;s health bar drop to the middle point, then drop again and<br/>
it died.<br/>
I played with the Minotaur Horn in the same manner.  One &quot;pulse&quot; then<br/>
watched the rat.  With the Minotaur horn I did far less damage, and didn&#39;t<br/>
even kill the rat.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re really in the mood, just test in on a friend you duel and write<br/>
down the numbers, but I was satisfied just watching how quickly I could kill<br/>
rats with a normal horn over the minotaur variety.<br/>

&gt;that a horn be equipped.  Have you actually seen your brass<br/>
&gt;skill increase while using a Minotaur Horn?<br/>
