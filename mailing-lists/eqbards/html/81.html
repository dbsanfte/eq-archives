If you find yourself in a situation where you must be swimming or<br/>
treading water for a long period of time, your stamina will decrease<br/>
over time just as your hit points do during the heat of battle. Playing<br/>
yourself a little jig helps get you through.<br/>

Of course, not falling off the boat in the first place would be MUCH better....<br/>
