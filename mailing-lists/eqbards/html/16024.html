<div id="ygrps-yiv-226570015"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Well, honestly, regarding the split... I think they did a good job<br/>
&gt;and MAYBE need to move another 200.  In my opinion, its not that<br/>
&gt;the server is crowded - on Solusek Ro now, other than Sunday<br/>
&gt;afternoon, we are consistently in the top third of the least<br/>
&gt;crowded, non PvP servers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really? When do you log on?<br/>
My level 20 group logged on Solusek RO Saturday afternoon to over 2000<br/>
players and couldn&#39;t find anywhere to go (problems I do NOT have with<br/>
singletons. Or lower level characters. Its trying to get more than one<br/>
into a pickup group that is harder) We rescheduled for 1a Saturday<br/>
night/Sunday<br/>
morning. ANd there were 1700 on when we logged on.<br/>
<br/>
I regularly have to scroll down to find Solusek Ro -- as it is usually one<br/>
of the last third of the most crowded servers when I am logging on, usually<br/>
beyond the end of the screen. Sometimes at the bottom of the server<br/>
select screen.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday afternoon *seemed* to be better. Though I had a net 0-loss,0-gain<br/>
after a pickup group in Mistmoore (the first time Anna and I were in a<br/>
full pickup group. Though it was okay. I blame my two deaths more on<br/>
trains and the nature of the dungeon. Want to go back and fight more there!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The problem, in my opinion, is that we have too many high level players.<br/>
&gt;After the &quot;split&quot; I can now log in to a 1200 person server (well within<br/>
&gt;reasonable expectations)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, what time are you logging in? It was at 1400 fairly late SUnday<br/>
night when I was doing a /who all count<br/>
<br/>
We do seem to have a LOT of high levels, though I don&#39;t know much about<br/>
the politics of that.<br/>
<br/>
My characters are 20, 15, 14, and 4...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, the whole server split makes me sad.  I lost a lot of good friends<br/>
&gt;even moving 200 people.  I suppose that&#39;s the way it goes<br/>
&gt;though................<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of people in my guild say the same. However, I didn&#39;t really<br/>
know any of the people they are mourning so it didn&#39;t affect<br/>
me the same as, say, when Mature sold her account. Windsong<br/>
and Mature used to travel together all the time. Mature<br/>
gave Faerain some of the equipment she still wears.<br/>
<br/>
[When I went and trained tracking this weekend? The first<br/>
thing I told my friend, who plays windsong, was &quot;Now I<br/>
can help you and Mature track down that Lion you were looking<br/>
for -- One of my first memories is the two of them running through<br/>
High Hold looking for the lion with the LionHide Backpack]<br/>
