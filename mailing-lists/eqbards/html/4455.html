<div id="ygrps-yiv-493925652">I think I&#39;m going to be sick.  Very sick.  I can&#39;t believe nerfing a trade<br/>
skill actually made some people unbelievably rich because Verant doesn&#39;t<br/>
think thru their actions before they commit them.  Why couldn&#39;t they have<br/>
turned all the old sketches into Aged Pottery sketches or some such thing.<br/>
What a blunder as the economy is further ruined by trying to fix it.  When<br/>
are they going to learn, stabalize, then fix.  Fixing an unstable economy is<br/>
impossible.<br/>

Kitasi the poor, and for once proud to be so<br/>

&gt; I should&#39;ve bought more! I did fill something like 5 backpacks full of<br/>
&gt; 20-stacked pie tin sketches, which I bought for 1s1c each.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ummm, I don&#39;t get it?  How are you rich now?  Did you buy backpacks full<br/>
&gt; of pottery sketches?<br/>

&gt; 	Well, folks, I managed to finally connect to the login/chat server<br/>
&gt; at 12:30 CST today, but at 1:00 CST, I zoned and was knocked off. Now I<br/>
&gt; can not reconnect and that was 20 minutes ago. However, the old pottery<br/>
&gt; book I had did not show any new recipes. I was unable to make the small<br/>
&gt; clay diety work (thought it might be some kind of mana totem to sell to<br/>
&gt; players) as well.<br/>
&gt; 	The pie tins are hosed, over 1pp each, as are cake rounds and most<br/>
&gt; ever other sketch. Fortunately, I did save quite a few packs full of<br/>
&gt; sketches and they did sell for a VERY handsome profit, so if you managed<br/>
&gt; to do this last night, you should be rewarded well for this hosing, at<br/>
&gt; least in the short term.<br/>
&gt; 	As soon as I am up and running, I will be sure to look around<br/>
&gt; Freeport some more for new books, although the old one was a gift so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know where it came from to start with. If I see anything<br/>
&gt; interesting, I will post a SPOILER message here and at other EQ forums as<br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
