<div id="ygrps-yiv-525463665"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Careful not to confuse a monster swarm with area effect bugs.  I use DDD<br/>
&gt;all the time, even in indoor zones.  (Though I have had trouble in<br/>
&gt;Runnyeye).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some guildmates and I held the King&#39;s room in Runnyeye for a couple of<br/>
nights, and I used CoD/DDD quite a bit and never had a problem.  Although it<br/>
may have been that nothing was directly above me (as the dungeon is laid<br/>
out)<br/>
