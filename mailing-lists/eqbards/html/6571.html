<div id="ygrps-yiv-329798596">I have managed to PS three mobs (CT gators) at once (out of necessity not <br/>
planing).  I would pull them out of the general melee and then cycle from <br/>
one to the next once I had them all lined up.  That battle cemented my <br/>
belief that a warrior is a MUST in every party.  The warrior in the group <br/>
tanked four of these things in row, it was an awesome sight :)<br/>

&gt;Pixie strike is a great song.  I almost never used it when I first got it,<br/>
&gt;but I&#39;m really enjoying it now.<br/>
&gt;My question is this, how on earth can you effectively use it on two mobs in<br/>
&gt;the confusion of melee?  I have enough trouble clicking on the one creature<br/>
&gt;that my party isn&#39;t fighting, let alone trying to select back and forth<br/>
&gt;between two.  It would be really nice if we could dynamically assign hot<br/>
&gt;keys to monsters, then just quickly hit the keys to toggle back and forth.<br/>
&gt;Ah well, wishful thinking.<br/>
