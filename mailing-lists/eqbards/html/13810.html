<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106922026">They were stunning, but we were in Najena&#39;s room and it was crowded enough<br/>
that quite a few were resisting.  Those that resisted were nearly all the<br/>
time targeted on me unfortunately.  I wish we had a real tank anywhere near<br/>
that level.  The best we have is an 18th level monk and a 19the level<br/>
ranger. Not enough I think to avoid casualties.<br/>

I think that in the situation you mentioned last night that your level may<br/>
have played a bigger factor in you taking most of the damage than bard hate<br/>
(assuming you were the lowest level player). I have seen numerous situations<br/>
where mobs picked on the lowest level character in the group, regardless of<br/>
what the others characters are doing to it.  Doesn&#39;t happen all the time but<br/>
it does happen.  In the situation last night, bard hate just made the matter<br/>
worse.  <br/>
<br/>
Three of the classes you were with can Stun mobs.  John Kim posted the other<br/>
day of the importance of the Stun spell in reducing mob damage to the party.<br/>
Were they Stunning frequently? If not then that may also help explain why<br/>
you bore the brunt of the damage.<br/>
<br/>
BTW adding a real tank to the party composition you listed should be enough<br/>
for you to get the obsidian shard in Sol A which you posted earlier you<br/>
wanted.<br/>

&gt; I<br/>
&gt; still took almost 50% of the damage.  The wizard was the only one able to<br/>
&gt; get mobs of me and with her low hp&#39;s can hardly afford to do so.  Tanking<br/>
&gt; with a 26th lvl troll shaman was kinda cool, especially since the dwarf<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; the tallest among us, but painful.  Fortunately the cleric was easily up<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the healing task and even joked about how bards made his job too easy,<br/>
&gt; generally only one hp bar to watch.<br/>
