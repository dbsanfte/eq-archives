<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369317568">perhaps it is based on your level compared to the mob you are chaining.  i<br/>
know if i am chaining frogs in lower guk, they do not stop at 50% health.<br/>
actually come to think of it as i am typing this, what mobs besides ones far<br/>
lower than your level will even think about running at 50%?  they don&#39;t,<br/>
they stay and fight.  so that is why if i am fearing and chaining, no matter<br/>
what it is it will stop moving at 50% health, because i am forcing them to<br/>
run away.  on the other hand, mobs close to me in level (that i am not<br/>
fearing) i do not notice this.  it&#39;s because they are not running until they<br/>
are around 5-10% health anyway, and as soon as i chain them they stop at<br/>
this point.<br/>

&gt; &gt; this is not what i notice.  chain will only stop a mob once <br/>
&gt; it is very low<br/>
&gt; &gt; on hp, approximately under 5 or 10% health.  when i am <br/>
&gt; fearing AND chaining,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the mob will stop at 50% health.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was stopping gnolls in Blackburrow just fine at 50%<br/>
&gt; health.  One in particular I stopped, the poor newbie fighting<br/>
&gt; it didn&#39;t understand what had happened and continued to<br/>
&gt; &quot;chase&quot; it down the ramp.  I held it there for about a half<br/>
&gt; minute, when it healed to above 50% and slowly wandered off.<br/>
&gt; So maybe there is more to it. </span></blockquote></div>
