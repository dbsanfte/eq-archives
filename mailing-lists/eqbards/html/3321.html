<b>Subject:</b> Weapons at level 9 and up <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-246077050">I have just reached Level 9, and am currently considering going<br/>
beyond the safety of East Commonlands. (Prexus Server)<br/>
<br/>
I am still using my trusty Scimitar, and I have tried a Mino Axe, but<br/>
have found that while the large damage is nice, it is kinda slow.<br/>
<br/>
I have enough money to get a Combine Scimitar, but seeing as it is<br/>
just a magic upgrade (and one speed) to the Scimitar, I have held<br/>
off.  I have seen the Swashbuckler with his 200pp+ weapons, and I&#39;m<br/>
trying to decide if it is worth saving money for those Well-Balanced<br/>
weapons or a Demon&#39;s Claw / Dragoon&#39;s Dirk if I come across them.<br/>
<br/>
How resaleable are the well balanced weapons?<br/>
<br/>
And where should I hang around to hear auctions on Dragoon&#39;s Dirk? <br/>
Greater Faydark near Crushbone?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys.<br/>
<br/>
