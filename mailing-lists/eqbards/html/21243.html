<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567433685">ummm....the dissappearing text thing is NOT<br/>
a bard only thing.<br/>

I have seen it with my ranger, monk and cleric.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; On another note to a VERY long post, the but with the disapeparing text<br/>
&gt; buffer (which is one I want fixed!!) are you guys getting it a lot? I am<br/>
&gt; going to post it&#39;s own thread, but we are seeing it mostly with bards...<br/>
&gt; /sigh<br/>
