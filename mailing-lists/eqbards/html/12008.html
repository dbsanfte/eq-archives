<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124099244">It would be nice if you could highlight the changes somehow.  Not certain if<br/>
boldface or italics will work with Onelist so maybe just putting &quot;NEW&quot; prior<br/>
to the new stuff can help us old-timers filter out the stuff we&#39;ve read<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
Also, whats the story behind the small brass trumpet?  I&#39;ve been out of the<br/>
net a lot over the past month so that ones new to me.  What mob drops it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; I know a lot of you don&#39;t bother to read the FAQ, but if I could encourage<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you all to go over it at least once.  I have a lot of information on there<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that will help with some frequently asked questions (thus the title....), <br/>
&gt; as well as a collation of the magical instruments in EQ.  I would<br/>
&gt; sincerely <br/>
&gt; appreciate you higher-levels going over that list with a fine-toothed comb<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for me and correcting my booboos.<br/>
