  Why are we so hung up on invis songs?  We don&#39;t need an invis<br/>
  versus undead song.  Please don&#39;t suggest that to them, it&#39;s<br/>
  a waste of a valuable song slot.  When you fight in Lguk or<br/>
  Kith, you are in a group (even at L50 you cannot solo in those<br/>
  areas) anyway so you should have someone who can invis versus<br/>
  undead.  <br/>
<br/>
  I never play clouding when going to live tower, just because it&#39;s<br/>
  too hard to keep 5 other people close enough for invis, I just <br/>
  let the invis casters get to work.  I would do the same with<br/>
  an Invis to Undead song as well... hardly ever use it.<br/>
<br/>
  Our invis song is primarily for self use or stationary party<br/>
  protection from trains.  I don&#39;t mind if Clouding gets an undead<br/>
  invis component, but do not suggest another song be Invis V Undead.<br/>
<br/>
  We need more party related songs that make people want us in groups.<br/>
  More now than ever, bards need to demand stronger definition via<br/>
  their songs.  Right now we are a watered down: warrior, cleric, <br/>
  enchanter, shaman, druid.  That worked when I was L20 and that<br/>
  versatility was welcome.  Now every group has a warrior, has a<br/>
  cleric, has an enchanter, has a shaman.  They don&#39;t need bards<br/>
  anymore.  We&#39;ve got nothing to offer except superior resistances<br/>
  and even then that is becoming overlooked.  Someone can always<br/>
  do something better than us.  I understand the &#39;Master of None&#39;<br/>
  part of our creation, but I&#39;m no good being a &#39;Jack of all Trades&#39;<br/>
  if no group wants me for inferior abilities.  Sure we can get the<br/>
  job done, but someone else has a better, longer lasting, more<br/>
  powerful, less resistant version of it out there.  In a pickup<br/>
  group, yeah I get to diversify some songs, in well structured<br/>
  groups, bards simply are not required. (planes,dragons,events)<br/>
<br/>
  We are the supposed to be the strongest driving force behind<br/>
  a PC party and groups should be looking for bards with strong<br/>
  abilities and not avg-joe L32 manapump.  Everyone wants a cleric<br/>
  because they heal extremely well.  Everyone welcomes an enchanter<br/>
  due to the fact the make fighting much easier.  At higher levels<br/>
  what does the bard really have to offer?  VoV, Nivs, Clarit?  They<br/>
  should just reduce our song memslots to three icons, because I for<br/>
  one don&#39;t use more than that.  I used to.  All the time.  Just <br/>
  no need anymore, I outgrew all those things.<br/>
