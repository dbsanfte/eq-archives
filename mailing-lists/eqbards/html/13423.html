<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726017854">Wow I thought it was only me. I baught 2 gnoll hid lariats a few days ago<br/>
for kick and the stun proc. I took my enchanter friend to Fp arena  to show<br/>
him my neat somewhat useless toys. I told him &quot; you should see how much I<br/>
stun wielding 2 of these, it funny&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He stood there I sang Berserkers. I got him down to 2 bubbles no proces I<br/>
healed him up and did this  about 5 times.. and got ONE proc the entire<br/>
time.. I was thinking it was just an arena/duel thing. I did not get to test<br/>
it on a mob though for I went on a wonderfull nagga raid shortly. We<br/>
slaughtere him. (yes he is buffed more now) the previous group tried for 5<br/>
hours and mass people died till they gave nagga up to the more experienced<br/>
raids..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The one thing we did on nagga since he removes buffs.. we made a &quot;useless<br/>
buff line&quot;  we would buff everyone with all the useless enchantments THEN<br/>
last we would do the resist hp buffs etc... it worked great.. naga would<br/>
remobe the useless buffs first. :)<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m not too concerned yet, but did anyone else playing last night notice a<br/>
&gt;staggering drop in the number of procs that their weapons are firing?  I<br/>

&gt;the number of times it fired over the course of about 4 hours of play was<br/>
&gt;either 2 or 3 - that&#39;s a very serious drop, perhaps an order of magnitude.<br/>
&gt;The last hour or so I loaded up all of my DEX equipment and played Chant of<br/>
&gt;Battle and had a DEX of 186 and didn&#39;t proc once.  After killing Bouncers I<br/>
&gt;ran over to Cazic-Thule and beat on some lizzies and gators for testing<br/>
&gt;purposes (also 186 DEX) and got not a single proc while there (around 20<br/>
&gt;solo kills).<br/>
