     Finally, after a loooong back-and-forth battle, the difference was <br/>
     made when he put on his Savant&#39;s Cap.  That little bit of extra Wisdom <br/>
     helpped make his PGT a proc&#39;ing machine.  <br/>
     &lt;unsnip&gt;<br/>
     <br/>
     I could have sworn that DEX was the stat that helped a proc&#39;ing <br/>
     weapon.  Is it wisdom or dex????  (If it&#39;s wisdom then I&#39;ll never <br/>
     bother with proc&#39;s, my wisdom is very low and all my items are <br/>
     targeted at adding to str, agl, dex, and cha.  I&#39;d need to grow a <br/>
     couple of extra arms to wear the wisdom stuff....  :P  )<br/>
