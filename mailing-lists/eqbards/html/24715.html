<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260411787">I don&#39;t believe this is true.  If someone else has the time and energy to<br/>
back up my statement... :)  Heh..at work, and not able to research this, but<br/>
I do remember one of &quot;Them&quot; saying that pets take NO exp when in a group.<br/>

The thing is, if you charm a mob and it does too much damage, it will take a<br/>
large amount of exp from the group.  No matter how many people there are in<br/>
the group.<br/>

  Enchanter charm can&#39;t be refreshed, unless it has been changed recently.<br/>
At<br/>
  higher levels, mobs do WAY more damage than PC&#39;s.  A bard could easily<br/>
  outdamage a monk or rogue with refreshable charm.  Mana would not be a<br/>
real<br/>
  issue, just sit down and med between battles.  With non refreshable charm,<br/>
  I&#39;m convinced if Verant saw a good charming bard in action, they would<br/>
nerf<br/>
  it.  To eliminate the only real downside to charm, would be too much.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ll disagree on this, no biggie :)  A lot of people don&#39;t agree with me<br/>
on<br/>
  how powerful charm is.  There won&#39;t be any changing my mind now though,<br/>
  since I can&#39;t use it anymore :(   You know if you charm a spectral curate<br/>
in<br/>
  KC, and you have people low on health, he&#39;ll probably heal them?  Try it<br/>
  some time, will freak out your cleric...<br/>
