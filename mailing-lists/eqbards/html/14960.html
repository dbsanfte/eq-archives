<div id="ygrps-yiv-727220744">You need to be a little careful here.  At level 14, &quot;fight the same mobs&quot;<br/>
means not just &quot;fight dervs&quot; or &quot;fight orcs&quot; because they will come in a<br/>
wide variety of levels.  What he means is fight mobs of the same type and<br/>
same &quot;con&quot; level - and preferably high blues or white/black (even cons).<br/>
This will give you more standard results.  You can group and be fighting<br/>
reds - which is where your skill vs mob level difference will produce those<br/>
misses.  It&#39;s how I can walk up to Aviak Rooks and whack em and then stand<br/>
there and let them flail away at me.  Because of the level difference, they<br/>
will have lots and lots of misses compared to when I was closer to their<br/>
level and they could easily tear me apart.  That could be why you are seeing<br/>
lots of misses - you get low damage and misses when you fight reds.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you are going to test, make sure you fight the same type and same<br/>
level mob for you testing.  Also your skills in weapon types should be the<br/>
same level.  A maxed skill in 1HS will do better than a low skill in 1HB.<br/>
To be fair make sure your skills are comparable.<br/>
<br/>
Or, just get an Ashenwood Short Spear and Dragoon Dirk until you can get a<br/>
Staff of Writhing and Obsidian Shard &lt;g&gt;  And some day, you will be 2YK<br/>
compliant too! &lt;trust me&gt;<br/>

p.s. John, thanks! - hehe I been working hard and getting lots of help from<br/>
my guild sibs - nice to have a 50 pulling single specs in an endless stream.<br/>
And a few trips to the bats & bugs.  Endless hours with Bouncers. Cyndreela,<br/>
Cyndreela, how many different ways can we kill you?  OMG We have been here<br/>
for 6 hours straight!!! Spectres, spectres, spectres.  I cried when they<br/>
started turning green - that means I still gotta kill em but dont get xp.<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. last night on our run to clear fire giants, my first group was me, 2<br/>
druids and 2 rogues.  I played berserker, they have Kedge and dragon weps<br/>
and haste sash.  We were consistently stealling the xp kills (doing the most<br/>
damage) off the bugs from the other groups who had lev 50 monks.  Finally,<br/>
they split us up, knowing not even 2 druids could keep 2 rogues alive on<br/>
FG&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi there, I&#39;m Hire. 14th level bard on Vallon ZEK! I&#39;m nearing<br/>
&gt; &gt; the magical L17 and dual wield, and I&#39;m wondering what are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; most effective weapon? I was thinking of combine longswords<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Get a logfile parser.  Fight the same mobs for a long time<br/>
&gt; (i.e. camp a spot).  Use one weapon half the time, use the<br/>
&gt; other weapon half the time.  Parse your logfile and figure out<br/>
&gt; which one you do better with. </span></blockquote></div>
