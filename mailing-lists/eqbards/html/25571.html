rough.  I spent several levels (11 up to 16) in Unrest, m&#39;self, but that&#39;s <br/>
certainly NOT for the weak of heart ;)  Lots of trains.<br/>

As for the quiet, I imagine everyone&#39;s girding for the SoL release.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, has anyone noticed the SoL skill list for Bards?  Lots of nice things, <br/>
but when do those skills kick in???<br/>
