&gt; In testing the song (on yourself) you can see that it drop MR for 2 pulses.<br/>
&gt; So, unless you play it more or less constantly, and make it stick (ie mobs<br/>
&gt; do not resist), I&#39;d say you are not gonna be successful.  I&#39;d think that<br/>

as good as singing Bellow once every three songs, if you&#39;re<br/>
going to be using it I&#39;d think the extra damage would be an<br/>
important, if not the primary, factor.<br/>

&gt; Casters&#39; spells take 3 to 5 seconds to cast and with lag and what have you -<br/>
&gt; you need to keep pulsing your song.<br/>

their casts to your song.  Besides, I get a kick out of the<br/>
