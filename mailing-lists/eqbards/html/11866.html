Everquest, level = status, with no other factors being visible<br/>
to an observer.  I still kinda like the idea of making stats<br/>
like party deaths vs. mob deaths, &quot;incidental&quot; deaths (e.g.<br/>
mob you are kiting/running from kills someone) vs. mob deaths,<br/>
etc, record and make these stats visible to all.  It would<br/>
promote altruism and cooperation, rather than single-minded<br/>
self-serving power-leveling.<br/>
