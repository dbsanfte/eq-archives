&gt; Last night I was checking prices on plate mail, and<br/>
&gt; decided to mem up the charisma song just to see if it made<br/>
&gt; even a 1cp difference in prices. I used my mino horn and<br/>
&gt; targeted the indifferent shopkeeper. Low and behold, he<br/>
&gt; con&#39;d amiable after the song took affect. Not only did he<br/>
&gt; con amiable, but so did every other shopkeeper in east<br/>
&gt; Freeport.The price of the chest plate remained at 794pp<br/>
&gt; though with my 90 charisma. (I think prices can only go so<br/>
&gt; low).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, I&#39;ve pretty much verified this.  I dropped by the gypsies<br/>
again and at 110, 115, and 120 charisma, their price for a<br/>
combine longsword was always 52.5pp.  The selling price was<br/>
47.5pp, so that establishes (for gypisies and this item at<br/>
least) a base price of 50pp and +/- 5% being the best you can<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
The shady swashbuckler is still giving me better prices as I<br/>
increase my charisma though.  223pp at 110, 220pp at 115.  I<br/>
just got back to Freeport last night and need to test it at<br/>
120.  So there&#39;s definitely some faction/race/diety component<br/>
to all this.  The charisma song may be worthwhile in this<br/>
regard (especially since half those damn stuck-up Erudite<br/>
merchants won&#39;t sell to me).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thru Neriak for a half hour. On the other hand (if you<br/>
&gt; dont have invis yet), use it on a Dark Elf guard and run<br/>
&gt; thru Nektulos on your way to Lavastorm without them<br/>
&gt; attacking you. Thats just an example. I&#39;m sure there are<br/>
&gt; many other uses yet to be discovered. Say you die inside<br/>
&gt; the house of Unrest and you need to get your corpse.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps you can target a skel or whatever, use the song on<br/>
&gt; it and then the entire UnrestInhabitants faction will be<br/>
&gt; amiable to you for a few minutes? Enough time to /corpse<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps that&#39;s the intended use of the song?  Not getting<br/>
better prices at merchants as previously thought?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your corpse to safety and wont have to worry about getting<br/>
&gt; someone to cast invis + invis vs undead on you. Just an<br/>
&gt; idea, but I havent actually tested these things yet. I<br/>
&gt; suggest you all experiment with this a bit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just a safety question - does the NPC ever attack you if the<br/>
song somehow fails?  I get nervous targeting songs at NPCs<br/>
that are red to me.  :-)<br/>
