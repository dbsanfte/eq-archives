&gt; Najena was tougher. I was going to fear/chain her, but<br/>
&gt; it didn&#39;t work too well. I ended up meleeing her,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; All said and done, I nearly died. I was somewhere<br/>
&gt; around 1 bubble after all this fun, and not willing to<br/>
&gt; chance it again. (Damn froglok ghoul almost killed me<br/>
&gt; on the way out.) Any advice on how to do this better<br/>
&gt; next time?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Damn you.  :)  My full party got killed by Najena and her<br/>
cronies at L25-35.  We were just exploring and didn&#39;t even<br/>
know it was her room, though we suspected it.  We didn&#39;t have<br/>
a key so weren&#39;t planning on fighting, when the entire room<br/>
emptied out onto us.  Najena chain-cast AE spells and lagged<br/>
all of us to death.  I got to switch songs twice during the<br/>
entire 30 second or so incident.  That was the day I turned<br/>
particle density off.<br/>
<br/>
Well done.<br/>
