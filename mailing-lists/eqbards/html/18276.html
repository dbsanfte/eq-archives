&gt; Heh, I just spoke to a friend that also had to fight 4 black<br/>
&gt; reavers before<br/>
&gt; getting to the lord. I&#39;m not sure about our fight, but it&#39;s possible that<br/>
&gt; either the number of reavers you have to fight can vary. OR, it<br/>
&gt; is a fixed 4<br/>
&gt; reavers, and we got lucky and happened upon the 3rd incarnation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not the best at remembering specific names (especially when they are<br/>
similar), but it could be that there are say 4 reavers, each with a<br/>
different Lord spawn at the end.  1 Reaver the lord spawns when the first<br/>
reaver dies, another reaver a different lord spawns after the 4th reaver<br/>
dies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Or, the number of reincarnates is always the same depending on the reaver<br/>
but each reaver has a different number of reincarnates before the final<br/>
Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of guesses.<br/>
