<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576663191">Bards make magic with music.  They can make music with song and their<br/>
instruments can make (some) songs better.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the songs and if they are string, percussion, wind or brass, they<br/>
will be enhanced (have more power) when you sing them and have the<br/>
appropriate instrument equipped.<br/>
<br/>
Some instruments give more power than others (in the same class: wind,<br/>
string, etc.)  The instruments bought in stores (from merchants) are the<br/>
base line.  See this for a chart of the instruments:  <br/>

Bards at your level can learn the &quot;all instrument attack&quot; -- it&#39;s actually a<br/>
cantana-tada-tina(tm) ;)  You can play a series of songs and do more damage<br/>
to mobs than if you were to use your weapons.  You can learn to swap<br/>
instruments for maximum effect.  For example:  play Chords of Dissonace with<br/>
lute; Heal song with lute; swap lute for brass horn and play Denon&#39;s<br/>
Dischord. Rinse, repeat.  Setting up a hot key pallette with your melee 2<br/>
slot and 2 inventory slots helps with the swapping.  And once you get<br/>
comfortable, you can just leave the swapped out instrument on your mouse<br/>
cursor.  Here is a link to a more complete explanation:<br/>

Learnin to use Area Effect songs early in your career is a big plus.  I was<br/>
scared from too many times singing chords to Corporal Lancot and just<br/>
avoided these good songs for way too long.  Yes, <br/>

Interesting - I never have used my instruments during a fight. I&#39;m currently<br/>
level 21 - actually now that I think about it, I&#39;m level 20, I died<br/>
yesterday :(. Is just using my weapons in battle normal for my level? Should<br/>
I expect to be using my instruments a lot more often when I hit a certain<br/>
level?<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord uses Brass instruments and I<br/>
haven&#39;t used the song yet. Is it a useful song? I don&#39;t really like to sing<br/>
AE songs in battle since it causes problems right quick - although I do like<br/>
Largos as it has a pretty small radius. Are all of our good songs going to<br/>
be AE? Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord would be awesome if I could sing it<br/>
without fear that I&#39;m going to pull everything in the zone...</div>
