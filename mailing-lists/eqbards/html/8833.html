<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-684616014">This is the kind of thing you would expect Verant to discover before they<br/>
implemented the quests.  I fail to see how lack of paying attention to<br/>
detail on their part can be considered an exploit.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Actually, as I understand it, the reason that Genni disappeared was that<br/>
&gt; she was shut down due to<br/>
&gt; an exploit.  You could buy fire opals from her for 55 plat, then turn<br/>
&gt; around and sell them to a<br/>
&gt; vendor for a profit!  So GMs shut them down.<br/>
