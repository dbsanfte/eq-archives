<div id="ygrps-yiv-371530210">Greetings to one and all!<br/>
Wanted to ask some opinions, express some views, and generally provoke <br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
Just a sliver under level 40 now!  Yay!  I am camped in Lower Guk right now <br/>
and have had fun there for about 8 hours.  I was in the Bedroom group and <br/>
80-85% of the mobs give exp (level 39 as of now remember).  I receive a tell <br/>
to go to the Supply room (supplier?) and loot a lovely guise!  I don&#39;t know <br/>
the zone, and requested a guide from the group telling me.  I was chatting <br/>
with them in /tell so I had a raport...they came to fetch me.  Went there to <br/>
loot...and it decayed!!  Then the group leader accidentally hits disband.  <br/>
Oh oh.  Well friendly Supply group offers to safely return me, but i saw on <br/>
the way that the halls were fairly clear, and i sent a /tell to group leader <br/>
that I would be training back 2 froggies.  Well, I run back and acquire 2 <br/>
Greater Ice Bone skeletons that had spawned, plus a froggie warrior (Ton <br/>
Warrior?).  And then I got lost!  I didn&#39;t know that the halls form a circle <br/>
and I ended up in want they called a spider room with the 2 GIBS and <br/>
froggie.  I charmed one GIBS and he engages other 2. I just hugged the wall <br/>
and kept charming them in turn to save my stupid bard but and sending tells <br/>
to group leader about where I am and what I am doing.  Group cleric arrives <br/>
and heals me ( had 1.5 bubbles of health left) and group leader is behind <br/>
and regroups me.  They sit back and wait until the mobs are ready to attack <br/>
me again, then i hit lullaby, and we finish them off as rest of group <br/>
gathers for the kill.  Sorry it took so long to say, but our charm song is <br/>
surely a life saver....lost, bumbling bards take note!!<br/>
<br/>
I am bound in Rivervale now.  I play EQ during peak hours mostly now because <br/>
of new work schedule.  Why bind in Rivervale?  Because when the high level <br/>
zones are camped, and lists are longer than I can stay logged on, I just <br/>
form a Kithicor group.  Now Kithicor is pretty crap as I have said before, <br/>
but some exp is better than no exp.  And there is none of the /shout /ooc <br/>
that i find distracting (people like to argue camps, lists etc via /shout <br/>
and /ooc instead of using /tell).<br/>
                             quotes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;p.s.s. in order to make some room in my bank, I destroyed a no drop wep I<br/>
&gt;looted in Kithikor.  They really missed the mark on that zone.  Right idea <br/>
&gt;-<br/>
&gt;poor execution. Danger zone -- where the compensation (neither loot nor xp)<br/>
&gt;simply does not match the risk and now it&#39;s virtually ignored.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>                             quotes<br/>
<br/>
And since Kith is wacked it really is ignored!  I don&#39;t love it, but it is <br/>
surprisingly easy to get a group going there.  I find that with just one or <br/>
two other people, we can do ok.  What I don&#39;t like is that we take so much <br/>
damage during fights that we HAVE to med/heal up some and waste time that <br/>
precious half day when the undead spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that was most of the rambling.  Now for my big question.  Belonging to a <br/>
small guild, I am curious if I will be able to venture into <br/>
Hate/Fear/Dragons.  I have heard the rumors on Cazic Thule server boards <br/>
(and I see it here a bit too) that some powerful guilds basically control <br/>
these areas.  Does my little guild of say 15 people with 8 or so in the <br/>
35-42 range have any hope of someday moving into these areas to hunt?  I <br/>
have been talking with the guild leader and based on what we see/feel, we <br/>
will have to gather other small guilds together for joint efforts.  That is <br/>
ok with us, but what if a powerful guild basically camps Hate or Fear or <br/>
dragons non-stop?  Some guilds are big and powerful enough to have &quot;shifts&quot; <br/>
and will be able to &quot;own&quot; zones.  If the small guilds try to go there, will <br/>
we be squashed?   What say the bards on this topic?  Bards on my server are <br/>
great!  I have seen some arguments between groups/guilds get moderated <br/>
because the bards in each group/guild defused things and cooled the <br/>
hot-heads.  Also the personality of bards is easy for us to get along with <br/>
as a class.  So I brought this matter here for discussion instead of a <br/>
message vault.<br/>

P.S.  I really hope this does not cause any flammage.  Hoping for <br/>
constructive advice!!<br/>
