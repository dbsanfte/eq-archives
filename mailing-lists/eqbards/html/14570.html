<div id="ygrps-yiv-315304515">I can&#39;t answer your question about bulk purchases but I do know a lot of the<br/>
the fishes you kill in Kedge drop fish scales so it shouldn&#39;t be hard for<br/>
rangers/druids to replenish their supplies while they are down there.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been planning an outing on ICQ.  The question is; short of fishing;<br/>
&gt; where can Fish Scales be purchased in bulk?<br/>
