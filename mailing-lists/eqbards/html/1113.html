<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579745317">Hi fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if any of you got any good suggestions for books<br/>
about Bards that would be Everquest like? And some books about<br/>
Everquest in general too would be fun to read. I never read a Fantasy<br/>
book or played a fantasy game (but tons of sci-fi), so I&#39;m new with this<br/>
<br/>
genre I would like to start with light stuff not too complicated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
The invisible Bard of the E&#39;ci dimension.</div>
