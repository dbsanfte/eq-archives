&gt;From an old rogue, sneak is a skill that will allow u to walk very quietly<br/>
&gt;by violent creatures.  U know if sneak is working if u start walking half <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;your walk speed.  The sneak skill at high lvl like in the 80&#39;s or higher<br/>
&gt;will allow u to sneak by many creatures of yellows and down.  I would not<br/>
&gt;try it against a red though.  The chances of not being seen is slim.  The<br/>
&gt;sneak skill is very useful for retrieving your dead body and Pick pocketing<br/>
&gt;but since we do not have it then it is mostly good for retrieving your <br/>
&gt;body.<br/>
&gt;With our speed song we can just run by all creatures.  Who need to sneak?  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;hoped this help.<br/>

&gt;Hail fellow Bards!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would be really glad if anyone could explain me the use of the sneak<br/>
&gt;skill. I haven&#39;t seen one person in the game who could explain me how it<br/>
&gt;works<br/>
&gt;and what it really does. It is said that monsters can&#39;t hear you when your<br/>
&gt;sneaking, but I really doubt that this is very usefull. I don&#39;t know either<br/>
&gt;how to use it correctly. Do you have to be in walk mode to start sneaking?<br/>
&gt;Sometimes I just can&#39;t hit the sneak button for hours, i don&#39;t know why.<br/>
&gt;I would really appreciate every kind of help...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, You get it at 17...by the time you might have it maxed I figure you <br/>
might as well use Shari&#39;s Sonorous Clouding (I think it&#39;s Shari&#39;s?), which <br/>
you get shortly after. Unless of course the mobs you are passing can see <br/>
invisible. I found that Sonorous Clouding is one of the coolest methods of <br/>
retrieving your own corpse as well as party members&#39; corpses because, as <br/>
most of us know, you become visible when looting. On the very next tick of <br/>
the song you become invisible again. We used this to get a friend&#39;s corpse <br/>
who was pulling mobs for us from deep within the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule. <br/>
He got lost in the maze (he went through the first door to the right in the <br/>
courtyard) and was gangbanged by sentinels and defenders. He was worried he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get all of his gear back, but we laid those fears to rest in short <br/>
order. It is also great for resting your party in a hostile area.<br/>
