<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-655336106">As I mentioned in that thread, you can&#39;t expect to win everything in one battle.  We recieved a great many concessions yesterday, and as such, instead of getting down about it, I feel much more optimistic about future enhancements.<br/>
<br/>
Things like Lullaby and Chains won&#39;t be fixed until someone at VI begins playing a bard as their primary character.  That, therefore, is something that I am willing to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; for now.  The fact that Abashi answered the whoe demmed list also gives me great optimism.  Why?  Because I think Abashi now feels great empathy for bards?  Heck no!  Read between the lines of his own post. Someone &quot;handed&quot; him the list that came from the Concert Hall?  He has now recognized that the Concert Hall is the main hub for the bardic community.<br/>
<br/>
The list of issues has been posted and re-posted on the EQ boards, and summarily ignored by Gordo lo these many months (except for the one time where he just picked a few weenie items out and posted on them).  Also, the Concert Hall has been KNOWN and MENTIONED in many posts as the main bardic gathering place, yet he has posted that any place like that doesn&#39;t &quot;truly&quot; represent a given community.  Now we have an about-face, and that tells me that someone above GW&#39;s head got wind of bards being ignored, watched it go on for a while, then came down on him.  How else would you explain the instrument skill caps getting raised so quickly?  That&#39;s a MAJOR balancing issue for this class, yet he tossed out the &quot;it will be in the next patch&quot; phrase as if it happened everyday.<br/>
<br/>
Patience my friends... patience.<br/>

&gt;apparently many of our songs are &quot;working as intended&quot; or &quot;may need to be<br/>
&gt;re-evaluated at some point&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;this may be the end for me.<br/>
