<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138776401">lol.  I always hit forage when it comes up so I never thought about sitting<br/>
somewhere for more than a couple of minutes without hitting a button.  It<br/>
would never happen anyhow, too many casters go away after blowing all their<br/>
mana while soloing and med for 15+ minutes while doing something else.<br/>

I agree with you Kit. It&#39;s bad.<br/>
<br/>
Us bards have to press buttons every 5 secs to change songs and now we&#39;ll <br/>
have to continue to be chained to our desks during downtime.<br/>
<br/>
Auto-logoff would be really bad, btw. Have you ever been in a room that has <br/>
a motion sensor light? If you sit at your desk and you&#39;re reading, you have <br/>
to wave your hand in the air every 15 min or end up in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
Auto-logoff is the same thing. You may be sitting reading stuff on your <br/>
screen, not necessarily pushing any buttons for 10 mins, but get booted off <br/>
just because the server thinks you&#39;re inactive. You&#39;d have to make sure you <br/>
push a button every 10 mins or be booted. After you&#39;re booted, you&#39;d lose <br/>
all of your no-rent items as well as any illusions you had up. I don&#39;t <br/>
think Verant would even implement such a bad thing. Uhh, maybe not. Don&#39;t <br/>
post the auto-logoff thing on the web Kit. Please! :-)<br/>

&gt;probably some bard was sitting AFK on the planes and now we all have to be<br/>
&gt;nerfed because someone abused the situation.  Heaven forbid they should<br/>
&gt;handle this by putting in an auto logoff when someone is inactive for more<br/>

&gt;I&#39;d have to agree with Lago on Verant&#39;s reasoning that this is to keep us<br/>
&gt;from going AFK indefinitely.<br/>

&gt; &gt;All this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>
