<br/>
My guild recently allied with 2 others to have a sizeable raiding force, and<br/>
have come up with a point-based system that seems to work pretty well (it&#39;s<br/>
new so there may be kinks)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone starts out at 20pts.  This is the base minimum you can have, and<br/>
therefore roll to  (ie: /random 1 20)<br/>
For your first raid, you get 30 points (this is to help folks who may not<br/>
belong to any of the 3 guilds, yet are along to help)<br/>
If you stay for a whole raid, you get 30 points (shorter raids get smaller<br/>
points)<br/>
If you stay for 2 hours to about halfway, you get half points<br/>
If you pass on a roll for your class (that isn&#39;t junk) you get an extra 5 or<br/>
10 (can&#39;t remember which) points per pass (this helps folks who are only<br/>
after one or two items)<br/>
Winning something knocks off 10 points (although I would like to see it<br/>
dropped to base 20), and you are not allowed to roll again until everyone in<br/>
that class has won something (unless it&#39;s an uber item).<br/>
<br/>
One of the main reasons for this was fairness.  We wanted to be able to<br/>
reward folks for coming on raids they wouldn&#39;t normally go on (Clerics in<br/>
Fear) without over-penalizing folks who can&#39;t make it due to RL.  We also<br/>
wanted to set up a heirarchy so that folks who only needed a few items would<br/>
have a better shot, without using level as a point-modifier (therefore<br/>
encouraging p-leveling just so you can be the highest level and get a better<br/>
chance at something).  This gives EVERYONE a shot at an item, the more<br/>
you&#39;ve won, the less of a shot youhave.  The more you&#39;ve gone on and the<br/>
more loot you&#39;ve passed on, the better a shot you have.<br/>
<br/>
We have also broken loot into 3 gropups:<br/>
trash (ie: Imbrued bracers)<br/>
Common (legs, arms, bps, etc)<br/>
rares (rare and god drops)<br/>
Trash loses no points for being looted, and gains no points for passing<br/>
(trash is determined by a class beforehand)<br/>
The rares and god drops will most likely be NBG or straight /random if more<br/>
than 1 is deemed in need<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; A couple of things:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My guild&#39;s loot is distributed by the raid leader.  Plain and simple.  You<br/>
&gt; just need to trust your raid leaders to be fair :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bards are a tough class to decide on loot rights.  For weapons any other<br/>
&gt; melee class can use them better than us (since they all have dual attack),<br/>
&gt; thus isn&#39;t the guild served best by having them go to the real melees.  No<br/>
&gt; to mention, a portion of a bard&#39;s life he isn&#39;t even using weapons.  This<br/>
&gt; definitly includes most large mobs, which really make a or break a guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Example:  We killed Wuoshi.  He(she?) dropped the Crscent Blade (a SWEET<br/>
&gt; 1HS) and An Emerald Scimitar (very good ratio, but slow as hell, +100<br/>
mana).<br/>
&gt; The raid leader (clearly) awarded the crscent blade to one of our warriors<br/>
&gt; who does have his epics yet and gave the scimitar to a druid who isn&#39;t in<br/>
&gt; our guild but id on at least half our raids (we have about 10 players who<br/>
&gt; are members of small guilds, but might as well be in our guild for raid<br/>
&gt; purposes).  However, the warrior was asked to give his lammy (replaced by<br/>
&gt; the crescent blade) to me, since I did not get the scimitar. (then we<br/>
&gt; discovered bards can&#39;t wield lammy&#39;s, heh)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A similar case can be made for armor.  Would the guild not be better<br/>
served<br/>
&gt; by having a tank with a higher ac?  THough bards do take a beating too...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However bards can&#39;t be totally shafted by loot either.  1.  No raid leader<br/>
&gt; wants to shaft anyone.  2.  (at least on my server) Good bards are rare,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; most guilds don&#39;t have enough (I go on raids with at least 3 other guilds,<br/>
&gt; and we have a group of 4 bards who regularly join us from those same<br/>
guilds.<br/>
&gt; The 6 (2 from my guild) of us have discussed forming a union, hehehehe)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like point systems and if I was in charge of a guild, we would use one.<br/>
&gt; However, there is something nice about just doing &quot;whats best for the<br/>
guild&quot;<br/>
