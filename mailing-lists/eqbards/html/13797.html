<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Okay, now on to a little tid bit that might make it a little easier for<br/>
&gt; some people to get their helms:  The paladin quest mob the netmaster (ugly<br/>
&gt; little goblin) spawns in LR and walks around the lake.  His placeholder is<br/>
&gt; often an aqua gob shaman, but occasionally is a warrior dw gob.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know the spawn point of these guys, but I do know they all &quot;collect&quot; in<br/>
&gt; the cove in LR went walking around. </span></blockquote></div>
