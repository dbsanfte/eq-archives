<div id="ygrps-yiv-429092723">Got level 49 more than two weeks ago.  Could only play on weekends.<br/>
Some recent highlights:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Died 7 times in Plane of Hate.  My cleric never quite got just how<br/>
few Hit Points I have.<br/>
2.  Died 3 times to bad trains in Lower Guk.<br/>
3.  Died once in Sebelis.  Five frog pull, four frogs decided that, of<br/>
24 people there, I was the tastiest.  Never died so fast in my playing<br/>
career.  The red just plummeted straight down to nothing, without<br/>
stopping once.<br/>
4.  Died three times in City of Mist, including once when I had managed<br/>
to fall asleep.  Hey, sometimes people just take too darn long to get<br/>
organized, you know?<br/>
5.  Died to another bad train in Lower Guk.<br/>
6.  Died in Skyfire, just a big pile of bad guys all at once.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.  16 deaths in one level.  How embarrassing is that?  Curiously, I<br/>
never got negative experience for a day.  Thank goodness for level 49<br/>
rezzes.  Just didn&#39;t get much positive experience.  Hehe.<br/>
<br/>
But!  (And yes, it&#39;s anti-climactic for many of you, but tough), I got<br/>
level 50!  Giants in Burning Woods finally did the trick.  :)<br/>
