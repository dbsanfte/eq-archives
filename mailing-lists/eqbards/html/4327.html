the topic just die.  It is unfortunate because you have made some<br/>
extremely valid points, and they have illustrated a reason for the outlook<br/>
of all of my characters.  I have given up on the wonderful item<br/>
sweepstakes that are rampant on all servers and have settled down into<br/>
trying to RP and expand my character&#39;s background and story.  Without the<br/>
hunt for magical items, my drive to gain levels is all but gone.  Anyways,<br/>
just wanted to give you a pat on the back.  Someone read and listened.<br/>
