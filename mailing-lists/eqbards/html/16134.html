<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792355881"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I agree and understand.  But GZ flat out stated that <br/>
&gt;the information in SPDAT.EFF was on test for <br/>
&gt;_testing_ and even made the &#39;joke spells&#39; at the end <br/>
&gt;to prove his point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What on the test server of significance (i.e.<br/>
something that would mean a change to gameplay, dot<br/>
nerf, etc, something where verant says specifically<br/>
that test is only for test) has NOT made it to<br/>
production?  Test server is not for testing, at least<br/>
its not used as such.  I know of several instances<br/>
where a test server player has been given something to<br/>
test, item, etc and reported a bug directly to the<br/>
developer only to see it not fixed.  (High elfs coded<br/>
on the ranger only sword instead of half elfs for<br/>
example.)<br/>
