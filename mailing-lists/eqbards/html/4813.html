<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-764493494">I have read many posts on this list and experienced first hand the Z-axis<br/>
bug that affects area of effect songs like Denons Disruptive Discord (DDD)<br/>
and Chords of Dissonance.  In case some of you weren&#39;t aware of this<br/>
problem, let me give you an example of how the bug affects you.  <br/>
<br/>
One time I was in Unrest camping along the left wall across from the porch.<br/>
If you have ever been there, you are aware that you will often see the<br/>
message &quot;A festering hag begins to cast a spell&quot; even though there is,<br/>
fortunately, no hag in sight.  The hag is actually in the basement of Unrest<br/>
underneath near where you are camping.  Once before I was aware of this bug,<br/>
I was singing DDD in that area.  With the z-axis bug, even though the hag<br/>
was in the basement underneath me, the song affected her and put me on her<br/>
hate list.  She worked her way to the outside courtyard and made a beeline<br/>
right towards me, apping me twice with two lightning bolts before I ever<br/>
realied what happened.  Of course she brought some friends along with her in<br/>
the form of carrion ghous and barbed bone skeletons so my group got totally<br/>
bushwhacked.  <br/>
<br/>
This example was taken from Unrest but it has also happened to me once in<br/>
Beholder and I have read that it occurs in almost every other dungeon also.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m wondering is if Verant has acknowledged the -axis bug and if so<br/>
have they made any statement about trying to fix it.  I don&#39;t remember if<br/>
this was included in the petition so should we submit another petition just<br/>
for this bug?  I only play a bard so do not know if all classes with area of<br/>
effect spells are affected by the z-axis bug but if they are we should<br/>
include them in the petition as well.<br/>
<br/>
Before we submit a petition, I think we should also consider the possibility<br/>
that this is not even a bug.  I say that because it is within the realms of<br/>
possibility that Verant intended for our songs to work this way.  Sound does<br/>
carry so its possible that even though we can&#39;t see the monsters, they can<br/>
certainly hear our songs through the walls.  Something to consider. <br/>
<br/>
Also, for bards of higher experience, can someone post a list of all the<br/>
places where we shouldn&#39;t sing our area of effect songs due to this bug?  <br/>
