<div id="ygrps-yiv-626453409">I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s given the &quot;age&quot; and popularity of the Xegony<br/>
server; or perhaps the influx of XMas newbies with no understanding of the<br/>
dynamics of the game; but it seems like the past couple months I seem to<br/>
constantly get begs from new characters for me to give them stuff.<br/>
<br/>
    In the past I would occasionally get a request; but they were very<br/>
rare - like once or twice a month.  Now it seems every time I get near a<br/>
place like Freeport or Kelethin - it&#39;s non-stop.<br/>
<br/>
    I find it especially interesting that most are Level 1.  This shows two<br/>
things.  They haven&#39;t even bothered to try to play the game (i.e. how long<br/>
does it REALLY take to level to 2) - and they haven&#39;t done any research<br/>
(i.e. 30 minute corpse decay prior to level 6).  I started last March and<br/>
had no help; and was quite surprised that unlike some other MUD type games<br/>
I&#39;ve played - it really WAS unnecessary to get handouts to get your<br/>
character going.<br/>
<br/>
    I also had an interesting case of a guy level 12 or so who claimed he<br/>
&quot;lost his corpse&quot;.  This WAS a bard - so I don&#39;t see how he could have lost<br/>
the corpse.  I would have considered helping him (perhaps he fell asleep or<br/>
something) - but with a character name of &quot;Pimpicious&quot; or some such - I<br/>
decided not to bother...<br/>
<br/>
    The worst thing about it - is these people have no clue.  I had a guy<br/>
(who wasn&#39;t completely new to EQ - but relatively new) get introduced to me<br/>
as a friend of some guildmates starting out a bard character.  He asked me a<br/>
lot of good, intelligent questions.  Not once did he ask me for anything but<br/>
information.  I have a bunch of crappy old stuff (to me) that I gladly gave<br/>
him at level 8.  Were talking banded or slightly better type stuff.  I told<br/>
him simply to pass it along to another starting bard when he levels.<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;ve had some other cases over the past several months where I&#39;ve given<br/>
away stuff I&#39;ve outgrown to &quot;young&quot; Bards.  But first of all - only people<br/>
who&#39;ve spent enough time to get to at least level 7-9; and that they don&#39;t<br/>
beg - they try to get to know me and wait for me to offer...<br/>
