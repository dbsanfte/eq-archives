    I guess this can be on the list of - you know you&#39;re playing too much<br/>
Everquest when...<br/>
<br/>
    Was playing in one of my bands last night - where they need to balance<br/>
the solos between the three horns better - most of the solos go to the<br/>
baritone sax (go figure)..<br/>
<br/>
    So anyway - we get a new version of a tune and instead of all three<br/>
horns getting solos - there are only two (for me - trombone and the alto<br/>
sax) and I think to myself &quot;Wow, they nerfed the baritone part...&quot;<br/>
