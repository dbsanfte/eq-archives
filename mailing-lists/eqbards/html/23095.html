<div id="ygrps-yiv-147845060">If you are going to go to Kedge Keep, I highly, highly recommend <br/>
Phreekitty&#39;s guide. It&#39;s a mini book of info on this zone:<br/>

<br/>
And yes, I&#39;d also agree, bard&#39;s Ayre should be for backup use only. Jig is <br/>
a necessity. Pathing is buggy, so be sure not to charm. Don&#39;t bother with <br/>
your fear song for the same reason.<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to buy fish scales. There&#39;s merchants that sell fish <br/>
scales and batwings and other spell components. I sure wish I remembered <br/>
where they were though.<br/>

&gt;don&#39;t seem affected, we&#39;ve had a druid/enchanter charm fish in the 2nd level<br/>
&gt;south room (nothing spawns there and it&#39;s a great pull spot) without<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t wait until I&#39;m high enough...with my water song, the dungeon I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; waiting I&#39;m in range to do is Kedge Keep.  Supposedly empty and good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; xp...just sounds too perfect!  Besides, I want sharkskin drums.  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Everyone has MM drums...I wanna be different.  Until I can get Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; drums,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway...heh.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Question, though...my group will most likely depend on me to keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; breathing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What should be the actions if I were to go LD?  Should they just camp,<br/>
&gt;log<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; an alt, and wait until I show up?  heh...just a thought.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No, a bard&#39;s song should NEVER be the primary breath source. The range is<br/>
&gt; &gt; much too small and while it lasts longer than most songs you can twist, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to risk it. Keep it incase someone misses a timer<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; starts to drown, you can get it going fast enough to save them since<br/>
&gt;there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; little chance someone will be able to cast enduring breath on them fast<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Stamina is a major problem in kedge since it goes down and doesn&#39;t come<br/>
&gt;back<br/>
&gt; &gt; up unless you get hit with Invigor so the stamina song should be cycled in<br/>
&gt; &gt; there during a battle for a few zaps. Lancers on the top level hit very<br/>
&gt;hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; for their level, a decent group should be able to handle single pulls at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 30th level. My ranger did lancers from 35-42 but I only risked them solo<br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt; &gt; 38th level (it&#39;s possible at 35 but I didn&#39;t want to risk it.). My necro<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t quite manage it at 30th level although a Mage can solo with their<br/>
&gt;29th<br/>
&gt; &gt; level earth pet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Watching the spawns move about is key, it&#39;s not rough to single pull<br/>
&gt;there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is a high level PH on the top level, it can be a Piercer (35ish),<br/>
&gt; &gt; Impaler (40-42), or the Fierce Impaler (42-43, drops Gloomwater or<br/>
&gt;Darksea).<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pulling around the high level fish isn&#39;t tough, lull shouldn&#39;t be needed<br/>
&gt; &gt; although it might help.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As for the sharkskin drum ... only seen that mob once and it didn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; drum. It&#39;s kind of deep, very much a 45+ area of that zone. I love kedge<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t wait till I&#39;m going into Unrest to steal people from the basement<br/>
&gt;camp<br/>
&gt; &gt; to go swimming with my bard.<br/>
