&gt; for the past couple months, I have been fighting with the same group - a<br/>
&gt; regular group. we are well balanced class wise (tank tank healer caster<br/>
&gt; bard) with a couple &#39;extra&#39; chars we can go to the bench for (wizards,<br/>
&gt; enchanter, necro, druid).  you should really work to put something like<br/>

Unfortunately I can only play a couple days a week anymore without my family<br/>
conducting an intervention in my best interests. I&#39;ll be lucky to stay at<br/>

progression is impressive, yours is a close second. :)<br/>
