	As far as it being useful, I believe the place is called Kerr Keep. Totally<br/>
underwater (to get there at least). I&#39;ve also heard that there is something<br/>
interesting lying deep in Lake Rathetear...<br/>

	Good Journey,<br/>

Hello All ,<br/>
	I remember seeing a discussion going on about, where to purchase the<br/>
Water Breathing song , and its effect is obvious, but my question is , is it<br/>
useful ? Are there any dungeons that are completely under water? things like<br/>
that really interest me , someplace that almost no one goes to. If anyone<br/>
knows it would be greatly appreciated .<br/>
P.S. - if you don&#39;t want to spoil it for others , e-mail is a-ok.<br/>
