<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] &quot;Useless&quot; songs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328870615">Another rhetorical argument here.  People are getting into arguments here<br/>
about whether songs are &quot;Completely Useless&quot;.  I think we do have a few of<br/>
these - (Cassandra&#39;s Ellegy).  To me &quot;Completely Useless&quot; means that - other<br/>
than making up a whacky hypothetical situation there is absolutely no<br/>
serious use of the spell. - I&#39;m terming these Useless.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have argued certain songs (DDD, Lyssa&#39;s Concord) are completely<br/>
useless - while others point out rare, occasional uses for them (Some have<br/>
found these songs very useful - maybe my examples aren&#39;t good here - but<br/>
stay with me for a second).  This category of songs would be &quot;Only Very<br/>
marginally useful&quot;.  I&#39;m terming these Marginal,<br/>
<br/>
Then we also have the issue of songs that become useless as you get to<br/>
higher levels.  This is more problematic - because if a lower level bard<br/>
DOES need them.  Some of these no one would argue against.  Most higher<br/>
level bards get SS Gloves - so the Enduring Breath song becomes Useless.   I<br/>
don&#39;t think anyone would seriously argue against 16 level bards getting that<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
Other songs become useless at higher levels because the effect doesn&#39;t scale<br/>
enough.  IMHO this is the problem with DDD.  Verant agreed but there<br/>
response was IMHO clearly dramatically insufficient.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a fair argument about how many, say Shaman spells are no longer<br/>
useful - Casters get SO many more spells - they&#39;re designed to become<br/>
obsolete when the new comes in.  Many of our songs become Marginal when<br/>
perhaps they could be tuned better to not be so.<br/>
<br/>
So the issue really boils down to - what percentage of our songs are<br/>
Marginal, and should they / could they be tuned to make them less so without<br/>
unbalancing the game...<br/>
