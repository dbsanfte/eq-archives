<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429892946">At level 27 I solo&#39;d all the way to 38 for about 70% of the time using<br/>
charm/selo&#39;s. The reason I say only 70% is because lag affects our songs and<br/>
I would get killed if soloing at real laggy times.<br/>
<br/>
First off make sure you have your mask of deception from Lower Guk already.<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you why in a bit. Then I would head to Lake of Ill Omen if not<br/>
already there.<br/>
Head out to the pillars along the shoreline. This is the open area in<br/>
between the gobbie ruins and the sarnak fort. You can stay here till about<br/>
level 30-31. Then either head to Frontier Montains or The Overthere. My<br/>
favorite hunting spot in Overthere is the little area in between the outpost<br/>
and the skyshrine zone. If you have the mask of deception already you can<br/>
bank in town and even train mobs there to safety because the guards will<br/>
protect you.<br/>
<br/>
The following is a posted strategy that I placed in a forum  at<br/>
EQ.castersrealm.com not too long ago. You will find that I have mentioned a<br/>
group strategy and a solo strategy. Lag willing you will be able to solo as<br/>
I have till 38 for about 70% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a group I would have this song memmed to help out in bad pulls. If we got<br/>
2-3 mobs the party would fight one and I would handle the other two. I would<br/>
start selos to get my running on and then start a charm on the lower con<br/>
mob. I then tap my /pet attack hotkey or let my self get hit by the<br/>
offending mob. My pet would then start to kill the other mob. As soon as<br/>
charm wears off start it again and repeat the process.<br/>
I started to solo by using my running song and then I&#39;d find two mobs and<br/>
agro each. I do not recommend you pull with a charm. Get them both agroed<br/>
using a bellow or just get close to them. Start running in small circles and<br/>
then start a charm on the lower con mob. Then select the other mob and hit<br/>
/pet attack hotkey. Once they start fighting (you will hear them) start up<br/>
selos again. Watch the fight till you get the message that charm has broken.<br/>
Keep an eye out for possible adds and lead your two mobs to a nice quiet<br/>
spot. Repeat the process until either mob is at 1/4 health. Then if your pet<br/>
is at lower health, select the other mob, charm it and tell it to attack the<br/>
other mob to finish it. If your pet still has higher health, Recharm it and<br/>
have it finish off that mob. Keep in mind you have to have a charmed pet for<br/>
you to get xp for the kill. You then have a choice to either finish the mob<br/>
yourself or repeat the cycle with another mob.<br/>
<br/>
Some things to keep in mind:<br/>
1.If you start out charming a mob to pull it to you you will still be<br/>
running once the charm breaks for a while as your other pet will have to do<br/>
some damage to get it to release the agro on you.<br/>
Example: You see Mob A and Mob B near each other. You decide to charm A and<br/>
then tell it to attack B. B has full agro on A but A still has full agro on<br/>
you unless you recharm him. If you accidently forget which is which and<br/>
charm B, you will have to tell it to attack A and A will also start chasing<br/>
you even if its being whacked by B until B hits it to build enough hate for<br/>
it to agro on B.<br/>
<br/>
2.The 27th level charm song does not work on mobs 38th level and higher.<br/>
<br/>
3. If in the course of charming you get a resist, immediately start selos,<br/>
wait for a pulse and then try to recharm. I&#39;ve had up to 6 resists in a row<br/>
and still come out ahead because I&#39;m patient.<br/>
<br/>
4. Lag affects songs. If you get hit with lag run close to guards or a town<br/>
or near a zone before it gets worse. If your lagmeter is at 60%+ and your<br/>
songs have stopped for more than 6 seconds, more than likely you will be<br/>
near death unless you put some distance between you and the mobs.<br/>
<br/>
5. If your pull gets stolen this is an excellent way to get it back.<br/>
<br/>
6. With alot of practice you will be able to get selos going, hit a charm,<br/>
get a resist, hit charm once more and succeed before you have to hit selos<br/>
again. You may even be able to figure out the timing to get two mobs so far<br/>
down that they both decide to run away at the same time. If this happens you<br/>
must keep one or the other charmed to recieve credit for the kill.<br/>
<br/>
7. Rhinos and Tigers/Grimalkins fight until the death. They will not run<br/>
away even at the last hitpoint. If you are charming another mob and one of<br/>
these and they are very close on health, I&#39;d choose a rhino or<br/>
tiger/grimalkin as the other one will be more likely to try to make a break<br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
8. Some people may question why I say charm the lower con mob first. The<br/>
reason for this is that over time I&#39;ve found that the more I charm the same<br/>
mob, the more resists I get. I always charm the lower con and if I have to<br/>
then I charm the higher con and have him finish the other off. It all<br/>
depends on who is losing the fight between the two.<br/>
<br/>
9. I&#39;ve added a druid or ranger to snare the mobs I&#39;m kiting and to watch my<br/>
back. I mainly did this during laggy times. Make sure the snarer only snares<br/>
or heals you, anything more would seriously agro the mobs onto your partner.<br/>
Not recommended. We still got great XP.<br/>
<br/>
10. Lastly, I have been able to kite 4 mobs fairly quickly using this<br/>
technique. Just takes alot of running and patience.<br/>
