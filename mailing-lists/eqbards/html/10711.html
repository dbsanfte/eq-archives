&gt; My biggest laugh was at Brian&#39;s mention of Bard only items.  That&#39;s a good<br/>
&gt; one.  Excepting the quest armor, there are what, two bard only items that<br/>
&gt; you can get without taking on a dragon or going to the planes?  A Shawl of<br/>
&gt; the Wind Spirit and Mistmoore Battle Drums, that&#39;s it as far as I know.  A<br/>
&gt; piece of armor equal to cloth and a drum on a 35+ mob.  To even mention bard<br/>
&gt; only items was in my opinion a slap in the face.  Considering one is useless<br/>
&gt; after 3rd level and the other sells for 500pp+ that&#39;s a joke.  What other<br/>
&gt; class has so little equipment dedicated to it?  There must be one but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what it would be.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Clerics.<br/>
<br/>
Clerics get impossible Quest armor plus level 46+ Plane armor.  I don&#39;t think there is anything else out there that is Cleric only<br/>
(I could be wrong).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My next point regards weapons.  If they are trying to balance the items, why<br/>
&gt; is it I am still using the same weapons at 21st level I used at 12th level?<br/>
&gt; There really isn&#39;t anything much better than my dragoon dirk and screaming<br/>
&gt; mace available for bards at my level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thats the price you have to pay for playing on an aged server.  Dirks are everywhere due to a flooded market when Dvinn used to drop<br/>
it everytime.  If you were on a new server, you wouldn&#39;t be seeing a Dirk or Screamer until the mid to high teens.  Many of the<br/>
people that played at the start used those weapons well into their 30&#39;s.<br/>
