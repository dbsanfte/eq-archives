<div id="ygrps-yiv-854340222">I have the pleasure of one of the iscar masks - its a lot of fun )<br/>
<br/>
It is dropped by a level 49 wandering Wizard called Harbinger Dronik in<br/>
Trakanon&#39;s Teeth.<br/>
<br/>
I have spent a fair amout of time in that zone and only seen him once, I was<br/>
out pulling hunters and foragers when he suprised me. I was dead in seconds,<br/>
luckily my group killed him and ressed me for the mask ).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if he is a triggered spawn or just really rare.<br/>
<br/>
I am really interested in the Erudite mask too, roumer says it comes from<br/>
the Howling Stones but I would appreciate confirmation on that.<br/>
<br/>
PS Thanks for all the raid advice. I ended up helping organise a Hate raid<br/>
which was great fun, I even got some Imbrued Gloves.<br/>
