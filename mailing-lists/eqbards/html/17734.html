&gt; ???!!!  And your level 11?  This looks like a job for the dynamic duo of<br/>
&gt; Rokenn & John Kim!  (Didn&#39;t at least one of say you like being presented<br/>
&gt; with challenges that cause you to find new ways of playing a character?)  <br/>

&gt; In truth, if the mage were level 11 I&#39;d still place bets against you.<br/>
&gt; Sorry.  They&#39;ve got some pretty good pets.<br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s an anything-goes fight (which I&#39;d assume it is if a<br/>
level 15 is fighting a level 11), I would kick in Accel, wait<br/>
for him to order his pet to attack me, then quickly drag the<br/>
pet out of command range and through a bunch of hostile mobs<br/>
(arc your path so you don&#39;t go through the mobs but the pet<br/>
does).<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to be quite so dirty, I&#39;d drag the pet away,<br/>
run back and attack the mage, drag the pet away again when it<br/>
returns, repeat.  You can use Warsong and melee to hope to<br/>
interrupt his casting, or Accel to try to get out of range<br/>
before his spell fires (note that neither consumes mana, so<br/>
you&#39;d be relying on fizzles to deplete his mana).  And if the<br/>
pet roots you...<br/>
<br/>
The key I think is that you can stay out of attack range and<br/>
heal indefinitely, while he cannot (gotta run out of bandages<br/>
some time).<br/>
