 </span></blockquote>actually he never really said it was a nerf, he just said they were moving the exp penalty.<br/>
which COULD be the case depending on how verant programs level checks.  if they really<br/>
have a separate experience table to check against for each value of experience penalty,<br/>
i.e. one for troll sk&#39;s, one for iksar monks, etc, etc, then the system they have works fine.<br/>
<br/>
if they create one experience table and &#39;&#39;normalize&#39;&#39; experience to it, i.e. calculate experience<br/>
by this formula:  Exp_gained = Base_exp * class_pen * race_pen, then they have really<br/>
just moved the penalty, although it is much more easily avoided, as in get a rez or just don&#39;t<br/>
die.</div>
