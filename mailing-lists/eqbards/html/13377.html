<div id="ygrps-yiv-230181023">You being the cleric guy, how do you feel about magicians having better<br/>
healing spells for their pets than clerics do for others now?  I cannot<br/>
fathom this change personally, it seems to be incredibly anti-group oriented<br/>
to me.  Maybe now magicians will stop whining about necros with pets soling<br/>
to 35th since they can too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Much as people talk about Bind and Gate, I personally<br/>
&gt; &gt; think that the pet spells are the most ridiculously<br/>
&gt; &gt; overpowered spells in the game (with the possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; exception of Group Mez).  I soloed my Enchantress to level<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah.  Most of the pet classes (mage the possible exception)<br/>
&gt; would be just fine without a pet - still better than any melee<br/>
&gt; class.  I got into an argument about this with some guy once -<br/>
&gt; he thought it was ok that a L49 pet could kill a L50 melee<br/>
&gt; player in a straight one-on-one fight.  His reasoning was that<br/>
&gt; duels were a special case.  Pets are balanced because they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; dumb, so in a real fight you would always prefer a real tank<br/>
&gt; to a pet.  I told him if his reasoning was that intelligent<br/>
&gt; player + dumb pet was an acceptable combo, then they should<br/>
&gt; allow the melee classes to be able to summon caster pets.<br/>
&gt; Never got a reply to that one...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SK get a pet.  My SK friend (lvl 36) said don&#39;t bother saving bone chips for<br/>
him anymore as his pet was useless.  I didn&#39;t inquire further.<br/>
<br/>
(please don&#39;t take this next section too serious, I&#39;m not)<br/>
<br/>
As to caster pets for melee classes, that would be a joke.  Assuming same<br/>
rules as other pets, a level 50 would summon a lvl 39 pet.  This caster pet<br/>
would hit the full resist cap for no effect on creatures 45+.  You wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be able to control what spells the pet casts, the stupid pet would get to<br/>
make this choice.  And remember how one blast-happy wizard can cause the<br/>
whole party to die, one blast-happy stupid pet would be even more trouble.<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t take long for tanks to realize they are better off without pets.<br/>
<br/>
What you really need is a pet cleric that follows you around and casts heal<br/>
on you in combat.  That&#39;s what every tank really wants.  Knowing Verant,<br/>
you&#39;d probably get stuck with a pet bard that doesn&#39;t even know how to sing,<br/>
much less twist.  And if it could sing, it would only Bellow in battle and<br/>
play Jig to speed up mana regen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, pets are very nice under the right circumstances.  Pets come<br/>
with a lot of baggage that make them less valuable than a tank in almost<br/>
every way.<br/>
