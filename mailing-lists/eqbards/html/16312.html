night.  Well, guess when they happened for us?  We finally<br/>
managed to break into fear on our third try without everyone<br/>
getting killed at zone-in.  We&#39;d looted most of our equipment<br/>
and were forming groups.  The monk brings in the mobs he&#39;s led<br/>
away, so all we have to do is kill these 3 shiverbacks and<br/>
scareling and the enchanter already has the scareling mezed,<br/>
and...<br/>
<br/>
40% of the group goes LD.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, at least we managed to break in on our fourth<br/>
attempt.<br/>

&gt; err... Nevermind :).<br/>

call keeping Elemental Rhythms up for about 15 seconds to<br/>
resist 3 fear attempts before Nag fell helping).  He dropped<br/>
the druid crook, shaman hammer, orb if tishan (I passed),<br/>
gauntlets of fiery might, and *two* cloaks of flames.<br/>
