<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080292844">Not sure, I quoted from Rokenn&#39;s post.  I saw it at 6-9 seconds also, but<br/>
that duration would not explain the result of having a mob that just nodded<br/>
attack 2 seconds later.  Of course neither would a duration of 3-5 seconds<br/>
for that matter.  I&#39;m still not convinced we aren&#39;t seeing revisionism at<br/>
work here with GZ trying to tell us the song is designed as it works now,<br/>
regardless of how it was really designed to work.<br/>
<br/>
In my test nodded mobs either <br/>
A: attacked apparently immediately, though according to the logfile output 2<br/>
seconds later and always 2 seconds btw. or <br/>
B: did not attack at all during that pulse of the song.  <br/>
There was absolutely no evidence of a random duration, mobs always attacked<br/>
2 seconds after nodding or not at all within a given pulse.  This does not<br/>
seem to fit with GZ&#39;s duration of 1-1.5 ticks explanation and the separate<br/>
resist message we don&#39;t see theory.<br/>

&gt; &gt;2) Lullaby is a 1 (to about 1.5) tick song. It is not effective when<br/>
&gt; twisted <br/>
&gt; &gt;with another song. If you plan to use this song as an Area Mezmerize, use<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;ONLY this song. The length is about 3-5 seconds long only.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Given this I have a question.  Since the song only pulses every 6 seconds,<br/>
&gt; how can you expect to keep a mob mez&#39;d even if you don&#39;t twist it?  <br/>
<br/>
Was the &quot;3-5 seconds&quot; a quote from GZ, or from an observer? <br/>
I suspect GZ only said it was 1-1.5 pulses, which would put it<br/>
at 6-9 seconds (which is what I&#39;d estimate it at).<br/>
<br/>
The 25% minimum resist rate is the killer though.<br/>
