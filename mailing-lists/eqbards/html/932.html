<b>Subject:</b> How do you use the lull song and Star Wars. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-89723327">Hello all,<br/>
     <br/>
         A couple of questions from a new bard on your list. (I apologize <br/>
     if these have been asked before) BTW, this is by far the most <br/>
     interesting and mature Everquest list that I have seen so far.  Must <br/>
     say something about the type of person that enjoys playing a bard.  <br/>
     (join the EQ_clerics list for a bit and you&#39;ll see what I mean...)<br/>
     <br/>
     1.  Exactly how do you use the Level 8 lull song?  Is it an area <br/>
     effect song or do you have to target each MOB in turn?  Perhaps a step <br/>
     by step description of the proper tactics to use when facing a group <br/>
     of yellwo-blue monsters would best illustrate this. (thanks)<br/>
     <br/>
     2.  Did anyone else notice how quiet it was last night on the <br/>
     Everquest servers?  They only had about 60%  of their normal <br/>
     population.  Guess there is a strong correlation between playing <br/>
     Everquest and being a Star Wars fan...   :smiles knowingly.<br/>
     I expect that the next few days may be a good time to grab some <br/>
     experience at those place that always seem to be over camped.<br/>
     <br/>
     3.  I am a Level 10 human Bard.  I usually party with an Enchanter <br/>
     (good combo, the pet tanks, she zaps and I tank/support) but I am <br/>
     rather poor.  Any good suggestions on location or MOBS that garner a <br/>
     goodly amount of loot so I can finish my banded ensemble?<br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks in advance,<br/>
     <br/>
