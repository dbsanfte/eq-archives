&gt; Subject: [eqbards] A new /who command (OT)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is an idea I posted on alt.games.everquest newsgroup.  <br/>
&gt; The few replies<br/>
&gt; it generated were all positive.  Let me know what you think <br/>
&gt; and maybe it is<br/>
&gt; something else we can post on the official EQ message board.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to see a new /who command added to the game.  <br/>
&gt; The command would<br/>
&gt; work like this.  You type in /who &quot;zone name&quot; and it tells <br/>
&gt; you who all is in<br/>
&gt; that zone.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can&#39;t think of any way this would affect any class balance issue.<br/>
&gt; Assuming that class balance is not affected in any manner by <br/>
&gt; adding this<br/>
&gt; /who command, the only reason I can think of to not implement <br/>
&gt; it is that it<br/>
&gt; is too hard to code.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Comments?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been wanting something like this for a long time, and I agree with your<br/>
justifications as to why this would greatly help the game. Ultimately, this<br/>
performs the same parsing as any other &quot;/who all XXXXX&quot; command, so I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t think that this is all that more complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, they could make this &quot;who&quot; command a bit more powerful by allowing<br/>
us to essentially &quot;grep&quot; the &quot;who all&quot; command.<br/>
<br/>
As an addition, I&#39;ve always had problems finding my guildmates for one of<br/>
the guilds that I belong to. Someone tried convincing me that there was a<br/>
&quot;/who all guild&quot; command, but that certainly doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
For Windleaf, who belongs to &quot;Guardians of the Divine Light&quot;, I can find any<br/>
of his buddies with a &quot;/who all guard&quot; command. But the other guildname<br/>
doesn&#39;t work as the GM had to tweak the name, so the guildname is &quot; Order of<br/>
the Sacred Nut&quot; (it&#39;s meant to be funny :-)<br/>
<br/>
Notice the space character in front of the name. This screws up any chance<br/>
for me to see who else in this guild is logged on, but was the solution by<br/>
the GM since there was another &quot;Order of the Sacred (something)&quot; on the<br/>
server and the server only recognizes the first 16 characters according to<br/>
the GM. So she added a &quot; &quot; in front of the name. At the time I didn&#39;t argue.<br/>
(Believe me, it&#39;s a real long story).<br/>
