<div id="ygrps-yiv-785847303">Same thing happens with the new scale of the wolf series for Shaman, it&#39;s a<br/>
Very Bad Thing.  I think its cool that they gave travel only songs but<br/>
they&#39;re really not very practical.  At least with Selo&#39;s you can keep trying<br/>
over and over.<br/>
<br/>
Have to say though, Kunark is a blast :-)<br/>

<br/>
		it almost got me killed for the same reasons in Burning<br/>
Woods.  this song is<br/>
		not for fighting and definitely NOT for escape, especially<br/>
against casters.<br/>
		every time i would finally get it to pulse, blam i get hit<br/>
by a spell and it<br/>
		falls, because of the invisibility effect.  for this same<br/>
reason, niv&#39;s<br/>
		melody and nillipus&#39; march drop because they have a rune<br/>
effect.  as soon as<br/>
		it&#39;s exceeded (which is one hit from these mobs) the whole<br/>
effect drops.<br/>
