HOW do you get an inventory slot into a Hot Key Slot? I&#39;ve tried doing the<br/>
&quot;drag&quot; Thing and it doesn&#39;t work. Could I be doing something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt;&gt;Is this what you all mean when you talk about singing more than one song<br/>
&gt;and are<br/>
&gt;&gt;there any tricks to doing this better? Usually my &quot;twisting&quot; is more like<br/>
&gt;stumbling :)<br/>
&gt;&gt;Frequently my timing isn&#39;t right on changing songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I like to call that &quot;weaving&quot; :) - The only trick I&#39;ve found is to have the<br/>
&gt;songs you weave in your hotkeys. I also have weapons slots and inventory<br/>
&gt;slots in another hotkey bank - which makes it easy to run from something<br/>
&gt;that is too tough but attacking AND do the switch to the drum for Selos.<br/>
&gt;That seems the fastest way to have less trouble weaving. However, as I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;only L11, quite the young bard myself, I don&#39;t have any other tricks except<br/>
&gt;to say that I notice that I stumble through it mostly when I&#39;ve been<br/>

&gt;experience says differently, it&#39;s all a matter of hotkeys and timing. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know if this helped but I hope so.<br/>
