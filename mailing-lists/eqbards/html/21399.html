<div id="ygrps-yiv-283057777">Just saw this from EQ Vault - an excerpt from an Abashi post on the Verant<br/>
boards.  I think it explains a lot.<br/>

Quote from original post: 1) Un-gag more staff members. Letting the coder in<br/>
charge of the UI, and the guy in charge of tradeskills speak was a stroke of<br/>
genius! Why don&#39;t we see GZ speak out anymore? What&#39;s the deal with the gag<br/>
orders in the first place??]<br/>
<br/>
GZ is involved on another project but still consults with the EQ team and<br/>
will always be the ArchMage :) We do have to place some limits on how many<br/>
people can be out here in the public light, and how often, since they of<br/>
course are working on ways to add content to and improve the game.</div>
