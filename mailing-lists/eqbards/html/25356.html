<div id="ygrps-yiv-114120619">I don&#39;t really agree. We are fairly weak at soloing and not very good<br/>
damage dealers in groups. More over, we are weak in raids. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Aftathott on this one. Verant did a very good job balancing<br/>
Bards in solo and group situations. But we are far less valuable in raid<br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
Raids are one area VI should definitely spend some time on before<br/>
releasing Luclin. I hope they address XP in raids, class balance in raids<br/>
and communication (chat) in raids.<br/>
<br/>
More and more of the game is around raids where the top Warrior, Rogue,<br/>
Shammy, Chanter and Cleric take the XP. The 6th spot is very likely a Monk<br/>
for pulling, but mages, wizzies and SKs are all more preferred than Bards.<br/>

Ugh....<br/>
<br/>
Its funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find<br/>
myself<br/>
sometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of keeping a low<br/>
profile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice. Seriously, don&#39;t laugh, its just<br/>
that bards seem very overpowered to me at higher levels, then again 60<br/>
shaman with Can IV.... I used to think all level 60 were equally powerful<br/>
but I&#39;m changing my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I hope nobody else figures this out!<br/>
