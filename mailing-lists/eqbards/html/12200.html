<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545134667">Yes of course you will make level 50.  However, bards are group-centric<br/>
class, so if your aim is to more or less solo to 50 I&#39;d look at Necros or<br/>
Druids (but bards are much more fun).  Soloing is very difficult past about<br/>
level 12, so if you&#39;re soloing now, that is probably why you&#39;re seeing your<br/>
experience slow down.  I agree wholeheartedly with the other poster that<br/>
said tanks are your friends at these levels.  Find a Warrior, Ranger or<br/>
Paladin to tank for you - a class with taunt - and then just do dervishes or<br/>
raiders until you get to 14th/15th or so.  Then move to Oasis of Marr and<br/>
partner with another tank.  The Caimans there are great experience but very<br/>
little loot.  Find a tank partner who is tired of sitting on his bottom for<br/>
15 minutes healing after every fight and group with him.   He&#39;ll love you<br/>
for your healing and Anthem de Arms, and you&#39;ll love him for the damage<br/>
he&#39;ll dish out.  That&#39;s a great combo and location at that level.  Frankly<br/>
you&#39;ll find no reason to leave until 20th.  At 20th ask us again and we&#39;ll<br/>
be happy to help you some more!  ;-)<br/>

You can easily make high levels without camping, but unfortunately some of<br/>
the equipment that you want (or feel that you need) will either have to be<br/>
purchased from someone who camped for it or camped for.  I too have a low<br/>
tolerance for camping an item and have done very little of it in my EQ life.<br/>
Like you I get restless and move on.<br/>
<br/>
The game was designed to take a lot of time.  I remember reading a post from<br/>
Brad McQaid (the producer of EverQuest) that the typical player should take<br/>
a year to get to level 50 (many powergames beat that of course).  So don&#39;t<br/>
worry, the game isn&#39;t a race, it&#39;s a world.  Live in it.  It you can only<br/>
live in it for two hours a week, that&#39;s ok.  If you chose to spend your two<br/>
hours that week working on your Fishing Skill or something - so what.  Do<br/>
what&#39;s enjoyable to you and you&#39;ve won.  Sounds corny but it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
As to your other comment about equipment speeding things up, this is perhaps<br/>
only true at lower levels for a twinked character (i.e. a player that has<br/>
equipment far above his level).  The game is balanced so that at the higher<br/>
levels you are expected to have that equipment and the mobs are suitably<br/>
more difficult.  In other words, without advanced equipment at high levels<br/>
you simply get ripped to shreds.<br/>

&gt; I play a HE 13 level bard, but I am only a part-time player<br/>
&gt; (maybe a couple<br/>
&gt; hours a week).  Lvl 12 took forever and 13 seems to be taking longer...<br/>
&gt; Will leveling get easier as I get more levels or does it take longer for<br/>
&gt; each new level?  I know that the XP gap gets bigger each level, but<br/>
&gt; hopefully the better equipment that comes later and a better selection of<br/>
&gt; mobs make it easier? To make things short, is the easier or<br/>
&gt; harder to level<br/>
&gt; in the early teens compared to later levels..<br/>
&gt; Also, is it impossible to reach high levels without camping?  I hate<br/>
&gt; camping and will not camp for more than 1/2 an hour before I get bored and<br/>
&gt; leave....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
