<div id="ygrps-yiv-422485415">It seems to me, aggro is different when you&#39;re the monster.  Monsters same<br/>
as you are indifferent, but others scowl...I didn&#39;t think to try to press<br/>
it, and get too close...too used to avoiding scowlers, unless I know I&#39;m<br/>
attacking...heh.<br/>
<br/>
But...there was one incident that stands out.  I was a goblin whelp in Wars<br/>
Woods.  I watched a scaled wolf walk right by other goblins, but tear into<br/>
me when he got close enough to aggro.<br/>
<br/>
Hardly conclusive...I don&#39;t believe it was another PC mob, since it didn&#39;t<br/>
make a beeline for me until it was in aggro range...in other words, it acted<br/>
like a mob...heh.<br/>
<br/>
Could only get the monster button on test server.  Didn&#39;t show up on any of<br/>
the live PVP servers...not to mention, it took 10-30 tries to get logged in<br/>
to the login server, and on getting disconnected, would have to try to login<br/>
all over again.<br/>
<br/>
More to the point, what you described, Mu, is a GM event.  :)  Only a<br/>
problem if you get caught, since only GM&#39;s have been able to create and<br/>
control creatures that lay waste to entire zones.  Frankly, I don&#39;t see the<br/>
difference, since not many people will have multiple machines in the same<br/>
room, to do that.<br/>

Here is an interesting thing to think about.  I have a Higher lvl enchanter<br/>
on a PvP server.  My brother logs on as a monster in and tells me (we are in<br/>
the same house) what zone he is in.  I find him, charm him and then buff him<br/>
to no end.  Wait till charm wears off and watch him go rabid on unsuspecting<br/>
newbies. Sounds like it could be a problem to me.<br/>

Well, the patch message itself is interesting enough (playing monsters? I <br/>
am SO there!)  but there are also some Bard-related notes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon. Now if the bard has his Epic <br/>
and an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect will take <br/>
precedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That should please those who&#39;ve gotten it.<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
&quot;Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  I&#39;ve been working with a piercing weapon as my primary for a while...<br/>
