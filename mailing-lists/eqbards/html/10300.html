&gt; the front gates. From what I can determine, my hand fell on the keyboard<br/>
&gt; and came to rest of the w key that I use for forward movement, so I<br/>
&gt; walked off the dock into the water and actually swam a fair way before I<br/>
&gt; drowned. :)<br/>

were dragging sand giants and spectres up and down the beach<br/>
every 5 minutes, so after a particularly nasty fight, I<br/>
levitated myself and ran out over the ocean to med/heal up.  <br/>
I fell asleep, the levitate expired, and I drowned.<br/>
