I wonder if our AE songs like DDD and CoD actually have a infinite<br/>
cylindrical AE instead of a sphere around the singer?  For example, the<br/>
infinite cylindrical AE will affect anything within the radius of the<br/>
cylinder that is in front/behind you, above you (no matter how high), and<br/>
below you (no matter how low).  With a sphere, the AE would be an equal<br/>
radius from you in all directions.  I have always been under the impression<br/>
that the radius of our AE sounds was a sphere.  I have also always been<br/>
under the impression that the effect of the z-axis bug was that mobs<br/>
separated from you by the ground/wall but still within the radius of the<br/>
sphere were still affected.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm this?  <br/>

&gt; If the zone is hvly camped and the spawns are getting actively pulled -<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; no problems.  If not, you get attacked by invisible birds (cuz they stand<br/>
&gt; on<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you were somewhere like the aviak village in<br/>
&gt; SK, you could even confirm how far the radius extended along the z-axis.<br/>
