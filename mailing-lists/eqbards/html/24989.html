<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325839498">Ok, I have had 4 pieces of plate armor waiting to be quested. I completed my<br/>
legs last week, but I&#39;m still stuck on the other 3 gems.<br/>
<br/>
I need 1 crushed Topaz, I got 2 in Icewell Keep yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
I need 3 crushed Flamed Emeralds. 2 of these dropped yesterday in Icewell,<br/>
but I wasn&#39;t going to try to get these also, other guild members needed<br/>
these also. The Emeralds are for the bracer, so that&#39;s a total of 6 Emeralds<br/>
one person might need. So, these are always in high demand.<br/>
<br/>
I need 3 crushed Coral. I&#39;m not sure where these drop.<br/>
<br/>
So, I have a few questions. Where do ya&#39;ll see the highest gem drop rate? I<br/>
have hunted Icewell Keep, Velk Lab and the Armor mobs in Wakening. I know<br/>
gems drop in CS also, but do you take a negative Dragon faction for killing<br/>
these? Where does the Coral drop? I really want to do the Coral quest the<br/>
most because it will give me the biggest stat upgrade from what I am<br/>
wearing. Also, do you have to do 2 quest to get the unique helm graphic or<br/>
do you get the unique helm from the plate helm and 3 crushed Coral?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for so many questions, but it is bothersome to know you have armor<br/>
upgrades in your bank just waiting on the gems.<br/>
<br/>
 btw killing for 4-5 hours yesterday in Icewell and Velk Lab needed our<br/>
guild a total of 11 gems, bot too bad. People on the Tunare server don&#39;t<br/>
seem to sell the quest gems outright, mostly trade for other gems only.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
