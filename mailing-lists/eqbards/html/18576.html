&gt; I don&#39;t dissagree.  Most of the FoH people I have met are very <br/>
nice, as<br/>
&gt; individuals.  And they&#39;re extremely nice to each other.  They work <br/>
VERY well<br/>
&gt; together.  I know several founding members from Beta (Klague comes <br/>
to mind).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, as a GUILD, FoH is one of the most arrogant, least willing <br/>
to work<br/>
&gt; with others, most egotistical and loudmouthed guild on the server.  <br/>
I WAS A<br/>
&gt; guide so I know they don&#39;t have GM&#39;s in their pockets.  I also know <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; their attitude and behavior on Veeshan has gotten their GM, all <br/>
their<br/>
&gt; officers and several members suspended periodically.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, they don&#39;t intentionally train.<br/>
&gt; No, they aren&#39;t generally rude or crude to other players.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes:  They do own spawns by rotating people in and out.<br/>
&gt; Yes:  They do KS if they feel justified<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I personally have experienced this from FoH.  I forget their names <br/>
but way<br/>
&gt; back when Drelz still dropped Jboots I was in there, having logged <br/>
on at 6am<br/>
&gt; with 2 friends to get the jboot camp.  The server had JUST come up <br/>
and we<br/>
&gt; got the Jboot Spawn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, as we all know Veeshan has LONG used the list system.  A Group <br/>
gets the<br/>
&gt; room and other groups/people get on a list to get into it when that <br/>
group is<br/>
&gt; done.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Along comes someone from FOH (troll warrior) and DEMANDS To be <br/>
given the<br/>
&gt; spawn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We, naturally, refused.  And I told him he was welcome to join the <br/>
group and<br/>
&gt; he could loot the boots when it was his turn.  He said &#39;no, I will <br/>
get first<br/>
&gt; loot&#39;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We ignored him and refused to let him in.  Shortly thereafter about <br/>
4<br/>
&gt; members of FOH, including a 50 wizard showed up.   Needless to say <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Wizard started KSing us (luckily the ones he KS&#39;d didn&#39;t have boots)<br/>
&gt; regularly so we called in a guide.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Luckily we managed to get the boots while he was medding and then <br/>
we left.<br/>
&gt; I know this isn&#39;t the _norm_ for FOH but it happens often enough <br/>
and to<br/>
&gt; enough different people that they get a very bad name.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
help that<br/>
&gt; if you talk to one of the officers they flat out deny it and don&#39;t <br/>
even<br/>
&gt; appologise for the behavior of their members.   Myrlyn was one of <br/>
the few<br/>
&gt; who would try to smooth things over and from what I understand Furor<br/>
&gt; basically kicked him out of the guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry that FoH has such a bad rap.  But they&#39;ve earned it over <br/>
the past<br/>
&gt; several months.  Calling other guilds &quot;Farmers&quot; and &quot;campers&quot; just <br/>
because<br/>
&gt; they went into Hate 8 hours after FoH left.  I&#39;ve seen them come in <br/>
and KS<br/>
&gt; Nagafen when another guild was still fighting him.  With the excuse <br/>
that &quot;He<br/>
&gt; would have killed you anyway&quot; and absolutely no remorse or apology <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; KS&#39;ing the dragon, taking all the loot and calling the other guild <br/>
a bunch<br/>
&gt; of losers among other things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry Sartori.  I have friends in FoH too.  But I don&#39;t let my <br/>
friendship<br/>
&gt; blind me to the fact that the guild, as a whole, not everyone, but <br/>
overall,<br/>
&gt; is a pack of thugs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not stating this as a flame.  Merely laying out the reasons <br/>
why FoH has<br/>
&gt; earned their reputation.  It&#39;s been a year since release.  They&#39;ve <br/>
done<br/>
&gt; nothing to improve relations with other guilds.  In fact they&#39;ve <br/>
alienated<br/>
&gt; almost every other guild on the server.  And they&#39;ve alienated most <br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; players too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yup, I got a lot of friends in FoH<br/>
&gt; Do I like them?  Yup<br/>
&gt; Do I like the guild?  Hell no, never will<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; PS:  In fact I refused to join FoH because of these attitudes that <br/>
the guild<br/>
&gt; (as a whole, not individually) has.<br/>

&gt; &gt; They&#39;re the most powerful guild on Veeshan. Because of this, your <br/>
question<br/>
&gt; &gt; will most likely be answered with the typical: They&#39;re <br/>
powergaming losers,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they KS and train people hourly and on purpose, they have GM&#39;s in <br/>
their<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; &gt; pockets, they take over zones and push everyone else out, they <br/>
perma-camp<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawns by rotating people in and out to keep someone on the spot, <br/>
they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; all arrogant egotistical pricks (a couple are, but every guild <br/>
has those),<br/>
&gt; &gt; they&#39;re all kewld00ds that don&#39;t give a shit about role-playing <br/>
(some are<br/>
&gt; &gt; some aren&#39;t, same as any other guild), they farm items to e-bay <br/>
them<br/>
&gt; &gt; (LAFFFF), and they own all dragons/planes. The funny thing is <br/>
none of that<br/>
&gt; &gt; is true, but people tend to belive whatever they read, and the <br/>
best form<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; publicity in an online game is word of mouth, so...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Usually, the Veeshan forum on eqvault is spammed and trolled with <br/>
flames<br/>
&gt; &gt; stating one or more of the above items, and the person gets shot <br/>
down,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but...they keep it coming.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know enough about them (being former-FoH myself) to know that <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; deserving of all of the flames, but it happens anyways.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;FoH?  Not familiar with them, but then again the people I <br/>
associate with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;definitely on the &#39;game&#39; end.  Who or what is FoH?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;That ranger is a character, not a player.  About 5 people played <br/>
it 24/7<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;get it to 60 that fast.  He&#39;s a member of FoH... need I say more?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;It&#39;s not a game... it&#39;s a business.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;At least to them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;heh<br/>
