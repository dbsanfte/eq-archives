<div id="ygrps-yiv-955612311">Helping a guy get his corpse - he fell off the cliff right outside of HH on<br/>
the EK side.  Was expecting a long run invis up that canyon but on a whim<br/>
told him to stand at the edge or the cliff and type /corpse.  Viola!  He<br/>
summoned it up some 500 feet!  Take advantage of that unlimited Z axis &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also, found that if you have your party target you and use /follow - then<br/>
invis and walk - not run - they stay with you pretty good and don&#39;t seem to<br/>
drop invis because they seem to stay closer.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to spend time with lower level chars who don&#39;t yet have their own<br/>
invis and see invis spells so anything to keep the group together helps.<br/>
