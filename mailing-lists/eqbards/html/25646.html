<br/>
I switched between 16 and 32 in the eqclient.ini, however, I can&#39;t attest to<br/>
any difference, that I noticed.<br/>

Don&#39;t bother buying 1.5GB of RAM unless you also upgrade from Win98SE to<br/>
Win2K or WinXP.  Win 95/98/ME will not run with more than 512MB.  IF you<br/>
do have more than 512MB, you have to add a line to your system.ini that<br/>
tells Windows to only use 512MB anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I found this out while considering how much RAM to use for SoL heh.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there was a message from Abashi that you needed to change color<br/>
depth to 32-bit with the new DX DLL.  Can you still use 16-bit?<br/>

There is hope.  From what I&#39;ve heard guildmates say, the immediate<br/>
solution<br/>
is RAM.  I will be upgrading immediately to 512 MB of RAM, and then<br/>
after<br/>
the holidays, will be running with three, 512 MB sticks.  It&#39;s cheap.<br/>
Approx February or March, I will be splurging for the GeForce 3.  At<br/>
that<br/>
time, I will do a test with EVERYTHING maxxed, and every option on.<br/>
Heh..it<br/>
better be perfect.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am also hoping that, as time goes on, Verant tweaks their EQ dx dll.<br/>
There is no reason for me to have to disable my hardware TnL.  I hope<br/>
they<br/>
fix that soon.<br/>
