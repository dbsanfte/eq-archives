&gt; Unfortunately, that&#39;s not the proper comparison to make.  The<br/>
&gt; number of people in your group will make a big difference in<br/>
&gt; the group&#39;s ability.  The biggest jump is going from 1 person<br/>
&gt; to 2 people (double the hp, double the damage output = killing<br/>
&gt; stuff twice as fast with half the downtime).  So when your<br/>
&gt; bard leaves, the drop in your group&#39;s effectiveness is not<br/>
&gt; just due to lack of a bard, it&#39;s also due to lack of a 4th<br/>
&gt; group member.<br/>
<br/>

her...  <br/>
<br/>
The only real basis of comparison is when the wizard isn;t there.  (The<br/>
party obviously loses huge amounts of effieciency without a real tank<br/>
and healer, ie the cleric and warrior).  I would say our xp is equal<br/>
with or without the wizard (we kill enough to equal the xp she takes),<br/>
but your explanation of how damage ratios change (and I&#39;ve been hearing<br/>
about that as long as I&#39;ve been here) kind of explains that.  Also we<br/>
struggle to add a good player when she leaves.  And even if they are a<br/>
good player, it takes time to adjust them to the way we play.  (We use<br/>
some unusal techniques at times, we like to experiement, my personal<br/>
favorite is tryiong to get extra mobs to agro on the wiz so she can run<br/>
around and root them)<br/>
<br/>
FYI, at lvl 20 a wizard cannot come close to a warrior in damage right<br/>
now.  The Langseax quest is easy for 2 lvl 20&#39;s (we did it with the<br/>
warrior and my bard for ease of travel and finding the bear, a druid<br/>
would make it even easier), so I put that as the non twinked lvl 20<br/>
warrior weapon.  In big fights (where the wizard blows out all her mana)<br/>
she keeps pace with him, but in the small fights, theres no comparison. <br/>
We were figuring out how many hp Broon had (we were bored while<br/>
medding).  In that fight (which we went total overkill for, since we<br/>
thought he was going to be much harder), the warrior did about 45%, the<br/>
wiz about 40% and the bard about 15%.  (Bard was singing anthem, hymm,<br/>
binding, and we gave the warrior credit for all his damage, some %<br/>
shoudl actually be given to the bard)  (Heh also, yes I have become a<br/>
true pansy cleric, I wear a blue and gray jumpsuit, and sit on my duff<br/>
for 90% of the combat)<br/>
