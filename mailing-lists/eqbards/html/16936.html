&gt; With certain pulls, the wizard will whack the second mob (usually the<br/>
&gt; hardest melee hitter, assuming at least one caster in the group) and<br/>
&gt; draw him away from the battle, I will then root him, saving me a good<br/>
&gt; deal of healing mana.  We have never had a death doing this, even when<br/>
&gt; we get multiple resists.  At higher levels this may not be as viable<br/>
&gt; (since the wiz has to take a round or two of beatings), but for now its<br/>
&gt; great.  <br/>

I&#39;m trying to cajole the people I group with to use it more<br/>
instead of relying on my Pixie Strike because of the broken<br/>
second resist rate.<br/>
<br/>
For something even more effective, have the cleric take one of<br/>
the mobs in the direction it came from out of aggro range.  <br/>
Then root it, then atone (memblur) it.  When the root expires,<br/>
that mob will (usually) happily go back to its spawn point.<br/>
