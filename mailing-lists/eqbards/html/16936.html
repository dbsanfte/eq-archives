I&#39;m trying to cajole the people I group with to use it more<br/>
instead of relying on my Pixie Strike because of the broken<br/>
second resist rate.<br/>
<br/>
For something even more effective, have the cleric take one of<br/>
the mobs in the direction it came from out of aggro range.  <br/>
Then root it, then atone (memblur) it.  When the root expires,<br/>
that mob will (usually) happily go back to its spawn point.<br/>
