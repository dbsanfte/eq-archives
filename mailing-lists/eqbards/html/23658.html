 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t disagree with you... we&#39;re fantastic at filling in the gaps, but I <br/>
find that I&#39;ve been in &quot;well-balanced&quot; groups a lot more often. Perhaps it&#39;s <br/>
just me, but we seem to never lack for a tank of some sort, meaning I rarely <br/>
have to go up there and become the meat shield. I&#39;m not saying this never <br/>
happens, but as you put it, it&#39;s occasional. Thus, I can&#39;t consider this my <br/>
main job... My main job is making that tank better at what he does. No <br/>
enchanter? Of course I handle crowd-control, however, that&#39;s not my main job <br/>
either. When we do have an enchanter (and lately, I&#39;ve been grouping with <br/>
enchanters more and more - perhaps they&#39;re more readily available at higher <br/>
levels?) I can make his job a lot easier by coordinating with him/her, and I <br/>
feel I can make that enchanter a much better one.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think that the bard tends to &quot;fade away&quot; in large raids... <br/>
Perhaps it depends what you&#39;re raiding, but off the top of my head, our MR <br/>
songs alone are indispensible. Even in a group with two tanks, an enchanter, <br/>
a cleric, and a &lt;fill in the blank here&gt;, a bard is a welcome addition due <br/>
to our many talents. True, there are no deficient spots to fill, but those <br/>
members of the group are now much more efficient with a bard along, as is <br/>
the group as a whole. We&#39;re able to pull quicker, have less down-time, and <br/>
kill quicker than that same group would have been able to without the added <br/>
bard.<br/>

&gt;At 10:43 PM 1/30/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;I&#39;ll leave the serious damage dealing to the<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Wow, great line! Mind if I quote you on that the next time I&#39;m having <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt; &gt;argument with someone? ;) I&#39;ve always felt the same way you do - my main<br/>
&gt; &gt;job, as a bard, is to make everyone better at their jobs. Yes, perhaps my<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i see my main job as a bard as filling in the gaps, which is a little <br/>
&gt;different from<br/>
&gt;making everyone better at their jobs.  occasionally you will be in groups <br/>
&gt;without<br/>
&gt;real damage dealers and you will have to step in and deal that damage.  <br/>
&gt;this is<br/>
&gt;why the bard is so powerful in an unbalanced group (i.e. missing certain <br/>
&gt;components)<br/>
&gt;as compared to balanced groups.  also why the bard seems to fade away in <br/>
&gt;big<br/>
&gt;raids (regardless of ubermob or not) because most big raids are by <br/>
&gt;definition, balanced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;value in a group isn&#39;t as apparent as the wizards&#39;s after he blasts a<br/>
&gt; &gt;beastie for 500 damage, or the cleric&#39;s after he heals someone for 500 <br/>
&gt;hit<br/>
&gt; &gt;points... but I feel that what I add to the group, is, in some cases,<br/>
&gt; &gt;invaluable.<br/>
