<div id="ygrps-yiv-934024161">I use it fairly often, but charm works very well too.  I use chains/fear to<br/>
eliminate my pet after he is victorious though.  <br/>

Big warning!  The first time a 2nd mob that is SoW&#39;d gets feared you may<br/>
wish you never tried this!  I had this happen in Lake of Ill Omen and the<br/>
carnage was spectacular.  I figure at least 10 characters were slain before<br/>
the goblins stopped pouring out of the mines.  All from one additional mob<br/>
fleeing down the cave mouth because I ran by with fear.  Do not attempt this<br/>
on Giants in Frontier.  They will flee right by the castle wall and your AoE<br/>
fear may hit a giant on the other side.  If it does, just be a gentleman and<br/>
wave bye-bye to your corpse during the Loading Please Wait message.<br/>
<br/>
Still this is an awesome tactic that is one of the few that is even more<br/>
effective when two bards are working together.<br/>
