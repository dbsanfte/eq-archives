<div id="ygrps-yiv-36029818">Hmm, where are you when you are fighting blues/whites surrounded by greens?´┐¢<br/>
<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
I use Lullaby primarily as tool for crowd control -- situations where you<br/>
have more agro mobs than you want to deal with at one time.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Derv camps and HH Orcs come to mind.´┐¢ Either a bad pull brings 3 or 4 dervs<br/>
and you wanted only 1.´┐¢ Or all of a sudden you have 4 or 5 orcs spawned and<br/>
were expecting 1 maybe 2.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
If the party is big enough, i&#39;ll equip my mandolin and play the Lullaby and<br/>
then try to get the party to assist off one of the tanks.´┐¢ The other mobs<br/>
will nod fairly well while waiting their turn to die.´┐¢ Otherwise I will just<br/>
sing it and assist on the tank and hope they keep nodding.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
As you know - anything that nods will wake up agro on you.´┐¢ At the outdoor<br/>
derv camps, this can be passing kodis, snakes, etc.´┐¢ Sometimes the party can<br/>
even take a break and heal a bit between kills if needed.<br/>
´┐¢<br/>
Depending upon where you are fighting blue/whites in a field of greens,<br/>
either clean the trash out first or use Lament on the blues/greens, bellow<br/>
on the white and pull them outside of the green trash agro range.<br/>

´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ I would love to have some better examples of how to use Lullaby<br/>
effectively.´┐¢ ´┐¢ Here is my situation:´┐¢ I generally am fighting<br/>
whites/blues/yellows, but they ´┐¢ are usually surrounded by greens that<br/>
ignore me.´┐¢ If I lullaby the greens will´┐¢ stop ignoring me or my group and<br/>
then there will be trouble as the greens ´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ generally outnumber the ones<br/>
we fight two to one!´┐¢ Should I not worry about ´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ this?´┐¢ Will the greens<br/>
resist so infrequently that they won&#39;t matter in the ´┐¢´┐¢´┐¢ fight?´┐¢ Any<br/>
suggestions along these lines would be appreciated as I&#39;d like to ´┐¢ see<br/>
Lullaby becaome as useful as the rest of my songs.<br/>
