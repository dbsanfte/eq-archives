&gt; The problem is that this doesn&#39;t really scale.  They recently<br/>
&gt; halved the speed of Verses of Victory (L50 song), and from<br/>
&gt; reports I&#39;m seeing it&#39;s gone from a 45% speedup (same as<br/>
&gt; enchanter&#39;s L49 Swift) to about a 23% speedup.  A typical L50<br/>
&gt; enchanter (say 170 int) will use a bit more than half his mana<br/>
&gt; to cast Swift like the Wind (250 mana) on 5 party members,<br/>
&gt; plus has Clarity to help him recover from it faster.  The<br/>
&gt; situation was nowhere near as unbalanced as it was with the<br/>
&gt; Anthem/Quickness comparison.  In fact, a L50 enchanter could<br/>
&gt; cast Alacrity (25% speedup, 115 mana) on 5 party members for<br/>
&gt; about a bubble and half of mana, and that would be *faster*<br/>
&gt; than our nerfed Verses.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This also ignores the fact that in a typical party the enchanter is<br/>
highly unlikely to cast a speedup spell on 5 party members. Typically,<br/>
in my experience with high level parties, it&#39;s more like 2 members.<br/>
Bards songs, while affecting all 5, are not really that useful on a<br/>
cleric or druid, for example, with their one handed weapons and no<br/>
double attack.<br/>
