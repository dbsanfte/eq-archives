&gt; Point of all this: If lullaby -does- nix the shit list, why did it go after<br/>
&gt; the mage?  Obviously the mage had done a great deal of damage to it, so it<br/>
&gt; really hated him.  But a nix is a nix, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The AI is smart enough to go after an easy kill first.  If<br/>
someone is almost dead, it is nearly if not entirely<br/>
impossible to pull a mob off them.  I&#39;ve seen lulled mobs go<br/>
after nearly dead players when they activate, despite all the<br/>
singing, healing (of the nearly dead player), and backstabbing<br/>
we&#39;re doing to it to pull it off the nearly dead player.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious how far away the mage was.<br/>
