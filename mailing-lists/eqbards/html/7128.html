<div id="ygrps-yiv-814682053">I&#39;m sorry, you must be looking for the EQ Vault, it&#39;s<br/>
down the hall and to the right.  I don&#39;t even care<br/>
about the topic for the most part, but you Wayne, have<br/>
marked yourself to me.  From here on out every thing<br/>
you post I will question, as in your response you<br/>
displayed the debating skill of a twelve year old<br/>
trying to impress the older kids.  I&#39;m very<br/>
dissapointed that such a post ever came to our board. <br/>
At least it&#39;s the 95% that are kind, courteous, and<br/>
intellegent.  I suppose we will always have to deal<br/>
with the 5% out there.<br/>
