&gt;Couldn&#39;t a bard guide just give himself a pair of Selo&#39;s drums?  Dunno what<br/>
&gt;guides can and can&#39;t do, but I imagine they can give themselves whatever<br/>
&gt;equipment...??<br/>

&gt;If you had a choice, based on looks and class restrictions alone, what would<br/>
&gt;you dress in?  Lambent, Singing Steel, or Imbrued?  Or something else?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d probably stick with lambent.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I toyed with the idea of becoming a Bard guide - but when I reviewed what <br/>
Guides could and couldn&#39;t do, I decided to create myself as a Paladin <br/>
instead.  Lay on Hands was VERY handy as a Guide (I could rez, AND fix up <br/>
the recently rez&#39;d player instantly).<br/>
<br/>
Guides cannot &quot;give&quot; themselves anything, however. In fact, when a new <br/>
guide first starts his/her apprenticeship, they&#39;re given a Staff of <br/>
Guidance (effect: Gate) and that&#39;s it.  Once elevated to full Guide status, <br/>
Guides can get armour and equipment off of the vendors in CS Home, but <br/>
they&#39;re limited to 3 colours of armour, and cloth for monk-guides.<br/>
<br/>
I have, however SEEN a Bard guide - but since you can&#39;t buy spells or songs <br/>
from real vendors, a bard guide wouldn&#39;t be able to use his special <br/>
stuff.  That&#39;s why guides are given tools of the trade.<br/>
