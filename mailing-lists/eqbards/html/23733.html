<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660425817">I&#39;ve considered it my job almost to try and let the rest of the group escape<br/>
if possible. I always have Screech memed for that purpose and to clear any<br/>
mob beating on the evac&#39;er. My group hasn&#39;t always been pleased but my<br/>
philosophy has always been it&#39;s easier to get one corpse than everyone&#39;s<br/>
corpse. Much like our monk, who takes deaths rather than bring too many back<br/>
to the group and kill everyone, it&#39;s tactics. Overall time lost getting<br/>
corpses costs everyone experience. And then sometimes it works: we were in a<br/>
raid on The Hole, pulls for the whole raid went really bad, pullers yelled<br/>
evac and died. We were getting hammered from all sides and I started<br/>
Screech. The wiz asks if he should evac about the time my screen scrool at<br/>
least twice maybe 3 times with Fear wearing off messages. We evac&#39;ed and<br/>
were ready to help the rest with CR. Of course many times I&#39;ve started<br/>
Screech only to have everything turn and pound me into the dirt in a blink.<br/>
Maybe with higher defensive I&#39;ll live long enough to make more stuff madder.<br/>
