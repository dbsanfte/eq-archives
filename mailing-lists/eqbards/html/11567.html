<b>Subject:</b> Reading spell data <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128997536">Thanks to all you guys trying to make sense of the new songs from the<br/>
data file. help us to try to understand what is going on, but I just<br/>
wanted to point out what GZ said about the procedure.<br/>
<br/>
From Archmage answers:<br/>
Q: Why is [X] spell worse then [Y] spell? I used [insert name of program<br/>
that strips spell information here], and... <br/>
A: OK - STOP. All of those nifty programs that supposedly strip out the<br/>
information for our spell are nice for reading what class can cast the<br/>
spell, or the text that the spell displays when it is cast - but then<br/>
again, a good website can tell you that. I&#39;ve checked out a lot of those<br/>
programs, and I have yet to see one that ACCURATELY tells the effects of<br/>
a spell. At this point, I would trust information from websites more<br/>
then I would from one of these programs. The information from webistes<br/>
usually comes from players who have gotten the data first hand. <br/>
