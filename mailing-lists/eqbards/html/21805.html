complicated. They wield weapons but aren&#39;t that great at them. They have <br/>
songs instead of spells that require no mana. It requires someone who <br/>
studies them to really understand how to play them effectively.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I&#39;m running around and run across another bard (very rarely <br/>
happens) I almost always send them a tell of some sort. When I see one <br/>
fighting nearby, I see what they sing and compliment them if they show a <br/>
good understanding. (of course, that&#39;s kind of arrogant since that means I <br/>
believe myself to know what&#39;s good).<br/>

&gt;bought a loaf of bread that was stale and the grocery store told you &quot;sorry,<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s just the way that bread is&quot;.  Verant does the equivalent to their<br/>
&gt;customers every day.  The guild doesn&#39;t dislike EQ, but they would never<br/>
&gt;invest the time they put into it in another Verant game.  We have been<br/>
&gt;gradually losing members over this for some time now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well Verant definitely doesn&#39;t fall into the Nordstrom customer service <br/>
realm. But I wouldn&#39;t say their customer service is horrible. Can we &quot;agree <br/>
to disagree? :-)<br/>
<br/>
They do address bard issues when it&#39;s a high priority. Remember when our <br/>
weapons weren&#39;t proc&#39;ing anymore after one of their patches? They fixed <br/>
that within a day I think. I do think that bards overall are lower on their <br/>
list of priorities since they will support the majority of players who are <br/>
playing more of the popular classes.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if they upped the monthly fee all around that we could get better <br/>
customer service (as staffing is the largest expense in any company). But <br/>
I&#39;m sure their marketing research has shown that they can get the most <br/>
number of people to play for $10/month and to go above that would lose them <br/>
many more people than they would with their current customer service. I <br/>
know I wouldn&#39;t play if it were $20/month. I&#39;d think you&#39;d have to be <br/>
absolutely nuts to want to pay $49.95/month. What was that all about? :-P<br/>
