&gt; I took all the posts about it from here and sent them to the party members,<br/>
&gt; who kind of pegged me as being pessimistic on the issue *laughs*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But it was worth it all, I got to see a Will Sapper and a Soul Seductress,<br/>
&gt; and I think Ms. Soul was kinda sweet on me...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The character of Mistmoore depends a large part on what the<br/>
other people in there are doing.  Sometimes everyone is good<br/>
about keeping fights localized in their area and announcing<br/>
trains.  I&#39;ve made nearly a level in a night playing in<br/>
Mistmoore under these circumstances, and the action was<br/>
nonstop.<br/>
<br/>
Other times one or more groups are really rude and pull stuff<br/>
deep from the castle to the zone or don&#39;t announce their<br/>
constant trains.  I&#39;ve fought one familiar, then spent the<br/>
next half hour keeping my group invisible waiting for the<br/>
train to dissipate, kill another familiar, spend another half<br/>
hour waiting for another train to leave, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re clearing out yard trash, there is absolutely no<br/>
reason you should ever see the Will Sapper and Soul<br/>
Seductress.  There are several spots near the zone that are<br/>
out of the path of trains.  Find them and work from there.  If<br/>
the trains are just too frequent, then there are some idiots<br/>
in the zone - leave and try again another night.<br/>
