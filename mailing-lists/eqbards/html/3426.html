<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974563066">Uhh, remember the endless thread about a new term for &quot;twisting&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was kicked off by J.M. who plays a bard and is on dev team at<br/>
Verant.  He said he hates the term but that the technique is an important<br/>
one for bards.<br/>
<br/>
So, rest assured that it is there for those of us to use as we see fit.<br/>

		I know that most bards do twist, and I do not hold this<br/>
against you in any<br/>
		ways, but are you wanting me to believe that the game was<br/>
designed to do<br/>
		this?  I don&#39;t believe it was, I think the reasons the songs<br/>
don&#39;t stop<br/>
		immediately is so that if you get bashed or stunned, that<br/>
you can restart<br/>
		the song without losing the effect of whichever song you<br/>
were playing.  <br/>
<br/>
		This is just my 2cp.<br/>
