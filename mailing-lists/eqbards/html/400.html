<div id="ygrps-yiv-31594680">Hello all, I am new to this Bard list and I must say I am really enjoying<br/>
this. Everyone seems to really want to help each other and give good sound<br/>
advice based on actual experience. I am also a Lev 9 Half-Elf Bard. I love<br/>
to solo. Soloing in or around Splitpaw I went from lev 5 to lev 9 in 2 days.<br/>
I then started grouping with no more than 2 others and was still getting<br/>
good exp. I am nearly lev 10.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great rest of the weekend.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Your concerns really struck a nerve with me and I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; like to share some of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; observations about life as a bard.  As mentioned in<br/>
&gt; &gt; previous reply, we<br/>
&gt; &gt; bards are actually very good soloists.  When things<br/>
&gt; &gt; get hairy, we have the<br/>
&gt; &gt; accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; the situation you<br/>
&gt; &gt; described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d hit accellerando at<br/>
&gt; &gt; about 3 bars of health.  This is because you slow<br/>
&gt; &gt; down below 2 bars and you<br/>
&gt; &gt; may need that extra bar to get some distance between<br/>
&gt; &gt; you and the orcs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Always have accellerando hot-keyed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Second, lament is a great spell but it can, as you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have learned, fail.<br/>
&gt; &gt; However, the lower the level of creature is compared<br/>
&gt; &gt; to you, the more likely<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is to succeed.  Never use it on a white or higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; con.  It will fail way<br/>
&gt; &gt; too often.  But, if they all con green or a low<br/>
&gt; &gt; blue, you could solo a camp<br/>
&gt; &gt; and clean it out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Third, our greatest power is in grouping, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; grouping is risky.  It is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; high-trust situation.  Be very careful who you group<br/>
&gt; &gt; with and guage how well<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can trust them.  I might group with a group like<br/>
&gt; &gt; you had described, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would not trust them to save my butt if I got in<br/>
&gt; &gt; trouble and at the first<br/>
&gt; &gt; sign of trouble, I&#39;d run.  Only when they have shown<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they can be<br/>
&gt; &gt; counted on to keep me alive when the going got rough<br/>
&gt; &gt; would I let myself get<br/>
&gt; &gt; low in health.  I die more frequently in a group<br/>
&gt; &gt; then solo because I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; still too trusting and eager to jump into danger to<br/>
&gt; &gt; save someone whose<br/>
&gt; &gt; stupidity got them into trouble... usually failing<br/>
&gt; &gt; and dieing along side of<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Be up front with them about this though.  Make sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; they understand that<br/>
&gt; &gt; since you don&#39;t know them well, and your life is<br/>
&gt; &gt; dear to you, you will do<br/>
&gt; &gt; what you have to to protect it until some trust and<br/>
&gt; &gt; teamwork has developed.<br/>
