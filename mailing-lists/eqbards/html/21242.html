You&#39;re right I should have given a response. The problems with eta&#39;s are I<br/>
get flamed if we don&#39;t meet them.<br/>
Most of you have been paitent and curteous (sp??) and I HATE to disappoint.<br/>
No we did not have any converstaions about bards today. I spent 90% of my<br/>
day going over some new content so it goes in correctly. Now before I get<br/>
the &#39;why are you putting in new content before the old stuff is fixed&#39; let<br/>
me share with you that the people who are putting in new content are NOT the<br/>
ones who are fixing the old stuff (usually).<br/>
<br/>
However I get to test all of it. I have a wonderful group of testers who<br/>
work VERY hard. This is the project we have been working on for almost two<br/>
weeks now and there is an end in sight. Next are Bards (not just lulaby) and<br/>
then the iksar quests.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon asked me today about bards. I told him I was overworked and I&#39;ll get<br/>
to it. Guys please bear with me.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like a broken record here. I don&#39;t repost because I have nothing new<br/>
to say. I&#39;m not looking for any &#39;poor ester is overworked&#39; nonsence, it&#39;s my<br/>
job, I LOVE my job, but I can&#39;t do everything at once.<br/>
<br/>
GZ is at my disposal as soon as I have things to bring him. He tells me that<br/>
every time he sees me in the hallway.<br/>
<br/>
You guys are not nags. You are not whining (well the ones I actually listen<br/>
to are not) and I think you have some valid concerns. I have never played a<br/>
bard so I have a learning curve here and it is going to take a bit for me to<br/>
overcome that.<br/>
<br/>
On another note to a VERY long post, the but with the disapeparing text<br/>
buffer (which is one I want fixed!!) are you guys getting it a lot? I am<br/>
going to post it&#39;s own thread, but we are seeing it mostly with bards...<br/>
/sigh<br/>
<br/>
Please know that I am not ignorning or blowing anyone&#39;s issues off. These<br/>
things take more time than I realized.</div>
