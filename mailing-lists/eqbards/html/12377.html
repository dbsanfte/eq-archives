<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128158265">You know now that I think back on it, I remember thinking it was weird at<br/>
the time because I got the message about becoming visible.  It could have<br/>
been some sort of glitch graphics-wise and he wasn&#39;t where he appeared to<br/>
be.  We have used Selo&#39;s in conjunction with Clouding but since we were<br/>
moving I&#39;m not sure if the other bard playing Selo&#39;s was ever spotted.<br/>
Everything I conned was indifferent though.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that if you loot while playing the invis song you appear for<br/>
one pulse and then can loot your corpse while invisible the rest of the way.<br/>
This is quite handy when you are not sure you will have time to fully loot<br/>
your corpse, but know you have a few seconds of safety.<br/>

Are you sure?  You become visible when you start a new song,<br/>
so you can&#39;t weave Hymn and invis and stay invisible.<br/>
<br/>
Dunno about the other case (two bards in party, singing Hymn<br/>
and invis).  I never tested that.<br/>
