<div id="ygrps-yiv-299305243">Roughly the way exp has always been explained to me and appears to function<br/>
like this at all levels.<br/>
<br/>
If a level 20 25 and 29 players are all grouped and they kill a mob.  Each<br/>
of them gets the same percentage of exp needed for their level.  That means<br/>
that if the mob gives the level 29 player 2% of the total exp needed to<br/>
gain level 30.  It will also give the level 20 player 2% of the exp that he<br/>
or she needs to gain level 21. (I&#39;m talking total exp for the level not<br/>
what you still need left to make the next level)<br/>
Every time I go out adventuring.  No matter what group I am in and what the<br/>
levels are.  If I gain a bubbel of exp for say an hour of play.  Everyone<br/>
else in the group  appears to have also gained one bubbel of exp.<br/>
Reguardless of race or class.  Now I am sure there are probably penalties<br/>
to some classes that could cause this to be inaccurate.  However, they have<br/>
never been very noticible.<br/>
I believe Verant designed the exp system so that if say a group of 6<br/>
players reguardless of class and race always grouped and Never adventured<br/>
with out all the other members of the group.  They would all level FAIRLY<br/>
but not exactly all the way to level 50.  The same principle can be applied<br/>
when dealing with a mixed group.  Eveeryone is going to level about the<br/>
same rate.<br/>
The reason it appears as though lower level people don&#39;t get as much exp is<br/>
that the higher level players require a larger percentage of exp to get<br/>
them to the next level.  So if the group is killing blue things.  The<br/>
highest level person will suck up more exp because the system is leveling<br/>
them roughly the same rate.<br/>
<br/>
Just a not about this post.  I know that there are rumors from some guides<br/>
and beta testers as well as other players that say certain mobs give<br/>
certain classes more exp.  As well as the one that says some classes have<br/>
more penalties than others depending on the zone they are in.  Thats why in<br/>
my above comments I used the words fairly and roughly.  I&#39;m not looking for<br/>
flames, Just though you might care to hear the point of view from soneone<br/>
who has plaied with groups well above me and well below me for a total of<br/>
68 levels worth of characters.  Ones almost 30, most in their teens.<br/>

&gt;&gt; My first night as level 20 and I went<br/>
&gt;&gt; to HighHold Keep.  Got into a group with<br/>
&gt;&gt; others ranging to 27 with me the lowest<br/>
&gt;&gt; most of the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but with a group of people that high up in level<br/>
&gt;(up to 7 above you), isn&#39;t it true that you&#39;d get very little to no<br/>
&gt;experience from the fights? I remember when I was level 5 and my friend was<br/>
&gt;level 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting experience when we were<br/>
&gt;grouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that even when the<br/>
&gt;levels are closer, the people with the higher levels get more experience<br/>
&gt;than the lower levels regardless of who does the most damage. Of course if<br/>
&gt;you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I was just curious<br/>
&gt;if you got any experience from it.<br/>
