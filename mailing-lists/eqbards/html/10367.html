<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157365602">For the past week, I have been camping for the Icy Greaves.  Last night -=PRESTO!=- they dropped from 2, yes 2 consecutive Elites.  Where was I?  I had just been killed by them and their kin. :o/  I load Selo&#39;s and begin running full speed back to Perma from Halas in an attempt to get there before the xorpses disappear.  No luck.  I get back, and the only Elite corpse left is the one with just the Skin on it.  While zipping through Perma though, I inadvertantly brought some &quot;friends&quot; with me.  My group was able to handle them easily, but they found hitting my naked body quite the fun event... death number two.<br/>
    As I am re-mem&#39;ing my songs for yet ANOTHER run to Perma, a guy in our group gets a cleric buddy to come rez me.  Joy!  The only catch is that I give up my turn for Icy Greaves to him.  I decided that was a good deal, seeing as how I was the only one after them, and agreed.  Sure enough, a little while later 1, yes 1 and ONLY 1 pair dropped. :o/  As I was leaving to sell.bank then log for the evening, the perfect ending to a perfect night happens... I got stuck in the (*%$#&&#39;n gate :o/<br/>
    This week hasn;t been a TOTAL loss though, I have managed to come out ahead (somehow) on exp, I got a Crystalline Blade off of the gobbie Champion (11 Dmg, 38 Dly, 1H Slash), Zaraman (sp?) Coronet, Symbol of Loyalty, and the Frost Totem.  Mebbe I&#39;ll get the cape the king drops next ;o)~<br/>
