<b>Subject:</b> SBLive crashes (was Powerleveling doesnt mean L50 + rant) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042450066">I have a SBLive and haven&#39;t run into any problems yet (knock on wood).  To<br/>
be on the safe side, yesterday I downloaded the most recent drivers from the<br/>
Creative website and installed them.  I was shocked when I logged in.  Prior<br/>
to installing the updated drivers, the sound in EQ was pretty good.  After<br/>
installing the new drivers, it got even better.  The Environmental Audio<br/>
support improved dramatically.  I started hearing sound effects that I<br/>
didn&#39;t even know were in the game.  The most recent SBLive driver is from<br/>
Nov 99 so if you don&#39;t have it download it and give it a try.<br/>
