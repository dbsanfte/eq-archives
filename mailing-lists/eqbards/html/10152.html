<b>Subject:</b> Song Combo for 21st Level <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508308916">Hello,<br/>
First, I solo most of the time and havent used a weapon (except to keep up<br/>
skill and kill the occasional caster) since getting Denon&#39;s Discord.  I use<br/>
to twist CoD/DDD/Bellow, but my current level (21st), I find the combo of<br/>
CoD/DDD/Largo&#39;s Binding leaves me a lot more health at the end of a battle.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a better solo song combination (at my level) that I might be<br/>
missing?  I do kinda like the stares of people standing around as I switch<br/>
instruments saying, &quot;That is VERY different way to fight, my friend!  Your<br/>
singing must be extremely bad to hurt so many, so much!...grin&quot;<br/>
<br/>
PS  I&#39;m looking for a good guild on Innorouk for a casual gamer.  I am<br/>
kinda tired of the solo lifestyle.  I define good as FUN, BTW...;)<br/>
<br/>
