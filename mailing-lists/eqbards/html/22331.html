<div id="ygrps-yiv-396988719">Divine Aura keeps any spell (or song) from hitting the cleric, this includes<br/>
Selo&#39;s.<br/>

I&#39;ve always been told if you have a monk feign pulling, don&#39;t sing during<br/>
the pull.  I have no evidence to support this practice as the only times I<br/>
group with a monk is on big raids (where you dont want to sing on the pull<br/>
anyway).<br/>
<br/>
I good song to keep mobs off healers/enchanters is Melodic Binding.<br/>
Assuming you dont have a shaman slowing, this songs is great.  Its slows and<br/>
ac-debuffs the Mob, doesn&#39;t break mez, and taunts them onto you.  While we<br/>
aren&#39;t tanks, its hella better for the extra mobs to be beating on you then<br/>
the enchanter or cleric.  OUr guild&#39;s main enchanter (who I am often in<br/>
communication with on guild raids) estimates this song moakes her about 25%<br/>
more effective at mezzing mobs.  Mostly because she doesn&#39;t have to stun<br/>
before mezzing and if things go badly (multiple resists/lag usually) she is<br/>
in much less danger of dying (and to be honest if things go bad, I&#39;d rather<br/>
just me dies then multiple deaths including the cleric, if just I die, as<br/>
soon as the fights over, rezz, mana song, and the loss is minimal).  Also<br/>
from a cleric&#39;s perspective (my secondary is cleric), in a group without en<br/>
anchanter, when I drop my greater heal (lvl 30 group) I WILL agro at least<br/>
one mob on me.  No biggie, stun, root, med. (Actually since we are the same<br/>
group every time we play, the wizard and I trust each other enough to root<br/>
each others mobs)  BUT, if our bard is their, sining binding, I rarely get<br/>
an agro, and if I do, I just stand next to her for a pulse or two, then back<br/>
off.  Much more effecient, and there nothing worse for a cleric than seeing<br/>
a teamate go down, while a mob is interupting your heals.<br/>
<br/>
From both my perspectives, I say a good bard is an enchanters or cleric&#39;s<br/>
second best friend (a good puller is first)</div>
