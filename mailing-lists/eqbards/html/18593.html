&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Adventures with Fear<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well as hoped I reached my 26th song last Thursday evening and quickly<br/>
&gt; scribed it.  I was in a group at the time so didn&#39;t get to try out the<br/>
&gt; Fear/Chains tricks that evening.  However we got hit by a <br/>
&gt; huge train by an<br/>
&gt; ogre running out of the goblin mines and everyone was sure we <br/>
&gt; were going to<br/>
&gt; die.  The Zone call was made, so I strummed up Screech and crossed my<br/>
&gt; fingers.  Every single goblin fled.  The party seeing this <br/>
&gt; decided to try<br/>
&gt; and pick them off as they came back.  With our druid and <br/>
&gt; ranger snaring them<br/>
&gt; and me playing Denon&#39;s, Hymn, and Screech, we were able to <br/>
&gt; kill off a 14<br/>
&gt; goblin train 2 at a time.  It was glorious!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Friday nite I got a chance to try it out soloing while I <br/>
&gt; waited for other<br/>
&gt; guild members to show up.  All the tricks I was given worked <br/>
&gt; excellently!<br/>
&gt; Kudos to all those who gave pointers.  Using Chains and Screech was<br/>
&gt; ridiculously effective.  If I accidentally got extra mobs it <br/>
&gt; never mattered,<br/>
&gt; they just ran away every time I feared and along the same <br/>
&gt; path as the mob I<br/>
&gt; was Chaining, so it was like keeping a steady stream of <br/>
&gt; victims &#39;on the<br/>
&gt; leash&#39;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was emboldened by my success and decided to try a different <br/>
&gt; theme on the<br/>
&gt; whole Screech tactic.  An all instrument Screech version.  <br/>
&gt; Try this if you<br/>
&gt; dare!  I ran into the middle of the haunted tower in the Lake <br/>
&gt; of Ill Omen,<br/>
&gt; you know the one with the Icebone, Charbone, and Warbone <br/>
&gt; skeletons.  I then<br/>
&gt; fired up Denon&#39;s with my horn nailing all five skeletons (All <br/>
&gt; blue to me).<br/>
&gt; I then twisted in Fear and Hymn switching to Mandolin for <br/>
&gt; Hymn.  From the<br/>
&gt; comments of the 5 or 6 passerby it must have been quite <br/>
&gt; hilarious.  The<br/>
&gt; Screech would send the skeletons (mostly DoT&#39;d) running from <br/>
&gt; the tower.  I<br/>
&gt; would heal with Hymn.  They would run back in, get a dose of <br/>
&gt; Denon&#39;s, a<br/>
&gt; quick Screech, and then run back out.  After several minutes <br/>
&gt; of this they<br/>
&gt; all lay dead around me and I never lost more than a bubble of <br/>
&gt; health to<br/>
&gt; resisters or when pulsing Denon&#39;s.  I still can&#39;t believe I <br/>
&gt; was able to solo<br/>
&gt; 5 blues that in melee would each do 3-4 bubs to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Needless to say the tactics were a huge success, thanks all <br/>
&gt; again!  I&#39;m very<br/>
&gt; glad I was in an optimistic mood on Friday and downloaded the <br/>
&gt; Solon&#39;s tricks<br/>
&gt; from Rokenn&#39;s Song Analysis site.  I made 27th on Saturday nite and by<br/>
&gt; Sunday evening I had practiced on newbie mobs and was happily <br/>
&gt; soloing duos<br/>
&gt; and trios of white/blues using Sirens.  I can&#39;t wait to get <br/>
&gt; back to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I learned a couple of important things about Siren&#39;s in Lake <br/>
&gt; of Ill Omen.<br/>
&gt; Do not try to charm the renegade Iksar.  I could not even charm Iksar<br/>
&gt; bandits (probably about 15 levels below me).  I got 10 <br/>
&gt; resists in a row on<br/>
&gt; an Iksar bandit and gave up.  I had previously tried an Iksar <br/>
&gt; brigand and<br/>
&gt; gotten 10 resists in a row on that mob as well.  Sabertooths <br/>
&gt; seem quite<br/>
&gt; susceptible to charm.  A sabertooth grimalkin is quite <br/>
&gt; capable of killing 3<br/>
&gt; blues before you need a new pet and seldom resisted my Sirens <br/>
&gt; attempts even<br/>
&gt; with battle gear on (93 cha).  Warbones skels, although <br/>
&gt; easier to melee solo<br/>
&gt; than Iksar Exiles, can strangely beat those same Exiles when <br/>
&gt; used as a pet.<br/>
&gt; My blue Sabertooth Grimalkin pet was even able to beat a <br/>
&gt; white/black Iksar<br/>
&gt; Exile and only lost about half its health.  Those Grimalkins hit hard!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for all the suggestions!<br/>
