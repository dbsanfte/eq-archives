<div id="ygrps-yiv-950085134">Try to save a few each level for Instill Doubt at 26th, that&#39;s a slow slow<br/>
skill to develop by use (And comes at the wrong level, imho, since the 26th<br/>
level song is a fear song).<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, there&#39;s sneak and hide to consider.  Since hide is capped<br/>
at 40, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about that one, as 40 skill is not enough<br/>
to make hide reliable.  Sneak still has a lot of uses, and from a recovering<br/>
ex-rogue&#39;s standpoint, I think it&#39;s worth training and practicing in.<br/>
<br/>
Dual wield starts at 34, and you don&#39;t even need to spend a point in it.<br/>
Just make 17th, log off, come back in, and you&#39;re dual wield ready.  This is<br/>
not a bug.  Back in beta, bards initially didn&#39;t have dual wield skill, it<br/>
was a phase 3 addition to make the class a little more potent.  When they<br/>
made that change, there were no bard trainers with Dual Wield.  So they made<br/>
it a &#39;gimme&#39; skill, with a decent starting amount, letting normal combat<br/>
take care of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Safe fall is capped at 40, and you can max it out in about 10 minutes of<br/>
jumping.  Tracking is capped low as well, that first point you put into it<br/>
at 35th level pretty much maxes it out.  Locks and Traps skills aren&#39;t that<br/>
useful either.<br/>
<br/>
So what you end up with is a bard with a lot of surplus training points.  I<br/>
put all I could into smithing, as bards make one of the best smiths (STR and<br/>
DEX are key stats for smiths, and if you smith while singing Chant of Battle<br/>
and playing your drum, you have much better stats there than most<br/>
un-augmented races).<br/>
<br/>
I sunk quite a few into the various languages, because a long while back,<br/>
Geoffrey Zatkin said that singing a song in the language of the target was<br/>
likely to make more effective, via fewer resists.  This hasn&#39;t come about<br/>
yet, but GZ isn&#39;t done tuning, it&#39;s still a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s a lot of fun to be able to talk in Ogre or Froglok or Faerie.<br/>
Plus, magicians will love you for it, they&#39;re in desperate need of language<br/>
tutors, so they can research spells.<br/>

&gt;Having just reached the 12th circle (and loving Bellow), I was<br/>
&gt;wondering what people do with all their skill points.  I have<br/>
&gt;9 available at the moment, I think, and I have trained at least a<br/>
&gt;point in everything I can use at my level, including a couple of<br/>
&gt;languages, baking and tailoring.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, what do I do with the other skill points?  Is there some high<br/>
&gt;level skill that I should start saving for now?<br/>
