&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This also happened with the armor merchant in East<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport - he was indifferent even with Carillon<br/>
&gt; &gt; until i walked AROUND the his counter and stood in<br/>
&gt; &gt; front of him. Amiable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there any possibility that maybe the reason was because you did the song<br/>
&gt; multiple times? Just curious. Something worth testing..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I played with this a bit.  Turns out that when the merchant is behind the<br/>
counter, you can&#39;t &#39;see&#39; them enough for the song to affect.  You get get<br/>
behind the counter and the song works perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
And multiple times has no affect that I saw.<br/>
