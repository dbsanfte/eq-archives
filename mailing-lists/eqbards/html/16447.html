&gt; Okay. You say casting once at the beginning then again when the mob<br/>
&gt; runs makes the druid lazy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What would make a snarer NOT lazy? (realizing that even Snare takes mana)<br/>
&gt; Do you want them to set a timer and snare every 30 seconds? Every 60<br/>
&gt; seconds?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do you expect out of your snarer to not call them lazy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lazy = refusing to change your standard MO (snare at beginning<br/>
of fight, forget about it) when a better alternative is<br/>
available that requires a little more work (let bard Chain to<br/>
slow the mob&#39;s attacks, then snare when he says the Chain is<br/>
off).<br/>
<br/>
Another reason not to snare at the beginning is dispels.  A<br/>
lot of high level casting mobs tend to buff themselves to the<br/>
hilt.  I haven&#39;t tested this formally, but dispel seems to<br/>
dispel things you haven&#39;t cast.  Since it&#39;s usually an<br/>
enchanter doing mass dispels, that means you&#39;re snare will be<br/>
gone.<br/>
