<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088245626">I am VERY sure.  I created him on the day of release.  When I had <br/>
suspected this I tested it.  I looked at and wrote down all of my <br/>
stats when I died and was naked once.  Then I went and created a NEW <br/>
Half-Elf bard and the base stats pre-allocation were the exact same.  <br/>
I also don&#39;t remember ever doing it ;)  I think they changed it AFTER <br/>
I created my bard.<br/>

allocated <br/>
