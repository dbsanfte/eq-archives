<div id="ygrps-yiv-37277155">I just switched to the dual scimitars for looks as<br/>
well, I&#39;m using the brazen brass kilij (10/35) and the<br/>
obsidian scimitar (7/27 +6agil).  Of course looks come<br/>
at a price, i.e. the kilij weighs 8.5 and the obsidian<br/>
weighs 5.0, so yes, jig is in the number 3 slot, but<br/>
in big groups I don&#39;t have to use it much, due to the<br/>
duration of the battles.  It&#39;s also nice to hit from<br/>
18-30, so it &#39;looks&#39; like your melee is doing<br/>
something :)<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s disgusting surely they just call&#39;em that,<br/>
&gt; they aren&#39;t really made of<br/>
&gt; the skin of a sentient being at all, naw just<br/>
&gt; another marketing ploy like<br/>
&gt; Naugahide right?  <br/>

&gt; I have tried for the belt and been laughed off the<br/>
&gt; auction channel.  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; sure why but there were multiple laughers so I<br/>
&gt; backed off.  I did almost get<br/>
&gt; a thick banded belt bizarrely from one of the guys<br/>
&gt; who said I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; chance in Guk of seeing a troll hide belt.  Bizarre,<br/>
&gt; truly bizarre.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought about the claws.  Umm, no def not my<br/>
&gt; style.  In fact, now that I<br/>
&gt; think about it, ick.  I&#39;d rather use my crappy<br/>
&gt; combine scimmy than look like<br/>
&gt; some wolvie clone or mr krueger&#39;s understudy.  Sigh,<br/>
&gt; guess if I insist on<br/>
&gt; cool and useful I&#39;ll just have to wait.  I&#39;d settle<br/>
&gt; for cool though.<br/>
