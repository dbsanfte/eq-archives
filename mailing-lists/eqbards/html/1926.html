<div id="ygrps-yiv-566165723">I talked to a Guide about the recurring unconsciousness thing.  They asked<br/>
if I would have had time to restart my song between unconscious periods, to<br/>
which I replied yes, unless I missed more than 2 notes.  They said that it<br/>
probably didn&#39;t matter then since I could restart the song while conscious<br/>
and have it last 2 pulses while unconscious anyway but they would bug it.<br/>
They said other spell effects don&#39;t end until you die so they saw no reason<br/>
mone should since otherwise all caster&#39;s would die the instant they went<br/>
unconsciou under the influence of any +hp spell.<br/>

&gt; After saying thanks to Bristlebain, I wondered if this was a bug<br/>
(shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; continue to get song effects if bard is unconscious) or just another<br/>
benefit<br/>
&gt; to the natural effects of all bard songs, (i.e. they continue to produce<br/>
&gt; effects even when the bard is no longer singing them).  Should I /bug this<br/>
&gt; or just be thankful that I didn&#39;t die.  <br/>
<br/>
I still maintain it&#39;s a bug - if being bashed or stunned<br/>
knocks you out of your song, going unconcious should<br/>
definitely knock you out of your song.  But in your case it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have made a difference since bard song effects last<br/>
for two pulses after you stop singing.  You would&#39;ve been<br/>
knocked unconscious, the next pulse would&#39;ve revived you, and<br/>
you would&#39;ve zoned safely.  In a (rare) situation like Roop,<br/>
where the song and poison battle it out for several pulses,<br/>
that IMHO should be /bugged.<br/>
<br/>
Another benefit you may not realize about the song is that it<br/>
stops bleeding.  When you&#39;re knocked unconcious, you usually<br/>
get a message that you are bleeding to death.  Unless someone<br/>
heals you or bandages you, you will continue to lose hp and<br/>
die even if the monster whacking on you is killed before it<br/>
can hit you again.  Yet another reason to have a bard in the<br/>
party.  :-)  I carry bandages as well for the rare occasions<br/>
where this happens to someone not in my party (lesson learned<br/>
after I saved an unconcious person from a monster, then could<br/>
do nothing but watch as he bled to death).  Saved someone&#39;s<br/>
life with them just today.<br/>
