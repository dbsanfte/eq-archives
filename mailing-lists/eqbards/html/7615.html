<div id="ygrps-yiv-260500287">TEMPLE OF SOLUSEK RO ON TEST SERVER<br/>
The Temple of Solusek Ro has gone live on the Test Server! It has all sorts<br/>
of great quests for the various caster classes, here are the details I have<br/>
so far: <br/>
<br/>
The Enchanter Tashania Quest is commenced within the Temple from an NPC who<br/>
will give you a coin bag and a book of clues. Return with the 10 Coins of<br/>
Tash combined in the bag and 50gp to claim your scroll. <br/>
Enchanters can also do a quest to obtain a Rod of Glamours. <br/>
Magicians have four quests to obtain various items. The Robe of Elements,<br/>
Earthen Boots, Circlet of Mist and Clay Bracelet. <br/>
Necromancers and Wizards also have quests for various class specific items,<br/>
but I still need details on these. <br/>
There is apparently a quest involving the Crystal of Kintaz which wipes<br/>
memories. It is beleived at this time you can use this to change<br/>
specialisations. <br/>
There is also a new quest to make Shadow Silk, for Necromancer only armour. <br/>
The temple is located opposite the Solusek Dungeons in Lavastorm, and is a<br/>
little bit tricky to enter until you figure out how, but it won&#39;t take long.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, more cool stuff for casters just what the world of Norrath needs.  Why<br/>
do we even try to play non-casters any more.</div>
