<br/>
I think there&#39;s a heck of a lot of difference between an e-bay twink and<br/>
a character who&#39;s played to 50+ switching to another character. And<br/>
especially a bard, who&#39;s probably in the best position to watch how<br/>
other&#39;s play their characters. Assuming some intelligence in the<br/>
person involved, I&#39;d say the 2 harders characters to pick up would be<br/>
the cleric and the enchanter myself. I&#39;ve run across L50+ enchanters I<br/>
know played those entire 50+ levels themselves who still aren&#39;t very<br/>
good. At the same time, I&#39;ve played in guild groups with one of our<br/>
enchanter characters played by a cleric who was excellent.<br/>
<br/>
To introduce another possible discussion point, the most noticable thing<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed about enchanters I don&#39;t consider very good is that they<br/>
seem to stun less. The enchanters in my guild always seem to stun first,<br/>
sometimes twice, before going to mez. This seems to allow them to keep<br/>
way more mobs mezzed than other enchanters I&#39;ve played with. Anyone else<br/>
notice this? I have a rl friend on another server who has a 50+<br/>
enchanter who said she doesn&#39;t use stun much because she&#39;s paranoid of<br/>
the through walls and ceiling problems with AoE spells in dungeons. The<br/>
only time I&#39;ve seen this be a problem for our guild enchanters was on<br/>
the first isle of Sky where the AoE stun brought the quest mobs up from<br/>
inside the island (twice, we still don&#39;t let him forget that one). It<br/>
sure served to show how ingrained the stun first, mez later habit was<br/>
with him though.<br/>
