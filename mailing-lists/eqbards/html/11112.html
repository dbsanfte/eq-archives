<div id="ygrps-yiv-938526552">Verant has stated that they INTENDED Selo&#39;s to cancel root, then thought<br/>
it was too powerful for us to be able to cancel root anytime, anyplace<br/>
for our entire party.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me they compromised. They took away it&#39;s effect inside<br/>
dungeons. Then outdoors, if you ALREADY have selo&#39;s going (maybe incase<br/>
you get rooted) it breaks it, if you do not already have it going,<br/>
you&#39;re rooted. Seems fair to me.<br/>

&gt; This IS a bug. Its so obvious accelerando wasnt mean to break root and ghoul<br/>
&gt; root. Moving around while<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s still the root icon on your screen? Being rooted after you zone? This<br/>
&gt; is a bug and always has<br/>
&gt; been, and using it to break root is exploiting (not that it really matters to<br/>
&gt; Verant). But I wish bards<br/>
&gt; would quit treating this as a nifty feature and acknowledge it as a bug. So<br/>
&gt; technically the song is not<br/>
&gt; &quot;un-broken&quot; as you say.<br/>
