<div id="ygrps-yiv-63486714">I never charge for corpse locating -- however, I will graciously accept the<br/>
thanks given me, in whatever form.  In my other incarnation, on Povar, I<br/>
aided a 10th level warrior or ranger in finding his body that had lots of<br/>
money and armour on it.  In the process, I died once, and needed his help<br/>
to protect me.  By the time we did finally arrive at his corpse intact, he<br/>
was grateful and paid me 1 plat, 5 gold (He could afford that easily).  I<br/>
gratefully took it, as I had been saving for some armour of my own.  He<br/>
then asked if I could help his friend out, and I did, and made another 5<br/>
gold.  It was the fun of helping them out that I enjoyed (though of course<br/>
I did go back to the leather worker and buy some pants!)<br/>
<br/>
For newbies, I just help them out, remembering that I too stumbled across<br/>
the orc camp when I was trying to find my way around Greater Faydark.<br/>
