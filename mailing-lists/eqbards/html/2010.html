<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306439526">Thanks for doing some research. I have to say that my only feedback<br/>
is some disappointment. I would have hoped that at your level the<br/>
berserker song would be so much more incredibly better than any song<br/>
stacked with our LEVEL ONE (?!?!?!) song. (I did read that right,<br/>
didn&#39;t I?)<br/>

&gt; well it was just me and a 44th level warrior in solusek&#39;s eye B, taking on<br/>
&gt; some greater kobolds, and we decided to test which battle songs are most<br/>
&gt; effective.  the results were:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; once you get to level 36, dump anthem de arms.  we found it to be very<br/>
&gt; ineffective, not very fast, and just a bit more STR than the other tests.<br/>
&gt; at level 36, stack Chant of Battle and Verses of Celerity, and give your<br/>
&gt; group an AC, STR, DEX, and AGI boost, as well as attack speed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; now that we knew anthem sucked at higher levels, the question was at level<br/>
&gt; 42, to play Berserker Crescendo (which stacks with no other songs) or the<br/>
&gt; Chant/Celerity combo.<br/>
&gt; it is still a question, some people prefer one over the other.  what we<br/>
&gt; could discern was that Berserker made you hit for your max dmg more often,<br/>
&gt; along with some increase in attack speed.  it worked really well with my<br/>
&gt; warrior&#39;s executioner&#39;s axe, so he could hit for 80+ more often.  but the<br/>
&gt; Chant/Celerity combo gives you a bit of everything, including attack speed<br/>
&gt; and getting hit less yourself, and we deduced that it would be better for<br/>
&gt; duel wielding, while Berserker may be more suited for 2h weps.<br/>
&gt; If I was to<br/>
&gt; equip a brass instrument to double the effects of Berserker, it<br/>
&gt; may make the<br/>
&gt; Chant/Celerity combo obsolete, but then i could not get in the fight, and<br/>
&gt; where&#39;s the fun in that?<br/>
&gt; i will add one other benefit of berserker is that you are only singing one<br/>
&gt; battle song instead of stacking two, which gives you the<br/>
&gt; opportunity to play<br/>
&gt; a second song more easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i would love to hear any comments or further input that anyone has.<br/>
