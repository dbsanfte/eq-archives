<br/>

grouping with sucks.  Tell them to learn how to click the Taunt<br/>
button more.  A warrior can taunt _anything_.<br/>

mix.  The monster stays on me for 3 or 4 round, and then the <br/>
warrior has taunted enough to pull it off me.<br/>

Let&#39;s face it, we&#39;ve got no hp.  At level 31, I have 700 or<br/>
so hp.  I&#39;m fighting monsters that do 50 - 80 damage a pop,<br/>
and sometimes double attack.  It is YOUR job to pull out as<br/>
soon as possible from a confrontation, and let the tank TAUNT<br/>
it off you always.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you use your weapons or not, 90% of the damage in <br/>
most typical battles comes from the casters and tanks.<br/>
You are supporting the battle with your buffs, debuffs,<br/>
crowd control, healing.  I&#39;m not saying to stop swinging,<br/>
cause that doesnt matter at all, I&#39;m just saying don&#39;t <br/>
continue to piss off a frenzied monster any more than it<br/>
is.  The tanks are more suited at absorbing damage than<br/>
you are.<br/>
