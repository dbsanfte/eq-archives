<div id="ygrps-yiv-865201517">Haha, I agree too.  IIRC, when a spellcaster damages someone, they get a<br/>

&gt; Hmm.  I wish they&#39;d change it so you could immediately see how<br/>
&gt; much damage you take from a spell.  The caster gets to see how<br/>
&gt; much damage he did, why can&#39;t you see how much damage you<br/>
