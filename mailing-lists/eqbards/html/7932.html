&gt;Its more likely to be religion.  I had a friend who went there and got<br/>
&gt;slaughtered despite never having even seen a froggie before in his life.  I<br/>
&gt;wonder if any of us lorekeeper&#39;s out there has any charts showing the<br/>
&gt;effects of various religions on your factions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most nuetral or good-aligned characters that have never killed a froglok <br/>
should have no problems running around through upper guk (not sure about <br/>
those shroomheads though). As far as lower guk is concerned  it depends on <br/>
what side of that zone you are on. Deadside is full of undead frogs, vampire <br/>
bats, gargoyles (which I think start out KOS), Greater ICe Bones, and Deadly <br/>
Black Widow spiders. Pretty much everything there will be KOS to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
On liveside I have found all frogs, minos, the evil eye, and even the <br/>
glaring gargoyle to be indifferent to dubious to my newbie druid. They will <br/>
not attack me. The only thing I have to watch out for is that HUGE water <br/>
elemental (notice the HUGE... man that thing is big!)  =P<br/>
He will aggro anyone as far as I know. I found newbie characters that aren&#39;t <br/>
KOS to live frogs to be very useful for those very hard liveside corpse <br/>
recoveries and for scouting out areas like Live Tower and the King room..<br/>
