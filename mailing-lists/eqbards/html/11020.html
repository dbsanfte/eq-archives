<div id="ygrps-yiv-410208820">No click activate magical effects, like magician summoned items, Harvest<br/>
crystals, springstones, or the like will function while you are singing a<br/>
song.  Since the AI thinks you are already casting a spell, you cannot<br/>
activate an item that casts another one.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Spell Effect problems - maybe related to levitation<br/>
bug<br/>

A high level magician friend of mine gave me a summoned ring of levitation<br/>
(whatever it is actually called) so that we might make the trip through nro<br/>
and oasis a little less painful (i.e. taking 30-40 points falling damage<br/>
while using accelerendo going up and down the dunes.)  When I right clicked<br/>
on the item to activate the spell effect nothing happened. When I stopped<br/>
playing Accelerendo and tried again, it worked fine, and I resumed playing<br/>
Selo&#39;s without a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Later I had some cast enduring breath on me, and when I tried to resume<br/>
levitating I encountered the same problem, but now since I could not drop<br/>
enduring breath, I was stuck on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a known problem with item spell effects not working when you already<br/>
have spell effects active, or could it possibly point to something that was<br/>
changed in the levitation code or general spell behaviors and may be showing<br/>
up as a bug now?<br/>
<br/>
Any info would be helpful,<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Broken Song<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt; first allow me to introduce myself.  I am new to this list, but not a new<br/>
bard nor a new player to Everquest.  I currently have a 31st level Bard on<br/>
Innoruuk, Rosha.  I have been playing him since March 26th, just not in a<br/>
hurry to level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, with the latest patch, I have noticed a problem with the level 31<br/>
song, the levitate one.  Now when I play it, it starts, I rise, I get the<br/>
message I feel as if I am about to fall, followed by You are already<br/>
floating.  This repeats for 2 cycles.  Immediately after the 3rd cycle of<br/>
the song, I then fall to the ground, the icon disappears.  On the next<br/>
cycle, it all repeats.  It does this even if twisting, so it seems to me<br/>
that it now only allows continuos levitation for two song pulses.  I did<br/>
just acquire this song, so I don&#39;t profess to be an expert, however, it did<br/>
not function like this prior to the patch.  Just a word of caution using<br/>
this song now, and be on the lookout for other changes!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
