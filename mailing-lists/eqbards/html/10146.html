<div id="ygrps-yiv-947038826">The level 48 DoT is a great song. Just don&#39;t use it when grouped with an <br/>
enchanter - they won&#39;t like it much. =)<br/>
<br/>
I went to Sol A after the Temple Ro patch to get my fiery vambraces/boots. <br/>
Took me two days. I was alone and had no problem and I barely ever used a <br/>
weapon. I equipped the lute and twisted the lvl 48 DoT, lvl 2 DoT, and Hymn, <br/>
switching to Chains before they started running (oh yeah, used MR song <br/>
instead of lvl 2 DoT if fighting a mage). If I had to fight more than one <br/>
I&#39;d charm the other.<br/>
<br/>
Some friends of mine (a lvl 50 druid and lvl 50 warrior) thought I was nuts <br/>
for soloing back there. Even though everything was green, they had trouble <br/>
and had to zone many times, while I sat back and played my songs. The song <br/>
is powerful, but honestly I don&#39;t like using it when fighting high level <br/>
mobs unless there is only one and we have a good taunter.<br/>
<br/>
Another Companions HATE attempt comin up this weekend. Will let ya know how <br/>
it went.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [eqbards] Lvl 48 song ?<br/>

&gt;Hail all ,<br/>
&gt;     I have just turned lvl 46 , and was looking to see what songs i had to<br/>
&gt;look forward to. Anyway , the lvl 46 song isn&#39;t too exciting. but i looked <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;the lvl 48 song on the concert hall song list , and it says its an area<br/>
&gt;effect song that does 100 damage in about 8 seconds . is this true ? how <br/>
&gt;much<br/>
&gt;do the other dot songs do at that lvl? Do they stack ? I checked the song<br/>
&gt;analysis and there was no info on the damage it does , just that it lowers<br/>
&gt;attack speed too ( nice bonus ). So any High lvl that have info and would<br/>
&gt;share would be great.  Btw , anyone else think berserker crescendo is<br/>
&gt;completely stupid and useless? It doesn&#39;t stack with anything , and only<br/>
&gt;gives +20 strength , or does it have other effects?<br/>
&gt;Thanks in Advance-<br/>
