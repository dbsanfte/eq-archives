&gt; MM castle is simply stunning - too bad it&#39;s so deadly few ever get to<br/>
&gt; appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
This is actually turning out to be a blessing with the servers<br/>
as overcrowded as they are.  My guild was in there last night,<br/>
and I think the max number of people in the zone the entire<br/>
time was 22.  At one point, there were 10 people in the zone,<br/>
8 of them were from our guild, and 2 were some folks camping<br/>
the room next door.<br/>
<br/>
Because of its buggy nature, I don&#39;t think MM mobs ever got<br/>
the upgrades other mobs got.  I was pulling singles for a<br/>
L30-40 group, and they were knocking everything dead within 6<br/>
song cycles (roughly 20 seconds).  Most of the MM mobs are<br/>
blue until about L43.  In comparison, I was in a L40-46 group<br/>
the previous day killing greater kobolds in Sol B, some of<br/>
which turn green at L46 (so only a 3-4 level difference from<br/>
the MM mobs).  The fights took about a minute.  Because you<br/>
can kill MM stuff 3x faster than kobolds in Sol B (which most<br/>
already regard as a rather easy) for just slightly less<br/>
experience, the exp you get in MM is insane.  A couple of the<br/>
folks I was pulling for said they&#39;d gotten 4 bubbles in the 3<br/>
hours we were there.<br/>
