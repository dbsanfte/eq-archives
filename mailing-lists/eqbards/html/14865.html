&gt; &gt; Why ice giants?  So far, all the mobs I&#39;ve seen, unless they<br/>

&gt; &gt; It&#39;s far easier to test it on level 1 mobs that can&#39;t double<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Because ice giants won&#39;t be missing you, and you won&#39;t be dodging<br/>
&gt;   them, so your health bar will be the indicator of success ;-)<br/>

swinging at you and missing.  What matters is the time between<br/>
attempts, not successes.  :)<br/>

&gt;   doesn&#39;t feel like 3.0 seconds between swings.  They are some of the<br/>

&gt;   are of level where you will see possible quadruple attacks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said, they can have speed buffs cast on them.  Dunno<br/>
about ice giants in particular, but last night I saw a gnoll<br/>
enchanter buffing other gnolls.  The message was &quot;moves<br/>
faster&quot; which is the standard attack speed buff message.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the recent bug Verant found, you will only see triple<br/>
and quad attacks if a mob is dual wielding weapons.  Sir Lucan<br/>
triple attacked me twice last night.<br/>

&gt;   an ice giant with togors on it.  It would be obvious after chains<br/>
&gt;   wore off (and didn&#39;t effect togors) if my survivability was still<br/>
&gt;   intact.  Snakes don&#39;t offer such challenges, and you then need to<br/>
&gt;   resort to logging and timing.  With larger npcs the dmg output will<br/>
&gt;   be noticably different without parsing.<br/>

is not (at least one would hope not :).<br/>
