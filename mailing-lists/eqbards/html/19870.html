<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778614610">Update on my original post.  The following day I remained in NK to try and<br/>
get a griffenne charm.  After about 2 hours, I had killed numerous griffawns<br/>
and 11, yes 11 grifennes and still hadn&#39;t gotten a charm.  A 52 mage<br/>
guildmate asked me what I was doing in NK so I told him.  He was meeting a<br/>
friend in Qeynos so had to pass thru NK on the way there.  I was in the<br/>
middle of fighting griffenne #11 when he zoned in to NK.  Shortly thereafter<br/>
he told me he had spotted a griffenne and was killing it for me.  I killed<br/>
my griffenne and did not get a charm.  Ironically though, the griffenne he<br/>
killed dropped a charm so I got it.  I spent 2 hours there and never got one<br/>
while he got one after less than a minute in the zone.  The RNG god was<br/>
definately playing tricks with my mind.<br/>
<br/>
The story doesn&#39;t end there though.  His friend sent a /tell that he was<br/>
heading to NK so we could invite him into the guild.  So we had some time to<br/>
kill while we waited for him to arrive.  While we were waiting, someone<br/>
/shouted that Zahal the Vile had spawned.  It was very late at night and the<br/>
mage and I were the only players in the zone who could kill him.  I fired up<br/>
track and we chased him down right in front of the gypsy camp.  The mage<br/>
finished him off very quickly and I got the bag of troll guts for the Fabian<br/>
quest.  So in the end I killed two birds with one stone, acquiring a<br/>
grifenne charm and the troll guts within minutes of each other.  Now all I<br/>
have to do is figure out where Fabian is:-)<br/>

re: griffenes & charms<br/>

Only have to kill griffXXXX&#39;s to force the spawn.<br/>
<br/>
Took me 3 days (20 or so griffene&#39;s), and 2 hours(6-7 griffenne&#39;s) .. in two<br/>
tries.<br/>
