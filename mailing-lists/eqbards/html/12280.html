<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531184585">same here.  a few weeks ago the consensus was to stop playing songs when<br/>
pulling, but i was in hate for 15 hours last week (finally killed Inno for<br/>
first time on our server) and i specifically asked if i needed to worry<br/>
about playing songs during pulls.  everyone said no.  i was not in the<br/>
pullers group, as you said.  the one thing that trained us badly was a stuck<br/>
golem pet, kept aggro&#39;ing all kinds of stuff.  if you see a golem come with<br/>
no pet, not good.  finally got arms though, which suck compared to mithril<br/>
but full imbrued looks pretty cool.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been starting to go to hate regularily now.  I play my <br/>
&gt; full range of<br/>
&gt; songs, and don&#39;t experience any problems at all.  Mind you, <br/>
&gt; we usually keep<br/>
&gt; bards out of the puller&#39;s group, but other than that, I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know that we<br/>
&gt; do anything special.  One of the recent trips, I didn&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; die once in<br/>
&gt; about 10 hours on the plane.<br/>
