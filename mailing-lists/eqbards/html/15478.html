<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007715596">I know this question has been answered a thousand times, but where would people suggest to move through level 30.  I went to High Keep to get 30, but the lines are ridiculous and unlike the other waiting list areas, xp is the only thing there.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, <br/>

PS - I got some MM drums this week YEA!!!  Only problem is, first thing I did was sail off of a cliff for 200 dmg.  This thing really tests your hand-eye coordination =P<br/>
