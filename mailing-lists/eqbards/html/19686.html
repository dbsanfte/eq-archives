    Hello! I&#39;ve been a lurker here for a long time and a bard even longer<br/>
(since June 6th 1999).  The folks on this list are great!  I haven&#39;t yet<br/>
contributed since I&#39;m fairly low level but I feel I have a good appreciation<br/>
of your situation so I&#39;m posting now. ;)<br/>
<br/>
    There seem to be three general types of bards I&#39;ve met in my travels;<br/>
bards who  sing (twist/weave/other word of your choice), bards who melee,<br/>
bards who think they can melee.  With normal armour and weapons, bards seem<br/>
naturally to choose either the first or second path.  Most twinks I&#39;ve<br/>
encountered become the third kind of bard and don&#39;t appreciate what it is to<br/>
be a bard until it&#39;s too late.  It seems that you can either play a bard as<br/>
a poor melee class, or as a good bard (using melee or song as the situation<br/>
warrants.)<br/>
<br/>
    The key to playing a bard (at least at the lower levels) is to<br/>
understand the capabilities of your songs and apply the right ones, with<br/>
instruments or without, in the appropriate situation.  Silly Songsinger has<br/>
provided links to excellent information about songs so I won&#39;t repeat (much)<br/>
of it.  Let me instead explain a few of the combinations I have used.  These<br/>
tactics worked well even though I have low stamina (67) and low strength<br/>
(70.)  I was equipped in full leather and had a combine scimitar which I<br/>
then upgraded to a Dragoon dirk and some banded by 15. (Actually, I&#39;m still<br/>
in mostly banded and some special armour that I&#39;ve picked up over the months<br/>
and still wielding my trusty Dragoon dirk.)<br/>
<br/>
Soloing:<br/>
    Soloing is something I prefer not to do since bards really shine when<br/>
grouped with a true tank (warrior, ranger, paladin, shadowknight are best -<br/>
rogues and monks aren&#39;t as good unless they are hitting the back of a<br/>
creature.)  However, sometimes a bard is travelling around and just has to<br/>
solo.  I found I could solo low blues but not high blues.  With weapons, I<br/>
could take one low blue.  With instruments, two low blues simultaneously.<br/>
Twinking will allow you to take on tougher creatures but I suspect the<br/>
strategy will still apply.<br/>
<br/>
Solo strategy #1:<br/>
    Find a low blue or two that is isolated from others and equip the lute.<br/>
Start up Hymn of Restoration (HoR), Anthem de Arms (Anthem), then pull the<br/>
two with Chords of Dissonance (CoD).  Start punching while twisting those<br/>
three songs (the punching for 1 - 5 may not seem like much but the fight<br/>
will be long so it will add up.)  Depending upon the creatures you fight,<br/>
keeping up the twisting can be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
    Try to pick creatures that don&#39;t bash. When I had more experience, I<br/>
soloed the two gnoll guardsman in blackburrow near the door to the spike<br/>
room but I had mostly perfected twisting by then.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend you<br/>
start there because they bash and if you&#39;re not careful, you can hit other<br/>
gnolls through the walls with your CoD and start really bad trains.  Learn<br/>
twisting somewhere safer first. You can practice this strategy fairly safely<br/>
out in the Karanas on silvermist wolves and switch to gnoll reavers when you<br/>
are a little better at it. (Stay in a zoomed out view so you can keep your<br/>
eye on anything nearby)<br/>
<br/>
Solo strategy #2:<br/>
    Variant A: Find a creature or two (ideally slow creatures like scythe<br/>
beetles) and equip your lute.  Play Hymn of Restoration, Chords of<br/>
Dissonance, then pull with Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow.  If the creatures are<br/>
slow, you can kite them around with these three songs (Hymn is needed if you<br/>
get hit and you will when you first learn the range of your bellow and CoD.)<br/>
(Stay in a zoomed out view so you can keep your eye on anything  nearby.)<br/>
<br/>
    Variant B: This tactic has a less useful and/or more difficult variant<br/>
if you play Selo&#39;s Accelerando (Selos) with a drum, CoD with a lute, then<br/>
Bellow with either the lute to maintain a higher damage on CoD or equip the<br/>
drum (for more safety) in preparation for the next pulse of Selos.  You have<br/>
to use this more dangerous variant when kiting silvermist wolves, lions, and<br/>
other fast creatures that catch up to normal running speed.<br/>
<br/>
Solo strategy #3:<br/>
    Find a single creature (or make a camp into a single creature with<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Lugubrious Lament) then equip your weapons.  I had a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
and a Shiny Brass Shield (SBS) until I got dual wield.  Start up Anthem and<br/>
HoR then pull the creature with Bellow.  Keep twisting those three<br/>
throughout the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Grouping:<br/>
    Bards are best at grouping.  Try to avoid any group that considers you a<br/>
melee class since you will be limited to being a poor tank.  There are many<br/>
great combinations you can use depending upon the members of your group, the<br/>
type of creatures you are fighting and the type of pull you get (solo,<br/>
multiples.)  Generally, I used the following:<br/>
<br/>
Your group against casters:<br/>
    This one is best at level 18.  Equip the drum and play Guardian<br/>
Rhythms(GR), Elemental Rhythms(ER) or Purifying Rhythms(PR), Anthem de Arms<br/>
(to help the tanks take down the caster quickly.)  Below 18, I usually<br/>
equipped a drum and played ER/PR, HoR, Anthem.  A completely different<br/>
strategy is to use Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby (Lullaby) with a lute if you can<br/>
take a few blasts and the caster is significantly lower level (eg. low blue,<br/>
or green.)  It&#39;s a fast ticket to your bind point otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Your group against high con solo creature:<br/>
    Generally, your damage songs won&#39;t affect them much so stick to buffing<br/>
the tanks as much as possible.  Usually I equip a drum and use Anthem, HoR,<br/>
and throw in ER for some AC buffing then later in the fight switch to the<br/>
lute for faster healing. The extra AC from ER is only a few points but it<br/>
can make the difference between the tanks getting hit for max damage a lot<br/>
vs getting hit for max less often and partial damage more often and will<br/>
generally save downtime more than trying to get a bellow or CoD to stick<br/>
while maintaining Anthem (the most important.)<br/>
<br/>
Your group against low con solo creature:<br/>
    This should be an easy fight.  To make it even easier, I use Anthem,<br/>
CoD, Bellow with a lute equiped and change Bellow to HoR if the tanks are<br/>
actually taking any damage to preventatively reduce downtime afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
You group against multiple low con creatures:<br/>
    There are really many different scenarios here.  This is where the most<br/>
variation in tactics can occur.  The following strategies will work, even<br/>
with an enchanter, as long as your AE songs don&#39;t hit the creatures that the<br/>
enchanter has mezed.  With my weak hit points and AC, I can do the<br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
    - If there is a caster and two or less non-casters, I normally MR buff<br/>
using a drum and ER/PR + GR.  Try to start your songs after the tanks have<br/>
engaged the caster and stay as far away from the fight as possible.  This<br/>
will help stick as many of the extras as possible on the tanks but you will<br/>
get beaten.  You better hope you know how to twist songs and that the tanks<br/>
can take the caster down fast so you can get to the next part. ;)  After the<br/>
caster has been eliminated, equip the lute and play Lullaby until the tanks<br/>
have reduced the rest down to just one then use the tactic above for group<br/>
vs. 1 low con.  (Note: everyone MUST /assist the main tank for this to work<br/>
or you will be killed because everything that gets hit will beat on you<br/>
unless it is very well occupied.)  If the tanks don&#39;t seem to know the<br/>
meaning of /assist, as a backup plan, try twisting HoR, CoD, and Anthem but<br/>
you won&#39;t be able to keep this up for long and stay alive.  You might have<br/>
to flee so be ready to equip the drum and run. ;)<br/>
<br/>
    - If there are 2-4 non-casters, get the tanks /assisted on one at a<br/>
time, and play Lullaby with a lute until they have reduded it down to one<br/>
left then play HoR, Anthem, CoD.  The backup plan of HoR, Anthem, CoD listed<br/>
above will not work in this situation.  Equip a drum and Selos to the zone<br/>
while shouting out about the train if this happens. Or, an alternate escape<br/>
strategy is to equip the lute and play Lullaby while running behind the<br/>
tanks to the zone.  This seems dangerous and it is, but you can pull off<br/>
some miraculous escapes when it works.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how any of these strategies will change as I get to the higher<br/>
levels but for now, they seem to be good, at least to level 20. Thanks to<br/>
everyone on eqbards for a lot of the ideas and strategies and sorry for the<br/>
long post!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] How did you play when you were 15th?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi guys, I&#39;m new to this list and I was hoping I could get a little advice<br/>
&gt; on play tactics. I have a 15th level bard as my secondary character and<br/>
he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an awesome change from my ranger and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to play<br/>
&gt; him most effectivly. Lately I&#39;ve been hunting orcs in Crushbone by<br/>
meleeing<br/>
&gt; them and bellowing at them, it seemed to be working better than bringing<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; Anthem for it&#39;s haste factor. I tried using the 15th level song to mez<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; but it didn&#39;t seem to buy me anything in combat, it did help me escape a<br/>
&gt; training one afternoon though. Is there another way I should be playing<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; encounters? Is there any place you&#39;d recomend that would be hungry for a<br/>
&gt; bard to group at my level?<br/>
