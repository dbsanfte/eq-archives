<div id="ygrps-yiv-81711018">Nicely done! I&#39;m still working on the FV statue myself. Did you use a<br/>
drum?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve managed such climbs as the Kaladim dwarf, various spires, all<br/>
sorts of buildings in cities, and the Iksar statue in the Overthere<br/>
straight out from Warslik&#39;s Woods.<br/>
<br/>
This is the sort of thing that Verant should incorporate into bard<br/>
quests, IMHO. Climbs like this are the sort of thing only a bard would<br/>
really attempt, with mana and components no issue for Lev and Selo&#39;s.<br/>
Or what about running from one end of, say WK to the other within a<br/>
tight time limit? Beats the hell out of 14-hour camps for quests.<br/>

&gt; Well, I was slightly bored on Saturday, so I decided to climb the<br/>
statue of Firiona Vie in FV.  Anything that tall is just meant to be<br/>
climbed :).  I don&#39;t think it would be possible to anyone not a Bard,<br/>
but it may be possible.  Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/">http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/</a> for<br/>
screenshots and a description of how I did it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope a few of you try it yourself, it&#39;s a blast and a great view : )<br/>
