<div id="ygrps-yiv-435662026"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;One of my favorite spots is the rocky area between the Aviak Roost and the<br/>
&gt;Lake Rathe zone. I would definitely suggest having a ranger with you when<br/>
&gt;hunting in the plains. You can hunt Aviak Darters, Egrets, and Rooks if you<br/>
&gt;have a good group. Rooks drop decent loot sometimes (rarely a darter might<br/>
&gt;drop something very nice). Elephants (especially bulls) can yield decent xp<br/>
&gt;but not decent loot. The Centaurs are also good but they can be tough.<br/>
&gt;Centaur archers can drop medium ringmail sometimes, but they are tough (and<br/>
&gt;they one of the WEAKER centuars).<br/>

memories of it.  I just thought the Aviak city was, quite simply,<br/>
neat--perhaps reminded me of my home Kelethin while I seemed so far, and the<br/>
centaurs struck me as very interesting as well.  The time I was there I had<br/>
the whole zone all to myself, not many mid level PCs back then I guess.<br/>
Suppose if I returned now I would be witnessing a slaughterfest.  Don&#39;t<br/>
know, I would never advise anyone to start lowering factions with a race<br/>
which does not already hate you.  At the time, I remember thinking I would<br/>
one day learn the Centaur and Aviak languages and return to see if anything<br/>
happened.  I doubt anything would, but who knows, perhaps one day there<br/>
could be some interesting quests from those races.  &lt;shrugs&gt; Bards shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be exploring and making contact with new cultures to just slaughter them,<br/>
just me.<br/>

Now a culture which deserves to die is the Frogs!  Death to all frogs!  Then<br/>
collect their meat, and brew up something nasty with it and get drunk off<br/>
your arse off their slimey arses!  Heheh, I love Guk lately.  Place is a<br/>
madhouse.  What&#39;s great about is just about any level player can find a<br/>
niche there, assist one another, and I&#39;m still impressed how most Trolls<br/>
stay in character and talk like total morons.</div>
