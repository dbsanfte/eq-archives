bandits just made it too unpredictable.  Not to mention<br/>
wandering bears, lions, and yes, even hill giants.  That was a<br/>
really sick joke on Verant&#39;s part placing a hill giant path<br/>
*directly through* one of the bandit camps.  And when a fight<br/>
does turn bad, it&#39;s usually a long, long run to the guards or<br/>
the zone, leading to long downtimes between fights.<br/>

no way you should be facing 3 at once, much less 7 at once.<br/>

If there is a caster bandit, you must kill it first.  If there<br/>
are multiple casters, I&#39;m not sure what you can do.  At your<br/>
level, if I got jumped by 5 or 7 melee bandits, I would sing a<br/>
few songs to get them fixated on me while the others engaged<br/>
just one bandit to get it off me.  Then I would hit<br/>
Accelerando and run in big circles with all the other bandits<br/>
in tow until my group finished off the first bandit.  Then I&#39;d<br/>
swing around to let them pick off another bandit from my<br/>
entourage.  Repeat.<br/>
