<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804735998">Yea, was wondering how you get to top of Kurn&#39;s tower. Tried it one time <br/>
and couldn&#39;t figure it out. Not much of a climber I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I did climb statue in Everfrost and took a ride down on top of Redwind&#39;s <br/>
temple. Can&#39;t see much from the statue since it snows a lot though.<br/>

&gt;i agree the rivervale bank (way up top the mountain) is a nice view. I used<br/>
&gt;to do it all the time way back when...<br/>

&gt;WOW!  Very nice climb.  Gives me something to strive for.  So far, I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;up the wizard spires, and the RV bank, but than I&#39;m only 13th, so have a<br/>
&gt;little while before I can attempt that one.  Nice to know I&#39;m not the only<br/>
&gt;dare devil bard around.  Everyone thinks I&#39;m nuts, but hey, it&#39;s a great<br/>
&gt;view up there. *smiles*<br/>

&gt;   Well, I was slightly bored on Saturday, so I decided to climb the statue<br/>
&gt;of Firiona Vie in FV.  Anything that tall is just meant to be climbed :).  I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t think it would be possible to anyone not a Bard, but it may be<br/>
&gt;possible.  Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/">http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/</a> for screenshots and a<br/>
&gt;description of how I did it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Hope a few of you try it yourself, it&#39;s a blast and a great view : )<br/>
