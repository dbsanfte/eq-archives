<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048266998">Before you hit level 53 - using charm you pretty much can only handle 3<br/>
mobs.  Having a party member root is your best bet.  When I got to 53 I<br/>
never used charm again.  Charm is capped at 51 level mobs anyway - that will<br/>
start being an issue.<br/>
<br/>
At 53 Song of Twilight will become your bread-and-butter crowd control song.<br/>
It&#39;s the only song that lasts 4 pulses not 3; and doesn&#39;t have a random<br/>
duration - it always lasts the full 24 seconds.  Therefore - hypothetically;<br/>
with no resists and no lag issues, etc - you could keep 4 mobs mezzed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that VERY difficult - but I can keep 3 mobs (excepting highly<br/>
resistant ones) mezzed indefinitely.  It can be very difficult if they are<br/>
bunched together - especially like named mobs; but with a good group that<br/>
knows how to spread them out - you should be able to handle a four pull<br/>
without too many problems.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Question on Lute of the Howler and Crowd Control<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Two separate questions really. First, none of the normal sites seem to<br/>
have information on what drops a Lute of the Howler. Can anyone fill me in<br/>
please?<br/>
<br/>
Second, on crowd control, how do you fellow bards handle groups of 4+<br/>
mobs? I can easily handle mobs #2 and #3 with charm, but if no one is<br/>
smart enough to root #4 the group is in trouble. Mezz isn&#39;t reliable,<br/>
especially while trying to control a pet, and there&#39;s usually no room<br/>
indoors to kite.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
