&gt; As far as I know, Pixie Strike does not clear the &quot;sh*t list&quot; in any manner.<br/>
&gt; If I pixie strike a large rat, as soon as it&#39;s un-stunned/un-mezzed, it will<br/>
&gt; bee-line for me.  If there is a memory blur component it is _very_ weak.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My CHA is 104 (still waiting to get another Opalline Earring and/or the Veil<br/>
&gt; that increases CHA - perhaps the leather foot raider cap), but I could never<br/>
&gt; reliably pixie strike a faerie guard in lesser faydark.  Often times they<br/>
&gt; would attack me immediately after it&#39;s &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; (even though I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t in attack mode).  For that reason, I considered the song to be mostly<br/>
&gt; useless - but then again that&#39;s the only time that I&#39;ve used it.  Also, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; found that MOBs can get off their spell faster than I can Pixie Strike them<br/>
&gt; (even if I sing it immediately after they go into cast mode).  I used to<br/>
&gt; consider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I started using it<br/>
&gt; against Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll definitely keep<br/>
&gt; playing with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by charm, lullaby,<br/>
&gt; screech, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why, later in a bard&#39;s life, it becomes very frustrating when<br/>
you discover you can&#39;t charm a mob over 38. Pixie Strike is a very poor<br/>
substitute for what I mainly used charm for. Casters seem to be able to<br/>
cast fine while lullaby&#39;d so that&#39;s pretty useless as a replacement, and<br/>
screech can be suicide in some dungeons, especially lower guk where<br/>
you&#39;ll probably spend a lot of time. <br/>
<br/>
Oh well, enjoy charm while you&#39;ve got it.<br/>
