&gt; Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>
&gt; since about three weeks after release.  It simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>
&gt; could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>
&gt; characters, each on a different server:<br/>

decide to twink.  You can twink, you know what to fight, you<br/>
have powerful friends, and if you have two computers and two<br/>
accounts you have another high level character that&#39;s 100%<br/>
dedicated to helping your new character.  A friend of mine<br/>
with two accounts has a L49 druid, and managed to powergame a<br/>
necro from level 1 to 40 in I&#39;d guess about a week of played<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt; Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>
&gt; Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You only have about 32 days played out of the ~300 days the<br/>
game has been running.  So you&#39;re only playing about 2-3 hours<br/>
a day, which means you probably have a life.  :)  Most of the<br/>
addicts are 4+ hour a day players.  The college students,<br/>
work-at-home types, and sleep-deprived typically have 8+ hours<br/>
a day.<br/>
