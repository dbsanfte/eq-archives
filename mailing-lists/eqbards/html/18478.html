<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743148941">More FoH second hand rumor (but hey, it was on the internet so it *must* be<br/>
true):<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Early wensday morning Elderan Lotuswood member of<br/>
&gt;&gt; Fires of Heaven from<br/>
&gt;&gt; Veeshan and a ranger obtained level 60 becomming the<br/>
&gt;&gt; first player to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;What a farce eh? Fyi it was a &#39;race&#39; between Furor (1<br/>
&gt;account, 4-5 people playing it) and Elderan (1 person,<br/>
&gt;4 PC&#39;s and accounts)and FoH and their cronies seem to<br/>
&gt;think its some kind of major accomplishment.. it shows<br/>
&gt;nothing other than an unhealthy obssesion, addiction<br/>
&gt;and *way* to much spare time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can understand mixed feelings about this guy (and this guild) in their<br/>
relentless pursuit of power (level - which in eq is power.)  Foremost, I<br/>
guess it&#39;s their right to do what turns them on and gaining levels<br/>
apparently does - even at the cost of many hours of boredom.   To do it in<br/>
17 days, I guess he did little else and what he did he was pretty good at.<br/>
I was pretty low in 50 when Kunark released.  In the first week or so, I<br/>
made 51 but then have been stagnent (playing my secondaries mostly) but I<br/>
guess I need to get going and make 52.<br/>
<br/>
As for uber-guilds, my guild has about 60 level 50&#39;s.  Some of them are able<br/>
to be online most anytime of day, ie they are in college or in between r/l<br/>
jobs.  So, if the server resets and we feel like a dragon, we have a pretty<br/>
good chance of getting one. It was not always that way.  A few months ago,<br/>
we did not have enough ppl to mount a dragonn raid and we would take guests.<br/>
When we finally had enough to do it all guild, we did not have enough 50&#39;s<br/>
in enough planes gear to make it as easy as it is for us now. So, we got<br/>
smooshed few times and learned stuff.  But my point is, doing large guild,<br/>
multi-group things is no small effort.  All too often, you end up with 20+<br/>
ppl waiting for one person.  One time we sat for 2+ hours waiting for ppl to<br/>
login for a planned plane raid and ended up cancelling it due to lack of the<br/>
right ppl (ie not enough clerics or not enough tanks whatever.) So, when I<br/>
hear that they are organized and ppl know where to go and what to do, that<br/>
don&#39;t sound all too bad to me - heh.  An over bearing, military style<br/>
attitude oth does not sound too delitefull.<br/>
<br/>
I still end up doing dumb stuff.  My wiz broke camp in Gfay and heard some<br/>
guy shouting for a loc of the brownie guards so he could get his corpse.<br/>
Hmm, this guy must be really lost (he&#39;s a level 8 gnome wizard.) So, I go to<br/>
help him and we confirm no corpses in this zone and set out for Lesser Fay.<br/>
We hug the zone and see the brownie villiage. I invis us and he goes to get<br/>
his corpse.  Invis drops or he tried to loot it and he dropped it and they<br/>
attack.  I try to gate us and he dies in 2 rounds and my wiz dies before the<br/>
spell is done casting.  Sheesh.  My wiz gates back to gfay and I log Sylly<br/>
on the other PC. Then the gnome goes LD.  We wait 20 min and no gnome. So we<br/>
set out and as we are about to zone, the gnome is back. So, we go back and<br/>
get him and yada yada. Sylly ends up dragging the corpses to the gfay zone<br/>
so they can loot in peace &lt;g&gt;.  Total waste of time - in fact a loss of xp<br/>
for my wiz but a great adventure and a happy little gnome (who wont be<br/>
visiting Lfay for 10 or 20 levels prolly &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
There is great fun in doing things &quot;first&quot; and we have some firsts in our<br/>
guild on our server (Miriana&#39;s guild has lots more).  The relentless pursuit<br/>
of being first is not all that apealling.  Finding some middle ground is in<br/>
itself difficult.  What FoH is doing, seems to me to be the right thing for<br/>
&quot;getting there first.&quot;  Powerlevel an A-team. Power up the rest.  Go to new<br/>
zones when you are at the top of the food chain (as high a level as you can<br/>
get) and have the best gear you can get.  But the way they do it may not be<br/>
what everyone enjoys in terms of fun.<br/>

&gt; Heh hard to believe you haven&#39;t heard of FoH ;)  They&#39;re the most infamous<br/>
&gt; guild in the game ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They live on Veeshan.  Fires of the Heavens.  Very powerful Uber Guild. </span></blockquote></div>
