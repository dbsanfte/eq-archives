<div id="ygrps-yiv-98803637">I had a similar situation happen in High Keep.  Although i didn&#39;t use the<br/>
carillon song I checked prices with both the bard salesman an d the Eurdite who<br/>
stands next to him and for some reason the Eurdite salesman gives me better<br/>
prices when i sell my loot.  Anyone have any idea why this is?  Meant to ask<br/>
before but forgot till this note popped up.<br/>

&gt; Went to Freeport loaded with loot...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Went to the Bards Guild, where I seem to always get the best prices. Checked<br/>
&gt; the prices on some items I wanted to sell and thought, &quot;Hey, I will try the<br/>
&gt; Carrilion song to raise my faction!&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, loaded it up, played it, and went to sell....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And she offered LESS than what she had offered WITHOUT the song playing!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else have this happen?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
