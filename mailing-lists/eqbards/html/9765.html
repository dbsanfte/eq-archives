&gt;     But anyway - I got to the armor store in E Freeport and look at the <br/>
&gt;Steel Plate.  I notice that they mostly offer 1 or 2 AC points above the <br/>
&gt;equivalent banded.  Same as Bronze with a small weight saving.  Question is <br/>
&gt;- is it worth it?  How important is one or two AC points?  How important is <br/>
&gt;2 or 3 but giving up STR or whatever bonuses.  I have Blackened Iron <br/>
&gt;Shoulders.  It says &quot;Magic Item&quot;.  What does this actually provide?  Is the <br/>
&gt;Steel Pauldron the equivalent?  Pretty annoying you can&#39;t tell without <br/>
&gt;buying and then you can sell it at a fraction of what you pay for it if you <br/>
&gt;make a mistake (obviously forcing you to check website like EQualizer...<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This may have already been touched upon, but I&#39;ll say this: I was in full <br/>
steel plate by 26th level (well the visual pieces anyways). The AC <br/>
difference is not much, but that is only half the reason for the upgrade, <br/>
bro. Not only will you have a slightly higher AC than you will with Banded, <br/>
but PLATE ARMOR inherently absorbs damage better than lower forms of armor.<br/>
<br/>
Compare a monk in whatever armor he is wearing (doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s <br/>
raw-hide or full shiverback &quot;armor&quot; or whatever the planes armor is <br/>
nowadays) against any plate-wearing melee class when getting hit by a <br/>
monster. WHEN HIT by the mob, a monk will almost always take more damage per <br/>
blow than a plate-wearing person, because of the class of armor.<br/>
<br/>
This was not the case in early to mid-beta testing. I had a wizard wearing <br/>
robes and was able to tank monsters all the time. Then armor rules were <br/>
changed to be more realistic, and I would ALWAYS keep myself in the rear <br/>
lines of battle to avoid being hit.<br/>
<br/>
To quote one of the Verant employees shortly after that armor patch, &quot;I got <br/>
sick of seeing players in paper-suits tanking mobs...&quot;<br/>
