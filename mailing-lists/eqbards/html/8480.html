 </span></blockquote>		What level is Lambent armour vs. Crafted armour.  At least<br/>
as far as the quests are concerned.  It seems that the Lambent is a mid 30s<br/>
quest or so, I&#39;m not sure of the level of crafted, or the stats compared<br/>
with lambent.  However, if they&#39;re the same level, yes, I think warrior<br/>
armour should be better than bard armour.  That&#39;s why warriors exists, to<br/>
take damage, and dish it out.  IMO, the only reason bards get decent armour<br/>
to begin with, is it&#39;s much easier to let bards wear plate, than to fix the<br/>
problem with bard hate.  I&#39;d rather run around looking like a ranger, but<br/>
can&#39;t because everything seems to get fixated on me.<br/>
