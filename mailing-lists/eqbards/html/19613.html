<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Song Icon Bug <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561134469">I asked about that as well.<br/>
<br/>
All my party members got constantly flashing bard song icons. They also had<br/>
flashing icons when a buff was about to run out.<br/>
<br/>
I (and the bards I spoke to on my server) never have flashing icons anymore,<br/>
bard song or otherwise. Things just drop.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, if I can compile a list of which servers and what levels this bug<br/>
may be affecting, I&#39;ll send it to abashi and post it on the boards and try<br/>
to get it changed. (provided that&#39;s what we want.)<br/>

Now that you mention it, SoW, Alacrity, etc didn&#39;t flash for me last night<br/>
either they just went away.  Winder if they tried to fix the way bard songs<br/>
always flash for everyone else in the party when we are twisting and got it<br/>
wrong.<br/>

<br/>
what server and level?<br/>
<br/>
I asked 3 other bards on my server level 36 - 46 and none of them got<br/>
flashing icons.<br/>

hmm, my bard can see when buffs are about to fade.<br/>

&gt;I was in kedge a few days ago and a realization hit me...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My icons don&#39;t flash anymore before they fade. When I was a young bard<br/>
&gt;growing up, I used to see flashing icons all the time, reminding me that my<br/>
&gt;buff was about to fade so that I could refresh it. I know that my ranger<br/>
&gt;still sees his icons fading. (it&#39;s just that I almost never play him<br/>
&gt;anymore) But bards are not so lucky.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone know why or when this change made it in, and does anyone else feel<br/>
&gt;that we should fight to get it back?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I hadn&#39;t had Tarew&#39;s memmed, I would have been EXTREMELY nervous being<br/>
