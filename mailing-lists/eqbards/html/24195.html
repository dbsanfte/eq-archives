<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806356587"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; the problem is, i think these are bogus reasons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bogus or not, they&#39;re reasons people gave as to why DDD never gets <br/>
memmed.  It was apparent to me, before I even wrote the first post <br/>
with the first question, that you already used the song.  So the <br/>
question never applied to you in the first place.  Of course, now the <br/>
thread has been completely derailed from people giving suggestions <br/>
(what, there was one answer?) and into discussing whether this song <br/>
is worth memming again.  My question was trying to move the discusion <br/>
OFF whether it&#39;s useful (because we&#39;ve established that most people <br/>
say it&#39;s not) to what would make it useful.  Maybe I&#39;ll start <br/>
addressing you as GrollerDaBard the way you manage to highjack a <br/>
topic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&quot;Takes too much mana, so I can&#39;t charm.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; this is valid if you are charming.  it seems like most bards don&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>charm in groups with an enchanter, so that makes this only valid in <br/>
non enchanter groups.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s valid in groups without chanters, or in groups where you&#39;re <br/>
still charming even with an Enchanter present (to satisfy groller, <br/>
few Bards are in this situation).  It&#39;s also valid if you ever think <br/>
that maybe you&#39;ll lose the Enchanter in 10 minutes and may need mana <br/>
to charm.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&quot;Takes too much mana, so the recast is way too long.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; recast is not an issue since you can swap it out whenever you don&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have enough mana to cast it and swap it back in when you do.<br/>
<br/>
Recast contributes to usefulness in the sense of damage over time.  <br/>
This probably belongs in combination with the next point about damage <br/>
being weak.<br/>
<br/>
Status: Non-bogus reason, in combination with other bad aspects of <br/>
the song.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&quot;The damage it does is pitiful, especially when you look at the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>mob scaling between 50 and 60.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; it may be pitiful, but so is bard melee.  does that mean you don&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>melee at all? it may not be the be all end all of all damage songs or <br/>
spells, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there is no place for it.<br/>
<br/>
The reasons stated 450 damage vs. a 100k mob is worthless.  You point <br/>
out our melee is also worthless.  So how does that make this song <br/>
more valuable?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; this is just so wrong on so many levels that it would take a whole <br/>

to my earlier posts where i pointed out when an excellent time to use <br/>
this song was, which wouldn&#39;t mess up the enchanter at all and would <br/>
do a significant amount of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we&#39;ve read all those posts of yours.  It&#39;s still a reason given <br/>
by Bards and one I threw up there (and answered with my own opinion <br/>
if you remember correctly) to get some discussion going.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not talking about it turning into the primary song every Bard <br/>
&gt; &gt;plays from 43 to 60.  I&#39;m talking about it becoming useful.. <br/>
&gt; &gt;occasionally, every once in awhile, rarely... something more than <br/>

&gt; sorry, maybe i misinterpreted your 90% statement then, my bad.  i <br/>
 </span></blockquote>originally thought you  meant that 90% of the time, bards would be <br/>
using it.  but maybe you meant that 90% of the bards would use it <br/>
once in a while.  in that case, i think it has it&#39;s uses once in a <br/>
while if you use it correctly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m interested in finding out what would have to change in order <br/>
for most Bards to be able to think of a time they could use it.  <br/>
Rather than most saying they would never mem the song.  And yes, we <br/>
already know you think it&#39;s useable every once in awhile, which means <br/>
the original question didn&#39;t apply to you at all.<br/>
