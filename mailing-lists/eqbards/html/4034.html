&gt; Okay on to more serious business. I completed the Ogre Head Quest in<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock last night by dropping off the heads of two named Ogres<br/>
&gt; (Corflunk and Zarcoomi) to Byzar Bloddforge in Kaladim. As a reward I<br/>
&gt; received a Blackened Iron Crown<br/>
&gt; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Blackened.Iron.Crown.html)">http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/EQ-Blackened.Iron.Crown.html)</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; which I thought was pretty nifty. This morning I was browsing Everlore and<br/>
&gt; someone had remarked that this item had been sold at auction for 250pp. I<br/>
&gt; just about passed out with dreams of avarice. Anyone have an idea if this is<br/>
&gt; even near to being true? If so I am camping in BB for a while longer.<br/>

You will occasionally get blackened iron items (armor only I<br/>
think) for completing this quest.  You just happened to hit<br/>
the jackpot by getting the crown.  IIRC it is +5 to all<br/>
resists, and yes it&#39;s worth around 250pp.  Normally you have<br/>
to kill the goblin king in Runnyeye many times to get the<br/>
crown (he usually drops the grotesque mask).  Congratulations.<br/>
