&gt; Start and stop any other song to cut that process short, thus making it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it is annoying that they decided to lengthen our<br/>
&quot;recovery&quot; phase for newly memorized songs considering we<br/>
already take 10x longer to memorize than any other class.  A<br/>
lot of these delays are client-side though, which really makes<br/>
me question the robustness of the game to hacking.<br/>
