and cold resist, not magic resist?  I was using Elemental and<br/>
Guardian Rhythms last night with a battle drum fighting hags<br/>
in Unrest (113 MR, 74 FR and CR, a little more or less for<br/>
others).  I didn&#39;t see a single resist message.  Do you even<br/>
get a resist message if you resist a DD?  When I did the same<br/>
thing fighting evil eyes, we saw many &quot;tries to charm you but<br/>
you resist&quot; messages.<br/>

I wonder how many people are ignoring this thread because it<br/>
has &quot;twinking&quot; in the subject.  :-)<br/>
