raising different resists) is the Psalm of Cooling gives you<br/>
ultravision, as opposed to infravision for the Psalm of<br/>
Warmth.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No damage shield as far as I&#39;ve been able to tell.<br/>

&gt; chant. It stated target damage and -magic resist. I would like to know more<br/>
&gt; about this song i e how much dd it does and is that song worth taking up a<br/>
&gt; song slot for another DD song? how much MR does it lower? This follows along<br/>
&gt; with my curiosity of the other chants (flame etc)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a modest amount, about 10-15 points/tick pre-PvP-patch,<br/>
for about 30-45 points per application (don&#39;t remember<br/>
exactly).  MR reduction was -10 when I first got it<br/>
(pre-PvP-patch) but was -11 last night at level 39.  It&#39;s<br/>
generally not worth it.  If the song actually worked and using<br/>
a drum doubled the effect (it&#39;s listed as a percussion song),<br/>
the song could be useful in combat weaved (woven? :) with<br/>
Elemental Rhythms and Chant of Battle.  But in its current<br/>
state, -10 to -15 to a mob&#39;s MR is laughable - the enchanter&#39;s<br/>
level 4 tashan does the same.  I&#39;d rather Chain or Bind and<br/>
decrease the damage my party takes by 30%, instead of increase<br/>
the damage we do by 10%.<br/>
<br/>
Chant of Flame had the same damage, but lowered fire resist<br/>
instead of magic resist.<br/>
