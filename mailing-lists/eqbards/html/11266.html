I would say train 1hs 1hb and piercing.  And keep them maxed as you grow.<br/>
Sooner or later you can get some of the neat toys (weapons) and that will<br/>
help fight the worst EQ monster of them all: boredom.  Combine Long Sword or<br/>
a Fine Steel Long Sword if you have a Dragoon Dirk, Giant Snake Fang if no<br/>
Dirk but do have CLS, for early 1hb you can get something from loots off<br/>
gnolls and or skellys.  <br/>
<br/>
Kiting fire beetles with your song is what being a new bard is all about!<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

		Oh yea, a few more questions I came up with this weekend:<br/>
<br/>
		Should I be developing more than 1HS weapon skill?  (in<br/>
terms of<br/>
		weapons?)<br/>
		Has anyone tried to make a group of 6 bards doing that AOE<br/>
song and just<br/>
		walk around in a dungeon?  I&#39;m just curious how effective<br/>
that group<br/>
		would be?<br/>
		What do you guys do with all your practices (hmm maybe I<br/>
should see<br/>
		question 1)?  It seems most of our skills going up pretty<br/>
well on their<br/>
		own with  alittle priming...<br/>
		I was using the Discord song to just kite fire beetles for<br/>
real nice xp<br/>
		at lvl 3, is this considered an abuse? (I actualyl try to<br/>
never take<br/>
		advantage of games &quot;flaws&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
		Finally, thanks to all the bards who helped me this weekend!<br/>
You guys<br/>
		(and gals) are the best!<br/>
