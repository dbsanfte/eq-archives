&gt; &gt;  I should know this - and could probably look it up if I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; &gt;  lazy..  But what&#39;s the difference between Ultravision and <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Infravision..<br/>

&gt; Nobody explicitly said this, but if I&#39;m not mistaken, Ultravision <br/>
&gt; also allows you to see through invisibility.  I used to sing <br/>
&gt; it to find <br/>
&gt; out whether any of my favorite KSing Wizards were hiding in the rooms <br/>
&gt; with us in High Keep.  I am pretty certain that infravision <br/>
&gt; does not see <br/>
&gt; invisible, since I believe it is the same as my native Half-Elf <br/>
&gt; infravision.<br/>

&gt; PS - Playing my non-infravision characters, the worst vision <br/>
&gt; spot I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; found so far is the zone tunnel between Everfrost and Blackburrow.  I <br/>
&gt; finally got the turns memorized, but that tunnel is LONG and DARK.<br/>

Greater Faydark, Kithicor, etc. But after I upgraded my video card you can<br/>
see things a whole lot clearer, including the tunnels.<br/>
