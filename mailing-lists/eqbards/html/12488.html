<div id="ygrps-yiv-633807225"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; they finally got vox down.  obviously we&#39;re not slamming you Harm, just<br/>
&gt; rethink the resist theory.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  not taken that way, I asked for the advice, just also shared my <br/>
  thoughts.  I will attempt to guide the next Vox raid, and will <br/>
  require minimum cold resistance and pick and choose the most<br/>
  elite of the server group (30 people, since we are learning).<br/>
<br/>
  Since we are sharing ideas, we should start a thread on dragon<br/>
  ideas that work.  We cleared the whole cavern out except Vox,<br/>
  perfectly.  It&#39;s just Vox made an unexpected appearance.<br/>
