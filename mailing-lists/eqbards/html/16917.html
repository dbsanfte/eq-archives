<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyway I dont know if it was his lousy taunt or if bard songs ultra aggro<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard a lot of paladins complain about how weak their taunt is.<br/>
I have a (Very low) paladin. But do not know firsthand about this yet.<br/>
I also am not sure if that weak taunt comes from the cap not being<br/>
as high as other classes (which means that it would only affect things<br/>
at high levels) or if it actually is less effective all the way up.<br/>
But I try to remember, when grouped with a paladin that doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to be taunting, that this is a common complaint of paladins both on<br/>
the Paladins of Norrath board, and in game. And give them the benefit<br/>
of the doubt on this issue (at least until I get my paladin up to the level<br/>
I can determine for myself...)<br/>
