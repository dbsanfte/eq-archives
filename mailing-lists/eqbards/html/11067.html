<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151921221">If they made it more fun to get those innumerable xp to get to levels above<br/>
35, more people would stay.  Why not give more xp for high level questing?<br/>
There are innumerable things they could do to prevent high level xp from<br/>
only coming via many hours of cramped camping.  Whether they will figure<br/>
that out before it is too late to save many of those players or not remains<br/>
to be seen.<br/>

Well, they had to slug through a lot of other problems making the whole<br/>
world come together - and making it work on 15 or 20 servers all synch&#39;d to<br/>
some kinda version control system.  What I think happened is that what they<br/>
saw in beta was incorrectly interpreted:<br/>
<br/>
some gamers find stuff and use it to gain xp = &quot;oh they are exploiting we<br/>
will fix that&quot;<br/>
nerf<br/>
<br/>
some gamers find new ways to use tricks to gain xp = &quot;oh they are exploiting<br/>
we will fix that - normal players will never do that&quot;<br/>
nerf<br/>
<br/>
rinse, repeat<br/>
<br/>
&quot;ok, beta is over folks - thanks for all your help! say good bye now cus we<br/>
are gonna delete your chars (again - hehe)&quot;<br/>
<br/>

some gamers find stuff and use it to gain xp - post it on their web site and<br/>
everyone does it = &quot;oh they are exploiting we will fix that&quot;<br/>

They did not or maybe even could not have anticipated the success of their<br/>
product and the desire for the player to &quot;win&quot; even as it means enduring<br/>
endless hours of boredom.  And it&#39;s this boredom and the needless &#39;hell&#39;<br/>
levels that will turn away the casual to medium level players.  At some<br/>
point, if you develop a game where the players compete against AI, you need<br/>
to decide how many people you will allow to win.<br/>
<br/>
I contend as I have in the past that they should not make it harder to get<br/>
to level 50 - but they should make it more fun for everyone to get there.<br/>
That is if they want to maximize their their player base retention.  If<br/>
their model is: get to 50 or get frustrated and get out - then what they<br/>
have is just fine.  Right now its real hard to break thru 35 and keep going<br/>
on my server - one because of the game design itself and how hard it is to<br/>
get xp without hours and hours played.  And two because there is a big bunch<br/>
of player right at or near my level (mid 30&#39;s) Lower Guk on a popular night:<br/>
70 players vs 40 or 50 froggies?  Solb - same deal.  Kith was a good try but<br/>
has been kinda fizzled becuz of too much insty-death situations although I<br/>
have not been there in a week (becuz nobody else was in the zone to even get<br/>
a group going).<br/>
<br/>
What the heck is so hard to understand: make the game more fun and people<br/>
will play it more - and pay.  Make the game harder and more frustrating and<br/>
people will leave - in droves.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a run down:<br/>
<br/>
Azmo - 35 frustrated and stopped cus he cant get decent xp in 2 hours a<br/>
night<br/>
Aejis - Azmo&#39;s friend quit now too cuz his friend is not there to play with<br/>
Bate - cut back cuz Azmo and Ae are not on - so he is roughing it with<br/>
pick-up groups<br/>
Skwid - quit a couple months ago after a nerf that made his war get less xp<br/>
- also a casual play for an hour or two type<br/>
&quot;mr x&quot; - raised a player to 20&#39;s and got frustrated with slow xp for casual<br/>
play - bought an ebay account - not playing either one much - prolly bz<br/>
working<br/>
thrifmir - raised a wiz to mid 20&#39;s - went away on business for 2 weeks and<br/>
came back to most of his friends too high to group with - so now hes not<br/>
playing any more<br/>
sylly - still here ;p<br/>
nadare - level 48 enchanter<br/>
xaera - level 50 SK as of 2 days ago<br/>
moods - level 50 Cleric as of 3 days ago<br/>
<br/>
So out of 10 - 3 make the end by hard core power gaming, 1 or 2 struggle on<br/>
and the other half quit?  What kind of ongoing community will you have when<br/>
you suffer a 50% loss getting &quot;winners&quot; and then have huge loss rates among<br/>
the &quot;winners&quot;???  &quot;Welcome to level 50 - the level of nothing to do!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These are issues that they did not seem to think of - I can understand that<br/>
they had their hands full with lots of other issues building the world and<br/>
the game but I do have some fundamental concerns.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time - I really need to get level 38, 39 and 40.  Really.<br/>

		Still and all, I wish Verant would have given a little more<br/>
forethought to <br/>
		what would happen down the road to the high end players.  I<br/>
suspect many <br/>
		more ppl will leave the game in the coming months.<br/>
