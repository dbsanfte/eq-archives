You cannot directly affect any NPCs in the game, so standing<br/>
by without taking action is your only recourse.  Unless you<br/>
want to duel the person over it.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the problem.  I&#39;m getting really tired of eating other<br/>
people&#39;s faction.  And I&#39;m not talking about gnolls.  Yesterday<br/>
some idiot necromancer kited one of those Barbarian Villagers<br/>
by my party near T3.  I&#39;m singing Clarity, so somehow I must be<br/>
helping someone, somewhere.  I take faction hits from that kiter&#39;s<br/>
kill.  I really like Halas, and I never kill barbarians.  So I<br/>
immediately cruised into Blackburrow for a stack of gnoll teeth<br/>
to turn into the Pit of Doom.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t realize that faction adjustments are a _HUGE_ part<br/>
of what you can and cannot do in this game.  For example, if you<br/>
are ever considering wiping out Holly Windstalker or Cros Treewind<br/>
because they /con blue and you are bored, you had beter think again.<br/>
The faction adjustments those two carry alone, will make you KOS<br/>
in 3 or 4 cities... instantly, one kill, and blam.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you in beta that saw the numeric adjustments, you know<br/>
what I mean.  In beta, if you kill a gnoll pup you got +1 to the<br/>
guards of qeynos.  However, if you killed a good guard you got -50<br/>
to the guards of qeynos.  You would have to kill 50 gnolls to make<br/>
up for one qeynos guard.  So factions vary in intensity everywhere,<br/>
which doesn&#39;t click with a lot of people.  They see one message, and<br/>
think they&#39;ve taken -1 or +1 hit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still not sure how we get unearned faction, when clearly we <br/>
havent assisted another player in any other way.  This ties in<br/>
with &#39;Bard Hate&#39; if you think about it.  The game must have thought<br/>
I did something to earn the faction, thus I must have triggered<br/>
something in the monster to irritate them.  If this was a real<br/>
monster, and not a Barbarian NPC, I bet it would have turned on me.<br/>
