<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560911321"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   It&#39;s the booby drop from the ghoul lord.  Usually when you go to<br/>
&gt;   fight the ghoul lord, you aren&#39;t after the helm.  So when it appears,<br/>
&gt;   it&#39;s like:  Aww man, he dropped the friggin helm, that sucks.  So,<br/>
&gt;   to answer the question, the SSB is the common drop.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this, everyone wants the ghoul lord to drop a ykesha, but<br/>
it&#39;s a really nice helm. I only wear the Crown of Frogluk Kings because<br/>
I refuse to wear a plate helm, being a female wood elf, and the Crown<br/>
has no Graphic. I wore an Exectuioner&#39;s Hood before the Crown, and it<br/>
also has very nice stats and is relatively easy to get. For a bard, I<br/>
think I&#39;d prefer the Hood, but I think for the price you paid for the<br/>
barbute, that was a real win, and certainly a great upgrade from steel.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; the Crown of the Froglok Kings, and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I heard of a L40 full group holding the tower on live side.<br/>
&gt;   Anything less than that I think you&#39;d be asking for trouble.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A L40ish group that knows what they are doing can hold the tower on live<br/>
side, but the tower contains the frogluk priest and the crusader. The<br/>
frogluk King is much deeper, and his room when fully spawned is<br/>
something like this line up..<br/>
Frogluk King (L49 Paladin w/LoH etc)/Frogluk Guk Knight (L48/49<br/>
Warrior)/Jin Frogluk Shaman (L48-49 Shaman) on the throne<br/>
<br/>
4 Bok Frogluk Knights (L42-46 Warriors), can have Kor Frog Shamen<br/>
(L42ish shamen) in their spots<br/>
<br/>
Overlooking the room can be the tactician, a L48-50 frog wizard, and yes<br/>
he will cast Gravity Flux and recently Ice Comet&#39;d (OWWWW)<br/>
<br/>
and a few others.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done the Frog King area with a group of 6 L49-50, the trick as<br/>
always is breaking the spawn, then keeping a steady pace of pulling. You<br/>
must have an exceptional puller. You can also successfully do this room<br/>
with 12 L40-45 people, but be wary of that tactician, because he&#39;ll drop<br/>
a L40 fast, and give you flashbacks of dying to a festering hag at L20.<br/>
:(<br/>
<br/>
The Crown is the King&#39;s common drop btw (rare is the Mithril 2Hander),<br/>
and I&#39;ve begun seeing them for sale/trade on our server. They are not<br/>
that great stat-wise, I think AC 10 +20 fire/cold, and give light like a<br/>
greater lightstone. The fire/cold saves are awesome for dragon raids<br/>
however. :)<br/>
