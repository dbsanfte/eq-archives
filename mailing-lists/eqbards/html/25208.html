<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-11477449">allakhazam lists this item at 18K.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe 10K is more realistic.  Here&#39;s why:<br/>
<br/>
FBSS is only haste and goes for 8K (average price)<br/>
<br/>
This item has AC and +3 to **ALL** resists.  The<br/>
resists make it a great item for dragon raids.<br/>
(And for that reason you might want to just keep this<br/>
item...)  <br/>
<br/>
The item is rare at the moment and that may<br/>
artifically increase the price.<br/>
<br/>
Is haste broken?  I would make a point of testing<br/>
that.  ALSO, a guy on this list posted last year that<br/>
any haste item, regardless of percentages and a bard<br/>
speedup song resulted in a 75% speed increase.  <br/>
<br/>
His name was John Kim and he backed this up with<br/>
posted statistics.  You may want to check the archives<br/>
for that information.   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my thought:  even if haste doesn&#39;t work<br/>
normally, does it make the jump to 75% with bard haste<br/>
song?  I would test this to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck and good hunting to you,<br/>

&gt; Well Im an old bard with limited playtime and<br/>
&gt; terribly unlucky when it comes<br/>
&gt; to rolls *grin*. However I got lucky and got some<br/>
&gt; &quot;Silver Chitin Hand Wraps&quot;<br/>
&gt; this weekend. The stats are:<br/>
&gt; +5 AC +3 vsMg +3 vsFire +3 vsCold +3 vsPos +3 vsDis<br/>
&gt; effect: Haste (reported<br/>
&gt; broken)<br/>
&gt; Now I wonder what I should do? Should I try to sell<br/>
&gt; them? (How much will<br/>
&gt; they be worth?) Should I keep it for the haste<br/>
&gt; when/if it get fixed? If I<br/>
&gt; sell em should I sell them before or after they get<br/>
&gt; fixed? I only have<br/>
&gt; around 1-2kpp in the bank so these hand wraps is a<br/>
&gt; nice oppotunity for me to<br/>
&gt; get something upgraded..<br/>
&gt; Any advice will be appriciated..<br/>
