<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522007504">its simple really, it means that 69% of the % of women play with their<br/>
significant other,<br/>
<br/>
so as an example, lets say 80% of the playerbase (of 100 people) is male,<br/>
that would mean 20% is female.<br/>
if 69% of 20% of the women play with their significant other, that would<br/>
mean 13 women play with their hubbies. meaning 16% of those 80 men play with<br/>
their significant other.<br/>
<br/>
That clear things up?<br/>

Skimming the article, a bizarre statistical quirk appears...69% of women<br/>
play<br/>
with a &quot;romantic partner&quot;, while only 16% of men do.<br/>
<br/>
So who the hell are the partners the additional 53% of women are playing<br/>
with? Shouldn&#39;t the two numbers for the two sexes be nearly identical? Are<br/>
52% of the women lesbians, 26% playing with the other 26%?<br/>
<br/>
More likely this shows the invalidity of the entire survey, because the<br/>
voters are self-selecting, and a different kind of female chooses to waste<br/>
his time taking the survey than male. My wife not only wouldn&#39;t take it, but<br/>
(she&#39;s quite controlling, and our greatest source of tension is that I<br/>
cannot<br/>
be controlled) she actually complained that I was wasting time when she saw<br/>
me taking it.<br/>
