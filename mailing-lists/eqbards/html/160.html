<div id="ygrps-yiv-523715291"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Could someone please let me know what Warsong gives you (exactly) and<br/>
&gt; what instrument it uses?  Please include your level and skill in sing/<br/>
&gt; instrument (if any) if possible.  I am curious as to whether it is<br/>
&gt; worth the boat ride to purchase this song for the small amount of<br/>
&gt; soloing I do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It uses singing as its skill (or whistling really).  I don&#39;t recall the<br/>
exact stat increase, but it is very similar to the one provided by<br/>
Anthem de Arms.  It also increases your attack speed.  Given that it<br/>
also stacks with Anthem de Arms (and others), I definately recommend<br/>
making the boat ride to buy it (though I thought it was for sale pretty<br/>
much everywhere).  As I said in an earlier email, I still use it daily.<br/>
