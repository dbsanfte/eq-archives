&gt;What are Bards best suited for as they gain levels?  My combat isn&#39;t too<br/>
&gt;bad..maybe like a Rogue?  And the songs are just too cool...I love<br/>
&gt;wandering around with a spell up all the time...whichever I choose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do we also get songs at every level?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome whomever you are (where&#39;s your name?) :-)  Also, have you played EQ <br/>
before or are you brand spanking new?<br/>

I&#39;ve never played a newbie in the Qeynos area, so I don&#39;t have much advice <br/>
regarding quests. Also I&#39;ve never played on a pvp server, so I don&#39;t know <br/>
how hard it is for a newbie bard to survive.<br/>
<br/>
The main drawback to gaining levels via quests, is that you are unable to <br/>
develop your fighting skills, which, on a pvp server, I would think is <br/>
extremely important. Always keep singing your songs to build up your <br/>
singing skill where ever you go.<br/>
<br/>
Jig of Vigor is very helpful for you as you can jump-run to get away from <br/>
people/creatures. Just make sure your stamina doesn&#39;t go down too low when <br/>
doing this. Jig will help recover the stamina, but not enough for you to <br/>
constantly jump. Also, until you get your Accelerando at level 5, if you <br/>
need to run from an NPC, make sure you slide-run. Meaning you press your <br/>
&quot;forward&quot; key along with your &lt;ctrl&gt; and either &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; key. Due <br/>
to pathing, you will be able to outrun standard speed NPC&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
For general combat, get used to weaving songs. You should be weaving your <br/>
Chant of Battle with your Chords of Dissonance. But you&#39;ll need to keep an <br/>
eye out since Chords is a short range AOE song and will aggro other things. <br/>
Make sure, after battle, that you are no longer singing Chords or you might <br/>
make a guard or vendor angry.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to keep us posted on your goings on. It&#39;d be interesting to see <br/>
how a bard does on a PVP server.<br/>
