&gt; Bronze is found in Unrest, and you can easily buy it there from higher<br/>
&gt; level players who loot it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has the same AC and slightly less weight than the platemail that you can<br/>
&gt; buy from merchants.<br/>

platemail but is MUCH heavier to somewhat heavier, depending on the piece.<br/>
<br/>
It is, however, much cheaper.  I bought my bronze helm for 30 plat, while a store<br/>
purchased helm would have cost me several hundred.<br/>
<br/>
Bronze is also orange instead of silver.<br/>
