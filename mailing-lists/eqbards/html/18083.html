<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-373885186">I dunno if they are in (maybe random drops in Sky like some of the caster <br/>
spells? *shrug*), but I would like to know if anyone has found any of them. <br/>
Like many of you I will most likely be hitting 51 shortly after logging in <br/>
on Monday, and I WANT Song 51 ASAP! =) If the song truly is a 75% speed <br/>
increase + levitate + invis + see invis, well as far as Kunark and it&#39;s huge <br/>
zones are concerned, it will be the best thing since Wonderbread. If anyone <br/>
gets info on where and how to obtain our new songs please post here as soon <br/>
as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeh, killed Maestro tonight, only had Mempo. Not complaining tho - our <br/>
monk needs it for when he is spotting on hamburger hill at the Fear portal <br/>
(damn blind monkeys). =)<br/>
