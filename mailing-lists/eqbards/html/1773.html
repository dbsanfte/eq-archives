&gt;Hi, first time caller, long time listener (hehe).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have one thing to say.. roleplay.. it is what you want<br/>
&gt;to make (ie. &#39;roleplay&#39;).  If you are a wizard (or a bard<br/>
&gt;in this case), you would generally not wear items such<br/>
&gt;as platemail as it&#39;s weight and restrictivness in movement<br/>
&gt;would hinder the caster&#39;s ability; however, it doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt;that they couldn&#39;t equip/wear the item, it just would<br/>
&gt;introduce a possibilty of penalties (ie. more difficult<br/>
&gt;to cast successfully through lower dex and lower agility).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Should Clerics, Paladins, Shadowknights and Rangers also suffer this same<br/>
penalty when casting in Plate, or are you recommending a Bard-only penalty?<br/>
<br/>
