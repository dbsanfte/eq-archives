<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Song of Twilight stackability <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046372960"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I was trying to experiment with Song of Twilight stacking with enchanter<br/>
&gt;mez.  Does anyone know how they work together.  Our thoughts (I was with my<br/>
&gt;new guild&#39;s big enchanter killing imps and discussing this.  She had to log<br/>
&gt;before we got to test it) were if I could lay down a SoT or 2 until the<br/>
&gt;chanters got the mobs locked down, it would be a huge boon for raids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does SoT block any/all enchanter mez?<br/>
&gt;Does it overwrite?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It completely blocks it. :(  Someone mentioned it might get fixed soon. <br/>
Let&#39;s hope so.<br/>

&gt;I will try to test this on my own, but how often do you have a lvl 60<br/>
&gt;enchanter at your disposal?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Almost daily and we have to deal with this more often than I like, but many <br/>
times it has kept him from getting killed. =)<br/>

&gt;Sartori<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DOH.... Them&#39;s fightin words. Don&#39;t worry, I will be practicing lots with <br/>
Crip and Creediki in the Arena as soon as they announce it. Crip&#39;s the one <br/>
that worries me. :)<br/>
