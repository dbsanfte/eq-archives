<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Rogues and bards (was Why didn&#39;t I log out sooner?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940978793">That used to happen to my bard all the time before the reduced our agro<br/>
effect.<br/>
I was always the first to die.  I really laughed at Abashi&#39;s suggestion that<br/>
sometimes bards needed to back out of combat or stop singing.  Half the time<br/>
I would be killed before I hit the mob!  By the time it was apparent I<br/>
should back out there was no power on Norrath capable of getting the mob off<br/>
me short of an Ice Comet.  Back off and stop singing hah!<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have charm I can taunt any mob off anyone.  I even taunted one<br/>
off a ranger who was down to 7hps.  The giant proceeded to beat me down to 2<br/>
bubbles while the ranger happily smacked away knowing that even in his<br/>
condition the mob was stuck on me for the duration.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;cringe!&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what happens when someone takes pity on me and invites me to group:<br/>
1) They attack mob 2) I get within agro radius and put my hand near<br/>
auto-attack key 3) mob turns on me and knocks me down to 80% heath 4) I<br/>
scream &quot;Get it off&quot; 5) mob gets me down to 40% health and refuses to turn<br/>
around  6) Groupmate hits mob with everything they&#39;ve got (or attempts to<br/>
heal me) 7) LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps when I hit higher levels some class somewhere will be able to taunt<br/>
a mob off me.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
