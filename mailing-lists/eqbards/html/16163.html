&gt; Ok, we already know that charming a mob clears the damage list<br/>
&gt; but (probably) not the hate list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Being charmed *by* a mob clears you from the charmer&#39;s hate<br/>
&gt; list.  I (foolishly :) tried to see if I could solo the<br/>
&gt; froglok noble in Lower Guk.  I got 4 attempts at it before<br/>
&gt; giving up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First try, I used my standard lineup - equip lute, Hymn +<br/>
&gt; Niv&#39;s + CoC + CoD.  No good.  He nuked me to half, then<br/>
&gt; charmed me.  I scurried off while charmed, and when it broke I<br/>
&gt; was outside his aggro radius.  He didn&#39;t come after me.  But<br/>
&gt; his pet (whom I&#39;d damaged with my DoTs) did.  I feared them<br/>
&gt; and made it to the zone with about a bubble left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Second try, I switched to Hymn + Niv&#39;s + CoC + Mystic<br/>
&gt; Shielding, on the theory that my 125 magic resist would help<br/>
&gt; me resist some of his nukes and charm.  It worked for the<br/>
&gt; first two nukes (resisted), then his third nuke took off two<br/>
&gt; bubbles.  I feared them, ran for the zone while invis, a<br/>
&gt; see-invis mino attacked me, and I made it to the zone with<br/>
&gt; 138 hp left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Third try, I tried weapons + Chain + Fear.  This eliminated<br/>
&gt; the pet as a factor (of the two fear-paths, the priest/<br/>
&gt; crusader area was camped, and the area towards the maze was<br/>
&gt; all green to me), and if I could consistently keep up<br/>
&gt; Chain/Fear, it would eliminate his spells as a factor (very<br/>
&gt; annoying since enchanter DDs also have a stun that will<br/>
&gt; interrupt your songs).  Both Chain and fear ended up being<br/>
&gt; resisted too much, he nuked me to half, then charmed me.<br/>
&gt; After the charm wore off, he was outside aggro radius, and the<br/>
&gt; pet didn&#39;t attack me again (presumably because I hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; damaged it).  I didn&#39;t have to zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fourth try, on the theory that I&#39;d just gotten unlucky with<br/>
&gt; resists, I tried weapons + Chain + fear again.  Only this<br/>
&gt; time, I put up Mystic Shielding before pulling him (most of<br/>
&gt; the damage I was took before came from the first couple<br/>
&gt; nukes).  Basically the same result - he resisted me too much<br/>
&gt; for this to be consistent.  Strangely enough this time, after<br/>
&gt; I was charmed, his pet continued to attack me.  :)  Haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; figured that one out.  Anyhow, because I was fighting his pet<br/>
&gt; while charmed, I didn&#39;t scurry out of aggro range, and when<br/>
&gt; charm broke he was on me and hit me for 102 with his staff.<br/>
&gt; I feared them all again and made it to the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At this point, I gave up.  I didn&#39;t have enough confidence in<br/>
&gt; my melee to be able to Fear/Chain him consistently with his<br/>
&gt; resist rate.  With a max melee damage of 100+, I doubted I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; be able to survive the occasional resist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The entire live side of Lower Guk was empty at 7am.  No<br/>
&gt; players were harmed during these tests.  :)<br/>
