&gt; I am pretty sure GZ stated at one time our Dot songs are all 3 ticks.  One<br/>
&gt; odd behaviour I noticed with them is that the debuff effect/Icon will<br/>
&gt; sometime disappear before the final pulse of damage is applied.  But this my<br/>
&gt; be a client refresh thing.  I found this behaviour while self testing the<br/>
&gt; songs on side by side computers (yes I bought a second account just to test<br/>
&gt; songs, sad heh).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure the effect icons are entirely client-side, and<br/>
have no basis in reality (what the server thinks).  You&#39;ll<br/>
notice that in those long lag bubbles, your icons will drop.  <br/>
But if the effect is server-side (e.g. Hymn), the effect is<br/>
still there (hp still increment).<br/>
<br/>
I think the way it works is your client sends a &quot;starting this<br/>
song&quot; message to the server.  The server sends back an &quot;ok,<br/>
starting this song&quot; message (aka &quot;your feet move faster&quot;),<br/>
which causes the client to put up the icon.  The icon stays<br/>
for two heartbeats (somehow synchronized with the server, but<br/>
timed locally).  So if you yank the network cable, the icon<br/>
disappears on its own at the appropriate time.  If there&#39;s any<br/>
server-side lag, this can cause the client/server to get out<br/>
of synch, causing icons to disappear locally before the server<br/>
ends the effect.<br/>
