&gt; Just looking for some advice is all. From the what has been posted,<br/>
&gt; it seems Sylly has had luck with piercing weapons (low damage/delay)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, my piercing skill is... one. So, any advice on good<br/>
&gt; slashers or blunt weapons? ( I have a feeling blunt weapons are<br/>
&gt; adjusted by Verant to have lower damage/delay ratios than equivalent<br/>
&gt; slashing weapons. )<br/>

I used a Barbed Leather Whip and Dragoon Dirk until late 20&#39;s when I looted<br/>
a 1H Silvery Axe.  The Dirk has the best dam/delay ratio of any weapon even<br/>
close to how easy it is to obtain.  I keep at least 1 of each type (1H<br/>
slash, 1H Blunt, Piercing) on my Bard at all times and rotate them<br/>
regularly, trying to keep ALL my skills maxed.  There are some good weapons<br/>
of ALL types around and you never know which will be available to you.<br/>
Start early by keeping your skills maxed and you&#39;ll be ready to use whatever<br/>
the best weapon is available to you at that time.  With dual wield this is<br/>
even easier to do, being able to work on 2 skill types at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention that you should raise your piercing skill? : )<br/>
