<div id="ygrps-yiv-664455507">Eh, the market&#39;s flooded with the Dirks now, least in Faydark.  Bought a few<br/>
already for 20pp.  When the dirk becomes rarer (not on Dvinn&#39;s corpse every<br/>
single time) one should get an excellent return, especially since the dirk<br/>
is on par with a well-balanced weapon.  There will -always- be someone in<br/>
Qeynos who will pay well over what I pay for it in Faydark now.<br/>

&gt;The thing I like about combines better than the other weapons is the resale<br/>
&gt;value.  You purchase a Dragoon Dirk now for 40 plat, in a couple of months<br/>
&gt;when you get tired of it you won&#39;t get much of a return because of players </span></blockquote></div>
