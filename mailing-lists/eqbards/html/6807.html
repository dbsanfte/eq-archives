 </span></blockquote>If you are old enough to survive lower guk live side go on down and get one<br/>
for free hon! Most folks camp the eye for one reason only..the mana stone. I<br/>
have seen so many bags go to waste.......announce at the zone your looking<br/>
for a bag and most hunters will holler out free bag at such and such Loc. If<br/>
you are NOT old enough you might be able to sweet talk an older person on<br/>
your server into giving you their bag since they are camping the eye... I<br/>
know my group had a teleport bound to the eye location when we camped it for<br/>
a mana stone, and we just kept gating in and out passing the bags out to<br/>
friends.<br/>
