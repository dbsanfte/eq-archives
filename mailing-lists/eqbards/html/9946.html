&gt; What, John made a mathematical error?  I am flabbergasted!  Its actually<br/>
&gt; safer than 1.414x by a long shot so long as you are 1.414x melee range from<br/>

&gt; the trees as they run into them but you will not be.  This allows one to<br/>
&gt; outrun some Mob&#39;s without using accellerando in heavily forested areas if<br/>
&gt; the MOB is close to your speed (like orcs).  I call this scraping the tail<br/>
&gt; off on a tree.  Of course one miscalculation where you run into the tree and<br/>
&gt; they are on top of you.<br/>

some extra distance between you and the mob.<br/>
