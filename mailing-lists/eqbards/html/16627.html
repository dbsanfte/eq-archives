<div id="ygrps-yiv-220109013"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The Hermit is 20th, not 24th.  He sometimes spawns at 21st, but not often.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, corrected it, sorry for the bad info.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On Fennin Ro he spawns every three minutes, and it&#39;s been the same since I<br/>
&gt;moved to Druzzil Ro.  I&#39;ve been camping him recently too with my 22nd<br/>
&gt;Enchanter.  Three minutes is really nice because you have to hustle to med<br/>
&gt;and heal up in time for the next one if you want to catch him without his<br/>
&gt;damage shield.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrmph, when I asked I was told eight, I never bothered to time it myself,<br/>
and as I have very poor linear time sense 8 could have been 3 *laughs*<br/>
again, sorry for trhe bad info.<br/>
