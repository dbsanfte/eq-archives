<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096142033">Hmmm, that might go a long way towards last night&#39;s experience in the ass<br/>
sup room of guk.<br/>
<br/>
It was an ok party, 2 pallys, 1 sk, 1 cleric, 1 wizzy and me. Level range<br/>
was 34-39. We were doing fairly well for a while. The pallys and Sk didn&#39;t<br/>
seem to have full grasp of the word assist, however that has become an all<br/>
too common situation given how few enchanters seems to be about.<br/>
<br/>
The Sk (level 39) was our puller and I asked if we were pulling sav too. He<br/>
said we can do that and he runs off to pull. He came back with the sav, 3<br/>
wizzies and 4 knights. I didn&#39;t live long. (first to die) Naturally with a<br/>
pull of those proportions and the bard dead (ie, no fear song) everyone<br/>
died.<br/>
<br/>
It takes this ass backwards party 45 minutes to get going again. (By which<br/>
time I was very pissed) I told them to res in the room since we had 20<br/>
minutes to respawn at the time of the incident. However no one listened to<br/>
me and I finally got a res at the zone line after granting permission to<br/>
have my corpse dragged. (at least it was an exp res from a nice nearby level<br/>
46 cleric) I disbanded to clarity the cleric and joined the group later to<br/>
rebreak the sup room. At this point half the party was waiting near the room<br/>
and the other half was at the zone. We got our invis to undead and headed<br/>
out. When I got to the supp ass room, the wiz and cleric were no longer with<br/>
me. (For some reason they stopped at the BR) The 3 tanks were chilling and<br/>
go to check the room when a wanderer happens by and attacks. Another joins<br/>
in and we are facing a zol and a wan. These IDIOTS (sorry, I&#39;m still sour<br/>
over it) jump on the wan. At this point I&#39;m not grouped with the tanks and I<br/>
should have just stayed out of it. Instead my helpful instinct kicks in and<br/>
I yell at them to invite me. They finally do. Now I&#39;m being pounded by the<br/>
zol while all 3 tanks are focused on the wan. I say I could use some help<br/>
here and they ignore me. I&#39;m down to 2 bubs of health and I repeat in all<br/>
caps HELP ME PLEASE, but my plea falls on deaf ears. I hit 1 bub of health<br/>
when the wizzie and cleric show up. At this point they are not grouped with<br/>
us so they have no idea of the situation. /say NEED HEAL NOW. Nothing. /say<br/>
HEAL HEAL. Nothing. I die seconds later. Grrrrr. Next time I&#39;m charming the<br/>
damn wan whether they want me to or not. That way the have to switch to the<br/>
zol.<br/>
<br/>
After recovering I promptly left the group and hunted the Evil Eye for fun<br/>
and profit. (5 bags, 2 azure sleeves over the course of the night. I won the<br/>
first two rolls upon joining the group, bag and then sleeves)<br/>
<br/>
They shouldn&#39;t allow fools into guk.<br/>

<br/>
As I said, not everyone comes out of HK affected by the bad habits it<br/>
encourages.  But, by and large, people who group up in the Highhold/highkeep<br/>
area tend to learn two things (at least on Veeshan):<br/>
<br/>
1)  KS is ok.  I&#39;m not sure how it is on other servers but on Veeshan just<br/>
about anything goes in the orc area of highpass.  It&#39;s a huge KS festival<br/>
where no matter how long you&#39;re fighting a mob those around you will do<br/>
their best to nuke it from under you.<br/>
<br/>
2)  It&#39;s ok to pull too much, the guards are just around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
3)  It&#39;s ok to train someone, the zone is very close and/or the guards are<br/>
nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Those are just the social attitudes.  The skills that a players don&#39;t learn<br/>
or don&#39;t learn well because of these situations are critical later in life.<br/>
In short:  You can&#39;t learn the skills needed to bust a difficult spawn in a<br/>
place where you can just Guard kill the extras unless you are in a<br/>
disciplined group who actually tries to learn them.<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time in highkeep myself and left because the zone offers no<br/>
challenge.  At 14-18 the gnolls are a lot of fun but the orcs are a KS<br/>
festival and the goblins inside highkeep are good XP but a lot of groups<br/>
tend to get lazy about pulling technique etc because safety is, litterly, a<br/>
stone&#39;s throw away.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an insult against anyone.  It&#39;s a fact about that zone.  And anyone<br/>
JUST out of highkeep who&#39;s allowed their group skills to stagnate is more<br/>
dangerous than someone who went through their twenties in, say, Solusek.<br/>
<br/>
Just my oppinion but a lot of people share it.<br/>
<br/>
And it may be very different on other servers.  But on veeshan the norm is<br/>
to see a group pull too much, kill 1 then take the rest to the guards, and<br/>
break the spawn using the guards to kill off anything they can&#39;t handle each<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually Highkeep is notorious for attracting &quot;dumb players&quot; or rather<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; creates them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The total safety of the hunting there causes people to learn terrible<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; &gt; tactics (or not learn any at all).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 99% of the time if I find myself grouped with someone who levelled<br/>
through<br/>
&gt; &gt; their upper 20&#39;s and lower 30&#39;s in highkeep I immediately leave the<br/>
group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not that ALL people who played there are bad, it&#39;s that most are.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; No offense to anyone who&#39;s hunted there religiously but HK just isn&#39;t<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same as SolA or GukTop or Cazic.<br/>
