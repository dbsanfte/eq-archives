<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003204454">Ouch,<br/>
Sounds like my night last night.  <br/>
<br/>
4PM.  Log on and find my friends are playing their<br/>
Bards too.  Meet up in Steamfont with them and another<br/>
friend who is a Ranger.  I&#39;m level 13, there are 2<br/>
level 11 Bards, and a Level 11 Ranger in the group<br/>
now.  Mino Caves.  Simple, they been conning Blue to<br/>
me since level 10.<br/>
<br/>
4:30 Enter Caves.  Nobody else has been in this zone. <br/>
The Ranger decides to pull (tracking).  Goes down a<br/>
corridor &quot;Hey...who is Meld.....&quot;  Hoarde of Guards<br/>
and Meldrath himself.<br/>
<br/>
NOW LOADING...<br/>
<br/>
Get together and head back to recover bodies.  Hear<br/>
shout of &quot;HERO OUT&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
NOW LOADING....<br/>
<br/>
Well Now...aint that something?  hehe.  Still in a<br/>
decent mood, not like I haven&#39;t died before.  <br/>
<br/>
Watch 5 more trains go by.  Meldrath in one, Hero in<br/>
another.  One is just like 5 Guards.  <br/>
Guards pick up on my trail.  Selo&#39;s...no drum (its<br/>
still on my corpse).  Make it to town.  Guards<br/>
actually KILL the mino train (YEA!) Exit<br/>
tunnel....&quot;HERO TO TOWN&quot;<br/>
<br/>
NOW LOADING....<br/>
<br/>
FORGET THIS....<br/>
Friend (level 11 Bard No 1) Logs on his Lev 32 Druid<br/>
for corpse recovery (the Ranger is way in).  I Have my<br/>
Lev 25 Cleric handy in this area (just in case).<br/>
<br/>
Recovery is made....FINALLY.  Everyone logs for dinner<br/>
(they are PST, I am EST) except me.<br/>
<br/>
8PM.  Forget about Mino caves.  Too many Trains now. <br/>
Time to head back to Antonica.<br/>
<br/>
8:30 Freeport, get a bind RIGHT AWAY (God Bless<br/>
Guildmates) and get ALL BUFFED UP.  Refuse offers to<br/>
bring on Cleric (everyone misses their band-aid since<br/>
I became addicted to Bard), and head to NRO for Dervs.<br/>
<br/>
Cant find ANYONE interested in a Bard for a Derv<br/>
group.  Not uncommon, most players don&#39;t realize how<br/>
useful a bard is until 20&#39;s (I sure didn&#39;t..but I<br/>
learned FAST then).  Hear a cry for help.  Some newbie<br/>
poisoned and dying on beach.<br/>
<br/>
Run along beach, find him....Group him up and play<br/>
Hymn with Lute.  Druid comes along and cures his<br/>
poison, while I restore his health.<br/>
<br/>
Newbie offers me a rusty two hander in payment (he is<br/>
level 5, not twinked...BIG GENEROUS OFFER from him).<br/>
I turn him down, and feel good.<br/>
<br/>
Shout once more for a group.  Druid replies that Croc<br/>
group is forming at Docks (levs 11 to 13).  Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Head to Oasis full speed and group up.  Pull with<br/>
Selo&#39;s (Druid doesnt have SOW yet) and buff with Chant<br/>
during battles, twisting with whatever situation calls<br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
Well...Started night one bubble from level 14.  Left<br/>
Steamfont one bubble INTO 14 (some random deaths from<br/>
trains not mentioned).  Left Oasis one bubble from 14<br/>
again.  Broke even and had a blast.  Met some nice<br/>
folks who REALLY appreciate what a bard can bring to a<br/>
group now.<br/>
<br/>
MORAL:  Forget the cleric, he&#39;s collecting dust. <br/>
Deaths and all, BARDS ARE TOO FUN.<br/>
