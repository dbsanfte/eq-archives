<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067761">Concentrate on keeping your skills maxxed in the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s.  Going by<br/>
memory, it seems to me that the high 20&#39;s to mid 30&#39;s, the skills raised<br/>
quickly still.  Melee skills particularly benefit from this, as during these<br/>
levels, you benefit more from haste, as more of those that you group with<br/>
have some kind of melee haste.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I recall it was in my mid-20&#39;s, I parked in Arena for a day.  When I<br/>
came back, I scrolled back, and there were always at least 2 skill increase<br/>
messages per &quot;screen&quot;...roughly, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, I&#39;ve left myself sit for hours at a time, and I&#39;ve felt lucky to<br/>
see 2 skill increases for the entire time standing there.<br/>
<br/>
Do it while you&#39;re young, because unless you spend enormous amounts of time<br/>
doing nothing but working on those skills, you will likely fall behind once<br/>
you&#39;re in the late 40&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Just my observations.<br/>

 You should try to keep all your skills maxed.  For weapons it helps you hit<br/>
and for instruments it allows successful playing of your notes (and better<br/>
twisting).  You&#39;ll see this very clearly at level 18 when you get your first<br/>
brass song...<br/>
