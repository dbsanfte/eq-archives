<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063021179">Anyone wandered around Kilthkor lately?  Saw some<br/>
names just hanging in the air.  Shadow men.   Targeted<br/>
one, conned blue.  Five of them, one of me, so I did<br/>
the smart thing, I charmed one then ran like hell.  My<br/>
motto to this point has been, if you can&#39;t be safe, be<br/>
fast.  But for the first time since I got the speed<br/>
song, something odd happened.  At level 30, with the<br/>
Mistmoor Drum, I was getting hit from behind.  A lot. <br/>
For 30-50pts each.  That was a new and frighting<br/>
experiance.  I&#39;m hoping it was a bug.  Zoned out with<br/>
half a bubble and a racing heart.  Anyone else take on<br/>
these little inviso guys?  I hear there&#39;s more stuff<br/>
now in our spooky liitle woods, can anyone verify.<br/>
