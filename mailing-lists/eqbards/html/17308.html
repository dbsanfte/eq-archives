<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444538448">I think Windsong is a cool name, if perhaps<br/>
overused... My ingame husband has that surname and i<br/>
think he is a little disappointed with me for not<br/>
changing mine... Nothing wrong with the name. I just<br/>
like mine better. I told him he was welcome to change<br/>
his... And to show how Bardic I was feeling, (ie...<br/>
um.. casual..) ;) My RL husband almost chose Moonwind<br/>
for his name,, but we thought ppl might get the wrong<br/>
impression when the three of us are running around<br/>
together...<br/>
