answer it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this is true, but my experience with live roleplaying rules systems<br/>
says that your arguments must be based on out of game reasoning and<br/>
balance, not in-game culture, history, and racial characteristics.  In-game<br/>
reasoning does have importance and must be considered, but since we&#39;re<br/>
creating an artificial world out-of-game constraints must take precedence.<br/>
<br/>
If there is any chance of persuading Verant to open the bard class to dark<br/>
elves, the argument must be based on game balance.  Once you have a<br/>
persuasive position there, inventing the in-game explanations for the way<br/>
things are is easy and fun and somewhat unnecessary, since people will do<br/>
it themselves even if you supply canned explanations.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with accomplishing your goal is prying information out<br/>
of Verant.  They may have the killer out-of-game argument for the way<br/>
things are or they may not have thought very deeply about it.  Making that<br/>
sort of determination in the face of Verant&#39;s general lack of communication<br/>
will be somewhere between difficult and impossible unless you can find the<br/>
right nerve to hit and actually get a response as we do from J.M. on some<br/>
topics.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I find attempts to communicate with Verant extremely<br/>
frustrating.  For the most part people there, including J.M., don&#39;t even<br/>
acknowledge most questions or suggestions, so you have no clue when they&#39;re<br/>
even listening, much less what light they may be able to shed.<br/>
