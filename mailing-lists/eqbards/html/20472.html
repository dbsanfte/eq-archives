<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092369137">I think there might be something else going on too.  I was in LoIO earlier<br/>
this week and saw an Iksar Exile walking by with a Icebone Skellie walking<br/>
about 100 yds behind.  I decided to mez the Exile until the skellie caught<br/>
up then charm the skellie to kill the Exile.  I hit the Exile with the Pixie<br/>
Strike.  The Exile didn&#39;t resist but immediately came over and started<br/>
pounding on me.  I went ahead and meleed him until the Skel caught up.<br/>
Thirteen seconds or so after the original Pixie Strike I got a message<br/>
saying that it had worn off.<br/>

My charisma is 135 with items.  I was only getting about 10% total resists,<br/>
but another 35% secondary resists like those from Lullaby.</div>
