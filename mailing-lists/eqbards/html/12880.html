<div id="ygrps-yiv-452611445">Just wondering what happened on the official EQ Board after this message was<br/>
posted last week.  I assume there were a lot of followup replies, especially<br/>
on the lullaby/pixie issue.  Did anyone from Verant provide any followup<br/>
responses?<br/>

&gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt; I took the original post with all the questions about bards and delivered <br/>
&gt; them directy to Geoffrey Zatkin, the Arch-Mage of Norrath. He was kind <br/>
&gt; enough to reply with a very well thought-out response, which is below in <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s entirety.<br/>
