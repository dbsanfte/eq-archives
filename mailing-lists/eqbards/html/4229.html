&gt; &gt; &gt; The way I see it, if the primary character gives an item or two to his<br/>

&gt; &gt;                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; character) this would have no effect on &quot;the line&quot; what so ever.  YThe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; line&#39;s length, as well as your position in it, remain unchanged.  If<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes, and we all know you can get rubicite without camping<br/>
&gt; &gt; explicitly for it.  *snicker*<br/>

&gt; You sure have a knack for tacking things out of context and twisting them<br/>
&gt; around, John. Even if it&#39;s only in jest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*I&#39;m* taking things out of context?  When this thing first<br/>
started, I leveled the charge that harvest-twinkers who camped<br/>
at a site to get extra items or items they couldn&#39;t use for<br/>
their other lesser characters were bad for the game. Then all<br/>
of a sudden three or four people started saying I was wrong<br/>
because they&#39;re twinking with items they&#39;re not using anymore<br/>
with their main characters.  I don&#39;t know if I was too vague<br/>
in my original statements, or if these people are grasping at<br/>
whatever straws they can to justify twinking.<br/>
<br/>
Please, reread what I&#39;ve written.  I&#39;ve not only said<br/>
&quot;twinking&quot; items that you don&#39;t use anymore is fine, I&#39;ve said<br/>
I even do it myself on occasion!  I made the followup to your<br/>
post in exasperation because yet another person took what *I*<br/>
wrote out of context, not the other way around.  (Again, I<br/>
don&#39;t know if the fault is mine for not being clear enough - I<br/>
apologize if it was.)<br/>
