I heard there was a way to cheat at the &quot;/random 100&quot; method of lottos too<br/>
but I have no clue how people are doing this.  I have seen people joking<br/>
around and they type &quot;/random 100 100&quot; so the range is basically 100-100 and<br/>
if you aren&#39;t paying close attention it could slip past you but I&#39;m not<br/>
aware of other methods to &quot;cheat&quot; at this.  I&#39;d be curious to know how I may<br/>
have been cheated and what methods are used so as to recognize it happening.<br/>
<br/>
As a result I have been doing a &quot;seed&quot; type lotto method, if you have not<br/>
seen this used yet chances are you will soon.  One person, usually the group<br/>
leader is designated the master looter for rare drops.  Since we get loot<br/>
messages now there is no way to sneakily get around everyone knowing what<br/>
the loot is.  The looter then rolls &quot;/random 100 1000&quot; which returns a<br/>
number like 695 for example (range of 100-1000).  This number becomes the<br/>
&quot;Seed&quot; number and everyone then rolls 0-seed for the loot.  For example,<br/>
&quot;/random 695&quot; and then the highest roll takes the loot.<br/>

&gt; you are lucky. There is a way to cheat at that style of<br/>
&gt; random lottoing.<br/>
&gt; I always prefer the 0-5 by alpha method.(Example aamberl would be 0<br/>
&gt; james would be 1 Martyn 2 suzu 3 xyly 4 zenon 5) Randomer<br/>
&gt; types /random 0 5<br/>

&gt; I got my Flowing Black Silk Sash last night, and I only had<br/>
&gt; to camp an hour<br/>
&gt; for it. I got invited into the Frenzie group at about 7pm, we<br/>
&gt; broke the<br/>
&gt; spawn in the room (3 Bloodthirsty Ghouls). The next spawn was<br/>
&gt; the Frenzied<br/>
&gt; Ghoul, we killed him (quite easily infact) and the leader<br/>
&gt; looted. Then I<br/>
&gt; saw the word &quot;Sash&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My heart was pumping so fast as I had the chance of winning<br/>
&gt; this fabled<br/>
&gt; item. The first person rolled and only got a 21. I then<br/>
&gt; rolled and it came<br/>
&gt; up 90, the excitement of this was amazing. But, I was still<br/>
&gt; hoping no one<br/>
&gt; beat my roll. I sat there as people rolled and low numbers<br/>
&gt; were appearing,<br/>
&gt; 33, 12, 39 and 28. I had won, I was now the owner of a<br/>
&gt; loooooverly sash. I<br/>
&gt; equipped it and immediately noticed the difference during the<br/>
&gt; first fight.<br/>
&gt; Sash + Celerity makes me attack very fast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, there you have it. The quickest 20k I have ever earned.  =)<br/>
