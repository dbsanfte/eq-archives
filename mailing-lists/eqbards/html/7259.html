<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035918634"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;Blair, Keith (Keith Blair)&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kblair@...">kblair@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am on The Rathe, and i have withness the arrival of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Daughter of Innoruk.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As always, over guildsay and all, Every lvl 50 or so where<br/>
&gt; &gt; there to try to take a piece of her. Not only they did no<br/>
&gt; &gt; amage, But she was calling over the &quot;Power of Innoruuk&quot; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; insta-kill them... Not nice to see lvl 50 drop in one cast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What&#39;s not nice is the uppity high level players trying to<br/>
&gt;ruin something that Verant is trying to do for the rest of<br/>
&gt;the players. Everyone complains about no quests and no<br/>
&gt;&#39;ongoing&#39; story lines - yet when Verant tries to add them<br/>
&gt;in there&#39;s someone that tries to ruin it - so they take<br/>
&gt;care of the problem the only way they can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Players do not lose experience when killed by a gm created<br/>
&gt;npc in an event or quest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, but creating unkillable NPC also stifles RP&#39;ing as well.  If a High <br/>
Elf Paladin or for that matter a Wood Elf Bard were to come across a being <br/>
claiming to be the Daughter of the foul god that killed the Elven King and <br/>
Queen and created the foul race of the Teir&#39;dal they would be betraying <br/>
there own heritage by not attempting to slay her.   If players are able to <br/>
slay gods on their own turf they should be able to slay a god&#39;s <br/>
avatar/messenger/etc on the mortal plain.<br/>
