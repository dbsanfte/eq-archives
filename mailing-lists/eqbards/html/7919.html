in question.  Giving a low level person full banded ot leather I don&#39;t see<br/>
as a big issue, sure it&#39;ll be good for them for the next 10 or 15 levels,<br/>
but there still many upgrades to all their pieces of equipment, and many<br/>
of them come as early as the mid teens.  Frankly, I see most of my<br/>
true gaming experience in everquest as between levels 20 and 49, and <br/>
giving a player some equipment to carry them out of the newbie areas and<br/>
into the levels where people start to find regular groups and learn the<br/>
real joys of group dynamics and player interaction is definitely an<br/>
enchancement.  Spending 8 hours chunks solo hunting wisps for money so I <br/>
can scrounge the last few plat I need for banded armor is definitely not<br/>
why I paid to play EQ.<br/>
