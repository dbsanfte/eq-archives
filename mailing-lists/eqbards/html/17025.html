Target: Increase Attack Speed +160.<br/>
Description:Great for tanks when grouped. Increases the amount of times you<br/>
will hit in a round against an enemy. In large/long battles it can make a<br/>
huge difference. Quite deadly when used in conjunction with Languid<br/>
Pace/Tepid Deeds. Combine these 2 spells when possible.. talk about breaking<br/>
the odds. Slows down your opponent, increases your attack rate<br/>
This spell doesn&#39;t stack with Augmentation, but as such it provides over<br/>
double the attack speed for the target and is usually preferred anyway. The<br/>
other important thing is that this spell helps increase combat skill gain<br/>
since you are making more skill rolls with your attack.<br/>
----------------------<br/>
<br/>
So, when SLTW &quot; provides over double the attack speed &quot; - it hardly matters<br/>
if VoV does a 35.271% increase or a 36.983% increase.  Enchanter speed buffs<br/>
are where it&#39;s at.  I use Warsong because my enchanter wont give me SLTW.<br/>
She says she does not want me to die that quickly.  But then again Innoruuk<br/>
killed her and not me ;p<br/>

&gt; Alacrity gives about 40.0% at level 25 for sure.  I ran the numbers but<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have them here.  I&#39;m pretty sure it was 40% +/- .5%.<br/>

&gt; Given all that, I suppose the question is: should I be nauseated?  I<br/>
&gt; wonder if higher level enchanter buffs are even more superior to the lvl<br/>
&gt; 16 buff.<br/>
