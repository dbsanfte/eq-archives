<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138181271">You ask later in your post about the value of a Selo&#39;s drum. I refer you<br/>
to the question above. Are you<br/>
  happy with what you are paying for it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  - That&#39;s great is you know what&#39;s around and have a &quot;basic&quot; idea of what<br/>
things are worth.  I am still a newbie in the respect of armour and weapon<br/>
worth.  I have no clue is an FBSS and a SBS are worth the trade of a PGT and<br/>
a YAK.  I use the price guids as a &quot;starting point&quot; as to what I may get for<br/>
something.  I don&#39;t care to spam channels asking if this is a good price fo<br/>
this or not.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes if you are happy with the trade then all is well and good.  But as<br/>
stated before I am still a newbie.  I want to make sure that I am not<br/>
getting ripped off by someone trying to swap me something that really isn&#39;t<br/>
that great...<br/>
