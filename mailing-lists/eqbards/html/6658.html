<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304978983">&lt;LOL&gt; I absolutely agree as well.  Have not spent one iota of coin, err,<br/>
money on video games since April - and not so much as a peek at new reviews,<br/>
except maybe to snoop around for info on the new add-on.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One last thing,  before EQ came out,  I averaged buying <br/>
&gt; about 10 computer<br/>
&gt; &gt; games a year.  A lot of them I would not even finish <br/>
&gt; because I got bored<br/>
&gt; &gt; with them.  I&#39;ve been playing EQ since April and I am still <br/>
&gt; having lots of<br/>
&gt; &gt; fun playing.  As a 22d level bard, I still have alot of <br/>
&gt; things I can look<br/>
&gt; &gt; forward to doing in the game.  I haven&#39;t even considered <br/>
&gt; buying a new game<br/>
&gt; &gt; since April. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Well put !!!! I was just telling my wife how much money she save<br/>
&gt; because I have not brought the 3 or 4 games a month that I used to ! <br/>
&gt; Now I may but Diablo 2 but EQ I play every day and the one game I<br/>
&gt; brought since EQ (TA Kingdoms) I haven&#39;t bothered to finish. <br/>
&gt; But I will<br/>
&gt; collect pop bottles on the side of the road to get the EQ <br/>
&gt; Expansion pack<br/>
&gt; :) You can&#39;t beat playing with real folk :)<br/>
