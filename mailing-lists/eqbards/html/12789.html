&gt; Subject: RE: [eqbards] A new /who command (OT)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	For doing a guildwho I believe the correct syntax is <br/>
&gt; /who all &quot;&lt;part or all<br/>
&gt; of guildname&gt;&quot; so for you to get it to work with &quot; Order of <br/>
&gt; the Sacred Nut&quot;<br/>
&gt; it would be /who all &quot; order of the sacred nut&quot; maybe?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	As for zone name who&#39;ing, you would still be stumped by <br/>
&gt; anyone who was in<br/>
&gt; RP mode or is anon since the zone info wouldn&#39;t show up in the list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No big deal. We don&#39;t need exact numbers. Short of everyone in the zone<br/>
being anonymous, it will give you some feel for how crowded a particular<br/>
zone was.<br/>
<br/>
Or they could just use the function that they currently use for the &quot;/who&quot;<br/>
command instead of the &quot;/who all&quot; which shows all of the people in the zone.<br/>
(If this is a separate function) This would show the people listed as &quot;anon&quot;<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, by the way to you all for the quotes trick. I tried it before, but I<br/>
must not have been using the correct string to find.<br/>
