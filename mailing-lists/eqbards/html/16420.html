<div id="ygrps-yiv-831339611"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Head: Executioner Hood (want to replace this with a Froglock or Trannix<br/>
&gt; crown)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You should get an Opoline helm, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Chest: Enamalled Black chestplate<br/>
&gt; Legs: Black Chitin Legs<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I should buy a BE chestplate, and ditch the charred bp.<br/>
  As far as the legs go they are typically classified as a caster<br/>
  item, and I wouldn&#39;t ever earn these - need to buy these as well<br/>
  or convince some friends to camp bugs for a night.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Arms: Blacked Iron Armplates (back chain, no black plate arms exist for<br/>
&gt; non-Sks AFAIK)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah I don&#39;t think there are any for non-sk&#39;s either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wrist: Serpentine Bracer, it kind of spoils the look.  I need to get a<br/>
&gt; granite bracer (off Petrifin, a spawn in Rathe Mtns.  I hate camping Rathe<br/>
&gt; Mtn rares).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah but what color is it? hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
