<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206248506">HEY!  Giving away all my secrets!!! I still do this at lev 34 but for nice<br/>
stuffs to have to give to young adventurers.  Good advice Rokken.  Also, you<br/>
can get Menkes Tolbet in South Qeynos to make you Snake Fang Necklaces and<br/>
re-sell those in the snake places in east commonlands for 1 to 2pp. Their<br/>
value goes way up when your buyer is sitting there with the poison icon on<br/>
his screen &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

		Lament is a must have song.  What this song does is give you<br/>
the ability to <br/>
		single pull mobs from groups of up to 4.  When a mob is hit<br/>
with lament it&#39;s <br/>
		agro range is great reduced, this allows you to pull the one<br/>
standing next <br/>
		to it with out the lulled one joining in.  It&#39;s great for<br/>
breaking up large <br/>
		camps, like the bandit camps in West Karana or the Orc camps<br/>
in the commons. <br/>
		  Save your coppers and get this song as soon as you can.<br/>
<br/>
		One way to make the money for this song is to do the Qeynos<br/>
to Kelethin <br/>
		trade run.  In the Qeynos Hills you will find a pair of<br/>
NPC&#39;s near Surefall <br/>
		Glade (Baobob and Chanda Miller).  They will make wolf and<br/>
bear hide armor <br/>
		items that are usuable by the caster class.  This armor has<br/>
the same or <br/>
		better AC then Leather, and the finger wigglers in Greater<br/>
Feydark will pay <br/>
		very well for these items.  Here is a breakdown of who make<br/>
what:<br/>
		Baobob Miller:<br/>
		Wolf hide belt  AC 3 - Low quality wolf pelt + 5 gold<br/>
		Wolf hide boots AC 4 - Medium quality wolf pelt + 15 gold<br/>
		Wolf hide cloak AC 5 - High quality wolf pelt + 21 gold<br/>
		Chanda Miller:<br/>
		Bear hide belt  AC 4 - Low quality bear skin + 5 gold<br/>
		Bear hide Boots AC 5 - Medium quality bear skin + 15 gold<br/>
		Bear hide cloak AC 6 - High quality bear skin + 21 gold<br/>
<br/>
		Typical selling prices in Greater Feydark:<br/>
		Wolf hide belt  2 plat<br/>
		Wolf hide boots 3 plat<br/>
		Wolf hide cloak 4-5 plat<br/>
		Bear hide belt  25 gold<br/>
		Bear hide Boots 4 plat<br/>
		Bear hide cloak 5 to 10 plat (these are high sought after)<br/>
<br/>
		When I used to do this in the first few weeks of retail I<br/>
would net at least <br/>
		50 plat a trip, sometimes over 100.<br/>
<br/>
		Good luck!<br/>
