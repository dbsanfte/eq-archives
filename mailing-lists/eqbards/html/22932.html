<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249082798">I don&#39;t think I agree. I doubt that they&#39;re going to put bind spots right in<br/>
front of most dungeons, instead, I think they&#39;re likely to just add a few<br/>
spots in more central locations.<br/>
<br/>
Some of your guesses don&#39;t really seem logical. For example, Why bother with<br/>
a bind in Lfay when you can bind in Gfay? Having a bind 1 zone closer isn&#39;t<br/>
going to increase MM trafic very much. Or WC? I doubt they&#39;d add a bind<br/>
point for a teenage dungeon especially when freeport is 2 zones away.<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;ll be aiming for mid level dungeons that are under used.<br/>
Definitely something near paw. Perhaps the stone bridge in SK or NK.<br/>
Something near unrest is possible, but not too likely seeing as how unrest<br/>
is pretty well frequented. The other biggie would be something closer to the<br/>
evil side of the world. Lake Rathe, Rathe Mountains, Cazic Thule,<br/>
Upper/Lower Guk. The arena is a bindable zone, but that&#39;s still a long walk<br/>
to cazic or guk.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly a bind near perma wouldn&#39;t help in the slightest. The reason people<br/>
don&#39;t go is because it&#39;s so hard to get to, not to fight in. The closest<br/>
teleports are West karana near NK zone or Toxxula forrest. Neither of which<br/>
are very close. Personally I&#39;d like to see a teleport ring or spire placed<br/>
in permafrost to make that side of the world a little more accessable.<br/>
<br/>
Other likely candidates are kunark zones. Something close to Howling Stones<br/>
for good races and something close to Kaesora for non lizards both come to<br/>
mind.<br/>

Here&#39;s my guesses...<br/>
<br/>
Very likely:<br/>
Lavastorm (outside Solusek & Najena)<br/>
South Karana (outside Paw)<br/>
Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron (perhaps anywhere)<br/>
Ocean of Tears (perhaps anywhere)<br/>
Lesser Faydark (outside Mistmoore)<br/>
Feerott (outside Cazic Thule)<br/>
Innothule Swamp (outside Guk)<br/>
<br/>
Not so likely:<br/>
Toxxulia (outside Paineel)<br/>
Erud&#39;s Crossing (at docks)<br/>
West Commons (outside Belfallen)<br/>
Everfrost (outside Permafrost)<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Evulia of Tunare<br/>
