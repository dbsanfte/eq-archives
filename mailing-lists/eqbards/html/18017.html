The most fun I&#39;ve had in EQ since ... well, last weekends Pegasi ;p. Still,<br/>
this blows away PoF, PoH, and Dragons by a long shot. Strangely, the loot&#39;s<br/>
been mediocre =P - check Castersrealm in a few for Muyo&#39;s Necklace, assuming<br/>
he posts it.<br/>
(end paste)<br/>
<br/>
Wtg to both of your guilds!  Woo hoo some bad old birties!<br/>

&gt; my guild killed the Spiroc Lord a couple nights ago.  i wasn&#39;t there as i<br/>
&gt; worked all day but when i got home i was able to hear how the fights were<br/>
&gt; going and went to sleep right before they attacked.  i guess it is only<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; second Spiroc Lord to be killed on all servers.  i don&#39;t know how tough he<br/>
&gt; was, i believe it was getting him alone that was the hard part.  i&#39;ve<br/>
missed<br/>
&gt; all of our sky fights other than the duel-wielding dojo, have to put in so<br/>
&gt; much time up there and with work and the baby it&#39;s tough.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, the weekend is over, and I spend almost all of it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Plane of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sky.  This is basically what happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Day 1: Cleared Fairies and Azaracks, camped on Gorgalask<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Day 2: Cleared Gorgalask and Pegasus, camped on Pegasus<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Day 3: Recleared Pegasus, realized it was already 11PM, did<br/>
&gt; &gt; some poking<br/>
&gt; &gt; around on Spirocs and jumped off, leaving a necro and cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt; on pegasus<br/>
