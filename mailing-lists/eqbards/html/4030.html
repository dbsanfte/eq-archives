<div id="ygrps-yiv-668587712">You obviously either did not understand my question in the way that I<br/>
phrased it, or are being a smart ass because you have nothing better to do.<br/>
I think I had a valid question: Does the tentacle whip proc more at higher<br/>
levels?  If you don&#39;t know there is no need to make me look like a fool<br/>
because you are bored.  I barely add any comments to this group as it is,<br/>
and I certainly am not inclined to continue participating if every time I<br/>
comment I get some smart ass being cute with me.<br/>

&gt; I think it is likely that the frequency an item procs is <br/>
&gt; affects by your<br/>
&gt; Dexterity, and in some cases by your level as well.  Would <br/>
&gt; the whip be more<br/>
&gt; effective if at, say, level 25 it proc&#39;d 80% of the time <br/>
&gt; compared with the<br/>
&gt; 20% (or whatever) it does at lower levels?<br/>
&gt; I have no idea about this, just wondering...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ummmm....Yeah, anything that does something 80% of the time <br/>
&gt; instead of 20%<br/>
&gt; is going to be a BIT more effective....around 60% more effective....<br/>
