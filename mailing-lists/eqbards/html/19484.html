<div id="ygrps-yiv-365633">One question and a comment:<br/>
<br/>
When you get a fear resist, does it save any time to turn it off and on<br/>
again?  Or should I just leave it running?<br/>
<br/>
Comment:  I use bellow as my third song in the mix.  I found it more<br/>
effective than warsong as I often miss my attacks due to the monster moving<br/>
around so much...</div>
