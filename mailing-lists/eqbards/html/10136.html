<div id="ygrps-yiv-106140583">Actually, I held my own pretty well against a ranger<br/>
who was 2 levels above me.  I pretty much ran around<br/>
him bellowing and hitting him in the back. We were<br/>
about even and 2 bubbles down when I accidentally<br/>
erased bellow from my memory!  (I right mouse click<br/>
and turn mouse to rotate faster--and accidentally<br/>
right mouse clicked on the bellow song).  At that<br/>
point I was pretty much screwed.  Anyway, my point is<br/>
that it is possible to beat a ranger at that level. I<br/>
was 21 i think and he was 23 or 24.  If I was his<br/>
level I think I would have kicked his butt all over<br/>
the planet. At a higher level I&#39;m sure this would be<br/>
much more difficult--maybe impossible.  I have heard<br/>
of bards slaughtering rangers doing instrument attack<br/>
with DDD/COD/HOR.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes but all those examples were with each class<br/>
&gt; using all its abilities.  I<br/>
&gt; was trying to point out that separating them out was<br/>
&gt; meaningless which those<br/>
&gt; examples would bear out.  How the 25th bard beat the<br/>
&gt; ranger I can&#39;t fathom.<br/>
&gt; I dueled a 15th level ranger when I was 15th and<br/>
&gt; despite having 40 points of<br/>
&gt; ac over him he smoked me and stayed above 2 bubbles.<br/>
&gt;  If I ran around and<br/>
&gt; tried to heal he shot me with his bow, and in melee<br/>
&gt; it was a near even trade<br/>
&gt; of blows.  It should be even worse at 24th with<br/>
&gt; rangers getting Parry at<br/>
&gt; 18th and double attack at 20th, ick!  When I hit<br/>
&gt; 20th I will try again on a<br/>
&gt; 20th ranger, but seriously doubt I will win a real<br/>
&gt; duel with him.  What I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to try is a group of three bards vs three of<br/>
&gt; any other class at the<br/>
&gt; same levels.  I think we would nearly win all those<br/>
&gt; duels, but unless on the<br/>
&gt; PvP servers will never find out unless I can get<br/>
&gt; some friends into the<br/>
&gt; Arena.<br/>
