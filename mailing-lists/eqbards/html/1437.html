<div id="ygrps-yiv-414542649">Not sure if this has been posted yet, but an interesting side benefit of the<br/>
song is that you can now do quests with NPC&#39;s who would not talk to you<br/>
before.  This is possibly one of the biggest uses of the song besides<br/>
selling items at better prices.<br/>
