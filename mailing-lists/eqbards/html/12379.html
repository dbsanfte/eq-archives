<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156595510">Just something I wanted to share with you speed freaks out there...<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was crossing North Karana when I picked up GrimFeather on <br/>
tracking.  I was feeling a bit reckless, and figured I&#39;d see how fast GF <br/>
really is... so I ran under him (GrimFeather hits YOU for 72 points of <br/>
damage!) and sped off.  Well, turns out he is quite a bit slower than me at <br/>
36 with MM drums.  So now I am wondering if there is anything in the world <br/>
faster than me other than Shadowed Men and higher-level bards...<br/>
