<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425968836">Well, I for one can tell you that I have been running WinME for several<br/>
months now without problems.  I run it side by side with a Win2k Adv Server<br/>
and have had very few problems with each.  The server has been running for 3<br/>
months now without a reboot, the WinME Machine has been outstanding for<br/>
gaming.  <br/>
<br/>
I think what it really comes down to is this.  What are you using the<br/>
machine for?  If its work, then security and lower TCO is most likely an<br/>
issue and I would recommend the W2K series of OS&#39;s.  If the machine is for<br/>
personal or home use (games / ease of use / intuitiveness) , use WinME.<br/>
<br/>
There are two big areas that we have seen people need support on:<br/>
<br/>
	1.  Someone has taken their machine that has gone through EVERY OS<br/>
upgrade and has never reformatted it or just cleaned up the drive.  (Some<br/>
issues there)<br/>
	2.  Someone is taking a WinME machine and trying to make into a high<br/>
end work production machine...it was never designed to be that.<br/>
<br/>
Just my .02 :)<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day Everyone!<br/>

My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has <br/>
inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a less-than-desirable <br/>
platform.  Win2k, on the other hand, apparently has the stability, which <br/>
comes at the cost of speed, due to security features.  I just wanted some <br/>
responses from people with practical experience in the matter.  Thanks!<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been using ME for a couple months now without any problems.  Any idea<br/>
