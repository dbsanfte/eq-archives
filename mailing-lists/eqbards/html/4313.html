  Ok, need some advice on the Ghoul Lord.<br/>
<br/>
  Our Guild, pretty much nightly, has 6 people levels 35-49 head down and<br/>
clear the whole area UP TO The Ghoul Lord. By the time we reach him, all<br/>
that is left is 2 Bok Knights, The Ghoul Lord, and his pet.<br/>
<br/>
  Just HOW TOUGH is the Ghoul Lord? Is there another critter he can be<br/>
equally compared to? How about the Bok Knights? Any suggestions? Can the<br/>
Boks be pulled singly?<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks for any input,<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;     So, we have an armor that is arguably the best magical armor that<br/>
&gt;&gt; can be had, for more than half of the players in EQ.  (Yes,<br/>
&gt;&gt; Mithril and<br/>
&gt;&gt; a few other pieces are better but are only wearable by a few, for<br/>
&gt;&gt; example we bards cannot wear Mithril).  And, it is only found in one<br/>
&gt;&gt; place.  And, it is a rare drop.  What this means is that there will<br/>
&gt;&gt; NEVER be enough ruby to go around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bards can wear mithril breastplate and the bracers.  Never seen any other<br/>
&gt;pieces, haven&#39;t gone in deep enough yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Note: if Green Splinted Platemail (like<br/>
&gt;&gt; Aradune wears)<br/>
&gt;&gt; makes it into the game, and is wearable by those who can wear ruby and<br/>
&gt;&gt; by monks also (like it is rumored to), then green will replace ruby as<br/>
&gt;&gt; the best armor in the game, and will be camped like hell, not solving<br/>
&gt;&gt; the problem at all.]<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Being as good as it is, it is going to be on something over level 50,<br/>
&gt;requiring at least 2 full groups of level 45-50 players, maybe more, and it<br/>
&gt;is hard to coordinate that kind of camp.  i have a tough time getting a<br/>
&gt;ghoul lord group together until late at night, which takes 6 to 12 people<br/>
