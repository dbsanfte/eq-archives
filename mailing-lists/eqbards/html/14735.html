<div id="ygrps-yiv-357036181">Your with the wrong groups sadly if they only want mana song. If your in a<br/>
group that doesn&#39;t want speed then well they are nuts. Mana song is for<br/>
after battle especially at higher levels when the output isn&#39;t as good.<br/>

&gt;I totally agree with you, I feel useless as a bard now. Last night in Lower<br/>
&gt;guk I /ooc&#39;d for a group got a tell saying come to the cav, I made my way<br/>
&gt;down and they invited me, first thing I see is /g wooohooo, crack etc<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I stayed with the group for an hour or so and hit level 37, &lt;cheers&gt; then<br/>
&gt;joined the sent group, as soon as I join once again I see /g wooo mana<br/>
&gt;song. During a fight I started playing Celerity and I get /g just play mana<br/>
&gt;song<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fine, if thats what the want. So I stand there doing pitiful amounts of dmg<br/>
&gt;with my poor melee skills and provide the mana, is that all we are worth?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also noticed that I was fighting stuff that conned yellow to me at 37 so<br/>
&gt;I couldn&#39;t even use charm when we got a big pull. I think Verant should<br/>
&gt;make our level 39 song and upgraded charm that works on mobs upto level<br/>
&gt;47-49 etc. It&#39;s gonna suck loosing one of our best abilities because we out<br/>
&gt;levelled it.<br/>

&gt;Ps, Looking on the bright side my Ykesha now proc&#39;s and I traded my Runed<br/>
&gt;Falchion and 600pp for a Sharkjaw Cutlass last night. Although the stats<br/>
&gt;are not as good as the RF it can be weilded in either hand so it&#39;s better<br/>
&gt;with my Ykesha in the main hand.  =)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Going back to the hybrid discussion, it is my contention that, by<br/>
&gt;Verant&#39;s definition:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Compared to casters, hybrids should have better melee and worse casting.<br/>
&gt;Compared to meleers, hybrids should have worse melee and better casting.<br/>
&gt;We are a hybrid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For true class balance, the melee + casting component for all classes<br/>
&gt;should be equal, but the above must at the very minimum be true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For the cost of a material component and fifteen seconds sitting plopped<br/>
&gt;on their butts, Necromancers, Magicians and arguably Enchanters have<br/>
&gt;better melee than we do, for as long as they are able to keep their pets<br/>
&gt;alive.  So we fail the definition automatically.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Verant has specifically made our songs weaker than the corresponding<br/>
&gt;spells cast by other classes (Lullaby is a prime example) because:  a)<br/>
&gt;they are the other classes&#39; specialties, b) our songs affect an entire<br/>
&gt;group, and hence our songs are &quot;more powerful&quot; than individual spells,<br/>
&gt;and c) our songs do not require mana and hence can be cast indefinitely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And yet, we can keep at *most* three songs going at a time, while many of<br/>
&gt;the clerics, shamans, druids and enchanters I know are capable of keeping<br/>
&gt;three (plus) buffs up on all party members while *also* casting combat<br/>
&gt;spells and healing (and, in many cases, meleeing better).  If we can cast<br/>
&gt;fewer songs/spells than these other classes, and those songs are weaker<br/>
&gt;than the other classes&#39; spells, and most of these classes are better at<br/>
&gt;melee than we are (either naturally or via pets), what use are we?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Further, even at level 42, I find my song selection to be severely<br/>
&gt;constrained because many of our best songs are incompatable with spells<br/>
&gt;that other classes are casting.  And their&#39;s are better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am frequently invited on guild events with the level 50s, but I<br/>
&gt;strongly suspect that they are using me as a cheap clarity fill-in.<br/>
&gt;Especially since they are constantly sending /g Play Mana Song.  After<br/>
&gt;all, a level 42 does not steal very much exp from five level 46-50s, and<br/>
&gt;clarity is pretty useful *given that small exp sacrifice*, if no higher<br/>
&gt;level is available to fill slot 6.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What happens when I get to level 50?  Can I in good conscience argue that<br/>
&gt;I am actually a useful party member?  It seems to me that the value of a<br/>
&gt;Bard shrinks as he approaches level 50, particularly if Harmonic is<br/>
&gt;correct and our MR songs are not really needed in Dragon/Planes raids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been reading a lot of posts on various boards where people discuss<br/>
&gt;their &quot;ideal&quot; party makeup.  Given that we are supposed to be the weakest<br/>
&gt;solo type and the strongest grouping type (correct?), one would expect a<br/>
&gt;Bard to be listed in one of the first few slots in most of these lists.<br/>
&gt;And yet, not one of the lists I have seen included a bard *at all*.  Not<br/>
&gt;even when a list of alternates was given for slot 6.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I suspect that this is, in part, due to the fact that there are not very<br/>
&gt;many Bards (and why would there be, when there are so many much more<br/>
&gt;obviously powerful classes to choose from), and that it is in part due to<br/>
&gt;the fact that many Bards are clueless (at level 42, I am increasingly<br/>
&gt;surprised at the number of people who don&#39;t realize that we can twist<br/>
&gt;songs, for example).  Still, doesn&#39;t the fact that nobody who has posted<br/>
&gt;a list like this has bothered to name the Bard at all suggest something<br/>
&gt;about class balance?  Like, for example, we s**k?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I need reassurance.  Wah!<br/>
