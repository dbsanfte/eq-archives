 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t say as I&#39;ve ever had much of a problem with stalkers.  Had one high <br/>
elf try it once with my wood elf druid.  I sent him a tell that if he didnt <br/>
stop it ASAP, i would /report him.  He apologized quickly and never I heard <br/>
from him again.  I am female in RL, btw.<br/>
<br/>
Never had the problem on my wood elf bard from strangers.  Get lots of <br/>
teasing from flirting from the male members of my guild.  But since I&#39;ve <br/>
known most of them for 3 RL years, its not quite the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have noticed: for some reason, seems like more wood elves and <br/>
high elves have attitude problems than the other races.  Wood elf male bards <br/>
being the worst. Of course, this is a subjective opinion.  One thing for <br/>
sure though, soon as my wood elf characters were old enough to travel, I <br/>
left Fedwyr and rarely go back.<br/>
<br/>
As for Trolls and Ogres, I&#39;ve found them to be some of the nicest folks <br/>
you&#39;d want to be around, so long as you can overlook their disgusting <br/>
personal habits ;-P<br/>
