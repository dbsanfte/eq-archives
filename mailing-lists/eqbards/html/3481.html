<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044849683">Well the psalm&#39;s of purity and vitality do not provide dmg shields. Which<br/>
is too bad cause i woulda loved to see a dmg shield based on disease and<br/>
poision :). But the psalm of cooling predicatbly does have a cold shield<br/>
that freezed amything that hits you.at lvl 40 the dmg is 6 pts too, same as<br/>
the psalm of warmth. Interesting thing is the shields dont seem to be<br/>
resisted. While fighting in sol b (nafalgar or whatevers lair) i was using<br/>
the psalm of warmth (because i hadnt picked up cooling yet) and the kobolds<br/>
never resisted them. The kobolds have OUTRAGEOUS fire protection, irritates<br/>
the druids to the pt they cant nuke them effectively. But my fireshields<br/>
just kept working.</div>
