<div id="ygrps-yiv-650497836">I don&#39;t think there is a right answer on attribute points.  I put most of<br/>
mine in str and wish I had more. =)  But now that I&#39;m lvl 32, I wish I had<br/>
more int and cha.<br/>
<br/>
As for best race, imho it&#39;s the half-elf.  But then, I&#39;ve played a female<br/>
half-elf bard since 2d week of P4, so I&#39;m a bit biased.  Cantador, the 36th<br/>
lvl bard on MithMarr also states that the half-elf is the best bard (he runs<br/>
a male HE bard).  Lots of people choose female woodelf, but I think that&#39;s<br/>
just for the kawaii (er... cuteness). =)<br/>

&gt;what does everyone think is the best places to put the<br/>
&gt;extra attribute points into?  also, what is the best race<br/>
&gt;for a bard?<br/>
&gt;thanks<br/>
