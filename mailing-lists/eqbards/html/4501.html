<div id="ygrps-yiv-848231773">It is because he doesn&#39;t always drop it anymore.  My enchanter friend and my<br/>
warrior were lucky - we got one each on the first two times we killed Dvinn.<br/>
On the way out of the Crushbone a level 21 ranger asked for our assistance<br/>
in killing Dvinn for his heart (the ranger didn&#39;t know about the dirk).<br/>
Well after killing Dvinn a total of 7 times that night we never saw another<br/>
Dirk.  We tried again later to help our wizard get one and after killing<br/>
Dvinn 9 times (over a two night period) we finally got one.   So they are<br/>
becoming more rare.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Personally I feel the Dirk is sold for WAY under it true value, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; considering the WB Rapier sells for 225 plat.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; More that the well balanced is horrifically overpriced. Try selling one<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to a vendor for a more realistic idea of it&#39;s true value. Everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know who has bought a well balanced weapon regrets it and tells anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; who will listen not to make the same mistake.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The prices on Dirks are going up anyway.  Last night I couldn&#39;t find<br/>
&gt; anyone willing to sell a Dirk for less than 60pp--and I went straight to<br/>
&gt; the source too.  Everyone blamed it on the LORE flag.  Go figure.<br/>
