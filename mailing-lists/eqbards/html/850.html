<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784133937">Most gaming systems factor in some real life concepts about what type of<br/>
damage armor can and cannot protect against. Assuming that there are three<br/>
types of damage (slash, pierce, and blunt) various armors protect various<br/>
ways. From what I&#39;ve seen and heard, most of these are factored in here.<br/>
<br/>
	Cloth armor isn&#39;t really gonna do much since it is easy to puncture, easy<br/>
to cut through, and offers very little padding to slow the impact of<br/>
something big and round.<br/>
<br/>
	Patchwork usually provides a bit more protection against slash and blunt<br/>
since it is slightly thicker than cloth. Piercing it may not improve<br/>
against.<br/>
<br/>
	The various leathers (rawhide and normal) are better against piercing and<br/>
much better against slashing because of the toughness of it. Some are often<br/>
padded decently so it takes the edge off of blunt damage.<br/>
<br/>
	Studded leather would most likely improve upon slashing since the metal<br/>
studs would help stop the blade but wouldn&#39;t do much for piercing since the<br/>
studs cover such a small area. Blunt might actually hurt more if it hits one<br/>
of the studs and drives it into your chest. =)<br/>
<br/>
	Reinforced is the same thing but now there is more surface area to stop<br/>
piercing.<br/>
<br/>
	Ring mail works much better against slash since you naw have a shell of<br/>
metal around you. Blunt is slightly better since the rings are just linked<br/>
and allows for force transferrence over a wider area. Not great though<br/>
seeing as how much it gives into you. Piercing? Well, all those rings with<br/>
the big holes in them doesn&#39;t stop much of a point. You&#39;d basically be<br/>
reduced to whatever padding is underneath.<br/>
<br/>
	Chain is the same as ring but usually has tigher links making it a bit more<br/>
difficult to slip a piercer in.<br/>
<br/>
	Banded, similar to splint and scale in other game systems, improves against<br/>
piercers quite a bit now that most of those holes are filled up. Still some<br/>
between the plates though. Slashing prolly isn&#39;t much better than chain but<br/>
blunt is probably better now that you have plates of metal that won&#39;t give<br/>
as easily.<br/>
<br/>
	Plate, of course, is usually considered the best. It offers very good<br/>
protection against slashers since it is often hard to cut metal. Blunt is<br/>
really good since you have that rigitity of a real big piece of metal.<br/>
Piercing is better since there are relatively few holes to sneak through<br/>
unless you want to try and force the point of a dagger or rapier through a<br/>
quarter inch of steel.<br/>
<br/>
	Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

	Hello all . . .<br/>
<br/>
	I completed my set of bronze armor, and now I have a few questions about<br/>
it if anyone can help.<br/>
<br/>
	AC continues to be a mystery. It seems to be no more than an overall armor<br/>
rating, which increases with level and with type of armor, and exists only<br/>
so that I can compare AC values with jealous people who still have<br/>
patchwork. Does AC really have a meaning? If so, what does the total AC<br/>
value mean? What does the AC value of a single piece of armor mean?<br/>
<br/>
	Now I know from experience that as soon as I went to full banded, my<br/>
ability to take damage skyrocketed. All of the sudden things which used to<br/>
destroy me just kept missing me or hitting me for 1 damage. This seems to<br/>
suggest it has nothing to do with AC value, and everything to do with armor<br/>
type. The fact that the banded &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 25 from<br/>
patchwork was irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
	Now my bronze &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 15, a small amount compared<br/>
to my overall AC, but again my ability to take damage jumped significantly.<br/>
I can again solo everything that is blue.<br/>
<br/>
	I read somewhere that each different type of armor (Leather, Chain, Plate<br/>
and its equivalents) can absorb more and different types of damage as the<br/>
armor gets better. This seems to be true, and seems to make the AC value<br/>
worthless . . .<br/>
<br/>
	Besides, full bronze looks really cool.<br/>
<br/>
	Please comment . . .<br/>
