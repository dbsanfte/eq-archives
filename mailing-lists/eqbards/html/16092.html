beta, right up to the last week of P4, there were only 20 bard songs in<br/>
the game. Then, just before they booted us all off to go final, most of<br/>
the current 20-50 songs went in (with huge gaps in the 40&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
Just how much testing and balancing do you think got done on them before<br/>
they got in (and no they weren&#39;t on the test server either)<br/>
