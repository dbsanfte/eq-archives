<div id="ygrps-yiv-755749242"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    Monks way outdmg Warriors, there is no competition.<br/>
&gt;    Monks dual/double is high enough were they get a good<br/>
&gt;    chance each round to hit four times.  Warriors are<br/>
&gt;    sometimes lucky to even hit three.  I&#39;ve seen a monk<br/>
&gt;    do 30 - 50 points per fist, and a 90 point kick.  A<br/>
&gt;    monk can solo the permafrost throne room, a warrior<br/>
&gt;    would have to flee.  You completely underestimate the<br/>
&gt;    power of monks (yes, at lower levels its not that obvious).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 50, maybe.  My level 23 monk is constantly outdamaged by warriors<br/>
the same level.  And contrary to popular belief, we may get hit less (not so<br/>
sure about this), but when we ARE hit, they hit us for a LOT.  I see a lot<br/>
more hits for max dmg with my monk that I did with my ogre warrior in<br/>
bronze.  The ogre often got hit for 1 pt fighting orcs in Highpass, while my<br/>
monk was getting hit for 30+ when he was hit.  (this was verified by someone<br/>
using that log parser thingy a while ago I think, but I can&#39;t remember who<br/>
it was.)  I did have equipment that was pretty good for my level, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve since retired him because of the feign death changes (I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s a nerf necessarily, but the changes were NOT well thought out) and<br/>
other reasons, and will be concentrating on my bard instead (and my lowly<br/>
level 5 magician that was my very first character, but just couldn&#39;t bear to<br/>
delete. :))</div>
