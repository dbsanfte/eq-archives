<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714658076"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; kerrans killed me while I was on the boat<br/>
&gt; (didn&#39;t see them go on the boat, but they<br/>
&gt; did attack me even when I was on the top<br/>
&gt; part). I think they did the ignore-Z thing<br/>
&gt; and attacked<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s strange, in my experience I&#39;ve been<br/>
able to avoid attacks by being on the top<br/>
deck part.. weird.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people on the upper most deck and<br/>
for the life of me can&#39;t figure out how to<br/>
get up there. Anyone know?</div>
