<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-674760864">Just following up on an old thread.<br/>
<br/>
I was level 41 last night (42 now) and me and a ranger friend, Deerwen, <br/>
(level 45) fought a bunch of spectres last night.<br/>
Since we were near Oasis we checked out the Spectres and found them <br/>
uncamped. He was concerned about how to break the camp. I told him not to <br/>
worry about it. He waited by the inn near the sro zone and after I got a <br/>
sow from him, sang my aria and ran out to the island in the middle of the lake.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to Lament the spectre closest to the edge that runs down towards <br/>
the water. Resisted. Ack! Here he comes with 4 of his friends. Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Just so I don&#39;t accidentally run someone over, I head southwest towards the <br/>
2 dervish camps. Usually there aren&#39;t people out there and I&#39;ve solo&#39;d sand <br/>
giants out there before safely as there&#39;s a nice flat stretch of land near <br/>
The Corner. I pull them away from the water and charm the one that resisted <br/>
my lament. His buddies turn and attack the traitor. By this time Deerwen <br/>
has pulled one of them away with a dot/snare and kites it to keep it occupied.<br/>
<br/>
I recharm mine a few times and when he gets real low, I switch to one of <br/>
the healthy ones. My new pet dispatches my old one and we got exp. Woot. <br/>
BTW, I&#39;m armed with my mandolin just singing Hymn while waiting for charm <br/>
to break as I&#39;m getting lifetapped (or whatever spell that is that spectres <br/>
use) and am taking a little bit of damage.<br/>
<br/>
I go through the process and switch before each faithful pet dies. After I <br/>
take care of my 4 I went over to help my friend with his 1. I start <br/>
Screeching at it and we kill it as it runs in fear.<br/>
<br/>
So while I did have help, I probably could have taken them solo. Though <br/>
having SOW on was pretty nice. May have to go out and buy some potions.<br/>
<br/>
It was very fun and exciting for the 2 of us. The following pulls we&#39;d get <br/>
maybe 2 or 3 and we&#39;d employ the same tactics, fear kiting the last one.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, most of the spectres you can charm with Song of Sirens. But every now <br/>
and then there&#39;s a tougher one and I had to switch over to Bewitching Bravura.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m on my way to check out Velious a bit more. Pretty nice place <br/>
for us bards. Reminds me a lot of Kunark where you have lots of good mobs <br/>
roaming the lands.<br/>

P.S. Sorry about switching &quot;tenses&quot; in the story. My English teacher always <br/>
pointed that out to me. Oh well. :-b<br/>

&gt;I just figured it would be doable, considering who slow these things are.<br/>
&gt;Cyclopses sometimes catch up to me due to their speed. My main concern was<br/>
&gt;the fear spells that these things cast.<br/>

&gt;Eventually I&#39;ll head over to Kunark. Hopefully soon.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Spectres (and other mobs) agro is also partly based on a level check.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt;Spec island when fully populated has at least 4 (one each cornor) and 3<br/>
&gt; &gt;(tower lower and 2 upper).  At 33, given the social range, you will get<br/>
&gt; &gt;multiple spectres.  Also, your hp is no where near high enough to sustain<br/>
&gt; &gt;any amount of damage from them.  At level 45, it was damn hard for me to<br/>
&gt; &gt;solo spectres there.  The problem being getting multiple pulls and resists.<br/>
&gt; &gt;By 47, it was loads easier to pull singles and I still used Lament alot.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;just dont see this as being a productive venture for you at 33.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;On the other hand, you should be able to find loads of stuff to charm kite<br/>
&gt; &gt;in the great outdoors over in Kunark.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: [eqbards] Solo Spectre Camp Break?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was cruising my little &#39;ol blue level 33 self across the Oasis and<br/>
&gt; &gt;recalled that I was able to charm a Spectre not to long ago (with lots of<br/>
&gt; &gt;resists, but I was successful).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Has anyone successfully broken the camp solo? The Spectres are so slow and<br/>
&gt; &gt;we can run over the water pretty easily, figured someone must have done<br/>
&gt; &gt;this.<br/>
