<div id="ygrps-yiv-532440750">A pity.  I don&#39;t remember such great things existing in UO in its first 6<br/>
months either so maybe you should give EQ more time to mature as a<br/>
community, not necessarily as a game.<br/>

I can&#39;t tell you how much I am going to miss the bard class, the feeling of<br/>
running around the countryside exploring, hunting (which is so much finer in<br/>
EQ than UO, I mean duh).<br/>
<br/>
But my wife, of all people, pointed out that hearing about UO stories used<br/>
to be great, the interactions, the intruiges, the plots the schemes, and<br/>
that largely hearing about EQ was boring. Killed this, killed that, got this<br/>
got that, had goofy fun with a small group of folks. Which is all fine, but<br/>
not very creative sounding. Then on the very same day friends from Siege<br/>
Perilous start sending me emails out of the blue...<br/>
<br/>
For all the thrill of EQ hunting, visuals, for all the total rockingness of<br/>
the Bard class...I am left feeling like I am not creating what I want to be<br/>
creating in an online world.<br/>
<br/>
In UO I raised huge armies (more than anyone else actually) got whole shards<br/>
in an uproar, wrote a lot of story, all without one bit of help from OSI.<br/>
<br/>
And now once again I am off to Siege Perilous, where have gathered some of<br/>
the best story people from all the shards. The Imperium, The Sinful, the<br/>
Temple of Monadain, Shadowclan orcs, the Mordain sisters and more. I go not<br/>
to revive Tengu the Summoner, but to reinvent him. (Heeee! I just HAD to say<br/>
that *laughs*).<br/>
<br/>
Back to the old stinky interface the old stinky spawn, the old stinky combat<br/>
system...all those I can live with, but I can&#39;t live without large scale<br/>
creative community. And all the biggies of large scale creative community<br/>
are on SP. So off I go. It&#39;s been a total blast, I will miss the Bard class<br/>
most of all...<br/>
<br/>
Keep your lutes dry and your blade polished.<br/>
