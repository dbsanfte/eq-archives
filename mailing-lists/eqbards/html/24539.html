<br/>
So today our hero find himself in Wakening Lands, trying to get Ice Forged<br/>
Shackles for himself and a friend.  After 4 hours and 1 (of the 4 we need)<br/>
items dropping, we decide to call it a night.<br/>
 Feeling enboldened by a mostly green/not seeing invis zone, our hero<br/>
decides to wander for a bit...<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, whats this strange tower in the middle of a pond...  The inhabitants<br/>
seem friendly enough, lets see what I can see from the top...<br/>
<br/>
Strange looking tree up here, what is it?  <br/>

/gu Umm how would a non gater get out of POG?  Hypothetically speaking of<br/>
course...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Get a trans, Elf.  Dumbass... :)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
/ooc Quite foolish and really embarrased bard looking for a Trans or Gate,<br/>
will manasong/pay, whatever...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Heh, you are one lucky SOB, go to n2500 n700, loot the mobs then we will<br/>
trans you out&quot;<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
So a POG raid with no bard was going on, and Melodic Vambraces dropped!<br/>
Talk about a cool way to end the night...<br/>
