<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-883033978">Hello all. I have been playing EQ very sparingly the last few months. <br/>
I was wondering if I could some equipment/weapon advice (or point me <br/>
to a post, etc..) for my bard.<br/>
<br/>
I am on the Rathe, Level 30 almost 31. I should be able to hit 32<br/>
next week. I would like to try and get XP and a chance at upgrading my <br/>
stuff. I don&#39;t have a lot of cash either. I am currently in Cazic <br/>
Thule going between the Temple and TR&#39;s whereever I can find a group <br/>
(it&#39;s fun going from Main Tank, to healer (only healer at one point), <br/>
to crowd control).<br/>
<br/>
If any of you can suggest some upgrades and price ranges I would <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I have:<br/>
<br/>
Weapons<br/>
