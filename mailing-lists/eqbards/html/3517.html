 </span></blockquote>WHile I agree that bards, and all spellcasting guilds really, should have<br/>
the ability ot bind themselves at SOME point... I find it shocking that you<br/>
have had trouble with this service.  In my experience, if you use the /who<br/>
to find someone who is able to perform the service and the /tell them a<br/>
polite IC request for aid (I usually ask if I might have a moment of thier<br/>
time and then describe myself as newly arrived and in need of thier aid to<br/>
reattune my soul to the area) most are more than willing to help.  I have, I<br/>
believe, only had one or two turndowns with this method and those were<br/>
individuals who were already part of another group and on thier way to find<br/>
something to kill.  In about 95% of the cases, the caster in question has<br/>
not asked a copper for thier help and some even refused the small donations<br/>
we have been able to offer.  This has worked with all the classes capable of<br/>
the service, including druids, shamans and most especially clerics.</div>
