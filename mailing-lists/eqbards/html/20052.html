<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-323763862">When last we left Our Hero, the young bard on the server where his player<br/>
knew no one, he had just made level 6. He had done lots of pixie dust and<br/>
spider silk quests, been given a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic and a Pugius by kind<br/>
passers by, bought a shield, a spiked collar and a Purity belt (likely a<br/>
gift from an adoring sister to the seller, who only had to sell it to buy<br/>
her a present in return), and found several pieces of Bronze Plate laying on<br/>
the newbie lift platform. Lets tune in and see what did with his newly found<br/>
wealth...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At last I found a buyer for the large bronze breastplate. An ogre of<br/>
considerable mass, who sees to have been grudgingly accepted by the kelethin<br/>
guards. What shall I do with this wealth? 34 platinum is a fortune...and<br/>
not, it will not buy me the armour I will need to survive. I must invest<br/>
this money in my willingness to work hard, and I must serve a just cause...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Friends, every day our young are dying, slaughtered in heinous manner  by<br/>
bats, bugs, rats, snakes, spiders and even *shudders* ORCS. Why you ask?<br/>
They have naught but rusty weapons to defend themselves with, an item you<br/>
would rather destroy than even carry! I am here on the behalf of the Arm the<br/>
Children Campaign, buying your Fine Steel weapons...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Those laying siege to the Temple of Cazic Thule responded to my please,<br/>
opening their hearts and backpacks, even slaying the vile lizards at the<br/>
entrance for me so I might waddle my encumberedness towards civilization<br/>
with a minimum of perishing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I returned then to that part of the world to face danger once again...in<br/>
the Lower portions of the pit known as Guk. On my way I saw a brave hunter<br/>
waiting upon a frogluk known as the Squire. I wished him luck that this<br/>
fiend (erm, though their impression of me was significantly better than mine<br/>
of them) and offered to lessen his undoubted load of collars. He would not<br/>
accept my offer of payment and I continued on with my new magical item. The<br/>
spiders of Lesser Faydark would soon feel my vengeance for my various<br/>
deaths.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But I was not ready to seek them yet, I made straight for the Undead side<br/>
of Guk, quickly discovering a pair of Shin Gauntlets. Thereafter I was to<br/>
die repeatedly in search of  Grieves, in large part due to going as far as<br/>
the Bedroom in my search.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Authors note: The point of doing the spider silk quest so many times was to<br/>
have many spare drums in the bank for running back to LGuk, at the end I had<br/>
like 4 on me :o)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;During this time,  a passing Troll, totally without petition, gave me a<br/>
Bloodstained mantle to aid me in my efforts. In the end I left without<br/>
grieves, some day I will have to return...but I had another appointment in<br/>
the Temple...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Friends, lets get weapons OFF the streets and keep our children safe, I<br/>
have been authorized by the Guards of Norrath to administer the Guards Fine<br/>
Steel Weapons Buy-back program...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Once again, the people heard my message. This time I offered the fine steel<br/>
items to thoroughly screened Law-Abiding Citizens (there was no trade window<br/>
hanky panky, a very good indicator of high moral standing) from Freeport to<br/>
Kelethin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This Weeks Epilogue:<br/>
<br/>
My newbie bard is still level 6, despite his deaths in lower Guk. he now has<br/>
95pp and many nice pieces of armour, leveling now should be pretty fast.<br/>
None of the pieces were gained by begging, but only by be vocal about who I<br/>
was, what I was doing, and always always, offering (if not TOO vigorously)<br/>
to pay for things. yes, I think trying to be entertaining defiantly helps<br/>
too. He has stopped along the way to help folks if he could, this has not<br/>
been a mercenary effort, he is just having fun, but knowing a few tricks.<br/>
<br/>
There has been a long running gag with the entire zone of Ocean of Tears,<br/>
which I won&#39;t relate now (I am not sure how well it would translate) but my<br/>
young bard  *did* get a guild invite last night from a good fellow who heard<br/>
me in Cazic AND OOT. I am willing to bet they are a good guild too, at least<br/>
attitude wise, from my short tells with him. While I am not planning on<br/>
joining any guild at all, I do plan to seek out their members when hunting. <br/>
<br/>
The point of this &quot;series&quot; is to pass along any tricks to young bards that<br/>
might help, to make the case that there is no need to beg and KS and all the<br/>
other ugliness to get ahead, and to share a bit of the total blast I have<br/>
had with a newbie bard on a strange server.<br/>
