<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011826871">Charm - like you know -- make hot keys for your pet commands.  /pet attack<br/>
/pet back off /pet guard here  /pet guard me<br/>
<br/>
The default condition for your pet is (or was before this patch where who<br/>
knows what it might be) &quot;guard me&quot; so either before or after you charm get<br/>
hit by the mob you want your pet to attack - ok with HG maybe not a<br/>
practical suggestion - but with orcs or pickclaws - charm something else<br/>
besides the one that is hittin on you - unless you really have too.  (Charm<br/>
is a great taunt - if something is frenzied on your cleric or a weak party<br/>
member - charm it to taunt it off.)<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, charm the mob then quick target the victim and click pet attack.<br/>
Then re-target pet and get busy with a re-charm.  I find that I need to keep<br/>
charming as soon as I recover from the first charm cast.  Barely any time to<br/>
issue commands.  For perspective, it&#39;s about as easy to me to weave 3 songs<br/>
as it is for John Kim to weave 4 (my guess to the relative difficulty any<br/>
ways - sure I can do it - if all goes right.  But in reality, 2 songs at a<br/>
time - in full combat --  is my practical limit.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you miss a note or get a resist and pet come to you.  Then you<br/>
re-charm and pet frenzies on a party member.  Now quick do pet back off and<br/>
he calms down.  You ranger buddy calms down too now :-)<br/>
<br/>
Putz around with some gnolls and stuff that is real easy in order to get<br/>
your hot keys and clicking routines down pat.  Heck, I get resists from<br/>
gnoll pups so you should be able to practice everything.<br/>

		Perhaps the new patch will help me, but I have a very<br/>
difficult time with<br/>
		Charm.  I&#39;ve played with it in East Commonlands against the<br/>
orcs there and<br/>
		just can&#39;t seem to get the hang of knowing when to recharm<br/>
the mob.<br/>
		Switching between targetting my charmed mob and the one I&#39;m<br/>
fighting is<br/>
		extremely difficult since I can&#39;t seem to get F1 to work as<br/>
advertised for<br/>
		switching pet/mob.  I have to either click on the mob or<br/>
adjust my position<br/>
		and use &quot;target closest NPC&quot; to switch - both of which are<br/>
tricky at best.<br/>
<br/>
		Can anyone point me at a dissertation on this subject other<br/>
than what I&#39;ve<br/>
		read here or is it just practice, practice, practice?<br/>
