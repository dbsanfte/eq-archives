&gt;<br/>
&gt;1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was supposed to<br/>
&gt;happen?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sounds like a bug.  Everyone else I&#39;ve heard has told me that it<br/>
simply stops you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck again if I<br/>
&gt;try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to pull my<br/>
&gt;corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You should be able to /corpse it from anywhere.  I&#39;ve even heard that now<br/>
you can /corpse out of Lava (perhaps they increased the /corpse range).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3)  Why did the locate song not lead me to the other player&#39;s corpse?  My<br/>
&gt;theory is that his corpse was not in the Butcherblock zone but in the Ocean<br/>
&gt;of Tears zone.  Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the right<br/>
&gt;direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you are looking<br/>
&gt;for?  If the other player&#39;s corpse was indeed in the Ocean of Tears zone<br/>
&gt;then I guess the answer to this question is yes.  If his corpse was in the<br/>
&gt;Butcherblock zone then it makes the situation even more puzzling.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>MAJOR bug there.  Unless his corpse was beneath the world - in which case,<br/>
it DID lead you to him. Only his body was a million miles under you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on the<br/>
&gt;bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most likely an NPC, actually - probably one who was lost.  Possibly a Bard<br/>
with Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre, but you&#39;d have to ask around.  FYI in weird<br/>
situations, don&#39;t be afraid to hammer on the &quot;Screenshot&quot; key a few times.<br/>
It&#39;s amazing what details you missed that you can locate later from a<br/>
screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to /petition.<br/>
&gt;Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>
&gt;retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I sure<br/>
&gt;hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to retrieve it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They will certainly retrieve his - but what I would do is petition a GM<br/>
with the initial problem, and then offer to attempt the retrieval on your<br/>
own, if they will watch to make sure that you do not get trapped again.  It<br/>
DOES seem to be a bug, but it&#39;s not verifiable (like a corpse under the<br/>
world is) so they will be hard pressed to prove it, and the hard rule is<br/>
&quot;If you cannot prove it was a bug, you cannot help them.&quot;  You can mention<br/>
to them that the reason you want them to &quot;watch over you&quot; is because the<br/>
bug will likely cause you to die before you can /corpse your body.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and have you thought about using the jig o&#39; vigor to restore your lost<br/>
stamina?  I never thought about it before...<br/>
