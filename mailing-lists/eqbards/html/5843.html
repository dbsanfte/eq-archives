<b>Subject:</b> The thrill of being a bard: was sonorous clounding message <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412866963">My female half-elf Bard (Crier on Fennin Ro) has leveled up to 18th so much<br/>
faster than my monk did (monk&#39;s 24th) it&#39;s kind of disappointing.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want the fun of being a Bard to run out so quickly!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve started numerous characters and have had the most fun being the Bard<br/>
without question.  The only character that was almost as much &quot;raw fun&quot; was<br/>
the Troll Shadowknight that I played up to level 5 and deleted (I was<br/>
spreading myself too thin over too many characters).  I figure in two months<br/>
when my Bard is 50th and the Plane of Fear is getting old (sarcasm) I think<br/>
I&#39;ll start a Troll Shaman or something.  Lotta fun.<br/>
<br/>
The only stressful thing about being a Bard is dropping things through the<br/>
cracks in the Inventory slots moved to the hotkeys.  I dropped a set of Bladed<br/>
Thulian Claws the other night and they&#39;re LORE.  They were destroyed before<br/>
they hit the ground - 700pp flushed.  That was Saturday night and I still<br/>
haven&#39;t fully recovered from it - I was genuinely enraged at the game eating<br/>
that much time and money (substatial at level 17/18, I assure you).  My<br/>
stomach hurts when I think about it.  If anyone on Fennin Ro feels like<br/>
selling me another set (or perhaps a Silvery War Axe), please look me up.<br/>

&gt; I needed any foraged food or water.  I said I forage as well and had plenty<br/>
&gt; thanks.  I got a kick out of his next statement which was &quot;Is there anything<br/>
&gt; that you don&#39;t do?!?&quot;  As I said before, gotta love being a bard.<br/>
