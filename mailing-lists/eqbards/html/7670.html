<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768916263">i was wondering too.  i have been using this song a lot lately.  our mana<br/>
regens a lot faster than i thought, and 300dmg AE is a nice little bard harm<br/>
touch.  in fact i think our mana regens faster than an SK&#39;s cycle time for<br/>
HT.  now the first time i used it, i saw did not see my health go down, i<br/>
could have been too far away.  the second time, i thought i saw my health go<br/>
down, but it was definitely not for 300dmg, as i was only down about 150hp.<br/>
the third time, on the ghoul lord, i definitely nailed him for 300 dmg.  i<br/>
know i was very close to him as he was walking away, because the song<br/>
knocked me back several feet when i cast it, but my health definitely did<br/>
not go down.  300dmg would have been a bubble and i know i did not lose<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
also, though 300dmg doesn&#39;t seem like a lot, it most certainly saved my ass<br/>
on the ghoul lord that night.  we had a group that had no business taking on<br/>
the lord and 2 boks.  3 clerics, 2 warriors, 1 bard.  well when it was all<br/>
over everyone was dead, but with the dirge doing 300dmg to the lord (the<br/>
above example was a different time) and fear scaring the 2 boks away at the<br/>
end of the fight, the last person standing was me right after the only other<br/>
person left, one of the warriors, looted the ykesha and died.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone else noticed that Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge still <br/>
&gt; hurts us when we<br/>
&gt; cast it?<br/>
&gt; Didn&#39;t I read somewhere that this got fixed in one of the <br/>
&gt; recent patches, or<br/>
&gt; am I hallucinating?<br/>
