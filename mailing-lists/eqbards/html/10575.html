<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481095435">When was this broken? I remember for quite awhile it was broken, then after <br/>
some patch where they claimed it was fixed, I memmed it and put good use to <br/>
it dueling a druid buddy of mine. He didn&#39;t know he was wasting his mana <br/>
Dotting me. =P<br/>

&gt;song<br/>
&gt;to see if it was really fixed? I remembered to do it once, but couldn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt;my cleric friend to wait for me to mem it. He cast dispell on himself <br/>
&gt;before<br/>
&gt;I had a chance to try it out, the ungrateful lout!!<br/>
