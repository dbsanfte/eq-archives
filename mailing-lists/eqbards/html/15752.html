<div id="ygrps-yiv-902215907">Hrm.... Actually, bard and warrior items are dropping a lot more than<br/>
cleric items on my server.  There are nights where the armor is falling out<br/>
of the sky, but most nights there are very few drops.  We cleared the<br/>
entire zone several times, only to see 3 or 4 pieces drop outside of<br/>
Maestro and Inny.<br/>
<br/>
On Maestro:  Any NPC is harder when they are duel wielding (pretty common<br/>
knowledge), however,  the last time we faced Maestro he was duel wielding<br/>
the 6note and evensong.  Let me tell you that he raped us repeatedly.  I<br/>
would match him up against Vox or Naggy and he would have won with more<br/>
than half life.  We finally beat him down on our 4th try, but it was the<br/>
best fight I&#39;ve seen in a long time.  I think there were eight people left<br/>
after the battle  = ( )<br/>
