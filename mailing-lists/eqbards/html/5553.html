<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375276711">Hi all , <br/>
    Well , to put it bluntly i&#39;m bored . I am lvl 38 now , a smidge away from <br/>
39 and i quit.  I got bored with guk , i got bored with playing , hunting or <br/>
otherwise.  I think for me , i miss open spaces, i miss places like lake <br/>
rathe , lesser fay , or steamfont . I&#39;m sick of being confined no matter what <br/>
i&#39;m doing , i mean i got to camp the undead tower in the cav room. got great <br/>
exp /loot , but for the most part i was bored. I thought and thought and <br/>
thought what had changed , why all of a sudden i was so bored. It came to me <br/>
, i can&#39;t solo effectively anywhere anymore it seems.  I like to group and <br/>
hunt , but sometimes i&#39;d like to try hunting solo  , and i&#39;ve found i can&#39;t <br/>
AT ALL , i know bards are meant to be group oriented classes , but i wish i <br/>
could kill something myself . Aww hell this turned into a rant , sorry. But i <br/>
still love this game , i miss my friends ( who have blown by me in the 2 <br/>
weeks i haven&#39;t played , guess they can smell 50 and went nuts ) and i want <br/>
to play. but where and what ? what did you high level people hunt to have fun <br/>
, i mean i get bored after like 15 minutes of being in the same spot now. I <br/>
was thinking of mistmoore , but i want a little more info first . Sorry , <br/>
someone please help me out , give me somf fun things i can do or something.<br/>
