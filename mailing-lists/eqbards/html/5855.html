 </span></blockquote>Did they say it was live? I know it was on the test server, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think it is in game yet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also a ranger and am on the ranger mailing list - no one has mentioned<br/>
finding anything strange yet.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I&#39;ve noticed is that rarely when I forage I&#39;ll get no item,<br/>
and no failure message either. Perhaps those are the times when I&#39;m supposed<br/>
to be foraging something ELSE, but it is only half implemented? A friend of<br/>
mine said that he noticed this lack of message bug usually while in Greater<br/>
Faydark. (I had just thought it was a lag thing or some minor bug before.)<br/>
