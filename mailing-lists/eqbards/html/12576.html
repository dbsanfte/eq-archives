<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662689431">that&#39;s how it is in our raids.  our guild has set up a pretty complex but<br/>
fair system of lottos as of late, as all we do are planes and dragons.  lot<br/>
of stuff is like this, like mistwalkers are rangers before druids, staff is<br/>
priests before paladins, etc.  we had a vox raid have a paladin win the<br/>
staff and druid win a mistwalker, that was pretty much the last straw for a<br/>
lot of people.  i passed up an orb lotto to a bard who didn&#39;t have any hate<br/>
weps yet.  ooh 9 STR yummy =)  besides i just want the damn drum.<br/>

&gt; this is a Bard <br/>
&gt; only lotto :)<br/>

&gt; Does great with a Ykesha, as once the orb procs the Ykesha is rarely <br/>
&gt; resisted.<br/>
