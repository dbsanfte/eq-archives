<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410114044">On the loc casuing missed notes, we called them fizzle spots. Seems like if<br/>
you are casting repeated fizzles or getting repeated missed notes out of<br/>
line with what you ordinarily get, it will stop if you move just a small<br/>
amount. Of course, most folks percieve this as BS. My own theory is is can&#39;t<br/>
hurt to move a bit and even if it doesn&#39;t work, it may make you feel as if<br/>
you improved your chances.<br/>
<br/>
The Concert Hall board has a thread starting about a Velious npc that makes<br/>
bard armor:<br/>
<br/>
in the new dwarf city, on Velious, there is a tavern named &quot;The Broken<br/>
Glacier&quot;. Down stares standing in front of the fire is a dwarf named<br/>
&quot;Leifur&quot;. When you hail him he says his family has always made armor for<br/>
bards and that he can make some for you! <br/>
<br/>
Here are the quest lists:<br/>
Helm: 3 pieces of crushed coral and a corroded plate helm<br/>
Breastplate: 3 flawless diamonds and a corroded breastplate<br/>
Arms: 3 flawed emeralds and a corroded plate vambraces<br/>
Bracers: 3 crushed flme emeralds and a corroded plate bracer<br/>
Gauntlets: 3 crushed topaz and corroded gauntlets<br/>

<br/>
