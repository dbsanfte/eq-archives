&gt; &gt; I&#39;d probably keep myself bound in a city. But then I play with clerics,<br/>
&gt; &gt; so I haven&#39;t run back to my corpse in months. Corpse recovery is much<br/>
&gt; &gt; more an issue than mere running for your corpse at higher levels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Actually I doubt it.  If you were fighting in a dungeon, why would<br/>
&gt; you leave yourself bound in a city and make the easiest way of getting<br/>
&gt; back to your corpse a cleric res?  That would be silly, especially since<br/>
&gt; you pointed out that corpse retrieval is much more of the issue.  If you<br/>
&gt; were in a group, and they need you to help out with retrieval, why would<br/>
&gt; it be in your best interest to waste 30 minutes of the group&#39;s time and<br/>
&gt; 600 mana for the druid to go over their, pick you up to the nearest gate,<br/>
&gt; and wait as you run the rest of the way back.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doubt all you want, but if you think a naked bard with a spare weapon in<br/>
their hand is anything more than a liability on a corpse retrieval in<br/>
lower guk or deep in Sol B you&#39;re dreaming. Usually the way it goes is<br/>
this. I show up back at my bind point in Freeport. If enough people<br/>
survived to make it back to the death point, I get res&#39;d. If almost<br/>
everyone died, people start sending out tells to get a rescue party or 2<br/>
made up that can fight their way back into the corpses. Once that party<br/>
makes their way in, the clerics start resurrecting, usually the bard<br/>
first if the body is at hand so the bard can fire up the mana song.<br/>
Doubt all you want but I played deep in lower guk from L35-45 and then<br/>
started doing fire giants and other deep Sol B stuff after that and<br/>
that&#39;s how it always worked on our server with our groups.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	No one is saying there aren&#39;t other options other than running<br/>
&gt; from freeport to lower guk at the later levels.  However, if you have the<br/>
&gt; option of binding yourself right outside the dungeon, you&#39;d be silly not<br/>
&gt; to do it.  After all, you can&#39;t gate, so the bind is only really useful if<br/>
&gt; you die.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At higher levels an unarmored and weakly armed player is more of a<br/>
liability than a bonus when doing corpse recovery. I was in a 2 group<br/>
expedition after fire giants and skarlon one time where a warrior was<br/>
one of the people that died, and as he was bound in neriak he did come<br/>
back before the rescue party reached his body. He also died again rather<br/>
quickly. Unless you keep a full set of high quality armor and weapons in<br/>
the bank I think you&#39;re nuts trying to go deep into a dungeon with the<br/>
rescue party, unless you like multiple depths.<br/>
<br/>
Granted I haven&#39;t played my bard in about a month except for special<br/>
events like dragon hunts so maybe these dungeons are so overcamped now<br/>
you can just wander down to the hand room naked to get your body, but it<br/>
certainly wasn&#39;t like that when I did play, and binding near the dungeon<br/>
would have been a waste of time when I did.<br/>
