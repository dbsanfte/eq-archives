&gt; seen, it looks like the only way from one side of<br/>
&gt; the zone to the other (ie: Exit to exit) is by<br/>
&gt; swimming.. If this is in fact true, will there be<br/>
&gt; a problem with the deepwater goblins (or other water<br/>
&gt; nasties) if I swim around the edge just to get<br/>
&gt; from zone to zone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right. You have to swim or levitate across. Or get a boat. I<br/>
haven&#39;t been there for a few weeks but I never encountered anything but<br/>
maybe a few sharks in the water. It might of changed but I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
Near the center of the lake there are goblins underwater, but you won&#39;t be<br/>
going anywhere near there hopefully.<br/>
<br/>
Ohhh.. there&#39;s one named that swims around a lot. Prince Kermyt. He thrash<br/>
your evil friend. But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much you can do but swim fast<br/>
and hope you don&#39;t see him. I&#39;ve only see him once.</div>
