<b>Subject:</b> Interesting comment about Charisma <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359606974">A fellow on an enchanter&#39;s board said he&#39;d played around with<br/>
several enchanters of differing charisma during beta.  One of<br/>
the effects he claims charisma has is at attracting a<br/>
monster&#39;s attention.  i.e. just as high charisma makes you<br/>
move liked by NPCs, it makes you more hated by monsters.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that could explain all the strange going ons about<br/>
bards being attacked in preference to others, even if the bard<br/>
is not playing a song?  Maybe people can comment how often<br/>
they&#39;ve had this problem, and list their charisma.<br/>
