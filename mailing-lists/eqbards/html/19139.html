 </span></blockquote>Who&#39;s arguing?  We&#39;re discussing the fact that the people who are supposedly<br/>
in-the-know don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t make a mistake; he just didn&#39;t know. Yes he admitted it, yes<br/>
people overreact and flame him for the merest slip-up but by his own<br/>
admission he has very little idea about issues pertaining to Bards. This<br/>
doesn&#39;t do much to foster confidence in the people who play Bards and who<br/>
hope that our issues will be dealt with little more than a &quot;Doh! Shows you<br/>
how much I know about bard songs :)&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Like I said, if you can do the job better, go apply.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No thanks.  I think he does a great job of addressing a myriad problems and<br/>
shrugging off more than his fair share of verbal abuse.<br/>
<br/>
He just needs to work on his Bards a bit more. ;)<br/>
