<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064573278">Okay, here&#39;s my second one, again please feel free to comment -- one of the<br/>
joys of being a bard is that we have such varied and unique talents.  I&#39;d<br/>
hate to see our new songs be disappointing revisions of existing abilities.<br/>
<br/>
The Chromatic Scale<br/>
Level: 36th<br/>
Skill: Singing<br/>
Description: A chromatic scale is all the notes an instrument is capable of<br/>
producing, generally played starting from the lowest to the highest and then<br/>
back down; slurred up (ligato), tongued down (staccato).  The Chromatic<br/>
Scale when song by the bard would act much as the Vampiric Embrace necro<br/>
spell in that it imparts a proc to melee attacks however the twist is that<br/>
there would be 5 different types which randomly kick off: magic, fire, cold,<br/>
disease and poison based attacks.  These would be DD&#39;s - there by filling in<br/>
our missing DD ability, but in a uniquely bard fashion (group based, becomes<br/>
more powerful as you add members and err... randomly good -- maybe. hehe).<br/>
Verant of course would come up with some cute little chromatic sparkles to<br/>
surround us and multi colored blasts as the proc goes off. :)<br/>
<br/>
PS: For those D&D fans, recall the Chromatic* line of spells.  Thanks to<br/>
whoever mentioned the confusion bit and D&D earlier -- ya got me thinking.</div>
