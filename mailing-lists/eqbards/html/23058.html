 </span></blockquote>No, a bard&#39;s song should NEVER be the primary breath source. The range is<br/>
much too small and while it lasts longer than most songs you can twist, I<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to risk it. Keep it incase someone misses a timer and<br/>
starts to drown, you can get it going fast enough to save them since there&#39;s<br/>
little chance someone will be able to cast enduring breath on them fast<br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
Stamina is a major problem in kedge since it goes down and doesn&#39;t come back<br/>
up unless you get hit with Invigor so the stamina song should be cycled in<br/>
there during a battle for a few zaps. Lancers on the top level hit very hard<br/>
for their level, a decent group should be able to handle single pulls at<br/>
30th level. My ranger did lancers from 35-42 but I only risked them solo at<br/>
38th level (it&#39;s possible at 35 but I didn&#39;t want to risk it.). My necro<br/>
can&#39;t quite manage it at 30th level although a Mage can solo with their 29th<br/>
level earth pet.<br/>
<br/>
Watching the spawns move about is key, it&#39;s not rough to single pull there.<br/>
There is a high level PH on the top level, it can be a Piercer (35ish),<br/>
Impaler (40-42), or the Fierce Impaler (42-43, drops Gloomwater or Darksea).<br/>
Pulling around the high level fish isn&#39;t tough, lull shouldn&#39;t be needed<br/>
although it might help.<br/>
<br/>
As for the sharkskin drum ... only seen that mob once and it didn&#39;t have the<br/>
drum. It&#39;s kind of deep, very much a 45+ area of that zone. I love kedge and<br/>
can&#39;t wait till I&#39;m going into Unrest to steal people from the basement camp<br/>
to go swimming with my bard.</div>
