They were just a bunch of conspiracy theorist idiots then.  Who in their<br/>
right mind would even THINK of doing that?  Even if, for some bizzare<br/>
reason, you DID destroy it before suiciding, (if you had had it in the first<br/>
place) they would have &quot;won&quot; since you didn&#39;t have it anymore and would now<br/>
have to wait on another.  What a bunch of morons.  I would have had to give<br/>
them a huuuuuuge piece of my mind at that point.  There isw just no excuse<br/>
for such stupidity.<br/>

&gt;You could have easily defended your honor, though at cost.  Had you offered<br/>
&gt;to suicide against the nearest frog and then given her permission to loot<br/>
&gt;your corpse she would have seen you had no mask.  Of course getting back<br/>
&gt;there to get another would have been tough, and the lost xp sad.  But more<br/>
&gt;than likely the embarrassment her group would have felt after you killed<br/>
&gt;yourself to prove your honor would have made them feel compelled to help<br/>

&gt;Well, I mosied on down to Lower guk, naked, following the excellent<br/>
&gt;instructions given.<br/>
&gt;Went down naked;)<br/>
&gt;Made it to the Tower allright, and to the assassin room. This is where the<br/>
&gt;MAnure hit the proverbial fan (sighs sadly).<br/>
&gt;I waited to look up the ladder until All the casting was done. I peeked my<br/>
&gt;head up to see what the room looked like, and dropped back down.<br/>
&gt;Not one second after I did this, some dark elf woman jumps down, and calls<br/>
&gt;me a Thief. Loot thief. every name in the bloody book..<br/>
&gt;all I said was &quot;eh?&quot;<br/>
&gt;and she went on to say She saw me on the ladder, then the corpse<br/>
&gt;dissappeared, then I &quot;ran&quot;<br/>
&gt; I didnt run, I was at the bottom of the ladder, politely waiting for<br/>
&gt;someoen to say &quot;Carapace for loot, or Mask for loot&quot;<br/>
&gt;Supposedly, I &quot;Stole&quot; The mask, and now im going to be blacklisted, my name<br/>
&gt;will mean nothing, no one will trust me. she start screaming out loud over<br/>
&gt;shout, saying no one should trust me, that I am &quot;an (insert colorful verb<br/>
&gt;here) loot thief. No matter what I said to her, , or over Shout. no one<br/>
&gt;would listen to me.(Lynriss was her name. Fibtik, Wokka, arthon where in<br/>
