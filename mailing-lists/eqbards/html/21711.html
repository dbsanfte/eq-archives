Subject: [eqbards] OT still<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I posted my rant, and since chances are that I won&#39;t last the night,<br/>
here&#39;s a copy for y&#39;all:<br/>
&lt;----------------&gt;<br/>
<br/>
1) The person depicted in the &quot;rape&quot; story was not  necessarily 14 years<br/>
old.  She was 14 *seasons* old.  Now in a normal world, this could mean<br/>
anything from 3 and a half (4 seasons a year!), to  a whole lot older.  I<br/>
think it&#39;s safe to assume from the generalized descriptions that the<br/>
character is not 3 and a half, but to assume that it&#39;s the story of the<br/>
rape of a minor is reading a whole lot into the story.  Fact is, it tells<br/>
me a whole lot about how the &quot;higher ups&quot; think - as Freud said, sometimes<br/>
the cigar IS just a cigar!  14 seasons could mean 14th level - and judging<br/>
by the effectiveness of the poison she used, I&#39;d have to say she was at<br/>
least that!<br/>
<br/>
2) Double standards, Verant.  Or does GM Zatosia have special permission to<br/>
be particularly gruesome?  Frankly, if I were you, I&#39;d be sending that GM<br/>
in for some counseling, or be worried about another Columbine in your own<br/>
offices.<br/>
<br/>
3) Intellectual property: If you truly want to force the issue, Wizards of<br/>
the Coast would be more than happy to discuss the issue of intellectual<br/>
properties with you.  Names are not the only thing that can be considered<br/>
intellectual property, and frankly, you&#39;ve stolen a LOT from WOTC<br/>
properties.  Also, prosecuting ONE instance, while ignoring or encouraging<br/>
literally thousands of others is discrimination in the most basic<br/>
sense.  You are choosing who to prosecute, and only applying the rules<br/>
where it suits you. This is not fair to anyone concerned.  If you are going<br/>
to ban someone for use of &quot;copyrighted materials&quot;, then you need to jump on<br/>
a lot of cases - not just this one that happens to offend your<br/>
sensibilities.<br/>
<br/>
4) Derivative work: You are ENTIRELY off-base calling those stories<br/>
&quot;derivative works.&quot;  Who is your lawyer?  Lionel Hutz???<br/>

<br/>
 From the U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Circular 14:<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freeadvice.com/gov_material/copyright-office-derivative-works-ci">http://www.freeadvice.com/gov_material/copyright-office-derivative-works-ci</a><br/>
rcular-14.htm)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;A &quot;derivative work&quot;-that is, a work that is based on (or derived from)<br/>
one or more already existing works-is copyrightable if it includes what the<br/>
copyright law calls an &quot;original work of authorship.&quot; Derivative works,<br/>
also known as &quot;new versions,&quot; include such works as translations, musical<br/>
arrangements, dramatizations, fictionalizations, art reproductions, and<br/>
condensations. Any work in which the editorial revisions, annotations,<br/>
elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original<br/>
work of authorship is a &quot;derivative work&quot; or &quot;new version.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thus, these stories, while making references to characters in a copyrighted<br/>
work, are not, in fact, derivative works, unless you count GM Zatosia&#39;s<br/>
heroin-addict nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
In short, this was an unfair ruling, completely discriminatory, and far<br/>
more inflammatory than the stories ever were.<br/>
<br/>
When are you going to learn to live and let live, instead of burning<br/>
everyone woman with a wart and a black cat?<br/>
