<div id="ygrps-yiv-308865165">I&#39;m at 39 - and my new favorite zone is Kedge..  There are lots of people in<br/>
your level range kicking some serious butt.<br/>

You have to go to the 3rd level and below to get good loot - but the xp<br/>
rocks everywhere...<br/>

One of the best Zone Guides I&#39;ve ever seen has been written (by a Bard no<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Final Hell Level....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyone got any tips on good hunting places at level 45? I am currently<br/>
&gt; almost 1 bub into 45 and am hoping to be out of 45 by the time Kunark is<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been fighting bats/bugs in sol b (I like camping stone spider<br/>
&gt; room.....lots of space nice an easy to charm mobs), should I stay here or<br/>
&gt; is there other &#39;Hot Spots&#39; for exp that maybe I should try.....I don&#39;t<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; guard killing, it is dull and boring...<br/>
