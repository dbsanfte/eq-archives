<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-434103460">Who cares about the proc?  Most weapons don&#39;t average<br/>
more than 1 proc every 45 seconds or so anyway<br/>
(contrary to most people&#39;s belief that they average 4<br/>
or 5 procs per fight).  The damage/delay is better<br/>
than the ykesha and ebw (not taking into account magic<br/>
numbers and lower delay,etc).  I guess I still don&#39;t<br/>
see why you guys think it is crappy.  Granted it is<br/>
off a dragon and is only marginally better than your<br/>
ykesh or ebw.  However, unless you have a planar<br/>
weapon I would consider this better.  Anyway, anyone<br/>
on Tunare who think this weapon is crappy--I will<br/>
gladly take your crappy weapon!<br/>

&gt; Just looks like a dagger.<br/>
&gt; It would be a great weapon if not for 2 things.<br/>
&gt; 1.  There are next to no summoned creatures in the<br/>
&gt; game, at least at the<br/>
&gt; level you&#39;re likely to obtain this weapon.<br/>
&gt; 2. The proc rate on it is perhaps the worst I have<br/>
&gt; ever seen.  It hardly<br/>
&gt; ever goes off.<br/>
