&gt; &gt; &gt;2.  What&#39;s up with Farie Dragons?  The little guys with butterfly <br/>
&gt;wings.  Are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;they monsters to hunt?  Do they have a bad faction adjustment when <br/>
&gt;killed.  Do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;they have good treasure?  No one seems to be hunting them.  Yes they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;beautiful but that doesn&#39;t seem to stop most people.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They reduce your faction with SkyTalons, whatever that is.  (Dragons <br/>
&gt;maybe?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They sometimes have a gem or piece of jewelry.  No cash.<br/>

&gt;Hmmmm....I hunt Faerie Dragons (known as Fae Drakes) in the Lesser<br/>
&gt;Faydark...sometimes they hunt ME!  However, the reason I hunt them is<br/>
&gt;for the cash - most I get have one or two gold on them...<br/>

Because of this I avoid harming fay creatures if I can help it, especially <br/>
due to the possible faction hit. I also remember once when i was brand new <br/>
and about 3rd level i attacked what I thought was a pixie trixter, but <br/>
turned out to be a faerie duchess. I had lasted all of 2 seconds.<br/>
