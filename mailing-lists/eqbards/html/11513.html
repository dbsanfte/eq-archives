&gt; 1. Is Lullaby bugged or has it had its effectiveness reduced? I cant seem to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; keep low, low greens asleep. I get the head nods message and they continue <br/>
&gt; to attack. From my experience and the posts of other Bards seems like this<br/>
&gt; song has become almost useless. Is this just something we will have to live <br/>
&gt; with?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; REPSONSE - Nothing has changed - though it does lose some of its <br/>
&gt; effectiveness against higher level creatures.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually take this as a good sign.  Lullaby was not supposed<br/>
to have been changed, but something they did changed it<br/>
indirectly.  That would mean if we/they ever find out what the<br/>
problem is, we deserve a fix.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, he could be lying...<br/>
