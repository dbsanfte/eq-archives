Possibly, but you&#39;re assuming that the only reason someone will go <br/>
anon/roleplay is to avoid people asking them for the services that <br/>
their class can provide.  It&#39;s not the only reason present and it&#39;s <br/>
hard to say if it&#39;s the most common reason or not.  Many Hate/Fear <br/>
raids, for example, ask that everyone goes Anon/RP so they don&#39;t get <br/>
raid crashers. i.e. People would do a /w all 50 55 and if a lot of <br/>
people showed up in Hate, then they&#39;d know it was safe to port up.<br/>
<br/>
And, btw, that 74 count on Xegony more than likely missed me, since I <br/>
usually play during primetime and have been on Roleplay since they <br/>
introduced the ability.  It&#39;s all those damn stalkers. :)<br/>
