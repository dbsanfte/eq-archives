<br/>
a PVP zone is a Players Versus Player zone.<br/>
<br/>
You can find them in Qeynos (next to warriors guild), Freeport (The Arena)<br/>
and Kaladim (this one appears broken), and The Arena, In Lake Rathe (which<br/>
is also considered a &#39;city&#39; zone, so you can get bound at the entrance)<br/>
You will know you are in a PVP section from the &#39;You have entered a PvP<br/>
Area&#39; over and over and over (much like bardsong spam). I&#39;ve not been in<br/>
an arena with another player, but I belive the idea here is, you can be<br/>
attacked and killed :&gt; Be careful =)<br/>
<br/>
I also have had the &#39;stuck&#39; song problem, and when i try and sing another<br/>
song I get &#39;Your song ends&#39; over and over. I had to go over to the actual<br/>
picture of the boot (Jig of Vigor was stuck playing, but it wasn&#39;t<br/>
actually working) and right mouse button on it. (This is how casters<br/>
remove self-inflicted buffs, also works for bardsongs). You CANNOT remove<br/>
another persons buff they have casted on you, however (such as a !@#<br/>
broken SoW).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I have heard some people on the list serve mention PvP zones what are<br/>
&gt;they?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, on a seperate note, I am having the problem where one of my songs<br/>
&gt;will <br/>
&gt;get stuck on and I can&#39;t turn it off to switch songs. This is very<br/>
&gt;annoying. <br/>
&gt;It won&#39;t turn off till I zone or camp and come back. Any idea how I can <br/>
&gt;prevent this? I think it is a bug or something. Has anyone else had this <br/>
&gt;problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you,<br/>
