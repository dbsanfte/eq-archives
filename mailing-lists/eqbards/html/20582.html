<div id="ygrps-yiv-543298914">I tried this on Minos and reavers.  The reavers I could handle some of the<br/>
time, but the minos were nearly always too tough for me.  You must have had<br/>
better equipment than I did, they just did way too much damage and knocked<br/>
off my songs way too often for this to work on minos effectively.  Ditto<br/>
with the big spiders.  If it wasn&#39;t low blue there was no way this would<br/>
work for me unless the mob was weak for its con.<br/>

One question?  How the heck did you have HtH at 100 starting at level 14?<br/>
It can&#39;t hit 100 till level 19.<br/>

Muddites, Mino&#39;s (careful on big ones, sometimes had to zone to runnyeye)<br/>
I had hand to hand at 100 since level 14 (I started using it in some groups<br/>
with all-instrument at level 12)<br/>

Basically there wasn&#39;t anything blue I couldn&#39;t handle if I was careful<br/>
I got about 1.5 bubble of xp per hour.  Went from 18 to 20 in about 3 days<br/>
