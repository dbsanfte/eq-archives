<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728269375">Last night, while we were camping the &quot;disco room&quot; in Old Seb, Miriana&#39;s<br/>
guild made a foray into the lower levels.  They are excellent players - mid<br/>
50&#39;s and great equipment, etc. etc.  I heard they had gone in Sat night as<br/>
well and cleared to the lair.  By the time we finished, cleared our way to<br/>
the teleport out and were divving up sellables  - a few of their team<br/>
started appearing at the orb:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Trakanon - ouch!&quot;<br/>
&quot;We got owned!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Somehow we agro&#39;d him and he wasted us.&quot;<br/>
&quot;He teleported me to some room filled with &#39;shrooms!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were working the lower level and were not really intending to fight the<br/>
dragon but I guess he got mad at them and showed them his powers.  Grats to<br/>
LoD - they are the first I know of on our server (Inny) to brave the lower<br/>
levels of &quot;Even Lower Guk&quot; and other than one odd dragon encounter I think<br/>
that they were doing quite well.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I finished the Jarsath Medallion Quest - one of three<br/>
needed for getting the key to Veeshan&#39;s Peak.  You need to kill the ancient<br/>
jarsath in Firona Vie, the bloodgill maurader that guards the gates to the<br/>
underwater zone in Lake of Ill Omen, and find the piece in the Swamp of No<br/>
Hope. Then off to Timourus Deep and the archeologist.  Give him 3 pieces and<br/>
he makes the medal.  Gives it back to you because &quot;oh my! I feel this is<br/>
cursed! here take it back!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To get a key to Veeshan&#39;s Peak, you need the 3 medals (each requires 3 sub<br/>
pieces) and &#39;proof of Trakanon&#39;s demise.&#39; So, I have to wonder, will Trak<br/>
drop one &quot;proof&quot; item each time or will he drop multiples.  If you have to<br/>
kill Trak one time for each person that needs a key and you want to take 36<br/>
people to Veeshan&#39;s..... well, you can see, it&#39;s going to be a while before<br/>
ppl start seeing Veeshan&#39;s.  Heck, it&#39;s looking like Trak is going to be a<br/>
real challenge on his own.<br/>

p.s. I dinged 52 finally - soloing in Dreadlands.  Then made almost a bub<br/>
for 6 hours of fighting to, from & in the Disco Room.  And Nillipus March of<br/>
the Wee - played with Selos Drums adds 33 AC!  I have been trying to play it<br/>
at the outset of combat.  At least folks can benefit on the first hit.<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. The enchanter in our group got &quot;Theft of Thought&quot; last night.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t think he will ever have to med again - heh.  It&#39;s spell that<br/>
transfers mana to him from the target.  Until the next patch, any target -<br/>
post-patch, only caster mobs.<br/>

&gt; Out of curiosity, has anyone fought Trakanon?  I hadn&#39;t heard anything and<br/>
&gt; wondered if Trakanon had even been located yet.  I always like to hear<br/>
tales<br/>
&gt; of mobs it&#39;s highly unlikely I will ever see. </span></blockquote></div>
