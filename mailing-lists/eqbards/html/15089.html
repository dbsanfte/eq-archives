<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074141522">After attaining level 40 I decided to take my lock picks and head to<br/>
Befallen so I could max out my final skill on the doors there.  To what end<br/>
I do not know, I never failed picking the locks a single time and it seemed<br/>
to take forever opening and closing the door to max it, but what can I say,<br/>
I&#39;m a stat freak.  Yippie 100 skill in pick locks.<br/>
<br/>
In the process of spending about 5 hours in Befallen, I ran around and<br/>
killed rares that would pop up on tracking to take a break from the<br/>
monotonous door opening and closing routine.  I took some information I got<br/>
from people here on the list to help me finish the Thex Mallet quest as well<br/>
and this is how I did it if anyone is interested (I never would have been<br/>
able to figure out the Kizdean Gix part without a tricky tip I got here):<br/>
<br/>
1. Go to the third level of Befallen and kill that darn Elf Skeleton until<br/>
you get the mallet head and hilt from him.<br/>
2. Go out into W.Commons and track Kizdean Gix.  Be careful he&#39;s a mean<br/>
SOB,I had forgotten he was KOS to me so I ran right up to him and he started<br/>
casting on me and smacking me around so I thought, &quot;how the heck am I going<br/>
to get this creep to give me the note?&quot; and remembered a trick...<br/>
3. Charm Kizdean and while he is charmed give him the key phrase &quot;utalk<br/>
adarev otcin&quot;.  He will then give you the note and you can bugger off before<br/>
he breaks charm and remembers he hates your guts.<br/>
4. Go back into level 1 befallen and find skeleton Llrod, give him the<br/>
note...this causes Cmdr Windstream to spawn on the 3rd level by the secret<br/>
passage in the main hall.  I just jumped down the well next to Llrod and got<br/>
to Windstream in a few seconds.  He&#39;s a tough level 20ish melee zombie but I<br/>
killed him and took the mallet stem from him.<br/>
5. The stem is a 2 slot container, open it and put the head and hilt in it<br/>
and combine, viola! Thex Mallet (5dmg, 33dly, +5magic, can be worn in range<br/>
slot).<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
This quest actually originates in Neriak and the guy you talk to there is<br/>
the one who gives you the secret phrase &quot;utalk adarev otcin&quot; to say to<br/>
Kizdean Gix.  Technically you are skipping a part of the story here, but<br/>
there is no way for a bard to go into Neriak and get this info.<br/>
<br/>
If you take the secret phrase and turn it backwards, you get &quot;nicto verada<br/>
klatu&quot; which some of you may recognize from Evil Deal part 3, Army of<br/>
Darkness.  Ash has to say this phrase before he picks up the necronomicon in<br/>
the graveyard.  It gave me a chuckle.<br/>
