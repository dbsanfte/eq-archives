<div id="ygrps-yiv-581042746">The formula (according to the Hack sites, which makes it dubious in my book)<br/>
is<br/>
<br/>
Your xp gained from a monster killed = monster&#39;s total xp value * (your<br/>
total xp/groups total xp)<br/>
<br/>
1.  I have never seen any seemingly believable forumla for the monster&#39;s xp<br/>
value, I believe its a combination of many factors including a zone<br/>
multiplier and a small linear increase based on how many people are in the<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
2.  This formula would mean that race classes with high xp values are not so<br/>
much punished as are the people who they group with.  If this is the case<br/>
(which most people believe it is, and I all I have ever seen Verant say is,<br/>
&quot;Our xp system is not going to change.&quot;) then its one of the worst examples<br/>
of programming I have ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
For perspective on it, a lvl 50 human warrior has about the same xp as a 42<br/>
troll shadowknight.  Your killer group (lets say enchanter, cleric, shaman,<br/>
bard, rogue) needs a heavy tank.  Which is going to bring more to your<br/>
group?  Since both are going to take the same share of xp, of course you<br/>
should take the 50 warrior.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think classes are pretty well balanced in the game.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t understand why they take differenet amounts of xp.  As for races, I<br/>
would have rather seen the races better balanced, eliminating the need for<br/>
xp differences.<br/>
<br/>
3.  If you are too far below the higest level person in the group (I believe<br/>
if you con green to them) you will get no xp.  Verant has stated if you get<br/>
xp, you get a full share.  Assumign this is true, then youe only penalty you<br/>
are paying is the total xp ratio difference...</div>
