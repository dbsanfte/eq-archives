<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832087948">It doesn&#39;t matter, it would be like so one remaking the white album, (or<br/>
redoing Psycho, say...)<br/>
<br/>
I found the animated movie to be nearly perfect (I really love it that<br/>
much).  Computer generated monsters will never be as scary as the Ring<br/>
Wraiths were.  What are the chances whoever is playing Gandalf (anyone have<br/>
a cast list yet) is as much of a bastard as he was in the animated version?<br/>
And somehow I can&#39;t see being Mini Me (I forgot his real name) being as<br/>
appealing as Pippen was...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see and again I hope I&#39;m wrong :-)</div>
