<div id="ygrps-yiv-544829971">Actually the very top deck on hte boat is only reachable by bards and I<br/>
believed sowed people though I have not seen any one try.  If you attempt<br/>
to get up while under the influence of Selo&#39;s look up and move forward and<br/>
you move upward very slowly.  If you jump while moving forward it should<br/>
take about 3 or 4 jumps ot make itto the top.  It is a great place to<br/>
practice you brass instruments skills while travelling throught the ocean<br/>
of tears =).<br/>
