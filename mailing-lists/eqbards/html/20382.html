<div id="ygrps-yiv-196695846">Interesting thoughts, and I can usually be found in the thick of the<br/>
action waving away with my weapons, hitting every few seconds and<br/>
tickling the bad thing to distract it at least.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I&#39;ve been twisting a combination of Beserkers (haste etc),<br/>
Psalm of warmth/cooling (dmg shield), sometimes mana, sometimes chant<br/>
of flame (frost seems to be easily resisted I&#39;ve found), and sometimes<br/>
toss in either a guardian rhythms (magic resist and AC) or a mystic<br/>
shield (MR, depending on what we&#39;re fighting).<br/>
<br/>
All of the above add to the damage I am contributing, if you like.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;d be interested to hear at what point do you consider swapping<br/>
those weapons back into your belt, and bringing out the instruments.<br/>
The above combo really only takes 2 instruments.  I tried recently<br/>
adding in Niv&#39;s with an instrument, but that takes it to 3 and can<br/>
quickly wear me down.  And I&#39;m still experimenting with Nivs since<br/>
I&#39;ve just got it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
With an enchanter in the group, I wasn&#39;t convinced that my beserkers<br/>
haste effect and the chant boosted through instrument were enough to<br/>
make me give up the weapons, but it was a close call and probably<br/>
depends on other group members.  <br/>
<br/>
When enemy casters came to call, I got out the drum and with guardian<br/>
and mystic took MR up by over 100 points, that one was easy, and they<br/>
could barely touch us.  Mostly stunned anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just curious.<br/>

&gt;damage, i know how our songs work after 56 levels (riposte is at 57 by the<br/>
&gt;way).  however, i do melee pretty much 100% of the time, and i completely<br/>
&gt;disagree with the exaggeration of how close we are in melee ability to<br/>
&gt;casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;barely a notch above shaman and druids&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;not far beyond those of some of the &quot;pure&quot; casters&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;pathetic&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;horrendously behind the power curve&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;pretty much the same [as casters]&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ok we&#39;re going too far here.  no bards are not tanks, we don&#39;t have near the<br/>
&gt;defensive or offensive capabilities of the melee classes or hybrids, but we<br/>
&gt;are not nearly as close to the priests (you keep saying pure casters, i<br/>
&gt;assume you mean priests only, if you think we are close to the pure casters<br/>
&gt;in melee ability i would be speechless).  sure i would say we are somewhere<br/>
&gt;in between.  if you want to do damage as a bard at high levels, as opposed<br/>
&gt;to group buffing, you are going to be using weapons.  you are not going to<br/>
&gt;be using our AoE damage songs in dungeons.  z-axis fixed or not (i say it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;still not), you do not want multiple mobs on you, let alone if you have an<br/>
&gt;enchanter in your group.  the 3 chants are nice until they are resisted too<br/>
&gt;much, as well as the fact that you are not doing anything else for the group<br/>
&gt;when you are weaving these 3 songs (i&#39;d say most of us can not weave more<br/>
&gt;than 3 songs).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i am not singing damage songs, i am helping my group.  i am giving them<br/>
&gt;haste, mana, charming, resists, etc. in every fight.  do songs outdamage our<br/>
&gt;weapons?  yes.  can you use them to be the most effective bard?  no.  what<br/>
&gt;are you left with if you feel the need to do damage?  your weapons.  sure i<br/>
&gt;have some good stuff (RBB+VoV with a breath of harmony and symphonic saber)<br/>
&gt;but even on average you are telling me i am barely out-meleeing a priest<br/>
&gt;against a mob?  or for that matter, that if i stand up to a priest with no<br/>
&gt;songs for me and no spells for them, i can&#39;t out-melee him?  put a bad ass<br/>
&gt;2h weapon into a priest&#39;s hands, and hear them miss after miss.  put 2 fast<br/>
&gt;high-ratio weapons into a bard&#39;s hands and i think you see more than a<br/>
&gt;slight difference.  no i did not say we are tanks, not even remotely close.<br/>
&gt;i am saying we are better at melee than you think, or at least a bit better<br/>
&gt;than you think we are compared to priests.<br/>
