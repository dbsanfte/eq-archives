<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803294082">As for a pet assist hot key, here is my new one:<br/>
<br/>
/assist &lt;primary assist name&gt;<br/>
/pet back off<br/>
/pause 15<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
<br/>
You could easily add a &quot;/g &quot; message if you want there, but everyone I have<br/>
played with notices the pet&#39;s response to the /pet back off command.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if I could reduce the pause 15, but you definitly need a pause in<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to me that when I started charming higher level mobs, espeically<br/>
in Karnors, more often than not I needed to back them off party members.<br/>
Thus I added the /pet back off to my &quot;pet attack&quot; hotkey.</div>
