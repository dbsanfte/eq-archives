<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056852359">I wonder if the coding they have that prevents spells from working on higher<br/>
level mobs was somehow used here.  Just a thought, but it would be nice of<br/>
them if a weaker dragon simply dodged everything a 53+ player<br/>
swung/cast/throw at them.  Kinda takes away from role-playing if you can<br/>
kill a tougher dragon, but get death touched by a weaker one.<br/>
<br/>
But there I go again using the R-P word.  I might get banned for this if I<br/>
keep it up.  ;^)<br/>

&gt; Hmm, I wonder exactly what this means?  Will they banish the higher <br/>
&gt; levels?  Port them away?  Maybe kind of like a DT?  I don&#39;t think I <br/>
&gt; quite understand this, well, we&#39;ll see what happens when someone <br/>
&gt; tries it... heh.<br/>
