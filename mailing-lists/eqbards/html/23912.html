<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064782879">I honestly don&#39;t know what I advocate, but here&#39;s what I think...<br/>
____________<br/>
Scenario A<br/>
____________<br/>
High level bards should be forced to choose between melee or songs more<br/>
often. Then Verant could scale our melee properly without having to worry<br/>
about our song effects and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
____________<br/>
Scenario B<br/>
____________<br/>
Make bard haste stack like all of our other songs do. Scale the haste back<br/>
to be appropriate. 5% is way too low for stacking haste, particularly if we<br/>
lose our ability to melee at the same time. I&#39;m easily doing more damage<br/>
swinging than increasing the other tanks.<br/>
<br/>
____________<br/>
Scenario C<br/>
____________<br/>
Fix the resist soft caps.<br/>

&gt;because of the way the mobs increase in power post 50. Bards however<br/>
&gt;progress in power linearly. An argument can be made that we give some power<br/>
&gt;for our wealth of abilities, but if you look at the very highest levels, we<br/>
&gt;lose all of those additional abilities. Fear caps at 51, Charm caps at 53<br/>
&gt;and Mez caps at 55. That means that a level 60 bard fighting level 55+ mobs<br/>
&gt;is a liability to the party instead of an asset. We can no longer crowd<br/>
&gt;control, our haste and slow is vastly inferior to enchanters and shamen,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the problem that people don&#39;t realize is that the bard pretty much increases<br/>
the<br/>
effectivity of other people in his/her party.  if our increases also went<br/>
exponentially<br/>
and they affected the other class&#39;s exponential curves exponentially, you<br/>
don&#39;t see<br/>
this as being a problem?<br/>

&gt;bards have little to no use in a raid. We can&#39;t provide our primary ability<br/>
&gt;(resists) and we don&#39;t do damage, so why bring us along?<br/>

any other<br/>
change would severely overbalance us in all other aspects of the game.<br/>
