I&#39;ll read all of that later, thanks for all the info.<br/>
<br/>
Was not aware of the boost in damage when you get older. I was told in no<br/>
uncertain terms by several people on this board that I will NEVER improve<br/>
the damage I do beyond the (DMG*2)+1 stat. I am glad to hear that I am<br/>
wrong.<br/>

&gt;At around the late teens, you&#39;ll start getting an additional damage bonus,<br/>
&gt;depending on your strength and weapons skills and offense. I started seeing<br/>
&gt;mine about 18th, with Anthem and Warsong going.  It goes up slowly but<br/>
&gt;surely<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With a 5 damage well balanced scimitar, at 29th level, I&#39;m hitting for 16.<br/>
&gt;With a 6 damage WB rapier, I&#39;m hitting for 19, and with a 7 damage barbed<br/>
&gt;leather whip or 7 damage Jambiya,  I&#39;m hitting for 22.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, that&#39;s SERRATED bone dirk btw,  it&#39;s an 8 damage weapon, (but casts<br/>
&gt;Engulfing Darkness) and it&#39;s rogue only.  And more importantly, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;PIERCING.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The guy that runs EQ&#39;lizer probably hasn&#39;t seen any of those toys in real<br/>
&gt;life, and half his information is incorrect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another little tidbit, this right from Ryan Palachio (Head tuning GM).<br/>
&gt;Since the start of retail, STR affects not only how much you can carry and<br/>
&gt;how hard you hit, but also how WELL you hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DEX is still a factor in accuracy, but now STR is worked on both sides of<br/>
&gt;the combat equation, To-Hit and Damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as your DPS formula goes, I think you&#39;d be better served simply<br/>
&gt;dividing the base damage by the delay, it&#39;s a better real world indicator.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ah, hell, tired of typing, here&#39;s a cut and paste from a post I made on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>

&gt;In Response To: I&#39;ve got to disagree (Kiro)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I just can&#39;t agree with you here Kendrick. I&#39;ve heard you talk about<br/>
 </span></blockquote>speed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; being a principle factor in your weapon selection before - but you cannot<br/>
&gt;&gt; ignore a higher damager &quot;per click&quot; capacity of the mino axe.<br/>
&gt;&gt; This will be obvious to most everyone, but evaluate the weapon based on<br/>
&gt;&gt; the amount of time (speed factor time) that is takes the weapon to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>inflict<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; 1 point of damage. For the longsword this is 4.8333 clicks - for the mino<br/>
&gt;&gt; axe it is 4.625 clicks and for the combine longsword (as a reference) it<br/>
&gt;&gt; is 4.667.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now - from those numbers, you can see that a mino axe will outdistance<br/>
&gt;&gt; both the longsword and the combine longsword in damage. I recognize the<br/>
&gt;&gt; speed advantage in giving better averaged damage in any one combat - but<br/>
&gt;&gt; if you give the mino axe enough time, it will come out ahead. Instead of<br/>
&gt;&gt; basing your weapon decision on ONE combat, base it on a lifetime. The<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; level lifetime with that weapon (then you need the combine for it&#39;s magic<br/>
&gt;&gt; capabilities).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is one big factor that skews the straight time vs damage calculations:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Higher attack speed means more chances of processing dual attack and or<br/>
&gt;wield.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once those two skills come into play, faster weapons take a large leap<br/>
&gt;forward in overall efficiency. I&#39;d much rather have the system check every<br/>
 </span></blockquote>3<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;seconds if I get an additional attack(s) than I would every 5 seconds.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;are arbitrary time factors, but you get the point. A longsword checks every<br/>
&gt;29 units, to see if you swing twice, or use your secondary...a mino axe<br/>
&gt;checks every 38 units. Probability is in favor of the faster weapon here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Before that time, lower offense/weapons skills mean you miss more. So,<br/>
&gt;swinging more IS a good thing, be it one combat, or one hundred combats.<br/>
&gt;Hitting a target has a large random component, stacking the odds more in<br/>
&gt;your favor never hurts. Not to mention faster swings means faster skill<br/>
&gt;increases, something not to be overlooked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you jump the gap, and go to 2h weapons, well, they ARE more efficient.<br/>
&gt;They have to be, to make up for the loss of either a shield or a secondary<br/>
&gt;weapon, and are purpose designed to be the most devastating weapons in the<br/>
&gt;game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;ll note also, that the &#39;good&#39; weapons break a couple of rules, they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;higher base damage, and higher speed, with the level 40-50 stuff having<br/>
&gt;damage numbers half that of their attack speed, more or less. You&#39;ll not be<br/>
&gt;likely to see any weapons with more than .50 efficiency in players hands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, to find the efficiency rating (as I call it) of a given weapon, divide<br/>
&gt;its base damage by it&#39;s attack speed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3/20 Dagger .150<br/>
&gt;4/23 Short Sword .170<br/>
&gt;5/25 Rapier/Scimitar .200<br/>
&gt;7/35 Battle Axe .200<br/>
&gt;6/29 Longsword/Spear .206<br/>
&gt;8/39 Bastard sword .205<br/>
&gt;8/38 Mino axe .210,<br/>
&gt;6/28 Combine longsword .214,<br/>
&gt;5/23 Combine rapier .217,<br/>
&gt;6/27 Combine spear .222<br/>
&gt;7/28 Barbed leather whip .250,<br/>
&gt;6/25 Stiletto of Bloodclaw .24,<br/>
&gt;8/35 Screaming Mace .228<br/>
&gt;12/43 Combine 2h .270<br/>
&gt;14/50 Halberd .280<br/>
&gt;14/43 Dwarven Greataxe/Bloodstained Sword .325<br/>
&gt;16/35 Gigantic Zwiehander .457<br/>
&gt;11/22 Fanged Skull Stiletto .50<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s just a listing of a weapon&#39;s optimum efficiency level. You&#39;ll note<br/>
&gt;though, that a bastard sword is a hair worse than a longsword, a mino axe a<br/>
&gt;hair better, and neither do as well as a combine longsword.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another calculation you can do, which gives you a better &#39;real world&#39;<br/>
&gt;indication of how good a weapon is, is to determine a baseline weapon, I<br/>
&gt;pick steel longswords, and compare damage over any given period of time. To<br/>
&gt;do this, you take the attack speed, multiply it by the number of attacks<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;want, and then multiply that number by the base damage. Lets do 100 swings<br/>
&gt;of a long sword. That takes 2900 (29 speed) time units, and yeilds 600<br/>
&gt;(100*6) damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, take a mino axe, divide its speed, 38, by 2900. That gives you 76.3,<br/>
&gt;the amount of swings it will do in the same time period. Multiply that by<br/>
 </span></blockquote>8,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the base damage. In the time it takes a longsword to swing 100 times for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>600<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;damage, a mino axe swings 76, for 610. Ten points. Ten points in return for<br/>
&gt;23.7% less chances to hit. To figure longer spans, just add some zeros. The<br/>
&gt;gap widens a bit, 10x that time=100 more damage for the mino axe, but 240<br/>
&gt;more swings with the longsword, and so on. With bonus damage for higher<br/>
&gt;skills, the ratio is still the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A regular bastard sword fares even worse, doing 74 swings, and 594 damage.<br/>
&gt;A combine longsword will do 103 swings, and 621 damage.<br/>
&gt;A combine rapier will do 126 attacks, for 630 damage.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;A combine spear will do 107 attacks, and 644 damage.<br/>
&gt;A screaming mace will do 82 swings, and 662 damage.<br/>
&gt;A bloodclaw stiletto will do 116 attacks, for 696 damage.<br/>
&gt;A barbed whip will do 103 swings, and 724 damage.<br/>
&gt;A halberd will do 58 swings, and 812 damage.<br/>
&gt;A 2h combine, 67 swings, 809 damage.<br/>
&gt;A dwarven 2h greataxe or bloodstained sword will do 67 attacks, and 944<br/>
&gt;damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All of the above weapons are in the game, and in testers hands. [Note: All<br/>
&gt;numbers were rounded down] Also, the above numbers do not take into account<br/>
&gt;the advantages of dual attack/wield.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To put this all in context, with off-the-shelf weapons, I&#39;d have no<br/>
&gt;hesitation standing a pair of 30th level players, one dual combine<br/>
 </span></blockquote>longsword<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;close fight, and my money would be on the longsword user, all else being<br/>
&gt;equal. Were it a sword and shield vs a 2h, well, the 2h user would win.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The rough calculation of dual attack going off is (Skill+Level)/500, the<br/>
&gt;result being a percentage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For dual wield, it&#39;s (Skill+Level)/600<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At 30th level, you&#39;ve got a 30% chance of getting your secondary attack in.<br/>

&gt;This is not factoring in the increased chance over time of your primary<br/>
&gt;going off twice with a faster weapon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this clarifies my reasoning, and doesn&#39;t bore you to tears reading it.<br/>
&gt;And it&#39;s just this sort of thing I&#39;m really going to miss, if all the<br/>
&gt;numbers get hidden in retail. Counterpoint being, a lot of folks DON&#39;T want<br/>
&gt;to know these sort of things.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Sure,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The formula is simple. First of all, a weapon has a maximum amount of<br/>
&gt;&gt;damage it can do in a single hit. This amount is (DMG * 2) + 1. Why? It<br/>
&gt;&gt;just does . . . observe your weapon&#39;s behavior. Your Mino Axe should do no<br/>
&gt;&gt;more than 17 damage (8 * 2) +1.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Obviously, you won&#39;t always do the maximum amount of damage.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Your STR helps determine how close to the max you hit. The higher your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>STR,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;the more chance you&#39;ll have of hitting for the max. Your skill in the<br/>
&gt;&gt;weapon and in offense probably affects this as well.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, your opponent&#39;s armor will affact how much damage you hit for,<br/>
&gt;&gt;because their armor will absorb some of your damage. You will notice you<br/>

&gt;&gt;So my formula takes the max amount of damage (DMG * 2) + 1 . . . and<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The obvious ones are the combine longsword and scimtar, and their<br/>
