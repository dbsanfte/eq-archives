<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322382992">Name:     Song of Solidarity<br/>
Function: Whenever a member of the party takes damage, that damage it<br/>
distributed among the party members.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a 5 person party:<br/>
<br/>
The warrior gets hit for 75 (make this simple *Smiles*) points of<br/>
damage. The warrior actually gets hit for 15 points, and all other<br/>
party members get hit for 15 points of non-melee damage.<br/>
<br/>
Very hard to code (probably a lot of logic changes,) but something<br/>
different which would augment the Bard&#39;s ability to lessen party<br/>
downtime. (Maybe.)<br/>
