Have encountered this before, just difficult for -anyone- to stand and watch<br/>
a fight without joining in, I think.  The mage probably just can&#39;t stand it,<br/>
imagine him twiddling his thumbs, doing absolutely nothing unless an<br/>
emergency arises.  He probably tried, tried to conserve, then gave in and<br/>
just started launching spells--actually taking some kind of action!<br/>
<br/>
Possible solution: give him something to do, an alternative to spellcasting.<br/>
If it weren&#39;t the desert, I&#39;d say buy him a fishing pole, heheh.  But<br/>
seriously, maybe go and buy 80 throwing daggers and present them as a gift<br/>
to him (maybe just give him 20 at first and see how he takes to the idea).<br/>
O, he won&#39;t be doing much damage that way, but at least he&#39;ll have a key to<br/>
press in the heart of battle.  (The temptation to press a key, any key, is<br/>
quite extreme in battle!)<br/>
