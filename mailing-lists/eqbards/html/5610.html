&gt; I would imagine like most of our songs, the effectiveness of the song is<br/>
&gt; relative to your level compared against that of the mobs.  I&#39;m only 22d<br/>
&gt; level so haven&#39;t had the chance to play with Chain yet.  <br/>

&gt; I am currently fighting primarily in Unrest and Mistmoore.  In Unrest, the<br/>
&gt; Lullably and Largos&#39; Binding song are pretty reliable, especially if I equip<br/>
&gt; an instrument.  I don&#39;t get many resists when I play those two songs.  In<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore, the creatures there seem to resist those two songs more<br/>
&gt; frequently, especially Largo&#39;s.  I assume that is because the creatures in<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore are higher level than those in Unrest.  <br/>

in Mistmoore are a real pain because of their high resist.  I<br/>
even have problems Chaining greens there from time to time.<br/>
Lizards also seem slightly more resistant, animals slightly<br/>
less than humanoids.<br/>
