&gt; and a mage totally lagged last night.  I know in truth that Selo&#39;s is a<br/>
&gt; wonderful tool, but I have also learned that SOW can be a good send for<br/>
&gt; the rest of your party.  When running you will have to keep close tabs on<br/>
&gt; all of the party members because it is eay to lose them.  So it is a toss<br/>
&gt; and will depend on the situation.  BTW you are correct about the<br/>
&gt; unrooting, but it will become a moot point once you start camping a room<br/>

Retreats are rarely organized and people tend to break off at<br/>
different times.  If everyone is SoW&#39;ed, I don&#39;t have to wait<br/>
around for everyone else to leave first, so I am at less risk.<br/>
I&#39;m finding this to be more important now that I can&#39;t tank as<br/>
well as the other true tanks.<br/>
<br/>
I will still keep Accelerando memorized and the drum ready<br/>
though.  The obvious use is for unrooting people.  But another<br/>
use is that SoW walking is barely faster than monsters.<br/>
Accelerando with a drum while walking is significantly faster.<br/>
So if any of your party is down to a bubble or less and is<br/>
walking, you can use Accelerando with a drum to give him<br/>
enough speed to escape without getting hit from behind 3-4<br/>
times.<br/>
