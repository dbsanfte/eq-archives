Ok, I have a question for you all.  I am a level 25 Bard on the Rallos Zek<br/>
server.  I have read with interest your emails, suggestions, and tips, but I<br/>
seem to have a problem.  I can not use the same songs in the same way as<br/>
you.  My sleep song puts EVERYONE but my party to sleep, including other<br/>
players, in fact any NON Party song effects mobs and players.  This is a<br/>
real disadvantage to me I believe.  Anyone on RZ with any suggestions? Or<br/>
anyone else ?  Thanks<br/>
