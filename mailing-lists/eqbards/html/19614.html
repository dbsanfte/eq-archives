<div id="ygrps-yiv-597884590">This has been the case for a LONG time.  Since release actually.  I <br/>
think it might have to do with video drivers.  Might be correlated <br/>
with using Glide?  I haven&#39;t gotten flashing icons for spells/songs <br/>
wearing off since phase 2 beta.  And yes, it&#39;s extremely annoying in <br/>
kedge.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve /bugged it at least 5 times since release.  Feel free to start a <br/>
thread about it that Abashi can ignore.  :)<br/>
