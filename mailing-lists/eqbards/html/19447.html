<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347800385">1) You really can&#39;t require much of guides at all. They are volunteers.<br/>
Doing events is not part of the volunteering contract.<br/>
<br/>
2) it is not that easy to move a guide from one server to another. I&#39;ve<br/>
got a friend who is a cross-server GUide. She took a while to get set up<br/>
on them. Its a special case when a Guide is a &quot;SWAT&quot; Guide and can do<br/>
such things on more than one server.<br/>
<br/>
Events are already staggered between servers. Each server decides for<br/>
itself when its going to hold an event, and makes the planning, etc.<br/>

&gt;But if Verant is planning a special event then it should be fairly easy for<br/>
&gt;them to require all/most of that server&#39;s GMs/guides to be online at the<br/>
&gt;time of the event .  Plus if they are short GM/guides then they can stagger<br/>
&gt;the events between servers and have GM/guides from one server temporarily<br/>
&gt;move over to another one to help out with the event until its over. </span></blockquote></div>
