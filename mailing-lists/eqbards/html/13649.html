&gt; Hell  you forgot some dungeons like Sol A which is baren.<br/>
&gt; Or mm same thing. Fact of the matter is your argument is <br/>
&gt; off somewhat because there are zones at your level exmpty <br/>
&gt; while at mine their aren&#39;t any that are even low.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, I didn&#39;t forget Sol A but it&#39;s mostly all camped (King, Bartender,<br/>
Predator, Foreman, Clockworks, Singe, Kindle and the zone entrance). <br/>
<br/>
Unrest basement always has one if not 3 groups in it during prime time<br/>
with the knight camped, the hand room camped, the barkeep camped and<br/>
even the rooms on the first and second floor with single spawns in them<br/>
are camped.<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost will have one group working the elite spawns and pulling the<br/>
diplomat. I always see at least 1 group in the preacher area; sometimes<br/>
2 as the second group will camp the archaeologist. Lvl 50 druids take up<br/>
a permanent residence in the King spawn area and the Alchemist is<br/>
getting to be camped 24/7 as well.<br/>
<br/>
MM is starting to become packed as well with 3 groups working the<br/>
ent/lake area, 2 in the GY, 1 in secret room, 2 working the gargs in the<br/>
torture chamber area, 1 working ancil valley, 1 working the castle<br/>
foyer, and a group way in back doing the maid/butler spawns. I&#39;d call<br/>
that pretty damn camped for the 20-40 spawns.<br/>
<br/>
In CT, the TR, achron (2 or 3 groups in the temple), and green pool is<br/>
defiantly camped. The planks area is getting crowded lately too. During<br/>
prime time, a second group will clean the foyer portion of TR while<br/>
being on the waiting list. Always at least 2 or more groups pulling maze<br/>
into the courtyard. The only spawn that I&#39;m not sure is being worked<br/>
aggressively on my server if the Avatar himself.<br/>
<br/>
Upper Guk seems to be less packed but then, the lord and the croc areas<br/>
are camped 24/7 with the scyer having a waiting list.  The warden, the<br/>
squire... even the darn spiders are all camped during prime time.  You<br/>
betcha<br/>
<br/>
Sure I&#39;ve left out some zones but I think I&#39;ve made my point.  It&#39;s not<br/>
just crowding at the +45 level; it&#39;s spread out all over now. I don&#39;t<br/>
think any one particular lvl group can feel victimized here.  We are all<br/>
suffering.<br/>
