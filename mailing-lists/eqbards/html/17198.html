  Furthermore, using an all instrument attack (Hymn, DDD, CoD) you can plow<br/>
  through tentacle terrors. I soloed all of level 24 in one night (4-5<br/>
hours)<br/>
  just killing the TTs in najena. Najena is a great spot for many of the<br/>
same<br/>
  reasons as sol a. It is empty. (the night I soloed, I was the only person<br/>
in<br/>
  najena)<br/>
