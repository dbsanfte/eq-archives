<div id="ygrps-yiv-507184539">Preliminary results:<br/>
<br/>
I was in Highkeep warrior room in a party for first time (woo hoo!) -<br/>
between warriors who resisted 100% and only let me slash or pierce for max 5<br/>
or so dmg - I tried Largos on the guards that spawn (red to me but I could<br/>
make Largos stick) and am pretty sure that it was working better than chain.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For one - they resisted my chain but not my binds. Two, when under the<br/>
effect of song - they did not fight back as the party beat them down (at<br/>
least I did not see the &quot;hits so and so for xx dmg and the animation seemed<br/>
to stop and most of all the party dint show hp loss.)  I only did this for<br/>
about and hour or so - so it&#39;s a pretty weak sample.  Need to really do it<br/>
more and pay better attention (log file and one of the analyzers too.)<br/>
<br/>
As far as warrior room players go - we sucked pretty bad - cuz we were<br/>
chasin&#39; up stairs fairly often - dint have a good snare/rooter in the party<br/>
(two bards 24 27, a caster 30, a warrior 35 and 2 paladins 28 34.)  Our<br/>
levels ranged from me at 24 to 35 warrior & palladin.  XP was good at first<br/>
but when the 2nd hi level joined us - it got pretty slow for me at least.<br/>
There seem to be a lot of factors in the old xp equation - number and level<br/>
of ppl in party as well as the relative con of the mobs. <br/>

		&gt; Given, that it has been observed that songs gain power as<br/>
you level past<br/>

better than Chain<br/>
		&gt; on the stronger mobs u r fighting?  Better for slowing<br/>
their attack speed I<br/>
		&gt; mean.  Sometimes I have been using chain early on to get<br/>
the slower atck<br/>
		&gt; effect - but on them yeller and reds - I get loads of<br/>
resists - or sometimes<br/>
		&gt; no message at all? Plus - we all know that someone else<br/>
should be snaring it<br/>
		&gt; anywho. So think using the lower level song will be better<br/>
chance of working<br/>
		&gt; on the mobs?<br/>
<br/>
		My experience has been if there are two similar songs, one<br/>
		area effect and one targeted, the area effect one is<br/>
resisted<br/>
		or broken out of more frequently.  This is true of CoD/DDD<br/>
vs<br/>
		Bellow/Curtailing, and Lullaby vs. Strike.  I haven&#39;t used<br/>
		Binding in a long time so feel free to test it for yourself.<br/>
		Maybe you&#39;re onto something.  :-)<br/>
