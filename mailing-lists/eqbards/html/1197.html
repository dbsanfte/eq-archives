I haven&#39;t personally done this quest, but someone told me about it, and I<br/>
pass it on to you in hopes you can figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
*Speculative Spoiler*<br/>
<br/>
Supposedly, in South Karana there is a NPC named Rathmana (sp?). Bring him a<br/>
popular magical staff, and the head of an evening-spawning undead creature,<br/>
and you&#39;ll supposedly get something that combines the two in return. Both<br/>
items can be retrieved at the shore of nearby waters...<br/>
<br/>
Now, I left out the details so you can still do some exploring on your own.<br/>
You might want to be cautious with the details of the quest as it would be<br/>
an &quot;OUCH&quot; of a mistake to give him the wrong things.<br/>

From the EQLizer:<br/>
<br/>
The staff of writhing is one of the various skull staff&#39;s in the game(which<br/>
look similar to the staff that the Priest of Discord is equipping). This<br/>
particular staff is a 1 handed blunt weapon and can be equipped by<br/>
Necromancers, Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians and Bards. It has a damage of<br/>
9, a delay of 33 and has the effect of chaotic feedback(which does 48<br/>
points of damage when successful).<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been impressed with most weapons I have seen so far, but this<br/>
sounds like a real treat. Any idea where to find one?<br/>
<br/>
I would be willing to train my 1H Blunt to use this, since it has a very<br/>
nice magical effect.<br/>
<br/>
Working on using EQLizer for some complete weapon analysis, will post soon.<br/>
