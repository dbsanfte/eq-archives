&gt; other idea..and one dear to my heart! GET US WOMEN WEDDING DRESSES..with<br/>

&gt; dress instead of plate would be SO nice..sigh.....<br/>

G-string the Helven bardess of the 3rd Chorus wear).<br/>

Weddings are a fairly important social event in Norrath, so why can&#39;t Verant put<br/>
in a few items for no purpose other then celebrations: Wedding Dresses, Wedding<br/>
cake, Champaign, & Flowers (courting RP&#39;s would love this).</div>
