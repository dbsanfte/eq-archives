 </span></blockquote>I just used the position of the sun to figure out East and<br/>
West, and assumed the boat took a mostly straight East-West<br/>
route and figured I&#39;d hit one of the islands if I swam due<br/>
West.  Little did I realize East and West are reversed in the<br/>
Ocean of Tears.  I did hit an island, but it wasn&#39;t the one I<br/>
expected.  Turns out I swam all the way across from the BB<br/>
zone back to the island of the Sisterhood of Erollisi.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would not have as much problem with it if the compass were<br/>
more accurate than just giving the same directions as sense<br/>
heading.  It&#39;s very easy to think you&#39;re going due West when<br/>
you&#39;re off by 10 degrees and completely miss where you&#39;re<br/>
trying to go.  I suppose I could start dropping copper coins<br/>
as I go like Hansel and Gretel.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem I&#39;ve had was figuring out orientation<br/>
underwater.  I&#39;ve actually gotten lost in the lake in Oasis,<br/>
where it&#39;s murky enough that you often can&#39;t see if you&#39;re<br/>
swimming into a wall (i.e. not moving).  Eventually I figured<br/>
out that I could center my view and just rotate to get a<br/>
proper heading (so as not to swim *towards* the spectres), and<br/>
swim slightly up to get to the surface.  In real life, you can<br/>
at least feel when you&#39;re up against something, so I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have a problem using /loc if I ended up lost underwater again.<br/>
<br/>
The other times I use /loc is when the group gets separated<br/>
while running.  That would almost never happen in real life,<br/>
and the problem is exaggerated by packet loss and chasing<br/>
ghosts.  The follow command helps, but is not perfect.<br/>
