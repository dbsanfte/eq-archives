<div id="ygrps-yiv-914973964">Now you guys are on the right track!  <br/>
<br/>
I have camped the bedroom which is about half way to the place where you<br/>
need to go from the zone.  What is gonna be a big problem for you is the<br/>
inevitable trains.  It was a big problem for me and I was 30ish.  Be real<br/>
carefull about songs and drawing unwanted attention to your selves.<br/>
<br/>
Practice zoning (from lguk to uguk) or get a druid to go with u to do evacs<br/>
and cast invis to undead (if druids can cast that).  Even so some of these<br/>
mobs will see thru invis-to-undead.  So you will have to go there and see<br/>
whats happening and slip in behind a good group who is clearing the path.  <br/>
<br/>
But take this to heart - practice swimming & running to the zone as well as<br/>
have a druid or wiz friend along who can gate you out. Don&#39;t bother bringing<br/>
any stuff on you like expensive weps or armor - you wont defeat anything<br/>
that attacks you (if u are 26 and under).  If you die and cant find your<br/>
corpse, petition a GM and hang around.  The walls are really weird and<br/>
corpses can be real hard to find - I been a lost corpse in there and needed<br/>
GM to drag me out.  They understand it happens pretty much.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, I think there are 2 zones that are near to the bedroom (which is where<br/>
you will need to go thru to get in to where the assassin is.  One way in is<br/>
from upper guk into a hallway tunnel that goes down to a water canal - swim<br/>
to the right and thru an underwater passage then surface and you should be<br/>
at the bedroom.  Hallways from the bedroom lead to where the assassin is (or<br/>
where I am told he is - I have not ventured all the way there yet.)  So to<br/>
zone out you&#39;d need to swim out thru tunnel then up and hit the right<br/>
platform (there are more than one) and run up the hallway and make a left<br/>
and then up some more to hit the zone.  It&#39;s hard to do when a train has<br/>
been pulled.  Been there, died there, got the tee shirt.<br/>
<br/>
Now I looked at a map and see that there maybe another zone kinda nearby.<br/>
If you go to where the big crocks (I forget his name) in upper guk is camped<br/>
- there is an underwater zone passage nearby.  I think that puts you in the<br/>
same canal that leads to the bedroom.  So you may want to explore coming in<br/>
and out through that way instead of the traditional hallway tunnels. I know<br/>
that I am going to consider it for my next run to the zone because the<br/>
trains usually go towards the hallways after the pullers.  <br/>

<br/>
		Thats a good idea.  I&#39;m certain that with either my charm or<br/>
my cash,<br/>
		someone will let me loot the Guise.  My main concern though<br/>
is not getting<br/>
		killed while I&#39;m down there.  Any suggestions on how a 24<br/>
bard can pull this<br/>
		off?  <br/>
