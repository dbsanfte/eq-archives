<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359280375">Something else to remember:<br/>
<br/>
Once an NPC&#39;s health drops below 50% their resist rates seem to drop<br/>
dramatically.  I&#39;ve had mobs that resisted 100% all through the fight<br/>
suddenly resist 0% once their health dropped below the magic point (about<br/>
1/3 bubble).<br/>
<br/>
Generally during a fight I do the same thing as you.  Personally I prefer<br/>
Chains to snare anyday.  If the group insists on snare I just let the snarer<br/>
know not to snare for a few seconds after the npc arrives to make sure my<br/>
chain (from pulling) has worn off.<br/>

&gt; I used Chains over Snare unless I was getting outrageous Chains resists.<br/>
&gt; The main reason is that I was the puller, and couldn&#39;t waste 2 slots for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; attack speed slowdown component.  As the puller, Chains was mandatory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I was having difficulty Chaining (determined early in the fight), I<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; yell, and the druid/ranger would proceed to snare.  As the mob got close<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; running health, I just chain Chained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for mage pets, I don&#39;t usually stay in groups where the mage refuses to<br/>
&gt; become group-friendly and summon a non-earth pet.<br/>
