  So, what Shada (retired) doesn&#39;t say outright is that there is no point for<br/>
  anyone to enter the &quot;BoB&quot; besides Aftathott.  To completely refrain from<br/>
  entering would be the best comment on these equipment contests.<br/>
<br/>
  He who has the most time to play with the guild of most dedicated players,<br/>
  wins.  Simple.<br/>
