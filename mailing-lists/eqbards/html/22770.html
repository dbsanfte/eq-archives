<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-642715688">No, once again these songs aren&#39;t doing anything.  The state of these songs has included:<br/>
<br/>
Cure messages but no cure.<br/>
Cure messages and a cure, but the cure dropped the resist until the song pulsed again.<br/>
And now, no messages, no cure.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s actually been like this for a little while now.  I posted on the QA board, but no response.<br/>

&gt; of Purity and Psalm of Vitality.  I normally play these songs during<br/>
&gt; downtime to relieve the cleric of curing duties.  Up until last night, I<br/>
&gt; would get a message...&quot;You have been cured of your affliction&quot; or something<br/>
&gt; like that each time my song successfully pulsed against poison or disease,<br/>
&gt; and after a few successful pulses the poison or disease would drop on group<br/>
&gt; member Soandso.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well last night I never saw that message, and no group member ever was cured<br/>
&gt; by my song.  I am just wondering if you guys have noticed the same thing?<br/>
&gt; If any of you are in a position to quantitively test this over the weekend,<br/>
&gt; please do so so we can get a bug report submitted ASAP if it is in fact<br/>
&gt; broken.  The possibility is also that my group was unresponsive to me, and<br/>
&gt; it is simply the success message which is broken.<br/>
