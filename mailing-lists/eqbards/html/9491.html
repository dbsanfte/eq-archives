&gt;&gt; Where did you hear this? The Plane of Hate hasn&#39;t been opened<br/>
&gt;&gt; yet. The surge in undead around the land was for Halloween. You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;&gt; see things returning to normal now that it&#39;s over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Antonica will never be the same<br/>
&gt;again.  Qeynos Hills and our little quiet haven of Kithicor now run<br/>
&gt;rampant with undead after the sun sets.  The Carson McCabe of CazicThule<br/>
&gt;warned us that this was a permanent change, and that the link to the Plane<br/>
&gt;of Hate had been &quot;weakened&quot; due to this incident.  He did not tell us<br/>
&gt;where the gateway was, rumors include somewhere in Kithicor and deep<br/>
&gt;inside Neriak Third Gate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Arguably the most humorous part of last night&#39;s proceedings was when<br/>
&gt;Carson ran around killing guards and looting them, saying that they had<br/>
&gt;stolen money from the vault, so he could continue handing out his 20p<br/>
&gt;reward to each person present.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Did anyone get a bardic item from him?  There were a few classes he seemed<br/>
&gt;to overlook when handing out the non-monetary gifts.<br/>
