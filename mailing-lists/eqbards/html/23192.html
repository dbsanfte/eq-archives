<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From what Brad said, he&#39;s wrong.  Its (clearly I thought) stated in the part<br/>
about death that number of kills required for any class to make up for a<br/>
death will be equal.<br/>
<br/>
Bard loses 1400 xp from dying.<br/>
Cleric loses 1000.<br/>
<br/>
However for killing the same mob cleric gets 100 xp, and bard gets 140.<br/>
Both require 10 kills to regain the lost xp, thus (for all intents and<br/>
purposes) they lost the same amount.<br/>
<br/>
The reason they did this is because any other solution to the xp system<br/>
would be too ponderous (reworking the total xp for millions of characters)<br/>
or cause some classes to gain a bunch of levels upon implementation (which I<br/>
dont think any of us think is the right thing to do).<br/>
<br/>
The xp system seems pretty simple to me.  Every race has a multplier, every<br/>
class has a multiplier.  There is a base amount of xp needed for each level.<br/>
<br/>
To calculate a given characters xp needed you merely multiply the base x<br/>
racial modifier x class modifier.</div>
