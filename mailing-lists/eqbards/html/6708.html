&gt; Last night I PvP&#39;d a rogue friend of mine (he&#39;s 27 and I&#39;m 24), he had 2<br/>
&gt; proc&#39;ing weapons, and I got him down into his las two bubbles of health.<br/>
&gt; Not bad for being 3 levels under him and having no proc&#39;ing weapons of my<br/>
&gt; own.  I think we are balanced just fine :o)  (Although I still feel it goes<br/>
&gt; against all of the bard lore that Verant has fed us for bards to NOT be able<br/>
&gt; to bind themselves)<br/>

your balance by testing a PvP encounter? And against a rogue? If any<br/>
class has a right to bitch about being nerfed it&#39;s rogues. That said,<br/>
try this little experiment. Get a high level warrior to _just_ taunt a<br/>
mob so it&#39;s back is to you while you attack it. Do the same with a<br/>
rogue. Time how fast it takes either of you to kill it.<br/>
