not being 100% guaranteed to prevent being hit, while at the<br/>
same time 1 AC vs. 1000 Atk does not 100% guarantee a<br/>
successful hit.  If you went with straight subtraction, you&#39;d<br/>
have to apply a cutoff, beyond which extra AC or Atk just<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter.  The few pieces of EQ&#39;s underlying number<br/>
system strongly suggests Verant wouldn&#39;t go for such a simple<br/>
solution.<br/>
