<div id="ygrps-yiv-880643872">are you guys talking about 2 different songs?  sounds like maybe Anthem is<br/>
thinking of disenchating melody (22) and Sartori is thinking of anti-magic<br/>
aria (40)?  level 40 works, level 22 does not.  i know GZ found the bug, but<br/>
i don&#39;t know if there has been a patch since then.<br/>

&gt; &gt;When was this broken? I remember for quite awhile it was <br/>
&gt; broken, then after<br/>
&gt; &gt;some patch where they claimed it was fixed, I memmed it and <br/>
&gt; put good use to<br/>
&gt; &gt;it dueling a druid buddy of mine. He didn&#39;t know he was <br/>
&gt; wasting his mana<br/>
&gt; &gt;Dotting me. =P<br/>

&gt; work, saw GZ talk <br/>
&gt; about finding the bug, now I have another useful song!!<br/>
