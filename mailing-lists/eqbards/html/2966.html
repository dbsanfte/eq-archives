<b>Subject:</b> [spoiler] Shimmering Orb <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-992250819">from the entrance, just take the first right, swim through the water, past<br/>
the spiders, and down the stairs. you will end up in the scryer room. the<br/>
shimmering orb is a great shield for bards, i borrow one from my enchanter<br/>
friend when i&#39;m in a party with several tanks since i know i&#39;ll be taking<br/>
a large percentage of the hits because of bard hate.<br/>
<br/>
on fennin ro, they can sell for outrageous amounts of money. some people<br/>
only seem willing to buy them for 250pp, but i sold one last week for<br/>
600pp.. and i&#39;ve heard they used to go for 800 or 1000. yowza.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;*baal*&gt; it&#39;s not my fault<br/>
&lt;*baal*&gt; i&#39;m just made cute!</div>
