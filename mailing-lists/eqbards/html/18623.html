<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083316879">WOW and I thought that my best friend spent a lot of time roleplaying with<br/>
  44days played at 20th... hehe and she spends HOURS just frittering time<br/>
away<br/>
  talking to folks ;)  She loves the social aspect of the game.  I keep<br/>
trying<br/>
  to tell her this isn&#39;t MiRC but she loves to chat<br/>
  &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I have made some great friends at level 7 by just &quot;chatting&quot;  I spent two<br/>
hours chatting with someone in character last night and loved every minute<br/>
of it :)  As I said to a high level friend I have made when he asked me<br/>
about leveling: &quot;the mobs will always be there but the people won&#39;t&quot;  He was<br/>
also amazed to see something of the equipment my character had for level 7 -<br/>
all of it given to her.  And this is a level 40+ asking how she got it :)<br/>
<br/>
  I think playing a bard is just great.  I just run up to people and chat to<br/>
them and they do so in return.  I think bards can get away with it much<br/>
easier then others could ;)  If you are into the character you are playing<br/>
(not in the role play sense but just into the character) your bard will<br/>
spend more time talking and making friends and exploring then they ever<br/>
would making friends.<br/>
<br/>
  My two cents,<br/>
