<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236213942">thing is, 9 times out of 10, I can accomplish the evade effect by simply<br/>
taking 2 or 3 steps away from the mob. Range is a huge factor in the agro<br/>
calculations. The only time i have Song of Dawn memmed is when I&#39;m on a<br/>
planar raid and I want to get the female rev off of me.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I have yet to do the uber raids of SoV.<br/>

i used to feel this way, but Song of Dawn is now almost always memmed for<br/>
me.  the mobs in velious hit awful hard, and why take the damage when i can<br/>
evade onto a tank who can deal with it so much better.  especially the uber<br/>
mobs, which i do not last long against, it&#39;s part of my twist.  in exp<br/>
groups, if i got something on me i pulse it in and it almost always switches<br/>
back to the tank.<br/>
<br/>
lately i have been going ahead and taking the damage though, looking for<br/>
those new defense points (only got 2 so far, hopefully the next patch works<br/>
and doubles the chances).<br/>
