<b>Subject:</b> Dex/Agi/Where to go... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-10495457">Ok i hate asking questions like this, but i wasted so much time last night<br/>
to get 1 bubble of xp it drove me nuts. I finally hit level 37 after getting<br/>
trained constantly last night in sol b and before that being grouped with a<br/>
too high level group for me that got me sloooooooow xp.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions other then Cazic Thule sewers for where i can hunt at 37 in<br/>
a small group (2 to 5 people)<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s my other question, What do most of ya go for? i havent been<br/>
active on my bard for about 6 months, and his equipment has been revamped<br/>
since then since i had sold most of his stuff to equip my necro, but now the<br/>
necro equipped him.<br/>
<br/>
Im currently in some:<br/>
lambent armor<br/>
crested helm<br/>
Borrowed mith bp (psst Halana, we gotta hook up!)<br/>
2 yaks <br/>
<br/>
My equipment is not complete yet, but getting there<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s what im getting at, I know we&#39;re fragile tanks, my yaks are<br/>
finally procing, this will taunt mobs alot im assuming since im usually<br/>
singing my heart away to buff us up. I dont wanna be hit. <br/>
<br/>
My question to you....  <br/>
Any suggestions to what i could use to raise my agi to not be hit? and also<br/>
my dex to raise my dex up to proc those swords as much as possible<br/>
<br/>
my current stats are about 100 strenght, 122 agility, 118 or so dex, and<br/>
about 125 charisma<br/>
<br/>
what i&#39;d like to know is what the non imbrued high lev bards are using and<br/>
what they recommend<br/>
