 </span></blockquote>You think the adjustment Verant made to &quot;activatable items&quot; has somehow<br/>
affected the &quot;proc&quot;? I definitely noticed the delay when I activated my mask<br/>
of deception. Had to wait for a couple of seconds before the spell was cast.<br/>
I also noticed that when I moved the spell was &quot;interrupted&quot;, but then<br/>
continued.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I had a log of this, but I got lagged out and didn&#39;t reactivate it<br/>
when I came back in. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, is it unreasonable to set our default travelling pace to<br/>
&quot;Run&quot; so that we don&#39;t have to turn this on whenever we log in. Does anyone<br/>
&quot;walk&quot; in this game? (&quot;sneakers&quot; don&#39;t count) This is one of the ways I<br/>
&quot;spot a newbie&quot; is the fact that they&#39;re walking around in the newbie<br/>
killing zones, casually sauntering around trying to catch up to things to<br/>
kill.<br/>

&gt; Yes, I noticed it also.  I was fighting for abour 2 hours <br/>
&gt; last night and<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t get a single proc.  I was dual weilding tentical whips <br/>
&gt; the whole time.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not too concerned yet, but did anyone else playing last <br/>
&gt; night notice a<br/>
&gt; &gt;staggering drop in the number of procs that their weapons <br/>
&gt; are firing?  I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;fighting Ogre Bouncers inside Oggok last night with my <br/>
&gt; Ykesha and I believe<br/>
&gt; &gt;the number of times it fired over the course of about 4 <br/>
&gt; hours of play was<br/>
&gt; &gt;either 2 or 3 - that&#39;s a very serious drop, perhaps an order <br/>
&gt; of magnitude.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The last hour or so I loaded up all of my DEX equipment and <br/>
&gt; played Chant of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Battle and had a DEX of 186 and didn&#39;t proc once.  After <br/>
&gt; killing Bouncers I<br/>
&gt; &gt;ran over to Cazic-Thule and beat on some lizzies and gators <br/>
&gt; for testing<br/>
&gt; &gt;purposes (also 186 DEX) and got not a single proc while <br/>
&gt; there (around 20<br/>
&gt; &gt;solo kills).<br/>
