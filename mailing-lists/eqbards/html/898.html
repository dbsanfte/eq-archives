<div id="ygrps-yiv-314388996">I hadn&#39;t thought about it, but when using bellow, I tried kiting a yellow<br/>
beetle, and was never once resisted. In fact, I don&#39;t recall having been<br/>
resisted with bellow. I maxed out my charisma when I created a character. Is<br/>
resistance or &quot;fizzling&quot; a problem with some of you? I seldom miss a note.<br/>

&gt; Not true, shamans have some very nice Charisma buffs starting at level 14.<br/>

Has anyone had similar results with charisma buffs though?  I<br/>
plan on bugging my shaman and enchanter friends some time this<br/>
week to test it.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a silly decision to max<br/>
my charisma with bonus points so I could RP the charming bard.  <br/>
