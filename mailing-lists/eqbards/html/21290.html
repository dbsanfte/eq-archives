<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570447361">Been there.  Done that.  The resist rates do not conform to what GZ told<br/>
&#39;us&#39; they should be.  Whether they conform to what he told Abashi they<br/>
should be or not is unknown.  I&#39;m sick and tired of fighting trying to<br/>
convince Verant.  They are arrogant idiots beyond reasoning with.  I&#39;ve<br/>
finally decided to just win by not giving them any more money.  The sad<br/>
thing is, and many of my friends have said this as well; its not just EQ we<br/>
aren&#39;t going to play any more.  We have no interest in ever purchasing<br/>
another game from Verant.  That is what is really going to hurt them in the<br/>
end.<br/>
<br/>
After having a lengthy discussion with two of the folks from Artifact<br/>
Entertainment (Horizons) over the Labor Day weekend, I can see a night and<br/>
day difference in their approach as opposed to Verant.  Both David Allen,<br/>
the president and CEO, and Doug Shuler, the art director and visual<br/>
designer, were extremely personable and open to suggestions from those in<br/>
attendance.  Having known Doug personally for several years, I am confident<br/>
this was not a put on to garner interest.  Both were praiseful of much that<br/>
Verant has accomplished, but both were also equally horrified and confused<br/>
over the way Verant treats its customers.  It was that treatment, over and<br/>
above everything else that inspired them to go out and put together a team<br/>
to make a game that was willing to treat its players the way they wanted to<br/>
see them treated.  I hope they get it right.<br/>

<br/>
Well, there it is.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 options. Roll over and die or Fight it. As a bard, I&#39;ve had more<br/>
than my share of dying, so I say we fight it.<br/>
<br/>
So far several issues are unaddressed. <br/>
<br/>
They said it&#39;s &quot;working as intended&quot; but they haven&#39;t told us what intended<br/>
is. We need to press them to find out what the expected resist rates are so<br/>
we can do our own testing. All we know is that the song is supposed to be<br/>
more effective vs mobs below level 30. Let&#39;s hammer that datapoint until we<br/>
can prove to them that they are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing abashi said is that he did a test personally and found that<br/>
resist rates on mobs below 30 conform to GZ&#39;s statement on resist rates. I<br/>
think we need to increase the sample size and prove him wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I propose...<br/>
I&#39;d like everyone to spend 5 minutes in your local newbie area singing<br/>
Lullaby to snakes, bats, rats, decaying skeletons, or whatever level 1<br/>
critter you can find. Log the results and we&#39;ll start a thread to post them<br/>
on. If we all do this every night, we&#39;ll get a huge sample size that will<br/>
acurately show the resist rates. Make sure you post your bard&#39;s level as<br/>
well as the log file.<br/>
<br/>
If we keep the pressure on, perhaps they will realize their error.<br/>
