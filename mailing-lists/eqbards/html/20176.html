&gt; points of damage when i punch things.  i just don&#39;t see what swinging weapons<br/>
&gt; gains you in interest level.  let&#39;s say you could use weapons in this hypothetical<br/>
&gt; lullaby situation.  so you hit lullaby, hit assist, hit &#39;a&#39;, and now what?  you do<br/>
&gt; exactly the same as you would if you had a lute instead of weapons.  you sit<br/>
&gt; and watch the screen.  you could just as easily go get a sandwich then too.<br/>
&gt; heck, my sk buddy does that all the time.  we start up combat, he starts attacking<br/>
&gt; and then says afk, heh.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the point that Kitasi is trying to make which may not be getting<br/>
across is the important fact that bards have to Think (and exercisetheir<br/>
fingers=). Yes we can melee with weapons or fists, but that is not the<br/>
reason why I have enjoyed my bard. The only intrinsic quality that I still<br/>
enjoy in my bard is the fact that he is as good as I play him. Not many<br/>
classes enjoy that much control.  The idea that one would have to<br/>
sit down and determine what to weave to achieve the optimal amount of<br/>
improvement.  Songs of the type where you are able to go into dumb mode<br/>
just defeats the entire purpose of this whole weaving thing.  I have found<br/>
the greatest joy in watching the techniques of my bardic brothers and<br/>
sisters and not in the monotonous action of pressing &#39;a&#39; and getting a<br/>
sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
Then again that is entirely my opinion.<br/>
