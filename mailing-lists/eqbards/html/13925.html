&gt; Heh most classes can do that excluding melee classes. Shamans, magicians,<br/>
&gt; enchanters, clerics, and a bunch of others can clear all the spawns they<br/>
&gt; want to. Hell even a 50 bard can kill the mobs he wants to along with a<br/>
&gt; paladin to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I first got to Sol A, a level 50 bard working on the &quot;brand spanking<br/>
new&quot; lambent quests was single handedly controlling the Kings room and<br/>
surrounding spawns for 8 hours straight... A combination of lament, charm<br/>
and other level 50 bard capabilities allow them to do rather well against<br/>
sub-35 mobs. The amount of time it took for her to get the darn firewalker<br/>
boots to finally drop.  At level 38, with my brothers level 35 druid, I was<br/>
able to hold the King and the Torturer for hours and yes, I was getting XP<br/>
for most of the spawns in there.  Throw in my wifes level 36 warrior at the<br/>
time and there was no danger to us at all... at least until I got greedy and<br/>
went for the high shaman too.  Talk about a train from hell.  Thank god<br/>
druids get evac!  What a combo, evac and fear.<br/>
