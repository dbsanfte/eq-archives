 </span></blockquote>Just so you know where they&#39;re coming from, a lot of times you<br/>
have to work to clear part of a room/camp or the path to a<br/>
room/camp.  It&#39;s pretty aggravating if after you&#39;ve done this<br/>
and are resting, someone just waltzes in to take the named or<br/>
prize mob - something he couldn&#39;t have done if you hadn&#39;t done<br/>
the clearing before him.  It&#39;s likely the gnolls they killed<br/>
two rooms away fled there and they had to chase them.  Much as<br/>
I despise camping, if someone is at or near a room/camp, I ask<br/>
first if they&#39;re taking it or planning to take it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Paw varies depending on whether or not high level people are<br/>
harvesting there (yeah, I&#39;m guilty of that, but only because I<br/>
never visited when I was the right level and all my friends<br/>
keep asking me for snakeskin gloves and masks :-).  Usually<br/>
the high levels are after the named shamen and commanders,<br/>
leaving plenty of nobles.<br/>

Another good place if you&#39;re good about keeping an eye out for<br/>
griffons and hill giants in West Comonlands.  The young<br/>
kodiaks and kodiaks there give pretty good experience, the<br/>
occasional wandering wisps will give good loot, and if you<br/>
ever get in trouble there&#39;s lots of open space to flee/kite/<br/>
heal/zone.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever died in West Commonlands,<br/>
and the griffons and giants do a good job of keeping the riff<br/>
raff out.  There are dervish and orc camps there too, but they<br/>
are tough to crack without a group (7-9 mobs usually).<br/>
