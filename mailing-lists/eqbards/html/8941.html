<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340662381">Whoops, think that was me.  I guess if we want any of our problems<br/>
addressed, we just have to phrase them in such a way as they appear to be an<br/>
exploit.  That seems to get immediate attention whereas legitimate concerns<br/>
do not.<br/>

No answer on the letter sent to GZ, and I&#39;ve sent it twice now. . . . <br/>

A week or two ago, someone posted an &quot;exploit&quot; where you could<br/>
use the level 42 song to kill yourself without losing<br/>
experience.  Looks like they fixed it without fixing the bug in<br/>
the song:</div>
