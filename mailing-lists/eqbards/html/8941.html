<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340662381">Whoops, think that was me.  I guess if we want any of our problems<br/>

do not.<br/>

A week or two ago, someone posted an &quot;exploit&quot; where you could<br/>
use the level 42 song to kill yourself without losing<br/>
experience.  Looks like they fixed it without fixing the bug in<br/>
the song:</div>
