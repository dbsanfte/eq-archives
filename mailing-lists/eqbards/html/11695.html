<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500622337">It has been my experience there that evreything is related. Basilisks,<br/>
Lizards, GS, HGs, and clops.  My best example is when I had a group there<br/>
take 5 minutes and clear as many of these as we could.  Wizard, warrior,<br/>
shaman with pet, and cleric all out killing anything they saw.<br/>
<br/>
About 2 minutes later I could count 7 HGs while sitting and meditating.<br/>

&gt; Hmm.. I couldn&#39;t see any evidence that lizzies are placeholders for giants.  Killing many didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; increase the spawn of giants.  The giant skels definitely are, however.  Seriously though, with me and<br/>
&gt; that 45th level wizard working the hill (and I&#39;m pretty sure we were the only ones there) there were no<br/>
&gt; hill giants or skeletons on that hil.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say a level 45 wizard can do a good job of keeping the<br/>
&gt; &gt; HGs cleared or not.  Pull enough lizards and GS to the guard tower (make<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure the guards are there first) and you will have all the HGs you want.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I eventually stopped anyway, because a 45th level wizard came<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in and was doin a pretty good job clearing the area of all but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; occasional single pop of HGs (can&#39;t do much with just one!   :)  This was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fine.  Fairly done, and the biggest drawback to using charm in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first place.  Lack of mobs to charm.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just though I&#39;d share, since it was so rediculously moronic.  :)<br/>
