<div id="ygrps-yiv-868413835">Worse than that, for the whole playerbase, IMO, was his willingness to<br/>
completely throw out the detailed study John Kim had posted (article<br/>
comments indicate that was the thread he had been reading) and instead<br/>
rely on his very brief experience with the song before he got distracted<br/>
helping a player find his corpse. Then he announces he&#39;s perfectly happy<br/>
with the song, as if that negates anyone else&#39;s concerns. This seems<br/>
little different than Abashi&#39;s attitude.<br/>

&gt; Hmm. Check out his other article here. A little less encouraging, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; say.<br/>
