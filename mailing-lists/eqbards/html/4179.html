 </span></blockquote>I thought about this some more, and the above is probably the<br/>
reason why this issue is so polarized.<br/>
<br/>
If you subscribe to the &quot;everyone should be free to play the<br/>
way they like&quot; ideology, then people who withhold help from<br/>
twinkers are treating them differently based on how they play<br/>
the game, and thus violating the ideology.  So it isn&#39;t a<br/>
double standard.<br/>
<br/>
If you subscribe to the &quot;your actions should not detract from<br/>
others&#39; gameplay&quot; ideology, then twinking detracts from your<br/>
gameplay and you should withhold help from twinkers.<br/>
<br/>
Whichever ideology you subscribe to, your actions and feelings<br/>
are self-consistent, and the other ideology&#39;s actions are a<br/>
violation.  They are mutually exclusive, and thus there can be<br/>
no resolution or compromise between the two.  The best we can<br/>
hope for is coexistence without resorting to petty insults<br/>
(twinker or jealousy).<br/>
<br/>
If we can agree to that, I&#39;d like to end the twinking thread.<br/>
