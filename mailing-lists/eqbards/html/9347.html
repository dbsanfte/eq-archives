<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977067971">&lt;sigh&gt;  I am afraid that you are dealing with a two-fold problem:<br/>
<br/>
one - ad hoc groups generally suck - esp at level where player are not all<br/>
that experienced. they don&#39;t know what to do and they don&#39;t have practice<br/>
doing it.<br/>
<br/>
two - they don&#39;t really have to do it - hell its just the bard who dies -<br/>
eventually they muddle through - hell it&#39;s just a few orcs or dervs.  if it<br/>
is any consolation, they wont be able to do hard dungeons and will have a<br/>
really bad time learning this.  but it will need to be befallen if they go<br/>
there in late teens early 20s&#39;; or unrest in early 20&#39;s and try to fight<br/>
without correct crowd control and proper team work.<br/>
<br/>
for the past couple months, I have been fighting with the same group - a<br/>
regular group. we are well balanced class wise (tank tank healer caster<br/>
bard) with a couple &#39;extra&#39; chars we can go to the bench for (wizards,<br/>
enchanter, necro, druid).  you should really work to put something like this<br/>
together for your eq experience.  granted it has taken us four months to get<br/>
to where we are - including &#39;growing&#39; some new chars to get the good balance<br/>
needed. <br/>
<br/>
but the end result is worth it.  the feeling of being in battle and trusting<br/>
your life to your team is great!  I really have to force myself to scan my<br/>
health bar. in fact, I scan my healer&#39;s health bar more than my own.  the<br/>
team needs to keep him alive and he will keep us alive.  this makes a huge<br/>
difference in how effectively you can do your job - whether its crowd<br/>
control, tankage, or mana song.<br/>
<br/>
keep tryin and try to get a group going that plays on a regular basis and is<br/>
well balanced group of classes.<br/>

		I&#39;ve almost given up on trying to perfect this (Lullaby)<br/>
with pickup groups<br/>
		at my level (16-19). Either nobody understands /assist, they<br/>
don&#39;t trust my<br/>
		lullaby to work, or they just plain don&#39;t listen.</div>
