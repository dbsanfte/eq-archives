GZ Lullaby Tests completed on Veeshan<br/>
by Harliquinn Whiteshadow (Bristlebane)  posted 1/11/00 7:39:57 PM<br/>
<br/>
Hail,<br/>
GZ&#39;s bard Lullaby tests on Veeshan were just completed. Here is a summary of <br/>
what we found out.<br/>
<br/>
Using a level 40th Bard:<br/>
<br/>
1) Lullaby is designed so that there is a 25% resist rate on level 1 <br/>
creatures, and a 35% resist rate on creatures that con White to a 40th level <br/>
Bard. This rate decreases with increasing Charisma<br/>
<br/>
2) Lullaby is a 1 (to about 1.5) tick song. It is not effective when twisted <br/>
with another song. If you plan to use this song as an Area Mezmerize, use <br/>
ONLY this song. The length is about 3-5 seconds long only.<br/>
<br/>
3) The main error we found was that there is no actual text message being <br/>
displayed telling you the creature has resisted your Lullaby. Therefore you <br/>
will only see a &quot;Head nods&quot; for your previous attempt then on the next <br/>
&#39;tick&#39; the creature (IF it resists) just attacks with no &quot;Target has <br/>
resisted your song&quot;. This is the actual problem that caused bards to think <br/>
that creatures were attacking even while their heads were &#39;nodded&#39;. Refer to <br/>
#1 in that the effect only lasts for 3-5 seconds (1 tick worth).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some personal observations:<br/>
<br/>
1) The song has a LARGE radius. I am attaching a screenshot of the range <br/>
that was being affectected by GZ (Geoff the Bard in the screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
2) The song seems quite effective as long as one remembers it is NOT a <br/>
multiple-tick song. Only 1 tick, so you have to keep singing it constantly <br/>
for the continuous effects.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to GZ especially and the other bards who showed up!<br/>
<br/>
Harliquinn Whiteshadow, wondering who has that name on Veeshan!?!?<br/>

Nice Screenshot, Harli. Gallanite is my bard for the day on there. I&#39;ve made <br/>
a copy as a souvenier.<br/>
<br/>
GZ dropped several interesting tidbits during the test, and during a chat <br/>
beforehand. The one that caught my attention is that the new song should be <br/>
up in a week or two if it passes testing.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It provides some protection from magic, but not the MR way&quot; is how I <br/>
remember the quote.<br/>
<br/>
Servo. The song is continuous, but when you stop, it only lasts three or <br/>
four seconds longer. Hence its no good for twisting.<br/>

Here s the quote from my log :<br/>

[Wed Jan 12 01:34:01 2000] Geoff says, &#39;Next song helps protect you from <br/>
spells in a compeletely non MR way&#39;<br/>

In the chat before hand GZ mentioned that the resist should be lower once <br/>
the creature was mez&#39;d. Not sure if that was the case. I&#39;ll post up the data <br/>
and try to do a little bit of analysis tonight.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note: GZ had a different client than us. He actually does play a <br/>
bard and is in his mid 30&#39;s, but he has always seen a resist message.<br/>
He seemed pretty pissed off when he found out that the resist wasn&#39;t <br/>
showing.<br/>
<br/>
and in case you&#39;re reading this, thanks again Geoff<br/>

Additional instruments<br/>
by Nindar  posted 1/11/00 8:43:11 PM<br/>
<br/>
As anothe side note, GZ said that Kelin&#39;s practice lute and the small brass <br/>
trumpet are both in the game, you just have to look hard.<br/>
<br/>
Is this another Fiery avenger? I have noticed that a few wierd people sell <br/>
bardic instruments (Krak in South Karana??) so maybe you need good faction <br/>
with some of them to get a quest?<br/>

Thanks for taking the time to do the test GZ. And for the interesting <br/>
surrounding discussion. Suprised more people didn&#39;t turn up, but I guess it <br/>
is work time on the West coast.<br/>
For those who missed it. The results as I understand them were.<br/>
<br/>
1) A resist message is missing. This is missleading. It will be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
2) Lull only lasts one tick. Many bards expect it to be three. Don&#39;t twist.<br/>
<br/>
3) Minimum resist on any mob is about 25%. About 35% on whites, much higher <br/>
on reds. Good charisma lowers the chance of resist.<br/>
