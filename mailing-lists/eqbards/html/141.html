<br/>
    I have heard of a temple dedicated to out lord Bristlebane located in<br/>
the city of Rivervale.  When I reached the 6th level of accomplishment I<br/>
thought with the help of Selo&#39;s Acceleando I could journey forth and pay<br/>
homage.  Alas I was woefully mistaken.  Fortunately in the land of<br/>
Bertoxxulous there resides a noble ranger by the name of Zepheloth, whose<br/>
patience and generosity are truly astounding.  He helped me reclaim my<br/>
meager possessions and rescued me countless times from some infernal place<br/>
called Highpass Hold.  I can only hope that in the future I will have the<br/>
opportunity to repay his kindness.  Perhaps there is a sonnet in there<br/>
somewhere?<br/>

&gt;&gt;I agree - Bards do NOT have to be the bringers of sweetness and light to<br/>
&gt;&gt;the world.  The idea that Bards should provide their services for free<br/>
&gt;&gt;goes against my thoughts on why we are ALL trying to play Bards...we are<br/>
&gt;&gt;each free to do as we please!  Some might want to charge an arm and leg<br/>
&gt;&gt;for their services (and sometimes that is a cheap price if a corpse is<br/>
&gt;&gt;in deadly territory!), some might wish to gain a reputation for being a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;nice&quot; guy or gal and do it for free.  Nothing should be set in stone...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;He is not such a good god, I have learned, but I can say one thing for<br/>
&gt;certain about ol&#39; Bristley: He&#39;s not stuck up and all hoighty toighty like<br/>
&gt;the other gods.  Personally, I have found followers of life to be bordering<br/>
&gt;on fanatics.  And I will never go to war on the pixies with my wood elf<br/>
&gt;brothers and sisters, those poor pixies are just having fun.  And who could<br/>
&gt;kill such cute creatures, nearly transparent robes covering their shapely<br/>
&gt;little frames?  Ai yi yi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t believe I am good or evil, but kind of a trickster like<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;here&#39;s a story of how I worship my god through my actions:  This giant<br/>
&gt;barbarian woman screeched that she was about to commit suicide, so everyone<br/>
&gt;in greater Faydrak could hear her, &quot;Come and get free stuff.&quot;   I turned<br/>
&gt;around, and there she was, standing right by me there at the main lift to<br/>
&gt;Kelethin.  So I decided to make some small talk, y&#39;know ask why she was<br/>
&gt;killing herself all that.   Shamans are weird, never did get an answer.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;perhaps it was because all manner of folk soon had me wedged in front of<br/>
&gt;her, I couldn&#39;t even move!  With a great leap and accelerando, I managed to<br/>
&gt;free myself, and then climbed a hill to look down on them all.  They were<br/>
&gt;this clump of elves, dwarves and gnomes, with a smattering of other races<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;well, all grouped together real tight.  I snickered and grabbed my lute,<br/>
&gt;such a dark evening, so many people, perfect time for a song!  And I lit<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&#39;em<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;all up!  You know the tune!  With each chorus of my song, every person in<br/>
&gt;that mob glowed like a torch!  Now, no one was hurt here, it was just<br/>
&gt;visually stunning, but lo the curses that rained on me!  Who am I to stop,<br/>
&gt;however, it just looked too good, so I continued and let the fiery glow of<br/>
&gt;my song blind the mass, an allogary of their greed.  Bristlebane, however,<br/>
&gt;rewarded my pleasure with a merry chase by the town drunkard... all the way<br/>
&gt;to lesser faydark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone know of Bristlebane&#39;s house of worship?  Must journey there one day,<br/>
&gt;if such a place indeed exists.<br/>
