<div id="ygrps-yiv-667681377">I am very interested in testing out code on the TestServer.<br/>
   Here&#39;s my dilema:  I dont care to advance a level 1 bard to<br/>
   level 45, I&#39;ve already done it, it&#39;s boring as hell.  In fact,<br/>
   I dont give two hoots about adjustments to the snakes in <br/>
   Qeynos Hills, I wanna test out SolB and LGuk changes.  I <br/>
   wanna experiment with higher level songs that they tweak.<br/>
   I want to make sure that they dont break songs that work<br/>
   normally when trying to tweak other game elements.  Being<br/>
   a level 1 bard, that would be hard to do.  Plus, I&#39;ve got<br/>
   a few level 10 characters on the TestServer from GM buffing,<br/>
   but that&#39;s the farthest I&#39;ve been promoted to on there.<br/>
<br/>
   How would you all suggest that I get my current bard&#39;s <br/>
   data transported over to the TestServer and offer myself<br/>
   up to test various game elements.  I&#39;m keen to the logistics<br/>
   of the game, I know most of the formulas, most of the expected<br/>
   effects of things.  I know the zones fairly well, I am well<br/>
   versed in ways people skirt obstacles, etc.<br/>
<br/>
   The problem is where do you start?  Who do you contact?<br/>
<br/>
   I think it would be sweet to get a handful of bards on <br/>
   our respective servers to duplicate their characters<br/>
   onto Test and work out a few things for Verant, since <br/>
   their Q&A is lacking badly.  I wouldnt mind spending an<br/>
   hour a week, just farting around with new changes on the<br/>
   server.<br/>
<br/>
   Being level 1, or even level 10, doesnt offer much for<br/>
   testing anything out.  Hell being level 25 really doesnt<br/>
   either, since most of the songs they tweak are above that.<br/>
   I&#39;d love to test the new songs when they decide to implement<br/>
   them.  Play around with them, give feedback.  After all,<br/>
   it&#39;s too late to check them out once they are live.  And<br/>
   I&#39;m convinced /feedback -&gt; /dev/null.<br/>
<br/>
   Ideas?<br/>
