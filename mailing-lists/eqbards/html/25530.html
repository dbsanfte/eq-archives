I was working at the Faire, as I always do.  This year, I&#39;m mostly in a <br/>
shop, but at noon, I was giving the hat-stand vendor in Sherwood Forest a <br/>
break.  That&#39;s when a nice young lady came up and asked me where the EQ <br/>
meeting was, so I led her there.  I got to see everyone in line for food, <br/>
then had to get back to work.  *sighs*<br/>
At least I&#39;m making good money.<br/>

Back to EQ-related questions:<br/>
<br/>
Do you think a Bard can survive in EK at 16?  Solo?<br/>
