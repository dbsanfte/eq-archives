<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917699393">One of the best duos I have been in was with a mage, he was always about 4<br/>
levels above me and we really could hunt effectively. We were a great team,<br/>
I would be tanking and he would call &quot;just short of boom&quot; do I would switch<br/>
to mana song exclusively and then I would hear the standing sound followed<br/>
by a boom followed by the words &quot;You gain experience&quot; :o) Being able to back<br/>
off while the pet tanked was great as well. Not to mention all those free<br/>
goodies, the great dagger for my range slot, bandages, levitate and water<br/>
breathing rings, it always felt like Christmas morning *laughs*<br/>
<br/>
On AE in a group for &quot;crowd control&quot;, there DOES have to be some point at<br/>
which it is more efficient to hurt the whole pull (while focusing on one)<br/>
than to mez and take on one at a time, right?  The amount of damage you can<br/>
do with AE far exceeds the damage you can do to a single (before 38 at<br/>
least) so there MUST be some situations where that is a more efficient use<br/>
of your abilities (and a mages). The trick of course is staying alive, which<br/>
is possible with a healer. But pre-hurting 3 mobs while you focus on one is<br/>
a really efficient battle strategy, I used it a lot (with great success) at<br/>
the bridge in the Lake. <br/>
I could be wrong, but I suspect that mezzing, while clearly a solid tactic,<br/>
is not the end-all be-all of dealing with a crowd. I know it FEELS safer,<br/>
but I bet in some situations that people are being over-cautious, that using<br/>
AE damage you could get a lot more exp in the same amount of time (plus its<br/>
more exciting :o)<br/>
