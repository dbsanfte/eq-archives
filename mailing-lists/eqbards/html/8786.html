&gt;Actually, Pugius is 5 DMG / 23 Delay (the Dragoon Dirk is 6/23).  It can be<br/>
&gt;gleened off the Lesser Blade Fiend in Unrest.  Very, very rare spawn.  I<br/>
&gt;spent 3 or 4 levels there and only saw it twice.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I acquired a Pugius dagger quite some time ago from a<br/>
&gt; &gt; friendly bard for only<br/>
&gt; &gt; 25pp.  It&#39;s stats are 6dam 23 delay magic peircing.  Its<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage ratio is<br/>
&gt; &gt; just a little bit better than a Dragoon dirk but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have any stat<br/>
&gt; &gt; increases.  What I&#39;m curious to know is where can this weapon<br/>
&gt; &gt; be found?  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; looks just like a regular or a rusty dagger and mine is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; only one I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever seen.  I forgot to ask the bard I got it from where he<br/>
&gt; &gt; got it...so any<br/>
&gt; &gt; help would be appreciated.  I&#39;m guessing that because it has the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; graphic as a regular or rusty many people overlook this fine weapon.<br/>
