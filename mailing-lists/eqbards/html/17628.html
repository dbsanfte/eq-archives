<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-803954156">Does it last a pathetic amount of time like the last charm song? Or does it<br/>
stick for longer now? This was one thing that annoyed me about our charm<br/>
song, the fact that it only lasts a few seconds you feel like you don&#39;t<br/>
have enough power over the mob you are charming. Would be nice if we could<br/>
have a pet for 30 seconds or so.....<br/>

Not sure what level it caps at, but its higher than 49.  I charmed a level<br/>
50 ice giant last night.<br/>

Anyone else notice that we&#39;re going to need ANOTHER charm upgrade somewhere<br/>
in the 50&#39;s?  39th will only take us to 49th level npc&#39;s.<br/>
