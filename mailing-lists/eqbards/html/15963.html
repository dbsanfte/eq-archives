<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360271155">I&#39;ve seen some bad one on E&#39;ci but none as bad as the previously mentioned<br/>
Balonie Sandwych.  I know for a fact she was reported at least a half dozen<br/>
times by guild members of mine.  One of them quit the game after the<br/>
response from a GM who basically told him to shut up and mind his own<br/>
business, though not that nicely.  She must know somebody.  Some were clever<br/>
puns, mostly gnomes, but others???<br/>
<br/>
How about:<br/>
<br/>
	Mulee Packanimal		Who takes a mule to 20th level?<br/>
	Supermodel			Name eventually changed<br/>
	Halfdead Elfzman<br/>
	Halfelf			How the heck did this get thru?<br/>
<br/>
My favorite pun though has to be the monk named Thelonius<br/>
<br/>
	Kitasi<br/>
