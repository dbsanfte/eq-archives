<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182243270">Nameless crashed tonight and in the chat room<br/>
GM-Hideaki was there.  He and GZ were brainstorming on<br/>
ideas for new bard songs (they were in the same room).<br/>
 I told him we could help, and that I&#39;d email him our<br/>
best ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Please email directly to me (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gww6e@...">gww6e@...</a>) your<br/>
ideas.  Please please please don&#39;t waste this<br/>
opportunity.  The bind song is an option, its been<br/>
covered actually and was proposed to me for my ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your hastly responces,<br/>

the horses mouth.<br/>

PPS: Clouding provides no invis vs undead peroid.<br/>
