<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094190678">When it was merely an Ice Giant,<br/>
I was not too worried &lt;heh&gt;<br/>
but about an hour later...<br/>
<br/>
I danced with a dragon!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lady Voxx called me by name,<br/>
How could I refuse such fame?<br/>
So into her lair, I came.<br/>
<br/>
Amazing to see, just her and me,<br/>
I played my drum and thought to run.<br/>
But run to where? Not knowing this lair,<br/>
I chose instead to stand and stare.<br/>
<br/>
She was big and blue,<br/>
Truly an astounding view.<br/>
I lasted several rounds,<br/>
but alas - too few.&quot;<br/>

somewhere on Innoruuk...<br/>
<br/>
p.s. server reset yesterday afternoon (?) so my guild (The Pantheon on<br/>
Innoruuk server) took a shot at Voxxy-woxxy.  And she went down!  2 hammers,<br/>
a crys spear, a mask.  We tried to pull her from the lair but she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to budge.  She summoned me to her side.  It was very amazing being the<br/>
only one in the Lair right next to her.  I scampered around and I think I<br/>
got some screen shots.  I did not feel like running into the pit so I kinda<br/>
tried to hide and hope the others would come get her but after a few rounds,<br/>
she dispatched me to Rivervale.  Later, we were dividing up the loot and<br/>
just finished when the zone crashed again (and re-popped.)  Had it not been<br/>
3am, we would have killed her again.  Instead, GM and Guides came and<br/>
cleared lair so we could do CR for those who got smooshed in the re-pop.</div>
