And you nailed it in one.  As for &quot;immediate entrance&quot; - my entrance is <br/>
secured for all of my characters - on the condition that I make 30th <br/>
level.  This was a mutual agreement between me and the person I&#39;m making <br/>
the trade with, because he got me into the last guild I was in, so we&#39;re <br/>
friends, and I don&#39;t want to renege on that.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t want to ask them to kill a dragon, because they have a <br/>
schedule for that, and all of the Bards in the Guild are on a schedule to <br/>
receive their epic stuff.  So what I&#39;m trying for is enough to be worth <br/>
this windfall, without appearing to take advantage of my soon-to-be Guildmates.<br/>
<br/>
I will let you know how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
