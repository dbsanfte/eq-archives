Clouding while anyone in your group is camoed or invised, they<br/>
are visible (not to you but to the mobs) every time your song<br/>
pulses.  This is pretty easy to demonstrate - have a group<br/>
member cast invis on you while you are singing clouding.  <br/>
Target a far-away mob and /con it repeatedly.  Every time your<br/>
song pulses, it can see you and the /con message will change.<br/>
