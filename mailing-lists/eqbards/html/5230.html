 </span></blockquote>I know exactly what you mean there.  But I tried to at least not just scream SUCKS and then list why it sucked.  I didn&#39;t even say it sucked, I just said I was feeling bored.  Then I tried to offer some kind of solutions, bad solutions I admit.  And I had a few beers in me so I swore like a sailor, heheheh.<br/>

I still don&#39;t like how players can regenerate (except trolls!).  I think people shouldn&#39;t regenerate, and maybe trade skill items could alleviate this somehow.  I agree wholeheartedly people should use potions, perhaps you can&#39;t drink a potion very well when something&#39;s hitting you--spit it up.  Give newbies potions as part of starting gear.<br/>
<br/>
As for death, I like how an upcoming game Unknown handles it: You can die.  You just hope someone is there to resurrect you.  There are also items to help you &quot;escape&quot; death.  But I really like the threat of true death, I think that would add a lot.  That game also will have a finite amount of gold in the world.  Interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, not quitting yet but who knows, spend more time reading this list than playing anymore.  Guess I&#39;m just hoping a patch comes along that effects things somehow that would entice me back.  (Also, being items never really degrade in any manner whatsoever, can&#39;t wait for a market glut and really cheap great items for sale or free, hehehe)<br/>
