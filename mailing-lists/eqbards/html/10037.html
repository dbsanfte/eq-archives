I noticed a couple patches ago that Screech seemed ot have changed. The <br/>
first thing I noticed that the halo effect was showing around 2 players but <br/>
not the mob they were fighting. I was trying to save a pair of folks from a <br/>
sudden attack when they were oom. It seemed that the range of Screech had <br/>
taken a definite hit. I have used Screech several times, mainly in dungeons <br/>
as a means of freeing up the Evac&#39;er from being interrupted and nearly <br/>
everything would run unless it resisted. Now I have to be closer to mobs to <br/>
get the effect. It is most noticeable outdoors, maybe due to the closer <br/>
overall quarters of dungeons. I have used Screech in dungeons where we didnt <br/>
evac, it spaced the number of mobs beating on the group out to a more <br/>
manageable number at a time. This depends on a place where the distance the <br/>
mobs run and return causes no more mobs to aggro. Use with caution, heh.<br/>
