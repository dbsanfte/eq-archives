<b>Subject:</b> Zone size on the Moon? RoK big or SoL size? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527435384">Your note gets me wondering something, has anyone seen or heard what the<br/>
zone sizes will be for SoL? I remember how bad I hated the new zones when<br/>
RoK came out. Oh so big, but then with SoV they seemed to scale them smaller<br/>
than RoK, but larger than the first ever zones in Everquest. I sure hope the<br/>
Moon has about the same size zones as Great Divide, I think that is about<br/>
the perfect size zone. So has anyone heard?  <br/>
