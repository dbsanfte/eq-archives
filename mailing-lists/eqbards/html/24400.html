<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039878244">Recently?  How about last weekend..  I was kind of pissed - everytime I&#39;ve<br/>
been in KC - Hand/Warlord was cnsidered a linked camp.  Was camping the Hand<br/>
room and another group moved in on the Warlord Room.  The first drop after<br/>
they took it a Harmonic Dagger dropped.<br/>
<br/>
Two zones for Armor drops - (assuming you have Velious) - Skyshrine (but you<br/>
have to take Dragon hits).  Better AC and better bonuses than Lambent.  And<br/>
most are no-drop - so they aren&#39;t farmed for trading.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to try to get Frosted Velium from Icewell Keep.  You need<br/>
like a 60 puller if you fight them - (they resist almost everything under<br/>
the sun) - and most people don&#39;t want to go anti-Dorf - but if you happen to<br/>
see a gooup fighting there - you may want to stick around and ask them for<br/>
the drops (I believe they are no drop as well)<br/>

Btw, I&#39;m done trying for the Harmony dagger in KC. No one I&#39;ve talked to<br/>
has seen one drop in a long time on Xegony.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input,<br/>
