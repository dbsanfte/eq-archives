<b>Subject:</b> Level 12 needs a new goal <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907564184">Over the last few weeks, Adagia&#39;s goal was to acquire a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
and to reach level 12 so she could finally sing Brusco&#39;s Boastful<br/>
Bellow.  Last weekend her call to purchase a Dirk in Crushbone was<br/>
finally answered, and last night she earned the right to scribe the<br/>
12th song.  She&#39;s currently calling E. Freeport home, and she&#39;s<br/>
finding the adventures there entertaining, but she has suddenly found<br/>
herself without any burning immediate goals.  What excitement waits<br/>
for a Bard of 12 songs? <br/>
