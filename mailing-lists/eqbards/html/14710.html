<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078539302">I have a higher level bard who I always look for when i have questions<br/>
(on Veeshan), I randomly picked her (was the highest level bard in the<br/>
zone when I was lvl 1), she answered my questions, and actually gave me<br/>
some armor she had sitting around (I most definitly didn&#39;t ask for it, I<br/>
NEVER ask for items from people unless I know they are the no-drop/no<br/>
use to anyone but me type items).  She has always been helpful, and we<br/>
often spend down time, just chatting.  I make every effort to help her<br/>
whenever I can, for example I am going to Erudan to buy my lvl 19 song,<br/>
so I ask her if there&#39;s anything she needs from that part of the<br/>
world.   <br/>
This weekend, though, a friend of hers wanted to buy a nice item<br/>
(executioner axe) but was 50 (yea the guy was sticking that hard to his<br/>
price, and wouldn&#39;t take any items in trade).  She saw I was in Oasis<br/>
(he was the N freeport tradign bazaar), and asked me if I had the money<br/>
(amazingly I did, I was saving up to buy a pair of jagged bands).  So I<br/>
(gladly) ran to freeport (annoying my group, though they understood once<br/>
I explained) and gave him the money.<br/>
<br/>
To make it even cooler (I was so excited to give something back), on my<br/>
way back, I ran into Dorn (he had been trained to zone).  Hmmm, cons<br/>
blue...  Hmmm... I can do this...  He&#39;s on my agro list (I keep a list<br/>
of EVRYTHING that has killed me).  So I fire up selo&#39;s, bellow x6,<br/>
repeat and kite him up and down the beach.  One less dark elf on my agro<br/>
list (too bad he didn&#39;t have anything, I was hoping for at least some<br/>
ringmail)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d just like to thank whoever on the list suggested the lvl 18<br/>
&quot;no weapons&quot; solo technique.  After losing lvl 18 4 times (ugh) in bad<br/>
groups, I decided to solo, and used that technique to get 4/5 of the way<br/>
there last night in N Karana.  (0, count em, 0 deaths, amazing for me). <br/>
No to mention some nice druid let me loot a griffene charm (though I<br/>
like collar of undead protection better)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
