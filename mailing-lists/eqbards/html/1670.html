<b>Subject:</b> Imbalance between Bards that can only wear medium sizes and bards that can wear small and medium sizes <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-476039241">First off let me say I am sorry about the post yesterday when I forgot to<br/>
remove all of the rest of the digest in my reply - I wont let that happen<br/>
again!<br/>
<br/>
I am a lvl 22 bard on Bertox and I have begun to notice a severe imbalance<br/>
between myself and my wood-elf brethren.  Medium sized bronze armor is<br/>
almost impossible to come by (i myself have NEVER seen any for sale) and<br/>
small bronze plate armor is relatively easy to get.  Other bards who are<br/>
able to wear the small bronze plate are much more viable at my level than I,<br/>
simply because they have the ability to absorb more damage than I do with my<br/>
banded mail.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a suggestion for this dilemma?  I am currently searching<br/>
for spots where I can maximize my money making potential so i can pick up<br/>
some select peices of plate mail, or other lighter magical armors that might<br/>
be for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Dont get me wrong - I am not whining!  I just would like to find something<br/>
to up my armor class which has not changed much since 14th level, when you<br/>
take out the Defense skill increases that you get with each level.<br/>
