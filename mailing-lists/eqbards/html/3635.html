&gt; Ah if only that were true =)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; i died twice yesterday =(  it may have had something to do with the level 48<br/>
&gt; paladin we were trying to kill hehe.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d have to disagree with that statement too. My group is 30-35 and we<br/>
definitely die. I see dead people from other parties my level regularly.<br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s group is the highest level on Erollisi Marr (40-45) and they<br/>
definitely die.<br/>
<br/>
The only difference I can see is that after 29, clerics can revive, so if<br/>
the cleric doesn&#39;t die (and there IS a cleric, often there is not) you can<br/>
get a free ride back to your corpse.<br/>
