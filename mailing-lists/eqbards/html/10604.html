<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764943014">LOL!  I didn&#39;t mean to imply that I&#39;m some power-leveling freakazoid.  That&#39;s the <br/>
amount of exp that I feel GOOD about on those occasions when I&#39;m camping something <br/>
for just that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I admit that I have a goal of at least one level per weekend, but playing ALL <br/>
weekend, as I do, that usually breaks down as:  15 hours to level, 10-15 hours to <br/>
mess around, 10 hours to solo one of my secondary characters (I get exhausted much <br/>
faster playing in groups).<br/>
<br/>
Compared to my friends, I&#39;m a snail.  I&#39;m now frequently grouping with the <br/>
secondary characters of my early-days party members.  One guy, with only one <br/>
computer in his house, has a level 50 warrior and a level 27 Enchantress, and his <br/>
WIFE has a level 34 Cleric!  And they work full time!<br/>
<br/>
Kenross Cantoforjado, 34 songs, Innoruuk<br/>
Bisibiku, enchantress 11, Innoruuk<br/>
Aangie, warrior 11, Innoruuk<br/>

&gt; Grief - I&#39;m happy with that over a couple weeks time - and that&#39;s being on<br/>
&gt; a LOT too. Just not that concerned about leveling - got other things to do,<br/>
&gt; people to see, songs to sing, drinks to down - when it happens, it happens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I consider it good when I can net a bubble in 3-4 hours, so perhaps I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not as<br/>
&gt; &gt;demanding as you!  ;)<br/>
