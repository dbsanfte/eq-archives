&gt; the right side hall and pulled vampire bat&#39;s.  Then went to the right again<br/>
&gt; and saw a hall to some deadly black widows. Pulled them using lament -<br/>
&gt; worked good and if you get 3 bugs that&#39;s nowhere near as bad as 5 GIBS.  But<br/>
&gt; me being careful I spent the time to pull singles (well ok I did get a<br/>
&gt; couple doubles.)<br/>

&gt; But what I wanna know is where are the basalt gargs?  Did I not go deep<br/>
&gt; enough or is there a secret door/illusionary wall?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, no secret wall - just go a little deeper past the spider room.  You&#39;ll take a<br/>
few turns, then you&#39;ll see a door on your right with gargs clustered around it.  3<br/>
there, I think, that can be either basalt or clay.  We want basalt, of course. :)<br/>
Was very easy to pull single gargs there using lament.  Then, if you go a little<br/>
further you&#39;l reach the bridge leading into the tower, with the 3 caster froggies<br/>
straight in front of you, and a few more gargs up in an alcove on the left.  I<br/>
had trouble lamenting the caster froggies for some reason, always ended up<br/>
with all 3 at once. :)  Thank goodness for pixie strike and elemental...<br/>

&gt;                 &gt; PS. Can anyone tell me what level Greater Ice bones are, I<br/>
&gt; was in the<br/>
&gt;                 &gt; bedroom in L Guk with my group and we had cleared the<br/>
&gt; area. I went round<br/>
&gt;                 ------<br/>
&gt;                 There are two paths leading out of the BR and they both very<br/>
&gt; shortly empty<br/>
&gt;                 into the same room.  This room, the &quot;bat room&quot;, has a<br/>
&gt; passage leading off to<br/>
&gt;                 the left and to the right.  Most people are heading left as<br/>
&gt; that takes you<br/>
&gt;                 over toward the assassin, etc. and most of lower guk.  The<br/>
&gt; bat room room has<br/>
&gt;                 a couple of frog spawns and some sonic bats.  Here&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; tricky part.  The<br/>
&gt;                 invis vs undead that you got at the zone doesn&#39;t help you<br/>
&gt; with the bats,<br/>
&gt;                 only the frogs, however, if you hug the wall going left<br/>
&gt; pretty tightly then<br/>
&gt;                 the bats won&#39;t agro on you.<br/>
