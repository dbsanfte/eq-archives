&gt; Hail all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a newbie question to ask.  I have recently gained Level 12 and have<br/>
&gt; been experimeting with bellow.  I had a few questions such as: is it a DD<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; AE song and if I bellow one creature can it effect others such that they<br/>
&gt; will follow along and attack me.  I wanted to know a little about the<br/>
&gt; possible strategies that people use with this song.  Thanks for all your<br/>
&gt; help.<br/>

now?  Basically you can use it like an extra attack (think of it as an extra<br/>
sword).  Another benefit is that it will sometimes interrupt a caster.  If<br/>
attacking a mob (with any means) would cause others to come after you, then<br/>
so will Bellow.  In other words, if there&#39;s a single scarab you want to<br/>
attack, go ahead, but if there are 3 dervishes, bellow would bring all 3,<br/>
just like using ranged weapons would do.<br/>
