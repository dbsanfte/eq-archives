<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646096622">Nah, wishful thinking unfortunately.  The test results I sent in to GZ<br/>
covered both with and without lute.  The false resist percentage was nearly<br/>
identical, with lute yes being actually slightly higher.  I still think it<br/>
acts like a bug in the resist routine.  I got about 70% the false resists<br/>
with low blues that I got with 1st-2nd level critters.  Could be a data<br/>
spike but with 1500 tests on each category not too likely.  Seems the best<br/>
analog to fit the data I could come up with was still that the song has a<br/>
minus to resist and when the modified resist comes up negative as a result<br/>
the critter doesn&#39;t resist (so no resist message) but the logic blows out<br/>
before actually applying the effect to the mob due to getting an unhandled<br/>
resist value.<br/>
<br/>
GZ sent me an email that he would definitely look at the test data I sent<br/>
and follow up on it, but that with the holidays it might be a while.<br/>
Hopefully it won&#39;t get pushed aside and forgotten.  The test made it pretty<br/>
clear that the song wasn&#39;t having the effect it should have.  Either the<br/>
resist logic is totally screwed up and isn&#39;t reporting all resists (which<br/>
means its actually resisted a lot) or there&#39;s a bug in the fails to resist<br/>
logic somewhere that&#39;s messing up the duration.  Either way we will<br/>
hopefully get some info on it.  I know Baelish over at Caster&#39;s Realm sent<br/>
in a query on it for us too and he&#39;s pretty tight with GZ.<br/>

I read a post the other day on the Concert Hall that has since scrolled off<br/>
so as a result I can&#39;t paste the full text into here.  Everything below is<br/>
from memory so if someone else remembers the post correct me if I left<br/>
something out or misstated the original posters comments.<br/>
<br/>
The original poster had a theory about the effect of equipping a lute while<br/>
singing lullaby.  Like other bards have commented, the poster had noticed<br/>
that mobs were still attacking him even though they did not resist the<br/>
lullaby and should have been sleeping.  In one combat he decided not to<br/>
equip the lute and instead just sang the lullaby.  He noticed that the mobs<br/>
stopped attacking him while they were asleep.  The song appeared to work<br/>
like it was supposed to.  The poster then stated a theory that perhaps<br/>
lullaby has two effects that mobs have a chance to resist, similar to DDD.<br/>
With DDD, you get the area of effect DOT plus the lowering of the mobs AC<br/>
effect. If the mobs fails one resist but makes the other then the song gets<br/>
fully resisted.  The posters theory was that lullaby had two effects and in<br/>
order to get both of them to work you have to equip the lute.  Singing the<br/>
song only has one effect of putting the mob to sleep.  Mobs only get one<br/>
resist check.  Singing the song while equipping a lute puts them to sleep<br/>
plus nixes the hate list.  Mob gets two resist checks.  If the mob makes one<br/>
the song doesn&#39;t effect him.  In this case there is a bug that still gives<br/>
you the &quot;head nods&quot; message when you should get a resist message.    <br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t had the chance to test this for myself so I thought I would throw it<br/>
out and see what everyone else thinks.<br/>
