<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987060889">Part of my problem obviously is my dismal state of armor.  I have next to<br/>
none..  Where do I get it and for how much?  Part of my problem is lack of<br/>
funds.  I&#39;ve never been able to get more than a plat or two more than the<br/>
cost of my next song.  I&#39;ve also been buying every song when I level - I&#39;ve<br/>
since read that is not always the best way to go..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again!<br/>

&gt; Welp, all of the replies are true but I think you are not fully utilizing<br/>
&gt; the bard. The bard my be the second best soloing class there is. Im 20th<br/>
&gt; level now and still soloing. You may be playing the bard like a fighter<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; occasional sings a song. Wrong. At 9th level go to Ro. Make sure you got a<br/>
&gt; full suit of leather. Armor is everything in this game. Get out your handy </span></blockquote></div>
