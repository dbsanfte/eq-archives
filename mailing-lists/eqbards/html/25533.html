<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367755277">K, I&#39;ll look for ya on Saturday...we mostly hang out at pendragon, faire<br/>
pair, or at the sea devil tavern.  Oh, and I can&#39;t really drool on the<br/>
girls, unless I want bruises...my wife seems to have something against<br/>
me drooling on them...*shrug*<br/>
<br/>
As for the horn, yeah, grab a horn from the shop (you can also get one<br/>
from Krak in south karana, using the faction song, if you don&#39;t wanna<br/>
run all the way back to town.  You&#39;ll be dubious to him, so run up, play<br/>
your faction song w/ wind, and you can use him as a merchant, or, sneak<br/>
behind him, and he&#39;ll trade, as well.  If you can, get one of the<br/>
shell&#39;s out of Siren&#39;s Grotto...you seem to have some way of getting<br/>
high level stuff...<br/>
<br/>
Lute of the Howler is a dream for me...I really don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever<br/>
see one, much less own one...I&#39;m still stuck w/ Mistmoore Drums, because<br/>
I can&#39;t seem to get a group together to go get dalnir/kaesora/ot coins<br/>
*shrug*<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;d really like to get a Drums of the Beast, and see if the speed cap<br/>
is hit at 43...but...)<br/>
