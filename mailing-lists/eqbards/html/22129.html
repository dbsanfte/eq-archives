&gt; We are looking into a few bardic changes. Nothing is set in stone yet on <br/>
&gt; this, it still has to be reviewed, but I thought I&#39;d let you know what<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re <br/>
&gt; thinking about. We are thinking about reducing secondary resists for <br/>
&gt; targeted mesmerize songs (with the possibility of a new song along these <br/>
&gt; lines). There are some other potential changes that we are considering,<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll have to tell you about them after we have a chance to talk them over <br/>
&gt; further.<br/>
