Subject: [eqbards] Suggestions for a Level 30<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello all!  I have just returned to the list and EQ after a 2 month hiatus.<br/>
I<br/>
have finally hit level 30 with my Bard, Ranian, and I am looking for places<br/>
to<br/>
hunt now to get through relatively quickly. I am currently soloing Froon and<br/>
Choon, killing bandits for sashes (actually gives a little xp and reduces<br/>
boredom for me) and Ulrich McMannus in WK. I don&#39;t want to do him to much as<br/>
my<br/>
Barb faction is low as is.<br/>
<br/>
What other places can I hunt solo or with a 32 Enchanter for good xp?<br/>
<br/>
And I know my equipment is out of date but what would be suggested that<br/>
isn&#39;t to<br/>
expensive?<br/>
<br/>
Arms: Lambent Vambraces<br/>
Back: Cloak of the Icebear<br/>
Bracer 1: Lambent Bracer<br/>
Bracer 2: Bracer of Scavenging<br/>
Chest: Lambent BP<br/>
Ears: Opalline Earring (2)<br/>

Hands: Iksar Scaled Gloves<br/>
Head: Skull Shaped Barbrute<br/>

<br/>
Other: MM Drums, Runed Bone Fork, Gnoll Hide Whip, Blade of Fiery<br/>
Lamentations,<br/>
Obsidian Shard (2) and Enamelled Black Mace.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the help and I enjoy the list a lot. I don&#39;t get to play much<br/>
anymore (wife is pregnant so were getting ready).<br/>
