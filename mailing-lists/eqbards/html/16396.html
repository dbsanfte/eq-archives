<div id="ygrps-yiv-372059649">When we do Innoruuk we all fight in a corner with our backs to the wall.<br/>
Innoruuk is happy to face us.  In this position his gravity flux doesn&#39;t<br/>
throw us out the door and potentially bring trains of mobs back.  When I&#39;m<br/>
gravity fluxed I turn and run against the wall as I come down (old Quake<br/>
reflexed kicking in).  Their does appear to be some slowing of the fall<br/>
cause by my friction against the wall.  I have not died to a gflux since<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing that trick.  *shrug*  Could be just luck.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve yet to resist Innoruk&#39;s gravity flux, but for some reason<br/>
&gt; high MR seems to decrease the damage you take from it.  The<br/>
&gt; first time I fought him, I got tossed 3-4 times before my hp<br/>
&gt; bar ever showed any white.<br/>
