<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904435258"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I broke out my flute in MM tonight , hiding my party from a train ,<br/>
&gt; and I noticed that I _COULD_NOT_ see my party , guess the patch lied ,<br/>
&gt; anybody have it work for you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It didn&#39;t work for me either, especially after I gave a big promo for it: &quot;Hey<br/>
everybody, watch THIS.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also had problems with Selo&#39;s Accelerando...I was running with a friend in<br/>
my group and they didn&#39;t get the speed buff!<br/>
<br/>
Anybody spot any other bugged songs after the patch?</div>
