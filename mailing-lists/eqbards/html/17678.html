<div id="ygrps-yiv-210555277">nothing (until RoK) can possibly compare to a duel-wielding Dojorn.  we&#39;ve<br/>
killed everything in this game many times over, and we have never faced<br/>
anything nearly as difficult than when Dojo was duel-wielding.  now that was<br/>
a challenge and a lot of fun (and the first and last time i was in sky, i<br/>
usually never have the time to put in up there).  the only thing that killed<br/>
me faster (sitting and singing is not a good idea when he gets pulled, ok so<br/>
i wasn&#39;t paying attention i got a 1 1/2 year old) than Dojo that night was<br/>
when i got a pull of 12 buggy guardians at phin.  not that Inno&#39;s a<br/>
cakewalk, but i am going with DW Dojo as the toughest =)<br/>
