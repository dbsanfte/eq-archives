&gt; My next thing to try is a series of song that can be drum enhanced.  Say<br/>
&gt; Anthem, Purifying, Curtailing.  This I think could be a good combo against<br/>
&gt; the Kith undead when you have 2 or 3 other melee-er&#39;s in your party.  If you<br/>
&gt; have good MR and sv Disease buffs already, then Chant, Warmth, Curtailing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anthem is singing based.  I have yet to see any evidence that<br/>
Curtailing (and other chant songs) is enhanced by a drum,<br/>
despite being listed as percussion-based.<br/>
<br/>
The combo I usually use when grouped with a melee-heavy group<br/>
is Celerity, Chant, and another song depending on situation.  <br/>
Warmth or Cooling doesn&#39;t make much sense if you&#39;re only<br/>
fighting one mob at a time and that mob is dying quickly -<br/>
although it affects all party members, since a single mob can<br/>
only attack one target at a time, Warmth&#39;s effect is not<br/>
really multiplied by having more party members.  I usually<br/>
drop it for a song which does benefit everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, I have been thinking about varying the songs used throughout the<br/>
&gt; fight.  Open with: Anthem, Purifying, Guardian.  Let the mob get engaged<br/>
&gt; with tanks.  When the mob is getting stunned and bashed and I see<br/>
&gt; interuptions switch to: Chant, Warmth, Curtailing.  When the mob is going<br/>
&gt; down and turns to run: Chains, Anthem, Bellow. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t forget Binding.  I&#39;ve been grouping with rangers and<br/>
druids a lot lately, and dropping Chain in favor of Binding.  <br/>
It is disappointing when they blow their jobs and let a mob<br/>
get away and I can&#39;t do anything about it, but that&#39;s become<br/>
increasingly rare.  Hopefully Pixie Strike will be fixed soon,<br/>
so I can just use that to stop a runner and give the snarer<br/>
time to get his spell off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So that&#39;s 7 songs?  Anthem, Purifying, Guardian, Chant, Warmth, Curtailing,<br/>
&gt; Chains & Bellow.  Nope 8. Hmmm, have to drop one to make room for Clarity.<br/>
&gt; I guess it would be Bellow or Curtailing. Need to keep the one that is<br/>
&gt; resisted less.  Bellow would do 18 dmg in one series of song while<br/>
&gt; Curtailing should do 40? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In theory, yes.  But I&#39;ve found Curtailing Chant to be<br/>
resisted much more than Bellow.  I still use it if lowering MR<br/>
might be advantageous, but so many spells are fire or cold<br/>
based...<br/>
<br/>
It gets worse as you gain levels.  I regularly use Hymn, Chant<br/>
of Battle, Elemental/Purifying, Guardinan, Chain, Binding,<br/>
Celerity, Clarity, Siren&#39;s/Strike, Screech, Lament, Accel,<br/>
Clouding, and Anti-magic.  14 songs, 8 song slots...  I&#39;m<br/>
getting better at swapping songs as I need them (hint: NEVER<br/>
drop an escape song like Accel or Screech - chances are you<br/>
will need it 5 seconds after you drop it).  But it&#39;s still a<br/>
PITA when Anti-magic takes 45 seconds to memorize and you feel<br/>
you *have* to drop it because it&#39;s least likely to be useful<br/>
in the immediate future.  If they reduce the time it takes to<br/>
memorize songs, that will help tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does anyone know why it takes longer for some of our<br/>
songs to become available after memorizing than for some<br/>
spells after a caster has finished memorizing?  I mean we<br/>
already take 10x longer than them to memorize a song, is there<br/>
really any need to make it even longer?  (And yes I know the<br/>
trick about start/stopping another song to make the new one<br/>
immediately available.)<br/>
