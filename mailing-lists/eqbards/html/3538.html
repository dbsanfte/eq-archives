&gt; :All necros I&#39;ve ever grouped with want me to play hymn of restoration and<br/>
&gt; :they claim it greatly helps their mana regen.  All other mana users see no<br/>
&gt; :increase in mana regen no matter what song I play.  Maybe this is a bug<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; :just affects Necros?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Necros have a spell that swaps their hits for mana that acts over time (I<br/>
&gt; think they get this at 24), and so they take damage. When I am in a group<br/>
&gt; with one playing the Hymm, they dont take the damage :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Probably the reason they always want you to play it.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They have two spells that do this, Dark Pact, a level 12 song, and another one<br/>
at higher levels, like 20 or 24.  Singing Hymn for a necro using these songs<br/>
would endear them to you greatly.<br/>
