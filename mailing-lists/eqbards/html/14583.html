 </span></blockquote>	Well, all except PoF.  Compared to the rest of what&#39;s out there<br/>
now, PoF sounds like a cakewalk.  PoH my guild hasn&#39;t tried in about a<br/>
month, but after hearing about what happened over this past weekend, it<br/>
sounds like each patch is making it buggier and buggier.<br/>
	PoS is still rumored to be doable up to Meteor island.  The<br/>
original intent was for people to go Faeries-&gt;Azarack-&gt;Meteor.  As you<br/>
know there are 2 ways to proceed of the Faerie island.  The more expensive<br/>
key takes you to the Sword island but that way was supposed to dead end.<br/>
However, with Levitate and SoW/Selo, people were able to skip Azarack<br/>
island and go directly to meteor island.  Azarack island is reportedly<br/>
possible to clear, although I&#39;ve yet to see any specific report of it<br/>
being done (post-patch. pre-patch people were able to pull azaracks off<br/>
of that island back to faerie island).<br/>
	The dragons did get upgrades, but Nagafen&#39;s was fairly minor and<br/>
straight up 4 melee/2 cleric or 3 melee/2 cleric/1 bard groups my guild<br/>
generally sticks to has continued to work (what do the casters do?  They<br/>
are bound there and nuke, they usually group together, and occasionally<br/>
with a spare healer, but we spend very little time organizing them). Vox<br/>
however, now channels with ungodly precision (through multiple bashes),<br/>
and required a reworking of our strategy to beat her (after 3 failed<br/>
attempts, we finally got the method down).  Nagafen just AE&#39;s a little<br/>
harder, Vox will c heal herself all day long if you give her the chance<br/>
(in addition to her AE upgrade).<br/>
	Losing to a dragon because she c healed herself for the 12 time<br/>
was frustrating.  Without a doubt Vox has surpassed Nagafen as to<br/>
which dragon is more difficult.<br/>
