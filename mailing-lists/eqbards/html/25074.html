<b>Subject:</b> New Video Card and more Ram - the results for me... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103614993">A few weeks ago, I created a topic should I add RAM and on what video card to buy to help my EQ graphics.  I got a variety of replies, all much appreciated.  Using that information, I surfed to find a good deal on a Geforce2 Nvidia chip set video card.  Pricewatch.com helped with prices and Google.com helped to search for hardware reviews.  From there, I decided on a Geforce2 64MB Ultra - last revision of that chip series prior to the Geforce3 that just came out.  Basic difference the Ultra gave on the earlier Pro or GTS was faster memory and higher clock speeds which all equaled higher frame rates.  I got it for $248 (price has come down with the release of Geforce3 cards and will probably come down more, but I didn&#39;t want to wait) and purchased it from 3D Graphics at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sg3d.com/">http://www.sg3d.com/</a> at the recommendation of a friend who had purchased from them before.<br/>
<br/>
Just to remind this list, I have a PIII 450 mhz Pentium with 128 MB RAM.  The video card I had originally was a 16 MB Voodoo 3000.  <br/>
<br/>
First thing I did was install the additional 128 MB of memory bringing my total up to 256 MB.  That cut the time from server select screen to character select screen in half.  I don&#39;t know how much time the rest of you take to get to character select, but my previous average time was around 2 minutes; it now takes about 50 seconds.  I also used to be the last one to arrive when zoning or teleporting - no longer the case.  For the $40 dollars at CompUSA I spent, I am happy with my new memory. <br/>
<br/>
Then I uninstalled my current Voodoo 3000(just follow the directions included in your new card documentation) and installed the my new Ultra card.  No hiccups during install - hardware is simple and drivers then restart - no problem.  So I logon.  Looks nice.  Then I proceed to turn on everything - all particle effects (I never knew our songs looked so neat or spells in general were so cool), clipping plane maxxed, from 800 x 600 to 1024 x 768 (may even go higher - lol), cloud layers, mip mapping, etc.  Restarted to get mip mapping in effect.  Ran to Warsilks Woods, zoned in and Woot!  I ran full tambourine Selos speed in and around all those damn trees and my frame rate was solid and fast.  Can you tell I am happy?  Then I remembered the EQclient had a setting to go from 16 to 32 bit mode.  So I went out, changed that setting and started EQ back up - everything was still great.  I am a happy bard!<br/>
<br/>
Now I know a better CPU/computer can help.  And I will go there someday.  If I stay PIII, I will continue to have 256 MB, but the top speed of a PIII is limited.  If I go P4 at that time, it&#39;s only $40 gone due to that memory (or I can have a 2nd 256 MB computer to have a friend come over and play on or bring up the info on that loot that just dropped).  The nice thing about the video card is it will stay usable through that next CPU/computer.  I know the Geforce3 is out, but this is a solid card that will give me gaming pleasure for at least a few years.<br/>
<br/>
So to all of you that said to get a Geforce2 card, many many thanks.  As for the memory, I got my bang for the buck, but your mileage may vary (some folks on this list didn&#39;t have the same impact to login or zoning that I got) as your system surely does.  BTW, the friends I normally play with all use some variety of Geforce2 cards - GTS or Pro 32MB - and are also getting good gaming results.  I just mention this as the cost of a GTS or Pro can range from $100 to $200 which might fit your budget better and may now be less - we all know how hardware prices drop as the next best thing is released.  Good luck to you all.<br/>

See you in Norrath,<br/>
