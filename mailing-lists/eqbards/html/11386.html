<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066667042">The Butler is (i think) an even /con at 29 or 30.  He&#39;s not real high level,<br/>
but because MM castle resembles grand central station, and attempts to pull<br/>
from the castle often result in &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; it is alot harder to get than<br/>
just killing one mid-level named spawn.<br/>

The Cape is his Common drop too..<br/>
the rare drop is his Fang (which is needed for the Electrum Bladed Wakazishi<br/>
quest)<br/>

&quot;Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit<br/>
adultery. Don&#39;t eat pork.&quot; <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
