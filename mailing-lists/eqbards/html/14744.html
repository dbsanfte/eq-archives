<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034209935"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;  With your knowledge of Lullaby now, would you even consider firing<br/>
&gt;&gt;  up that song in LGuk?  Lullaby was awesome when I used it, oh about<br/>
&gt;&gt;  30 levels ago.  I can&#39;t even keep 3 snakes asleep now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hrm... Interesting. Maybe you have something here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I&#39;m just grumpy that&#39;s all, I loved the tactics I got to employ<br/>
   during my 20s, and even low 30s.<br/>
<br/>
   What happens is our so/so melee and so/so magic don&#39;t strike<br/>
   with the force they used to when we were little.  Verant puts<br/>
   magic resistances on things through the roof to prevent chain<br/>
   IC wizards and makes the mobs melee skills so incredibly high<br/>
   that they can decimate a warrior in a few rounds.  When you <br/>
   toss in a bard, who excels at neither melee nor magic, the<br/>
   bard truly becomes a speed/mana support class.  Since his other<br/>
   magic doesn&#39;t have the effectiveness it used to and his melee<br/>
   coupled with low hp and mediocre ac usually gets him killed<br/>
   in toe to toe combat, Verant ends up just dishing out frustration. <br/>
<br/>
   Speaking from the L50 perspective, you will be playing Victory<br/>
   and Clarit and most likely nothing else.  You may need to Chains<br/>
   something once in a while, you may need to AE fear things.  You<br/>
   won&#39;t be using any other AE songs, including Lullaby.  You won&#39;t be <br/>
   healing anyone anymore.  I use my Solidarity of Vision more than<br/>
   Hymm nowadays.  Dirge, yeah that&#39;s laughable.  Charm, we all<br/>
   know it&#39;s limitation.  Pixie Strike is good once in a while,<br/>
   but not against anything in the Planes (for all purposes).  The L50<br/>
   perspective also isn&#39;t fighting tower froggies or dogs in SolB, it&#39;s <br/>
   in the Planes or against a Dragon, at that point you will feel your<br/>
   true worth. (or lack there of)<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;d like to say there&#39;s something cool at L50 we do, and I&#39;ve<br/>
   racked my mind for hours trying to figure it out.  It&#39;s just<br/>
   so hard to find something other than Victory/Clarit.<br/>
