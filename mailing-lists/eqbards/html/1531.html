I&#39;m a level 12 Bard, and I&#39;m quite happy. I know what my songs do, have<br/>
1 piece of banded, just learnt bellows and have 12 plat saved in the<br/>
bank. I think I&#39;m doing ok. Last night I died in freeport and was in<br/>
faydark asking if any bard could spare a drum for me to use. A level 18<br/>
bard, asked me what I used the drum for...I was a bit confused, but<br/>
thinking this was some test, I responded to run faster with selo&#39;s. She<br/>
then proceeded to argue with me that the drum did nothing to help you<br/>
and that Selo&#39;s was a singing song. After 5 minutes of that she tried<br/>
it, and said &quot;oh wow, you&#39;re right&quot;. I&#39;m just curious, have other people<br/>
met bards like this? I thought from personal experience and reading this<br/>
list that we have some of the most inteligent people, but now I&#39;m<br/>
begining to wonder.<br/>
