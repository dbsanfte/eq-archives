&gt; That&#39;s incorrect if we&#39;re all reading it correctly. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not being based on whether YOU the player are moving. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; being based on whether the mob is moving. So the argument<br/>
&gt; above stands. If you pull with a DOT spell and the mob<br/>
&gt; is running towards you - the DOT isn&#39;t doing any damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And again, long term damage is not as preferred to me as<br/>
&gt; damage done up front. I&#39;d prefer to have a lot of damage<br/>
&gt; in the beginning and end the fight faster rather than<br/>
&gt; the DOT lasting longer.<br/>

game compared to casters.  But that&#39;s another rant...<br/>
