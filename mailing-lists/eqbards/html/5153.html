<div id="ygrps-yiv-997545251"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;There is no death in EverQuest, except psychologically.  And I&#39;m dying, I <br/>
&gt;think. I have loved this list like no other board&#39;ve known in some years.   <br/>
&gt;It is highly intellectual, why I bother you with this damned heavy luggage.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree, of the lists I&#39;ve been on, this is one of the best.  We <br/>
generally get few mindless rants and many insighful opinions compared to the <br/>
ratios on, say, the brewing list.  I personally think it&#39;s because of the <br/>
kind of person that likes to play bards, but I have a slight bias. = )<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;* It runs deep, I think.  There is no wandering.  Everyone stays put.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Roop, you yourself helped me to start really traveling long distances, and I <br/>
am quite grateful you took me on my first trip to Halas (bashing vengeful <br/>
skellies, getting lost in EverFrost - hmmm sounds like a good song title).  <br/>
I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but in the last three days I have traveled <br/>
from Kelethin to Halas to Qeynos (one night), from Qeynos to Halas back to <br/>
Kelethin (another night), and from Kelethin to Freeport (last night).  Every <br/>
night I also made stops in Mistmoore a few times (hoping against hope for <br/>
someone to sell me the dang drum).  Now, this is definitely travel on a <br/>
global scale.  I do it often - heck, I have saved up enough Stormbreaker <br/>
frequent passenger miles to qualify for the Kunark cruise First Class.  <br/>
Everyone does not stay put - many do.  But then, many people do stupid <br/>
things IRL too, and I feel no compulsion to follow them there either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Camping is a problem, everyone says, and we have all these solutions <br/>
&gt;suggested and implemented.  But, mmmm, none will work!  Camping is central <br/>
&gt;to EverQuest!  Everyone camps!  Everywhere!  Been to Unrest?  How else do <br/>
&gt;you survive there but &quot;camp the wall?&quot;  These people aren&#39;t camping for <br/>
&gt;items, but just to play.  Folks camp every dungeon, every outdoor zone. <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been to West Karanas and watched folks pulling lions to the wall.  And <br/>
&gt;it&#39;s the same everywhere else.  Was suggested by a friend, since I so <br/>
&gt;loathed camping, to play the south Karanas.  I am currently &quot;camped&quot; there <br/>
&gt;now, because that&#39;s all anyone does in such an outdoor zone as well!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like camping either.  I do almost all my hunting in outdoor zones, <br/>
and I run around looking for good game.  This may become harder and harder <br/>
at higher levels, but for now I rarely find it difficult to track down <br/>
something around my level to hunt... I have spent a lot of time killing <br/>
kodiaks in the Commonlands, hunting beetles in the Karanas, etc.  This is <br/>
not camping - I literally run until I find something to kill.  Yes, if I am <br/>
in a dangerous zone like North Karana (wayyyy to many grifs wandering around <br/>
to hang out in the middle) I do pull monsters away from the action to a <br/>
place of relative safety, such as Xanuusus&#39; little grove to the North.  But <br/>
that&#39;s just a basic survival tactic.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t like camping?  Avoid dungeons unless you have a good group.  Most <br/>
groups do camp spawn points because it pays off.  I find this to be <br/>
typically boring, just like you do.  Yes, the best loot is found by camping. <br/>
  So I make money by hunting and by performing and by doing people favors <br/>
and I buy the loot I am unwilling to camp.  I have even had fun a few times <br/>
camping, but this is entirely dependant on the group.  People who like to <br/>
screw around, have some fun, make humorous emotes... they can really liven <br/>
up a boring few minutes of waiting.  I try to be such a person when I can, <br/>
and seek out the company of others who actually want to roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
A small digression - warriors can stop to heal and casters can stop to med <br/>
without camping.  Just because you stop to rest for a few minutes does not <br/>
mean you are compelled to stay there until something attacks you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;:My solution:  No natural regeration of wounds, for anyone.  This is not <br/>
&gt;how wounds work, afterall.  A warrior is wounded, make no natural <br/>
&gt;regeneration but increase effect of bandages.  They want healing, find a <br/>
&gt;freaking cleric.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You said you wanted less down-time?  Removing healing would cripple everyone <br/>
except clerics, druids, shamans, and of course us bards.  Now, while I am in <br/>
favor of grouping, how would a level 1 character ever survive if he could <br/>
not heal at all?  Every healer in the world would be CONSTANTLY bombarded <br/>
with people begging for heals, and in fact the healer classes, now very <br/>
overpowered, would see a huge influx.  Hell, I think personally we&#39;d see a <br/>
LOT more bards.  But the point is, this is not at all feasible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No regeneration of mana either.  I know there&#39;s no real-world counter-part, <br/>
&gt;which others would point out THIS IS A GAME anyway in the last argument, <br/>
&gt;but we&#39;re talking logic.  Mana, where does it come from?  The physics of <br/>
&gt;mana? Where is this pure energy coming from?  Apparently Norrath does have <br/>
&gt;gravity, and follows Einstein, so we must assume Energy cannot be just <br/>
&gt;created out of thin air.  It needs a source....  The soul I always assumed, <br/>
&gt;but that can only supply so much.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly why there is a set mana regeneration rate... casters don&#39;t just get <br/>
all their mana at once.  Their soul, or spirit, recharges at a rate based on <br/>
their requisite characteristics.  If a wizard is more intelligent, he has <br/>
greater mental capacity to hold the energy he manipulates... becuase he <br/>
understands and uses this energy intellectually.  A cleric needs wisdom, <br/>
becuase his link to the energy flow of the world is through the depth of his <br/>
understanding of how his god manifests in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Enough with everyone sitting on their duffs.  Burn mana in a battle, run <br/>
&gt;and hope you&#39;re not chased to find a private spot to channel spirit spell <br/>
&gt;to regain all your lost mana.  I want the game to require people to be on <br/>
&gt;THE MOVE and not encourage them to sit around like they&#39;re lazy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather than requiring you move, I&#39;d like the game to reward you more if you <br/>
do.  A difference in approach... I noticed last night that quests now give <br/>
appreciable experience.  Heck, at level 15 I think I saw a rise from <br/>
delivering the mail, and I got about 1/4 bubble for killing the Nybright <br/>
sisters and bringing their necklaces to their besotted father.  So Verant is <br/>
taking some small steps to encourage people to do quests, which pretty much <br/>
always involve moving around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;*  AI lacking.  In a massively multiplayer game it should be better, <br/>
&gt;especially one that is so Player vs. Environment based.   This is AI that <br/>
&gt;was seen in Doom, if that.  The wonder of AI that some folks are impressed <br/>
&gt;by how it acts, when it&#39;s actions are not that complex.  MUST be improved. <br/>
&gt;When I fight this AI, it makes me bored.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, the AI is far from perfect, and it has numerous bugs.  Still, I remember <br/>
recently facing a camp of orcs and being impressed that the oracles sit in <br/>
place and buff up all the cents, that when you attack one they will all mob <br/>
you, that they figure out who is the greatest threat and typically all <br/>
attack it at once... that is what they&#39;re doing, I hope.  I like to believe <br/>
that monsters attack bards preferentially because we are the greatest threat <br/>
to them...  No, they are not as smart as players... well, most players. = )<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;* Tradeskills are lacking.  I have a feeling, given a year, this may work <br/>
&gt;out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  I regret the fact that Verant does not give much support to <br/>
trade skills, and that brewing has been so difficult of late.  I am sure <br/>
that has hit you as hard as it has me... nerfing Ol&#39;Tujim&#39;s, then releasing <br/>
a lot of new recipes onyl to find we can&#39;t make many of them... it&#39;s <br/>
frustrating.  I recently took up baking for kicks, and have found it to be <br/>
pretty fun.  I don&#39;t try to make a profit off trades anymore, I just do it <br/>
for the roleplaying...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;* Death.  There is no death.  I want to die.  I cannot die.  Who were the <br/>
&gt;generation before this, the immortal generation?  Totally ignored by the <br/>
&gt;story of the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have never played any computer game (that I recall) where death was <br/>
&quot;real&quot;.  You either get resurrected with some penalty, or you have a certain <br/>
number of &quot;lives&quot; per game, after which you start over with another set of <br/>
&quot;lives&quot;.  Granted how many times we die in EQ, I am very glad death is not <br/>
permanent... otherwise no one would ever make 10th level. = )<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It is like a moment locked in time, it never changes.  No matter what <br/>
&gt;anyone does, the NPCs will always be locked in that moment, regardless what <br/>
&gt;level the real folk have gotten to.  The &quot;plot&quot; is unchanging.  Join a <br/>
&gt;massively online rolplaying game with an ongoing plot!  There is no ongoing <br/>
&gt;plot. Everything is the same.  It always has been, always will.  McQuaid <br/>
&gt;wants people to appreciate where items come from plotwise, when they buy <br/>
&gt;them or find them.  Yet I&#39;m afraid those subtlties are lost when it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;always that same NPC in that same place, and they never change.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would like to see some sort of plot evolution too... but the point was <br/>
well made elsewhere.  How would any new player ever keep up with massive <br/>
changes?  Now, maybe some day Antonius Bayle will be assassinated, and <br/>
Qeynos will fall under the sway of his evil brother... but even something <br/>
like this would massively screw with newbies in that zone.  I don&#39;t honestly <br/>
know, algorythmically, how to solve the problem of having an evolving plot <br/>
that does not cause all new characters to be at a HUGE disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;* Fix the damned NPC parser.  Using Scott Adams Parser in 1999!!!!  Infocom <br/>
&gt;got it better in 1985!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, the parser is not very sophisticated, granted.  I&#39;d like to see this <br/>
improve as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;* To really encourage roleplaying and a community allow people access to an <br/>
&gt;in-game print press.  Where they can make their own newspapers or books. <br/>
&gt;Allow people to own a deck of cards so they can play kings court and <br/>
&gt;gamble. Make a Roulette Wheel when a PC spins it everyone can watch the <br/>
&gt;text as it clicks along.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there is one option along these lines... the message board in Qeynos.  <br/>
I&#39;d like to see these in every city in Norrath... some of the personals are <br/>
really funny... Mael trol luking for inky pet fur barshin and luvvin...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to see the cards too... though I hear there are cards in game, I <br/>
don&#39;t think we can play.  After all, in the Bristlebane section of the <br/>
manual don&#39;t they warn you against playing King&#39;s Court with a worshipper of <br/>
the god of tricks?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;NAMELY<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;GIVE folks options besides combat!!!  I ask this, because the way combat <br/>
&gt;works in EverQuest bores the living crap out of me.  If it weren&#39;t for the <br/>
&gt;way groups worked, &quot;heroes&quot; sitting around in some safe corner while <br/>
&gt;squires hauled the monsters one at a time for them.... BAH!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The options besides combat are few, but meaningful.  There are quests... I <br/>
know there are a finite number, and many don&#39;t seem that rewarding.  I use <br/>
quests as a means of accomplishing one of my personal goals: I want to make <br/>
all the NPCs in the cities I frequent love me.  I want to have everyone I <br/>
deal with look on me warmly.  So I go off and run small quests and feel like <br/>
I am progressing towards a huge and nigh-impossible goal.<br/>
<br/>
There is exploration... Norrath is pretty big, and given enough time and <br/>
dedication I am sure you can see everything... but given the rare spawns and <br/>
the fact that many things move around, the same zone is not the same each <br/>
time you visit it.  I want to see the Lake Rathe monster!  I want to see the <br/>
named sea serpent in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron!  I want to give Cazic Thule a <br/>
wedgie!  Well, ok, maybe not soon, but someday...<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, there are other PCs.  Most of the really good times I have <br/>
had in EQ have been in player interactions.  Last night a good friend of <br/>
mine named Murtik sent me a /tell to say a friend of his was on a scavenger <br/>
hunt and wanted some edible goo.  He was willing to pay well (15pp for 3 of <br/>
them!!!) so I ran back to Freeport with my friend and master baker Bayrn.  <br/>
We brought the goo and gave it to Guta, and also threw in some cookies and a <br/>
Blackburrow stout, on the house.  We eneded up sitting around the bank for <br/>
about a half hour, just talking and drinking and screwing around.  I can&#39;t <br/>
even say it wasn&#39;t profitable (beyond the very genrous money for the goo)... <br/>
the kindly Guta appreciated my roleplaying and my generosity (hey, he gave <br/>
me a lot of money for something made out of fire beetle eyes and rat ears, I <br/>
was in a good mood) so he gave me some bronze armor.  He was happy, I was <br/>
happy, and it had nothing to do with killing things or camping.<br/>
<br/>
Roop, you were an inspiration to me when I was a young lad in Kelethin.  You <br/>
gave me my first drink of Elven Wine (now I have maxed out my alcohol <br/>
tolerance every level since).  You took me on my first trip from Freeport to <br/>
Halas.  You answered some of my newbie questions about bards.  I am truly <br/>
sorry to hear you are not enjoying the game anymore.  I think you can find <br/>
other things to do in Norrath that you will enjoy more, and sincerely hope <br/>
that some of the suggestions I gave above will be helpful.  If not, I for <br/>
one will miss you.<br/>
<br/>
May your voice always be sweet,<br/>
<br/>
