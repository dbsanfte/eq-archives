<b>Subject:</b> RE: Chain vs. snare <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693339184"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; the argument is that snare lasts a much longer time than chain and is<br/>
&gt; resisted less and broken out of MUCH less.  hey i love chain, but if you<br/>
&gt; have a ranger or druid in the party who is ASSIGNED snaring duty, then let<br/>
&gt; them do it.  if they successfully snare, it is in fact better than chain,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly. <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not just that snare is broken out of MUCH less. It&#39;s the fact<br/>
that snare CANNOT be broken out of prematurely. It lasts a set time<br/>
(unless someone casts cancel magic).</div>
