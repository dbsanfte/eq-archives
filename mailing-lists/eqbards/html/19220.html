I am dismayed at how Verant constantly over-reacts to these things.  I&#39;d say<br/>
that 99 percent of the motivation for doing 7 person groups is just so you<br/>
can play with your friends. (Ok, saving a bit on gates in to planes too -<br/>
but big whoope - they react like some one robbed the bank of Rivervale.)<br/>
When it takes 8 hours of constant fighting to gain one bubble of exp - it<br/>
hardly matter if 6 are doing or 7 are doing.  The bulk of this game is<br/>
intensely boring.  What do they do to address that problem?  Social<br/>
inter-action is the only saving grace.  When they stifle that, it just makes<br/>
things worse.<br/>
<br/>
There is a growing &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality.  Fostered by poor customer<br/>
service, lack of communication: bug reports, email, etc, that never get<br/>
answered, the perception that only the squeeky wheels get greased &quot;bump my<br/>
thread...,&quot; lack of product management &quot;the high level spells are dropping,<br/>
GZ told me so; they are dropping we checked, they are dropping you just<br/>
aren&#39;t finding them; opps, let us know if you get any after this next<br/>
patch....&quot; - That is typical of the programmer mentality who &quot;can&#39;t see the<br/>
logic because of the code&quot; (he cant see any errors until he belives the<br/>
possibility of error exists.)<br/>
<br/>
And then when there are problems in their code, they resort to arbitrary<br/>
&quot;rules&quot; instead of accepting the responsibility of *their errors* and just<br/>
fixing them.  Whether it&#39;s from some &quot;evil&quot; intent on their part or simply<br/>
their own sloppiness or lack of Vision(tm) when it comes to details, they<br/>
turn their design flaws, bugs and other problems into the players problems.<br/>
OMG! You found a way to play with 7 of your fiends instead of only 6????<br/>
OMG!!! The Vision(tm) can only see 6 players!  YOU ARE A DIRTY<br/>
XPLOITER!!!!  - Why go thru the hoopla?  Just fix your code and slide it in<br/>
the next patch.  And what&#39;s worse - they dont see the same priority to fix<br/>
the ones that hurt the players (zones that dont match where you fall thru<br/>
and die - then guides who wont res you.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I juuust have to say, 6+ member groups is an exploit. The use of<br/>
exploits<br/>
&gt; &gt; fundamentally chnges the game experience for yourself and others and<br/>
&gt; brings<br/>
&gt; &gt; on more and more restrictive coding that very often negativly affects<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;freedom&quot;s in the game. </span></blockquote></div>
