<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070961813">Lake of Ill Omen has mobs ranging from 1st level all the way to the low<br/>
40&#39;s.   I would not be surprised if someone could level from 1 to 50 with<br/>
out ever leaving this zone. :)   And for the mid levels teens to high 20&#39;s I<br/>
do not think there is a better zone in the game.    <br/>
<br/>
To find mobs that will be tasty in the low to mid teens you need to go the<br/>
NE shore of the lake.  Going NE from here is a wide valley that leads to<br/>
Cabilis.  As you get closer to Cabilis the mob levels drop, till you get to<br/>
the guards then they get high real fast ;)  There is a nice camp in the<br/>
valley of Forsaken Iksar that would be perfect for your level range (loc<br/>
3250, -1800).  Here is a map<br/>

your way.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Have you tried the Lake of Ill Omen yet?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I peeked in there last night, everything was red and yellow, <br/>
&gt; I decided it<br/>
&gt; would be best to go back after a few levels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  As I ran, with one mob behind me and one still fighting <br/>
&gt; &gt; my husband (who was doing fine with the one) I remembered some <br/>
&gt; &gt; discussions about crowd control and running circles with mobs in <br/>
&gt; &gt; tow.  So I made sure I had my mandolin equipped and made a <br/>
&gt; wide turn <br/>
&gt; &gt; back while healing myself.  Once the battle was done I <br/>
&gt; deposited the <br/>
&gt; &gt; extra mob back where we were originally fighting and we <br/>
&gt; finished him <br/>
&gt; &gt; off.  So much better getting exp on the 2 mobs than zoning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Heal Kiting&quot; rocks :o) I used it all the time on the south <br/>
&gt; shore of Eask<br/>
&gt; karana against Gnoll Reavers. Without SoW it goes like this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Selos, autorun<br/>
&gt; Arm drum to get distance<br/>
&gt; switch to lute<br/>
&gt; alternate selos and hymn<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; keep them close enough to keep chasing you, I *think* their <br/>
&gt; healing rate is<br/>
&gt; the combat one when chasing not the faster non-combat rate.<br/>
