<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882526287">I just recently made the move over from the Rallos Zek (pvp) server to<br/>
the Innoruuk server (non-pvp) and let me tell you, that non-pvp is a lot<br/>
LESS frustration and a lot more fun.  However, there are some instances<br/>
in non-pvp where I wish more than anything that I could just open up on<br/>
some stupid fool who insists on being a jerk.<br/>
<br/>
Enter Naluvin, Dark Elf Necro in North Ro.<br/>
<br/>
Naluvin seems to find it funny to load up notorious good-race hater Dorn<br/>
B&#39;Dynn with weapons and then has his good friend train Dorn out so he<br/>
causes mass havok and destruction against the good races in North Ro.<br/>
Then he will NOT shut up about how cool he is for doing it in OOC.<br/>
<br/>
Time to get creative.<br/>
<br/>
I had noticed earlier that there was a sand giant lurking towards the<br/>
zone to oasis and I thought to myself, &quot;Gee, I have Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
and a Hand Drum, I can outrun a Sand Giant, can he?&quot;  Time to find out.<br/>
Standing at max distance, I twisted the bard lull song (level 8 song,<br/>
forget the name) which was (of course) resisted with Selo&#39;s and the<br/>
chase was on.  Using Selo&#39;s and my drum, I lead the SG right on top of<br/>
Naluvin et Voila... no more witty Dark Elf comments in OOC.<br/>
<br/>
This is also useful for clearing out EXCESSIVE campers of the derv camps<br/>
in NRO and other areas, especially those who get rather vocal when you<br/>
ask if you can have a kill or two.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying this unless you have a drum in hand, and if<br/>
you want to try and turn the sand giant, make sure you give him a wide<br/>
berth.<br/>
<br/>
Please understand, I am not a vindictive person in anyway and I do not<br/>
take part in kill stealing or monster healing or things like that.  I<br/>
just found that this was the limit to my tolerance and something had to<br/>
be done!<br/>
<br/>
Brendel, Innoruuk.</div>
