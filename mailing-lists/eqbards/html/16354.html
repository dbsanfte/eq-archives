<div id="ygrps-yiv-554152990">In 12 hours frenzi dropped 9 sashes, 4 back to back. <br/>
Either the random number generator got a 12 hour case<br/>
of the hiccups or Verant messed up when they changed<br/>
it to lore.  We even had a GM witness 2 of the back to<br/>
back drops (#3 and #4).  I guess it *could* have been<br/>
chance, but anyone else have a similar experience<br/>
since the change?<br/>
<br/>
My guess is emergency patch on Monday. :P<br/>
