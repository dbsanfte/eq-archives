<div id="ygrps-yiv-881524024">Hmm, this might have been funny, but gee, all of the grammatical typos and<br/>
misspellings (I mean, geez, &quot;Captian&quot;!) drove me crazy. Even so, this was<br/>
just a rant of Verant&#39;s nerfs. I was hoping to see the Star Trek crew<br/>
interact with players in Norrath. :-P<br/>

&gt; Thought I&#39;d share this little adventure with you all.<br/>

&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Captian&#39;s Log: Stardate 2134.<br/>
&gt; Recently we have encountered a weak transmission from an <br/>
&gt; unknown source.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; signal is very primitave in its technology and far to weak to <br/>
&gt; decode at<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; time. We are entering the Gamma Quadrant in hopes of tracking down the<br/>
&gt; source of this mysterious transmission. Kirk out.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Mr Spock peers into his scope, green light covers the upper <br/>
&gt; part of his<br/>
&gt; face<br/>
&gt; as waves and lines scramble across numorous monitors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Spock- &quot;Captian, it appears as if this signal is coming from <br/>
&gt; a planet in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Sony system. A small inhospitible planet full of noxious gasses called<br/>
&gt; Verant X.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What sort of intelligent life form could live in such a<br/>
&gt; place? Mr. Sulu, set up the deflector dish array with an ion <br/>
&gt; pulse to help<br/>
&gt; pinpoint the transmission source.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Sulu- &quot;Aye Captian.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lt. Uhura- &quot;Captian, Im getting a much stonger signal now.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Onscreen.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the crew is stunned to see a humanoid life form on the screen <br/>
&gt; smiling at<br/>
&gt; them all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Hiya gang! I am Abashi from Verant X!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;We intercepted your signal. Are you in need of <br/>
&gt; assistance?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;No, silly. The signal you intercepted, as you so <br/>
&gt; quaintly put it,<br/>
&gt; God I just love roleplaying, was actually an enhancement to <br/>
&gt; your ship we<br/>
&gt; were patching to you. You didnt really need to respond.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;I dont understand...enhancement? What have you <br/>
&gt; done to my<br/>
&gt; ship? Shields up! Red alert!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh stop..you dont even know if youll like it or not. We just<br/>
&gt; thought that warp speed was a little too unbalancing. The Klingons and<br/>
&gt; Romulans dont get to go nearly that fast. Trust me, its only <br/>
&gt; a small change<br/>
&gt; to your speed. Maybe 10% to 50%.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Scotty! I want a complete report on all warp <br/>
&gt; drives. I want<br/>
&gt; to know what this fiend has done to us!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Scott- &quot;Aye Captian&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh youre not going to start whining now are you? I <br/>
&gt; just hate it<br/>
&gt; when people whine.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Spock- &quot;Captian, I am not certian, but it would appear <br/>
&gt; that our forward<br/>
&gt; shields have been reduced to almost half their normal power.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What??? You, you Abashi being, why are you <br/>
&gt; doing this? We<br/>
&gt; came to aid you and you attack us?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh gee...you are going to whine now arent you. Well, <br/>
&gt; I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; just have to call you a whiner then. Whiner!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Chekov, arm all photon torpedo bays and fire!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; a moment of scilence...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Chekov?? Where is Mr Chekov? What have you done with<br/>
&gt; him??&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh...well we here at Verant decided that you really <br/>
&gt; didnt need<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt; All he did really was shoot your guns, so we felt for the <br/>
&gt; sake of balance<br/>
&gt; that you could live without the extra crewman.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Scott- &quot;Captian..I dont believe my eyes. We left dock with <br/>
&gt; a full supply<br/>
&gt; of dilithium crystals, and now were down to almost nothing! I dont<br/>
&gt; understand what is going on.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Why are you doing this? Who are you really?!?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;I told you, Im Abashi from Verant X. This is my <br/>
&gt; leader, Brad.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brad- &quot;Hi..I hope you like the new improved Enterprise!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;No I...hey, whered he go??&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh, hes a very busy guy. He doesnt like to mingle <br/>
&gt; with the lesser<br/>
&gt; beings.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Ive had enough of this. Mr Spock, form an away <br/>
&gt; team. Were<br/>
&gt; going down there to meet these _things_ face to face!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Spock- &quot;Aye Captian.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few minutes later in the transporter room...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Spock- &quot;Fascinating, it would appear that half of our crew <br/>
&gt; has vanished<br/>
&gt; without a trace, and the only reasoning for this is the <br/>
&gt; Abashi creatures<br/>
&gt; word &quot;balance&quot;.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;I know Spock...but what does he mean by it? <br/>
&gt; What sort of<br/>
&gt; balance could he mean?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dr McCoy- &quot;Jim, I got here as fast as I could. I had a <br/>
&gt; patient that was<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; half there and I&#39;ll be damaned if all of my tools were missing!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Everyone put on your gasmasks...Alright Mr <br/>
&gt; Scott, beam us<br/>
&gt; down.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A shrill sound spurs the machine into action as Kirk, Spock, <br/>
&gt; McCoy, and<br/>
&gt; three nameless redshirts vanish in a sparkling mist...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Upon materializing onto the Verant X surface loud screams are heard...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Three redshirts- &quot;AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHH!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What happened?!?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Spock- &quot;It would appear that they were instantly killed <br/>
&gt; just as they<br/>
&gt; materialized onto the surface.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Why? Why are we still alive? I see nothing <br/>
&gt; around us that<br/>
&gt; would have done this and left us here.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dr McCoy- &quot;Theyre dead Jim.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The three survivors look around in astonishment at the unforgiving<br/>
&gt; surroundings. Craggy rocks jutt out of the surface of the <br/>
&gt; planet. Various<br/>
&gt; colors of mist and gas swirl around gaping holes. Hissing <br/>
&gt; noises and the<br/>
&gt; bubbling of super heated liquids are the only sounds...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a very primitave intercom loud speaker, Abashi&#39;s voice <br/>
&gt; pierces the men<br/>
&gt; like a rusty nail...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Ok guys, how do you like our newest addition to the planet?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;You just killed three of my men damn you!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh dont start whining again please. Just get over <br/>
&gt; it..its no big<br/>
&gt; deal.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;No big deal? Where are you! Come out here and face us!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ..brief silence...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A sudden whirring noise is heard and McCoys arms vanish from his body,<br/>
&gt; *poof*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;My God man! What are you doing to us!?!?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Were making it better. We know what were doing, you <br/>
&gt; dont. I wont<br/>
&gt; talk to you anymore if you keep insulting me.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dr McCoy- &quot;Damnit! Im a doctor not a circus freak! How can I <br/>
&gt; operate with<br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; arms? My patience will all die!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Well, we took away your arms because you were fixing <br/>
&gt; everyone too<br/>
&gt; easily. BUT...we did give you three extra toes to compensate for it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Three extra toes?? How is this supposed to <br/>
&gt; help him or us?<br/>
&gt; Youve killed off half my crew, youve left my ship crippled <br/>
&gt; and open to any<br/>
&gt; attack! What sort of beings are you??&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;I told you to stop telling us what is best for <br/>
&gt; you...we know all<br/>
&gt; about what is best.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; suddenly Mr Spock starts weeping uncontrollably....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What have you done to Spock?!?!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Nothing...we never touched him. I dont know what <br/>
&gt; youre talking<br/>
&gt; about, infact I think youre just making it all up so we will give you<br/>
&gt; something for free. Your just a whiner!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Im telling you! Hes a Vulcan, he isnt supposed to cry,<br/>
&gt; laugh,<br/>
&gt; or have any emotions damn you!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh wait...youre right. We took out his emotions <br/>
&gt; because we thought<br/>
&gt; that not having any made him too effective under pressure, so now all<br/>
&gt; Vulcans will have emotions...but they are only little ones.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Spock is still weeping like a baby, now curled up on the <br/>
&gt; ground in a<br/>
&gt; fetal position, Dr McCoy is running around bumping into walls because<br/>
&gt; shortly after his arms were taken, his eye lids were made to <br/>
&gt; only stay open<br/>
&gt; for 2 minutes every 24 hours....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Damn you!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;I dont know what youre getting all upset about <br/>
&gt; really. Its all so<br/>
&gt; things will be better from now on. Trust us.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Scott! Beam us up now!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Scott breaks through on the comlink with a scratchy transmission...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Me Scott- &quot;Captian, Im getting an error from the transporter. <br/>
&gt; Its telling<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; it cannot beam you up!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What??? Ok, Abashi...what have you done now??&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;Oh, did I forget to tell you?..you need a redshirt <br/>
&gt; in your party<br/>
&gt; inorder to beam in or out of here.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Captian Kirk- &quot;What?? Our men died as soon as they teleported <br/>
&gt; down! How do<br/>
&gt; you expect us to get out??&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abashi- &quot;I know...its quite the challenge isnt it? Heh heh heh.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr Spock is still on the ground crying, Dr McCoy has gotten <br/>
&gt; his leg stuck<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; some sort of crater, and Captian Kirk, sweating profusely yells....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;DAAAAAAAMMMMMMMNNNNN YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The end?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
