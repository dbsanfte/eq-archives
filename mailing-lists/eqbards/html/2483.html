<div id="ygrps-yiv-572310330">According to the post by J.M. last week regarding the mana use song, i<br/>
believe he said only Charisma is used to calculate our mana, though i don&#39;t<br/>
have the message anymore.  as far as i know, no one really knows how much<br/>
mana the level 43 song uses because it is not available yet.  J.M. said this<br/>
song would be in freeport and qeynos, and i have not seen it in freeport<br/>
yet.  if it&#39;s available please let me know, i wanna try it out.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, with the few remaining points I have, where do you <br/>
&gt; guys and gals<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggest I put them? Dexterity or agility? I hear dexterity <br/>
&gt; is important<br/>
&gt; &gt; for playing songs. How large an effect does this have? Does <br/>
&gt; it actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; increase the effectiveness of the song or does it just decrease how<br/>
&gt; &gt; frequently you miss a note?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dexterity AND Charisma determine how much mana you have. Only <br/>
&gt; one song at the<br/>
&gt; moment uses mana, so this isnt actually such a big deal. If I <br/>
&gt; had to choose<br/>
&gt; between Agi and Dex, I&#39;d choose Dex. Dexterity supposedly <br/>
&gt; factors in how well<br/>
&gt; you hit. Agility factors in how well you avoid being hit. <br/>
&gt; Usually in a group,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll have a tank. Trust me, bards cant tank at higher <br/>
&gt; levels. However, you<br/>
&gt; will be swinging your weapon, while someone else is taking <br/>
&gt; the damage. So<br/>
&gt; it&#39;d be more beneficial if you missed less often, than if you <br/>
&gt; had higher Agi<br/>
&gt; for those times you find yourself tanking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lastly, for any mid to high level bards out there wearing mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt; steelplate, how much strength do you recommend? I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want to be in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; constant war against weight. I&#39;m thinking 100 strength to <br/>
&gt; be safe, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was thinking less might do (and allow me to put more into <br/>
&gt; dexterity and<br/>
&gt; &gt; agility).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have full plate. A mixture of some rubicite, and <br/>
&gt; store-bought steel and<br/>
&gt; other miscellaneous magic items. My weight with weapons (light weight<br/>
&gt; weapons, mind you), food, and instruments comes to about 66. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d suggest you<br/>
&gt; have a base strength of 90 minimum and put extra points into <br/>
&gt; charisma and<br/>
&gt; dexterity. Later on, you&#39;ll get elf-hide gloves and a troll-hide belt.<br/>
&gt; Combined, these items will raise str, sta, agi, and dex each by 5.<br/>
&gt; Also I try to get my strength up as much as possible. I have <br/>
&gt; a bunch of +str<br/>
&gt; items which have raised it from my base of 85 to 116. I get <br/>
&gt; extra dmg bonuses<br/>
&gt; which is really cool, especially with Anthem playing during battle.<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>
