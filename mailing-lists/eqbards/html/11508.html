<div id="ygrps-yiv-116112659">same here.  it&#39;s actually ac12 with 20CR/FR.  very nice stats i think,<br/>
especially for no graphic and not plate like the SSB.  i couldn&#39;t bear the<br/>
exe hood graphic either, though plate is exponentially worse.<br/>
<br/>
i have sold a SSB for 500pp i believe, i have seen them as high as 800pp (a<br/>
long time ago) and 400pp is just about average now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I only wear the Crown of Frogluk <br/>
&gt; Kings because<br/>
&gt; I refuse to wear a plate helm, being a female wood elf, and the Crown<br/>
&gt; has no Graphic. I wore an Exectuioner&#39;s Hood before the Crown, and it<br/>
&gt; also has very nice stats and is relatively easy to get. For a bard, I<br/>
&gt; think I&#39;d prefer the Hood, but I think for the price you paid for the<br/>
&gt; barbute, that was a real win, and certainly a great upgrade <br/>
&gt; from steel. </span></blockquote></div>
