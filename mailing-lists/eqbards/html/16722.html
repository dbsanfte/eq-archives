<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639730184">Over on CoN the question was raised of high level Mobs that people dream of<br/>
killing was raised. Without hesitation I of course said all Brownies on<br/>
Quellious&#39; Green Norrath. Dead, dead dead. Then run through with pins and<br/>
stuck to every tree in Lesser Faydark as a festive decoration. *twitch*&quot;<br/>

<br/>
However, number two was Dvinn:<br/>
<br/>
Dvinn. But it&#39;s not about dying really, in two or three levels he shall be<br/>
my pet and he shall dance for me. He will take a tour of the castle killing<br/>
the Orcs with whom he conspires, then, after screenshots with him in<br/>
embarassing situations, I shall fear then chain him and kill him slowly with<br/>
sickly yellow DoTs.*twitch, blink blink*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ummm...until what level will I have to wait to make this fantasy a reality?<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Volenteer Renlor, the Walmart Greeter of Highpass was next. (Not that<br/>
he is high level, but I can&#39;t lose any more faction in Highpass) &quot;No Renlor&quot;<br/>
I shall tell him as he dies, &quot;I do NOT want help with this gnoll&quot;.*twitch,<br/>
twitch, spasm*</div>
