<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162238230">Well, reading what you wrote, we&#39;re probably not as different as you might think.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the chant series myself, but the tradeoff is that we aren&#39;t singing any party buff or MOB<br/>
debuff songs while using it, so whether or not it&#39;s a good idea is situational.  I do use them.  I don&#39;t<br/>
use them on large group efforts since I can&#39;t get high enough on the hate list to avoid the DOT bug (no,<br/>
it&#39;s not fixed).<br/>
<br/>
I do think that Bards are really very useful, and one of the more powerful classes.  I even agree with you<br/>
that we&#39;re useful in the &quot;standard group&quot; mix that so many fall into.  The problem is whether or not there<br/>
is room for us, and it&#39;s my experience that people don&#39;t build groups around Bards the way they build<br/>
groups around other character types; they fit Bards in if it&#39;s convenient.  Which lessens our grouping<br/>
opportunities quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it is training.  There aren&#39;t enough Bards (and certainly not enough good ones) for people to know<br/>
what we&#39;re capable of.  So I have to really argue with people to attempt things sometimes.  For example,<br/>
it took a lot of work to convince people to try anything other than zone-in in Sebilis without an<br/>
Enchanter.  I&#39;ve done 5 other areas now, but it&#39;s always a big struggle to convince people that it&#39;s worth<br/>
the risk.<br/>
<br/>
Pulling is another thing.  Lament is a great tool, but most people don&#39;t even know we have it, and<br/>
certainly don&#39;t get how it works.  So I get in groups that have the level 52 warrior shoot things with an<br/>
arrow to pull, which will be definition be no better than, and probably worse than, letting me Lament<br/>
pull.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s frustrating to have to constantly educate people at the mid-50s level.  And the fact that so many<br/>
aren&#39;t educated makes their perception of Bards worse than the reality, and that perception makes it<br/>
harder for us to group.<br/>
<br/>
About good bards:  I was grouped with a mid-50s ranger the other night, and he was amazed that I was<br/>
twisting songs.  Not twisting 4 (which I was doing), just twisting at all.  He&#39;d never seen it.  And he&#39;d<br/>
played with Bards.  And he&#39;s level 55, for Pete&#39;s sake.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 1.  The Bard&#39;s offense sucks.  He adds less offense than anything other<br/>
&gt; than, perhaps, a Cleric.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.  During combat, the Bard can sing offensively oriented songs which add<br/>
&gt; to the capabilities of the melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; members of his party, or counter the abilities of the MOB, which dereases<br/>
&gt; mana and decreases risk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or, he can use instrument and Chants.  With good instruments, significant<br/>
&gt; damage - like &gt;1800 per minute. So, bard&#39;s add 1200 to 1500 with store<br/>
&gt; drums.  Get MM or Tamborine or Selo&#39;s and you do more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3.  During downtime, the Bard can sing downtime-reducing songs.  This<br/>
&gt; decreases downtime risk and<br/>
&gt; &gt; decreases downtime itself.  This allows the party to pull stuff faster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, mana song in downtime keeps clerics and hybrids at full potential.<br/>
&gt; Your ench has Theft of Thought and with that and his own clarity buff he<br/>
&gt; should stay above 66% mana if not more.  Kinda all depends on where you<br/>
&gt; fight and training your group to let you keep your &quot;mana mob&quot; alive.  But<br/>
&gt; mana for ench is not a problem normally.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A cleric with an ench and a bard in the group can pretty much nuke to his<br/>
&gt; heart is content and that is 516 to 1032 more dmg per mob. The cleric will<br/>
&gt; ask the bard to play mana song in combat if things are falling behind mana<br/>
&gt; wise.  I dont find that an un-reasonable request at all. Let me also say<br/>
&gt; that I actively play 54 bard, 53 cleric and 51 enchanter and have been in<br/>
&gt; groups with other bards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The problem is &quot;the situation&quot;.  There are 7 things that high-level Kunark<br/>
&gt; parties need:  1) crowd<br/>
&gt; &gt; control, 2) primary healer, 3) a tank, 4) a puller, 5) a group gater<br/>
&gt; (sometimes), 6) a lockpicker<br/>
&gt; &gt; (sometimes), 7) secondary healer (sometimes).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our enchanters (mine too) don&#39;t go into dungeon&#39;s without clerics (and<br/>
&gt; clerics that they can trust).  Next is a plate class tank.  We use mez &<br/>
&gt; cheal tactics.  Conservation of mana is accomplished by having a tank with<br/>
&gt; high hps be the focus of the mobs attention. Next on the list is a &quot;snare&quot;<br/>
&gt; person.  I hate that role as a bard.  Our snares suck - we have to re-stick<br/>
&gt; it.  I pretty much have to drop everything else to maintain the snare - much<br/>
&gt; rather have a ranger, druid, sk, necro or wizard doing the snares.  But then<br/>
&gt; - you pretty much have the requirements for a decent exp group.  Lockpick,<br/>
&gt; evac for certain spots but you certainly have other choices.  Secondary<br/>
&gt; healer? Only if you would lose a cleric for some odd reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The bard can&#39;t do any of these things other than limited crowd control, or<br/>
&gt; pulling (which doesn&#39;t allow him to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play the downtime reducing role), which means that he doesn&#39;t satisfy any<br/>
&gt; of the core requirements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A bard can&#39;t be the plate class meat-shield tank that gets chealed while<br/>
&gt; taunting the mobs as they are BS&#39;d to death.  Thats a Warriors job.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A bard cant be primary healer - that&#39;s a cleric&#39;s job.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He can be the snare person - but if he;s like me - its not much fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He can do good additional damage with DoT&#39;s (chants) and he can keep mana<br/>
&gt; maxxed and actually above provide more to allow others to do more than<br/>
&gt; usual.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, the specialtys are needed for certain places - but that is why they are<br/>
&gt; specialties - I wish bards could pick more doors in Kunark.  I have &quot;heard&quot;<br/>
&gt; that Scars of V. will have places for &quot;sense traps&quot; and &quot;disarm traps&quot; to be<br/>
&gt; used. Will they let  us bards do this? Let&#39;s hope.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any person who spends a lot of time in /gu telling everyone how much their<br/>
&gt; class sucks will soon discover that the guild is if not believing them - at<br/>
&gt; least totally sick of hearing them whine and they wont be getting groups.<br/>
&gt; It wont be a matter of class balance, but it will be how they play their<br/>
&gt; char - ie constant whining.  Yes, I think bards need some fixing up and<br/>
&gt; perhaps VI has done this in this patch - but the constant whining about how<br/>
&gt; badly bard&#39;s suck (whether they do or not) hurts more than anything towards<br/>
&gt; getting a group.<br/>
