&gt; It&#39;s just not that simple.  No Drop solves absolutely nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No level 50 wizard camps lambent armor drops to sell these items to<br/>
bards.  Before you had everyone and their mom selling rubi armor,<br/>
even those that could not use it had it for sale.  The no drop means if<br/>
you do loot, you have to complete the quest, which means leave this<br/>
spawn, while i move in and get the item myself.  or you just have to <br/>
loot and destroy the quest items until the bard hands over money.<br/>
I don&#39;t think many of us are so rude to do #2, and #1 doesn&#39;t work,<br/>
Thus my bard is able to travel around, get his quest items camp-free<br/>
and enjoy his items.  I repeat, No one is off selling lambent armor<br/>
parts for any kind of price at all, and people selling the lambent<br/>
armor can&#39;t sell it for the obscene prices that items like gator legs<br/>
go for simply because the quest/no drop quest item system works!<br/>
<br/>
It does not stop the level 50 from twinking his newbie, it does stop<br/>
the &quot;rubicite/jboots is always camped&quot; complaints that we see.  It<br/>
worked for what Verant wanted it to do.<br/>
