<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487735724">At level 14, fighting a casting mob, am I better off to use a  hand drum<br/>
with Elemental Rhythms, or sing it while slashing away with a gnoll hide<br/>
lariat?<br/>
<br/>
I tried both but wasn&#39;t high enough on the hate list to judge the<br/>
effectiveness myself and the tank didn&#39;t pay enough attention to whether<br/>
spells were hitting him or not.<br/>
<br/>
The group was me, rogue-tank, shaman, two wizards, & a cleric.  The casting<br/>
mobs were orc shamans in Oasis.  I was twisting ER, CoB, and Bellow against<br/>
these guys.  Non casting mobs I was twisting CoB, Bellow, & either another<br/>
Bellow or Hymn (rogues can&#39;t taunt, so we all ending up taking *some*<br/>
damage).  It was only when the casting mobs got pulled that I tried using<br/>
instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
