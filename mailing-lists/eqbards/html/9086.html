<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289373215">Sure other classes may get a random spell thrown at them occassionally, but<br/>
I&#39;m willing to bet your cleric has never had a MOB leave it&#39;s fight, run<br/>
across the battlefield and start beating on him when he was just standing by<br/>
observing.   <br/>
As if it stopped there. I&#39;ve not only had them do this, but they became so<br/>
locked on that they never switched off me until they died despite being<br/>
smacked, shot, burned, frozen, bent, folded, stapled, and mutilated by the<br/>
group they were originally fighting.  <br/>
<br/>
This is bard hate.  <br/>
<br/>
No other class has to endure this, or the the fact that merely casting<br/>
(singing) in the general vicinity of a fight may get you a faction hit<br/>
whether you want it or not.  Neither my Druid, nor my Paladin, nor my<br/>
Enchanter, nor my Shaman has EVER had a MOB leave its fight or ignore those<br/>
doing damage to it in favor of targetting them.  Especially not while I was<br/>
standing around not involved in their fight.  Occassionally I might get hit<br/>
with a spell from a MOB in another fight, but they would immediately return<br/>
to their combat.  NEVER, NEVER did they turn their backs on their attackers<br/>
and run over to beat on me without provocation EXCEPT when playing my bard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This too is bard hate.<br/>

&gt; But what explains this?<br/>
&gt; Sitting in Crushbone, not singing, not fighting, just watching, &quot;An orc<br/>
&gt; oracle begins to cast a spell.  You feel drowsy.&quot;<br/>
&gt; In the middle of combat with a whole other party!  That&#39;s Bard Hate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My Cleric was meditating while another group was fighting in Unrest.  Out<br/>
of nowhere, the mob (forget what it was) cast a spell on me then continued<br/>
to fight the other party.  My group or I had did nothing to draw the mob.<br/>
Was this Bard Hate too?  NO.<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, mobs have some randomness in who they attack.  Every<br/>
class will experience this.  I don&#39;t think Bards are more heavily weighted<br/>
than all other class.  Unfortunately Bards also draw mobs with their songs<br/>
that pulse every 6 seconds.  So they get both the random mobs and the<br/>
song-drawn mobs.  This is why it seems so much worse for Bards than any<br/>
other characters.<br/>
