<div id="ygrps-yiv-472124038">Our guild has over 30 members, but all but two are casual players.  Our<br/>
schedules just don&#39;t allow us to play more than twice a week on average,<br/>
once for 2 hours maybe and once for 3-4.  Getting those times to mesh is<br/>
generally fairly tough.  As a bard I&#39;ve found that grouping with strangers =<br/>
instant multiple deaths 90% of the time.  I haven&#39;t been in a group other<br/>
than guildmates that has worked out for 4 levels now.  That&#39;s since October.<br/>
I tried one week before last and died on the first pull.  That&#39;s my biggest<br/>
complaint about bards.  If a pull goes bad we are nearly always the one that<br/>
pays for it which tells me that our skills do not balance out with the<br/>
dangers we face as well as any other class.  Even with reduced taunt from<br/>
our songs the only time mobs stop hitting me even now is when either our<br/>
enchanter uses multiple mega taunt spells or one the ranger actually gets a<br/>
taunt to turn it (very rare).<br/>

&gt; The problem I was addressing mainly was that due to the limitations I play<br/>
&gt; under as a casual player, I can only play long enough to see some named<br/>
&gt; spawns spawn twice about once every two weeks.  If the spawn is more than<br/>
45<br/>
&gt; minutes apart, letting my group share any night at every other spawn means<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in luck then, as the longest regular respawn time I&#39;ve<br/>
seen (excluding the multi-hour and multi-day respawns) is only<br/>
40 minutes.  In fact, most of the ones your level are like<br/>
15-20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; able to fight the spawn once, rarely twice.  This pretty much locks us out<br/>
&gt; of any chance of ever getting rare drops.  We can only play with enough of<br/>
&gt; us to do tough camps once every other week pretty much anyhow.  Giving us<br/>
&gt; the ability to get a chance at the spawn every nite while reducing our<br/>
&gt; ability to camp the spawn longer gains us exactly zero access, while<br/>
&gt; reducing the access we did have.  None of my regular groupmates plays more<br/>
&gt; than 4 times a week and those are the ones who can solo easily.  Once a<br/>
week<br/>
&gt; is the most often we get more than three guildmembers together.  From our<br/>
&gt; experience the new rules will not increase our access as casual players,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; exactly the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like your problem is you don&#39;t know enough people<br/>
you&#39;re willing to group with for a shot at one of these named<br/>
mobs.  The access is there, you&#39;re just unwilling to take<br/>
advantage of it because of whom you choose to group with.  <br/>
It&#39;s a variant of the problem solo players complain about -<br/>
that they can&#39;t really kill most of the named spawns solo<br/>
unless it&#39;s way green to them.  This is a grouping game.  If<br/>
your grouping is sub-par, you&#39;re going to miss out no matter<br/>
the rules.<br/>
