<div id="ygrps-yiv-661998687">While you&#39;re at it test Chords of Cessations&#39;s DoT.  I&#39;m interested in what<br/>
it does but the minute I log in my guild whisks my away to one camp or<br/>
another.  I haven&#39;t been in town for days.<br/>
<br/>
Also I wanted to say I felt the same thing that you did when I get<br/>
Berserker.  Berserker didn&#39;t seem as fast as Celerity.  I swapped<br/>
Celerity/Chant in the other night for a rogue who wanted to play with procs<br/>
and it definitely felt a bit faster than Bersker.  But with the addition of<br/>
Niv&#39;s I find it hard to justify Celerity/Chant now except in special<br/>
circumstances.  However, I&#39;ve *never* had another player notice the<br/>
difference, so it&#39;s only big to us.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Most of our songs are 2 pulses.  Fire up Hymn and immediately<br/>
&gt; turn it off, and your hp will increment only twice.  The 3<br/>
&gt; pulse notion came about because  depending on when your song<br/>
&gt; hits the server in its heartbeat cycle, it can &quot;last&quot; anywhere<br/>
&gt; from 2.00 to 2.99 pulses (and the time to start up the song<br/>
&gt; &quot;adds&quot; a half pulse subjectively).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DoTs seem to be 3 pulses.  I&#39;ve been meaning to test them with<br/>
&gt; Rokenn in the arena.  If they are indeed 3 pulse songs, then<br/>
&gt; you have a bit more flexibility when weaving them.<br/>
