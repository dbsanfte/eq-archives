<b>Subject:</b> Burynai bundt cake quest <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219859805">This has been a topic on my guild mailing list lately.  Some druid and<br/>
rangers in the guild have been foraging in Field of Bone recently based on a<br/>
rumor that the bundt cake could be foraged there.  So far they have come up<br/>
empty.  Since no one has posted on either eqbards or the Concert Hall that<br/>
they have completed this quest, then either the quest is broken and can&#39;t be<br/>
completed or we aren&#39;t looking in the right place.  Based on Verant&#39;s track<br/>
record with quests, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this quest is broken.  If it<br/>
isn&#39;t broken, then not enough clues have been found for anyone to logically<br/>
figure it out for themselves.  For the sake of discussion, lets assume the<br/>
quest isn&#39;t broken.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a strong feeling that the answer to this quest may be very similar to<br/>
some quests that can be found in Dalnir and Kaesora. Last night after my<br/>
guild&#39;s Kaesora raid I went to Allakhazam&#39;s spoiler site to get some info on<br/>
Dalnir(for finding the ancient coin).  Found out that there are a couple of<br/>
quests you can do within the dungeon.  Certain mobs drop No Drop quest<br/>
components.  Some mobs also drop scroll pieces which give you clues about<br/>
the quest.  Find all the quest components and combine them in the forge<br/>
located somewhere in Dalnir and you get a magic item as the reward.  The<br/>
fallen crypt raider in Kaesora also drops an illegible scroll as well as a<br/>
journal (which I couldn&#39;t read).  Several times during the raid mobs dropped<br/>
a No Drop pestle which no one had any idea what they were used for.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were other No Drop items in Kaesora that can<br/>
be combined somewhere in the dungeon to create a magic item similar to the<br/>
one in Dalnir.  Its quite possible the bundt cake quest is similar to the<br/>
quests in Dalnir in that the solution is found somewhere within a dungeon.  <br/>
<br/>
I have another strong feeling that the reason that no one has solved the<br/>
burynai bundt cake quest is that they aren&#39;t looking in the right place.<br/>
Lets assume that the answer lies somewhere in Droga (there is an oven in<br/>
there).  I&#39;ve never been there but I think its safe to assume that the<br/>
dungeon is under utilized(just like Kaesora and Nurga).  Since E&#39;ci is an<br/>
older server, the majority of the players are 40+ level.  They are hanging<br/>
out in areas where they can get EXP points, not dungeons where everything is<br/>
green to them.  So my guess is that until someone spends a lot of time in<br/>
Droga (assuming that is where you must complete the quest), its gonna be<br/>
awhile before this quest gets completed.<br/>
<br/>
So here are some questions that need to get answered:<br/>
1)  Has anyone found a recipe scroll/book for the bundt cake?<br/>
2)  Has anyone foraged an item which logically may be part of the quest?  If<br/>
so what is the item&#39;s name and what zone was in foraged in?<br/>
3)  Has anyone looted anything from a burynai that may be a quest component?<br/>
I&#39;ve looted normal burynai mobs in Frontier Mtns but so far all they have<br/>
dropped is money.  There are named burynai in Frontier Mtns which may drop a<br/>
component for this quest but I&#39;ve never looted one before.  <br/>
4)  Has anyone gotten the quest NPCs to give out any additional clues other<br/>
than the standard quest text?<br/>
5)  Do you have to have Baking skill to complete the quest?<br/>
6)  Any other questions someone else can think of.<br/>
