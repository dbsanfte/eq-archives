 </span></blockquote>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that bards really don&#39;t have a good<br/>
sense of how fast they run.  A L32 bard guildmate of mine ran<br/>
past me with a MM drum, and my first thought was &quot;Whoa, that&#39;s<br/>
fast.&quot;  Same when I saw a druid cast SoC and run off.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to meet some friends at a shadowmen site, when one<br/>
of them (KOS) ran into the (huge) aggro radius.  I got to see<br/>
the shadowmen (well, the stuff they were holding :) fly off in<br/>
the direction of my friends.  It is fast, but it is not<br/>
infinite.  I had enough time to warn them, and they had time<br/>
to prepare (too bad they didn&#39;t use it :).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been playing around with levitate when it happened so I<br/>
didn&#39;t have Accelerando up or I would&#39;ve tried chasing them.<br/>
