<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353275526">If you go check the shaman message board for the quest they recently<br/>
discovered for canabalize 2 I think you may get an idea of just how<br/>
rediculous the answer is liable to be. The pestle is for that quest,<br/>
btw. It&#39;s probably going to be a matter of finding which KOS to all mob<br/>
you are going to need to charm to hand in the appropriate components to,<br/>
to get the cake. They&#39;ve used this trick twice now so it&#39;s really not<br/>
out of the question that they&#39;ve used it more than that. The shaman are<br/>
a bit annoyed at the risk vs reward for their L39 spell so if the helm<br/>
is nice expect it to be rediculous.<br/>

&gt; I have a strong feeling that the answer to this quest may be very similar to<br/>
&gt; some quests that can be found in Dalnir and Kaesora. Last night after my<br/>
&gt; guild&#39;s Kaesora raid I went to Allakhazam&#39;s spoiler site to get some info on<br/>
&gt; Dalnir(for finding the ancient coin).  Found out that there are a couple of<br/>
&gt; quests you can do within the dungeon.  Certain mobs drop No Drop quest<br/>
&gt; components.  Some mobs also drop scroll pieces which give you clues about<br/>
&gt; the quest.  Find all the quest components and combine them in the forge<br/>
&gt; located somewhere in Dalnir and you get a magic item as the reward.  The<br/>
&gt; fallen crypt raider in Kaesora also drops an illegible scroll as well as a<br/>
&gt; journal (which I couldn&#39;t read).  Several times during the raid mobs dropped<br/>
&gt; a No Drop pestle which no one had any idea what they were used for.  I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were other No Drop items in Kaesora that can<br/>
&gt; be combined somewhere in the dungeon to create a magic item similar to the<br/>
&gt; one in Dalnir.  Its quite possible the bundt cake quest is similar to the<br/>
&gt; quests in Dalnir in that the solution is found somewhere within a dungeon.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have another strong feeling that the reason that no one has solved the<br/>
&gt; burynai bundt cake quest is that they aren&#39;t looking in the right place.<br/>
&gt; Lets assume that the answer lies somewhere in Droga (there is an oven in<br/>
&gt; there).  I&#39;ve never been there but I think its safe to assume that the<br/>
&gt; dungeon is under utilized(just like Kaesora and Nurga).  Since E&#39;ci is an<br/>
&gt; older server, the majority of the players are 40+ level.  They are hanging<br/>
&gt; out in areas where they can get EXP points, not dungeons where everything is<br/>
&gt; green to them.  So my guess is that until someone spends a lot of time in<br/>
&gt; Droga (assuming that is where you must complete the quest), its gonna be<br/>
&gt; awhile before this quest gets completed.<br/>
