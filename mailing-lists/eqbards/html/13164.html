<b>Subject:</b> Are we Hybrids? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-294533727"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I fail to see how we can be classed as Hybrids at all, and feel that the<br/>

<br/>
As much as I would love a bind song, it would go against how every song works.<br/>
 Our songs are not permanent effects.  They are not even long lasting.  In<br/>
general, the effects we create only last for a few seconds after we stop<br/>
singing or playing our song.  Binding is very different: it is a permanent<br/>
change to the environment.<br/>
<br/>
The one exception to this is the charismatic catillion, which lasts until we<br/>
zone...and that somehow makes sense.  I picture myself going into town and<br/>
singing to a merchant who loves the ballads of my adventures and tells all her<br/>
friends about me.  As soon as I leave town they forget all about Sarsa and<br/>
listen to the next Bard who comes in.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a bind song it could only keep us bound for as long as we sang<br/>
it.  Not practical.  Even if we did get a permanent bind, could you imagine<br/>
how loud the other melees would scream?  If all 7 melee types died in Guk and<br/>
died in Freeport at the same time and started running back, who would arrive<br/>
first without outside aid?  The bards of course!  We already have the<br/>
advantage over all other melee classes in this area.<br/>
<br/>
If anything, it makes more sense for all hybrids EXCEPT Bards to be able to<br/>
bind.<br/>
