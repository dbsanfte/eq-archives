<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625168198">Good plan John.  I&#39;ve found Baelish from Caster&#39;s Realm is usually able to<br/>
get attention on matters where no amount of screaming from others has any<br/>
effect.  I never got any reply from GZ on my earlier posts and emails that<br/>
Lullaby was not working until I elicited Baelish&#39;s assistance.  The day<br/>
after Baelish responded that he would ask the question for me, GZ sent<br/>
emails to everyone who had sent him emails about lullaby problems and a<br/>
second one to me asking for more info on the data I had sent him 4+ weeks<br/>
previously.<br/>

&gt; Note: Abashi is perfectly aware of the practice of bumping. He has<br/>
mentioned<br/>
&gt; it before. He does not put more emphasis on things bumped than other<br/>
things.<br/>
&gt; Because he knows that is artificial to get it to the top of the list,<br/>
&gt; NOT more discussion/information.<br/>
<br/>
If you read the testing and data I got, you&#39;ll see I put<br/>
enough work in it that there is no room for discussion.  It is<br/>
not subjective, it is completely objective, with I&#39;d guess<br/>
about 99.99% certainty, proof that Lullaby is indeed broken.  <br/>
When I put it together, I wanted it to be irrefutable and took<br/>
steps to cover ever contingency I could think of (which is why<br/>
there&#39;s no room for discussion - I&#39;ve already addresses any<br/>
issues anyone may want to discuss :).  There are other posts<br/>
with fair to good statistical data, but there&#39;s lots of<br/>
discussion on them beccause the results are not as clear.  <br/>
Not trying to sound egotistical, but it is the most<br/>
technically and statistically solid post I&#39;ve ever seen on<br/>
that board.  If Verant wants to ignore it... well, I would<br/>
interpret that as a statement from Verant that they don&#39;t care<br/>
about a bug that renders one of a class&#39; primary abilities<br/>
(crowd control) virtually useless.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m waiting for the patch and until Thursday (1 business week)<br/>
for a reply.  If there is none, I&#39;ll email it to the folks at<br/>
castersrealm to see if they can elicit a response.<br/>
