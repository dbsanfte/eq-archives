<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185217942">Well, the weekend is over, and I spend almost all of it in the Plane of<br/>
Sky.  This is basically what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Day 1: Cleared Fairies and Azaracks, camped on Gorgalask<br/>
<br/>
Day 2: Cleared Gorgalask and Pegasus, camped on Pegasus<br/>
<br/>
Day 3: Recleared Pegasus, realized it was already 11PM, did some poking<br/>
around on Spirocs and jumped off, leaving a necro and cleric on pegasus<br/>
<br/>
Some spoilers for how we handled pegasus/griffons below, as well as some<br/>
basic info on spirocs.<br/>
<br/>
Of Griffons and Pegasus, Griffons are noticibly easier.  Both of them<br/>
split into two sub 55 red cons&#39;s (tested w/ Bard Charm) which, when<br/>
killed, each spawn another &gt; 55 cons.<br/>
<br/>
The method we use to kill them is fairly simple.  1 group consisting of 2<br/>
warriors, 2 clerics, and 2 enchanters, and 4 melee/cleric groups, with<br/>
pure casters not really helping except with pets.  That 1 group is known<br/>
as the &quot;mez group&quot;.  We kill the first one, and when it splits into 2,<br/>
everyone attacks the same target except for the mez group.  The 2 warriors<br/>
from the mez group attack the other target, tanking it while the clerics<br/>
heal and the enchanters chain cast rune 3.  The bards keep trying to charm<br/>
the first split to give the mez group 18 second breathers.  Meanwhile,<br/>
everyone else kills the other one and the subsequent triggered spawn.<br/>
Finally, everyone kills the remaining spawn that the mez group has been<br/>
tanking the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
Keeper of Souls (the boss) is on par with Innoruuk in difficulty, so not<br/>
too bad.<br/>
<br/>
Spirocs.  All I will say about spirocs is you don&#39;t have to combat drop<br/>
in.  It&#39;s perfectly safe to run around most of the island.  The agro range<br/>
on the spirocs is like 0.1 ft, with the exception of The Spiroc Guardian<br/>
and The Spiroc Lord.  Despite them consing scowls, they don&#39;t generally<br/>
attack unless you run right up to a roost.<br/>
<br/>
We got a ton of drops, just nothing for clerics or bards :(.<br/>
