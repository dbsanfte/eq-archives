<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023730566">This is a &quot;standard&quot; response line when any one single item is handed to<br/>
certain quest NPC&#39;s.  I see the same thing doing crafted armor quests (don&#39;t<br/>
ask).  I think its some lazy generic programming - ie give error messages<br/>
until all items are given then if item count = whatever, give good item.<br/>
You probably got the message 3 times:<br/>
<br/>
once for the lambent gem<br/>
again for the lute<br/>
again for the carpace.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
p.s. you see a lot of wierd stuff  in eq - poke around in east freeport in a<br/>
tavern near the docks - there is a bard in there holding - get this - a lute<br/>
in one hand and dagger or sword in the other - hehe.<br/>

		Subject:	[eqbards] Lambent breastplate quest<br/>
peculiarity<br/>
<br/>
		I completed the lambent breastplate quest the other day.<br/>
When I gave the<br/>
		quest components to Cyrissia (sp?), I got the breastplate,<br/>
faction change<br/>
		messages, experience gain message,  etc.  I then noticed on<br/>
the next line in<br/>
		the text window a message from Cyrissia saying &quot;Aren&#39;t you<br/>
forgetting<br/>
		something?&quot;.  None of the words were bracketed as a key<br/>
word/phrase.  I<br/>
		tried replying with variations of &quot;What am I forgetting?&quot;<br/>
but got no further<br/>
		response from her.  Was wondering if this was just a bug or<br/>
if there might<br/>
		possibly something else I could have given her?<br/>
