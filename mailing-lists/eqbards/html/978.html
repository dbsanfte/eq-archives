&gt;After playing a bard in beta P4, and then in commercial up to<br/>
&gt;level 13, I decided I needed a break.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just for the thrill of it, I joined Rallos Zek (PvP).  During the<br/>
&gt;peak times, this server is near the top, but right near the<br/>
&gt;bottom during off-times.<br/>
&gt;As for crowded newbie areas, I have seen none of that problem<br/>
&gt;around Oggok (Ogre home town).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And my personal opinion is that you must be PvP to role-play<br/>
&gt;correctly.  Of course, our definitions of role-playing may<br/>
&gt;differ, and you are free to disagree (may start an interesting<br/>
&gt;thread on just what is role-playing).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also find that a good number of people I have encountered are<br/>
&gt;role-playing to a certain degree.  Not all-out hell-for-leather<br/>
&gt;role playing, but not just acting themselves, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess it is easier to role play an Ogre eg.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m out of food and water, going to town to get some.<br/>
&gt;vs<br/>
&gt;Me hungry.  Get food.  You want?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hehe, ok one of my favorite things when I first started playing EQ was when <br/>
an ogre or troll roleplays in character. Come to think of it I haven&#39;t many <br/>
who don&#39;t. Keeps it fun, that&#39;s for sure. Of course dwarves acting like <br/>
grumpy old louts I think are fun too.<br/>
