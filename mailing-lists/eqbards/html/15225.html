<div id="ygrps-yiv-637686906">When I was 46 and got about half way across, I took my first run into the<br/>
Plane of Fear.  My guild has decided to avoid the weekend mess by going<br/>
mid-week.  They went in Wed and cleared zone and killed Cazic Thule (I<br/>
stayed back and worked on getting a buffer into 46.)  Then patch day on<br/>
Thursday and we decided to go back and get the Dracoliche and  Mr Potato<br/>
head again and I got to go along.<br/>
<br/>
Final score:<br/>
<br/>
Draco 0; Sylly 1 (heh, we got him!)<br/>
<br/>
CT 1; Sylly 0 (we should have cleared a few more mobs and knew it at the<br/>
time but decided to kamikaze and hope to loot before we were all smooshed.<br/>
that&#39;s when we were the first on our server to find out he&#39;d been buffed up<br/>
in the day&#39;s patch.  we had decided to try some wild and crazy tactics on<br/>
him -- including having the 2 bard&#39;s (me 46 and Kaldivar 49) equip brass<br/>
horn and try to screech off the so-called lesser mobs so we could fight<br/>
cazic more or less alone.  all i can say is - heh - it sorta worked!  but in<br/>
the end, with CT hitting for 400 and them extra mobs too - we got smooshed.)<br/>
<br/>
And after CorpseRecovery we ended at 5am (my time) on a week night -- ugh!<br/>
For the night I took 2 deaths, got level 50 res both times and ended up down<br/>
about one big quarter bub from where I started.  Each death seemed to knock<br/>
me back a good chunk but not quite a full bub.  Each res brought me back a<br/>
good chunk but not quite all of my lost xp.  And I am starting to believe<br/>
even more that dying to deep red mobs takes less than dying to low blue or<br/>
green ones.<br/>
<br/>
A couple nights later, we were kinda bored and decided to do Fire Giants.  A<br/>
flawless run (nobody died*) and we even tried some &quot;new&quot; stuff as we cleared<br/>
everything to the lair.  On the way out we decided to camp Stone Spider room<br/>
for experience rebuilding.  By the end of that night, I was half a bub from<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Next day, I solo&#39;d spectres until I dinged and even did a few more just to<br/>
see some yellow.  Then took a break and was traveling around when I got the<br/>
call: &#39;want to come to sky with us?&#39;  My first thought was &quot;ugh, I am too<br/>
young to go to planes...&quot;  Then I remembered - I am level 47!!! So, I got to<br/>
go to the PoA for the first time.  Plan was to do the first island only and<br/>
call it quits.  We did and afterwards I bought a key to the quest temple and<br/>
went over there.  I have some screen shots and some logs of the dialogs - if<br/>
i sort them - I&#39;ll post info.  Suffice it to say, it was very spooky and a<br/>
very different treatment of a zone.  And the best part was running off into<br/>
space and falling to the water off East Freeport - alive!!!  I went to a new<br/>
zone and did not die!  Now that&#39;s a first!<br/>

* nobody in the main party that is.  We had one of our lower level members<br/>
tagging along - mid 30ish necro. he bought it trying to train into us<br/>
through the bug room. and again in some lava. and one more time he got<br/>
smooshed by a fire giant.  but we gave him a nice gift to remember his first<br/>
time to see the fire giants.  some kinda mask thing with nice stats (i am<br/>
real bad with loots and dont remember the exact name.)<br/>

&gt; It happened again, but slightly differently this time.<br/>
&gt; I hit 47 last night, then died without having gained any<br/>
&gt; experience in it.  I lost &quot;only&quot; a bit more than a half bubble<br/>
&gt; into 46.  My friends who&#39;ve died at 46 all said they lost<br/>
&gt; about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 bubble per death in it. </span></blockquote></div>
