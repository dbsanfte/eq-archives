<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Last night Roop (a fellow bard) and I were grouping with a party in Highhold<br/>
&gt;Pass fighting orcs.  After one particular tough battle, one of the party<br/>
&gt;members stated that the fight would have been a lot easier if he hadn&#39;t been<br/>
&gt;rooted the entire battle.  I then told him that had he informed the group<br/>
&gt;that he was rooted, Roop or I could have easily broken him free with Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I thought that Selo&#39;s only broke a root spell on the bard who<br/>
sings it, not on the party members. Any confirmation on this?<br/>
<br/>
Also, you&#39;re absolutely right about multiple bards in a group. Also, an<br/>
entire group of bards is pretty interesting in a fight when you get to the<br/>
lvl 15 and above range. You MUST coordinate your songs, but if you take the<br/>
time to do so, you can do some amazing things in combat.<br/>
<br/>
One fun thing to try with a group of two or three bards is to learn how to<br/>
stack CoD. You CAN do this, but you have to time it so that the pulses come<br/>
at slightly different times. If you work it right, your opponent will wince<br/>
until he dies.<br/>

Listen and Live.<br/>
