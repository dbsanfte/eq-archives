<div id="ygrps-yiv-98333340">Great, thanks for the info.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What level are you?  I assume since you are talking about the mana song, you<br/>
&gt; are level 32+.  All i was thinking was that you are not level 26 yet, when i<br/>
&gt; believe it shows up as a skill on Carskin.  Or perhaps they made it<br/>
&gt; available at a later level, hard to explain.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The yucky level of 35. (Forgot to leave name and such in original thread).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m left with one more question still for anyone who can respond.<br/>
What is the duration of the mana song? &quot;Your mind clears.&quot; Is that the end of<br/>
it, or like other songs does it last for 2 more ticks?<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that the duration of the mana song is 1 tick only because of the<br/>
fact that the mana song is cumulative if you have more than 1 bard in your<br/>
party. 2 bards can sing it, and it stacks well. The casters in the party, with<br/>
double mana song going, were on some kind of a high.<br/>
Anyways, thanks for the info.<br/>
<br/>
Now another quick question thats on a different topic again. I recently hit 35<br/>
and was wondering how useful or practical it is to use Denon&#39;s Dissension aka<br/>
the mana-drain song. I&#39;d think it&#39;d come in handy when fighting some tough<br/>
casters or the never-ending mana NPCs, but has anyone tested this against a<br/>
friend or anything to see how much and how fast their mana actually drains?<br/>
Basically, what I want to know is, should I ever bother memorizing this song?<br/>
I&#39;ll test it out on my own, but please comment on this if you&#39;ve had any<br/>
experience with it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
