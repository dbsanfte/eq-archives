&gt; Merv might view things a little differently if a party member is slashing<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it won&#39;t work with a player if you do just one charm -<br/>
the mob will turn on the player doing the damage eventually.  <br/>
It *will* work with multiple charms.  There&#39;s a 2-person<br/>
&quot;kiting&quot; method that works similarly.  One person with SoW<br/>
nukes/taunts a mob to get it mad at him and runs in circles.  <br/>
The other person stands in the middle and blasts at it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve wondered what&#39;ll happen then too.  I&#39;ve never tried it<br/>
because I&#39;m afraid of Merv instantly whacking the guard<br/>
because I&#39;m no longer a valid target and the guard is on his<br/>
hate list, and I&#39;ll take the faction hit.  Tells us what<br/>
happens if you do try it.  :-)<br/>
