&gt; Well EV... if you want to upgrade your system you may be <br/>
&gt; better off doing<br/>
&gt; the processor and memory only at this point.  Question is:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I might.  There are more things to consider than I mentioned.  (eg I<br/>
need more DASD again, all my apps are out of date, the 64 MB of RAM fills<br/>
all the slots, my BF would nag me less if I gave him my current PC & got him<br/>
hooked on EQ, it&#39;s a mini-tower and not every motherboard will physically<br/>
fit in it (though I&#39;m not sure how much of a problem that is anymore), I<br/>
should really replace the winmodem, and the list goes on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sounds like your friends didn&#39;t know what they were talking <br/>
&gt; about.  Gateway<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mix/match motherboards.  They have 1 motherboard for <br/>
&gt; one chip type<br/>
&gt; (Pentium) and another for Athlons (you have to, they&#39;re not <br/>
&gt; compatible)<br/>
&gt; Generally speaking, up to about a year ago, Gateway shipped <br/>
&gt; 90% of systems<br/>
&gt; with the 440BX (argueably the best chipset ever) board from <br/>
&gt; Intel (if you<br/>
&gt; overclock it it IS the best board out and can use 133mhz SDRAM on it).<br/>
&gt; They had a couple other boards that shipped with E-Series <br/>
&gt; (IE: Business)<br/>
&gt; systems but the customer systems were all shipped based on <br/>
&gt; 440 BX boards.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I should point out that my experience with Gateways desktops has been with<br/>
the P series (which I can&#39;t recall having troubles with) G-200s (which came<br/>
with different video cards, NICs, and memory, if not motherboards) and the E<br/>
series.  Portables were Solo 2000s, 2100s, 2300s, and 2500.  The different<br/>
components in the desktops caused problems with drivers when trying to use<br/>
one image on every PC in a company.  The portables were just plain crap.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I shouldn&#39;t say that about the portables.  Perhaps I just saw all<br/>
the lemons Gateway put out, but odds were you&#39;d be replacing parts inside a<br/>
year and your replacement parts had as much chance of working as Lullaby has<br/>
of controlling a train of blue mobs.  Although the failure rate on<br/>
replacement parts may have been the fault of Unisys (contracted for hardware<br/>
replacement) and not Gateway.  Still, Unisys didn&#39;t come into the picture<br/>
until the Solos themselves started breaking down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At any rate, nice system.  But you got lied to about Gateway <br/>
&gt; ;)  (I should<br/>
&gt; know.  I work at a Gateway Manufacturing center as a <br/>
&gt; contracted Network<br/>
&gt; Engineer)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guess we should be careful what companies we slag off, eh? ;^)<br/>
<br/>
Kevin, I&#39;ve got no doubts you know more about hardware than I do, but I take<br/>
nothing back.  I&#39;ve had a worse experience supporting Gateway hardware than<br/>
I have had with any other manufacturer.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
