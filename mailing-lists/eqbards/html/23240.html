<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076682910">In groups where I didn&#39;t have to melee, I used to turn away from the action,<br/>
and just keep a real close eye on the chat window, while twisting my songs.<br/>
Of course, this didn&#39;t work so well the one time I was backstabbed for my<br/>
efforts...heh.  I don&#39;t do that anymore, since I did miss an add once, with<br/>
ruinous consequences, so I have learned to twist even when it is laggy,<br/>
standing in the middle of everything.  This effectively eliminates any hopes<br/>
of a 4 song twist, but I can usually keep 3 going, with a bit of effort.  My<br/>
groupmates often wonder why I don&#39;t talk to them during a fight...heh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never bothered to twist instruments.  If I don&#39;t need weapons, I equip<br/>
the instrument for whichever song I want to have the highest effect.<br/>
Normally, for tank groups, anthem, purifying, and guarding with drums<br/>
equipped, dropping the rythyms and doing anthem/chains when mob is about to<br/>
run, switching to heal and lute during downtime.<br/>
<br/>
I normally stay in the first person view.  Does moving to a third person<br/>
relieve some of the video lag in the first person view?  Never tried it, and<br/>
I won&#39;t get any play time until tomorrow :( night to experiment.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  :)<br/>

<br/>
they have mentioned they were going to fix this, but never have.  low, med,<br/>
high look the same to me.  they need to let you see epic weapons no matter<br/>
what your density, or have a separate setting for them, and they need to<br/>
make the settings actually mean something, since they all look the same.  i<br/>
don&#39;t see how a bard can play with particles on, which is unfortunate.  i<br/>
would love to play in a low setting if it really meant low.<br/>

&gt; out them.  I<br/>
&gt; always kept the density set to low ...but the sparkles look <br/>
&gt; the same to me<br/>
&gt; on low, med and high.  Is it just me?  I hit 39 last night <br/>
&gt; and the particle<br/>
&gt; effects are killing me.  I don&#39;t want to turn them off but I <br/>
&gt; am not seeing<br/>
&gt; a choice here.  Any suggestions?  I play in the &quot;out of body&quot; <br/>
&gt; views already.<br/>
