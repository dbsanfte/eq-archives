<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029774110">I took a quick glance through the site.  Very nice job, very<br/>
close to what I originally had in mind for when I HTMLized<br/>
it.  There are a couple mistakes here and there, I will send<br/>
you a list later (maybe tonight) when I&#39;ve had a chance to<br/>
read everything.  The most obvious one is that the slowdown<br/>
for Chain/Binding is -30%, not -20%.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious why you removed the instrument effect notes.  I<br/>
put that there to make it easier for people to decide whether<br/>
to use weapons or switch to instruments.<br/>
