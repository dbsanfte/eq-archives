&gt; &gt;There are /feedback and /bug commands to take care of<br/>
&gt; &gt;these types of problems.  These commands will be routed<br/>
&gt; &gt;to the Developers who can fix the problem.  Or email your<br/>
&gt; &gt;complaints to Verant directly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In theory you are absoutely right, however in practice<br/>
&gt; typing in /bug and some information is like putting stuff<br/>
&gt; in the bitbucket.  I&#39;m not convinced that /feedback and<br/>
&gt; /bug actually get examined often enough.  I&#39;ve already<br/>
&gt; done those things, yet the problem continues.  /petition<br/>
&gt; makes the Guide log my complaint in their database of<br/>
&gt; things that are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might be correct that a GM verged bug may get more attention.  But<br/>
repeatedly /petitioning the same bug everytime it occurs is of little use.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And as for taking up too much<br/>
&gt; time.  The guide merely needs to answer me that he<br/>
&gt; received my complaint and logged it.  He doesn&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; to visit me or even think about any issue, he just needs<br/>
&gt; to field my call, like a good support rep would.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But if many people did the same thing you do, it would take the GMs a<br/>
significant portion of time to process.  If all of the 1500 players did one<br/>
petition a night, and each /petition only took 2 minutes to log, thats 50<br/>
hours a night of GM time.  Do you think there should be 6 GMs on every night<br/>
to just handle logging bugs into a database?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Well if IDIOTS fill the petition queue with RETARDED petitions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I assume that means me the &#39;idiot&#39; with the &#39;retarded&#39;<br/>
&gt; question doesn&#39;t pay the 10 bux a month to get some kind<br/>
&gt; of support?  Bzzzzt.  Wrong answer.  Too few guides/GMs<br/>
&gt; is the root of your frustration with not getting answered<br/>
&gt; quickly enough.  My problem isn&#39;t life threatening, then<br/>
&gt; again no one&#39;s really is - it&#39;s a game.  A game that needs<br/>
&gt; a lot of work, imo.  If I make my voice heard enough,<br/>
&gt; something is bound to change.  Plus this problem affects<br/>
&gt; everyone in my party, not just me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The game does need a lot of work.  As you said, the squeaky wheel gets the<br/>
oil.  But squeak to the person holding the oil, not the GMs that are pushing<br/>
the cart.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Dark Elf Necro kills Cros Treewind.<br/>
&gt; I am in the kill radius playing Clarity for five people.<br/>
&gt; I invoke a faction hit (bug) and my party is now KOS in<br/>
&gt; Surefall/Qeynos/Kelethin.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thinking about this bug, I think I know what is causing it.  Bards AOE songs<br/>
&quot;touch&quot; everyone in a certain radius.  Then the song checks to see which of<br/>
these people the song should actually affect.  Now the faction hit code<br/>
checks to see who has been involved in the killing.  Since your song has<br/>
&quot;touched&quot; the killer, you loose faction.  This is probably the cause of many<br/>
&quot;bard-hate&quot; incidents.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; You think thats retarded not to petition?  I&#39;m an idiot =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did the petition get this bug fixed?  Did your faction get repaired?  I<br/>
don&#39;t think so.<br/>
