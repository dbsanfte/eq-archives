<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-478411806">i know it comes from a rare in Trakanon who casts heavily.  it also does not<br/>
give iksar regen, and no platemail shows up on iksar&#39;s =/  i still want it<br/>
though hehe.  but without platemail lokos i don&#39;t want it all that bad.  so<br/>
your question is a good one, what does being an iksar do for you other than<br/>
maybe a little faction and just for fun.  do they have ultravision?  that&#39;s<br/>
why i use my current guise, and i use it a lot in kunark, always seems to be<br/>
dark.<br/>
