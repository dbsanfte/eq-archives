Some cast two types (usually magic + something), but a lot of<br/>
wizard-types seem to use fire and cold and sometimes magic.  <br/>
Once you&#39;re facing two non-magic types of spells, the Psalms<br/>
don&#39;t cut it - you can play both Warmth and Cooling, but they<br/>
will cancel the other each time they pulse.<br/>
<br/>
If you *know* you&#39;re going to be fighting one and only one<br/>
type of casting mob that uses only one type of spell, then you<br/>
can usually use a Psalm for resists.  But if you&#39;re getting<br/>
several types of mobs, rather than keep several Psalms<br/>
memorized and tying up song slots, I&#39;d prefer to just keep one<br/>
Rhythm song memorized and switch to a drum if facing a nasty<br/>
caster(s).<br/>
<br/>
The shaman types are the worst since they fling cold, magic,<br/>
poison, and disease spells (so you can&#39;t cover all the bases<br/>
even using Rhythm songs).  Fortunately, they also tend to do<br/>
the least damage, concentrating mostly on debuffs.<br/>
