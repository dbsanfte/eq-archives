I have looked over all the jewellery that an enchanter<br/>
can make.<br/>
I also realize there are earrings, rings, etc<br/>
available to higher<br/>
level players from dungeons.  This is my take on the<br/>
best player<br/>
made jewellery in the game for a bard, and what I<br/>
currently wear.<br/>
<br/>
face:    platinum star ruby veil, cha9 dex9<br/>
neck:    golden black pearl choker, agi7 dex7<br/>
ear:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>
ear:     electrum sapphire earring, str4, int2<br/>
finger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>
finger:  golden star ruby ring, dex7, cha5<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For now, I wear a platinum black pearl ring (agi +6,<br/>
dex +6) and a platinum fire emerald ring (dex +5, str<br/>
+5). I can&#39;t charm yet, so my cha seems to not  be as<br/>
important. I own a set of the gold star ruby rings,<br/>
and electrum cats eye agate bracers, too. I only wear<br/>
them for selling and buying, right now. As far as<br/>
bracers - I&#39;ve been blessed with a pair of serpentine<br/>
bracers - (str +3, agi +9) they seem to help a lot. I<br/>
zoned into Droon the other night, and dodged 4 arracks<br/>
in a row, before zoning.<br/>
Aside from those differences, that&#39;s exactly what I<br/>
wear. I&#39;ll post my stats at a later date.<br/>
