<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049860671">One other thing to consider when dual wielding, especially for bards with<br/>
low STR and STA, is the weight of the weapons.  When I first got dual wield,<br/>
I used a dragoon dirk and a Pugius dagger.  Both of these are very light<br/>
weapons.  In long combats, my stamina bar almost never dropped.  I now use<br/>
the dragoon dirk and a barbed leather whip.  Because the whip weighs more<br/>
than the Pugius dagger, my stamina bar often drops below 50% after a long<br/>
battle.  If my stamina gets too low, the primary stats start to decrease.<br/>
For me, dual wielding light, fast weapons works out the best.  It also gives<br/>
me more room in my backpack to carry loot.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Lowering deviation from average however, does increase predictability<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; means less dying.  The faster weapon means you&#39;ll die less from mobs you<br/>
&gt; have easily killed before, while with a higher damage weapon you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; sometimes easily beat a white con andthen get thoroughly trounced by the<br/>
&gt; same white con the very next time.  Fast weapons are the best defense<br/>
&gt; against clumpy random number generation.  Missing 5 times in a row with my<br/>
&gt; Dirk is meaningless in a fight where I have to hit 100 times anyway.<br/>
&gt; Missing 5 straight times with a delay 45 weapon is equivalent to 10 plus<br/>
&gt; straght misses  and will cause death.  Of course 5 straight hits are as<br/>
&gt; advantageous as the misses are disad., but its the lack of predictability<br/>
&gt; that kills.  Can I take this blue dangerous?  Only if I don&#39;t get bad<br/>
&gt; luck,<br/>
&gt; whereas with the faster wepon you generally know what you can handle and<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t after trying it once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still maintain JM was in error here.  More chances to hit<br/>
&gt; only lowers deviation from the average - that is, you&#39;re more<br/>
&gt; likely to get average results.  Sometimes that is a good<br/>
&gt; thing, but it is not advantageous as a general rule.  A higher<br/>
&gt; deviation just means you&#39;re further away from the average -<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re more likely to do worse than average, but you&#39;re just<br/>
&gt; as more likely to do *better* than average.<br/>

&gt; I agreed with John here.  The higher dmg weapon is better than the faster<br/>
&gt; weapon when the dmg ratio are the same.  I used to used a Demon claw and a<br/>
&gt; Silver war axe.  That was fast.  But now that I have the crystalline blade<br/>
&gt; and the black enamel mace I find the later weapons a lot more efficient.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have no scientific facts except that with the Crys blade and mace the MOBs<br/>
&gt; seems to hate me a lot more than when I was fighting with Claw and axe.<br/>
&gt; Same mob at same lvl.<br/>
