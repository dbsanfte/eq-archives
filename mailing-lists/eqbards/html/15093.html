<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634040427">How nice that Abashi can respond to your post when he has answers that pretty much say, &quot;See?  We ARE working on it!&quot;  Interesting that he didn&#39;t reply to John&#39;s post that has about 6 or 7 pages worth of bumps on it, and a TON of statistical data about Lullaby.<br/>

&gt;Actually bards got a new song. It&#39;s like 20 hp regen and adds ac. Still<br/>
&gt;though bards got a nice round of songs can you think of many that would keep<br/>
&gt;balance in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One thing though that really pissed me of this patch was that my level 50<br/>
&gt;dark elf necromancer is kos in Paineel the necro city! Heck you think I<br/>
&gt;would at leats be dubious. I got my faction to dubious by killing guards but<br/>
&gt;it maxed out there. I seriously hope somebody finds a way to get warmly<br/>
&gt;because I want to be able to enter the necro city.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I was the bard who spoke up, said my piece after the patch.  Abashi seemed<br/>
&gt;to be quite pissie in his response, but I can understand that.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I tell ya all this... I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s different people working on<br/>
&gt;equipment, and if they got another song in.  We are still missing 3 songs,<br/>
&gt;and should not settle.  Why bards are a lower priority than other classes, I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;On the good foot, tried the invis song, and it worked...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Tried the area affect songs... Largos almost got me killed in lguk...<br/>
&gt;pulled 2 outta 3 froggies off a pally & ranger, I am assuming they were<br/>
&gt;laying on the taunt button...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;All in all... I think he was saying, if I don&#39;t like it, I can leave.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Something about not being able to satisfy all the people.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I dunno... just doesn&#39;t seem right to me<br/>
