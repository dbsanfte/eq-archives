<div id="ygrps-yiv-798432511">The faster weapon should go in your secondary slot. Since your dual wield <br/>
skill is checked when it&#39;s delay goes off.  A faster weapons mean more DW <br/>
checks, which means more chance to hit with the second weapon.  That said <br/>
the difference between your two weapons is only .2 seconds, so in this case <br/>
it is something you would never notice.  But if you want to maximize that is <br/>
the way to go.<br/>

&gt;I have a Dragoon dirk (6/23) and a pugius (5/21) theory says that I should<br/>
&gt;put the pugius as my main weapon but it&#39;s ratio is lower than the dragoon<br/>
&gt;dirk. So, over time, wouldn&#39;t I be doing more damage (at level 17) by <br/>
&gt;having<br/>
&gt;the Dragoon dirk as my primary?<br/>
