<div id="ygrps-yiv-281234646">Well, here is something you could do for a real adventure and it would kill<br/>
two birds with one stone:<br/>
<br/>
1.	Travel to Everfrost and find Karg the Icebear.  Give him 5pp and<br/>
polar bear skin (kill one or buy one from a vendor in Halas tunnel) and he<br/>
will make you a Polar Bear Cloak.<br/>
2.	Go to Crushbone and trade the PBC for the Dragoon Dirk.  A PBC<br/>
should be pretty rare item for this part of the world.<br/>
<br/>
That would give you great travel experience and get you a dirk for a good<br/>
price.  You might have to season the trade with like 10pp but in Crush you<br/>
should be able to get a Dirk for 20pp maybe 15pp if you get lucky.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime - I&#39;d say use a giant snake fang for your wep.<br/>

		I have just reached Level 9, and am currently considering<br/>
going<br/>
		beyond the safety of East Commonlands. (Prexus Server)<br/>
<br/>
		I am still using my trusty Scimitar, and I have tried a Mino<br/>
Axe, but<br/>
		have found that while the large damage is nice, it is kinda<br/>
slow.<br/>
<br/>
		I have enough money to get a Combine Scimitar, but seeing as<br/>
it is<br/>
		just a magic upgrade (and one speed) to the Scimitar, I have<br/>
held<br/>
		off.  I have seen the Swashbuckler with his 200pp+ weapons,<br/>
and I&#39;m<br/>
		trying to decide if it is worth saving money for those<br/>
Well-Balanced<br/>
		weapons or a Demon&#39;s Claw / Dragoon&#39;s Dirk if I come across<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
		How resaleable are the well balanced weapons?<br/>
<br/>
		And where should I hang around to hear auctions on Dragoon&#39;s<br/>
Dirk? <br/>
		Greater Faydark near Crushbone?<br/>
<br/>
		Thanks guys.<br/>
