<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086579528">Its 11am PST right now and still i can not get on... are the servers down or<br/>
is my computer just really screwed up?<br/>
<br/>
They said it would be done by 10 am and now its 11 am and Talies already got<br/>
the patch message somehow...<br/>
<br/>
I really need someone to send an email to tell me what&#39;s happening!<br/>
