 </span></blockquote>For Paladins, the mana boost was probably a great thing. In a lot of<br/>
situations, having a paladin cast the first heal saved a lot of beat<br/>
down on the cleric, now they have mana for more than 5 heals before oom.<br/>
This also allows them to chain stun longer, which at higher levels is<br/>
often very valuable.<br/>
<br/>
For Rangers, having extra mana is more questionable, but one thing it<br/>
does allow is for them to dump wis and mana items for higher AC now, and<br/>
that&#39;s probably worth something. <br/>
<br/>
Sk&#39;s, I don&#39;t know enough about their mana usage to comment.<br/>
