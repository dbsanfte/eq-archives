<br/>
Pick a blue mob and charm it several times, cast, run, cast, run, cast, run<br/>
<br/>
Now it really hates you<br/>
<br/>
Find handy nasty green mob, charm it and make it attack the blue that hates<br/>
you<br/>
<br/>
The blue will ignore the greenie (because he hates you more)<br/>
<br/>
The green will eventually agro the blue but take some damage<br/>
<br/>
You and the greenie kill the blue<br/>
<br/>
Now as a nice reward for your loyal and faithful (for the last 10 seconds or<br/>
so) pet, you kill it when it is at pretty low health having just saved your<br/>
life from the nasty blue<br/>

I don&#39;t understand what is being accomplished here guys.  Please explain it<br/>
using small words and speak slowly.  My base INT is only 75.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; if you only have a uber blue and some greens.  Charm the blue a<br/>
&gt; few times.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He will now be agro against you and will ingnore you<br/>
&gt; completely.  Now find<br/>
&gt; &gt; a green mob that is as fast as the uber blue and charm it and get it to<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack the uber blue.  What I found is a griffawn can take down a<br/>
&gt; &gt; griffenne in about 4-5 charms on the Griffawn ^_^.  Got my charm in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; manner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know, this is really really clever.  I&#39;d been risking<br/>
&gt; death by tossing a Chain on the mob that I wanted to lose, but<br/>
&gt; I like your method better.<br/>
