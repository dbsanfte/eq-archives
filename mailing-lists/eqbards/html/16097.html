<div id="ygrps-yiv-579947536">Harmonic - I have a hard time disagreeing with anything you&#39;ve posted here.<br/>
I do remain hopeful that you&#39;re wrong; and the expansion will come out and<br/>
we&#39;ll have a bunch of cool new songs; that they for the most part work.  I<br/>
also hope that they fix Lullaby - and get the other missing songs (that they<br/>
said would be out with the expansion)<br/>

Naive?  Well, I&#39;m a lifelong Cubs fan (and two-time season ticket holder)<br/>
who also hopes to see my beloved team win the World Series.<br/>

&gt;   95% of what is listed in that file is live and in the game.  To suggest<br/>
&gt;   that half of it won&#39;t make it to final is pure speculation on your part.<br/>
&gt;   And that&#39;s what this all boils down to.  Everyone&#39;s best guess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If those spells made it into the file this far, chances are they are<br/>
&gt;   going into the game.  Allbeit, their values/stats/effects may be tweaked<br/>
&gt;   you can count on those spells going live.  Such is my experience since<br/>
&gt;   early beta.  (And I don&#39;t mean the bogus InstantKill spell at the end<br/>
&gt;   of the file)<br/>
