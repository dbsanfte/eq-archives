<div id="ygrps-yiv-683757596">I consider the tentacle whip to be one of those screwed up weapons.  By the<br/>
time you are able to obtain one they are already obsolete.  I am not sure<br/>
why Verant seems to put level one spells on weapons that will be obtained<br/>
by people over 15.  It gives you 4 hit points per proc, 4 hp is a joke.  I<br/>
usually like to throw the crystal staffs (except fire) in to this also but<br/>
at least they have a bit better base damage.<br/>
<br/>
But even though they are junk, every once in a while I will switch to them<br/>
if I am in a full group and we are handling everything well.  ...I just<br/>
enjoy seeing the procs =)  Right now I am looking forward to 25 when my<br/>
Gnoll hide lariet will come out to play, by then I should have 2.<br/>

&gt;I noticed that during the Dual Wield thread, some of you fine Bards said that<br/>
&gt;you use a Tentacle Whip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have one, but have never used it, due to the low damage and low proc.  <br/>
&gt;Instead<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m using one Barbed and one Dragoon Dirk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you feel that the low delay makes it viable?  Have you seen the proc<br/>
&gt;damage/heal be enough to be attractive?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d hate to think that I&#39;m letting this baby sit because I&#39;m too much of a<br/>
&gt;goober to know better :P<br/>
