<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145741100"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;It used to be one of the most totally scary zones we had.  Even if there<br/>
&gt;were no really bad mobs in there (after level 20/25 when ghouls go green) <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;was still scary - dark, foggy, ucky noises and all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, I was there last night and it was as dark and foggy as always.<br/>
<br/>
This time, however, I had the pleasure of getting attacked by an enraged <br/>
dire wolf who was yellow to me! He triple attacked for 77,97, 93. Ouch!!<br/>
<br/>
I was waiting for the Blair Witch to pop out. :)<br/>
