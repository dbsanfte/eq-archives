<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092272135">It could very well be that J.M. is correct in that the Jig is not<br/>
*designed* to have any effect on mana regen yet there is some side effect in<br/>
the code that is not known that actually affects it. A difference of a half<br/>
of a minute does seem a bit large due to server refresh rates.<br/>
	And in the end does it really matter? If your party members *think* that it<br/>
does even if it might not and you&#39;re just standing around anyway, why not<br/>
appeal to them and play it? I guess if it comes down to a choice in songs<br/>
one may be torn but if there&#39;s an extra song slot...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

8)Well J.M. Capozzi laid it to rest a while back.  Jig actually<br/>
8)has no effect<br/>
8)on mana.<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Course, if you can indeed disprove him then I&#39;d be thinking<br/>
8)J.M. Capozzi<br/>
8)wasn&#39;t really with Verant afterall.  I mean I can&#39;t confirm<br/>
8)whether or not<br/>
8)J.M. is legit.  Is this just someone who just joined the<br/>
8)list, and knew a<br/>
8)heck of a lot about the game and faked it?<br/>
8)<br/>
8)Actually, I doubt that J.M. is a &quot;fake&quot; but wish you consider it, for<br/>
8)arguments sake.  I have no idea who J.M. is, and have no<br/>
8)resource to confirm<br/>
8)it for that matter.  Must say, if J.M. were a fake, he or she<br/>
8)would be a<br/>
8)very good fake.  But who are we, as the grunts, to know who<br/>
8)makes the game<br/>
8)anyway?<br/>
