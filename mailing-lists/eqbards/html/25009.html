<div id="ygrps-yiv-817215031">I just recently upgraded because of the same problem, frame rate.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
know what was going to give me what I wanted.  So I played hit and miss.<br/>
Months back I went from 128 meg of PC100 memory to 256 PC100.  I didn&#39;t get<br/>
any noticeable improvement.  I replaced my 300a Celeron (overclocked to<br/>
450) with a P3 700 three weeks ago (fastest chip the mobo will take).<br/>
There was a huge improvement in frame rate.  I can keep my clipping plane<br/>
maxed in burning woods and still have a _nearly_ flicker free run.  I fact<br/>
I did auto-follow through there a few days ago with out a problem.<br/>
However, the song gems are slow to &quot;ungray&quot; during twisting.  If I turn the<br/>
clipping plane down 6 notches (to about 2/3) it becomes a decent trade off<br/>
in viewable distance and twisting time.  Right now I feel the TNT card is<br/>
holding me back the rest of the way.  But with Luclin coming out later in<br/>
the year I want to wait and upgrade the video card then.  To what I don&#39;t<br/>
know yet, depends on the prices and Verant&#39;s recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my current system specs:<br/>
P3 700 (Slot 1)<br/>
Abit BX6 Rev 2 Motherboard<br/>
256 PC100 RAM (Two 64 meg and one 128 meg, all CL 2, don&#39;t know the brand)<br/>
Sound Blaster Graphics Blaster TNT 16 meg AGP<br/>
Sound Blaster Live!<br/>
<br/>
I wish you luck.<br/>

&gt;graphically, so this can be an important topic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 16 MB AGP <br/>
&gt;graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a better <br/>
&gt;graphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram - <br/>
&gt;done.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards <br/>
&gt;they use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything else <br/>
&gt;of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and some <br/>
&gt;places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t scrape me <br/>
&gt;off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>

&gt;Thanks again for all the help,<br/>
