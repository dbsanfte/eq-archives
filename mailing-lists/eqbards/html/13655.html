<div id="ygrps-yiv-521823628">I have to sing the praises of smart Wizards (there are a few).  I<br/>
occassionally get to group with a really bright Hong Kong player who is a<br/>
high level wizard.  He plays his wiz in almost a clerical fashion and it<br/>
works quite well.  The puller brings a mob and the wiz is medding.  The<br/>
tanks begin to beat on the mob.  When the mob gets sufficiently aggrod on<br/>
the tanks the Wiz stands and casts a nuke *bam* then sits his ass back down<br/>
and meds.  After a few seconds if the tanks are having problems he&#39;ll stand<br/>
up again *bam* and sit back down.  When mob flees he stands up *bam*, dead.<br/>
He never gets touched, he&#39;s medding the majority of the time and he stops<br/>
the runners.  I make it a point to group with the guy when I see he&#39;s in my<br/>
zone.<br/>

&lt;snip about snaring/rooting&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; If you have a good nuker, you don&#39;t even need that - a wizard<br/>
&gt; can drop them dead before they start to run.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, if you&#39;re working without a snarer, the first priority<br/>
&gt; for me would be to find an area you can pull to and still have<br/>
&gt; a reasonable amount of time to kill a mob when it runs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Besides, druids and rangers comprise probably half the<br/>
&gt; characters in the game.  :)  The only people I really feel for<br/>
&gt; are warriors, rogues, and monks.<br/>
