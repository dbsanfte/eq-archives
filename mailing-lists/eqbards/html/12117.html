<div id="ygrps-yiv-352266341">It was likely the friend that caused the merchant hit.  I have killed Trumpy<br/>
about 12 times and am kindly to the merchants now.  However, the bouncer, or<br/>
Madame Serena, or the Captain will all help Trumpy if they are nearby.  All<br/>
of them give minus faction hits to the merchants of Qeynos.<br/>

&gt; The weapon is nice for clerics who want to sit back and enjoy the +10MR<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; only occasionally melee.  Also, the faction hit isn&#39;t particularly<br/>
&gt; important.  I killed the renegade Trumpy many times and am still only<br/>
&gt; dubious to the corrupt guards.  Since I don&#39;t want to have anything to do<br/>
&gt; with the corrupt guards anyhow, that&#39;s a plus in my book.  Also killing<br/>
&gt; Trumpy raises your faction with merchants, not lowers it.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, are you sure on that last bit?  I used to be amiable with<br/>
the merchants there.  Then I camped in Cazic and got hit by<br/>
that bug that reset some of my factions and I was back to<br/>
dubious with them, but they&#39;d still sell to me.  I was grouped<br/>
with a friend who was KOS to Trumpy, and we ran into this bug.  <br/>
Trumpy and a friend came charging up the dock and my friends<br/>
casually killed them both.  Since I was playing Clarity at the<br/>
time, I took the faction hits.  The merchants wouldn&#39;t sell to<br/>
me after that.<br/>
