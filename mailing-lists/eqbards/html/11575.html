<div id="ygrps-yiv-47433095">I have a problem with obtaining lambent stones.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m running around NRo/Oasis/SRo regularly now and shouting out for lambent<br/>
stones assuming people will be cool and just give them to the poor bard who<br/>
needs them for his armor quest like most people do with all the rest of the<br/>
no-drop quest components for all the other classes.  I assumed wrong.<br/>
<br/>
This may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying to cash in<br/>
on lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>
cheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>
saying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>
refuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent over 1000pp<br/>
purchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not going to hand<br/>
some greedy bugger more.<br/>
<br/>
Soooo, I am now camping SG&#39;s in oasis every opportunity I can but I killed 4<br/>
last night and did not find a single one.  I am joining pickup groups for<br/>
the purpose of giant hunting and I often have to convince my group members<br/>
that they should let me loot a stone should we find one.  I just don&#39;t get<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I still need about 7 lambent stones total for the rest of my armor and I am<br/>
certainly not willing to pay another 200-1000pp to obtain them, I don&#39;t even<br/>
have that kind of money anymore after buying the other components.  But I<br/>
have been looking for my next stone for 4 in-game days now and have killed 5<br/>
giants and am still empty-handed.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations apart from soloing in<br/>
the Rathe mts and charming giants to kill each other?<br/>
