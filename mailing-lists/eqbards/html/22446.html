<div id="ygrps-yiv-244327119">Thanks to all for the help.  If you&#39;re curious, below the *** is how I<br/>
opted to handle the situation.  Oh yeah and the wizard is down to a bubble<br/>
of mana at this point having just ported us out of Kithicore before the<br/>
undead got us both...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think I&#39;ll remain seated for a bit ... at least until that latest<br/>
root breaks.  Then, I&#39;ll let you gather the stuff and put it in the<br/>
bag.  I&#39;m not sure I want to be within arms reach of you at the<br/>
moment ... I can see the wheels turning in that devious little mind<br/>
or yours all way from here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go on, remain seated,&quot; the rogue mutters under her breath just as a<br/>
skeleton appears, hovering in mid air about a dozen feet behind the<br/>
meditating caster.  Beyond the hovering pile of bones, Mead&#39;s half-elven<br/>
vision picks out another skeleton approaching.  She watches and notes the<br/>
path it follows would keep it a safe distance from the elves.  Mead smiles,<br/>
a plan having been formulated.<br/>
<br/>
As Aziev studies her book, the rogue slowly, silently gets out her bow.<br/>
The wizard had allowed the Immobilize spell to drop once.  That was<br/>
mistake.  Mead had been mentally counting down to when it would break<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
15...14...13...<br/>
<br/>
Mead observes a tiny twitch in the wizard&#39;s pointy ears as she picks out<br/>
the sound of the approaching skeleton.  Then watches as the high-elf&#39;s<br/>
features relax again, having guaged by sound that the skeleton would keep<br/>
it&#39;s distance.<br/>
<br/>
11...10...9...<br/>
<br/>
Mead slowly raises the bow and takes aim.  She bites her lip in fear that<br/>
she might miss and hit Aziev by mistake.  But it is a chance she&#39;ll have to<br/>
take.<br/>
<br/>
7...6...5...<br/>
<br/>
An arrow whizzes by Azievs head, knocking the spawning skeleton out of the<br/>
air.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A-ha-ha-ha,&quot; the skeleton cackles as it charges towards the theif.<br/>
<br/>
The second skeleton hears the call and comes charging over.  &quot;A-ha-ha-ha,&quot;<br/>
the second skeleton cackles as it lays it&#39;s glowing sockets on a medding<br/>
caster.<br/>
<br/>
Mead holds her breath and braces herself for the mad dash she&#39;ll have to<br/>
make if this stunt actually works.<br/>
<br/>
3...2...<br/>
