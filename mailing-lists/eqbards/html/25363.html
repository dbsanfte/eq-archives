<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938446223">I&#39;m in total agreement.  I can&#39;t speak for solo play, but in group play we simply kick ass.  Even on raids, with the right guild that knows how to use us, we&#39;re no slouches.  Thott throws out a lot of numbers about how we don&#39;t scale well as we level, but somehow his analysis doesn&#39;t mirror my experiences on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully VI is just looking at &quot;stacking issues&quot; and not anything more grand. :)<br/>

  Ugh....<br/>
  Its funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find myself<br/>
  sometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of keeping a low<br/>
  profile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice.  Seriously, don&#39;t laugh, its just<br/>
  that bards seem very overpowered to me at higher levels, then again 60<br/>
  shaman with Can IV....  I used to think all level 60 were equally powerful<br/>
  but I&#39;m changing my thoughts.   I hope nobody else figures this out!<br/>
