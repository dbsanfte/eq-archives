 </span></blockquote>Who drops the Obsidian Shard? Where and how often does it spawn happen? is<br/>
it a rare spawn? What level is the NPC that drops it? etc? etc?<br/>
<br/>
Unrelated question: What songs/tactics does anyone recommend for Unrest?<br/>
I&#39;ve never been there, and a group around my level from my guild are going<br/>
and want me to come too - and I&#39;d rather be prepared than not... as for<br/>
thinking about it from my standpoint: I have every song a L22 bard could<br/>
own, the standard bard instruments, and my weapons are a Tentacle Whip and a<br/>
Water Crystal Staff (just got that last nite, thanks to my guilds high level<br/>
Cleric hanging out to help). Anyway, suggestions would be greatly<br/>
appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Safe Journeys!<br/>
