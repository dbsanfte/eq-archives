<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873967306"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Personally, I think it is the best<br/>
&gt;dungeon as far as appropriate loot given the amount of effort to get it.<br/>
&gt;Sure I did Najena, Unrest, MM, etc. during those levels too, but I always<br/>
&gt;came back to Sol A.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Those of you new to it be warned however, one of the reasons it has been<br/>
ignored is that it is so buggy. Expect to lose a corpse in the wall a few<br/>
times (GMs expect that call and will help, often fairly quickly), or for it<br/>
not to be where you would expect it(GM won&#39;t help). Oh and the lava, don&#39;t<br/>
fall in. No, really. :o) If you do fall in near the entrance , here is the<br/>
drill:<br/>
<br/>
GM&#39;s won&#39;t help you.<br/>
If you can&#39;t levitate, get someone who can, have them step off the stairs<br/>
and /corpse.<br/>
They will now find they can&#39;t get back up.<br/>
At the low point of the hall on the way to the swinging blade, at the wall<br/>
which, above the levitater, is the window shortcut, there is a slight step,<br/>
it is the only way (we found) to get back out of the lava.<br/>
Don&#39;t fall in the lava again.<br/>
<br/>
 We only lost one person in the lava ever, and it was because a big, rude<br/>
Barbarian literally knocked her in as they passed on the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
So, to summarize,<br/>
keep your back to the wall, don&#39;t fall in the lava. :o)<br/>
