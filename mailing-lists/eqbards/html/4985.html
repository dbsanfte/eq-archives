<div id="ygrps-yiv-88614395">This seems like a good idea now, but having just hit 17, it starts to become<br/>
a problem (sort of).  In each hotkey box we have 6 slots correct?  Now, look<br/>
at it this way - depending on the situation, I may need 3 of my four<br/>
possible instruments I also need 2 slots for weapons (dual wield is so<br/>
cool), in order to switch from my 2 weapons to an instrument I must move my<br/>
primary weapon from the primary weapon slot to the empty slot, pick up my<br/>
instrument, click on my secondary weapon residing in the secondary slot<br/>
(thus exchanging the two) and place the weapon into the now empty slot.<br/>
This idea has however crossed my mind as a MOB stuns me.  The only possible<br/>
way to do this would be if Veravt would add 2 slots to the hotkey banks, one<br/>
for my 4th instrument (brass when I finally get a song that needs it) and<br/>
the other for a second Selo&#39;s key.  Maybe that could be a request on the<br/>
bard petition?  Give it to all classes.  It can&#39;t hurt the balance of power<br/>
as I see it.  Just take away one of the banks (leaving 5) and add 2 slots to<br/>
each remaining bank.  That way everyone could have all of their spells,<br/>
special attacks, whatever in one set and use the other 4 for<br/>
weapons/instruments or whatever other classes use.  Any thoughts?<br/>
