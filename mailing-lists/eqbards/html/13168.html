<b>Subject:</b> Bard vs. Paladin, dueling. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-957005125">I had the chance to duel a Paladin the other night in Hate.<br/>
  <br/>
  At first, I just wanted him to kill me, so we could begin insertion.<br/>
  It was taking forever it seemed.  He got me down 2 bubbles, and I<br/>
  decided to lay into him.  Two yks versus his soulfire.<br/>
<br/>
  Someone here said I&#39;d get my ass stomped by a Paladin/SK.<br/>
  <br/>
  So he brought me down to two bubbles, and I started to attack<br/>
  (no songs).  And well, I had him at 3 bubbles, when I was at<br/>
  one.  And less than two bubbles before I died.<br/>
<br/>
  Granted he had LH, but I had songs I wasn&#39;t even using.  Plus,<br/>
  I noticed that Paladins (as someone mentioned) will wait til the<br/>
  last second to LH, so if you dirge them before they figure it out,<br/>
  you can finish on a high note, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
  Pretty much affirmed my understanding that a knowledgable bard<br/>
  can defeat a knowledgable paladin.  I think he even tried to Stun<br/>
  and Blind me, which I resisted with 60 base magic.  And even he yaulped<br/>
  in battle, heh.  I should duel him up again for real next time<br/>
  and tease him over /gu hehe.  Better do it before they buff up them<br/>
  Pallys.  &lt;smirk&gt;<br/>
