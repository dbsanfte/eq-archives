Subject: [eqbards] Question on &quot;Drafting&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greeting everyone I have a question on a technique called &quot;Drafting&quot;.  My<br/>
&gt; regular group of friends I group with don&#39;t want me to fall to far behind<br/>
on xp<br/>
&gt; while I am out for my son&#39;s impending birth (my wife would kill me if I<br/>
attempt<br/>
&gt; to play for the first month).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was told that with the new xp changes that you can group with a higher<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; player in my case a 53 shaman whose toons I group with would take my bard<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; group. He would then procedd to solo mobs and let me get the xp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The figures I saw (in an email) says the lower level character could<br/>
&quot;draft&quot; or<br/>
&gt; ride the xp off of the higher level shaman.  They are estimating the lower<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; would get about 40% of the xp from such a scenario.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Opinions on powerleviling and recent discussion on mediocre players aside<br/>
(I<br/>
&gt; have played EQ since it came out and have several characters in the 20&#39;s<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; 30&#39;s) would this form of powerleveling be an option? Or is the math wrong?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any input.<br/>

Since the exp needed to level goes up by the cube of the level,<br/>
but exp gained per mob is split linearly by level (in the new system)<br/>
then the lower level partner gets more exp *RELATIVE* to the<br/>
exp he needs to level than the higher level, thus &quot;drafting&quot; and<br/>
catching up.  This also means that, although characters now have<br/>
to pay their own racial exp penalty, there is a limit to how far they<br/>
will fall behind a regular grouping partner<br/>
<br/>
Unless I bungled the math it&#39;s something like<br/>
H = Human level<br/>
N = Non-Human level<br/>
R = Racial modifier for Non-Human<br/>
<br/>
If H^2/N^2 &gt;= R then the Non-Human<br/>
stops falling behind.<br/>
