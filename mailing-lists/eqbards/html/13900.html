<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470028410">Heh most classes can do that excluding melee classes. Shamans, magicians,<br/>
enchanters, clerics, and a bunch of others can clear all the spawns they<br/>
want to. Hell even a 50 bard can kill the mobs he wants to along with a<br/>
paladin to.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have you tried this?  Even L30 mobs take enough out of you<br/>
&gt;that soloing you can probably only keep 5-15 mobs clear before<br/>
&gt;they start to respawn.  (Unless you&#39;re a necro, then you can<br/>
&gt;keep all the seafury cyclopses in OOT clear solo.  :)  A L50<br/>
&gt;in a L15 dungeon like Befallen I can see killing everything<br/>
&gt;that moves, but there&#39;s really not much there to attract a<br/>
&gt;L50.  There&#39;s the paw quest, but that&#39;s easily solved by<br/>
&gt;moving that quest item to a higher level dungeon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; There is an advantage to camping a spawn area for those of us who<br/>
&gt;&gt; are interested in XP as much if not more the items... you don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; share the mobs with other groups.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You do have to share the mobs with other groups.  It&#39;s just<br/>
&gt;not obvious because it gets mixed into the time it takes your<br/>
&gt;puller to find something.  If there are 20 people in a dungeon<br/>
&gt;with 100 mobs that respawn every 30 minutes, then that&#39;s 5<br/>
&gt;mobs per person per 30 minutes.  Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;camping one spot or sweeping through.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; best place to get XP, not items.  Ever try Sol B on a crowded night?  Try<br/>
&gt;&gt; sitting in the noble room when there is a group in the circle room, pool<br/>
&gt;&gt; room and kings room.  See how many spawns you get.  Not many.  Now<br/>
 </span></blockquote>imagine a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; dungeon where the good spawns can be anywhere or there are multiples...<br/>
&gt;&gt; suddenly all those groups camping a particular area are suddenly running<br/>
&gt;&gt; around and taking any spawns anywhere rather then sticking to there own<br/>
&gt;&gt; marked off area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It will be the same - the rate at which mobs respawn has not<br/>
&gt;changed.  Better sweepers would have an advantage, but better<br/>
&gt;pullers have an advantage now.  The overall rate of mob killer<br/>
&gt;per person per hour cannot change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Also, even worse, imagine if the Goblin King in Sol A could happen to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Obviously there would be certain restrictions on location of<br/>
&gt;spawns (based on a probability gradient if it were up to me,<br/>
&gt;not yes/no :).  Wouldn&#39;t want Naggy showing up at the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Personally I kinda like the way AC handles it by restricting dungeons to<br/>
&gt;&gt; certain levels and having a lot more dungeons... if you aren&#39;t in a level<br/>
&gt;&gt; range you cannot enter.  I&#39;d also like to see all really really good<br/>

&gt;Aren&#39;t most of the magical items in AC randomly generic, like<br/>
