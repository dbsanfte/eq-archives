<b>Subject:</b> Lullaby vs Pixie (was Charm) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465862312">Just wondering why you wouldn&#39;t use Lullaby over Pixie in this situation<br/>
(assuming you aren&#39;t trying to interrupt any casters).  I&#39;m not high enough<br/>
level to sing Pixie yet so can&#39;t speak from experience.  It just seems that<br/>
it would be harder and more time consuming to target the three mobs in<br/>
combat versus singing the Lullaby and not worrying about targetting.  Do<br/>
mobs have a higher resist rate versus Lullaby than Pixie?  If so thats an<br/>
obvious reason to use Pixie.  I assume the duration of the two are close to<br/>
the same.   Please provide clarification for us junior bards:-)<br/>

&gt; Strike the first one 5-7 times before one finally &quot;sticks.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Only then can I move on to trying to get one to stick to the<br/>
&gt; second, which means another 5-7 tries while keeping the first<br/>
&gt; one refreshed.  By this time my cleric is dead from having the<br/>
&gt; 2 other mobs beating on him while I futzed around with the<br/>
&gt; first one.  That is what makes this song broken and virtually<br/>
&gt; useless.  Given the high &quot;false failure&quot; rate, I found it more<br/>
&gt; effective to just charm the thing and remove its damage from<br/>
&gt; the fight on the first try.<br/>
