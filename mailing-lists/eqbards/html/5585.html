with all those bodies around), and just buff and/or Strike the<br/>
other mobs.  It never seems to work out that way though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Additionally, the chains act as a major taunt, which is sometimes good but<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I think the amount of taunt is about this same,<br/>
except Chain gets cast over and over, while Snare you only<br/>
need to cast once.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and never have it aggro on him very easily. Additioanly, snare (NOT<br/>
&gt; ensnare) last a guaranteed, set time varying with level. Once they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; snared, there&#39;s no chance of that mob breaking free until that set time<br/>
&gt; has passed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  Didn&#39;t know that - that would change strategies<br/>
considerably.  Can you &quot;refresh&quot; the snare before this period<br/>
is up by recasting it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; It&#39;s better than relying on casters to snare/root because you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can chase mobs while singing this song - they can&#39;t while<br/>
&gt; &gt; casting snare/root.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, it&#39;s MUCH better to rely on casters to snare. Why? Because chains has<br/>
&gt; to be cast while the runner is trying to run -- one failure and it&#39;s time<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>???  You can Chain something that&#39;s already Chained.  If we&#39;re<br/>
in a dangerous situation and can&#39;t afford runners, I start to<br/>
Chain a couple rounds before it should begin to run.  If it&#39;s<br/>
a yellow or red mob with a high chance of resisting, I just<br/>
keep Chaining it over and over after that.  I&#39;ve had just two<br/>
mobs (red) get away from me in the last month or so of doing<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to evac. Snare can be cast on all the mobs at the beginning of the battle,<br/>
&gt; without making the mobs attack the snarer. You then no longer have to<br/>
&gt; worry about mobs escaping. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said, I&#39;m constantly Chaining stuff that starts to run<br/>
when the snare expires.  At that point, you can still Chain<br/>
while chasing the mob.  Casters need to stand still to<br/>
snare/root it again.  So Chain is often the *only* option.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But a bard who chains snared mobs is likely to get kicked out of many<br/>
&gt; groups after getting them all killed a few times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe it changes at higher levels.  Nearly all the recent bad<br/>
situations I&#39;ve gotten into involving runners was when I<br/>
relied on a druid or ranger to snare and didn&#39;t bother<br/>
Chaining.<br/>
