<div id="ygrps-yiv-713953816">I have never used that song on myself, but I used yesterday many times on <br/>
some Sol Mage (trying to get my lambent boots) and it works.  I used it to <br/>
pull them by stunning them first, and I run back to my safe spot invis and <br/>
wait for it to come.  I also used it to interrupt his spells.  I also used <br/>
it at Lower Guk a few days ago (Friday night I think) against Zol and Dar <br/>
ghoul frogloks, it works well.  I can hold them for like minutes so our <br/>
group could break up the camp.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think they Up&#39;ed the mob resist rate.  Not the resist messages, <br/>
but the way that they break the trance even when the song went thru.  I am <br/>
at lv50 so maybe at lower level this will be worst.<br/>

&gt;Try it on yourself.  Most of the time you will get the &quot;you<br/>
&gt;send forth music&quot; message and icon, but will not be stunned.<br/>
&gt;If you wait for the icon to disappear, you will get the &quot;you<br/>
&gt;are no longer stunned&quot; message even though you were never<br/>
&gt;stunned!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It *is* broken. </span></blockquote></div>
