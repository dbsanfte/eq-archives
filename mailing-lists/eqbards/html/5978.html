<div id="ygrps-yiv-29444606"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;WARNING! If a GM sees you up there, he may think you<br/>
&gt;are using a known exploit.  (No, I will not divulge<br/>
&gt;the nature of the exploit).  Consider yerselves warned,<br/>
&gt;you nosy curious explorer-types (wait.... that like,<br/>
&gt;perfectly defines Bards.... Go fig.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is another way of getting on the rooftops that<br/>
doesn&#39;t include an exploit. I can assure you that if<br/>
a GM approaches you and asks how you got up there, and<br/>
you tell him either of these ways you won&#39;t get<br/>
banned or scolded.<br/>
<br/>
You can either go via the way mentioned above, or you<br/>
can do it by jumping on the top of the door of the bank,<br/>
turning around, jumping on top of the rocks and then<br/>
onto the closest building. You can also do it via the<br/>
levitate spell in various areas of Freeport. <br/>
<br/>
Regardless, I would nearly guarantee that if you were<br/>
to &#39;accidentally&#39; fall of the world by being up there<br/>
you could count on the fact that there would be no<br/>
help from a GM or guide. But that&#39;s just my guess.</div>
