<b>Subject:</b> RE: Lava swimming vs dieing  was Bard vs Wizard race? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-111828812">I died my first time in Sol-A - fell off the ramp going up to the zone and<br/>
died in the lava.  How you guys can swim in ot is beyond me - and I was<br/>
badly beaten up at he time.  <br/>
<br/>
My fiends were able to levitate over the lava and get a loc on me.  They<br/>
clicked and corpsed and eventually were able to pull me out.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as GM&#39;s getting you out, sometime they will and sometimes they wont.<br/>
One friend lost all her stuff (lots of crafted too) - dunno if she could<br/>
have/should have just gotten another GM.<br/>

		&gt; That said I&#39;m still glad the time I lost my corpse to a<br/>
fire giant<br/>

my corpse to<br/>

lava where I<br/>

<br/>
		Yeah, I tried to help some cleric who&#39;d lost his corpse in<br/>
the<br/>
		lava in Sol A.  He was even trusting enough to /consent to<br/>
me.<br/>
		My song pointed me down a lava ledge and I couldn&#39;t see a<br/>
way<br/>
		out (past the little &quot;window&quot; that looks into lava at the<br/>
top<br/>
		of the curved stairs near the entrance to Sol A).  I assume<br/>
it<br/>
		leads to Sol B, but being one-way there was no way I could<br/>
		drag his corpse back to him.  Eventually a GM got his corpse<br/>
		for him.<br/>
