&gt; pathing exploits people found in there in the last patch, because we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; been fighting there many times before the patch without this happening.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We went in Sebilis in the firsts week of Kunark and, that Mushroom poped on us at the bridge. So it is not<br/>
a patch effect, it is just poor testing from Verant. If it ever happen to your group again, i would<br/>
suggest /bug&#39;ing it.<br/>
<br/>
Now we just make sure we don&#39;t fight/stay at the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
