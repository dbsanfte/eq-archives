<br/>
&gt; Anyway, just to correct a post someone made yesterday or the day before:<br/>
&gt; The Obsidian Scimitar has no proc but is + 6 AGI or DEX (I forget which)<br/>
&gt; The Obsidian Shard has the proc - which is resisted WAY too much in my<br/>
&gt; opinion, so if you get one, don&#39;t expect it to become the uber-poker you<br/>
&gt; thought it could be hehe.  I personally was very disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Forgive me if this was covered already but at level 43 I&#39;m STILL using the<br/>
shard.<br/>
<br/>
Sol A and Sol B are full of creatures that have high fire resist so you<br/>
should be aware that those two zones the Shard won&#39;t be as useful, but I&#39;ve<br/>
found taht the closer to green the kobolds are in Sol B, the less the shard<br/>
is resisted.  I hardly ever get resists in guk or outdoor zones.  This is a<br/>
great weapon because of the proc, especially when combined with an ugly<br/>
stick.  Since my regular group doesn&#39;t have an every day tank, I have to be<br/>
ready to do enough damage to take a beating and this is hte best combo I&#39;ve<br/>
found.<br/>
