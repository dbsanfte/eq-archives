<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805558995">There is a bug that MAKE you swim even though you are sitting on the boat.  <br/>
Sometime you will see people swimming in midair.  I think that&#39;s why your <br/>
STA is losing.  That&#39;s probably why you were losing Stamina on the boat.<br/>

&gt;   I had the same problem on Erollisi Marr yesterday.  I took the boat from <br/>
&gt;Freeport to BB and found that just sitting, my stamina went down a bubble <br/>
&gt;at a time.  Needless to say I started singing Jaxan&#39;s just in case I fell <br/>
&gt;off the boat (which was unlikely because I wasn&#39;t moving) and had to swim <br/>
&gt;for a while.  There were 8 people on the boat and I could only see 2 and <br/>
&gt;talk to none.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The stamina hit has never happened to me during boat travel before.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I left my bard on the dock in BB.  Now I&#39;m rather afraid to take him <br/>
&gt;back to Freeport via boat.  I&#39;m thinking about going to the bank in Kaladim <br/>
&gt;and then using the &quot;poor man&#39;s gate&quot; (death) to get back.  Any suggestions?<br/>

&gt;   Yesterday afternoon on the Rathe server, my magician was travelling from <br/>
&gt;BB to Freeport.  There were 5 people in the zone, none of which were bards. <br/>
&gt;  When we entered the OOT, no one was there, and no one heard me when I <br/>
&gt;/say&#39;d.  My roomie told me that she didn&#39;t hear or see me (also on the <br/>
&gt;boat).  Later in the trip, still in the OOT, one person showed up, but <br/>
&gt;still no one saw my /say.  We chatted in /ooc though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   BTW, on the boat, fully fed and watered, my mage completely ran out of <br/>
&gt;stamina on the trip.  Earlier in the day I took my bard over, and when I <br/>
&gt;hit 1/2, I started singing the Jaxan&#39;s to bring it back up (I was alone on <br/>
&gt;the boat), which worked.<br/>
