<div id="ygrps-yiv-94618185">Reading the 76 or so messages in my mailbox, (after one day on onelist) I<br/>
have discovered the main reason for my near encumberance   A minotaur axe,<br/>
and a Shiney Brass sheild add up to about 18 weight if I remember correctly.<br/>
replacing the axe with a dirk should easily help me out, thank you for<br/>
everyone&#39;s help. But is there a good light weight 1H slash weapon I could<br/>
afford (around 50plat on me), I would still like to level 1H slash.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. My Bio is long, and states a portion of my Guild&#39;s charter.  which I<br/>
made up )<br/>
<br/>
p.p.s. I always ask people if I can inspect their wares, but if I have some<br/>
items for sale I will check out lower level char&#39;s stuff on a whim, to see<br/>
if they would need whatever I had</div>
