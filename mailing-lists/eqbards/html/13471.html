<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-18664211">If you were referring to the previous post by Naeeldar about procs still<br/>
working as expected then it doesn&#39;t apply.  He was referrring to procs with<br/>
his necro and not his bard.  I think every bard who has posted has noticed a<br/>
decrease in procs after the patch.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m not too concerned yet, but did anyone else playing last <br/>
&gt; &gt; night notice a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;staggering drop in the number of procs that their weapons <br/>
&gt; &gt; are firing? </span></blockquote></div>
