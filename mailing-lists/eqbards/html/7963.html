<div id="ygrps-yiv-494089921">Just what is the range of a Screech?  I just got it and was testing it on <br/>
goblins in Misty and Beholder, and it seems to me that it only works on <br/>
stuff very close to immediate melee range.  It seemed to be a very <br/>
small area.  Is this true?  Or does it take awhile to kick in?  Or does <br/>
range increase with level?  I did enjoy watching four goblins drop <br/>
everything and flee in terror.  Hehe.<br/>
