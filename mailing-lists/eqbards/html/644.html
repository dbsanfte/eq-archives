&gt;It totally depends on what you are fighting and when.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For Soloing:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When fighting monsters I could easily defeat, I would bellow nonstop (no<br/>
&gt;stacking).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Keep Anthem or Warsong running, I think you&#39;ll find you do more damage.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Around level 20-21, I started having a lot of problems fighting monsters<br/>
that<br/>
&gt;were &quot;dangerous.&quot;  I began to twist healing and warsong, to 1) make me kill<br/>
&gt;faster<br/>
<br/>
I stopped singing Hymn in combat at about 15th, the damage dished out was<br/>
coming so much faster than it could keep up with, I found it best just to<br/>
make the mob dead dead dead as fast as possible.<br/>
<br/>
At 20th, I started using Melodic Binding a great deal.  Excellent spell,<br/>
group or solo.  Same basic effect as drowsy, and it drops AC as well.  Means<br/>
I take less hits, and hit the critter harder.  That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Some later songs made soloing a LOT easier, but I won&#39;t give away all my<br/>
secrets.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;and 2) make me live longer.  When the mobs got down to 1/3 to 1/4 life, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;switch to bellows and warsong (if my health was okay)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For Partying:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Melee:<br/>
&gt;I would take preferance to singing Anthem, and switch to healing (and step<br/>
&gt;back from the fight to avoid the shit list effect) with my mandolin.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, when we&#39;re getting hit in excess of 60 points per swing, even<br/>
with my 11 per tick with a lute, it&#39;s not worth the loss of my blades.  Dead<br/>
mobs give you plenty of time to heal.  Live ones don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fighting magic users:<br/>
&gt;I would sing/twist the rhythm songs (to boost resistances) and anthem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Found that the Rhythm/Psalm series didn&#39;t do our group much good.  Even with<br/>
percussion, and hitting 50 MR, we were still getting smacked around by<br/>
spells.  And every two seconds of melee I miss using an instrument means<br/>
about 25 more damage the rest of my party has to make up.<br/>
<br/>
Switched to an old standby instead..Lucid Lullaby.  I&#39;d rather the caster<br/>
not cast, than take my chances resisting the spell.  Lullaby does an<br/>
excellent job interupting the casters.<br/>
<br/>
