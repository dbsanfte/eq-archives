<div id="ygrps-yiv-905912628">One odd interaction is that Chant of Battle will over-write and block<br/>
Provocation.  I heard that Provocation will stack with Warsong though.  Did<br/>
not get a chance to check that.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] The new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Decided to give this song a whirl last night.  Went to the <br/>
&gt; yeti caves in<br/>
&gt; Dreadlands and Lament pulled a single yeti (blue con) outside.  Weaved<br/>
&gt; Jonthan&#39;s, Chains and Fear.  For the first time in a long time, I solo<br/>
&gt; tanked a mob to death.  The haste with Jonthan&#39;s is <br/>
&gt; tremendous.  I would<br/>
&gt; estimate it is close to enchanter&#39;s SLW.  The only time I <br/>
&gt; ever got hit was<br/>
&gt; when fear broke early.  Most fights I would only lose one bub <br/>
&gt; of health, two<br/>
&gt; if I was really unlucky.  Tried the same tactic with a <br/>
&gt; stonegazer cockatrice<br/>
&gt; with similar results.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So the new version of Jonthan&#39;s Provocation looks like it <br/>
&gt; will help us solo<br/>
&gt; blue mobs tremendously.  If it still included the rune <br/>
&gt; shield, soloing would<br/>
&gt; be even easier coz there would be less downtime for healing.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One drawback that I did notice was it didn&#39;t stack with <br/>
&gt; Berserker (and I<br/>
&gt; assume our other combat enhancing songs) for other party <br/>
&gt; members.  Since<br/>
&gt; Jonthan&#39;s Provocation is self only, other songs like <br/>
&gt; Berserker should still<br/>
&gt; affect everyone in the group beside the bard.  This is not <br/>
&gt; the case.  I<br/>
&gt; tested it by starting Jonthan&#39;s, then starting Berserker.  I asked the<br/>
&gt; others in my party if they were getting the message &quot;You go <br/>
&gt; berserk&quot; as well<br/>
&gt; as an icon on the screen.  As long as I had Jonthan&#39;s in <br/>
&gt; effect on myself,<br/>
&gt; no one else in the party got the benefit of Berserker.  This <br/>
&gt; sounds like a<br/>
&gt; bug to me.<br/>
