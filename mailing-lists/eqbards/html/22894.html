--------------------------------------<br/>
We have made some changes to the way movement enhancement/reduction works.<br/>
Essentially, Root and Snare are now completely different spells. This means<br/>
that Root will suppress snare, but it will not overwrite it. That&#39;s the<br/>
primary change. But there is also a side effect to this change. <br/>
Bard songs will no longer break root. Root will also suppress songs that<br/>
enhance movement. <br/>
We are aware that this will be seen as a &#39;nerf&#39;. However, I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
that most of you understood that bard songs were never intended to break<br/>
root, and this is, in fact, essentially a bug fix. <br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It is pretty bad when I read something like this and think &quot;Great, now our<br/>
chaining songs are going to be messed up because they forgot to test it on<br/>
bards&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One thing this does demonstrate is that &quot;movement&quot; type spell effects can be<br/>
segregated...so why can they move bard song into a class of its own?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I really dont consider this a nerf since Verant has been saying for 2<br/>
years that bard songs should NOT break root.<br/>
