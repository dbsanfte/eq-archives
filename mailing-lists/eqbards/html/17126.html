&gt; You don&#39;t understand.  I&#39;ve already done all that, made those<br/>
&gt; decisions and adjustments countless times, and figured out<br/>
&gt; near-optimal solutions.  Starting a twink would just be<br/>
&gt; treading the same ground.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m for the<br/>
&gt; most part unable to do any of the things that made the bard<br/>
&gt; fun in the mid-levels.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, how many deaths would it take for you to get back to level 26? Heh.<br/>
You&#39;d have some nice armor and items and a lot of useless songs.  But then<br/>
they seem to be pretty useless to you now?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (I&#39;d say more, but then this would<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you opened the box, they kinda described this (the class and level<br/>
system) did they not?  It&#39;s not something they changed in the past year is<br/>
it?  And its not anything they plan on changing.<br/>
<br/>
I guess alot of people who focus on the get next level aspect feel the level<br/>
50 dissappointment.  Unless you have a very active guild, or are really into<br/>
role playing and socializing with other players, there is not a lot to do.<br/>
At least not the &quot;let&#39;s get a group and go somewhere&quot; options.  Go do a<br/>
plane or a dragon, lose a few bubs and come back and camp Cyndy for 8 hours.<br/>
Rinse, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what they ought to have is some zones where monsters dynamically<br/>
adjust to your level when you engage them.  Then it would be geography and<br/>
tactics more than simple level difference.  Loot would have to load (or<br/>
drop) dymanically and that is very different from how EQ is designed right<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe - sad as it seems - the game is over.  Here I am only a few bubs from<br/>
that magic number.  On one hand, I am focusing all my attention on getting<br/>
the big 50.  On the other hand I am wondering why?  And an expansion with<br/>
every level a hell level?  Hmm not very apealling thought.<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about it - what is missing is the role-playing and/or<br/>
scenario or plot.  Supposedly there is some history and lore out there.<br/>
Mayong and bards?  Why are their factions related?  Where is some<br/>
significant quest type thing for your group to do over the course of a<br/>
couple weeks or month that has some reward?  And I think the potential is<br/>
there for on going interest even in the finite world of norrath but it takes<br/>
more people interaction to have that.  So, far 90% of this game is you vs<br/>
NPC&#39;s in endless hours of boredom - all for the sake of filling the yellow<br/>
bard and making a ding.  And you do it because its there. bcause your<br/>
friends are doing it. &quot;Loot does not matter.&quot;  &quot;Exp & Leveling dont matter&quot;<br/>
ROFLOL! Thats all that matters.<br/>
<br/>
PvP or Teams servers has a greater potential for plot based scenarios or<br/>
quests.  Verant could do things to drive those and the game would change<br/>
dramatically when you battle PC&#39;s instead of NPC&#39;s.<br/>
