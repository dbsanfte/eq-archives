<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682534523">Got my 4th coin for the tambourine quest today in Emerald jungle.<br/>
<br/>
Two coins left... the kaesora coin and the dalnir coin.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate any stories/remembrances from anyone getting these <br/>
coins.  Looks like I need 40 - 45 lvl group to get either, but how much <br/>
luck have people had by just shouting from zone in either place?<br/>
<br/>
any info appreciated.  Really looking forward to that tambourine<br/>
