Okay, so maybe you didn&#39;t come up with the worst case scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Who cares anyhow, there are no bards in Star Wars.  <br/>
<br/>
I think Verant major league blew it when they chose Star Wars over Star Trek<br/>
to do as their MMORPG for sci-fi.  Star Trek lends itself much more easily<br/>
universe concept-wise to an MMORPG than Star Wars does.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Verant and Star Wars OT (was Official confirmation<br/>
from Ester)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not usually a pessimist but I think the future of MMORPGs may take a<br/>
potential serious hit when Star Wars Online comes out.  My reasonings why<br/>
are all assumptions:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Assume Verant will have same problems in terms of customer service and<br/>
game balance that they have had with EQ.  Their track record is the basis<br/>
for this assumption.  Only way I see improvement in this arena is if<br/>
LucasArts handles this responsibility or holds Verant&#39;s feet to the fire.<br/>
<br/>
2)  The Star Wars movies are all about special individuals performing heroic<br/>
events.  These events took place in both on land and space.  Gonna be really<br/>
hard to include both aspects of gameplay in one game.  Some people will want<br/>
to be Jedi Knights, who will likely spend most of their time on land doing<br/>
special missions/quests.  Others will want to be fighter pilots, making<br/>
attack runs on things like the Death Star and Imperial capital ships.  No<br/>
idea how they will handle the players who want to be diplomats or smugglers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3)  The Star Wars universe spans numerous worlds.  The settings for the<br/>
movies were on three of these worlds.  The follow on books expanded the<br/>
universe.  Most MMORPGs take place on one world (Norrath, Sosaria, Dereth<br/>
etc).  So for SWO to capture the spirit of the movies and books, events will<br/>
have to span multiple worlds.  My guess is that everything will take place<br/>
on Coruscant and that it will be very similar to Anarchy Online (OmniTek<br/>
corporation vs Rebels).  <br/>
<br/>
4)  By franchise name alone, SWO will attract a lot of new players into the<br/>
MMORPG genre.  Unless they spend a lot of time following gaming websites,<br/>
these new players will have no idea of Verant&#39;s reputation with EQ.  They<br/>
will buy the game expecting to be able to perform like like their favorite<br/>
Star Wars characters.  IMO, this will turn out to be a major disappointment<br/>
for most of them.  Don&#39;t expect most of these new gamers to maintain their<br/>
subscription.<br/>
<br/>
5)  So the end result is that the most hyped MMORPG up to date based on the<br/>
most popular movie franchise of all time will likely be a failure in terms<br/>
of gameplay.  Potential investors in future MMORPGs will know that SWO was<br/>
not successful.  They may not be inclined to invest in future MMORPGs based<br/>
on the poor outcome of SWO.  <br/>
<br/>
I admit this is all worst case scenario.  Definately a possibility though.<br/>
If it does occur, sure hope NWN turns out to be as good as it promises.<br/>

I could not agree more.<br/>
<br/>
Verant will pay for what it does when it comes out with Star Wars and EQ2.<br/>
People are too ingrained in EQ to leave just for &quot;bad attitude&quot; (ofr the<br/>
most part, obviously a few ARE leaving).<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way.  You or your guild guild decides to go to a Sci-Fi<br/>
setting game next.  Anarachy Online and Star Wars are sitting there on the<br/>
shelf next to each other.  You&#39;ve heard mixed reveiws for both products.<br/>
<br/>
Which one are you going to try first?<br/>
<br/>
Repeat the same situation for Shadowbane and EQ2.<br/>
