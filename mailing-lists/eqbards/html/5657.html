<b>Subject:</b> DoTs and Kiting: Not Changed Yet <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-250421639">Well, I can say for certain that as of last night, no change had been made <br/>
to our Chords of Dissonance.  I used it to kite a few groups of beetles <br/>
(from 4 to 6 at a time) in North Karana, and it worked just like always: run <br/>
by the group, pulse Chords, run away and heal while their health drops <br/>
steadily.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, either Verant has not yet implemented the DoT &quot;advancing monster&quot; <br/>
nonsense on the production servers, or they are not including bards (or at <br/>
least Chords of Dissonance) in this restriction (oh please oh please).  I&#39;d <br/>
put my money on the former.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about you folks, but I have always thought that running into a <br/>
group of nasties, pulsing Chords, and then running away playing a medley of <br/>
Hymn and Selo&#39;s was a very useful and viable tactic despite the danger (you <br/>
WILL take damage when you go in to use Chords with most MOBs).  Now <br/>
apparently Verant is deciding it&#39;s an exploit.  Oh, I get it... it&#39;s a bug <br/>
that the monsters aren&#39;t as fast as us?  If they had better AI and tried to <br/>
run away instead of chasing us as we killed them, that would solve the <br/>
problem nicely... at least we&#39;d have a much harder time kiting groups, if <br/>
they split up.  On the other hand, it would be easier to kite those single <br/>
MOBs, as they&#39;d be running away giving us plenty of time to improve our <br/>
melee skills and sing them to death.  I see this an another excellent <br/>
example of Verant trying to limit the way we play the game without thinking <br/>
through all the repercussions.  They want us to group, so every viable <br/>
soloing strategy will slowly be whittled away, regardless of the effects <br/>
these changes have on 1) the internal consistency (i.e. believability) of <br/>
the world, or 2) other perfectly &quot;legal&quot; actions.<br/>
<br/>
May your feet ever be fleet,<br/>
And your voices ever be sweet.<br/>
