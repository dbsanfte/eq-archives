<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031429163">My guild raided Droga this weekend and I got a Whistling Dagger (6/25 1AC<br/>
bard only).  Pretty wimpy weapon based on the difficulty required to get it.<br/>
By the time you are high enough level to kill the mob that drops it, you<br/>
almost certainly already have a better weapon than this.<br/>
<br/>
I checked the spoilers sites and EQLizer lists this weapon as dropping in<br/>
Mines of Nurga, not Droga.  Supposedly Sainy&#39;s Singing Dagger (7/22 procs<br/>
Symphonic Harmony) drops in Droga, which would be more appropriate in<br/>
regards to risk/reward.  I heard a rumor that the SSD was dropping when<br/>
Kunark first came out but it was since removed from the drop table for some<br/>
reason.  I&#39;m guessing the Whistling Dagger was put into its place and now<br/>
drops in both Droga and Nurga.  Does anyone know the real deal on this?  If<br/>
the SSD is still dropped in Droga, does anyone know what mob drops it and<br/>
its location?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
