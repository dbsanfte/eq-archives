&gt; Is this the same Squire that drops the Collar of Undead Protection?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Crier Sharpsong - 34th song bard on Fennin Ro<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; in upper guk, the squire if i  remember correctly. i camped that<br/>
&gt; &gt; SOB so long<br/>
&gt; &gt; and hadnt gotten a stupid fork, that and the troll belt. And as soon as<br/>
&gt; i<br/>
&gt; &gt; leave, my buddies are running to do a corpse retrieval to lower<br/>
&gt; &gt; guk and got<br/>
&gt; &gt; both the fork and belt (warden)  for me. Talk about luck hehe.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the other night i was coming back from lower guk and killed the<br/>
&gt; squire<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he had a fork on him, did a shout to the zone of a free fork, sadly<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; rotted away since i allready had one<br/>
