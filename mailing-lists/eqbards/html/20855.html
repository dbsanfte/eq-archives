<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In my experience, 2 bards in one hunting - not ressing - <br/>
&gt; party was a waste<br/>
&gt; of a slot. And 3 bards in a hunting party meant certain <br/>
&gt; death. With 4 bards,<br/>
&gt; I would simply /shudder but have never had that experience.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the casters don&#39;t mind. I see nothing wrong with a group that has<br/>
three bards, one healer and two boomers. The bards tank, with one singing a<br/>
few songs while the other two just sing clarity. <br/>
<br/>
There is an old National Lampoon cartoon about a planet where there were<br/>
like 17 sexes instead of two. The cartoon follows this group as they go<br/>
through hell and high water to have a one night stand. A scenario lived<br/>
nightly by those in EQ trying to build the perfect group *smile* <br/>

&gt; (was that W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Groucho on being invited into some hollywood organization (RL, not a movie I<br/>
think) &quot;I don&#39;t want to join any organization that would have me as a<br/>
member.&quot; <br/>
