<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree vehemently.  Griffennes are camped nearly 24/7 on E&#39;ci regardless<br/>
of the No Drop nature of the bard and shaman required items.  Only<br/>
difference is most people leave them on the corpses for free.  If Griffenes<br/>
were even remotely rare, you&#39;d never see one cause they are worth good xp.<br/>
I see more dead Shin corpses in L Guk with No drop stuff rotting on them<br/>
than I do ones waiting to be killed.  way more, again cause they are worth<br/>
good xp and easy to single out.<br/>
<br/>
The only difference is the items lay around for free.  The mobs are not<br/>
waiting around for some needy bard to come along and kill them.  Same with<br/>
shamans needing mammoth ribs.  has mammoth killing suddenly ceased because<br/>
they have a No drop shaman quest item, of course not.  The reason no one<br/>
sells lambent is it is not worth the effort.  To get a piece of lambent you<br/>
have to spend a couple hundred plat on gems, go to at least three different<br/>
zones to hunt things, and find a buyer.  The money produced per time unit is<br/>
ridiculously bad compared to camping for a non-lore magic item you can sell<br/>
for the same amount.  Don&#39;t assume cause and effect occur and are related.<br/>
The &#39;cause&#39; of Lambent quest items being No drop has no correlation to the<br/>
&#39;result&#39; of Lambent armor not being sold.  When was the last time you saw a<br/>
Rain Caller for sale?  It&#39;s not No Drop.  The quest is however a pain in the<br/>
neck that takes a long time and much effort to solve.  I&#39;m still working on<br/>
it, but at least I have the Fairy Dust now.  How about crafted?  those quest<br/>
items ae No drop but it is sold all the time.  Why?  Because the Crafted<br/>
quests require a heck of a lot less running around.  I haven&#39;t been to an<br/>
auction since about a week after the quests were implemented where crafted<br/>
wasn&#39;t for sale, and being sold successfully.  I have sold 2 pieces myself<br/>
and traded one to a guildmate.  All for profit.  No drop quest items did<br/>
absolutely nothing to deter me from doing so.  I doubt the warrior market is<br/>
any bigger than the bard market.  I&#39;ve likewise made 2 pieces of shaman<br/>
armor so far and traded them to guildmates for other stuff I could use.<br/>
Again No Drop did nothing to deter me.  If however, the armor itself had<br/>
been No drop what would have changed?  I wouldn&#39;t have done the quests<br/>
probably, and my Shaman guildmates wouldn&#39;t have the armor.  Did I deprive<br/>
any poor Shamans of getting their piece of armor?  Nope, there were zero<br/>
shamans hunting tentacle terrors in Najena or Mammoths in everfrost when I<br/>
got my pieces, cause if there had been I&#39;d have let them loot the items.<br/>
Why were there zero Shamans hunting these things?  Because the quest is<br/>
involved, takes a lot of travelling, and they didn&#39;t think it worth the<br/>
trouble.  Totemic Gloves were not worth the time to the shaman&#39;s in my<br/>
guild, but they were worth the cost of the Dufrenite plus a decent magic<br/>
item I could only get if I camped some spawn point for hours.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest I am glad the quest items are No Drop because it means someone<br/>
does have to do all the running themselves to get the item.  Not necessarily<br/>
the Shaman though.  If some shaman wanted to trade me Lambent for Totemic<br/>
I&#39;d be ecstatic, but they don&#39;t want to do all that running.  So maybe you<br/>
have convinced me that No drop does do something if used in the intermediate<br/>
stages of a quest.  It ensures that people who really enjoy doing quests and<br/>
travelling will be able to complete them.  To make the reward No drop as<br/>
well so that I could gain no benefit from the quest would deprive me of the<br/>
challenge I most enjoy in this game.  In fact, it has already tempted me to<br/>
quit as more and more quests produce No Drop items.  Believe me though when<br/>
I say this, It is the complex, involved, time-consuming nature of the quests<br/>
that prevent the wizard Ks&#39;ers from doing them in order to sell the final<br/>
product.  Not the fact that the intermediate items are No drop.  If<br/>
anything, the No Drop nature of the intermediate items increases the market<br/>
for the final product, because buyers/traders know they can&#39;t just buy the<br/>
intermediate items in one location and do the quest themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line.  <br/>
<br/>
Make intermediate items No Drop, that will not prevent anyone who wants to<br/>
do quests from doing them but will ensure whoever does the quest will have<br/>
to do all the running around themselves, i.e. someone will have to spend<br/>
time doing this.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make the rewards No Drop because it isn&#39;t necessary to prevent someone<br/>
from selling the item for ridiculous prices or preventing legitimate item<br/>
users from getting the items.  Making the quest even slightly complex with<br/>
time consuming travelling will ensure this never happens, the people who<br/>
engage in those sort of activities are way too lazy to get involved in<br/>
anything like this.<br/>
<br/>
The Shining Star of Light quest is the easiest quest for a magic weapon in<br/>
the game.  I can regularly sell them for 50-75pp nonetheless.  The people<br/>
that buy them could usually do the quest themselves in their sleep, but they<br/>
aren&#39;t interested in all that running around, all that interacting with<br/>
npc&#39;s.  They just want to kill things, plain and simple.  Despite having<br/>
regularly sold SSoL&#39;s at auction, I rarely see anyone else selling one.  If<br/>
those KS&#39;ing wizards can&#39;t be bothered to do an incredibly simple quest like<br/>
this, why would you think they&#39;d ever do a more involved Lambent one?  Even<br/>
more ridiculously, I can sell 4 pairs of bear Hide boots at every auction if<br/>
I cared to.  Very few if any other people do so, yet they sell for 5-10pp<br/>
and cost less than 2pp to get.  You don&#39;t even have to travel across zones<br/>
to do it and few can be bothered.  so if you want to make intermediate items<br/>
No Drop, more power to you and Verant, but don&#39;t make the final result No<br/>
Drop because making the final result No Drop solves nothing and only hurts<br/>
those who enjoy doing whatever quest comes their way and are happy to<br/>
receive the reward they get.<br/>
