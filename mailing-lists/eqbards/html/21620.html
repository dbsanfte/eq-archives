<div id="ygrps-yiv-277613916">It works best in places where you don&#39;t have two mobs to charm or cannot<br/>
afford stuff to be running around for one reason or another.  I did find it<br/>
more effective than non-charm kiting due to the fact the DoT did full damage<br/>
the whole time.  Charm kiting would still be more effective where possible.<br/>
The DoT seemed to prevent the charmed mob from healing at a faster rate.<br/>

if you had a sow and a wide open area this would hardly be the best way to<br/>
kill stuff.<br/>
