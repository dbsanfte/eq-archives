&gt; I&#39;ve always had a problem with our damage shields actually.  <br/>
&gt; Unless you are<br/>
&gt; being attacked by multiple mobs, which with an enchanter <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t happen too<br/>
&gt; often, the damage output of the shields is sub-par.  We have <br/>
&gt; several other<br/>
&gt; options which produce more damage per 6 second pulse.  About <br/>
&gt; the only time<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve used the damage shields was in multi-bard groups.  <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s almost<br/>
&gt; always a better song to play than a damage shield, heck there probably<br/>
&gt; always is a better song unless you&#39;re just wading thru greenies.<br/>

&gt; I dont know if I would pick those songs (what level bard? <br/>
&gt; depends on what<br/>
&gt; choices were available) but they are not that far off base:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also <br/>
&gt; reduces the mob&#39;s MR<br/>
&gt; (if anything, lead with Fufils so next thing sticks better.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Psalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk <br/>
&gt; and the damage<br/>
&gt; shield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a thought,<br/>

&gt; Heh with my cleric (who normally plays only in his regular <br/>
&gt; group, but with<br/>
&gt; my play I have missed several sessions and need to catch up), <br/>
&gt; I was gfrouped<br/>
&gt; with a monk and a bard in L Guk (&quot;How long could it take for <br/>
&gt; us to tfind a<br/>
&gt; tank, lets get the ass sup camp while we wait&quot;).  The bard <br/>
&gt; was singing the<br/>
&gt; oddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no <br/>
&gt; snarer or slower),<br/>
&gt; Curtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh???? <br/>
&gt;  I suggested<br/>
&gt; singing celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>
&gt; anything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.  <br/>
&gt; Oddly she was<br/>
&gt; quite competent at crowd control.  With Pixie she was keeping <br/>
&gt; 2 mobs at bay<br/>
&gt; with no trouble...<br/>
