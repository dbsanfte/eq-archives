<div id="ygrps-yiv-704390641">I&#39;m not on Tunare - but I&#39;m curious why you&#39;d want to be in a Bard-only<br/>
guild. In my opinion - the biggest advantage of a guild is to more easily<br/>
find people at similar level; to group with.  I have had some success in<br/>
larger groups with another bard; but the couple of times I&#39;d been in a group<br/>
with two other bards - I felt I&#39;d have been better off with a more diverse<br/>
group.  I&#39;m a big proponent of &quot;combined arms&quot; tactics...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in a couple of guilds - and I actually like the fact that in my<br/>
current guild - I&#39;m the only bard (makes my services to be in very high<br/>
demand!)<br/>

&gt; Hello.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got my bard up to 10th level now, and really enjoy playing him.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; wondering if there&#39;s any sort of guild, or at least network of bards on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Tunare server.  I would think that bards would like to form a guild, since<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re one of the more unique types of classes available. </span></blockquote></div>
