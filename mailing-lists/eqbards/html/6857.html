<div id="ygrps-yiv-830756680">Myself and another bard on my server, seem to be doing well in South Karana<br/>
fighting Aviaks in and around the Aviak City... We can solo Darters and<br/>
Rooks, and in groups we can take harriers and Avocets, these things are rich<br/>
also.  I went from just hitting 21 to well into 23 so far in a couple of<br/>
days.<br/>
