<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893007956">Yes!  And Mr. Beeba, have you but been in the cave between North Ro and the<br/>
Commons?  O my, that Well Balanced Rapier is nice, &#39;bout same as my spear<br/>
she is, but small and elegant.  Beautiful in fact, but I don&#39;t have 260 pp.<br/>

&gt;&gt; not underestimate a fast weapon.... There&#39;s formulas about this people<br/>
&gt;have posted here, I honestly think your problem is that damn axe...<br/>
&gt; I use my spear, which has a fine damage/speed advantage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I totally agree with this.  I have been using a rapier/spear switch off<br/>
&gt;since lvl one...I too tried the mino axe but found that I was getting more<br/>
&gt;hits in with the rapier as opposed to the axe and I&#39;m using bronze still at<br/>
&gt;lvl 12...its a personal choice I know but I like the speed of the rapier<br/>
&gt;better...oh yeah, and it looks cool.<br/>
