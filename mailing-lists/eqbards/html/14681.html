&gt; I have seen him at the undead area in SK twice this past week.  Both times<br/>
&gt; it was daylight.  So he is still around.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s altogether possible that is he in the game.  I&#39;ve been in SK<br/>
  looking for rares quite a bit during the weekdays and not seen him.<br/>
  It&#39;s also possible that he&#39;s !Lord Grimrot on our server or he has <br/>
  been perma killed.  I have to agree with Sylly, I&#39;ve never seen him<br/>
  in the last 4 months easily.<br/>
