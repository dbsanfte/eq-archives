<div id="ygrps-yiv-470228580">I know others who were having similar problems, but it has been amazingly<br/>
NON-<br/>
crashy for me. (Usually I crash at least once a night.Nada since the pack)<br/>
<br/>
I think the RNG finally found your number, that&#39;s all.<br/>

&gt;    Has anyone else noticed anything screwy since the last patch?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not talking songs being out of whack or anything to that<br/>
&gt;effect.  I had only had one crash to the desktop in the whole time<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been playing.  Since the last patch, I&#39;ve locked up on the<br/>
&gt;login screen 5 times and crashed completely twice -- each one<br/>
&gt;requiring a reboot.  I haven&#39;t installed anything since then or<br/>
&gt;even prior to the patch so I was just seeing if anyone else was<br/>
&gt;experiencing the same sort of thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    On the other hand though, the random number generator seems to<br/>
&gt;have taken a liking to me last night.  I was camping the goblin<br/>
&gt;foreman in SolA for some quick cash.  We were there 2 hours and<br/>
&gt;the foreman (20 min spawn) spawned 4 out of the six times we were<br/>
&gt;there.  Every time he had an obsidian scimitar!   6 spawns, 4<br/>
&gt;foremen, 4 OS&#39;s -- too bad we had a druid with us that was in dire<br/>
&gt;need of a tunic.....but I&#39;m not complaining =)<br/>
