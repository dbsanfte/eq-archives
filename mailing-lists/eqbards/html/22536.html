<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940394920">The truth is that Bards aren&#39;t weak, they&#39;re pretty powerful, but...<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the tradeoff when using a Bard:<br/>
<br/>
1.  The Bard&#39;s offense sucks.  He adds less offense than anything other than, perhaps, a Cleric.  This<br/>
makes fights last longer, sucks up more healing mana, and increases the risk level of the encounter (e.g.,<br/>
it increases the risks of adds).<br/>
<br/>
2.  During combat, the Bard can sing offensively oriented songs which add to the capabilities of the melee<br/>
members of his party, or counter the abilities of the MOB, which dereases mana and decreases risk.<br/>
<br/>
3.  During downtime, the Bard can sing downtime-reducing songs.  This decreases downtime risk and<br/>
decreases downtime itself.  This allows the party to pull stuff faster.<br/>
<br/>
The value of  #2 or #3 is dependent on the party makeup, and the value of #3 is dependent on the<br/>
availability of MOBs to fight.  (Reduced downtime is not an advantage if you don&#39;t have enough stuff<br/>
around to take advantage of it.)<br/>
<br/>
I would argue that adding a Bard is equivalent to adding from 1/2 to 3 other players depending on the<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is &quot;the situation&quot;.  There are 7 things that high-level Kunark parties need:  1) crowd<br/>
control, 2) primary healer, 3) a tank, 4) a puller, 5) a group gater (sometimes), 6) a lockpicker<br/>
(sometimes), 7) secondary healer (sometimes).  The bard can&#39;t do any of these things other than limited<br/>
crowd control, or pulling (which doesn&#39;t allow him to play the downtime reducing role), which means that<br/>
he doesn&#39;t satisfy any of the core requirements.<br/>
<br/>
This means that any party which is going to attempt anything interesting or challenging has (depending on<br/>
characters available), already filled from 4 to 6 slots before they can consider the luxury of taking a<br/>
Bard.<br/>
<br/>
And, sadly, the standard group of:  Enchanter, Cleric, secondary healer, gater/nuker, tank/puller is one<br/>
group that, I would argue, least benefits from having a Bard added to it.  So we&#39;re often relegated to<br/>
doing the boring, peripheral stuff.<br/>
<br/>
This happens in my guild a lot:<br/>
Four players log on:<br/>
Enchanter LFG, he gets six /gu messages and gets a group immediately.<br/>
Cleric LFG, he gets a few /gu messages and gets a group pretty quickly.<br/>
Bard LFG, he gets a message if something opens up and nobody else is available.<br/>
Paladin LFG, he sits for 6 hours and gives up.<br/>
<br/>
Has nothing to do with the ability of people to play their character, it has to do with character balance.<br/>

&gt; 1) Worried that bards will be LFG because of being &quot;weak&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * This I think happened and was just recently addressed in ways to help<br/>
&gt; bards solo and get groups assuming they can realistically mez 2 or 3 mobs<br/>
&gt; long enough for their group to kill the mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) VI seems to have the right intentions (ie wants bards to be wanted in<br/>
&gt; groups) but does not have the practical experience on how to make this<br/>
&gt; happen in the game - at least not until players spend a lot of time telling<br/>
&gt; them that stuff is wrong.<br/>
