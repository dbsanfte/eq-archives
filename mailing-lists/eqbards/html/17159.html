<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018181800">I&#39;m with you Rokenn, I don&#39;t buy into this current negativety about Bards<br/>
being underpowered.<br/>
<br/>
I did feel somewhat useless in a group last night with an enchanter and a<br/>
shaman, but that&#39;s rare and I KNOW I did contribute immensly with mana song<br/>
and 2 Yaks. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; No one, and I mean no one, is better at down time reduction<br/>
&gt; &gt; then we are. Ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; any player in, on any server, what they hate the most about<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would bet a FBSS and a pair of yaks that downtime would be at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the top of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll see your FBSS and yaks and raise you a HQ Bear Skin that overcrowding<br/>
&gt; would beat downtime.  And less people per server would help all classes.<br/>
&gt; Just about anyone would be welcome in a group were the ratio of<br/>
