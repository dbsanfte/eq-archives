&gt; I&#39;ll do the math.  I buy muffins and milk for 6cp each, usually 2 stacks of<br/>
&gt; 20 each.  That&#39;s less than 5gp, enough to last me many days.<br/>

&gt; If you fish to roleplay or to relax, or just for fun, that&#39;s fine.  But<br/>
&gt; there is no economic advantage to fishing.  You could buy more food from 5<br/>
&gt; minutes of killing lvl-1 monsters than you would get from fishing for 30<br/>
&gt; minutes.<br/>

(and perhaps a sandal or dagger thrown in) - sell the fish and then buy<br/>
the muffins and milk.  Fishing adds variety to the game.  I&#39;ve also done<br/>
fishing when I really need to read a textbook (for work), but I really<br/>
want to paly EQ.  I compromise by fishing.  Read a paragraph, press the<br/>
fishing hot key, read a paragraph, press the fishing hot key....<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I use fishing to pass the time waiting for a boat, and of course<br/>
I work on sense heading at the same time.  <br/>
