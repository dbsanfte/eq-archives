&gt;   Those guilds didn&#39;t know what they were doing, you all will find<br/>
&gt;   that it is the same PoH that it always has been.  Modify your <br/>

golems being agro at the zone in point before everyone has even fully<br/>
zoned in? That&#39;s the way it&#39;s been on my server since the patch. Maybe<br/>
it&#39;s just lousy random spawn generation but having 4 highly magic<br/>
resistant mobs beating on you while you&#39;re still watching Loading Please<br/>
wait  doesnt seem to be a skill issue to me.<br/>
