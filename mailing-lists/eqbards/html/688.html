<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008768603">The juggling is EXACTLY what I do as a RL solo club musician.  It isn&#39;t the song that continues when you stop singing.  It&#39;s the EFFECT that the song has on you.  When I sing a sad song, the listener doesn&#39;t stop feeling sad immediately after I stop singing.  It&#39;s this *effect* that carries over into the next song.  If the next song is a toe-tapper, the audience may still feel a little sad for a while even as they start tapping.<br/>

what is the roleplaying<br/>
aspect of it.  personally i sing one song, because in reality i can<br/>
only sing one song.  if roleplaying doesn&#39;t matter to you fine, but<br/>
this is just an observation for all you rpers like me.</div>
