<div id="ygrps-yiv-64238797"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Its a whole other issue as to whether the sale of Norrathian items on E-bay<br/>
&gt;is allowed.  It certainly is not illegal in any way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is something for you to think about.  Assuming that the money we pay to <br/>
Verant/Sony every month is for a service (which it is), and assuming that <br/>
Verant has a clause stating that service = access to the servers and no <br/>
ownership of equipment (which I believe they do), this could be incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Sony/Verant owns the virtual equipment of Everquest just as much as they own <br/>
the real equipment that runs it. If I were to go into Verant offices and <br/>
take a computer and sell it on Ebay, I would be arrested for theft at least. <br/>
  Since Verant has never said I&#39;m allowed to keep the equipment I earned in <br/>
EQ, only that I&#39;m allowed to use it, selling a Lambent Breastplate on Ebay <br/>
could be considered theft as well, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure what I think on this issue yet, so I decided to throw <br/>
out one of the thoughts I had to see if/where my logic is flawed.<br/>
