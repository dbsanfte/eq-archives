<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072432005">That would be me.  I can personally attest that it is often very difficult<br/>
for me to get a bind because of the time zone I live in.  When I do get to<br/>
play, its usually after 9PM Hawaii time.  Thats midnight on the west coast<br/>
and 3AM on the east coast.  What I usually end up doing is picking a zone I<br/>
want to adventure in and staying there for a couple of weeks.  I don&#39;t go to<br/>
a new zone unless its a weekend and I can spend more hours playing.<br/>

&gt; I would despair of ever getting bound in my what would be my prime playing<br/>
&gt; hours.  You better know someone real well who can bind and you would<br/>
&gt; probably be restricted to playing with those people where those people<br/>
&gt; wanted to play.<br/>
