<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317954361">i got my paladin there at level 5 to loot some =)  if you zone in from<br/>
lavastorm, all you do is hug left, then up the ramp and first right and you<br/>
are in the king hall.  very easy run, and on a weekend or any other night<br/>
probably risk-free.<br/>

&gt; know SolB well<br/>
&gt; enough to say whether a low level could make the dash to loot <br/>
&gt; them (and<br/>
&gt; survive waiting for them to drop)? Would I need inviso, or <br/>
&gt; are there things<br/>
&gt; that see through it along the way (on, say a busy weekend night)? </span></blockquote></div>
