	Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody<br/>
		Causes all other players (non- group) in the area to become<br/>
disenchanted 	with the current hunting location and be gated to their bind<br/>
points.  Causes all 	other MOB&#39;s in the area to become disenchanted with<br/>
their fellow MOB&#39;s and begin 	to attack the closest target.<br/>

Here are a few ideas for some new songs.  Some of these I&#39;ve blatantly<br/>
ripped off from others (wish I could give credit, but I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
names.  You know who you are).<br/>
<br/>
* A song that drains all the bards mana (requires full mana?) and teleports<br/>
the entire group to a random bard guild.  Basically a bard &quot;evac&quot;<br/>
<br/>
* A party CHA increasing song.  This would have some interesting uses.<br/>
<br/>
* Chords of Chaos : Radius effect that would randomly alter non-party<br/>
&quot;hate-lists&quot; and targets.  Some MOBs might frenzy on the bard (or any other<br/>
random party member), some MOBs might attack other MOBs, some MOBs might<br/>
flee, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas... anyone else?<br/>
