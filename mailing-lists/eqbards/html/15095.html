<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074011565">I will be able to powerlevel your druid easily too. All I have to do is<br/>
beat a monster up so it has a slither of health left and then charm it.<br/>
When charm wears off you can then finish it off and you get the exp too (I<br/>
have been told this does work).<br/>
<br/>
I got to level 11 at lunch with my cleric. fighting at derv camps is great<br/>
fun. I forgot what it was like from when we was newbies, hehe.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now that they fixed the clouding song...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wat was the plan for the lvl 24 see invis song?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anybody remember the discussion?  Is this just another useless song<br/>
&gt;that they are going to expect us to deal with...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I swear, when does NWN come out?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you think the 24th lvl song is useless then you need to rethink your<br/>
position.  Otherwise you will find the pet users in your group will be<br/>
mightly PO&#39;d with you when you try to give them see invis.  Also the 24th<br/>
lvl song grants Ultravision, which is a big help to our night-blind human<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
FYI Very few, if ANY of our songs are useless.  Some are just more<br/>
specialized then others.<br/>
