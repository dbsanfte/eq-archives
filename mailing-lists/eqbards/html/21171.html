<div id="ygrps-yiv-681977646">Apology more than accepted..  It&#39;s pretty clear now, at worst, you made some<br/>
assumptions on my post as to where I was coming from - probably as much from<br/>
ignorance as to the state of Xegony server as well as ignorance of my own<br/>
situation.  Perhaps you intended on speaking in general and not to me in<br/>
particular.<br/>

I&#39;ll put my replies to the various responses to my message in this one post:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slyde:<br/>
I read back over my post and I agree it sounds patronizing, and I apologize<br/>
(bet you didn&#39;t see that coming). I have a problem with people farming Fear<br/>
for several reasons going even beyond pride (or ego thing, whatever Lyrnia),<br/>
and that&#39;s the chord your post struck with me, and I went overboard in my<br/>
response.<br/>
If you get the chance to break Fear on a full pop, I would highly suggest<br/>
going that route. As a bard you probably won&#39;t get much in the way of loot,<br/>
but it can be the most rewarding experience as far as fun, and sense of<br/>
accomplishment from teamwork.<br/>

&quot;It neither offends me nor even comes close to making me laugh.  It&#39;s<br/>
just not funny.&quot;<br/>

You&#39;re entitles to your opinion(s) and particular sense of humor, wherever<br/>
it may be.<br/>

&quot;Why does it matter if people come in after your guild clears out fear? Are<br/>
they hurting you in any way? To be honest, you say how much it stinks to<br/>
break the plane (deaths and time) but then criticze others for not wanting<br/>
to do it themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And rightfully so. What I started with this is way off topic for this list<br/>
and is already likely to be kabonged. I&#39;ll just say this - it&#39;s a free ride<br/>
to nice gear. Plain and simple.<br/>
<br/>

Lyrnia:<br/>
&quot;Generally speaking I just ignore folks who post anything about &#39;breaking&#39;<br/>
fear being the &#39;proper&#39; way to do things.  It&#39;s a zone, like any other.&quot;<br/>
Break or not break doesn&#39;t matter.  Folks like Sartori just like to pretend<br/>
that you didn&#39;t &quot;earn&quot; your time in fear unless you broke it.  It&#39;s an ego<br/>
thing nothing more nothing less.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking I just ignore folks who post anything about there being<br/>
&#39;nothing wrong with farming&#39;. But hey, I&#39;ll go ahead and finish this and<br/>
then read the other 3 posts you made on the subject. Nothing wrong with<br/>
taking pride in your accomplishments, but like I said above I have more<br/>
reasons than that (maybe they&#39;re unique to me and my guild, hell if I know).<br/>
There have been several instances during fear raids where my crew has been<br/>
fucked over by would-be farmers hoping the way was clear when it wasn&#39;t. But<br/>
hey trains can happen like any other zone, I suppose...It&#39;s a &#39;zone like any<br/>
other&#39; right? Hrmm why can&#39;t I zone my lvl 2 SK in and get some Umbral? It&#39;s<br/>
&#39;just armor&#39; right?<br/>
