&gt; Hmm, interesting. As a human with a charisma of 90 I can buy a steel<br/>
&gt; breastplate in freeport for 700-something plat. I havent checked the prices<br/>
&gt; recently though, they may have changed it since for some reason. I&#39;ll check up<br/>
&gt; on this and see.<br/>
&gt; May I ask where you purchased it and what race you are?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I recently purchased a steel breastplate.  It was 980 or so platinum at 90<br/>
&gt; &gt; charisma.  Putting on my two +5 charisma items reduced the price by around<br/>
&gt; &gt; 40 plat.  I then got a friendly shaman to cast a charisma buff on me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; bringing my total up to 115; this brought the price down to less than 900<br/>
&gt; &gt; platinum.  Sorry, I don&#39;t remember the exact figures.<br/>
