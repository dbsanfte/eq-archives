<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-543382969">Pardon for this being non-Bard oriented question (I forget the terminology between META and OT - so forgive this as well) but given the level of knowledge on this board - I wanted to ask it here..<br/>
<br/>
I just signed up for DSL Access and hopefully will have 1.024 MBs access in about five weeks.  Two questions<br/>
<br/>
1) Will I see any advantages in EQ?  I would assume lag should be less of an issue and zoning a bit faster...<br/>
<br/>
2) The service I&#39;ve signed up for eventually will charge $20/GB upstream after the first GB (i.e. the first Gigabyte is free) any idea how much data EQ is pumping upstream?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
