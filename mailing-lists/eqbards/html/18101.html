&gt; ***Press Release***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; LEAGUE OF ANTONICAN BARDS ANNOUNCE NEW MAIL ROUTE<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FIRIONA VIE, Kunark. February 1, 3178--<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Today, the League of Antonican Bards, responsible for maintaining<br/>
&gt; communication across Norrath announced that they have established a mail<br/>
&gt; route to the newly discovered continent of Kunark, located across the ocean,<br/>
&gt; south and east of Antonica. The new route will carry mail from Port Faydwer<br/>
&gt; to the Elven outpost of Firiona Vie, which will serve as main port-of-entry<br/>
&gt; and battle staging grounds for adventurers arriving in the new lands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The outpost of Firiona Vie was established soon after word reached King<br/>
&gt; Tearis Thex, King of Felwithe and leader of the Koada`Dal, that his daughter<br/>
&gt; of the same name had been kidnapped by lizard creatures now known to be<br/>
&gt; named the Iksar. The King commissioned Galeth Veredeth, once-Lord and High<br/>
&gt; Paladin of Tunare, to establish the outpost on Kunark and return his<br/>
&gt; daughter to him, lest Veredeth&#39;s life be forfeited for failure. &quot;I cannot<br/>
&gt; allow those vile creatures to keep my daughter and only heir to the<br/>
&gt; Koada`Dal throne from fulfilling her destiny,&quot; says King Tearis Thex.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Galeth Veredeth had best not fail me.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A high level source in Neriak confirmed today that the Dark races will not<br/>
&gt; be outdone in the endeavor to acquire new territory and power. The source<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;We believe that this nonsense about a kidnapped princess is just<br/>
&gt; that. If the lesser `Dals and their human and stunted playthings think that<br/>
&gt; they can wander the new lands unchecked, they are quite mistaken.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many adventures are already beginning the trip to Kunark, a journey that is<br/>
&gt; not without its perils. A human and halfling party was apparently<br/>
&gt; slaughtered upon their arrival after mistakenly boarding a Kunark-destined<br/>
&gt; ship in the Oasis of Marr. They evidently were not aware that the ship would<br/>
&gt; arrive at a new port, firmly controlled by Neriak and their brutish muscle<br/>
&gt; from Oggok and Grobb.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Druidic scouts have reported that there are some strange phenomena present<br/>
&gt; throughout the new lands. &quot;The land appears to have been ravaged by some<br/>
&gt; viscous magical storms at one time,&quot; said one follower of Karana. &quot;Some<br/>
&gt; magics that we have come to count on just do not work.&quot; This phenomenon was<br/>
&gt; apparently noticed to an extreme in the vicinity of a mountain peak rumored<br/>
&gt; to be inhabited by followers of Veeshan. &quot;Only through divine intervention<br/>
&gt; did I escape that place with my life.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The League of Antonican Bards&#39; representative in Kunark met with Galeth<br/>
&gt; Veredeth, Governor of the Outpost Firiona Via. &quot;It is my sincerest hope that<br/>
&gt; many adventures loyal to the King will assist us on our Quest to return the<br/>
&gt; Princess to her home,&quot; says Veredeth. &quot;Though the dangers in these new lands<br/>
&gt; are formidable, I have no doubt that many will come, if for nothing else<br/>
&gt; than to reap the spoils.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ###<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Kunark Goes Live*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In case the announcement from the League of Antonican Bards wasn&#39;t to your<br/>
&gt; liking, we are very pleased to announce that the EverQuest: The Ruins of<br/>
&gt; Kunark expansion has been implemented on the live servers. Adventurers who<br/>
&gt; have installed the expansion and registered their account key may now visit<br/>
&gt; the new lands, exceed level 50, create Iksar characters, and access<br/>
&gt; Kunark-related content in general.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is a short list of some of the new features available to those who have<br/>
&gt; upgraded:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Players may now reach level 60!<br/>
&gt; - Over two dozen new zones to explore!<br/>
&gt; - Tons of new quests, items, and spells to complete, acquire, and learn!<br/>
&gt; - All-new creatures and weapons, with new art too!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are two minor issue that is known and that we are still in the process<br/>
&gt; of rectifying: Action-based sounds for the Iksar and some other Kunark<br/>
&gt; creatures are still being worked on. In other words, you might hear a giant<br/>
&gt; mosquito &quot;walk&quot; by you, and your Iksar might sound curiously like a human<br/>
&gt; when he is hit with a sword. In addition, there is some additional work<br/>
&gt; required with a couple of the starting Iksar quests. This may cause you to<br/>
&gt; reach a point where you cannot proceed further in a quest. This will not<br/>
&gt; however cause you to turn in items and be denied your reward, so feel free<br/>
&gt; to explore these new quests. We will be finishing them over the next week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We would like to offer special thanks everyone who has been patient over the<br/>
&gt; past couple of weeks while we&#39;ve readied EverQuest for this awesome event.<br/>
&gt; It has been quite a challenge for our team to get everything ready for<br/>
&gt; launch, and your support has been instrumental in this process. We&#39;d also<br/>
&gt; like to thank the beta test team, who in the face of all of the new content<br/>
&gt; managed to keep their thoughts between themselves and the Dev Team, while<br/>
&gt; working to make the game better for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you ordered Kunark on or before 4/19/2000 and do not receive your Kunark<br/>
&gt; CD by today, we will be posting instructions later today on how to claim the<br/>
&gt; shipping refund as well as the free month of EverQuest promised last week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The EverQuest Team<br/>

&gt; *K-Patch Required*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All Kunark-enabled players should run the Kunark Patch on the Patch Program<br/>
&gt; control panel prior to attempting to enter Kunark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Manual Supplement*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The files named everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt in your<br/>
&gt; EverQuest directory are now obsolete. Downloaded to you today are two new<br/>
&gt; files, labeled EQROKSupplement.doc (MS-Word &#39;97 Format) and<br/>
&gt; EQROKSupplement.txt (Text Only). These files are supplements to the manual<br/>
&gt; distributed with the retail version of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark. For<br/>
&gt; those who upgraded, PDF files of the manual will be placed on the official<br/>
&gt; EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com. A new patch message will announce<br/>
&gt; their availability.<br/>
