<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485551686">Uhm - the point of the thread was &quot;how to spread damage more equally among<br/>
the group&quot; -- so instead of &quot;telling&quot; the war/ranger/wiz &quot;how to play his<br/>
class&quot; (even the most tactful suggestions may not be well received) why not<br/>
try asking him to think up a solution to the group&#39;s problem?  Ie: if he&#39;s<br/>
such a good ranger/war/wiz, let him think up the way to spread the damage<br/>
around.<br/>

p.s. &quot;Stop chaining damn it! I am darknessing!&quot;  &quot;Duh, forgot, sorry&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ...  Would anyone seriously ever suggest a<br/>
&gt; &gt; ranger only dual-wield for part of a fight?  Or that a warrior not use<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; &gt; extra attacks for part of a fight? ...<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Kitasi<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t suggest those two things, no, but that misses the point a bit.<br/>
When<br/>
&gt; I play my warrior, I will often stop taunting and will sometimes stop<br/>
swinging<br/>
&gt; altogether in order to balance out the damage, and to keep the MOBs<br/>
spinning.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s much easier for a party to copy with balanced damage, and a spinning<br/>
MOB<br/>
&gt; attacks less, so both are useful.<br/>
