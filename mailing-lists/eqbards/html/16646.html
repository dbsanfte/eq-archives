I was thinking the same thing last nite!  Of course I was one of the few<br/>
deaths anyhow.  To think I might actually gain a level in one week is mind<br/>
boggling to me.  Of course, having 3 bards to spread that gobbie luv around<br/>
so to speak certainly helped.  Two nights before I was the sole bard and<br/>
died three times because no one could get the mobs off me.  If not for the<br/>
bizarre chain-trolling as we called it where I was the bait while the other<br/>
bard chained/whacked I would have died again.<br/>
