<div id="ygrps-yiv-336144642">Nice theory, but not true.  The guards really are indifferent and if Goonda<br/>
has been killed or pulled away you can saunter on thru their camp just fine.<br/>
Problem normally is that Goonda is Scowls and all the ogres will help him as<br/>
soon as he aggros on you.<br/>
<br/>
I found out the hard way.  I was walking amongst the guards hailing them<br/>
when Goonda returned from chasing someone and promptly the previously<br/>
indifferent ogres slaughtered me.<br/>

I think they cast some type of faction spell on each other that makes them<br/>
con differently than they really con.  Sounds funny but I seriously heard<br/>
that a long long time ago, dunno if it is true.<br/>

&gt; amiable to indifferent, so I cruise up there and WHAMMO.  Dead as a<br/>
&gt; doornail.  I was 16th level, and I was dead in less than 2 <br/>
&gt; seconds.  Not to<br/>
&gt; mention I lost my level retrieving my corpse. *sigh*.  Now...last I<br/>
&gt; checked, amiable and indifferent didn&#39;t make them want to <br/>
&gt; kill you..or I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; REALLY be dead in most cities.  What&#39;s going on w/ that?<br/>
