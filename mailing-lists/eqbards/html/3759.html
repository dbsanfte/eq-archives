&gt;It made the game really boring - the item drops didn&#39;t matter<br/>

&gt;endlessly killing monsters for experience.<br/>

accumulating wealth in EQ, more emphasis would be put on the social aspect<br/>
of it.  I hate to use UO as an example but in this case it serves as a<br/>
beautiful example.  It just had something EQ missed.  When you died you<br/>
could count on losing every item you had been carrying on you, and no<br/>
particular item was THE item that you HAD to have to stay competitive, they<br/>
were all relatively easy to get.  So instead of being obligated to sit<br/>
someplace for hours and hours on end, you might be able to entertain<br/>
yourself or others in the local tavern, or magic shop.  This was SO off the<br/>
subject, just gave me something to type about  -=)   Thanks</div>
