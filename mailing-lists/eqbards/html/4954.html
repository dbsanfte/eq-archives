&gt;      One question...can druids, clerics, etc., or those<br/>
&gt; that heal, heal monsters that they are fighting if they<br/>
&gt; have the monster targeted?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  Not unless it&#39;s charmed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have never played a healer<br/>
&gt; type and was wondering if this was the case.  Yesterday in<br/>
&gt; Permafrost I was grouped with a druid that was supposed to<br/>
&gt; be healing me when I was getting hurt, but for some reason<br/>
&gt; every time I asked for a heal, the monster would get more<br/>
&gt; health and mine would still go down.  The druids<br/>
&gt; explanation was that there were other monsters of its race<br/>
&gt; healing it<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  Not only can monsters cast spells at you through walls,<br/>
they can heal each other through walls.  Lots of stuff in<br/>
Permafrost heals each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and the reason mine was not healing fast is<br/>
&gt; because his heal did not work very well.  Needless to say<br/>
&gt; I died and quickly ungrouped from this person.  So is what<br/>
&gt; the druid said true?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it&#39;s true.  Druids get a lot of flak for being<br/>
&quot;overpowered&quot; but that&#39;s mostly from people who haven&#39;t played<br/>
the class.  They get one heal spell every 10 levels.  When<br/>
they first get the spell, it can heal about one bubble.<br/>
Within a few levels, it&#39;s a half bubble.  The last 3-4 levels<br/>
before they get their next heal spell, by the time the druid<br/>
gets the heal spell off the monster has done more damage than<br/>
the spell healed.  They are basically useless as healers half<br/>
their lower levels, and all of their higher levels (they get<br/>
their last heal spell at 34ish I think).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Or am I correct in my assumption<br/>
&gt; that the druid was healing the monsters?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No way to do that.<br/>
