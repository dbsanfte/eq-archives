&gt; Yikes!  I tried Unrest at 18 and 19 and got into some of the worst groups I<br/>
&gt; have ever seen.  The groups were far more horrifying than the mobs.  Get<br/>
&gt; this, one group I was in, the cleric had the following spells memm&#39;d at<br/>
&gt; level 17.  Summon food, Summon drink, Hammer of Wrath, Smite, Furor, Light<br/>
&gt; Heal! and that&#39;s it!  I know from the screenshot he emailed me of his<br/>
&gt; &quot;awesome kill of a horrid undead via his amazing Smite spell&quot;  <br/>

mind. Surely after a few groups like this you might remember the few<br/>
players who were ok? Next time you go, look for them and group with<br/>
them. At least that&#39;s how I did it. I ended up with my current group of<br/>
players from talking to someone in a group I was in in Cazic who was the<br/>
only person in the group I found fun to play with. The rest were either<br/>
hard core leveling freaks or greedy power looters.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in bad groups, get out as fast as possible. Try to take the ones<br/>
with a clue with you. It takes time to weed through all the bad players<br/>
you meet until you find a bunch worth playing with but it&#39;s worth it<br/>
later. In fact I&#39;d go so far as to say if you don&#39;t do this it&#39;s a waste<br/>
of time playing the game. The further you go in the game, the worse<br/>
depending on pickup groups becomes.<br/>
