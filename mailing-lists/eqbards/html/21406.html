<div id="ygrps-yiv-378259671">My group has started hunting in CoM recently (got bored of Skyfire), and I was wondering if you all could answer a few questions for me.<br/>
<br/>
First, a little bit of info on my group, I&#39;m the low man (at 35th), we have a 45th chanter, a 51 Cleric, 52 Mage and Shaman.  Normally I don&#39;t tank unless it&#39;s a bad pull (and the Chanter&#39;s not there :), mainly because we&#39;re fighting stuff that&#39;s all red to me and I die a bit too fast.<br/>
<br/>
My job in the group is mana song, charming for CC when I can (dang 37th charm cap!), pulling and scouting (I&#39;m the only one who&#39;ll pull in that zone, the others are too scared *shrug*), and generally entertaining the group.<br/>
<br/>
What I need to know...I&#39;ve been keeping the 12+ spawns on the ground in the middle of the zone clear, so we&#39;ve started to explore towards the castle.  Is there anything I need to be aware of near there?  Also, what&#39;s in the house flying in the sky?  And why do all those groups camp near the double staircase (we can&#39;t fight there, lags me and the cleric out).<br/>
<br/>
TIA!<br/>
<br/>
P.S., went on my first Vox run a couple nights ago.  We got slaughtered, but it was still fun :)<br/>
