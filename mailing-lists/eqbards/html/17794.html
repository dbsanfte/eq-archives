<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150136332">Still I think the way they were treated was insulting, and losing their<br/>
guide status for one very minor infraction was overkill.  <br/>
<br/>
All in all I&#39;d say the good Gm/Guide encounters I&#39;ve had outweigh the bad<br/>
ones about 3 to 1, but its the bad ones you really remember.  I&#39;ll never<br/>
forget having a guide insult me, and not receiving an apology, or even<br/>
acknowledgement of the issue just rubbed salt into the wounds.  They can&#39;t<br/>
even claim I faked logfiles or something, since I /reported him.  Of course<br/>
I&#39;m sure they can erase those.<br/>

Actually only one of the guides was perm-banned, the others were only<br/>
temporary till their Guide accounts were purged.  Gordon cleared that up in<br/>
a follow up post.  Apparently the one that was perm-banned had several<br/>
warnings for past problems.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I have had great relations with GMs/Guides.  The only one I ever<br/>
had trouble with was GM-Jagar.  I sure wish GM-Mennix would come back to<br/>
Karana though :(  Our current GM (DeSani) is kind of a nut though.  He keeps<br/>
showing at after we kill big targets.  On out last Inny kill he paid us a<br/>
visit as first Inny, then Draco, then we turned into a 6 inch tall human<br/>
lol.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve had both sides of the coin.  Gm&#39;s who were helpful and quick, and<br/>
&gt; others who never answered (after 3 hrs I was forced to give <br/>
&gt; up) and even<br/>
&gt; insulting ones.  There&#39;s an interesting thread on this on <br/>
&gt; EQVault right now<br/>
&gt; concerning the guides who were banned.  Basically I&#39;d say <br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;s reaction<br/>
&gt; was idiotic, childish, and insulting.  The guides should have gotten a<br/>
&gt; warning, not banned for a one liner in a 20 page document <br/>
&gt; that none of them<br/>
&gt; ever really noticed.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been quite lucky. I&#39;ve never had problems getting GMs to answer<br/>
&gt; my petition/satisfy my problems.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I have an honest face?<br/>

&gt; &gt;That&#39;s what I thought too, but apparently the teleport spot for <br/>
&gt; &gt;Butcherblock<br/>
&gt; &gt;is at about 10,000 ft.  You immediately fall and take 10,000 <br/>
&gt; points anyhow<br/>
&gt; &gt;which is as you can guess instantly fatal.  Not good when <br/>
&gt; you are bound in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Halas at the time as I was.  The GM&#39;s never responded to my <br/>
&gt; petition even<br/>
&gt; &gt;though I was beneath the world and was supposedly teleported <br/>
&gt; to a &quot;safe<br/>
&gt; &gt;spot&quot;<br/>
