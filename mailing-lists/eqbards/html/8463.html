<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Harmonic, when I told my warrior friend last night that <br/>
&gt;I knew you from this bard list he was very jealous. To <br/>
&gt;quote him, &quot;There&#39;s nothing like that for warriors.&quot; Based <br/>
&gt;on my experience, I have to agree with him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> It&#39;s true.  The Bard community as a whole is very, very solid.<br/>
 We are like a tightly woven fabric of the entire class structure.<br/>
 I think it&#39;s due to the fact we are geared for partys, thus group<br/>
 with a lot of people and have to in order to survive.  This <br/>
 builds a usually friendly persona, it builds leadership, and it<br/>
 gives you a much better understanding of how this game&#39;s social<br/>
 ties truly work.  We are few, and far between.  But I would argue<br/>
 we are one of the strongest, if not the strongest, social class<br/>
 in the game as it stands.<br/>

 It was a pleasure seeing you working on your skills, Operaman &lt;g&gt;<br/>
