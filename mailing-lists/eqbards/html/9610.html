<div id="ygrps-yiv-231940728">if it makes you feel better my buddy camped that room for about 14 hours<br/>
straight (what a goof!) i went in there for about 2 hours the other night<br/>
with some buddies, we needed the ring from the king and i needed the<br/>
boots....   Well to make a long story short, a dozen champs, half a dozen<br/>
mages, a few shaman and not a damn king later, we got absolutely nothing,<br/>
though i did get a heart for the ranger sleeves.<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone.  Last night I had a disappointing fiasco in Solusek.  I<br/>
&gt; got together a good group and went in to get my two bard quest items.<br/>
&gt; We headed for the king room, and managed to break the spawn (thank you<br/>
&gt; Lament).  We camped the room for about 4 hours.  Almost everyone in the<br/>
&gt; group had some quest item they wanted, and I was the only bard.  Well,<br/>
&gt; to make a long story short, after killing at least 25 solusek champions,<br/>
&gt; 5 sol mages, 6 sol shamans, 25ish inferno goblins.  Not a single one of<br/>
&gt; us got a quest item.  Are these supposed to be that rare?  Are we just<br/>
&gt; in the wrong place to find these items or what?  We got a couple<br/>
&gt; mediocre items off the king, but I didn&#39;t get any of them (lost the<br/>
&gt; roll).  To add insult to injury, just as I was saying I needed to go (I<br/>
&gt; had already stayed up 2 hours late), we had a bad pull, and half of us<br/>
&gt; died.  And I awoke to......Greater Feydark.  Heh... Oops.  Thank god for<br/>
&gt; revive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any insight?  Did they nerf it with the latest patch or something?  Or<br/>
&gt; has it always been this rare for them to drop the quest items?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Frustrated,<br/>
