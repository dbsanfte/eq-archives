<div id="ygrps-yiv-729876268">Hmmm, I&#39;d don&#39;t think I would rate skills that cap at &#39;Bad&#39; as passable<br/>
under any circumstances.  Especially when Master level is really 200 and not<br/>
101.  If you doubt this just ask any bowyer who&#39;s tried to make a trueshot<br/>
when he became a Master.  Our guild ranger has a Fletching of 135 and is<br/>
currently 0 for 10 trying to make one.<br/>
<br/>
Also, even at 75 the skills are not high enough to be considered handy at<br/>
all.  That&#39;s why no one uses them.  Getting a pick locks at 40th level that<br/>
capped at 75 is a joke.  If they really do implement more locks in Kunark<br/>
you won&#39;t see many 40th level bards unlocking them or else they will be<br/>
totally meaningless to the rogues with their skill of 200.  <br/>
<br/>
Many of the skills bards get are not useful but are certainly thrown up as<br/>
being part of our play balance equation.  Offhand I&#39;d list Hide, Sneak, Pick<br/>
Locks, Disarm Traps, and for some people Forage as nearly useless.  Not sure<br/>
how well our Instill doubt works, or why we would use it since we cannot<br/>
backstab.  What other class (with the possible exception of Rogues who are<br/>
also pretty hosed) has even half this number of useless skills?  Certainly<br/>
not any of the other hybrids.<br/>

&gt; &gt; a few words here...<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard= jack of all trades, master of none<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dispite the fact that this tired old adage is dragged out every time<br/>
&gt; this debate comes up, did you ever stop to actually think what jack<br/>
&gt; means? Up until it&#39;s use on this list it used to mean relatively good at<br/>
&gt; something as compared to true master.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are wrong.  You have altered the definition to make it what you want.<br/>
Lets check the dictionary<br/>
