&gt; Unfortunatly, most newbies are scared that the rogue&#39;s are <br/>
&gt; stealing all thier copper that they cannot see<br/>
&gt; them for the tanks/damage dealers they are. The Pickpocket <br/>
&gt; skill is so misunderstood it is not even funny.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh.  I&#39;ve made the mistake of telling people when they refuse to use a<br/>
looting order that I&#39;m going to pick the pockets of every Xth mob (in a<br/>
party of X players) and that I&#39;ll leave the rest for them to loot.  Amazing<br/>
how quickly these groups disband.  It took me a while to figure out I was<br/>
better off saying nothing.  ;^)<br/>

&gt; (stealing all their copper that, in not very many levels, they&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; tossing in piles on the ground anyway??? And that if they are<br/>
&gt; true newbies worrying about that!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By &quot;true newbie&quot; I assume you mean non-twinks, since a non-twinked secondary<br/>
character will need to count their coppers as much as a primary character at<br/>
the lower levels.  <br/>
<br/>
Twinks, as a general rule, only group with other twinks.  I&#39;ve gotten a few<br/>
gifts (guard bracer, bracer of Erollisi, Dragoon Dirk, two earings of<br/>
desease reflection & a carnelian wedding band to be exact), but still don&#39;t<br/>
quite live up to the standards of twink groups.<br/>
