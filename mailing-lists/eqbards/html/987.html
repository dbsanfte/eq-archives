your stopwatch?  That should be punch 0, not 1.  I did the<br/>
same timings with my monk a couple weeks ago and got about 3.5<br/>
seconds per punch, and I have a hard time believing bards can<br/>
punch faster than monks.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
e.g.<br/>
<br/>
You punch [mob] and hit for xxx damage (this is punch zero)<br/>
  start stopwatch<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
You punch [mob] and hit for xxx damage (this is punch one)<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
You punch [mob] and hit for xxx damage (this is punch two)<br/>
.<br/>
......<br/>
.<br/>
You punch [mob] and hit for xxx damage (this is punch fifteen)<br/>
  stop stopwatch<br/>
<br/>
If I subtract one from your number of &quot;hits&quot; to correct for<br/>
this type of error, I get 3.6 and 3.5 seconds per punch, which<br/>
is consistent with my monk findings.  Btw, a dagger at 2pp is<br/>
about the fastest weapon you can get (20 delay).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the difference between your stacked times (2.6-2.75<br/>
sec/hit) and only Whistling times (2.73-2.78) over a duration<br/>
of 40-50 seconds is only about 1 second.  That would appear to<br/>
be within your margin for error since one of your stacked<br/>
samples was in the range of just Whistling.  I&#39;m not saying<br/>
you&#39;re wrong, just that this isn&#39;t the strongest evidence for<br/>
it. :-)<br/>

&gt; It is possible that these 2 songs get +5% to attack rate every 3 <br/>
&gt; levels up to a certain cap.<br/>
