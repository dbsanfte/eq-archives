<div id="ygrps-yiv-57307638">Shada, you may be right about Song of Dawn.  I made the arrogant mistake of never trying it, since for the<br/>
last five or so levels, I&#39;ve found it next to impossible to aggro the primary target, very easy to ditch<br/>
it if I do, and I assumed it would not be worth the bother for secondaries.  I suppose if it lowers you<br/>
far enough on the list, other factors (like proximity) take over, so maybe it works even if nobody else<br/>
has aggroed a MOB directly.  Even if true, I have other things I&#39;d rather twist, but I may try it if I do<br/>
bigger stuff.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other four, I&#39;ve actually memmed them.  I didn&#39;t say they were worth much, but I&#39;ve used all<br/>
four of them:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Level 14 - Lyssa&#39;s Cataloging Libretto, unless you are doing the lambent<br/>
&gt; quests and need a rune identified.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>... and the Nostrolo Tambourine and VP key quests.  There&#39;s a few other things that people like to<br/>
identify as well.  I&#39;m not sure that they NEED to, but I get asked occasionally.  In some ways, this is<br/>
really artificial.  They put the identical-appearing components in the game in order to make the song (and<br/>
the spell) have a purpose, which is kind of ass-backwards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 21 - Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion, unless you are PvP i guess.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has sometimes helped me get people unstuck from places.  It doesn&#39;t work great for that, but it<br/>
sometimes does the trick.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 57 - Cassindra&#39;s Insipid Ditty, same boat as Denon&#39;s Dissension<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this works this way, but my theory is that if you knock a MOBs WIS and INT down right off<br/>
the bat (before they cast) that shrinks their mana by a proportional amount.  If they work like PCs, they<br/>
don&#39;t regain the mana even when the WIS and INT is restored when the song wears off.  The mana drain<br/>
component is so small that I don&#39;t bother with it for that, but if I have an open song slot, I will fire<br/>
it as a first salvo against casting MOBs.  Of course, I have no way to test whether or not it does any<br/>
good...  :(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Level 59 - Solon&#39;s Charismatic Concord, this is what i am working for?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, now that&#39;s a stupid song.  Especially as a reward for level 59.  I didn&#39;t list it because I don&#39;t<br/>
have it to not mem yet.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 53 - Song of Dawn:  Reducing aggro on secondary MOBs doesn&#39;t help when<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;re the only one on the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, i am no expert on how aggro works, but when i have a secondary mob on<br/>
&gt; me that i believe no one else has aggro&#39;d, Song of Dawn has worked to get it<br/>
&gt; off me and on someone else.  maybe someone else did have aggro and i was not<br/>
&gt; aware, but not that i could tell.<br/>
