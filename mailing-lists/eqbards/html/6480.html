&gt; Here are some additional changes which occured in the patch that were not <br/>
&gt; announced. I know you all are probably getting<br/>
&gt; petitions on alot of these so hopefully this information will allow you to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; inform players that it was a change and not a bug.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If there are any others we may have missed please report them to your<br/>
&gt; server <br/>
&gt; GM so that we can verify that they were indeed<br/>
&gt; intentional changes and not bugs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; Normal arrows (item 8005)have had their range reduced from 50 to 25. This<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; because fletched arrows are range 50 and a<br/>
&gt; flectcher making his own arrows should have better arrows than generic <br/>
&gt; storebought ones. No other arrows were affected<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -The Box of Abu-Kar has had the it&#39;s weight reduction greatly reduced. <br/>
&gt; (don&#39;t have exact reduction specs)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -The item Glowing Stein has been changed to Stein of Moggok<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -The Lustrous Russet Armor is now warrior only, a previous error had<br/>
&gt; caused <br/>
&gt; it to be used by several other classes despite the<br/>
&gt; fact it was always intented to be warrior only<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -The Fletching kit now has 8 slots. This is to allow more items added into<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the process to make new bows.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -New tailoring items have been added. Tailors can now make the silk series<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of armor. The books on how to manufacture these<br/>
&gt; are also in the game, but are spawn drops and not vendor sales.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Vendors who previously sold just arrow nocks now sell all of the<br/>
&gt; fletching <br/>
&gt; materials.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reported by a Player (Remf the Troll)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -nobles crests from the npc paladins in swamp are nodrop now<br/>
&gt; -kolandi fish now nodrop<br/>
&gt; -erud tonic now nodrop<br/>
&gt; -honeyjum now require high faction to acquire<br/>
&gt; -egg shaped pumice now casts dispel magic instead of pillage enchantment<br/>
&gt; -monster frenzy AI tweaked<br/>
&gt; -crafted armor now sells to vendor for 10x lower prices<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;bugs&quot;<br/>
&gt; -fishies still swim in the air<br/>
&gt; -items dropped on ground become permanent fixtures, at least client side<br/>
&gt; -teleporting monsters play leapfrog when the appear, keep jumping on top<br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; -new arrow range overrides bow rating (25 arrow + 150 bow = 25 arrow range<br/>
