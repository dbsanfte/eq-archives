<br/>
	While pulling dervs from a full camp (long ago) i was able to lament 2<br/>
of the 3 dervs, pull the third, and have the party kill it. After we<br/>
killed one, we figured we could handle the other 2, so the SK in the<br/>
party hit one with a spell, the other derv ignored it and stayed put. I<br/>
repeated this test several times with different mobs.<br/>
<br/>
	This shows two things; one: when a creature is lamented, he is lamented<br/>
for all, not just the bard. two: Lament lasts longer than 10 seconds, at<br/>
least as long as the time it takes a party of level 10-12s to kill a<br/>
derv and heal/med up.<br/>
<br/>
	Overall, I have found Lament VERY usefull. It fails VERY rarely (one in<br/>
30 or so, maybe even less) and costs no mana :) leaving the casters who<br/>
CAN lull FOM.<br/>
<br/>
	I have used Lament recently, to solo a 2 aviak guard tower, great xp,<br/>
good loot, little downtime. Usually by the time i am ready to fight, the<br/>
avaik is waiting for me :)<br/>
<br/>
	AND, if lament fails, you can always selo away. Once while lamenting<br/>
the derv camp with 5 dervs in it, it failed on the first shot. I ran off<br/>
to the zone, and my party was able to pick off each derv as they walked<br/>
back. I got xp for 4 out of the 5, and to top it off, they thought i<br/>
MEANT to do it :)</div>
