<b>Subject:</b> RE: something i noticed w/Cha-Carillion <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-832771975">I never travel in a city without Carillion.  While its true that it<br/>
sometimes won&#39;t change my prices due to my already high charisma, it has<br/>
other benefits.  The greatest benefit of Carillion is in the area of quests.<br/>
I have found that not only am I able to get more quests because of<br/>
Carillion, but the rewards for doing the quests are better as well.  I have<br/>
found that I consistently get greatly increased rewards when I use Carillion<br/>
before I turn in items for quests.  While the chance still exists to get a<br/>
lesser reward due to the vagaries of the random number generator, over the<br/>
long haul it has proved invaluable.  <br/>
<br/>
When I completed the squad ring quest I noticed that Hendi Mrubble would not<br/>
recharge my ring, and the marshal would not give me a new one.  One blast of<br/>
Carillion and the Marshal obliged my request for a new ring, another blast<br/>
and Hendi was equally cooperative.  I have also consistently gotten a reward<br/>
for 2 jumjum stalks from Uner, while most folks have to turn in 4 to get a<br/>
reward.  So far I have only found 2 quests I could not do, and those folks<br/>
were apprehensive to me before carillion.  In both cases I merely did 2 of<br/>
their lower faction quests and that coupled with Carillion were enough to<br/>
put me over the hump to get the quests.  Of course I haven&#39;t tried any evil<br/>
quests, but then why would I want to?<br/>
