***Announcements***<br/>
<br/>
The City of Paineel, home to the infamous Heretics of Erudin, is now <br/>
available via the Optional Patch. In addition, Erudites may now also be <br/>
Shadowknights in addition to the other classes available to them. All <br/>
Erudite Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Clerics who worship the God of <br/>
Fear, Cazic-Thule, now start in the City of Paineel. As such, if you wish to <br/>
create a character of this type from this point forward, you *must* download <br/>
the Paineel zone-files via the Optional Patch.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that if you downloaded the Paineel zone files recently, you must <br/>
run the Optional Patch again to insure you have the correct version of the <br/>
files.<br/>
<br/>
In related news, all of the entrances to the Qeynos Catacombs have been <br/>
fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>

***Patch Message***<br/>
<br/>
The following changes have been implemented on the live servers:<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Changes*<br/>
<br/>
- The recast delay for many of the Shaman buff-spells have been reduced.<br/>
- &quot;Reoccurring Amnesia&quot; has had its casting time reduced.<br/>
- &quot;Yaulp&quot; and &quot;Augmentation&quot; should now stack.<br/>
- &quot;Solidarity of Vision&quot; has had its duration increased.<br/>
- The Druid spell, &quot;Skin Like Nature&quot;, has been returned to its former <br/>
status due to popular opinion. As such, the damage-shield component has been <br/>
removed and the regeneration component has been re-applied.<br/>
- &quot;Sense Magic&quot; has been replaced in all cases by the &quot;True North&quot; spell. If <br/>
you have already inscribed the &quot;Sense Magic&quot; spell, the spell icon will now <br/>
automatically reflect &quot;True North&quot;.<br/>
- A bug that existed with several damage-shield spells, causing their damage <br/>
to be subtracted rather than added when stacked, has been corrected. The <br/>
spells will now stack properly.<br/>
- The &quot;Feign Death&quot; spell, when cast by a Necromancer, will now have a fixed <br/>
duration. The<br/>
Necromancer will receive several warnings prior to the spell wearing off. <br/>
This change was necessary because some Necromancers found a way to gain <br/>
experience through their pet while being AFK for an extended duration, such <br/>
as being in bed for the night. Note: This does not affect Shadowknights or <br/>
Monks.<br/>
- New Necromancer spells are now in game. Check your spell vendors.<br/>
- Alchemy has been revamped. Check with your local Shaman.<br/>
- DOT (Damage Over Time) spells will no longer hinder camping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*General Changes/Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- The dungeon of Paw has again received a minor update to slightly reduce <br/>
the difficulty of the zone.<br/>
<br/>
- All known issues with the SBLive soundcard have been corrected.<br/>
<br/>
- From this point forward, deleting a character will cause all corpses <br/>
belonging to that character to likewise be deleted. This change was made <br/>
primarily to stop a no-drop transfer bug. It also has the added effect of <br/>
cleaning up corpses for characters that people no longer intend to play.<br/>
<br/>
- Crippling Blows will now display the correct damage in the &quot;You have <br/>
scored a Crippling Blow (###)&quot; line.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Corpse Looting Exploit*<br/>
<br/>
Recently, an exploit was discovered that allowed certain unsavory <br/>
individuals to loot the corpses of other players without their consent. The <br/>
precise symptom of this is that the owner would find their corpse stripped <br/>
of everything except for no-drop items, and items in a bag with no-drop <br/>
items. This exploit was fixed in this patch.<br/>
<br/>
If you were affected by this exploit recently, you are entitled to a <br/>
reimbursement of your lost items<br/>
assuming that we still have a record of what you had. Please contact a GM <br/>
in-game to arrange for an investigation.<br/>
<br/>
During the course of the investigation, people who have exploited this bug <br/>
will be subject to disciplinary action by our GM staff up to and including <br/>
item wipes, suspension, and/or banishment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Rogue Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
Rogues received several enhancements as part of this patch:<br/>
<br/>
- The chance to score a critical hit with a throwing weapon has been <br/>
increased significantly.<br/>
<br/>
- When throwing a weapon from behind the NPC in question, a rogue now has a <br/>
chance to score a &quot;Deadly Strike&quot;, for enhanced damage above and beyond that <br/>
of a critical hit.<br/>
<br/>
- A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the &quot;Hide&quot; skill. It is <br/>
called &quot;Evade&quot;. This skill has the effect of lowering the amount that the <br/>
targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential of making the engaged <br/>
NPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) within the rogue&#39;s group. <br/>
It is essentially a &quot;reverse taunt&quot;. This ability helps mitigate the <br/>
negative effects of the rogue&#39;s exceedingly high damage-output potential. It <br/>
also will in-turn help the rogue do even more damage as the NPC is much more <br/>
likely to expose its back. It is engaged by targeting the NPC you wish to <br/>
&quot;Evade&quot; and pressing the &quot;Hide&quot; button. As a note, you must not be in combat <br/>
mode in order to use this ability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Mistwalker*<br/>
<br/>
The Mistwalker will once again cast its spell as often as it used to prior <br/>
to the last patch. However, the resulting pet will now automatically <br/>
&quot;dissipate&quot; after one combat round. The change that reduced the &quot;proc&quot; <br/>
percentage on the weapon was made due to an unintended interaction between <br/>
the pet and the target when several users of this weapon were attacking the <br/>
same target. Since the new pet now automatically dissipates after one round, <br/>
the reduced &quot;proc&quot; percentage was no longer necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Class-Specific Armor Quests*<br/>
<br/>
Class-Specific armor quests, especially those belonging to Clerics, <br/>
Paladins, and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms of how long it will <br/>
take the average person to acquire the armor. These classes, and others that <br/>
found particular pieces of their armor exceedingly difficult to obtain <br/>
should find it much easier now.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, a bug that hindered completion of the Bracer of Ro quest for <br/>
some races has been<br/>
corrected.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Tallon Zek*<br/>
<br/>
Loot rules for PvP deaths on the PvP-Teams server, Tallon Zek, have been <br/>
changed from &quot;Coin + 1 item&quot; to &quot;Coin Only&quot;. This change was made to study <br/>
the impact of loot-rules upon server population in reference to the <br/>
loot/efficiency disparity between caster and melee characters. This change <br/>
is a test, and may or may not be retained or rolled out across the other PvP <br/>
servers, pending the results of the server population study over the next <br/>
few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Plane Changes*<br/>
<br/>
Several changes have been implemented in the Planes as part of this patch:<br/>
<br/>
- Characters will now lose all enchantments upon entering the Plane of Sky<br/>
<br/>
- Due to the fact that the levitate-series no longer works within the Plane <br/>
of Sky, a teleporter has been placed to allow entrance into the quest room.<br/>
<br/>
- A teleporter has been placed within the Plane of Hate in order to give <br/>
non-casters a way out of the zone besides death, potion, or group teleport.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Loot Messages*<br/>
<br/>
Messages indicating what has been looted from a corpse will now be broadcast <br/>
to everyone within the looters group. This change was made due to public <br/>
request and to encourage trust within the group. We may, in the future, <br/>
employ filters to allow people to choose whether or not they wish to receive <br/>
loot messages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Fiery Avenger*<br/>
<br/>
The greatly anticipated defining blade of the Paladin, the &quot;Fiery Avenger&quot;, <br/>
is again available within game via a quest. The *first* devout Paladin to <br/>
wield this blade and be validated by a GM in-game will be publicly <br/>
congratulated within a patch message and on the Official EverQuest web-site <br/>
at www.everquest.com.<br/>
