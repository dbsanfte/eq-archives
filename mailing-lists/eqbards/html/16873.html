<div id="ygrps-yiv-625619413">When i was a young bard, I dreamed about a combine weapon.  My friends and i<br/>
had made a trip to Everlost and met an ice boned skeleton.  That was the<br/>
first time i saw the message &quot;you try to slash an ice boned skel but he is<br/>
INVULNERABLE!&quot;  Ack!  what is that?  Well, you need magical weapons to hit<br/>
certain monsters and &quot;combine&quot; weaps are ones you can purchase.  A combine<br/>
dagger goes for about 33pp, long sword and scimitars about 62pp.  They are<br/>
sold at the gypsy camps in North Karana, Lavastorm and Rathe Mountains.  Of<br/>
all 3 places, I&#39;d say Rathe Mountains is the safest although perhaps<br/>
furthest one to get to.  Lavastorm has lots of fire elementals that can<br/>
attack and they are nasty.  North Karana has griffins and lions and such<br/>
that come right thru the gypsy camp.  Rathe Mts has far fewer monsters so<br/>
very close to the camp but it woould be quite a trek to get there.<br/>
<br/>
Another great magical weapon is the Dragoon Dirk. They are sold fairly often<br/>
for 40 to 60pp.<br/>
