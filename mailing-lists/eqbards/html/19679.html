<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904457940">I thought the lizard blood potion, or whatever it is was a Gate to the Cazic<br/>
Wizard Gate?<br/>
<br/>
My main use for Gate would be to return to FV or wherever every evening.<br/>
Otherwise the druid or wizard, if we had one, would have to tp us to<br/>
Dreadlands which we&#39;d then have to traverse the entirety of.  Don&#39;t really<br/>
need it as an escape route.<br/>

Gate would be a nice effect to drop off a level 20 mob.  It does drop off<br/>
level 35ish mobs (the cenobite? in CT? And PoF mobs too drop a wand with a<br/>
gate.) And they need to make Shaman potions reasonable - to make and to buy.<br/>
But its a low level spell.</div>
