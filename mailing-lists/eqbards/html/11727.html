<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030079266">Hiya guys,<br/>
<br/>
I had a great weekend, and all because of saturday night..........<br/>
<br/>
I logged on at about 10pm, and was bored looking for something to do. I<br/>
really wanted to camp this guise and spoke to my guild and one of them was<br/>
in Lower Guk, he&#39;s a level 39 wizzie and I grouped with him. We formed a<br/>
good group, had 2 wizzies, 1 cleric, 1 enchanter, 1 paladin (the puller)<br/>
and little old me. Everything we was killing conned RED but despite this I<br/>
didn&#39;t get amazing exp. Made 1/2 bubble (at hell level 30) in 2 1/2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I wasn&#39;t much use to the group I was very welcome to stay with<br/>
them, and after 2 1/2 hours the assassin eventually spawned (constant ph&#39;s<br/>
before hand), we killed him and my wizzie friend looted. The word &quot;Mask&quot;<br/>
was uttered and I looted....woooohoooo, I now have whats called &#39;A Mask of<br/>
Deception&#39;, I then left the group which we aggreed would be better for all<br/>
of us. I set of to North FP to do a bit of RP&#39;ing.<br/>
<br/>
Arrived in N FP and spent an hour or so there and someone /auction MM<br/>
Battle Drum 1000pp.<br/>
I REALLY wanted to buy this and told the person I&#39;d take it but to give me<br/>
time, she agreed and I sold my Plat Star Ruby Veil for 600pp and 2 Jagged<br/>
Bands. Sold my Dragoon Dirk for 75pp. This left me with 887pp (I had 200 or<br/>
so plat to begin with). I managed to sell a Lambent stone for 113pp and<br/>
after 20 frantic minutes of rushing around like a stockbroker I got the<br/>
Drums &quot;Wooooohooooooo&quot; I love this game. I now run EVEN faster.......<br/>
I&#39;ve also got ALL the components for my Lambent now.<br/>
<br/>
Crap weekend exp wise however. Died twice in total, got killed by the<br/>
trainer in the bard guild, she hit for 350+ dmg, I didn&#39;t last long.<br/>
And the second death was when I tried to kill the 2 druids in E Commons,<br/>
both con even to me, I charmed 1 and after taking 3 bubbles dmg from the<br/>
druid&#39;s punchs 60+ dmg and spells. One was dead and the other was low on<br/>
health, so I went in and meleed him, we were both down to a slither of<br/>
health (half a bub) and I had him feared, for some reason even though he<br/>
was feared he managed to turn around and hit me 3 times for 50+ dmg, I<br/>
died. Didn&#39;t loose much exp though, I think the druid I did kill gave me<br/>
VERY good exp.<br/>
I really must practice my charming methods as I&#39;m not confident enough to<br/>
charm Giants yet, although I think these druids may pose more of a problem<br/>
due to the spells they cast.<br/>
<br/>
Well enough of my rabble, I hope everyone had a good weekend like I did...<br/>
