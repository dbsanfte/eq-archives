<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245647153">A few notes I have made.<br/>
1. 	Elemental and Purifying Rhythms do not stack, so +46 is the best MR<br/>
boost you 	can get.  +46 still puts me over 100 so nothing to sneeze<br/>
at!<br/>
<br/>
2.	Have noticed no difference with the Aquatic Ayre with or without<br/>
flute.<br/>
<br/>
3.	Flute does affect Carillion, but only slightly.  I had made a habit<br/>
of checking 	it and on two occassions I was able to detect a difference.<br/>
Once I went from 	Amiable to Amiable with song, and to Kindly with<br/>
flute.  The other time I went 	from Indifferent to Amiable with song, but<br/>
could not get quest.  With flute I 	was also Amiable, but obviously<br/>
higher Amiable as I was able to get quest after 	using the flute.<br/>
Keep in mind Amiable is about 2-4 times as large, faction 	points wise,<br/>
as Indifferent, Apprehensive, or Dubious.  Not sure if Kindly is as 	big<br/>
a faction point range as Amiable, but I would guess it is the same.<br/>
<br/>
4.	I&#39;ll retest Chords tonite if I get the chance, but as I recall it<br/>
does 2pts + 	1/6 lvls per pulse when sung and 5 + 1/6 when played just<br/>
like Hymn.  My memory 	could be faulty on that, but it is easy enough to<br/>
test what it does at 16th as I 	am currently there, again.<br/>
<br/>
	I would love to have some better examples of how to use Lullaby<br/>
effectively.  	Here is my situation:  I generally am fighting<br/>
whites/blues/yellows, but they 	are usually surrounded by greens that ignore<br/>
me.  If I lullaby the greens will 	stop ignoring me or my group and<br/>
then there will be trouble as the greens 	generally outnumber the ones<br/>
we fight two to one!  Should I not worry about 	this?  Will the greens<br/>
resist so infrequently that they won&#39;t matter in the 	fight?  Any<br/>
suggestions along these lines would be appreciated as I&#39;d like to 	see<br/>
Lullaby becaome as useful as the rest of my songs.<br/>
