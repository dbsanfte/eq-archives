<div id="ygrps-yiv-799943197">Being a longtime UO player - and looking for a &#39;virtual world&#39; - this has<br/>
ALWAYS been my #1 complaint about EQ - also the clue that OSI is most<br/>
afraid Verant will catch onto.<br/>
<br/>
I love both - but UO is a &#39;world&#39; - EQ is a &#39;game&#39; in it&#39;s current state.<br/>
<br/>
People live in worlds - practically indefinately. People win games and move<br/>
onto something else.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Actually you get to play a new class so not boring. They have to fix<br/>
&gt;&gt; overcrowding with high levels first and their is no reason they should<br/>
&gt;&gt; bother with anything else until that happens otherwise Verant will lose a<br/>
&gt;&gt; good percentage of their customers.<br/>

&gt;This is actually a criticism Raph Koster (Designer Dragon) had<br/>
&gt;with EQ.  As currently implemented, EQ is an advancement-based<br/>
&gt;game.  After you hit the top level, there is little to do<br/>
&gt;besides the same thing over and over to get more stuff.  UO<br/>
&gt;(even with its faults) gets around the problem by being more<br/>
&gt;of a social game - there are lots of new things you can do<br/>
&gt;once you max out all your skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now that the ranks of L50 players are growing, Verant is<br/>
&gt;having to come to terms with this problem.  The expansion will<br/>
&gt;only delay the problem, not solve it.  If the level cap is<br/>
&gt;raised to 75, they&#39;ll run into the same problem when people<br/>
&gt;start to hit L75.  (And now you know why I think it&#39;s really<br/>
&gt;stupid to buy a L50 character on EBay. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Btw, if the poll on the Everlore site is accurate, L45-50<br/>
&gt;players make up about 6% of the playerbase.<br/>
