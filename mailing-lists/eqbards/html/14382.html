<div id="ygrps-yiv-89328790"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yeah, I want to know the meaning behind the &quot;Gnolls playing poker&quot; Painting<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Dangit, those aren&#39;t gnolls!  hehe.<br/>
<br/>
  Kobolds, goblins, and (if I may be so bold) that big ass dog I think<br/>
  is Nagafen.<br/>
<br/>
  Fire Giants hate Goblins, vice versa.<br/>
  Nagafen likes Fire Giants, vice versa.<br/>
  <br/>
  therefore Goblins hate Nagafen, vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
  Gnomes hate Kobolds, vice versa.<br/>
  <br/>
  Do gnomes hate goblins?  If so, why are they living in Solusek.<br/>
  Why would the goblins even let them?<br/>
<br/>
  Did the Kobolds capture and lock up Nagafen?  Or are the kobolds<br/>
  protecting Nagafen?  The fire giants protect Nagafen, but the <br/>
  goblins don&#39;t like the fire giants, why?<br/>
<br/>
  The kobolds have a goblin (guano harvester) that seems to be their<br/>
  slave.  I mean who would walk about and collect bat poop in a bag<br/>
  on their own?  <br/>
<br/>
  Do the kobolds dislike the goblins?<br/>
<br/>
  All this is painted on the walls of SolusekB, all these races<br/>
  are repsented on the walls.  To answer your question here as<br/>
  well Kit.  There are wall/cave paintings all over inside Solb,<br/>
  they depict a story, I want to know the story.<br/>
