<div id="ygrps-yiv-552983082">Thanks for this and all other answers I&#39;ve gotten on the list.  I<br/>
usually don&#39;t say thinaks since it ends up spamming the list, but felt<br/>
compelled to put a genral thanks out to all that have helped.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very good list, I can&#39;t decide if I like this or the cleric<br/>
list better...<br/>
<br/>
Off the equipment thread:  I acquired a blood stained mantle recently.<br/>
(with my cleric)  I can&#39;t decide whethere I should give it to my bard,<br/>
or to the warrior in my cleric&#39;s party.  Our party shares all equipment<br/>
and money (IE we let the high CHA character loot everything and sell<br/>
it.  Just decide what we should buy, and who gets the neat stuff we<br/>
loot).  However, the party owes my bard some stuff (he acquired a few<br/>
bronze peices for various people), about equivalent to what I paid for<br/>
the mantle.  What do you think i should do?  The war has bronze<br/>
shoudlers right now (acquired by my bard, heh)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
