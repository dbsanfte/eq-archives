 </span></blockquote>  Innoruuk server highlevel guilds are begining to pick up bards<br/>
  like mad.  There are very few highlevel &#39;knowledgable&#39; bards<br/>
  on Innoruuk.  The few that are out there were swept up into<br/>
  the top guilds, the up and coming bards (that show promise)<br/>
  are being pulled into said guilds as well.  Perhaps to be <br/>
  powered up to a level where they become more useful.  Bards <br/>
  have always been sort of outcasts, but now the true power is<br/>
  shining through.  Lots of people are playing 2nd toon bards,<br/>
  as well.<br/>
