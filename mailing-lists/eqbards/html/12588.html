&gt;   Starting a new thread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   So who would you want?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   A L41 bard, twisting Elemental (47 magic, 47 heat, 47 cold)<br/>
&gt;                        Guardian  (47 magic)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   or<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   A L50 bard, twisting Elemental (56 magic, 56 heat, 56 cold)<br/>
&gt;                        Guardian  (56 magic)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   [I think I got those numbers right, correct me if I&#39;m wrong]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s really a no brainer, to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   All the servers that I know of currently have no excuse for bringing<br/>
&gt;   anyone less than L49, unless:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   1) you are just funning around, wow a dragon, cool.<br/>
&gt;   2) it&#39;s your guild event, and you are up for dying.<br/>
&gt;   3) it&#39;s your friends who happen to all be L50, and just you are lower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The elite guild, as much as I dislike them, on our server killed<br/>
&gt;   Nagafen less than 90 mins after the server came up.  They are all L50,<br/>
&gt;   and have the best stuff in the game.  They know exactly what to do with<br/>
&gt;   less than 25 people.  For that, I respect them.  But that&#39;s about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   All other guilds who have attempted Vox have failed, and failed<br/>
&gt;   badly.  From what I understand you have to have to right people.<br/>
&gt;   Since the pool of available people is large on most servers, why<br/>
&gt;   in the world would you pick a knowledgable lower level person over<br/>
&gt;   a knowledgable higher level one?  You cannot bring everyone, so<br/>
&gt;   who do you bring?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well duh Harmonic :)<br/>
<br/>
But on 3 of the 8 dragon runs I have been on I have been the ONLY bard <br/>
there.  The most bards we have had at a run I have been on is 4, the average <br/>
is 2.  So sometimes you just have to make do.<br/>
