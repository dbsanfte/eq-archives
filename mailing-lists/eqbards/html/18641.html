<div id="ygrps-yiv-271303796">Well, last night I too searched the Mines of Nurga and found nothing.<br/>
We moved to the Temple of Droga and made a startling discovery.  There<br/>
is at least one oven and one pottery kiln in the town-like areas or in<br/>
the prison areas of Droga. (We didn&#39;t get far in, the information came<br/>
from a 53 mage who was running around solo).  The mage who gave the<br/>
information said that he hadn&#39;t actually clicked them to see if they<br/>
worked, but it looked like they might and he&#39;d check for me and let me<br/>
know.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve already said too much, does that mean a forage or two near<br/>
Kurn&#39;s tower where the burynai seem to live would do it?  <br/>
