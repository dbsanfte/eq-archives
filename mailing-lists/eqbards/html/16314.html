 </span></blockquote>I have a hard time understanding what you&#39;re saying here.  <br/>
It&#39;s worth it to sit there for hours hoping for two named<br/>
spawns, but not worth it to sit there for one?  What about all<br/>
the spots where there is only a single named spawn?  Are these<br/>
spots simply not worth your time no matter what?<br/>
<br/>
The MO I&#39;ve seen nearly everywhere is to camp one named mob<br/>
site, while pulling generic mobs from other locations.  The<br/>
only 2-named-mob sites that come to mind are the<br/>
assassin/supplier, and the king room in permafrost.  Maybe the<br/>
maid/butler room in Mistmoore.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re still not looking at the big picture.  Yes you might<br/>
lose half your time this time.  But instead of having to wait<br/>
2 weeks before getting another crack at it, you can go back<br/>
tomorrow, no waiting (well, aside from the waiting for the<br/>
named mob to show).<br/>
<br/>
This rule does not change the crowding, does not change the<br/>
mob spawn rate, does not change the item drop rate.  It only<br/>
changes the composition and number of the people camping those<br/>
mobs.  If it results in casual players having easier access to<br/>
oft-camped mobs, then it improves their chances of getting<br/>
items from that mob.  If the mob still remains camped to the<br/>
point where casual players are discouraged, then it is<br/>
*already* camped to the point where casual players are<br/>
discouraged.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Result is you move on to find something you can actually enjoy your two<br/>

&gt; Eventually the short timers will find everything shared and will quit in<br/>
&gt; frustration as they never get a turn at getting a useful chance to do a room<br/>
&gt; instead getting many turns that are not very useful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Define &quot;useful chance&quot; and &quot;not very useful.&quot;  If you normally<br/>
only had a shot at a named spawn once every 2 weeks, and under<br/>
the new rules if every named spawn has an average of 2 groups<br/>
(highly unlikely as I don&#39;t think there are that many players<br/>
despite the overcrowding); then your shot at getting a night<br/>
at the named spawn has gone from 1 in 14 days to an effective<br/>
1 in 2 days.  If you normally had a shot at a named spawn<br/>
point once every 2 days, then it&#39;s not camped to the point<br/>
where it&#39;ll be a problem under the old or the new rules.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why so many people are so vehemently<br/>
opposed to the concept of sharing.  When I first started the<br/>
game, that&#39;s how I played.  Share the derv camp, share the orc<br/>
camp.  I only went along with the camper-has-all-rights rule<br/>
because that seemed to be the majority consensus.  And even<br/>
then, if I was group leader and holding a spot with multiple<br/>
named mobs in a crowded zone when another group came looking,<br/>
I gave them the extra.<br/>
<br/>
I really think this is one of those prisoner&#39;s dilemma<br/>
situations, where the bad choice from an individual<br/>
cost/benefit analysis results in the best outcome for everyone<br/>
overall (and the good choice from an individual cost/benefit<br/>
analysis results in the worst outcome for everyone overall).<br/>
