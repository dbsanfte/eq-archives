I will always believe that is in<br/>
&gt; *MY* best interest to not use Yaks because most of my time is spent on<br/>
large<br/>
&gt; raids where I want as little attention to myself as possible. I have seen<br/>
&gt; log analyes but have not performed any tests myself. I have seen both<br/>
&gt; weapons compared endlessly with this person or that person comparing logs<br/>
&gt; and analyzing with different formulas. I&#39;ve seen tests where the yak beat<br/>
&gt; out the wak, and I&#39;ve seen tests where Waks beat out Yak with procs. </span></blockquote></div>
