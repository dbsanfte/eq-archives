<div id="ygrps-yiv-77247866">Something I thought about wrt testing song effects:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;test mobs&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Like John uses wisps to time attacks, maybe other mobs could serve as test<br/>
cases.  For example, to find out the damage out put of DoT&#39;s where no<br/>
explicit numbers are shown on the screen, we could take a &#39;known quantity&#39;<br/>
like a young kodiak and use say Curtailing chant with a drum. Start song and<br/>
stop it.  Wait for message that says the effect is gone and start it again.<br/>
Do this a total of 3 or 4 times. Then kill it with bellow and record the<br/>
non-melee dmg numbers.  Then do the math to find out what the dmg per tick<br/>
for the song is.  You would need to know the total hp&#39;s of the mob - was<br/>
this listed on some eq sniffer site? Or bellow one to death and add up the<br/>
numbers.<br/>
<br/>
This would remove the uncertainty of the PvP/Duel nerf factor that you get<br/>
when testing it on your friend or yourself.  Does self inflicted song have<br/>
the PvP nerf factor?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried medleying just 4 dot&#39;s in combat?  (not<br/>
&gt; &gt; that this is optimal but it would be interesting to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; the result). ;) </span></blockquote></div>
