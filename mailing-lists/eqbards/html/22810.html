<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848267179">To you all that have been to Velious... Which factions are you watching out<br/>
for?<br/>
<br/>
from the little that I&#39;ve been/understand of it is that you kill 1 other 2<br/>
like you and so on<br/>
<br/>
Dragons/Giants/Dwarves<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to raise all 3? or 2 out of 3?<br/>
<br/>
I really like the dwarf city, was pretty amazed when i saw it, but it just<br/>
seems to me like if the giant city is much more usefull as a faction but<br/>
harder to raise from what I&#39;ve been told.<br/>
<br/>
The way i see it is the dwarves are to the center and so are the dragons<br/>
where as the giants are right in the middle of the map and you have to go<br/>
through the zone, sure we can go in invisible but that just makes it<br/>
annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone correct me on any of this or point me in the right direction to<br/>
raise factions.<br/>
<br/>
My bard is 42 and agnostic wood elf <br/>
my necro is 52 DE and worships N&#39;Inniruk<br/>
<br/>
Any light that anyone can shed on factions in Vel would be greatly<br/>
appreciated<br/>
