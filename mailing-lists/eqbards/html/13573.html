&gt; This last dragon buff was done in reaction to an exploit (well, maybe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an exploit or maybe it&#39;s a techique - hard to say.)  And in a way that only<br/>
&gt; Verant can achieve they have changed things so that now all groups will use<br/>
&gt; the same technique (or exploit) that Verant was trying to<br/>
&gt; stop/overcome/address &lt;sheesh&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems that Dragon Fear would not &#39;stick&#39; if you had 15 (or was it more<br/>
&gt; than 15) buff icons. Did not matter much what they were, just stack 15 buff<br/>
&gt; icons on your screen and you were resistant to Dragon Fear.  Granted some<br/>
&gt; adventurers prolly paid dearly finding this out and perhaps they had some<br/>
&gt; &#39;right&#39; to employ this technique.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I think there&#39;s more to the &quot;exploit&quot; (bs it&#39;s a bug) than<br/>
this. I&#39;ve had dragon fear consistantly not stick to me with less than<br/>
all 15 buff spots filled as well. I&#39;ve had the icon up but still been<br/>
able to cast.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; So, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>
&gt; whatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - 15,<br/>
&gt; 20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t help. While I disagree that the stipping is totally random (in<br/>
almost every case on me it seems to take the oldest first) The sheer<br/>
number that get stripped pretty well guarantee it isnt going to help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But anyhow - I&#39;d say dont worry.  In 2004, when you go for your dragon, it<br/>
&gt; will be a different dragon than the ones fought today just as ours are<br/>
&gt; different from the ones fought 5 months ago.  We have new tactics; you will<br/>
&gt; have new tactics.  I think you will have great fun when you time comes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again I disagree. Because of the physical and software limitations of<br/>
Verant&#39;s servers and clients, they are already pushing the limits of how<br/>
many people can be involved in a dragon hunt. Eventually they are going<br/>
to push it past the number that can participate without half the people<br/>
going link dead immediately. <br/>
<br/>
They also have upped the effectiveness of the AoE spells. I took pretty<br/>
well full damage this last trip with the same cold resist gear that had<br/>
me taking minimal damage the two trips I did before, just a week before<br/>
the patch (gotta love server crashes.)<br/>
<br/>
As well, I don&#39;t know if anyone else noticed, but at least one of their<br/>
&quot;emergency&quot; patchs was because they forgot to buff Vox. We killed her<br/>
after the main patch fine (got wasted by the new, improved Nagafen) but<br/>
when we went back after the next day&#39;s &quot;emergency&quot; patch, she&#39;d been<br/>
buffed up to be as evil as Nagafen was after the main patch.<br/>
