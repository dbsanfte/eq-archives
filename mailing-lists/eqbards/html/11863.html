&gt; statement about &#39;bards like you&#39;.  I fled instantly, but since I knew<br/>
&gt; neither I nor my groupmate who wasn&#39;t even in the zone, had attacked the<br/>
&gt; guards I feel sure some bug occurred.  I /bugged it at the time.  Has anyone<br/>
&gt; else had similar things happen to them when their song radius might have<br/>
&gt; included someone but did not actually affect them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yes, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
  Never Selo&#39;s an invisible Dark Elf past the Halas Guards.  heheheh =)<br/>
<br/>
  My song pulse (despite the fact that the DE was invis) still<br/>
  really pisses off those guards and they are really good at chasing<br/>
  you.<br/>
