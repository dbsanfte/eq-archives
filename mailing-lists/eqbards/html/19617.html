<div id="ygrps-yiv-890960774">I think the failed raider shows how incredibly flawed Verant&#39;s Random Number<br/>
Generator is.  Many things seem to go for hours (days?) without every<br/>
triggering; then the RNG goes nuts and pops many many times in a row.  We&#39;ve<br/>
had two people so far claim it was &quot;easy to get&quot; and three (counting me)<br/>
reporting it difficult.  My good friend Darkfox who&#39;s on my server and this<br/>
list has also reported it&#39;s a &quot;Semi-Rare&quot; spawn...<br/>
<br/>
I spent about four hours there.  Hooked up with a group 50-55 who were after<br/>
the named guy at the Church to get a fang for a quest for a key to get into<br/>
Howling Stones and to explore the zone.  They cleared the library - no<br/>
failed raider - no coin.  They had moved on by the time I got there.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after I joined them - another group came in to camp the library.<br/>
They were there a good three hours (by the time I moved on) maybe longer.<br/>
Unless they were bullshitting me (which I doubt) - they didn&#39;t get a single<br/>
Failed Raider - and nothing else dropped the coin.  They had a bard in their<br/>
group - so I was hoping they&#39;d get two.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt they were bullshitting.  If they did get a bunch and were hoarding<br/>
them for various reasons; they fairly got the room while my group was<br/>
camping elsewhere - why would they lie?<br/>
<br/>
We all know the rules of random sampling - a 2 hour sample of a 30 minute<br/>
spawn is 4 samples - you got a 50 pct hit.  Another group got six tried and<br/>
0 pct hit... (Plus my groups sample - they cleared the room only once<br/>
though)<br/>

Kaesora is virtually deserted on Inny. Like I posted, been there 2 times<br/>
now.  First time, cleared into the Library and presto there was the coin<br/>
guy.  Second time, cleared library, no coin, cleared the other stuff in the<br/>
area, library re-spawned and we got the coin guy.  Less than 2 hours.  Might<br/>
have been the 3rd time to clear the Library but seems to be a fast 30 min<br/>
timer in that zone.<br/>
