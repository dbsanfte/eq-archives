<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589295796"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Why would you want to play AE songs?  What songs are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, I have to agree here, in these type of areas and most likely<br/>
  in any multimob scenarios you&#39;ll want to lay off any AE.  It&#39;s just<br/>
  not a good habit of getting into.  It was fun to Lullaby things when<br/>
  you were L15, it was cute to play binding at L20, hell at L48 I got<br/>
  a kick out of that song too, until I got stomped into the ground.<br/>
<br/>
  Songs either just don&#39;t keep up or are decreased in power so that<br/>
  they just aren&#39;t effective to use once you exceed the song level.<br/>
  We may be able to DDD/COD PCs in a duel and blue NPCs around L25,<br/>
  but above L35 if you try any of that junk you&#39;ll get kicked in the<br/>
  junk ;-)  <br/>
