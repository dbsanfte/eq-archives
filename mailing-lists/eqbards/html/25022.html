<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930627219">Psalm of Vitality, Psalm of Purity.  Are they supposed to cure Disease/Poison?  And if so, why don&#39;t<br/>
they?  And if they do, why don&#39;t they do it better (e.g., why can&#39;t I cure Rabies after 30 minutes of<br/>
constant play)?  And why don&#39;t they scale up with level?<br/>

&gt; Ester know.  If enough people post to her, she may make a statement about<br/>
&gt; it and hopefully fix it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Many months ago Ester told us that the caster animation that bards make<br/>
&gt; when using the chants would be fixed.  Nothing has been done.<br/>
&gt; 2) The sound effects on Shield of song is annoying to most people.  Can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; we get rid of this?<br/>
&gt; 3) There is no text message for Shield of Song.<br/>
&gt; 4) Though not directly bard related it is a bit.  Around the time of the<br/>
&gt; DX7 patch the off/low/med/high particle effect settings became broken.  Off<br/>
&gt; now displays what low used to be.  The &quot;new&quot; low is no different from<br/>
&gt; medium and high.  I bumped a post about this nearly six months ago.  Ester<br/>
&gt; said they would look in to it.  Nothing has been done. </span></blockquote></div>
