Subject: A Few Questions for Fellow Bards....<br/>
<br/>
Hello there all! I have a few questions that arose during my adventure<br/>
today....<br/>
<br/>
1) I have a Lute called &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; or something like that.<br/>
Does anyone know if it has any significance? Is it just a quest item? I<br/>
tried using it, and it works in all respects (that I could tell) like a<br/>
normal Lute. Nothing special. I did notice that I could sell it for almost 4<br/>
plat, where a normal lute doesn&#39;t make it to 1 plat. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, can&#39;t help you there. Anyone else have any info on this? Sounds interesting.<br/>
<br/>
2) I also just picked up &quot;Lisera&quot;, a lute that a bard in Qeynos needs<br/>
tuning. He says that I need to take it to someone named Nostrolo in the<br/>
&quot;Karanas&quot;. But, I looked and looked and could not FINFD This Nostrolo<br/>
person. Is this a broken quest, or have I just missed this fella? Could<br/>
someone give me an idea where to look for Nostrolo? Also, is Lisera a lute<br/>
you should KEEP, meaning is IT better than a regular Lute?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not certain what if anything special it does, but Nostrolo can be found in South Karana, between the bridge to N Karana and splitpaw (roughly, it&#39;s a little bit east) He hangs out by this low stone structure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) Does anyone know of a site that has descriptions of what songs do above<br/>
24th level??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
eqvault has a pretty good spell list, but it doesn&#39;t go up too high. I&#39;d really be interested to hear from some of the higher level Bards in this group as to what some of the cooler songs are at lvls 30 and above. I for one am really looking forward to Aria of Eagles. Had a shaman cast levitate on our party the other night, and it was a blast.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So How about it oh higher level brothers and sisters in Song. What are some of the higher lvl songs like? Any favorites? Anyone tried out Denons Desperate Dirge yet? How did it do?<br/>
<br/>
