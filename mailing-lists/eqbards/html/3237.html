<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318061015">I just joined the mailing and wanted to say hey to everyone. I play on the Innoruuk server and have just reached lvl 12. Even though I&#39;ve been a bard for a while now, I still have many questions. First off, I hear about how people can twist songs to get multiple effects. At what point does this become a part of everyday bard life? Right now, it works, but I guess I&#39;m just not used to it because I hardly ever see the use. Also, for soloing, what are two good songs to stack at my lvl?I can get to working on my stacking skill. :) <br/>
    Also, I have a secret for all of my fellow bards. Do pottery. Make pie tins until you puke. Right now, at lvl 12, I have a complete set of bronze armor and 250pp in the bank all because I make pie tins and sell them to NPC Merchants. Halas is the best place to do it because everything you need is in one zone and close together. Seriously, give it a try. You will not be disappointed. <br/>
