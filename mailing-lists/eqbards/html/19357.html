<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546952405">Kitasi and the other gentleman (sorry...no sig...couldn&#39;t tell) Have a quite<br/>
valid point.  There are so many things wrong with handling even a *portion* of<br/>
the drop/trade code on the client side.  The best &#39;for instance&#39; i can give is<br/>
this list...this thread even.  How many of us are developers, or some related<br/>
field?  How many of us would have the skill to hack the client to dupe items in<br/>
the way that Kit stated would be possible?  &quot;most of us&quot; would appear to be the<br/>
correct response.  <br/>
<br/>
Chances are that the client does send a mouse_click message to the<br/>
server...either the item on the cursor is sent as a parameter or the server<br/>
queries for the cursor &quot;container&quot; and whether or not it is populated, and by<br/>
what.  Then, it can determine what action to take (such as trade with obj<br/>
X/drop to world/&quot;this item cannot be dropped traded or sold.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
However there is some evidence that Lyrnia(sp?)/rokenn&#39;s theory may be<br/>
feasable.  I was thinking about casting a spell...how is that handled (client<br/>
server wise)?  You cannot drop/trade while casting. Nor can you have a trade<br/>
initiated while casting.  Does the Client send a server message &quot;Started<br/>
casting&quot; and then a &quot;finished casting&quot; message, in which case the Server would<br/>
hold the flag. Or (in the case of someone trying to trade with the caster) does<br/>
the server try to initiate a trade, and the *client* respond &quot;no, i&#39;m busy&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
there is a fairly large number of options available for how this was done...but<br/>
i suspect that if one were to guess &quot;server side&quot; on most of it, they would be<br/>
correct.<br/>
<br/>
there is also a possibility that all the programmer-types here have ignored the<br/>
possibility of a bad implementation...see the current threads on EQ Forums on<br/>
the Illusions+Mez in PVP.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that is *more than enough* input from me i think :)<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
