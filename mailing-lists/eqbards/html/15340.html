<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623943008">Ah, another husband/wife team.  I got Everquest for Christmas and was<br/>
immediately hooked.  Fortunately for me, so was my husband.  We now have<br/>
it on two computers (and two phone lines, two internet providers, 2<br/>
accounts...) and play together in the evening after the kids&#39; bedtime. <br/>
I&#39;m a bard and he&#39;s now a human shadowknight (strange combo, no?).  We<br/>
recently spent a romatic weekend in Norrath - 2 days with no kids<br/>
(thankyou inlaws!), playing more Everquest than we probably should.<br/>

&gt; Ah, the fun of real life. Good travels to you Harmonic. I&#39;m sure we all hope<br/>
&gt; to hear from you in the future.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been lucky enough to get my wife to start playing recently. I scrounged<br/>
&gt; up a 2nd computer so we can play side by side. It&#39;s made life a lot easier,<br/>
&gt; however I haven&#39;t been playing Windleaf as often since I&#39;m playing a new<br/>
&gt; character along with her (I&#39;m a cleric, she&#39;s a ranger, both level 10 right<br/>
&gt; now). (We have a 9 month old daughter, but find time to play when she goes<br/>
&gt; to sleep.)<br/>
