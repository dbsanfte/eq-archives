&gt; &gt; Ok, so this works for say the guilds. Does it sift through <br/>
&gt; the zone fields<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well? (At work, I can&#39;t test this for myself right now.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, and I very much doubt it ever will.  Sure it&#39;d be <br/>
&gt; convenient, a nice<br/>
&gt; timesaver, but as is I just look for someone I know in a <br/>
&gt; particular zone<br/>
&gt; and ask them how many people are in it.  Being able to list <br/>
&gt; all the people<br/>
&gt; in a zone you&#39;re not in takes away from the anonymity <br/>
&gt; function, and gives<br/>
&gt; a further sense of omnipotence to the player.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But then I suppose wish lists are just that. -.-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it is a &quot;wish&quot;, but a technically non-challenging as they already have<br/>
the code in place for doing this already.<br/>
<br/>
It would just be nice to know how crowded certain zones. I don&#39;t think that<br/>
this conflicts with any ideals that Verant has as they&#39;ve already<br/>
established precedents. They give you server statistics so you know how<br/>
crowded each server is, why not zones?<br/>
<br/>
If Verant really wanted to at least restrict usage of this, they could set<br/>
up a &quot;board&quot; in each city that you go to (just like the message board). You<br/>
click on it and see a window that lists the number of people in each zone.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding &quot;omnipotence&quot; concerns, if Verant was worried about that, there<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a &quot;who&quot; function to begin with. Regarding &quot;anonymity&quot;, someone<br/>
would have to search each zone in order to find the person. IMHO if Verant<br/>
intended &quot;anon&quot; to really hide whether you&#39;re in a zone or not, they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have anon people show up in a regular /who of the zone you&#39;re in.<br/>

Ah well, time to go a hunting! Have a good weekend.<br/>
