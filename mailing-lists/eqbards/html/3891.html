<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697532846"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;There was some other discussion about getting Hymn to stack<br/>
&gt;with another bard whose Hymn healed a different amount.  I<br/>
&gt;still haven&#39;t heard if anyone has tested any of the theories<br/>
&gt;we came up with about this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We finally got the hold message to not come up again so as to make it<br/>
appear that both bards where healing everybody in the group. But after much<br/>
discussion, it was just some sort of wierd server lag, cause we where not<br/>
getting 2x the amount of healing. After playing with the lute of the gypsy<br/>
princess, im pretty sure its only a quest item and not even the quest to<br/>
get the electrum wak thingee cause there is another quest to get that (and<br/>
it is entirely self contained in mistmoore). Also, at lvl 42 we should be<br/>
healing 20 pts per tick if im correct, i always thought that number was<br/>
standing, but its sitting it seems.</div>
