<div id="ygrps-yiv-393416482">I was fighting HG&#39;s in Rathe mountains last night<br/>
and noticed<br/>
some interesting things about the new fear and<br/>
charm messages.<br/>
The message that tells you that charm has worn of<br/>
seems to work<br/>
very well.  Yay!  This is a very nice addition.<br/>
The same message<br/>
for fear seem to work most of the time, but there<br/>
were also MANY<br/>
times when I got the message, &quot;Hill Giant flees in<br/>
terror.&quot;  And the<br/>
giant stood there and whacked on me...no message<br/>
about the giant<br/>
breaking fear, or anything.  Interestingly, this<br/>
seemed to happen<br/>
a LOT after the giant had been charmed, like it<br/>
was so pissed at<br/>
me it was unafraid (despite the message to the<br/>
contrary).  In any<br/>
case, I /petitioned it and they said they filed it<br/>
as a bug.  So if<br/>
you see this happening, be sure to /petition it (I<br/>
think /bug is useless).<br/>
