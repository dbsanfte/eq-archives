&gt;Notice that Hymn is listed as 1, but obviously does more than<br/>
&gt;1 point per tick.  I would guess that Skin: 10 would be<br/>
&gt;similar - either not related to hp, or modified by bard level.<br/>

Rune I - Protective Skin 27-55<br/>
Rune II - Protective Skin 71-118<br/>
Niv&#39;s - Protective Skin 10<br/>
<br/>
So, if someone will confirm how Rune works, it might indeed be a 10hp <br/>
absorption that refreshes every pulse, and affects the whole party.<br/>
