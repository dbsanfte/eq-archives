<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668113837"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;... Having a monster placeholder for a spawn that is 8 hours is<br/>
&gt; &gt;   absoultely ridiculous.  I don&#39;t envy clerics/shaman.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is obviously someone at Verant that needs the difference between<br/>
&gt; challenging and tedious explained to him. Preferable by someone with a<br/>
&gt; high 1H blunt skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not to mention the other obvious - not all EQ players are &quot;kids&quot; that have<br/>
lots of free time. I work full time and take classes two nites a week... Who<br/>
has time to camp that sort of a spawn??? If they continue doing this sort of<br/>
thing, I will never have any item worth getting because I simply don&#39;t have<br/>
the time it takes to get it.<br/>
