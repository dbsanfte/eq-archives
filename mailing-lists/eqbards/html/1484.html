&gt;Well it&#39;s all a matter of intent.  How can Verant say you intended to be<br/>
&gt;chased by a sand giant to lead it into some jerk?  They&#39;ll ban the idiot<br/>
&gt;doing this over and over, for the intent is clear.  But you do it once as a<br/>
&gt;matter of revenge, nobody can prove anything.  Just say, &quot;Ah, sorry about<br/>
&gt;that, I was being chased.&quot;  End of story.  (Besides, don&#39;t think they&#39;ll <br/>
&gt;ban<br/>
&gt;anybody enacting this once as revenge on a jerk.)<br/>

Anyways, I am not guilty of ever doing this intentionally, however I am <br/>
guilty of wishing it upon people. However cheesy I think the saying may be, <br/>
Two Wrongs Do Not Make a Right. And you may find yourself on the receiving <br/>
end of an intentional mob train by your last victim some time in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Over the last week I have been killing the oasis orcs in the camp at the end <br/>
of the beach. While I was resting, a troll player (name witheld) trained an <br/>
orc warrior, 2 orc priests, and &quot;a&quot; orc warrior (yes the badass orcs) on me. <br/>
I was killed (starting with a double-smack to the head for 40 points each <br/>
while i was sitting, and so on), and found myself back at the South Gate <br/>
wondering who the hell that troll was. Well I found out who, and I was <br/>
seriously considering training something on him, but I didn&#39;t.  I am pretty <br/>
sure it was unintentional, but either way I was pretty ticked off. I&#39;m not <br/>
that spiteful, though I may think it =)<br/>
<br/>
Later, Lockjaw spawned right on top of me near the camp and I acclerando&#39;d <br/>
the hell down the beach (not thinking about S Ro zone being so close in my <br/>
paniced state). I shouted warnings that I was zoning LJ a few times. Well, <br/>
halfway to zone I found that LJ was no longer following, and about 5 minutes <br/>
later had been killed. Then my party started receiving /tells from that <br/>
troll and his group. Lockjaw killed his entire party! I thought it was <br/>
humorous irony.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly thereafter, I saw the troll again. He was looking at an SG, then <br/>
looking at me and my party...back and forth...hmmm what was he thinking? <br/>
Well it became obvious when he ran up to the SG, tried to hit it and then <br/>
tried to run over to us. He didn&#39;t get very far though (not even close to <br/>
us), the SG splattered him all over the dunes.<br/>
<br/>
But you start to think, what if he is succesful one of these times? This <br/>
shit has to stop, we have enough trouble avoiding SG&#39;s on our own. So we <br/>
ended up having a talk with him and grouping up to kill crocs. Turns out he <br/>
wasn&#39;t such a bad troll after all, if a bit vengeful.<br/>
<br/>
Just think twice before doing things like this. Not only is it possible to <br/>
be banned (of course it&#39;s easier to get proof of this when you get a <br/>
screenshot of the text a would-be mob-trainer sends as he is gloating over <br/>
your corpse), you also risk the other party trying to exact revenge. <br/>
Sometimes it fails (as in my case), but who knows when they will succeed? <br/>
It&#39;s no fun trying to have a good time playing a game while someone is <br/>
trying very hard to spoil it.<br/>
