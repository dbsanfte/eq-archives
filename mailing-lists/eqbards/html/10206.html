<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672890337">I highly suspect this is a bug related to the code that prevents bards from<br/>
being affected by any mana regeneration boosters.  Because the bard isn&#39;t<br/>
affected when another bard&#39;s song pulses it doesn&#39;t detect a stacking<br/>
problem because the bard doesn&#39;t have the effect on him.  <br/>
Another interesting stacking issue I discovered.  The yaulp proc&#39;d by the<br/>
screaming mace stacks with Warsong, but not with Anthem, except: If the<br/>
Screaming Mace procs before the anthem you get both effects.  If it procs<br/>
after Anthem is already up you get the your &quot;spell did not take effect&quot;<br/>
message and the Yaulp does not stick.  I thought that was odd as it was the<br/>
only order related stacking I had ever encountered.  <br/>
That led me to question some of the apparent Hymn stacking we considered<br/>
long ago.  If a bard&#39;s song only checks on the opposing bard for stacking<br/>
which seems to be true, could two bards in the same group stand outside each<br/>
other&#39;s area of effect but both having and intermediary person inside both<br/>
their areas of effect.  If they did would the person in both areas be healed<br/>
doubly?  Something to check.  I know for sure that while I cannot play Hymn<br/>
if a higher level bard is, if I walk away from his area of effect I can play<br/>
it even though we are in the same group.  Something for someone with good<br/>
analysis techniques like John (tm) to check.<br/>

Well I have no clue about the enchanter clarity stacking with bard&#39;s but I<br/>
do know bard&#39;s clarity stack with each other. My main char is a necro and I<br/>
was grouped with 3 bards in Sol B doing kobolds andthe impact on my mana<br/>
regen was astonishing. I didn&#39;t even have to meditate and we were pulling<br/>
just about non stop. So yes bards clarity does stack.<br/>
