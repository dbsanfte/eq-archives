<div id="ygrps-yiv-782478309">While I would agree that some items are way too easy to get your hand on<br/>
(black silk gloves, shin items, lambent stones), I&#39;ve found the other items<br/>
very difficult to come by. I pulled GDB&#39;s for 4 days in unrest before my<br/>
wife and each had bracelets (I&#39;m not planning on going back to Feydark any<br/>
time soon).  A friend of mine who is also a bard was there when I arrived<br/>
and was still looking for his long after I left.  My fiery vambraces were<br/>
quick, but it took me 4 hours to get my boots.  Thank god I was with an<br/>
EXTREMELY competent party and we were able to keep the spawns perfectly<br/>
broken up.  Worse yet, it took me 4 straight days in Sol A before I could<br/>
even find a party willing and competent enough to take the king room.  I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine someone lower then 25-27 even having the guts to wander into<br/>
the King room to loot the stuff.  I know my party didn&#39;t want me advertising<br/>
vambraces because of the train one warrior looking to loot a totem brought<br/>
:-).<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t even begun to formulate in my mind how I&#39;m going to get the helm<br/>
or the breast plate.  I can&#39;t imagine any of the drops needed here are going<br/>
to be cake walks and I&#39;ve never soon Froon and Choon camped (although I<br/>
spend little time in North Karana).<br/>
<br/>
So, other then the gauntlets, I&#39;d say that none of these items is easily<br/>
obtainable by bards lower then 25th level without significant help.  IMHO, I<br/>
think the lambent quests are seem to be as difficult as intended, at least<br/>
in part.  Now crafted is a different story (talk about a cake walk so far!).<br/>

&gt; Probably the most depressing thing about the Lambent armor quests (for<br/>
&gt; me) is the fact that all of these things are heavily camped on weekends.<br/>
&gt; Of the eight quest objects and three stones that I got over the last two<br/>
&gt; weekends, I earned exactly two of them in combat.  Everything else I<br/>
&gt; looted when the camping group let me take a turn, or (in the case of the<br/>
&gt; stones) was handed to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The upside to this is that lower level Bards can probably expect to get<br/>
&gt; Lambent Armor much earlier than Verant probably intended.  Because<br/>
&gt; all of the components are no-drop (and hence financially worthless), most<br/>
&gt; groups will let you loot the stuff for nothing.  Just go on the weekend<br/>
&gt; when it&#39;s crowded, and bring a good book.<br/>
