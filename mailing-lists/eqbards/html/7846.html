longer get a faction hit for getting the ring, nor do you get<br/>
a faction increase for recharging it.  So unless you do<br/>
something to lower your faction with GuardiansoftheVale, if<br/>
you should accidently give your ring to Hendri before singing<br/>
your song and she won&#39;t give it back, you can just go back to<br/>
the marshall and get another ring.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how to raise your faction with the clerics at<br/>
Rivervale so you don&#39;t have to use a faction raising<br/>
song/spell every time you want to recharge the ring?<br/>
