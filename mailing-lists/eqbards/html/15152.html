&gt; Hi all!  A bardic friend of mine mentioned to me that<br/>
&gt; there was a discussion going on about EBW vs Ykesha<br/>
&gt; with actual log files involved! :)  I only read over 4<br/>
&gt; or 5 digests here so please forgive me if I bring up<br/>
&gt; something already mentioned.  John is there any way<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d be able to make the log data itself available,<br/>
&gt; posted or emailed to me directly?  Allow me to<br/>
&gt; elaborate on why I&#39;m looking for this information...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh heh.  If you want to save me the work, feel free.  How<br/>
many MB can your mailbox handle?  :)<br/>

&gt; with proc and EBW 7/21 no proc) i&#39;d like to get the<br/>
&gt; most accurate representation of damage over time the<br/>
&gt; weapons deal out.  There appears to be a damage bonus<br/>
&gt; for the primary hand of (level-25)/3, or 8 points at<br/>
&gt; level 50.  This 8 points is applied more often the<br/>
&gt; faster the weapon swings and hence favors the faster<br/>
&gt; weapon given the same dmg/delay ratio.  Looking at<br/>

the two apart.  The numbers I gave are for each weapon in the<br/>
primary hand.  It does (tentatively) fit the pattern you<br/>
describe, with the EBW having a slight advantage.  However,<br/>
the Yak&#39;s proc, even with a &gt;50% resist rate, completely<br/>
swamps out that advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting note is that just using the raw dam/del ratio to<br/>
get hypothetical damage figures for a planes weapon (11/25),<br/>
it&#39;s better than a Yak + proc.  That reminds me, I need to<br/>
compare proc rate in the secondary...<br/>

&gt; data in its raw form to see if I can figure anything<br/>
&gt; out usefull from playing around with it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, the parser I&#39;m using generates a histogram, but it does<br/>
so only graphically - it won&#39;t tell me the exact number of<br/>
times each damage value occurred, which is what I really want.<br/>
