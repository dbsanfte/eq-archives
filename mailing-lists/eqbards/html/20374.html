<br/>
by the way, that post before how i went up 3 AC when i changed from<br/>
lizardscale cloak to cloak of the icebear, i was incorrect.  those are both<br/>
8AC.  befrore i got my HBC, i went from a white wolf-hide cloak to a cloak<br/>
of the icebear (7AC to 8AC) and got the 3AC jump.  just to clarify.<br/>
