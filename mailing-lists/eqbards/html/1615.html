<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101459078"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I have to tell you, this story hits me hard. Somethign very similar<br/>
 </span></blockquote>happened to me. I will tell you what I have learned.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Was getting stuck in the zone barrier a bug or what was supposed to<br/>
happen?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t think it was supposed to happen, though I do know (not from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>experience however) that you can only cross the zone while you are on<br/>
the boat, and only the boat. The rowboats don&#39;t cut it.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Since my corpse is right at the zone border, will I get stuck again<br/>
if I<br/>
try to retrieve it?  Can I use the /corpse command underwater to pull<br/>
my<br/>
corpse away from the zone border?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I died in the middle of the ocean of tears under similar<br/>
 </span></blockquote>circumstances. My video froze up, and when I started back, I was under<br/>
water. My mistake was trying to remomorize the Jig while at the surface<br/>
of the water. Man, that was a big mistake. Anyway, when I found my<br/>
corpse, I was able to /corpse it to the surface and loot from there.<br/>
Took me a few times because I was losing air while looting, but didn&#39;t<br/>
have to come up from the bottom when I stopped. Of course, I happened<br/>
to be in a relatively shallow part of the water.<br/>
<br/>
3)Will the locate corpse zone still point you in the<br/>
right<br/>
direction even if you are not in the same zone as the corpse you are<br/>
looking<br/>
for?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;In my experience, the song keeps playing, but the massage says<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sopmething along the lines of, &quot;you sense no corspes in this zone.&quot; <br/>
Something like that.<br/>
  <br/>
4) What is the most likely explanation for the character walking on the<br/>
bottom of the ocean?  Another player or just another bug?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Can&#39;t answer this. Sorry<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>5)  At the time I drowned, there were no GMs online for me to<br/>
/petition.<br/>
Assuming one is online the next time I play, will they automatically<br/>
retrieve my corpse for me since it is at the bottom of the ocean?  I<br/>
sure<br/>
hope so because I don&#39;t relish the idea of having to go back to<br/>
retrieve it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Good luck. Maybe having the GM follow you to see if there is a bug<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is a good idea. When I drowned, I petitioned as it was the fault of the<br/>
game locking up on me. (I have since theorized that it locked up due to<br/>
my video cards over heating, though that is still a guess). The GM told<br/>
me that he would not help me because the servers never came down. He<br/>
said it would be a grand adventure, and that I should have someone cast<br/>
water breathing on me to help me out. I was pretty mad about that, but<br/>
seeing as how I ended up recovering my corpse, I ended up pretty happy<br/>
about it. I even ended up with a cool story to tell.<br/>
<br/>
That is all,<br/>
