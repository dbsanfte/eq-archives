<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082226138"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I suspect that other Bard songs probably don&#39;t stack, <br/>
&gt;either, like the heal song. Anyone else test this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whenever I grouped with another bard higher than me, his/her<br/>
songs always took over the same ones I was singing.  The stats<br/>
would slightly increase as their song pulsed over mine. I havent<br/>
tested it recently, but Hymm never did stack.  You got two <br/>
messages and two graphicals, but the hp went up as fast as<br/>
one bard singing it.  Now, I&#39;m not sure if one bard starts<br/>
Hymm, and another stronger voice tries to sing Hymm, if the<br/>
client is smart enough to turn off the previous one in favor<br/>
of the new stronger heal.  I imagine it does, since other songs<br/>
behave this way.<br/>

This weekend, two groups of level 40-45 killed the ghoul lord<br/>
a few times and pulled SSotY and SSB.  I played a pretty nice<br/>
role as the only bard in the 12 people there.  Dinged into 39,<br/>
and got my pretty graphical spam particle effects.<br/>
