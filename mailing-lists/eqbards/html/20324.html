<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421076396">One of my friends with bind sight came up with a great way to run if<br/>
there are only two of you.  He leads, I run second, and he binds sight. <br/>
So, he knows exactly how far I am behind him, and exactly how to turn so<br/>
as to not rub me off on a tree or un-friendly piece of landscape.  I<br/>
never get far enough behind him that he cannot see to steer himself, too.<br/>
 We did a *long* run the other day, and even though I was lagging a<br/>
little, we did not het messed up once.  I have a feeling this particular<br/>
method is not for the weakhearted, though...&quot;what cliff?&quot; heh<br/>
