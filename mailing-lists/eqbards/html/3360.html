<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232141229">You forgot the fact that it is mainly inhabited by wood elves...and that<br/>
Kithicor himself is a wood elf (and I couldn&#39;t get him to talk, either).<br/>
And he hangs out at a cabin with no door, and all those burned out<br/>
cottages...something happened in that zone at some point...I just don&#39;t know<br/>
what.  There are also those named Orcs by HH that seem to be brothers, and<br/>
the fact that the Captain can be found on tracking, but not anywhere around<br/>
where he&#39;s supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
And to the guy talking about the spawn rate....there was a place there (I<br/>
don&#39;t do the /loc thing) that my group called the X-Roads.  When your&#39;re<br/>
near the road, you can rest...but go down the road a bit, and there were<br/>
more Giant Scarabs and Spiders than you could hope to kill...I gained a lot<br/>
of levels there...<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, I&#39;m going to have to ask for even more spoiler. :)  I&#39;ve been to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;...<br/>
&gt;&gt;The zone is probably great between levels 8 to about 15 mainly<br/>
&gt;&gt;because it&#39;s empty.<br/>
&gt;...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Okay, this was a great technical description of the Kithicor, although<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there are things about it you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;only discover over time, the spawn is VERY quirky and particular, way more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than described.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;But I and many others are convinced this is not all there is to Kithicor.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is story there, very<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;odd and mysterious story. If you are looking for &quot;Levelquest&quot; this is NOT<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your zone. If you are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;looking to gain an understanding of one of the weirdest zones in the game,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>go spend some time in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kithicor. You can run through it a hundred times and not notice much, you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>can spend a night hunting<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;spawn spots and not notice much, but over time you will begin to notice<br/>
 </span></blockquote>little odd things. Things<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;which in of themselves don&#39;t seem like much, but collectivly are odd enough<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to make you wonder.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;The behaviors of Ged and Luna??? (I forget her exact name BUT we all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>believe it is not accidental<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that she has the moon reference in her name). We are quite sure they are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>involved...and when she is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;parted from him for a while she *runs* back. What is the story behind that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ghouls that stand upright (spotted one night).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One minute Ged is standing there happily, the next moment, a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>werewolf...(seen by a friend)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;One night I saw Luna?? run into a burned out house and a female zombie run<br/>
 </span></blockquote>out.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;And why doesn&#39;t she speak?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There appears to be references to Kithicors past in the History of Norrath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The undead army. It&#39;s not there all the time, but when it IS there, it&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just plain weird.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;*one* goblin? How often do you see a lone goblin? Not named, just a regular<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ol&#39; goblin. Is he lost?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;No music, no footsteps NOTHING. Just plain spooky. After some time there<br/>
 </span></blockquote>walking out into W<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Commonlands feels like stepping into a cheery garden...The whole place,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>from the merchants to the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;other residents to the locked buildings to the bizarre nature of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spawn...The Truth is Out There.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;And you won&#39;t find it while leveling through...<br/>
