<b>Subject:</b> Weapon effects affecting songs revisited <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738162142">I hope also that everyone who has had experienced the weapon effect bug (It<br/>
locks you onto the song you are currently singing and wont let go for a bit)<br/>
has bugged.  If not, please take a bit of time ingame to bug it.  The only<br/>
way that these things will get fixed is if we are squeaky wheels about it.<br/>
