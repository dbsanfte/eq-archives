&gt; &gt;Subject: [eqbards] Rules and FAQ 1.6 - PLEASE READ THIS!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 17 Dec 1999 14:57:37 -0600<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List, a mailing list<br/>
&gt; &gt;dedicated to all for and about the Bard in EverQuest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;This list will be posted semi-regularly, and updated as often as is needed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;If you have any suggestions, or any frequently asked questions, please let<br/>
&gt; &gt;me know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Changes have been made to instruments.  Please help me by reading and<br/>
&gt; &gt;correcting my errors.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;      First, some basic rules:<br/>
&gt; &gt;      (Common sense stuff, really)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible).  While we do often stray off the<br/>
&gt; &gt;path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the material &quot;of-interest&quot; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are acceptable, because Bards<br/>
&gt; &gt;have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are not.  Discussions of<br/>
&gt; &gt;Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt not to spoil<br/>
&gt; &gt;someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put spoiler space<br/>
&gt; &gt;(several blank lines) to let people know in advance.<br/>
&gt; &gt;      Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person doing so will <br/>
&gt; &gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt;immediately reviewed for warning, removal or banning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;      On a related note, if you notice that your topic is straying from the<br/>
&gt; &gt;original thread, please change the subject header.  Example: RE: Mistmoore<br/>
&gt; &gt;Battle Drums becomes: re: Fighting undead as a Bard (was RE: Mistmoore<br/>
&gt; &gt;Battle Drums) For those of you receiving the digest version, if you can<br/>
&gt; &gt;make an attempt to change the subject field to something appropriate, that<br/>
&gt; &gt;would help those of us not digesting our mail better pass it ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please<br/>
&gt; &gt;be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read through, and then<br/>
&gt; &gt;make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt;all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you simply MUST insult,<br/>
&gt; &gt;badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old list-term for a thread that is<br/>
&gt; &gt;being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when a thread has<br/>
&gt; &gt;degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid for this list, or<br/>
&gt; &gt;when the subject matter has become too inflammatory to be discussed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Kabongs generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;5) No Attached Files!  If you wish to share with us your latest picture,<br/>
&gt; &gt;some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply include a link within<br/>
&gt; &gt;your email to an appropriate place online.  If you have no access to such,<br/>
&gt; &gt;email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post it for you, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;follow up to the list with the URL.  Small infractions will probably be<br/>
&gt; &gt;overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our European readers who<br/>
&gt; &gt;have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot; posts to a minimum, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;try not to quote more of the message than necessary (although you should<br/>
&gt; &gt;always make sure that the message you are sending is properly referenced,<br/>
&gt; &gt;so that people reading the messages out of order are not completely<br/>
&gt; &gt;lost.  And try not to abbreviate too much, or use strange &quot;slang&quot; or<br/>
&gt; &gt;incomprehensible euphemisms.  Plain, clear speech is much more effective,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages...  Also, use spoiler headings and/or<br/>
&gt; &gt;spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or weapon details.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Okay, enough rules.  Now for some Frequently Asked Questions!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, &quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;MM&quot;, &quot;GZ&quot; -<br/>
&gt; &gt;What do they all mean?!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the EverQuest Glossary at<br/>
&gt; &gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqglossary.htm</a> (shameless plug).  Briefly,<br/>
&gt; &gt;those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do<br/>
&gt; &gt;damage every few seconds for a while, instead of all at once), &quot;Direct<br/>
&gt; &gt;Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their damage at once),<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon,  &quot;MM&quot; is Mistmoore, a<br/>
&gt; &gt;mid-to-high level zone near Lesser Faydark, and GZ is Geoffrey Zatkin, the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Verant Designer in charge of spell balance (and thus a frequently consulted<br/>
&gt; &gt;individual when it comes to our songs....)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What is &quot;twisting&quot; (or &quot;weaving,&quot; &quot;stacking,&quot; or &quot;harmonizing&quot;), and how<br/>
&gt; &gt;do I do it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: &quot;Twisting&quot; is the most common name (although much deprecated by those in<br/>
&gt; &gt;favour of more &quot;period&quot; terms) for singing multiple songs at once - or at<br/>
&gt; &gt;least making it seem that way.  The short explanation is to stop one song<br/>
&gt; &gt;and immediately start another one, repeat as necessary.  Since most song<br/>
&gt; &gt;effects have a duration of about 6 seconds, you have time to weave as many<br/>
&gt; &gt;as three (and I&#39;ve even heard tell of four!) songs at once before the first<br/>
&gt; &gt;wears off, gaining the effects from all of them at once.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The long explanation, complete with illustrations, can be found here:<br/>

&gt; &gt;     (thanks Tork@Nameless).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level?  What does this song do?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest Bard&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;Guild  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/bards/eqbard.htm)</a> has a list of<br/>
&gt; &gt;spellsongs, however, most people seem to prefer detailed statistics, so let<br/>
&gt; &gt;me refer you to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/index.html">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/index.html</a> (The Bardic Song<br/>
&gt; &gt;Analysis page), compiled by Rokenn Swiftsong.  Also, the Soerbaird is a<br/>
&gt; &gt;wonderful site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com/">http://www.soerbaird.com/</a><br/>
&gt; &gt;(Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What do instruments do?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Some songs have associated instruments.  Playing this instrument will<br/>
&gt; &gt;generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is also related<br/>
&gt; &gt;to  your relative skill with the instrument.  Also, instrument skill is<br/>
&gt; &gt;partially responsible for failure rate of related songs.  To avoid missing<br/>
&gt; &gt;notes, even when singing, keep your instrument skills maxed out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the world.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found in Mistmoore), which increases <br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;effects of most drummed songs by 20%<br/>
&gt; &gt;          The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found in Mistmoore) which <br/>
&gt; &gt;has no<br/>
&gt; &gt;discernible special effect.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          The Gypsy Lute (different from the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, in<br/>
&gt; &gt;that it is for a specific quest), which has no known special abilities.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          Brahm&#39;s Horn (found in the Gorge of King Grobb) which has no <br/>
&gt; &gt;known<br/>
&gt; &gt;discernible effect.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute which adds +9 DEX, +15 CHAR, +9<br/>
&gt; &gt;AGI.  Found on the Maestro of Rancor in the Plane of Hate. (Shada - any<br/>
&gt; &gt;known bonus to songs?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;          Drums of Selo&#39;s March (Found on Cazic Thule?) which increases the<br/>
&gt; &gt;effects of most drummed songs by 30%.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          McVaxius&#39; Horn of War (unknown) which adds +9 INT, +9 DEX, +15 <br/>
&gt; &gt;CHA<br/>
&gt; &gt;and increases Brass song effects by 15%.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          Minotaur Horns found on minotaurs in Steamfont and the Gorge of <br/>
&gt; &gt;King<br/>
&gt; &gt;Grobb are *wind instruments* (not Brass) with no known special<br/>
&gt; &gt;effect.  They are, however, lighter than flutes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          The Lizard Scout Fifes are rumoured to be non-magical wind<br/>
&gt; &gt;instruments, but this still remains to be proven. (Would someone please<br/>
&gt; &gt;test this for me?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;           Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo is a wind instrument.  Not sure if it<br/>
&gt; &gt;has any added effect.  Found on Cazic Thule.<br/>
&gt; &gt;           The Unicorn Horn (found in Lesser Faydark), acts as a Greater<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lightstone while held, as well as a wind instrument. It also has 5 charges<br/>
&gt; &gt;of Purge.  It does not have any discernible effect on songs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          Small Brass Trumpet which acts as brass.  Supposed to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt;greater effect than other brass instruments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;          There are other instruments (notably those on the Plane of Hate)<br/>
&gt; &gt;that have yet to be fully tested.  I&#39;m still waiting on reports for those.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Weight and cost.  Mandolins are lighter, but a little more expensive.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What&#39;s with all these instrument parts I keep seeing? (Unfinished horn,<br/>
&gt; &gt;lute strings, mouthpiece, raw bamboo, etc.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Nobody knows.  Rumour has it, there was to have been another tradeskill:<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Instrument making&quot;, but nothing has ever been confirmed.  In the meantime,<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t accidentally buy an unfinished horn, because believe me, they just<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t play the same.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an instrument while<br/>
&gt; &gt;swinging a sword?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Unfortunately, no.  While instruments are off-hand only items, they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;also considered two-handed.  Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much more fun to bash<br/>
&gt; &gt;monsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; level?  Where should I<br/>
&gt; &gt;hunt at this level?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Okay - time to ask the list ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the screen you have 6 empty<br/>
&gt; &gt;boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it.  This is the &quot;hotkey&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;box.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your keyboard, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;you can reconfigure that through the options settings.  Songs, spells, the<br/>
&gt; &gt;spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made &quot;hotkeys&quot;. To<br/>
&gt; &gt;create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want and HOLD it<br/>
&gt; &gt;down.  After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and attach itself<br/>
&gt; &gt;to your pointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the appropriate hotkey<br/>
&gt; &gt;slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you press the associated<br/>
&gt; &gt;hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or action in that slot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your hotkey bank is<br/>
&gt; &gt;simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap items in combat.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General<br/>
&gt; &gt;inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag slots will NOT) into<br/>
&gt; &gt;your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with an<br/>
&gt; &gt;instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever.  PRACTICE THIS<br/>
&gt; &gt;MANEUVER!!!  You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at least once, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;more likely several times, so practice practice practice!  And if you *do*<br/>
&gt; &gt;accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and<br/>
&gt; &gt;run like crazy.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff class&gt;?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, Master of None.&quot; This<br/>
&gt; &gt;means that, while we can do so many different things (sneak, dual wield,<br/>
&gt; &gt;pick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be masters in any of<br/>
&gt; &gt;them, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 for Forage and 75<br/>
&gt; &gt;for Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be incredibly good at these<br/>
&gt; &gt;skills.  Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q:  Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana regeneration speed<br/>
&gt; &gt;for your party members?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: No.  Here - let me emphasize that: NO!!!!!  What the Jig does is<br/>
&gt; &gt;increase the rate of  Stamina Regeneration every six seconds and hence the<br/>
&gt; &gt;display of the Stamina, Health, and Mana bars to show this<br/>
&gt; &gt;increase.  Without the song playing the bars are refreshed every eight<br/>
&gt; &gt;seconds.  The ultimate effect of this is that the mana bar &quot;moves&quot; every<br/>
&gt; &gt;six seconds instead of every eight seconds so it APPEARS to be moving<br/>
&gt; &gt;FASTER.  In actuality - it is moving 75% of the distance it would move if<br/>
&gt; &gt;it waiting the other two seconds.  So bottom line, it LOOKS like it is<br/>
&gt; &gt;regenerating faster but it does not.  If you don&#39;t otherwise have a need to<br/>
&gt; &gt;regenerate stamina, you are wasting a memorized song slot.  Or you can just<br/>
&gt; &gt;use GZ&#39;s short answer: &quot;Urban Myth - Jig only gives fatigue back.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;(Geoffrey Zatkin, Archmage of Norrath [And Verant Game-designer], November<br/>
&gt; &gt;18, 1999, in a letter to Rokenn Swiftsong)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of <br/>
&gt; &gt;Clarity)?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: &quot;There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an icon<br/>
&gt; &gt;on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15<br/>
&gt; &gt;seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - this<br/>
&gt; &gt;means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep the<br/>
&gt; &gt;song effect going indefinitely.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it<br/>
&gt; &gt;does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your screen.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;(Geoffrey Zatkin, December 2, 1999, in &quot;Arch Mage Answers&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_h_archmage.html</a> )<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q. Why can I never gain any experience in 2-handed slash or 2-handed blunt?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A. Although Bards have these skills, and even though they appear on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;trainer, you can never train 2-handed skills as a Bard.  This is apparently<br/>
&gt; &gt;a piece of virtual duct-tape to allow GMs and Guides to play Bards and<br/>
&gt; &gt;still wield 2-handed equipment (like their special staff).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q. What are the most important stats as a Bard?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A. Well, because no matter what I answer, someone will disagree with me, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;will say this:  No matter what your starting stats, odds are, you will<br/>
&gt; &gt;eventually be able to balance any deficiencies out with magic items and<br/>
&gt; &gt;jewelry.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Q: Why are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 49?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A: &quot;When we was [sic] finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave some<br/>
&gt; &gt;room for expansion during the evolution of EverQuest.  Because Bards get<br/>
&gt; &gt;one song per level, if we had given them all fifty songs there would have<br/>
&gt; &gt;been no room for expansion - aside from taking away older songs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Expect to see new songs coming soon.  These songs will not be anything that<br/>
&gt; &gt;radically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions that help<br/>
&gt; &gt;keep the Bard interesting at high levels.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Okay, well, this FAQ is pretty long as it is - and I&#39;ve run out of<br/>
&gt; &gt;ideas.  If anyone has any suggestions for the next version, please feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;free to send them my way.<br/>
