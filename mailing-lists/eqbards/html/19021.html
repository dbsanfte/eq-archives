<div id="ygrps-yiv-494996146">It wasn&#39;t at all crowded. When we went in there was one lower<br/>
level druid soloing the skeletons (to let you know how blue they were)<br/>
We grouped with him and helped him have less downtime. OTOH,<br/>
there are more Iskar in that level range now. That was within a week/<br/>
week and a half of Kunark coming out. Kurn&#39;s Tower (at least the<br/>
skeleton portion) would, IMHO, be good for a group of around lvl 15.<br/>
If you&#39;re a little higher, go down to the badgers. They are an interesting<br/>
challenge<br/>
and at least have the potential of going higher in level.<br/>
<br/>
WArning: the badgers do have a lifetap that seems impossible to stun.<br/>
You&#39;re going to need a enchanter or someone to remove them from<br/>
battle entirely (other than the one you are fighting)<br/>
<br/>
The druid we grouped with said there IS a named skeleton that spawns in the<br/>
throne<br/>
room Not named in the classical sense. But in that he was a rarer spawn that<br/>
occasionally dropped a nice (tunic? I think) item. There are also some named<br/>
that<br/>
drop quest loot of some sort. (This mostly useful for Iskar though, as the<br/>
quests are mostly Iskar, as I&#39;m finding out in my Warrior) In another<br/>
few levels I&#39;ll be taking Jidranth over to Kurn&#39;s Tower and seeing what he<br/>
thinks of the place  at a more level appropriate time.<br/>

&gt;Excellent info, thanks.  One of our lower levels is a druid so he will<br/>
&gt;probably be interested as he&#39;s wearing leather right now I think.  Most of<br/>
&gt;the people who might be interested aren&#39;t really twinked, but they might<br/>
&gt;have an item or two from higher level guildmembers.  If we do it I&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt;more of a bopdyguard and observer than actually looking for loot myself<br/>
&gt;other than a recipe for that darned cake.  Was it very crowded?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lots of quest loot, lots of bones. Money.<br/>
&gt;We didn&#39;t find anything oh-aw spiffy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OTOH, all three of those of us in there were item-twinked.<br/>
&gt;There was one magical item (BUrnyai Hide Sleeves) we got<br/>
&gt;off a greenie skeleton. Our monk could wear it, but<br/>
&gt;decided not to. i believe Druids could wear it too, so<br/>
&gt;bards probably could.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Anyone know if there is any interesting loot in Kurn&#39;s tower?  I was<br/>
&gt;&gt;thinking it might be a good place to look for Burynai Bundt Cake.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also some<br/>
&gt;&gt;of my guilds lower level member were thinking of trying it.<br/>
