<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653034440">I see them sell pretty often on my server (Bertox) for exactly 500pp. There<br/>
is a high level guild there who camped the Avatar for awhile to get everyone<br/>
in their guild a claw. Then, they started camping it to get everyone in<br/>
their guild a Rubicite Breastplate, which also comes from the Avatar. Well,<br/>
the Claw is a lot more common on the Avatar than the Rubi is, so they have<br/>
gotten a surplus of claws.  I was their second customer almost 2 weeks ago,<br/>
and the &quot;I have a neato unique weapon&quot; feeling has worn off as I now see<br/>
quite a few people around mid 20th level running around with one. Asking<br/>
them, they, too, paid 500pp for one.<br/>
<br/>
I bought mine for 500pp. I had almost 2000 pp in the bank, and from what I<br/>
can tell, money is practically USELESS in this game. There&#39;s nothing I can<br/>
BUY that is better than what I have. I am a foraging god, so food and water<br/>
I never have to buy. The only expenditure I have is for my new song every<br/>
level, and I can find loot for that enough within 30 mins of when I log on.<br/>
So, some people have said, &quot;Tallonn, you paid 500pp for that claw??? But it<br/>
aint that GOOD!!&quot; to which I reply &quot;My friend, just what the heck else am I<br/>
gonna spend all my money on?&quot; I give tons of money away to lower level<br/>
players (all my silver and copper goes to young ones). So the only thing I<br/>
have to do with my money is buy an ocassional item from someone, like the<br/>
claw. I am not powerful enough to get one myself. I also have bought<br/>
Rubicite armor for ridiculous amounts. Why? Well, the camping is becoming<br/>
attrocious. This is probably my biggest pet-peeve about the game, the huge<br/>
abundance of camping. You get 18 people all stuffed in the throneroom in<br/>
Cazic Thule, and you&#39;ll see &quot;fun&quot; at its best. People are grouchy, people<br/>
are greedy, people cry when they think you grabbed a lone sentinel you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have, and then you have groups that come there with the sole<br/>
intent of kill-stealing.  So, don&#39;t camp, go somewhere else. And just like<br/>
someone else here mentioned, those areas are quickly becoming overpopulated,<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
But, I digress. I am good at that.<br/>
<br/>
So, is the claw WORTH it to YOU? That is for YOU to decide. I think it is<br/>
worth 500pp. In my opinion, it&#39;s better than a Tommy, better than a Whip,<br/>
and neck and neck with a Dirk. I know that since I have started<br/>
dual-wielding a claw and a dirk, my stamina has NEVER, EVER dropped below 4<br/>
bubbles, while with the Tommy, I was always at half stamina within a few<br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
And, lastly, the claw just looks so dang cool. Vain, I know, but to me,<br/>
looks are important. (Smile)<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 copper&#39;s worth<br/>
