<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283000351">I&#39;m not a very good equipment person. However, I do know that the Runed <br/>
Bone Fork is a very nice &quot;range&quot; slot item (+10 magic, cold, fire). And <br/>
since you&#39;re going to be in Guk area anyway, read up about camping the <br/>
froglok squire in Upper Guk.<br/>

&gt;Neck: Collar of Undead Protection (ac5, disease/poison +7) 20p  (if you go<br/>
&gt;to someone camping the squire in guk, he will porbably give it to you for<br/>
&gt;free)<br/>
&gt;Face:  Buy 3 potions of invis to undead and head to Lower Guk.  Find out who<br/>
&gt;is camping the Ass/Sup, and ask them if you can loot the Guise.  (It is a no<br/>
&gt;drop rogue/bard only item, often rots).  If they say yes, get an invis (use<br/>
&gt;a potion if you can&#39;t get one at the zone) and walk over there. (its close<br/>
&gt;to the zone, if you cant get a good map I could give you directions). Hang<br/>
&gt;out in the corner, out of their way.  If the assasin pop, let them loot it<br/>
&gt;and tell you if it has a guise.  (Ac4, magic resist and a LOT of cha, casts<br/>

&gt;Another peice to look for is a Tattered Mantle.  You can buy it for 300p,<br/>
&gt;its ac12 and some other stuff.  Very good shoulder peice for a very<br/>
&gt;attainable amount of plat.<br/>
