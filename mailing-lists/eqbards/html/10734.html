<div id="ygrps-yiv-148423440"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This would be true if they gated out of the zone, but noooooo, these beight<br/>
&gt; ones gated to the zone entry.  Naturally the gobs all headed that way<br/>
&gt; immediately.  Also since SoW can last for 25+ minutes its pretty easy for<br/>
&gt; SoW casters to still have speed underground and cause huge trains so that<br/>
&gt; only the bards get their speed taken away.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I can forsee in the future, no more binding inside dungeons.<br/>
  There is no real need for it.  And it&#39;s only used to exploit <br/>
  the game:<br/>
<br/>
  1) Find the mob you want, tag it, gate to zoneline, and fight<br/>
     it there in a safer environment.<br/>
 <br/>
  2) Raid of Vox/Nagafen.  Need I say more?  hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
  3) Shortcuts back into deep dungeon areas to kill X mob<br/>
     instead of running through a fully spawned dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
  Those are the things I&#39;ve seen, I bet there are 3 more<br/>
  uses for the binding in dungeons which exploit one thing<br/>
  or another.  There is really no good reason to bind in <br/>
  a dungeon to defend doing it.  I mean they can bind right<br/>
  outside the entrance, which is something non-casters wont<br/>
  be able to do anyway.  No binding in dungeons would elimate<br/>
  the ability for casters to psuedo-train in the same fashion<br/>
  as Verant has deemed SoW/Selos users.<br/>
