&gt;Despite what people seem to think at times, Verant has three years of 25 or <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;people having worked on this game.  Somewhere there is a Master Design<br/>
&gt;Document that is probably around 1,000 pages long.  If you believe that<br/>
&gt;decisions like player binding weren&#39;t discussed for litterally hundreds of<br/>
&gt;man-hours you&#39;re sorely mistaken and have no idea how much effort and time <br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;gone into this game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have read in several interviews that this is very true.  As a matter of <br/>
fact in the early phases of beta binding was a lot tougher (required a very <br/>
expensive component that was consumed).<br/>
