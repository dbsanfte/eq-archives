&gt; people he hunt giants with used this tactic to. (since we play <br/>
&gt; on the same server). Our enchanters charm 1 giant each and let <br/>
&gt; them along with everyone else kill the 3:rd giant. Then we let <br/>
&gt; one go and kill him and keep the other one charmed.<br/>
&gt; Then finally we take the last one.<br/>

  poor newbies or roaming the countryside.  Lately, I&#39;ve been in <br/>
  the Planes every day and when I don&#39;t do that I&#39;m playing my<br/>
  druid.  The last time someone charmed a fire giant, all hell broke<br/>
  loose. <br/>
