My big question now is what songs to use when.  I discovered at 11 I could<br/>
solo better twisting only hymn & warsong w/o instruments as opposed to<br/>
hymn/warsong/CoD w/o instruments (weapons beat instruments hands down at<br/>
11).  This is probably due to dropping songs while twisting 3 in less than<br/>
perfect conditions.  Knowing this I&#39;ve got to really focus on the two most<br/>
effective songs and what to throw in as a third if possible.<br/>
<br/>
My big plan for 12 while soloing is still hymn & warsong.  I&#39;m guessing<br/>
Bellow beats CoD (especially with weapons) so I&#39;ll through that in as a<br/>
third song.  Or should I focus more on offense and sing warsong & bellow and<br/>
occasionally hymn?<br/>
<br/>
Grouping really depends on the group & whether we&#39;re likely to be fighting<br/>
singles or multiples.  But here&#39;s what I did at 11.  Any suggestions for 12?<br/>
<br/>
Hymn - during battle if no healer, between battles irregardless<br/>
CoB - if caster heavy group and I&#39;m not tanking<br/>
warsong - if caster heavy group and I am tanking<br/>
anthem - melee heavy group<br/>
CoD - in battle & with hymn if additional mobs show up and start picking on<br/>
a caster, or when pulling to get a mobs attention faster, or in battle if<br/>
I&#39;ve switched to my lute to heal someone<br/>
Jig - between battles when you get a caster that swears it&#39;s affecting mana<br/>
and you&#39;re too tired to argue.  Usually I&#39;ve got Lament in that spot anyway.<br/>
I rarely use either.<br/>
E Rhythms - in place of CoB in caster heavy groups where I&#39;m not tanking, in<br/>
place of hymn otherwise.  CoB/Hymn would still be that third song I&#39;d try to<br/>
fit in if possible.<br/>
<br/>
So now where should Bellow be used?  And do you see anything drastically<br/>
wrong with what I&#39;ve been doing?<br/>
<br/>
