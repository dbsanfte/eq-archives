L15 then, and thinking back on it, we must&#39;ve let an orc run<br/>
away.  It was still aggroed to us, but outside the range where<br/>
it would come chase us.  It aggroed other orcs, who do what<br/>
they normally do (pace back and forth).  As they got near the<br/>
top of the far hill, they&#39;d enter the chase-aggro range and<br/>
come running to us.  We couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on<br/>
because all these orcs kept running over the far hill for us<br/>
nonstop.<br/>
<br/>
If this was happening at the orc lift, it&#39;s likely you never<br/>
saw the orcs running towards you because of the Z-axis<br/>
limitation (you&#39;ll notice players/mobs at a different height<br/>
disappear from view a lot sooner than when you&#39;re just far<br/>
away).  When they attacked, it forced a client update, and<br/>
they appeared to pop on top of you.  And like Rokenn said,<br/>
because one had transferred its aggro to all the other orcs,<br/>
you got faction hits for all of them.<br/>
