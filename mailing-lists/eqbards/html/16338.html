&gt;On the topic of playing nice,,, last night my almost<br/>
&gt;17lvl enchanter was trying to kill gnolls in highpass<br/>
&gt;with a 19 druid for a partner.  We were doing fine,<br/>
&gt;till this Lvl 50 Necro arrived and said... &quot;sorry to<br/>
&gt;do this to you guys, but i need the faction&quot; he then<br/>
&gt;proceeded to kill everything in site till i gave up<br/>
&gt;and left 30 minutes later.   That is in reallity how<br/>
&gt;sharing works...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In future, ask the Necromancer to share by throwing a low-level dot on each <br/>
gnoll.  That way he&#39;ll get faction, your downtime goes down, and everyone&#39;s <br/>
happy.  That&#39;s what I did with Minos in Steamfont - just one whack gives <br/>
you faction ;)<br/>
