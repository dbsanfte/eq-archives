&gt; Do you remember a recent patch that changed Treeform so druids<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t move while as a tree?  Well hold onto your drums but Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; breaks the tree&#39;s roots, and the lovely druids can start being<br/>

&gt; Not sure if people have mentioned this already, but it sure caused a<br/>
&gt; stir in East Commons when me and my sis were roaming around and I had<br/>
&gt; this big tree chasing after me!!<br/>

&gt; Anyone taking odds that this will get changed in a patch coming soon<br/>

alternate form, lots of things that would normally attack you<br/>
won&#39;t.  I ran into this bug with my enchanter - accidently<br/>
found a way to move with minor illusion up despite the latest<br/>
fixes.  I was running around as a bed and *only* the things I<br/>
attacked would attack me back.  It was like having a permanent<br/>
form of invisibility that never went down.  Even griffins and<br/>
hill giants left me alone.<br/>

Yes, it&#39;s been /bugged.<br/>
