&gt; Heh, everytime I have used Psalm I have been in a group with higher level<br/>

everyone it didn&#39;t stack with other damage shields, because<br/>
when I sang Warmth and a druid/ranger was hit, I&#39;d only see<br/>
the &quot;pierced by thorns&quot; message.  Then one of them slapped a<br/>
damage shield on me and the light dawned - I saw I was only<br/>
getting one message, but the damage was for both shields<br/>
combined.  Doh.  :-)<br/>
