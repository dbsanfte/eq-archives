&gt; Heh, everytime I have used Psalm I have been in a group with higher level<br/>
&gt; characters (who are dealing out more damage).  Guess that explains why I<br/>
&gt; never got the message.  Man do I feel stupid:-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh.  Don&#39;t feel too bad.  For the longest time I was telling<br/>
everyone it didn&#39;t stack with other damage shields, because<br/>
when I sang Warmth and a druid/ranger was hit, I&#39;d only see<br/>
the &quot;pierced by thorns&quot; message.  Then one of them slapped a<br/>
damage shield on me and the light dawned - I saw I was only<br/>
getting one message, but the damage was for both shields<br/>
combined.  Doh.  :-)<br/>
