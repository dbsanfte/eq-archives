<div id="ygrps-yiv-433875057">:Bind Affinity is for pure spellcasters, not hybrids or jack-of-all-trades.<br/>
:My Cleric has traveled much more than my Bard, and this was before the<br/>
Cleric had Bind Affinity.<br/>
<br/>
Correct me if I&#39;m wrong (not meant to be sarcastic), but Clerics are<br/>
actually not pure spellcasters.  Wizards, Enchanters, Magicians, and Druids<br/>
are the only pure spellcasters (Druids technically being a hybrid, but only<br/>
of pure spellcasters, thus making them one).  Clerics are a hybrid of<br/>
warrior and spellcaster (healing spells).  This is proven by the fact that<br/>
they can use heavy metal armor and strong blunt weapons, and can usually<br/>
hold their own in battle, yet being a very effective magic class at the same<br/>
time with healing spells.  So, if they are a hybrid and get Bind Affinity...<br/>

: There are no plans to allow bards to bind themselves.  Bind Affinity is<br/>
for<br/>
: pure spellcasters, not hybrids or jack-of-all-trades.  While Bards can<br/>
: travel a lot, we are the class that least needs Bind Affinity.  With Selo,<br/>
: we can travel much faster than any other class (besides the high level<br/>
gate<br/>
: spells).  And I don&#39;t understand where you think we are &quot;supposed to be<br/>
the<br/>
: most traveling class in Norrath&quot;.  My Cleric has traveled much more than<br/>
my<br/>
: Bard, and this was before the Cleric had Bind Affinity.<br/>
:<br/>
: Selo&#39;s does disrupt SoW.  This is most likely a bug.  Selos also disrupts<br/>
: Root.  This is most likely the same bug.  Fixing one bug will fix the<br/>
other<br/>
: bug.  I think most Bards would prefer to have this &quot;bug&quot; in the game.<br/>
: Verant seems to be willing to leave it in for &quot;gameplay&quot;.<br/>

: &gt; First off, yeah my character&#39;s name is Barrd (Supposed to be &quot;Bard&quot;, but<br/>
: &gt; that damned name filter...), which is a character I&#39;ve RP&#39;d since the<br/>
good<br/>
: &gt; old days of NWN.   So no need to &quot;Hey, great name ;ppp&quot; me, I&#39;ve already<br/>
: &gt; heard it all =oP<br/>
: &gt; Question, does anyone know if there is any plan in the future for bards<br/>
to<br/>
: &gt; be able to bind themselves?  Just kinda seems silly that we&#39;re supposed<br/>
to<br/>
: &gt; be the most traveling class in Norrath, but can&#39;t bind. =o/  Also, any<br/>
: word<br/>
: &gt; on why Selo&#39;s disrupts other group member&#39;s SoW?<br/>
