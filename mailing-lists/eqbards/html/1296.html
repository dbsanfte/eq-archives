do beneficial stuff (heal ourselves, buff the party,<br/>
whatever), the mob adds that to its hatred.  Several people<br/>
have noted that it also happened to them while not playing a<br/>
song.  In those cases, I&#39;d guess that it&#39;s a &quot;which target is<br/>
easiest&quot; thing.<br/>

I think I&#39;ve come up with a way to abuse this though and am<br/>
going to report it as a bug tomorrow.  Get a friend who is<br/>
like 10+ levels below you and wants his character twinked.  <br/>
Now find a mob that is red to him but green to you.  Play your<br/>
lullaby.  Keep the mob sleeping for a couple minutes.  Have<br/>
your friend attack the mob.  The mob will hate you so much for<br/>
putting it to sleep that it will keep attacking you.  Since<br/>
it&#39;s green to you, you don&#39;t get hurt that much.  OTOH your<br/>
friend gets free attacks on the mob, and gets all the<br/>
experience when he kills it.  I tested this with a couple of<br/>
undead pawns while waiting for the boat, and it works.  I took<br/>
all the damage (which with a 360+ AC was close to nothing),<br/>
the L7-8 guys got all the experience.<br/>

some point (which because of the above problem happens a lot).<br/>
It used to be you only got the faction changes if you got the<br/>
experience.  But people were abusing that to kill things they<br/>
shouldn&#39;t without getting the faction hit.  So they changed it<br/>
so you&#39;re supposed to get a faction change if anything you&#39;ve<br/>
fought dies.  I think they goofed and whether or not you get<br/>
the faction change depends on if the mob has you on its hatred<br/>
list (i.e. you&#39;ve attacked it or it&#39;s attacked you).<br/>
