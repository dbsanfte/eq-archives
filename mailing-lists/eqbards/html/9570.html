<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002051188">Personally, I love having a reason to go back to a zone that I thought I<br/>
knew with my eyes closed only to discover it has changed dramatically.  It<br/>
adds an excitement back to the game that I haven&#39;t experienced since I tried<br/>
to take my level 5 wizard from Qeynos to Freeport in the first couple of<br/>
weeks in the life of Prexus.<br/>

&gt; I think this post is dead on. I gave up my lvl 33 Magician to<br/>
&gt; play my lvl 20<br/>
&gt; Bard again for one reason. Bards are safe. Outdoors there is<br/>
&gt; almost nothing<br/>
&gt; that can touch me. The world is open and free for discovery.<br/>
&gt; There is a lot<br/>
&gt; to be said for being the fastest thing in Norrath, and good plate armor =)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are a lot of points to this discussion.  Many people want<br/>
&gt; a dynamic<br/>
&gt; &gt; game with more &#39;real&#39; feel to it.  The undead invasion definitely<br/>
&gt; accomplish<br/>
&gt; &gt; both those goals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d even like to see a war over the commonlands where dark elf and<br/>
&gt; freeport<br/>
&gt; &gt; soldiers of various levels started spawning and fighting both each other<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the players in the area.  Very realistic, a pain if you want to travel<br/>
&gt; &gt; freely but so what that&#39;s the way it would be if this were real.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Q Hills may be a newbie zone but Kithicor really isn&#39;t.  Most of the<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; who hunt in Kithicor (never more than 12 at a time on E&#39;ci before now)<br/>
&gt; hunt<br/>
&gt; &gt; the orcs along the west wall and are levels 15-20.  The ranger<br/>
&gt; guild there<br/>
&gt; &gt; is new and besieged already according to the storyline so even that part<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes sense.  All the ghoul messenger stuff was a foreshadowing of this<br/>
&gt; &gt; eventuality so it should not have been much of a surprise that something<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to happen in Kithicor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why of all people would bards complain about this?  I can tell from<br/>
&gt; comments<br/>
&gt; &gt; on this list that I may not be a master tactician or combat fighter, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; apparently I am a master traveler.  I found Kithicor exciting<br/>
&gt; in the heart<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the event with red undead all around.  I did corpse recoveries for<br/>
&gt; plays<br/>
&gt; &gt; twice my level who were going to wait for daylight until I<br/>
&gt; showed them how<br/>
&gt; &gt; easily I could run thru and avoid getting hurt.  I even helped out in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; meager way with a few battles and healing people up in between battles.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It would take extremely bad luck or carelessness for a bard over 15th<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; &gt; to die in Kithicor even with the undead out and about.  I ran thru about<br/>
&gt; 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; times dodging undead and never took more than a bubble of damage at a<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, I had to keep my eyes open and be really careful, but<br/>
&gt; tension is fun!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Once a zombie commander spawned right beside me, I just hit the Incoming<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rivervale button and kept on motoring along.  The reception committee at<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rivervale made short work of the commander.  If they couldn&#39;t have they<br/>
&gt; &gt; would have zoned and so would I, no big deal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think events like this are good for the game.  They create an<br/>
&gt; atmosphere<br/>
&gt; &gt; of excitement and menace.  They make the game feel real.  Most<br/>
&gt; importantly<br/>
&gt; &gt; of all they give Bards a chance to shine as we can usually deal with<br/>
&gt; events<br/>
&gt; &gt; like this long before other classes can and provide actual meaningful<br/>
&gt; &gt; support to people far beyond our experience.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pick up your tents, put out your campfires, and go out there and<br/>
&gt; experience<br/>
&gt; &gt; the world!  It&#39;s an exciting dangerous place, full of adventure.<br/>
