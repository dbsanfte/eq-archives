<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551127072">What? Bards On Strike!<br/>
<br/>
Where? In Kelethin on each and every server. A new server each week, in alphabetical order. (Being Week 1, this one will be held on Bertoxxulous)<br/>
<br/>
When? Saturday the 30th at 9PM CST. <br/>
<br/>
Why? To hopefully open a dialogue with VI over our class concerns, and to educatefellow players on the many discrepencies within our class (some even from Beta)<br/>
<br/>
Summary: Starting at 9PM (CST) on Saturday, September 30th, in Kelethin, on Bertoxxulous server, the EQ Bardic community will begin a server-to-server campaign in the hopes of opening an on-going dialogue with VI over many bard issues. Each week thereafter we will meet in the same place on a different server (going down the list alphabetically) until we feel this issue has been resolved.<br/>
<br/>
We are inviting not only Brad, GZ, Gordon, etc to join us, but any players as well who either support us, or wish to know more about why we feel we have been pushed into this action.<br/>
