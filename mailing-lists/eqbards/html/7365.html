<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131115003">If you&#39;re too &quot;young&quot; to recall.  In beta, all speed enhancing effects were<br/>
disabled in &quot;underground&quot; zones in order to combat massive train problems.<br/>
And to a large extent they did...if you think the trians you see now are<br/>
large now (Mistmore, and other &quot;aggro through walls&quot; zones being the<br/>
exception).  Of course, a lot of this is worked around by simply casing SoW<br/>
before entering the zone.  Which I think is a cheat and a bug, and should<br/>
be removed, or everyone (read bards) should be able to cast speed<br/>
enhancements underground.  But again, this is an example of where bards<br/>
have been screwed.  :)  <br/>

&gt;I would like to see Selo Changed from Being outdoor only.  I can think of<br/>
&gt;ZERO reason why I cant sing Selo in an &quot;inside&quot; zone.  Every reason I have<br/>
&gt;heard &quot;your voice echoes&quot; etc. is just plain foolish.  For cry eye we can<br/>
&gt;play a flute underwater!  Of all the classes that get a speed increasing<br/>
&gt;song, We Bards are the only ones who should get an indoor zone speed song.<br/>
&gt;We sing from memory, devoid of a &quot;GOD&#39;s&quot; speed blessing.  I just dont<br/>
&gt;understand it.<br/>

&gt;Okay, I haven&#39;t been at the office for a few days (which is where I do all<br/>
&gt;of my emailing), but I&#39;m back now and have a revised version of the letter<br/>
&gt;than I&#39;ll be sending to GZ.  The point on Selo&#39;s and SoW cancelling it has<br/>
&gt;been removed, as a fix for this has been put in with the last patch.<br/>
&gt;I almost took out the point about our skills capping too low, as a few<br/>
&gt;people felt that 40 foraging is adequate, but more people seemed to agree<br/>
&gt;that this skill caps too low to be useful, so I&#39;m leaving it.  I&#39;ve added a<br/>
&gt;point regarding the lack of instrument information when right clicking on a<br/>
&gt;song in our spellbooks (as suggested by John).<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m starting to lose my steam on this now, so if there are no further<br/>
&gt;comments/corrections/suggestions/ additions, this will be the version that I<br/>
&gt;send in.<br/>

&gt;--------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Several of our songs (levels 39, 45, 47, 49) don&#39;t seem to be in the<br/>
&gt;game.  We would like to know when we can expect these to be implemented.  If<br/>
&gt;they are indeed in the game already (perhaps discovered via quests) please<br/>
&gt;at least let us know that they exist.  We don&#39;t need to know how/where to<br/>
&gt;get them, or even what they are, but we don&#39;t want to waste our time<br/>
&gt;questing for something that isn&#39;t there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) The level 22 song Alenias Disenchanting Melody currently seems to have no<br/>
&gt;effect whatsoever.  This has been tested repeatedly by many, many bards.  It<br/>
&gt;does not dispel effects on group members (as we thought it should) nor does<br/>
&gt;it protect in any way from harmful effects.  Can you please confirm whether<br/>
&gt;this song is broken or not?  When can we expect a fix?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) You&#39;ve mentioned in the past that the messed up drum graphic (it now<br/>
&gt;looks like we strum a small twig) will be corrected in an upcoming graphics<br/>
&gt;patch.  We realize a graphics patch is large, and hence cannot be done<br/>
&gt;regularily, but could we please get an estimate on roughly when we can<br/>
&gt;expect this glitch to be fixed?  In addition, a recent patch made an<br/>
&gt;equipped mino horn look like we have a small burlap sack embedded in our<br/>
&gt;wrists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4) There seems to be an absense of any high level bard quests.  Is there any<br/>
&gt;implementation planned for these?  When might we expect them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5) Spellcasters, when they right click on a spell can see what skill the<br/>
&gt;spell uses, along with its casting time.  Why doesn&#39;t the bard spell book<br/>
&gt;show what instrument skill is required when you right click on a song?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6) Some of our skills (Hiding, Forage) cap at such low levels, that they<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t worth using.  We don&#39;t need to be master of these, but if the caps<br/>
&gt;were raised such that at least they worked more than<br/>
&gt;1 out of 20 times, we might consider putting them back into our hot keys.<br/>
