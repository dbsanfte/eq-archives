<b>Subject:</b> Carillion song (was  Bard only equipment, a rant) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137943194">I have never used the carrilion anywhere I would be KOS.  Its been so long<br/>
since we discussed this song on the list, I&#39;ve forgotten how it works.<br/>
IIRC, it only works on one target and wears off very quickly.  That works OK<br/>
if there is only one mob around but what if there are multiple mobs that are<br/>
KOS to you?  It would be nice if the carillion was AE and kept working as<br/>
long as you kept playing it.  That might allow us to complete the Stein of<br/>
Moggok quest (old Glowing Stein quest) as well as other quests in evil<br/>
cities.  I would like to go explore the evil cities but haven&#39;t done so yet<br/>
because I didn&#39;t want to risk my invis song blinking out at the wrong time.<br/>

&gt; One bonus a magical flute could give is to make the invis song work<br/>
&gt; against<br/>
&gt; all mobs at all times, no matter if they can inherently see invis or not.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A wind instrument, IMO, would be useless. How would it<br/>
&gt; &gt; benefit us to be more invisible, or more levitated? :)<br/>
