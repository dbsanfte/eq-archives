<div id="ygrps-yiv-972870117">Hmm, I&#39;m just the opposite, only a few quest peices<br/>
(did get my bracers though) and every one I know is<br/>
holding a lambent stone for me.  I must have found 10<br/>
of them over the weekend.  On hill giants in rathe mnt<br/>
and NK, and also griffon&#39;s in NK.  To bad your not on<br/>
E Marr, I&#39;ve given sevral away.<br/>

&gt; components.  I have been<br/>
&gt; auctioning to buy a lambent stone ever since the<br/>
&gt; patch came out.  I have<br/>
&gt; tried this in every zone I pass through.  Not once<br/>
&gt; has anyone had one to<br/>
&gt; sell.  I&#39;ve asked my guild to be on the lookout for<br/>
&gt; them.  Despite killing<br/>
&gt; numerous giants, no one in my guild has looted one. <br/>
&gt; Do lambent stones only<br/>
&gt; get dropped in specific zones or can they get<br/>
&gt; dropped in any zone with a<br/>
&gt; giant or griffin?  How often do they get dropped?   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, can non-bards complete the bard armor quests<br/>
&gt; in order to sell the<br/>
&gt; lambent armor pieces?  If the armor is NO DROP, I<br/>
&gt; guess its possible that<br/>
&gt; people are hanging on to lambent stones so they can<br/>
&gt; complete the quests.  I<br/>
&gt; know most of the quest components are NO DROP but I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t remember if the<br/>
&gt; lambent armor is NO DROP so can someone confirm this<br/>
&gt; for me?<br/>
