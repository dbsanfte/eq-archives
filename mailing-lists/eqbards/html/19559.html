<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497224903">Well thats lovely...  I hope having ultra negative faction won&#39;t hurt me...<br/>
<br/>
I have learned to ignore faction messages in kunark as I get them<br/>
constantly.  (But its not a bug according to the Veeshan Guides).<br/>
<br/>
In any case its still pretty darn annoying as I usually pull (most people<br/>
don&#39;t pull fast enough for my taste).  Especially against things that run<br/>
fast, like the giants...</div>
