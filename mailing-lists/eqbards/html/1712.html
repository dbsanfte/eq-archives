&gt;you want to retain the ability to wear plate, but I fail to see a valid<br/>
&gt;argument from a roleplaying point of view for the allowance of plate on<br/>
&gt;bards.  This is not to say that I&#39;ll not wear plate, because I&#39;m not THAT<br/>
&gt;commited to convictions.  -=)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;ll repeat -my- argument again.  Bards are a fighter hybrid, yet lack<br/>
the patience for any great training in martial combat.  Bards are obsessed<br/>
with their good looks and charm.  Plate looks good.  Bards want to look<br/>
good.  Bards wear plate.<br/>
<br/>
Give me some evidence of bards not wearing plate?  Where does this<br/>
misconception come from?<br/>
<br/>
And the celtic bards were songmasters and historians, rumored to possess<br/>
powerful magic.  Bards from one clan often travelled to other clans, trading<br/>
songs with their brethen.  They also, unlike other druids (for bards were<br/>
druids), spent time training as warriors, yet in ritualized war often were<br/>
not attacked because they were there to watch and later sing the glories of<br/>
whoever won.  When celts fought non-celts, however, the bard was there with<br/>
sword, armor and chariet like the warriors (in fact, their equipment was<br/>
superior to the common warrior and rivaled that of the clan chief!), for<br/>
bards were the druids of war, and extremely important individuals.<br/>
