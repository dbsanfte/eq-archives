up postpatch Wednesday afternoon.  The leader of the group, a 46 woodelf<br/>
ranger, impressed me with his organizational skills.  He had us (well, the<br/>
others who were more or less soloers acting together) working together<br/>
with some decent tactics going on.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, once the guise showed up, he got extremely pissed and left<br/>
midfight.  I was rather confused as to why my song graphics weren&#39;t<br/>
showing up till I realized what had happened.<br/>
<br/>
Then a barbarian warrior shows up, doesn&#39;t tell us he&#39;s new to the area,<br/>
and falls off the walkway.  I sat up there watching him die, eventually<br/>
someone went down and had a spell cast on them (by one of the NPCs).  I<br/>
tell the wizard Get ready to evac, and about 30 seconds after the<br/>
warrior&#39;s death, the room is mobbed by about 5 frogloks (more on the way,<br/>
I&#39;m sure), along with a handful of greater darkbone skeletons.<br/>
