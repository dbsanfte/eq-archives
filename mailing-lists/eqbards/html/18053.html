<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140672218"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;2, 4, 6, 8 for movement.<br/>
&gt;3, 9 for pitching up and down.<br/>
&gt;1, 7 for zooming camera.<br/>
&gt;5 to center pitch.<br/>
&gt;0 for auto attack.<br/>
&gt;numlock for auto run.<br/>
&gt;(given the information on the use center screen key, I&#39;ll probably make the<br/>
&gt;+ on the numberpad do that.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use setup Draelon is using, pretty much (including remapping Use CntrScrn<br/>
to &#39;+&#39;).  I also have Target Nearest PC set to &#39;*&#39; and Target Nearest NPC to<br/>
&#39;0&#39;, so I can do almost all navigation and manipulation with one hand.  The<br/>
only times I use the mouse are when traveling through hilly terrain<br/>
(MouseLook makes it much easier to see the leader going up and down dunes),<br/>
targetting when there are too many mobs (usually I&#39;ll just move around and<br/>
hit &#39;0&#39;, though, if possible) or the mob is so far into the wall that Target<br/>
Nearest won&#39;t work, or when manipulating inventory.<br/>
