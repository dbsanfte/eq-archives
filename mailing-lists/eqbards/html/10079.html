<div id="ygrps-yiv-604301524">Its actually pretty funny you bring this up (the guitar part).<br/>
<br/>
I have a few &#39;tricks&#39; I get my bard to do to entertain parties (my job<br/>
too, since I don&#39;t stare at a silly book 90% of the game). *cackles at the<br/>
finger wigglers*<br/>
<br/>
(People whining about taking so long to mem a song... give it a rest. We<br/>
NEVER have to stare at that song EXCEPT to swap them out. No Mana = No<br/>
downtime)<br/>
<br/>
Oftentimes while singing the heal song, I get reqeusts for &#39;Smoke on the<br/>
Water&#39;, or Ozzy Osbourne or some such thing. Here is a cute visual to do<br/>
for these folks. <br/>
<br/>
When you play your lute, you can swap out your current 2nd hand item, and<br/>
if you are in the middle of the animation for the lute, that item while<br/>
REPLACE the lute in the animation. <br/>
<br/>
I like to swap out my silvery war axe for the lute, this giving the<br/>
&#39;Playing My Axe&#39; impression for the metal heads in my group.<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Maybe next time I&#39;ll teach you all how to do elven bowling! (I love stupid<br/>
EQ tricks), or for a more &#39;useful&#39; trick. teach you how to make SoS<br/>
(Spirit of Snake) potions... =)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

&gt; Bards and friends,<br/>
&gt;    IMHO i love that &quot;surfing&quot; look as we speed across the lands. It does in <br/>
&gt; fact set us apart from any other class, along with the fact that no other <br/>
&gt; can sing. =P<br/>
&gt;    If Verant changes our animation, I&#39;ll absolutely die! hehe Only becuase <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a gnarly dude, I don&#39;t know about anyone else LOL!<br/>
&gt;    And yes, I&#39;m still awaiting the strumming the drum effect to be debugged, <br/>
&gt; although we look like we&#39;re playing air guitar. So it&#39;s all good i suppose.<br/>
