 </span></blockquote>Yow, that&#39;s a bummer.  I usually just bolt thru there and don&#39;t stop for<br/>
anything.  I did get charmed by an evil eye once though and killed an entire<br/>
party of wounded adventurer&#39;s.  They were all dark elves though so I didn&#39;t<br/>
feel too bad.  Not my fault I had an obsidian shard and gnoll lariat<br/>
equipped.  It took them two deaths to figure out what was going on and by<br/>
that time the evil eye had them engaged as well.<br/>
