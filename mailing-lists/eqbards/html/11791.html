&gt; &gt; My biggest problem with too many folks in an area isn&#39;t nothing to hunt -<br/>
&gt; &gt; or having to grab a mob before someone else does<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   You can always tell when people haven&#39;t been to SolB.  8)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   0 people in SolB is rough (will never happen tho).<br/>
&gt;   24 people in SolB imo is perfect (4 groups can run the whole place)<br/>
&gt;   32 people seems to be average (my happiness is declining however)<br/>
&gt;   40+ people is bad (and I get irritable.  lots of complaining in ooc<br/>
&gt;       about who stole whose kobold.  or ten people shouting for groups<br/>
&gt;       or a list to even get into groups.  just plain nasty)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   On Innoruuk, we have waiting lists to get into specific room<br/>
&gt;   groups, such as the king+adjoining rooms and the bat/bug entrance.<br/>
&gt;   On E&#39;ci I heard 3 separate groups each take the king, priest, champ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   When you grow up, your tune will change silky.  You all think unrest<br/>
&gt;   and highkeep are bad, you aint seen nothing yet.<br/>
