<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275065847">Caveat:  This post is not intended to start up the bard in plate armor<br/>
debate again.<br/>
<br/>
My bards base STR stat is 76 and AGI stat is 99.  He is fully outfitted with<br/>
banded armor with a couple of bronze pieces mixed in (not tunic and leggings<br/>
though)  When I created him, I envisioned him protecting himself in combat<br/>
by being quick on his feet and dodging blows instead of wearing heavy armor.<br/>
However, I have since learned that Dodge isn&#39;t always reliable and that I<br/>
may have to change my view.  <br/>
<br/>
I have gotten enough STR boosting items to raise my STR up to 89.  That<br/>
still isn&#39;t enough STR to wear bronze plate and have any room left over for<br/>
carrying loot.  My best option may be to get some rubicite but that will be<br/>
a long time down the road.  In the meantime, I need some advice.  <br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to obtain additional STR boosting items, should I instead<br/>
start loading up on AGI raising items?  I&#39;m hardly ever the main tank so I<br/>
don&#39;t really need extra STR for causing extra damage.  I primarily need it<br/>
so I can carry more stuff.  I&#39;m hoping I can offset not wearing bronze armor<br/>
by increasing my AGI which will in turn increase my chance to Dodge. I can<br/>
equip the STR items if I get encumbered.  <br/>
<br/>
A factor in this decision is this: Does the type of armor have an impact on<br/>
amount of damage received.  I know better armor increases AC but does it<br/>
also reduce damage taken?  For example, I get hit in combat and the random<br/>
number generator says I take 40 points of damage.  Currently I&#39;m wearing<br/>
Crush&#39;s ringmail tunic.  If I was wearing bronze plate, would the damage I<br/>
received be lower, say like 30pts, due to the plate armor reducing the force<br/>
of the attack?<br/>
<br/>
Any and all suggestions welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
