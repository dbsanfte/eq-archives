Are you just a stupid ass fuck?  I am so sick and tired of all these<br/>
crybabies who has raised up one character to level 12 and thinks their class<br/>
is underpowered.  All your facts are so screwed up.<br/>

You know how I said you seemed to be a reasonable debater?  I take it back.  All<br/>
of us here are having a discussion, which involves different viewpoints.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think the guy you&#39;re responding to deserves this kind of personal attack.<br/>
<br/>
Defend your views with your intellect, not your ego.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I assume that most everyone here is quite experienced and has multiple<br/>
characters.  I would also assume that most of us have been with EQ since beta<br/>
(B3 for me), and that exploring a possible character change doesn&#39;t amount to<br/>
being a &#39;crybaby&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
We all agree that being bound in non-city locations is what we want, and that<br/>
Bards don&#39;t need bind.<br/>
