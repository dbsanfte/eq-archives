<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-807264709">Unfortunately, as far as I know, there are no &quot;advanced&quot; instruments<br/>
currently in the game.  If there were, you can rest assured that tidbit of<br/>
info would get posted to this list.  The bard petition that was submitted a<br/>
few weeks back requested that Verant add magical instruments but so far the<br/>
battle drum is the only one in the game.  I have never heard of a harp<br/>
existing in the game but I haven&#39;t been in the bards guild since the last<br/>
patch so don&#39;t know if it has been added or not.  Have you seen a harp in<br/>
game or were you using it as a hypothetical example?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I was under the impression that the more &quot;advanced&quot; instruments (i.e. more<br/>
&gt; expensive ones or ones found on monsters) would have a higher multiplier<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; songs.  Like a harp found on a creature would mean that healing went up<br/>
&gt; higher than using a mandolin.<br/>
