<div id="ygrps-yiv-996818694">I spent most of the last five lvls in highkeep. I have<br/>
helped break the spawn several times and hardly ever<br/>
do we pull to guards. My point is that it doesnt have<br/>
to be that way. The reason I stay in HK is that the<br/>
inevitable deaths (see comment on not pulling to<br/>
guards) do NOT require a long corpse retrieval run. I<br/>
LOVE being able to be bound in the zone I&#39;m fighting<br/>
in.  Yes there are some REALLY dumb ppl in HK, but if<br/>
i end up in a group with one of them, I amazingly am<br/>
needed elsewhere soon...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and on bristlebane, KSing in HK is NOT ok. (It<br/>
still is ok at the orcs alas)  Anyone who pulls other<br/>
than their spawns and doesnt apologize and offer the<br/>
other group the next spawn is ostricized and I will<br/>
leave a group that is taking the ramp or the stairs<br/>
with out being asked by the group it belongs to.<br/>
