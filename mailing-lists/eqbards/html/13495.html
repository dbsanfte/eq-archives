<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186694723">I think this will make bards popular again in the front ranks. Who cares if<br/>
Naggy or Vox drops one of our buffs? It&#39;s coming back up an a few seconds<br/>
again anyway. :) You would still need to do the useless buff tactic so you<br/>
don&#39;t get caught short and have a little bit of play.<br/>

The one thing we did on nagga since he removes buffs.. we made a &quot;useless<br/>
buff line&quot;  we would buff everyone with all the useless enchantments THEN<br/>
last we would do the resist hp buffs etc... it worked great.. naga would<br/>
remobe the useless buffs first. :)<br/>
