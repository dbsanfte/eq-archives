<b>Subject:</b> RE: Grouping with PVP on non PVP servers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-938205666">The change included the inability to help them - which is how this thread<br/>
started? You cant heal or buff +PvPer&#39;s if they group with you. And they<br/>
can&#39;t/don&#39;t turn you &quot;red&quot; (anyomre :-)<br/>
<br/>
And for a few weeks there - GM&#39;s were giving out &quot;quests&quot; to ppl who wanted<br/>
to switch back from +PvP to -PvP.  IF you wanted to change back - you needed<br/>
to /petion and do what they told ya.<br/>

		Yeah, it used to be that way, right after release.<br/>
<br/>
		So yes, it used to be that way, but as<br/>
		far as I know, it was changed about week 3 or 4 of release.</div>
