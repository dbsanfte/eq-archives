&gt; &gt; I would like to get a good range weapon, but I don&#39;t know which or where<br/>
&gt; &gt; find it. It is very annoying when de mob runs away  when nit is close to<br/>
&gt; &gt; death.<br/>

&gt; Unfortunately, there is not much you can do.  Nearly all<br/>
&gt; ranged weapons except bows do pathetic damage, and we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use bows.  You will just have to chase it until you get Bellow<br/>
&gt; at L12, and Chain at L23.<br/>

which returns to you after it&#39;s thrown (i.e. it doesn&#39;t use<br/>
ammo and never gets used up).  But I haven&#39;t seen anything<br/>
like it on any spoiler site anywhere.<br/>
