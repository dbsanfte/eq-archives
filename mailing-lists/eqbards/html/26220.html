<div id="ygrps-yiv-149734501">Petite woman (5&#39;5&quot;) (height and weight proportional), lightbrown (believe it or not: no grey hair!), hazel eyes - look 10 years younger than my driver&#39;s license reminds me I am. <br/>
<br/>
In good physical shape, still working. Looking for someone to share life with - the good and the not so good - whatever life hands out. I have 3 sons, 2 grandsons, 1 male cat. Am an animal lover. Like to spend time outdoors, walking in the woods, fires in the fireplace, evenings at home snuggling or reading a good book. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy movies, am a social drinker and nonsmoker, love having small dinner parties (pretty good cook), am clean, organized, sensitive, serious, intense, honest, caring and have an ascerbic sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also very outgoing and enjoy sex very much and am open when it comes to my sexuality<br/>
<br/>
I have posted many of my pictures here <br/>
