<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011963130">So there I am, healing this lovely young lass named Shandrell after our last<br/>
fight with the hermit, when lo&#39; and behold another soul logs on at the hut.<br/>
con him, do  a /who on him, and it turns out he&#39;s a lvl 25 druid.   Now,<br/>
just as he logged on, another druid that had been solo&#39;ing the hermit was<br/>
preparing to log off.  The new arrivaly began asking the other druid<br/>
questions... like &quot;What does this spell do?&quot; and &quot;What does that spell do?&quot;<br/>
Immediately I smelled the prescence of Ebay!  As the other druid logged off,<br/>
the new arrival asked to join in rotation.<br/>
&quot;Sure,&quot; I replied, commenting in groupchat that this ought to be amusing.<br/>
My psychic powers must have been working overtime because sure enough, when<br/>
it became his turn, he KITED the hermit!  This is a MOB that I can almost<br/>
solo at 21, and he&#39;s 25 and KITING it!<br/>
Needless to say my partner and I laughed til tears rolled down our faces.<br/>
After felling the hermit, our account-buyer came back in, plopped down, and<br/>
asked me about the &quot;Winds of Karana Sheet 1&quot; quest item.  I answered him,<br/>
and not a minute later he asked the same question on /ooc.  (this also<br/>
happened with the cracked flute)<br/>
With a spawn time of 5 minutes, most folks are more than happy to rotate the<br/>
hermit, but not this guy.  Even though he couldn&#39;t med up in the time before<br/>
our spawn came, he decided that it was just too much waititng for him, so he<br/>
left.<br/>
Problems are over right?  Nope!  Throughout the night he kept /t&#39;ing me...<br/>
wanting to know if we were done camping the hermit yet.  Just when I was<br/>
about to &quot;go off&quot; on him, his newbiness hit a NEW mark:<br/>
&quot;(un-named UberNewb) says out of character, &#39;What&#39;s a topaz?&#39;&quot;<br/>
Level 25, kiting (what shold be for him) an easy blue con, and asking what a<br/>
topaz is...<br/>
Ladies and gents, he is my entrant for Newb of the Year.<br/>
:::shakes his head in disbelief once again:::<br/>
