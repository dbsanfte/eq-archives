<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433974805">Greetings all let me start by apologising my mail server of late seems to be<br/>
making multiple sends of mail.  That aside and my humblest regrets for the in-<br/>
convience let me get to the meat of the matters.  <br/>
<br/>
I am for those who do not know me a bard of the 15th seat in the chorus of<br/>
Povar.  I have recently taken the time to go get the Lullaby song and have <br/>
been well rather less then pleased with it.  I would like the input of this my<br/>
fellows.  Let this not be considered a rant or a complaint I am I quite happy<br/>
as a bard and will make do with what I say later but wonder if it should be this<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
The Lullaby to my mind is meant to be a train stopper, rescue song.  I grant<br/>
that it should have limited duration and I can accept that it should make you<br/>
unpopular.  BUT I personally think it is FAR below what it should be.  For one<br/>
thing it&#39;s duration is FAR shorter then the Laments even with a lute. Two as a <br/>
constant song even a creature that breaks out should be subject to the song<br/>
again every pulse otherwise like Lament it should be a single pulse song just <br/>
area effect.  I&#39;m not asking for a god song mind you but I also don&#39;t think<br/>
the creature should really want to kill the bard more then the person pounding<br/>
on it. Let me give two case examples.<br/>
<br/>
First time using the song, I see a poor lad being chase by two Gnoll Guards in<br/>
the Everfrost entrance, these creatures are WELL into the green for me therefor<br/>
a perfect test.  I switch off my drum to my lute and play the lullaby stoping <br/>
them in their tracks. All is as it should be.. the poor fighter continues his <br/>
battle. But then the second gnoll wakes up pummels me, again as it should be,<br/>
but I do not fight back.. But he never falls asleep again EVEN though it says<br/>
he nods off.. the poor fighter thinking to help his savior attacks the Gnoll<br/>
I still have not attacked once only played the lullaby and the gnoll never stops<br/>
or turns until it&#39;s health is so low it runs away.<br/>
<br/>
Case two in Permafrost entrance my party got into it pretty heavy and died save<br/>
me, when we get back to get the bodies there is another train there.  Knowing<br/>
I am likely to die I again with the lute sing Lullaby, which of course works<br/>
like a charge getting all of the train to stop fighting for about 15 sec before<br/>
they all pummel me, and even though I kept seeing nod messages none of them<br/>
stopped.  I did for the record get outa that one.. but not the next time I did<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes in the hurry to &quot;balance the classes&quot; Verant sometimes has<br/>
a tendancy to fudge the bard inappropriately. Everything from being overly hated<br/>
to being on the low end of the forage, sneak ladder just to balance the jack of<br/>
all trades master of none motto, sometimes I think goes just a bit too far.<br/>
