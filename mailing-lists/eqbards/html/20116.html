<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666295439">Sorry, shortened the timeline a bit.  Meant to put secondary resist as the<br/>
last mod (it went in last october for some unknown reason)  I believe it was<br/>
in but implemented incorrectly so didn&#39;t work.  I recall GZ being surprised<br/>
that we hadn&#39;t noticed it before then... could be wrong.  But you&#39;re right.<br/>
It didn&#39;t actually kick in till sept/oct timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the rest of your post, however:<br/>
The whole point of lullaby isn&#39;t to let you derail trains.  It&#39;s to allow a<br/>
bard to perform a very critical role in a group, if needed.  That being:<br/>
Crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t going to do it as well as an enchanter, no matter how hard we try<br/>
or how much we deman or how many times or different ways we ask.  Verant<br/>
doesn&#39;t want us to be a acceptable &quot;alternative&quot; to an enchanter in a group.<br/>
They want us as a adequate place holder if one is unavailable.  We&#39;ll never<br/>
be able to AE Mez while doing other things with any kind of reliability.  As<br/>
it stands now Lullaby has absolutely no uses.  All it does is get the party<br/>
killed with the bard going down first.  At least if the song was lute only<br/>
and had the 2nd resist check removed it would be very useful in situations<br/>
where we needed to do crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
And, quite frankly, no it&#39;s NOT the same as a warrior an an enchanter<br/>
working together because the warrior and enchanter can&#39;t decide to take a<br/>
break and heal to full in about 2 minutes flat while continuing to keep the<br/>
mobs mezzed.  THAT is just how powerful lulaby was.  Bards were taking out<br/>
ARMIES by themselves.  Level 30 bards were soloing lower guk as long as they<br/>
didn&#39;t hit reds.<br/>
<br/>
It was a SERIOUS issue and it needed a pretty drastic fix (this was in BETA,<br/>
not recently).  The fix, however, was fine right after final started but<br/>
they just kept adding more and more &#39;fixes&#39; into it, rendering the song<br/>
completely useless.  Removing the 2nd resist and requiring the song to be<br/>
lute only would give us back the usefulness without the overpowering ability<br/>
to use weapons to take out mobs 1 at a time with weapons etc.   That is a<br/>
REAL possibility if you have decent AC since you would only wake up the mob<br/>
when you actually hit it.  Thus giving you a higher dmg curve vs the<br/>
oponent.<br/>
<br/>
The other alternative is to leave the secondary resist in, which is ok too,<br/>
but to have charisma, level and skill affect the resist rate (Which it<br/>
doesn&#39;t right now).<br/>
<br/>
Either fix, as I said in my post, is acceptable to me.  I really don&#39;t care<br/>
HOW They fix it, I just want it to work more than it does now.  As it stands<br/>
right now it&#39;s utterly useless.<br/>
<br/>
Try to be a little less negative, bud, it comes off really harsh and makes<br/>
you sound like you hate EQ and bards in specific.  Seriously, if you don&#39;t<br/>
want to do crowd control why the hell do you care if Lullaby works at all?<br/>

&gt; An enchanter and any melee class can derail a large train of blues and<br/>
