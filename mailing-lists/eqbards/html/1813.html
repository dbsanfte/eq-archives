&gt; The initial song idea and framework, along with three working titles, was<br/>
&gt; mine, Geoffrey poked holes in it, had to the insight to make bards immune to<br/>
&gt; mana regen, picked one of the three titles, and took it to the next stage<br/>
&gt; for approval.  Ryan freaked out, calmed down, and then the coders went to<br/>
&gt; work.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since you seem to have some involvement it this, do you know when the<br/>
following bugs are going to be fixed?<br/>
<br/>
Accellerando and SoW:<br/>
  When you play accelerando and someone has SoW on, when the<br/>
accellerando effect fades, the person&#39;s speed is reset to character<br/>
default, dispite the fact that the SoW icon still shows and zoning<br/>
restores SoW. This also happens with other songs that duplicate spells,<br/>
like levitate and water breathing. This bug is really annoying and has<br/>
been reported since beta P4.<br/>
<br/>
L30 song still has the range bug that was fixed for the Furfil&#39;s songs.<br/>
<br/>
If a druid casts shared wolf form on you while you are playing a song,<br/>
your songs stick, just like they did with Tomahawks until the last<br/>
patch.<br/>
