<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851235361">I&#39;ve been well inundated with the notion that Lower Guk and Sol B will be my<br/>
home from 35 up since there are very few other places to be. My reasons for<br/>
going to guk were two fold.<br/>
<br/>
1) I had to go just because I felt I would be able to do something there.<br/>
Things went very well for me and I made half a bubble of my first hell level<br/>
in a little over an hour.<br/>
<br/>
2) I wanted to kill the gargoyle to get my basalt carapace first hand.<br/>
(which I did) I&#39;m a firm believer in earning my equipment. Besides, lambent<br/>
BPs go for 1000-1500 p on my server, and I just don&#39;t have the cash.<br/>
<br/>
Generally I tend to aviod the crowded areas of the server. Although since<br/>
the tribunal is a fairly new server, it isn&#39;t all that crowded yet. (40<br/>
people in lower guk on friday night, 30 in sol b)<br/>
<br/>
For the last 5 levels I&#39;ve been a sol a junkie. This is one of the most<br/>
underused zones in the game. The most I&#39;ve ever seen in the zone were 25<br/>
people. Also, if you have a good group and a good puller, the exp flows so<br/>
fast you have trouble keeping your skills maxed. (I made levels 25, 26, 28<br/>
in one day each) My current plan is to stay in sol a until I hit 32 or I get<br/>
my firewalker boots. Once I hit 32 I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll be accepted everywhere,<br/>
so I&#39;ll probably venture over to MM and try to get my instruments and finish<br/>
off my lambent BP. Depending on how camped the castle is on my server I may<br/>
stay and try to get a pair of EBWs. (I figure that ought to be good for at<br/>
least 3-4 levels) Then I&#39;ll be ready to hit L Guk, Sol B or Kedge. Of course<br/>
if I find someplace less crowded, then I&#39;ll convince my group to follow me.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s the plan at least. We&#39;ll see how it works out. ;┬¼ )<br/>

Congratulations on level 30!  It&#39;s not long now until 32 when you&#39;ll become<br/>
every caster&#39;s friend.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s excellent that you explored some of Lower Guk, it&#39;s a fun place,<br/>
however, I&#39;d like to offer a friendly word of advice.  Go elsewhere until<br/>
you get 35th or so (Cazic-Thule, Rathe Mts., Mistmoore, Paw), because from<br/>
35th up about the only places you can go routinely for experience are Lower<br/>
Guk, Sol B and occassionally Mistmoore and Paw.  Believe me when I say that<br/>
you will get VERY VERY tired of these zones, and the earlier you start going<br/>
there the sooner you get tired of them.<br/>
<br/>
As to Mistmoore, I do have some tips for getting drums.  I don&#39;t have time<br/>
to type it up and the moment (cause I&#39;m damn longwinded as we all know), but<br/>
I will do so today and post what I know.  That&#39;s an interesting camp.<br/>
