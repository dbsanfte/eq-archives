 </span></blockquote>Even with an Enchanter in the party, I&#39;ll often keep Pixie strike memmed,<br/>
just in case.  I can usually keep 3 targets mezzed (barring resists) quite<br/>
comfortably, but that effectively removes me from combat completely - I<br/>
can&#39;t melee or twist other songs, since once I&#39;ve re-mezzed one target, I&#39;m<br/>
straight onto the next.<br/>
<br/>
The other reason I keep it memmed is because it&#39;s just so darn handy to<br/>
interrupt casters.<br/>
<br/>
I had *the* closest escape in the Dreadlands the other night.  I was intent<br/>
on making 46 and decided to solo for a while since group exp in DL is<br/>
comparatively slow.  I was chain-charming things and my last thrall was a<br/>
SoW&#39;d Drachnid Widow which was at half health from it&#39;s last fight.  I<br/>
pulled it to the Karnors east wall and weaved my way through the pillars,<br/>
chanting, chaining and Selo&#39;s-ing.<br/>
<br/>
She got a few big double hits on me which made me wince, but I thought I<br/>
could handle it.  Then, horror of all horrors, she rooted me and moved in<br/>
for the kill.  At first I tried to charm her, but she kept stunning me.  All<br/>
of a sudden I&#39;m down to less than a bubble of health and the realisation<br/>
that my last couple of hours work was all for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I gave up on charm and started mashing Pixie Strike.  It landed.  I quickly<br/>
swapped my tambourine for lute and twisted in Hymn.  Another burst of Pixie<br/>
Strike and she remained mesmerised.  I kept this going for 5 or 6 pulses of<br/>
Pixie Strike until the roots fell from my feet and I thought &quot;screw this&quot;<br/>
and made for the zone.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s a /rude to the 49 SK from Prophecy who stood by and watched the<br/>
whole time. :P<br/>
<br/>
I swear, when I zoned into FV, my hands were clammy and shaking.  It&#39;s just<br/>
a game, right?<br/>
<br/>
Pixie Strike is one song I&#39;ll never do without - Enchanter or no.  I can&#39;t<br/>
wait until 53 for Song of Twilight.</div>
