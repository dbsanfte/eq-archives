<div id="ygrps-yiv-744000438">Well, this about does it for me.  Unless Decaying Gnome skeletons and large<br/>
rats are now higher level monsters GZ is a fool.  I don&#39;t usually say that<br/>
lightly, but in this case it is well deserved.  Giving us the lame excuse<br/>
that higher level monsters get an unseen second save is blatantly<br/>
ridiculous.  The song does the exact same thing against level one monsters.<br/>
I&#39;ve had it up to my ears with this ridiculous rhetoric.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Gypsy Princess and I have charisma of 141. Every round I got the &#39;so and <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;so head nods&#39; message and every nearly every round the test subject was <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;able to attack me (about 1 in 10 rounds he would not).<br/>

As most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are two saving <br/>
throws that happen with an &quot;Enthrall&quot; style effect (such as Kelin&#39;s Lucid <br/>
Lullaby) hits a creature. The first saving throw is against the target&#39;s <br/>
Magic Resistance. The second saving throw only happens with high level <br/>
monsters - they get a secondary save based on their level. The reason for <br/>
this is that the Enthrall effect is very, very powerful - it allows a single<br/>
<br/>
player to remove a creature from combat. This means that a party that could <br/>
handle two &quot;X&quot; level mobs might be able to take three, or even four of them <br/>
on if there is somebody around with the Enthrall effect.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have a harder time<br/>
<br/>
being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player can take out a single <br/>
opponent of equal level. By mid levels this is much harder, and by high <br/>
levels it is virtually impossible. Allowing a single player to remove one or<br/>
<br/>
more creatures from combat at high levels is sick level powerful - to the <br/>
point that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<br/>
<br/>
The second saving throw does not send a message the environment - and that <br/>
is something that is on our list of issues to address. There are, however, <br/>
no bugs with the Song.<br/>
