<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544704350">Agreed - there&#39;s not only a lot of trust - but agreement on philosophy.<br/>
Your argument about warrior needing the weapon for example.   There are a<br/>
lot of factors at play.  How good were the weapons the warrior and the bard<br/>
were using before that weapon dropped?  If warrior had  weapon only<br/>
marginally worse than the new one that dropped - but the bard was wielding<br/>
SSOY&#39;s - I&#39;d say the bard &quot;needed&quot; that new one a lot more than the warrior.<br/>
Sure the warrior is going to make a &quot;lot better use&quot; than the other.   Does<br/>
the guild look at item as pretty much belong to the guild and hence - the<br/>
warrior surrenders that prior &quot;uber&quot; item to the bard who then stops using<br/>
one of his SSOY&#39;s?  Or does this new weapon that the warrior get allow him<br/>
to sell his prior one on the open market and get even better item?<br/>
<br/>
Another point.  If all you ever do is large raids with your guild - I agree<br/>
that the warrior is in a much better place for that item.  But if you do<br/>
single group ops (even with all guild members) the Bard will OFTEN be in a<br/>
position where his melee skills will make or break the group.  This is why I<br/>
think the argument that haste items never go to bards.<br/>
<br/>
My guild, for example, has a lot of Rangers and a goodly number of<br/>
Shadowknights.  I&#39;ve been in groups with only two tanks - none being a<br/>
warrior - and my melee was pretty important to taking down mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Also - it gets very frustrating - need or not - to go on raid after raid -<br/>
and seeing people getting new and cool stuff - and you going long periods of<br/>
times without it.  This is a big reason for points system - some people seem<br/>
to ALWAYS roll low.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that the raid leaders aren&#39;t doing a good job taking these<br/>
things into consideration.  Unless you are a new guild - I&#39;d guess they are<br/>
doing a great job of it - or I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have a lot of dissension in the<br/>
guild.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just commenting that these issues can be VERY complex - and if the<br/>
leaders are like the majority of the EQ community (including it seems at<br/>
times Verant) who don&#39;t truly understand the Bard class - we&#39;re gonna get<br/>
the short end of the stick.<br/>

Wow!! I&#39;m impressed you have a raid leader who can be trusted to be this<br/>
fair.  Even with our point system the melee (prime looters) often just take<br/>
items to twink with, forget to announce loot, etc.  If our old hunt leader<br/>
had been in charge of loot, OMG half of us never would have gotten anything<br/>
other than throw down equipment.  Not sure it would be much better now to be<br/>
honest.  Very impressive that your guild stays together! :)<br/>
