<div id="ygrps-yiv-733439851">The 15 buff trick was fixed a long time ago.  They just made it so any new<br/>
icon would overwrite the top icon in your stack if your stack was full.<br/>
This cancel magic addition had nothing to do with that, they just wanted to<br/>
make dragons harder.<br/>
<br/>
This change makes bards invaluable.  Here&#39;s what we did against the dragons<br/>
the last few times (think we&#39;ve killed 3 since the cancel magic patch went<br/>
in).  Buff with a few worthless buffs first, i.e resist disease, see invis,<br/>
etc.  Continue buffing with the good stuff.  Dispel your first crappy buff.<br/>
Fill this new, empty top slot with the elemental rhythems icon.  Every time<br/>
you get dispelled, elemental will be the one to go, to be refreshed next<br/>
pulse.  You&#39;ll never lose a buff this way.  Since the dragon has just<br/>
breathed on you, its unlikely it will breath again before your next 6 second<br/>
pulse so you wont miss the resists.<br/>
Its good to actually have 2 empty slots at the top, because sometimes, on<br/>
rare occasions, the fear icon will be timed just so as to appear in the top<br/>
empty slot just after its gets debuffed and hasn&#39;t been refreshed yet.  That<br/>
way you still have a free, top of stack slot for elemental to fall into.<br/>
If you&#39;re blessed with being able to twist 2 songs during a dragon fight<br/>
(lag is usually too bad for me) you could leave more slots available.<br/>

This last dragon buff was done in reaction to an exploit (well, maybe it&#39;s<br/>
an exploit or maybe it&#39;s a techique - hard to say.)  And in a way that only<br/>
Verant can achieve they have changed things so that now all groups will use<br/>
the same technique (or exploit) that Verant was trying to<br/>
stop/overcome/address &lt;sheesh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems that Dragon Fear would not &#39;stick&#39; if you had 15 (or was it more<br/>
than 15) buff icons. Did not matter much what they were, just stack 15 buff<br/>
icons on your screen and you were resistant to Dragon Fear.  Granted some<br/>
adventurers prolly paid dearly finding this out and perhaps they had some<br/>
&#39;right&#39; to employ this technique.<br/>
<br/>
So, now that Dragon Fear strips buffs (cancel magic/pillage enchantment<br/>
whatever), everyone is gonna pile on as many useless buffs as possible - 15,<br/>
20 whatever - exactly what the so-called exploiters were doing.<br/>
<br/>
But anyhow - I&#39;d say dont worry.  In 2004, when you go for your dragon, it<br/>
will be a different dragon than the ones fought today just as ours are<br/>
different from the ones fought 5 months ago.  We have new tactics; you will<br/>
have new tactics.  I think you will have great fun when you time comes.<br/>
