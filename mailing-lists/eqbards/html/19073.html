I&#39;ll be happy to take any extra coins you may come across ;)   I have <br/>
the Dalnir coin and Bloodgill coin.  I thought about going into <br/>
Kaesora with my lil druid, but he was just to young apparently (lvl <br/>
26).  That Guardian Spectre at the entrance greeted him with a few <br/>
hard slaps and he ran him right out of there!.<br/>

&gt; Greetings!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went to Kaesora to explore and try for the coin.  Me 51, &#39;nother <br/>
Bard 51,<br/>
&gt; third bard 50 and wizard 50.  I had a map - get one.  We zoned in <br/>
and iirc<br/>
&gt; took the left passage - then killed some bugs - then took a right <br/>
(check<br/>
&gt; map) and headed for the library on a whim.  There were several bugs <br/>
to kill<br/>
&gt; along the way and some spec&#39;s too.  Nothing to break a sweat for <br/>
our levels<br/>
&gt; although we lamented and tried to pull singles as best we could.  <br/>
We pulled<br/>
&gt; to clear the outside of the library then moved up closer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the porch, we agro&#39;d something and as we fought we also agro&#39;s <br/>
the &#39;??<br/>
&gt; librarian&#39; and killed &#39;em both.  The something turned out to be the <br/>
froog<br/>
&gt; that dropped the coin for the quest.  Something else there dropped <br/>
a book<br/>
&gt; (?? iirc) that had good int +5 or +6 and that made our wiz happy.  <br/>
Then we<br/>
&gt; went in the library and looked around.  Perhaps killed something <br/>
else -<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t remember.  We did happen to go up stairs and looked around the<br/>
&gt; balcony.  On the ground, we found something for one of the medallion<br/>
&gt; quests - &quot;piece of a medallion&quot; or something.  BTW - we were the <br/>
only ppl in<br/>
&gt; the zone - sad but true - and it looked to be a very cool zone for <br/>
ppl who<br/>
&gt; can get exp at this level.  You&#39;d want a good party, some anti-<br/>
poison<br/>
&gt; songs/spells but it looked to be good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went outside and started to look around. Then we got our <br/>
obligatory<br/>
&gt; over-pull.  About 6 things agro&#39;d and we were swarmed by greenies.  <br/>
Evac was<br/>
&gt; no problem as we got what we wanted and it was time to go anyhow.  <br/>
Next<br/>
&gt; time, we wil be heading to Dalnir&#39;s for the Royal Crown.  Then <br/>
Suladan will<br/>
&gt; have all 6 coins.  Kaldivar needs Kasora and Dalnir.  I have Selos <br/>
Drums so<br/>
&gt; its not as high a priority for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I dont know if the froog that drops the coin in Kaesora roams <br/>
the whole<br/>
&gt; dungeon or he is always found in the library area - but that&#39;s <br/>
where we<br/>
&gt; found him.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am doing this quest at the moment and have 4 of the coins. I <br/>
just need<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dalnir one and the Kaesora one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also any tips for Kaesora? I&#39;ve never been there but it sounds a <br/>
bit of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; nightmare. Luckily I am part of a regularish group of level 43 to <br/>
52<br/>
&gt; players<br/>
&gt; &gt; so I&#39;m not too worried about getting killed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also spoilers on the location of the coin in Kaesora would be most<br/>
&gt; welcome. </span></blockquote></div>
