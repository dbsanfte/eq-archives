<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153786823">I had an odd experience with training or not training duel wield.<br/>
<br/>
I hit level 17 and decided to head back to Kelethin to pick my new song. I<br/>
knew that I could now use duel wield and that I probably need to point into<br/>
it for it to work, but I forgot to train in Freeport before I left, and then<br/>
when I arrived at Kelethin I forgot to train  there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Now back in Freeport I went to the guild intent on putting some points into<br/>
duel wield before I returned to hunting in Oasis. But to my surprise when I<br/>
scrolled down to duel wield in the skills window I did not see the friendly<br/>
&quot;no charge&quot; text, but a charge of 1 plat 3 gold. Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
So off I went to oasis, equipped my dwarven axe and combine longsword and<br/>
proceeded to pound crocs..<br/>
<br/>
You have become better at duel wield (35)<br/>
<br/>
So I am stumped. I never tried to use two weapons before, didn&#39;t train it,<br/>
and all of a sudden I am starting out with a skill of 34.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

&gt; Well you are able to live without putting a asingle point into the skill.<br/>
&gt; It will take forever to get the first few points through actually using<br/>
&gt; it.  I tried to do begging from scratch while waiting for the boat.  I<br/>
&gt; think I had to hit that button about 200-300 times before I got the<br/>
&gt; begging(1) message.  What can I say I took the boat a lot in my youth back<br/>
&gt; in the days when there was only one boat travelling from Butcherblock and<br/>
&gt; Freeport ^_^.<br/>

&gt; &gt; like many skills (e.g. warrior&#39;s double attack) i thought we had to put<br/>
1<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill point into duel wield to learn the basics.  could be wrong though<br/>
&gt; &gt; hehe.<br/>
