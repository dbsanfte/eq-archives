&gt;Both of the lists of song descriptions that I&#39;ve seen raved over this<br/>
&gt;spell.  One called it &quot;the feign death of the bard world.&quot;  I just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;get it.  I have never found it to do anything except make just about every<br/>
&gt;monster in range mad at me, even when I tried it with a Mandolin and a<br/>
&gt;string skill of 100.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We tested it at the aquagoblin camp in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, playing the song<br/>
&gt;to see if it would let me approach the camp without waking the goblins.<br/>
&gt; Out of five tries (at 2 to 4 goblins apiece) I saw two messages of a<br/>
&gt;goblin&#39;s head nodding, and all five times all of the goblins immediately<br/>
&gt;swarmed me (including the one who nodded).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Earlier, I tried it in Blackburrow on a batch of regular and scrawny<br/>
&gt;gnolls, all green to me.  (The remnants of a small train after the trainee<br/>
&gt;fled the zone.)  Again, they all attacked me.  I also tried it in the<br/>
&gt;newbie zone.  Result: one rat nodding and one rat attacking me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is there something I&#39;m doing wrong, or are all the people who wrote good<br/>
&gt;things about the song basing their comments on a beta version that no<br/>
&gt;longer applies?<br/>
