<div id="ygrps-yiv-58011181">Yes Bob, you&#39;re absolutely right. However, this is not a role-playing issue. <br/>
  When you are sitting on the boat one second and on a rock the next with <br/>
the boat nowhere in sight, that is a bug. The /loc command is a bug-fix <br/>
command. In a normal game situation I would not use it, but as a bug-fix I <br/>
greatly appreciate having it available and I SURE appreciate all the help <br/>
from the great citizens of Norrath that frequent this list.<br/>

&gt;In a similar vein to the discussion of bards wearing plate and other<br/>
&gt;aspects of roleplaying, are there other hardheads out their who would<br/>
&gt;rather drown than use /loc and numeric coordinates?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally I consider /loc a debugging command and a roleplaying<br/>
&gt;abomination.  I refuse to deal with it.  If we are to have such a pin-point<br/>
&gt;locating and finding capability, it should be a proper in-game mechanism,<br/>
&gt;not a computer programming artifact.<br/>
