Something for you to do would be get Lambent Armor.  The class specific<br/>
armor quests were designed to be completed by players and groups of players<br/>
in the mid 30&#39;s to 40&#39;s.  And it&#39;s fun to actually go around and get the<br/>
items and do the quests (as opposed to &quot;/auc WTB: full lambent&quot; in Greater<br/>
Spamdark or East Commonspam.  Full lambent is decent stuff for bard until he<br/>
can get to 48-52 and be doing Plane of Hate raids.<br/>
<br/>
Shada: I too used to hear that having sta at 100+ would circumvent the bad<br/>
effects when your sta bar id depleted.  I think that they have (stealth<br/>
nerf) changed this recently.  Only last week, I had first hand experience<br/>
with a 56 warrior who has sta way over 100 and when his sta bar depleted,<br/>
you could see a noticeable slow down in his attack speed (and when he got a<br/>
sta replenish buff, you could see it get noticable faster.) Even so, I would<br/>
reccommend to ppl starting bards that they max out sta then put the rest in<br/>
dex or str (forget cha - your cha is prolly fine and easy enough to boost<br/>
with jewel craft bracers etc.) Sta adds hps and every little bit helps.<br/>

Hiyas,<br/>
<br/>
My first and still the only character in eq is a bard and because I am a<br/>
casual player I could just advance to the 31st level in some 6 months. We<br/>
founded a guild in Morrell Thule and the guild is faring hell better than me<br/>
in comparison. Still as a newly founded guild we do not have a higher level<br/>
or even a equal level bard, so I do have many questions concerning bards and<br/>
how should a bard played. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a curious and inexperienced bard speaking here so pls do not hesitate<br/>
to help. :P</div>
