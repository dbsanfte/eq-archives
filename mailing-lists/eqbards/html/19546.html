<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122122006">Hehe I dunno if they&#39;re worth 15k PP but they do seem to be a pretty rare<br/>
drop.  I spend a LOT of time in Karnors and haven&#39;t seen them drop but twice<br/>
(I got the first set, another friend of mine got the second).  And I have<br/>
yet to see the gloves drop.  Anyone know what critter drops them?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Anyone notice any difference in the drops in Frontier since the patch?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Funny you should ask...<br/>
&gt;      Last night some guildmates and I decided to camp the giants in FV<br/>
(it&#39;s rarely taken on The Rathe).  After breaking the camp, we settled into<br/>
a nice three hour session of &quot;Pop-n-Pull&quot;, (Me-34th lvl bard, 36 druid, 39<br/>
then dinged to 40 druid, a 40-ish mage, then later a 32 druid joined us),<br/>
except for one time where our puller pulled one and another spawned right in<br/>
his path.  While the exp was nice, the loot was not worth our time.  All<br/>
told, we came away with 1 Black Pearl, 1 Axe of the Iron Back, a Word, and a<br/>
sum total of 10pp in coins.  Was I expecting Forest Loops in every drop?<br/>
No.  But to personally loot 8-9 giants and have 5 or 6 with *nothing* (no<br/>
items or money) is just wrong.  From even just a coinage standpoint, I would<br/>
have come out muuuuch better by far if I had just gone to SK and camped the<br/>
Hermit :oP<br/>
&gt; Is it my imagination, or did someone at Verant make a comment along the<br/>
lines of loot being comparable to the difficulty of the creature?  FYI:<br/>
those giants are quite tough ;o)~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One more thing:  How much is Singing Steel going for on the other servers?<br/>
Saw a level one bard mule last night auctioning SS Boots.  He told me he can<br/>
get 15k plat for them.  For that much, I&#39;ld rather  just try to organize a<br/>
guild event in Karnor&#39;s and loot them myself :oP<br/>
