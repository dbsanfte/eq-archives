&lt;&lt; So I guess, what I am saying, here and in a couple other posts, is... This<br/>
 game is as fun as you want it to be.  If you dont have fun unless you&#39;re<br/>
 &quot;safe&quot;... well... I feel for you.  If you dont have fun with anything but<br/>
 bashing NPC skulls well... I guess I feel for you too.  But you can find<br/>
 your sort of fun in EQ, same as the rest of us.  I just wish you&#39;d quit<br/>
 bitching about the rest of us getting to have OUR fun too.<br/>
 <br/>
 (generalized you there, please dont take it personally.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
whoa! way outta left field there don&#39;t ya think? If you contstrued any of my <br/>
comments as &quot;bitching&quot; please don&#39;t respond to them. Bitching wasn&#39;t what i <br/>
intended , and it isn&#39;t what i did. As far as only being safe , that isn&#39;t <br/>
what I like , i was simply stating my view that exploring and hunting can be <br/>
easier said than done. And where you dug up any of those ideas about me <br/>
bashing skulls , or harping on your fun . I just don&#39;t have a clue. On an <br/>
equally related note , i never asked you to feel for me , nor would i ever <br/>
want you to. <br/>
<br/>
And yes i did take that personally , and putting something like that at the <br/>
end of such comments is utter bull. You had an intelligent post up until the <br/>
end, therefore an intelligent person will know how someone will take it, <br/>
regardless of the footnote.<br/>
