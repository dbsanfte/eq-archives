&gt;	As example of how great accel is compared to sow, last night i was<br/>
&gt;47 pounds over and i was still running faster then my druid friend that was<br/>
&gt;in wolf form. They need to make sow removable by clicking on it<br/>

level 22 ranger (grouped with me), and a level 45 shaman (not grouped with <br/>
me).  The shaman had SoW on, I had Selos with drum going. We actually had to <br/>
stop and wait for the shaman to catch up to us.  I know Selos is faster than <br/>
SoW, but I sure did get a kick out of the shaman&#39;s amazement at how much <br/>
faster Selos is. ;-)<br/>
