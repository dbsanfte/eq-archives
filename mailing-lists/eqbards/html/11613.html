<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877299317">The Butler is an SK as are the ancille cooks, the Maid is a wizard and<br/>
she loves to try and root before burning. The Butler is very good about<br/>
remembering to unload his HT on you, fortunately he does it in the<br/>
opening and not when you are low on hp. =)<br/>

P.S. Remember that what a druid can solo and what a bard can solo easily<br/>
are two different things. The bane of the bard class is any casting<br/>
monster, while we can shred most lower level meleers quite easily.<br/>
Casting classes love to burn down casters. Also ask the druid how many<br/>
huge trains he&#39;s pulled to the zone after messing up a pull on the<br/>
Butler, or how many times he moved to the wrong spot and had both cooks<br/>
aggro on him (assumes he is KOS in MM). Most will say none, but in fact<br/>
the super huge trains at the zone in MM are usually as a result of one<br/>
higher level player putting everyone in jeopardy instead of just dying<br/>
quietly and peacefully. I am *not* saying your druid friend does this,<br/>
but maybe he does. Also, the point about the con in wolfform is<br/>
important. Let&#39;s see him try fighting the &quot;easy&quot; butler in place without<br/>
Wolfform *laugh*.</div>
