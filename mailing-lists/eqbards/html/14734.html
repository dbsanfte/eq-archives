Against reds, I feel charisma does help.  The sample size is<br/>
small (not often that my group fights multiple reds) so I<br/>
can&#39;t say for sure.  But I&#39;ve had many cases where a red mob<br/>
seemed easier to Pixie Strike after I got a charisma buff, and<br/>
no cases where a red mob seemed harder to PS after I got a<br/>
charisma buff.<br/>
