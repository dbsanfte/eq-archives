<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055902224">Hehe, I carry 2 stacks of Jasper and 2 stacks of Bloodstones - and have for<br/>
the past 10 levels. BYO_Reagents and your healer/buff types are more than<br/>
willing to cast w/o all the drivel about &quot;only the tanks get symbols...&quot;<br/>
(This is an excellent tip I got off this list! Thanks for posting it!)<br/>
<br/>
But - my suggestion was to basically give the bard:<br/>
<br/>
a) target ony (got to select some one)<br/>
b) single pulse song that casts (like charillion song - one shot is all<br/>
thats needed)<br/>
c) a symbol buff or rune (using one of the reagents - pls pls NOT peridot!)<br/>
<br/>
And then you&#39;d only worry about carrying as many stones as your basic<br/>
cleric/pallidan/enchater does.  Maybe you&#39;d always have a good supply.  Or<br/>
maybe you&#39;d have a hot key: &quot;only the bard gets a symbol buff because....&quot;<br/>

&gt; ack, a reagent?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can you imagine carrying 20 reagents to handle singing that song through<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; fight?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think a different solution needs to be reached.<br/>
