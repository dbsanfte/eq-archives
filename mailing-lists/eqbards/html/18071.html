<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940545570">Okay, this is a bit off topic, but us bards being the info-retentive people <br/>
we are, I thought I&#39;d share just a few tidbits with you all.<br/>
<br/>
1) RoK will launch on Monday, April 24th (time undecided) regardless of who <br/>
has their CDs or not.  Those people who ordered prior to the 20th and do <br/>
not receive their CD before the 24th will receive a refund of all shipping <br/>
charges, plus a free month of game play.  These arrangements to be handled <br/>
by email.<br/>
<br/>
2) Some few persons have reached 51st, but were immediately demoted back to <br/>
50th.  These persons are all Guides playing their play characters, so don&#39;t <br/>
expect to be able to level any time before the 24th.<br/>
<br/>
3) You will need to have the CD and Registration Key in order to a) Visit <br/>
Kunark with your existing characters, 2) Level above 50th, or 3) Create an <br/>
Iksar character.  You will NOT need the RoK upgrade to see Iksar players in <br/>
the rest of the world, or to purchase/trade Kunark-specific items from them.<br/>
<br/>
4) I do not have a CD, and am currently not planning on purchasing one.<br/>
