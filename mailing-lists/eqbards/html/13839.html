<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841489145">Frankly I don&#39;t like to think too much about this, but I&#39;ll come clean.  If<br/>
I recall correctly Crier has ~54 days of played time.  I checked about three<br/>
nights ago so I could be mistaken by a day or two - I was comparing my 44th<br/>
bard to a 46th cleric friend (she had 84 days, or 2,016 hrs).  That puts my<br/>
played time on Crier alone at approximately 1,296 hours.  I also have a 23rd<br/>
monk, 20th Enchanter and several chars at lvls 1-8.  My monk was my first EQ<br/>
char and I played him a lot learning the game, so he probably has nearly as<br/>
many hrs as Crier despite being half her level.<br/>
<br/>
Since your characters are on different servers, you&#39;ve probably had a<br/>
slightly rougher time with each of them than if they&#39;d been on the same<br/>
server.  When I started my bard Crier, my monk bought her a full suit of<br/>
banded for 85pp and gave her about 40pp to get started.  Even a mild<br/>
twinkage like that is a huge boost at early levels (I could really mow<br/>
through the gnolls in Blackburrow back then).  If a player has a 50 necro,<br/>
he can basically twink his new warrior with a Executioner&#39;s Axe, full<br/>
Crafted Armor, jewelry etc.  In addition he now knows all the zones, where<br/>
to hunt at each level, what to skip, where the items are located, he&#39;s got<br/>
friends, and on and on.  This makes leveling the second char vastly faster,<br/>
as evidenced by my bard vs. my monk.  My monk was clueless.<br/>
<br/>
Do not feel bad or jealous.  I have found in my informal surveys that a<br/>
large percentage of the players with 50s or multiple 50s are college<br/>
students.  They have fast connections in their dorms and a lot of free time.<br/>
Quite seriously I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all to find that EQ was the<br/>
reason that a lot of students had flunked out of school.  EQ is a drug and<br/>
can be overdone just like cocaine, crack, heroin.  How many of us on this<br/>
list have practically crawled out of bed in the morning and sat zombie-like<br/>
through work?  Or called in &quot;sick&quot; to play?  Or spent 40 hours playing over<br/>
a weekend and were pissed when it was over?  There is a psychologically<br/>
addictive aspect to these games that will have to be dealt with by society<br/>
at some point.  As the worlds become more and more realistic and the<br/>
interfaces become more accessible to non-computer oriented folks there will<br/>
be a rising percentage of the populace that has this addiction.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>
&gt; since about three weeks after release.  It simply blows my mind<br/>
&gt; that anyone<br/>
&gt; could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; got three<br/>
&gt; characters, each on a different server:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my first character ever)<br/>
&gt; Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>
&gt; Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>
&gt; I just have to know what the play time is on a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>
&gt; characters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>
&gt; than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; trolling...just bloody<br/>
&gt; well amazed and curious (and obviously jealous). </span></blockquote></div>
