<div id="ygrps-yiv-813717181">I frankly admit I want bards to have bind because it to hard to get bound<br/>
sometimes and I think being the least melee of the melee/caster hybrids I<br/>
think they have the most reason to be allowed it.  But, I know Verant has<br/>
people who are not happy about the way bind id even now much less giving any<br/>
more people the ability.  So...<br/>
<br/>
Ok, here&#39;s a proposal to consider.  No new classes get the ability to bind.<br/>
Everyone has the same rules for binding.  Casters can bind in the cities as<br/>
they do now.  Casters can bind anyone in any zone but only if they use a<br/>
reagent.  More specifically the reagent should be one that is either<br/>
expensive, or requires obtaining in some non-plat related way such as a<br/>
special forage.<br/>
<br/>
This would solve the binding availability problem to some degree as well as<br/>
solving the problem of forcing people to run naked all over Norrath just<br/>
because they aren&#39;t a caster.  Also make some zones unbindable period.  No<br/>
one can bind in Nagafen&#39;s Lair.  Now you won&#39;t have to make that dragon so<br/>
hard cause when a caster dies he ain&#39;t just memming and running around the<br/>
corner to blast away.  Now he has to figure out how t get past al the weenie<br/>
critters naked.  Obviously those weenie critters would squish my poor little<br/>
bard but to a guy takin&#39; on Nagafen they&#39;re weenie critters.<br/>
