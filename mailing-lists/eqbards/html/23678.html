<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708683828">True it happens on occasion - I can count, um three or four times since<br/>
March of &#39;99 when I started playing this game...  But for Bards - happens at<br/>
least three or four times A WEEK!<br/>

uhmmm, well, last time i was in seb, grouped with a warrior who for some odd<br/>
reason kept telling our wizzie to summon a pet.  the wiz was wearing a red<br/>
robe, /shrug.  then he started to tell me (i was playing my enchanter):<br/>
&quot;mana suck this frog!&quot; and not just one time. he would point to a frog and<br/>
tell me to mana tap it. then tell the wiz to summon a pet. at first we kinda<br/>
made jokes: &quot;dude, i never bought that spell!&quot;  But he didn;t seem to get it<br/>
and kept telling us what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Finally i told him, &quot;dude, just exactly how long is the recycle time on<br/>
theft of thought? when the spell is recycled - and when i need mana - trust<br/>
me - i will tap them.  and btw, our wizzie cant summon pets worth a darn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
so, i dunno if our study is totally scientific, but its not just bards,<br/>
afaict<br/>
