<div id="ygrps-yiv-109786470">Yes this will not happen because Verant does not have a problem with<br/>
twinking. If you adventure and get a item you can&#39;t use why shouldn&#39;t you be<br/>
able to make a new char and use it? That&#39;s what Verant said&#39;s and I happen<br/>
to agree because what else is there for a level 50 to do?<br/>

&gt;&gt;   I wish our lambent armor was NO DROP, definitely.  This isn&#39;t the<br/>
&gt;&gt;   first time, I&#39;ve said it.  Won&#39;t be the last.  I try to /feedback<br/>
&gt;&gt;   my ideas, but nothing has ever come from it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think ALL the quest armor for all the classes should be NO DROP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And I think items should have level limits on them.  If they can put a<br/>

&gt;feel as though the magic within this item would overwhelm you.&quot;  not<br/>
&gt;necessarily all &quot;powerful&quot; items, but a lot of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;of course, this will never happen. :)<br/>
