&gt; &gt;Please do not do this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A lot of fiesty people on the list today.  I will make this<br/>
&gt;short.  I am going to do what Harmonic wants to do.  If I want<br/>
&gt;to call fear/chains, reverse-kiting -or- if I want to play the<br/>
&gt;Jig o&#39; Vigor because it makes people feel better, I WILL.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand and respect your decision to do whatever you want.  I also <br/>
prefer myself to inform people who have misconceptions about how bard songs <br/>
work, as a service to other bards who will someday group with the same <br/>
people who don&#39;t understand us now.<br/>
<br/>
As for the reverse-kiting issue, I think the only point here is that kiting <br/>
has somehow acquired a very bad reputation among Norrathian citizens (almost <br/>
exclusively those classes who can&#39;t do it, in fact), and since 1) chains and <br/>
kiting does not involve the monster chasing you (one of the fundamental <br/>
concepts of kiting, thus the recent nerf); and 2) having the word kiting in <br/>
the name will cause any number of misconceptions and resentment, it is not <br/>
unreasonable that we, as a bardic community, try to find a more appropriate <br/>
term for this activity.  This term I will leave to our more experienced <br/>
brethren to provide, as I don&#39;t have the songs in question, and have thus no <br/>
personal experience with chains + fear.  Should such a term be created, it <br/>
is of course your choice to use it or not as you prefer.  For the record, I <br/>
hate the terms &quot;twisting&quot; and &quot;juggling&quot; (referring to our songs) and have <br/>
always used &quot;harmonizing&quot; in their place, an idiosyncracy on a related note, <br/>
as it were.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can we please move on, and get off these kinda of &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;like your style&quot; comments?  I mean come on, guys.  I play<br/>
&gt;my way, and you&#39;ll play yours.  There&#39;s no reason to try to<br/>
&gt;change any of that.  I&#39;m not telling you all what to say<br/>
&gt;or which songs to play, unless it&#39;s a suggestion in a battle<br/>
&gt;situation.  I suggest you respect me in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, I like your style, even if I do things differently.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m not upset, but I already have a mother who asks me if<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m eating the right foods and taking care of myself.  You<br/>
&gt;all don&#39;t need to take up that task, you&#39;ve got more important<br/>
&gt;things to worry about (so to speak) =)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Harmonic, that reminds me.  Your mother asked me to make sure you weren&#39;t <br/>
eating that summoned black bread - that stuff will rot your teeth.  Do you <br/>
still have that Shawl of the Wind Spirit?  Forecasts for today are cold and <br/>
wet, so do bundle up.  Please try to get one helping of foraged veggies a <br/>
day, and remember what she always told you: &quot;A Hymn a day keeps the clerics <br/>
away.&quot;<br/>
