Well, in regards to the last time you ran out of mana...<br/>
<br/>
Once you reach lvl 39 (if you have not already - levels aren&#39;t posted as<br/>
frequently as they used to be), you will run out of mana much more often<br/>
than you may think now, especially with no enchanter while trying to break a<br/>
room.<br/>
<br/>
Bard&#39;s lvl 39 charm song ( Bewitching Bavura) requires a smidge of mana each<br/>
and every time you charm or attempt to charm a mob.  Keep in mind that our<br/>
charm does not last nearly as long as an enchanter or druid charm does.  So<br/>
in an avg fight, charming just one mob to help with crowd control/melee<br/>
purposes, you could lose up to a bubble of mana. And of course, wonderfully<br/>
enough you are on the top of the hate list (just what a bard needs),<br/>
requiring an army of tanks to peel it off you.<br/>
<br/>
Now imagine starting from an entrance to a dungeon, and clearing your entire<br/>
way to a specific room, for example Pool Room or King room in SolB... With a<br/>
full party or one with an enchanter, it wouldn&#39;t be nearly as bad.  One time<br/>
though, it was 3 people, a 40 druid, 40ish ranger and myself (maybe 41 or so<br/>
at the time.)  We were clearing to the Pool room. The druid would use<br/>
grasping roots to put a 3rd mob out of the fight as long as she could, and<br/>
was on heal duties.  The ranger was only melee, and snare duty. I was charm<br/>
and mana song duty ( no melee for me - had my horn out that day). It worked<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
So to answer your question &quot;when was the last time i ran out of mana...&quot;<br/>
not often but it happens...  in rare instances of course.  And after a<br/>
resurrection, because our bard mana regen rate is so poor, we&#39;re out of or<br/>
low on mana for a long time...<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my song, and I&#39;m stickin to it...<br/>
