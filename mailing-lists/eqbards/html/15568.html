<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really applicable to the lord room, but little known fact<br/>
is that if a runner gets away, it will not bring back green<br/>
mobs, even if the greens would normally attack you.  I use<br/>
this, combined with Chain and invis to pull blue mobs past<br/>
hoards of greens all the time.  The Chain is crucial though,<br/>
because you need a head start for the invis to work.  <br/>
Otherwise you&#39;ll get attacked, canceling the invis, and the<br/>
greens will aggro on you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, most people are scared to death of the maze in the live<br/>
side for some reason.  I&#39;ve also consistently found the area<br/>
from the king room to the pool room uncamped - maybe because<br/>
you need either a huge group, or an enchanter/bard/monk to<br/>
split the spawn there.  It&#39;s been my favorite hunting area for<br/>
the last several nights.<br/>

&gt; its been a while since I&#39;d seen quite so many froggies all at once (when<br/>
&gt; they came back with a bunch of friends.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh.  If it&#39;s conceivable that you may have to resort to this,<br/>
make sure your ranger/druid snares everything at the start of<br/>
the fight.  Then you can fear them and they won&#39;t get far.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You need to keep tabs on how your puller is pulling and<br/>
monitor your tracking list.  Frogs you fear in the king room<br/>
only get about as far as the pool room, and you should&#39;ve been<br/>
pulling everything up to there to being with.  If your puller<br/>
keeps you informed of where he&#39;s pulling from, you should know<br/>
before you fear what extra mobs you&#39;re likely to pick up.<br/>
<br/>
Also, fear is not just handy for emergencies.  It can be<br/>
useful if your group just needs a short 10 second breather for<br/>
the healers to heal multiple people who are low.<br/>
