I got about half a bubble last night, which for two hours in Hell#1 seemed<br/>
encouraging at least to me.  If it goes like this the whole way, maybe it<br/>
will be more like Purgatory#1 in Kunark realms.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about loot, but I sure had a good time last night in the<br/>
dreadlands outside Karanor&#39;s Castle.<br/>
<br/>
Myself and a few other folks from my guild who are plodding through hell #45<br/>
were amazed at the relative XP gain we saw there...it was my first time<br/>
really getting down and dirty in Kunark and it was a blast.<br/>
<br/>
I may make it through 45 after all...<br/>
