&gt; the only thing i can think of is that they are used for the wizard&#39;s<br/>
&gt; runescale cloak quest from the temple of sol ro.  when that <br/>
&gt; quest started<br/>
&gt; was when i saw the price jump.  personally, i would go with a <br/>
&gt; cloak of the<br/>
&gt; icebear, it is more AC and has HP which never hurts.  not <br/>
&gt; remarkable, and<br/>
&gt; arguably not better, but considering it is less expensive you <br/>
&gt; can argue for<br/>
&gt; the icebear.  before i got my HBC i did switch out the <br/>
&gt; lizardscale for an<br/>
&gt; icebear.  even though only 1 AC my total went up 3 points.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, weird, I am now seeing the AC for the lizard scale cloak listed as 8<br/>
on two sites...at any rate, it IS cheaper...I will have to get my last 5 dex<br/>
to 100 some ohter way...<br/>
