&quot;Imagine if these new player made silk clothing items also gave a CHR<br/>
bonus.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it that enchanters will be able to enchant the silk armor.<br/>
That is a big rumor, but interesting nonetheless. They just got two new<br/>
spells, Crystalize Mana and Thicken Mana, which make a Vial of CLoudy<br/>
Mana and a Vial of Viscous Mana. As these should not be potions<br/>
(potions are for alchemists), they should be able to be used for<br/>
creating magical armor. I hear that combining the silk gloves with the<br/>
viscous mana and a lightstone makes gloves that give off light. Not<br/>
amazing, but those are just gloves. Still, I think that Enchanters<br/>
should be able to enchant more than just metals for jewelry and if<br/>
these rumors are true it is a step in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
OK, that was very off the topic, and I apologize.<br/>
