<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285072357">This almost sounds like an hold bug, in which the casters in &quot;the tower&quot;<br/>
would nuke nearby players from on-high, due to their proximity to the tower.<br/>
Perhaps this has resurfaced, or it was never actually fixed.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night, I was grouped with a necromancer in MM.  There were only a<br/>
&gt; handful of people in the zone so we decided to pull the mobs <br/>
&gt; back to the<br/>
&gt; zone and fight there.  On one occasion, I pulled two <br/>
&gt; familiars that we were<br/>
&gt; handling just fine.  Out of nowhere, a flouting gargoyle <br/>
&gt; appeared.  None of<br/>
&gt; the other people in the zone were nearby so I know for a fact <br/>
&gt; they didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; lead the gargoyle to us.  At the time the garg appeared, the <br/>
&gt; necro was over<br/>
&gt; 75% health.  In an instant, he got zapped by something and <br/>
&gt; was killed.  He<br/>
&gt; checked his text window to see what zapped him but couldn&#39;t find an<br/>
&gt; explanantion.  Later on, I made a similar pull.  This time I got three<br/>
&gt; familiars by mistake.  They all attacked me so I started to <br/>
&gt; sing Lullaby and<br/>
&gt; put them to sleep.  Once again, out of nowhere, three <br/>
&gt; flouting gargoyles<br/>
&gt; appeared right on top of us.  I was around 60% health at the <br/>
&gt; time.  Before I<br/>
&gt; had a chance to even start running to the zone, I got zapped <br/>
&gt; and was knocked<br/>
&gt; from 60% to dead in one shot.  Like the necro earlier, there <br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t any<br/>
&gt; text messages to indicate I should have taken that much <br/>
&gt; damage in one shot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am inclined to believe that our deaths were a result of a <br/>
&gt; bug, which I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; told sometimes occurs in MM.  First off, the gargs spawned <br/>
&gt; right next to the<br/>
&gt; zone, which I am almost certain shouldn&#39;t have occured.  <br/>
&gt; Everyone in the<br/>
&gt; zone were in their 20s and camping around the lake.  I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know where<br/>
&gt; flouting gargoyles normally spawn, but I would assume nowhere <br/>
&gt; near where<br/>
&gt; everyone was pulling from (the pathway leading to the <br/>
&gt; graveyard).  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think of any reason how the flouting gargs got to the zone <br/>
&gt; except due to a<br/>
&gt; bug.  Second, the text messages did not indicate I got hit by <br/>
&gt; a spell, which<br/>
&gt; could have accounted for losing 60% of my health in one shot. <br/>
&gt;  Even if I did<br/>
&gt; get hit by a spell, the damage that familiars can do in one <br/>
&gt; shot (usually<br/>
&gt; with Force Shock), shouldn&#39;t be over 400 hit points.  I did <br/>
&gt; get hit for<br/>
&gt; physical damage by the gargs but not enough to do 400 hit <br/>
&gt; points of health,<br/>
&gt; which was about what I had when they appeared.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone else had similar deaths in MM? <br/>
