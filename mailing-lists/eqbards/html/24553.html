<br/>
I&#39;d also like to add a &quot;difficulty rating&quot; for each... ie, Lambent would be <br/>
~ 20th, because some items can be soloed for at that level, others can be <br/>
quested for with help from a guild, etc.  Don&#39;t need exact numbers - just a <br/>
ballpark (yes, I know that there are 1st level twinks in full lambent, and <br/>
60th level players without any planar armour - just going for an average, <br/>
thanks!)<br/>
<br/>
And thank you for all the additions!<br/>
