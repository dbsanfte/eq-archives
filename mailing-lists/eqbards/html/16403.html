<div id="ygrps-yiv-760258864">I suspect the same thing will happen with Lullaby (lvl 15 song) if/when<br/>
Verant finally fixes it. Most experienced bards have written it off and<br/>
don&#39;t bother adding it to their song list. Add to that the reputation it has<br/>
gained among non-bards. It seems few consider us a great crowd-control<br/>
class, though a well-placed Charm or Pixie can save the day and turn some<br/>
heads. So if we ever do regain the ability to reliably stop multiple mobs it<br/>
will take a long time to convince the veterans to try it and trust it when<br/>
death is on the line.<br/>

Harmony was not fixed until early final.  Sometime around June.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s likely that he played during beta (where we all learned to do without<br/>
Harmony and a few other spells that were broken/not implemented at the<br/>
time.).  Because of this he may just never have bothered learning it when he<br/>
got the chance in final.  Or he asked friends who played during beta and was<br/>
told &quot;It&#39;s broken, don&#39;t bother&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I myself fell victim to the &#39;beta mentality&#39; and when my ranger had the<br/>
chance to get harmony at 15 never used it until my mid 20&#39;s.... go figure.<br/>
Once I realized it actually worked I was thrilled.  To top all that off most<br/>
of the sites listing spell effects were just cloning older lists made during<br/>
beta.  None reflected that harmony worked correctly (nor what it did) until<br/>
late summer.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of funny.<br/>
