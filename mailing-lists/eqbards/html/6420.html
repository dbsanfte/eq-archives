For one - they resisted my chain but not my binds. Two, when under the<br/>
effect of song - they did not fight back as the party beat them down<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do not see any different in bind at all.  Do u need to play an instrument<br/>
for it to work?  I see chain as working a little bit better being that it<br/>
cannot run away.<br/>
<br/>
I am lvl 35.  My charisma is not that high: 85<br/>
