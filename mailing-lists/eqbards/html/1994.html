<div id="ygrps-yiv-290114000">well it was just me and a 44th level warrior in solusek&#39;s eye B, taking on<br/>
some greater kobolds, and we decided to test which battle songs are most<br/>
effective.  the results were:<br/>
<br/>
once you get to level 36, dump anthem de arms.  we found it to be very<br/>
ineffective, not very fast, and just a bit more STR than the other tests.<br/>
at level 36, stack Chant of Battle and Verses of Celerity, and give your<br/>
group an AC, STR, DEX, and AGI boost, as well as attack speed.<br/>
<br/>
now that we knew anthem sucked at higher levels, the question was at level<br/>
42, to play Berserker Crescendo (which stacks with no other songs) or the<br/>
Chant/Celerity combo.<br/>
it is still a question, some people prefer one over the other.  what we<br/>
could discern was that Berserker made you hit for your max dmg more often,<br/>
along with some increase in attack speed.  it worked really well with my<br/>
warrior&#39;s executioner&#39;s axe, so he could hit for 80+ more often.  but the<br/>
Chant/Celerity combo gives you a bit of everything, including attack speed<br/>
and getting hit less yourself, and we deduced that it would be better for<br/>
duel wielding, while Berserker may be more suited for 2h weps.  If I was to<br/>
equip a brass instrument to double the effects of Berserker, it may make the<br/>
Chant/Celerity combo obsolete, but then i could not get in the fight, and<br/>
where&#39;s the fun in that?<br/>
i will add one other benefit of berserker is that you are only singing one<br/>
battle song instead of stacking two, which gives you the opportunity to play<br/>
a second song more easily.<br/>
<br/>
i would love to hear any comments or further input that anyone has.<br/>
