<div id="ygrps-yiv-180574162">You can, and many people do.  You will need to score an invis-undead from a<br/>
friendly necro, sk, pally or cleric (or even enchanter) to get down there<br/>
though.  Undead see invis.<br/>
<br/>
G&#39;luck!  And remember:  Don&#39;t go through the spiderwebs, and when you go by<br/>
the GIBS hug the right wall so they don&#39;t aggro on you (Gibs see through<br/>
invis-undead sometimes).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Easy, if you have been a good boy and not killed any froggies...OR have<br/>
&gt; &gt; killed a few and have Cinda&#39;s, OR have invis.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gauntlets drop at both the live side and dead side zone and are no drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; (grieves only at the Dead side). I think it is easier to get them at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; live side, just dance right in (bring muffins, milk and bandages in case<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; group you are going to be a parasite upon needs em) and ask nicely if<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; might loot the gauntlets if they don&#39;t need or can&#39;t use them. On both<br/>
&gt; &gt; servers I got them within minutes of arriving.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nope, no live-side issues. Took a swipe at a single froggie that attacked<br/>
&gt; our cleric, he ran and didn&#39;t die while I was in the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How about this in the leaching catagory. The mask of deception, my<br/>
&gt; understanding is that this rots a lot on most servers. I also see a lot of<br/>
&gt; lower level bards with one. When I have 19th level invis song is it<br/>
possible<br/>
&gt; to get to the Assissin room (provided it&#39;s camped) and wait patiently and<br/>
&gt; politly for one to drop?<br/>
