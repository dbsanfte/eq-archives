<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019947445">Right now my 50 necro is up to 56 days played.  Took me 30 to get to 50. My<br/>
shaman has 3 or 4 days now I guess and is 21. A bunch of other chars I have<br/>
probably have 15 days or so total. As for other people I know a bard who has<br/>
literally 170 days played heh. Most people I know though have about 60 or 70<br/>
days played on their main char. As for 2 50&#39;s they are quite commons and I<br/>
know a bunch of people with 3 50&#39;s and a few with 4 even.<br/>

&gt;Alright, I&#39;ve been reading this list for a long time and been playing EQ<br/>
&gt;since about three weeks after release.  It simply blows my mind that anyone<br/>
&gt;could have a 50th Level character, let alone more than one!  I&#39;ve got three<br/>
&gt;characters, each on a different server:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pendor, 12 Level Paladin (4 days, played, my first character ever)<br/>
&gt;Windsinger Legendmaker, 24th Level Bard (22 days Played, favorite)<br/>
&gt;Nona, 7th lvl enchanter (6 hours played, this weekend...grin)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thought this much time played (678 hours) meant I was a complete addict!<br/>
&gt;I just have to know what the play time is on a few &quot;high&quot; (&gt;40) level<br/>
&gt;characters.  Is everybody un-employed, rich, or just way smarter players<br/>
&gt;than I (I sure don&#39;t rule that out...grin)?  I&#39;m not trolling...just bloody<br/>
&gt;well amazed and curious (and obviously jealous).<br/>
