<div id="ygrps-yiv-832471347">I think the mobs in Unrest just hate us.  I can be inside the zone about 30<br/>
minutes before I have a random mob attack me from nowhere, whether I&#39;m<br/>
playing a song or not and no matter which songs I&#39;ve played in the zone.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen this in any other zone, and thankfully they&#39;ve always come when<br/>
we were ready to pull anyway so it saved us some work.  It&#39;s a weird<br/>
phenomenon that I have yet to understand.  If anyone has any clues about<br/>
this I would appreciate it, I hope to be going back there next week to<br/>
tackle the basement.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I&#39;ve read a lot on this list about how badly the critters hate us,<br/>
&gt; never really experienced it till last night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I expected it to come from me healing my group - the way it happened was a<br/>
&gt; bit of a surprise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was showing the group I was with what twisting guardian and protective<br/>
&gt; rythms did for their resistance with a drum, and good god - every greater,<br/>
&gt; db and barbed skele on our side of unrest was making a beeline for ME!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We probably could have handled it had I known the reaction was gonna be<br/>
&gt; like that, and I sure as heck would have run quicker -<br/>
&gt; thankfully, I am the<br/>
&gt; only one that died.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was only affecting my group - these things came from out of<br/>
&gt; NOWHERE - why<br/>
&gt; would this act like such a magnet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway - I think I&#39;m gonna get a really good group together (one that can<br/>
&gt; handle that kind of heat) - and do it purposefully (a little less<br/>
&gt; long) and<br/>
&gt; we won&#39;t need to debate on who the puller is anymore - looks like I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; nominated as bait.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
