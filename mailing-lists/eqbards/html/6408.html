<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-548511128">speaking of fear/chain, i was running to rathe mountains and on my way from<br/>
freeport saw a ranger getting wooped by Dorn... well well well payback time.<br/>
I start pounding away at him with my normal buff songs and he&#39;s doing about<br/>
the same damage as i am than he is to me, well to hell with this, i chain<br/>
him down and fear him, so i took off about half his health using fear, this<br/>
tactic is great against cyclops when ya get a druid to snare it, then fear<br/>
it and just pound away. Its sad when a level 14 npc is pounding the hell out<br/>
of a 31th level pc. I just decided to not take any chances with him. And<br/>
upon zoning into Sro afterwards, i saw terrorantula, but was alone and not<br/>
taking any chances against it, since i would have needed to charm a giant<br/>
against it so it was too dangerous for me and my untrusty ISP.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing kills me more then my connectivity.<br/>

&gt; what a joke.  have you EVER heard from anyone that they think it is cheesy<br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t like you and won&#39;t group with you for doing chain/fear?  the<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; thing i have ever heard is respect for being able to do this, especially<br/>
&gt; from people who watch or group members.  what i have heard is people<br/>
&gt; thinking druids are cheesy for kiting or wizards bastards for<br/>
&gt; kill-stealing.<br/>
&gt; all druids or wizards?  of course not.  but that i have heard from the<br/>
&gt; masses, not one thing about chain/fear.<br/>
