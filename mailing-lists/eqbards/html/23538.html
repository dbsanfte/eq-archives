<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052921856">we started off allying with dwarves/dragons.  now we are giant lovers.  we<br/>
killed their king first of course hehe.  you are right about the imbalance.<br/>
allying with dragons/dwarves has absolutely no reward loot-wise.  killing<br/>
dain/yel is far better.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the entire Velious faction/loot setup is all out of <br/>
&gt; balance.  Seems<br/>
&gt; to me that allying with the giants is far and away the best <br/>
&gt; choice. </span></blockquote></div>
