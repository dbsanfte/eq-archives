<div id="ygrps-yiv-325363877">On the other hand...  go camp the Oger&#39;s in Lake Rathe with some high level<br/>
shaman friends.  Then get a tell from your other friends who are lo to mid<br/>
40&#39;s saying &quot;get your butt over here.&quot;  Make up some flimsy excuse to leave<br/>
your group like &quot;hey gotta go - got a shot at some quest crap!&quot; And then run<br/>
to the Oasis.  When you get there, find that your friends 40ish cleric, sk<br/>
and enchanter are pulling the dw gobs no problem.  Slay a bunch of them.  I<br/>
mean like 20 or more. Loot a helm and scoot for the temple. <br/>
<br/>
TBH - I don&#39;t know how they broke that spawn.  I think they were doing Specs<br/>
and maybe someone else trained some dw&#39;s up to the shore. Prolly hadda mez a<br/>
bunch and they killed em off to break the spawn.  After that - the SK ran in<br/>
to the water and dragged em up one or 2 at a time.<br/>
<br/>
I often see DW pets stuck on the walls behind the ogers (also see em in<br/>
Oasis stuck on rocks) - I wonder if you argo the pet onto you would the DW<br/>
eventually pull.  Like the one in Mistmore? <br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. only other DW pull - a ranger swam into the cave and tried to pull.  He<br/>
went LD.  His pal went down to cast EndureBreathe on him (not realizing that<br/>
you cant cast/heal/buff LD players) and somehow he died - also LD. Oh well -<br/>
back to something safe - killing Ogers.<br/>
