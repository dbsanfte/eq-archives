<div id="ygrps-yiv-749512560">Ouch, now I&#39;ll be afraid to admit I play a welf!  I imagine that many of the<br/>
wankers sending the sleazy stuff are 16 at least in terms of emotional<br/>
maturity if not actual age.  I always thought those welf males looked<br/>
awfully young.  I haven&#39;t had much chance to explore that side of the issue,<br/>
but I have been around a few trolls/ogres that were disgustingly always<br/>
referring to bodily functions.  I tried to ignore it as roleplaying<br/>
atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note I have noticed an increasing trend around gnomes.  They<br/>
sidle up to one of the taller folk from behind, stand right in front of you<br/>
where you cannot see them, and jump.  The first time I saw it I leaped out<br/>
of my chair, which since my hand was on the movement keys caused my<br/>
character to waggle all over for a second as well.  Nothing is as startling<br/>
as seeing a balding gnome flying across your vision arms outstretched going<br/>
&#39;Yeauh!&#39;<br/>

And one of many is enlightened.<br/>
<br/>
OK time for a new wrinkle on the stalker issue, have any of you who play<br/>
female characters noticed a trend in the race of the stalkers?<br/>
<br/>
I mostly group w/ females or guys from my guild. The last night I noticed<br/>
something.  We had two males, a helf & welf, I had never grouped w/ before<br/>
and over the evening, both sent the usual emotes (drool, stares etc) to my<br/>
helf and the other girl helf who later joined us. When the party got split<br/>
up, ne was even sleezy enough to give the &quot;Madman behind you&quot; call while I<br/>
was looting my body, because after his emotes, I faced him to loot.  I<br/>
suspected he was just trying to get me to turn around, so I took my time<br/>
coming out of the loot window.  No madman.  I shifted positions so my back<br/>
was against a wall, started looting, & gave a tell to my 1/2ling niece, that<br/>
I needed help w/ the weirdo & to have the rest of the group hurry back to<br/>
camp.  Bless her short little heart, I hear the rest get back, and her say<br/>
to my peeping tom, that &quot;Don&#39;t look, Antie isn&#39;t for you&quot; and had her Troll<br/>
daughter stand in front of me till I was dressed.<br/>
<br/>
The night before I had grouped w/ 3 guys who I had grouped w/ once or twice<br/>
(all Trolls), and I never had a problem.  In fact I started the friendly<br/>
flirting, when after they told me again how much they liked having a bard in<br/>
the group, that I liked grouping w/ Troll boys cause they are so big and<br/>
strong.  It&#39;s quite a sight to see 3x 12-15th lvl Trolls all blushing &<br/>
looking shyly at their feet.<br/>
<br/>
So I wondered if anyone else has noticed the harrassment following racial<br/>
line?  1) What races did you find to be the worst? 2) What races have you<br/>
spend time around, but not had a problem?<br/>
<br/>
My answers: 1) Welfs/Helfs/Humans (sorry guys!), Hielfs & one particularly<br/>
rude and &quot;grabby&quot; 1/2ling.   2) Trolls (they are evil and not real pretty,<br/>
but real gentlemen), Gnomes and Erudians.<br/>
<br/>
As for this being a Bard issue, well most of the guys I&#39;ve had problems with<br/>
are from the races bards come from (not that I have ever had a problem w/ a<br/>
male bard), but you guys might want to watch what your brothers are doing,<br/>
before they give you a bad name.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As a male (RL), playing a couple of female characters (aside from being<br/>
&gt; fun and amusing) has been educational in an unsettling sort of way.  I<br/>
&gt; was soloing a low-level (6 or 7) female human warrior one night, and for<br/>
&gt; slightly over an hour, every time I turned around (literally), the same<br/>
&gt; male character was following me, hiding behind rocks and trees.  He<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t say anything for about 45 minutes, then started sending suggestive<br/>
&gt; tells to me.  I was being stalked!  And, even in the safety of my own<br/>
&gt; living room, it felt pretty damned creepy.<br/>
