<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546505071">I agree and disagree.  I don&#39;t think we should &quot;Fight&quot; a battle to get<br/>
lullaby to work on level 1 snakes - I think we need to fight to get songs<br/>
that help us.<br/>
<br/>
1) Our friends who&#39;s level let them fight 30- mobs as blues need to take the<br/>
statistics and show they are getting higher resists with higher Charisma.<br/>
Let&#39;s face it - we have good reason to believe that sign is reversed.  Let&#39;s<br/>
help out the people at those levels get a Lullaby that works (or prove us<br/>
wrong - unlike Verant - I&#39;m happy to admit when I&#39;m wrong!)<br/>
<br/>
2) Okay - I&#39;m 48.  I would assume (could be wrong - but make them say<br/>
that) - our &quot;Upgrade&quot; songs should work at least until we are high enough<br/>
level to get the next &quot;Upgrade&quot; song.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to use Pixie strike to get keep a single mob mezzed - and the<br/>
resists are so bad it&#39;s not useful.  Lets DO PIXIE STRIKES ON THOSE LEVEL 1<br/>
MOBS!  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll still see the bad resists...<br/>

<br/>
Well, there it is.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 options. Roll over and die or Fight it. As a bard, I&#39;ve had more<br/>
than my share of dying, so I say we fight it.<br/>
<br/>
So far several issues are unaddressed.<br/>
<br/>
They said it&#39;s &quot;working as intended&quot; but they haven&#39;t told us what intended<br/>
is. We need to press them to find out what the expected resist rates are so<br/>
we can do our own testing. All we know is that the song is supposed to be<br/>
more effective vs mobs below level 30. Let&#39;s hammer that datapoint until we<br/>
can prove to them that they are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing abashi said is that he did a test personally and found that<br/>
resist rates on mobs below 30 conform to GZ&#39;s statement on resist rates. I<br/>
think we need to increase the sample size and prove him wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I propose...<br/>
I&#39;d like everyone to spend 5 minutes in your local newbie area singing<br/>
Lullaby to snakes, bats, rats, decaying skeletons, or whatever level 1<br/>
critter you can find. Log the results and we&#39;ll start a thread to post them<br/>
on. If we all do this every night, we&#39;ll get a huge sample size that will<br/>
acurately show the resist rates. Make sure you post your bard&#39;s level as<br/>
well as the log file.<br/>
<br/>
If we keep the pressure on, perhaps they will realize their error.<br/>
