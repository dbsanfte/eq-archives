&gt;game, platemail is not like it was in our history, it is much lighter and<br/>
&gt;thinner, and allows great flexibility.  I can play a guitar in a kevlar<br/>

This is a common fallacy of those who do not understand the incredible<br/>
construction techniques behind plate mail armour.  Plate mail had to be<br/>
well made, fit to the owner, and easily wearable.  Just as an FYI, my<br/>
roommate has been constructing her own suit of full plate, and after<br/>
several weeks of running around in it, she can indeed chase people down.<br/>
It&#39;s not easy (there certainly SHOULD be a stamina penalty) but it is possible.<br/>
She does still need a Squire to put it on - good thing she&#39;s a Knight ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think the same people who complain about us wearing platemail are the same<br/>
&gt;people who don&#39;t like twisting or juggling.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not true - I believe in the inherent balance behind twisting.  My primary<br/>
complaint against plate is that it doesn&#39;t appear to be in our idiom - but<br/>
that&#39;s for roleplayers.  If you want to roleplay a Battle Bard, put on the<br/>
plate, grab a tomahawk, and hack your way to fitness.  If you want to be<br/>
the Minstrel Bard, then put on lighter stuff, and bash monsters with your lute.<br/>
<br/>
But as Roop says - by all means TWIST!<br/>
