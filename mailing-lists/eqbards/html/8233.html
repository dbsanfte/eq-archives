Wondering where you heard this rumor from?  I read on EQVault that rogues<br/>
and shamans were soon going to lose the ability to wear rubicite but saw<br/>
nothing about bards being included.  This may end up being a moot point if<br/>
the Solusek bard quests give bard unique armor.  I think I would prefer<br/>
doing the quests, no matter how hard, versus camping for rubicite.  <br/>
