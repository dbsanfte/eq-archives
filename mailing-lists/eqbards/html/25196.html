<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795850786">We spent another evening fruitlessly trying to kill Cazic Thule. We keep<br/>
trying to find a strategy to kill him without slow, as now we can never ever<br/>
get slow to land. Does anyone have any hints or tips for this? We think that<br/>
he has not been killed on Xegony since he was buffed up.<br/>
Evening wasn&#39;t a total waste, we cleared the other mobs fairly easy looking<br/>
for epic items. Still waiting for the wiz and chanter mobs to show up.<br/>
