I am a bard on Tarrew Mar Server, Genni is broken on my server as well. Last<br/>
week I petitioned and the gm stated that she was removed for being bugged<br/>
but should be in on yesterdays patch.. but Genni is nowhere to be found..<br/>

&gt;In the server Fenin Ro, Genni is no where to be found. Some player said<br/>
&gt;that its bugged and GM already removed the spawn. I&#39;m surprised that a few<br/>
&gt;of you out there are talking about Genni. Which server are you on? How come<br/>
&gt;the same genni would work in one server but not the other?<br/>
&gt;Without fire opal stone, there&#39;re a few quests that I wanna do but can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;finish.<br/>
