 </span></blockquote>heh, i have a level 52 druid buddy on fennin and we are semi-powerlevelling (sln/chloro only)<br/>
our trio of cleric/monk/enchanter.  but for pure power levelling, it&#39;s tough to beat chloroplast/<br/>
sln/thorns.  and the bonus of powerlevelling with a druid is that your offense/defense/weapons<br/>
skills will all stay maxed as you power level which isn&#39;t the case with some other power levelling<br/>
methods like having a warrior beat up a mob then zone and let the guy getting powerlevelled<br/>
finish it off.</div>
