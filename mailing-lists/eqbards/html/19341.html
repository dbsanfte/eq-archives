<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219758994">Wrong, the server would still make the calculation... your items are <br/>
stored on the server along with your character information.  If you <br/>
stop the client or tamper with the messages sent to the server about <br/>
dropping/trading, the server will make the appropriate corrections.  <br/>
If your items were stored locally, this would be a way of duping, but <br/>
it isn&#39;t the case.<br/>

&gt; &gt;But it is a client side issue... if the client is set to not drop, <br/>
&gt; &gt;the command never gets sent to the server that something is being <br/>
&gt; &gt;dropped.  The client decides the action first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i don&#39;t think it&#39;s that clear that the client decides the action.  <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; server<br/>
&gt; keeps track of all the locations of objects.  the locations of <br/>
objects<br/>
&gt; (other<br/>
&gt; characters and npcs) determines what function is called,<br/>
&gt; drop/trade/give/etc.<br/>
&gt; it would make much more sense to have the whole drop/trade/give/etc <br/>
code<br/>
&gt; on the server side.  in other words the client can just send a<br/>
&gt; mouse_click_happened<br/>
&gt; interrupt along with x/y/z coordinates of the mouse location in the <br/>
window.<br/>
&gt; then the server decides what to do with it.<br/>
