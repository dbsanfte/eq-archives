&gt; Do you remember a recent patch that changed Treeform so druids<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t move while as a tree?  Well hold onto your drums but Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; breaks the tree&#39;s roots, and the lovely druids can start being<br/>
&gt; wandering trees again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not sure if people have mentioned this already, but it sure caused a<br/>
&gt; stir in East Commons when me and my sis were roaming around and I had<br/>
&gt; this big tree chasing after me!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone taking odds that this will get changed in a patch coming soon<br/>
&gt; to a computer near you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and a big hi to Shada, who I saw sitting naked in front of the<br/>
&gt; bank during the auction, as us wood elves seem to have a habit of<br/>
&gt; doing!  Hope you didn&#39;t die somewhere too awful sis!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See ya all<br/>
