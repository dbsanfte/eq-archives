<div id="ygrps-yiv-215000143">It is another factor.  Its called saturation.  It can rain a little for days<br/>
and no one complains that two hours of rain each nite is too much.  Until<br/>
the ground gets saturated and the next days two hours of rain flood 1000<br/>
people out of their homes.  same principle, as a rule we don&#39;t complain<br/>
cause most never played bards in order to be really powerful before, we<br/>
played them because bards are cool.  But dump on us enough or worse, ignore<br/>
a class based on performing for others, and eventually we&#39;ll get riled.  And<br/>
believe me many a political figure has found out there is nothing worse than<br/>
riling someone who uses language for a living!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s odd. Until very very recently this list was populated with<br/>
discussion of how to get the most from the class not complaining about what<br/>
how it was nerfed, broken, ignored, unattended to.<br/>
As the latest patches did not change us radically (SoW/Selos/Root/chain have<br/>
been messed up in different ways forever), it must be some other factor at<br/>
work.<br/>
