<div id="ygrps-yiv-406327527">More uses:<br/>
Crowd control:  Pull mob to the side, chain, fear, chain, go back to<br/>
fighting while the mob wanders around a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Crowd control:  AE Snare (Necro or high level bard) AE Fear<br/>
Beat on 1 while others wander slowly off and then return before they can<br/>
trigger any other nasties<br/>
<br/>
Reduce Downtime:  Snared mob that group is fighting.  Isn&#39;t running, fear,<br/>
beat the sucker to death while he stands there trying to run away.<br/>
<br/>
Save party:  Evac&#39;er needs time to cast:  AE FEAR  gate goes off, no train<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; As for uses, there are two ways I use this.  The first is along with<br/>
&gt; chains--you chain/fear/chain/fear (rinse repeat) while you and/or your<br/>
&gt; party cast and hack at its back.  This only really works in wide-open<br/>
&gt; places, obviously.  The second is as a get-out-of-jail-free card.  When<br/>
&gt; you get stuck in a really bad situation (say you are in a dungeon and no<br/>
&gt; one can get the mobs off the druid/wizzie long enough for them to cast<br/>
&gt; evac), you sing fear, the mobs go flying away, and you have just enough<br/>
&gt; time to affect your escape. </span></blockquote></div>
