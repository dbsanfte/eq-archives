<div id="ygrps-yiv-989803534">I TOTALLY disagree. If you&#39;re getting booted from groups for a tank, then maybe<br/>
you aren&#39;t doing something right, or you are in poorly balanced groups (or poor<br/>
team groups). I have never been booted from a group for any such thing. As soon<br/>
as I log in, I get tells asking me if I&#39;m in a group and if not would I like to<br/>
join? I play roughly 3 hours a night, so maybe that is more than some, and I<br/>
meet alot of people that I think are very good, so it is easy to find friendly<br/>
faces to group with. I can think of another bard on Karana that I know is also<br/>
excellent, and I&#39;m betting she doesn&#39;t have much trouble getting in a group (Kae<br/>
;P).<br/>
<br/>
In my group I tank when needed, and often pull, but the main thing I would guess<br/>
people like is the hymn during battle and particularly during downtime, and<br/>
anthem is also visibly beneficial. If you have a druid in the group, have them<br/>
SOW you, and don&#39;t use selo&#39;s! Clerics and Druids LOVE bards, because you help<br/>
so much with there healing load, particularly in downtime. since we don&#39;t use<br/>
mana, the only time I&#39;m not playing something is when a train is about to roar<br/>
by.<br/>
<br/>
Personally since getting chain at 23rd I use it heavily, as it noticably slows<br/>
the attacking monster. Lullaby is great for when those smaller monsters join in<br/>
the fray. I still use bellow when soloing, but very rarely in group (and I<br/>
almost never solo). Our group effects do so much to enhance the effectiveness of<br/>
the entire gathering, a meager 13 hp damage per bellow seems trivial. (I<br/>
recently moved on to twisting three songs instead of two unless I&#39;m getting<br/>
stunned, and that&#39;s with never less then 270 ms ping, so ping doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
a big deal).<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to take note of bad group members. If you have a sole<br/>
cleric in your group that never heals and uses all his/her mana on smite, while<br/>
you are being beaten to a pulp, do not be so forgiving. That is a TERRIBLE<br/>
cleric. Does the wizard overnuke in the beginning of every single battle then<br/>
scream for heals? Overnuking every battle is a sign of a poor wizard.<br/>
<br/>
One of the keys to enjoyment I have found is that when you make mental note of<br/>
people that work well with you and you like to play with, tell them so, and<br/>
group with them again. Team-oriented players tend to know who other<br/>
team-oriented players are, and they all end up in groups together. There is<br/>
nothing quite so rewarding as making a full level over a few nights with the<br/>
same dozen people and never dying. I consider it quite a feat to not die as a<br/>
bard leveling in the 20s, since mobs hate us so. (I did this at level 23, and I<br/>
sure hope to repeat the trend again).  =]<br/>
