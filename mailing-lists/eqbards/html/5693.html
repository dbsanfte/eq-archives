<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-235968821"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Let me say that kiting is not bad when done <br/>
&gt; properly, when done wrong it it is downright<br/>
&gt; detestable and those people should suffer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nobody would disagree with you there. BUT. Does<br/>
that warrant such changes as those being<br/>
considered at this time by Verant? I believe not.<br/>
Don&#39;t let a few bad people cause grief for 25000<br/>
other people.</div>
