&gt; &gt; in order to be a hybrid, you must be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; combination of 2 classes (thus the term<br/>
&gt; &gt; hybrid).  only SHD, PAL, RNG can be<br/>
&gt; &gt; classified in this way.  you can not name<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 classes that make up cleric, shaman,<br/>
&gt; &gt; druid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pure Caster = Wizard, Magician, Enchanter<br/>
&gt; Pure Fighter = Warrior<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anything else is a hybrid (in my opinion,<br/>
&gt; although Verant does not agree).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A cleric could easily be considered a hybrid<br/>
&gt; of a fighter and a mix of the 3 caster classes.<br/>
&gt; A shaman, even more so a part of the fighting<br/>
&gt; class and perhaps a mix of the enchanter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A cleric is not a pure casting class, nor is<br/>
&gt; a shaman. They can both bind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard is a toss-up, but if it comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; down to it can be classified a hybrid just<br/>
&gt; &gt; by default not being in another category.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With this logic, then you must also agree that<br/>
&gt; a cleric and a shaman are hybrids as they by<br/>
&gt; default do not belong in the pure caster or the<br/>
&gt; pure fighter categories.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are either a caster, a fighter or a mix.<br/>
