<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352746661">Had this problem recently when I&#39;ve been charm kiting Spirocs.  I just spammed the /pet attack key a bunch and the pet will attack.  I&#39;ve also had to use the /pet back off key everytime I recharm, never had to do this with the 27th song.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t figure out why I can&#39;t get this song to work.  I charm the mob (eyes<br/>
glaze over message), give it /pet back off (get message from pet), target a<br/>
mob, hit auto attack, then give /pet attack command (do not get a message<br/>
from pet).  When I follow these steps, the mob just sits there and does<br/>
nothing.  It helps by keeping the mob from attacking us, but I would<br/>
obviously prefer if he attacked what I told him to.  Need someone who has<br/>
experience charming with the 39 charm song to tell me what you do to get<br/>
your pet to attack.  BTW I do not have this problem with the 27 charm song.<br/>
