<b>Subject:</b> A theory on clarity <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710994716">I&#39;ve had the opportunity to play a shaman recently (level 49), and noticed<br/>
that mana/health regens at 6 second (&quot;tick&quot;) intervals.  At first I<br/>
thought Cannibalism to be inefficient, but after discovering this I found<br/>
timing the stand -&gt; cast -&gt; sit pattern between ticks, I could use both<br/>
effectively (med and cann).<br/>
<br/>
I believe clarity (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus) puts a &quot;clarity counter&quot; on<br/>
everyone in the group.  When the tick occurs, the counter is removed and<br/>
additional mana is granted to the holder.  This would explain why it is<br/>
possible to weave one other song in addition to clarity without diluting<br/>
it&#39;s effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about this topic because I don&#39;t like the common ideology<br/>
of &quot;direct mana addition per pulse,&quot; when starting/stopping the song<br/>
doesn&#39;t add anything over simply singing it straight (despite the doubled<br/>
number of pulses).  The big question, of course, is: Will the Cantata of<br/>
Replenishment stack with the Chorus of Clarity?<br/>
