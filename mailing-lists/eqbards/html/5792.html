<div id="ygrps-yiv-918271277">My fellow bards I bring you good news indeed, yesterday late in the evening,<br/>
upon the innoruuk server, Lord Nagafen was lain low! A party of over 50<br/>
mighty heroes had gathered under Lord Thulaaks banner to attempt this mighty<br/>
undertaking. I was there as well, to chronicle the event and slake my<br/>
curiousity. The dragon cursed us well, causing us to be caught in his evil<br/>
trance known as &quot;linkdead&quot;  man ytimes as we made our way to his lair. Many<br/>
a brave hero resisted the curse and fought on senselessly until their wits<br/>
were once again restored to them, and our clerics were busy calling souls<br/>
back from the heavens. My hands and voice trembled so that I could only sing<br/>
one song! Finally  we had overcome the last of the mighty firegiants who<br/>
guard the great beast. At this point lord Thulaak shared his battleplan with<br/>
us.  His thoughts on the matter were sound. Four warriors and a cleric or<br/>
druid were grouped together as a battle unit. A bard was to be grouped with<br/>
the pure casters in the back, to strengthen their will and enable them to<br/>
cast more  often. All those that could bind were to attune themselve to the<br/>
hall. &quot;You will die, and die often, make no mistake on that:&quot; Lord Thulaak<br/>
said. &quot;Your deaths will not be in vain though and the good clerics will<br/>
bring you back again and again till the beast is dead and we are<br/>
victorious!&quot; We cheered him then and formed our battlelines. 4 bards were<br/>
there,  Beirdolf, Aanile, Weindayne, and myself. The dragon heard our<br/>
singing and took instant dislike to my voice, summoning me to his side he<br/>
crushed me with one great blow from his paw... I awoke to Lord Grifters<br/>
gentle voice calling me back to the world of men. I was needed to sing to<br/>
him as many more corpses littered the area. I had missed the dragons death,<br/>
and his corpse was before me! Lord Thulaak gathered us round the beast and<br/>
began to distribute its great wealth. A diamond went to a jeweler of great<br/>
skill, Deelen the monk received a magical box,  and Beridolf &#39;s music will<br/>
now be enhanced forevermore but the drums found within the horde. I was also<br/>
awarded a prize from the horde my friends, the Orb of Tishan was gifted to<br/>
me by Lord Thulaak himself. On my honor I did not expect anything but a<br/>
great tale from this adventure! I feel most fortunate indeed! Join me now in<br/>
raising a glass to toast the death of the dragon!<br/>
