Solusek Goblin (Mage, Priest, Goblin and Champion) all see invisible too.<br/>
<br/>
Another area where you can get the items is in the general area of the High Shaman room( No idea<br/>
how to explain how to get there). It is where i got my boots and Vambraces. Good area if your<br/>
group is too small for the King area.<br/>

&gt; Can you safely get to the area where the Solusek Mage and Champion spawn by<br/>
&gt; singing the Invis song or are there mobs along the path that can See Invis?<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Solusek Mage and champions show up in the area around the<br/>
&gt; &gt; king room.  After you zone into Sol A, pass the lava and go<br/>
&gt; &gt; through the hole in the wall, you&#39;ll come to a T intersection<br/>
&gt; &gt; at the ledge.  If you go straight (off the ledge) there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; &gt; doorway.  Go through that door and follow the right<br/>
&gt; &gt; wall.  There&#39;s one passage that will loop back (ends at a<br/>
&gt; &gt; window above a previous area), but if you skip it and keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; following the right wall, it&#39;ll take you straight to the room<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the Solusek Mage.  The room immediately prior to this,<br/>
&gt; &gt; there&#39;s a door on the left which leads to the king room.  So<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s actually not that bad a place to use as a base and pull<br/>
&gt; &gt; to.<br/>

&quot;...and, carefully following my own infallible formula, I completed the experiment that should<br/>
have resulted in gold. Such was not the case, however. I am therefore forced to conclude that the<br/>
materials purchased from you three days before Michaelmas last were defective and of inferior<br/>
grade.&quot;<br/>
