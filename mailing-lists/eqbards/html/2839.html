<br/>
The problem I&#39;m guessing is high-res mode.  If you are slightly off it<br/>
considers that a drop.  This IMHO is a programming UI design flaw.  They<br/>
should consider this that the area very near the hotkeys - while in high res<br/>
is in fact &quot;ground&quot; (or if a person is nearby opens trade window); if you<br/>
are dropping or trading - Humans are unlikely to want to drop it way off to<br/>
the bottom-left at the edge of their peripheral vision - but in drop (or<br/>
hand-off) things right in front of them.  The UI should be smart enough to<br/>
compensate and not trigger the drop/trade code.  I guess Verant can justify<br/>
this as the possibility of fumbling and dropping a weapon while switching in<br/>
the heat of battle (but if that is the case AGI or DEX or both should<br/>
calculate in on this)....<br/>
<br/>
One thing to keep in mind - you are aiming the POINTER not the item for the<br/>
center of the box.  I think this confusion sometimes (at least for me)<br/>
causes me to drop the item).<br/>
<br/>
Really the best way is to stay in low-res.  I basically NEVER drop items in<br/>
the low res screen...<br/>

&gt; The trick is to use them as hotbuttons, make 4 or 5 (depending on if you<br/>
af<br/>
&gt; a shield i.e second weapon and depending on how much instruments you<br/>
have). </span></blockquote></div>
