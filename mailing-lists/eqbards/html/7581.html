<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-96103696"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How is this for a compromise.  When you respawn you have the <br/>
&gt; current rez effect, plus you only have 10% of your max HPs.<br/>
&gt; Then change the binding rules to allow casters to bind anyone,<br/>
&gt; anywhere (with a yes/no box).  I feel this would balance the<br/>
&gt; risk/reward factor, and make it so people could not <br/>
&gt; use suicide binding tactics when fighting Dragons and such.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d have my vote. That all sounds very reasonable.</div>
