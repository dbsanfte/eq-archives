<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665520113">If I&#39;m understand your message, you are asking where the Knight is? :).  Hehe, wish we knew!  Nice<br/>
train!  As Damaun, another level 51 bard who got wiped out by the same train (summoned as he ran for<br/>
zone) shouted &quot;Kudos to the puller that managed to pull a Mob that summons to zone and live!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We had a discussion last night about the trains in Karnor&#39;s.  Our belief is that most level 50&#39;s grew up<br/>
in overcrowded dungeons where the fine art of a good pull was not necessary and as a result most don&#39;t<br/>
know dirt about pulling successfully.<br/>
<br/>
As for deeper, we&#39;re now discovering a couple of &quot;safe&quot; spots you can go to to get out of train city for<br/>
the most part including the castle wall where the lookouts spawn, the little alcove just inside the<br/>
castle to the left, the captain&#39;s area to the right up the ramp and the two corners by the lake.  Problem<br/>
is that all of these areas can be a challenge to hold, but certainly doable with a single group.<br/>
Whatever you do, don&#39;t swim in the under water tunnel to the right of the castle... Insta-death or<br/>
insta-train (if somehow you manage to make it that far).<br/>

&gt; &quot;Why rude? I didn&#39;t pull that train on you. I was just waiting to meet my<br/>

&gt; deep and get out of train range (if that is even possible), I have no<br/>
&gt; interest in that place.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The level 51 bard barely got resisted by the Knight where as I started<br/>
&gt; &gt; with 8 in a row (I almost never get resisted...).  Don&#39;t know for sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; if the resists were level dependent or if it was because of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; infamous Verant semi-random number generator.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; On an interesting side note, I resisted 2 gravity fluxes that<br/>
&gt; &gt; encounter as well... looks like our cleric took one at full force<br/>
&gt; &gt; though.  I had thought we had a well balanced party (level 51 Troll<br/>
&gt; &gt; warrior, Level 51 Paladin, Level 51 bard, Level 51 druid, Level 51<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric and me, level 50 bard) but we got literally ripped to shreads<br/>
&gt; &gt; incredibly fast.<br/>
