<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662779656">bah ,,,  I&#39;m back to wearing a rawhide tunic now because I was pk&#39;ed by a DE<br/>
wiz last night in HHP ,,, funny how they wait until 4 orcs are beating up on<br/>
me ,,,,<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about going back to full leather instead of banded ,, I&#39;ll<br/>
just keep my armor in the bank until I need it again .....<br/>
<br/>
the weight is killing me,, I only have a str of 80<br/>

<br/>
p.s.  if you are wondering how I got p.k.ed ,, it&#39;s because I am crazy<br/>
enough to play on the pvp server.  NO,,, I&#39;m not a pk ,, I belong to an<br/>
anti-PK guild ,,, I ,, along with most of the other people that play on<br/>
Rallos Zek ,, believe that it is the true RP server ,,,  what is the point<br/>
of dark and light races without a race war??????? and the ability to kill<br/>
each other ,,<br/>
<br/>
when you start out on the pvp server ,, it&#39;s pretty rough ,,  I was killed<br/>
about 20 times before I made lvl 3 and left the newbie zone ,,,,  but ,, it<br/>
gets better ,,, you still get PK&#39;ed ,,, but it adds a little realism to the<br/>
game..<br/>

&gt; Part of that is because some bards (namely ones<br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t read this list *smile*) don&#39;t give our class a very good<br/>
&gt; showing. They may not twist songs, or use their songs effectively. They<br/>
&gt; also may not have good weapons or have weak armor (examples would be a<br/>
&gt; L20 bard still wearing patchwork leather with some banded).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good example My level 9th Bard (with no twinking) is currently wearing 3<br/>
&gt; pieces of banded. a level 20 in PW is ridiculous.<br/>
