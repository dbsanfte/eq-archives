&gt; Personally, I&#39;d consider it an affront if all of a sudden our various<br/>
&gt; excellent *real* instruments; Selo&#39;s Drums, Kelin&#39;s Lute et al, were<br/>
&gt; suddenly relegated by a sword!  I tend to be a bit of a battle Bard,<br/>
&gt; whipping out my claws and Kilij when the opportunity arises, but I&#39;d much<br/>
&gt; rather kill with my songs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	You actually do have a good point there.  I sometimes get too<br/>
engrossed in the &quot;technical&quot; aspects of the game!   Now that I think about<br/>
it, some of the most enjoyable hunts I have participated in are those that I<br/>
sit back and be a bard, just sing, play my instruments and get comments like<br/>
&quot;Damn!  You were doing so much damage I couldn&#39;t taunt him off you!&quot; or<br/>
&quot;Wow!  Look at my resistances!  I am resisting everything cast at me!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
	When I play my bard in a &quot;pure&quot; manner...i.e. no weapons just<br/>
instruments..it is extrememly satisfying.  However, I am not saying give us<br/>
an &quot;uber-weapon&quot; with an &quot;uber-instrument&quot; combined.  A weapon with a &quot;base&quot;<br/>
instrument magnification...for example a &quot;percussion&quot; hammer that does 1hb<br/>
plus same magnification of a hand drum...would allow those who like to be<br/>
battle-bards to wade in with a weapon and still have instrument effects.<br/>
This would not take away from the awesome power of a &quot;Selos Drum of the<br/>
March&quot; at all..since by far the selos drum would be better.<br/>
<br/>
	Just my two copper pieces.</div>
