&gt; two-part question to John Kim and the higher level bards who have been<br/>
&gt; posting on this topic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Did lullaby and pixie work as expected against higher level mobs but then<br/>
&gt; Verant secretly nerfed the two songs to give higher level mobs the second<br/>
&gt; resist chance.  Example: at 30th level, you could consistently pixie strike<br/>
&gt; lizard judicators and they stopped attacking.  New patch goes in, your still<br/>
&gt; 30th level and fighting lizard judicators.  After the patch, you notice that<br/>
&gt; pixie isn&#39;t working like it used to.    <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lullaby always had some mobs immediately attacking you after<br/>
they&#39;d nodded.  The effectiveness of the song has been<br/>
decreased though, whether via increased resist rate or<br/>
tweaking of the level modifiers I don&#39;t know.  I do know that<br/>
when I was about L25, I was able to stop a huge train of about<br/>
15 gnolls in Blackburrow cold.  I&#39;d only get attacked 0-3<br/>
times after every pulse.  I tried it again at L40 with about<br/>
10 gnolls, and I was getting attacked 1-5 times after every<br/>
pulse.  There was a time when I used this song to stop a train<br/>
of 15 ice goblins while my party hacked them to pieces one by<br/>
one.  I&#39;ll try that again at some point, but based on my<br/>
experience in Blackburrow, I doubt the results will be the<br/>
same even at my current level.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) Is it possible that when you started noticing that lullaby and pixie<br/>
&gt; strike didn&#39;t work as well as they used to, the reason for it may be that<br/>
&gt; you were gaining levels and began fighting more often the higher level mobs<br/>
&gt; that get the second resist?  Example: your 30th level and fighting the<br/>
&gt; glyphed mobs in the Mistmoore graveyard.  Pixie strike seems to work as<br/>
&gt; expected.   At 35th level, you move into the courtyard in Mistmoore and<br/>
&gt; start fighting all the ancille mobs.  You notice that mobs are still<br/>
&gt; attacking even though they didn&#39;t resist the song.  You think pixie strike<br/>
&gt; has been secretly nerfed but in fact nothing has changed with the song<br/>
&gt; except the ancille mobs get a second resist check while the glyphed mobs<br/>
&gt; only get one.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the one person who tried it at L28 said he always<br/>
stunned himself (vs. me only succeeding maybe 20% of the<br/>
time).  So I certainly consider this a valid theory.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really want to kill myself a hundred<br/>
times to drop myself back to level 28 to test it.  :-)  So if<br/>
some of you lower level bards could speak up on how well you<br/>
think the song works, it&#39;d be mighty helpful.  My recollection<br/>
is that when I first got the song, except for the rare<br/>
insta-resist (about in-line with the mob breaking out of the<br/>
effect early), if I got the &quot;eyes glaze over&quot; message, the<br/>
song worked.<br/>
<br/>
I have more to say on this, but I&#39;ll save it for another reply<br/>
where it&#39;s more appropriate.<br/>
