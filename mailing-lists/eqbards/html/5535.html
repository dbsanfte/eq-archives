&gt;Selling Swords and Such<br/>
&gt;somewhere on Innoruuk<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s. Roken - this is what I do - punch a decay skelly and then let him<br/>
&gt;follow me around and I pretend like I got a pet :-) (waiting for the lev<br/>
&gt;when we do get real pets - ok ok not real pets but short term charms).<br/>
&gt;Eventually, someone helpful kills him off and I axe - why did u kill my<br/>
&gt;pet??? &lt;hehe&gt;<br/>

Amazes me still how many wizzies n clerics and mana using types wimper for a<br/>
bard when we are in the same zone. I have had them ask if they can just<br/>
group with me til their mana is back..LOL it is so FUN! Just ask Darrien<br/>
about how seductive the song can be..MUAHAHAH :)<br/>
