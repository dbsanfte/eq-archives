  I believe that they said that pets take &quot;2 percent&quot; of a group&#39;s experience, which is more than made up for by the presence of the pet.  But I think this was a seat-of-the-pants guesstimate as to how often a pet would do a majority of the damage (and hence take half the exp).  I think they still get half the exp if they do a majority of the damage.<br/>

  &gt; Could be wrong, but I really do remember a quote as saying pets take no exp,<br/>
  &gt; with no qualifications given.<br/>
