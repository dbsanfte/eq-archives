<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711337931">Just by luck I witnessed this on Veeshan.  Thursday at 2025 EST Hatar<br/>
spawned behind the docks in Oasis, back near the land based pillar.  The<br/>
usual screams of &quot;SG!&quot; rang out, but I had SoW on my troll shaman and it was<br/>
pretty close to the zone anyhow... so I ran over to see where he went.  I<br/>
clicked on him just as everyone started saying &quot;hey... a blue SG...&quot; and saw<br/>
Hatar.  I noted it and thought, wow, nice of him to spawn since we were just<br/>
talking about him and gave it little more thought.<br/>
<br/>
	Saturday at 0230 EST the screams rang out and, being the curious little<br/>
troll that I am, I went to investigate again.  Sure enough, same place, same<br/>
SG: Hatar.  FYI, he&#39;s definitely slower compared to the rest of the SGs when<br/>
running so if you happen upon him and have a decent group you might want to<br/>
give it a shot since even without sow I&#39;m sure run-jump will beat him out in<br/>
a dash for the zone.<br/>
<br/>
	So there, those more inclined to numbers (there may be some other triggers<br/>
to making him spawn - a group was previously hunting SG&#39;s, but they had left<br/>
a good hour before he spawned) and such can camp him until Brad makes you<br/>
yield or die. :P<br/>

PS: Any word if lizardmen are going to be bards?  I mean, we got the scout<br/>
fife as proof they are into instruments...  Ah who am I kidding, I just want<br/>
a troll bard. :)</div>
