&gt; Last week I sent out a request to everyone on the list to send me<br/>
&gt; information on their bard character.  I requested everyone <br/>
&gt; send me a list of<br/>
&gt; their primary stats so I could determine what the average <br/>
&gt; stats were for<br/>
&gt; bard characters.  Also need to know what your race is so I <br/>
&gt; can differentiate<br/>
&gt; the average stats between the three races.  So far the number <br/>
&gt; of responses I<br/>
&gt; have received has been less than encouraging.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unless a majority of you are opposed to using this forum for <br/>
&gt; this type of<br/>
&gt; research, I will continue to periodically post this request <br/>
&gt; until I get<br/>
&gt; enough responses to generate some valid results.  If you are <br/>
&gt; opposed to me<br/>
&gt; using this list for this type of  research, send me a private <br/>
&gt; email.  Also,<br/>
&gt; if you send me your character&#39;s stats, be sure to send them <br/>
&gt; via private<br/>
&gt; email as well. <br/>
