<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676390437">I tried to Chain/Fear Choon the other night at level 31.  My Fear just<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to be taking hold on this guy.  It was like he was out of range<br/>
(no resist message), but he was hitting me for 60s and 70s.  I dutifully<br/>
stood at his feet Screeching while he pummeled me trying to get it to take<br/>
hold.  Screech *finally* worked and he turned and fled.  I had exactly 12<br/>
HPs left at that point, so I decided chasing after him was probably a bad<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
If you try this at 27th, be careful!<br/>

&gt; I also meant to ask this in my last email.........<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can someone give me a good tactic on how I can take Choon/Froon, I hear<br/>
&gt; stuff about Fear/Chains etc but Fear has a really poor range and you have<br/>
&gt; to be within hitting range for it to work, if I get too close to Choon he<br/>
&gt; hits me and interupts my song, am I doing something wrong or is it just a<br/>
&gt; hard trick to pull off?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tried to melee Choon but I barely hit him, maybe I should wait<br/>
&gt; till level<br/>
&gt; 28 so that I may have a chance with my Staff Proc (Chaotic Feedback).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any help/info would be greatly appreciated, and if anyone on Veeshan<br/>
&gt; fancies helping a fellow bard then that would also be appreciated too.<br/>
