&lt;&lt; When soloing I usually stack Jonthans,<br/>
 Anthem and Hymn - sometimes throwing in a bellow or two for good measure. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard the term &quot;twisting&quot; and I believe i even have kinda done it. Like <br/>
when fighting and singing healing and Jonathan&#39;s Warsong each effect stays up <br/>
for a short time and if I click another song at the right time i can _kinda_ <br/>
get both going at once. Is this what you all mean when you talk about singing <br/>
more than one song and are there any tricks to doing this better? Usually my <br/>
&quot;twisting&quot; is more like stumbling :) Frequently my timing isn&#39;t right on <br/>
changing songs..<br/>
