<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-913911316">I&#39;m very close to completing a Paw of Opolla.  This is perhaps the best<br/>
non-Planes item for Clerics, Druids and Shamans (AC 9, STA +5, WIS +9, AGI<br/>
+9, MANA +5, SV DISEASE -5 and CHA -5).  I started the quest a few weeks ago<br/>
before we knew about the Lambent quests :-)  A 50th Wiz on Fennin Ro the<br/>
other night was auctioning for trade a MM Battle Drum.  I told him I was<br/>
close to completing the Paw and he offered to trade TWO sets of MM Battle<br/>
Drums for the completed Paw.  A friend of mine that is familiar with the Wiz<br/>
says that he bought the drums on ebay, I dunno...<br/>
<br/>
What is the consensus?  Is this a fair trade?  Be it known that I&#39;ve camped<br/>
Paw pieces for approximately 25 hours and had to get my baking skill up as<br/>
well (and we bards are the brightest bunch).  At 28th I think that I&#39;m<br/>
approaching the level that I would expect to be able to get a MM Battle Drum<br/>
with my own group.  Is this correct?<br/>

&gt; if you have the mm drum, and you want a full set of rubicite for it...<br/>
&gt; lunacy is a kind way of putting it =P<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hmm, i guess it works the other way too, if you want to give away<br/>
&gt; a full set<br/>
&gt; of rubicite for a mm drum that would be a bit of insanity as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; recent examples...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i was offerred 7000pp and a molten cloak or my rubicite chest<br/>
&gt; alone (really<br/>
&gt; the only good piece of rubicite).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; at the freeport auction, a full set of rubicite WITHOUT the<br/>
&gt; breastplate went<br/>
&gt; for 10000pp and a mithril chest.<br/>
