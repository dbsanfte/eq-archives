discovered an &quot;undisclosed feature.&quot;  Later, I began playing exclusively at<br/>
home, on (essentially) a 33.6 connection, and still had no problem<br/>
&quot;twisting&quot; two songs together.  It DOES take practice, but basically, the<br/>
worse your ping the rougher your timing.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say, every successful Bard I&#39;ve seen twists.  My suggestion to<br/>
you is to practice using whatever buff song you have (probably Anthem or<br/>
the Warsong if you&#39;re solo) and right after you get your message about the<br/>
Anthem, hit the button for the Bellow.  When you see the monster glow, hit<br/>
the button for the Anthem again.  Remember, you have to actually hit it<br/>
twice: once to stop the current song in progress, and once to start a new<br/>
song.  Also remember that your buffing song is more important, so if you<br/>
are stunned or miss a note more than once, switch back to the Anthem (or<br/>
Warsong).<br/>
<br/>
Just some friendly helpful suggestions,<br/>
