<div id="ygrps-yiv-945277959">i agree, i would like the level 30 song working.  i also agrre that yes<br/>
chain is most efficient only when the creature starts to run.  from wherever<br/>
i got my song list many weeks ago, it said it decreases attack speed, though<br/>
i can not say whether this is true or not.  if it is, the obvious benefit<br/>
over binding is that chain is single target.<br/>

&gt; &gt; 	Now I play Anthem, Chain, and another song.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem with this (and I was doing it too) is that Chain <br/>
&gt; just slows<br/>
&gt; the mob&#39;s movement speed from what I can tell, not it&#39;s attack speed<br/>
&gt; like Binding does. And it doesn&#39;t seem to slow the mob&#39;s <br/>
&gt; movement speed<br/>
&gt; that much until the mob is low on hp. It can help keep a very fast mob<br/>
&gt; from rushing back and forth to your casters and healers but other than<br/>
&gt; that it really doesn&#39;t seem that useful in the early phase of combat.<br/>
&gt; Later and for nailing down runners it&#39;s very effective though so I<br/>
&gt; always have it memorized. It can combine well with Screech to <br/>
&gt; chase off<br/>
&gt; some mobs while keeping one slowly running away while you <br/>
&gt; attack it but<br/>
&gt; this is only useful in limited situations (do not ever play fear in<br/>
&gt; lower guk for instance &lt;g&gt;) Now that it&#39;s working, I&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; using chant<br/>
&gt; of flame a bit to see how effective it is. As most of the powerful<br/>
&gt; L39-40 wizard spells are ice based it&#39;s not as useful as chant of cold<br/>
&gt; will be, but if you have a druid in the party it is nice. From what I<br/>
&gt; can tell from testing on myself it seems to do DoT of about 30 as well<br/>
&gt; as lowering fire resist significantly. I&#39;m hoping they fixed the L30<br/>
&gt; song soon so I can see how well that works.<br/>
