<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830630238"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think the summoning rule is different in Velious than Kunark and <br/>
&gt; Old World<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would beg to differ, just because of one of my most spectactular<br/>
deaths--at Vox&#39;s lair, during my first Vox raid.  We had a buggy IG that<br/>
warped most of the way back to her lair, and then started summoning.  I<br/>
had not done melee damage or non-melee damage, or anything...all I was<br/>
singing the entire time since he had been pulled was mana song (I wish<br/>
busy trying to convince a cleric not too leave, so I was too distracted<br/>
to twist).  The first person to be summoned was the bard that had tried<br/>
to mez him (don&#39;t ask me), and then me...<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the resultant death was pretty comical, though...the other bard<br/>
had dragged him back out to one of the pits before he managed to kill<br/>
her, so when he summoned me, he hit me once, and I fell into the<br/>
pit...where I took falling damage, was swiped once by a polar bear, and<br/>
then the IG decided I was too far away and summoned me again and hit me<br/>
once, and you get the picture :)  I /q&#39;d out, but it didn&#39;t save me. <br/>
That goes in my book as my all-time favorite death (well, only because I<br/>
got my res ;P)<br/>
