<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119406368">Man, I hate getting paged in on my day off.  Oh well, here&#39;s the lullaby<br/>
test data from last nite.  I sent it to GZ.  I think it makes it apparent<br/>
there was either a conscious nerf to this song, or an unintentional bug is<br/>
affecting it adversely.<br/>
<br/>
All testing was on mobs lvls 1-3 in the Steamfont newbie zone.<br/>
<br/>
Successful Nods:	574<br/>
Resists:		 29<br/>
Resist %:		  4.8%<br/>
False Nods:		114    	Here the mob attacked a mere 2 seconds after<br/>
nodded!<br/>
False Nod %:	 19.86%	Nearly 20% of NON-resists the song does nothing<br/>
<br/>
The time stamps clearly showed that mobs that were nodded were able to<br/>
attack immediately, despite being nodded, 20% of the time.  This was on mobs<br/>
18+ levels below the bard level.  The resist rate is what one would expect,<br/>
about 5%.  Hopefully GZ will actually look into this.  I sent him the log<br/>
file as well.<br/>
