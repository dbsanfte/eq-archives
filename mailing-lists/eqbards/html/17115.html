 </span></blockquote>Well, you need a new cleric. But I know how hard good groups are to come by,<br/>
and that is easier said than done.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In Sol A it is a big taunt.  If I play Hymn and my two other songs I<br/>
&gt;definitely get the bulk of the attention.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, I could never play it there without it costing me big. The other night<br/>
fighting hill giants I actually used it to taunt the giant off the Enchanter<br/>
(and surprisingly the Monk who would out taunt *me*)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The last 6 times we have had<br/>
&gt;deaths in our Sol A groups, on 5 of them the deaths have gone like this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I spent a lot of time in Sol A around 22-25 I LOVE that place, I rarely<br/>
died, in part because of a warrior who knew how to taunt and a cleric who<br/>
knew not to burn...and they were in the same room IRL so that didn&#39;t hurt.<br/>

Fighting: DDD, CoD, Largos and Anthem,<br/>
Losing: Lullaby for the greens, the Bard is last one out. This worked<br/>
because the cleric healed and the warrior taunted, so if anyone called a<br/>
zone it was because they were in trouble which was baaad news. When I got in<br/>
trouble I just zoned while they kept at it and I would try to sneak back for<br/>
the exp.<br/>
