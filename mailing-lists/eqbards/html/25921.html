<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268262534">Greetings all!<br/>
<br/>
Yea, I still urk around here ;)<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were in Ssra Temple and ran into a<br/>
really wierd thing: Curse of Rah&#39;Vashagah (sp?)<br/>
<br/>
We moved into the right hall and were pulling mobs<br/>
from the water tunnel room.  Then we noticed that<br/>
something was draining our mana!  And then, it would<br/>
not go away!  We were lucky to be in a spot without<br/>
patrollers or respawn.  But we had no mana and no way<br/>
to regen it.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, we heard from friends in another guild<br/>
(thanks Ashen Vendetta!) that if you turn off NPC<br/>
spells and use a &quot;clickie&quot; (jboots, telescope, armor<br/>
item with an effect) your mana bar would refresh.  We<br/>
also had to camp out and come back with NPC spells off<br/>
to block the effect from coming back.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my impression that the curse was hitting thru<br/>
walls due to some bug not feature. Dunno - but if you<br/>
go to Ssra and deleve in deeper - NPC spells off and<br/>
perhaps re-camp to make sure you don&#39;t get cursed and<br/>
mana drained.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s old news - I been lurkin&#39;!~  But I hope<br/>
that helps.<br/>
