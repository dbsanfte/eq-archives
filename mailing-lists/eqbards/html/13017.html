<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687394286"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Get some cha+ gear and people will like you more &lt;kidding&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You mean people out there don&#39;t like me?  &lt;gasp&gt;  That&#39;s a shocker.<br/>
  heh.  I have a no nonsense attitude, and a lot of these 12 yr olds<br/>
  haven&#39;t had proper discipline yet. (even some 45/46 yr olds too) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
  Thus, I become like their parent bossing them around, and they wont<br/>
  hear it...<br/>
<br/>
  /ooc Please don&#39;t stand near that corner house, or you will train<br/>
       stuff out of it while we setup.  We&#39;ll start pulling in a sec.<br/>
       Also please don&#39;t wander around, or hail stuff, stay put in <br/>
       the corner.<br/>
<br/>
  Then I hear:<br/>
<br/>
  &#39;hail a revultant rat&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  [Ranger thinking it looks clear, shoots at it, pulls it home,<br/>
   thank god it was single, still we werent ready]<br/>
<br/>
  Fight the rat, all the way up against the house wall (idiots)<br/>
  boom, boom, boom.... 3 scorn banshees and an abhorant join the<br/>
  fun.<br/>
  <br/>
  Everyone dies. heh. That whip on the rat isn&#39;t that good either<br/>
  to be chasing down rats like that ;p<br/>
<br/>
  Some people just don&#39;t listen.  It&#39;s those people who don&#39;t learn<br/>
  after a mistake that really scare me tho.<br/>
<br/>
  Harm, born to lead.</div>
