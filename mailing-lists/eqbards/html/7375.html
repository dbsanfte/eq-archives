<b>Subject:</b> Re: Accelerando vs Chain breaking root <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-631672219">When in Unrest I was ghoul rooted, I kicked chain up, was able to move BUT <br/>
the root icon was there, when the chain icon faded i tired to kick selo&#39;s up, <br/>
but no go. I was moving at regular walk speed with chain on, and then reg run <br/>
speed when it quit. This still is not the best thing, I would have surely <br/>
died had not the train stopped at a group i passed.<br/>
I do not like not being able to break root, everyone (non bard) i have talked <br/>
to doesnt like it either. Pre-patch I could go into unrest and within 5 <br/>
minutes have a group, invariably I would have to run in to selo the puller, <br/>
or if i was pulling use it to get free. Last night I went in and after <br/>
shoutin that i was seeking a group, 2 groups /tell me wondering if I can <br/>
break root yet, I say no, they both said something to the effect of &quot;Oh, <br/>
well, we&#39;ll get this other guy then&quot;. Aw well, didnt like unrest anyways...<br/>
