<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523532138">My first night as level 20 and I went to HighHold Keep.  Got into a group<br/>
with others ranging to 27 with me the lowest most of the time.  There was an<br/>
enchanter with us for a while and most of the time we had 3 and 4 who could<br/>
tank and cast (Pallidins, Cleric, Warrior mid 20&#39;s all)  <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the mobs (Pickclaws) were all red or deep red to me with an<br/>
occasional yellow.  I noticed that I could only do like 2 and 3 dmg to the<br/>
deep reds (with dragoon dirk and barbed leather whip) and so I decided to<br/>
step back from the melee and equip the drum.  I played Anthem, Guardian and<br/>
tossed in Bellow when able.  I was getting pretty good at keeping the 2 buff<br/>
icons on the screen most of the time.  I really wish Verant would give us<br/>
bards an automatic &quot;have a good exciting fight but kill the monster and win&quot;<br/>
key.  That way I could get pizza and soda during long fights. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Ok, sorry - was just kidding.  My questions are: <br/>
<br/>
Should I have been using Chant instead of Anthem? I tried to compare stats<br/>
one time and they looked real close.  Chant with the drum and Guardian with<br/>
the drum both are enhanced.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like Anthem is not enhanced by an instrument - true or false? (Ok, I<br/>
just checked myself and the chart says &#39;singing&#39; so that means no help from<br/>
any instruments.)  I guess it&#39;s Anthem if you are in the melee - otherwise<br/>
is Chant any better if you are drumming for other songs as well?<br/>
<br/>
Is it a bad idea to use AE songs in High Keep?  For example - could I have<br/>
used Largo&#39;s to slow their attack speeds?  Or would I have met all kinds of<br/>
new monsters from Area Effects? <br/>
<br/>
If a red mob resists the bellow - is it worth it to try again or does one<br/>
resist mean that they will always resist?  Does how badly damaged the mob<br/>
matter?  Say you see a resist in the top half of his health - so wait til<br/>
he&#39;s under 50% hp before trying another?<br/>
<br/>
It was the first (maybe second) time I was in a full party with higher<br/>
levels doing the tanking and we were fighting mobs that were virtually all<br/>
red to me. Half the reds resisted my bellows consistently.  It didn&#39;t seem<br/>
like I was contributing much with pierce for 2 points of damage and taking<br/>
the occasional hit for 32 points of damage. So, I stepped back from the<br/>
melee and played some songs with instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my experience has been with a partner and we both gotta melle.  Or<br/>
me as tank and 2 casters doing the nuking.  Or full party&#39;s but more<br/>
co-level and all but the casters are in the melee because we don&#39;t have<br/>
&#39;real&#39; tanks. So have some fighters with big swords was a new and<br/>
interesting experience. I spent the whole night in a room full of reds when<br/>
I can&#39;t survive a camp of greens &lt;g&gt;<br/>
