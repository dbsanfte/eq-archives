<div id="ygrps-yiv-241969620">The corralary to this one that I use is chain the one dont wanna fight and<br/>
move away with the one you do.  Usefull if you get an &quot;add&quot; while chant<br/>
kiting a single.  Your&#39;s is good for dealing with crowds.  I have fired off<br/>
fear in a couple dungeons in Kunark - pathing gets real wierd and I have<br/>
only done it as last ditch move after evac or zone has been called.<br/>
Outdoors, it prolly works better.<br/>

The one thing you do want to watch for is the &#39;agro accumulation&#39; effect.<br/>
If you start seeing faction messages from stuff that you are not killing,<br/>
beaware that you are getting transferred to other mobs hate lists.<br/>
Sometimes large, spontaneous trains have been created this way.  I harken<br/>
back to the days in Unrest pulling to the wall because we were too low to<br/>
hold rooms in the house.  Zone out every 20-30 minutes was the rule - more<br/>
like superstition.  But it sure seemed like after 45-60 minutes the next<br/>
pull would be a real dooozey!<br/>

&gt; In Kunark if you use AE Fear you can actually fear the mobs so far away<br/>
that they don&#39;t come back.  FUN method of crowd control if a pull gets out<br/>
of hand.  Snare what you&#39;re fighting then fire off Fear.  Everything else<br/>
runs away at mach speed and usually doesn&#39;t come back because it runs<br/>
outside it&#39;s chase radius. </span></blockquote></div>
