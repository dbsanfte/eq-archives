<div id="ygrps-yiv-906097346">I can recount now 10 times this has happened on Povar.<br/>
My theory is thus;  if you are stunned as you leave the zone and are therefor<br/>
spun around you return to the zone you left, the server not having the ability<br/>
to pass the damage from one zone to the next so quickly resolves you can&#39;t move when dead so you must be healthy and you get full health.  However since I know of on time this happened because a Troll was blocking the zone I&#39;m really not sure what causes it.<br/>
<br/>
However on the matter of bugs.. a Minor venting.  I&#39;m REALLY sick of verant&#39;s version of support.  More then that I am fed up with the current guide GM system.  Everytime I pet with a MAJOR problem. I&#39;m not talking kill stealer train here.  I&#39;m talking &quot;Hi can you track me in the zone? Yes Good now come find me can you see me? No I didn&#39;t think so there&#39;s a hole in the world and I fell in it get me the heck outa here&quot; problem.. All I get from a guide is I&#39;ll report it but there&#39;s nothing I can do.. and the GM&#39;s well even if you found one they don&#39;t do squat.  Thanks for letting me vent.. I&#39;m just grumpy I guess I&#39;m tired of all the nerfing they do and all the things that have been taken from us in the name of play balance when it REALLY wasn&#39;t a problem to start with while they leave real bugs laying all over the place.<br/>

&gt; Earlier tongiht I was hunting with a druid friend in Permafrost.  We got in<br/>
&gt; to a bit of trouble so we took off to the zone.  When I hit the zone, I went<br/>
&gt; through the whole<br/>
&gt; LOADING<br/>
&gt; process, but wound up BACK in Permafrost (at the first corner where the 3<br/>
&gt; gobbies spawn) and at almost full health (I went in with less than a<br/>
&gt; bubble, and came back with only 1 bubble gone). I&#39;m not complaining or<br/>
&gt; anything, but has anyone else noticed this or is it just on The Rathe?<br/>
