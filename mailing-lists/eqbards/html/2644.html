<b>Subject:</b> Re: Question about lvl 20 and lvl 21 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-336909369">I think you&#39;re talking about 20 & 23 (Bind & Chain)<br/>
<br/>
Bind is nice, I did notice a change, but I quickly replaced it with chain as<br/>
I nearly am always grouped with an enchanter & I don&#39;t use any AoE&#39;s at all.<br/>
<br/>
Also Chain is awesome for both runner control & pulling.  It&#39;s very rarely<br/>
resisted after the enchanter has Tashan&#39;d the mob (lowered magic resist),<br/>
and unlike root it&#39;s got a known duration of 3 cycles.  The range on chain<br/>
is fairly long so it&#39;s more useful for pulling a target as you can usually<br/>
get a bellow & a buff off before.<br/>
<br/>
At 27th now I use chain in my normal cycles... it&#39;s critical for runner<br/>
control in dungeons & the attack slow downs combined with Alacrity&#39;d &<br/>
Anthem&#39;d warriors is fantastic.<br/>
