&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is lots of debate among programmers about how random the<br/>
&gt;random number generators used in computer programming really are,<br/>
&gt;and the merits and flaws of various methods of generating a random<br/>
&gt;number. If you play Nethack, you will notice the same types of<br/>
&gt;problems with their RNG (random number generator) There is no<br/>
&gt;perfect way of doing this. Just lots of options. Amazingly<br/>
&gt;enough, generating a true random number is not as easy as it<br/>
&gt;sounds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ohh I like this subject :o)<br/>
Actually most random generators will give fairly random numbers (depending on<br/>
what application youre using it for offcause) if you just use em right. The one<br/>
in Standard c (as far as I remember) is based and seeded with a 16bit value..<br/>
The trick, if you dont want to destroy the whiteness (and uniform distribution)<br/>
of this function is to NOT seed it ever again. just let it run its course and<br/>
you will get 2^16 different values which is infact very much random before the<br/>
pattern repeats it self.<br/>
 Now the kind of random numbers you would want in a game should be a uniform<br/>
distribution (Every number has the same proberbility to show up) and it is<br/>
rather simple with sufficient output from the rand function to determine wheter<br/>
this holds true or not.<br/>
 I would guess that the generator used in EQ itself is infact very uniform<br/>
distributed, but when you take a signal with _any_ ditribution and puts it<br/>
through a linear system/function. The output will change towards a gausian<br/>
distribution. With a gausian distribution most numbers will be most likely to<br/>
turn up around the center (if rand&#39;s range is 0 to 1 most numbers will be around<br/>
0.5). I dont think the latter is the case, but I dont know much about games or<br/>
the functions they might use for calculating succes/failure. I just know that<br/>
the standard random generators would give atleast 2^16 uniformly distributed<br/>
numbers before it repeats it self. Since 2^16 numbers are enough for most of<br/>
what I do I havent spent time looking into what happens if you go beyond that. I<br/>
expect that you will start seeing a system in the numbers.<br/>
Humm well if people are interested in Rand functions you should go here:<br/>
