<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945474771">God Im glad I got DAoC as an alternative.. I am having tons of fun and<br/>
havent been online in EQ for weeks and have not ordered SOL (So Out of<br/>
LUCK?), but if DA get boring I proberly will be back.<br/>
Sofar DAoC have been perfect for my limited playtime.. It runs flawlessly on<br/>
my Athlon 600MHz with 256MB ram, SBlive and a 256Kbit ADSL connection.<br/>
Only way DAoC lacks in comparision to EQ is:<br/>
- Graphics they are a bit more dull than EQ IMO... Better in some ways, but<br/>
boring landscape and mobs..<br/>
Well they still update mob models. So there is hope :)<br/>
- Difficualty level. I fear that DA is too easy for my liking, but I guess<br/>
that only time will tell.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would assume dx8.1.  I installed it, no problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My first impression, I&#39;m really disappointed, overall.  I now <br/>
&gt; hate the way I<br/>
&gt; look...and I see no way to change that, guess it&#39;s back to <br/>
&gt; the old models<br/>
&gt; for me, and I so wanted to see everyone on horses.  :(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hate the bard animations.  Like someone said before, way <br/>
&gt; too fast.  Still<br/>
&gt; strumming the drum, too.  I really, really, *REALLY* hate <br/>
&gt; that when I sit, I<br/>
&gt; sit on my knees like a prim little princess...I&#39;m *very* <br/>
&gt; ticked about that.<br/>
&gt; I see most everyone else does as well...it&#39;s fine for the female<br/>
&gt; models...but the male models really do need the indian style <br/>
&gt; sit model back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; According to specs, my machine is sufficient to load most of <br/>
&gt; the new models<br/>
&gt; (15, so it says), as well as the new, hi-res textures.  Well, <br/>
&gt; I hope they<br/>
&gt; make some improvements, or some system tweaks come out, because it was<br/>
&gt; borderline unplayable, when I went with the recommended <br/>
&gt; setup.  Perhaps I<br/>
&gt; just need to defrag my hard drive...don&#39;t know, but nothing <br/>
&gt; else performs<br/>
&gt; that badly.  I actually had times when I was turning, and <br/>
&gt; everything would<br/>
&gt; stop for 7-10 seconds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Load times...load times are rotten, horrid, and unacceptable. <br/>
&gt;  No need to<br/>
&gt; set /afk anymore, just hit a zone line...you&#39;ve got plenty of <br/>
&gt; time to go to<br/>
&gt; the bathroom and freshen your drink.  When I went to quit, <br/>
&gt; from /camp to<br/>
&gt; character select literally took 4 or 5 minutes.  Not seemed <br/>
&gt; like.  Took.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My system?  1.0 Ghz, 256 MB Ram, Geforce 256 DDR, SB Live <br/>
&gt; Xgamer, are the<br/>
&gt; important parts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, maybe I do have to tweak my system.  I believe I still have my TnL<br/>
&gt; disabled, so I&#39;ll try that, as well as playing with the settings and<br/>
&gt; defragging...so I&#39;ll admit, it could be me...but we&#39;ll see.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t been to Luclin yet.  As soon as I realized my songs <br/>
&gt; were messed, I<br/>
&gt; just logged.  It took me from 6pm to 11:30pm to patch.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It can only get better from here...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, which one is it? Do I need directx8.0 or directx8.1? I <br/>
&gt; still do not have<br/>
&gt; SoL yet, but I should have it by weeks end, BUT I want to log <br/>
&gt; onto EQ to<br/>
&gt; check and see if Dain has spawned in Icewell Keep. I&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; waiting for<br/>
&gt; over a week now to see this short little sob and he has yet <br/>
&gt; to show his<br/>
&gt; face. I need him to spawn to complete my 9th Coldain Ring <br/>
&gt; quest. On my way<br/>
&gt; out to work this morning I was going to see if Dain was up, <br/>
&gt; so I tried to<br/>
&gt; log in real fast, but I couldn&#39;t get the patch to start. I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; time to play EQ last night. Yesterday at work, I tore myself <br/>
&gt; away from my<br/>
&gt; work and emailed to my home address DirectX8 and my newest <br/>
&gt; sound and video<br/>
&gt; drivers. I just need to install them now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, so now for my question, is the reason I couldn&#39;t log on <br/>
&gt; this morning<br/>
&gt; because I have not downloaded DirectX yet? If so, which <br/>
&gt; DirectX do I need<br/>
&gt; 8.0 or 8.1?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the help! My gnome warrior thanks you also!<br/>
