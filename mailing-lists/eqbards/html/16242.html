<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629259297">This may be a really dumb question, but how do you keep your back to the<br/>
wall when pulling?  If you&#39;re headed back to your group, your front is to<br/>
them and your back is to the pullee.  What am I missing?<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I remember a while back some bards on this list helpfully <br/>
&gt; described a room<br/>
&gt; &gt;in Sol A to which one could pull safely.  Our guild is <br/>
&gt; planning an outing<br/>
&gt; &gt;there this weekend and I would appreciate some advice on <br/>
&gt; strategies and<br/>
&gt; &gt;locations for hunting there.  We are going to try to take <br/>
&gt; down the predator<br/>
&gt; &gt;as well, would that be within the capability of a full group <br/>
&gt; of 22-29&#39;s?<br/>
&gt; &gt;(avg level 26).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I only ever hunted from the Fur Room (as described in those <br/>
&gt; emails) so I can<br/>
&gt; only talk about that. My technique for pulling was:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go out looking playing Elemental Rhythms, carrying a lute.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a wizard was in the pull I would switch to a drum, for the <br/>
&gt; return trip.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chain to pull, then Back to Elemental for the run back to the room.<br/>
&gt; Elemental during a wizard pull really seemed to save me a lot <br/>
&gt; of damage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very, very often I would get stunned, you just have to breath <br/>
&gt; deep and hope<br/>
&gt; your back is to the wall and wait it out, the Cleric would be <br/>
&gt; waiting for<br/>
&gt; me(gotta love a really diciplined group that trusts each <br/>
&gt; other)...that is<br/>
&gt; where the lute came in, the instant I would get unstunned I <br/>
&gt; would start<br/>
&gt; running and fire up Largo&#39;s Binding or Lull. When I got back <br/>
&gt; to the room,<br/>
&gt; start with CoD, DDD, Binding, Anthem for the tank. or when <br/>
&gt; using weapons<br/>
&gt; Anthem, Elemental, Binding, Lull.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, the main rule is never ever ever let any fire goblin <br/>
&gt; get behind you,<br/>
&gt; they all (er, pretty sure all) backstab huge. Keep your back <br/>
&gt; to the wall at<br/>
&gt; all times. You can&#39;t always help that while pulling, so make <br/>
&gt; sure you are<br/>
&gt; going to have a heal waiting for you.<br/>
