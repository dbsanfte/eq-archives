<div id="ygrps-yiv-166539759"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It&#39;s about 50 hp/tick with a lute at L48 versus mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s more than I can do with my weapons (six-note +<br/>
&gt; Wakizashi), or weapons + CoC without a lute.  The damage from<br/>
&gt; this song is, to put it mildly, outlandish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve actually been dropping Beserker&#39;s for CoD (yes, the level<br/>
&gt; 2 song) if there&#39;s only 1-2 tanks in the party.  Their job is<br/>
&gt; to soak up damage, not dish it out.  Rogues are an exception.<br/>
&gt; I figure the extra damage from CoD (with a lute since I<br/>
&gt; already have it equipped for CoC) provides more benefit than<br/>
&gt; the slowdown with Chain or Binding would.  I still keep Chain<br/>
&gt; loaded for runner control though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Standard songs in AE-capable locations is Hymn + Niv&#39;s + CoC +<br/>
&gt; CoD (you have more leeway with the DoTs since they last 3<br/>
&gt; pulses).  If we&#39;re not taking much damage, I may substitute<br/>
&gt; Beserker&#39;s for Niv&#39;s or Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm..  50HPs a tick is definitely higher than either my average or mean<br/>
damage with Dawnchanser and Ykesha.<br/>
<br/>
So setting aside party buffs for a moment and looking at the songs purely<br/>
from a HP perspective (lute equipped) where &#39;m&#39; is mob and &#39;p&#39; is player<br/>
it&#39;s:<br/>
<br/>
  CoC  +   CoD  +   Niv  +  Hymn  =<br/>
(m-50) + (m-17) + (p+14) + (p+19) =<br/>
<br/>
-67 to m and + 33 to p. (with some estimated numbers)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s definitely non-trivial dmg, but as you know the mobs we fight at our<br/>
level routinely hit even the tanks in excess of 33 dmg.  Hell it&#39;s three to<br/>
five times that.  So while the healing is nice, it&#39;s obviously not a<br/>
substite for someone dressed like a grape.  Although it might let ya solo a<br/>
couple of SKs, that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to try this attack method, however, I&#39;m on analog modem and PII<br/>
400.  Weaving three songs is normally pretty easy, but four leaves<br/>
significant gaps.  In the planes and dragons forget it - two is a struggle.<br/>
Speaking of the planes I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be singing CoD/CoC with a lute up<br/>
there.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The other song I&#39;ve been keeping loaded almost full-time<br/>
&gt; lately is Screech.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This one saved my bacon in Frenzy again last night.  I was in a party of<br/>
three (50 Cleric, 50 Druid and myself) and I was soloing the room.  Honest.<br/>
The Cleric and Druid were maxxed at 50 and they were healing and doing 49%<br/>
dmg to the mobs and letting me solo for experience.  Heck I &quot;solod&quot; a<br/>
Bloodthirsty Ghoul.  Anyhow, a bugged and stuck frog took the long way<br/>
around on one of my pulls and brought about 7 frogs including a wizard.  I&#39;m<br/>
yelling evac before I even get back to the group.  With Screech going and<br/>
frogs running back and forth from me we literally had time to stand there<br/>
and talk about whether or not to attempt them before finally evac&#39;ed.<br/>
<br/>
Do *any* other classes have AE Fear?  I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
