<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050217328">Good idea.  But, you&#39;d probably have to move your camp into the bubble room<br/>
to make this feasible, unless you&#39;re always extremelly ready for the AOF to<br/>
spawn.  This will cut into your potential exp, as will moving into the AOF<br/>
room if you don&#39;t want to risk something spawning on top of you.  I<br/>
typically try to pick areas to squat where the fewest mobs possible will<br/>
attack on spawn.  Bubble room isn&#39;t one of them, a lesson I learned the very<br/>
first time we tried to tackle him.<br/>
<br/>
The idea about the Cleric taking the HT is a good idea also.  Unfortunately,<br/>
Clerics tend to pick guk as their stomping grounds when they&#39;re AOF capable.<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
I was also corrected by my GF (said mage in all my groups) that the message<br/>
you receive is &quot;Not a valid target&quot; when you try to /pet attack the AOF when<br/>
he&#39;s in the bubble.  :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Heh.  I think the preferred method of disposing of harm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; touches is to have a pet eat it.  In Mistmoore, I even managed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to get the cooks to harm touch each other once by charming one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to pull the room.<br/>

&gt; &gt; That is my preferred method usually, but it doesn&#39;t work on the AOF.<br/>
