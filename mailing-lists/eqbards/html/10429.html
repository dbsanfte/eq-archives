<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113642529">The song analysis site says that Jaxan&#39;s does not increase mana<br/>
recovery, and that this was confirmed by Verant... Who confirmed it?<br/>
When? What did they say? Please provide original text and exact names if<br/>
possible, i&#39;d like to put this issue to rest (again).<br/>
