I don&#39;t want to offend you, and I realize that this is an informal email list<br/>
for a game, but damn.  Your message was just plain hard to read.  Could you<br/>
please attempt to use more English words and fewer d00disms?  Some of us are<br/>
old-timers and it&#39;s really hard to read that while squinting through our<br/>
bifocals.<br/>
