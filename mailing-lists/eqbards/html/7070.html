I don&#39;t want to offend you, and I realize that this is an informal email list<br/>
for a game, but damn.  Your message was just plain hard to read.  Could you<br/>
please attempt to use more English words and fewer d00disms?  Some of us are<br/>
old-timers and it&#39;s really hard to read that while squinting through our<br/>
bifocals.<br/>

&gt; kill every thing in sight that cons xp to u. He won&#39;t get much becuz it will<br/>
&gt; be low con to him but you shud rock xp and with his help (or really u<br/>
&gt; helping him kill ez stuffs to him) you should lev up pretty fast - faster<br/>
&gt; than solo I&#39;d say.   Go hammer on Herman the Hermit (South Karana) get xp,<br/>
