<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181028300"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; by definition you can not classify shaman, cleric,<br/>
&gt; or druid as hybrids.  this is not an opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re incorrect. That *is* an opinion.. And it&#39;s not<br/>
one that some people on this list share with you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; SHD, RNG, PAL are hybrids.  the priests are not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why aren&#39;t they? They aren&#39;t pure caster classes and<br/>
they are not pure fighting classes - they do both and<br/>
do both fairly well. What is a priest ability? There<br/>
isn&#39;t one. There&#39;s not &quot;casters, fighters and priests&quot;.<br/>
There are &quot;casters&quot; and there are &quot;fighters&quot; and there<br/>
are a mix of the two.</div>
