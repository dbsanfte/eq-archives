<div id="ygrps-yiv-781265832">Well I  have learned a few survival techniques last night while in the<br/>
hand room in Unrest.  My party consisted of a rogue, myself a ranger and<br/>
three wizzies.  That&#39;s right no healer whatsoever.   Let&#39;s see some of the<br/>
lessons that I learned:<br/>
<br/>
1. I cannot tank unless they are blue and totally asleep.<br/>
2. Green ghouls hit harder and more often than me (Got ambushed by a 5<br/>
ghoul train)<br/>
3. Yes healing song is great.  Gives you reason not to fight and get hit.<br/>
4. The random number generator is horrible.  I am wearing almost a full<br/>
suit of plate and was encumbered, yet I was able to get this message 4<br/>
times in a row &quot;A skeletal monk hits you, but you dodge&quot;<br/>
5. Extra mobs love singers <br/>
<br/>
And finally <br/>
<br/>
6. Don&#39;t ever level when camping in a room or the Festering hag will come<br/>
by to congratulate you =).<br/>
<br/>
That happened to me last night as soon as I got my ding for my level I<br/>
look up and see my health bar drop from 5 bubbles to two bubbles in a<br/>
matter of seconds.  What appeared?  A festering hag coming to congratualte<br/>
me on my level 25.  Was I singing a song? NOpe I was actually doing<br/>
nothing at the time =).<br/>

&gt; here are a few tips passed along to me (usually when the party sees my hp<br/>
&gt; slip under 2 bubs)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;you are about as much of a tank as t.a.f.k.a.Prince is a bouncer&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;you have to learn to stop hitting them and let them beat on the others&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;you have to learn to scrape them onto the real tanks&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;you have to learn to step out of the melee...it&#39;s called &#39;creative<br/>
&gt; chickenology&#39;&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;GET OUT!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and then there is the famous....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;SYLLY WEP!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; which was preceeded by...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;you try to punch a aviak harrier but miss...&quot;<br/>

&gt; 		I would be the first to humbly agree that dying is greatest<br/>
&gt; reason why I<br/>
&gt; 		cannot level.  Even with Verants change to reduce the amount<br/>
&gt; of xp you<br/>
&gt; 		lose when you die, I still lost 1/3 of  a bubble dying to a<br/>
&gt; stupid<br/>
&gt; 		basement train last night.  At least I got my level, though<br/>
&gt; it took at<br/>
&gt; 		least another to earn it back =(.  Perhaps it is time to be<br/>
&gt; less noble<br/>
&gt; 		and more parts chicken.  It seems that I die more often when<br/>
&gt; trying to<br/>
&gt; 		care people, perhaps it would be better to be known as<br/>
&gt; Treilanin the you<br/>
&gt; 		yellow bellied chicken .... Nah I think not =).<br/>
