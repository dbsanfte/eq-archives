I know the drakes cast fire-based spells and the fire resist<br/>
help then, but they were mostly green to me at L16.  The fire<br/>
elementals have a fire shield, and ER didn&#39;t lower the damage<br/>
I took from that.  Nor did ER reduce the damage I took from<br/>
their melee attacks.  In fact, the best strategy I can think<br/>
of for Lavastorm is to have a caster cancel the elementals&#39;<br/>
fire shield (pretty sure this can be done - works on barbed<br/>
bones).  Mobs have so many hp you wind up taking a ridiculous<br/>
amount of damage from the shields alone.<br/>
