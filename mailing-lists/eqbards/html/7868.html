&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have recently begun working on my trade skills (tailoring, brewing,<br/>
&gt;and smithing...I&#39;m a bard, I should trade like one!) and have a<br/>
&gt;question about the new cured silk.  Is the triviality level the same<br/>
&gt;as raw silk/patchwork or is this something new to use instead of the<br/>
&gt;platinum eating studded armor?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know this is off topic, but this is the only place I have access to<br/>
&gt;ask at right now.<br/>

130&#39;s).  So the best route for talioring is Patchwork -&gt; Raw Silk -&gt; Studded <br/>
armor -&gt; Reinforced Armor -&gt; Cured silk.  I am currently on the studded <br/>
armor phase (skill 51).  Tailoring is a pain due to the scarcity of medium <br/>
and high quality pelts/skins and the fact that you need to be a good smith <br/>
or have a friend that is one to progress.  Good luck!<br/>
