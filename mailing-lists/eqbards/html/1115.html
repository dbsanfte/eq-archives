&gt;Hi fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wondering if any of you got any good suggestions for books<br/>
&gt;about Bards that would be Everquest like? And some books about<br/>
&gt;Everquest in general too would be fun to read. I never read a Fantasy<br/>
&gt;book or played a fantasy game (but tons of sci-fi), so I&#39;m new with this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;genre I would like to start with light stuff not too complicated.<br/>
<br/>

This site has tons of recommendations for books, music and games, all<br/>
relating to Bards.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
