<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792214785">Ok charm kiting 101:  (As taught by professor Elfson Allegro of Veenshan)<br/>
<br/>
Put a drum in your hand.<br/>
Make a hot key bank of Selos, Charm, and ???.<br/>
Also make a key for /pet attack and one for /pet sit down<br/>
I used the 6th hot key for /shout &quot;TRAINING multiple cyclops to lake&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fire up Selos and find a cyclops (or mob of your choice).<br/>
<br/>
Charm it, hit or miss it will now start following you.<br/>
Run around (carefully) and find another cyclops or Giant Skeleton.  Wait for<br/>
charm to expire and recharm your pet.  Click on the target monster and hit<br/>
the pet attack key several times.  They should start fighting.  Fire up<br/>
Selos and retarget your pet (hit F1 twice).  Try to fire up charm a bit<br/>
before its going to expire, you cant renew charm, but its nice to have it in<br/>
mid cast when it expires.  Do this while running in circles.  When charm<br/>
resticks the monster should resume fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Notes and variations:<br/>
I use Hymm as my ??? song as you will get hit occasionally.  You could use<br/>
Binding and try to insure that your pet wins the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Cyclops are REALLY good pets as they hit hard and automatically return to<br/>
their former target when they are re charmed.  Not all monsters do this.</div>
