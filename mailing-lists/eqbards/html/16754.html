<div id="ygrps-yiv-317739676">A lot of it is what you had.  I never used a 1hs weapon till level 17 because a friend loaned me an Enameled Black Mace when I started.  At 17th, I started dual wield a dwarven ax and the EBM to work on my 1hs.  I got lucky and won a random for a PGT (had no idea what it was at the time : ).  Since then, I&#39;ve been using a PGT in the on hand and the EBM in the off hand (can anyone tell me a better 1hs or 1hb weapon for off hand for a level 21 songster? :).  I cannot count the number of times the PGT has saved my life.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s really a matter of what weapons you can get ahold of.  What ever you do, get ones that can hit magical creatures.<br/>

&gt; Right now I am using a regular Long Sword.  Not too dramatic..:)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I get dual wield at 17, and that sounds nice but I was wondering<br/>
&gt; what it maxes out at and if its better to get dual wield for 2 1h slashers<br/>
&gt; or to invest in a 2h slasher like a bibs? </span></blockquote></div>
