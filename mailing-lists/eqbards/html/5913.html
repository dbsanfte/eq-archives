<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937942804">PvP zones are areas where other players can attack you, even on a server<br/>
where that is not normally possible.  These zones can be found in Qeynos,<br/>
Freeport, and Arena.  There may be others I am not aware of.  A warning<br/>
message appears when you enter one saying &quot;You have entered a Player vs.<br/>
Palyer zone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You get songs stuck when you hit the button just as your song becomes ready<br/>
again on the client side, but is still unready on the server side from what<br/>
I&#39;ve seen.  The two get confused and suddenly your song is playing<br/>
continuously.  This can be annoying but a continual Bellow is fairly potent<br/>
as I found out by accident.  You can usually unstick your song by rapidly<br/>
starting and stopping another song until it clears.  Getting bashed or<br/>
stunned wil also unstick it, but that is not a recommended method generally.<br/>

I have heard some people on the list serve mention PvP zones what are they?<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a seperate note, I am having the problem where one of my songs will<br/>
<br/>
get stuck on and I can&#39;t turn it off to switch songs. This is very annoying.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t turn off till I zone or camp and come back. Any idea how I can <br/>
prevent this? I think it is a bug or something. Has anyone else had this <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
