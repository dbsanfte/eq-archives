<br/>
I have a warrior that just made 2nd level.  It took me nearly 2 hours of<br/>
killing white rats and drudge skulkers.  I finally made enough money to buy<br/>
a leather tunic (it cost 200, I was getting maybe 3 from the drudges).<br/>
While fighting another drudge, I was attacked by a banderling and killed in<br/>
two hits.  Guess what I lost?  My leather tunic and half of the money that I<br/>
had left.  Suffice to say I wasn&#39;t too thrilled about this.<br/>

&gt; So many people complaining about downtime and exp loss and so on and so <br/>
&gt; forth.. have any of you read what Asheron&#39;s Call is doing?  They don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want <br/>
&gt; to penalize people too harshly with exp so they decided that when you die,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you lose a few of your best items and a percentage of your money.  How&#39;s <br/>
&gt; that for not penalizing people to travel?  You all complain now at what <br/>
&gt; Everquest does.. be grateful that it&#39;s the best game of it&#39;s genre at the <br/>
&gt; moment.  Nothing even comes close to it and I doubt anything will for a <br/>
&gt; while.  Yes, it has its quirks.  And yes, it&#39;s taking a long time to fix <br/>
&gt; them all.  But would you have preferred waiting another year while beta <br/>
&gt; testers worked out all the bugs or enjoy playing the game now and live<br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; the bugs as they get fixed.  The more people are playing the more bugs are<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; found quicker and resolved quicker.  Now, there&#39;s just a matter of<br/>
&gt; priority <br/>
&gt; as to what to fix first.  And quit trying to make every frigging class the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; exact same as the other class.  You want to be able to bind?  Play a damn <br/>
&gt; spell caster.  You want to be able to run fast?  Play a damn bard or<br/>
&gt; shaman <br/>
&gt; or something.  You want to dish out lots of DD?  Play a wizard.  Just quit<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; your whining and be grateful that you can&#39;t do exactly the same thing as <br/>
&gt; every other character in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just so tired of hearing people wanting their characters to be god so <br/>
&gt; they can kill everything in site.. go play Doom and enter god mode if you <br/>
&gt; want to do that and see how much fun it is after a while.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my pipe blowing,<br/>
