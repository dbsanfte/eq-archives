<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070962403">Oh yes indeedy. But it could also be a really cheap way of killing tough <br/>
stuff:<br/>
Fire up Aquatic, hit Selo&#39;s, whack a red mob and leap into Lake Rathe. Then <br/>
you swim down, way way deep, twisting the two songs. Even if the mob&#39;s AI <br/>
tells it to go get some air once it starts taking drowning damage it&#39;ll be <br/>
too deep to make it to the surface.<br/>
Actually... come to think of it I don&#39;t believe you get xp when mobs die of <br/>
&quot;natural causes&quot; IE: NPC&#39;s killing them, drowning and maybe falling.<br/>
Cuz then with safe-fall, we (or those odd, always vicious, monks) could <br/>
drag minos up to the top of the wall in the Gorge and jump off until they <br/>
go splat.<br/>
Ah well, they&#39;ve found a way to defeat all of my cheapness thus far, don&#39;t <br/>
think that&#39;ll change ;)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which: I&#39;m finding Mistmoore to be great as of lvl 21+. I think <br/>
that&#39;s a sweetspot for me right now as my xp is zooming up nicely and it&#39;s <br/>
actually quite fun, regardless of the repetitive nature of what I do there. <br/>
I&#39;m pretty settled in the belief that I need to do that for a few more <br/>
levels until I&#39;m tough enough to wander around Guk and Cazic (sp?). I think <br/>
I&#39;ve been everywhere, but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong: is there anywhere <br/>
else that&#39;s good to us at the lvl 21-24 range sort of thing? I feel I might <br/>
sicken of Mistmoore sometime this week... once I start venturing in beyond <br/>
the graveyard. I&#39;ll die tons, get frustrated and spend another 3 days <br/>
wandering from one end of Norrath to the other, just... being a bard, I <br/>
guess ;)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not too bad, usually, but I just wanna get good xp for the time <br/>
being - I&#39;m really keen on seeing places I barely know. (Happened to wander <br/>
into Nagfen&#39;s yaddayadda (can&#39;t remember the name), in Lavastorm the other <br/>
day (and it&#39;s *not* Najena) but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going there for <br/>
another 2 or 3 months ;) So if anyone knows of an alternate to Mistmoore - <br/>
as a backup for when the tedium starts setting in for me in MM please do <br/>
tell, I&#39;d love to know.<br/>

Speaking of drowing, does anyone else think that certain monsters other <br/>
than<br/>
Aqua-Goblins and such should only have a limited amount of time they can<br/>
spend underwater before they drown? I&#39;ve been chased into water by things<br/>
that have no right being there and really should have drowned before I got<br/>
close</div>
