<div id="ygrps-yiv-88525925">The closest place I know where you could buy a flute is in Rathe Mountains<br/>
from the gypsies. I remember reading on this board that someone who had died<br/>
would just go and kill a lizardmen with their DDD/COD songs and then buy a<br/>
flute.<br/>
<br/>
The other idea that John Kim mentioned a while back(and someone else more<br/>
recently), was that before you go to Cazic, load up on flutes, duel a friend<br/>
in Ogguk and have him kill you, then loot everything except the flutes, so<br/>
that you&#39;d have a storage corpse.<br/>

&gt; Well, I went to Cazic Thule for the first time last<br/>
&gt; night at 3/4 of a bubble to go to get to level 20.  I<br/>
&gt; went because one of my guildmates wanted me to go with<br/>
&gt; him.  We got ourselves bound just inside Ogguk and<br/>
&gt; then proceeded to Cazic.  To make a long story short I<br/>
&gt; now have a whole bub to go to get to 20 and my body is<br/>
&gt; somewhere in the maze.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I want to know is...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where can I buy a wind instrument in Feerrot or Ogguk?<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve already died once on my first attempt at a CR due<br/>
&gt; to the Camo that I had dropping just as a train went<br/>
&gt; by.  I trust my own song more than someone elses<br/>
&gt; spell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
