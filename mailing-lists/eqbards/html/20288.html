<div id="ygrps-yiv-824763472">Actually, I&#39;ve played my ranger from level 1 to level 40 untwinked unhelped<br/>
and mostly solo...<br/>
<br/>
Ranger combat:<br/>
<br/>
Hit Sense heading constantly to max skill<br/>
Make sure you have correct target<br/>
Make sure target stays snared (esp painful if there&#39;s a magician in the grou<br/>
**curses all magicians and their stupid earth pets**)<br/>
Hit Kick when button recycles<br/>
Hit Taunt whenever button recycles (unless there is a warrior in the group)<br/>
Keep an eye on the casters to make sure nothing jumps them.  If it does, run<br/>
over, taunt it away and stick-root it.<br/>
<br/>
No offense guys.  I&#39;ve played 3 bards over 20th level (beta, test and<br/>
release server) (Beta to 30, Test to 51, Release server to 46) and, yes, we<br/>
have a lot of button pushing to do.  But all other hybrids have it just as<br/>
bad, if not worse:<br/>
<br/>
Ranger:<br/>
Taunt<br/>
Kick<br/>
Cast<br/>
Sense heading (for those of us who are just totally nuts)<br/>
Keep track of all mobs in case one goes after a caster.<br/>
Stick - Root as a poor-man&#39;s mez<br/>
Primary puller in any outdoor zone.<br/>
(((Button pressed every 1.5 to 2 seconds)))<br/>
<br/>
Bard:<br/>
Sing, swing<br/>
Sing, swing<br/>
Keep an eye on the casters, charm anything that goes after em.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO:  My bard is a lot less button pushing and less tactically challenged<br/>
during a specific fight.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, however, bards have the most STRATEGIC difficulty of any<br/>
class in the game.  IE:  We have to know exactly what to have memorised in<br/>
any given situation to reach peak effectiveness.  All other classes, for the<br/>
most part, have to memorise basically one set of spells with a small<br/>
&quot;alternative&quot; subset.  Bard song lists change on a area, group makeup, group<br/>
size basis.<br/>
<br/>
Bards are harder but we don&#39;t push any more buttons nor are our jobs any<br/>
more difficult (and in some cases our jobs are downright easy) than other<br/>
classes.<br/>

&gt; They hit a single button ever few rounds, we double hit buttons ever 3<br/>
&gt; seconds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is a HUGE difference (my tertiary character is a monk).  My monk talks<br/>
&gt; all the time in combat, its next to impossible for my bard to talk.<br/>
&gt; Basically I can type 2 words between songs, thats it...<br/>
