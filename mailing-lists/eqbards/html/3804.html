<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143257791">The moment I was able to buy my lute/mandolin (I forget which one I<br/>
currently carry ... one&#39;s cheaper, the other&#39;s lighter, if I remember<br/>
right)...<br/>
<br/>
Where was I?  Oh ... right<br/>
<br/>
The moment I was able to buy my lute/mandolin, I turned into a baker.<br/>
 Running around newbie fields with a stringed instrument has got to<br/>
be the best way to gather up those bat wings and rat ears!<br/>
<br/>
Last night, when I reached a bubble into level 9, I decided to take<br/>
the long trip to Innothule.  I&#39;ve heard that there are some newbie<br/>
monsters there with cool magic armor, and I wanted to see how my<br/>
Heavy Metal Music does in Troll land.<br/>
<br/>
Results were pretty similar, except frogloks are a lot smarter than<br/>
rats and bats -- they actually stay away when they&#39;re hurt, and they<br/>
only come back when they&#39;re half healed.  And running after the damn<br/>
things through swamplands is dangerous for a good-aligned character<br/>
who&#39;s nearest bind point is in Freeport (5 zones away).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I did use that interesting sit-down trick:  The moment a<br/>
monster starts to run away, don&#39;t chase after it.  Sit down.  Part of<br/>
the mob AI seems to think that characters sitting down are easy<br/>
targets.  The moment the mob hits you, you automatically stand up and<br/>
automatically target the attacker.  If you hit auto-attack fast<br/>
enough, you&#39;ll get one or two hits in before the monster starts<br/>
running again.  Repeat ad nauseum.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this is an &quot;exploit&quot; or just plain tactics.<br/>
<br/>
But since you wouldn&#39;t want to waste too much time killing newbie<br/>
lunchmeat, use the dissonance to augment your attacks.  (Hey, I<br/>
actually improved my hand to hand ... skill level 5!!!  WOW!)<br/>
<br/>
Does the lute of the gypsy princess or other loot-stringed items<br/>
actually improve the performance of Dissonance??  And what are all<br/>
those &quot;Box of Lute Strings&quot; for?<br/>
<br/>
