<b>Subject:</b> Soloing out of 30 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819245777">Our recent discussions got me thinking about the rough time before 32 (when<br/>
the world became my oyster *grin*). 31 is easy, join a group at the Giant<br/>
Fort in the Frontier mountains and tell em you have the mana song in your<br/>
pack ready to mem, it will just fly by :o) However before that you have to<br/>
get out of 30, I HATE powerleveling, but in this one case it was way worth<br/>
it. Here is how I solo&#39;d out of Hell_1 without dying once and without a lot<br/>
of trouble:<br/>
<br/>
In Warsliks Woods ((at pos948,pos1514) there is a giant camp with 3 giants.<br/>
You can solo them with CoD/DDD/Largos/Hymn and they are far enough apart<br/>
that you can pick one of them at a time. The rest of the zone is mostly way<br/>
green with a few wandering blues, but I never got into so much trouble that<br/>
running (without zoning) didn&#39;t fix it. I love having the auto-pull effect<br/>
when you go back too, just make sure you approach from the right direction.<br/>
