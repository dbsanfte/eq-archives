<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063736428">Langeseax and dragoon dirk ahve same stats right? so why was one worth<br/>
100 plat when the other was worth 20? (dirk has been going back up<br/>
recently, it seems to be rather rare)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I still remember when a Langeseax (1hs) would go for like 100pp on my server,<br/>
&gt;but today I see them go for like 15pp because they are so common. </span></blockquote></div>
