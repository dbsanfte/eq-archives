<div id="ygrps-yiv-738794917">Excuse my ignorance, where is this guy?  Sorry, I have been woefully<br/>
neglecting and studiously avoiding Karnor&#39;s Castle - train city as the<br/>
morons from our server have moved in from Sol-B.  Last night we were camping<br/>
one side of the front zone and another group was at the other side. They<br/>
over pulled and we watched 6 or more mobs swarm them.  They zone and we<br/>
watch the train begin to reset.  Then this one solo moron fire up her jboots<br/>
and dashes over to have a look see or something.  well, she comes running<br/>
back with the train and we all have to zone. /rude  followed by soanso says,<br/>
&quot;Why rude? I didn&#39;t pull that train on you. I was just waiting to meet my<br/>
group...&quot;  Until I get with my guild in a couple decent groups who can go<br/>
deep and get out of train range (if that is even possible), I have no<br/>
interest in that place.<br/>

&gt; The level 51 bard barely got resisted by the Knight where as I started<br/>
&gt; with 8 in a row (I almost never get resisted...).  Don&#39;t know for sure<br/>
&gt; if the resists were level dependent or if it was because of the<br/>
&gt; infamous Verant semi-random number generator.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On an interesting side note, I resisted 2 gravity fluxes that<br/>
&gt; encounter as well... looks like our cleric took one at full force<br/>
&gt; though.  I had thought we had a well balanced party (level 51 Troll<br/>
&gt; warrior, Level 51 Paladin, Level 51 bard, Level 51 druid, Level 51<br/>
&gt; cleric and me, level 50 bard) but we got literally ripped to shreads<br/>
&gt; incredibly fast. </span></blockquote></div>
