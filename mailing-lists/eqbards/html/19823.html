<div id="ygrps-yiv-150971624">LOL this is good timing on my part.  My guild and another one had a guildwar<br/>
in the Lake Rathe Arena last night so for the first time in weeks I left<br/>
Kunark and returned to Antonica.  Guess its time to head to Qeynos, which I<br/>
haven&#39;t been to in several months of playtime.<br/>

PS  I learned last night that a 38 bard doesn&#39;t fare to well against a 45<br/>
mage in PVP.  I got rid of the pet fairly easily with fear but the mage kept<br/>
resisting my chains and fears all the time.  When I got to 50% health, the<br/>
mage was still at 75% health.  I switched to bellow, bellow and elemental in<br/>
hopes that I could interrupt spells and if a spell did get off, elemental<br/>
would reduce the damage.  That didn&#39;t work out to well either when I got hit<br/>
by back to back DD spells.  My duel against a 37 cleric though was a<br/>
different story.  I won that one fairly easily.  All I did the entire fight<br/>
was chains/fear/bellow.  <br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Patch Message - FABIAN!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Patch Day*<br/>
<br/>
Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The <br/>
Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number <br/>
of changes and additions were made in today&#39;s patch.  Most of the changes <br/>
are in regards to quests:<br/>
<br/>
- The &quot;Fleshy Orb&quot; quest has been completed<br/>
- We&#39;ve received word that &quot;Fabian&quot; has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br/>
- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br/>
- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br/>
- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost <br/>
Circle.<br/>
<br/>
A few items have also been changed this week:<br/>
<br/>
- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br/>
- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a <br/>
short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<br/>
- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when <br/>
you log off (See Below.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br/>
<br/>
We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to <br/>
&quot;spam&quot; other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to <br/>
disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages <br/>
caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out <br/>
spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.<br/>
<br/>
The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the <br/>
targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have <br/>
to stand still to use them now.<br/>
<br/>
*Gunthak Harpoon*<br/>
<br/>
In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon <br/>
&quot;rentable&quot;, meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one <br/>
of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it <br/>
must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats <br/>
on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical <br/>
composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in <br/>
obtaining it.<br/>
<br/>
For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the <br/>
next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect <br/>
weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it <br/>
within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br/>
<br/>
*Chat / Login Process*<br/>
<br/>
The Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning <br/>
that players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of <br/>
people in the chat server.<br/>
