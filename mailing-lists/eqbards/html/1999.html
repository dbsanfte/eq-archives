<div id="ygrps-yiv-48427119">Not braggadocio, just curious as to the earlier complaints of paying more<br/>
than 20pp for a really good weapon.  And frankly, killing orcs for that long<br/>
is way boring and little or no xp at 12th level.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Your group only rakes in 20pp in 2 hrs?  Or is that 20pp each in those 2<br/>
&gt;hrs?  If so then aren&#39;t you spending 20pp each to go get it at 60+ pp?  If<br/>
&gt;not, what are you hunting?  I can make 20pp in 4 hours by myself hunting<br/>
&gt;orcs, with 2 could easily do it in 2hrs.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>er, I believe it would be appropriate to include a discussion of level here.<br/>
It of course looks like<br/>
wanton and inane braggadocio to this 11th level bard *laughs* as would my<br/>
claim of about 3-4 plat<br/>
per hour soloing in Blackburrow (NOT that I think that is great, it&#39;s not a<br/>
competition I have any<br/>
need to enter not being a powergamer type) to a 1st  level bard.<br/>
