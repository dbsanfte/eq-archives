<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025003229">the benchmarks i have seen have all shown Win2K much lower than WinME or<br/>
Win98SE for 3D performance.  the via chipsets are pretty good in both,<br/>
sometimes WinME being slightly better.  this is from 3DMark2000 benchmarks.<br/>

&gt; on Win2k, and <br/>
&gt; which do you feel is better (for gaming): Win2k, WinME, or Win98? </span></blockquote></div>
