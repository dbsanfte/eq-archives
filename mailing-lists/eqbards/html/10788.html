 </span></blockquote>  Staff of Writhing, Runed Falchion, Crystalline Blade, <br/>
  Thullian Claws, and a few more are primary hand only.<br/>
<br/>
  An obs scim is kinda weak ratiowise for a bard, but<br/>
  druids like it a lot.  I&#39;ve never had an obs shard.<br/>
  The silvery axe is good.  It looks like you are set<br/>
  on the staff.  There is a electrum bladed wazikashi,<br/>
  but it&#39;s probably out of your league in obtaining it<br/>
  unless you talk a level 50 druid into camping it for<br/>
  4-8 hours, even then he&#39;ll probably want to twink his<br/>
  own character with it after all that work, assuming<br/>
  some buttonblasting wizard leaves the Caitliff alive.<br/>
<br/>
  You really don&#39;t have many outlets for good weapons<br/>
  until you dual Yks.  Rumor is they will disappear<br/>
  soon, so the chances of getting those is getting<br/>
  slimmer too.  Then again, rumors are just that - rumors.<br/>
<br/>
  My suggestion, stick with your old guns, and beg your<br/>
  favorite druid to assist you in getting EBWs (7/21)<br/>
  One of the best 1hs ratios in the game, better ratio<br/>
  than a Yk, except no proc.  You&#39;ll begin to feel the<br/>
  outshadowing of your melee the closer to 50 you get.<br/>
  While I contribute a hefty amount of dmg, I see the<br/>
  SKs and Pals doing 80-100 per round, and the warriors<br/>
  around 100-150, and the monks 150+ (on a good day)<br/>
<br/>
  What are all the level 40+ people here wielding now?<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
