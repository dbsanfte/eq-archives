<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278518000">I apologize for succumbing to the urge to be brief in my comments.  I can see,<br/>
Sylly, how it sounds like sour grapes.<br/>
<br/>
Menuette did a superb job of making some of the points I hinted at but made so<br/>
vaguely.<br/>
<br/>
Menuette: &quot;The contests are totally without meaning to people who either play<br/>
to have fun or have limited time available to pursue the game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree with you, Sylly, that some enjoy the challenge or the simple<br/>
joy of the experience of an event in EQ.  I also have a great deal of respect<br/>
for everyone who seeks out whatever fun they can :).  That, to me, is what it&#39;s<br/>
about.  So there can be meaning there, but I don&#39;t think that breed is the most<br/>
common one in EQ :).<br/>
<br/>
Meneuette: &quot;The contest is a fanstastic reward for all those who are playing to<br/>
win, and have the time and resources to do so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a game that is difficult to impossible to &#39;win&#39;.  Here is one rare<br/>
event where there are &#39;winners&#39;.  And yet the event is designed so that those<br/>
who are -already- &#39;winning&#39; can win some more.  More reward to the already<br/>
maximally rewarded.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t for a moment say that those like Thott have not earned their rewards. <br/>
I, as co-founder of a guild that is moving towards the end game, understand<br/>
clearly the challenges and sacrifices and brain power required to get to the<br/>
end game in EQ.  So I have the utmost admiration and respect for their<br/>
accomplishments.  I also have some insight, as a member of the community on<br/>
Mithaniel Marr, into how fast Afterlife burns out and through members in<br/>
pursuit of winning EQ.  But now I digress... :)<br/>
<br/>
Menuette: &quot;You also can&#39;t convince me that with those rules it will find the<br/>
better &quot;Bard&quot;.  It will find the Bard with the best in-game resources.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And this is really the core of my discontent with these contests.  I would love<br/>
to see tests of skill and bravery that would reward people who have spent their<br/>
days played, whether they be in the 10s or the 100s, honing all the skills<br/>
available for their class.  And I mean in game, not a con.<br/>
<br/>
Who is the better bard?  Is it the one who has chosen the right songs to whip<br/>
out to save a desperate situation in a group or raid, or the one who has a<br/>
primal weapon?<br/>
<br/>
I think I know Verant&#39;s answer.  And I flat out disagree with it.  You and I<br/>
seem to agree Sylly, that there should be other events.<br/>
<br/>
I am so vehement in my dislike of this one because it is the only game in town,<br/>
and those who are already &#39;winning&#39; the game win here too.  Call me a bleeding<br/>
heart ;).<br/>
