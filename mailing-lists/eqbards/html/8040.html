<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330566895">Hmmm - sometimes the terms get used:<br/>
<br/>
clears the list (when used in a bardic context implies to me that it clears<br/>
off everyone else and leaves bard as numero uno) <br/>
<br/>
erases the list (enchanter&#39;s mem blur totally erases the list)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a true memblur.  But it sure would be nice (hint hint)<br/>
<br/>
But lately I have noticed something else that may be either bug or a<br/>
recently added feature:<br/>
<br/>
I have been KS&#39;ing off some amazing situations. I KS&#39;d a cyclops kill off a<br/>
lev 36 wizard who has just nuked it. I don&#39;t even now how - I think I had<br/>
melee attack on and was hitting it with chains just to see if it would<br/>
resist.  Someone else was doing root and nuke on it  Kaboom it dies.  I get<br/>
the kill - it gives me xp and lets me loot - wtf??? I could not have put<br/>
more than 40 dmg on it.  I may have had either lullaby or chains or perhaps<br/>
Chords running when it died - some sort of DoT as last hit kinda bug?<br/>

		As far as I know, Pixie Strike does not clear the &quot;sh*t<br/>
list&quot; in any manner.<br/>
		If I pixie strike a large rat, as soon as it&#39;s<br/>
un-stunned/un-mezzed, it will<br/>
		bee-line for me.  If there is a memory blur component it is<br/>
_very_ weak.<br/>
<br/>
		My CHA is 104 (still waiting to get another Opalline Earring<br/>
and/or the Veil<br/>
		that increases CHA - perhaps the leather foot raider cap),<br/>
but I could never<br/>
		reliably pixie strike a faerie guard in lesser faydark.<br/>
Often times they<br/>
		would attack me immediately after it&#39;s &quot;eyes glaze over&quot;<br/>
(even though I<br/>
		wasn&#39;t in attack mode).  For that reason, I considered the<br/>
song to be mostly<br/>
		useless - but then again that&#39;s the only time that I&#39;ve used<br/>
it.  Also, I&#39;ve<br/>
		found that MOBs can get off their spell faster than I can<br/>
Pixie Strike them<br/>
		(even if I sing it immediately after they go into cast<br/>
mode).  I used to<br/>
		consider the &quot;rhythm&quot; series to be useless as well, until I<br/>
started using it<br/>
		against Shadowmen and resisted 6 or 7 Fears in a row.  I&#39;ll<br/>
definitely keep<br/>
		playing with it, but I consider it to be overshadowed by<br/>
charm, lullaby,<br/>
		screech, etc.<br/>

		&gt; Pixie Chase does nothing more than stun a creature.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t mesmerize,<br/>

applications as far<br/>
		as<br/>
<br/>
		The mesmerize line of spells has a memory blur component<br/>
that<br/>
		has been weakened lately, and according to my high level<br/>
		enchanter friends doesn&#39;t work on high level mobs.  A stun<br/>
		cannot be broken by an attack.  A mesmerize can.  So Pixie<br/>
		Strike is indeed a mesmerize.<br/>
<br/>
		&gt; I can tell.  I once tried to Pixie + Hymn my way back to<br/>
full health, but<br/>
		&gt; the duration of it seems to be all over the board (as long<br/>
as 10<br/>
		seconds...<br/>
		&gt; as short as 1 second..)<br/>
<br/>
		What&#39;s your charisma?  At 120 charisma against medium blues<br/>
or<br/>
		lower, I&#39;d say it lasts full duration about 80% of the time<br/>
-<br/>
		high enough that I generally weave two other songs with it.<br/>
<br/>
		Against high blues it&#39;s not as effective and tends to last a<br/>
		shorter time - I either just Strike over and over, or mix in<br/>
		one other song.  The resists don&#39;t help either.<br/>
<br/>
		Note that while Strike+Hymn is the only way to make this<br/>
		viable while soloing, just Striking over and over can be<br/>
		valuable in a group when everyone is OOM, low on health, and<br/>
		there&#39;s one mob left to kill.  You can pause it long enough<br/>
		for everyone to get enough mana and hp to kill it<br/>
comfortably.<br/>
<br/>
		I always have this song memorized, even when grouped with an<br/>
		enchanter (they can go linkdead, or get a mob attacking them<br/>
		to where they can&#39;t mes anything much less the three other<br/>
		mobs the rest of you are fighting).  This song gives you<br/>
		something no other song does - time.<br/>
