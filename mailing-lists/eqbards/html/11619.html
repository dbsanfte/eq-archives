I have had a lot of recent success getting lambent stones in North Karana.<br/>
I think you have a better chance of finding higher level people to group<br/>
with in NK compared to N/S Ro and Oasis.  Also, both HGs and griffons will<br/>
drop them in NK versus just SGs in N/S Ro and Oasis.  <br/>

&gt; I have a problem with obtaining lambent stones.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m running around NRo/Oasis/SRo regularly now and shouting out for<br/>
&gt; lambent<br/>
&gt; stones assuming people will be cool and just give them to the poor bard<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; needs them for his armor quest like most people do with all the rest of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; no-drop quest components for all the other classes.  I assumed wrong.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This may be just on E&#39;ci, but greedy people are seriously trying to cash<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; on lambent stones.  I got a few answers to my requests for stones, but the<br/>
&gt; cheapest anyone was willing to give me one for was 20pp with some morons<br/>
&gt; saying they sell for 100-200pp each.  I agree with others on this list who<br/>
&gt; refuse to pay for the stones for various reasons.  I have spent over<br/>
&gt; 1000pp<br/>
&gt; purchasing gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc etc) and I am not going to<br/>
&gt; hand<br/>
&gt; some greedy bugger more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soooo, I am now camping SG&#39;s in oasis every opportunity I can but I killed<br/>
&gt; 4<br/>
&gt; last night and did not find a single one.  I am joining pickup groups for<br/>
&gt; the purpose of giant hunting and I often have to convince my group members<br/>
&gt; that they should let me loot a stone should we find one.  I just don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I still need about 7 lambent stones total for the rest of my armor and I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; certainly not willing to pay another 200-1000pp to obtain them, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; have that kind of money anymore after buying the other components.  But I<br/>
&gt; have been looking for my next stone for 4 in-game days now and have killed<br/>
&gt; 5<br/>
&gt; giants and am still empty-handed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations apart from soloing in<br/>
&gt; the Rathe mts and charming giants to kill each other?<br/>
