I have seen the Langseax go for 15pp on Bertoxx also..have even heard of<br/>
people giving them away because they have so many.  1600 people on at peak<br/>
times..how many Warriors or Warrior twinks on the server?  At this rate the<br/>
Langseax is going to be virtually worthless in a short time..so something<br/>
needs to be done to take items out of the game.  I think decay over time is<br/>
a good idea.  I play a Warrior as well as a Bard and I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing<br/>
a repair skill added to fix weapons, armor, etc..<br/>
<br/>
A short term fix to reduce the number of Langseax would be to put a switch<br/>
in.  Have a Frostbite for the Langseax and a &#39;Frostbitten&#39; (sorry its early)<br/>
in another area for the Langseax of the Wolves.  Obviously you wouldn&#39;t get<br/>
Paglan&#39;s head every time in this scenario.<br/>

&gt; Well I dont have any perfect sollution to the degradiation of worth. Which<br/>
takes<br/>
&gt; me to another interesting issue in EQ. Namely the worth of equipment and<br/>
money.<br/>
&gt; I still remember when a Langeseax (1hs) would go for like 100pp on my<br/>
server,<br/>
&gt; but today I see them go for like 15pp because they are so common. This<br/>
goes for<br/>
&gt; allmost all equipment. There is NO real outlet as other have mentioned.<br/>
Once an<br/>
&gt; item is in the game it stays there.<br/>
&gt; I think the only viable way to get items out of circulation is to make<br/>
them wear<br/>
&gt; out. If its possible to mend them it should be done by NPC&#39;s and be priced<br/>
upon<br/>
&gt; what &quot;level&quot; of equipment we are talking about and price comparable with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; indgrediants casters use. In a way so that the expences per played hour is<br/>
&gt; around the same.<br/>
&gt; As it is today melee classes havent got any expenses other than food and<br/>
initial<br/>
&gt; costs of equipment.<br/>
