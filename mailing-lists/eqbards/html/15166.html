<div id="ygrps-yiv-824939241">Klug - I think only 3 attempts is not enough data to form a statistical<br/>
sample - you may want to try this on several more occasions before deciding<br/>
that a rate of 75 pct resistance.<br/>
<br/>

you find an even higher resistance rate when used for &quot;nap time&quot; as opposed<br/>
to &quot;sleep time&quot;...<br/>
