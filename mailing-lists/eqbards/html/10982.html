<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973764595"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You can&#39;t put level limits on items, it&#39;s silly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If somone really wants a high level item and they are willing to save up<br/>
&gt; for it then let me, just because people are twinkers doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
&gt; genuine low level people have to be affected.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s the thing, Verant has acknowledged that the process&#39; on <br/>
  weapons need level restrictions.  If they didn&#39;t care about a<br/>
  L6 noob wielding a Staff of Writhing, why did they limit the <br/>
  proc so that you need to be in your high 20s for it to work.<br/>
  Answer: It&#39;s unbalancing to have a L6 do 48 dmg to a monster<br/>
  when monsters at L6 fighting level only have less than a few<br/>
  hundred hitpoints.<br/>
<br/>
  Level restrictions don&#39;t make sense in reality, as in the<br/>
  example given.  However... I wish they would tie weapons<br/>
  to skill.  If your 1 hand slashing isn&#39;t greater than 100<br/>
  then you fail to wield the sword correctly.  Or you just <br/>
  dont have the knowledge/practice to use the sword.  Now<br/>
  that is more realistic, yet it still ties to level restrictions<br/>
  since your skill is based on level.  I was for weapon/armor<br/>
  skill restrictions.  It would eliminate a lot of grief from<br/>
  hard working characters.  If a level 50 twinks because they<br/>
  are bored and they camped suchandsuch, then Verant needs to<br/>
  address that issue separately.  Lack of things to do at 35+<br/>
  is becoming very apparent, and overcrowding is forcing people<br/>
  to twink up lower level characters who can fight with ease<br/>
  in a uncrowded lower level zones.  There are plenty of druids<br/>
  out there who are L30 - L40 who still use a combine scimitar.<br/>
  And the fact that a L50 wizard will sit there and camp the<br/>
  foreman (because he&#39;s bored) to twink his L12 druid, thus<br/>
  blocking druids who need an obsidian scimitar for their <br/>
  primary still bothers me.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t want this thread to blow up into some heated debate.<br/>
  Clearly there are two sides to this, and there will always be.<br/>
  My druid has L40 equipment, but not one piece have I sat and<br/>
  camped, I just ran across them and collected things.  My beef<br/>
  is with higher level characters actually camping X item or<br/>
  X quest because it will yield them profit or give them something<br/>
  to hand their L5 noob.  Rangers are extremely notorious for<br/>
  doing this, as they often track down rares and try to profit <br/>
  from the kill.  <br/>
<br/>
  But last night after a server restart, who got to Bildge FarFathom<br/>
  first... hubba hubba hubba, who do you love?   Me?  I&#39;m giving <br/>
  away free reed belts.... And where oh where is the Ranger?  He&#39;s at<br/>
  home washing his tights!   bahaha... silly ranger tried to KS<br/>
  me too.  Three words: Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, &#39;hey, those are my balloons&#39;</div>
