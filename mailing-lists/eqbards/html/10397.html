&gt; <br/>
&gt; i was curious.  i have been thinking more about this lately.  do all the<br/>
&gt; pure caster classes have their casting skills (e.g. evocation) max out at<br/>
&gt; 255?  along these lines, what skill caps do the priests (shaman, cleric,<br/>
&gt; druid) and hybrids (ranger, shadow knight, paladin) have?  i am almost<br/>
&gt; positive the pure casters max at 255, but i am not sure on the other casting<br/>
&gt; classes.  and in our petition, was anything mentioned about our four song<br/>
&gt; skills capping at 255 instead of 200?  i can easily understand that they<br/>
&gt; should in fact cap at 200, was just wondering what everyone else thought,<br/>
&gt; and if it was mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was particularly annoyed at this too, and, I think it&#39;s the main<br/>
reason we miss so many notes on our 40+ songs.  I have a feeling the<br/>
code tests against Level x 5 + 5 for the skill check and doesn&#39;t make<br/>
allowances for the skill cap. It seems the logical explanation for why<br/>
our 40+ songs are so hard to start.<br/>
