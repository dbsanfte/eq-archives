<div id="ygrps-yiv-357159296">depends on the area Halana... I know in closed quarters I&#39;d rather pull out<br/>
my lower level necro then to use my bard, my bard got ganked 2-3 times<br/>
getting my prod for HS key just cause I got lost on the way out of the maze<br/>
(dumb dumb) and I couldnt go toe to toe with him or pull him out of the maze<br/>
properly either, really irritating.  After much aggravation I logged in my<br/>
necro and went after him. The pet kept the whole room empty without losing<br/>
any hp, when the named spawned I unloaded all my mana on it as I wanted<br/>
payback for the aggravation he&#39;d given me.  I also had alot of fun there<br/>
though with Antic (ya remember him dont ya) pulling as many as I could and<br/>
He&#39;d AE them, that was truly fun.<br/>
<br/>
But on a soloing front, I&#39;d say outdoors bards are great, indoors I&#39;d rather<br/>
not even think about it untill I have more AC or my epic or something.<br/>

Hmm well I can see your point, and  probably haven&#39;t noticed it because I<br/>
haven&#39;t been on many raids with my bard.  But the shammy getting exp on<br/>
raids? *dies laughing*<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to see is raid platinum distribution myself.  In a month<br/>
of guild hunts, I&#39;ve not seen a single pp... yet those rogues and rangers<br/>
&quot;give it all to the guild&quot; - yeah, right.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone tells me that bards are bad at soloing, and that shaman are the<br/>
best.  I can solo 10 times better with my bard.  Personally, I think its<br/>
because people are very poor at picking out &quot;soloable&quot; areas and mobs.<br/>
What a shaman can solo, a mage will crumple on, etc.  I guess I tend to look<br/>
at things like how long actual downtime is, the ability to handle multiple<br/>
mobs and play with a variety of classees rather than just damage dealing.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda funny how things are on other servers and other guilds, SK&#39;s are like<br/>
the joke of our guild.  We have 1 SK and 1 Paladin lol!  <br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t really agree. We are fairly weak at soloing and not very good<br/>
&gt; damage dealers in groups. More over, we are weak in raids. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with Aftathott on this one. Verant did a very good <br/>
&gt; job balancing<br/>
&gt; Bards in solo and group situations. But we are far less <br/>
&gt; valuable in raid<br/>
&gt; situations.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Raids are one area VI should definitely spend some time on before<br/>
&gt; releasing Luclin. I hope they address XP in raids, class <br/>
&gt; balance in raids<br/>
&gt; and communication (chat) in raids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More and more of the game is around raids where the top <br/>
&gt; Warrior, Rogue,<br/>
&gt; Shammy, Chanter and Cleric take the XP. The 6th spot is very <br/>
&gt; likely a Monk<br/>
&gt; for pulling, but mages, wizzies and SKs are all more <br/>
&gt; preferred than Bards.<br/>

&gt; Ugh....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Its funny... the more I play my bard and the higher she gets, I find<br/>
&gt; myself<br/>
&gt; sometimes not telling people everything I can do, kind of <br/>
&gt; keeping a low<br/>
&gt; profile, hoping that they don&#39;t notice. Seriously, don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; laugh, its just<br/>
&gt; that bards seem very overpowered to me at higher levels, then again 60<br/>
&gt; shaman with Can IV.... I used to think all level 60 were <br/>
&gt; equally powerful<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m changing my thoughts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope nobody else figures this out!<br/>
