extraordinarily lucky.  My friends and I were there for<br/>
several days a couple weeks ago sweeping the lower level parts<br/>
of the dungeon.  We got... 5 circlets and zero morningstars.<br/>
Some other people who were there trying to get a morningstar<br/>
were auctioning circlets because all their casters already had<br/>
one.<br/>
