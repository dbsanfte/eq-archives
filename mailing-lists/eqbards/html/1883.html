attack speed) is that it&#39;s area effect.  Lately I haven&#39;t been<br/>
fighting many mobs that are all by their lonesome.  Usually<br/>
there are several green things nearby or wandering around.<br/>
Play binding and they will become aggresive to you.  Also, the<br/>
few times that I *do* want to use an area effect song, I<br/>
almost always hit Lullaby.  Why slow down their attack speed<br/>
when you can stop their attacks almost entirely.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, has anybody tried timing how long the Binding<br/>
effect lasts?  Is it something you need to keep twisting, or<br/>
is just hitting it once at the beginning of a fight enough?<br/>

&gt; it is nowhere near as boring as kiting is. Imagine running around from<br/>
&gt; anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes with a mob on your tail, not being able to<br/>
&gt; talk to anyone or risk a fair amount to type in tells, just pounding the<br/>
&gt; Bellow and Accelerando hot keys.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  I&#39;ve kited a few times and I agree entirely.  It is<br/>
mind-numbingly boring.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there a less dangerous brass song that I can use later to<br/>
work on my brass skill?  I still don&#39;t like the idea of<br/>
leaving myself playing Discord overnight in some remote<br/>
location to work on the skill.<br/>
