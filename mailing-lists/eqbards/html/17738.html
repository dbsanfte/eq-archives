<div id="ygrps-yiv-554593288">The rules for this fight are a bit more complicated, If this is the one I&#39;m<br/>
thinking about.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s near the chessboard, and the fighting &quot;arena&quot; is just off the side of<br/>
the chessboard, with a 2 min-5 min??  timer.  So the long, dragging fights<br/>
that bards are good at aren&#39;t really possible :(<br/>
<br/>
So basically, bards are pretty much out of luck against anything other than<br/>
pure casters.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ???!!!  And your level 11?  This looks like a job for the dynamic duo of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rokenn & John Kim!  (Didn&#39;t at least one of say you like being presented<br/>
&gt; &gt; with challenges that cause you to find new ways of playing a character?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In truth, if the mage were level 11 I&#39;d still place bets against you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry.  They&#39;ve got some pretty good pets.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t have many tools at level 11.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s an anything-goes fight (which I&#39;d assume it is if a<br/>
&gt; level 15 is fighting a level 11), I would kick in Accel, wait<br/>
&gt; for him to order his pet to attack me, then quickly drag the<br/>
&gt; pet out of command range and through a bunch of hostile mobs<br/>
&gt; (arc your path so you don&#39;t go through the mobs but the pet<br/>
&gt; does).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t want to be quite so dirty, I&#39;d drag the pet away,<br/>
&gt; run back and attack the mage, drag the pet away again when it<br/>
&gt; returns, repeat.  You can use Warsong and melee to hope to<br/>
&gt; interrupt his casting, or Accel to try to get out of range<br/>
&gt; before his spell fires (note that neither consumes mana, so<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d be relying on fizzles to deplete his mana).  And if the<br/>
&gt; pet roots you...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The key I think is that you can stay out of attack range and<br/>
&gt; heal indefinitely, while he cannot (gotta run out of bandages<br/>
&gt; some time).<br/>
