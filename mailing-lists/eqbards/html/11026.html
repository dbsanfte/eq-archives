&gt;Hey, levitate for all classes is broken.  Stop being so paranoid that <br/>
&gt;Verant hates your class only.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ummm actually, no, sorry.  Levitate is only broken for people who need to <br/>
refresh it constantly to use it.  Other classes are now limited to their 5 <br/>
or 10 or 20 minute duration, whatever the case.  Bards are now limited to at <br/>
most 18 seconds of flight.  This is not the same thing at all.  The purpose <br/>
of the song is to allow people to travel in places they otherwise couldn&#39;t.  <br/>
Other classes still can with levitate, bards can&#39;t.  Do casters fall to the <br/>
ground every 18 seconds when levitating?  No.  Thus yes, it does affect only <br/>
our class.<br/>
<br/>
Rumor has it that this patch was intended to fix a problem with the Pegasus <br/>
Cloak (off Quillmane in SK - I think the item name is something like that).  <br/>
It seems that by hitting the proc (unlimited charges) over and over you <br/>
could rise very fast into the air.  Verant, in their infinite wisdom, fixed <br/>
this problem by making it impossible to refresh any levitate effect.  Had <br/>
any bard-players been on the develpoment team you would think (I certainly <br/>
would, in any case) that the obvious effect on bards would be, well, <br/>
obvious.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE /bug this and /feedback this until they fix it.  Do not stop because <br/>
you heard a rumor that it was unintentional, or because they say they will <br/>
fix it soon.  The more they hear from us, the more it will be a priority for <br/>
the development team.<br/>
