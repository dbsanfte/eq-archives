 </span></blockquote>What level are you?  Once you reach about L10, sense heading<br/>
starts to max out just through normal use.  Forage is nice,<br/>
but I find it more convenient to buy 20 grapes and flasks of<br/>
water and just not worry about it.  It saves me weight, time,<br/>
and inventory space, and the cost is really negligible at<br/>
later levels (less than 1pp for two night&#39;s supply roughly).<br/>
<br/>
I also play a druid and a monk so my setup is a bit of a<br/>
concession to keeping things consistent between all three.<br/>
<br/>
My first bank is made of skills/commands.  Sense heading,<br/>
forage, hide, sneak, sit, bind wounds.  I will probably<br/>
replace hide with the spellbook once I get the invisibility<br/>
song (so I don&#39;t have to switch out of full-screen just to<br/>
change songs).<br/>
<br/>
My second bank has the two melee slots on top and four<br/>
inventory slots for holding weapons and my instruments.  I<br/>
would say three inventory slots are the minimum (two weapons<br/>
or weapon/shield, drum, lute).  That makes a total of five,<br/>
and at that point I figured heck, just make it six.<br/>
<br/>
My third bank has six primary songs.<br/>
<br/>
My fourth bank has my ranged attack (rarely used now that I<br/>
have bellow), the two remaining songs, and assist.  The reason<br/>
I keep all 8 songs macroed is because you can rearrange them<br/>
without leaving the full-screen mode.  Just pick one up and<br/>
exchange it with another.  e.g. I usually keep lullaby,<br/>
bellow, accelerando, and restoration in the third bank.  The<br/>
two remaining slots I usually swap between anthem, whistling<br/>
warsong, and guardian and elemental rhythms.  If we&#39;re<br/>
fighting primarily melee mobs, I&#39;ll keep anthem and whistling<br/>
warsong on bank 3.  If a spellcaster pops up, it just takes me<br/>
a couple seconds to swap in guardian rhytms for the warsong<br/>
and everything I need to twist is still on bank 3.  If we&#39;re<br/>
facing nasty spellcasting critters (like things that can<br/>
charm), I&#39;ll add elemental rhythms to the mix, demoting bellow<br/>
or restoration.<br/>
<br/>
I should probably use the other slots for /who friends all and<br/>
other inane social stuff since I seem to be doing that quite<br/>
often.  :-)<br/>
