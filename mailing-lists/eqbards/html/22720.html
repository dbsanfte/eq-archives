<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038270831">Hi, Atonal! I wondered what happened to you! I have been on this list for at<br/>
least a year, but I try not to bore folks unless I have something to<br/>
contribute. There&#39;s a couple bards from Xegony here: Slyde and Darkfoxx come<br/>
to mind first, but I apologize to the others I can&#39;t call to mind instantly.<br/>
Evercrack is a disease, we were moving and not playing for abouut a month<br/>
and we were itching to get back. I may never finish getting rooms painted<br/>
with Velious out!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Velious, we went last night, visited or toured about 7 zones<br/>
total. Reminded me why I love being a bard! Outdoor exploration! We were<br/>
grouped but outdoors ended up going off in different directions, so I made<br/>
the fast runs around the zones walls to look for connections to other zones.<br/>
We&#39;d already been to the Coldain city and found mostly lots of folks wanting<br/>
a rez. Our cleric was longsuffering but rez&#39;ing everyone that asked. We only<br/>
killed things that attacked us first since faction is unknown and that was<br/>
all mostly green stuff. I bought the 34th song from the gnome pirate camp, I<br/>
only saw it and no other songs for sale there, along with all the other<br/>
class spells. So far, I like the new interface options, the higher<br/>
resolution options, and my machine wasn&#39;t as bogged as I feared it would be<br/>
(400 Celeron).<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t already, check the Concert Hall boards, a new lute was found<br/>
that gives Illusion Howler.<br/>
