&gt; Hey folks, I discovered last night that while Lullaby does not<br/>
&gt; interrupt the lizard casters in Cazic (debatable whether this<br/>
&gt; is a change to Lullaby in general, or lizards are just immune<br/>
&gt; or resistant due to shorter casting times), Pixie Strike<br/>
&gt; *does* interrupt them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, lullaby DOES seem to interrupt lizards, but it&#39;s very infrequent<br/>
for some reason.  I think the nod has to happen at some precise moment, or<br/>
it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Pixie strike is much better, if it&#39;s feasible at the time.<br/>
