<b>Subject:</b> Lvl 48 song ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535485345">Hail all , <br/>
    I have just turned lvl 46 , and was looking to see what songs i had to <br/>
look forward to. Anyway , the lvl 46 song isn&#39;t too exciting. but i looked at <br/>
the lvl 48 song on the concert hall song list , and it says its an area <br/>
effect song that does 100 damage in about 8 seconds . is this true ? how much <br/>
do the other dot songs do at that lvl? Do they stack ? I checked the song <br/>
analysis and there was no info on the damage it does , just that it lowers <br/>
attack speed too ( nice bonus ). So any High lvl that have info and would <br/>
share would be great.  Btw , anyone else think berserker crescendo is <br/>
completely stupid and useless? It doesn&#39;t stack with anything , and only <br/>
gives +20 strength , or does it have other effects? <br/>
Thanks in Advance-<br/>
