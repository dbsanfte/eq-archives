(don&#39;t get the wrong impression, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see this song<br/>
implemented as a cross zone teleport, however, as an inzone song, it could<br/>
be very fun)<br/>

&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s something similar to an idea I&#39;ve been tossing around for a<br/>
&gt; while.  In The Realms, there is a spell that summon&#39;s the caster&#39;s group,<br/>
&gt; from anywhere in the game, to their location.  Personally, I think this<br/>
&gt; would be a great song for one of our still-unfilled slots.  Because it&#39;s<br/>
not<br/>
<br/>
Guys, this one ain&#39;t gonna fly.  One of the big complaints<br/>
about UO (from a designer&#39;s standpoint) was people recalling<br/>
from the bank to the hunting grounds, fighting until full of<br/>
loot, recalling to the bank, selling and dropping stuff off,<br/>
then recalling bank.  While it was convenient, it destroyed<br/>
most of the immersion factor of the game by eliminating the<br/>
travel component.  Verant has been very careful to avoid this<br/>
(why none of the teleport points are in or very near high<br/>
level hunting grounds, PoH and PoS excepted since it costs<br/>
money to teleport to them).  They&#39;re not going to give us a<br/>
song that lets us do it.<br/>
