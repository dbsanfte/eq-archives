<div id="ygrps-yiv-548734675">There is a base skill number for each level.  When you get Dual Wield at<br/>
17th, your skill is already (level * 2).  I know this only because when I<br/>
became a Guide (a Bard, BTW) I was buffed to Apprentice Guide status (level<br/>
20) by the server&#39;s GM.  So off I went at level 20 without having trained<br/>
any skills.  Guides and GMs are just player characters, so I had to start<br/>
pounding my Sense Heading button to train the skill up.  Much to my surpise<br/>
my first increase was &quot;You have become better at Sense Heading(41).&quot;<br/>

&gt; I had an odd experience with training or not training duel wield.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hit level 17 and decided to head back to Kelethin to pick my new song. I<br/>
&gt; knew that I could now use duel wield and that I probably need to<br/>
&gt; point into<br/>
&gt; it for it to work, but I forgot to train in Freeport before I<br/>
&gt; left, and then<br/>
&gt; when I arrived at Kelethin I forgot to train  there as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now back in Freeport I went to the guild intent on putting some<br/>
&gt; points into<br/>
&gt; duel wield before I returned to hunting in Oasis. But to my<br/>
&gt; surprise when I<br/>
&gt; scrolled down to duel wield in the skills window I did not see<br/>
&gt; the friendly<br/>
&gt; &quot;no charge&quot; text, but a charge of 1 plat 3 gold. Hmmm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So off I went to oasis, equipped my dwarven axe and combine longsword and<br/>
&gt; proceeded to pound crocs..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You have become better at duel wield (35)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I am stumped. I never tried to use two weapons before, didn&#39;t train it,<br/>
&gt; and all of a sudden I am starting out with a skill of 34.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well you are able to live without putting a asingle point into<br/>
&gt; the skill.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It will take forever to get the first few points through actually using<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  I tried to do begging from scratch while waiting for the boat.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think I had to hit that button about 200-300 times before I got the<br/>
&gt; &gt; begging(1) message.  What can I say I took the boat a lot in my<br/>
&gt; youth back<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the days when there was only one boat travelling from<br/>
&gt; Butcherblock and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport ^_^.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; like many skills (e.g. warrior&#39;s double attack) i thought we<br/>
&gt; had to put<br/>
&gt; 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; skill point into duel wield to learn the basics.  could be<br/>
&gt; wrong though<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hehe.<br/>
