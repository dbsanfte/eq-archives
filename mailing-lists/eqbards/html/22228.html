&quot;I have some information about changes we will be making to a few bard<br/>
songs with the next patch.<br/>
<br/>
Songs with a damage shield component will have that component removed.<br/>
Pixie Strike will have its secondary resist reduced.<br/>
Song of Twilight will be singable at any time of the day. Its secondary<br/>
resist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration. And<br/>
it will require an instrument.<br/>
The single target haste spells will be self-only.<br/>
<br/>
We will also be revising the bardic epic weapon.<br/>
<br/>
This should all go live with the next patch, which for now we are<br/>
tentatively scheduling for late next week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what to think.<br/>
<br/>
The removal of the damage shields is sort of OK, it means that the songs<br/>
won&#39;t drop now.  These songs aren&#39;t so great though, and it would have<br/>
been nice if something had been added to them.  (A damage shield<br/>
perhaps).<br/>
<br/>
Pixie Strike is good.<br/>
<br/>
Song of Twilight is good.<br/>
<br/>
Single target haste songs will be self only?  Not sure what that means.<br/>
As far as I can remember off the top of my head, the only single target<br/>
song that isn&#39;t self-only is Jonathan&#39;s Provocation, which I have rarely<br/>
used, but it was useful to use it on other targets sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>
hardly useful to use it on myself.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly good, I guess, if the secondary resist for Pixie Strike is low<br/>
enough.  Of course, I&#39;m long past using the song.<br/>
