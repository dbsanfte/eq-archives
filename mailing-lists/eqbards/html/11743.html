<div id="ygrps-yiv-607590132">At level 50, I&#39;m able to pull singles from the lord room using Kelin&#39;s<br/>
Lament.  Lull the two boks on the sides, then pull the lord/ph.  Haven&#39;t<br/>
failed a lull in guk yet, but you might get higher resists at level 46.<br/>
Just take along a lot of charisma.  <br/>

that cleric of yours is a must.  if one of your group is an enchanter, you<br/>
should be good.  that way you can fight the ghoul lord alone while his 2<br/>
guards are out of the fight.  if you do not have an enchanter, i would<br/>
suggest that you pixie strike one of the guards while everyone else takes<br/>
out the lord.  it would be quite difficult, but you could try messing both<br/>
guards, if you can get it to stick.  may as well have dirge up, it&#39;s only<br/>
300+ dmg but it enabled my very unbalanced group (i.e. we should not have<br/>
tried it hehe) to kill the lord once.  we all died, but we got the sword<br/>
first =)  the key is to stagger the spawn.  keep the guard you are on messed<br/>
for a couple minutes after the initial fight, if you all survive.  most of<br/>
your group should be 45+, not 40+.  the lord is 48ish and his guards are<br/>
45ish, give or take.  good luck.<br/>
