<div id="ygrps-yiv-534297072"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think one of Verant&#39;s concerns is that if they change the <br/>
&gt; bind policy, it<br/>
&gt; would be easier for groups to take out the uber-mobs like Lady Vox.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Solution simple. Make bind usable anywhere by anyone. Make<br/>
&#39;danger areas&#39; that you can&#39;t bind in such as Nagafen&#39;s Lair<br/>
or the area around Lady Vox. Heck, make it so that you can&#39;t<br/>
bind within a given radius of any NPC&#39;s if you want. No<br/>
problem there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Melee/hybrid classes could just loot their corpse and<br/>
&gt; reenter the battle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is the difference between a melee class being able<br/>
to do this and a casting class being able to do this?<br/>
The time it takes to loot the melee class&#39;s corpse to<br/>
get his armor, weapons and such would probably be just<br/>
the same amount of time it would take a caster to <br/>
load up their spells without even bothering to grab<br/>
the stuff off their corpse.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) If a character gets killed, and the mob that killed<br/>
&gt; them is still alive when they reappear at their bind<br/>
&gt; point,  that character can no longer do damage to<br/>
&gt; the mob.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think of this in the big picture instead of just against<br/>
Vox or Nagafen. This would cause so many problems it&#39;s<br/>
scary.</div>
