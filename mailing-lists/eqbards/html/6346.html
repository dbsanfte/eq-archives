<div id="ygrps-yiv-975401916">I read story after story of bards telling of tales of valor and wonder in this group. Well I was just wondering if other mail lists tell such stories. I can just imagine the Warriors group. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;So there I was in the middle of a fight. I started off with a 1 handed bashing and hit the orc for  awhile then switched to a 2 handed bashing and hit it some more. Man what a night&quot;<br/>

Long live the Bard!!!!</div>
