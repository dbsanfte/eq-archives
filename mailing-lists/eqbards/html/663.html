<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729566309">What level do you think you need to bo to complete this quest. I think<br/>
I might know how to complete the quest, but I haven&#39;t been around there<br/>
lately. He said that a hermit stole his pages, right? I saw a hermit in<br/>
a house in South Karanas, but the door was locked. I thought maybe if I<br/>
could get someone to open it for me, I could finish the quest. <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought. I may try it this weekend, and see what happend. I most<br/>
certainly am not ready for it, if the reqard is a level 30 song, I am<br/>
just about level 10.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way, I ahve been making the Freeport to Qeynos trip<br/>
frequently since level 7. I made the trip from Qeynos to South Karana<br/>
at level 6, I think. Travelling is fun. Don&#39;t underestimate the gift of<br/>
sheer speed.<br/>

Just thought of this...<br/>
<br/>
Possible *SPOILER* for some:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone completed the quest from Valen Nostrolo in South Karana? He<br/>
was completing a song and needed two pages. It is possible that the<br/>
reward could be one of the missing songs. I am not high enough level to<br/>
complete the quest yet, so don&#39;t know what you get.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...<br/>
