<div id="ygrps-yiv-489412155">Some people are equipped better than others.  &quot;Uber&quot; guilds get the<br/>
reputation they do is an assumption that everyone should play the way they<br/>
do and the design of the game should be catered to the way they play.<br/>
<br/>
I would argue that good equipment is as much a determinant of time spent<br/>
playing as it is ability of the player.  Some of the best players I&#39;ve seen<br/>
have some of the most mediocre equipment.<br/>
<br/>
So for many of us; particularly when fighting mobs that dispell - the bards<br/>
resist songs are the difference between success and failure.<br/>

You mean 380MR when VI says the cap is 255 and anything over is wasted?<br/>
Or the people who say they resist less with 350 than with 190?  With the<br/>
first nag and vox raids when there was not a large variety of resist<br/>
gear, sure bards helped a lot.  Today, anyone can easily buff their<br/>
resists with equipment.  Tests are inconclusive as to what point resists<br/>
are soft-capped (anywhere from 175 to 255).  Level is the primary factor<br/>
in resisting.  Equipment gives you permanent resists and resists buffs<br/>
from other classes stay on you whereas resists from bards are gone when<br/>
they lag or die.<br/>
