<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310165503">Secret Tip from someone who worked with VI pretty closely for a long time:<br/>
<br/>
Get an email together<br/>
get a TON of people to &quot;sign&quot; it<br/>
then send a copy of the email to:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;server&gt;@...<br/>
<br/>
Replace &lt;Server&gt; with the name of each server (without spaces) ie:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:therathe@...">therathe@...</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lanystvil@...">lanystvil@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Send a copy of this email to EVERY server<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Sending to that address sends the email to the following people:<br/>
<br/>
All Senior Guides for the server<br/>
All GM&#39;s assigned to the server<br/>
All GM LEAD ADMINS for the server<br/>
<br/>
IE:  You can hit every single GM at Verant with the complaint, directly,<br/>
rather than posting the complaint to 1 message board where it will rapidly<br/>
get burried or ignored.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2.5 cents ;)<br/>

Bard of Norrath<br/>
<br/>
PS:  ONLY SEND 1 EMAIL TO EACH ADDRESS<br/>
Mail bombing will get you 1) ignored, 2) banned from sending email, 3)<br/>
potentially banned from the game<br/>

&gt; I think we&#39;d just like to get some attention focused on this now.  If no<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; complains you can be sure Verant will say, &quot;Hey there weren&#39;t any new bard<br/>
&gt; songs out there for weeks and everyone knew this, why didn&#39;t you speak up<br/>
&gt; then?&quot;<br/>

&gt; I agree and understand.  But GZ flat out stated that the information in<br/>
&gt; SPDAT.EFF was on test for _testing_ and even made the &#39;joke spells&#39; at the<br/>
&gt; end to prove his point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, I agree it&#39;s likely that our songs will be an afterthought.  Then<br/>
&gt; again, they always have been.  The Bard class was the single most nerfed<br/>
&gt; class in the game during Beta.  And even, to some extent, during final<br/>
&gt; (every DOT nerf affected us, the levitate nerf affected us, etc etc.  Our<br/>
&gt; charm song even got nerfed because of the nerf to charm spells (with no<br/>
fix<br/>
&gt; in sight).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree that it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll continue to be ignored.  However, that<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; said, I still think it&#39;s a bit premature to start crying wolf, before it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; even out of the womb, let alone in our pasture or yard.  I understand that<br/>
&gt; people are unhappy about what&#39;s in the SPDAT.EFF file, however, I think<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; premature to start complaining about something that is changing on a<br/>
weekly<br/>
&gt; basis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, in response to you, I&#39;ve been playing EQ since Beta 2.  I&#39;ve played a<br/>
&gt; Bard since Beta 2 (as well as every other class in the game to level 25+).<br/>
&gt; I care very much about the game and love my bard too.  However, the<br/>
&gt; difference is, I refuse to complain about something that doesn&#39;t even<br/>
exist<br/>
&gt; yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On top of that I&#39;ve been on Test since day 1 of final and seen some pretty<br/>
&gt; wacky stuff that made it to TEST but never went live.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Stop worrying.  SPDAT.EFF is a farcical file at best.  As a matter of<br/>
&gt; fact<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; GZ posted a bunch of false data in it _on purpose_ because they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people knowing what&#39;s going in for Kunark.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The stuff going in for test is for testing.  I seriously doubt half of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s listed goes into final.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   95% of what is listed in that file is live and in the game.  To<br/>
suggest<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that half of it won&#39;t make it to final is pure speculation on your<br/>
part.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   And that&#39;s what this all boils down to.  Everyone&#39;s best guess.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   If those spells made it into the file this far, chances are they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;   going into the game.  Allbeit, their values/stats/effects may be<br/>
tweaked<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you can count on those spells going live.  Such is my experience since<br/>
&gt; &gt;   early beta.  (And I don&#39;t mean the bogus InstantKill spell at the end<br/>
&gt; &gt;   of the file)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides.  I hate that people are even trying to figure this out<br/>
already.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All you guys are doing is getting really worked up over something that<br/>
&gt; may<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or may not happen.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   And I hate people who think they know Verant&#39;s every move, tell others<br/>
&gt; &gt;   to chill out, that&#39;s it&#39;s just a game, and then proceed to compose an<br/>
&gt; &gt;   irritated mail about why they don&#39;t really care.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   The people on this list genuinely care about their bards and the fact<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that no songs are even in the file for testing worries everyone on<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt;   list.  Songs were missing in beta, and never made it in.  I believe<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   same thing will transpire here.  The songs that I imagine being added<br/>
&gt; &gt;   will come one or two weeks before they ship the final for release, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   those songs will be vague and poorly tested.  That comment is based on<br/>
&gt; &gt;   my 1.5 years of experience with Brad&#39;s team.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I&#39;d love to have the undying support and optimism some people here<br/>
&gt; &gt;   try to enlighten us with, but the fact is if you let me down once,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you let me down twice, you&#39;ll probably let me down three, four, or<br/>
&gt; &gt;   more times.  That is the Verant way.  They created a great game,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   however they are poorly supporting and adding to their creation.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Until something wonderful happens, I will still remain doubtful.<br/>
