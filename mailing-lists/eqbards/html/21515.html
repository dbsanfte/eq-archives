<b>Subject:</b> Soloing Spectres at level 39 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975721935">I asked the list a while back when I was level 35 about any particular <br/>
strategies to solo spectres and as given advice to wait until level 40 <br/>
before giving it a try. I&#39;m level 39 now, and was cruising through Oasis <br/>
and on a whim, ran out to spectre island.<br/>
<br/>
Tambourine in hand, and weaving Aria of Eagles and Accelerando, I targeted <br/>
one of the spectres sitting on the corner. I kept a good distance and hit <br/>
it with Chant of Flame.  I backed off to the shore and waited over in the <br/>
plains by the &quot;shelf&quot; near Sro zone. I watched as my target came out of the <br/>
water I started to kite him with the 2 chants. I then noticed 2 of his <br/>
buddies coming over a ridge. Fortunately, they aren&#39;t above level 37, so I <br/>
charmed the one I was fighting, and sent him against his buddies.<br/>
<br/>
I happily observed that both of the newcomers started beating on my pet, so <br/>
I didn&#39;t have to worry about being chased. I kept on eye out for the <br/>
healthy one and charmed him when I noticed my pet was getting beat up <br/>
pretty well. No problem, 2 died pretty quickly, and I was left with just <br/>
kiting the last one who was at full health thanks to his lifetaps.<br/>
<br/>
Kiting is pretty easy as they are slower than molasses. I observed that if <br/>
I keep away from them, I hardly got lifetapped. When he was below a bubble <br/>
of health he started to run. Unfortunately, he started running just as he <br/>
was out of my view. I looked around for him, but he had disappeared and <br/>
didn&#39;t even show up on track. Evidently, he warped back to the island. As <br/>
soon as I went near the island all the spectres aggro&#39;d on me. I zoned as I <br/>
wasn&#39;t ready to tackle 5.<br/>
<br/>
I went back and hunted them again. I chained them when they ran. If I was <br/>
kiting just 1, I chained him instead of using accelerando. Also, I noticed <br/>
that the closer I was to the spectre, the less likely he was to resist my <br/>
chants. I tested this about two dozen times, but I&#39;m sure John Kim would <br/>
disapprove of my sample size. I&#39;ll be hunting them more, so I&#39;ll keep an <br/>
eye on that correlation.<br/>
<br/>
SOW would have been helpful, but it&#39;s not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I posted that I thought I saw less of a wobble to our accelerando. <br/>
Well with a nice view of myself (instead of in a dark swamp) I <br/>
unfortunately see that I still spasm my way across the zone.<br/>
