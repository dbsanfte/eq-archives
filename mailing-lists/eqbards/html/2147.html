<div id="ygrps-yiv-183166958">&lt;And I don&#39;t understand where you think we are &quot;supposed to be the<br/>
most traveling class in Norrath&quot;.  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you must know, I tought I had read it at the EQ/Station site.  I went<br/>
back to check but I was mistaken, I must have read it somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;.  I think most Bards would prefer to have this &quot;bug&quot; in the game&gt;<br/>
Why?  When grouping with others it disrupts two of their most often used<br/>
spells?  I would think the opposite would be true.  Granted, I can always<br/>
get a SoW from someone in the group, but why let them waste the mana when<br/>
Selo&#39;s is faster (at least for me)?<br/>

&gt;There are no plans to allow bards to bind themselves.  Bind Affinity is for<br/>
&gt;pure spellcasters, not hybrids or jack-of-all-trades.  While Bards can<br/>
&gt;travel a lot, we are the class that least needs Bind Affinity.  With Selo,<br/>
&gt;we can travel much faster than any other class (besides the high level gate<br/>
&gt;spells).  And I don&#39;t understand where you think we are &quot;supposed to be the<br/>
&gt;most traveling class in Norrath&quot;.  My Cleric has traveled much more than my<br/>
&gt;Bard, and this was before the Cleric had Bind Affinity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Selo&#39;s does disrupt SoW.  This is most likely a bug.  Selos also disrupts<br/>
&gt;Root.  This is most likely the same bug.  Fixing one bug will fix the other<br/>
&gt;bug.  I think most Bards would prefer to have this &quot;bug&quot; in the game.<br/>
&gt;Verant seems to be willing to leave it in for &quot;gameplay&quot;.<br/>
