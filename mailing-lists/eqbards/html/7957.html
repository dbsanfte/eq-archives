&gt;         Well, to respond to this, and your earlier message.  Every caster<br/>
&gt; class gets at least 1 option to avoiding engagements on corpse retrieval,<br/>
&gt; many get 2.  One is invis, the other is root.  Yes, some classes don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; these spells until lvl 9 or 16 or so, but that&#39;s not really the point.<br/>
&gt; The difference between the various melee classes and the various caster<br/>
&gt; classes don&#39;t really begin to show themselves until around this time<br/>
&gt; anyways.  If one tries to argue that a melee class can get to their corpse<br/>
&gt; easier than a caster because a level 1 warrior has more hp than a level 1<br/>
&gt; wizard, that argument is completely invalid when discussing the two<br/>
&gt; classes as a whole.<br/>
&gt; Given that one (repeatedly suggested) option is for melee-types to keep spare <br/>
 </span></blockquote>weapons/armor in the bank (a reasonably significant cash investment, especially early <br/>
on), there is one other way in which ALL caster classes can protect themselves from a <br/>
very early level:  their PET.  Yes, it has a component cost and yes, it would need to <br/>
be cast in every (dangerous) region, but it is like having your own sacrificial lackey <br/>
around to take attackers off of you.  If your only purpose is to get away, any <br/>
attacking monster will shift its attention to the pet almost as soon as the pet starts <br/>
hitting it, giving you a free and unimpeded run.  If you&#39;re lucky, you might even get <br/>
exp for it.  I don&#39;t see melee types getting a free tank in order to save their own <br/>
tushies.  I&#39;ve used this method to great advantage with my Enchantress.<br/>
