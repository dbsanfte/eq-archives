<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715780792">Well, I hate to see you stop playing. Unrest and MM are not great places for<br/>
a 22 bard.  Unrest is great at 26 thru 30 in a good group (2 tanks, caster<br/>
and a good cleric (29+).  MM I do not know at all.<br/>
<br/>
Now...South Karana and the aviaks - that is a good place for a 22 bard and<br/>
ad hoc groups are not so bad and you can escape a bad fite.  Also, HighKeep<br/>
during the week is pretty good too - you can fite in groups although you may<br/>
need to be on a 20 or 30 minute waiting list to get in.  Escape is a bit<br/>
harder in Keep but possible.<br/>
<br/>
You and your druid friend could partner - kite (snare, dot, he pulls, you<br/>
chase and wince & whack &#39;em) for 10 levels.  Usually always plenty of birds<br/>
- wide open spaces and some &quot;fighting music&quot; if you are under the trees.<br/>
Close to the Lake Rathe Zone and nite time gnoll camp for loots.<br/>
