&gt;I think we are saying the same thing here - yes the bard gets the mob&#39;s<br/>
&gt;attention but it&#39;s because of the way mob ai works - they can sense who<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;should kill and they see you as both dangerous to them and as easy to kill.<br/>
&gt;Because you are in the party that attacked one of their party - you get put<br/>
&gt;on their hate list.  All of them now hate you.  You are right it is a<br/>
&gt;programming thing but I think it&#39;s the way they want it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it has been noted that mobs will single out Bards who are *not*<br/>
in the party attacking them, who have no reason to be on the hate list at<br/>
all, to attack.  As I&#39;ve experienced:<br/>
In Crushbone, a group trains Crush into the cave where a Bard is resting.<br/>
Crush stops pounding on them, and turns to pound on the Bard, completely<br/>
ignoring everyone else.<br/>
This is why Bards make the best engineers ;)<br/>
<br/>
I think the programming that causes this is the part where a mob checks the<br/>
immediate area for threats, and detects the Bard&#39;s potential threat (not<br/>
actual threat - potential threat).  Therein lies the problem.  The Bard<br/>
(who has mostly group-affecting songs) is seen as the greatest threat<br/>
*regardless* of the fact that he or she is neither attacking nor even a<br/>
member of the party on the hate list.  This is what needs to be fixed.<br/>
That and the attractiveness of our instruments.  *sheesh* I know I play bad<br/>
notes once in a while, but still!<br/>
