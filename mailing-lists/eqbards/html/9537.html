&gt; make me feel any better. I kicked up Selo&#39;s said a silent prayer to Karana<br/>
&gt; and bolted down the path to the South. Just passing the HighHold marker I<br/>

Word of advice - stick to the (right) wall.  On the zone from WC - hug the<br/>
wall - and keep doing so.  Be careful not to take falling damage -<br/>
especially around the RV zone.  Get off the wall and run around it.  Get<br/>
back on the wall and hug it.  You&#39;ll see &quot;stone&quot; again.  Get down - you&#39;ll<br/>
catch up with the trail and you can follow it a very short way to the HP<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s safer - and easier to keep your party from getting separated in the<br/>
dark and fog...<br/>
