&gt; Astute observation John.  It has me wondering now, what is your agi then?<br/>
&gt; I still seem to be okay even with almost a full set of bronze (minus<br/>
&gt; gloves and mask).  However I haven&#39;t noticed being hit much more than I<br/>
&gt; did before, perhaps a higher AGI helps compensate for being really close<br/>
&gt; to your max weight allowance.  Just for reference my AGI is 100 base and<br/>
&gt; 102 at the moment with the aid of an earring.  The other thing that I can<br/>

Going to plate took me to 68/73 (68/77 thanks to some str<br/>
rings my friends gave me).  This is all before I&#39;ve picked up<br/>
any loot.  With banded, I&#39;d usually see myself dodge once or<br/>
twice in a fight.  Now that I think about it, the last time I<br/>
remember seeing myself dodge was over a week ago(!).<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that our experience is relative.  I didn&#39;t start<br/>
wearing plate until I had three pieces (breastplate, greaves,<br/>
pauldron) because I was vain and didn&#39;t like the way bronze<br/>
chest and banded leggings looked.  :-)  So I went from mostly<br/>
banded to mostly plate rather quickly.  If you went piece by<br/>
piece like most people seem to do, you may not have noticed.<br/>
If you got plate early (so your AC was high enough that mobs<br/>
were just hitting for less because it was way beyond their<br/>
&quot;level&quot; range), you may not have noticed either figuring the<br/>
extra damage was just due to the mobs being tougher.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try getting a full suit of mesh from Guk and playing with<br/>
that and report back in a week or so.<br/>
