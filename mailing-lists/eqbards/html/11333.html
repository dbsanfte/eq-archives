<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032368439">For awhile on Prexus, there were 4 DW shamans making a HUGE supply of pets<br/>
to hunt on Tower island.  We spent from level 20 to about 24 just pounding<br/>
on pets with probably about 40 other people (even then there was PLENTY to<br/>
hunt).  In fact for a while, my guild had two full parties of 6 camping a<br/>
spot on the island.  My brother&#39;s druid was pulling for one party, dropping<br/>
the pets off, getting a quick heal if needed and running back for more.  He<br/>
kept both parties of 6 OOM all night long.  This Nirvana went away after<br/>
about a week and a half when the servers were reset and wizards spawned<br/>
instead of shamans.<br/>
<br/>
If you can get a group of level 50&#39;s to go down there and fix the spawns, it<br/>
was a GREAT time and awesome XP, although you won&#39;t make a dime (no loot).<br/>

&gt; I also just hit 20 and decided to give Lake Rathe a try. Mind you<br/>
&gt; I have not<br/>
&gt; actually hunted anything yet, but from a brief swim around the lake it<br/>
&gt; seemed as though there would be plenty to hunt and hopefully I will find<br/>
&gt; some pickup groups.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This has been asked over and over I&#39;m sure but..<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a level 20 bard, where is a good place to go? I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; all about the level chart on AllaKazam&#39;s page, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; found it to be seriously flawed so I don&#39;t follow it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; PS: Maybe we could come up with a list or chart for<br/>
&gt; &gt; bards between all of us..<br/>
