<div id="ygrps-yiv-170057958">You hardware problems are mainly that P200MMX you are running on that 66MHz<br/>
motherboard and the 64 megs of Ram.  We have determined for the most part<br/>
that internet bandwidth is not necessarily the main factor involved in EQ&#39;s<br/>
speed.<br/>
<br/>
Since the EQ graphics are all stored on your local Hard Disk, another factor<br/>
is your hard drive size.  You never want to have your Hard Drive completely<br/>
full, after it is about 60 or 70% full you will begin to notice performance<br/>
degradation because the disk head has to travel all over the surface of the<br/>
whole drive to access data, this slows things down significantly and you<br/>
would mainly notice it in slow zoning times.<br/>
<br/>
You could sacrifice the CPU upgrade in lieu of another 60megs of RAM, this<br/>
would probably help you significantly.  ALL windows OS&#39;s run terrible with<br/>
64 megs of RAM, you will be incredibly suprised at the performance increase<br/>
of your machine with 128megs of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
Since EQ is purely a 3D driven game, you would do good to upgrade your video<br/>
card, if by &quot;16&quot; you mean it is a 16 meg card, then you should think about<br/>
moving to a 32 meg card.  Problem with this is that I think most of the new<br/>
32 meg video cards these days are AGP bus cards which require a capable<br/>
motherboard that I suspect you do not have based on your explanation of your<br/>
current configuration.<br/>
<br/>
So in summary, I would put this priority on your upgrade considerations:<br/>
<br/>
1. 128MB RAM (primary importance)<br/>
2. Faster CPU (go as far as you can afford)<br/>
3. Faster Motherboard (100+MHz frontside bus - this choice may also affect<br/>
CPU choice above)<br/>
4. 32meg AGP video card (depends on if you upgrade the motherboard above)<br/>
5. Swap that winmodem out for a good 3COM modem with internal processing<br/>
(low priority)<br/>
<br/>
You could spend probably from $100-$1000 on this depending on how far down<br/>
through the list you go.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

&gt; Question for anyone here who can successfully stack 3 or 4 <br/>
&gt; songs in crowded<br/>
&gt; zones:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What are you using for hardware? (processor, ram, video ram, free<br/>
&gt; DASD/virtual mem - whichever is smaller, modem, typical connect speed,<br/>
&gt; anything else I may be forgetting)  I know I could use a bit <br/>
&gt; of a hardware<br/>
&gt; upgrade, just wondering how little I can get away with. Also, <br/>
&gt; what in-game<br/>
&gt; sacrifices have you made in the options to be able to <br/>
&gt; weave/mix/twist so<br/>
&gt; successfully?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FYI I&#39;m using P200 MMX, 64ram, 16 video, 100 mg free all allocated to<br/>
&gt; virtual memory, 64 winmodem that usually connects at 44.  I <br/>
&gt; forgot to write<br/>
&gt; down my option settings, but I know I&#39;ve got single layer sky & sound<br/>
&gt; realism all the way up.  The rest I&#39;d have to check when I get home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Note: this is not to restart a debate on modems or anything <br/>
&gt; else.  Please<br/>
&gt; think of it as a survey & don&#39;t pounce on anyone who handles the game<br/>
&gt; differently from you.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance to any who help.<br/>
