<b>Subject:</b> Insight into Lament <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-234283589">The enchanter web site has a list of spell effects put<br/>
together with descriptions from one of the developers.  It<br/>
says lull type spells work by reducing the aggro radius of<br/>
creatures.  That would explain why sometimes Lament works (you<br/>
get the &quot;sad&quot; message), but when you pull a mob, the mob you<br/>
just Lamented still comes along.  If the mob you pull enters<br/>
the Lamented mob&#39;s aggro radius, both will come.  I&#39;ve played<br/>
around a bit with this with my enchanter and it really does<br/>
seem to work this way.  If I lull the closer mob and pull the<br/>
further one so it takes a path near the closer one, the closer<br/>
one almost always joins.  If I lull the further one and pull<br/>
the closer one, I almost always get it alone.<br/>
<br/>
So when you Lament, be wary of the physical arrangement of the<br/>
mobs, and the path they will take to get to you.  It&#39;s also<br/>
possible that using a lute further reduces the aggro radius,<br/>
as opposed to (or in addition to) increasing the duration of<br/>
the Lament.<br/>
