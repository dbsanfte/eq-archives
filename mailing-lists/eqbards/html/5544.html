&gt; My hardest one ever was in Lake Rathe. I used a canoe & Lycos to find the<br/>

&gt; and we dragged it to shore where she could loot it once she got outta the<br/>
&gt; canoe.  Maybbe that guy can /corpse it onto the boat or at least drag it to<br/>
&gt; the next stop. Otherwise it&#39;s GM time and wait for help.<br/>

locations for different people.  If your song points to<br/>
somewhere very very far from where the guy said he died, I&#39;d<br/>
suspect this bug first, and ask the guy to search around where<br/>
he died.  If it *is* this bug and you do end up finding his<br/>
corpse, more often than not *he* will be unable to see it<br/>
where you see it until he leaves and re-enters the zone (dunno<br/>
why, but this seems to fix it).<br/>

have fun, and looking for your corpse is not fun.  Even if it<br/>
costs me a half hour of my time, if it saves him several hours<br/>
of his time, I figure it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I personally happen to think looking for corpses is<br/>
fun :-). Some of my greatest adventures have been recovering<br/>
corpses for people, like from lava, or out from underneath the<br/>
guards&#39; noses in Nektulos, or having fallen down deep pits in<br/>
Guk....<br/>
