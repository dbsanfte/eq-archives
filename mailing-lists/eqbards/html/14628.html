<div id="ygrps-yiv-838225041">And then there are those with he hours to be much higher than we<br/>
are, but can&#39;t seem to figure out how to make those hours turn into<br/>
levels :(<br/>
<br/>
My enchanter has been level 13 since November. And, in that time,<br/>
I&#39;ve put 40 hours onto her. (at least. I did not get a /played<br/>
right when I hit 13) She is still over a bubble from 14. If hell<br/>
levels are worse than this, I don&#39;t want to see them.<br/>
<br/>
...What I&#39;m REALLY looking forward to though is hitting level 20. I<br/>
want to get a last name at least once...<br/>

&gt;&gt; Here is the part I think he is referring to.  I would interpret<br/>
&gt;it somewhat<br/>
&gt;&gt; differently.   I dont read &quot;never&quot; in here - just that it will take a lot<br/>
&gt;&gt; longer in real time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Which is, of course, how it should be.  As a casual gamer playing 2 hours a<br/>
&gt;night, I should expect to advance slower than somebody who plays 12 hours a<br/>
&gt;day.  There&#39;s no &quot;bias&quot; against casual gamers in EQ that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;exist in any<br/>
&gt;other online game.  And it&#39;s not really accurate to call it a bias<br/>
&gt;either...after all would it be fair for me to level 6x faster than Joe<br/>
&gt;Collegestudent just because I can&#39;t play as much as him?<br/>
