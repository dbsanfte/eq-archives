<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077798342">Forage is not useful?!!!  Please!  I&#39;ve heard several<br/>
people complain about this in this thread.  I never<br/>
have to buy food!  I think that is extremely useful. <br/>
Granted, once you get to higher levels it isn&#39;t like<br/>
food is some huge expense.  But it is something you<br/>
have to remember to buy if you are a class without<br/>
forage capabilities.  Me?  I just click forage when I<br/>
remember and there is food.  Heck, it probably works<br/>
less than 50% of the time but it definitely produces a<br/>
big enough stream of food to keep my supplies up.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that&#39;s the major complaint - we get all<br/>
&gt; these neato &#39;other&#39; class<br/>
&gt; skills - but our caps are so low - it makes you<br/>
&gt; wonder why they bothered? I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger,<br/>
&gt; or forage - but I<br/>
&gt; WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   The other thought i have to add here is that like<br/>
&gt; tracking<br/>
&gt; &gt;for druids...its a special skill.  we get it at a<br/>
&gt; level and it never<br/>
&gt; &gt;advances..it caps at 20 and when we get it that is<br/>
&gt; the skill we get it<br/>
&gt; &gt;at.  Is it possible that bards get forage and its<br/>
&gt; at skill lvl 40 when<br/>
&gt; &gt;we get it.  Just a thought...  oh yeah and skill<br/>
&gt; cap for druids is 200<br/>
&gt; &gt;i believe<br/>
