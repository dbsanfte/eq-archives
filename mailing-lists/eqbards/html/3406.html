&gt; this is probably why it happened.  I think that with different level bards,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well Hymn is the obvious one.  If the healer(s) are running<br/>
low on mana, the group is tank-heavy and they&#39;re doing a good <br/>
job splitting up the damage they&#39;re taking, and it looks like<br/>
we still have a long fight in front of us, I will usually<br/>
switch to a lute to hold us over until the healers can<br/>
meditate some.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Steel is bought from blacksmith merchants and has the same AC<br/>
as bronze, but is lighter.  Lemme pull out my notes on small<br/>
steel plate...<br/>

Boots      8  4.9  346.5  6.1<br/>

Cloak      8  4.1  399    5.1<br/>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Difference in weight between steel and bronze for the pieces<br/>
where I have bronze weights are 38.3 vs 47.8, about a 20%<br/>
difference.  I&#39;ve omitted all the Wt:AC ratios and Wt:BWt<br/>
columns I have on my spreadsheet.  :-)  By far the piece with<br/>
the highest Wt:AC ratio though is the mask, and it&#39;s the<br/>
cheapest too.  I&#39;m not sure I want to give up my snakeskin<br/>
mask quite yet though.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, these prices fit the 5% theory I found with<br/>
combine weapons.<br/>
