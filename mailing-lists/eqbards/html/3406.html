&gt; this is probably why it happened.  I think that with different level bards,<br/>
&gt; the higher bard wins out on the song, but if you&#39;re both the same level, it<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t decide.  Wish I had checked the healing rates though.<br/>

&gt; was better for me to forgo my weapons to use a drum for Elemental and<br/>
&gt; Guardian Rhythyms, at least against the casters.  Are there any other combos<br/>
&gt; like this where it&#39;s best to forgo my weapon and damage to better the rest<br/>
&gt; of the fighters?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well Hymn is the obvious one.  If the healer(s) are running<br/>
low on mana, the group is tank-heavy and they&#39;re doing a good <br/>
job splitting up the damage they&#39;re taking, and it looks like<br/>
we still have a long fight in front of us, I will usually<br/>
switch to a lute to hold us over until the healers can<br/>
meditate some.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Steel is bought from blacksmith merchants and has the same AC<br/>
as bronze, but is lighter.  Lemme pull out my notes on small<br/>
steel plate...<br/>

Item      AC  Wt   Cost   BronzeWt<br/>
Boots      8  4.9  346.5  6.1<br/>
Bracers    7  3.0  252    3.8<br/>
Breastplt 17  7.5  787.5  9.4<br/>
Greaves   10  5.6  420    7.0<br/>
Belt       7  3.0  294    3.8<br/>
Collar     6  3.0  147    3.7<br/>
Gloves     9  3.8  483    4.7<br/>
Arms       8  4.9  336    ???<br/>
Pauldron   8  3.4  367.5  4.2<br/>
Helm      10  4.5  367.5  ???<br/>
Mask       5  1.1  105    ???<br/>
Cloak      8  4.1  399    5.1<br/>
&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Difference in weight between steel and bronze for the pieces<br/>
where I have bronze weights are 38.3 vs 47.8, about a 20%<br/>
difference.  I&#39;ve omitted all the Wt:AC ratios and Wt:BWt<br/>
columns I have on my spreadsheet.  :-)  By far the piece with<br/>
the highest Wt:AC ratio though is the mask, and it&#39;s the<br/>
cheapest too.  I&#39;m not sure I want to give up my snakeskin<br/>
mask quite yet though.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, these prices fit the 5% theory I found with<br/>
combine weapons.<br/>
