 </span></blockquote>*grins* thanks to everyone who&#39;ve replied.  I also read that I could <br/>
make my own armor using a loom but apparently I would need a Cat <br/>
pelt or somesuch for medium and I have yet to see a cat in Greater <br/>
Faydark.  Still, I can&#39;t wait to go see if I can buy some, i have 2 <br/>
or 3 pp burning a hole in my pocket :)<br/>
