<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417011">You think it is just those outside of North America that get lag?<br/>
I think they realize there is lag. But have chosen to go this direction<br/>
anyway.<br/>

&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;* Any possiblility for a /twistsong ####, where # is the gem #?<br/>
&gt;  Would make twisting considerably easier than hitting keys twice every<br/>
&gt;  3 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Probably not. We&#39;d really like to see bards actively played, rather<br/>
&gt;  than passivly sitting there after typing one command. The more<br/>
&gt;  dexterous the person behind the keyboard is the more benefit that a<br/>
&gt;  bard can impart to the party. A person who can compose a song of 3<br/>
&gt;  different melodies and change instruments at the same time is a<br/>
&gt;  formidable bard indeed<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  *SIGH*  Sounds like it was forgotten that a larg population of EQ players<br/>
&gt;are not American!  ON a good day here in Australia I can keep<br/>
&gt;almost 3 songs<br/>
&gt;going.  But one will drop before I can start again.  When connecting from<br/>
&gt;half way across the world I have plenty of time to pick up lag.  And the<br/>
&gt;best time!  is a 8pm to midnight my time when there&#39;s about 600 players on<br/>
&gt;the whole server.  *SIGH*  So no matter how good the person behind the<br/>
&gt;keyboard is lag will still play a role in it.  But then that&#39;s a rather<br/>
&gt;narrow focus if they have forgotten those outside of North America in<br/>
&gt;this... </span></blockquote></div>
