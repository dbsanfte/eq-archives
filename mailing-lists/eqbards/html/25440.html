<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186521905">A new spreadsheet is out.<br/>
<br/>
Not a lot of changes this time, but thought I should refresh what&#39;s <br/>
out there:<br/>
<br/>
Reduced all instrument modifiers by a hair (to reflect a rounding <br/>
problem Verant seems to have).<br/>
Charm doesn&#39;t work on 52+ mobs.<br/>
Changed the DoT value of Angstlich&#39;s Assonance (60) to match measured <br/>
results.<br/>
I just listed the Shield of Song (49) as just dropping in Erudine <br/>
(got rid of the whole Seafarer&#39;s Roost thing).<br/>
Misc. spelling errors.<br/>
<br/>
Again, it can be found at www.eqsongs.com and www.eqdiva.com (should <br/>
be up shortly) or at my site here: <br/>
