<div id="ygrps-yiv-118259327">Mmh as english is my second language (Any Danes here?) and since  I have<br/>
been on the net since 90 and playing online rpg&#39;s since 92 - I know how it<br/>
is like to not write perfect english.<br/>
 Most people are very understanding - That is, when they realise that I am<br/>
from Denmark, I have been subject to some english rants in Newsgroups where<br/>
people was making remarks about my lack of english skills until I told them<br/>
that English is a second language. Many people out there still have the<br/>
assumption that everyone on the net are Americans, even though that faulty<br/>
image is not so widespread as it was a couple of years ago.<br/>
I also tend to  excuse my english skills when playing EQ - Just to let<br/>
people know why I sometimes write jiberish ;o) Not to excuse spelling and<br/>
grammar, I could get that right if I wanted. it would just take me hours to<br/>
get even this small mail right and I dont think my boss would approve<br/>
*grin*.<br/>

Does it ever bother anyone else that people who say, &quot;Sorry if you couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand, English isn&#39;t my first language,&quot; often speak more coherently<br/>
than about 70 -80% of the people whose first language it is?  I mean, I<br/>
meet<br/>
people who have been speaking English their entire lives, and I guess its<br/>
just degraded from over use.  For all of those people out there who think<br/>
they aren&#39;t being understood, don&#39;t worry about it, chances are you get<br/>
your<br/>
points across more clearly than we naturals do :)<br/>
