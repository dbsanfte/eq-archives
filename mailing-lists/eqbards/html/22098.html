<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342201102">One place where I was able to use my Vox Horn and Kelin&#39;s Lute to good<br/>
(area) effect was in the Sol-B bats-bugs.  Any of the rooms/places where you<br/>
can kill bats and bugs.  I had a healer (cleric) in the group and the puller<br/>
would bring as many as he could.  With 3 mobs, playing lute for Chords of<br/>
Disonance, Chords of Cessation, swap to horn for Denons, rinse repeat.  By<br/>
the tine the first mob was dead, the second would be nearly down to half<br/>
health.  By the time the 2nd one was dead, the third one would be way below<br/>
half health.  You do need a healer but the efficiency of AE DoT songs shines<br/>
- and the dragon/god instruments really help.<br/>
<br/>
On other occasions, I will use the Vox horn with Berserker&#39;s to add some<br/>
dramatic STR stats when ppl in the group are begging for str buffs (rogues,<br/>
etc.)<br/>

After our successful hit on Nagafen we decided to take on Lady Vox and the<br/>
Ice Giants last night.<br/>
<br/>
One complete heal (doh!)  One Superior Heal (Does that mean she was low on<br/>
mana?) and 6 dead adventurers later, she fell.  I guess the dragon support<br/>
our bard plight with Verant as she also dropped her insturment, and this<br/>
time, yours truly was given the horn!  Gotta love the stats on this thing,<br/>
but it bears a question.<br/>
<br/>
When will I ever use it?  I haven&#39;t pulled out my horn (except to max my<br/>
brass skill) since lvl 23 I think...<br/>
<br/>
