<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030043029">You&#39;re joking, right?  The flute is for getting to your corpse inside Cazic<br/>
going through the maze and up to the Archon or back to the mud temple, it<br/>
never occurred to me to use it in Feerrott.  A plain-vanilla skelly at the<br/>
zone?  If I&#39;m bard enough to be fighting in Cazic, why on earth would I<br/>
waste my time killing that?  Afraid of a Bouncer with Selo&#39;s?  Heck I<br/>
routinely smack the Bouncer when he comes up to the CT zone and run him back<br/>
out into the Feerrott so that he doesn&#39;t kill half the folks resting at the<br/>
zone.  As for Spectres - yeah I seem them once in a while but I just veer<br/>
around them; they&#39;ve never killed me.  You&#39;re just about as likely to hit a<br/>
spec in Oasis nowadays with the folks trying to kill them there.<br/>
<br/>
But as I said, I think the Freeport/Arena thing is pretty much a wash to<br/>
Cazic unless you&#39;re very familiar with the trip from Arena, in which case<br/>
it&#39;s a bit faster.<br/>

&gt; If you come into Feer from rathe mts, chances are good you will<br/>
&gt; need to kill<br/>
&gt; the skelly that spawns at the zone.  I bet a lot of invis newbs<br/>
&gt; really hate<br/>
&gt; him!  Then if you run the zone wall to CT, you will prolly pull a<br/>
&gt; skelly or<br/>
&gt; 2 from their camp.  And then, look out for the Spectres - they are undead<br/>
&gt; and see invis.  Ok so now your invis will help you avoid Flerb or Herb or<br/>
&gt; whoever is bouncin that day - but is it worth all that time?<br/>

&gt; 		If you are bound in Arena then you can&#39;t get a flute.  Or<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; 		you?  If you check the gypsy camp near the entrance to Rathe<br/>
&gt; Mts. from Lake<br/>
&gt; 		Rathe you&#39;ll find that they sell bardic instruments.  If I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; bound in Arena<br/>
&gt; 		and need a flute to get to my corpse, I&#39;ll zone into Rathe<br/>
&gt; Mts. and kill one<br/>
&gt; 		or two lizardman warriors (extrmely green) with my fists and<br/>
&gt; perhaps bellow.<br/>
&gt; 		One or two little lizzies usually nets me enough cash to buy<br/>
&gt; a flute, and<br/>
&gt; 		oftentimes a drum too.  Or even easier, I often have a<br/>
&gt; friend or two there<br/>
&gt; 		at the Lake Rathe/Rathe Mts. zone fighting cyclops and such.<br/>
&gt; I just bum a<br/>
&gt; 		plat off of them.  :-)<br/>

&gt; 		&gt; &gt;Crier, one question I have, because a couple of my<br/>
&gt; guildmates<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; are in CZ and<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; keep bugging me to &quot;Come on Down !&quot;-Do you get bound in<br/>
&gt; Freeport<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; or Arena? I<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; am definately sick of High Keep- and saw my Rogue guild<br/>
&gt; mate shoot from<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; 32-38 in like 2 weeks I think.<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; And how long does it take you to do the corpse run if you<br/>
&gt; are in Freeport?<br/>
