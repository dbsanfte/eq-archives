<div id="ygrps-yiv-167291238">Primal weapons come from The Sleeper&#39;s Tomb.  You may have seen a portal<br/>
with a statue of a sleeping dragon in The Eastern Wastes - hold your key and<br/>
click on this for entry.  Your key? Well, just give Jaled Dar in the Dragon<br/>
Necropoils a talisman you got from killing one of the first brood dragons:<br/>
Klandicar, Zlandicar, Yelinak, Sontalak, Lendaria (sp?) level 70 or so with<br/>
varying degrees of meaness, accesibility and spawn times.   Oya, you (one<br/>
person in the guild at least) gotta do some quest to get a key to open Jaled<br/>
Dar&#39;s door - maybe it was kill Zlandicar? Something to do with Neb&#39;s Warbone<br/>
iirc.  We used to kill Zlandicar then some folks would go off somewhere and<br/>
do something and it would result in another key for Jaled and a Neb&#39;s<br/>
Warbone or something - it&#39;s been a while.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have 24 to 30* of those keys distributed among your level 55 to 60<br/>
players of the classes you deem appropriate for optimum raiding power then<br/>
you can venture into the Sleeper&#39;s Tomb. Oya, you can only enter the tomb by<br/>
key or by rez and the key is not soul bound.  So we would enter, reserve a<br/>
cleric, suicide, rez, loot key & gate - die - zone out, and bank key, rez,<br/>
and then setup for a raid.  The Pantheon, my guild at that time, was the<br/>
first guild on Innoruuk to raid ST and during my times there we cleared down<br/>
to 3 of the 4 warders.  Primal weapons drop off the harder mobs in this<br/>
zone.  And it&#39;s actually a fun zone for the first few times you do it.<br/>
There are some places where you just can&#39;t get singles and your raiding<br/>
party has to fight multiple hard mobs.  Doing it right is a lot of fun.<br/>
Doing it wrong is a total wipe out and a long CR.  <br/>

* ya, ya, some folks went there with 1 group and killed something.  And some<br/>
went with 2 or 3 groups and got some loot.  But the zone is supposed to be<br/>
an event zone that a whole guild raids. Maybe it was supposed to be more<br/>
than that but Verant did not finish it before the power guilds were in there<br/>
and killing stuff.  It has gone thru a series of after-the-fact &quot;nerfs&quot; or<br/>
&quot;buffs&quot; to deal with ways (&quot;exploits&quot;) that players were using to kill stuff<br/>
in there.  An attitude from early on  developed: us vs them - between verant<br/>
and the players.  The game was not to slay dragons but to beat Verant - at<br/>
least for many people and those folks who applied themselves found many ways<br/>
to do just that.  Imho, &quot;exploits&quot; are Verant&#39;s responsibility.  Bad design,<br/>
incomplete testing, poor implementation are all their doing - if they don&#39;t<br/>
want ppl to do something - fix the code that allows them to do it. Otherwise<br/>
players can and will do things to kill the monsters and get the loots.  I<br/>
don&#39;t advocate exploiting - I advocate Verant fixing things in programs.<br/>
But that&#39;s another rant.<br/>

I&#39;m going to admit my naivete and ask what is so hot about primal<br/>
warswords and prismatic swords. Also, are they GM given items? Sounds like<br/>
there&#39;s one primal perserver from the stuff I read.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, can anyone list what gear these uber Bards like AftaThotte have?<br/>
Just curious on this after reading how 60th lvl Bards with Epics are<br/>
drooling over some of this rare equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
