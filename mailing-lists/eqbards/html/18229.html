<div id="ygrps-yiv-298482739">I like helping an occasional beginning character,<br/>
especially if they are playing a bard ... but really<br/>
get tired of people begging.  I was inspired by the<br/>
animated graphic on eqdruids to write this song:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Twink this Beggar Newbie&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh twink this beggar newbie<br/>
The game is much more fun<br/>
When you&#39;ve got a mithril two-han-der<br/>
And you&#39;re only level one<br/>
<br/>
Hey twink this beggar newbie<br/>
It won&#39;t cost you much plat<br/>
He needs to have bronze armor<br/>
so he can kill that bat<br/>
<br/>
Now twink this begger newbie<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want to fight<br/>
Just give him all your money<br/>
and log off for the night!<br/>
<br/>
