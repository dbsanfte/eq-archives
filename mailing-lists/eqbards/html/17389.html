was about 130.  Between 40 and 46, I missed 3 notes in a row<br/>
just twice.  After I got some planes equipment (my first<br/>
planes trip was at 47), my normal dex dropped to 114 I think.  <br/>
Since then, I&#39;ve missed 4 notes in a row two times, and 3<br/>
notes in a row four or five times.<br/>
<br/>
Anecdote is a very statistically unsound form of evidence, but<br/>
I&#39;ve been too busy testing haste/slowdowns lately to test<br/>
missed notes (which are just an annoyance - they don&#39;t really<br/>
have much impact on my effectiveness).<br/>
