Na seriusly when I got my MM drum Tamborine wasent in the game yet. Today I<br/>
do not think I would have bought it. If you do want it I would start asking<br/>
around. I remember I did it and the prices (far ago) was around 1000pp or<br/>
so. I managed to get one for free though :) A friend Camped Mistmore alot :)<br/>
