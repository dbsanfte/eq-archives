<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080775537">Ugh 12 bugged horses at Phini...That happened to us a couple times. Phini <br/>
supposed to have 4 swirlspine seahorse guards up top and 4 swirlspine <br/>
guardians inside his lair. After we killed the regular swirls, we went to <br/>
pull and ended up with at least a dozen guardians + phini. We figured it out <br/>
though - well, what was causing the problem on our server anyways: Previous <br/>
failed attempts, causing the horses to get stuck, and something triggering a <br/>
spawn of additional horses. We called a GM and he reset the zone for us.<br/>

&gt;nothing (until RoK) can possibly compare to a duel-wielding Dojorn.  we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;killed everything in this game many times over, and we have never faced<br/>
&gt;anything nearly as difficult than when Dojo was duel-wielding.  now that <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;a challenge and a lot of fun (and the first and last time i was in sky, i<br/>
&gt;usually never have the time to put in up there).  the only thing that <br/>
&gt;killed<br/>
&gt;me faster (sitting and singing is not a good idea when he gets pulled, ok <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;i wasn&#39;t paying attention i got a 1 1/2 year old) than Dojo that night was<br/>
&gt;when i got a pull of 12 buggy guardians at phin.  not that Inno&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;cakewalk, but i am going with DW Dojo as the toughest =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Combined with his<br/>
&gt; &gt; AE lifetap and buggy pathing, he was actually harder than<br/>
&gt; &gt; Innoruuk (who is widely regarded as the most difficult<br/>
&gt; &gt; god/dragon at the moment).<br/>
