<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968654467">I saw someone mention Guk as a good place to hunt. For the levels infered, I <br/>
assume Upper Guk was meant. If you have hunted the live frogluks in Upper <br/>
Guk and have gotten bad factions with them, you now have a real problem <br/>
getting into Lower Guk at higher levels. You must cross Upper Guk to access <br/>
lower Guk for the undead frogluks (and all the really cool goodies down <br/>
there, like did you ever want to be a dark elf bard?) once you get into the <br/>
30&#39;s levels.<br/>
Our take on upper guk is that it was intented as a evil races dungeon <br/>
primarily since they are born with bad live frogluk factions. A person in <br/>
our guild has that problem and he has to get someone to invis him to get in <br/>
and out, everytime. This sounds simple til you start counting deaths also.<br/>
The only people who must kill live frogs are the hapless paladins, if they <br/>
want to get one of their holy swords, the Ghoulsbane. How do I know this? My <br/>
husband is a L40+ paladin and lives in lower Guk after painstakingly <br/>
doctoring his factions thru getting a ghoulsbane. I do see others in game <br/>
hunting there and the few I have talked to had no idea that lower guk <br/>
existed. This is so far the only split dungeon we have found. So think very <br/>
hard before you hunt upper guk.<br/>
