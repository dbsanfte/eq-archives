Howdy all...<br/>
<br/>
Raub is still level 35.. have had 12 deaths in 35 so far.  Most in Lguk to<br/>
get my mask.  Which I DID get ...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  I have heard about two websites that I would like to have the<br/>
links for.<br/>
<br/>
One lets you put your character together and gives you their stats, the<br/>
other lets you calculate their damage per turn with ceertain weapons on.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone heard of these sites?<br/>
<br/>
Or others like them?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
