<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461225387"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How does an evil race player make this journey?<br/>
&gt; It seems impossible to me. I&#39;ve never been through<br/>
&gt; the Rathetear areas as of yet, so I don&#39;t know if<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s room to run around the Gypsies or not..<br/>
&gt; But from the map I&#39;ve seen, it doesn&#39;t look like<br/>
&gt; there is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Trust me, there&#39;s PLENTY of room. TONS of it. You&#39;d have to specifically<br/>
want to go to the gypsies to hit them. There&#39;s so much space you can go on<br/>
either side of them (between them and the wall, or around the outside).<br/>
<br/>
Rathetear mountains were made to be the route for evil races. =) Besides,<br/>
even if they couldn&#39;t, there&#39;s a good old thing known as invis =)</div>
