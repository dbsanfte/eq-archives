<div id="ygrps-yiv-17560299">The first time I went to check him, I was able to song the faction song (14?) on one of the greens and got<br/>
them all to non-KOS.  But that wasn&#39;t the time I brought the group.  I ended up bringing 6 50-55s and<br/>
screwed it up, aggroing the whole pile on me.  They killed all of them, leaving him for last.  He respawns<br/>
in about an hour, so we just took out the greens as they respawned.  I then used Sneak to get behind him<br/>
and did the trade-in.  You have to kill his Doppleganger, I&#39;m sure you could leave him if you wanted to,<br/>
but what the heck, he&#39;s there and he&#39;s mad.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a more efficient method  :)  You want a<br/>
group because he blinds.  Half of us didn&#39;t see a thing the whole fight.<br/>

&gt; I wanna do this part of the quest soon too... and hoping to haul around the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am finsihing up the easy part of the Bard Epic, and ran into a problem.  I<br/>
&gt; went to find the guy in W Karana who turns into a Doppelganger (Miraz or<br/>
&gt; something).  I found his little band of merry men, and as I approached, they<br/>
&gt; agroed on me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do I have to charm him to give him the note?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DO I have to kill off all his lackey&#39;s first?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In any case, do oyu think a group (6) of 50-54 will have any problem taking<br/>
&gt; them out?<br/>

&gt; Elfson Allegro 51(doh, raided again last night so still haven&#39;t pushed out<br/>
&gt; that last smidge to 52) Veeshan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS.  I don&#39;t know whY i am bothering to do this since I don&#39;t think I will<br/>
&gt; ever be able to finish the quest since I depend on other guilds to take me<br/>
&gt; on dragon raids, thus I will never get the components...  Guess I can say I<br/>
&gt; am half done my Epic Quest :-)<br/>
