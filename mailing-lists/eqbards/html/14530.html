<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486679666"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; To be completely cynical for a minute, I&#39;d argue that the only way to<br/>
&gt; get results from Verant is to be a whiny brat. At least that&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; impression I&#39;m getting from the recent necro nerf. Can you name one<br/>
&gt; other class that Verant has taken something away from then give 6 new<br/>
&gt; spells or abilities to to compensate? No one could possibly claim that<br/>
&gt; the necros presented their case in an adult manner.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you look at the new Necro spellls, they all make the necro more group<br/>
friendly.  I think it&#39;s entirely possible that these ideas and changes have<br/>
been in the works for awhile now.  The pet changes came rather fast.. I<br/>
don&#39;t think they really had the time to make all these spells changes in<br/>
that short of a span.  Look how long it is taking to get our missing songs.<br/>
:)  I think in most cases, Verant does things that are on THEIR agenda, not<br/>
based on the whiney posts.  Sometimes the two coincide...<br/>
<br/>
Bad Verant! for the positive reinforcement!<br/>
