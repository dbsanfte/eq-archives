<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181376127">Hehehe wow someone who knows who FoH is. I play on Veeshan with a lvl 50 <br/>
necro and run in to them ks&#39;ng me all the time on big events. My guild and a <br/>
few others got so sick of it we are banding together. Now FoH posted a <br/>
message on Sony&#39;s message board about how there are so many high lvls on the <br/>
servers that there need to be more planes and more dragons and what not <br/>
cause there is going to be lots of KS&#39;ng and fighting over spawns and what <br/>
not. Man someone finally gets the player base to stand up to them and they <br/>
run whimpering with there tails between their legs. Pay back&#39;s a bi**h. <br/>
Anyways been lurking for a couple days getting ideas just started a twink <br/>
bard and got it up to lvl 7.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Pray that the fallout from your raid is nothing like the one on Prexus.  <br/>
&gt;The<br/>
&gt; &gt; good feelings from the raids (Vox, Nagefen and Fear all went down in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; period of 3 days) quickly turned into animosity, arguments, cries of<br/>
&gt; &gt; elitism, and just plain bad mojo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It already has begun, sir.  People are crying about how they didnt<br/>
&gt;   get invited, and all sorts of crap.  Hell, even someone sh*thead<br/>
&gt;   from FoH posted saying Innoruuk server is a bunch of lame f*cks<br/>
&gt;   if they think beating Cazic means anything big.  FoH is just a bunch<br/>
&gt;   of lame pricks anyway.  Every server has this &#39;lame prick elite&#39;<br/>
&gt;   guild, you just need to avoid them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m really really hoping the landscape changes by the time I get to <br/>
&gt;45+...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s only gonna get worse.  Granted, I&#39;m new to the L50 scene... but<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m one of few L50 bards, so in a way I&#39;m kinda a new L50 in the bard<br/>
&gt;   area, which is lacking on Innoruuk.  So many L50s out there flooding<br/>
&gt;   up things.  Dragons wont live more than 24 hours these days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Harm.<br/>
