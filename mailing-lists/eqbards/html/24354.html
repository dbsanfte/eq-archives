<div id="ygrps-yiv-21302407">Congrats Kenross!!  It is great to finally see a &quot;List&quot; bard get <br/>
one.  We seem to have several 55+ bards on the server but only a few, <br/>
in my opinion, worthy of this epic item ;)<br/>

&gt; I went to New York on business for two weeks.  Within an hour of <br/>
getting<br/>
&gt; into EQ again, my guild gave me a small gift:  a red scale and a <br/>
white<br/>
&gt; scale.  So I managed to finish my Epic Saturday afternoon!  Getting <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; white scale last means you make three trade-ins in a row; pretty<br/>
&gt; nervewracking if you ask me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I knew we had some red scales in our vault.  My guild leader traded <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; Velious haste cloak for the white scale.  I have no idea where he <br/>
found<br/>
&gt; one; I had assumed that every white scale on Innoruuk had been <br/>
sucked up<br/>
&gt; already.  He wasn&#39;t on to say.  I doubt it was from Gorenaire, <br/>
since the<br/>
&gt; only guilds capable of killing Gorenaire have Bards who still need <br/>
them,<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;ve heard nothing about the Scalegiver dropping whites.  Maybe <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; pickup Vox raid.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s very cool.  As a mostly melee Bard (blasphemy to some <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; you, I know), this is a big improvement right across the board.  <br/>
And I<br/>
&gt; actually managed to raise Brass Instruments twice today singing a <br/>
Brass<br/>
&gt; song in combat!<br/>

&gt; 3.5 blue bubbles in 5 hours in Sebilis.  We rocked.<br/>
