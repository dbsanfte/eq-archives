<div id="ygrps-yiv-313394157">Even singing it, if you don&#39;t understand the fundamentals of brass notes,<br/>
you&#39;ll have a hard time with that Discord.  (And it&#39;s MUCH more effective<br/>
with an instrument anyway, don&#39;t bother singing it)  It&#39;s a strangely<br/>
fitting first song for bards to learn their brass skills with.  The whole<br/>
point of the &quot;song&quot; is to make a deafening racket, something easy to do when<br/>
you can hardily play a horn!<br/>
<br/>
Must practice.  Find a quiet, safe place, away from the radius of any<br/>
wandering NPCs--and leave yourself play a few hours.  (Like the schoolchild<br/>
who finds a secluded place to learn their trumpet, away from any wandering<br/>
parents)  I also went to a low level dungeon and just &quot;practiced&quot; on swarms<br/>
of greenies, killing them all.  Just make sure you play it constantly for a<br/>
good long while.  Now, hope you practiced wind, for your new song?<br/>

&gt;I just hit lvl 19 and am still having an EXTREMELY tough time getting<br/>
&gt;Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord to start up and play.  Anyone else have this<br/>
&gt;problem or any ideas as to why I&#39;m having it?<br/>
