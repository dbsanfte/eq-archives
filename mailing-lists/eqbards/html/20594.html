<div id="ygrps-yiv-38199471">You cant have 100 HtH till 30 something.  I believe the formula is lvl+1 *3.<br/>
I stopped punching around 25 or so, since monsters were riposting me for 50+<br/>
damage...<br/>
<br/>
Soloing at 19:  Gorge hounds in East Karana using Denon&#39;s, Chords and Hymm<br/>
with horn and mandolin.  You will also get xp for the big lions there.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, though I would head over to Lake of Ill Omen.  You can find<br/>
plent of solable stuff but even better, almost always find a group there.<br/>
Its like South Karana but musch less crowded (since many more mobs).</div>
