 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re sticking to a drum, then yes, you probably should<br/>
play Chant instead of Anthem.  The stat improvement for the<br/>
two seem to be different, but in my low 20s, Chant was giving<br/>
a greater str boost than Anthem.  Anthem only speeds up your<br/>
attacks by about 10% (I&#39;ve heard 0.3 sec as well).  Chant will<br/>
also give the same boost to dex and give a minor AC boost as<br/>
well.  Without a drum I&#39;d say Anthem is better, but with a<br/>
drum it&#39;s Chant.  I just usually keep Anthem loaded instead<br/>
though because I&#39;m too lazy to switch songs.  :-)  The<br/>
difference is not that great IMHO.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No idea.  Try it and tell us.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If a red mob resists the bellow - is it worth it to try again or does one<br/>

&gt; matter?  Say you see a resist in the top half of his health - so wait til<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s under 50% hp before trying another?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my observations, level matters, but otherwise it&#39;s<br/>
completely random.  There may be some flakiness with the<br/>
random number generator, or some same mobs of the same /con<br/>
can have different magic resists, because the only other trend<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed is that you will get a long string of resists way<br/>
more often than you&#39;d expect if it were truly random.  (This<br/>
is coming from a guy who delved pretty heavily into statistics<br/>
and random processes characterization for his master&#39;s<br/>
thesis.)<br/>
<br/>
So try hitting it with a song 4-5 times.  If they&#39;re *all*<br/>
resisted, then give up.  The only exception is chain, while<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten to stick on reds from 20%-50% of the time.  When<br/>
the mob starts to run, you will want to chain it - it costs<br/>
your spellcasters mana to root it, whereas your chains are<br/>
free so the resists don&#39;t matter to you.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; red to me. Half the reds resisted my bellows consistently.  It didn&#39;t seem<br/>
&gt; like I was contributing much with pierce for 2 points of damage and taking<br/>
&gt; the occasional hit for 32 points of damage. So, I stepped back from the<br/>
&gt; melee and played some songs with instruments.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the group is spreading damage evenly, another thing you can<br/>
do is play Hymn while switching your drum with a lute.  Don&#39;t<br/>
bother to put the second instrument in an inventory slot -<br/>
&quot;hold&quot; it with the mouse, and switch when you change to a song<br/>
that uses a different instruemnt.  This by the way is also how<br/>
you can use DDD, Dissonance, and Hymn with the appropriate<br/>
instrument for each song, and is yet another reason not to use<br/>
the mouse to switch songs.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most of my experience has been with a partner and we both gotta melle.  Or<br/>
&gt; me as tank and 2 casters doing the nuking.  Or full party&#39;s but more<br/>
&gt; co-level and all but the casters are in the melee because we don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; &#39;real&#39; tanks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My enchanter friend hit 29 last night, and with her clarity<br/>
spell, the downtimes were noticably shorter.  Can&#39;t wait til I<br/>
get the clarity song.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So have some fighters with big swords was a new and<br/>
&gt; interesting experience. I spent the whole night in a room full of reds when<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t survive a camp of greens &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, they are both very different fighting styles grouped with<br/>
tanks and grouped with casters.  You could almost think of an<br/>
odd analogy between the two styles and sex...  :-)<br/>
