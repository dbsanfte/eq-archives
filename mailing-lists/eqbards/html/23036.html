Perhaps we should also include how many arguements with loved ones you&#39;ve<br/>
avoided by being far too distracted twisting melodies to even notice<br/>
someone was nagging you.<br/>
<br/>
Or, for those like me who tie up the only phone line in the house, how many<br/>
telemarketing phone calls have you missed?<br/>
