<div id="ygrps-yiv-960939847">I never said it was earth shattering.  I merely am pointing out that people tend<br/>
to exaggerate the facts when they get something put in their head from other<br/>
more vocal people.<br/>
<br/>
and yeah, it was an amazing amount of damage for me compared to how much<br/>
damage i usually do on these things, hehehehe.<br/>

&gt;of many a discussion, but for once in your life admit that someone else<br/>
&gt;is right, and that DDD is utterly and completely worthless.  and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;say PvP.<br/>
