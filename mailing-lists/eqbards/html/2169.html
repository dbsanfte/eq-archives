friend who said she&#39;d already timed how meditation worked.<br/>
She said she normally got a meditation pulse every ~8 eseconds.<br/>
With the jig, she said she got it every ~6 seconds.  This is<br/>
one of the more difficult things to test since you need a<br/>
partner who is as sharp as you are at this type of thing (and<br/>
I&#39;m not sure the cleric was, although she said she was using a<br/>
stopwatch, so...).<br/>
<br/>
My guess as to why people are saying bard songs slow mana<br/>
regen down is because Restoration tends to fill up the health<br/>
bar so quickly, and they&#39;re used to comparing their mana regen<br/>
with their health regen.  Suddenly the health is shooting up<br/>
there while the mana appears to lag behind.<br/>
