<div id="ygrps-yiv-651623502">I have had the lullaby work the same way recently, but it seems to be much more<br/>
rare now.   Perhaps it works on some creatures and not others, based on their AI or<br/>
something.  When fighting Gearheart, for example, putting him to sleep and moving<br/>
away has worked like a charm for me.<br/>

&gt;         The first thing I did when I got this song was to test this very thing.<br/>
&gt; Picking on one of the Splitpaw gnolls in South Karana, I put one to sleep<br/>
&gt; with my song and quickly evacuated the area. I was well clear when it awoke<br/>
&gt; again but it still came after me. Even a quick application of Lament while<br/>
&gt; it nodded was not enough to stop it from chasing me down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I do know that the effect worked as you explain back in beta.<br/>

&gt; The things you have to remember with the lullaby are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; b) This song only makes it forget that it&#39;s mad at you &quot;right now&quot;.  If<br/>
&gt; you are the sort of person that it gets mad at normally, and you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; still around when the song wears off, it will get mad at you again.  If<br/>
&gt; it helps you anyway, think of it as waking up and thinking that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; attacking you for the first time again.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In theory, you should be able to start singing this song, put things<br/>
&gt; around you to sleep, then run away quickly so that when they wake up,<br/>
&gt; they will have forgotten about you and go on their merry way.  In<br/>
&gt; practice, not only for the reasons listed above, this is tricky to<br/>
&gt; achieve.<br/>
