<div id="ygrps-yiv-407037362">Hi, I&#39;m Atonal, another Xegony bard.  I&#39;m in all lambent still (except for<br/>
boots...a guildmate gave me SS boots), course, I&#39;m only 30, creeping up on<br/>
31.  :)  Dalnir&#39;s groups are phenomenal xp.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Bril, I notice you say your Runed Bone Fork is in your range slot?  I<br/>
have one also, but mine only goes in the primary slot?  I&#39;m confused...is<br/>
there more than one RBF?<br/>

Hail Tzeetch! I&#39;m on Xegony too! Brilinnia is my bard&#39;s name, although I&#39;ve<br/>
played this game so long I have 2 alternates: Brilinia (wiz) and Brillinia<br/>
(cleric). There&#39;s several Xegony bards on this list. Glad to have you! What<br/>
guild are you in, or are you? <br/>
Equipment wise, sounds like you need some Hate and HS time. Definitely do<br/>
the tamborine quest, much easier than camping the sharkdrum! Also, try to<br/>
get into Vox/Nag raids before it&#39;s too late!<br/>
I am a patchwork bard but here&#39;s what I use as of last night:<br/>
Head: Hammerhead Helm<br/>
Face: another WW drop here, forgot which one<br/>
Neck: I forgot the exact name, one of those things off the WW dragons that<br/>
have awesome stats.<br/>
Chest: Imbrued<br/>
Arms: SS (had kylong til last weekend, Neero felt sorry for me!)<br/>
Wrists: kylong and hero<br/>
Hands: SS <br/>
Waist: sash of the dragonborn<br/>
Legs: kylong (but I put in an order for some out of WW last night!)<br/>
<br/>
Feet: Imbrued <br/>
Primary: rare dagger off seb jugs (I&#39;m at work, can&#39;t look at equip.)<br/>
Secondary: martune rapier<br/>
Range: Runed bone fork <br/>
Sharkskin drum, gypsy lute, horn<br/>
<br/>
I hate Karnors. Seems to be full of idiots everytime I zone in and I need to<br/>
go camp the warlord for the skull for the epic! Blah!<br/>
<br/>
Brilinnia Ban&#39;Sidhe (yellow and a half to 56, that means about a month?)<br/>
Excalibur, Xegony<br/>
