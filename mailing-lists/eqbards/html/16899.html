<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068800512">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
Desparate Dirge - well I loaded it thinking I might as well since I had an<br/>
open slot (and maybe get the kill shot).  Heh, read thru the log and you<br/>
cans see I should have used Bellow or just whacked him with my 6 Note more.<br/>
Guess I should have had Chains memmed too?  Good thing we had a ranger with<br/>
us &lt;g&gt;.  Also funny to see Inny apparently target one of us then AE nuke and<br/>
take damage from his own spell - heh.<br/>
<br/>
Sunderfury, Beckon and the Wizard&#39;s Diamond wand?  Later the Maestro dropped<br/>
the Erudite Paladin shield.<br/>
<br/>
Uncle Inny goes out for his nightly stroll thru the streets of Hateville...<br/>

I think you can see that we have been despelled and bard songs re-filled the<br/>
first two slots.  Purifyuing & Guardian with MM battle drum on keys 1 and 2.<br/>
3 and 4 had Hymn and Niv&#39;s and you can see my 7 String ready to be swapped<br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
He gets to low health and trys to run...<br/>

I blast him with Dirge and you can see the results - heh.  My songs:  Dirge,<br/>
Purifying, Guardian, Hymn, CoCess, Niv&#39;s, Bind Sight, and Clarity.  Our<br/>
cleric had just gotten healed - it looks like i had switched to hymn/niv&#39;s<br/>
with the lute right before the dirge.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a shot where I scrolled back to get the kill message recorded.<br/>

The guy in the pic is a cleric - wonder if he is offereing Inny a rez for<br/>
100pp?  Arif is a shaman, Bunion a clr, Kuppy a rogue and Nadare enchanter.<br/>
No, that is not a tishan orb (I wish) but Shimmering Orb AC 15.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

&gt; only once since i got this song has it actually helped.  we still all<br/>
died,<br/>
&gt; but it allowed us to get the yak from the lord before we were all gone.<br/>
it<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Shada Powa, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; However, IMO, it was still a waste of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time because<br/>
&gt; &gt; as others have pointed out, the song is way underpowered for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hassle<br/>
&gt; &gt; it involves. They may as well have made the song make the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bard blow up,<br/>
&gt; &gt; killing everything around him, for all the good it usually does. </span></blockquote></div>
