<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192753365">Hi Janko and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Bards are quite useful - the people you disagreed with don&#39;t understand<br/>
bards.  Even us bards need to learn lots of things to understand how to best<br/>
play our class.  But right off the bat - you can buff them with chant of<br/>
battle and give everyone in the party more ability to attack and kill the<br/>
mobs you are fighting.  Young level players who are new to the whole thing<br/>
do not yet under stand the importance of stats like str, dex, agi.  Even as<br/>
we get older - we are constantly trying to balance and improves these stats.<br/>
Your songs do it magically.<br/>
<br/>
You can give the whole party a great DEX boost with Chant of Battle - and if<br/>
they think a lev 5 bard is not needed in the melee combat - good then you<br/>
stand back and use your drum and chant of battle and give them even better<br/>
buff.  If there are monks in the group they will be amazed and love you.<br/>
<br/>
Go off and kill gnolls and stuff and get level 6 for your heal song and then<br/>
they will be singing a different tune and you will be playing it &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome again and keep us posted on how you are doing,<br/>
