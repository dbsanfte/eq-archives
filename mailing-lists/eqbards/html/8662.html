<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552035207">Some guy (Valton? - anonymous) was hopping back and forth between Oasis and<br/>
S Ro last night shouting in classic kewl dOOd (I&#39;m surprised my language<br/>
skill was high enough to make it out - not the brightest HEF to fall off the<br/>
tree stand) that he was looking for SGs. Later he was auctioning a lambent<br/>
stone! I didn&#39;t query him, so don&#39;t know if he actually had one or was<br/>
selling loot rights (if No Drop). Anyway, assuming he was not a bard &lt;g&gt; it<br/>
appears that other classes are already aware of the value of these new<br/>
stones and are attempting to profit from their seeming low supply.<br/>

&gt; &gt; called the wife.  out of the 3 basalt gargoyles in the spider hall, one<br/>
&gt; &gt; dropped a basalt carapace her first pull.  out of the shin ghoul knights<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bedroom, one dropped the shin greaves.  i am liking this so far.<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bad news.  7 sand giants, 5 Griffins, 3 Hill Giants and NO lambent<br/>
&gt; &gt; stones.  argh.  i told her to petition and make sure they are in the<br/>
game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got a lambent stone off the only hill giant I found all night (I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; kidding!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also got both runes from the clops brothers in WK.  (Choon and<br/>
&gt; Proon(?) with the top of the rune of the one eye and middle of the rune<br/>
&gt; of the one eye respectively)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now my question is... how hard are the Solusek Mage and Solusek<br/>
&gt; Champion?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any info appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the above items are Lore and Nodrop.  An interesting if frustrating<br/>
&gt; thing is that the runes of the one eye are COMPLETELY identical in<br/>
&gt; appearance and name, but different items.<br/>
