<div id="ygrps-yiv-107408070">I&#39;m interested in the binding song...and I agree that it is unlikely to be<br/>
approved.  However, here&#39;s my 2 cp:<br/>
<br/>
14 level is an appropriate level to be able to bind.  This matches the classes<br/>
that can bind, as clerics are the last to get it at 14th.<br/>
<br/>
The magic model for the Bard class is for us to have prettty much one or two of<br/>
each type of spell.  We have a little speed, DoT, teleport, DD, Heal, etc.  The<br/>
only powers we dont have are lifetap or bind.  I don&#39;t think lifetap fits with<br/>
the Bardic image, so bind looks good.<br/>
<br/>
The other hybrids don&#39;t get bind...but we aren&#39;t really a hybrid class.  Each<br/>
other hybrid is a warrior/specific magic class.  As a result, they get magic<br/>
plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all other<br/>
hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told, then perhaps we can get a<br/>
pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, bind would be my vote...<br/>
