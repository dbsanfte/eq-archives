<div id="ygrps-yiv-186126732">I never use hide (invis song instead) and usually only forage after I have<br/>
died.  I hate the &quot;you are low on food/water&quot; spams you get all the time<br/>
while running back to your corpse.  I succeed so rarely with forage that I<br/>
tend to forget about trying it in between combats.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I think it would be interesting to get a list poll up to see how many<br/>
&gt; bards on the list actually use forage or hide, or even have them in<br/>
&gt; their hotkeys. We&#39;d have to have a seperate section for wood elf bards<br/>
&gt; as the wood elf natural cap is actually 10 higher than the default<br/>
&gt; bard&#39;s (hmm, another contradiction to the jack of foraging idea)<br/>
