&gt;Can you show me an example with your above formula to show how the <br/>
&gt;penalty would be moved?  I&#39;m don&#39;t grasp the concept you&#39;re stating <br/>
&gt;with just the formula.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have time to figure out the multipliers cuz i suck, but let me reword it a little using a human bard<br/>
and a human cleric as an example.<br/>
<br/>
previously:<br/>
<br/>
Bard_Exp_gained = Base_exp - 0.4*Base_exp<br/>
Cleric_Exp_gained = Base_exp<br/>
<br/>
This would normalize exp tables and (just pulling numbers out of my butt) allow one experience table where<br/>
both the bard and the cleric could level at 100000 experience points.<br/>
<br/>
The proposed change would do this:<br/>
<br/>
Bard_Exp_gained = Base_exp - 0.4*Base_exp + 0.4*Base_exp<br/>
<br/>
This would give the bard exactly the same exp as the cleric.<br/>
BUT if you also add a 40% death penalty to this, he will NOT arrive at the predeath exp at the<br/>
same time as the cleric, it will take 40% longer.<br/>
<br/>
This is where the other guy is coming from.  It really depends on how they implemented levelling.<br/>
If the level check uses 20 different experience tables then it&#39;s fine the way they propose.  If they<br/>
adjust exp on the fly and use 1 normalized experience table then they have just moved the penalty,<br/>
although lessened it, depending on how often you die and how often you get a rez.</div>
