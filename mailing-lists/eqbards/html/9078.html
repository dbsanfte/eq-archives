&gt;I think the game mechanism that creates bard hate is centered around the <br/>
&gt;type of music the bard sings.  My bard tends to focus on alternative rock <br/>
&gt;and traditional blues while adventuring.  I have a gut feeling that most <br/>
&gt;mobs in the game prefer hip-hop or country western music.  As a direct <br/>
&gt;result, they tend to dislike it when I&#39;m singing my songs and focus all <br/>
&gt;their energy on making me<br/>
&gt;stop.<br/>

Until recently I was the subject of many &quot;bard hate&quot; episodes where monsters <br/>
would go out of their way to run over and smack on me, despite being in <br/>
conflict with someone else not in my group... often despite my not playing a <br/>
song (except for Selo&#39;s Accelerando - is THAT a taunt too???) or taking any <br/>
other action that I would expect to anger said monsters.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, however, I picked up some classic rock and folk to mix in with my <br/>
primarily r&b and jazz sets, and I find that it seems to please many <br/>
monsters.  Griffawns become very laid-back if you play &quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot; <br/>
by Steve Miller, and I was amazed when almost half the gnolls of BlackBurrow <br/>
joined in on the chorus to the Beatles&#39; &quot;Help!&quot;  Oddly, the Crushbone Orcs, <br/>
who once attacked me on sight, now ignore me peacefully if I play &quot;Dueling <br/>
Banjos&quot; from &quot;Deliverance&quot; - must be that line about squealing like a pig...<br/>

&gt;I actually think part of &quot;bard hate&quot; comes from a coding error (theory <br/>
&gt;only). If I am playing heal and a mob runs through our group getting pulled <br/>
&gt;to another group, I will get all the Faction +/-&#39;s for that mob being <br/>
&gt;killed. I think this was because in Beta the bards songs affected everyone <br/>
&gt;(grouped or not) within a certain radius. I think this area effect code is <br/>
&gt;still in the game but with an additional check (i.e. in radius + in group) <br/>
&gt;for PC&#39;s but for aggro mobs I think they effectively get &quot;hit&quot; by our songs <br/>
&gt;(thus we get those faction hits for mobs we never touched). Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm this seems a good explanation for why I occasionally get faction hits <br/>
for monsters I ran past but never engaged.<br/>
<br/>
Along these lines, a warning: DO NOT LEAVE A SONG RUNNING IF YOU ARE <br/>
STANDING NEXT TO AN NPC AND GO AFK.  A few days ago I was in Freeport and <br/>
waiting for the boat.  Like many bards, I prefer to leave my songs running <br/>
almost all the time, and I was idly playing Selo&#39;s Accelerando.  I noticed a <br/>
lot of people were gathering around Olunea Milton (sp?), the fisherwoman on <br/>
the docks.  Luckily, I guessed in time what they planned, and stopped my <br/>
song before they attacked and brutally slew her... who knows what outrageous <br/>
faction hits we bards could take for standing near a friendly NPC that some <br/>
k3wld00d decides to kill for l00t.<br/>
