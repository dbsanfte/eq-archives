65.  I have an almost-complete set of banded mail - missing<br/>
only the neck (order of thunder) and face (snakeskin mask).<br/>
With my armor, all my instruments, a combine rapier (5 lbs), a<br/>
staff (5 lbs), 40 shurikens (1 lb), a backpack (3 lbs) and<br/>
food, I top out at 49/65 pounds.<br/>

I have found being encumbered to not be that big a deal.  It<br/>
slows down your running speed, but hey you have a song which<br/>
lets you run faster.  It lowers your agility (and thus AC) in<br/>
combat, but hey both the Anthem and Whistling Warsong buff<br/>
your strength thus unencumbering you.<br/>
