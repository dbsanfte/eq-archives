<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294433144"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I finally made 20th level yesterday. I was wondering if you have any ideas for a good<br/>
&gt; surname. I figured ya&#39;ll had probably seen, or thought about it a lot more<br/>
&gt; than I have. I was thinking of using Windsong. Suggestions?<br/>
&gt; Skarsol<br/>
&gt; Bard of the 20th song<br/>
&gt; Cazic Thule<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I like it if it gets by the censors :)<br/>
  Anyway, I haunt this board in my role of &quot;Sage&quot; of Bards for the House<br/>
of the Rising Phoenix guild in Cazic-Thule, charged with helping Bards<br/>
where ever and when ever I find them. I have a synopsis of Hints,<br/>
stories, armor and weapons boiled down into a 30 page Word Doc and<br/>
useful Bardic links. <br/>
<br/>
  Give Moonflower Bllue ( a Chicago Blues singer with a voice that will<br/>
scrape the paint off a garbage truck)<br/>
  an In Game &quot;tell&quot;. Anyway I can help, I will :)<br/>
