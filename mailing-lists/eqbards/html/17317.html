<div id="ygrps-yiv-793907958"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Bear in mind that 99.9% of the games out there do not take<br/>
&gt; advantage of the GeForce&#39;s improved hardware (transformation<br/>
&gt; and lighting is still handled by the CPU).  This includes EQ.  <br/>
&gt; While a GeForce will give you a moderate speedup over a TNT2,<br/>
&gt; it will not give you the huge boost in speed you see in some<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here I would DEFINATELY disagree... sorry.  Why? Because my brother <br/>
in law has the same setup with a TNT2 and my wife has the same setup <br/>
with a Voodoo 3 3500.  I can do things with my GeForce at 1024X768 <br/>
that they can&#39;t hope to achieve at 640x480.  There is a HUGE <br/>
performance increase that is VERY noticable if you have your <br/>
computers side by side as I do.  Let&#39;s take a 24 person raid on Kedge <br/>
Keep as an example.  Chat off, particle density off, same setup on <br/>
all 3 computers and they were both lagging and had much much lower <br/>
frame rates at 800X600 then I.  I was as smooth at 1024x768 as I <br/>
would have been had I been the only one in the zone.</div>
