<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074025997">While in an external view during a battle for a screenshot, I<br/>
noticed something.  It seems to me the song graphics show up a<br/>
fraction of a second before the text message (last night I was<br/>
having an atypical 280 ms ping time).  I suspect what&#39;s going<br/>
on is that the graphics are drawn based on a client-side<br/>
timer, while the text messages are sent by the server.  So the<br/>
slight difference is just the time it takes for the server<br/>
message to get to you.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned before that I usually use the song graphics<br/>
pulsing to tell me to switch to my next song.  Some time ago,<br/>
I also said I thought our songs weren&#39;t lasting quite as long<br/>
as before, yet when I timed it I found no difference.  Well<br/>
now that I think about it, I started getting this impression<br/>
about the time I turned particle density off and began using<br/>
the text messages to tell me when to switch songs.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe this is why I was able to weave 4 songs?<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of weaving 4 songs, I&#39;m starting to wonder if JM<br/>
Capozzi was correct when he said our DoTs last for 10 seconds,<br/>
pulsing 4 times at 2.5 second intervals.  I disagreed with him<br/>
because if you start/stop Accelerando, the boot icon (and<br/>
effect) lasts from 12-18 seconds.  However, the latest test I<br/>
ran with weaving Clarity (the effect began to taper off when I<br/>
weaved it with 2 other songs) points to its duration being<br/>
somewhere between 7-11 seconds.  I suspect what&#39;s going on is<br/>
that some effects (Accelerando, see invis, etc.) are entirely<br/>
client-side.  These will last 12-18 seconds (depending on when<br/>
you started the song in the 6-second &quot;heartbeat&quot; cycle).  <br/>
Others (Clarity, DoTs?, Hymn?) are server-side and quite<br/>
possibly could last only 10 seconds (which you can&#39;t really<br/>
see since the client only updates every 6 seconds).<br/>
