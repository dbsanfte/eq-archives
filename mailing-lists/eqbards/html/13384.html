<div id="ygrps-yiv-832123071">Well, the Meditate skill is pretty sweet.  Didn&#39;t even have to zone for it<br/>
to work (read somewhere that we would have to zone for it to kick in the<br/>
first time).  Also noticed crocs (blue to me at 17) in Lake Rathe, and heard<br/>
of froglocks there too... generic ones that fight (and get the snot beat out<br/>
of them by) the resident DW gobbies.  Also noticed this interesting<br/>
tidbit... you can no longer consume vast amounts of alcohol.  Once you get<br/>
to your... uhm... &quot;drunkenness limit&quot;, you now get a message saying &quot;You<br/>
could not possibly consume more alcohol or get any more intoxicated!&quot;.<br/>
Also, you get skill increases even when drunk now (maybe it was the fact<br/>
that I was using Elven Wine, but I was able to get my Tolerance skill from 2<br/>
to 45 with 60 jugs of wine... seems to be speeded up a bit)<br/>
Anyone else notice any other hidden things?</div>
