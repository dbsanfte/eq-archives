<div id="ygrps-yiv-497916214">Since we figured on talking about stupid deaths, here is what I did. Being<br/>
the adventurous fool that I am, I decided to climb the wizard teleport<br/>
spires in North Karana.  Being the wood elf that I am I climbed to the top<br/>
of the spire quite easily and proceeded to sit down while I waited for my<br/>
friends to arrive.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I forgot about the z-axis attack ability of mobs, so I left to<br/>
get a snack and I return to find myself under attack by a griffawn that<br/>
someone trained on me.  So quickly I stand up proceed to begin running.<br/>

Oh yeah I fell to my death.  Boy did I feel stupid.<br/>
