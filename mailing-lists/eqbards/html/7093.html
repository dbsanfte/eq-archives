&gt; Here was the original message I replied to:<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a result, [hybrids] get magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; plus superior battle skills.  Since our battle skills are less than all<br/>
&gt; &gt; other hybrids...really on par with clerics if truth be told,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then perhaps we can get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; pure caster attribute like bind to make up for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, instead of arguing about the battle worthness of a Bard I should have<br/>
&gt; just used your own argument against you.  The level 14 song was a pure<br/>
&gt; caster type song.  Only pure casters got the identify spell.  You felt that<br/>
&gt; bards needed a pure caster type song, and you already had it.  Happy now?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If any class (Bards for example) get binding, there will be a major uproar<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t write that.  :-)  I am absolutely against bards<br/>
getting bind.  The only thing I was arguing for in this line<br/>
of discussion is that our defensive melee skills need to be<br/>
increased a bit.<br/>
