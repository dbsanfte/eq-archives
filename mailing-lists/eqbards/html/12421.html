<b>Subject:</b> Shards message board site (was  Mistmoore raid (E&#39;ci server)) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055632089">I read about the MM event on the E&#39;ci board at the Shards website.<br/>

<br/>
For the rest of you out there who were not aware of this website, the Shards<br/>
website provides message boards for each server in EQ, similar to EQVault.<br/>
The good thing about the site is that hardly anyone knows about it so it<br/>
allows a core group of players to form a close community.  I think the E&#39;ci<br/>
board is the only one that actually ever gets used.  The other server boards<br/>
have little to no traffic.  Message traffic on the Shards E&#39;ci board is<br/>
actually greater than that on the EQvault E&#39;ci board.  Just passing this<br/>
link along in case you and your friends want to start using it.  For E&#39;ci,<br/>
almost all server events like Planes and Dragon raids are coordinated on the<br/>
Shards board.  <br/>
<br/>
This has been a public service announcement.<br/>

&gt; Plus I&#39;m in South Karana.  I&#39;d need<br/>
&gt; a teleport.  Who schedules these things anyway?  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; For the E&#39;ci bards:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yesterday I posted about an event I&#39;m trying to schedule in Mistmoore.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thats still in the works.  Wanted to let all the E&#39;ci bards know that<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a raid scheduled tonight in Mistmoore (6PM PST).  Bextrii is running<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; and if you don&#39;t know her she knows a lot about conducting raids in MM.<br/>
&gt; If<br/>
&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t have a gypsy lute yet, tonight would be a good opportunity for<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get one for free (assuming bards camping the castle don&#39;t need one).<br/>
