<div id="ygrps-yiv-101478102">To me here&#39;s the problem: Post 50; to go to most dungeon locations - it&#39;s<br/>
impossible without both a Cleric and Enchanter.  How many times have you had<br/>
a group together in say Sebilis - and didn&#39;t go deeper because you didn&#39;t<br/>
have the right classes?<br/>
<br/>
IMHO - this is a terrible flaw of EQ and needs to be rectified.  Improving<br/>
Crowd Control capabilities of Bards helped; and improving healing for<br/>
Shamans and Clerics could be another.  Perhaps there are other better ways<br/>
that don&#39;t involved &quot;nerfing&quot; clerics indirectly...<br/>

I really wouldn&#39;t want to see Shamans and, especially, Druids get better<br/>
healing.  The thrust of a lot of<br/>
these letters seems to be that a single Druid or a single Shaman should have<br/>
enough healing to stand in<br/>
for a Cleric, with maybe some downtime tradeoff.  I really can&#39;t agree with<br/>
that.  If that were the case,<br/>
what would be the point of a Cleric?  What most people don&#39;t bother noticing<br/>
is that any combination of<br/>
two of the other healing classes is already quite sufficient (with the<br/>
exception of rez).<br/>
Shaman/Druid/Paladin, put any two in a party and you&#39;re pretty much good to<br/>
go.  There&#39;s a ton of Druids<br/>
out there, the problem is that most of them don&#39;t want to or don&#39;t know how<br/>
to heal.  That won&#39;t get fixed<br/>
by giving them more healing.<br/>
