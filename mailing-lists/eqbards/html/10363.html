You are confused a bit mixing in the natural regen rate here.  At 12 you get<br/>
8 pts per pulse with lute while sitting total.  That&#39;s 6 from Hymn plus 2<br/>
natural.  At 18th you get 10 per pulse sitting total, again 8 from Hymn plus<br/>
2 natural.  Your sitting regen rates increases past 2 after 20th level, not<br/>
sure exactly when but I know it goes up to 3 natural regen somewhere soon on<br/>
or after 20th.  <br/>
Using my formula for lute of (1hp + 1hp/6lvls)*2 means at 12 hymn should do<br/>
6, it does; at 18th it should do 8, again it does.  It does half that much<br/>
without lute so you get at 12th level Hymn for 3, plus 1 natural so 4.  At<br/>
18 it would be 4 plus 1 natural so 5.  These both fit the actual result so<br/>
the equation is correct.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;More simply put, Hymn starts at 6 per pulse at 6th level (but you&#39;d get two<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same as you get with my equation, Hymn does 4pt at 6th, plus the 2 for<br/>
sitting = 6.<br/>
