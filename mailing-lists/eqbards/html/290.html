<div id="ygrps-yiv-946269673">For the most part the effect starts on the first pulse when you see the<br/>
song message. If you successfully stack 3 songs then it just goes<br/>
continuously as if you were playing only that song. The only exception I&#39;ve<br/>
found to this is Bellow. I&#39;ve had a number of different times where I end<br/>
the song before I get the damage message (thinking &#39;crap, too soon!&#39;)and the<br/>
message comes up afterward. Granted I&#39;m talking about a fraction of a second<br/>
here but I&#39;ve had that happen with no other song.<br/>
<br/>
	Might be from lag though...<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>

Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I decided to test the pulse effect over the weekend.<br/>
The two songs I looked at are Chrods of Dissonance, Hymn of<br/>
Restoration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My Bard is just 11th Level. There is a possibility that these tests<br/>
were conducted when my Bard was 10th, I went 10th -&gt; 11th -<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;10th-&gt;11th a lot(it sucked).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Starting with Hymn:<br/>
This was easy to test. Go out a fight a mob so you lose hit Points.<br/>
Once the mob is killed start the healing song, wait for the message<br/>
you wounds begin to heal, then start any other song, switch to you<br/>
stats and you will get another 2 pulses of healing effect.<br/>
<br/>
This was only tested using a lute.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now Chords :<br/>
For this I needed a friend to duel with. Thanks goes to Grak the<br/>
Troll that feels no pain  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I tested this first with a lute. I asked Grak to look at his hits and<br/>
any time they drop type x. I started up Chords and as soon as I got<br/>
the &quot;Grak winces&quot; message I started another song.<br/>
<br/>
Grak typed<br/>
x<br/>
x<br/>
x<br/>
<br/>
The first 2 x&#39;s did 7 damage, the last one I think did 7 but may have<br/>
done 1/2 of 7.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now without a lute, Grak typed<br/>
x<br/>
x<br/>
The first x did 6 damage, the second did 3 damage. Interesting?<br/>
<br/>
Next what I want to look at is when do the pulse songs become<br/>
active. Normally when juggling I wait for the wince, heal message<br/>
before changing to another song. I wonder if the song becomes<br/>
active for 1 pulse if you change before the message.<br/>
