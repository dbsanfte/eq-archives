&gt; &gt; Have you tried getting out of Oasis? I think that is one of the more<br/>
&gt; &gt; boring places to hunt, at least if you&#39;re killing crocs. What level are<br/>
&gt; &gt; you now? Have you tried any other places where pickup groups are<br/>
&gt; &gt; relatively easy to find?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am actively looking to get out of Oasis. I&#39;ve pinged a couple other bards<br/>
&gt; at twentieth or near twentieth level to see what they were up to. Most were<br/>
&gt; either in KFC, or considering Unrest, a few were also in Lake Rathe hitting<br/>
&gt; the Aviak tower. When I was in Upper Guk last night I would have loved to<br/>
&gt; stay there but the only group of people I could find were part of a guild<br/>
&gt; out. They were nice, but they were not letting me in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

(thought it was this list) but I still recommend Unrest around 20. Yes,<br/>
it&#39;s a train nightmare, but it&#39;s also a good place to meet people and<br/>
get pickup groups, or it was on my server. Slowly, through grouping with<br/>
people there, you should be able to build up a collection of friends you<br/>
will be able to group with on a regular basis. If you&#39;re a wood elf, you<br/>
will also get the added benefit of picking up some bronze plate, if you<br/>
haven&#39;t bought it all already.<br/>
<br/>
Another place my druid found quite good was the aviak village. I found<br/>
it relatively easy to get a group there as well and met some good people<br/>
too. Unfortunately I ended up outleveling the first group of people I<br/>
found but luckily I ran into my current group of friends in a pickup<br/>
group in cazic thule at L25.<br/>
