<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926259717">What might be even more hilarious is if some of us could act as shepards,<br/>
get some gnome enchanter up to 4th level so we could invis everyone.  A huge<br/>
party of gnomes wandering across Norrath disappearing and reappearing at<br/>
random would be hysterical.  We could all stay entirely silent to requests<br/>
of &quot;what are you doing?&quot; and just see how many people we could get to follow<br/>
us.  As we leap into the lava we can all scream<br/>
&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s the entrance to the Temple of Solusek Ro?&quot;<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m in, refresh my memory when it is supposed to happen.<br/>
&gt; Which server, what time, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a lot of people missed it due to high list activity yesterday, if<br/>
so here&#39;s a report. So far I hadn&#39;t got as far as picking a server or<br/>
time/date. My initial post was just floating a balloon to see if anyone<br/>
was interested. As to server/time, if there&#39;s enough interest, I will<br/>
try to coordinate a time that is most convenient to all who want to<br/>
attend. Server wise, if someone is in a guild that would like to host<br/>
the event and provide lemming support (binding, resses for gnomes that<br/>
die along the way, etc, we will hold it there, otherwise, I&#39;ll just pick<br/>
one of the lesser used servers (heh, maybe a race war server)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the original post.<br/>

I was wondering if enough people on the list would be interested for it<br/>
to be worth organising a gettogether on one of the servers. As obviously<br/>
we couldn&#39;t do much serious adventuring with L1 characters for those<br/>
visiting from other server, I thought the alternative would be to do<br/>
something silly.<br/>
  <br/>
About the silliest (and fun looking) thing I&#39;ve seen done so far is the<br/>
naked troll race. While I wouldn&#39;t want to steal that particular idea, I<br/>
think borrowing the concept is ok, so what I had in mind was something<br/>
called the March of the Lemmings. The idea would be to all create L1<br/>
gnomes and march all across Faydwer, take the boat to Freeport, then go<br/>
up to Lavastorm and jump off the edge of the Solusek crater into the<br/>
molten lava. However, if someone can come up with a sillier or less<br/>
derivitive idea, I&#39;m certainly open to that as well.<br/>
  <br/>
Anyone interested? How many people are on the list now? Maybe we should<br/>
put up a poll to see who would come.<br/>
