&gt;   Well all the tools I&#39;ve seen to analyze the spells conclude that<br/>
&gt;   chains and shiftless deeds are equivalent in the attack speed<br/>
&gt;   amount, and togors falls a little behind them.  This just isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   the case.  With togors/shiftless on an npc, I can count seconds<br/>
&gt;   before they attempt to swing.  With chains, it&#39;s kinda like a <br/>
&gt;   small visual decrease but nothing fancy.  Chains is nice for <br/>
&gt;   the mobility effect, but can be outdone by other atkspeed spells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chain (and Largo&#39;s) is a 30% slowdown.  Mob attacks go from<br/>
3.0 seconds to 3.9 seconds.  I&#39;ve timed this 4 or 5 times<br/>
(people keep insisting it doesn&#39;t slow attacks, or it slows by<br/>
more, or that the two stack, and I retest it in case it&#39;s been<br/>
changed :).  I haven&#39;t timed Torgors, but subjectively I&#39;d put<br/>
it at close to 100% (i.e. attacks take twice as long).<br/>
<br/>
The champ by far is Mort Drowsy.  I&#39;d estimate it as a 400%<br/>
slowdown *and* it&#39;s area effect.  Makes Mortuary Fungi a great<br/>
pet to charm against melee mobs.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why ice giants?  So far, all the mobs I&#39;ve seen, unless they<br/>
have a weapon or are buffed, swing once every 3.0 seconds.<br/>
It&#39;s far easier to test it on level 1 mobs that can&#39;t double<br/>
attack.  Just let it beat on you, chain/torgors it, and time<br/>
how long it takes between hits.  Or duel a shaman/enchanter<br/>
and time your own swings.<br/>
