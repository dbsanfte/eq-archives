<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750772367">Not true.  The Supreme Court has long upheld that private establishments may<br/>
not refuse service to people on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, age,<br/>
or beliefs.  They have long ago expanded this to include exercise of one&#39;s<br/>
right of Free Speech. (The &quot;Fire!&quot; exclusion not included).<br/>
<br/>
There are exceptions to this naturally.<br/>
<br/>
In one notable case in point in Florida, a man was refused service in a<br/>
prominent restaurant because he wrote a controversial column in a local<br/>
magazine.  The man sued the restaurant and lost, but was upheld on appeal to<br/>
the federal district court of appeals on the basis of discrimination.  The<br/>
argument on the side of the restaurant was that having the man as a customer<br/>
offended their other customers because they knew what he had written and<br/>
that writing offended them.  The court upheld that this was not sufficient<br/>
reason to bar him from an otherwise public place, nor to refuse him service.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could remember the exact case from my law class but unfortunately<br/>
that was 12 years ago.<br/>

Actually, Free Speech says that the government cannot prevent you from<br/>
speaking.  It has nothing to do with private enterprise or personal<br/>
communications.<br/>
<br/>
It means that the law cannot be used to stop you from voicing your<br/>
opinions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a common misconception that Free Speech means that in America the law<br/>
says that you must be allowed to say anything in any place.<br/>

Hopefully someone has posted this to the FAC board.  They are a group that<br/>
actively fights First Amendment Abridgements pro bono.  I can&#39;t find the<br/>
link or I would post it myself.  Obviously Verant has never heard of Larry<br/>
Flynt or they probably would have taken a different course in this case.<br/>
