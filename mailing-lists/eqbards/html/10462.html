<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560743502">Glad to see it worked as well for you!  I was there too this weekend on<br/>
E&#39;ci, helping a lower level ranger in our guild get some cash.  I just stood<br/>
and played Melodic Binding and Lullaby while she solo&#39;d the raiders.  An<br/>
interesting note for lullaby, while victims apprently break out immediately<br/>
all too often, it works really well with players who have weapons with high<br/>
delay.  The ranger was using her 2hdd sword and I&#39;d nod the raider who would<br/>
miss at least one attack while the ranger was between attacks.  Also, misses<br/>
would not wake the raider up, so sometimes she could swing freely 2-3 times<br/>
while the raider just stood there waiting to be hit.  Very effective even<br/>
with only one mob when the delay time of the party is very high.  Also works<br/>
to keep them from running briefly.  They nod and stop running until you hit<br/>
them again.  If they would fix the annoying instant breakout problem this<br/>
spell would be awesome, as it is its still good, just unreliable which can<br/>
be too dangerous to use in some situations where it would be helpful.<br/>

Kitasi, thanks for the suggestion below! I took on the raiders yesterday and<br/>
got about 60pp for three hours work. That included dying twice to casters<br/>
due to lag (it was horrible Sunday!) and once due to a big newbie error.<br/>
<br/>
Big lesson: Don&#39;t sit to memorize Carrillon in the druid ring! The druids<br/>
con amiably, but that doesn&#39;t help when a grizzly wanders by. One paw swipe<br/>
is all it takes to make you an affront to everything the druids (and two<br/>
treants) stand for. I made it about 50 feet from the ring...<br/>

I have a suggestion if you want to earn mega-cash very quickly.  The<br/>
raider camp in the se corner of N Karana is fantastic for a bard of your<br/>
level.  At 19 I can solo the camp and cannot keep it cleared, using lament<br/>
to pull the bandits out one or two at a time.  The bandit wizards and druids<br/>
can be a tough fight, but the humans and barbs are easy.  You can get bronze<br/>
weapons off the humans as well as red bandit sashes.  The red bandit sashes<br/>
are a great money maker.  You turn them in to Chesgard in S Qeynos for the<br/>
bounty.  With Carillion the bounty is 5-15gp, and a bronze weapon or round<br/>
shield worth another 15-33gp.  All in all 2-5p per sash plus a smidgen of<br/>
xp.  Add in a bronze rapier and you can get as much as 9pp off one green<br/>
human bandit.  I made 50pp there two nights ago in about an hour.  I usually<br/>
average closer to 30pp an hour there, but I had some fortuitous spawns with<br/>
more bronze than usual.<br/>
<br/>
