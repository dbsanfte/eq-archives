<b>Subject:</b> Trying out Asheron&#39;s Call (Way off topic but I had to post this) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-653023100">Heya everybody!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not quitting EQ (yet) but Asheron&#39;s call is my number 1 game if my RL<br/>
friends aren&#39;t logged into EQ.  Thought I&#39;d share this with ya&#39;ll.  I know<br/>
it&#39;s WAY Off Topic but I thought I would share.  I know some of my fellow<br/>
bards are just as frustrated as I was with EQ so I thought I&#39;d post this<br/>
very viable alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I tried out Asheron&#39;s Call beta and really hated it.  The graphics<br/>
sucked, the interface was kludgy etc.  So when final came along I didn&#39;t get<br/>
the game.  I was totally un-impressed.  Needless to say my tune has changed<br/>
now.  I tried it out this past two weeks while I was on a business trip...<br/>
All I can say is &quot;I&#39;m impressed&quot;.  I&#39;m not going to go into all the nitty<br/>
gritty but I&#39;ll post some of my impressions that I got from the past 2<br/>
weeks....<br/>
<br/>
1)  Better support.  The GM&#39;s and Advocates (guides) really care about their<br/>
players.  They respond very quickly compared to ours (EQ).<br/>
2)  Better support.  They post regular updates as to what&#39;s been fixed, why<br/>
it was fixed and what to expect from it.<br/>
3)  Better support.  They listen to the players.  Usually when a bug is<br/>
reported it&#39;s fixed by the next patch, if not the one after.  There&#39;s not a<br/>
single bug left in the game that was reported from beta (*cough*)<br/>
4)  Amazing landscape graphics!  The graphics are much better than EQ for<br/>
scenery.  I was stunned.  The sun looks like the sun, not a big yellow ball<br/>
in the sky.  Night time is a sky full of stars with the moons in the sky.<br/>
Better than that dark blue sky with a big white ball in the sky ;)<br/>
5)  Combat interface is more realistic<br/>
6)  Graphics for characters/npc&#39;s aren&#39;t quite as good as EQ but they&#39;re<br/>
improving those now too.<br/>
7)  A _truely_ dynamic world.  Events occur regularly that involve the<br/>
entire playerbase.  Everyone has an impact upon the world around them.<br/>
Allegiances (Guilds) can even form Kingdoms, laws etc.<br/>
8)  Ability to truely customize your character.  A Skill system similar to<br/>
role master or AD&D Revision 3.  Rather than the &#39;cookie cutter&#39; classes<br/>
like original AD&D you have a set of skills to choose from which allow you<br/>
to make a truely unique character.<br/>
9)  Ability to customize your character&#39;s appearance.  About 100 different<br/>
varieties of faces.  Can change hair styles, color and shade.  Can change<br/>
eye color and facial features.  Can change between a wide variety of beards.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not all golden and sunshine though.  There are drawbacks to it as well:<br/>
1)  No zone-wide shouts (there are no zones)  AC staff has stated they&#39;re<br/>
working on a &quot;Yell&quot; command that will be heard in an area (probably 10 times<br/>
the radius of &quot;say&quot;)<br/>
2)  Tougher learning curve.  Asheron&#39;s call is a lot more in-depth and takes<br/>
a little more effort than EQ to just &quot;jump in&quot;.<br/>
3)  Only 3 races, all human.  (kind of like Human, Erudite and Barbarian).<br/>
There are no non-human player races in AC, but they do state that it&#39;s<br/>
possible that portals may start opening to other worlds so who knows?<br/>
4)  No Bard Class :(   Nor any bardic skills really.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  Please don&#39;t flame this is NOT a bash against EverQuest.  It&#39;s just<br/>
a post letting everyone know that Asheron&#39;s Call is a viable alternative<br/>
(and a lot less frustrating).  I think the best thing I&#39;ve noticed about<br/>
Asheron&#39;s Call so far is that the game designers actually communicate with<br/>
the players.  There also doesn&#39;t seem to be some horrible fear of players<br/>
gaining levels.  The best example of this is that in Asheron&#39;s Call, good<br/>
tactics are applauded and rewarded rather than causing a cry of &quot;Exploit&quot;<br/>
followed closely by a Nerf.  In Asheron&#39;s call it&#39;s entirely possible (with<br/>
good tactics) to take down creatures four-five levels higher than<br/>
yourself... solo. And the Game Masters applaud people who figure out how,<br/>
they don&#39;t nerf a class just because one or two people figure out how to<br/>
play it effectively.<br/>
