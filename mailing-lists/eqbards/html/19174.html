<div id="ygrps-yiv-173755643">When fighting pet classes I tell them they can have a pet, but only if it is<br/>
summoned during the duel.  If they insist then remember this: In duels on<br/>
the regular servers charm works.  Charm the bugger and make him attack his<br/>
own pet then step back and watch the fun :)  If you make 30 have Curtailing<br/>
chant up to lower his MR as well if needed.<br/>
<br/>
When all else fails, just fear/chain him<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] dueling magicians<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A magician in my guild has been bragging for several<br/>
&gt; days now about how great he is.  He&#39;s dueled several<br/>
&gt; players in my guild that are 2-3 lvls higher and<br/>
&gt; defeated them (one was killed by his pet;-( )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway as I approach 30th lvl I expect to be<br/>
&gt; challenged by this guy and, since his attitude really<br/>
&gt; gets me going anyway, *really* don&#39;t want to lose...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have never dueled...I am more into the group and<br/>
&gt; make friends aspect of this game.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So far I figure pixie strike, song of siriens guardian<br/>
&gt; and elemental rythmns will be my main songs....weapons<br/>
&gt; are a T claw and gnoll hide lariet.  (I also have a<br/>
&gt; silvery axe but figure stunning is a good thing with a<br/>
&gt; caster....)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions?<br/>
