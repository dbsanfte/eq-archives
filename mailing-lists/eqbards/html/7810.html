&gt; &gt; Yup.  IIRC, you lose 1/6th of your hp for every tick you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; drowning.  It&#39;s independent of how many hp you have.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Wait&#39;ll you fall into lava.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that&#39;s true, lava is no where near as bad. One afternoon several<br/>

damage ticks every 6 seconds like a DoT.<br/>

&gt; With a running leap out of there you can get a great jump into the lava<br/>
&gt; pool. We got some great screenshots. The dwarf is especially funny<br/>
&gt; because when they do a running jump their animation makes them do a<br/>
&gt; summersault. With my slightly pumped up fire resist (BI Crown, Fork)<br/>
&gt; I was taking maybe 22 hp damage and if I sang chant of cooling I took<br/>
&gt; about 16.<br/>

Rhythms raised that to 71 resist, and I took 26 points/sec.<br/>
Dunno if level or AC plays a part.<br/>
