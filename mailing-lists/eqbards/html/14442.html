&gt; &gt; A warrior in my guild complains nonstop about the taunt cap <br/>

&gt; at all when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; counts most.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is actually a gripe of mine too with nearly all the RPGs<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen.  The way the rules work, the best strategy is for<br/>
&gt; everyone to concentrate on one opponent at a time, while the<br/>
&gt; extras beat on you.  In real combat, that&#39;ll get you killed<br/>
&gt; real quick since the extras will be getting free shots at your<br/>
&gt; backside.  I&#39;d really like to see a CRPG with some sort of<br/>
&gt; engagement/disengagement system.  Then the warrior wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to taunt, he&#39;d just step between the cleric and mob and<br/>
&gt; engage the mob in combat.  If the mob turned to attack the<br/>
&gt; cleric, the warrior would get a free shot in for max or<br/>
&gt; critical damage.  Yes this would require mobs to have better<br/>
&gt; AI, which IMHO is always a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that for entertainment&#39;s sake, we wouldn&#39;t really want it. I see the<br/>
point you are making, which is that it would require more strategy if they<br/>
were to fight and take damage in a more realistic fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Potentially, if we wanted realism, 1 good stick in the gut should disable<br/>
any mob or player then, which kind of ruins any suspense.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same reason that Hollywood sword fights are not anything like a<br/>
real life sword fight would probably be.<br/>
<br/>
For mob AI, if the &quot;GM&quot; wanted to really spoil one&#39;s fun, then he&#39;d have the<br/>
mobs adopt the same strategies as the players. At the beginning of a battle,<br/>
they&#39;d kill the casters first at all costs and keep them from casting. (Of<br/>
course, then I&#39;d agree with Verant&#39;s &quot;binding&quot; justifications.)<br/>
<br/>
For real medieval combat, the winner would generally go to &quot;majority rules&quot;.<br/>
2 vs 1 would usually means that the 2 would win. The single person might<br/>
have a better chance to survive depending on their skills, but it would be a<br/>
small chance if the 2 know what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
We also wouldn&#39;t have &quot;levels&quot;. Realistically, Muhammad Ali in his prime<br/>
would still get knocked out by 1 person hitting him from behind with a pipe.<br/>
In EQ a naked level 50 could stand around indefinitely while a<br/>
staff-wielding decaying skeleton whacked him over the head. It can be<br/>
argued, though, which would be more fun, so I&#39;ll get back to the point<br/>
(sorry I digressed).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not necessarily sure that the engagement/disengagement system would<br/>
really be an improvement. The example given is the warrior and cleric vs. 1<br/>
mob.<br/>
<br/>
   Mob attacks cleric and is considered &quot;engaged&quot;<br/>
   Warrior gets massive bonuses against mob since mob is &quot;engaged&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t this essentially give everyone a &quot;backstab&quot; ability and change our<br/>
tactics accordingly? This would also encourage just groups of 2, just like<br/>
the 2 rogues with backstab.<br/>
<br/>
Pick a mob, 2 players take him down fast as the mob is always engaged. This<br/>
is, of course, much more realistic, but for play balance and fun of the game<br/>
I would think it&#39;d become boring.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this should work the other way around, 2 mobs vs 1 player, the player<br/>
wouldn&#39;t stand a chance. That&#39;d be no fun either.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Upon reviewing this, I&#39;d have to say that I&#39;ve taken a very Verant view of<br/>
combat. It&#39;d be interesting to see whether a MUD with more &quot;realistic&quot;<br/>
combat would sell well, and it would depend on how far you&#39;d want to take<br/>
that realism.<br/>
<br/>
I remember my days playing &quot;hack&quot; which required a solo player to crawl<br/>
through a dungeon. You&#39;d gain experience and equipment along the way, and<br/>
most of the time you&#39;d end up dying and creating a new character. I thought<br/>
it hilarious that you could later come across some other adventurer&#39;s body<br/>
and if you could keep his ghost occupied, you could loot his corpse.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well. I ramble. Time to get back to work. :-P<br/>
