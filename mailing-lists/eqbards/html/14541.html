<div id="ygrps-yiv-915487684">I was hunting in the Plane of Sky last night and on tracking what do I see<br/>
but an npc named Cilin Spellsinger.  As my name is Celandro Spellsong this<br/>
seems very suspicious to me.  So I petition the npc for having a name so<br/>
close to mine and the gms refuse to change it!  Seems Verant has the<br/>
ability to steal any name they think is good and pervert it to their own<br/>
uses! So be careful Harmonic, Talies, Shada, Rokenn, and all the other<br/>
bards on this list.. Your name may be the next to be stolen!<br/>

On the look out for that evil npc Shala Stormblade</div>
