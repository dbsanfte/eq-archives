&gt;    Most of this document was pretty vague, oh well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Ahh, now here&#39;s something I like to see...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the<br/>
&gt;       following: Cinda&#39;s Charismatic Carillon, Tarew&#39;s Aquatic Ayre,<br/>
&gt;       Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens, Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike, and Agilmente&#39;s<br/>
&gt;       Aria of Eagles?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance,<br/>
&gt;       none.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was glad to see it too - that was one of many questions I submitted. = )<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Instruments only effect the primary effects of the song (healing, buff, <br/>
attack speed, etc.) - not the range/duration/chance of success, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This does suggest to me that there&#39;s no reason to wield a mandolin anymore <br/>
when lulling or lullabying.  Range/duration/chance of success seem to me to <br/>
be the only reasons to wield a mandolin for these songs anyways... what else <br/>
are we hoping for?  They&#39;ll sleep better (though not longer, farther away, <br/>
or more often)?  They&#39;ll be sadder (from the same range, as often, and for <br/>
as long)?  Perhaps lament reduces the aggro radius by a variable number <br/>
which can be affected by an instrument... but how in the hells do we test <br/>
that under controlled circumstances?  Should have asked, damn.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Using an instrument will always increase the effect of a song - assuming <br/>
that type of song can be increased by an instrument&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bwahahahahahahahaha what a wonderful line.  Sooo what you&#39;re saying, GZ, is <br/>
that if the instrument works, it works, and if it doesn&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;High Quality Instruments always bump up the effect of a song. Some songs, <br/>
however, don´┐¢t have effects that can be bumped up&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm now I have to pick up that Brahmm&#39;s Horn Menoly&#39;s been holding for me <br/>
and test Pixie Strike&#39;s magic resist component.  It would seem to fit the <br/>
High Quality requirements, since it&#39;s a mino horn off a rare named mino...  <br/>
I&#39;m also curious whether a regular mino horn is any different from a flute <br/>
in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
OK, honestly I can&#39;t see myself using a flute/mino horn all that often when <br/>
pixie striking, but inquiring minds want to know. = )<br/>
