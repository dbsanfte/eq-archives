<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050587680">Here&#39;s a question for the knowledgeable out there.  Our guild&#39;s ogre warrior<br/>
has been tracking his average damage per hit for some time now.  Apparently<br/>
if he is grouped with any group not including another warrior, or a ranger,<br/>
or a rogue, or a monk, or a paladin, he inflicts 15% more damage on an<br/>
average per hit basis than he does when there is another one of those types<br/>
in the group.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had a chance to check his numbers yet, but I did observe that he<br/>
rarely hits for over 80 when grouped with myself and a ranger.  When grouped<br/>
with just myself against the same mobs he often hit for over 80 and<br/>
sometimes even 100 without criticals.<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody heard of anything like this before?<br/>
