<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Oh and about the memorizing thing... this is an IC requirement. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;difficult to type in your ballads quickly and without error in EQ - the goal<br/>
&gt;being to not bore your audience with long lapses and tons of typos. The IC<br/>
&gt;representation of typos or long pauses are missed notes and forgetfulness<br/>
&gt;respectively.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I believe that he was referring to the memorization of all<br/>
sixteen deities of Norrath. As the kind fellow pointed out, this is a hard<br/>
task to prove. This requirement, like several others, is taken on trust<br/>
mostly, that the Soerbaird is acting with honor. If they truly don&#39;t know<br/>
the deities, it will become VERY evident quickly usually by watching the<br/>
person in conversation.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you more interested in this, one of our students actually<br/>
wrote a ballad which lists all the deities and a characteristic of each of<br/>
them. It can be found in our Iona Hall and is called &quot;Gods of Norrath, from<br/>
A to Z&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One last note: If you gentlemen think that the Academy requirements are<br/>
challenging, just wait until you see the requirements to become a Master<br/>
Bard of the Soerbaird!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live!<br/>
