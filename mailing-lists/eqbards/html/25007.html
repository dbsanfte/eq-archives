<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495626837">Tallies, I figured this a topic of interest even if not directly related to barding.  Bards do provide a lot of input into what is seen in game graphically, so this can be an important topic.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 450 mhz P3 Gateway with 128 MB Ram and Voodoo 3000 16 MB AGP graphics card.  I can&#39;t get a new computer.  But more memory and a better graphics card are in reach due to Father&#39;s day.  I just got 128 MB Ram - done.  So now I want to get my fellow bards input on what graphics cards they use, have used and performance rating.  Brand, MB, speed, anything else of note would be much appreciated.  Currently, framerate in WW and some places in FV sucks - I auto follow, look down and hope they don&#39;t scrape me off on a tree.  I can&#39;t imagine Luclin without a better card.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the help,<br/>
