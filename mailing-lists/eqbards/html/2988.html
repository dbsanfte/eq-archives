<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916964319">At your levels - what are you guys doing when in combat with your party?<br/>
<br/>
Are you equiped and in the melee?  If so, don&#39;t you get stunned and have<br/>
your songs stopped?<br/>
<br/>
Or are you standing off with an instrument and playing for extra party<br/>
effect?<br/>
<br/>
On another note...<br/>
I was in a real bad melee last night - me and my enchanter friend. An<br/>
icey-boney skelly comes by and we attack it.  A snow lepoard and an Orc join<br/>
the melee.  The icey is about a bub more hp than either me or my friend and<br/>
he&#39;s hitting on me.  My friends hp drops a half a bub lower than mine. And<br/>
we are both real low.  So, I decided to gamble and equip my lute - I already<br/>
am trying desparately to keep the song going between interupts.  The<br/>
icey-boney keeps hitting on me and finally slays me.  My friend&#39;s pet killed<br/>
the lep and she killed the icey and mezzed the Orc and escapes with 4 hp<br/>
left.  <br/>
<br/>
Does it ever help to equip lute for hp if you are getting hit on by strong<br/>
mobs?<br/>

		Ok, I took my own advice and timed these.  From pressing the<br/>
		song button to when the song effect kicks in is 3.5 seconds<br/>
<br/>
		So in theory, you could twist:<br/>
<br/>
		twist 4 songs and still have <br/>
		2 seconds to spare. :-)  Hmm, maybe I should put a metronome<br/>
		next to my computer...</div>
