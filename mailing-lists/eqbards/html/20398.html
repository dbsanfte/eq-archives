<br/>
1.  Since its your current level song, resist rates will be insanely high.<br/>
<br/>
2. You have no other good percussion song (unless you are playing chant of<br/>
battle) to mix with it.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Chords does more damage with a mandolin and you can use the mandolin for<br/>
big heal too.<br/>
<br/>
You need to adjust your songs to your group.<br/>
<br/>
Use anthem if your group does not have an enchanter.  Use Chant of Battle if<br/>
they do (and the enchanter is hasting)<br/>
<br/>
Using Binding if your group does not have anyone doing slowdowns (shaman or<br/>
enchanter)<br/>
<br/>
If your group is light on healing, go to all instrument and play heal,<br/>
chords, and XXXXX (take your pick: anthem, denons, binding, psalm...).<br/>
<br/>
As bards we have to adapt to the group.  Most people believe their class<br/>
should be played one way.  No matter what, and won&#39;t change.  Since we tend<br/>
to be worse at whatever they are doing, then it is our job to adapt to that<br/>
and change.</div>
