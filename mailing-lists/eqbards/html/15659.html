<b>Subject:</b> Druzzil Ro Migration Update <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-718649751">Well, we did it.  My guild was, by and large, migrated to the new Druzzil Ro<br/>
server from Fennin Ro.  There were a few very valuable members left behind<br/>
that we hope made it in the second wave of transfers last night..  we&#39;ll<br/>
see.  In fact a couple of guild officer&#39;s mule characters were left behind<br/>
with loads of runes, pages, gate potions, dragon loot, fbss&#39;s, ykeshas, etc.<br/>
that he had stored..  yech.  So I&#39;ve got to say this wasn&#39;t for the<br/>
faint-hearted.  I left a lot of friends on Fennin Ro and am going to meet a<br/>
lot of high levels now that I&#39;ve never seen, but it&#39;s definitely<br/>
*interesting*.<br/>
<br/>
The server population thus far has peaked at 600, but that&#39;s going to change<br/>
as people migrate from Xegony and Solusek Ro (?).  Anyhow, I must say that<br/>
it&#39;s really eerie running from zone to zone and hearing no /ooc, no /shout,<br/>
nothing.  Last night I ran through East Commonlands which is normally a<br/>
hotbed of /auc activity and not one message went by other than &quot;Your feet<br/>
move faster.&quot; running from Nek to NRo.  There were I think 4 folks in the<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
I fought in the Frenzy Room of lower guk with only about 25 people in the<br/>
zone.  There were frogs *everywhere*, and lguk was as truly dangerous as it<br/>
was supposed to be.  My guild&#39;s group did very well, although a couple of us<br/>
died once when I pixie&#39;d a frog that wandered in and our Shadow Knight<br/>
didn&#39;t have mana to root the one we were fighting.  It fled at 25% and made<br/>
it to a couple of his buddies before I chained it.  Oops - so I learned to<br/>
just assume that an Ogre SK with an INT of 73 is always oom.  I still used<br/>
AE Binding and such in that particular area without difficulty though.<br/>
<br/>
My guild ran around and did a bunch of &quot;firsts&quot; for the heck of it.  First<br/>
Oracle Robe, first Nagafen kill, first D&#39;Vinn ass kicking, first Gix kill,<br/>
first this and first that..  kinda fun.<br/>
<br/>
So, overall I would say that it&#39;s definitely a better place at the moment,<br/>
we&#39;ll see if that holds true as others flee some of the other crowded<br/>
servers...  If you have the opportunity to move and don&#39;t have a lot of<br/>
close ties to people on your existing server, you might give it a shot, but<br/>
moving an entire guild is definitely problematic and could easily result in<br/>
a smaller guild falling apart.<br/>
