lord to get 4 ghoulbanes for the 4 paladins in the<br/>
guild.  Needless to say, it got very boring so I used the time<br/>
to test this.  (I even brought a shield after the first few<br/>
nights so I could test this better. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The attack speedup of Warsong and Anthem do not stack with<br/>
Quickness, Alacrity, (enchanter) Celerity, nor Augmentation.  <br/>
The faster prevails, although I only tested it with the song<br/>
played after the spell, not vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Reduction in attack delays were (1 - new_delay/old_delay):<br/>
<br/>
Anthem ~10%<br/>
Augmentation ~15%<br/>
Quickness ~20%<br/>
Warsong ~20%<br/>
Alacrity ~25%<br/>
(enchanter) Celerity ~33%<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve since tested bard Celerity at ~15%.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d estimate the error was about +/- 3%.<br/>
