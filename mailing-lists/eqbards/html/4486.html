Who the hell is this Murissa Sandwhisperer person?  I was jaunting back to<br/>
Freeport after killing some crocs the other day and assumed she was a vendor<br/>
(like in E. Commons, where they are consistently not in the inns but rather<br/>
in front of them or on top of them....still haven&#39;t figured that out yet)<br/>
and she screamed something at me just before she quadruple whacked me for<br/>
127hp per slap.  I have removed Dorn from my list now though....hehe it was<br/>
with a group and we almost died but I still feel better.  Oh yes, add the<br/>
spectres to that list as well and a PC Dark Elf caster Xcelsior who trained<br/>
them on us about 10 times the other day.  I personally only died twice.  One<br/>
guy in my group had bound himself just far enough down the beach so that<br/>
after they killed him the each time, he appeared right in front of them as<br/>
they came back down the beach.  He died 6 times in a space of 10 minutes<br/>
(with zoning to starting point) poor guy.  It was however rather fun to<br/>
watch them kill two sand giants and Lockjaw before they finally stayed home<br/>
for good.  Leaving a string of 40 bodies along the beach, was not pretty,<br/>
nor was the ensuing spam fest that went on afterwards.  Oh yeah add all the<br/>
troll guards at the entrance to Grobb too.  I owe them 3 lives, long story.<br/>
