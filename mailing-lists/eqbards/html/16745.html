<div id="ygrps-yiv-221761800">So, instead of songs that you can use constantly you&#39;d rather have a bunch<br/>
of songs we can use 1ce a day?  Come on now, I do NOT want to be tied to my<br/>
manabar especially with as slow as our mana comes back.   I like a LOT of<br/>
the songs we&#39;ve proposed.  And I agree some do need a check/balance.  But<br/>
why does it have to be something we cannot recover anywhere even remotely<br/>
quickly?  Why not cost 1/2 health?  or 1 bubble of hp?  Why tie it to mana<br/>
(which we are incapable of recovering)?  But, looking at these proposals.<br/>
Most of the ones that have a proposal of X mana/tic cost really don&#39;t NEED a<br/>
check of that kind.  Remember you&#39;re talking about limiting ALL our song use<br/>
for mana songs.<br/>
<br/>
As someone else pointed out these are LEVEL 50+ songs.  We shouldn&#39;t HAVE to<br/>
sacrifice anything to have these abilities.  I have yet to see a single<br/>
powerful song here that would be &quot;unbalancing&quot; without manacost.  Ok, maybe<br/>
the time stop one was ;)  But the others?  Come on, these are nice abilities<br/>
but I&#39;d hardly call them abilities that will recharge about as fast as<br/>
paladin layhands.<br/>
<br/>
Remember:  1 bar of mana recharges SLOWER than SK harm touch or Paladin<br/>
Layhands (both of which are horrendously powerful and are just _skills_,<br/>
skills they get at level _1_).  I<br/>
don&#39;t dissagree that it would be nice to have 1, MAYBE 2 songs that will<br/>
burn up our mana.  But our mana doesn&#39;t come back fast.<br/>
<br/>
Do you honestly think we should have 4 songs (25%) out of the 13 we (should)<br/>
be getting require all our mana to be useful?  Seriously:  how many times<br/>
are you going to use 1 pulse of a song... only 1 pulse mind you.  On all the<br/>
suggestions I&#39;ve seen 1 pulse = 1 bubble of mana.  So we&#39;re talking 200+<br/>
mana<br/>
casting cost (for any bard).<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if we use mana for songs, given current bard mana recovery rates:<br/>
I sing 1 mana using song till OOM (not really long given the rates of use<br/>
proposed)  I now am incapable of singing ANY mana using songs until I<br/>
recover at least<br/>
SOME of my mana.  1 bubble of mana for a bard is around 10-20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks but no thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bard, not a mage dammit<br/>

&gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t propose mana costs in our songs unless you also propose<br/>
&gt; &gt; that our meditate cap be removed and our immunity to clarity effects be<br/>
&gt; &gt; removed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I highly doubt they remove the meditate limit or give us the ability<br/>
&gt;   to receive benefit from clarity type effects.  I think that was your<br/>
&gt;   point anyway, it&#39;s not going to happen.  I agree that 75% of our new<br/>
&gt;   songs should be manaless, just like the bulk of our songs now.  The<br/>
&gt;   problem is, I&#39;m tired of just getting the &#39;next Anthem&#39; or the &#39;next<br/>
&gt;   Heal&#39; or the &#39;next Resistance song&#39;.  Original ideas like the ones<br/>
&gt;   I have seen are unique and very powerful.  They need a check put in<br/>
&gt;   so that the Bard is not just constantly using these most powerful<br/>
&gt;   songs.  I&#39;m not saying all songs take a full bar, or take 1 bubble.<br/>
&gt;   Songs can taken 20 mana per tick, (20m/6s) = 300s worth of time at<br/>
&gt;   full mana (~1000 mana), for example.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Songs like that sacrifice song are self-checking.  You die, your<br/>
&gt;   party gains benefit.  Dirge is a joke, and I hate to sound like<br/>
&gt;   a broken record but Dirge at L43 is the equivalent of a L20ish<br/>
&gt;   wizard dumping full mana into AE.  The only thing desparate, again,<br/>
&gt;   is the damage done.  This song takes up to an hour to mana cycle.<br/>
&gt;   (And no, Shada, I&#39;m not a caster, I don&#39;t sit my bard down ever)<br/>
&gt;   It takes an hour for 90%+ of the bard population to regain mana for<br/>
&gt;   this song, because I know I have hidden my &#39;Sit&#39; button since I<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t use it.  Needless to say the song is a waste.  It requires<br/>
&gt;   mana, but for the wrong reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   There was the rumor of a high level bard song which stopped time.<br/>
&gt;   Something like that would absolutely take mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t want to be stuck with Verses of Victory II at L60.  I want<br/>
&gt;   some very distinct songs, and I just get the feeling that isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   going to happen.  Let&#39;s also assume Verant aren&#39;t complete idiots,<br/>
&gt;   and we continue to receive one song per level.  Here is what I<br/>
&gt;   predict:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   L51 - upgrade to hymm<br/>
&gt;   L52 - upgrade to lullaby<br/>
&gt;   L53 - upgrade to clouding<br/>
&gt;   L54 - upgrade to some useless AE like DDD, LMB<br/>
&gt;   L55 - upgrade to clarit<br/>
&gt;   L56 - upgrade to psalm line<br/>
&gt;   L57 - upgrade to charm<br/>
&gt;   L58 - not implemented<br/>
&gt;   L59 - upgrade to verses of victory<br/>
&gt;   L60 - not implemented<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s sad, but I just don&#39;t see them doing anything that requires a whole<br/>
&gt;   lot of effort.  Look at the other classes new spells, there&#39;s really<br/>
&gt;   nothing new about them.  They are just upgrades to existing spells.<br/>
&gt;   I couldn&#39;t find any really new power anyone was given.  Except maybe<br/>
&gt;   that single target kill series, but that requires a gem component, and<br/>
&gt;   then becomes extremely limited in use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   So if I can get a song that makes me a badass at the cost of mana,<br/>
&gt;   but gets me into more parties because of the talent, I&#39;m for it.<br/>
