<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395669507">From all reports I&#39;ve seen - the speed variable is overflowing and rolling<br/>
past 0.  I&#39;ve heard if you toggle to walk-you go at maximum speed.<br/>
<br/>
By the way - what mob dropped it in SG - and what&#39;s it&#39;s location?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

I know you hate updates after you release a new version, but I just got<br/>
Drums of the Beast, and I can say with a certainty that Selo&#39;s Song of<br/>
Travel gives 0% run speed improvement while weilding it.  In fact, and this<br/>
seems REALLY weird, I seem to run faster while singing it and weilding a<br/>
sword rather than that drum.  I&#39;m thinking it may actually be a negative<br/>
speed increase, but of course that&#39;s hard to quantify.<br/>
