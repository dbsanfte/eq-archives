<div id="ygrps-yiv-55736295">Hello Thrush:<br/>
<br/>
Having performed many,many times since November, let me lend some comments<br/>
here...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I assume there is no way to provide actual music.  Let your imagination a<br/>
&gt;bit loose and consider that perhaps someday Verant will let us feed in a<br/>
&gt;MIDI or .wav file that then goes to the listeners.  The bandwidth needed<br/>
&gt;for a MIDI might even be within reason.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sadly, no. There is no &#39;music&#39; per se. At one point early in world, the<br/>
gods talked of offering this possibility, but I do not expect it any time soon.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So I further assume that you simply supply the words for all those nearby<br/>
&gt;to read.  Is there a way to do that in reasonable quantity without having<br/>
&gt;to type them as you go?  Do you perhaps set up chunks of the words as<br/>
&gt;command macros, then touch those off one at a time in order?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll give you a quick answer and access to a longer one here, about<br/>
technique. In the short, you can use macros, but you&#39;ll probably find them<br/>
woefully inadequate for a song of any length. Also, although I wished we<br/>
had some better command for &#39;singing&#39;, having to type each line kind of<br/>
simulates true skill required  in performance, if you treat typos as missed<br/>
notes and such.<br/>
<br/>

students in the Soerbaird library:<br/>
