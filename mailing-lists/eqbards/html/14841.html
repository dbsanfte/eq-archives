<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-523313786">Let me introduce myself.  I&#39;m a new player to Everquest (received it for<br/>
Christmas).  I&#39;ve played an Erudite paladin up to level 7, a Barbarian<br/>
shamon up to level 9, and now I&#39;m a half elf bard at level 7.  <br/>
<br/>
I subscribed to this mailing list a few days ago and so far have just<br/>
seen postings that talk about the higher levels.  I&#39;ve also noticed that<br/>
many of the posts sound unsatisfied with the bard character.<br/>
<br/>
My questions: <br/>
<br/>
At level 7, what should I be concentrating on now?  What items should I<br/>
be pursuing in the near future?<br/>
<br/>
If you had it to over again, would you even pursue the bard route?  What<br/>
makes the bard fun?<br/>

                             Never criticize another man until you&#39;ve<br/>
                             walked a mile in his shoes.  That way, <br/>
                             when he finds out what you said about <br/>
			     him, you&#39;re a mile away, and he&#39;s barefoot.</div>
