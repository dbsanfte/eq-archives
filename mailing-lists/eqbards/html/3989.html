&gt;Here is the story:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Late one night, early 4th of July weekend, me and couple of my fiends are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Rivervale begging for a bind.  I see Silvera Tinkerbelle who I know from a<br/>
&gt;server email list and run over to say &quot;hi I just wanted to meet you!&quot; (She<br/>
&gt;is lev 48 or 49 and I am impressed!)  She actually talks to me and I nearly<br/>
&gt;faint!  Well, we do some duck dancing and other stoopid char tricks and<br/>
&gt;generally hang out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then she inspects my equipment and goes: &quot;Greetings Sylly, looks like you<br/>
&gt;could use some armor?&quot;  I say: &quot;Well yes, if you know anyone selling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>banded,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I do have some plats saved up.&quot; She says come to the bank and lemme look<br/>
&gt;what I might have... Then my trade screen come up and she drops in a couple<br/>
&gt;of pieces of stuff I don&#39;t even recognize. Then she fills the trade screen<br/>
&gt;and says &#39;take&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At that point - I say to her &quot;ya know I am way too low level for this...&quot;<br/>
&gt;And she says &quot;I will understand if you say no...&quot;  But I think - hey this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;the chance of a life time! So I take!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then she fills the trade screen a second time and I am frantically looking<br/>
&gt;to see if I got nuff slots and destroying all my food and beetle eyes. She<br/>
&gt;says take.<br/>
&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
