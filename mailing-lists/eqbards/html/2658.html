&gt;What the heck is this supposed to do anyway?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Got invited to a wedding the other night - Dunnik himself oversaw the<br/>
&gt;ceremony (lead GM on Veeshan).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Went to the party afterwards - decided - what the heck - I got some plat to<br/>
&gt;burn, got mine up to ummm....78.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other than the fact that drinking in Kelethin can be extremely hazardous to<br/>
&gt;your health - and your screen gets really, really weird looking - I guess I<br/>
&gt;am missing the purpose of this skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As a bard - I figure someday I may hangout in taverns - don&#39;t see any<br/>
&gt;problem with having this skill - but I&#39;m wondering exactly what it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;SUPPOSED to be useful for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My Int. went into the basement - some of the other stats rose nicely - but<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t see them being terribly useful if you&#39;re swaying back and forth -<br/>
&gt;and can&#39;t see anything to hit it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps if it gets high enough, you get the increased stats without the<br/>
&gt;side effects - but still - is this just something that the dev team got a<br/>
&gt;chuckle out of - or is it useful to build?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We got any harddrinking bards here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t use it personally other than to celebrate an occasion, but i <br/>
have heard of someone on this list (John or Roop?) using it sometimes before <br/>
a fight for the STR boost.<br/>
<br/>
Who got married on Veeshan? I didn&#39;t see any post or annonouncement.<br/>
Also, (hehehe) two female elves in my guild are supposed to get married <br/>
sometime in the future I think. The first same-sex marriage? Dunno, but they <br/>
won&#39;t invite me to their honeymoon &lt;snickers&gt;...<br/>
<br/>
Say hi sometime Silky if ya see me, and i&#39;ll do the same!<br/>
