<div id="ygrps-yiv-547919968">Wait a second.  We&#39;re talking about Seafury Cyclops right?  In OOT?  If so I<br/>
don&#39;t see how a single group could keep that island clear unless perhaps<br/>
that was a group of six necros soloing.  Those things spawn *rediculously*<br/>
fast.  Earlier I said they pop like Moss Snakes and I meant it.  Perhaps<br/>
your server is different, but I&#39;ve never seen that island cleared of cyclops<br/>
even with three high 40s groups working it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Heh even without necros I think  my necro and a 42 enchanter<br/>
&gt; friend kept the<br/>
&gt; isle basically cleared. Often times I&#39;ll go there and they&#39;ll will be one<br/>
&gt; group who keeps it cleared without necros. Just need to have the<br/>
&gt; right group<br/>
&gt; for it. Besides which as I stated that place is camped like mad and they<br/>
&gt; recently lowered exp that you get from furies.<br/>
