<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571558568">Yes - I saw kinda the same thing.  My regular group zoomed away when I got<br/>
stuck in level 35.  There were actually 2 problems. They were a few lev&#39;s<br/>
above me (high 30&#39;s & lo 40&#39;s while I was 34) wanted to camp lower guk for<br/>
items (which meant very, very, very slow xp for me.)  And they played more<br/>
hours than me. By the time I was out of 35 (3 weeks) they were 45+.  Now I<br/>
am a bub off 39 and they are all 50&#39;s. &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
So, yes for various reasons, regular groups can get broken up.  It&#39;s quite a<br/>
heartbreak when it happens.<br/>

		My regular group is going through an distressing time right<br/>
now...<br/>
<br/>
		The leader, who encouraged/dragged us through Blackburrow,<br/>
Crushbone,<br/>
		Chessboard, Unrest, and now Mistmoore gets bored very<br/>
quickly.  He wants to<br/>
		see the exp bar move & wants to go where he hasn&#39;t gone<br/>
before.  There is<br/>
		now doubt about the hi risk, hi reward thing.<br/>
<br/>
		I just made 28, but most of the group is 33 - 36.  It seems<br/>
like around 30<br/>
		members get real shy about what they are willing to try.  I<br/>
think we lost<br/>
		our ranger last night, due to our leader wanting to move<br/>
past the torture<br/>
		room?  Not a game issue, but ya&#39;ll see the same thing?<br/>
