<div id="ygrps-yiv-31231829">Actually that does bring back memories for me ( yeah, like 31 was SO long<br/>
ago :-) )...<br/>
<br/>
I died 5 times in my last bubble of 31 because I was getting WAY to<br/>
aggressive in trying to get that last damn half bubble.   Every time I only<br/>
lost about a half bubble.  I certainly never lost a full bubble.  Never once<br/>
did I drop to having more then a little over a bubble to go.  I finally just<br/>
decided to ignore the XP bar all together and went to my tried and true<br/>
comfortable home of Sol A and just camped the Efreeti and EXG to get a<br/>
charred guardian shield and platinum armband for my brother&#39;s druid.  I<br/>
dinged in no time after that :-).  God that last bubble took forever... I<br/>
never want to do that again.<br/>

&gt; I concur with your findings - hell levels tend to insulate you from death<br/>
&gt; penalties and getting killed by a red is less xp loss than dying to a blue<br/>
&gt; or green.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FWIW:  got sucked into a Paladin&#39;s quest last nite.  Go to Erud&#39;s Crossing<br/>
&gt; and kill some damn fish. Ok, quest fishie hangs out with Killer Shark&#39;s -<br/>
&gt; ugh.  Playing a just 27 wiz, I killed the Plague Shark by chain casting my<br/>
&gt; big nuke but agro&#39;d the Killer who snarfed me.  Got snarfed 2 times and<br/>
lost<br/>
&gt; a half of a bub and then some (lost my level too.)  P.o.&#39;d, I camped him<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; get Sylly (40 bardette) and brought her over for CR and what have you.<br/>
&gt; Somehow she managed to get killed too but thankfully showed _very_ minimal<br/>
&gt; XP loss.  This is due I do believe to both being in a Hell level _and_ by<br/>
&gt; getting killed by a red (I was told Killer Sharks are 45 mobs - and if<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are how come the Planes players don&#39;t camp em for rebuilding xp? Ya, ya<br/>
&gt; fighting underwater is hard.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, while it&#39;s hard to gain XP in a Hell Level - it seems that each time<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; are killed - there is less loss than in other levels.  FYI - I have heard<br/>
&gt; that the Hell plus One levels are one-bub death penaltys for each time you<br/>
&gt; die - maybe only 46?  Or 41 and 46?  I don&#39;t remember 31 nor 36 to be<br/>
&gt; particularily bard - well, 31 was cuz I wanted 32 so badly.<br/>

&gt; Subjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; dying is higher when something kills you that cons<br/>
&gt; green/blue to you versus<br/>
&gt; something killing you that cons yellow/red.  Anyone else had<br/>
&gt; similar<br/>
&gt; results?<br/>
