and clerics are doing their job, it&#39;s not that big a deal.  Yes, bards do<br/>
tend to die easily, even with their full equipment, but too many times<br/>
it&#39;s because the tanks in the group treat the bard as just another melee<br/>
class, when in reailty, they should be treating them as casters (as in,<br/>
pulling things off them).<br/>
	And besides, we&#39;re applying this to ALL melee classes, not just<br/>
bards.  And as far as I&#39;ve seen, only bards suffer from this &quot;random hate<br/>
syndrome&quot;.<br/>

there every time my group or my guild has needed it, and so has every<br/>
melee class in my party when we do corpse retrieval in solusek b (well,<br/>
the deep stuff, fg&#39;s and efreeti).  Not once have I ever had any problems.<br/>
	So yes, it&#39;s been tried, and yes it works.  It may not work 100%<br/>
of the time or for 100% of the situations, but being bound at the zone<br/>
line at least gives you that option, whereas being bound in the city does<br/>
not.  As I pointed out earlier, you can be ressed just as well from<br/>
Lavastorm as you can be ressed from Freeport.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Well, there is a plus side and a minus side.  Personally, I also<br/>
prefer the days when typing /who in lower guk resulted in your group and<br/>
no one else, but having lots of people there makes doing certain things<br/>
alot easier.<br/>
