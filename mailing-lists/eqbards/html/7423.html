<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676954759"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;They are not hybrids, they are the priest classes. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A hybrid is considered any class that can use slashing weapons or armor.<br/>
Druids and Shaman can.  Pure Casters cannot.  Ask yourself, does the Druid<br/>
or Shaman follow the same weapon/armor rules as a Pure Caster (Mage/Wizard).<br/>
Clerics are the oddball, in that they can wear armor.</div>
