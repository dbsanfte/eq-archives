<b>Subject:</b> Lag -ugh! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-942381764">Yesterday, the lag was incredible.  Constant 15% to 35%, surges and spikes<br/>
into red with 50% to 80%.  Other players all complaing.  Some guys getting<br/>
dumped and coming back only to be nekkid and bind spot - never seeing a<br/>
fight.<br/>
<br/>
So, rather than venture into some hard dungeon, I was helping a group do<br/>
HG&#39;s off the wood bridge in North Karanas.  Staying back, buffing and mana<br/>
song.  So, then I decide ok, let&#39;s try Denons with horn and see how he likes<br/>
it.  Great - he&#39;s wincing away nicely.<br/>
<br/>
Then my friend Kaldivar comes by and asks about fenne&#39;s and charms.  So, I<br/>
say follow me I can show you a Grifxxxx spawn spot - do you know where the<br/>
named treeant is? (By now you should have a pretty good idea of what is<br/>
coming next.)<br/>
<br/>
On the way there, I cant get selo&#39;s to lock and stay up.  I click, it trys,<br/>
then stops.  I start whining about lag and how weird this is a cant make my<br/>
songs play, etc. etc. Just as we get to that little tower, I look up and go<br/>
&quot;hmmm, wonder why the tree is moving around like that?&quot;  Followed shortly by<br/>
&quot;you are burned&quot; and whoof 2 plus bubs of hp dissappear.  Btw: Kaldivar says<br/>
&quot;oh I dunno, he is red to me&quot; Hehe - I start running away and frantically<br/>
yelling &quot;ZNE, ZNME, ZONE!!&quot;  You are burned. Another 2 bubs gone and a<br/>
glimpse of the goodie werewolf hunter chasing me as well. <br/>
<br/>
Now I am keying and clicking Selos very, very fast and desparately trying<br/>
for a zone.  Praise the Gods!  It finally stuck and I escaped to the Western<br/>
Karana.  <br/>
<br/>
So, all I can think of is Denons was locked on - due to some lag bug? Selos<br/>
would not start and since there is no icon and were no other mobs being hit<br/>
- there was no screen message to see.  But seems even wierder than that.  I<br/>
scrolled back to see what spell he was casting and do not recall seeing &quot;a<br/>
Xannthoulos winces&quot; message.  Not that is some strong &quot;bard hate&quot; when stuff<br/>
that likes you attacks you!!<br/>
<br/>
After a bit, the lag seemed to settle enough so I went and helped my group<br/>
kill spectres.  Even with 3 and 4 of them getting pulled, it seemed almost<br/>
too easy.  Of course we did have an enchanter handling the crowd control.<br/>
She could park them as necessary while we feared (although not the bard<br/>
fear) and killed the others.  Hehe, spectres are too easy.  Never thought I<br/>
would be saying that.<br/>
