&gt; I think you have missed the point, people are disgusted with the fact that<br/>
&gt; this list is being used as medium for selling the account.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care less if he wanted to sell his EQ account, he should refrain from<br/>
&gt; posting it to this mailing list.  As a whole this list is an informative<br/>
&gt; and intelligent list about bards, not the sale of accounts.  I think we<br/>
&gt; are all very well grounded in reality.  I myself have reached lvl 18 and<br/>
&gt; think that my grasp on reality is good enough (until I die 6 times in a<br/>
&gt; row to a SF in S Ro =).<br/>
