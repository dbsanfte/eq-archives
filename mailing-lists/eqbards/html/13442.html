&gt; and bat my eyes a lot.  Works like a charm.  We men are such suckers...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Oh lord, I&#39;ll keep an eye out for someone doing that and setup <br/>
  a macro button that just does:  /say Kenross is that you?????<br/>
<br/>
  hehehe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I get this all the time when I&#39;m at the bank.  The other night I got a tell from a level four bard asking<br/>
&gt; if I could help a poor fellow bard buy their level four song.  Remembering how hard the first few levels<br/>
&gt; were, I turned around to take a look.  She was in full bronze!  What, her twinker was too cheap to give<br/>
&gt; her 50 plat?  Of course, she was a wood elf, so I had to cough it up.  (See sucker comment, above...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, heh.  Mmmmm woodelves in bronze, damn I would give in too.<br/>
  Seeing that the song was only what? 8gp? hehe.<br/>
