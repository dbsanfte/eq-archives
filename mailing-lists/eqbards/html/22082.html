<br/>
 We have had a major exodus of higher level players from our guild as well,<br/>
Excalibur on Xegony. Also a friend of ours is in Dark Legion and receently<br/>
internal strife has conspired to turn him into the new guild leader for<br/>
them. I think the old leader left or quit the game. He was asking us the<br/>
same questions you have.<br/>
 When this summer rolled around, there just seemed to be lots of unrest in<br/>
people. We in Excalibur have clamped down very hard on admitting new members<br/>
after the guild grew quite rapidly in spite of some efforts we made to<br/>
control the growth. We also had a couple people tenatively joined who nearly<br/>
ruined our rep overnight. We prefer to have a guild where we all know and<br/>
respect each other. Excalibur is an old guild and even has real life<br/>
meetings twice a year for those who can make it. It&#39;s also mostly adults,<br/>
even old folks like me, (35). It&#39;s based on the principles of honor and<br/>
chivarly, www.orderexcal.com if you are interested in reading further. While<br/>
I am relatively new to the guild, some folks have been in for many years and<br/>
gone through many games. We still have some active members in Illusia.<br/>
 Lately, many folks in EQ have had to reduce playtime or stop for RL<br/>
reasons, some are a bit bored and split their time with other games, and<br/>
this meant we have fewer folks available for the big stuff. This prompted<br/>
the departure of most of the higher levels for the latest hot guild on<br/>
Xegony. Most stated their reaosn was to be able to do the big things. This<br/>
isn&#39;t the first time it has happened. The previous summer almost the same<br/>
thing happened, those folks that left ended up as some of the first Inner<br/>
Circle members. Lately the guild list is about equal to my friends list, but<br/>
we had lots of complaining when the guild seemed huge and no one recognized<br/>
anyone on chat. Now we&#39;re much much smaller and people complain we can&#39;t<br/>
&#39;do&#39; anything. I just don&#39;t think there is a perfect answer and I think most<br/>
guilds probably go through these shrink and swell cycles for the same<br/>
variety of reasons. My biggest barrier to &#39;doing&#39; things is time, not guild,<br/>
so I see no need to change guilds. I am happier with the small guild on the<br/>
whole, there&#39;s much less whining and complaining at least. Then there&#39;s the<br/>
matter of my solemn oath of honor to the Queen. We&#39;re not the roleplay<br/>
police but I really do take the principles behind it all seriously.<br/>
 Being in a guild seems necessary in EQ, it classifies or identifies you to<br/>
some extent to people who don&#39;t know you personally. My advice on being in a<br/>
guild is be in one you personally are happy with, whose goals are similar to<br/>
your goals, and people you can have fun with. After all, EQ is just a game!<br/>
