 </span></blockquote>in a large party you won&#39;t be dealing a high percentage of the damage, but<br/>
you will be getting hit an awful lot. with a party of 1 or 2 other people,<br/>
you&#39;d want to dual wield, past that you might just want to be able to<br/>
absorb more damage since your songs are going to attract a lot of hate.<br/>
