&gt; Conventional tactics in EQ when you pull multiple mobs is for everyone to<br/>

on the number of mobs (assuming the amount of hp a typical mob<br/>
has is comparable to the damage it does - there are several<br/>
exceptions to this, thus the rule kill the caster first).  <br/>
For 2 mobs it&#39;s 75%, for 3 mobs it&#39;s 67%, decreasing<br/>
asymptotically until you get to 50% for infinite mobs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, you usually won&#39;t get much sympathy from group members<br/>
if you complain about the extra mobs attacking you.  You have<br/>
to mention that when the healer heals you, the extras will be<br/>
all over *their* healer.  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wondering that if in situations where you get 2+ mobs, that it might<br/>
&gt; actually be smarter if the tanks in the group each attacked a different mob.<br/>
&gt; It would take longer to kill all the mobs, but it would help ensure that<br/>
&gt; damage to the group was spread out better.  Plus, if all the mobs are<br/>
&gt; engaged, it would be safer for bards to sing Largos to debuff mob attack<br/>
&gt; speed.  Its quite possible that the damage multiple mobs inflict using this<br/>
&gt; tactic (Largos in effect all the time) would be very close to the damage<br/>
&gt; they inflict when everyone focuses on one at a time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if everyone is assisting and the extra mob is going to<br/>
beat up on the bard anyways, you might as well play Largo&#39;s.  <br/>
:)  So I don&#39;t see Largo&#39;s as having any effect on the<br/>
comparison.<br/>
<br/>
The real unknown in this is how much better is a real tank at<br/>
tanking than a bard.  If a real tank can take 75% the damage<br/>
of a bard or less, then it makes more sense to fight both at<br/>
once.  That&#39;s for evenly splitting your resources though.  <br/>
The best strategy would be one tank on the extra, everyone<br/>
else fights the primary target.  The exact percentage would<br/>
vary depending on group size and composition.<br/>
