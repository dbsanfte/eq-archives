I&#39;m glad I won&#39;t get level 50 for another year or so. :)  Maybe by then<br/>
there will be a lot more things to do, and places to see.<br/>
<br/>
I happen to like trying to get through Kithicor now.  I&#39;m level 19, but I&#39;d<br/>
still die in a heartbeat if one of the undead happened to get a hold of me.<br/>
I like having a zone I actually worry about getting through safely.  It&#39;s<br/>
become one of those zones parents tell their little children about to scare<br/>
them. :)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say there IS things for level 50&#39;s to do, I said there SHOULD be.<br/>
:)  I know there&#39;s hardly anything to do.  I&#39;m on Tunare, and the number of<br/>
people in the high 40&#39;s up to 50 is getting to be rather insane.<br/>
<br/>
Something does need to be done, and done quickly.  Zones zones zones.  That<br/>
is the ONLY way to solve the overcrowding problem.  Maybe they should think<br/>
about hiring 5 more people and getting them to work on zones exclusively.<br/>
There&#39;s plenty of areas where a zone would fit nicely in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Have a subterranean zone with an entrance in the Qeynos sewers.  (Some<br/>
workers were repairing a wall, when &lt;crack&gt; the floor opened up, and they<br/>
fell into a deep chasm.)  Populate it with some sort of cavern dwelling<br/>
beasties.  Possibly have a zone inside this one.  Have the initial one for<br/>
mid-levels (15-25 or so maybe), and have the deepest section of it enter a<br/>
new zone, for 30+.<br/>
<br/>
I would say something on Odus, but Paineel is supposed to open one of the<br/>
decades, isn&#39;t it?  That&#39;s going to be another high level zone, if I<br/>
remember correctly.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one spot in the Oasis that looks like it&#39;s a valley, and should lead<br/>
somewhere, but it doesn&#39;t.  Is that going to be a new zone someday?  If not,<br/>
they could put one there.  Maybe the &quot;home of the sand giants&quot; or some such.<br/>
<br/>
Damn, I should work for Verant.  I&#39;ll whip up these zones myself, dangit!<br/>
