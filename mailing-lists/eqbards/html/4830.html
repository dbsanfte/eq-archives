<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019728741">Driving along and chatting on the cell phone, you turn on to the freeway and<br/>
remark, &quot;Zoning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You only near the wall in the local shopping mall.<br/>
<br/>
You notice people sitting on park benches and complain, &quot;Damn campers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When buying groceries, you sneak behind the cashier in hopes of getting<br/>
better prices.<br/>
<br/>
After buying new clothes, you quickly change into them and shout, &quot;Smelly T<br/>
Shirt and Faded Jeans for sale!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Walking along the beach, you see a teenager in a torn shirt and ask him if<br/>
he&#39;d like some good woven armor.<br/>
<br/>
You notice a girl in a bikini and slyly ask if her if she needs help finding<br/>
her corpse.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, you always buy your beer because it&#39;s cheaper than brewing<br/>
your own.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Been reading this list since digest #50, figured I&#39;ve spent way too much<br/>

bickering.<br/>

&gt;2. You mutter &quot;Why don&#39;t people loot their kills&quot; as you pass a dead animal<br/>
