umm... why?  Heh never heard that one before (or are you tossing them at the<br/>
badguy while kiting?)<br/>
<br/>
I use the chants in any battle that there are less than 2 tanks as the haste<br/>
songs just don&#39;t give them enough benefit to over-ride the power I can lay<br/>
down with the chants.  Chants don&#39;t interfere with Mez because they&#39;re<br/>
targetted so I&#39;m not sure why you wouldn&#39;t use them in groups that are low<br/>
on tanks (less than 3).<br/>
