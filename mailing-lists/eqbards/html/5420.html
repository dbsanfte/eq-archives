<b>Subject:</b> Ding! Welcome to level 6! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-513728216">So I hit level 6 in the hills hunting giant rats & wolves.  (Skeletons,<br/>
though they con white, are still too tough for me)  Not an exciting way of<br/>
leveling, but hey, everytime a rabid wolf would bite me I&#39;d get rabies and<br/>
have an excuse to go fishing for a while.  :-)  Incidently, I could be<br/>
wrong, but I do believe they nerfed fishing.  Bastards.  Anyway, so I&#39;m<br/>
making decent loot off the wolves at least.  It&#39;s a bit like Christmas when<br/>
I hit the vendors actually, because I never check the quality of a pelt when<br/>
I loot it (to busy switching to Selo&#39;s in case Cros or Holly are about to<br/>
attack).  Got quite a few low&#39;s & mediums.  But then somewhere around the<br/>
first bubble of level 6 healthy wolves become green to me.  Grrr.  OK, I<br/>
figure at this point I&#39;ll go hunt frogloks in the sewers.  <br/>
<br/>
Just before leaving I see the guy running around in circles and hear someone<br/>
shout &quot;A gold for whoever finds my corpse!&quot;  I click on the headless-chicken<br/>
impersonator & sure enough, it&#39;s him.   So I do a who all, figuring it&#39;s<br/>
some newbie who wants his guild robe back & discover he&#39;s a 6th level druid.<br/>
And I&#39;m thinking &quot;no way!  A 6th level druid lost his corpse in the hills?<br/>
Shameful!&quot;  So OK, I hit Lyssa&#39;s to see, purely out of curiousity, where<br/>
this guy bought it.  His corpse beckons me in the direction of the pond.<br/>
And I&#39;m thinking &quot;no way!  He lost his corpse this close to surefall?<br/>
Disgraceful!&quot;  But then I half run, half slide down this one steep hill and<br/>
suddenly the beckoning of his corpse spins me round.  &quot;Hmm,&quot; I think, &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
recall running by a corpse&quot;  I look up, still don&#39;t see it.  I take a few<br/>
steps and...what&#39;s this?  A foot and the letters &quot;pse&quot; sticking out of the<br/>
side of the hill?  Dang!  So, ok, take back everything I was thinking about<br/>
the guy.  That one would have been a ball-buster for anyone other than a<br/>
bard or necro.  <br/>
<br/>
I tell him I&#39;ve found it and, having pity on the guy & not wanting to take<br/>
his money, offer to just give him the LOC.  But he says he doesn&#39;t really<br/>
understand how LOC works & wants to meet me somewhere.  So I figure OK, for<br/>
leading him to his corpse and giving him a brief course on how LOC works I&#39;d<br/>
feel OK about taking a gold.  Suddenly two rabid wolves attack me.   Now,<br/>
mind you, rabid wolves are still white to me, as are skeletons.  I took down<br/>
both of them, had a bubble & a half left, then a skeleton wacks  me.  I died<br/>
with barely a dent in the sketeton&#39;s HP.  Somehow I don&#39;t think those bones<br/>
are con-ing quite right.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I tell this druid my corpse is now 10 feet from his & to meet me at<br/>
the cottage.  I get there, hit Lyssa&#39;s and we&#39;re off.  I slide down the same<br/>
hill - past his corpse again, and right into the waiting jaws of another<br/>
wolf.   Grrr.  I say to the druid &quot;Got any weapons?&quot; as I bitch-slap the pup<br/>
for one point a turn.  He slides down and pulls the thing off of me.  I<br/>
thank him.  He thanks me and gives me a gold.  &quot;Now to find your corpse,&quot; he<br/>
says.  So I run back up the hill & start looting, thanking him again for<br/>
watching over me while I loot.  <br/>
<br/>
We part company and it occurs to me I never explained LOC to him.  I turn<br/>
around to see if he&#39;s still in the area and WHACK, a skeleton hits me.<br/>
What&#39;s more, it&#39;s armed.  Reflexively, I hit auto-run, Shift-2, Selo&#39;s,<br/>
Shift-1, Axe in the pocket, Drum in the hand, sheild on the cursor, and this<br/>
little bard went pee pee pee all the way home!   :-)  Well actually I<br/>
stopped at the cottage & turned to make sure I wasn&#39;t training this thing<br/>
into the newbyish area.   Have to laugh though.  Any bard that frets over<br/>
out-running a skeleton ought to hang up his drum and go buy a damned memory<br/>
upgrade!<br/>
<br/>
More on my adventures in the sewers after I get some coffee.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I suppose I ought to get some work done too, huh?  :-)<br/>
