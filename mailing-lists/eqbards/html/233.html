&gt;Apparently you can complete the drum quest in Kelethin as often as you like,<br/>
&gt;but I happened on spider silk at Lv 10 and thought I could use a spare drum.<br/>
&gt;Lo and behold, 1 gp, but no drum.  I can afford to buy one suppose.<br/>

to dearest Sylvia.  She was just as happy to give me drums as<br/>
reward as she has always been!<br/>
<br/>
I cannot figure out why you might not have gotten one...<br/>
Hopefully the next time (should there be one) you will have<br/>
more luck!<br/>
