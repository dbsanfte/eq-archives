<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964509967">Thank you all for the exhalent equipment ideas last week I went from 24th to<br/>
26th in 2 days fighting in High Keep.<br/>
Now I have more questions.<br/>
1. In HK on my server (Rathe) there are usually 3 groups, one lookout room<br/>
group who pull lookout room,stairs and corner and 2 pit groups who pull from<br/>
ramp,raider and warrior room at once. My question is...Since we are not in<br/>
the rooms is it safe to use all instrument attack in the area outside the<br/>
lookout room?<br/>
2. Something is defiantly going on with chains..I was trying to<br/>
chain/fear...it was all I could do to keep chains up.<br/>
