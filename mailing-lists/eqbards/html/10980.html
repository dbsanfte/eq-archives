<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659167466"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It dispelled Skin like Steel that a ranger had just cast on me (i.e.<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t have &quot;naturally worn off&quot; at the same time song played).  Haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tried it vs anything NPC cast yet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  The song affected none of my shield icons.  Maybe I didn&#39;t let it play<br/>
  long enough.  On a side note, I caught some player with blood boil at<br/>
  the zoneline, and he reported that it cleared it.  I tried it again<br/>
  last night, and one player said it cleared it after three pulses.<br/>
  I need to test blood boil (heat blood line) more.  I&#39;m gonna try <br/>
  to login today and duel a few people now that I am realizing it<br/>
  could take more than one pulse to destroy an effect.  As for knocking<br/>
  down your shield icons, I need to look into that more.<br/>
