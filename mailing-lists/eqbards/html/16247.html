 </span></blockquote>I believe the Linux client was actually done before the Win32 client if I<br/>
remember correctly. At my last job a bunch of folks knew the first dev team<br/>
well and one fellow in particular knew the fellow who wrote the linux<br/>
client. As a funny side note, there was a group of big gun network<br/>
programmers in town who thought UO was a great idea and offered to help with<br/>
the network code for *free* just to make sure it was done well. The offer<br/>
was turned down...and the rest, as they say, is history.<br/>
