 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s what the frenzy code does.  I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>
once I&#39;ve killed enough orcs in Oasis, others that are well<br/>
out of my sight (much less their normal aggro range) will come<br/>
running at me.  At first I attributed it to an invisible GM<br/>
toying with us, but I&#39;ve seen it often and consistently enough<br/>
now that I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a feature.<br/>

Unfortunately, Oasis is about the only place where there are<br/>
enough wandering mobs for this to be effective.  And the place<br/>
most people choose to fight is right at the zone border to<br/>
North Ro, and zoning seems to reset this behavior.<br/>
