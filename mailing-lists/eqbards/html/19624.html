<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183477714">To throw my 2 cents in, since my name was mentioned... :p<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;true&quot; random would be something like a roulette wheel (assuming <br/>
it&#39;s not fixed by the house :p) or a deck of cards.  As far as I <br/>
know, there is _NO_ (double emphasis on that one :p) possible way for <br/>
a computer to generate a pure random number.  But, there are many <br/>
ways to &quot;fake&quot; a random number, some better than others.  (In my <br/>
college statistics classes we used the random number tables in the <br/>
back of the book... Open the page, point to the number.. Voila!)  I <br/>
definately agree with Slyde and all those who say Verant&#39;s RNG is <br/>
outta whack a bit.<br/>
<br/>
That being said... I don&#39;t have firsthand knowledge of Kaesora, but I <br/>
can&#39;t see any point in why the guy would have lied to me.  I offered <br/>
him 50 pp for the coin based on what he said, but he ended up giving <br/>
it to me for free.  So, it wasn&#39;t like he was trying to UP the <br/>
price.  There could be many things going on... Servers could <br/>
obviously be slightly different in spawn %&#39;s... Or, more than likely, <br/>
the actual spawn % is somewhere between Slyde&#39;s and the guy who gave <br/>
me the coin&#39;s experience with it AND those who&#39;ve gotten it easily.  <br/>
Those on Xegony just had an unlucky weekend... Can I still switch to <br/>
7th Hammer??? :p<br/>
<br/>
To go slightly off topic here... I find it very amusing watching a <br/>
group as each spawn of a rare mob or ph happens.  We were in Dalnir&#39;s <br/>
going for the Necklace of Superiority this weeked for about 12 hours <br/>
total.  We saw 2 drops the first day in 6 1/2 hours and no drops the <br/>
2nd day in 5 1/2.  (I had heard the group that was there the night <br/>
before us had gotten 1 in 8 hours.)  We got the first necklace after <br/>
a little over 2 hours time.  As the 2nd segment of 2 hours <br/>
approached, people started talking about how it must be set on a &quot;10 <br/>
spawn timer&quot;.  (Spawn time is 13 minutes if you want to do the math <br/>
at home :p)  After that 2 hours expired, it turned to &quot;We&#39;re due for <br/>
it to spawn&quot;.  Now, I get caught up in this myself (especially when <br/>
you&#39;re totally bored camping greens, when the only thing that even <br/>
gives exp is the mob you&#39;re looking for), but this is the kind of <br/>
thinking that causes people to go broke in Vegas. :p<br/>
<br/>
From the few samples (I admit, it&#39;s not large enough of a sample size <br/>
to really tell.. would need several hundred spawn cycles), I&#39;m <br/>
putting my money on The Kly being a 5% spawn.  And just try <br/>
convincing those of a superstitious nature that if you go 19 kills <br/>
without The Kly that you really, no _REALLY_ don&#39;t have a better <br/>
chance of seeing him on the next spawn. :-D<br/>
<br/>
The good news is: the RNG turned up a 334 on a /random 1 392 and I <br/>
won the 2nd Necklace!!!  Now I&#39;ve got the headache of trying to <br/>
decide whether to keep it, or trade it. :)<br/>
