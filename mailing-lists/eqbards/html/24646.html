<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209701000">I&#39;ve been hunting there since 38. I got a Guardian BP, Sentry Pauldrons and<br/>
a Guardian Girdle which is one of the phatest items for a bard for a waist<br/>
slot. 12 AC 2wt +5 CHA and some other stats. I&#39;m currently working on<br/>
getting Guardian arms and legs. XP is decent but I mainly hunt here for the<br/>
armor. The songs I use while grouped are. Berserk Cresc, Furfils, Chant of<br/>
Flame. On some casting mobs I usually twist in Denon&#39;s Dissension to keep<br/>
them from casting complete heals on themselves. Also throw in some DS&#39;s.<br/>
Either Cooling or Warmth will work. Lastly of course Bewitch Brauvura is a<br/>
must for crowd control. Pixie Strike will work too, but I prefer to have the<br/>
mob work for us instead of standing there loafing about. One last thing, you<br/>
can use invis song to scout out the area, BUT, be very careful in the<br/>
Courtyard. There are some named drakes in the left corner that see invis.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen those drakes take out a group of 50+&#39;s very quickly, and the<br/>
highest con, Suez, is only yellow to me at 42. If they all agro I&#39;d make for<br/>
the zone. Try and get your CS key first so you have another zone available<br/>
in the Courtyard. Ziglark, a named drake drops the key every time and hes<br/>
only lvl 26ish. He is guarded by two Guardians though. Also, last note for<br/>
those of you going to SS, do not engage the two sentries at the entrance.<br/>
They will be green but they have uber hitpoints and still hit hard. Whenever<br/>
I get in trouble and make for the zone I always charm one and let him take<br/>
things out while I get the hell out of there.<br/>

<br/>
  Been grouping in Skyshrine with some higher level friends -- the dropped<br/>
armor there totally rocks -- and a full set of it will take your resists<br/>
right off the charts.<br/>
<br/>
  I know a 52 druid there soloing to twink his 23 warrior.  Are any bards<br/>
doing this?  If so, what level and what songs are you using?<br/>
