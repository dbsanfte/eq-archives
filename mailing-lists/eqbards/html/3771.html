&gt; home.  Hope charismatic carillon plus the dark elf illusion of the mask of<br/>
&gt; the deceiver gets me there, i&#39;ve never been to neriak.  Might try a mule.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ll see, thanks so much for this post John!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found out about this quest a few days ago and have been trying to<br/>
complete it (since I have a lute in the bank). Unfortunately, while I know<br/>
I won&#39;t have trouble finding Lord Grimrot, since he&#39;s always in the same<br/>
place, I haven&#39;t had any luck finding Dekam N&#39;Tazi (with a DE SK mule). No<br/>
one I&#39;ve talked to has seen him either. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone spots him, please let us know where. =)<br/>
