useful for short hops through dangerous territory.  You lead,<br/>
everyone /follows you.  You switch to walking, everyone else<br/>
keeps running.  You go your merry way and nobody should fall<br/>
out of range.  That&#39;s what I did to help a friend recover his<br/>
corpse in Nektulos right out from under the eyes of two dark<br/>
elf guards. Just be sure you switch back to run mode if you<br/>
have to run, although at my level it&#39;s gotten so I can<br/>
Accelerando-walk faster than most mobs can run.<br/>

By the way, you&#39;re not invisible if any other song is playing.  <br/>
If you have a second bard in the group, if he plays a song<br/>
while you play Invis, his song will give you away.  The same<br/>
applies if you have the invisibility spell cast on you and you<br/>
try to charge through somewhere playing Accelerando.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll reiterate that being a bard is very dangerous if a<br/>
member of your party is KOS.  Say you&#39;re escorting a dark elf<br/>
to the Freeport docks using Invisibility.  If he should become<br/>
visible and the guards attack him, the next time your song<br/>
pulses, the guards see that as you helping someone they want<br/>
to kill, and thus they will want to kill you as well.<br/>
