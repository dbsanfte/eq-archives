<div id="ygrps-yiv-768171533"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I will be bold and say that well if you really feel the <br/>
&gt;need to be able to be bound anywhere, play a class that <br/>
&gt;can bind. If you cant live without the bind spell, then a <br/>
&gt;bard, warrior, ranger, shadowknight, paladin, rogue is <br/>
&gt;properly not your kind of class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great, just what we need a bunch of pansy wizards and wimpy<br/>
druids running around.  By making a comment like the one <br/>
above, you alienate 50% of the players of the game.  This<br/>
is not the intention on a company who would like to make<br/>
money.  Last time I saw a party without a melee player, they<br/>
littered the floor of SolB, dead.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Let us morons who dont mind running the 1208402 (or 2-3 <br/>
&gt;which is much more common) zones to get our corpse play <br/>
&gt;the other classes. I still think that I can get to almost <br/>
&gt;any zone within a reasonble amount of time<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate to say this, but you&#39;ve misspoken.  Gain some levels and <br/>
graduate from Blackburrow.  We had to Succor to North Karana<br/>
3 f&#39;ing times the other night.  It&#39;s a MINIMUM 10 min run<br/>
back to Permafrost.  But the casters just personal gated <br/>
right back into the action.  It doesn&#39;t always have to do<br/>
with corpse recovery.  I was bound in Halas, and _still_ had<br/>
a long walk ahead of me.   I am the fasting moving thing in <br/>
Norrath save two things, bards higher than me and SoN.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s completely idiotic that I cannot be bound anywhere a <br/>
caster will bind me.  You don&#39;t need a popup box, because<br/>
you already have to be in a group with the person.  How can<br/>
someone maliciously bind me unless I group with them?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired of running from Arena to Guk, and running from <br/>
North Karana to Permafrost when all my other group members<br/>
are either 1) waiting for us melee folk  2) blasting up <br/>
monsters left and right, gaining exp/loot.<br/>
<br/>
It ruins my night.  And as it ruins more and more people&#39;s <br/>
fun, you will most likely see this change - count on it.<br/>
