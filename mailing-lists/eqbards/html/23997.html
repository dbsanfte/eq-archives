 </span></blockquote>actually we are very good dungeon pullers.  sounds like you had a resist.  ah well<br/>
it happens sometimes.  you just have to be willing to bite it to save the group, get<br/>
rezzed and try again.  same as when an sk or monk pulls, occasionally there will<br/>
be too many casters (which messes up fd) or they fail a fd check.  then they just<br/>
die and get rezzed and try again.<br/>

&gt;casters, I was dead faster than I could warn the group.  With that less than<br/>
&gt;stellar record, even contemplating trying to lull 2 or 3 before pulling 1 is<br/>
&gt;less than appealing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i&#39;m not familiar with dalnirs, but in general, a large part of being a good puller is learning<br/>
the aggro ranges and pathing in the area.  another part is being willing to die when<br/>
things go wrong.  the number one priority is to not get the group killed by a train.<br/>
