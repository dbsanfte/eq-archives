<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964818250">&quot;Paying 10 pp to loot griffenne charm&quot; is a frequent<br/>
shout in NK on my server...at 28, griffennes have to<br/>
be kited if I am solo and twice this week I have<br/>
fallen afoul of Grimfeather, lost three griffennes to<br/>
wondering guards and had to zone numerous times due to<br/>
<br/>
flying friends of my erstwhile victim ... and once<br/>
because of a hill giant deciding to join in the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Then I see a 17th lvl bard dressed in blue.  A quick<br/>
greeting and I find he also has a mistmoore drum.<br/>
sigh...<br/>

&gt; not looting one on five<br/>
&gt; attempts is nothing to get too concerned over.  Its<br/>
&gt; just a nuisiance at this<br/>
&gt; point.  IIRC, someone posted a long time ago on the<br/>
&gt; list a method to<br/>
&gt; guarantee a griffenne would spawn.  The poster<br/>
&gt; mentioned a /loc to go to<br/>
&gt; somewhere in NK.  Does anyone remember the details<br/>
&gt; of this post?  Also, I<br/>
&gt; recall someone saying that the only mobs who were<br/>
&gt; placeholders for<br/>
&gt; griffennes were griffawns.  Killing the other mobs<br/>
&gt; in NK will not increase<br/>
&gt; the chances of getting a griffenne to spawn.  Is<br/>
&gt; that true?<br/>
