<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685760869">Yes, it comes back to a couple things:<br/>
<br/>
a) designers who dont really play the game and thus dont really know how<br/>
things are going to work out<br/>
<br/>
b) desgin goals that sounded great conceptually but when it came time to<br/>
implement them got left out<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is sort of &quot;the chicken and the egg - which came first&quot; to play a<br/>
game that you are designing but they did have an extended series of beta<br/>
tests.  Even today, their goals are lofty but their ideas on how to<br/>
implement them are clueless.  Ie: over crowding is a problem but &quot;play nice&quot;<br/>
is not a workable solution.  Forget about the debate whether sharing spawns<br/>
is correct or not.  Adding something as labor intensive resolving all these<br/>
player disputes to the guide/gm work load when they are currently<br/>
understaffed is the joke.  Why have a policy that cant be enforced equally?<br/>
And why make your already scare rescources even more burdened?<br/>
<br/>
Look at all the stat items: str, sta, agi, dex, cha, wis, int.  I would<br/>
guess that they intended that al lof these would be factors in the equation<br/>
but when they tried to put them all in, things either got way too complex<br/>
for them to control or the program did not run well so they took some out.<br/>
Why would you have meaningless stats?  Same with quests.  Good idea.  But<br/>
what do we see?  A bunch of low level ones that newbies try once or twice<br/>
then learn from their experience that quests are not worth doing.  What<br/>
quests are actually worth doing? Soulfire, Fiery Avenger - class specific.<br/>
Jboots - wtg verant you moved campers from one zone to another.  The cleric<br/>
shield - class specific.  The replacement rubi armors?  These were good but<br/>
where is the special bardic weapon?<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, the success of EQ will let them properly fund the dev team for<br/>
the Star Wars thing and hopefully they will learn from their experiences.<br/>
