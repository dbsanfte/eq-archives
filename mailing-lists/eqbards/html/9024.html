<div id="ygrps-yiv-979156199">Quite simply : greater and better versions of healing spell are AWESOME <br/>
taunts. I guess he used one and your lizzie was close enough to see his bud <br/>
fighting a healer. :)<br/>
Using greater healing with my cleric I usually pull all the MOBs to me or <br/>
all but the one tanks are beating upon (hopefully).<br/>
Guess that&#39;s why clerics and bards get this heavy armor too, and not only <br/>
tanks.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; I was in Cazic the other night  with my mid to upper 20s group and we <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt; &gt; pulling this lizard and that lizard. All the way across the courtyard  <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt; an old level 50 cleric friend of mine. We are NOT grouped with him not<br/>
&gt; &gt; having ANYTHING to do what the 50th cleric was doing. AND we are pulling<br/>
&gt; &gt; our pulls to the opposite side of the courtyard. These mobs are INSANELY<br/>
&gt; &gt; green to a 50th cleric considering most are blue to me at 26th. Anyways,<br/>
&gt; &gt; during the course of our battle  I would see the 50th cleric heal one of <br/>
&gt;his<br/>
&gt; &gt; group way across the yard, having nothing to do with our group. Our mob<br/>
&gt; &gt; would make a B line for the cleric and we would be off chasing our pull.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This happened several times. I asked the cleric if perchance he was <br/>
&gt;casting<br/>
&gt; &gt; on our mob or healing us or anything. Nope..  the mob just hated a 50th<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleric helping anyone I guess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My (cynical) guess would be that the other group had a bard in<br/>
&gt;it, and your mob was partially aggro to their bard due to bard<br/>
&gt;hate.  When the cleric healed the bard, that ticked your mob<br/>
&gt;off at him more than anyone in your group, and it went to beat<br/>
&gt;up the cleric. </span></blockquote></div>
