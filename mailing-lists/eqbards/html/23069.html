<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178939898">Ry&#39;gorr armor isnt bad to have. About the same as lambent stuff but looks<br/>
nicer imo.  I replaced my lambent arms/legs with rygorr. I just couldnt<br/>
stand blue/green look anymore.  Now if i could only hit 46 so i could go get<br/>
some imbrued.<br/>

!!!  That&#39;s great of you, but thanks to guildies, I&#39;m all blue except for 1<br/>
bracer!  I *really* appreciate that offer!  Equipment wise, I think I&#39;m<br/>
golden (even instruments...I have MM drums and Lute of Gypsy Princess),<br/>
although offhand, I can&#39;t even think of what I have in the equip slots that<br/>
don&#39;t have lambent pieces for them...<br/>
<br/>
On that note, is there anything better than lambent for us?  I know there<br/>
are singing steel boots (or I think I know...heh), that are supposed to be<br/>
better.  Is there a whole singing steel suit?  Dunno...I kinda like being<br/>
all blue!  :)<br/>

My worst leveling period was 34 to 36 for some odd reason. My cleric mate<br/>
and I set death records and lost level records til some higher level friends<br/>
of ours set us down in Garton&#39;s tower in MM and force feed us exp til we got<br/>
out of that range. We all started going to Kedge Keep about then too, no one<br/>
was there so it was really cool to have bascially your own private dungeon.<br/>
Spent from the high 30s to 50 in KK. I believe strongly this was the dungeon<br/>
V has alluded to as having the best exp modifier in the game. It better, the<br/>
loot completely sucks: just fish aned scales. Rare drops are exactly that in<br/>
KK. I do have the sharkskin drum and maybe my luck is bad but we pulled that<br/>
spawn routinely for most of the levels we spent in KK and we didn&#39;t get it<br/>
til things were starting to go green to us there. <br/>
The brakes really kick in on leveling above 50. It really goes slow. Right<br/>
now, we going to Howling Stones when we can find folks to go. That seems to<br/>
move the exp bar better than anything else we&#39;ve tried.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby I have used on the last 2 years mainly to crowd control extremely<br/>
green stuff. I should put the screenshot I have of me and about 20 froggies<br/>
in Upper Guk somewhere. I think our dispell song is completely random about<br/>
which buff it takes off and thus I never use it. Clerics get upset if you<br/>
strip off your symbol accidently. Twilight is a great song! I use the &#39;come<br/>
hither&#39; part of it as much as I use the mez portion!<br/>
<br/>
Atonal, I&#39;ll give you an armor quest! You catch big Bril in a zone with a<br/>
bank and I&#39;ll give you the 3 or 4 pieces of lambent I have in the bank, if<br/>
you want them. I think I have arms, legs, boots, and a bracer at least. It&#39;s<br/>
just taking up space and I don&#39;t know anyone in my circle of friends nutty<br/>
enough to start a bard anyway. ;)<br/>
