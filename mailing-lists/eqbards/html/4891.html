<div id="ygrps-yiv-583932036">Heh heh, good points as usual Roop.  The problem with the AI seeming so bad<br/>
is that the situations that have to be considered are so complex.  I imagine<br/>
it will continue to evolve as everything else does.  I can hardly wait for<br/>
the day mob&#39;s start to notice their fellows are no longer around and start<br/>
roaming to find the intruders.  Or when after 3 critters are chasing you the<br/>
other just go on guard duty until they realize their friends did not return.<br/>

Personally, I think there&#39;s quite a bit of balance in the classes.  Well,<br/>
individually.  I think magic users are much more powerful than melee types,<br/>
if there&#39;s any imblalance it is in this manner.  It&#39;s all design I suppose,<br/>
but I always felt the battlefield should be for the warriors, while the<br/>
mages stayed back home in their towers (casting spells fropm there!) or<br/>
perhaps stood on hills overlooking the battles.<br/>
<br/>
In EverQuest the mages are very hardy, and exremely powerful--in this world<br/>
the mages are the true masters of the battlefield, and the warriors are<br/>
theoir helpers.  For my tastes, a mage should be a little old man or woman,<br/>
complete weakling, easily slaughtered with a gigantic axe...  That is if one<br/>
could get close to them.  Of course, how could they ever survive in<br/>
Everquest?  So mages can survive battlefields, but they still have all the<br/>
good without the bad (or not enough of it).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, if I could see anything changed in this game.... it would be the<br/>
AI!  The parser NPCs use for the quests is technologically backward.  The<br/>
original Zork games had a more complex parser, and these games are twenty<br/>
years old!!  In fact, EQ really doesn&#39;t parse for a damn.  It is highly<br/>
simplistic for a game so recent.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not the worse of it.  You know, one can always tell how poor a<br/>
game&#39;s AI is by looking at how the game is designed.  In the first<br/>
Civilization, the AI was given a chance against the player by letting the<br/>
computer cheat.  In Alpha Centauri, the computer does not cheat at all!<br/>
<br/>
The AI in EverQuest is so poor, the NPCs cheat blatantly.  Camping is not<br/>
something people do just for items.  People camp everywhere!   Groups don&#39;t<br/>
roam around together, fighting as they go!  They camp, and send out scouts<br/>
to pull.  The AI is very dumb and can be tricked this way.  I have never<br/>
played a game where trains are a way of life, never even played a game where<br/>
Train becomes part of the vocabulary, and I think it&#39;s a problem.  All this<br/>
stems from poor MOB AI.  If anything needs tweaked, it&#39;s not the PCs but the<br/>
NPCs!!!  It inspired me to write a poem.<br/>
<br/>
I wanna be an npc<br/>
But not some stupid orc<br/>
I wanna be an npc<br/>
And be a piece o work<br/>
<br/>
I wanna backstab with me fists and feet<br/>
Dirk don&#39;t need it see<br/>
I&#39;d know and cast and memorize every spell there is<br/>
Mana don&#39;t need it see<br/>
I&#39;d cast and fight and kill with ease<br/>
I&#39;d be a magic monk<br/>
<br/>
I wanna know just everything<br/>
But a bard would be too hard<br/>
See those aren&#39;t good at everything<br/>
Npcs are never bards!<br/>
<br/>
I wanna chase you to the zone so far<br/>
And laugh at all you cowards<br/>
I wanna chase you if you come to close<br/>
And make you camp in corners<br/>
Hah ha ha Hah ha ha<br/>
I would not be pulled you see<br/>
Npcs are are fools you see<br/>
But I would be too smart<br/>
<br/>
I wanna cheat like the computer<br/>
And get stuck in a corner<br/>
I wanna cheat like the computer<br/>
In a group I&#39;d be a horror<br/>
<br/>
