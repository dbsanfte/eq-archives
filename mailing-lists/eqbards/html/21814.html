That&#39;s odd, the thread I posted to the Everquest Boards appears to be gone<br/>
after only a few minutes.  Can anyone else see it?  I know I checked to make<br/>
sure it went thru after I posted it.<br/>

everyone else is saying that this is all bards are good for.  i have<br/>
CONSTANTLY<br/>
been saying that i do NOT see this with my bard and that i have just as many<br/>
options in playing my bard as i had before.  I notice that you two never<br/>
address<br/>
the logical points in my post re: options available to bards at any level.<br/>
you simply<br/>
continue the same old line of lullaby is broken, mez is broken, snare is<br/>
broken<br/>
oh 90% of my options are gone.  i say that if that kills 90% of your options<br/>
then you aren&#39;t playing your bard to the fullest capabilities.<br/>
