<div id="ygrps-yiv-998211892">First off, Ryan, I think you made the right decision ;)  My GF and I have <br/>
had to make concessions to my current 96 hour-a-week schedule (which <br/>
included getting her a job here so we see each other more often <br/>
*grins*).  I also haven&#39;t played EQ in 2 weeks, and haven&#39;t logged more <br/>
than 10 hours in the last 3 months.  I have been playing AC a bit lately <br/>
(Valentine&#39;s day present from the GF), and am disturbed to discover that I <br/>
actually like it.  It seems a lot more laid back (of course, so does EQ at <br/>
lower levels).  The graphics aren&#39;t as nice - and I&#39;m all about graphics - <br/>
but the dynamics are really great.<br/>
I dunno - I&#39;ll probably just keep bouncing from game to game.  Maybe some <br/>
day someone will make one that everyone likes.<br/>

&gt;   First of all, I&#39;m still around, I read you all everyday. =D<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I haven&#39;t played Everquest in about 2 weeks now.  I may not<br/>
&gt;   play Everquest again.  In short, the game was taking away time<br/>
&gt;   I needed to spend working and most importantly taking care of<br/>
&gt;   my girlfriend.  For almost 14 months (since beta 3) she has<br/>
&gt;   endured 6-8 hour sessions of EQ on a daily basis.  Clearly,<br/>
&gt;   the game came before she did in all cases.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Everquest wasn&#39;t that great either, I know I complained about<br/>
&gt;   it often, but I&#39;d keep coming back for the people when I could<br/>
&gt;   have turned and looked 5 feet beside me and spent time with<br/>
&gt;   that one person who counted.  Everquest/Verant are full of<br/>
&gt;   shortcomings and I kept hoping that things would finally get<br/>
&gt;   &#39;fixed&#39; or &#39;work properly&#39; - but that was just a dream.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I want to play again, just not now.  Things are going very well<br/>
&gt;   right now and I don&#39;t want to bring back the frustration that EQ<br/>
&gt;   caused me.  I&#39;ll read the posts here where relevant, but I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   post much.  I&#39;ve got big work projects demanding more and more<br/>
&gt;   time.  I&#39;ve also got a kitten and a beautiful girlfriend demanding<br/>
&gt;   more time as well.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to return and play the<br/>
&gt;   length of time I once played.  But I hope to return soon, maybe in<br/>
&gt;   a few more weeks.<br/>
