<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336573275">Well, GZ replied to my post about fizzles. If this information is<br/>
correct, then I can only assume it is the phenonom John Kim described,<br/>
where we note the unusual. However, AFTER posting this about song<br/>
fizzles, I was playing a level 8 necro. Upon making level 9, I<br/>
Immediately began fizzling. Seems strange huh?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     Well, having seen the formula, all I can say is that our random number<br/>
&gt; generator sometimes does funky things.  There is nothing in our code that<br/>
&gt; makes you fizzle / miss notes more upon leveling.  :)<br/>
