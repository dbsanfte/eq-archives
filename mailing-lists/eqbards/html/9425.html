<div id="ygrps-yiv-762599698">I bask in the glow of attaining my first Lambent item, the Lambent Greaves!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been accumulating pieces for my Lambent Armor now for a few days and<br/>
have TWICE now had 50th level casters that I didn&#39;t know be very friendly<br/>
and follow me around for an hour or so helping me get pieces.  Why?  Because<br/>
for no reason and without payment I had stopped and healed their low level<br/>
secondary characters up, or had bailed them out of sticky situations with<br/>
orcs or something.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s me getting my Icy Greaves item:<br/>
<br/>
You say &#39;Hail an Elite Goblin&#39;<br/>
Alanya begins to cast a spell.<br/>
A Elite Goblin was hit for 985 points of damage by Alanya!!<br/>
A Elite Goblin has been slain by Alanya.<br/>
You say &#39;Damn, girl.  Ice Comet?&#39;<br/>
Alanya says &#39;Yeppers - go loot it.&#39;<br/>
