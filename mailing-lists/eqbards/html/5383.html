Not ten minutes ago, a 25th song bard on Cazic-Thule was looking to<br/>
purchase this instrument, along with the Battle Drums and a bunch of other<br/>
items.  He said he read about it on a web page, and that it enhanced<br/>
stringed (strung?) songs in a similar manner as the Drums, but didn&#39;t say<br/>
anything else about it.  Another myth, or new artifact?<br/>
