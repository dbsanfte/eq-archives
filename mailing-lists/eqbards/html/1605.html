is there another button to push?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Running out of stamina wasn&#39;t my problem.  I was stuck underwater<br/>
and ran out of air.  I learned about singing the stamina song while swimming<br/>
a couple of weeks ago.  While on the boat in the OOT my PC locked up.  When<br/>
I logged back on I was at the bottom of the ocean.  After reaching the top,<br/>
I started the song and swam across the entire OOT until I reached the last<br/>
dock before you reach Butcherblock.  Wouldn&#39;t have been able to do it unless<br/>
I had the stamina song.  That&#39;s the only time I have ever had to use the<br/>
stamina song since I&#39;ve been playing the character.  Anyway, it took me over<br/>
45 minutes real time to get to the dock.  Raised my swimming skill by 40<br/>
points during the trip.  That was the only good thing that came out of the<br/>
whole deal.<br/>
