&gt; &gt;Try to use the message board for bards, not promoting your guild. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This didn&#39;t seem like commercialization to me either. This is a<br/>
&quot;Bard-related&quot; forum, and the Guild is certainly &quot;Bard-related&quot;... so<br/>
advertising/defending/slamming/discussing the Guild in this forum seems<br/>
more like a constructive expansion of the Bard way o&#39;life and is thus A<br/>
Good Thing. Is it any worse than, say, publishing Bard-specific<br/>
spoilers? I for one would interpret that activity as being far more<br/>
unethical than advertising a Guild - and as I will myself contribute to<br/>
some of these spoiler threads... well, you can see just HOW unethical I<br/>
really think it is :)<br/>

PS - And before someone gets the impression that my comments are<br/>
motivated by something other than sheer exuberance, I personally have<br/>
absolutely no interest in this Guild, but just knowing that it is out<br/>
there fills me with a warm and fuzzy feeling that just makes me want to sing.....</div>
