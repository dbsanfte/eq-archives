<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; * Yes *  And talk to the guy banker - he talks about giving you something &quot;a<br/>
&gt; composer&quot; left with him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Woohoo, a quest!  I was being total newbie dork last night.  Hailing<br/>
every thing I could find!  I guess I missed his store, I will keep<br/>
looking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * Not that I have found nor heard of. *  Anyhow, travel is not that hard.<br/>
&gt; And if you go back for songs - train then.  Safefall you will want to have<br/>
&gt; and prolly worth it to do some work to max it. Also, hide is one I<br/>
&gt; neglected.  Trouble is that you need to con something to know if it worked<br/>
&gt; and its capped low so its not as good (not even close) to rogues.  Might<br/>
&gt; have been different if I knew how it worked and maxxed it early. Later on,<br/>
&gt; you can buy your skills up as I probably will.  Although that wastes<br/>
&gt; training points - hmm oh well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was so excited to get my first teleport, I forgot to ask the druid to<br/>
wait a few minutes so I could run to HH and Quenos (I was in S Karana)<br/>
to buy the lvl 23 and 25 songs and put them in the bank. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of firsts, Sunday was my first teleport, my first rez (After<br/>
bragging about outrunning two avocets with 10hp left, I zone back in<br/>
only to pulse my heal song on my retreating cleric.  Whack!  Cleric<br/>
dead!  Whack!  Elfson dead!).  My first trip to ROK, my first boat<br/>
problem ever! (amazing considering I have been playing since release,<br/>
when the boats used to crash all the time).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; * Heh * And I was thinking that the agro radius is pretty small or there is<br/>
&gt; some delay.  Stuff that should agro, I can run by fairly close.  Stuff that<br/>
&gt; does agro, I can out run pretty easily.  I love my bard!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  Man those tall gnoll things (sarnaks?) agro me before I can see<br/>
them (I have to turn my clip plane to min since I am still having heavy<br/>
fog video card problems).  Even the UD in Kithikor don&#39;t agro on me till<br/>
i can see them.<br/>
<br/>
One more question:  Does everyone get random faction hits in ROK?  The<br/>
whole time I was there I was getting random faction hits.  I assumed its<br/>
was a bard bug, but the rest of party was getting them too (not at the<br/>
same time, though)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
