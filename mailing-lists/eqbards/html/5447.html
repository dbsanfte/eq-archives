<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210233664">Luckily I havent had a large dying episode lately.  I am well known in my<br/>
guild for dying way too often =).  The last big run was dying 4 time in<br/>
Cazic Thule.  BTW having a slow computer can suck just as bad.<br/>

Apparently the server let&#39;s you linger in the zone you are zoning from.  I<br/>
have died that way to a DVinn in my younger days.  Zone with 2 bubbles and<br/>
appear in my at my bind point.<br/>

&gt; Damn, was last night everyone&#39;s night to die multiple times?  <br/>
&gt; I had my first triple-death night since I was trying to help<br/>
&gt; someone find and retrieve their corpse in Runnyeye 5 levels<br/>
&gt; ago.  Barely held onto 32.  I made the mistake of running back<br/>
&gt; to Cazic without a flute, and ended up stuck at the zone with<br/>
&gt; a train on one side and a bouncer on the other.  Sometimes<br/>
&gt; having a fast computer that zones quickly is not a good<br/>
&gt; thing...<br/>
