 </span></blockquote>It takes me at least an hour to calm down after I log out of EQ, sometimes<br/>
longer.  God forbid I have to do anything important or use my brain because<br/>
I wander around in this sort of EQ haze with half my reality stuck behind in<br/>
Norrath while I view the texturemaps of real life with strange awe and<br/>
confusion.  I know some people who play EQ on their lunch breaks, I could<br/>
never pull this off and still manage to function in society.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been spending a LOT of time lower guk lately and every single time I<br/>
see an image of a frog in real life I slip off into a brief flashback sort<br/>
of muse and my eyes glaze over for a moment...then I snap back to reality<br/>
and /em chuckle.<br/>
<br/>
Rest assured, we are all a bit insane because of this game.<br/>
