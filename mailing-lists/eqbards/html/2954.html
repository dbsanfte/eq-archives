<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000454188">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently been discovering just how versatile the hotkeys are.  But I had not realized that I could put my songs there ... how wonderful!  Please, can you tell me how I do that??  I hate trying to click on those little spell buttons ... waaaayyyy over there on the left.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a better way to do this!!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I lost a Mino Axe at lvl 9 and destroyed a Combine LS before perfecting<br/>
&gt; my juggle<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are 2 methods that work - in battle and out of battle<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When out of battle I switch to inventory, then pick up the item from my<br/>
&gt; hand.  Drop it on an open inventory spot or switch with the item I<br/>
&gt; want.   AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.<br/>
&gt; I drop the new item I want to hold - ON THE PICTURE!!!<br/>
&gt; It will drop into the melee hand automatically.  you do not have to<br/>
&gt; place it in the little melee box.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I recommend turning on off the quick destroy option though - see above.<br/>
&gt;  One time I dropped a little too fast and clicked the destroy button.<br/>
&gt; OUCH!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When in battle I set up one page of quick buttons to be inventory and<br/>
&gt; melee spots<br/>
&gt; a quick Shift 2 - and the melee and open inventory spots are all right<br/>
&gt; there close to each other - switching is fast<br/>
&gt; Then Shift 1 back to my bank of song quick buttons<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Warning - you can still drop items if you miss these boxes, but its<br/>
&gt; harder to do that than dropping from your inventory screen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is much faster than going to inventory and moving the mouse as<br/>
&gt; much as you need to for the juggle.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Quick Keys/Songs<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I&#39;ve seen people mention they have songs on the quick buttons.  I&#39;m wondering what the advantages of this over using the standards spell slots along the top side of the screen.  Is it just personal preference - or is there in fact an advantage?  Maybe its just habits.  I didn&#39;t know about the quick-keys doing anything but holding &quot;abilities&quot; until about level 8 and got used to clicking songs in the above slots...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The advantage is in twisting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Instead of moving the mouse and clicking - esp hard during some mage<br/>
&gt; spells due to screen saturation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You just hit a number key -<br/>
&gt; when I twist I have say - Antham on #3 Bellow #5 and protection #2<br/>
&gt; it goes something like this<br/>
&gt; hit 3 - wait for 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>
&gt; hit 5 hit 5 - wait 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>
&gt; hit 2 hit 2 - wait 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>
&gt; hit 3 hit 3 ....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You get the timing down after only a couple battles, you stop even<br/>
&gt; having to see the text saying your song is in effect. --- WAY better<br/>
&gt; than mouse clicking.<br/>

&gt; Does anyone *not* have this problem?  My system is pretty high<br/>
&gt; end (Celeron 450, 128MB RAM, Voodoo 3 card) and ever since I<br/>
&gt; got the extra lights at L24, unless I turn particle density<br/>
&gt; off (meaning I don&#39;t see spell effects like root at all), I go<br/>
&gt; from twisting 3 songs easily to barely twisting 2.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; thinking of changing my video card because a friend with a<br/>
&gt; Riva TNT said it wasn&#39;t that bad on her system (same CPU<br/>
&gt; speed, RAM).  Of course she isn&#39;t a bard so she doesn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to juggle songs.  Do any of you have an easy time twisting<br/>
&gt; with lots of spells flying?  What video card do you use?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The thing that really irks me about this is that it&#39;s a client<br/>
&gt; side problem.  The determination that &quot;you haven&#39;t yet<br/>
&gt; recovered&quot; to sing another song is completely client side, and<br/>
&gt; completely dependent on the speed of your system.  When I had<br/>
&gt; a P200 with a Voodoo 1, it took ages for the song buttons to<br/>
&gt; un-grey when I stopped singing.  When I upgraded to my current<br/>
&gt; system, it was almost instant, except as noted above when lots<br/>
&gt; of spells are flying.  I would prefer to be able to turn off<br/>
&gt; the button un-grey animation sequence and suffer a flat time<br/>
&gt; delay which doesn&#39;t change with CPU speed.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not sure John, I have a RIVA TNT and I have been able to twist 3 songs,<br/>
&gt; exactly once successfully.  It a P3 450 with 128m RAM also.  I can twist 2<br/>
&gt; no problem usually, but whenever I hit a summoning animation its hell.<br/>
&gt; Course I have everything on, particle, 2 layer sky, etc.  I&#39;m probably being<br/>
&gt; held back by my connection but there is no dsl in my neighborhood yet.<br/>
