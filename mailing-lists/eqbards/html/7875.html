&gt; &gt;Cured Silk it actually the hardest tailored item (I hear it trivs in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;130&#39;s).  So the best route for talioring is Patchwork -&gt; Raw Silk -&gt;<br/>
&gt;Studded<br/>
&gt; &gt;armor -&gt; Reinforced Armor -&gt; Cured silk.  I am currently on the studded<br/>
&gt; &gt;armor phase (skill 51).  Tailoring is a pain due to the scarcity of <br/>
&gt;medium<br/>
&gt; &gt;and high quality pelts/skins and the fact that you need to be a good <br/>
&gt;smith<br/>
&gt; &gt;or have a friend that is one to progress.  Good luck!<br/>

&gt;Don&#39;t know who told you that Rokenn but they sold you a bill of goods.  I<br/>
&gt;succeed on 66% of Cured silk tunics at skill of 44.  I made my first one at<br/>
&gt;35.  If you try Cured silk you should succeed a lot at 51 I think.  Either<br/>
&gt;that or I am just the luckiest silk tailor in all of Norrath as I am<br/>
&gt;currently 35 out of 53 for all my Cured Silk attempts rom skill 35 to 44.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;think its more likely it is now :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Patchwork<br/>
&gt;Studded/Raw Silk	(equal difficulty?  They said they lowered Studded)<br/>
&gt;Cured Silk<br/>
&gt;Reinforced Leather<br/>
&gt;Magical Silk	(Shadow Silk here soon?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will have to give cured silk another try.  I tried it once and failed 5 <br/>
times in a row with a skill in the high 30&#39;s.  Raw silk it trival to me at <br/>
51, but studded it not.  A friend of mine told me that studded trivs in the <br/>
low 60s (I think 63).   Time to go spider hunting tonight :)</div>
