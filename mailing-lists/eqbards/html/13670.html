<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818622387">DW Gobs - are hard to pull singles - unless you are level 50.  So get some<br/>
help or maybe try this idea that was posted a while back (by Harmonic):<br/>
<br/>
Go to Lake Rathe (why I cant say except maybe roaming singles can be found<br/>
there?) Get levitate and SoW.  Track (ok have ranger friend track) DW<br/>
gobbies. Get right on top of them and agro them with Chords or other AE<br/>
song. Run for the zone.  Have a ranger cast snare on one and zone out then<br/>
right back in.  Find the snared one and kill him. Pray that he has a helm<br/>
and that you wont have to repeat this 20 times.<br/>
<br/>
When I got mine, I was mid 30&#39;s and with a 40+ Enchanter, Cleric & SK.  They<br/>
were pulling from the underwater tower in Oasis.  They had broken the spawn<br/>
apart by the time I got there so I dont know what exactly they did.  We had<br/>
to kill more than a dozen before we got an opalline helm.<br/>

&gt;     I WANT the lambent helm - and have the Mudwater Rune - so I need the<br/>
Opoline Helm.  I recall a discussion of these some time ago - and the<br/>
archive search engine at www.onelist.com is basically useless (trust me - I<br/>
tried...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I do recall (and have heard from others on the server) that the<br/>
problem of course is breaking the spawn; but I am looking for advice on what<br/>
levels the party needs to be and other pulling techniques (does harmony or<br/>
lament work, etc)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
