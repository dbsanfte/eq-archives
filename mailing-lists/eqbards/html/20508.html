<div id="ygrps-yiv-582858324">ROFL, I LOVE stories like that!<br/>
<br/>
My own (less dramatic one) is that I once was the only survivor of a goblin<br/>
necro attack on a group at the Giant Fort in the Frontier Mountains, the<br/>
only reason I survived is that after taking me to 1/3 bub of health he<br/>
feared me and I outran his agro range (and TOWARDS the lake zone). I had<br/>
selos up as I had been planning on leaving soon anyway :o) Someone probably<br/>
engaged him as well, but the upshot was when fear wore off I armed the drum<br/>
and singing hymn and selos limped to the lake zone. <br/>
