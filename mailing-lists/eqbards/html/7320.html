<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-721523323">There was some discussion earlier about the Lute of the Gypsy Princess and<br/>
whether or not it had any magical effects... but I don&#39;t remember anyone<br/>
testing it and posting their findings here.<br/>
<br/>
I have now seen on several websites that the Lute has recently been upgraded<br/>
to increase the power of Stringed instruments by 25%.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm this please? Should be easy to test with the healing<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
