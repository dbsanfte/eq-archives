<div id="ygrps-yiv-418150492">The reason I decided to make the song not stack with other haste<br/>
items/spells is to purely make it more appealing to Verant. We all know<br/>
that they hate us winning so I didn&#39;t want to overpower the song too much.<br/>
I think it would be good to stack with haste items however. The idea of my<br/>
song was to make the melee&#39;ers fight at twice there normal speed (this<br/>
should include haste items I suppose).<br/>
<br/>
So a warrior dual wielding Yaks with a haste sash would normally fight 15%<br/>
faster (Yak delay from 24 down to 20.4).  Once the song is fired up it<br/>
would allow the melee&#39;ers to fight at twice normal speed (yak delay with<br/>
sash = 20.4 / 2 = 10.2). Now thats a pretty awesome delay, imagine hitting<br/>
at twice the dmg also this would make a massive difference to the melee<br/>
side of a fight.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so we have Bob the warrior, with a delay of 10.2 for each Yak. He is<br/>
now also hitting at double normal dmg (my bard does 28-32 dmg max with his<br/>
Yak. So I would imagine Bob the warrior would do 30-40 dmg. Double this<br/>
allows Bob to hit for 60-80 dmg.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have the overview, we can see the pure destructive power of this<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
Bob now hits for 60-80 dmg with a delay on each weapon of 10.2 for the next<br/>
18 seconds. Sounds rather nasty, thats just 1 warrior, add a few more<br/>
melee&#39;ers such as a ranger/paladin or monk &lt;grin&gt; and the bard of course<br/>
you are gonna get some serious dmg dealt. The fact it lasts 18 seconds is<br/>
because if it lasted any longer Verant would consider this too powerfull.<br/>
The fact that it can&#39;t be used for 5-10 minutes also means that a bard<br/>
can&#39;t use it in the same fight twice.<br/>
<br/>
This is a song I felt really defined the bard class as what they are there<br/>
to do, it inspires fellow comrades to fight with almighty rage and courage.<br/>
Another thing that could be added to this song is a mana based element to<br/>
benefit casters also. Such as spells can be cast at 1/2 mana cost (think<br/>
this would be too powerful). Or prehaps half casting time for spells. Or if<br/>
not for this song use it as another song slot.<br/>

&gt; You&#39;re still using the song at that level for Haste effect?  I was under<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; impression Alacrity was a 40% speedup and that&#39;s available long before<br/>
that.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a little confused now.  Aren&#39;t there already speedups that are nearly<br/>
&gt; that good, just not bard speedups, that last for far longer than 18 secs?<br/>
<br/>
IIRC, enchanter Alacrity was a 25% reduction in delay.<br/>
Enchanter Celerity was a 30% reduction in delay.  Bard<br/>
Celerity was about a 15% reduction in delay, Beserkers was<br/>
about 17% at 48.<br/>
<br/>
The speedups tend to be rather expensive for enchanters to<br/>
cast, and last about 5-10 minutes.  Buffing four tanks with<br/>
SLTW wipes out a bit more than half a typical enchanter&#39;s mana<br/>
(takes about 2-3 minutes to get it back with their own<br/>
Clarity).  Usually, most of them just stick with Augmentation<br/>
(15% reduction in delay) unless there&#39;s a big fight brewing.<br/>
<br/>
And like I explained, the double damage portion of the<br/>
proposed song more than made up for the short duration IMHO.<br/>
