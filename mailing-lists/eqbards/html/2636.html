<b>Subject:</b> Question about lvl 20 and lvl 21 song <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-789989457">I am currently at lvl 20.  I do not see the used of lvl 20 song at all and I<br/>
was hoping that it does what the song list say it does which is -AC and slow<br/>
down the attack rate.  I do not see that when I used it against a blue.  It<br/>
said that it is binding and all.  could anyone tell me if they have ever had<br/>
any success with this song?  Also I am very close to lvl 21 and I was<br/>
wondering if I should buy it since I am very short on PP.  The lvl 21 song<br/>
is supposed to be very similar to lvl 20 right?<br/>
<br/>
Thnx for the help,<br/>
