&gt; Oooh, I need some clarification on this phrase:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Only a bard with levitate can make it up there.  (since our levitate<br/>
&gt; continues to make you rise up)&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am still a few levels away from the Aria of Eagles but am I to understand<br/>
&gt; that you do not remain hovering at the approximate 6 foot level off the<br/>
&gt; ground that you do when levitated by the magician&#39;s spell form?  I would<br/>
&gt; like to understand the workings of this song if anyone can elaborate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is actually only partly true. I&#39;ve seen lots of people make it up<br/>
there with the levitation spell as well. It&#39;s just not as easy. You need<br/>
to sort of walk up the wall and due to the wierd physics of eq you<br/>
occassionally get a foothold which causes levitate to raise you up a<br/>
little higher. The bard song makes it easier because your bobbing up and<br/>
down makes getting that foothold more likely.<br/>
<br/>
We had 40 ppl doing this after our first Vox attempt in which the Lady<br/>
herself 32K&#39;d and all the guards got stuck in the exit passage, allowing<br/>
our GM&#39;s to determine it was a bug and /kill them so we could get our<br/>
bodies back. :)<br/>
