<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928760254">I feel like I should weigh in on this topic of player stealing and<br/>
uber-guilds.  I was an officer in Decadent Few, as close to a Sargent as<br/>
you can get in the game.  The guys in DF were (are) tight knit, but we were<br/>
small.  We definitely operated on 2 levels, A-team and B-team.  I would<br/>
have bet our A-team against any other 6 you want to put together in the<br/>
game and I honestly believe we would have been superior.<br/>
<br/>
But DF for the same reason DF rocked so hard, we were also small: we simply<br/>
would not accept a person unless everyone liked that person.  We only<br/>
actively recruited one player, the rest sort of graphed into and having<br/>
them join was only a technicality.  How ironic, as you&#39;ll see later.  I<br/>
went from 20th to 48th in the same 6 man group - I trusted those other 5<br/>
implictedly.  Without hesitation or reservation I would and did eat death<br/>
after death for them for any reason.  It was a great feeling.<br/>
<br/>
But I got the urge to do dragons and planes.<br/>
<br/>
DF would never be big enough to do them.  The only option was an alliance<br/>
and without sounding arrogant, the only palatable alliance DF would *ever*<br/>
enter into would be one in which we would be recognized as the leader.<br/>
<br/>
Still yet, I wanted to do dragons and planes.<br/>
<br/>
And then it happened, I was invited to attend a dragon raid.  I had made no<br/>
approaches to the guild that invited me, they had made no effort to recruit<br/>
me.  I was, however, friends with several members from alternate means<br/>
(twinks, help with CR, item camps).  But that 1 raid turned into a week of<br/>
non stop events - literally going from nag to vox to hate in one night. <br/>
What a rush!  I wasn&#39;t even concerned with loot, I was honestly nervous,<br/>
anxious and excited - something days in Lower Guk even with hadn&#39;t given me<br/>
in quite some time.  And so it happened - I received a simple tell as we<br/>
were camping after killing Innoruuk: &quot;Hit yes, k?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Its hard to explain it now, in some ways I still feel wretched for leaving<br/>
my friends - that&#39;s what DF was and is, and its more than that: DF was a<br/>
family.  In others, I&#39;m proud I am in LoS - which is like a bigger family. <br/>
One of the sublime joys of LoS is getting the message &quot;Air tonight.&quot;  On a<br/>
Tuesday.  Or &quot;I got coffins, Trakanon or bust. :P&quot; (yes, bust btw ;)  In<br/>
retrospect my only regret is that my A-team couldn&#39;t have come with me when<br/>
I joined LoS.  They are and will continue to be my crew even when<br/>
everything else is gone and we move on to the next thing.<br/>
<br/>
So... I guess player stealing isn&#39;t cut and dry - it certainly wasn&#39;t for<br/>
me, it just happened.  Neither are uber-guilds -- except FoH. :P<br/>
<br/>
