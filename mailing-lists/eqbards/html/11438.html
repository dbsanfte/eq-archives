<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131537314">The post from Brad was totally bogus as usual, my comments below.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Check out this thread. I posted these comments. Anyone else agree with me?<br/>

&gt;+ Added stat and other bonuses to instruments<br/>
&gt;Where? None of my instrument stats changed for the better IE: Bonus? means<br/>
&gt;something added, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed, no changes.  No idea what they thought they changed but nothing<br/>
changed except for instruments they listed that no one has ever seen like<br/>
small brass trumpet etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added more Class Specific Quests<br/>
&gt;Lambent. How about some more? Instruments and such. as it is, besides The<br/>
&gt;lambent, bards have some pretty poor quests. (4 I think)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They have not added any others except FedEX runs.  As far as I know except<br/>
for changing the broken lute quest to actually give a spell, lvl 6 Hymn yay,<br/>
no other quests added.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added more Class Specific Items<br/>
&gt;Again, We have very few class specific items. I think they added a grand<br/>
&gt;total of 5<br/>
&gt;Look at warriors. They have millions;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it really 5?  The only bard only adds I know of are all planes or dragon<br/>
items.  Again yay that really helps when you&#39;re below 46th level.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Corrected Bug that let monsters attack you from far distances through<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;pet<br/>
&gt;Didnt know this was an issue, since charm only lasts ten seconds<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t an issue, could never happen to a bard ever.  The pet or the pet&#39;s<br/>
owner had to root the target while the pet was attacking it for this bug to<br/>
occur.  Guess what Brad, we don&#39;t get Root.<br/>
Also how about the nerf to charm that makes it work only on lvl 35 and<br/>
below.  We get to use the spell for 8 levels or so, then on blues for a bit<br/>
more.   Everyone else that gets a charm get to use it for 23+ levels. So<br/>
this nerf hits us harder than other charming classes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added Addition Effects to Some Bard Songs<br/>
&gt;Forgot to mention that Levitate will not work now. Would like to know what<br/>
&gt;effects were added<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like what?  They probably consider making Alenia&#39;s actually do something an<br/>
enhancement.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added New Bard Songs<br/>
&gt;New bard songs?, or do you mean, fixed ones that didn&#39;t work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, missing songs were implemented.  This isn&#39;t an enhancement, its giving<br/>
us something we were always told we would have, and eventually we did get<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Added Ability for Bards to Punch &#39;Magic Only&#39; Creatures<br/>
&gt;I thought I could always do this, with magic gloves<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, this is the only real true part of this post with respect to bards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;+ Increased the Power of Some Bard Songs (c.f. Chant Series,<br/>
&gt;Fifil&#39;s, etc.)<br/>
&gt;Hmm, I have not seen any &quot;Increase&quot; in power of bard songs, only a decrease<br/>
&gt;(IE Lullaby, Lament, Pixie strike, Selo&#39;s) Shouldn&#39;t there be a negative in<br/>
&gt;here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Supposedly increased, no reports by anyone that I have heard of actually<br/>
seeing an increase though.<br/>
<br/>
Gads, can&#39;t wait to reply to this post tonite when I get home.  What a bunch<br/>
of BS.  Left out are the charm nerfs, the Levitate bug, the Accelerando<br/>
nerf, the Lullaby nerf/bug, the DoT nerfs in PvP, the lack of our getting<br/>
the rogue enhancements to Sneak and Hide as only we get those skills as a<br/>
class besides rogues.  The list goes on.  Thankfully I have fewer things to<br/>
reply with for my other characters.<br/>
