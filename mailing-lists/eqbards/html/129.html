<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053771044">Good point made that I completely forgot about since beta...why can&#39;t they<br/>
let us feed in midis?  I&#39;m certainly to tech, but i can&#39;t see why not, if<br/>
certain restrictions are enacted.<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, a KB limit would be logical.<br/>
<br/>
- Restricting WHERE they can be played also seems logical<br/>
Only in a musical area such as bars, or on stages?  They have arena, or PVP<br/>
zones, so I don&#39;t see why they couldn&#39;t do it with midi zones.<br/>
<br/>
- Toggle Switch<br/>
Dont want to hear it?  Turn it off!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect they could implement this for a while, seeing as they still<br/>
have us strumming a stick for a drum motion etc, but maybe we should<br/>
brainstorm for them a bit?<br/>
<br/>
Keep on replying, lets build up some ideas.<br/>
