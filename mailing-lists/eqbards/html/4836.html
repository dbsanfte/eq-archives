<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762707135"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My first night as level 20 and I went<br/>
&gt; to HighHold Keep.  Got into a group with<br/>
&gt; others ranging to 27 with me the lowest<br/>
&gt; most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but with a group of people that high up in level<br/>
(up to 7 above you), isn&#39;t it true that you&#39;d get very little to no<br/>
experience from the fights? I remember when I was level 5 and my friend was<br/>
level 9 and trying to help me out, I stopped getting experience when we were<br/>
grouped because he was 4 levels above me. I&#39;ve heard that even when the<br/>
levels are closer, the people with the higher levels get more experience<br/>
than the lower levels regardless of who does the most damage. Of course if<br/>
you were just there for the fun, it wouldn&#39;t matter - but I was just curious<br/>
if you got any experience from it.</div>
