&gt; Also, our guild has two necros, both have a played days to level ratio far<br/>

&gt; little fear.  Both can take on things that I and my nearest fellow bard have<br/>
&gt; trouble taking on when we group.  Adding either of the necros to one of our<br/>
&gt; groups has proved equivalent to adding any two other characters of similar<br/>
&gt; levels.  If this isn&#39;t imbalance, what the heck is it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Despite all the cries of nerf from necros, necros are still so<br/>
overpowered compared to the other classes that a single necro<br/>
can do things that require several L50s of other classes.  It<br/>
hasn&#39;t been fixed yet, so my guess is that a couple important<br/>
people at Verant play necros and want to keep things that way.<br/>
Seriously, I think class balance is a low priority with them.<br/>
