<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238650967">I don&#39;t remember seeing this posted before so sending it in. On Allakazam&#39;s<br/>
site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">http://everquest.gamestats.com/</a>  , there is updated info on the Lute<br/>
of the Gypsy Princess.  <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt; Lute of the Gypsy Princess: Healing sone does double healing every<br/>
other heal. (May only work for higher level bards) <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this was implemented in one of the two recent patches?  If its true,<br/>
the next question is what level do you need to be to get the bonus.<br/>
