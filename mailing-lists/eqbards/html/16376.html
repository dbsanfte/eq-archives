 </span></blockquote>  And you probably never will outright resist an NPC lifetap.<br/>
  If your Magic Resist is close to 100, he will never Grav Flux<br/>
  however.  (Not that it hurts that bad for us, with Safe Fall)<br/>
<br/>
  If you fight Maestro, Resist Poison + Purifying makes all the<br/>
  difference.  Otherwise, he will actually heal himself in battle<br/>
  to the point where your life is fading quicker than you can <br/>
  knock him out.<br/>
<br/>
  Lifetap is dangerous, it&#39;s not a one-way street like AE breath<br/>
  weapon is.  In a DragonBreath attack you lose health, but in<br/>
  the AE Lifetap attack Maestro is tapping all 24 or so players<br/>
  for several hundred hp.  Each time that&#39;s many thousands of hp<br/>
  you as a group lose, and he as an indiviual gains.  Well, no<br/>
  sh*t... hehe, that&#39;s what a Lifetap is anyway, but most people<br/>
  see their hp dropping and don&#39;t realize that you are beating<br/>
  up an NPC who now has 1/3 of the life of all your tanks added<br/>
  to his own hp.<br/>
<br/>
  An unprepared group is likely to see Maestro gain hit points<br/>
  in battle, as he picks people off one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
  Reso, Shield of Words, Naltron, Resist Magic, Resist Poison, <br/>
  Stamina, Tuna, (augment + other various shaman buffs on tanks)<br/>
  should be all you need.  You as the bard need to supply the<br/>
  additional resist poison and another song of your choice.<br/>
<br/>
  Maestro can tap for up to 2 bubbles (1800 hp) with no resistance.<br/>
  He could only get 0.25 - 1.00 bubbles with (2400 hp) and 120ish<br/>
  poison resist, depending on how close you are to him.<br/>
<br/>
  Food for thought.  Some of this is just a reminder, nothing new.<br/>
