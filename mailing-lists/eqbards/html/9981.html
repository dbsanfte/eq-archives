<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bellow song Damage <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-870522880">I being a level 27 Bard probably use Bellow more than any other song as<br/>
that little extra dmg is great. However I do feel that this song should do<br/>
more dmg than just the 1/2 level +1. It&#39;s quite pathetic to think that at<br/>
level 50 you will only do 26 DMG with it. Currently I am doing 14 dmg and<br/>
it&#39;s good but not good enough to solo stuff without having lots of<br/>
downtime.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I feel that Bellow should be current Level +1 dmg so for example<br/>
at my level (27) I would do 28 dmg per bellow, or as another formula have<br/>
1/2 current level + 5 dmg and an extra 5 dmg every 10 levels, so at level<br/>
12 you do 1/2 level +5 dmg and then at level 22 you do 1/2 Level +10 dmg<br/>
and so on. this would not be over powered when you consider what other<br/>
melee classes get. We have not got Kick, Double attack, bash and don&#39;t get<br/>
Critical hits etc. Plus we can&#39;t use 2 handed weapons.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem I can see with Bellow doing more dmg is that people will<br/>
kite as a bard with a great deal of ease (I kited Born D&#39;inn at level 22<br/>
and it took me 35 minutes to kill him).<br/>
<br/>
I know Bards aren&#39;t supposed to be hardened fighters I just feel we lack<br/>
that cutting edge.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway that if everyone on this list agrees with me or if they<br/>
have another formula suggestion that we could petition verant and get it<br/>
changed? Or are verant only into &#39;Nerfing&#39;??<br/>
