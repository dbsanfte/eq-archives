<div id="ygrps-yiv-648277969">20-25 - rough stage for someone who wont camp and dont like crowded zones<br/>
(because that just about describes everywhere on our server.)<br/>
<br/>
HighKeep - Lookout room and guard room.  But I think that&#39;s camping.<br/>
<br/>
South Karana - KFC crowded but then you have the &quot;Hill of Doom&quot; Head over<br/>
towards the Hermit (camp him if he&#39;s not taken - opps you dont camp - sorry)<br/>
and park on top of one of those hills - kinda between Herman and KFC.  Have<br/>
your ranger track and pull back to the party on the hill. Opps camping<br/>
again?<br/>
<br/>
Cazic-Thule - more trains and crowded but try the sewers - go down from the<br/>
doors above the double doors where you zone in from and explore.<br/>
<br/>
OOT - is there a skelly island where you clear thru skellys to get to some<br/>
gargoyles?<br/>
<br/>
Upper Guk - opps that&#39;s a hard dungeon if you dont have a good group who can<br/>
handle things like crowd control and runner stoppage.  Also, takes some<br/>
exploring to find the good spots and you&#39;d prolly need to invis in, find a<br/>
spot (like way back by ancient croc) and invis out.<br/>
<br/>
Treants, druids - welcome to the dark side! (I was gonna add bards too but<br/>
remembered what list this was going to &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Permafrost - hard dungeon but has stuff. Key to some of these hard places<br/>
might be 2 groups willing to work together.  But you (not you personally but<br/>
generically young 20&#39;s) are lo to mid 20&#39;s and still trying to learn to<br/>
assist the main tank or assist the pet.  Also maybe the Redking (sp?) the<br/>
platform in Everfrost where the Icy Orcs are? Camped? Opps!  that bad word<br/>
again!<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas - but one thing you may need to come to terms with is this<br/>
game has _alot_ of campers and camping.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the area of zones.  Yes, I can hunt on reaver hill.  Mistmoore is too<br/>
&gt; deadly for me as higher levels train things out of the castle too<br/>
frequently<br/>
&gt; to make the entry area safe.  Unrest is packed, last three times I was<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; there were 50+ people in them.  Sol A and Sol B are obviously beyond my<br/>
&gt; groups ability at 21-24.  Haven&#39;t tried Paw since they lowered the<br/>
&gt; difficulty but there was no way before.  Befallen is also fairly crowded<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; most everything there is too low to give me much xp anyhow.  Tried hunting<br/>
&gt; skeletons in rathe but there were too many groups there as well.  Went to<br/>
S<br/>
&gt; Karana but there were 75+ people there mostly hunting aviaks. </span></blockquote></div>
