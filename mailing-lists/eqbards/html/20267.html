<br/>
I&#39;m in Ytrilynth&#39;s Horde.  I&#39;m the only bard in the guild who is a primary,<br/>
but the guild bard I was grouped with last night has been playing a lot<br/>
recently (his primary is a druid), and we have a couple other lower level<br/>
bards who play every once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
Three bards was a blast.  We had one bard doing all instrument CoD, HoR,<br/>
DDD.  Another doing Warmth, Anthem, Bellow.  And I was doing Binding,<br/>
Chains, and Bellow.  We weren&#39;t fighting any casters, and I was the highest<br/>
level bard in the group, so those seem to be the best twists.<br/>
<br/>
Myself and the guild bard were using weapons (he has dual yaks -- twink!).<br/>
The only song I think that we could have changed was Anthem for Chant of<br/>
Battle, but we still had ALOT of fun. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We were constant pull the whole time in Lake of Ill Omen.  I ended up making<br/>
a bub in about 45min or so before the group broke up because of people<br/>
needing to do homework.<br/>

&gt; Heh heh, yeah that is definitely true.  I have been in a lot <br/>
&gt; of groups with<br/>
&gt; two bards and it is great.  I&#39;d love to get in a group with <br/>
&gt; Galtin and you<br/>
&gt; sometime I think we would be very deadly.  Although I think <br/>
&gt; the enchanter<br/>
&gt; would have found that using his two very cheap stun spells <br/>
&gt; would have even<br/>
&gt; made the slaughter more amusing.  Three bards would <br/>
&gt; definitely be a hoot,<br/>
&gt; good grief think of the clarity effects at 32!  Three bards <br/>
&gt; and two nukers<br/>
&gt; with an enchanter would be scary indeed.  I don&#39;t think two <br/>
&gt; many servers<br/>
&gt; have as many bards as we do on E&#39;ci though.  What guild are <br/>
&gt; you in Gilgurth?<br/>
&gt; I know between DoH, Armigers, and Grail Brotherhood we have <br/>
&gt; almost a dozen<br/>
&gt; bards over level 25.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since some people think we bards are very limited when <br/>
&gt; grouped with bards, I<br/>
&gt; thought I would relate what happened to me Tuesday night.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I logged in, two of my guildmates (bard and enchanter) <br/>
&gt; were grouped<br/>
&gt; together with a warrior and another bard.  I was invited to <br/>
&gt; join them.  So<br/>
&gt; our group was 3 bards, warrior, and enchanter.  All of us <br/>
&gt; bards were around<br/>
&gt; level 25, so it worked out where we actually had enough songs <br/>
&gt; for all of us<br/>
&gt; to twist 3 songs each.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The enchanter was giving everyone alacrity, but other than <br/>
&gt; that, he was just<br/>
&gt; medding.  Why?  There was nothing else for him to really do.  <br/>
&gt; He commented<br/>
&gt; on that at one point, and my fellow bard guildmate said, <br/>
&gt; &quot;Sit, med, enjoy<br/>
&gt; the ride!&quot; ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, in this group, it wasn&#39;t the bard who was useless, it was <br/>
&gt; the enchanter.<br/>
&gt; Just thought it was funny.<br/>
