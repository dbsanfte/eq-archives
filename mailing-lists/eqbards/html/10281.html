<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373466513">Since I asked about dual weild just a few days ago, I have received <br/>
wonderful amounts of useful information and advice from you all. Thank you <br/>
all very much for teaching me the ways of weaving and chain/fear&#39;ing and <br/>
other assorted fight and merchanting techniques.<br/>
<br/>
   It&#39;s strange though for me how it came up. I was in Lava or Najena at the <br/>
time with a full group. I was in no particular hurry to get back to the <br/>
guild to train or anything, but when I attempted to equip two melee weapons, <br/>
I could not. I was like ok, I do indeed have to go train on it - no big <br/>
deal. Upon arriving to that guy outside the bard guild in Freeport, I <br/>
scrolled down to my skill to start the basics of. Amazingly enough, I saw <br/>
that they would charge me 1pp and something to train. WOW no thanks I&#39;ll <br/>
talk to you later!! LOL When I went back to fight I was able to weild both <br/>
hands with a weapon. So no harm done, only a little confusion. =)<br/>
   I just thought I&#39;d mention it.<br/>
