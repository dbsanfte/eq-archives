&gt; &gt;I also bought my combine longsword for 52.5pp and my charisma is 90.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just went to the Oasis gypsies yesterday on Veeshan with my 95 charisma <br/>
&gt; and was quoted 54.8 plat.<br/>

following:<br/>
<br/>
What is your race and diety?<br/>
<br/>
How did the gypsies view you (amiable?  indifferent?)<br/>
<br/>
What is the selling price you&#39;re offered for the combine<br/>
longsword at your guild merchant?  (47.5pp here)<br/>
<br/>
Can you check the price for a well-balanced longsword on the<br/>
shady swashbuckler between North Ro and Easy Commonlands?  I<br/>
get 223pp plus change.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The gypsies were indifferent (or amiable) to me. I&#39;m human.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Oasis gypsies are indifferent to me as well.  My bard is a<br/>
wood elf, diety is Erollisi Marr.  (DON&#39;T LAUGH!  I figured<br/>
it&#39;d be nice to be friendly with the paladin guilds and the<br/>
diety description says many paladins follow Erollisi, so I<br/>
picked it.  Now that I&#39;ve played the game some, the only<br/>
followers of Erollisi I&#39;ve found are the Sisters of Erollisi<br/>
in the Ocean of Tears. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed the sisters of Erollisi &quot;kindly consider me&quot;<br/>
instead of considering me amiably or indifferently.  Is this<br/>
what other people are seeing from NPCs with the same diety?<br/>
