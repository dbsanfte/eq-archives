&gt; As I ran to Halas to practice my new song the Aquatic Ayre, I noticed the<br/>

&gt; Equipping my trusty mandolin, I furrowed my brow, and sang and played a Mighty<br/>

I took them out for a test spin today.  First, all those<br/>
undead camps in Kithicor that are usually full of &quot;trash&quot;<br/>
undead (well, trash for a L20 bard)?  Wade right into the<br/>
middle of them, fire up Chords of Dissonance with a lute, and<br/>
just stand there.  Within about a dozen pulses, most zombies<br/>
and skeletons wilt.<br/>
<br/>
Encouraged, I then went to Highpass and tried Denon&#39;s<br/>
Disruptive Discord there. Three mage-types were stealing all<br/>
the orcs (much to the chagrin of the nearly dozen melee types<br/>
there - this really needs to be fixed at some point).  I fired<br/>
up Denon&#39;s again during a rather heated battle with four orcs.  <br/>
It really ticks off the mobs, and three of them ended up<br/>
hitting me down to two bubbles of health.  All the melee types<br/>
were attacking the same orcs, and the mage types were blasting<br/>
their spells.  But when it was all over, I got credit for two<br/>
of the kills without ever having placed a finger on my<br/>
weapons.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I tried stacking it with Chords of Dissonance, but my brass<br/>
skill isn&#39;t high enough to do this consistently yet (after<br/>
today&#39;s experience, that will be remedied shortly).  Also,<br/>
Unlike what some descriptions of CoD say, the mobs continue to<br/>
take damage after you&#39;ve stopped playing it, just like DDD and<br/>
Restoration and Accelerando.  I&#39;d stop playing the song to try<br/>
to start DDD, never get DDD started, and suddenly a skeleton<br/>
or zombie would die without the &quot;winces&quot; message.  So CoD can<br/>
be twisted with Restoration with a lute for maximum damage and<br/>
healing.<br/>
