<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267721727">I would agree if it were not for one thing.  Difficulty of actual play.<br/>
There is no other class which even remotely approaches the actual physical<br/>
difficulty of play which the bard class presents.  I don&#39;t think bards are<br/>
adequately recompensed for that aspect of the playability factor; in fact I<br/>
don&#39;t think it even enters into the equation in Verant&#39;s mind because<br/>
despite their claims to the contrary it is quite evident that no one there<br/>
plays a bard regularly.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that if all the classes were properly balanced we would see a more<br/>
balanced representation of the classes in the overall population.  That is<br/>
not the case.  Certain classes so far outnumber others that it is readily<br/>
apparent there must be a reason for it.  Certain other classes, including<br/>
bards, are so vastly underrepresented that there also must be a reason for<br/>
that.  Personal preference would obviously create some variation, but across<br/>
a population as large as this one that variation would not be at the levels<br/>
we see now.  Below is just a sample from E&#39;ci that I took in the off-peak<br/>
hours when I could get some actual numbers.  Note that &#39;Anonymous&#39; will<br/>
lower the numbers shown for some classes, but typically should be fairly<br/>
equal for all classes except those with high &quot;request&quot; factors like druids,<br/>
shamans, enchanters, and clerics.<br/>
<br/>
Note these numbers are the averages over 4 nites at around 3am mst.<br/>
<br/>
	Warriors		32+	too many to list<br/>
	Rogues		9.5<br/>
	Monks			5.5<br/>
	Rangers		30<br/>
	Paladins		27<br/>
	Shadowknights	17.5<br/>
	Bards			5<br/>
	Wizards		19.25<br/>
	Magicians		29.75<br/>
	Necromancers	32+	too many to list<br/>
	Enchanters		25+	One night there were too many to<br/>
list<br/>
	Clerics		31+	Two nights there were too many to list<br/>
	Druids		32+	too many to list<br/>
	Shamans		23.75<br/>
<br/>
	With over 600 people on the server this means that either half the<br/>
server was 	Anonymous or Roleplaying (Highly unlikely) or those classes<br/>
which were too many 	to list were actually much, much higher than 32 in<br/>
number.<br/>

Wow, I couldn&#39;t agree more!  It has always been my pet peeve to hear people<br/>
say those things... I have never played D&D but I hear it was wonderful<br/>
because you could have the &quot;fighter/mage&quot; which I think is what a lot of<br/>
people look for.. something that is powerful in every aspect.  Despite<br/>
general opinion, I really believe that the best part about EQ is class<br/>
balance, and I think Verant does a pretty good job.  Sure there are<br/>
shortcomings and the system isn&#39;t perfect but I think it works well.<br/>
People, by nature, just generally want it ALL :)  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I personally think our power is balanced with the other classes as the<br/>
&gt; game currently exists and any haste stacking would overpower the bard<br/>
&gt; class.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the flaws that I see in a lot of arguments for more <br/>
&gt; powers is &#39;&#39;in literature<br/>
&gt; bards have...blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or &#39;&#39;in history, bards <br/>
&gt; were....blah blah blah&#39;&#39;, or my<br/>
&gt; favorite, &#39;&#39;in my vision bards should be able to do....blah <br/>
&gt; blah blah, the designer<br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;s vision is obviously wrong&#39;&#39;.  While everquest can be <br/>
&gt; said to be loosely based <br/>
&gt; on various fantasy sources, it is a separate entity and any <br/>
&gt; direct comparisons to<br/>
&gt; external sources really aren&#39;t necessarily a compelling <br/>
&gt; argument for or against anything.<br/>
