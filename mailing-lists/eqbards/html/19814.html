*Patch Day* <br/>
<br/>
Hello everyone, <br/>
<br/>
Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The<br/>
Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future. Even so, a number of<br/>
changes and additions were made in today&#39;s patch. Most of the changes are in<br/>
regards to quests: <br/>
<br/>
- The &quot;Fleshy Orb&quot; quest has been completed - We&#39;ve received word that<br/>
&quot;Fabian&quot; has been spotted somewhere on Norrath. - Froglok Foragers and<br/>
Hunters should been seen more regularly. - Lord Grimrot should be seen more<br/>
frequently. - Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of<br/>
the Lost Circle. <br/>
<br/>
A few items have also been changed this week: <br/>
<br/>
- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced. - The Staff of Temperate<br/>
Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time<br/>
associated with their activatable effect (See Below). - The Gunthak Harpoon<br/>
is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See<br/>
Below.) <br/>
<br/>
*Casting Times on Staff and Rod* <br/>
<br/>
We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to<br/>
&quot;spam&quot; other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to<br/>
disconnect. Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused<br/>
by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out<br/>
spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you. <br/>
<br/>
The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the<br/>
targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to<br/>
stand still to use them now. <br/>
<br/>
*Gunthak Harpoon* <br/>
<br/>
In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon<br/>
&quot;rentable&quot;, meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff. Basically, one<br/>
of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it<br/>
must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it. Unfortunately, the stats<br/>
on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical<br/>
composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in<br/>
obtaining it. <br/>
<br/>
For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the<br/>
next time that you log out. This is a retroactive change and will affect<br/>
weapons already in possession. We do apologize to those who acquired it<br/>
within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon. <br/>
<br/>
*Chat / Login Process* <br/>
<br/>
The Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning<br/>
that players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of<br/>
people in the chat server. <br/>
