<div id="ygrps-yiv-539948882">I&#39;m another one in the Over the Hill gang. At 35, I am not about to start<br/>
doing anymore twitches than needed. About the only times I can think of<br/>
swapping to instruments are: 1) going for my horn to fear more effectively<br/>
til the evac goes off. (I do love having my screen scroll completely with<br/>
those messages that fear has just worn off!) 2) We&#39;re outside and somehow<br/>
just got 20 mobs on us and we&#39;re oom: pulse fear, swap to drum, and run<br/>
away! <br/>
I twisted more songs at once and swapped between instruments and weapons<br/>
more frequently when lower level. Now it is rare I swap and seem to need to<br/>
twist fewer at one time. Maybe the difference between living and dying is<br/>
faster now. Of course I don&#39;t pick my grave as often as I used to either.<br/>
