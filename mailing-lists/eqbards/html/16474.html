<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136117482">Ya know, I get real tired of everyone dissing our songs.  90% of them are<br/>
very well thought out (some are still broken though - chant - no percussion<br/>
addition from drums) and I have yet to get a song that I haven&#39;t had a use<br/>
for...  I&#39;ve been playing bards since Beta 2, I love being a bard and I love<br/>
our songs.  Sure they get a litle &quot;out there&quot; at the higher levels but they<br/>
all have uses.  The only songs I think were poorly thought out were the<br/>
&quot;Psalm&quot; series.  I&#39;d gladly give up their MR/DR/PRetc portions for stronger<br/>
dmg shields but even so they are _still_ useful.<br/>
<br/>
I LIKE that Chains does both the slowdown and the snare.<br/>
<br/>
If you DONT want to use chains then use binding.  But for solo&#39;ing (Yes,<br/>
some of us actually do) it&#39;s awesome to have a snare song that ALSO slows<br/>
down their attack speed.  1 song less to mem and 1 fewer songs I have to<br/>
keep in my medley.<br/>
<br/>
I get so tired of everyone wanting songs that only do one thing.  Chains is<br/>
very useful and powerful when used properly.  I have never had a problem<br/>
getting it to stick on blue, yellow and lower red mobs.  You will _never_<br/>
get it to stick on something 4 or more levels higher than you (ok you might,<br/>
but it&#39;s rare).  But ya know what?  SNARE won&#39;t stick on mobs 4 or more<br/>
levels above you either.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d have been happy if it just snared, I already have Largo&#39;s to reduce<br/>
&gt; attack speed if I need to.<br/>

&gt; &gt; So basically Chains is like bards in general?  An afterthought that&#39;s<br/>
nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; to have when the real spells fail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I get a strong idea that GZ&#39;s well ran dry on song ideas somewhere just<br/>
&gt; after L20. Chains could have been a great song if it was _only_ a<br/>
&gt; targetted mob combat speed reducer. That way it wouldn&#39;t conflict with<br/>
&gt; snare and cause these headaches. Then he could have added another snare<br/>
&gt; song as a seperate song, for those occasions when you don&#39;t have a druid<br/>
&gt; or ranger. But no, GZ seems real big on these multiple action songs that<br/>
&gt; get resisted more and also conflict more with other class&#39;s spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Same with the magic resist debuffs. A straight debuff would have been<br/>
&gt; fine, but he had to add the dot which uses the same resist, so the songs<br/>
&gt; become effectively useless. Having magic, fire, and cold debuff songs<br/>
&gt; that tested on poison like tashan wouldn&#39;t have been that unbalancing or<br/>
&gt; intruding on the classes that get debuffs, considering how little they<br/>
&gt; debuff and the level the bard gets them at, but instead we got 3 songs<br/>
&gt; that no one ever uses.<br/>
