<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294787295">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
Some quick tips that work for me:<br/>
<br/>
1. Always have selos going or be Sow&#39;d or have Jboots.  You want to keep<br/>
some distance from the charmed one that is fighting.<br/>
<br/>
2. Learn your techniques on easy things and places where you can escape if<br/>
thing go wrong and they will go wrong sometimes at the worst time.<br/>
<br/>
3. Make hot keys for /pet commands.  I have /pet attack and /pet who leader.<br/>
The first one for attack and the 2nd to let my group know that i have a<br/>
charmed mob. Also, /pet back off is good because sometimes your pet will<br/>
attack your group members.<br/>
<br/>
4. Use F1-F1 to switch target back to your pet.  More later.<br/>
<br/>
When you cast charm, it will agro the target. If it sticks, the target will<br/>
&quot;eyes glaze over&quot; and revert to /pet guard me mode.  While charmed in this<br/>
mode, it will auto attack anything that attacks you (unless it is too high<br/>
level and coward code takes over with the notable exception of skellies that<br/>
even though they are low level will attack anything.)<br/>
<br/>
Find 2 things about the same level.  Target one and charm.  When charm<br/>
sticks and until you gain some levels, you may need to cast it over and over<br/>
before you get a stick.  This is why you need selos/sow/jboots.  Cast and<br/>
run if it does not stick. Cast again until you get a stick.  Once eyes glaze<br/>
over, then target mob and /pet attack.  Now F1-F1 to retarget pet mob<br/>
because about now charm will end and you will need to re-cast.<br/>
<br/>
Charm, target, /pet attack, F1-F1, run away, when charm breaks - re-charm.<br/>
Sometimes you will need to re-target and re-issue /pet attack, othertimes it<br/>
will resume attack on its own.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and good hunting!<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Charm kiting<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I know you have probably discussed charm kiting numerous times on this<br/>
list,<br/>
&gt; but not since I&#39;ve been getting the list. I was wondering if someone would<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; good enough to tell me how to go about charm kiting and ny thing else I<br/>
might<br/>
&gt; need to know to make my nifty new charm song do all it should be able to<br/>
do. I<br/>
&gt; finially got lvl 27 night before last and don&#39;t have a clue where to<br/>
start.<br/>
&gt; Thank you in advance:) Oh and you can send it to me in email if you want:)<br/>
