<div id="ygrps-yiv-770568375"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You should consider Bellow nothing more than a warriors kick.  The higher<br/>
&gt; you get in level the less you&#39;ll start using it in actual combat (IMO).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; monks, the damage starts piling up fast).  I&#39;ll use Bellow in dungeon<br/>
&gt; settings, when it&#39;s not really safe to use CoD or DDD.  I also use it for<br/>
&gt; pulling, and helping out nearby people who are in a tough fight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have started using that combo of songs everyone was talking about instead<br/>
of bellow (the CoD, DDD, and Hymn with the Lute/horn switch out), and, with<br/>
the exception of the fact that you have to be VERY careful where you use it,<br/>
it does MUCH more damage than what I was using before (the bellow and some<br/>
sort of strength song and the occasional heal weaved in there) and I didn&#39;t<br/>
even have to melee.  Last night the group I was with was so good that I<br/>
didn&#39;t even have to use the Hymn much with CoD/DDD so to help my party, I<br/>
started weaving in the Anthem (instead of heal) with the CoD/DDD with the<br/>
lute/horn switch, and would heal between fights, while we waited for the<br/>
stuff to respawn IF my party members did not get too far down in health<br/>
during the fight - worked great!!<br/>
