<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560138057">i was talking to a guy at work, and this is what i predicted, 20 mana per<br/>
pulse instead of 5.  i just hope the level was not changed.  maybe time to<br/>
put those carnal pauldrons back on instead of crested.  the selo&#39;s nerf is a<br/>
joke though, we are supposed to be the fastest damn class =/<br/>

&gt;               Bewitching Bravura got its mana quadrupled in <br/>
&gt; cost and maybe <br/>
&gt; its max limit changed (hard to tell)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                    That was to be expected but Selo&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Accelandro and Selo&#39;s <br/>
&gt; Song of Travel both got capped at 66% haste now...which is <br/>
&gt; SLOWER than Spirit <br/>
&gt; of Scale. Actually its not that much or a nerf and more of an <br/>
&gt; insult heh. </span></blockquote></div>
