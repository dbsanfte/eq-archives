<div id="ygrps-yiv-303900453">Something I proposed a while ago was akin to this in that the main purpose<br/>
was to allow for easy equipment switching w/o a chance for dropping your<br/>
weapon/instrument etc due to lag/bad interface etc.<br/>
<br/>
Currently the hot keys work in the general notion that if I hit #1, it&#39;s the<br/>
equivilent of me clicking on that button, or spell icon.  This should just<br/>
be carried over to inventory slots.<br/>
<br/>
So if HotKey spot 1 has my primary weapon slot banked in it, and I press #1,<br/>
my staff of writhing should attach itself to the mouse pointer just as if i<br/>
single left clicked that spot.  If HotKey spot 2 has an inventory slot<br/>
banked it it (and that slot has my thulian claw in it), pressing #2 should<br/>
drop my staff in that inventory slot, and attach the claw to my cursor,<br/>
again just as if I had single left clicked that spot.  Pressing #1 again<br/>
would drop the claw into my primary weapon slot.<br/>
<br/>
Granted this might sound a bit confusing, but it follows with the general<br/>
feel of the interface that&#39;s already there, and for the most part shouldnt<br/>
require much extra code.<br/>

&gt;&gt; How bout just giving us an instrument slot.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Not one where you could USE a weapon and<br/>
&gt;&gt; instrument at the same time, just some so<br/>
&gt;&gt; that we didn&#39;t have to&gt; physically equip<br/>
&gt;&gt; and unequip constantly - just trade off in<br/>
&gt;&gt; some type of button arrangement - like archers<br/>
&gt;&gt; do between their bow and other weapons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I&#39;ve always wished for, and don&#39;t believe would take away from the &quot;We<br/>
&gt;want you to actually be doing something during a battle&quot; belief&#39;s that I<br/>
&gt;think Verant has is..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Configurable Item Setups<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me explain briefly.. Currently we have 6 hot-key banks that we can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>setup<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;with things that we want to be able to do with a single push of a button.<br/>
&gt;Why can&#39;t we add 6 more banks for three different &quot;weapon setups&quot; that we<br/>
&gt;use? Let&#39;s say I setup my hot-configurations like so:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;M1=Meelee1, M2=Meelee2,<br/>
&gt;R=RangedWeaponSlot,<br/>
&gt;I1=InvSlot1, I2=InvSlot2, I3=InvSlot3<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1 - M1=CombineLS, M2=DragoonDirk, R=Empty, I1=Lute, I2=Drum<br/>
&gt;2 - M1=CLS, M2=Shield, R=DD, I1=Lute, I2=Drum<br/>
&gt;3 - M1=Empty, M2=Drum, R=DD, I1=CLS, I2=Shield, I3=Lute<br/>
&gt;4 - M1=Empty, M2=Lute, R=DD, I1=CLS, I2=Shield, I3=Drum<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then we could take the buttons for the 6 banks,and make them hot-keys in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>one<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of our 6 hot-key banks. So I press 1 to load up my dual-wield, press 3 to<br/>
&gt;load up my drum config, and 4 to load up my lute config, etc.. A delay<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;be put in (say 1 attack round) so that it&#39;s not an instantaneous swap<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(which<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;would be nice, but unfair).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I for one don&#39;t see the realism of having to manually make these changes.<br/>
&gt;They&#39;re annoying at best having to click around so much, and at worst<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re dangerous because you lose weapons/instruments/etc if you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mis-click.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;It&#39;s also something that&#39;s not useful for only a Bard. This is something<br/>
&gt;that EVERY class in EQ could make use of. (Except perhaps the Monks since<br/>
&gt;they have no weapons to swap around)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you all think? I realize this likely isn&#39;t going to happen due to<br/>
&gt;the amount of coding that would be required, but it&#39;s definitely on my wish<br/>
&gt;list.<br/>
