<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243983819">It is true, the only faction loss that you receive from killing either the<br/>
bandits or the sister in Lesser Fay is a faction loss with the Dervishes<br/>
of Northern Ro.  So kill away.  Even the bandit camp in Greater Fay does<br/>
not yield any faction loss.  Though being a woodelf myself it is<br/>
disconcerting to receive Wood Elf bits as loot from a bandit.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Im a Wood Elf and my roommate plays a Highelf...can we kill the bandits<br/>
&gt; &gt;without lowering our faction with our hometowns?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The bandits he was referring to in Lesser Faydark are Half-elves, and during <br/>
&gt; beta GM&#39;s stated there was no faction loss (and that definitely seemed to be <br/>
&gt; the case) for High Elves. I don&#39;t know if any of that&#39;s changed since <br/>
&gt; commercial started, but I doubt it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also heard that there is a faction loss in regards to dervishes (Desert of <br/>
&gt; Ro) when you hunt the lesser fay bandits, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true.<br/>
