&gt;Hmmm I remember seeing a screen shoot of Cazic Thule and he was holding a <br/>
&gt;flute like instrument.  Maybe this is it, but a Horn of War would seem more <br/>
&gt;appropriate to Rallos Zek then Cazic Thule.<br/>

friend of mine claimed a friend of his did it as a joke... everybody<br/>
understood it to be a joke anyways. =)<br/>
I did see Cazic holding duel maces once... we all joked it was two rusty<br/>
maces but you should have seen the clerics drool. Zone crashed right before<br/>
we killed him for the second time... first time he dropped a total of 8<br/>
platinum. Which is why the two rusty maces was expected :)<br/>
<br/>
All this was prenerf btw, we cant even kill one mob now in the fear plane.<br/>
Has any server even managed to kill one mob in the fear plane since it was<br/>
nerfed?<br/>
