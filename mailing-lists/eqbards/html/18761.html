<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281244613"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m still trying to figure out where they got the idea that we would have a<br/>
&gt;use for Enduring Breath (we have the spell and are guaranteed never to be<br/>
&gt;out of the radius) and Summon drink (we are one of only 3 classes to get<br/>
&gt;forage).  It&#39;s bizarre.  Seems to me like another case of:<br/>
&gt;Question: 	&quot;We have no idea what effect to put on Bard armor&quot;<br/>
&gt;Answer: 	&quot;Hmmm, me neither, hey that fishbone earring is popular,<br/>
&gt;give them Enduring Breath, and Summon Water goes well with that theme&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um. My friend, Windsong, was delighted to pick up the Enduring<br/>
BReath piece. It meant she could get rid of her Fishbone earring (that<br/>
she paid dearly to trade for.) Sure, you have a song. 1) It means you<br/>
can play nothing else 2) it skips beats in lag conditions 3) if you<br/>
go LD you&#39;re dead. She&#39;d MUCH rather the safety of the Fishbone<br/>
Earring when she&#39;s playing in Kedge and other underwater dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
And, similarly, she likes Summon Drink. She never remembered to hit<br/>
the Forage button, preferring instead (ever since she was 30, that I<br/>
can recall) to buy stackable food and drink while in town. and you don&#39;t<br/>
forage nearly as much water as food anyway. Now, she treats her bard like<br/>
her cleric, and doesn&#39;t need to buy water at all. She logs in, summons 5 or<br/>
10 drink. When she gets low, she goes to her inventory and clicks on her<br/>
boots again. What&#39;s more, I haven&#39;t heard her complaining about the AC<br/>
either.<br/>
She traded for the boots, she wanted them so much -- and they had better AC<br/>
than what she was wearing before.<br/>
<br/>
Would she complain if they upped the AC? Of course not. But she&#39;s not<br/>
up in arms either about the AC they have now.<br/>
<br/>
You have to realize: A ranger is more of a tank than a Bard is. It was,<br/>
I believe, intended to be that way. RAngers get taunt. Bards do not. (well,<br/>
our songs)<br/>
