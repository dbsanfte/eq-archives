&quot;Pulling a few frogs in Upper Guk...&quot; (Hehe, sounds like &quot;military<br/>
intelligence&quot; or &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Heh, reminds me of a really powerfull song you do have: Lament.  I have been<br/>
playing with this in recent weeks too. But this should be a great one to use<br/>
in the situation you describe.  It is supposed to reduce the agro radius and<br/>
help you control your pulls. It&#39;s enhanced by string (accroding to song<br/>
analysis sheets although I dont have a practical proof of this) so you might<br/>
want to equip your lute (mandolin) and try to lament all the frogs that are<br/>
close together (target one, play song; target next one, play song; rinse,<br/>
repeat) and then pull only one or two at a time.<br/>
<br/>
FYI:  Since level 45, I have spent _a_lot_ of time in the PoF Spectre cave.<br/>
Some things to note:  cant get reliable single pulls until level 47 if you<br/>
are the only one pulling.  Fear/Chain is great!  Watch out for Roror!  If I<br/>
lament specs to reduce their agro radius for the purpose of pulling singles,<br/>
I have noticed that their con will sometimes change from &quot;scowls, ready to<br/>
attack...&quot; to &quot;regards you indifferently.&quot;  And this is on blue cons too!<br/>
<br/>
And they really are indifferent.  I can get right up to them and they remain<br/>
non-agro.  Next time I do this, I will try to remember to &quot;hail a spectre&quot;<br/>
and see if they have quest information &lt;hehe&gt;.  Now that makes me wonder<br/>
about my old fiend Kizdean Gixx.  I know he does have quest info.  I wonder<br/>
if I could Lament him to indifferent then Charillion him higher?<br/>

&gt; Thanks Sylly!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night, we tried to pull &quot;a few&quot; of the frogs from below the Scryer<br/>
room<br/>
&gt; in Upper Guk, and ended up with about 8 - 10.  We decided to stay and<br/>
fight<br/>
&gt; to see how far we could get and towards the end when we were all down to<br/>
two<br/>
&gt; bubs of health, I switched to healing with the lute and Anthem... I was<br/>
&gt; TOTALLY impressed.  Not only did i keep everyone alive but we finished<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; about half health!  It was great!  I love my bard!!!!!<br/>
