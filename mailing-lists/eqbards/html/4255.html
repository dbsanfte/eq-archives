<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015303898">Actually he did have a pet but it conned green to me (19 bard) so we focused<br/>
on finishing off the necro first.  Its quite possible he does drop unique<br/>
loot a percentage of the time and we just happened to be unlucky.<br/>

	I met him when the patch for mail was out.  I was there trying to do<br/>
the mail thing then I saw him.  U are lucky you did not have to fight his<br/>
pet too.</div>
