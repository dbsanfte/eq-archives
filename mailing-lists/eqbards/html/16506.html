<div id="ygrps-yiv-6740931">&quot;Hate to be the realist here, but it really doesn&#39;t matter in the long run<br/>
what you prefer.  You will never find a high level group with a Ranger or<br/>
Druid using chains to keep runners from taking off.  High level players know<br/>
the limitations of the songs and few seconds or less that chains sticks vs<br/>
the 2 to 3 minutes that snare sticks is practically impossible to argue<br/>
with.  If you are in a high level group, there is no question as to whether<br/>
or not root goes away from the spell list or earth pets are replaced by fire<br/>
or water when there are snarers present.  These things aren&#39;t talked of,<br/>
just assumed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Never say never.  If there is no shammie/enchanter around to do attack speed<br/>
debuff, or the enchanter is busy mezzing, I always Chain.  The attack speed<br/>
debuff is just too beneficial, and I don&#39;t have slots for both binding and<br/>
chains (I can count on two hands the number of times I&#39;ve dememmed chains in<br/>
a dungeon).  Yes, most high level mages are smart enough to put away their<br/>
earth pet in dungeon groups, but one in particular (level 49) refused; that<br/>
was /after/ talking.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Chains effect rarely lasts 3 ticks.  If you get a single resist, especially<br/>
at higher levels, expect the MOB to start moving.  When it comes time for<br/>
the MOB to start running, you better not be trying to weave chains with<br/>
another song either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While Chains does break early, it&#39;s more the exception than the norm.  On<br/>
mobs with a decent magic resistance, they seem to break early, but those are<br/>
also generally the same cases that I yell &quot;can&#39;t chain&quot; and let the druid do<br/>
their work.  Also, I don&#39;t have much problem twisting in another song on<br/>
medium blues (usually an attack speed buff, to finish off quicker), and only<br/>
feel that I HAVE to chain-Chain on high blues or higher.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In most high level dungeons your margin of error for a<br/>
runner is minimal.  A fire imp running on an efreeti raid doesn&#39;t need to go<br/>
far to bring h3ll down on your raiding party and even in deep paw, a gnoll<br/>
escapes out of a room into the hallway and you are toast.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, with overcrowding being what it is, this isn&#39;t true anymore.<br/>
Heh, we&#39;ve even let a runner go a couple times in Guk, HOPING he&#39;d bring<br/>
back a train.  In the efreeti party example, I&#39;ve not been on one that<br/>
didn&#39;t have both a snarer (usually a druid) and an attack speed debuffer<br/>
(either an enchanter or a shaman).  If both are present, and able to do the<br/>
slowdown and snare, then I cede to them.  If either, in a normal hunting<br/>
group, is missing or unable to perform due to other responsibilities, I&#39;m<br/>
chaining.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If your chains is in effect and snare is cast, it won&#39;t stick.  It takes a<br/>
druid or ranger long enough to recycle to be able to cast again that the<br/>
lost time could mean death as well.  Worse even, I&#39;ve seen bards (including<br/>
myself) press the wrong key and chain a MOB that is already snared... The<br/>
effect is to break snare and in a few seconds your MOB is suddenly on the<br/>
loose.  Have one of these things happen once and I guarantee a good group<br/>
with make you stop using chains or will disband from you.  You should go<br/>
talk to high level rangers or druids and ask them what they hate most about<br/>
bards... you&#39;ll find they all hate the bards that insist on chaining or are<br/>
convinced chains is better then snare.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m spoiled in that I&#39;ve grouped with a druid since level 1.  It<br/>
didn&#39;t take us long to work out when I was chaining versus when he was<br/>
snaring.  Our basic rule is, if more than one mob and I am doing crowd<br/>
control, he snares... otherwise, I chain, unless I yell for him to snare.<br/>
It&#39;s just a matter of communication, which is essential for any decent group<br/>
in any case.  At level 50, I can honestly tell you I have never been told to<br/>
stop using chains, and have never been disbanded for doing so.  I prefer<br/>
Chain/Fear in a dungeon setting simply because if I&#39;m fearing in a group, it<br/>
generally means we&#39;re somewhat beat up, and I&#39;m trying to mitigate damage<br/>
intake to get through the battle.  Chain will halt movement FAR sooner than<br/>
snare will.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At around level 25 is when the good bards start getting set apart from the<br/>
bad bards and one of the traits of a bad bard is to tell other classes how<br/>
to do their job or try to fulfill roles that are clearly already filled by<br/>
another class in a party.  How many bards would pixie a MOB that an<br/>
enchanter mezzed?  I keep pixie up, but not as a replacement for mez, but<br/>
instead as a supplement for when it fails.  Same is true of chains.  Later<br/>
in life you will find it is a supplement in case the snare fails.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again, if you have both a snarer and an attack speed debuffer, Chains<br/>
generally is not needed.  If you&#39;re lacking either, I always opt for Chains.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Chains for pulling?  Depends on the situation.  There are a lot of places<br/>
where it works find but there are even more places where you will end up<br/>
pulling yourself a train.  In most dungeons, the pathing is so screwed up<br/>
that if you don&#39;t baby-step the MOB, it will end up running through doors<br/>
and rooms that you don&#39;t want any part of.  From my days in Sol A, we<br/>
learned quickly that you don&#39;t want to be SoW&#39;ed when pulling and you WANT<br/>
that mob stuck on your back... If it ain&#39;t there trying to stick a dagger in<br/>
you, chances are it has chosen some funky back-ass route that will end up<br/>
bring half the world down on your party.  Hope you have an evac&#39;er then or<br/>
get ready for CR.  The same is true of chains in these situations since you<br/>
NEED that mob glued to your back.  Puller&#39;s nightmare are casters.  The damn<br/>
mobs stop to cast on you and if you keep going chances are you aren&#39;t going<br/>
to like the path they chose to get to you when they go to catch up.  In<br/>
order to pull a caster correctly, you need to stop at every corner and wait<br/>
for the caster to catch up to you and expect to take a hit every time they<br/>
get you in line of sight.   You want an example?  Try pulling the Bar with<br/>
chains, or the little room next to the King&#39;s room in Sol A.   Heck, try<br/>
pulling the executioner&#39;s area in Paw with chains!  You are better off<br/>
running up and smacking the mob or using a throwing dagger then you are<br/>
using chains.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To clarify:<br/>
<br/>
Chains is not the ONLY song I use in pulling.  It gives a great head-start<br/>
for Invis pulling in places like live side Guk.  It also means melee mobs<br/>
won&#39;t be hitting you all the way back (you can baby step them without having<br/>
to let them wack on you).  I prefered Charm (if low enough) or Pixie when<br/>
pulling casters.  A mob generally won&#39;t start casting on you unless they can<br/>
see you (they will, however, finish a spell they started before you ducked<br/>
around the corner).<br/>
<br/>
And, I have pulled to the King room with Chains, from all the areas around<br/>
it (as far as the high shammie room), and had no problem.  It&#39;s a matter of<br/>
learning the mob&#39;s pathing, which is important for any puller.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My brother&#39;s character is a druid and I can&#39;t even begin to describe how<br/>
much better snare/fear works then chains/fear on the big stuff.  Especially<br/>
against larger MOBs where fear gets resisted.  A lot of the time fear lasts<br/>
a single pulse.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Outdoors, I agree.  I love Snare/Fear, because it relieves my load, and<br/>
there is no danger of training.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You want a group friendly slowdown?  Use binding.  And no, it doesn&#39;t wake<br/>
up mezzed mobs.  Don&#39;t use either if you have a shaman with togors who can<br/>
get it to stick.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Problem is, I only have 8 slots.  I always keep Chains memmed for<br/>
emergencies.  I do mem Binding, but it&#39;s situational.  I can usually find a<br/>
better purpose for that song slot.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my bard and I love my songs, but I also know<br/>
when<br/>
to use them and when not too.  I do everything I can to learn about the<br/>
other classes and their strengths and weaknesses so that I can make sure my<br/>
song line up augments a party instead of being a detriment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I believe everyone on this list does the same.  My personal weakness is<br/>
with working with the necro lines, as there are only a few necros who<br/>
actually seem to consistently group.<br/>
