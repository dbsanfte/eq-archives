<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Breaking from conventional tactics <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-283775583">I LOVE enchanters but I&#39;ve found that an enchanter in the group tends to<br/>
make the puller lazy and sloppy.  No enchanter = careful skilled puller or<br/>
evac.  Enchanter in group = lazy overconfident stupid puller that eventually<br/>
forces the group to evac anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
These days when I do group with an enchanter, either I pull with Lament or a<br/>
monk pulls.  If the puller goes all day without using Mez for multiple mobs<br/>
once, then that&#39;s fine.  Enchanters in a group should be doing a few things<br/>
only: Nuking, giving clarity, occasional buffing, and changing into a<br/>
different into different forms occasionally to add some spice to the<br/>
monotony.  When combined with mana song, it makes a group twice as powerful.<br/>
Nothing better then a nuking enchanter in my opinion.  Means the rest of the<br/>
group is actually doing their jobs :-).<br/>
<br/>
Now, breaking a spawn using an enchanter and mez is an ENTIRELY different<br/>
thing, BUT once the spawn is broken, then enchanter should never have to mez<br/>
again.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Conventional tactics in EQ when you pull multiple mobs is for<br/>
&gt; everyone to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; /assist the main tank and take out the mobs one by one.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; E N C H A N T E R<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t leave home without one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t always have an enchanter in the group, so the topic<br/>
&gt; still warrants discussion.  Some of the things you find are<br/>
&gt; not so obvious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example, in a 2-mob pull, I&#39;ll usually Pixie Strike the<br/>
&gt; weaker (less chance of resists, less damage I take when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; resisted) while the group kills the stronger.  We found out<br/>
&gt; the hard way that a paladin + ranger + cleric take a really<br/>
&gt; really long time and use up almost all their mana to kill a<br/>
&gt; bok knight.  Meanwhile, I sat there PSing a dar knight for<br/>
&gt; probably 5-8 minutes, occasionally tossing in a buff here or<br/>
&gt; there trying to make myself somewhat useful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The next time this happened, I just PSed the bok continuously<br/>
&gt; (no other buffs) while the group killed the dar.  Not only did<br/>
&gt; they manage to kill the dar, they killed another dar, wan, and<br/>
&gt; urd who wandered into the fight.  The bok only woke up twice,<br/>
&gt; and I was able to get it back under control requiring only a<br/>
&gt; single heal.  Then all of us killed the bok.  If we&#39;d done it<br/>
&gt; the other way, I would&#39;ve ended up having to control 2 dars, a<br/>
&gt; wan, and an urd while my group fought the bok.  (Controlling 4<br/>
&gt; mobs is not impossible, but really difficult - charm one, PS 2<br/>
&gt; others.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, mez is not the ultimate crowd control solution.  If your<br/>
&gt; enchanter has multiple mobs mezed and your group is taking a<br/>
&gt; long time to hack down each one, there&#39;s a danger the<br/>
&gt; enchanter could go OOM keeping up the mezes.  In that case,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s better to charm a couple mobs (both you and enchanter<br/>
&gt; can, but probably safer if only you do it so the enchanter can<br/>
&gt; keep up the mezing).  That&#39;ll help the group kill the current<br/>
&gt; target much more quickly.  When I try to do this, nothing<br/>
&gt; annoys me more than an enchanter who insists on mezing the mob<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m charming.  (I did this to Rokenn&#39;s pet once so I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; completely innocent either.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another mistake I see groups make is to not take their time<br/>
&gt; when they have the luxury of crowd control.  Too many people<br/>
&gt; feel that immediately after killing a mob, they have to start<br/>
&gt; hacking away at the next mesmerized mob.  In one unfortunate<br/>
&gt; case, the cleric went OOM healing us from the current mob, the<br/>
&gt; tanks killed it, and instead of waiting to give the cleric<br/>
&gt; some time to rest up, immediately jumped on the next mob.<br/>
&gt; They also (incorrectly) followed the &quot;kill the caster first&quot;<br/>
&gt; rule when a relatively weak melee mob was also standing by<br/>
&gt; mezed.  As a result, the caster nuked two of the melee folks<br/>
&gt; to death before we bailed out of the situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I explained it to them afterwards - in between mezed mob kills<br/>
&gt; is basically free time, equivalent to you being able to cast<br/>
&gt; heals and buffs with zero combat delay, debuff the mob with no<br/>
&gt; threat of retalization, and being able to med and (with a<br/>
&gt; bard) heal up.  Next time this happened they listened when I<br/>
&gt; said &quot;kill the (green) melee mob next.&quot;  As a result, the<br/>
&gt; cleric had about 45 seconds to med in peace, while I played<br/>
&gt; Clarity and Hymn to give each of the tanks back about a half<br/>
&gt; bubble despite the damage they were taking from the greenie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So there are lots of situations where turning conventional<br/>
&gt; tactics on their head result in better outcomes.<br/>
