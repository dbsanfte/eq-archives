<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-250721360">Here&#39;s my experience with the Carillon.<br/>
Immediately after I purchased it, I targeted the bard shopkeeper, sung<br/>
the song, and then I checked her prices. I noticed a decrease in prices,<br/>
by about 1g or so for some of the higher lvl songs she sells.<br/>
That was it, I&#39;ve never been able to get it to work again.<br/>
The guildmaster won&#39;t talk to me about the quest (since I&#39;m human i<br/>
suppose) so I tried using Carillon on her 10 times or so, and she still<br/>
refused to talk to me.<br/>
So with my experience, the song DID in fact work. But once, and only<br/>
once.<br/>
<br/>
As for Libretto, aye, its quite worthless indeed. We need to bug the GMs<br/>
about these two songs. Please fill out some /feedback forms or email<br/>
them or whatever. Petition if you want to. Otherwise these<br/>
bugged/worthless songs will remain just as that: bugged/worthless.<br/>
