<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396988725">Learned something new last night about Psalm of Mystic Shielding.  In<br/>
addition to the magic resistance buff, it also provides HP regen.  At 50th<br/>
level, it added 5 HP per tick.  Not certain if it scales with level or not.<br/>
The HP regen component of the song is not listed on the EQSongs website.<br/>
Not certain if it is listed on Reed&#39;s Spreadsheet.  Tried to check there but<br/>
the link to Reed&#39;s spreadhseet isn&#39;t working.<br/>
<br/>
BTW has this always been known?  Don&#39;t recall ever seeing it mentioned here<br/>
on the list.<br/>
