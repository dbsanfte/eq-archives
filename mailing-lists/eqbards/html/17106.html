&gt; Ya, but can the enchanter as easily heal one person as six? :) or Dot one<br/>
&gt; mob as 10?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>An enchanter&#39;s &quot;heals&quot; are in preventing the group from taking<br/>
damage via stuns and (the expensive) runes.  So yes, they can<br/>
as easily &quot;heal&quot; one person as six.  Arguably better since<br/>
they can do it while taking little to no damage themselves.  <br/>
If you&#39;re grouped with a good enchanter, you could be forced<br/>
to rely on a ranger for heals and that should be enough.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got me on the DoT thing.  But like I said, you need a<br/>
rather specialized group makeup and mob selection to get it to<br/>
work right.<br/>
