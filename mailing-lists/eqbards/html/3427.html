<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484865266"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Ok, now you have me hooked.  I HATE Kithicor!  It is the most scary place I<br/>
&gt;have been - so far.  But I keep going back!  I have had Ged make me his<br/>
&gt;Bearskin gloves and am looking for a HQ LION to get the finest ones in all<br/>
&gt;of Norrath.  Jed&#39;s druid friend - she won&#39;t talk to me not even with my cha<br/>
&gt;song.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about that music that sometimes comes on throughout the zone, must be a<br/>
random trigger though cause I never get it in the same place twice...  I<br/>
actually find unrest scarier though, in a frenetic, bodies everywhere sort<br/>
of way.  Ok, I lied, Kithicor is way scarier, but only when you let yourself<br/>
think about it...<br/>

&gt;things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m trying, but haven&#39;t a lot of info on happenings West of Highpass.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For example, talking to Furball Miller on the Miller farm. His sad story of<br/>
&gt;woe.  Then, there is the letter from the DE that the halfling in the<br/>
&gt;Hogcallers Inn has (part of the Lady Shae quest.) I got the letter and read<br/>
&gt;it.  It implies that you can get a special thing if you deliver it to the<br/>
&gt;correct person. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have to check this out.  Interesting, have not been into Hogcaller&#39;s in a<br/>
long while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wonder if there is some underlying tale about Norrath or are these just<br/>
&gt;independent little quest things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Knowing how Brad thinks in some ways, it would make a lot of sense.<br/>
Kithicor is the physical &#39;glue&#39; that hold the two sides of Norrath together,<br/>
not HighPass as some might think.  Perhaps Kithicor is also the metaphysical<br/>
&#39;glue&#39; that holds different parts of Norrath&#39;s story together.  HighPass is<br/>
the &#39;obvious&#39; center, the one everyone sees.  But you can go around<br/>
Highpass, how can it be more than a false center, a side passage in the tale<br/>
of Norrath.  No the real center, the shadow-center is Kithicor.  Its not<br/>
Commonlands, nor Karanas.  You can&#39;t avoid it, but must pass thru whether to<br/>
go b Rivervale or HighPass you must take Kithicor.  Most run thru it<br/>
quickly, without looking back.<br/>
	You want to keep something secret, you have two choices, put it<br/>
where few will want to go, or hide it in plain sight.  Kithicor accomplishes<br/>
both as everyone eventually runs through there, but how many people actually<br/>
see Kithicor?  This is definitely the most mysterious zone I have found and<br/>
definitely is not useless.  There may be a lot of unimplemented things in<br/>
Kithicor, or those things might just be hidden.  I just wish that npc&#39;s<br/>
waiting for secret passwords could be distinguished from npc&#39;s that just<br/>
don&#39;t talk.  Nothing more frustrating than bantering at ever-silent Kithicor<br/>
for an hour trying to ask the right question.  Maybe when we need his answer<br/>
we will know to go to him, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
	If you want useless, how about Kerra Isle?  What&#39;s the purpose in<br/>
that place?  I have tried to talk to every catman there to no avail and<br/>
could find nothing there but catmen and the heretics isle.  Since I abhor<br/>
necros I wanted nothing to do with heretic necros whatsoever!  Its the only<br/>
time I have ever been totally alone in a zone while 1600 people were on the<br/>
server.<br/>
