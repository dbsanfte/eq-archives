<div id="ygrps-yiv-301738970">To get to misty thicket you go out the west gate of Freeport and hug the<br/>
right hand wall. You will zone into East Commons. Continue to hug the right<br/>
hand wall. You will need to avoid a couple of camps. Just circle around and<br/>
continue. Watch for Griffins, etc. and avoid them too. You will eventually<br/>
zone into West Commons. Continue hugging the right hand wall avoiding camps<br/>
again and you will come to the zone entrance for Kithicor forest. Enter<br/>
Kithicor and follow the wall to the right. Eventually the wall will change<br/>
from grass to stone and you will see a hole in the wall. This is the<br/>
entrance to Rivervale. Enter Rivervale and get yourself bound (this will<br/>
make it so when you die you return there instead of Freeport saving you a<br/>
long walk). Once bound you need to find the exit to Misty Thicket (it&#39;s<br/>
near the Priest of Discord, the guy with the big staff with a skull on the<br/>
end). Once outside just follow the path and you will come to a wall. The<br/>
town side of the wall is for 1st thru 5th, the other side of the wall is<br/>
for 6th thru 10th or 12th. Be careful and have fun.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 3) there is another exit from Freeport that goes to North Ro.<br/>
&gt; You can kill some stuff in the grassy area to get 6th and then<br/>
&gt; head into the desert to kill Orc Raiders. Watch out though,<br/>
&gt; even at 6th most things in either of these zones will kill you.<br/>
&gt; Another idea is to go to Misty Thicket, the halfling newbie zone,<br/>
&gt; which is arguably the best newbie zone in the game (Everfrost<br/>
&gt; beats it from 1st to 5th, but Misty will take you to around 10th<br/>
&gt; to 12th). </span></blockquote></div>
