place of a random placeholder.  Oncylus Ogrefiend for example,<br/>
the named cyclops, is like level 42 while normal cyclopses are<br/>
in the high 20s.  And you have the minotaur hero who shows up<br/>
in place of the L7ish mino slavers.  Because of the random<br/>
location of the outdoor mobs, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re designed<br/>
to be killed by people who are hunting the normal mobs there.  <br/>
Rather, they&#39;re designed to keep the people hunting the normal<br/>
mobs from getting too complacent.<br/>
<br/>
Indoors where the named mobs show up in set spots, they are<br/>
tougher, but definitely killable by a group able to hold the<br/>
room.<br/>
