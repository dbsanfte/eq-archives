<div id="ygrps-yiv-893923494"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It can&#39;t hurt.  Let us know! =)  Also if you ever manage to find Arlena and<br/>
&gt; give Grimlot her bones instead of the lute of the gypsy princess, would be<br/>
&gt; interesting to know what that quest gives.  Another reason I doubt Grimlot<br/>
&gt; has anything to do with the Wakizishi or the Lute is because he mentions<br/>
&gt; Arlena, and she is not who carries the lute.  just thought of that.  anyway,<br/>
&gt; good luck.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, Arlena is the main reason I thought it was bad. And the fact that<br/>
there&#39;s already another quest, verified to work, which is much harder than<br/>
the lute-&gt;grimrot quest, that gives a wakizashi.<br/>
<br/>
And to rephrase more clearly what I said in the previous message.. if<br/>
you&#39;re going to disprove something, might as well do it right. =)<br/>
