<div id="ygrps-yiv-53732833">I&#39;m in the same quandary.  I&#39;ve had my map for about 8 levels and <br/>
     still don&#39;t know who to give it to.  Alkazar&#39;s say there is a women <br/>
     near the arena in S. Q who has lost her apprentice but I can&#39;t find <br/>
     her either.<br/>

I know this is off topic and not related (as far as I know) to Bards <br/>
specifically, but there are some very knowledgeable people on this list and <br/>
I haven&#39;t found the answer elsewhere..<br/>
     <br/>
I have looted a blurred map. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s for some quest, I&#39;ve even heard <br/>
rumors that it has something to do with someone in Qeynos that&#39;s building a <br/>
&quot;titanic bridge&quot; from Qeynos to Erudin. I&#39;ve also heard rumors that the <br/>
quest actually isn&#39;t working right now. <br/>
     <br/>
Could anyone give a spoiler as to what to do with this map? (It&#39;s a Lore <br/>
Item) Even a pointer of where to go or something would be appreciated..<br/>
     <br/>
Happy journeys and in tune songs..<br/>
