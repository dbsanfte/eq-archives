<div id="ygrps-yiv-775220558">Heh, I *thought* I recognized the name.  I was one of the early traders<br/>
Illanda Syll - hung about on and off for around 2 years, also had a Bard in<br/>
DR and I don&#39;t remember her name but think I met Talies as that char.<br/>
<br/>
My Bards (except the low one on Test) are deleted - was sort of waiting on<br/>
the recent tests to decide what to do - I have an Enchanter that plays well<br/>
and often gets invited for pick-up groups and is in a guild that does hunt<br/>
together a bit. So .. why is it I still have the urge to play a Bard .. and<br/>
why am I considering throwing in the towel on EQ after seeing Verant&#39;s<br/>
response to testing these songs?<br/>
<br/>
Its the tedium.  My Bards have been by far the least tedious to play in EQ -<br/>
and some of the nicer to do light RPing with.  After a Bard I&#39;m spoiled when<br/>
it comes to long med breaks or long sit-on-the-tush breaks.   They can solo<br/>
with less tedium than most other classes which also group well.  So I&#39;m not<br/>
bored to tears while I go zone to zone looking for groups, I can kill a few<br/>
mobs .. shout/ooc for group while I rest .. repeat ... and its not too bad<br/>
to run quickly to a far off zone should some friends pop up there with a<br/>
group.   But .... is playing a Bard worth the ineffective (broken) songs and<br/>
the massive death rate 20s on?  for me not really.  I have played other<br/>
classes to respectable levels (up into the really must group range for all<br/>
but the other hybrids) and just don&#39;t like them as well as Bards - and its<br/>
tedium.  I have finished two 5 and 6 novels series reading in the down-times<br/>
while waiting for a group - or while in one.  OK I so *do* read fast - and I<br/>
also play odd hours so have to rely on pick-up groups 75% of the time.   If<br/>
Bard isn&#39;t &quot;playable&quot; within my frustration limit window (past about level<br/>
20)  and the other classes which are quite playable (Enchanter, Necro,<br/>
Warrior, Shaman, Wiz) and also more welcome in groups (Enchanter, Warrior,<br/>
Wiz even) also exceed my playablity tolerance for tedium (esp after the<br/>
playing a Bard).  Aaaaaaa!  Yes, I as well only log on to see friends now.<br/>
<br/>
I had considered it more likely that Bards would be repaired before the game<br/>
was made less tedious.  Tho now it looks like neither.    Perhaps its time.<br/>
<br/>
- the dead Menuette, the living Hechicera .. and thier typist who&#39;s getting<br/>
bored.<br/>

&gt; At 02:38 PM 9/8/00 -0600, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Grief PKing was &quot;solved&quot; by creating a complete duplicate of the UO<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think for me the most interesting part of the Horizons solution was the<br/>
&gt; &gt;idea that some PK&#39;er could log in one day, walk out of his house and get<br/>
&gt; &gt;PK&#39;d by a random server generated assassin that would always know where<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; &gt;was.  Talk about just desserts.  Just the idea of having a Venril Sathir<br/>
&gt; &gt;like mob jumping grief-causers when they were totally unprepared was<br/>
&gt; &gt;amusing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         Kit<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ahh - but there can be problems with this as well.<br/>
&gt; Let me share with you a story of the original Talies - Talies Wanderbur, a<br/>
&gt; Halfling Bard in Dragonrealms...<br/>
&gt; One night, as they were preparing to open Jadewater Mansion for the first<br/>
&gt; time, I was waiting around, decked out in my finest (actually, my Trader<br/>
&gt; Patron&#39;s finest - I was just an outlet store for her unique wares).  As I<br/>
&gt; scanned the ever-increasing crowd, one face jumped out at me - Muumuu -<br/>
&gt; well known corpse-robber, and despised by the Bardic community as a<br/>
&gt; whole.  Most recently he had stolen a poor young Bardess&#39;s recently<br/>
bonded*<br/>
&gt; lute, and refused to return it, or any of the other items he had<br/>
&gt; stolen.  Generally, he just logged when confronted.  Hoping to finally<br/>
&gt; recover the missing instrument, but knowing that as young a bard as I was,<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t confront him myself, I ran quickly to the Bard&#39;s Guild and<br/>
&gt; passed through the mystic portal, into the inner sanctum.  &quot;Muumuu&#39;s<br/>
here -<br/>
&gt; I just saw him heading for the bridge!&quot;<br/>
&gt; Nothing like a call to arms to rouse every Bard and their friends.  We<br/>
&gt; rapidly assembled a posse of 5 including a War Mage with a familiar we<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; using to track Muumuu&#39;s movements.  Having spotted him in the bad part of<br/>
&gt; town, we began to make our way there, only to see the Mage suddenly<br/>
stiffen<br/>
&gt; and slump to the ground.  One of the Bards who knew him well called it<br/>
&gt; &quot;Familiar shock&quot; - someone had slain his familiar (a serious offense!<br/>
Like<br/>
&gt; killing someone&#39;s puppy!)  Incensed, we rushed to the scene, just in time<br/>
&gt; to witness Muumuu fleeing in the opposite direction.  We gave chase,<br/>
&gt; finally cornering him in an alley, where, with weapons drawn, we<br/>
confronted<br/>
&gt; him about the missing items.  Being as low as I was, I knew all I could do<br/>
&gt; was aim and keep Muumuu under close watch in case he should try to<br/>
&gt; flee.  Suddenly a burly warrior stepped in and accused us of harassing the<br/>
&gt; &quot;young trader&quot; Muumuu.  Despite our statements, and Muumuu&#39;s own snide<br/>
&gt; remarks, the warrior refused to stand aside, and suddenly advanced on one<br/>
&gt; of our own, slaying him in one blow!  This was a great shock to us all, as<br/>
&gt; one learns that you NEVER kill someone in town, or the guards throw you in<br/>
&gt; jail.  Seeing nothing happen to this Warrior, however, and catching Muumuu<br/>
&gt; backing away from the corner of my eye, I loosed, piercing him through the<br/>
&gt; throat, killing him on the spot.  An act, I admit now, that was poorly<br/>
&gt; thought out, and I do regret - did regret the instant I did it, for no<br/>
&gt; sooner had the arrow left my bowstring, than I was clapped in irons and<br/>
&gt; dragged off to a cell, while the remainder of my comrades fought the<br/>
&gt; warrior valiantly.  The warrior, incidentally, was never captured, while I<br/>
&gt; lost all of mine (and my Patrons) hard earned items (courtesy of another<br/>
&gt; bug we won&#39;t go into ;).<br/>
&gt; So you see the problem with NPC-meted justice is that it isn&#39;t always<br/>
fair,<br/>
&gt; because NPCs can&#39;t see the real circumstances behind anything - and since<br/>
&gt; they are programmed by people who make mistakes, they will make those<br/>
&gt; mistakes over and over again...<br/>
