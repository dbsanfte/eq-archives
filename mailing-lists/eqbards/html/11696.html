<div id="ygrps-yiv-514828434">I read a long time ago on this list (think John Kim posted it) that lizzies,<br/>
giant skeles, etc are indeed placeholders for giants in Rathe Mtns.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar note, I think the same holds true for the bears and lizards<br/>
that spawn near the Lake zone. I was there last night with a cyclops hunting<br/>
group.  After we killed all the cycylops that were there, there was a long<br/>
time before another cyclops ever appeared.  Whole bunch of bears were<br/>
walking around though.  I remembered the placeholder post from a while back<br/>
so we killed several grizzlies and kodiaks.  Within a couple of minutes, a<br/>
couple of cyclops spawned.  Everytime a bear spawned afterwards we killed<br/>
it.  As a result, It was nonstop cyclops slaughter all night long.  Only<br/>
down time was when the casters had to med.  One other cool thing about<br/>
hunting cyclops near the lake zone.  If you have a good party (we had five<br/>
people, all high 20s/low 30s and well-balanced classwise), you can kill<br/>
Tarskuk nonstop.  Tarskuk is a NPC cyclops that I think is somewhere in the<br/>
30s.  As soon as you kill him, he immediately respawns.  Once again, the<br/>
only downtime you will incur is for casters to med.<br/>
<br/>
Once I make 30th level, I plan on making this spot my home until I get out<br/>
of hell level.  I heard that Highkeep basement was the best place to safely<br/>
get out of 30th hell level because of its safety factor but I think camping<br/>
cyclops by the Lake zone in Rathe may actually be better (assuming you<br/>
canget in a group).  You have the zone for the safety factor plus the<br/>
cyclops spawn rate is much faster than pickclaws.  <br/>

&gt; Hmm.. I couldn&#39;t see any evidence that lizzies are placeholders for<br/>
&gt; giants.  Killing many didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; increase the spawn of giants.  The giant skels definitely are, however.<br/>
&gt; Seriously though, with me and<br/>
&gt; that 45th level wizard working the hill (and I&#39;m pretty sure we were the<br/>
&gt; only ones there) there were no<br/>
&gt; hill giants or skeletons on that hil.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d say a level 45 wizard can do a good job of keeping<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; HGs cleared or not.  Pull enough lizards and GS to the guard tower (make<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure the guards are there first) and you will have all the HGs you want.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I eventually stopped anyway, because a 45th level wizard came<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in and was doin a pretty good job clearing the area of all but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; occasional single pop of HGs (can&#39;t do much with just one!   :)  This<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fine.  Fairly done, and the biggest drawback to using charm in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first place.  Lack of mobs to charm.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just though I&#39;d share, since it was so rediculously moronic.  :)<br/>
