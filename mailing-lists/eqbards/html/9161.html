<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034880021">How about this, big guild quest, our leader has died,<br/>
and to resurect him the guild goes to the far ends of<br/>
Norrath to collect pieces for a ressurection spell.  I<br/>
was holding the final, crucial piece after a week of<br/>
questing.  I was in High Hold Pass, the meeting was an<br/>
hour away, so I start burning towards Lesser Fey with<br/>
the final ingrediant.  After the zones, the boat trip,<br/>
running throung Greater Fey, all the guildsay is<br/>
bascially &quot;is he here yet&quot;.  I&#39;m blazing, I look down<br/>
to grab my drink, I look up and I&#39;m leaping from the<br/>
top of the wizard gate at full speed.  This was back<br/>
before high level clerics where running around all<br/>
over the place.  The guild decided to go ahead without<br/>
me, as I was bound in HHK.  I was soooooooo mad.  Now<br/>
it seems funny, but man...<br/>

&gt; Just thought I&#39;d share this little tid-bit of idiocy<br/>
&gt; with y&#39;all....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just yesterday, I finally decided to go get my<br/>
&gt; Lambent Bracer (my first<br/>
&gt; lambent piece). I contacted my druid friend and had<br/>
&gt; him gate me to<br/>
&gt; lavastorm.  I entered the temple and made my way to<br/>
&gt; the two quest NPC&#39;s<br/>
&gt; (forget their names).  I was checking and<br/>
&gt; re-checking, to make sure I had<br/>
&gt; the correct components/cash.  I was asking about all<br/>
&gt; the Lambent pieces -<br/>
&gt; insuring that my list was still up-to-date.  As soon<br/>
&gt; as I typed the &#39;a&#39; in<br/>
&gt; lambent, I started attacking the female NPC.  I made<br/>
&gt; a futile attempt to<br/>
&gt; flee, but I made it no further than 10 paces before<br/>
&gt; I became worm food.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My friend asks : &quot;What are you doing in Greater<br/>
&gt; faydark?&quot;<br/>
&gt; I respond : &quot;You won&#39;t believe what I just did...&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Needless to say, that was about the single dumbest<br/>
&gt; thing I&#39;ve done in this<br/>
&gt; game yet.  Since I was feeling pretty bad about<br/>
&gt; myself (I must admit it was<br/>
&gt; pretty hilarious though) I wanted to see if any of<br/>
&gt; you fine bards had<br/>
&gt; boneheaded experiences of your own to share.<br/>
