<div id="ygrps-yiv-441268665">Yes, and I know for a fact that Diablo 2 will be horrible, because it&#39;s<br/>
published by Cendant, and they have so little soul that they cook their<br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
Blizzard, you say?  Who cares who DEVELOPS the game?  What matters is who<br/>
PUBLISHES it, because everybody knows it&#39;s the publisher who&#39;s responsible<br/>
for the content.<br/>
<br/>
Ahem... anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I like Asheron&#39;s Call in many ways, but I haven&#39;t played it for quite a<br/>
while.  IMO Turbine&#39;s designed the more interesting world, but Verant&#39;s<br/>
designed the more playable game.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and (straying back onto topic, vaguely) Asheron&#39;s Call won&#39;t have bards,<br/>
at least not for initial release, which probably means not ever.<br/>

&gt;Many of my friends were trying to tell me how good<br/>
&gt;Ashrons Call was going to be when it came out.  But I<br/>
&gt;only had to see one name on the package to know this<br/>
&gt;would not be, for you see, my friends<br/>
