<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026345531">From what I have seen the undead legions in the Qeynos hills were just for a<br/>
GM event, and are now back to being fairly safe to travel and hunt in.<br/>
<br/>
Kitchicor is the killing fields. I have taken to dropping off all my<br/>
equipment off at the bank except for a drum, food and water before<br/>
attempting to cross. It&#39;s not so much that mob&#39;s can catch me while using<br/>
Accelerendo, it&#39;s that people fighting in Kith are training all sorts of<br/>
nasties to the entrances/exits and then hopping zones to saftey. I&#39;ve almost<br/>
died twice now in situations where I made it through the forest without a<br/>
problem only to run into 3-4 undead uber-mobs waiting at the zone exit to<br/>
Highhold or Rivervale.<br/>
<br/>
Fun Fun Fun<br/>
<br/>
The only saving grace I can see is that a lot of the high level group gate<br/>
capable people on Mith Marr are now much friendlier about giving free rides<br/>
across the world :)<br/>

&gt; This rambles a bit, but I ain&#39;t had no coffee so bear with me:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, so Infected Paw is being upgraded.  Hell we all complained that IP was<br/>
&gt; too far from bind points for its designated level to be very useful, so<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; high time for a revamp there.  I&#39;m concerned, however.  Not so much about<br/>
IP<br/>
&gt; being upgraded as the general trend that we&#39;re seeing to make existing<br/>
zones<br/>
&gt; more and more difficult as the mean player base gains in level.  Kithicor,<br/>
&gt; for instance, has been raised to the point where level 50s can&#39;t be<br/>
assured<br/>
&gt; of traveling through the zone without dying.  From what I hear Qeynos<br/>
Hills<br/>
&gt; now spawns high 20s undead such as Skeletal Monks that will make quick<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; out of anyone traveling to/from Qeynos and Blackburrow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I met up with a friend who had just purchased and installed<br/>
&gt; EverQuest.  He started a warrior in Qeynos.  I&#39;m teaching an experienced<br/>
&gt; gamer, but complete EQ newbie things like &quot;don&#39;t kill wolves and bears<br/>
near<br/>
&gt; Holly and Cros Treewind&quot;, &quot;/con everything&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t be afraid to run&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;monsters can&#39;t follow you through zones&quot;, dmg/atk ratios, what is AC,<br/>
etc.,<br/>
&gt; etc.  I&#39;m not big on twinking so I didn&#39;t give him much.  A fine steel<br/>
sword<br/>
&gt; and 20pp for milk and muffins.  But is Qeynos Hills going to kick his ass?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What about Enchanters born on the East side of the world from Kithicor?<br/>
&gt; Their level 8 animation spell in in High Keep, as are bards level 16 songs<br/>
&gt; (some better because of Selo&#39;s, granted).  At level 8 a true EQ newbie has<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; very difficult time just finding out that his spell is *in* High Keep and<br/>
&gt; then making his way from Ak&#39;Anon or Freeport.  My god, now the obvious<br/>
route<br/>
&gt; takes him through Kithicor.  He might never have ever seen anything more<br/>
&gt; aggresive than a Young Kodiak or the odd Hill Giant.  The sad thing is<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; the Hill Giants that he&#39;s seen are *considerably* easier to kill than any<br/>
&gt; undead that he&#39;s going to run into in Kithicor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suppose what I&#39;m saying is that Verant is increasing the difficulty by<br/>
&gt; leaps and bounds of *existing* zones in order to compensate for the high<br/>
&gt; level player base.  This is detrimental to the true EQ newbies.  If *I*<br/>
&gt; started a Gnome Enchanter right now, I&#39;d know that I could invis (lvl 4<br/>
&gt; spell for them) and travel the boat to Freeport, EC, NRo, Oasis, SRo,<br/>
&gt; Innothule, Feerrott, Rathe Mts, SK, NK, WK, HH, HK if I really wanted to<br/>
&gt; avoid Kithicor.  OR get a high level escort during the day and save a<br/>
bunch<br/>
&gt; of time and zoning.  But a real newbie has no idea of what awaits him when<br/>
&gt; he zones from the tranquil WC in to Kith.  Mayhem, madness and swift death<br/>
&gt; and exp. loss.  What would *you* do if you had no friends in EQ and got<br/>
&gt; killed with one spell by an Undead Cleric somewhere between WC and the<br/>
&gt; Rivervale entrance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most people on this list are experienced players.  Some of us are *very*<br/>
&gt; experienced players.  If we started new characters, even completely<br/>
&gt; untwinked, we would be able to avoid these things because we know the game<br/>
&gt; *so* well.  We take the depth of our knowledge for granted.  I remember<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; in late May when I first install EQ - do you remember when you first<br/>
&gt; installed it?  Remember how completely freakin&#39; lost you were?  Now put<br/>
&gt; Kithicor between you and something that you need as much as a level 8<br/>
&gt; enchanters needs Mircyl&#39;s Animation.  Say you&#39;re a level 6 bard in<br/>
Freeport<br/>
&gt; and hear &quot;Are you [interested] in delivering [mail]?&quot;, &quot;We need [mail]<br/>
&gt; delivered to [High Keep].  Are you [interested]?&quot;<br/>
