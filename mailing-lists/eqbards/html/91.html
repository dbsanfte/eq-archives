<div id="ygrps-yiv-276712282">Hail to all bards!!  I am new to the roleplaying games<br/>
and find it to be enthrolling and addictive!  I also<br/>
find it to be overwhelming at times, if you don&#39;t know<br/>
anyone and don&#39;t know any of the commands.  Sineras,<br/>
until you mentioned that there is a location command,<br/>
I didn&#39;t have a clue...just remember there are people<br/>
out there that don&#39;t know and don&#39;t know how to find<br/>
out...and find out by luck alone or nice bards who<br/>
offer advice!!!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Number of questions made that I&#39;ll just sum up in<br/>
&gt; this one message.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.	Where is Kelin&#39; Lugubrious Lament?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Kelethin Bard&#39;s Guild. Bout 4 plat, 6 gold.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.	What does it do?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Lowers a creature&#39;s reaction to you (won&#39;t attack<br/>
&gt; you) for a short while.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t try to get a screenshot of yourself standing<br/>
&gt; next to the creature<br/>
&gt; though. =) I think help is the thing that makes them<br/>
&gt; come after you if you<br/>
&gt; attack one of their buddies. (Orc camps are prime<br/>
&gt; examples). Agro<br/>
&gt; (arressiveness) would prolly be what makes it decide<br/>
&gt; to attack you for<br/>
&gt; simply invading its personal space. It does seem to<br/>
&gt; wear off after a short<br/>
&gt; while. And I think the skill needed is singing so no<br/>
&gt; instrument.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.	Does Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord work yet?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	The damage part of it works, can&#39;t tell about the<br/>
&gt; AC penalty though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.	Hymn of Restoration in combat?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I almost always play it unless I know I can easily<br/>
&gt; defeat the creature I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; fighting against. Even though you only get a few hps<br/>
&gt; back a tick, it will be<br/>
&gt; significant during a long battle. Many a times have<br/>
&gt; I been victorious<br/>
&gt; because of those extra hps I healed during the<br/>
&gt; fight. This song seems to do<br/>
&gt; an extra 2hps for every 6 levels gained after 6th.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5.	Same post mentioned about running and bellowing a<br/>
&gt; wisp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Heh, how about that. This song seems to do an extra<br/>
&gt; 1 damage for every 2<br/>
&gt; levels gained after 12th.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6.	A post about experience percentages.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	The only thing I can attribute is that the level<br/>
&gt; window for exp in a group<br/>
&gt; might not be as it is written (which I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; written to be 4 levels<br/>
&gt; wide)...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 7.	On a matter of starting a bard and what<br/>
&gt; attributes should be picked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	In beta I jacked my charisma and got fairly good<br/>
&gt; prices as the most<br/>
&gt; immediate benefit. For final I put enough into<br/>
&gt; strength to wear plate and<br/>
&gt; everything else into dexterity so that my chance to<br/>
&gt; hit is greater. I seem<br/>
&gt; to be fairly adept at hitting near or at the top<br/>
&gt; range of the damage scale<br/>
&gt; so I don&#39;t know if any more strength will help in<br/>
&gt; combat. I do seem to be<br/>
&gt; hitting more then in beta with the better dex,<br/>
&gt; though. Only drop into<br/>
&gt; intelligence if you *really* want your skills to<br/>
&gt; rocket. It has no effect on<br/>
&gt; songs since we don&#39;t use mana. I prolly wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even consider it really.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 8.	Quests in Kelethin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Almost all quests I&#39;ve seen can be done as many<br/>
&gt; times as you want. The game<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t really seem to keep track of state other<br/>
&gt; then any item you might be<br/>
&gt; given, which would key the next part of the quest<br/>
&gt; when you give it to the<br/>
&gt; correct person. I&#39;ve seen newbie bards make the<br/>
&gt; &#39;watch report&#39; run to the<br/>
&gt; docks in Queynos over and over again to get 2nd<br/>
&gt; level without fighting a<br/>
&gt; thing. It&#39;s not often you&#39;ll find a quest that will<br/>
&gt; give more money that<br/>
&gt; what is required to buy the things neccessary to<br/>
&gt; complete it. Good example<br/>
&gt; are the Deathfist Slashed Belts that cost about 3<br/>
&gt; gold in stores but you get<br/>
&gt; maybe 7 copper back when you hand them in to the<br/>
&gt; quest person. Course you<br/>
&gt; get a good faction adjustment....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 9.	Charging fees for corpse hunting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Chances are good that if they forgot to do a /loc<br/>
&gt; before dying they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how much they might have on them in terms of<br/>
&gt; money so they won&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; if they can pay you until you get there. Usually the<br/>
&gt; &#39;accept any donations&#39;<br/>
&gt; thing works well unless they are real knobs, in<br/>
&gt; which case you can lead them<br/>
&gt; into some nasty spot, drop them from the group, turn<br/>
&gt; on speed, and burn<br/>
&gt; outta there leaving them behind. =) jk Seriously, if<br/>
&gt; they lost a character<br/>
&gt; before, they&#39;ll reward you well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Good Journey,<br/>
