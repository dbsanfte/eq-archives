<div id="ygrps-yiv-436156816">If the bard class problems with monster attraction, song fizzles and<br/>
everything else on the Concert Hall Bard Petition were never fixed, I would<br/>
still be estatic if we got an automatic song weaver.  Its very hard for me<br/>
(33.6 modem) to weave 3 songs at once, even when I&#39;m having a great day in<br/>
regards to ping/pl, and if I&#39;m getting anything but the best conn my isp<br/>
can offer, then it becomes impossible, sometimes making it hard to weave 2.<br/>
 I don&#39;t think a person should be penalized this way for having a slow<br/>
conn(I am a little bias), but if this were presented to Verant I&#39;m sure<br/>
they would just take out weaving all together to rid themselves of the<br/>
problem.<br/>
