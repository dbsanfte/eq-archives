<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524178331">Hail Maev! I TOTALLY agree about the belt ... on the issue of the spear I<br/>
woulnt have minded that either.. My peircing(as well as all applicable wep<br/>
skills) are maxxed I normally duel wield 2 obsidian shards believe it or<br/>
not( no flaming me for it they proc on AVERAGE 5 times PER MOB I have<br/>
unbuffed dex of almost 160) now its true the one rogue that was there would<br/>
probably have put it to better use BUT I would probably have used it if I<br/>
had got it.<br/>
so we did random with those who could use it..<br/>
<br/>
THEN came the belt and I forgot who the casters name was but he yelled since<br/>
it was an all all that EVERYONE randoms for it.. now THAT is crossing the<br/>
line.. I would LOVE LOVE LOVED to have that belt..i WOULD use it and I WANT<br/>
a haste sash as I do not have one yet..<br/>
<br/>
I do agree bard are very deserving of a roll  in the belt.. a caster on the<br/>
other hand....... I dont think should<br/>

&gt;One issue that was raised on this Vox raid really popped a vein in my<br/>
&gt;forehead.<br/>
&gt;It was when it came around to randoming off the Runed Bolster Belt.<br/>
&gt;This is an ac 5, +10 str, +10 dex, +10 sta belt with haste effect. The<br/>
&gt;question was raised if bards were worthy of this item, given their melee<br/>
&gt;abilities etc. The way I look at it is the way Verant designed us.. if I<br/>
&gt;had my choice between that belt and any instrument in the game<br/>
&gt;(Maestro&#39;s lute for example), I&#39;d glady choose the belt. Surely the item<br/>
&gt;would be best in the hands of a monk, warrior, rogue, or ranger. But is<br/>
&gt;a bard deserving of an item like that? What do you all think?<br/>
