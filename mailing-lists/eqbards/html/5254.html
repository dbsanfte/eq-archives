<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367876086">I have also been having a lot of problems with missed notes. I&#39;m not very<br/>
high level yet (just made 13 couple nites ago), but I hadn&#39;t had problems<br/>
missing notes on those songs before that patch went into effect... I don&#39;t<br/>
know if it&#39;s server specific or not, as none of the other bards from my<br/>
server have been heard from (or at least I havn&#39;t seen any of them saying<br/>
they&#39;re having problems).<br/>
