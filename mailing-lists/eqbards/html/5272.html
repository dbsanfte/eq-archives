 </span></blockquote>I would travel to Permafrost and find a good group, in the time it takes you to gain 22nd you should gain alot of med bronze from the Ice gobbies there, just dont go past Flag room.  Then sell your combine (you should get near 50p for it, and go to HH and buy a Tommie, or take a shot at Thulian Claws which may cost you more... I have the Tommy and have been collecting the bronze now (Im 21st level also). The dirk will really help out in Perma, the gobbie casters HATE it.<br/>

        I&#39;m Level 21 with 2 bubbs - still hobnobbing around in banded.  I do have a Bronze Collar - but like the bonuses from my spliked...  I have 300 plats burning a hole in my bank vault.  I wield a Dragoon Dirk and a combine Longsword.<br/>
    <br/>
        My basic assumption for spending that cash is to upgrade to Bronze - but do people think otherwise.  Also - what is a fair price for Bronze Armor.<br/>
    <br/>
    Much Thanks<br/>
