<div id="ygrps-yiv-240884912">I revived my retired warrior (I had forgotten how much fun trolls are to<br/>
play, act like an idiot and talk funny then call it roleplaying), I<br/>
tried for about a week to buy large banded (when i retired him, I gave<br/>
all his stuff to my freinds).  Finally a very nice elfy (Klantic) made<br/>
me a full set for free!<br/>
<br/>
It was pretty fun building up his equipment.  Sat AM, wake up at 4 EST<br/>
because I have an infected wisdom tooth and my painkillers ran out of<br/>
steam (youch!).  <br/>
<br/>
Decide to do something fun on EQ, I want to bring Elfson (my bard) back<br/>
from vacation, but I gave most of his equipment to my friends.  Then I<br/>
remeber the lvl 18 troll I had on Rodcet Nife.  Woohoo!  Naked and<br/>
broke, i charge into Innothule swamp, bashing everthing I see, hoping an<br/>
armed decaying skeleton shows up.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty soon I am armed with a rusty warhammer and a cracked staff (with<br/>
a 1HB skill of 1).  Much better!  Soon I have pretty near close to full<br/>
cloth and I remember the quest to get the rusty axe in Grobb. Woohoo!  I<br/>
can use a skill I actually have now!  I need some money so I can start<br/>
buying better equipment.  So I camp the dervs in S Ro, building up<br/>
100P.  I go up to Freeport buy a langseax and a Shiny Brass Halbred. <br/>
Now I&#39;m in business!<br/>
<br/>
What fun!  From naked and broke to badly equipped in mere hours!<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
