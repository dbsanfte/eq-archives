<div id="ygrps-yiv-293049786">Heh quite simple I believe it a was a enchanter, cleric, bard , shaman,<br/>
druid and a ranger. Not postiive but I believe that was the class. People do<br/>
things that really aren&#39;t hard like brining 10 people to do the lord room or<br/>
3 full groups to do efreeti. I&#39;ve found that most people just don&#39;t know how<br/>
to effectively play their class to the full potential.<br/>

&gt;Wait a second.  We&#39;re talking about Seafury Cyclops right?  In OOT?  If so<br/>

&gt;that was a group of six necros soloing.  Those things spawn *rediculously*<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Heh even without necros I think  my necro and a 42 enchanter<br/>
&gt;&gt; friend kept the<br/>
&gt;&gt; isle basically cleared. Often times I&#39;ll go there and they&#39;ll will be one<br/>
&gt;&gt; group who keeps it cleared without necros. Just need to have the<br/>
&gt;&gt; right group<br/>
&gt;&gt; for it. Besides which as I stated that place is camped like mad and they<br/>
&gt;&gt; recently lowered exp that you get from furies.<br/>
