<div id="ygrps-yiv-158542711"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Was it a PC shaman duel or a NPC shaman combat?  I thought the general<br/>
&gt; consensus was that NPC casters had unlimited mana and therefore the 35 mana<br/>
&gt; drain song was useless against them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  A PC shaman.  Instead of saying it, I said she ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  That should of gave it away ;p  (I&#39;m not a Verant coder, hah!)<br/>

  All priest classes would fall this way to a bard.<br/>
<br/>
  Bring up elemental rhythms with a drum, and pixie them, twisting<br/>
  in L40 dispel song, it takes about 30 seconds of pixie/dispel to<br/>
  rip down all those buffs they put on before your fight.<br/>
<br/>
  Once their buffs are gone, pixie/drain them.<br/>
<br/>
  Then pixie/vov them... priests classes have about 1k hp base<br/>
  with all their buffs stripped away and very low ac (around 700).<br/>
  Basically they get reamed pretty quickly, it only takes about<br/>
  2 mins to melee them dead.<br/>
<br/>
  Clerics like to Flash of Light alot, but since my base MR is above<br/>
  60 it never sticks.  However, you cannot let clerics get stuns off<br/>
  on you, and you cannot let them heal.  They are by far the most<br/>
  challenging of the priest classes.<br/>
<br/>
  Druids, followed by Shamans, illustrate the weak end.<br/>
