<b>Subject:</b> RE: Guilds and Dragon Raids <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769728502">An alternate guild philosophy: be nice, be honest, be trustworthy.  We don&#39;t control<br/>
information, we don&#39;t exclude people from raids, and we don&#39;t bad-mouth other<br/>
peoples&#39; playing.  On the other hand we also don&#39;t enjoy stupid people - which is<br/>
something that all pick-up raids suffer from ;P.<br/>
<br/>
We have had many instances where the guild tag above one of our members&#39; heads was<br/>
enough for someone to give consent for corpse recovery.  I am proud of that.<br/>
<br/>
We are in the third wave of high levels in our guild.  The first wave saw people<br/>
switching to twinks a lot - their 50s are in the third wave ;P.<br/>
<br/>
Many in the second wave left to form another guild.  Some people thoughtfully and<br/>
respectfully posted to our web site and resigned.  They were sincerely wished well. <br/>
Some left without a word - that wasn&#39;t a welcome attitude, but no one persecuted<br/>
them for it.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have a lot of firepower to do more fun things....and many of us are immersed<br/>
in Kunark haha.  We have about 50 planes-capable players but little interest in the<br/>
planes lately ;P.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of appreciation for a bard&#39;s contribution and a lot of willingness to<br/>
work out tactics, which is great =).<br/>
