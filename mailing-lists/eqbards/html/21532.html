<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901581000">Q: Who needs rez when you have screech?<br/>
A: Whoever else happens to be unlucky enough to be in the dungeon when you<br/>
fire it off   <br/>
   and all those mobs run into the room they had secreted themselves away<br/>
in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve been using it in Kaesora as an interrupt against Strathebone<br/>
&gt;Healers (I think they&#39;re around 30-33, it&#39;s a guess) and at 40 I get<br/>
&gt;about a 1/3 - 1/5 resist rate depending on cha and luck (low cha of<br/>
&gt;119, high cha of 134).  I could comfortably hold one and interrupt<br/>
&gt;heals when it was just a 43 pallie and myself but the addition of<br/>
&gt;anything else and we would have to book for zone.  Who needs rez when<br/>
&gt;you have screech?<br/>
