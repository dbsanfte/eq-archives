<div id="ygrps-yiv-693303570">Yes, the Chords of Dissonance can give a nasty wakeup call to those who<br/>
first try it. I too have found my self suddenly under attack when I used it<br/>
in the east commons. there is a Militia guard that Patrols from Freeport to<br/>
the first INN past the west gate. I had just killed a beast and greedily<br/>
went to scavenge what I could find. I saw him approaching and paid no<br/>
attention. Next thing I know I am under attack by him. I was dead before I<br/>
could rise to my feet.<br/>
<br/>
	When I awoke outside the west gate, I went to get my body then I went my<br/>
memory of what I heard before I was killed to figure what I did. It was<br/>
clear that the guard walked close enough to hear the song and was affected.<br/>
Everyone&#39;s a music critic I guess... So he felt he was under attack and<br/>
retaliated. The Militia is not know for their intelligence, and over<br/>
reacted. but I put it up to experience and now am very careful about using<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
	I wonder though, for in the past I have used it and people have come to<br/>
help me in battle and I see them get the flash, but no &#39;&lt;put name here&gt;<br/>
winces&#39;. So I was wondering since I am not on a PvP server the person does<br/>
not receive any damage I hope.<br/>
<br/>
	I wonder if this is a way for a meaner Bard to prevent others from coming<br/>
up and throwing the last whack in on a creature that you have spent a lot of<br/>
time wearing down? Not that I would ever consider such a thing...<br/>

&gt; If it makes you feel any better, I don&#39;t know any bards who haven&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; killed because of Chords of Dissonance mishaps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As to the poster below, his explanation of raining on everyone in the<br/>
&gt; area is a good one.  Guards etc. ARE killable at high levels, and they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t appreciate you attacking them.  What he says after that is a)<br/>
&gt; confusing, since that isn&#39;t what you were doing and b) rude and uncalled<br/>
&gt; for.  I&#39;d ignore that part.<br/>
