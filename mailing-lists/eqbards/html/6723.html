<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089507556">That doesn&#39;t mean GZ can&#39;t change his mind though.  If enough bards voiced a<br/>
legitimate concern perhaps he could be convinced to eliminate the level 37<br/>
limit. <br/>

&gt; Getting past the l37 limit would help a lot. I think that was one of the<br/>
&gt; more depressing things I found about high level. I didn&#39;t realise how<br/>
&gt; much I&#39;d come to depend on charm to bail out healers and casters from<br/>
&gt; frenzied mobs until I couldn&#39;t use it anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, from that reply from GZ posted a while back, I can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; that happening. It seems he feels that having our charm last 15 sec<br/>
&gt; compared to whatever time an enchanter&#39;s lasts isn&#39;t enough, so he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want us to be able to charm at high levels. He said it would be<br/>
&gt; too powerful.<br/>
