<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067666756">I have used this song for getting down off of high places (Aviak Tower in <br/>
South Karana).  The song will set you down on the ground if you teleport off <br/>
the tower.<br/>
<br/>
Another was in dueling outdoors.  I has dueling a Paladin once, and he was <br/>
using Flash of Light to blind me, most annoying.  So when he would blind me <br/>
I would fire off MMM and then bellow him till my sight returned.  On a <br/>
simliar note I have used it outdoors to get the little bit of room needed to <br/>
take off running when the battle goes bad.  This works very well for a party <br/>
as the group gets dispersed in all directions.  Giving everyone a better <br/>
chance of getting out alive (except for the unlucky person that gets the <br/>
critters attention).<br/>

&gt;Anyone ever found a use for this song? Moving around in Solsek A would be a<br/>
&gt;good thing NOT to do with it...:o) Evacing a room in Unrest? Anything <br/>
&gt;useful<br/>
&gt;at ALL?<br/>
