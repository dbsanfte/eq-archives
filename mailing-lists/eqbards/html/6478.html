<div id="ygrps-yiv-12121796">Changes... all for the worse IMO<br/>
<br/>
My box of Akubar&#39;s a piece of crap now, it used to reduce weight to 0 and<br/>
now it reduces weight by 20% (ooooh what a great item for such a rare drop!)<br/>
<br/>
Mino Bracers, i asked a ranger what he had on as bracers last night, he<br/>
shows it to me, nice item, 10 str buff and some resists as well, oops doh<br/>
crap, he cant re-equip it as slam bam thank you ma&#39;am its now warrior only.<br/>
<br/>
Selo&#39;s as others mentioned got nerfed<br/>
<br/>
Crafted bracers used to sell for 115pp to vendors and now for only 9pp<br/>
<br/>
I dunno what else has changed, but all in all i found last night quite<br/>
depressing<br/>

&gt; Apparently there&#39;s been a lot of unannounced changes with the last patch.<br/>
&gt; Just wondering what new things people have seen/noticed.  I&#39;m not looking<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; hear complaints about this being nerfed and that being ruined.  Just<br/>
&gt; wondering what funky new stuff people have seen like Shadow Men, mushrooms<br/>
&gt; and cabbages.  Also any changes that we, as bards should watch out for.<br/>
