&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once again I was reminded why I hate Crushbone and other places like it.<br/>
&gt; I died horribly to a castle train last night.  Now I am starting to get<br/>
&gt; used to it, but what troubles me is the fact that every orc just loves to<br/>
&gt; target me.  For instance I was watching a group fighting in the castle, I<br/>
&gt; figured well I can&#39;t kill any before someone steals the kill so I stood<br/>
&gt; and watched.  Standing by the table in the throne room, I was suddenly<br/>
&gt; attacked by 4 orcs in the throne room.  Now I wasn&#39;t fighting, nor was I<br/>
&gt; severely injur, but the orcs decided I was a bigger target than the rest<br/>
&gt; of players actually attacking them.   So like usual I get mauled by a<br/>
&gt; Royal guard, 2 emmisaries and a Lego.  Now that wasn&#39;t too bad and I could<br/>
&gt; have gotten away until DVinn ran by and thought I was a better target than<br/>
&gt; the guy who was fighting him.  Now I ask why would a mob want to fight me<br/>
&gt; over the person attacking it????  It makes no sense to me and the fact<br/>
&gt; that I am in no way a tank makes it way too difficult for me to stay<br/>
&gt; alive.  Now I would either like the ability to fight better or for Verant<br/>
&gt; to tone the aggro towards bards just a little.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW has anyone noticed a faction hit message whenever something dies<br/>
&gt; around you??  I was hunting Gnolls in Highhold pass and was constantly<br/>
&gt; given a faction hit message everytime something died.  This occurs whether<br/>
&gt; I attacked it or not.  I was singing anthem or hymm at the times when this<br/>
&gt; occured and none of my party members attacked anything at all.  What<br/>
&gt; gives?<br/>
