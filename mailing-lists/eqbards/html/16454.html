Two and I usually replace it with something else.<br/>

I have enough difficulty deciding which songs to keep<br/>
memorized.  If I&#39;m going to have Chain loaded for emergencies,<br/>
I&#39;d rather not have to keep Binding loaded.  Also, the<br/>
slowdown for CoC is not as great as for Chain/Binding from my<br/>
tests.<br/>
