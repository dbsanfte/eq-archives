<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118307429">What you are seeing is definitely texture loading delays.  EQ really likes to have at least 128MB to run<br/>
with no swapping.  When you&#39;re running with only (God, when did it become ONLY?) 64MB, as I do on my home<br/>
system, it goes to the HD, because the textures are loaded in virtual memory, but aren&#39;t in the working<br/>
set.  From then on, even if the texture isn&#39;t on the card, it&#39;s probably in the working set, so you don&#39;t<br/>
see the texture loads going to HD (though you still may see slowdowns from the memory transfers to the<br/>
card).  And as was pointed out, this is much worse when a lot of people around, due to all the textures<br/>
involved (characters have by far the most amount of texture data).  It also seems that this mouse jump<br/>
problem is more prevalent if you have a USB mouse, presumably because the drivers behave differently when<br/>
the CPU is busy.  I personally never use the mouse but for inventory management, but have seen the problem<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
This is why Verant says you should have at least 350MB of swap space available to run EQ.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I get momentary pauses of maybe a tenth of a second or so when I turn these<br/>
&gt; &gt; corners.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the textures for the buildings as much as<br/>
&gt; &gt; player textures.  There isn&#39;t really a noticeable pause when there&#39;s only 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; or 2 people by the bank, but if there&#39;s even 10 people, the pause is a lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; longer (relatively, it pauses maybe half a second.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, that&#39;s about the same length of my pause.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How much ram in on your video card?  I have 32M.. that might be why my<br/>
&gt; &gt; pauses are shorter.. it keeps more textures in Ram..  just a thought.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 16MB, but the game is designed to run on a card with 4MB, so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think this is the case.  Like I said, I think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; something about the mouse acceleration freaking out when one<br/>
&gt; &quot;instant&quot; the mouse is here, and the next &quot;instant&quot; (after the<br/>
&gt; hard drive and CPU have done the data transfer) the mouse is<br/>
&gt; all the way over there.  I don&#39;t have the problem when I turn<br/>
&gt; with the keyboard, but the turn rate doing that is much lower.<br/>
&gt; The problem is much less pronounced in glide mode.<br/>
