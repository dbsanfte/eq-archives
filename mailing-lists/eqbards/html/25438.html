<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584047041">Well to be honest, and I have never done this so I can not really talk,<br/>
you have to have some logs parsed to know whether you saw what you think<br/>
you saw.  Like I said, I am too lazy to have ever done these things<br/>
myself, but I am also too skeptical to accept that anything has changed<br/>
without hard data.  Not saying it isn&#39;t possible, we know VI.<br/>
<br/>
On that note, I would also go ALL points to STA, like I did with the<br/>
monk I made when I came back.<br/>

bad<br/>
effects when your sta bar id depleted.  I think that they have (stealth<br/>
nerf) changed this recently.  Only last week, I had first hand<br/>
experience<br/>
with a 56 warrior who has sta way over 100 and when his sta bar<br/>
depleted,<br/>
you could see a noticeable slow down in his attack speed (and when he<br/>
got a<br/>
sta replenish buff, you could see it get noticable faster.) Even so, I<br/>
would<br/>
reccommend to ppl starting bards that they max out sta then put the rest<br/>
in<br/>
dex or str (forget cha - your cha is prolly fine and easy enough to<br/>
boost<br/>
with jewel craft bracers etc.) Sta adds hps and every little bit helps.<br/>
