&gt;Also, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a row in one of <br/>
&gt;these unfortunate instances. If you respawn and are immediately attacked by <br/>
&gt;a guard at your bind point, you need to use the /quit command. This <br/>
&gt;immediately exits you from the game without the 30 second camping wait. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um - beggin&#39; the cap&#39;n&#39;s pardon, but how, praytell, do you type /quit when<br/>
you&#39;re dead?<br/>
<br/>
And you are aware that /quit doesn&#39;t really remove your character from the<br/>
world, right?  It&#39;s a forced emergency disconnect.  Your character stays<br/>
&quot;logged in&quot; until it times out (2-5 minutes later).  2-5 minutes is a whole<br/>
lotta dying.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to second the motion: binding in evil cities is bad, m&#39;kay?  Heck<br/>
- even my EVIL character got KOS&#39;d in Grobb!  These cities are NOT meant to<br/>
be bound in, and I will concur - that at least Grobb now has a wandering<br/>
Basher near the entrance.<br/>
