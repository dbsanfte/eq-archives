<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122018199">Many thanks for the praise.  I haven&#39;t seen any clues to either of these<br/>
items.  Of course it could well be like the component for the summon corpse<br/>
spell started out.  They should be in the game, but if GZ even has a<br/>
different client than every live person out there, chances are there a lot<br/>
more things they think they put in that never made it to the live servers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll redouble my efforts in looking for them but none of the usual suspect<br/>
merchants have them.  maybe if you do one of the quests 30 times you will<br/>
get one of them.<br/>

Of all the people I know on E&#39;ci, Kitasi has done more quests than anyone<br/>
else.  If he hasn&#39;t gotten any clues yet about these instruments, then I&#39;m<br/>
inclined to believe that they fall into the Fiery Avenger category.<br/>

&gt; As anothe side note, GZ said that Kelin&#39;s practice lute and the small<br/>
&gt; brass <br/>
&gt; trumpet are both in the game, you just have to look hard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this another Fiery avenger? I have noticed that a few wierd people sell<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; bardic instruments (Krak in South Karana??) so maybe you need good faction<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; with some of them to get a quest?<br/>
