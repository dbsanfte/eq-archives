<div id="ygrps-yiv-292558714">Bronze is found in Unrest, and you can easily buy it there from higher<br/>
level players who loot it.<br/>
<br/>
It has the same AC and slightly less weight than the platemail that you can<br/>
buy from merchants.<br/>
<br/>
I am level 17 and I have a full set. It only cost me about 300 plat total<br/>
for the full set.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the additional Armor Class rating, I believe platemail absorbs<br/>
damage from more kinds of attacks, and absorbs it better. (See other post).<br/>
<br/>
If you want some easy loot in a safe dungeon, go to Paw. At level 18 you<br/>
can solo the whole place, but still get exp from captains, commanders, and<br/>
the high shamans. Snakeskin armor and the sought after runed totem staff<br/>
are your rewards. I bring back 100 plat worth of loot on every trip. And on<br/>
Fenin Ro the zone goes neglected. I have never seen it with more than 20<br/>
people, and very often I am the only one there.<br/>

&gt;Looking for some good ideas for soloing and small team hunting around 18th<br/>
&gt;level.  Currently I am hunting Beholder Maze frequently , sometimes high<br/>
&gt;hold pass or Oasis of Marr.  Any good suggestions?  Are any of the multitude<br/>
&gt;of islands out in the Ocean of Tears any good?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately I seem to have solo hunting and hunting with a cleric partner<br/>
&gt;down to an art, but whenever I get into a group I always seem to die.  As<br/>
&gt;you all know, we frequently become the baiters because of our speed, and<br/>
&gt;because of that if you pick up more than the chosen monster to fight<br/>
&gt;accidentally, death is not a far step away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I am outfitted in full banded, but have not even seen a place with the<br/>
&gt;bronze armor some have spoken of, or some of the many magic items that<br/>
&gt;proliferate the deeper dungeons.<br/>
