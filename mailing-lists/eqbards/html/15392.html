&gt; The most obvious explanation is sloppy coding by Verant.  Instead of using<br/>
&gt; hard numbers for EXP loss, its possible Verant uses a graphical<br/>
&gt; representation instead.  For example, you just made 31st when you die.<br/>
&gt; Using Wayne&#39;s numbers below, you are supposed to lose 500 EXP pts<br/>
&gt; (500/1000=20%= a full bub on the bar).  But its possible the game doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use hard numbers and instead says you lose a full bub on the bar (when you<br/>
&gt; die in hell+1) and then calculates how many EXP points you need to lose in<br/>
&gt; order to graphically drop a full bub.  Since you just made 31st, you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a full bar&#39;s worth of pixels built up on the EXP bar so you lose a<br/>
&gt; level.  Here is where the sloppy coding comes into play.  Instead of<br/>
&gt; applying the hell level rule (1/4 bub using Wayne&#39;s numbers), it applies the<br/>
&gt; hell+1 rule EXP (one full bub).  So now you are back at 30th level with a<br/>
&gt; full bub to get 31st back.  End result is that instead of losing 500 EXP pts<br/>
&gt; (one full bub at 31st level), you lost 2000 EXP pts (one full bub at 30th<br/>
&gt; level).    <br/>

4 times - talk about anticipating the mana song) resulted in<br/>
about a bubble loss, as opposed to the half bubble into 30 the<br/>
first time.<br/>
<br/>
Is it that hard to believe Verant deliberately coded in a<br/>
bigger exp loss at HL+1?  In a morbid sort of way, it makes<br/>
sense to me.  You can think of quickly-advancing players as<br/>
two types - ones who just don&#39;t die a lot, and ones who die a<br/>
lot and play a lot.  Hell levels slow down the ones who don&#39;t<br/>
die.  HL+1 exp loss slows down the the ones who die a lot but<br/>
play a lot.  (The ones who don&#39;t die a lot and play a lot you<br/>
can&#39;t do much about.)<br/>
