<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240553309">While wandering around the Lake of Ill Omen zone I was approaced by a person<br/>
who goes by the name of Wabs.   This person told me, and apparently another<br/>
bard, that wearing the Mask of Deception and having it activated caused a<br/>
substantially large XP Penalty.  He stated something like a 30% penalty.<br/>
Now, I have looked over all the bard sites and been reading here for quite<br/>
some time and never seen mention of this.  The other bard that I talked to<br/>
said he had searched the rogue sites with no info found.  Has anyone here<br/>
seen or heard of this penalty?<br/>
