<b>Subject:</b> 1H Slashing Magical Weapon List - Read and comment <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017383072">I sorted through the list of weapons on EQLizer for magic 1H slashing<br/>
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
	The obvious ones are the combine longsword and scimtar, and their<br/>
well-balanced counterparts. Information on these is widely held, so I won&#39;t<br/>
go into detail here.<br/>
<br/>
	First, let me say I measure the damage value of a weapon using a stat<br/>
called damage per second (dps). This is calculated assuming that the delay<br/>
is in tenths of a sec (I think that&#39;s about right). To calculate: ( (damage<br/>
* 2) + 1 ) / (delay / 10)<br/>
<br/>
	Please give me any info you have on any of these weapons, including<br/>
opinons on which is best, how hard they to obtain, how much they sell for<br/>
if sold, etc.<br/>
<br/>
	Also, if there are any missng from this list please add them. (There are<br/>
only 4 here). And two of those are not even confirmed as 1H slashing magic<br/>
weapons.  If they are not magic and 1H slashing then I am very much hoping<br/>
I am missing some good ones from this list. <br/>
<br/>

Damage 7 / Delay 28 = 5.35 dps<br/>

<br/>

Have no idea where it is found.<br/>
<br/>

Don&#39;t have any idea where to find it<br/>

Please help on this one, I like the stats!<br/>
