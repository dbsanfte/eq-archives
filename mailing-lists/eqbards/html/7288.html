<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a question.. how do you know what level you are at when<br/>
you are being trained? The last I remember, the message you get<br/>
is &quot;Your language skills have improved!&quot; and no number. It gets<br/>
pretty boring sitting there watching your friend spam you in<br/>
some unreadable gobbly gook.  =)</div>
