<div id="ygrps-yiv-939459857">I agree but that isn&#39;t a valid arguement for removing xp penalties.  It&#39;s a<br/>
valid arguement for changing the way that group experience is shared.  It<br/>
should be based on level, not on total xp gained.  The reason it was set up<br/>
the way it is was that Verant felt, and I tend to agree with them, that<br/>
friends would be grouping alot and would want to level at the same rate so<br/>
they divided xp the way they did so that friends would level at around the<br/>
same rate.<br/>
<br/>
This worked, but the problem is that most people do not, in fact, group with<br/>
their &#39;friends&#39; regularly and thus groups of strangers are penalized for the<br/>
hybrid&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately experience sharing is embedded deeply into the client and I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if Verant is willing to totally re-write the game engine to fix<br/>
something that was put in intentionally.  I&#39;m not sure I would expect them<br/>
to.<br/>

&gt; level slower.  This unfairly penalizes your group members for what is<br/>
