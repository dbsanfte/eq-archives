<div id="ygrps-yiv-92259856">Part of that is because some bards (namely ones<br/>
that don&#39;t read this list *smile*) don&#39;t give our class a very good<br/>
showing. They may not twist songs, or use their songs effectively. They<br/>
also may not have good weapons or have weak armor (examples would be a<br/>
L20 bard still wearing patchwork leather with some banded).<br/>
<br/>
Good example My level 9th Bard (with no twinking) is currently wearing 3<br/>
pieces of banded. a level 20 in PW is ridiculous.</div>
