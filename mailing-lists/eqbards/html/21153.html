LOL.  I&#39;m only laughing because, should you ever get bored, hop on over to<br/>
www.solusekro.org...<br/>
where we have TRIED to have such a system.  I agree that they can work<br/>
remarkably well most of the time, but on Sol Ro, well, lets just say things<br/>
have become less than friendly many a time.  Problem is there are SO many<br/>
guild that can do any plane that the reservation system would be 3 to 4<br/>
MONTHS in advance (and this is for weeknights).  Most guilds do tend to go<br/>
to a plane for a week though.  Our arguments usually are about one guild<br/>
&quot;stealing&quot; the plane from another.  Its REALLY fun! (sarcasm intended) :)<br/>

&gt; Some random PoF thoughts:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Innoruuk, we have a player based &quot;summit&quot; where the <br/>
&gt; &quot;major&quot; guilds met<br/>
&gt; and hashed out some basic rules and a reservation system for <br/>
&gt; PoF and PoH<br/>
&gt; (PoS is considered FFA [free for all] as are draggins.)  Guilds can<br/>
&gt; &quot;reserve&quot; 2 dates (16 hour slots) for planes and the others <br/>
&gt; respect their<br/>
&gt; times See www.innoruuk.com and follow the link to the summit <br/>
&gt; rules. There&#39;s<br/>
&gt; also a calendar there - you can see who has what booked when. <br/>
&gt;  Weeekends get<br/>
&gt; booked month&#39;s in advance. If a date is not booked, you and <br/>
&gt; your pals can<br/>
&gt; hop in and have a FFA night if you so desire.  This has <br/>
&gt; worked remarkably<br/>
&gt; well for us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last Friday, I heard through the grapevine that some folks <br/>
&gt; had a total wipe<br/>
&gt; out trying to break PoF at the south west wall (why they <br/>
&gt; chose sw - I have<br/>
&gt; no clue).  So, a bunch of our guild mustered forces and we <br/>
&gt; went in to break<br/>
&gt; the west wall and start them doing CR.  We had like 3 groups and were<br/>
&gt; cutting down mobs nicely when the server decided to lag out for a good<br/>
&gt; minute.  When it let up, we were all dead.  Heh, some of us were so<br/>
&gt; confident of the break that we did not bother to bind <br/>
&gt; anywhere close so it<br/>
&gt; took a bit for us to get back to the TV and hop on in <br/>
&gt; virtually naked.  We<br/>
&gt; looted down to res corpses and finished the break.  Then came the most<br/>
&gt; dangerous part: bringing the other guild&#39;s folks back in.  It <br/>
&gt; can be a real<br/>
&gt; nightmare when inexperienced people who you can&#39;t easily <br/>
&gt; communicate with<br/>
&gt; start running around in a panic.  Anyhow, we got them set and <br/>
&gt; gated on out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We got a couple higher level folks on our server who like to <br/>
&gt; brag about how<br/>
&gt; few ppl they can break PoF with. Well, whoopity do, when you <br/>
&gt; go in with 2<br/>
&gt; groups of high level pet casters and fight blue mobs til it <br/>
&gt; looks bad then<br/>
&gt; gate out to the TV, rinse repeat. And their story is always <br/>
&gt; the same: &quot;we<br/>
&gt; cleared PoF with 10 ppl, except for the Temple, CT & Dracho <br/>
&gt; and some misc<br/>
&gt; roamers far from where we were...&quot;  All I can say is:  &quot;we clear PoF<br/>
&gt; completely, kill Dracho, pull Temple w/o a sacrifical person, <br/>
&gt; kill CT and<br/>
&gt; are done by 1am on a weeknight.&quot;  Another guild has done it <br/>
&gt; in like 3 hours.<br/>
&gt; Having mid 50 to 60 level ppl makes all the difference.  When <br/>
&gt; we were capped<br/>
&gt; at 50, CT was dieing but it was 5am or later sometimes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I can see where Sartori is coming from, and while you may have taken<br/>
&gt; offense<br/>
&gt; &gt; to his response, you shouldn&#39;t have.  I&#39;m guessing here, but I think<br/>
&gt; Sartori<br/>
&gt; &gt; comes from a day when if you wanted to do fear, you had to break it<br/>
