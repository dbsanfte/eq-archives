<b>Subject:</b> Re: juggling justified <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-813525416">If you need to justify juggling (and I mean the &quot;if&quot; part - it&#39;s a game<br/>
people), then think of it like I do.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the following songs are magical.  <br/>
<br/>
Jyzan starts singing, &quot;If you&#39;re happy and you know it clap your hands!&quot;<br/>
*clap *clap*<br/>
<br/>
(You start to feel happy)<br/>
<br/>
Jyzan suddenly switches songs, &quot;You gotta FIGHT... for your RIGHT... to<br/>
PARTY!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(You still feel sort of happy, but know you&#39;re feeling boisterous, like<br/>
you want to party)<br/>
<br/>
Jyzan switches again, &quot;My baby takes the mornin&#39; train, he works from<br/>
nine to find and then!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(You&#39;re still sort of happy, though it&#39;s about to fade, you&#39;re still<br/>
feeling boisterous, but now you want to puke too)<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Jyzan</div>
