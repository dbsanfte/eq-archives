<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007789847">I&#39;d definitely agree on this point Lyrnia.  My druid after all has a base<br/>
strength that is only 10 points lower than his wisdom.  I sure will never<br/>
have the mana reserves of other druids, but I can melee far better than they<br/>
can.  The other druid in my guild was amazed to see me taking down low blues<br/>
with only a damage shield and snare.  He has to nuke the heck out of them or<br/>
he will get smacked.<br/>

Uhh actually depending on race putting points in strength is a valid<br/>
character creation strategy for a necro.  Some necro races are pathetically<br/>
weak and need to be boosted (depending on play style).<br/>
<br/>
ALSO:  Not everyone is about min/maxing their characters for &quot;optimal<br/>
performance&quot;.  Some of us are roleplayers who like to build a story around a<br/>
strangely strong, weak, stupid, clumsy character.  I created a rogue with<br/>
intentionally low dexterity just to have something to build a story line on.<br/>
<br/>
And, I would submit, putting stats into strength can never be considered<br/>
&quot;Bad&quot;.  It gives you more carrying capacity and the extra ATK you get from<br/>
it isn&#39;t bad either, everyone melees at lower levels, and some folks like to<br/>
get in and mix it up a little always, especially when soloing... which<br/>
necro&#39;s tend to do alot.<br/>
<br/>
Just because someone&#39;s style differs from yours doesn&#39;t make them &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>

Now you&#39;re just getting silly.  As Rokken said, there are some BARDS out<br/>
there that don&#39;t know that you can&#39;t twist invis with another song.  You<br/>
don&#39;t like what Gordon has to say sometimes, and on occasion he does stick<br/>
his foot in his mouth.  But that doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t know how to play<br/>
EQ.  He&#39;s been playing it a hell of a lot longer than you have, that I know<br/>
for a fact :)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &gt;FYI:  I&#39;ve known him, in game, since Beta 2.  He&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; &gt;nice guy, fun to hunt with and very knowledgeable<br/>
&gt; &gt;about his OWN class.  Just like we are.  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;blame him for not knowing bards.  He&#39;s a mouthpiece,<br/>
&gt; &gt;nothing more.  He had an idea, offered it up and was<br/>
&gt; &gt;wrong and admitted it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I mostly lurk here but I really feel that I do have to<br/>
&gt; comment here.  Remember Gordon is the guy who felt<br/>
&gt; that putting points into strength for his necro was a<br/>
&gt; valid character creation strategy...that IMO proves<br/>
&gt; his lack of understanding of how EQ works awfully<br/>
&gt; well.  My Bard is at a whopping level 8 yet because I<br/>
&gt; have 3 characters over level 30 I was able to see that<br/>
&gt; twisting invis wouldn&#39;t work.  I don&#39;t blame him for<br/>
&gt; not knowing Bards...I blame him for not knowing EQ as<br/>
&gt; a whole.<br/>
