 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to disagree with you, and go through our songs to show that they<br/>
are, on the whole, just as effective before as after 38, in many<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Buffings songs are givens: Chant of Battle, Warsong, Anthem replaced by<br/>
McVaxius, Celerity, Verses.  When nothing else to sing, boost stats.<br/>
<br/>
Jig of Vigor for that tired SK who can barely lift his 2h sword after<br/>
fighting 3 undead frogloks to finish the fourth.<br/>
<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s Locating Lyric for when you feel like helping younger players, and<br/>
for when corpses oddly vanish.<br/>
<br/>
Accelerando for travel.<br/>
<br/>
Hymn of Restoration I will often mix with Clarity at a ratio of 1:3<br/>
(counting messages).  A warrior who&#39;s only a bubble down on health,<br/>
sitting waiting for the next pull, or an enchanter who took a few hits, no<br/>
need to waste the cleric&#39;s (or druid/shaman&#39;s for that matter) hard-medded<br/>
mana when a few button pushes and a few seconds is all it takes (restoring<br/>
~50hp over the duration of 1 pulse).<br/>
<br/>
Lament for pulling.  Pool room Solusek B, I use it liberally to break up<br/>
spawns, to pull singles so I don&#39;t have to deal with needing crowd control<br/>
and instead can buff or debuff.<br/>
<br/>
Rhythms and psalms for resistances, damage shield is negligible.<br/>
<br/>
Charismatic Carillon to complete quests or raise/lower prices.<br/>
<br/>
Bellow lasted at most 8 levels for me.  Someone said long ago that there<br/>
will come a time in every bard&#39;s life they put bellow aside for a more<br/>
effective song.  Having heard that before reaching level 12, I was<br/>
strongly aware of just how ineffective the bardic kick becomes when<br/>
measured against what could be sung instead.<br/>
<br/>
Cataloging Libretto for the new quests.  Most recent use was to identify<br/>
which Rune of Ivy a guildmate had.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby I put aside for Pixie Strike for a few reasons.  Often I didn&#39;t<br/>
want the extra attention it gave, and the strike&#39;s mez lasted longer than<br/>
the lullaby&#39;s.  Yes, there is the given problem with false notification<br/>
(or perhaps now better termed unnotified failure), but even with it I can<br/>
always use this song effectively with 1 or 2 extra mobs.  My charisma is<br/>
base 146, and I always ask for a charisma buff from an enchanter or shaman<br/>
if present.  Now if there is an enchanter, they are of course the crowd<br/>
control diva, but just last night in the pool room, our puller (who was<br/>
challenged by the group cleric to get him OOM) brought in a Solusek<br/>
shaman, 2 or 3 greaters and the Noble.  By the time we had beaten down a<br/>
few, the enchanter called OOM, and I took over the job of mezzing till we<br/>
were down to 1.<br/>
<br/>
Aquatic Ayre I keep mem&#39;d as backup in Kedge.  It&#39;s not practical in a<br/>
group situation under most circumstances (there was this time hunting with<br/>
a mage in OOT, we hid offshore and this song allowed him to med up some<br/>
mana underwater, but that was a fairly unique situation), but can be<br/>
useful if exploring wherever underwater, or simply practicing swimming.<br/>
<br/>
Dischord, Chords of Dissonance and the Chant series have never played a<br/>
large role in my songbook.  Sure, I did the chords/discord thing back when<br/>
soloing Reavers gave experience, but the AE dots were put aside when crowd<br/>
control became more important, and the targetted dots don&#39;t give enough<br/>
oomph to be worthwhile in general.  That they can lower resistances makes<br/>
them good to carry in specific cases where your group has casters but<br/>
noone who can debuff (rather negative buff than simply remove buffs), but<br/>
then this has been the bard&#39;s job all along, to fill in the gaps.<br/>
<br/>
[Tangent: I always say that in a perfect world, the bard is superfluous,<br/>
but since perfection is rarely attainable in ad hoc groups, the bard<br/>
becomes useful.]<br/>
<br/>
Shauri&#39;s Clouding was useful to hide parties from trains in live side<br/>
lower guk, Unrest, Mistmoore, etc.  However at higher level camps, trains<br/>
either aren&#39;t an issue or can see through invis.  The song remains useful<br/>
on a personal level throughout.<br/>
<br/>
Largo&#39;s melodic binding is the most underappreciated song in our<br/>
repertoire.  Some fights are short enough not to warrant enchanter/shaman<br/>
slowdown, but weaving this in will reduce damage taken significantly.<br/>
Multiple mobs pulled?  Sing a little binding, give the enchanter time to<br/>
get his thralls placed with less chance for interruption.  No enchanter or<br/>
shaman in group?  Binding becomes the song du jour.<br/>
<br/>
In a similar vein, Chains can be used as speedown when no druid, ranger,<br/>
necro or SK are present.  Also quite useful when running after mobs who<br/>
the snarer forgot to snare.<br/>
<br/>
Mellifluous Motion is fun to play with people who don&#39;t know it&#39;s coming.<br/>
You should have heard the screaming when I accidentally hit this one<br/>
instead of hymn after a fight. -.-<br/>
<br/>
Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody I didn&#39;t have a use for before, and still<br/>
don&#39;t now, especially with Antimagic Aria (targetted cancel magic).  I&#39;ll<br/>
admit I haven&#39;t had much use for the Aria either, but I did like being<br/>
able to remove the Guise after I&#39;m done with it&#39;s ultravision effect.<br/>
<br/>
Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord is a godsend to all human bards.  You don&#39;t know<br/>
how dark Norrath can be if you&#39;ve never walked it as a naked human<br/>
(&quot;Follow the path?  What path?&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Screech.  Enough said.<br/>
<br/>
Song of the Sirens I gave up as a means of crowd control.  Sure it&#39;s nice<br/>
having one of the extra mobs on your side for ten seconds, but after that<br/>
it&#39;s all over you like Laffy Taffy in your cousin Amy&#39;s hair on a hot<br/>
Sunday family picnic.  Better to strike it out of commission altogether,<br/>
and save the charming for Giant excursions.<br/>
<br/>
Aria of Eagles, more fun than useful, although can make traversing<br/>
water/hilly zones less tedious/painful (avg Lavastorm trip for me deals<br/>
250 non-melee, sometimes up to 400 if I&#39;m lucky; once I overshot the wall<br/>
solB is on, and was rather grateful to spash down in the lava below as the<br/>
fall would have killed me :-).<br/>
<br/>
Clarity.  Staple, but don&#39;t let casters think it&#39;s better than it is.<br/>
Slowing the mob with binding or chains will have the tanks requiring less<br/>
healing, which is more effective than a pulse of mana.<br/>
<br/>
Solidarity of Vision to learn new areas via the puller&#39;s eyes.  It&#39;s<br/>
susceptible to the same bugs all bind sight spells are, but works well<br/>
enough in flattish areas.<br/>
<br/>
Dirge is somewhat of a joke.  My first test of it was on a Freeport guard,<br/>
it did a whopping 44 points of damage for 4.5 bubbles of mana.  Nice<br/>
thought, but impractical overall, especially when it takes up a rather<br/>
crucial song slot.<br/>
<br/>
Cassindra&#39;s Elegy for trade skills.  I for one am looking forward to my<br/>
next level. -.-<br/>
<br/>
My looking for a group shout varies, but often is something like:<br/>
<br/>
Enchanter/druid/shaman/ranger/warrior/wizard/paladin/shadowknight (aka<br/>
Bard) seeking ensemble.<br/>
<br/>
I hate reading about how weak we are, how this or that should be changed<br/>
or increased or whatever.  I knew my dodge cap when I took this job, I<br/>
knew I wouldn&#39;t be the meleer my friends are, heck I just broke 1000hp<br/>
base last level.  Sure a bard&#39;s job changes slightly as they level, but<br/>
it&#39;s the same as other classes.  Clerics in their teens nuke, enchanters<br/>
are always seen with pets trailing.<br/>
