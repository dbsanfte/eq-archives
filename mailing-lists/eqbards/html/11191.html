&gt; would be VERY surprised and impressed if a 50 druid, 44 necro, and 37 bard<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The two of them had held it on their own the night before, I was just<br/>
icing on the camp.  If you (speaking to the list) find a nice necro who<br/>
knows their class and enjoys grouping, hang on to them with everything you<br/>
got.  Necros are the most overpowered class in the game when it comes to<br/>
damage dealing, and can take down stuff at an insane rate.  Their 49 pet<br/>
can solo giants and lose maybe half health.<br/>
<br/>
Necros also have hp to mana spells which act over time (like 12hp to<br/>
12mana per pulse).  That paired with chloro and/or hymn makes for<br/>
impressively short downtime for such power.<br/>

Not that I&#39;m jealous, my job isn&#39;t to inflict damage, and my groupmates<br/>
know it well.<br/>

P.s.- Had my first experience last night where someone yelled at me to use<br/>
a weapon.  It&#39;s funny how people don&#39;t notice what&#39;s going on till they<br/>
disturb you, I had 2 of 4 frogs mez&#39;d (this in a pickup group), and was<br/>
sitting in the middle of them all taking little to no damage, then the<br/>
mage decides to AE nuke and I get beat down to 2 bubbles and everyone<br/>
tells me not to stand so close.  I was like Grrr.</div>
