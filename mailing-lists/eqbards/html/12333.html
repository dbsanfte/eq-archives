<div id="ygrps-yiv-20240275">Opalline earrings.  That price sounds about average.  Great earrings for<br/>
bards, also one of the few earrings that includes AC as one of its stats.  I<br/>
still wear mine at level 50.<br/>

I have no idea, though it seems to me Mithril trades better than<br/>
Lambent, but that is WAYYYYY beyond me...<br/>
<br/>
Your question reminded me of one I meant to ask.  I was offered these<br/>
earrings (I forgot the name) AC2 +5 CHA for 25 a piece.  I ended up<br/>
buying 2 for 40P.  DId I get hosed?  They seemed great to me, but so did<br/>
the crude stien, before I realized how easy it was to get...<br/>
