<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502135838">Well this may be down and dirty  but I did the quest on the Breastplate<br/>
like this. Like you, my faction with the Paladin Guild Master was zero<br/>
. So, as it worked out I could get the Pearl Container with my Erudite<br/>
Enchanter, and did the Odus Pearl thing for a while and still had not<br/>
got there ,  sssooooooo, I created a Erudite Paladin and got the<br/>
container from him. My partner that also wanted the breastplate went<br/>
down and killed the the diseased shark and my Pal looted it. The big<br/>
piece of shark meat is lore only but you have to kill the babies also<br/>
as you need 3 of them but they are lore no drop. We did this twice and<br/>
got our breasplates that we use only for dress occasions as they do<br/>
look good but the ac sucks. LOL We did t our way but it worked!!!<br/>
