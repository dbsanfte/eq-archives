<br/>
I was chitterchattering with someone on my server last night, and I<br/>
finally got to see a Writhing Staff in a trade window to investigate.<br/>
Nice weapon, but the fellow bard told me that unless you are level 28+,<br/>
the spell effect of the Writhing Staff won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm/deny/poke me ?<br/>

&gt;First off, *Drools over these excellent weapons!* and now for the<br/>
&gt;important<br/>
&gt;part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    The barbed leather whip you might wanna sell, because the dragoon<br/>
&gt;&lt;dirk<br/>
&gt;ad the Silvery axe and the Writhing staff all have better attack ratio&#39;s<br/>
&gt;than it.  and like I just said, the writhing staff and the Silvery axe<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;the same attack ratio&#39;s.  I know not the stats on the Mace, so I cannot<br/>
&gt;help<br/>
&gt;thee there.  personally I would have writhing staff in primary, and<br/>
&gt;silvery<br/>
&gt;axe in secondary :).&gt;<br/>
