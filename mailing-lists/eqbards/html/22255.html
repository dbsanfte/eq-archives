<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076324867">Hmmm that is a very interesting idea.<br/>
<br/>
My monk hubby and I can duo the Fire Giants (yes including Rokyl) quite<br/>
easily, we can also duo to Djarn and keep 10-12 imps cleared with just the<br/>
two of us...<br/>
<br/>
But it seems that if there are 3 or 4 that he takes more damage and it takes<br/>
longer to kill surprisingly.  This may just be an illusion though, don&#39;t see<br/>
why they would put coding like that in there.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [eqbards] Group composition effect on Damage?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s a question for the knowledgeable out there.  Our <br/>
&gt; guild&#39;s ogre warrior<br/>
&gt; has been tracking his average damage per hit for some time <br/>
&gt; now.  Apparently<br/>
&gt; if he is grouped with any group not including another <br/>
&gt; warrior, or a ranger,<br/>
&gt; or a rogue, or a monk, or a paladin, he inflicts 15% more damage on an<br/>
&gt; average per hit basis than he does when there is another one <br/>
&gt; of those types<br/>
&gt; in the group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t had a chance to check his numbers yet, but I did <br/>
&gt; observe that he<br/>
&gt; rarely hits for over 80 when grouped with myself and a <br/>
&gt; ranger.  When grouped<br/>
&gt; with just myself against the same mobs he often hit for over 80 and<br/>
&gt; sometimes even 100 without criticals.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anybody heard of anything like this before?<br/>
