<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] WOW, Huge improvements this patch... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-479725527">Lot&#39;s of good stuff including some things that have been broken since<br/>
release.  Now if we could just get some response on the bard song issues.  I<br/>
did notice that we are the only hybrid not to get a mana increase<br/>
apparently, wonder if that&#39;s true?  If the hybrid mana mod is just a toggle,<br/>
bet there&#39;s a whole slew of DDD&#39;s massacres tonight ;-)<br/>

<br/>
- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure<br/>
caster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more<br/>
mana, regardless of their stats.<br/>
<br/>
*Changes/Fixes*<br/>
<br/>
- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br/>
- Scaler recipe now works<br/>
- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br/>
- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than<br/>
pelts of quality.  This has been repaired.</div>
