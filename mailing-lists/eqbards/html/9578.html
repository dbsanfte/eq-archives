<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702253472">Anyone here play M59?  That had degrading armor and weapons.  Sure it was a<br/>
pain to get them repaired, but it wasn&#39;t anything too bad.  If you did lose<br/>
an item, it was simply because you never paid any attention to it&#39;s status.<br/>
If they did have a &quot;flag&quot; come up when the item in question was nearing it&#39;s<br/>
breaking point, I don&#39;t think it would be that much of a problem.  In M59,<br/>
most people carried around a spare weapon just in case their primary started<br/>
getting in rough shape.  Heck, you might even find yourself actually USING<br/>
one ofthose ubiquitous rusty, bronze, fine steel weapons from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
They could handle the &quot;repairs&quot; much like casting a spell on another person,<br/>
or using bind wounds.  You target the other player, click on &quot;repair&quot;, and<br/>
then everything in their inventory is repaired to full status.  In that<br/>
manner, the repairer would never actually handle your equipment, thereby<br/>
circumventing the whole &quot;trust&quot; factor.  How you would implement the skill<br/>
is an entirely different matter : is it a general purpose skill that<br/>
everyone could train, or would it be tied to an already existing skill<br/>
(smithing, tinkering, etc)?  It would be nice to be able to raise your<br/>
smithing skill just from doing repairs...<br/>
<br/>
Way off-topic : I amassed a fortune in M59 using the &quot;repair&quot; spell (I<br/>
believe it was called &quot;Mend&quot;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Even if it is possible to repair wear completely many if <br/>
&gt; not most people<br/>
&gt; &gt; will not do so.  Their items will deteriorate and will <br/>
&gt; break.  This is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact of life.  Car engines last immensely longer if you <br/>
&gt; change the oil every<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3000 miles religiously and yet I know many people who <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t.  Just because<br/>
&gt; &gt; wear can be prevented does not mean it will be, especially <br/>
&gt; if you have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; run all the way to a city to get it done.  Some people will <br/>
&gt; take excellent<br/>
&gt; &gt; care of their equipment, others will be too lazy or <br/>
&gt; forgetful to do so and<br/>
&gt; &gt; will suffer for it.  Unfortunate but true.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your car does not vanish if you forget to change the oil, just<br/>
&gt; the cost of future repairs is increased.  And by the time most<br/>
&gt; car engines start to wear out, most people are looking to buy<br/>
&gt; a new car anyway.  Once people realize their bladed thulian<br/>
&gt; claws could vanish on them in a blink of an eye, they will<br/>
&gt; repair it religiously.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, a system where weapon and armor effectiveness started to<br/>
&gt; degrade with wear and remembered a &quot;repair history&quot; that<br/>
&gt; affected wear rate, that might be something.  (And hopefully<br/>
&gt; figure out a way to avoid the way UO did it, where you had to<br/>
&gt; trust the smith doing the repairs and hand your equipment over<br/>
&gt; to him.)<br/>
