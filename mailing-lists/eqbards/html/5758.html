&gt; Well, with all of this talk about Screech lately, I decided to pull<br/>

&gt; Woohoo!  It&#39;s not toe-to-toe, but it&#39;s a lot more interesting than<br/>
&gt; running around in circles.  Now I just have to find the places where<br/>
&gt; these guys hang out by themselves.  Hmmm...maybe those cyclops in the<br/>
&gt; Rathe Mountains will want to play.<br/>

moving battle because of all the bumps in the terrain - it&#39;s<br/>
easy to lose sight of your target, or not see an bear or<br/>
cyclops until you&#39;re already in its aggro range.  I charmed a<br/>
cyclops there and had it fight another, and it was a royal<br/>
pain keeping out of range, staying away from other mobs, while<br/>
keeping the cyclops charmed.<br/>

Personally, I like the entrance to Unrest.  I just wait for a<br/>
train, then when everyone has zoned, just charm the stuff into<br/>
fighting each other.  Mortuary Fungi are the best because<br/>
their Mort Drowsy basically renders all melee mobs impotent -<br/>
even if your charm expires, the Mort Drowsy is still in effect<br/>
and the melee mobs will get few if any hits in on you before<br/>
you can recharm the Fungus.  Hags are good too, though a bit<br/>
difficult to control.<br/>
<br/>
I will have to play around more with Griffins and Giants, as<br/>
they tend to be in nice, flat terrain.<br/>
