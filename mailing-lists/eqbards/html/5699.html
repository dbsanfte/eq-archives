<div id="ygrps-yiv-274848681">Yes definitely, Warmly is as huge to the good as Ready to Attack is to the<br/>
bad, ie don&#39;t plan on getting out of either with any faction spell,<br/>
Threatening can be improved to Dubious making you no longer KOS, handy if<br/>
the Freeport Militia hates you as much as they do little o&#39;l me.  Who&#39;d a<br/>
thunk a testimony of truth would nearly get ya killed every time you walk<br/>
into the city.<br/>

&gt; as Indifferent, Apprehensive, or Dubious.  Not sure if Kindly is as 	big<br/>
&gt; a faction point range as Amiable, but I would guess it is the same.<br/>
<br/>
If my Squad Ring quest was any indication (every four warbeads<br/>
or belt you turn in is a faction increase), Kindly is smaller<br/>
or as big as Amiable, but Warmly is absolutely huge.<br/>
