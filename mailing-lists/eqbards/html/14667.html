<b>Subject:</b> Battle bard vs singing bard (was Does CHR affect Largos?) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-438505434">Call me stupid if I believe everything that GZ states, but IIRC someone<br/>
asked him this question a few months ago and he stated that the mind control<br/>
songs were the only ones affected directly by charisma (i.e. higher CHR<br/>
gives you a better chance of success).  In this one case I hope that he is<br/>
wrong and that CHR has an impact (other than frequency of missed notes) for<br/>
all of our songs that can affect mobs.  <br/>
<br/>
We should have two choices on how we play our bards: battle bard or singing<br/>
bard.  Battle bards can stock up on STR/AGI/DEX items to make them better in<br/>
combat at the expense of decreased song effectiveness (due to lower CHR).<br/>
If I want to be a singing bard with a 200 CHR, then all of my songs should<br/>
be more effective than a same level bard with a lower CHR.  My guess is this<br/>
was too hard to code so Verant took the easy way out and made all resists<br/>
primarily based on your level vs the mobs level.  A 25 bard with a 90 CHR<br/>
has the same chance of getting a Chains to stick on a mob as a 25 bard with<br/>
a 130 CHR.  If this is how the game works (and I don&#39;t know how we will ever<br/>
know unless we figure out a way to test it for ourselves, sure can&#39;t believe<br/>
whatever Verant tells us) then its truly disappointing IMO.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; impression higher CHR only increased our chance of success with mind<br/>
&gt; control<br/>
&gt; &gt; related songs like songs like Lullaby, Charm, Pixie and Fear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe a higher charisma makes stat changing songs more likely to<br/>
&gt; stick, those being the above mentioned, as well as Chains, Binding,<br/>
&gt; possibly Chords of Cessation, maybe Denon&#39;s Dissonance, definitely Lament,<br/>
&gt; and probably Syvelian&#39;s Antimagic Aria.<br/>
