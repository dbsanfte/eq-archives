<div id="ygrps-yiv-727705488">Yeah that&#39;s a good one.  You don&#39;t get to hit /quit or any other command.<br/>
You die before you zone in on your client as you zone in on the server for a<br/>
bit before you appear on the client side.  All you see is a never ending<br/>
stream of Loading...Please wait messages. No command bar, no reports of<br/>
damage, no view of Grobb, nothing, period.  And your supposed safe spot may<br/>
also be the real spot for a guard that&#39;s been trained temporarily elsewhere<br/>
which is worse if you don&#39;t know it.  He then returns to his spot every time<br/>
the server is reset, if he ever leaves it.  How do I know all this, there&#39;s<br/>
a lower level Kitasi on Solusek that was my first bard who listened to a<br/>
monk and got bound in Grobb.  Went from 12th to 9th before they lowered the<br/>
death penalty before I realized it wasn&#39;t some glitch and reset my computer.<br/>
Needless to say he hasn&#39;t seen any action since as I moved to a server where<br/>
I had friends who could bind.  Also only the time alive counts towards the<br/>
30seconds.  The time passing thru the Loading period doesn&#39;t so you die<br/>
however many times that guard can kill you before you react and cut the<br/>
connection plus the 30+ seconds of linkdead.<br/>

Also, there is no excuse for any player to die 20 times in a row in one of<br/>
these unfortunate instances. If you respawn and are immediately attacked by<br/>
a guard at your bind point, you need to use the /quit command. This<br/>
immediately exits you from the game without the 30 second camping wait. You<br/>
may need to wait a few minutes for that guard to return to his post before<br/>
reentering the game, or you may have to resort to moving the guard with a<br/>
mule character. Such are the dangers inherent in binding in enemy territory.<br/>
But again, that does not mean it&#39;s not feasible. Just dangerous. Everyone&#39;s<br/>
personal limit of danger varies.<br/>
