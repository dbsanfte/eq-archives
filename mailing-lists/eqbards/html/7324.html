<div id="ygrps-yiv-367653438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; For those of you in beta that saw the numeric adjustments, you know<br/>
&gt; what I mean.  In beta, if you kill a gnoll pup you got +1 to the<br/>
&gt; guards of qeynos.  However, if you killed a good guard you got -50<br/>
&gt; to the guards of qeynos.  You would have to kill 50 gnolls to make<br/>
&gt; up for one qeynos guard.  So factions vary in intensity everywhere,<br/>
&gt; which doesn&#39;t click with a lot of people.  They see one message, and<br/>
&gt; think they&#39;ve taken -1 or +1 hit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, it would be a bit out of &quot;character&quot; to have this, but I<br/>
think it would be very nice indeed if Verant would give you some<br/>
kind of level indication (other than the 5 or 6 &#39;general&#39; ideas)<br/>
as to where you stand with faction. As you said above, faction<br/>
plays an incredible amount into how you end up playing this game.<br/>
<br/>
For example, my high elf cleric mainly resides in Freeport<br/>
right now. I&#39;m dubious to the guards. I have no idea why. My wife<br/>
is the same race/class and she&#39;s indifferent. We&#39;ve always <br/>
travelled together and have done the same quests, killed the <br/>
same mob&#39;s, etc. My bard killed the spy in the FP bank once and<br/>
is now dubious to the militia as well. (Even though I&#39;ve<br/>
slaughtered orcs all around Norrath by the gabillions)<br/>
<br/>
And to top it off.. has anyone even found a way anymore,<br/>
short of killing the guards in North Freeport, to raise your<br/>
faction with the militia? I have yet to find a safe way to get<br/>
through the sewers in either West/East freeport to North<br/>
Freeport so if somehow I get to threateningly or ready to <br/>
slaughter - how do I get to my guild in N.Freeport? It&#39;d be a<br/>
shame to have to avoid Freeport for the rest of my character&#39;s<br/>
playing days since it happens to be the best place to practice<br/>
those ever so useless trade skills I maintain.. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
The Freeport Militia faction is too sensitive in my opinion.</div>
