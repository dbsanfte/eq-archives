&gt; Subject:	[eqbards] Warning about Accelerando<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From: John Kim &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kim@...">kim@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are mobs that can keep up with you with Accelerando<br/>
&gt; *with* a drum.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I (L18 bard) was visiting Surefall Glade for the first time.  <br/>
&gt; All the NPCs gladly told me about the poacher problems so I<br/>
&gt; happily jaunted into the caves to rid them of the poacher<br/>
&gt; scourge. All the bears were green and threatening to me, but<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t attack.  I finally ran across a huge bear - Mammoth -<br/>
&gt; who was yellow and threatening.  He immediately attacked me<br/>
&gt; (hey, thanks for the warning - real funny sending me on a<br/>
&gt; quest where the thing I&#39;m supposed to be protecting attacks<br/>
&gt; me).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mammoth is fast.  Very fast.  With Accelerando (my running<br/>
&gt; song) and a drum, I can (slowly) outrun druids and shamans<br/>
&gt; with Spirit of the Wolf.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t outrun Mammoth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He whacked me down to two bars of life (around 150/399, so<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not like I tried to outrun him for just a few seconds - I<br/>
&gt; was doing a pretty good imitation of the pod race scene in the<br/>
&gt; Phantom Menace going through those caves at warp speed for a<br/>
&gt; good 20-30 seconds), at which point I knew there was no way<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d survive a trip to the zone with Mammoth in tow.  I figured<br/>
&gt; my best chance was to jump off a ledge and hope I&#39;d land in<br/>
&gt; water, which I did, and which happened.  This was my first<br/>
&gt; time in Surefall so I was now completely lost, with a mad bear<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t outrun presumably pathfinding his way through the<br/>
&gt; twists and turns of the caves in the shortest possible<br/>
&gt; computer-generated route to decapitating me.  So I ran in any<br/>
&gt; old direction and ended up in a dead-end cave with a pool of<br/>
&gt; water.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not wanting to backtrack, I jumped in the water and swam.<br/>
&gt; There was a small underwater passage.  I figured the chances<br/>
&gt; that Mammoth, whom I&#39;d left far above, had somehow gotten<br/>
&gt; *below* me were slim, so I took the passage.  After a good<br/>
&gt; deal of swimming (my skill is around 85) I was about to start<br/>
&gt; drowning and realized this passage was not meant for mere<br/>
&gt; mortals.  Fortunately, I just happened to have the Aquatic<br/>
&gt; Ayre memorized, so I started it - end of drowning problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The underwater passage went on for a really really long time -<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d guess about 4-5 times the time it normally takes you to<br/>
&gt; start drowning.  Finally I saw light and popped up in a room<br/>
&gt; behind the waterfall.  I kicked in Accelerando again and got<br/>
&gt; the Hell out of Surefall.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t go in the caves unless you&#39;re a druid or ranger.  :-)<br/>
