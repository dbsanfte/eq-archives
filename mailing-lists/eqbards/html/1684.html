<div id="ygrps-yiv-770032438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am a lvl 22 bard on Bertox and I have begun to notice a severe imbalance<br/>

 </span></blockquote>	OK, from what you just said that seems to indicate you are a wood<br/>
elf also.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Medium sized bronze armor is almost impossible to come by (i myself have<br/>
&gt; NEVER seen any for sale) and<br/>
&gt; small bronze plate armor is relatively easy to get.  Other bards who are<br/>
&gt; able to wear the small bronze plate are much more viable at my level than<br/>
&gt; I,<br/>
&gt; simply because they have the ability to absorb more damage than I do with<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; banded mail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>	Why don&#39;t you just buy the small bronze plate armor instead of the<br/>
medium.  It weighs less than medium size and that is very important for<br/>
wood-elves since their starting strength is lower than human and half-elven<br/>
bards.  <br/>
<br/>
	My suggestion is moot if you are a human or half-elf bard but your<br/>
first statement led me to believe you were a wood-elf.<br/>
