 </span></blockquote>Well, I mostly play weekends, and I was out of town last weekend.  I&#39;m <br/>
still waiting for Ester to get back to us.  Still level 52, although I&#39;m <br/>
three bubbles in to it now.<br/>

Since I last posted about my lucky day in Hate three weeks ago, my best <br/>
friend ran me up to Hate last weekend, where Greaves dropped, then I went <br/>
to Hate this weekend and got Arms and Helm.  So I went from all blue to <br/>
complete yellow in five trips, with no duplicate drops of any sort!?!<br/>
<br/>
Add to that the Sarnak sword (of some sort) 12/24, which is, I think, <br/>
much better than my Ykesha for offhand (I have a Jade Mace for the <br/>
primary, embarrassingly enough), and it was a pretty nice weekend.  I&#39;m <br/>
at a loss now about how to improve, though.  :)  I&#39;m gonna have to start <br/>
researching capes and stuff.<br/>
