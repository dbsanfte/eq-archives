		SolB is so camped on E&#39;ci the line to get in starts in Nek<br/>
Forest.<br/>
<br/>
		Lower guk live-side is the place you wanna be, much less<br/>
camped.<br/>
<br/>
		I read these posts about clearing all the greater kobolds<br/>
and just<br/>
		chuckle.<br/>
<br/>
		If you can get in to SolB, and are able to pull more than 3<br/>
kobolds<br/>
		then go for it, I&#39;m sure the birthday man is right.<br/>
