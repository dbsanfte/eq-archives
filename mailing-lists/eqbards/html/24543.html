<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067743708"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My guild spent about 8 hours in Dru&#39;s room in HS this last <br/>
 </span></blockquote>weekend. I had (gut feel here, no tested numbers,) a 75% success rate <br/>
against the MOBs back there -- level 47-55.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just a quick off topic question:  Did you see DS respawn at all in <br/>
the 8 hours you were there?  I&#39;ve heard rumors that she has random <br/>
chance of respawning every 2 hours.. also that she&#39;s on an 8, 12, 24, <br/>
72 hour timer.  (I know 72 isn&#39;t the case, but I&#39;ve heard that <br/>
rumor :b)<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic:  Did your raid let you split her room with Lull?<br/>
<br/>
Grats again on 55. :)<br/>
