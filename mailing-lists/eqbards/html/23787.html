<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783742234">For me the EQ Kitasi is just an extension of an old D&D persona that has<br/>
already lived in several game worlds, notable Rolemaster, DragonRealms, EQ,<br/>
Asheron&#39;s Call (Very briefly), etc.  I imagine the wonder of new frontiers<br/>
will someday draw Kit onwards into new realms and though I will miss some of<br/>
EQ, Kitasi will live on.<br/>

Not overworked today.  :)<br/>

Please keep in mind that this is just a general (and possibly inaccurate)<br/>
observation made in the short amount of time it takes the screen to change<br/>
from the server select screen.<br/>
I&#39;m wondering when the last of us will be kicked off the last server?  Yeah,<br/>
I&#39;m sure EQ2, and Star Wars Galaxies, and Planetside, and whatever else will<br/>
be super, but I&#39;m having a hard time picturing myself saying, at anytime,<br/>
&quot;Well Atonal ole bud, it&#39;s been fun, but I&#39;m off to play something else<br/>
now.&quot;.  I mean, c&#39;mon!  The time invested, the character developed, the fun<br/>
had, the friends made, the equipment gained...</div>
