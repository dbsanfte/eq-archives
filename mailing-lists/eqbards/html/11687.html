<div id="ygrps-yiv-402744652">Funny, I was killing HG&#39;s in NK today and a monk (blue to me) ran right<br/>
up to the feet of the two fighting HG&#39;s. and, just as you said, they<br/>
uncharmed one immediatley started whacking him when my charm failed. I<br/>
was able to recharm the HG and pull the other off the monk, and he just<br/>
stood there watching, until it happenned again. Then I saw him fall, and<br/>
I though &quot;DANGIT, now he&#39;ll blame me for it (even though anyone who runs<br/>
up to 2 HGs and stands there deserves what&#39;s coming)&quot;. But after I<br/>
pulled the HG&#39;s away I saw him pop back up (doh! Feign Death). I was<br/>
able to kill my HG&#39;s in peace as he promptly ran away. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, just to add to the Lambent stone drop data: 3 griffons, 5 HG&#39;s<br/>
total of 3 lambent stone, all in about 2 hours.<br/>

&gt; couple giants and was doing my<br/>
&gt; thing.  I had killed one and had pulled the next, and they were beating on<br/>
&gt; each other happily, when I spot<br/>
&gt; a druid in wolf form heading toward them.  Oh great, I thought, someone to<br/>
&gt; come in and disrupt my chores.<br/>
&gt; Well, the druid moved closer and closer to the pair, finally stopping right<br/>
&gt; at their feet.  Well, wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; you know, the giant came un-charmed, and of course the one I hadn&#39;t charmed<br/>
&gt; started beating on him.  Chaos<br/>
&gt; ensued </span></blockquote></div>
