&gt;Basically they<br/>
&gt;seem to be a do nothing lot.  I&#39;ve had a little better luck on E&#39;ci, with<br/>
&gt;the exception of the guy who told me I was obviously a game hacker and not<br/>
&gt;to bother him anymore.  Glad to hear you are mostly re-equipped.<br/>

emailing<br/>
by top members of the guild (who evidently knew some of the Verant folks RL.<br/>
They<br/>
are game company, in the same (time and time again) -- and Kollos just about<br/>
quit because it took WEEKS to get settled, Solist finally reimbursed by<br/>
recreating. (I think it had gone beyond easy backup at that time) And that<br/>
was due to a game bug. so yeah. Sol Ro seems to be slow sometimes.</div>
