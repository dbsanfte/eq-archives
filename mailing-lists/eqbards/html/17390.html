Rogue pierce caps at 210<br/>
That&#39;s 2 levels of effectiveness better with a piercer<br/>
in your offhand than a slasher.  Also an EBW is more<br/>
effective in the main hand than offhand (from the<br/>
static level-based bonus) hence it makes more sense to<br/>
me for a warrior, ranger, bard to get it before a<br/>
Rogue.  Alternative example...your group loots a<br/>
Sharkbone Warhammer from kedge (8/26 1hb +5wis very<br/>
light weight) and the monk wants in on the random with<br/>
the cleric/druid/shamans...sure he can use it but its<br/>
worse than his hands by that level and just better<br/>
suited in a wis caster&#39;s hands.<br/>
