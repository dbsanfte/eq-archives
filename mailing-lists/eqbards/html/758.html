&gt; On the hopes of starting a new thread...<br/>

&gt; It was mentioned before, perhaps by Jyzan or someone else that in Beta<br/>
&gt; you could construct instruments from the pieces scattered througout the<br/>
&gt; lands.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never heard of anyone constructing an instrument, either now or in<br/>
beta.  It would seem that we are supposed to, what with the basic parts<br/>
laying about everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any gnomes on the list who know anything about tinkering? <br/>
That would seem the closest trade skill to one that might be used in<br/>
instrument making.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is though, that since the instrument parts were on vendors long<br/>
before trade skills were implemented, that this is simply a red herring<br/>
of sorts.<br/>
