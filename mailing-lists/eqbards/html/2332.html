<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116672324">We finally found a use for the seemingly-useless Melifluous Motion song! <br/>
 We were prowling around in Solusek&#39;s Eye, and one of the party members got <br/>
stuck between an urn and the wall, unable to move.  We tried levitating him <br/>
out; it didn&#39;t help.  While waiting for a GM to respond to the petition, <br/>
and discussing whether we should just group-teleport out and come back, <br/>
someone thought of the Melifluous Motion song.  The group wizard cast <br/>
levitate on me and the stuck player (since this urn was next to a deep pit <br/>
full of lava), we ungrouped and I grouped with just the stuck player, and I <br/>
sang a verse of the Motion song. Blink, and we&#39;re both elsewhere in the <br/>
room.  Unstuck!<br/>
