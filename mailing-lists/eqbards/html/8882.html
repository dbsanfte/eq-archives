&gt; Has anyone here killed deepwater goblins to get this helm?  If so, could you give me an idea of<br/>
&gt; the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -  What zone is best for this?  Oasis or Lake Rathe?<br/>
&gt; -  What level were the goblins, or was the party you were with?<br/>
&gt; -  Was there a particular type of goblin that dropped the helm?<br/>
&gt; -  How frequent a drop was the helm?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Zone - I got mine in the Oasis.  Probably best, as you can pull to near the South Ro for when<br/>
things<br/>
go wrong. (and they will. :) )<br/>
<br/>
Gobs were from 34-37 or so.  They hit hard - in the 80s, and are also have shamans (which<br/>
love to scourge you, nasty dot), and wizards who do their usual nuke-before-you-can-blink thing.<br/>
<br/>
My party was 3 bards, 30, 36 (me), and 38, a level 40-ish magician, and a level 50 druid and<br/>
ranger.  The ranger generally manged to pull just one, and the fights would go quick and easy -<br/>
druid and magician nuking, ranger meleeing, and us bards trying to look busy. :) 2 was a little<br/>
rougher, ranger would get beat up pretty badly.  3+, we got creamed, everyone zoned or died.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, the was a pretty disorganized, messy party, and a tight group could have done<br/>
it better, but those little gobbos are hard.<br/>
<br/>
I got my helm the first try, it took another dozen or so gobs to get the next one.<br/>
