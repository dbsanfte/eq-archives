<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425191205">I will disagree with you on allowing Dark elves to be bards.  Bards, for the<br/>
most part, tend to be of neutral (I&#39;ll use the word alignment as most people<br/>
can relate to this better than faction)  and are accepted almost in every<br/>
cultural environment (that is not to say in Norrath they are neutral, you<br/>
can select an evil god to worship).    Why?  All cultures enjoy music to an<br/>
extent.  So allowing Dark Elves to be bards, you are allowing them to be<br/>
accepted in each cultural area without the rigors of increasing your<br/>
faction. That is something else I disagree with in the game, allowing evil<br/>
races to improve their faction so drastically with the good races.  There<br/>
should be a limit as to how far you can improve your faction - my feelings<br/>
are we already have too man &#39;Drizzt&#39; in the game anyway.  Sorry I got off on<br/>
a tangent.  But if we are not going to limit them from being bards, why<br/>
limit them in anything?  Or any other race for that matter?  You used the<br/>
three large races as an example.  Sorry but any race that have intelligence<br/>
to cast spells like a shaman can WILL be able to play music.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
take someone of genius caliber.  Even the aborigines beat on drums for<br/>
different ceremonies, whether it be a wedding or war.  And what is the<br/>
definition of civilized in the game?  It depends on your race.   The elves<br/>
of Felwithe think all other races are inferior and uncivilized.   I&#39;ve never<br/>
really considered dark elves civilized, even though they live in a vast city<br/>
underground.  Their nature is more of chaotic mayhem than anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing, Bards LOVE their music.  My idea of a dark elf is they can<br/>
not love anything but themselves.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello all , <br/>
&gt; 	Its been a while since i&#39;ve posted on this list , but i&#39;ll just jump<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; right in.<br/>
&gt; 	<br/>
&gt; 1) I feel that dark elves should have the bard class open to them.  The<br/>
&gt; evil <br/>
&gt; races in themselves are very limited in the classes allowed to them. I<br/>
&gt; mean <br/>
&gt; whats really the big difference between ogres and trolls. yes they look <br/>
&gt; different , and yes they have different cultures and starting locations,<br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; what really seperates them from each other? what makes an ogre stand out<br/>
&gt; from <br/>
&gt; a troll ? nothing when it comes deep down to it.  Dark elves have more <br/>
&gt; classes open to them , but it still doesn&#39;t measure up to non evil races. <br/>
&gt; This is going to be a big thing on the upcoming race war server. <br/>
&gt; 	Now , why should dark elfs be bards. They are intelligent ,<br/>
&gt; civilized <br/>
&gt; ( evil but civilized) , and have a rich history. so they may sing evil<br/>
&gt; songs <br/>
&gt; , or chant drums to evil ceremonies. big deal, doesn&#39;t take away from the <br/>
&gt; fact that it is song , and it is history. Now why should dark elfs be<br/>
&gt; allowed <br/>
&gt; to be bards and not other races. Ok here goes Ogres- uncivilized and<br/>
&gt; stupid , <br/>
&gt; same as trolls. Gnomes , they&#39;re all into their gadgets and don&#39; seem to <br/>
&gt; impressed with song.  Barbarians and haflings - earthy barbarians i<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; exactly called civilized , their brains are bigger and their bodies are <br/>
&gt; smaller than trolls. but they still live in cold shacks in the ice and<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; that smart.  For them its pretty much the stronger you are the better. <br/>
&gt; halflings seem like a racethat is in touch with nature, , to be honest<br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t strike me as a race that would want to have bards. they seem<br/>
&gt; more <br/>
&gt; like a race that is in touch with their surroundings ( nature , animals)<br/>
&gt; than <br/>
&gt; they are with music and keeping history. Dwarves are all about work much<br/>
&gt; like <br/>
&gt; gnomes, they are a rugged gruff race. and heck they already have a bunch<br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; classes open to them. ( struggling a bit there )  In any case i&#39;m<br/>
&gt; interested <br/>
&gt; in seeing what others think of this , thats many why i posted it , so feel<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; free to disagree , and post it :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Also , i can&#39;t seem to find an effective way to twist bellow with <br/>
&gt; others songs. i&#39;ve been trying to twist with heal or chords.  but i know<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; the time i take to twist i could have already casted bellow twice. least <br/>
&gt; thats what it seems like. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	And as far as bards having the ability to be bound anywhere. I agree<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that it should be something like that. personally i feel most if not all <br/>
&gt; ahould be allowed to too. Of course if this was implemented i would it put<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; a certain way. This is my possible solutions . 1 - put in more specific<br/>
&gt; spots <br/>
&gt; that people can be bound at. not just the entrance to a dungeon or a city.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; but a certain house , or landmark or something where you can be bound.<br/>
&gt; Also <br/>
&gt; with this i would put level restrictions on it. when you get to a certain <br/>
&gt; level you can be bound at those spots , but not until then.  And as you <br/>
&gt; progress more bound areas become open to you. or perhaps once you<br/>
&gt; accompish a <br/>
&gt; certain task for a gate keeper at the area of the bound spot before he<br/>
&gt; lets <br/>
&gt; you in. something , anything is better than running 5 zones to get your <br/>
&gt; corpse back. I know its in an attempt at equality and in roleplaying. but<br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t much fun, and it is time consuming. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok if you&#39;ve made it this far - woohoo i&#39;m surprised <br/>
&gt; All replies are good replies - thanks<br/>
