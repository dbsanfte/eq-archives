&lt;&lt;If the graphics (or at least some of the graphics) for male chars were such<br/>
that they appealed to you, would you play a male char? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  And I have actually, though I&#39;ve never stuck to one as a main character.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have enough of having to be &quot;one of the boys&quot; at work :P  Since I RP<br/>
a lot, its easier and more relaxing for my main characters to match my sex.<br/>
 As<br/>
well, I&#39;m a mid-30&#39;s grey-haired professional and mother.  I am NOT going to <br/>
come home and find being a 16 year old male&#39;s wet dream relaxing :) :)  If its<br/>
my free time, then it should be MY fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
Really, the whole thing is about fantasy.  And there is a mismatch, either<br/>
way <br/>
you cut it:<br/>
<br/>
A: Lets say you want the graphics to look like a fantasy strip show (it is<br/>
a fantasy<br/>
game) -- OK .. the women do, the men don&#39;t ... I as a female loose on the<br/>
voyeur side.<br/>
<br/>
B: Lets say you want the graphics to look like functional fantasy<br/>
characters.  Well,<br/>
the male ones DO!  However, leather armor for a female Erudite Paladin is a<br/>
pink halter<br/>
top you couldn&#39;t even swim in w/o a serious &quot;pop out&quot; problem ... need I<br/>
say more.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, B is what we label &quot;sexist&quot;, but as a female CUSTOMER I&#39;d like<br/>
either &quot;beefcake&quot; <br/>
(and write off the female &quot;cheesecake&quot; as - its just fantasy graphics <br/>
and I&#39;m getting mine watching the men ;)), OR A choice in some graphics for<br/>
my female <br/>
warrior to actually look sleek, dangerous, and invincible .. see me and<br/>
FEAR me (rather <br/>
than HEH quit oggling my G-string&quot;). <br/>
 <br/>
As well, just a pet peeve here.  Lets say I *wanted* a female character to<br/>
dress and fight<br/>
with a vamp look.  Well, casters generally don&#39;t melee ... a caster vamp<br/>
FITS, a warrior<br/>
in a G-string is stupid (unless we all go option A).  But Nooooo  I get the<br/>
warrior in a <br/>
G-string, and the mage looks like Nancy Regan at a formal dinner!!!!  Aaaaa!<br/>
<br/>
I do think there is a significant female audience for these games.  I also<br/>
think the<br/>
game designers would do better to include thoughts to a female audience in<br/>
the design.<br/>
And NOT be eliminating the graphics that appeal to the teenage male (yes<br/>
they work), but<br/>
by adding a few choices allowing the female player to not &quot;spend 10 levels<br/>
trying to cover<br/>
her arse&quot;.  As a female who&#39;s played RPGs for 25+ years I would suspect<br/>
that I would<br/>
be dissatisfied with any game &quot;designed for women&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to thump those of you who are bashing the art director.<br/>
Like I said, as <br/>
a female, were I in her shoes, I would likely have made similar decisions<br/>
:)  Who knows,<br/>
maybe she is the reason barbarian males aren&#39;t tooooo bad nekkid.</div>
