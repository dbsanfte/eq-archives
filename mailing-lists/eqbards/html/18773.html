&gt; clerics, we get our asses beat on a lot playing our songs.  not as much as<br/>
&gt; we used to, and that is another huge point, and also why i think the AC is<br/>
&gt; fine on singing steel, i mean it&#39;s better than imbrued.  they vastly reduced<br/>
&gt; the taunt factor of our songs, and thus made the proc on a level 51+ weapon<br/>
&gt; and level 53 song much less useful.  and neither the symphonic harmony proc<br/>
&gt; nor the song of dawn can be reliably tested, so who is to say they work at<br/>
&gt; all?  also i don&#39;t think summon drink and summon drink are useful at levels<br/>
&gt; 51+.  i didn&#39;t get 53 levels to give my group food and water.  invisibility<br/>
&gt; for a warrior... incredibly useful!<br/>

party. Now that&#39;s an effect. Summon food and drink just show a complete<br/>
lack of imagination, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
I think the AC issue is mainly an annoyance because it&#39;s the same as<br/>
rangers. Dispite the moaning from rangers about how they are a tank and<br/>
need high AC, Verant obviously had something different in mind for them<br/>
or they wouldn&#39;t be a chain base class like rogues and shaman. Just like<br/>
Verant obviously had something different in mind for bards than the<br/>
travelling minstrel cliche or they wouldn&#39;t be duel wielding plate<br/>
wearers. Verant (Brad) already admitted they erred in making ranger<br/>
quest armor too high ac but it was too late to change it, but now they<br/>
are cutting the ac of bard&#39;s armor for no appearant reason, just like<br/>
bards were originally left off the list for black enamelled bp and the<br/>
original planes armor had comparatively lousy ac.<br/>
<br/>
I think whoever had the original vision for bards at Verant is long<br/>
gone, and there&#39;s no one to speak up when the remaining designers don&#39;t<br/>
stay consistant with that original vision.<br/>
