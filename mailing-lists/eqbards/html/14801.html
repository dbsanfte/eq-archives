<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333675184">pulling a lot of shadowmen for my wizard&#39;s mask quest, i noticed that you<br/>
can see them moving (as opposed to teleporting), but it is so fast it is<br/>
almost not noticeable.  i have not tried to outrun them with my selo&#39;s drum.<br/>
though it is quite fast (yes it is noticeable over a mm drum Scully, i mean<br/>
Harm) i don&#39;t think it is anywhere near shadowmen speed.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This reminds me, has any level 50 with a Selo&#39;s drum tried to outrun<br/>
&gt; &gt; shadowmen?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Dunno, I&#39;m convinced that the shadowmen don&#39;t actually move at a <br/>
&gt;   given speed, if they are in range of a player who irritates them<br/>
&gt;   they just kinda warp behind them.  When I feared one, it just poofed<br/>
&gt;   I never saw him again.  However, I&#39;ve not tried to toe to toe outrun<br/>
&gt;   one.  Then again I don&#39;t have a selo&#39;s drum.  Since accelerando is<br/>
&gt;   speed capped, I&#39;m not sure the difference between selo&#39;s and mm<br/>
&gt;   will be drastic.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>
