<div id="ygrps-yiv-257102396">This is definitely not true.  Just this week, I was bored and decided to try <br/>
to figure out how to use the lockpicks I had bought when I got the <br/>
lockpicking skill.   I just happened to be in West Commons, so I headed on <br/>
over to Befallen.  I finally discovered that you can pick ALL the Befallen <br/>
locks by holding the lockpick on your cursor and left-clicking on the door.  <br/>
I opened each door several times, never got a failure, but never got a skill <br/>
raise either.  I don&#39;t remember if I had trained several points into the <br/>
skill or not (I may have; I had a lot of training points to waste)<br/>
<br/>
About the Hole entrance rock thing;  I went along on a Hole raid around <br/>
level 40 (yeah, a little young, but you know how those caster&#39;s want their <br/>
crack song... hehe).  Apparently you might not even need the locked rock <br/>
picked as there is some space around it you may be able to swim through (of <br/>
course SOMEONE has to let the big races in).<br/>
<br/>
Interesting thing about the raid was that they brought along a few level 1-3 <br/>
rogues along to sneak/hide their way around for corpse recovery...  Worked <br/>
really well too!  =8^)<br/>
<br/>
Which brings up another question of mine...  It seemed that those level 1-3 <br/>
rogues worked wonders with Sneak/Hide.  Now, being level 1-3 they&#39;re <br/>
sneak/hide skills can&#39;t be all that high (unless like Iksars that are born <br/>
with Swimming skill of 100).  Now, how well does bard sneak/hide work <br/>
compared with level 3 rogues?  Is there some technique to using sneak/hide?  <br/>
I tried sneaking behind something in Kaesora the other day and the mob <br/>
immediately aggroed on me.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmmm... I thought I saw a patch message a while back about the locks in<br/>
&gt;Befallen being changed so you couldn&#39;t pick them anymore?<br/>
