<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974761644">Thanks for the info Jeff! I was mainly interested in the factions and drop<br/>
rate. This is for my DE wiz btw, not my bard. My evil cleric hubby talked me<br/>
into doing the Coldain Shawl quest and I will need high tailoring for that.<br/>
DE&#39;s don&#39;t get cultural tailoring so that left velious for the higher skill<br/>
levels. The fact that she may be able to make some pps while hunting is a<br/>
plus, maybe I can make a dent in the +5k pp deficit the trade skill work up<br/>
for this quest has cost me. One further question: you mention the Chief<br/>
being L60,  but about what level are the other dogs? I have yet to go get<br/>
the CS tooth for my wiz so haven&#39;t been able to con anything in CS. I&#39;m<br/>
trying to get non kos to dragons so I can start her Giant Bane spell quest<br/>
in the near future. Dwarvves already think &quot;you&#39;re one of the most highly<br/>
reguarded dark elves&quot;, lol!<br/>

Brilinia Iliside 48 wiz who&#39;s spent way too much time combining things<br/>
