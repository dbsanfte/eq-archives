<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014051618">&lt;That way he was about to do more damage than anyone<br/>
person who attacked it.  This point was driven home when we had a level 24<br/>
druid camping steal killing from my group (after I asked her to share the <br/>
spawns).  She would only cast three spells to steal kill.  Now my group in<br/>
total would have been ablet to do 600 damage in total(she did about 300<br/>
damage in total), yet she still got the kill from standing on the window<br/>
sill. &gt;<br/>
Too bad you didn&#39;t think to heal and buff the spawn til it killed her =o)~<br/>
