 </span></blockquote>Yes you can lull yellows and reds.  The success rate is much<br/>
worse than with blues though.  I&#39;ll have to see if I can get a<br/>
L32 enchanter friend together with a L19 bard friend so we can<br/>
do some lull/mesmerize tests on stuff yellow and red to the<br/>
bard.<br/>

It&#39;s amusing seeing how many wizards complain on the boards<br/>
that their battles are so short and their downtimes so long.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, the clerics I usually group with like to keep people<br/>
topped off as a matter of safety, which means they&#39;re wasting<br/>
mana doing healing I could do with my song.  So I&#39;ve started<br/>
healing with a lute near the end of a battle to beat them to<br/>
it.  :-)<br/>

&gt; dicey, you will often get hit, accelerondo is too fast to do it well,<br/>
&gt; regular running too slow.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have more than two speeds you know.  You can switch to<br/>
walking with Accelerando, or ducking, or both.  You can also<br/>
equip/unequip your drum.  There&#39;s a lot of tweaking you can do<br/>
to make yourself fast enough to outrun them, but slow enough<br/>
not to lose them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Okay, here is my last thought of the day, sorry, it is going to be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand what the point of making it bard/rogue only<br/>
is if anyone can use it for the illusion effect.  If they<br/>
required you to wear the item to get the effect (same for<br/>
JBoots), they wouldn&#39;t need to be no-drop (people were passing<br/>
them around the group so everyone could benefit from the<br/>
effect).  Sometimes I really have to wonder what the Verant<br/>
folks were thinking...<br/>
