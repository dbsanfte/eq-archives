<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247708574">Sorry for changing the subject, but I would like to see other people&#39;s<br/>
reaction on the &quot;new and improved&quot; bard hate.<br/>
------<br/>
That&#39;s not fun, I certainly agree with you.  Getting trained on by people<br/>
that don&#39;t know when to just stand and die from the consequences of their<br/>
actions is terribly aggrevating.<br/>
<br/>
However, that leads me to the second part of your post regarding bard<br/>
hatred.  My feeling is that hatred has been noticably reduced and here&#39;s one<br/>
of Crier&#39;s patented long-winded stories to bear me out:<br/>
<br/>
My guild was breaking Hate last night on Fennin Ro, my first time in a Plane<br/>
post-patch.  We had two guys in my group that had never been in Hate before<br/>
and needed some help getting to the larger group.  I warned the beforehand<br/>
that we were all probably going to die and that was ok, it was the price of<br/>
addmission.  Well, we gate in and I&#39;m first in (on analog modem no less) so<br/>
I stand there turning around helping textures to load and looking for mobs.<br/>
The other guys arrive and I take off out of the gate room for the zone wall,<br/>
leading them (no songs of course).  We come to a Kirukai (sp?) warrior and a<br/>
Cleric of Innoruuk that are blocking our path.  Death time.  The two mobs<br/>
both passed me close enough that I could smell their aftershave to chase my<br/>
level 46 Ranger friend around.  Then they start wailing on the others in my<br/>
group that are higher level than I am as I stand there watching.  Well after<br/>
a few rounds of not being hit I decided maybe I shouldn&#39;t just stand there<br/>
indefinitly waiting my turn for a dirtnap, so I darted out the door and up<br/>
the zone wall and camped out to clear their agro lists.  Nothing ever agrod<br/>
on me.  In fact by the time my camping process was at 15 seconds everyone<br/>
else in my party was dead.  The mobs didn&#39;t come for me.  That&#39;s pretty<br/>
unusual, but isn&#39;t conclusive.<br/>
<br/>
The entire evening that I was in Hate (until 5am this morning :-( when we<br/>
killed Innoruuk) I noticed that it seemed less likely that I was going to<br/>
get mob attention, and if I did get it I would simply stop attacking and<br/>
singing for a couple of rounds and the warriors could taunt it off of me.<br/>
This is something that seemed much more difficult for them to do before, but<br/>
again isn&#39;t conclusive.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, before going to Hate last night I spent about 4 hours in the<br/>
Lord room in lower guk.  So there I was, a bard with dual Ykeshas (one&#39;s a<br/>
loaner I was trying to replace), flowing black sash, Berserker Creshendo and<br/>
Niv&#39;s going.  Niv&#39;s even has a slight *healing* bonus, and yet a warrior 3<br/>
or 4 levels lower than me was routinely able to taunt frogs off of me.<br/>
That&#39;s not conclusive either, but it&#39;s very unusual in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, just maybe, bards work a bit better into a group now.<br/>

&gt; I love this place, went here on saturday with 2 guild mates (43 monk, 36<br/>
&gt; druid and me, 38 bard). In an hour we got a Crystalline blade, Zaharns<br/>
&gt; Coronet and I kill the scryer and got an Ice crystal staff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The incident that happened was when we was happily controlling<br/>
&gt; the spawn in<br/>
&gt; the king room when two low 30&#39;s people came along, decided to run down<br/>
&gt; through the doors and trained 2 Giants (we had killed the diplomat). After<br/>
&gt; killing both these people they came for me. I tried to make a runner but<br/>
&gt; only got to the flag room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was so angry, these 2 idiots came along and ruined my fun, luckily a<br/>
&gt; level 48 cleric was in Everfrost and agreed to res me for free (I still<br/>
&gt; gave him a serp bracer for his kindness). I was bound in Freeport<br/>
&gt; so didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; fancy running back to Perma from there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This also shows that bard song taunts have not been reduced, god knows how<br/>
&gt; but we was near the top of the king room and the giants killed the 2 guys<br/>
&gt; down near the King spawn and the giants still came for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enough of my rant, I got the exp back and am now level 39. Also<br/>
&gt; won roll on<br/>
&gt; Mithril Breastplate last night, on testing it I notice that when worn<br/>
&gt; compared to the Lambent BP it gives 8 less hp&#39;s and 2 less ac points than<br/>
&gt; Lambent but the +15 Agi is nice. I really like the look of the mithril<br/>
&gt; whilst in dark elf form too.<br/>
