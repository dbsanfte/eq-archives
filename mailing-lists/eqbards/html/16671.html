&gt; You&#39;re still using the song at that level for Haste effect?  I was under the<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a little confused now.  Aren&#39;t there already speedups that are nearly<br/>

Enchanter Celerity was a 30% reduction in delay.  Bard<br/>
Celerity was about a 15% reduction in delay, Beserkers was<br/>
about 17% at 48.<br/>

The speedups tend to be rather expensive for enchanters to<br/>
cast, and last about 5-10 minutes.  Buffing four tanks with<br/>
SLTW wipes out a bit more than half a typical enchanter&#39;s mana<br/>
(takes about 2-3 minutes to get it back with their own<br/>
Clarity).  Usually, most of them just stick with Augmentation<br/>
(15% reduction in delay) unless there&#39;s a big fight brewing.<br/>
<br/>
And like I explained, the double damage portion of the<br/>
proposed song more than made up for the short duration IMHO.<br/>
