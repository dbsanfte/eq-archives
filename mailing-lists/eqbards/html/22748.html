Or maybe the behavior for charmed players is NPC while charmed - I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen a charmed mob cast spells - but then again, come to think of it, I<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a casting mob charmed. Of course, I&#39;m only 17th<br/>
level, I&#39;ve never been charmed, and I believe there are many, many things I<br/>
have yet to see in EQ. :)<br/>
