<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660816376"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;2) my experience has shown that you can have invis and invis to undead at<br/>
&gt;the same time, although the order is important. I think you need to cast<br/>
&gt;invis first, then invis to undead. However, this was about 20 <br/>
&gt;levels ago, so things may have changed recently.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have tried it recently with my enchanter, in both orders.<br/>
The person I am casting on always says whatever the second spell<br/>
was -- its icon is up and the first has disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
This may be something they have changed.</div>
