<b>Subject:</b> Kerra ridge was... Infected Paw <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878164618">i agree kerra ridge has so much potential, but its just horrible, that zone<br/>
is just hilarious, some of my friends wanted a paw (damn druids)  and while<br/>
we were bored waiting for her to spawn, we would cause trains, just to<br/>
myself i looted 31 catpeople, and think about this, we&#39;re not aggro to them,<br/>
but think about a level 18 group trying to reach mitty. They&#39;d get their<br/>
butts kicked so bad.  You pull one cat at lower level and the whole place<br/>
comes.  They need to fix aggro range or pathing or linkage or whatever it<br/>
is, this zone is just horrible right now, and yet its a very cool zone<br/>

&gt; He should be as safe as ever in Q Hills.  I travel thru there regularly<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; was there last nite as well, no sign of unusual mobs.  Unlike Kithicor Q<br/>
&gt; Hills appears to have been a singular event.  What concerns me more is the<br/>
&gt; change to Paw and the trend you mentioned.  While its great for high level<br/>
&gt; characters, what are the people who aren&#39;t high level supposed to do?  My<br/>
&gt; guild has a whole group of six on its way to Paw now as its one of the few<br/>
&gt; uncrowded places perfect for their levels.  If they really want upgrade a<br/>
&gt; zone how about Kerra Isle?  It would be a month before word would even get<br/>
&gt; out most likely.<br/>

&gt; PS No more monks pulling apparently as Feign Death has now been nerfed to<br/>
&gt; near uselessness.  If you get back up any mobs that aggroed on you now<br/>
&gt; return to kill you.  Which means in the depths of a dungeon FD doesn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; squat as you still have to run just as far as soon as you get up cause the<br/>
&gt; monsters are coming back.  If you et one of those critters that stands<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; your body until it wanders away or is led away its even worse.<br/>

&gt; This rambles a bit, but I ain&#39;t had no coffee so bear with me:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, so Infected Paw is being upgraded.  Hell we all complained that IP was<br/>
&gt; too far from bind points for its designated level to be very useful, so<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; high time for a revamp there.  I&#39;m concerned, however.  Not so much about<br/>
&gt; IP<br/>
&gt; being upgraded as the general trend that we&#39;re seeing to make existing<br/>
&gt; zones<br/>
&gt; more and more difficult as the mean player base gains in level.  Kithicor,<br/>
&gt; for instance, has been raised to the point where level 50s can&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; assured<br/>
&gt; of traveling through the zone without dying.  From what I hear Qeynos<br/>
&gt; Hills<br/>
&gt; now spawns high 20s undead such as Skeletal Monks that will make quick<br/>
&gt; work<br/>
&gt; out of anyone traveling to/from Qeynos and Blackburrow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I met up with a friend who had just purchased and installed<br/>
&gt; EverQuest.  He started a warrior in Qeynos.  I&#39;m teaching an experienced<br/>
&gt; gamer, but complete EQ newbie things like &quot;don&#39;t kill wolves and bears<br/>
&gt; near<br/>
&gt; Holly and Cros Treewind&quot;, &quot;/con everything&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t be afraid to run&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;monsters can&#39;t follow you through zones&quot;, dmg/atk ratios, what is AC,<br/>
&gt; etc.,<br/>
&gt; etc.  I&#39;m not big on twinking so I didn&#39;t give him much.  A fine steel<br/>
&gt; sword<br/>
&gt; and 20pp for milk and muffins.  But is Qeynos Hills going to kick his ass?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What about Enchanters born on the East side of the world from Kithicor?<br/>
&gt; Their level 8 animation spell in in High Keep, as are bards level 16 songs<br/>
&gt; (some better because of Selo&#39;s, granted).  At level 8 a true EQ newbie has<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; very difficult time just finding out that his spell is *in* High Keep and<br/>
&gt; then making his way from Ak&#39;Anon or Freeport.  My god, now the obvious<br/>
&gt; route<br/>
&gt; takes him through Kithicor.  He might never have ever seen anything more<br/>
&gt; aggresive than a Young Kodiak or the odd Hill Giant.  The sad thing is<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; the Hill Giants that he&#39;s seen are *considerably* easier to kill than any<br/>
&gt; undead that he&#39;s going to run into in Kithicor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose what I&#39;m saying is that Verant is increasing the difficulty by<br/>
&gt; leaps and bounds of *existing* zones in order to compensate for the high<br/>
&gt; level player base.  This is detrimental to the true EQ newbies.  If *I*<br/>
&gt; started a Gnome Enchanter right now, I&#39;d know that I could invis (lvl 4<br/>
&gt; spell for them) and travel the boat to Freeport, EC, NRo, Oasis, SRo,<br/>
&gt; Innothule, Feerrott, Rathe Mts, SK, NK, WK, HH, HK if I really wanted to<br/>
&gt; avoid Kithicor.  OR get a high level escort during the day and save a<br/>
&gt; bunch<br/>
&gt; of time and zoning.  But a real newbie has no idea of what awaits him when<br/>
&gt; he zones from the tranquil WC in to Kith.  Mayhem, madness and swift death<br/>
&gt; and exp. loss.  What would *you* do if you had no friends in EQ and got<br/>
&gt; killed with one spell by an Undead Cleric somewhere between WC and the<br/>
&gt; Rivervale entrance?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most people on this list are experienced players.  Some of us are *very*<br/>
&gt; experienced players.  If we started new characters, even completely<br/>
&gt; untwinked, we would be able to avoid these things because we know the game<br/>
&gt; *so* well.  We take the depth of our knowledge for granted.  I remember<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; in late May when I first install EQ - do you remember when you first<br/>
&gt; installed it?  Remember how completely freakin&#39; lost you were?  Now put<br/>
&gt; Kithicor between you and something that you need as much as a level 8<br/>
&gt; enchanters needs Mircyl&#39;s Animation.  Say you&#39;re a level 6 bard in<br/>
&gt; Freeport<br/>
&gt; and hear &quot;Are you [interested] in delivering [mail]?&quot;, &quot;We need [mail]<br/>
&gt; delivered to [High Keep].  Are you [interested]?&quot;<br/>
