<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422334214">Combine instruments are slightly better than normal instruments -- for the price it&#39;s a good deal unless you have better.  sell-back price is around a plat tho so if you do any testing on your own, don&#39;t expect much P<br/>
Katta is a cool place.  undead spawn as you walk thru the graveyards tho -- they were green to me at 56 but they are not decaying skeletons either.  Some might have a tough time with them.<br/>
