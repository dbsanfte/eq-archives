<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156699458"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I gain so little exp in a group it isn&#39;t even funny. This is why I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;group, because the exp is AWFUL. Anyone else had the same experience? If<br/>
&gt;you haven&#39;t tried soloing, I suggest you try it. You may never want to go<br/>
&gt;back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The amount of xp that is possible to earn in a group is greater than as a<br/>
solo imo. That is, if the monsters are plentiful where you are fighting and<br/>
you are not waiting around to fight them. My favorite scenario is a full<br/>
group of six people with one person constantly bringing back monsters for<br/>
the group to fight. As a bard you can heal and generally keep the pace up<br/>
so everybody is constantly fighting. Some nights its just one large battle,<br/>
with at least one mob on us at all times. This is an absolute blast and the<br/>
experiance comes very quickly. If everybody is sitting around and waiting<br/>
to get to 100 percent mana or health all the time, then you are wasting a<br/>
lot of time. Try and keep the pace as fast as you can with out getting<br/>
anybody killed. A lot of times this goes on for an hour or more till we<br/>
pull one to many and we all have to sit out for a bit and recover. Course<br/>
with a bard this isnt very long, just enough time for everybody to enjoy<br/>
talking about what just happened and then its on to the next one. <br/>
<br/>
Soloing on the other hand means a lot of times you have to run or zone<br/>
because you JUST missed being able to finish the mob. In a full group this<br/>
rarely happens if everybody is playing their part and trading damage. I<br/>
think of the bard as a catalyst, we speed things up. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And my final point of the night: (And here&#39;s where I expect to work on my<br/>
&gt;&gt;dodge skill:) I think Bards should be denied Plate Mail.  Already I can<br/>
&gt;&gt;hear the Battle Bards winding up - but hear me out:  The Bard was never<br/>
&gt;&gt;intended to be a grunt-class.  The big burly types should be the ones<br/>
&gt;&gt;soaking the damage and such, not us.  Of course, before they make any<br/>
&gt;&gt;changes like this, they should also fix that tiny little bug that makes us<br/>
&gt;&gt;the primary target ALL the time :(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, i was gonna chew whoever wrote this ears off untill that last clause.<br/>
I would gladly trade my rubicite for not being the monster magnet :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;When I do group, I find one of my main selling points is &quot;I can&#39;t dish out<br/>
&gt;the damage, but I sure can take it&quot;. It seems to me that platemail is a<br/>
&gt;perfect way to counter-balance the relatively small amount of damage we can<br/>
&gt;do. Very few classes do less raw damage, but I can solo because even the<br/>
&gt;toughest creatures find it difficult to dent my bronze platemail. And in a<br/>
&gt;group, the combination of my platemail and ability to attract the attention<br/>
&gt;of the mobs, makes me a great tank, taking the damage whilst the<br/>
&gt;spellcasters dish it out. From a roleplay perspective (oddly necessary for<br/>
&gt;some of you)  . . . don&#39;t get an image of the Bard as some sort of<br/>
&gt;wandering weakling artist. Our skill may lie in singing, not fighting, but<br/>
&gt;we are strong surviving types. We are used to braving the dangers of the<br/>
&gt;wild, and can take a beating, as well we should.<br/>
