<div id="ygrps-yiv-655034480"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I can relate to this too.  Could it be that Hell levels dont exist <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Im in 45. This morning I got 2 blue bubbles in 45 in less then an <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hour and half.  And half of that time i spent screwing around dot <br/>
kiting and then headed to karnors into captain group with a full <br/>
group (all of which had many levels higher then me).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Minkin<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t play last night, so I can&#39;t add my own experiences, but the <br/>
way they&#39;re splitting experience now, the lowest level in the group <br/>
will level faster than the highest level in the group (especially if <br/>
there&#39;s a large level difference).<br/>
<br/>
Also, for every hybrid you add to your group (you&#39;re one, so that&#39;s a <br/>
huge bonus), you are now NOT sharing their 40% penalty.  A group of 6 <br/>
Hybrids would FLY compared to how they leveled pre-patch (it&#39;s all <br/>
relative, tho.. a group of 6 Hybrids will level at the same pace as a <br/>
group of 6 Clerics, for example).  And that&#39;s before the Group EXP <br/>
Bonus.  You will now NOT share the 10% penalty for INT Casters, 20% <br/>
for Monks, 20%? for Ogres, Trolls and Shaman.<br/>
<br/>
A Hybrid soloing will level 40% faster than he did pre-patch.  A <br/>
Druid soloing will level at the exact same pace.<br/>
<br/>
Hell levels still do exist (they didn&#39;t change the exp tables at <br/>
all), but you&#39;re moving so fast now they don&#39;t seem so bad.  <br/>
Hopefully, 59 will seem like 51 used to. :)<br/>
