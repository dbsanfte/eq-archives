&gt;Level 39: Invis to Undead (useful in Lower guk etc)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather have an upgrade to our charm song, allowing us to charm up to 49th <br/>
lvl mobs :)<br/>
A Fire Giant Warrior says, &quot;Guarding you O splended one&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Level 45: An upgraded Bellow/DD song (giving us better combat skills)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A group heal song that uses mana.  Have it convert all your mana into HP <br/>
(say 1 hp for each mana point) and devided amoung all party members.  By my <br/>
estimates I had a little less then 1000 mana at 45th with 90 int.  This <br/>
would give a reason for our class armor to have +int bonuses.  Given the <br/>
huge taunt factor of group heals this song would be fairly balanced<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Level 47: Summon Corpse song (like the necro one)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation is already slotted for this (info is in the <br/>
spdat.eff file.  Info Harmonic found from poking around:<br/>
Berserker Strength shows as HP Absorb Shield (this is what Niv&#39;s really is <br/>
btw)  [Protective Skin is mis-worded]  The shield is what I refer to as <br/>
&#39;Rune shielding&#39; after the Rune series.  Our new song is half as powerful as <br/>
the Berserker Strength shielding (Enchanter 20).  The Strength component is <br/>
slightly better than the Shaman L29   spell called Raging Strength.  The new <br/>
song has the same Strength component as the Berserker Strength (Enchanter <br/>
L20)<br/>
The Max HP component is close to 3/4&#39;s the component of the Cleric 9 Center <br/>
spell.<br/>
For all purposes, this new song resembles the Enchanter Berserker Strength <br/>
spell across all party members.<br/>
It has half the range of Selo&#39;s Accelerando, and slightly more range than <br/>
Hymn, and close to equal range of Chant of Battle.<br/>
the Healing aspect is identical in numerics  to Hymn.  However how  it is <br/>
applied will be a different story.  (It could have a very low fixed ceiling, <br/>
as could all the effects in this description)  I&#39;m not sure how level will <br/>
influence this song, but since it&#39;s L47 I doubt the effects will increase <br/>
much in 3 levels.  Just pure speculation and assumption on my part based on <br/>
the data file.<br/>
I&#39;d hate to say this is anything more than an educated guess.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a interesting song.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Level 49: Upgraded older song (such as charm) or a combo song (2 effects<br/>
&gt;such as hymm and clarity)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure what would be nice here.  The idea of a combo of Hymn of <br/>
restoration and Clarity sounds nice.   But I would hate to waste a high <br/>
level song slot on something so mundane.  Maybe have this be the group heal <br/>
song and have 45 be a Mem Blur song.<br/>
