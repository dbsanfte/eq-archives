<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519055402">At level 6, I had already priced my combine long sword in NK.  Could not<br/>
afford it but I had the speed to go take a look and see what I needed.<br/>
Also by 8 I had been back and forth a few times. I always bought every song<br/>
about as soon as I could.  What is the point of being a bard if you don&#39;t<br/>
have all of your songs?<br/>
<br/>
My first good sword was a short sword I bought off Olyvia Bladefinder (sp?)<br/>
in the cottage in West Karana. I think it was 4pp? That served me well and I<br/>
still have it in my bank.  Before that and even after, I used a giant snake<br/>
fang that I got in Blackburrow Paw from a giant snake who died a brave and<br/>
honorable death. Also, I managed to save the 3 or 4pp for the Mino Axe and<br/>
kept the best 1HB wep from my kills (BB gnolls prolly).  <br/>
<br/>
The lament song will be a good one for in about 2 more levels and then up.<br/>
It will help your groups pull singles from orc and derv camps - instead of<br/>
pulling the whole camp.  Well, most of the time it will!  Lament the lowest<br/>
cons and pull the higher ones.  Be ready to run becuz sometimes they will<br/>
all come!<br/>
<br/>
At your age you can be hunting the first and mid parts of BlackBurrow Paw.<br/>
If you have a good group, you should take them to Split Paw - a bit better<br/>
loot and less competition - just a bit further away and you don&#39;t want to<br/>
die there cuz of the long run.  By 15 to 18 - you should be cleaning Split<br/>
Paw out for Snake Skin armors.  <br/>

		I&#39;m a flat broke minstrel of the 8th verse bound to Qeynos<br/>
and I&#39;m wondering<br/>
		if it&#39;s worth my while to try to earn enough PP and make<br/>
trek back to<br/>
		Kelethin to purchase Kelin&#39;s Lament.  I can&#39;t recall any of<br/>
you more<br/>
		experienced folks posting anything about how Lament has<br/>
saved your life more<br/>
		times than you can remember or wow&#39;d your friends.  Should I<br/>
just start<br/>
		saving up for Elemental Rhythms?<br/>
<br/>
		Also, what&#39;s the next step up from rusty/splintered weapons<br/>
and is there<br/>
		anyplace a bard my age can go to where she may loot them?<br/>
<br/>
		Peace<br/>
