&gt;I think we are saying the same thing here - yes the bard gets the mob&#39;s<br/>
&gt;attention but it&#39;s because of the way mob ai works - they can sense who they<br/>
&gt;should kill and they see you as both dangerous to them and as easy to kill.<br/>
&gt;Because you are in the party that attacked one of their party - you get put<br/>
&gt;on their hate list.  All of them now hate you.  You are right it is a<br/>
&gt;programming thing but I think it&#39;s the way they want it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Part of this is seen when a party member gets bounced by a high level npc -<br/>
&gt;like brigand or a gryf.  Once one party member gets on a hate list all party<br/>
&gt;members are added especially if you are playing a song that is buffing them<br/>
&gt;or whatever.  So everyone has to zone to clear the hate list otherwise the<br/>
&gt;mob will come hunting all of the party members.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And I still think better tactics can mitigate your situation.  Don&#39;t pull<br/>
&gt;all of them (a cleric can lull some of them and you wont get 4 hitting on<br/>
&gt;you - only 2 :-) - I suppose your tanks don&#39;t mind because they can take all<br/>
&gt;of them no problemo but all of them will attack you if you are in their<br/>
&gt;sight.  Might be interesting to see just how far away you have to be before<br/>
&gt;they don&#39;t come to you instead of the tanks.  I know they will run around a<br/>
&gt;couple tanks if you are near but I wonder what would happen if you were<br/>
&gt;outside of the range where you can read the icons?  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone in your party have camo?  Does camo work if you are singing/playing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sylly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think you are failing to see my point..yes i know the ai is programmed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to go after the weaker members but these 2 went after me AFTER the tanks<br/>
had been pounding on them...also i have had this happen from mobs pulled<br/>
NOT from my party...I have looked for reasons why..me lower level? nope in<br/>
34 and they were 28..i low hp? nope full...race? nope they had a half<br/>
elf...faction?..did a double check after words same con for both of us..the<br/>
only thing i could find is they attacked simply because i was a bard<br/>

&gt;		&gt;The bard helps all of the party.  The mobs hate anyone<br/>
&gt;helping anyone they<br/>
&gt;		&gt;are fighting.  So, you are going to be number one on their<br/>
&gt;hit list.  Also,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;		&gt;So, the tanks will be fighting one mob while you will<br/>
&gt;		&gt;be fighting all of them.<br/>
&gt;		&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;		Had to post to this 1...it is not poor tactics that cause<br/>
&gt;this..it is<br/>
&gt;		something to do with the programming..I for 1 have not been<br/>
&gt;singing a<br/>
&gt;		single thing..standing aways behind my group..they pull<br/>
&gt;something ..3 or 4<br/>
&gt;		come...the tanks are bashing on it..i am still doing<br/>
&gt;nothing(just to test<br/>
&gt;		this) and sure enough 2 of the baddies decide to go pound on<br/>
&gt;me<br/>
&gt;		instead..also this wasnt faction related as the tanks had<br/>
&gt;far worse<br/>
&gt;		factions with the baddies than i did....as far as i can tell<br/>
&gt;there is some<br/>
&gt;		bard &#39;bug&#39; that sends baddies our way for no apparent<br/>
&gt;reason.<br/>
