<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760640353">We were told that Fufill&#39;s was improved a couple patches ago and not only<br/>
did I not notice any improvement whatsoever, the song, like many, is pretty<br/>
darn useless in doing what it is supposed to be doing.  Its a crappy DoT<br/>
that is rivaled by bellow in damage capacity and a crappy debuff that only<br/>
lasts like 2 ticks...bleh.  I don&#39;t see how it was improved to be honest.<br/>
Using a drum does not seem to have any added benefit.<br/>
<br/>
There could be one problem with your and my testing though, we are testing<br/>
it on ourselves and therefore under PvP conditions, right? Would that change<br/>
its affect somewhat?  I dunno it is all very perplexing.<br/>
<br/>
They need to get rid of the monkey who codes the &quot;fixes&quot; to our songs and<br/>
replace it with an orangutan<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh, I need some sleep!  Cranky today...<br/>

&gt; &quot;I came for the waters...&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I understand it Fufill&#39;s does 2 things - DoT (degrades hp) <br/>
&gt; and lowers MR.<br/>
&gt; I was misinformed about the drum ehancement working (an old <br/>
&gt; song sheet said<br/>
&gt; it did and gave data points.)  The part that degrades the hp <br/>
&gt; would be the<br/>
&gt; part that might not stack or cancel another caster&#39;s spell - <br/>
&gt; like darkness<br/>
&gt; which is a 2 part spell - I do believe DoT and slows them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess it is easy enough to find out what the effects are...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, just tested: cast on self hp dropped from 786 to 765 and <br/>
&gt; dropped MR from<br/>
&gt; 51 to 41.  No enhancement with a drum equipped.  So thats 21 <br/>
&gt; dmg on an even<br/>
&gt; con.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bellow on blue mobs is hitting at a max of 18. Less on higher cons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The MR seemed to recover on the second pulse. It was <br/>
&gt; recovered before the<br/>
&gt; red color on the hp cleared and while hp was still degrading.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, this tells me that it&#39;s use to lower MR would need to be <br/>
&gt; synchronized<br/>
&gt; with someone else casting on it. I was thinking that it would <br/>
&gt; degrade the<br/>
&gt; mob&#39;s MR and have a recovery period like hp.  But it seems <br/>
&gt; that the MR would<br/>
&gt; only maybe be degraded for the next pulse (tick?, round? <br/>
&gt; ugh!) so the next<br/>
&gt; song after Fulfils would benefit from the MR degrade.  Which <br/>
&gt; says that you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; want to weave it between each of the other target songs:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fufil&#39;s - sticks <br/>
&gt; (mr degrades)<br/>
&gt; Bellow (less chance of resist)  18 dmg<br/>
&gt; (mr recovers)<br/>
&gt; Chant or other party buff<br/>
&gt; (DoT is complete) 21 dmg<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; FuFil&#39;s - sticks<br/>
&gt; (mr degrades)<br/>
&gt; Largos (less chance of resist)<br/>
&gt; (mr recovers)<br/>
&gt; Chant or other party buff<br/>
&gt; (DoT is complete) 21 dmg<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fufil&#39;s - sticks<br/>
&gt; (mr degrades)<br/>
&gt; Chains (less chance of resist)<br/>
&gt; Chant or other party buff<br/>
&gt; (DoT is complete)  21 dmg<br/>
