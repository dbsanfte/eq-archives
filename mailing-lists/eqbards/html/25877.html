<div id="ygrps-yiv-229914787">Wow! Congratulations on your upcoming marriage :) <br/>
That was a very uplifting post actaully... nice to know the good things that<br/>
can come out of the game.<br/>
<br/>
As for myself, I am 32 and single.  I started playing EQ because all my<br/>
friends did and I was bored watchign TV while they stared at the screen.<br/>
Plus, everytime I actually pursuaded them to leave the house, the talk was<br/>
completely dominated by EQ.  So I joined em!  Well, I joined the game<br/>
because they wouldn&#39;t let me play with them initially.  <br/>
<br/>
And I agree, as much fun as I had with the role playing aspect at the<br/>
beginning of the game,  EQ is no longer about that - at least in my circles.<br/>
But I definitely enjoy the friendships I have made :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello. First of all, I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m a 31<br/>
year old woman and I&#39;ve been playing EQ for<br/>
nearly 2 1/2 years, ever since the original EQ<br/>
box with Firiona Vie beconed me into a world a<br/>
lot like &#39;Dungeons & Dragons&#39; but without all the<br/>
paperwork or trouble of looking for people to<br/>
play with. <br/>
<br/>
(Gasp!! I&#39;m a woman & I&#39;m interested in &quot;D&D&quot;<br/>
type games... whoa, wait a minute... my main is<br/>
also a warrior... I bet this guy would think this<br/>
says something about MY sexuality. Maybe I<br/>
secretly want to be a man... lol... I think<br/>
not!!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m one of those whacked out people who<br/>
actually met my significant other while playing<br/>
EQ!!!! We have been in a serious relationship for<br/>
a year and a half now and have even lived<br/>
together for over a year. I honestly believe we<br/>
have a healthy relationship and we plan to marry<br/>
this fall.<br/>
 <br/>
I do admit that when I first started playing this<br/>
game the social aspect of the game was very<br/>
appealing, at the time I was working over 60<br/>
hours a week and didn&#39;t have a very active social<br/>
life, but I definately wasn&#39;t origionally drawn<br/>
to the game for the social aspect. I was drawn to<br/>
the fantasy role-playing (laughs now after<br/>
playing for so long) aspect of it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as perverts are concerned, I&#39;ve met quite<br/>
a few myself, but over the years I&#39;ve found that<br/>
they are widely attracted to the more &#39;vocal&#39; or<br/>
boisterous female characters. I was a flirt<br/>
myself for a while until it started becoming a<br/>
nuisance... guys wanting my email or to set up a<br/>
chat room, some even requesting my phone<br/>
number!!! I just wanted to portray my character<br/>
(origionally) as a rough & tumble flirty warrior<br/>
woman - at the time, I was watching a lot of<br/>
Hercules & Xena episodes, lol! It didn&#39;t pay off.<br/>
<br/>
Really this game isn&#39;t much of a role-playing<br/>
game and it seems that people make more friends<br/>
and are bothered less if you just act yourself<br/>
and aren&#39;t too flashy in the way you act. The<br/>
majority of people I group with these days don&#39;t<br/>
even really chat much with each other. Sometimes<br/>
they&#39;ll talk about nice gear or zones they&#39;d like<br/>
to explore, with occaisional people mentioning<br/>
they need to leave to go to work or their time<br/>
zones... but theres really not any real<br/>
communication going on.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think I&#39;ve rambled on long enough and<br/>
actually lost my whole point of this long and<br/>
boring post! ROFL!! But the main thing is, I&#39;m<br/>
not a 20 - 24 year old man looking for cyber-sex<br/>
or game power! If I was, I&#39;d probably be level 60<br/>
already and fully outfitted in uber gear...lol<br/>
