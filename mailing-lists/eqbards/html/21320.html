<div id="ygrps-yiv-537316709">The only way your system would work is if you couldn&#39;t easily switch the PvP<br/>
off.  In other words, if you PK someone, then it should be a major pain in<br/>
the arse for you to revert back to PvP-.  And your victim should have ample<br/>
opportunity to track you down to try and get his stuff back.  Good idea<br/>
though.  Asheron&#39;s Call has such a system on their care bear servers but I<br/>
don&#39;t know how well it works.<br/>

<br/>
Even if the developer of Horizons does think he can make it all work,<br/>
IMO, he should still institute a switch, for those that don&#39;t want the<br/>
hassle of dealing with PvP. After all, if it&#39;s such a great system, then<br/>
most people would go PvP anyway. What would be wrong with letting people<br/>
have the choice.<br/>
