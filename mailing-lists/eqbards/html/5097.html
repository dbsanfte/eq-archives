&gt;The easiest and most sensible fix is to remove the z-axis code, and fix<br/>
&gt;spell casters so they can&#39;t cast any spells while levitating.  So they can<br/>
&gt;either float away from danger, or get down on the ground and attack, but<br/>
&gt;they can&#39;t have it both ways.<br/>

&gt;&gt;What about archers? &lt;&lt;<br/>

from action/reaction and tumble head over heels if he tried to shoot an<br/>
arrow when his feet weren&#39;t planted firmly on the ground.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What about PvP duels?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have any interest in them. &lt;g&gt;  But I would think it would make it<br/>
more fair if a spellcaster couldn&#39;t float over a warrior and blast him,<br/>
while the warrior vainly swings at the air.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If I were king....<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You would only be able to engage in melee combat while levitating (no<br/>
balance for archery, too much concentration for spellcasting)&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That makes sense to me!<br/>
