<b>Subject:</b> Mana song question <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268586022">I checked Rokenn&#39;s site before posting this question but just want to<br/>
confirm.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to 32d level, whenever I grouped with a 32+ bard they usually had a<br/>
lute equipped when playing the mana song after combat.  The song scroll says<br/>
singing only (same on Rokenn&#39;s site).  In the situations when I grouped with<br/>
a 32+ bard, I played heal song after combat so I know they weren&#39;t weaving<br/>
hymn in (a possible reason to have lute equipped).  I just assumed they<br/>
equipped lute because it gave back more mana than just singing.  <br/>
<br/>
So want to confirm if equipping a lute has any benefit when singing mana<br/>
song.  I assume it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
