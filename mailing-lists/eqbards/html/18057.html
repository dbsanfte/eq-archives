<div id="ygrps-yiv-293149500">Yeah, I remember Pong too... our neighbors had the first one in he area (for those youngsters out there, when Pong first came out, it was in it&#39;s own console, about as big as the original Atari&#39;s, but no spot for a cartidge because at that time, there were no other home vidoe games :oP  and we thought it was the $#!+ ).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I use the 1st person view when playing.  I may check out other views while running in a wide open area (like the Karana plains) or in an easy fight.  I use my keyboard for all movements, and to do most things.  I only use the mouse to target people/npcs when I can&#39;t use auto-target, and to switch between weapons/instruments.<br/>
