For 1st level characters to advance to 2nd here is a listing of <br/>
classes in experience order, lowest to highest. This is easy to test <br/>
for yourself, start a 1st level Warrior and count the number of <br/>
snakes it takes to get to 2nd, then do the same thing with a Bard <br/>
of the same race.<br/>
<br/>
1. Warrior, Rogue, Wisdom based characters all equally lowest.<br/>
2. Int based Characters approx 10% more kills needed to advance <br/>
to 2nd<br/>
3. Monks 20% more kills<br/>
4.  Ranger/Bard/Paladin/Shadowknight approx 30% more kills<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for different races requiring more xp, I have not seen any <br/>
evidence that this is true. I know the 1st to 2nd level test have been <br/>
tried on Enchanters of different races and they all required the <br/>
same xp to advance to 2nd level.<br/>
<br/>
I dont beleive that Bards of different races require different amounts <br/>
of xp to advance in levels.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I would love for somebody to test and prove me wrong  :-)<br/>
