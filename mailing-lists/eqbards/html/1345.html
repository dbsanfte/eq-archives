<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752979547">Hmm, possibly but I believe the song adds the target&#39;s faction to you, soif<br/>
you suddenly became a member of their faction wouldn&#39;t they all become<br/>
amiable since you are &#39;one of the boys&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
If so probably no effect on mobs without a faction<br/>

I&#39;d think that the reason for this is that it affects how that character&#39;s<br/>
associated faction views you, rather than how that character itself views<br/>
you.  It may have been a corner cut for the programmers, or it may have been<br/>
designed this way<br/>

- When you change one NPC to Amiable, all OTHERS of that type seem to change<br/>
as<br/>
well.  So if you change a dwarf merchant who was apprehensive toward you,<br/>
all<br/>
others in the same zone who were apprehensive seem to change as well.  (This<br/>
seems like a bug).<br/>
