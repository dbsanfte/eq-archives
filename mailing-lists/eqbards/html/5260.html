<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lowest price possible on medium steel <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-607584872">I had thought about trying to buy regular plate from someone upgrading to<br/>
rubicite or something else, and I realized that the resale value, to a<br/>
vendor, is very high.  I believe it&#39;s not too far distant from the buying<br/>
price.  I suppose someone may unload at a lesser cost because they are<br/>
encumbered heavily, at the source of the new armor, but I figured it was a<br/>
long shot at best and decided to just wait until I could buy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the breatplate for low 800&#39;s.   That&#39;s with Cha 113 and<br/>
Charismatic Charillion to Amiable.  Faction seems to play a MUCH higher role<br/>
than Cha... My base is 90 from which I compare it to.<br/>

&gt;i created a gnome enchanter with max charisma and bought all my small steel<br/>
&gt;at the lowest possible prices in akanon.  i assume the same would be for a<br/>
&gt;human enchanter with max charisma in freeport or a high elf enchanter in<br/>

&gt;It is my knowledge that steel plate can only be bought from vendors<br/>
&gt;generally (unless someone is upgrading and wishes to sell their old plate,<br/>
&gt;right??) I was just wondering what the minimun price would be for medium<br/>
&gt;steel plate, and what charisma/faction it takes for that??<br/>
