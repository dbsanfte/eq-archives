something more to this whole invis thing.  I&#39;ve been aggroed<br/>
on by a shin knight in LGuk that I specifically /conned as<br/>
indifferent due to my invis before walking through him.  <br/>
That&#39;s why I said I think there&#39;s a faction thing tied in with<br/>
all this.  I also had a similar experience with some red mobs<br/>
long ago (don&#39;t remember the details).  They were ready to<br/>
attack while I was visible, and ready to attack while I was<br/>
invisible.  I played Carrilon, which took me to threatening or<br/>
dubious while visible.  I then made myself invisible, and<br/>
suddenly they were indifferent.<br/>
