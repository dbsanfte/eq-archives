&gt; Last night I was camping the Preacher room in Permafrost with a 23rd Wizard, a<br/>
&gt; 22nd Wizard, a 22nd Cleric, and a 19th bard.  I&#39;m pretty damn young to be<br/>
&gt; there, as those are hard-hitting Ice Goblins and heavy casters that we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; fighting.  We held our own there for about five hours - with me mostly using<br/>
&gt; instruments and not weapons - in fact we were TANKLESS.  We got a tell at<br/>
&gt; about the four hour mark from two Warriors wanting to join our group - and we<br/>
&gt; declined!  I routinely pulled Gobs from the surrounding area when mana<br/>
&gt; permitted as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From a pure experience/time perspective, it is always better<br/>
to have more people in your group.  This is especially true as<br/>
a bard since your party songs multiply every person&#39;s<br/>
effectiveness.  The only time I turn down adding more people<br/>
to a group is if they are known jerks, or if the spawn in the<br/>
area will not support the extra people (i.e. there is nothing <br/>
else nearby and we are already handling what&#39;s there with<br/>
ease).<br/>
<br/>
If this was not the case, then I can only assume you felt the<br/>
group&#39;s increased effectiveness with two tanks would not<br/>
offset the decrease in experience.  I&#39;d suggest you improve<br/>
your mixed tank/caster strategies then - the only remaining<br/>
factor is poor tactics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If heavy casters were in the pull (and they throw Force<br/>
&gt; Shock and the like) I would switch to button bank 2 (my<br/>
&gt; &quot;caster&quot; bank) and play Anthem, Guardian and Elemental<br/>
&gt; while holding a drum.  Anthem was played because my cleric<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought Anthem no longer stacked with Guardian Rhythms?  Or<br/>
maybe it was Chant of Battle that didn&#39;t stack with GR...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was melee&#39;ing fairly often as was one of the Wizards, so<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s better than nothing. Our magic resists with the drum<br/>
&gt; equipped were in the low 70s, and 40ish for heat and cold.  <br/>
&gt; Not shabby, but can I do better at my level without a MM<br/>
&gt; drum? Any stacking advice would be welcome.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s tough to appraise the effectiveness of MR against casting<br/>
mobs because you don&#39;t get a message saying how much damage<br/>
their spells did.  The strategy I found worked best when I was<br/>
in Permafrost was just to play Lullaby over and over (stop and<br/>
restart it each time it pulses to minimize the interval).  <br/>
That interrupted almost every spell, and the goblins went down<br/>
usually getting only 0 or 1 spell off, sometimes 2.  I dunno<br/>
how viable this strategy is at level 19 though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I didn&#39;t play<br/>
&gt; Hymn much fighting the casters &#39;cause .. what&#39;s the point?  <br/>
&gt; They&#39;re either gonna burn you for 150 points or not, and<br/>
&gt; Hymn isn&#39;t going to help much since my drum is equipped.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Set up a hotkey bank with four songs, your instrument melee<br/>
slot, and an instrument inventory slot.  Put the drum in the<br/>
melee slot and pick up the lute with your mouse cursor.  Play<br/>
ER, then GR.  When you switch to Hymn, click on the drum to<br/>
equip the lute and place the drum on the mouse cursor.  When<br/>
you switch back to ER, click on the lute to equip the drum<br/>
again.  (The instrument inventory slot isn&#39;t really necessary,<br/>
but I found it handy in case I needed to drop my rather<br/>
valuable Mistmoore drum to pick up something else.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
This also works with Hymn (lute), CoD (lute), and DDD (horn).<br/>
Each song gets enhanced by its respective instrument, and it&#39;s<br/>
not that much more difficult to do.  It&#39;s still a hassle<br/>
though and I only set it up occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Besides, we had a Cleric in the group (she saved my bacon<br/>
&gt; when down to 30HPs on about three different occassions).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Clerics are a bard&#39;s best friend.  Don&#39;t grow too dependent on<br/>
them though.  Once you get into your low- to mid-20s, you are<br/>
no longer the enormous mob magnet you used to be, and with<br/>
careful damage management, you can do pretty well grouped<br/>
without a cleric.  It requires different songs, good taunt<br/>
coordination with the other group members, everyone has to<br/>
know what the others are and are not capable of, and you<br/>
really have to stay on your toes.  But it&#39;s a lot of fun, and<br/>
what you learn while doing it will kick in automatically when<br/>
you *are* grouped with a cleric and he announces &quot;OOM&quot; in the<br/>
middle of a nasty fight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If there were no casters involved I would switch to button<br/>
&gt; bank 1 (my &quot;melee&quot; bank) and play Warsong, Anthem and Hymn<br/>
&gt; of Restoration.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were doing most of the tanking, then Warsong probably<br/>
was appropriate.  If the others are taking damage though, I&#39;d<br/>
consider using GR instead of Warsong.  It has a slight AC buff<br/>
(bigger than ER or PR) which is mostly negligible, but can<br/>
make a difference in marginal situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In appropriate situations I can also use<br/>
&gt; Bellow or Denon&#39;s Distruptive Discord on this bank, but<br/>
&gt; Bellow is pretty pathetic when you&#39;re fighting multiple<br/>
&gt; mobs and DDD can really get you in trouble in a dungeon<br/>
&gt; where you can&#39;t even use Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you are the lowest level member of a group, you should<br/>
concentrate more on party buff songs (which can&#39;t be resisted)<br/>
rather than offensive songs (which can be resisted).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lullaby was also used a fair amount and the Gobs didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; resist TOO much.  I would equip my mandolin and just stand<br/>
&gt; there playing Lullable while the casters burned the gobs<br/>
&gt; or beat on them with sticks.  Usually during this type of<br/>
&gt; cheezy caster melee combat I was typing &quot;Fight one&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Fight one&quot; over and over.  It takes some people a long<br/>
&gt; time to realize what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it&#39;s amazing how little people think when they aren&#39;t<br/>
the ones taking all the damage.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious if you found any basis for the claim that Lullaby<br/>
nixes the hate list.  Whenever I&#39;m grouped with overzealous<br/>
nukers, I haven&#39;t been able to use Lullaby to pull a mob off<br/>
them.  It goes to sleep, but when it wakes up it just resumes<br/>
chasing the nuker.  Finally after about 5 or 6 pulses of<br/>
Lullaby it starts to attack me, but then the caster nukes<br/>
again and the whole thing starts all over.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For reference, when in melee my weapons are Dragoon Dirk or Barbed Leather<br/>
&gt; Whip in the offhand with Thulian Bladed Claws in my primary hand.  This<br/>
&gt; character is *not* twinked believe it or not...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bleh - a non-twinked L20 bard has better weapons than I do.  <br/>
I need to get better weapons.  Doesn&#39;t help that my friends<br/>
and I aren&#39;t into camping...<br/>
