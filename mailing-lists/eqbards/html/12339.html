<div id="ygrps-yiv-918675385">I concur with your findings - hell levels tend to insulate you from death<br/>
penalties and getting killed by a red is less xp loss than dying to a blue<br/>
or green.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW:  got sucked into a Paladin&#39;s quest last nite.  Go to Erud&#39;s Crossing<br/>
and kill some damn fish. Ok, quest fishie hangs out with Killer Shark&#39;s -<br/>
ugh.  Playing a just 27 wiz, I killed the Plague Shark by chain casting my<br/>
big nuke but agro&#39;d the Killer who snarfed me.  Got snarfed 2 times and lost<br/>
a half of a bub and then some (lost my level too.)  P.o.&#39;d, I camped him to<br/>
get Sylly (40 bardette) and brought her over for CR and what have you.<br/>
Somehow she managed to get killed too but thankfully showed _very_ minimal<br/>
XP loss.  This is due I do believe to both being in a Hell level _and_ by<br/>
getting killed by a red (I was told Killer Sharks are 45 mobs - and if they<br/>
are how come the Planes players don&#39;t camp em for rebuilding xp? Ya, ya<br/>
fighting underwater is hard.)<br/>
<br/>
So, while it&#39;s hard to gain XP in a Hell Level - it seems that each time you<br/>
are killed - there is less loss than in other levels.  FYI - I have heard<br/>
that the Hell plus One levels are one-bub death penaltys for each time you<br/>
die - maybe only 46?  Or 41 and 46?  I don&#39;t remember 31 nor 36 to be<br/>
particularily bard - well, 31 was cuz I wanted 32 so badly.<br/>

		Subjectively, it appears to me that the experience penalty<br/>
for<br/>
		dying is higher when something kills you that cons<br/>
green/blue to you versus<br/>
		something killing you that cons yellow/red.  Anyone else had<br/>
similar<br/>
		results?<br/>
