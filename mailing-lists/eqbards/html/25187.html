<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983538305">Sounds really good - I&#39;d be very interested - and I&#39;m sure we could get some<br/>
other DoK&#39;s to help.  My main issue is my schedule is pretty tight as I work<br/>
as a professional musician - I&#39;m pretty much only consistently available on<br/>
Sunday and Monday nights, and most Friday nights, and Saturday days.<br/>
<br/>
If we can make this a go - let me know your ezboard&#39;s URL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Tzeetch, Slyde, I was looking for you guys last night. I see why I didn&#39;t<br/>
find Tzeetch, I could not recall how to spelll the name! Anyways, I was<br/>
talking to Kaas about doing the undead bard/Trak. Seems that his guild,<br/>
Death Knights has a falling out with SoA (I haven&#39;t heard the dirt yet) and<br/>
so they can&#39;t field enough folks to finish his epic. We were talking about<br/>
guilds and people that he can talk to about helping do his last step. It<br/>
dawned on me that he is pretty much in the same boat you guys are talking<br/>
about being in. So my question is, would it be possible for the guilds you<br/>
guys are in to get involved? I&#39;m thinking we would end up with some DK&#39;s,<br/>
some Muffins, some Marauders of the Dragon and probably some of my bunch,<br/>
Venator Sapentia. I&#39;m sure Kaas&#39;s bunch would agree to help you guys do<br/>
Gore. Now granted, there&#39;s alot of luck involved. The day/time you catch<br/>
Gore or the undead bard or whatever red dragon up may not be the day<br/>
everyone is on or is free to drop whatever. I would have liked to go do Trak<br/>
for Kaas last night if the bard was up but was committed to helping Annelia<br/>
and Sybian in Fear with their epics. This has more to do with meeting more<br/>
people of the right level and mindset as a start. I&#39;d like to see all the<br/>
bards I know get their epics and I will help whenever I can. We can<br/>
coordinate via our ezboard if you like. I told Kaas to go start a thread on<br/>
our general board but don&#39;t see it yet. What do you guys think?<br/>
