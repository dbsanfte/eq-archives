<div id="ygrps-yiv-510311415">Well, last night, after months of not even trying to work on it, I finished my<br/>
Singing Short Sword quest. :)  A guild-mate won a scale on  a Vox raid a couple<br/>
weeks ago, and that was the turning point for me.  We had I think 9 consecutive<br/>
Vox kills with only 1 white scale dropped.  It&#39;s been rough on MM ;p.<br/>
<br/>
My guild, Deadly Virtues, took the spawned Trakanon down with no problems; our<br/>
first Trak kill (like may other servers, it&#39;s difficult to find him up to<br/>
kill!).  We had deaths, but learned a lot so that next time will be much<br/>
easier.<br/>
 <br/>
I am thrilled with the sword!  I think that the effort for our epic is<br/>
proportional to its quality.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share this with you all, with a hearty &#39;Thank you&#39; because so much<br/>
work has been done by the community, of which we are all a part.<br/>
