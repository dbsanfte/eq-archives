Hehe - man I need to learn not to respond to the list before my first cup of<br/>
coffee in the morning...<br/>
<br/>
I like the Spit Valve of Doom - and there will be different values - a<br/>
trumpet gives smallest affect while a tuba the biggest!<br/>
<br/>
BTW - not to get into another debate on mino horns - but the trombone is a<br/>
Brass Inst not a Wind Inst.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I think there should be Wind Instrument &quot;Sax of Gorelick&quot; which has a<br/>
negative affect on all wind songs EXCEPT mez songs - in which case the mez<br/>
is never resisted and has an indefinite duration...<br/>

That&#39;s ok, to make it up to Slyde, Verant has included in this patch a<br/>
trombone. It enhances wind songs and they&#39;ve added a special disorienting<br/>
attack called &quot;Spit Valve of Doom&quot; which causes all mobs that chase a bard<br/>
to slip and slide.<br/>

&gt;Actually the reason for the deaths had nothing to do with aria. It was<br/>
&gt;part of a series of &quot;fixes&quot; to prevent chain and over casting that broke<br/>
&gt;bards.  All bard songs were effected Aria was the only one that got people<br/>
&gt;killed.  No bard songs would refresh so you got one pulse had to stop the<br/>
&gt;song and then had to restart it.  Aria at the time had about 4 seconds of<br/>
&gt;duration beyond the pulse just enough to get you out of safty and into a<br/>
&gt;long drop :)<br/>
&gt;The next batch which fixed that problem then made it that weapons would<br/>
&gt;not proc while bard song was active.  That took them about a week or so to<br/>
&gt;fix.  The lists go on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Our Aria still will allow us to gain altitude and so does caster<br/>
&gt;recasting.  However there is now a &quot;glass celling&quot; that dictates how high<br/>
&gt;you can go in a specific area.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Similarly - they made a change to speed where Drums didn&#39;t add to the<br/>

&gt; &gt; Selo and arie of eagles do not stack, this was a nessesary nerf because<br/>
&gt; &gt; bards would outrun guides and make fun of them. Now the will plummet to<br/>
&gt; &gt; their death in many areas<br/>
