<div id="ygrps-yiv-624736371">Well I think those games are one reason, the other is that many of us became<br/>
a wee bit over addicted to EQ to the extent that our work, school, families,<br/>
health suffered and it came time to really look at priorities and realize<br/>
that EQ wasn&#39;t as important as we had made it.  I mean look at some of these<br/>
people who have 400+ days played on characters.  Do the math, its scary.<br/>
<br/>
I personally haven&#39;t quit, but I&#39;m making a concerted effort to achieve<br/>
balance in my life.  Outside is not a four letter word.<br/>
<br/>
Once I leave EQ, I think that will be an end to my online game playing<br/>
addiction, sad to say.  I&#39;ve finally realized that while EQ is better than<br/>
TV, its not better than friends, frisbee golf, or the possibility of romance<br/>

Anyway, have you heard of the TWO persistent world (massive multiplayer)<br/>
Lord<br/>
of the Rings games which&#39;re supposed to come out soon?<br/>
<br/>
And is this (leaving for Anarchy Online or others) why EQ users seem to have<br/>
vanished over the course of the last year or so?<br/>
