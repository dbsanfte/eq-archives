<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304185926">Because I planned to eventually do some of the crafted armor quests, I have<br/>
never killed a centaur because I didn&#39;t want to get bad faction with them.<br/>
I was later told by several guildmates that centaurs, similar to aviaks in<br/>
SK, have no faction.  I was told you could kill as many as you want and<br/>
still do the crafted armor quests.  Definately sounds like a bug if they<br/>
attacked you as soon as the trade was complete.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Something very much like this happened to me last night, causing me to<br/>
&gt; lose my level.  I turned in the crafted greaves components and got the<br/>
&gt; greaves and exp, and all the centaurs immediately attacked me.  Guides<br/>
&gt; said too bad, so sad so, I guess it&#39;s back to the birdhouse for me.  I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t attack (my attack key is f12, so I was nowhere near that) and I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t accidentally hit any area spells (the hotkey page I was on<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have any area spells on it).  Plus, they didn&#39;t attack my group<br/>
&gt; partner after I was dead.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to check if they were<br/>
&gt; still KOS to me, since I had my body dragged to the bridge and camped<br/>
&gt; after I got dressed.  I was not terribly happy that the guides<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t res me after such an obvious bug, but with no way to prove<br/>
&gt; it, I guess they really can&#39;t do anything.  Anyone else have this<br/>
&gt; happen on other quests?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is another bug I have run into which creeped in in the last patch.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Apparently if you complete the Squad Ring Quest currently, you are<br/>
&gt; handed<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ring and also immediately moved to KoS status will all residents of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rivervale.  How the heck do they miss this stuff?  Sounds like they<br/>
&gt; either<br/>
&gt; &gt; changed the faction hit for getting the ring, say from 5% to 100% (oops<br/>
&gt; &gt; D&#39;Vinn coder, should been 10%) or they added a faction gain that puts<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; faction &#39;over the top&#39; thus turning it into a negative number.  After<br/>
&gt; &gt; telling my bardic friend on E&#39;ci how cool the ring was he finally<br/>
&gt; completed<br/>
&gt; &gt; the quest this morning.  He is currently unable to play that character<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; immediately dying to Marshal Ghobber and reappearing at his bind<br/>
&gt; point...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Right in front of the PoD in the middle of Rivervale square.  Needless<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; say the overzealous litle Zorros immediately whacked him again... and<br/>
&gt; &gt; again... and again... before he figured out what must be happening and<br/>
&gt; &gt; pulled the plug.  I saw 4 corpses in the Marshal Ghobber room last nite<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought little of it chalking it up to the usual <br/>
&gt; &gt; W...H &quot;Hail Marshal Ghobber&quot;...A &quot;you hit Marshal Ghobber but he dodges&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; syndrome of forgetting to hit ENTER first.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This appears to be a major screwup that has seriously affected quite a<br/>
&gt; &gt; number of characters due to careless coding yet again.  I&#39;m certain my<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend has lost at least one level if not more before he was<br/>
&gt; disconnected.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not to mention the incredible amount of work he put into getting his<br/>
&gt; faction<br/>
&gt; &gt; high enough to get the ring in the first place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone else experienced this?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any word on how they are planning on fixing this?<br/>
