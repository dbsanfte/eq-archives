<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Designing an &quot;evil&quot; RPG (long intro) (maybe offensive) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591336476">Well after a pretty awful weekend (getting car impounded after returning<br/>
home from funeral), I spent yesterday after noon with my roomate (and<br/>
often EQ grouping partner) on a Real Life Quest.  Being bored we staring<br/>
comparing getting my car out of impound to an EQ quest.<br/>
<br/>
First we had to do the long camp/ rare spawn.  The dreaded DMV camp. <br/>
This spawn only occurs from 9-4:30 on weekdays, spawn time is 1-2hours. <br/>
Pretty  much a boring camp, but the lore no-drop &quot;Registration Paid&quot;<br/>
form is a common drop.<br/>
<br/>
AFter stoping at a vendor to buy muffins and water (Or in this case<br/>
doritos and pepsi), we moved onto the common spawn, though conisderably<br/>
more dangerous, Haddon Heights Police Office.  Fortunatly no one was<br/>
camping the office and the lowest lvl spawn (ie most helpful) officer<br/>
was on duty.  After giving him all the quest components (liscence,<br/>
registration, insurance, DMV form)  (Yes, thats 4 components!!!), he<br/>
gave me the much sought after, &quot;Remove Car from impound form&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Ahh, the hard part is over, now all I need is someone with tracking (or<br/>
a map) to find Greenwood&#39;s Towing.  I knew it was located in the<br/>
Runnemede zone, however all the direction I could get was &quot;Near the<br/>
turnpike entrance&quot;.  There were no Rangers in Runnemede when we got<br/>
there, but luckily, my roomate stumbled upon the spawn, while we were<br/>
wandering.  Woohoo!  I gave the form I got from the police station to<br/>
the Cashierasaurus, and amazingly the quest worked!  He gave me the &quot;Car<br/>
Key&quot;!!!!  My roomate had suggested making a rogue and pick pocketing him<br/>
(thus avoiding the 90 gold you have to habd in with the form), but I<br/>
wanted to play it safe.<br/>
<br/>
Home free?  Not quite apparantly we missed the warning about the<br/>
wandering agressive mob which spawns near my car.  It was called<br/>
&quot;Junkyard Dog&quot;.  It chased me but fortuantly I managed to outrun and<br/>
zone with 2bubs left.<br/>
<br/>
Whats my point?  Well, in all this time we had going from zone to czone<br/>
and camping, we thought of designing our own online RPG.  I think we&#39;ll<br/>
call it &quot;Psychotics Online:  The Real World&quot;.  Essentially its a mud<br/>
type game, using a 3d graphic engine.  It setting?  Earth, year 2000. <br/>
The characters?  Well originally designed for non-PVP, all chracters<br/>
would be chosen from a pool of various psychotic killers.<br/>
<br/>
Newbie areas would include The Day Care Center, Retirment Home, and<br/>
Sesame Place.<br/>
Once you hit level 10 or so, you could move up to the grade school,<br/>
summer camp (watch out for rare wander agressive &quot;Jason&quot; there), and<br/>
suburban development.<br/>
Finally, the top level psychotics can start camping the police station,<br/>
the football stadium, or get together for a &quot;government agency raid&quot;.<br/>
(if its catch on, we will make a high level expansion called &quot;Texas&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
We estimate we&#39;ll sell about 25,000 copies before lawsuits put our<br/>
company out of business...<br/>
-- <br/>
We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
