<br/>
I never used Pixie much as it had that secondary resist on it when it would<br/>
have been useful to me; charm has been my fav CC method til I got SoT. IG&#39;s<br/>
charm well for me and I&#39;ve never had huge amounts of charisma. Currently<br/>
114. The Story (forgive me if you&#39;ve heard it before): the one and only Vox<br/>
raid I ever went on was a followup to a failed raid. All the IG&#39;s and stuff<br/>
were randomly repoping. The leaders thought we had them all killed and we<br/>
went for Vox. She came out into the hall rather than us getting her in the<br/>
lair as planned so it got confused pretty quick and then an Ice Giant Magi<br/>
joined in the fray from behind. My tanks went down in the first wave and<br/>
then my cleric, who was bound in the king room at least. So me all alone<br/>
about to go melee Vox when the cleric said try to charm the IG. I figure I&#39;m<br/>
overdue for dead anyway and charmed it and sent it after Vox. We killed Vox,<br/>
and the IG magi when he was no longer useful as a pet, and I lived. Terrible<br/>
loot drop on Vox but it was one of the funniest, make it up as you go things<br/>
I ever survived! <br/>
