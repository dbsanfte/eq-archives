&gt; &gt; [Me]:  I have to think that singing the Mana song in battle is not worth it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   ... to say something isn&#39;t worth it depends all on the<br/>
&gt;   situation.  Plus, if they ask you to play straight manasong and you<br/>
&gt;   refuse, the waiting list you were on for 1 or 2 hours to get in that<br/>
&gt;   group will return.  Cause people who want pure manasong will disband<br/>
&gt;   you if you try to convince them of any other song methods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; [Me]:  If I have to pick one song to sing, it&#39;s probably Lullaby...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   You are asking for trouble if you keep this song playing, trust me.<br/>
&gt;   You do not want nor need the extra attention.  I&#39;m not certain how<br/>
&gt;   effective you are in Lguk with Lullaby anyway ...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Harmonic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Harmonic is, of course, correct.  I was being much too absolutist.  I still <br/>
believe that the numbers suggest that the pure mana song is not as useful as <br/>
twisting three songs, and should only be used in special situations.<br/>
<br/>
The mana song gives each caster in the party an additional one-third of a spell <br/>
for each spell/time increment, by sacrificing three songs that you could be <br/>
twisting constantly.  So you are trading three songs for one-third of a spell <br/>
per caster, a 9:1 tradeoff for one caster, 9:5 for five (and only if they are <br/>
all OOM). Mathematically, that makes no sense at all if all spells/songs are <br/>
equally powerful/useful; it can only be worth it if the spells the casters have <br/>
are vastly better than any songs we could be singing otherwise.  Does giving a <br/>
Cleric one-third more healing ability really make up for not singing, say, <br/>
Anthem/Largo&#39;s/DDD (even with resists)?  Or Lullabying a MOB or two?  I&#39;m not <br/>
convinced.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had groups that wanted me to play the pure mana song.  When I&#39;m feeling <br/>
lazy (and not particularly threatened), I will often oblige them.  Playing a <br/>
Bard is very draining, frankly, and it&#39;s refreshing not to have to think some <br/>
times.  Still, I leave those groups as soon as I can.  The fact is that they <br/>
are dead wrong to think that the mana song is the only useful thing that I can <br/>
play, and I don&#39;t like being in a group that is both stupid and insistent that <br/>
I go along with their stupidity.  Those are the groups that get me killed.  <br/>
Over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
As for Lullaby, Enchanter Mesmerize is better, but if I&#39;m not in a group with <br/>
Mes, it&#39;s still darned useful.  In Lower Guk (savant, exe, scribe rooms), at <br/>
level 34, I was getting about 50% resists.  This shuts down half of the goblins <br/>
in excess of the one targetted (assuming that the group is smart enough to <br/>
target one at a time).  In a four-goblin pull, that neutralizes one and a half <br/>
goblins.  (This is the equivalent of Pixie Striking each of the MOBs, without <br/>
all of the annoying retargeting).  With more targets, it&#39;s even better.<br/>
<br/>
To show how situational this is:  1) it&#39;s not worth it if you only have two <br/>
targets, and Pixie Strike might be better for three; 2) if you don&#39;t have a <br/>
Cleric, you&#39;ll probably die; 3) if the dungeon is empty of other players, I <br/>
don&#39;t sing AE songs unless we&#39;re close to a zone point.<br/>
