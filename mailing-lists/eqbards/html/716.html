<div id="ygrps-yiv-615315044"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Try getting a party and fighting the bandits in Lesser faydark.  A few<br/>
&gt;&gt;bronze weapons and you&#39;ll have cash galore in no time.  At level 8, I was<br/>
&gt;&gt;getting about 20 pp a trip.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Im a Wood Elf and my roommate plays a Highelf...can we kill the bandits<br/>
&gt;without lowering our faction with our hometowns?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only faction you lose is with that bandit camp.  I&#39;m a Half Elf and my<br/>
GF is a High Elf magician... I noticed no detriments to hometown factions.<br/>
I was killing them before the faction messages came up and many people were<br/>
worried about this.... It did one thing at least... kept the camps from<br/>
getting overcrowded.... We were one of the firsts few to find it and start<br/>
using it... And it quickly filled up in a hurry once the faction concern was<br/>
overcome.</div>
