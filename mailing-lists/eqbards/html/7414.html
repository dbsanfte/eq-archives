<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616961832">Can I get some clarification on how the charm song now works against pets.<br/>
Based on how I interpret this thread, you can&#39;t charm a pet while the<br/>
caster/owner is still alive.  However, once the owner dies, you can now<br/>
charm the pet. When you charm the pet, if you want to get rid of him fast,<br/>
you can then sing the invis song and the pet will destroy himself.  Is this<br/>
correct?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if you charm the owner of a pet, will the pet start attacking the mobs<br/>
you are fighting or will he continue to attack your party? <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I can verify that this is true.  I&#39;ve been fighting a lot in Solusek B<br/>
&gt; lately, and regularily charm pets so that we don&#39;t have to bother killing<br/>
&gt; them.  When the master is still alive, you are greeted with the message<br/>
&gt; &quot;That NPC cannot be charmed&quot;.  Once the master is dead, no problem.<br/>
&gt; Another thing to note, the pet often won&#39;t suicide if there are other MOBS<br/>
&gt; around, even if they&#39;re not the master.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not too bad if true.  in my groups those pets are just pesky and<br/>
&gt; usually ignored til the owner is dead anyway, so we can just charm him at<br/>
&gt; the end of the fight and avoid the pain of having to kill it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; eq.castersrealm.com says you can charm pets after the owner<br/>
&gt; &gt; has been killed.  Still not perfect, but better than not being<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to charm at all.  Apparently this is aimed at PvP, where<br/>
&gt; &gt; magicians were being annoyed by bards and enchanters charming<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and instakilling with invisibility) their pets.<br/>
