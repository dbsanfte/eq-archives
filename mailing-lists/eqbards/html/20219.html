&gt;<br/>
&gt;And if we could convince Faras and Aloro to join the fold we would have all <br/>
&gt;the E&#39;ci bards on this list within three guilds:-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in Militia these days, and we have at least 4 high-level bards.  Myself, <br/>
Guibu, Vasen, and Valeyardb.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyone know if Aloro is still on this list?  He used to post here quite a <br/>
&gt;bit.  He still posts on The Concert Hall a lot so I know he still plays. <br/>
&gt;Same for John Kim (Kaearia on the Concert Hall).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as I know, both of those reprobates are still lurking around here <br/>
somewhere.  I&#39;ll send you a line if I happen to spot one of them.<br/>
<br/>
