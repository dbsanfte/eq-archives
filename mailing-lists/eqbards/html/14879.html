<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854864326">The point is - there ARE newbies - and there ARE casual gamers. This is a<br/>
gentrification of elder player problem as old as all the genres of online<br/>
games/MUDs etc. How do you keep it challenging to the elder player?<br/>
<br/>
The easiest bandaid is to make everything harder - this shuts out new<br/>
players. The correct solution is adding new things - not continually<br/>
raising the bar.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed in a few posts the attitude that Verant is the enemy. Well,<br/>
sortof - WE are the enemy. This too is a very common attitude shift for<br/>
designers and GMs/DMs. What starts out as OUR game - eventually turns out<br/>
to be THEIR game - and the players do become the enemy. It&#39;s all bout<br/>
attitude and human nature - and it&#39;s as predictable as tommorrow&#39;s sunrise<br/>
- they ALL go thru it. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Which is, of course, how it should be.  As a casual gamer playing 2 hours a<br/>
&gt;night, I should expect to advance slower than somebody who plays 12 hours a<br/>
&gt;day.  There&#39;s no &quot;bias&quot; against casual gamers in EQ that doesn&#39;t exist in any<br/>
&gt;other online game.  And it&#39;s not really accurate to call it a bias<br/>
&gt;either...after all would it be fair for me to level 6x faster than Joe<br/>
&gt;Collegestudent just because I can&#39;t play as much as him? </span></blockquote></div>
