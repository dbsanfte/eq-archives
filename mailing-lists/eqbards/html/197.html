<b>Subject:</b> Re: Kelin&#39;s Lament <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817490072">The Lament is one of the bard&#39;s most powerful songs.  It is the equivalent<br/>
of the spell Lull, but in song form.<br/>
<br/>
The real purpose of the song is &quot;camp busting&quot;.  Say you have a camp of<br/>
three blue orcs, all standing around the fire.  You could kill one easily,<br/>
but three would kick your behind.  No problem.  Target an orc, sing your<br/>
song.  The orc looks sad.  Stop the song, target another orc, sing your<br/>
song.  The orc looks sad.  Target the third orc, the one with the nice<br/>
weapon, now shoot a Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow at it.  The beweaponed orc<br/>
charges toward you, while the other two contemplate their navels and quietly<br/>
weep.<br/>
<br/>
Repeat as necessary.<br/>
<br/>
One thing though, this song seems to have been decreased in power recently.<br/>
I notice that although creatures seem sad, they seem not to be lulled as<br/>
reliably anymore.  Has anyone else noticed this?<br/>
