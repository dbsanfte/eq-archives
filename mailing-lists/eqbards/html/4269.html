<br/>
I had the most horrendous day today and I have finished it with one piece of advice for those on the list more newbie than myself.  DON&#39;T GO TO INNOTHULE SWAMP WITHOUT A DAMN GOOD MAP OR GUIDE!!!!!!  A friend of mine thought it would be fun if we could attempt a foray into Guk.  I&#39;m game of course, so we head off.  After arriving, and dying once (they run and get their older brothers there when they get hurt) and coming back, we received the word of God saying it was going to be lights out for a bit on Erollisi Marr.  I camped and came back when the server was back.  So now I wanted to go home to familiar climes.  I though I knew the way, but when a troll slayer started laying into me for 40 pts of damage per hit I panicked and took off running.  It just so happened that I ran straight to the zone entrance to Grobb!  So I died again.  Then I went to attempt a corpse loot.  Guess what?  You got it--died.  So I tried one more time AND....drum roll please.......DIED!!!<br/>
<br/>
I finally made a troll character, consented him to loot me (3 times) and ran to South Ro where the orcs promptly killed that character.  So I consented the other me (the bard me) to loot the troll me.  Needless to say, after around 3 hours and 2 experience bubbles lost later, I&#39;m back.<br/>
<br/>
Guess where we headed then.....<br/>
<br/>
The moral of the story is KNOW YOU&#39;RE SURROUNDINGS!!!  Or just have fun and die a lot.  <br/>
Just trying to lighten up the list after the last 2 threads have hopefully flamed out!!<br/>

P.S. Has anyone else encountered Terrorantula?  He ate our lunch today too.  I had never even heard of him or her whatever it is.  It has to be the biggest creature I have seen to date.  Anyone else have a fun encounter with this behemoth?  Feel free to share.</div>
