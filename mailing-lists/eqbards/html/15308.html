&gt; When I was level 30, I lost about a quarter bubble per death.<br/>
&gt; I reached 31, then died without having gained any experience.<br/>
&gt; I lost a bit more than a half bubble into 30.<br/>

Clearly the amount of experience you lose in (hell levels+1)<br/>
is greater than the amount you lose in hell levels, or in<br/>
(hell levels+2).<br/>
