&gt; Well, I was chaining SG&#39;s last night no problem.  Maybe 1 resist in about 50<br/>
&gt; attempts. (I was soloing, so a LOT of chaining was used).  Later I was<br/>
&gt; walking by Dorn&#39;s camp and decided to kill him just to pass a minute or two.<br/>
&gt; After pounding him down to within an inch of his life, he started to run.  I<br/>
&gt; fired up chains.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  Resist.  5 resists<br/>
&gt; before it took.  Dunno if its always been like this or not with Dorn, last<br/>
&gt; time I fought him I was around level 15.  Seemed strange though.<br/>
<br/>

then.<br/>
