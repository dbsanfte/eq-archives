&gt; Well, the Meditate skill is pretty sweet.  Didn&#39;t even have <br/>
&gt; to zone for it<br/>
&gt; to work (read somewhere that we would have to zone for it to <br/>
&gt; kick in the<br/>
&gt; first time).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yea, this was definitely quicker. Thumbs up!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Yes, I did -- I no longer &#39;surf&#39; the landscape when running <br/>
&gt; and playing <br/>
&gt; &gt;Selo&#39;s. They&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;added animations so we now run and play a lute/drumstick.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Quies Songwind<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Arggg, I noticed the same thing.  I like the &quot;surfing&quot; <br/>
&gt; better.  Now we look<br/>
&gt; like we are comming off a crack rock high while running.  <br/>
&gt; Looks horrible, imho.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol! Yea, they essentially took our everyday standing position and just<br/>
moved our legs, and since we were kind of hunched over while standing, now<br/>
we hunch over while running. I admit, I think a straighter back is more<br/>
appropriate when running. With our high speed, you&#39;d think we&#39;d be looking<br/>
further ahead then down at our feet. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t really see this as being all that big a deal. I&#39;m very happy<br/>
with the way the bard currently is along with the quirks (air drumming). You<br/>
just get used to them.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried drumming while swimming? It always bugged me that I&#39;d stand<br/>
up in the water while swimming. I noticed that when we sit, the animations<br/>
have been turned off, which is much nicer than standing to peform the<br/>
animation. Of course, this was a much better than when we used to stand for<br/>
the animation and remain standing despite the fact that you were still<br/>
&quot;sitting&quot; in the game and couldn&#39;t move until you stood.</div>
