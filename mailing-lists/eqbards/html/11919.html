<div id="ygrps-yiv-843472203">I tested the level 48 song against a friend.  With a lute it did ~110 points<br/>
of damage.  Without it was around 60 points.  I&#39;d assume this is somewhat<br/>
higher against mobs.  <br/>
I was standing in Sol B the other day, and fired it up to help out a level<br/>
38 warrior that was soloing a greater kobold.  This is the only song I<br/>
played, and I stole the kill from him.  Ooops.<br/>

  You are encased in fire.  (or something like that?)<br/>
<br/>
  Those lava beetles have rarely done that to me, so I never<br/>
  bother to twist in FR.  Lava beetles seem to hit harder<br/>
  than ldcs, but dont have nearly the hp.  Pretty quick and<br/>
  easy kills, good exp.  As for the sonic bats, I find that<br/>
  if the caster with Resist Magic puts it on everyone, I dont<br/>
  need to twist any Magic buffs in, and can concerntrate on<br/>
  other songs.<br/>
<br/>
  Last night I bought the L48 song, wasnt as impressed as I <br/>
  wanted to be.  Pulled about 15 creatures in freeport to a<br/>
  corner and pulsed it on them.  I was expecting them to die<br/>
  instantly, but they all took a while.  On the second tick<br/>
  of the DoT they all died.  I think I need to look into the<br/>
  dmg factor on that song again, it&#39;s not as high as I&#39;ve <br/>
  been told or expected.<br/>
<br/>
  On the Song Analysis site, Satori you stated that a shaman<br/>
  should debuff the mob before this song is played.  However,<br/>
  just like togors and chains, this song will block debuffs <br/>
  and override existing debuffs.  This is very easy to prove<br/>
  when fighting ice giants.  Togors has an extremely powerful<br/>
  slowdown effect on ice giants, as soon as I pulse Binding,<br/>
  Chains, or Cessation... the ice giant returns to it&#39;s normal<br/>
  speed with my minor slowdown on it.  Basically instead of<br/>
  the ice giant hitting me every 3-5 seconds, it returns to<br/>
  pounding my ass into the ground every 1-2 seconds.  I still<br/>
  need to look into that more though.<br/>
