<div id="ygrps-yiv-281489800">Also if you are high/brave enough to go to Sirens Grotto (you can use invis<br/>
to get there and zone in is safe if you stay against the wall and don&#39;t<br/>
wander) just go and auction to buy one.  I bet the price will drop in half<br/>
of your normal server price or possibly even free.  The drum seems to drop<br/>
quite often and its lore.<br/>

 But really -- for the amount of money and time you&#39;ll spend -- a walrus<br/>
skin drum (goes for 1k on Rodcet Nife) might be your best bet.  Walrus skin<br/>
is a bit better than the tamb and cold hard cash gets it right away --<br/>
personally I enjoyed the quest but not everyone in this game does.  Just a<br/>
thought )<br/>

has a lot of traffic and you should not have any problems buying it.  Back<br/>
when I got my coins, I bought them all in a couple days of play there. The<br/>
money you will be making killing mobs there will pay easily for the cost you<br/>
would pay for the coin, instead of hours sitting on your butt camping a<br/>
mob...  I too use it as backup now as I got a walrus skin this weekend.<br/>

There are walkthroughs found readily enough on the usual spoiler sights.  I<br/>
had no problems with any of these except the Kaesoria.  It&#39;s ultra random<br/>
spawn - so some people get it in 10 minutes - others camp for hours to get<br/>
one...<br/>
<br/>
Since I got a Walrus Skin - the Tambo is my backup in the bank for corpse<br/>
runs.<br/>

Had a guild party camping the one in Kaesora for about five to six hours.<br/>
The mob that drops it only spawned twice and never had the coin.  We were<br/>
the only people in Kaesora at the time so at least there were enough mobs<br/>
to keep us happy.  Have had the other five coins in the bank for probably a<br/>
year now.<br/>
