&gt; OK I know we shouldn&#39;t this list for bragging, personal accomplishments,<br/>
etc.<br/>
&gt; but I had such a great time in Kedge over the weekend that I have to share<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; with my bard friends on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Hehe, I thought that was a big feature of this list!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Over the weekend I participated in another Kedge raid.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; we killed whatever shark drops a shark tooth(5/18<br/>
&gt; piercer). I got lucky and won the roll (around 10 people rolled for the<br/>
item).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The warrior pulled a<br/>
&gt; fierce impaler (rare spawn near the zone)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thanks largely to the cleric&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Retributions, we were able to kill the fierce impaler.<br/>
&gt; I am now the proud owner of a Gloomwater<br/>
&gt; harpoon (piercer, 9/31 +4STR, +25HP, only 3lbs), far and away the best<br/>
weapon<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve ever had.<br/>
&gt; So this weekend in Kedge I was the luckiest bard on E&#39;ci. I was the only<br/>
person<br/>
&gt; in the raid who died(twice) but I came out of the raid with two weapons<br/>
better<br/>
&gt; than the ones I went in with. Two deaths:two great weapons...poetic<br/>
justice,<br/>
&gt; kizmet, coincidence or whatever, I&#39;ll take it :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you are a 32+ bard and want to try something new, I strongly encourage<br/>
you to<br/>
&gt; give Kedge a try.  Your presense will be greatly appreciated.  Its one<br/>
helluva<br/>
&gt; zone as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Galtin of E&#39;ci<br/>
&gt; 34 bard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS I made 34th level while in Kedge as well.  That was icing on the<br/>
cake:-) </span></blockquote></div>
