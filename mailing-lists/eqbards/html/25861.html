<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572331525"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I haven&#39;t a high enough level bard to test it, but surely writing a <br/>
&gt; macro (a social button) would eliminate most of the complaints you <br/>
&gt; have with twisting four. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have tried doing this  -- I&#39;ve managed to make low-lag singing a bit easier, but missed notes in the middle of a social key are the great equalizer -- if you have more than one song keyed in a macro and you hit a missed note, you have to start the twist all over -- and you almost always lose two songs from one missed note <br/>
<br/>
What I do:<br/>
<br/>
Selos<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/stopsong<br/>
/cast 4<br/>
<br/>
each of my social hotkeys is set up this way.  I have 8 genaric keys numbered 1-8 and then my regular keys:  charm, selos, mana, etc. for my always memmed sets that are always in the same slots.  <br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re in DL with 178 people in the zone and staging to kill Gore and running with selos feels like swimming in jello  -- you&#39;ll see that socials are the wrong tactic to use for twisting songs.  If anyone has found a better setup for social-hotkey song twisting, please post it here...<br/>
