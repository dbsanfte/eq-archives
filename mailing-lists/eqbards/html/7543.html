<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-340095693"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Everyone who supports this song, please e-mail me<br/>
&gt; your name.  I would like to send this proposal to<br/>
&gt; Verant, with a list of names (read paying customers)<br/>
&gt; supporting the idea.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A better idea would be to make a petition that ALL non-binding classes could<br/>
participate in. You&#39;ll get many more responses from that than just singling<br/>
out one class that can not bind. You&#39;re also a lot more likely to get Verant<br/>
to listen to a suggestion of allowing all players to be<br/>
bound like caster can than you are of simply adding another<br/>
class that can bind. *Especially* a group bind.<br/>
<br/>
For a bard only they&#39;d have to create/program a new song.<br/>
<br/>
To make all players bindable anywhere, it&#39;s just a flag that gets set that<br/>
needs to be altered.</div>
