<div id="ygrps-yiv-50882649">I wholeheartedly agree with this.  I would also venture an assumption that just<br/>
about every other class in the game would also agree that it makes sense.  Since<br/>
Verant has already done it with Levitate, it should be easy to include a fix for<br/>
Selos.  Perhaps we should give Verant some time to work out the kinks with the<br/>
new patch.  I think the best course of action at this point is to go to the<br/>
alt.games.everquest newsgroup and support Faras&#39; post on this subject.  Brad<br/>
does read them so maybe we won&#39;t have to resort to a petition.  If it doesn&#39;t<br/>
get fixed in a couple of weeks then we can take more formal measures if enough<br/>
people think it is warranted.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; In some ways it sucks that SoW overrides Selo&#39;s, but at least I no<br/>
&gt; longer have to worry about braking a party member&#39;s SoW when cranking<br/>
&gt; up the song.  Ideally, songs such as Selo&#39;s, Water Breathing, and Aria<br/>
&gt; of Eagles would temporarily override the spell equivalents when in<br/>
&gt; effect, and then the spell effects would continue to have their effect<br/>
&gt; once we stop singing.  However, I&#39;m not holding my breath.  At the<br/>
&gt; very least, I think we should ask for the ability to be able to turn<br/>
&gt; off our own SoW effect, just as you can supposedly cancel your own<br/>
&gt; levitation now.<br/>
