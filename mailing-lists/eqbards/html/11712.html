<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377753228">not very many high level necros on my server unfortunately, though i hear<br/>
they are insanely good in lower guk.  i would have to say, without at least<br/>
1 cleric (2 is preferable: 1 for healing, 1 for stunning) do not even think<br/>
about it.  that&#39;s just my experience.  and damage dealers sure do make it<br/>
easier.  i once went with 2 tanks, me, and 3 clerics.  not quite the damage<br/>
dealing group.  we all died but that sure was fun.  only time Desparate<br/>
Dirge lived up to its name and made the difference between 6 deaths and no<br/>
sword and 6 deaths with a yak to show for it.  like you said though,<br/>
breaking the spawn is the key.  feign death, mes, pixie strike, lament (i<br/>
actually never used it there, figured good on dervs, bad on boks.  but hell<br/>
i never used pixie strike or charm until i was 50, i am a bad bad awful bard<br/>
i know, but i learned hehe).<br/>

&gt; Heh well my primary char is a Necromancer and all I can say <br/>
&gt; is bring one<br/>
&gt; along. I&#39;ve cracked the room solo. The mix of feign death <br/>
&gt; with charm is<br/>
&gt; deadly and in Lower Guk a Necromancer is just a great class <br/>
&gt; to have in your<br/>
&gt; group especially if he has all his 49 spells.<br/>
