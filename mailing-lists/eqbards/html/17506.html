<div id="ygrps-yiv-216449039">A rather quiet weekend -all-in-all- except on Sunday early afternoon<br/>
cruising through North Karana, I spot Grimfeather and decide to try out the<br/>
newly improved bard DD DoT (Chant Series) songs.  For the non-bards reading<br/>
this, Verant fixed 3 of our songs so that their effects are enhanced when<br/>
you use an instrument - this is the original design - just took them 11<br/>
months since release to get to it.  The instrument used to enhance these<br/>
songs is percussion which is also used to help you run faster.<br/>
<br/>
I got close enough to GrimFeather to effect him with a song and started in.<br/>
Chant, run away a bit, different chant, run more, rinse, repeat.  Turns out<br/>
that GrimFeather was no problem at all using this technique. He damaged me<br/>
for maybe 200 in the whole fight and that is because I was sloppy and let<br/>
him get too close.  And it was not an ungodly long battle either.<br/>
<br/>
Heh, I my euphoria to celebrate this kill, I decided to climb the wizard<br/>
spires.  Hmm, I sure seem to be climbing up here pretty darn fast.  Wow,<br/>
going lots faster now that its not so steep at the top. Hmm, I better slow<br/>
down before I....... whoops!  OMG I am falling!  I wonder if.... LOADING,<br/>
Please Wait.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky for me, a good friend, who is a cleric, was in North Karana and ressed<br/>
me back.  He had a good laugh too.<br/>
