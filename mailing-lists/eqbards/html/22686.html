<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-290257203">Hybrids (including us) get disciplines in SoV...this is from the EQ-manual...<br/>
<br/>
All hybrids get:<br/>
RESISTANT (Level 51 ┬û Velious Only): +3 to all resistances.  This discipline lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level.<br/>
<br/>
FEARLESS (Level 54 ┬û Velious Only): Immunity to ┬ôFear┬ö and all spells that cause ┬ôfear┬ö.  This discipline lasts for 11 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level.<br/>
<br/>
(*Note* on these disciplines..pure melees get Resistant at 30th and Fearless at 40th)<br/>
<br/>
Bards get these special disciplines:<br/>
DEFTDANCE (Level 55 ┬û Velious Only): Auto dodge and auto dual-wield.  This discipline lasts for 10 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
PURETONE (Level 60 ┬û Velious Only): Makes it as if you are wielding the best instrument of every type, whether or not you are actually wielding an instrument.  This discipline lasts for 2 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Other changes in SoV:<br/>
Sense and Disarm Traps<br/>
<br/>
In addition to rogues, bards, who always had the ability to disarm traps, have gained the ability to sense them as well.  Since we are aware that some may have not bothered training sense or disarm traps due to them formerly being unimplemented, bards and rogues will have the ability to gain skill without training once they have reached the appropriate level and have crossed a zone boundary.<br/>
<br/>
These skills now have use within Velious.  There are traps, and they range from annoying to deadly throughout Velious.  They are invisible and can only be detected and disarmed by rogues and bard.  <br/>
<br/>
Use ┬ôSense Traps┬ö to see if there are any traps in the vicinity.  If so, you can then use ┬ôDisarm traps┬ö to try and disarm the trap.  Once disarmed, the trap will remain inactive for a short period of time (about a minute) while your group passes through the area.  <br/>
<br/>
If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be directed towards the closest one.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Corpse Dragging in Velious<br/>
Due to the importance of faction within Velious, we wanted to avoid a situation where a group could die in an area, and then easily bring in someone with good faction to drag all of the corpses out without consequence or risk.  As such, there are some zones in Velious where dragging a corpse is considered ┬ôassisting the enemy┬ö by the inhabitants of the area.  They will react accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also many UI changes, like being able to close some of the overlays in full screen mode, and being able to access inven in full screen (didn&#39;t read much about this).<br/>
<br/>
All this came from the file in your EQ directory names eqmanual_supplement.doc<br/>
<br/>
--Khelan, lost at work...again.</div>
