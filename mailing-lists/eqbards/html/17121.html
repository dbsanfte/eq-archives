<div id="ygrps-yiv-193657774">I&#39;m usually, 75% at least, the only one down in hp&#39;s.  Occasionally one of<br/>
the caters will get hit a bit but that&#39;s it.  Casting less would only mean I<br/>
would be dead and they would take some damage when the cleric went oom.  If<br/>
we had more tanks maybe that would be different.<br/>

One of the subtle challenges to EQ is balancing mana burn with hp burn.<br/>
<br/>
If your casters are making everyone wait while they (or one of them) meds,<br/>
my guess is that they are casting too much.  If your group can match melee<br/>
with mana, you will have less downtime.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; clarity.  Maybe after 32nd I would be able to reduce downtime again, but<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; already has not been the case for 10+ levels with another 9 to go.  Having<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; primary that doesn&#39;t exist for 20 levels isn&#39;t much of a primary.  My<br/>
groups<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t had a hp downtime for at least 2 months.<br/>
