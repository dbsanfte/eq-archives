<div id="ygrps-yiv-457114710">Wow, you say you only succeed beginning a song less than one third of the<br/>
time?  Something definitely sounds amiss!  And irritating, at that!<br/>
<br/>
What are all your stats?  I always thought charisma would have a bearing on<br/>
it, but you stated you increased that with dex and strength at character<br/>
creation.  It is quite likely dexterity as no bearing on musical skills,<br/>
yours being so high.  Do you have any exceptionally low stat???<br/>
<br/>
(I have no idea the formula used to determine when a song can be<br/>
successfully started, but I do know that the singing skill or instrument<br/>
skill will effect the strength of a song, ie. Hymn of Restoration heals more<br/>
and more the higher one&#39;s string skill.)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;My success rate for twisting songs with a 95 DEX and 45 singing/instrument<br/>
&gt;skill is probably less than 33%.  I&#39;ll start keeping track and see if I can<br/>
&gt;come up with an actual % rate instead of an estimate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I get the message &quot;You missed a note&quot;, I do keep pushing the song<br/>
&gt;button but usually I just keep getting the same message.  Only when the<br/>
&gt;first song runs out do I get to start another one.<br/>
