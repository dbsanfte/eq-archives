<div id="ygrps-yiv-847991624">After reading much discussion on the perceived look that bard&#39;s should<br/>
have from a roleplaying stand point I am now inclined to begin wielding a<br/>
Dragoon Dirk and a Combine Rapier[thanks John =)].  I spent the greater<br/>
part of yesterday wandering, and hunting in and around Crushbone.  Or more<br/>
specifically hunting down such fiends as Crush and DVinn.  Suffice my<br/>
guild spent the day slying both Crush and DVinn and the occaisional spawn<br/>
of the Warlord.  <br/>
<br/>
After spending the day there with my group consisting of a level 19<br/>
cleric, level 17 cleric, level 21 wiz and 19 ranger, I can honestly say<br/>
that the jig definitely helps with mana regeneration.  However the one<br/>
thing we applied yesterday was the wonderful notion of who gets the kill.<br/>
I honestly believe that there is a major flaw with the way loot/exp<br/>
is awarded to groups.  While I was camped in the tower it never failed to<br/>
amaze how the looting rights were assigned.  Many times the party I was in<br/>
was able to ensure that we got the kill by strictly planning for our wiz<br/>
to nuke only twice.  It did not matter what anyone else did, only that the<br/>
wiz nuked twice.  That way he was about to do more damage than anyone<br/>
person who attacked it.  This point was driven home when we had a level 24<br/>
druid camping steal killing from my group (after I asked her to share the <br/>
spawns).  She would only cast three spells to steal kill.  Now my group in<br/>
total would have been ablet to do 600 damage in total(she did about 300<br/>
damage in total), yet she still got the kill from standing on the window<br/>
sill.  Does this seem wrong to anyone?  <br/>

BTW the funniest thing that ever happened that day was the moment when I<br/>
bellowed DVinn out the window.  It was incredibly funny to hear the shout<br/>
that cam afterwards.  &quot;Some high levels are training DVinn out of the<br/>
castle&quot;, and all the while we were waiting for him to return.</div>
