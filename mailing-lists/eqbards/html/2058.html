<div id="ygrps-yiv-294673469">Well met fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
I have heard mention of the area of Lake Rathe.  From what I&#39;ve read, this<br/>
sounds like a fairly good zone for me to journey to.... I am currently level<br/>
18, and my normal group is between 16 and 19.  I have no knowledge of this<br/>
zone at all, tho... and I&#39;m somewhat hesitant to go in blind.  I am asking<br/>
that someone with knowledge of this area could hopefully describe it... the<br/>
creatures it contains, how it&#39;s set up, etc... I like to be forwarned...<br/>
: )<br/>
<br/>
An another note, I was extremelly successful (lucky) over the past week or<br/>
so in exchanging and acquiring weapons.  I&#39;ll share my story.....<br/>
<br/>
I had built up cash by the beginning of level 17 to buy 2 combine weapons.<br/>
I&#39;d heard you all rave about the combine rapier so I picked up a combine LS<br/>
and Rapier.  Right after buying the rapier, Dragoon&#39;s Dirk became common<br/>
knowledge on this list, hehe, and I figured I HAD to have one of those.  I<br/>
made the journey to Crushbone in search of one.  On the way, I figured I<br/>
might as well get a jump start on selling one of my weapons.  I didn&#39;t think<br/>
the rapier would be a big success, so I figured I&#39;d auction them both off<br/>
and sell whichever came first.  Upon entering BB, I recieved a message<br/>
asking how much for the LS.. I paid 54 and change for it, so I was trying to<br/>
get minimum of 60... That was my reply.  The response back was.... &quot;How<br/>
about 20 pp and a Screaming Mace?&quot;  WOW!!!  Uh... let me think about that<br/>
one....... YES!  So here I am, sporting my new Screaming Mace with some<br/>
extra coin in my pocket and I realize... my 1H Blunt skill is at like 1!!!!<br/>
DOH!  My piercing skill had been developing, but still was around 45 or<br/>
so.... I got a better Attack Rating without weapons than I did Dual Wielding<br/>
the Mace and Rapier... LOL<br/>
<br/>
So, off I go to Crushbone... Nightmares of all Nightmares.  again, I&#39;m<br/>
reminded of the reason I left Faydwer back at level 10... CROWDS!  We camped<br/>
D&#39;vinns room and after some wonderful adventure, I end up with a Dirk.  Up<br/>
till level 17 I&#39;ve never wielded anything but 1H slash, and here I am with 3<br/>
very good weapons and NONE of them 1H Slash!  Time to sell something, and<br/>
try to work a trade.<br/>
<br/>
OTW back to Freeport, I started auctioning the Mace and Rapier, figuring I&#39;d<br/>
keep whichever I couldn&#39;t sell... The Rapier is a hard sell since Magic<br/>
Users can&#39;t use it and most people who aren&#39;t Magic Users (or belong to this<br/>
list) hate piercing.... I got a bite on the Rapier, from a fellow Bard that<br/>
I had met in my travels before and traded it for a Crysknife and 20 pp.  Not<br/>
a great deal, unless I could get 35 pp for the crysknife, cause I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
even recover my costs.  But, I was feeling a little generous after my<br/>
screaming mace trade and took the deal.  I figured that I would have an<br/>
easier time selling the Crysknife than the Rapier.  On to Freeport and Guk<br/>
and auctioning the mace and crysknife the whole time.  Skill in Mace hasn&#39;t<br/>
gone up much, heh.... I get many tells asking about the Crysknife, but no<br/>
one is interested after the stats... 4 dam 21 delay, kinda sucks.... Finally<br/>
today, my luck changes.  I ask 20 pp for the Crys, get an offer of 16, which<br/>
I take, and i&#39;m down to 2 weapons, still feeling pretty good about all the<br/>
trades even after losing about 18 plate on the Rapier trades.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at the bank in Freeport and I see an Auction for 2, count &#39;em TWO Barbed<br/>
whips!  Guy says to make offer... Hmm... I know they&#39;re worth bucks, but<br/>
let&#39;s see if I can test the waters a bit... I offer 100 pp... Guy says<br/>
&quot;Gimme a sec, checking with my partner...&quot; I&#39;m getting excited and taking<br/>
this as a good sign I&#39;d at least get it for 125 or 150.. so I auction the<br/>
mace... I get a response very fast &quot;How much?&quot; &quot;Asking 100 pp&quot; &quot;Will you<br/>
take 80?&quot; Yes........ and as that happens I get a tell &quot;You can have 1<br/>
Barbed whip for 100 pp&quot;  YES!!<br/>
<br/>
Disregarding the Rapier affair, which I took a loss of 18 pp, I basically<br/>
traded my Combine Long Sword for a Barbed Whip, even trade!  Who woulda<br/>
thunk??  : )<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about this after the fact, I feel a little guilty like I&#39;d taken<br/>
advantage of someone... But, thinking over every single trade, EVERY person<br/>
thought they were getting a pretty damn good deal, which I guess is the best<br/>
way to do business.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I tried to sell a Damask Cape for 5 pp and was called every<br/>
name in the book.... Guess you can&#39;t please everyone.  : )  (that&#39;s a very<br/>
fair price for the cape, I&#39;m told)<br/>
