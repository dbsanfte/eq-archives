<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046595782"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, all except PoF.  Compared to the rest of what&#39;s out there<br/>
&gt; now, PoF sounds like a cakewalk.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I agree with you completely.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PoH my guild hasn&#39;t tried in about a<br/>
&gt; month, but after hearing about what happened over this past weekend, it<br/>
&gt; sounds like each patch is making it buggier and buggier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Those guilds didn&#39;t know what they were doing, you all will find<br/>
  that it is the same PoH that it always has been.  Modify your <br/>
  tactics accordingly, the SE corner is very aggressive now.  But<br/>
  this does not stop a successful break.  <br/>
<br/>
  You&#39;ve got to be just as creative as Verant is.  I know longer think<br/>
  exploiting a pathing problem or npc ai is wrong, Verant has been<br/>
  exploiting players the last few months with pathing.  We live in <br/>
  harsh times now, you gotta fight fire with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; island and go directly to meteor island.  Azarack island is reportedly<br/>
&gt; possible to clear, although I&#39;ve yet to see any specific report of it<br/>
&gt; being done (post-patch. pre-patch people were able to pull azaracks off<br/>
&gt; of that island back to faerie island).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You can still do this, with Fear style CR tactics (resurrect).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	The dragons did get upgrades, but Nagafen&#39;s was fairly minor and<br/>
&gt; straight up 4 melee/2 cleric or 3 melee/2 cleric/1 bard groups my guild<br/>
&gt; generally sticks to has continued to work <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Your guild is geared for doing dragons, even after the upgrades.<br/>
  With the correct mix of people, I think anyone can do dragons.<br/>
  The problem with other guilds on Innoruuk is that they are so<br/>
  unorganized that it&#39;s a hassle to gather the right people.  GuildA<br/>
  has like 6 clerics, but GuildA has no bards.  GuildB has all the<br/>
  warriors, but GuildB has no clerics.  It&#39;s this diversification<br/>
  of classes among the guilds that ultimately prevents frequent <br/>
  organized raids.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 	Losing to a dragon because she c healed herself for the 12 time<br/>
&gt; was frustrating.  Without a doubt Vox has surpassed Nagafen as to<br/>
&gt; which dragon is more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I can imagine the frustration behind that.  If you all are going<br/>
  to play with Vox again, I&#39;m up for assisting thus freeing up one<br/>
  of your secondary bards to class shift.  There&#39;s not much else to<br/>
  to do anymore, anyway.<br/>
