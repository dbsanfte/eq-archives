no one has mentioned one of the nicer things in the last patch - you can<br/>
control colors, run and screen mode defaults now.  I don&#39;t know about you,<br/>
but have you ever missed a song because the blue didn&#39;t show up well in full<br/>
screen mode?  You ever forget to click run and get beat to death as you<br/>
supposedly selo&#39;s to zone?  I hate having to always change to full screen<br/>
(not much effort, but it does get old).  I like what Verant did here and<br/>
give them credit for it.  I just wish...  Ah, nevermind, enough said on that<br/>
line already.<br/>
<br/>
So, I want to share what I did and see if any of you have had any success<br/>
with the color changes.  I first made my songs red - I wanted to see them<br/>
boldly, but that mixed in with resist so not good.  I then changed songs to<br/>
yellow - that shows up really well in all modes.  Damage shields (if you<br/>
still have them on) also show up in yellow, but I typically am not getting<br/>
beat on that long even if pulling, so not a problem.  I also changed skill<br/>
increases to red.  I use a parser sure, but I like to see them (or at least<br/>
have a chance - blue sucks imho - I could never catch what was said - song,<br/>
skill or whatever - in blue).  Anyone else play with this?<br/>
