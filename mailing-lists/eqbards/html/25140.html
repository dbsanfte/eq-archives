<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031537054">Thanks, Shada! I had already put my flute up. I&#39;ll probably dump the Vox<br/>
horn next time I&#39;m near a bank too. Looks like I will keep my Lath Drinor in<br/>
my offhand. I was using it and a Croaking dagger. I have been seeing melee<br/>
hits for up to 80 some. Klaget said he saw a 90 while we were in Skyshrine<br/>
last weekend, so the epic really helped out my melee. Before, my best hits<br/>
were in the 50s max.<br/>
<br/>
Slyde: Gratz on the new weapon! I have never seen one of those and we have<br/>
spent alot of time in HS south. <br/>
<br/>
Atonal, I personally don&#39;t have a char around 35, I have a 45 wiz and a 24<br/>
cleric. Some good friends of mine are around 40 though (or were this past<br/>
weekend, may be higher now). If we&#39;re not on, try looking for Delania/Chubb.<br/>
Chubb is a shaman pl&#39;ing his rogue, Delania, on a second account. He&#39;s<br/>
usually in CoM. Tell him you&#39;re a pal of mine looking for a group. Chubb<br/>
keeps saying he wants his own bard! We may be able to group when I play my<br/>
wiz, which I am going to concentrate on getting her out of 45 in the near<br/>
future. Link to our guild message board:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub8.ezboard.com/bvenatorsapentia.">http://pub8.ezboard.com/bvenatorsapentia.</a> Drive by and say hello to all the<br/>
crazy people! <br/>

Scales: Work on your epic quest and do all the one group, one person parts.<br/>
Having that stuff done ups your chances of getting priority on a scale drop.<br/>
As to guilds, well VS doesn&#39;t really have the numbers on at any one time to<br/>
kill a dragon. What we do have is alliances with other guilds in the same<br/>
boat. Alliances are sorta like marriages though so you do have to do some<br/>
checking on the partner first. The easiest way is to make friends in other<br/>
guilds and help anyone you can do their epic battles. I know we are on a<br/>
serious Gore watch right now for Reorn to get his Frost tome. If I&#39;m on,<br/>
I&#39;ll try and look for you guys when we get our next shot. I can&#39;t promise<br/>
you will get the scale but meeting people who can and do kill dragons<br/>
regularly is a good thing! When we went to kill Trak for me the second time,<br/>
it looked almost like a HL lemming rush. I was not minded to turn any one of<br/>
my friends away and so many wanted to come help. We like killing dragons,<br/>
and we like helping people we know to be good people do their epic quests.<br/>
