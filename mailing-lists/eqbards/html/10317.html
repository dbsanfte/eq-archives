<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607812204"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; people seem to get awfully worked up over a game... to the point of<br/>
&gt; &gt; coming across rude to people, the game ceases to be UN-fun (actually -<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game has always been fun for me - its some of the posts on this<br/>
&gt; &gt; list that bother me). Anyway, that was  what I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; objecting to... NOT whether a person really does deserve or not deserve<br/>
&gt; &gt; things etc.... Anyway - I have said enough on this (its a good thing that<br/>
&gt; &gt; people don&#39;t HAVE to agree on things or this thread will never end).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   The only people getting worked up over this are those people who<br/>
   keep saying &quot;It&#39;s just a game.&quot;  And those same people get irritated<br/>
   over specific wording from the posts, or if they don&#39;t completely<br/>
   agree on a topic.  Plus CAPITALIZING key WORDS shows frustration<br/>
   as WELL.  I&#39;m pretty relaxed; not many things really bring me down<br/>
   in the virtual life  (email,games,usenet)  That&#39;s just me - YMMV.<br/>

   If someone has a gripe about me personally, let me know privately =)<br/>
