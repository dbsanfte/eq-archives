<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621434495">I have bought 2 stones, for 15pp each. One person asked me for 100, i<br/>
told them all us bards had gotten together and would not pay more than<br/>
20, so she sold it to me for 15... go figure.<br/>
<br/>
What about the staff? is the lambent stone the only requirement? what<br/>
are the stats on the staff? who can use it?<br/>

&gt; If its any comfort for you i&#39;ve never paid over 20pp for a stone, except the<br/>
&gt; first one i paid 70 for cause i was desperate.... most of the stones i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; gotten for 15pp.  i&#39;ve had a few whine that it worth way more then that, but<br/>
&gt; i just laughed at them and wished em luck...<br/>
