&gt; Actually you get to play a new class so not boring. They have to fix<br/>
&gt; overcrowding with high levels first and their is no reason they should<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is actually a criticism Raph Koster (Designer Dragon) had<br/>
with EQ.  As currently implemented, EQ is an advancement-based<br/>
game.  After you hit the top level, there is little to do<br/>
besides the same thing over and over to get more stuff.  UO<br/>
(even with its faults) gets around the problem by being more<br/>
of a social game - there are lots of new things you can do<br/>
once you max out all your skills.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the ranks of L50 players are growing, Verant is<br/>
having to come to terms with this problem.  The expansion will<br/>
only delay the problem, not solve it.  If the level cap is<br/>
raised to 75, they&#39;ll run into the same problem when people<br/>
start to hit L75.  (And now you know why I think it&#39;s really<br/>
stupid to buy a L50 character on EBay. :)<br/>
<br/>
Btw, if the poll on the Everlore site is accurate, L45-50<br/>
players make up about 6% of the playerbase.<br/>
