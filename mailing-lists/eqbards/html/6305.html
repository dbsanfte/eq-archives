&gt; Agility is great for all classes. Most importantly agility directly effects<br/>
&gt; your armor class which allows you to get hit for less damage and fewer<br/>
&gt; times. Agility should always be priorited in my opinion.<br/>

with my serpentine bracer. AC 1 AGI 9. I put it on and my AC went up 1.<br/>
It does affect how often you get missed but has _no_ effect on AC, which<br/>
is how much damage you take when you do get hit. As I can&#39;t tell a<br/>
significant difference in the amount I get missed between 100 and 130 I<br/>
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth giving up AC for agility beyond that point.<br/>
