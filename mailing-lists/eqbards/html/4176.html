<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779993348">I had to practice my brass skill alot to get this song to fire up, so once i<br/>
got it going i&#39;d run after all the orcs i could find in crushbone. It was<br/>
rather funny, the lower level players loved it all. They&#39;d pick off the<br/>
runners and even meditate at my feet as they felt safe.  If Dvinn wasnt<br/>
camped so much i&#39;d go charm him to kill crush. But all in all fear is a<br/>
great song. Saved my party&#39;s butt 2 times in the tower of unrest the other<br/>
night when we pulled too much. The too much became easy though once we<br/>
feared em as it gave the cleric time to heal us so we&#39;d be ready for another<br/>
round when they&#39;d run back.  Funny enough about 4 minutes after that fight<br/>
or so, the hand runs into the room and beelines for guess who, the lil ol<br/>
bard.  Was icing on the cake 8)<br/>
<br/>
My party is constantly telling me not to play that song anywhere, but when<br/>
our resident tank gets in trouble or something, they beg me to play it, go<br/>
figure. Wish they&#39;d make up their mind on such a funny song<br/>

&gt; Last night I made 26th level and got to play with the Appalling Screech.  <br/>
&gt; Man what a fun song!  My party was in Solesek&#39;s Eye and was about to<br/>
&gt; leave, <br/>
&gt; no one else was in the zone so I decided to see how big a train I could <br/>
&gt; start with this song.  By the time I left I had over a dozen gobs bouncing<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; off me, fleeing in terror!  Then on my way out I came across 3 DE guards<br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; the zone to EC, so I feared them to, then shouted to the zone that their <br/>
&gt; (the Dark Elves) guards were fleeing in terror from a lone bard, haha.<br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; love being a Bard :)<br/>
