<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-994168185">Couple of people have posted and been struggling during the same levels I<br/>
had difficulty with the first time around, so I thought I&#39;d drop a few tips<br/>
on how and why you should peserve (its amazing what you see in hindsight):<br/>
<br/>
The general concensus is that the time from 19th to 26th is quite<br/>
fustrating; you&#39;re at the point were the disparity between your melee and<br/>
your tank friends melee prowess begins to show, and yet your songs don&#39;t<br/>
adiquately compensate for that lost.  Its difficult to find a good group<br/>
during this time because this is also the weed out period - worse that hell<br/>
levels, the 20&#39;s test your commitiment to that class in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, your position is clear (push past these levels as quickly as<br/>
possible) and while boring, doing the noterious deepwater goblin pets of<br/>
Lake Rathetear will get you though it, and will get you out of your rut.  I<br/>
just checked today as I sold at the ogre camp, 2 pets still run by every 2<br/>
mins.  As someone here stated before [referring to hell levels], &#39;Quantity<br/>
over quailty.&quot;  Just set up camp right near the ogres on the hill if you&#39;re<br/>
solo, or right at the tree in the gut if you&#39;re in a group and go to work.<br/>
You have a convient zone line if something goes wrong and a food and water<br/>
vendor literally next door.  You can kill the bandits on the other side of<br/>
the gut handily for lunch money.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, stay on it, you&#39;ll get through it in about a week with modest play<br/>
time doing the pets and then suddenly your 20&#39;s songs, powered by your new<br/>
higher levels, will be more effective and desired in a group (for the<br/>
record, besides selo&#39;s, the song I ALWAYS have mem&#39;d: chain, even if I<br/>
grouped with 3 rangers and 2 druids you couldn&#39;t pay me to forget the song.<br/>
Just like insurance, ya hope you never have to use it but you don&#39;t leave<br/>
home without it.).  I suppose there is an argument to go through these<br/>
levels the traditional way, but I did that the first time around -- it was<br/>
painful and in the end the only valuable lesson/tactic/govering principle I<br/>
drew from the experience was &quot;Ain&#39;t doing that again!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and good luck,<br/>
