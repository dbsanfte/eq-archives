<div id="ygrps-yiv-867684678">I have some hotkeys out at SHIFT-4 just for when I&#39;m traveling.<br/>
<br/>
These are typically used when I pass people with SoW, as I don&#39;t like to rub<br/>
it in to people merely &quot;running&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Beep, beep!&quot; is one, and &quot;Bard, comin&#39; through!&quot; is another.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve seen mentioned by others, I enjoy actually traveling through the<br/>
landscape.  I can read the /shout, /ooc and /auction messages.  I can meet<br/>
people.  I can help with corpse locations if I have the time, I can save some<br/>
poor level 6 guy getting the beat down from a Grizzly Bear - and then heal him<br/>
up!<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE BEING A BARD !<br/>
<br/>
Crier - Bard of the 15th song on Fennin Ro<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Speaking of which, who all enjoys playing their Bard primarily because of<br/>
&gt; the ability to travel rapidly?  I mean, I know Wizards and Druids have<br/>
&gt; their nifty traveling spells, and of course, Gate has it&#39;s uses, but let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; face it - isn&#39;t there joy in watching the ground sail beneath your feet,<br/>
&gt; knowing that you aren&#39;t limited by a set of coordinates to where you can<br/>
&gt; go?  The freedom to explore that REALLY dangerous place, knowing you can<br/>
&gt; outrun *almost* anything?  Let&#39;s hear some traveler&#39;s tales...<br/>
