Strike is indeed a mesmerize.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s your charisma?  At 120 charisma against medium blues or<br/>
lower, I&#39;d say it lasts full duration about 80% of the time -<br/>
high enough that I generally weave two other songs with it.  <br/>
Against high blues it&#39;s not as effective and tends to last a<br/>
shorter time - I either just Strike over and over, or mix in<br/>
one other song.  The resists don&#39;t help either.<br/>
<br/>
Note that while Strike+Hymn is the only way to make this<br/>
viable while soloing, just Striking over and over can be<br/>
valuable in a group when everyone is OOM, low on health, and<br/>
there&#39;s one mob left to kill.  You can pause it long enough<br/>
for everyone to get enough mana and hp to kill it comfortably.<br/>
<br/>
I always have this song memorized, even when grouped with an<br/>
enchanter (they can go linkdead, or get a mob attacking them<br/>
to where they can&#39;t mes anything much less the three other<br/>
mobs the rest of you are fighting).  This song gives you<br/>
something no other song does - time.<br/>
