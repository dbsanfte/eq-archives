<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062006091">That&#39;s not my problems.  I tried that and tried disabling the sound (this is<br/>
very easy to do - create a text file called &quot;nosound.txt&quot; (contents don&#39;t<br/>
matter) in your EQ directory.<br/>
<br/>
Made no difference whatsoever.<br/>

I&#39;ve tried everything logical and many things not logical.  It&#39;s a<br/>
code/compatibility problem - that I suspect is with VIA-based Motherboards..<br/>

I had a godawful time of it last night.  I had already loaded dx7a a few<br/>
months ago, plus loaded new video<br/>
and sound drivers, so I thought I would be OK.  But after installing the<br/>
patch last night, I couldn&#39;t run<br/>
EQ at all since it couldn&#39;t detect my 3D card.  So I loaded new video<br/>
driver.  Then I was getting all of<br/>
the following:  1)  5 minutes to zone, 2) one minute to regain control of my<br/>
character after zoning, 3)<br/>
3-10 second pauses roughly 3 times a minute while attempting to play, 4)<br/>
constant disk access.  I loaded<br/>
new sound drivers, that didn&#39;t help.  What made it tolerable (although I<br/>
still get pauses) was to run<br/>
DXDIAG and set the sound acceleration slider off.  (I don&#39;t play with sound<br/>
anyway, so I don&#39;t much<br/>
care).  This improved the zoning, and gives me 3 or so 1-3 second pauses<br/>
each minute, which still stinks,<br/>
but at least it&#39;s playable.<br/>
<br/>
So turn down (or turn off) sound acceleration.  Especially if you have an SB<br/>
sound card, they seem to be<br/>
the big culprit.  Then hope they fix this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m running on a rather minimal system, and I think I need to break down and<br/>
buy some more memory, also (I<br/>
only have 64).  Is anyone running problem-free with that little?<br/>
