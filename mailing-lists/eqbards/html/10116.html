<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534830449">Yes but all those examples were with each class using all its abilities.  I<br/>
was trying to point out that separating them out was meaningless which those<br/>
examples would bear out.  How the 25th bard beat the ranger I can&#39;t fathom.<br/>
I dueled a 15th level ranger when I was 15th and despite having 40 points of<br/>
ac over him he smoked me and stayed above 2 bubbles.  If I ran around and<br/>
tried to heal he shot me with his bow, and in melee it was a near even trade<br/>
of blows.  It should be even worse at 24th with rangers getting Parry at<br/>
18th and double attack at 20th, ick!  When I hit 20th I will try again on a<br/>
20th ranger, but seriously doubt I will win a real duel with him.  What I&#39;d<br/>
like to try is a group of three bards vs three of any other class at the<br/>
same levels.  I think we would nearly win all those duels, but unless on the<br/>
PvP servers will never find out unless I can get some friends into the<br/>
Arena.<br/>

Actually, I was reading a post by someone at the<br/>
Concert Hall website describing his duels.  I&#39;ll just<br/>
go ahead and post the message rather than describe it:<br/>

***********************<br/>
You&#39;d be surprised exactly how effective us bards are<br/>
in duels. You just need to know what you&#39;re doing. So<br/>
far I&#39;m 4-1 and my one loss was really in my mind not<br/>
a true loss. You&#39;ll see that below<br/>
<br/>
Level 22 bard vs. level 23 monk (Monk won):<br/>
He won because we were still grouped and I couldn&#39;t<br/>
sing heal song without healing him too :( If I had<br/>
known that I needed to disband first I would have and<br/>
probably won. The final score was me at 0 HP (he beat<br/>
me down then bandaged me alive again), he was at less<br/>
than 1 bubble. Of course I&#39;m good friends with this<br/>
monk and he refuses to ever duel me again. He says<br/>
he&#39;d prefer being known as the one person to beat me.<br/>
<br/>
Level 25 bard vs. level 24 Wood-elf Ranger (Bard won):<br/>
This was an interesting fight. I actually decided to<br/>
melee her, and the result of the fight was me at 4<br/>
bubbles, her at one when she yeilded. It was an<br/>
interesting fight, but I won.<br/>
<br/>
Level 25 bard vs. level 24 Troll Warrior (Bard won):<br/>
This fight was a joke. He did a grand total of about<br/>
80 points of damage on me the entire fight, which I<br/>
promptly healed. Between chaining, bellowing, and COD,<br/>
he went down without even batting an eyelash. He even<br/>
tried to fool me at one point by yeilding then<br/>
attacking me when I got in close to tell him to zone.<br/>
The result of the fight was a fully healed bard vs. a<br/>
Troll warrior at less than a bubble of health (he<br/>
finally yeilded for real). The nice aspect is it took<br/>
him down a couple of notches and he won&#39;t duel anybody<br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Level 28 bard vs. level 29 High Elf Wizard (Bard won):<br/>
That&#39;s right, I took down a wizard, and it&#39;s so easy<br/>
it&#39;s not even funny. He got one spell off on me the<br/>
entire fight, which I did a full resist on. Use the<br/>
spell disrupt aspect of BBB and they&#39;re cake. Never<br/>
got a spell off and I meleed him dead.<br/>
<br/>
Level 28 bard vs. level 31 High Elf Wizard (Bard won):<br/>
This fight was a bitch but my best duel to date. He<br/>
had Jboots which sucked, and exploited the fact that<br/>
my connection was bad that evening. We started with<br/>
the typical BBB vs. a caster, and he did get a few<br/>
spells off on me, but not many. When we were both at<br/>
half health I hid and healed back up to full. We<br/>
started at it again, and that&#39;s when I learned the<br/>
coolest mid level bard tactic against casters in the<br/>
book. He finally got me rooted and started backing off<br/>
for the kill. Just charm them, thy run right up next<br/>
to you, and can&#39;t cast for the duration. All 5 times<br/>
he was able to root me I charmed him and meleed him<br/>
when it wore off. To mess with them even more, make<br/>
them stand up, sit down, report your name, etc. Fun to<br/>
the bystanders. With my magic res, bellow, selo&#39;s<br/>
constant chain (stoped those JBoots cold) and charm I<br/>
took him down. We both respect each other a lot more<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t believe for a second that we&#39;re not good<br/>
duelers. If you know how to play your class and use<br/>
every bardic trick in the book we&#39;re pains in the ass.<br/>
