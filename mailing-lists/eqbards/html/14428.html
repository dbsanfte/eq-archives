&gt; Heh, I went to go test these 2 after reading your post.  ER == Elemental<br/>
&gt; Rythmns?  Was thinking &quot;oh, good maybe I can melee and have huge MR now if<br/>
&gt; singing this is better than ER and drums...&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But after I get Aura (its Aria is it not?) memmed I realize it&#39;s not MR buff<br/>
&gt; song but the target Cancel Magic debuff.  So, I decided to play with it a<br/>
&gt; bit anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, my mistake.  I always get the names of those two mixed<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the song will have a chance to debuff more than one<br/>
buff at a time.  I&#39;ve been checking the damage I&#39;ve been<br/>
taking from damage shields, and so far IMHO the only opponent<br/>
it was worth using the song to debuff was the mino Patriarch.  <br/>
All the other damage shields I could more than offset simply<br/>
by weaving in Hymn during combat, instead of devoting all my<br/>
song cycles to singing anti-magic a half dozen times.<br/>
