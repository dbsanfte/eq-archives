&gt;&gt; &gt; By definition, the upper limit has to be the same as the lower<br/>

&gt;&gt; I must not have been clear, I mean that the lower threshold for people<br/>
&gt;&gt; grouping together seems to be 3 levels of difference, and that some<br/>
&gt;&gt; people, unfortunately, think that it is also the upper limit, meaning<br/>
&gt;&gt; that 3 is always the greatest distance between party members allowable.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Which is, of course, not the case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ah, I see.  Correct.  Also, there is *no* limit to grouping,<br/>
&gt;only for sharing experience.  I have often grouped with people<br/>
&gt;5-10 levels below me (e.g. L5 and L15) to let them benefit<br/>
&gt;from my healing song while I wait around to heal.<br/>

=)  Some dungeons, gukbottom being a prime example, are arranged so that<br/>
different areas are for different levels of chars.  For example, in<br/>
gukbottom, the bedroom area to the gargoyle room is lvl 30-34, the area<br/>
around the tower base is lvl 35-39, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This does NOT mean that a party of 35-39 lvl could not bring a 30-34 lvl<br/>
char with them to the tower base, but the healer of the group would be<br/>
spending a lot of time and mana healing the lower level char.<br/>
