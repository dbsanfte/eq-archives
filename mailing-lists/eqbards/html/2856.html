<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067903523">Since there&#39;s a thread about mapping inventory slots...  thought I&#39;d<br/>
mention a modification I plan to make...<br/>
<br/>
Just bought a Dragoon Dirk for 20 pp (thanks list-folk for the tip)<br/>
which I plan to pair with my Combine LS when I hit 17 and get Dual<br/>
Wield.  At that point, I&#39;m gonna change my hot boxes to<br/>
<br/>
	Primary Hand (with Combine)<br/>
	Secondary Hand (with Dirk)<br/>
	Inventory slot 1 (with lute)<br/>
	Inventory slot 2 (with drum)<br/>
	Ranged weapon (empty)<br/>
<br/>
Then to swap to an intrument, move the Dirk to the ranged weapon slot,<br/>
pick up the Combine and exchange it with an instrument, then put the<br/>
instrument in the Secondary hand...<br/>
<br/>
Two benefits to this, one being I still get the Dirk bonuses when<br/>
I&#39;ve got an instrument equipped, and second, I don&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about accidently filling the required top-level empty invnetory<br/>
box I needed previously for instruemnt swapping.<br/>
<br/>
This is assuming I ever get my Piercing skill up to snuff.  I need to<br/>
find somewhere quiet with blue critters about to practice on, since<br/>
in populated areas people keep trying to &quot;save&quot; me... heh.<br/>
