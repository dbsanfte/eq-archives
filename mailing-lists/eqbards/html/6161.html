<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619704561">Yep that was me :). I try and help out by doing a little damage with DDD,<br/>
CoD and Hymn with horn and lute and I start seeing the experience messages<br/>
to my horror. I did give 3pp to everyone in their group though to try and<br/>
make up for it :).  Anyhow yes Cod, DDD, and hymn is a lot more powerful<br/>
than melee.. You can test it for yourself in South karana.  Pull a rook<br/>
and try to melee it using whatever songs you wish.  Then try the same<br/>
thing with the aoe damage.  You will notice a tremendous difference.  I<br/>
was soloing 2 rooks at your level using those songs without having to kite<br/>
at all.  If you do get into trouble, toss on selos, and run and heal (or<br/>
if your feeling risky you can kite with CoD too.. its rough though running<br/>
backwards with selos in an octagon pattern works).  There are of course<br/>
dangers with using the area effect songs but its usually well worth it. I<br/>
believe at your level its about 30 damage every 5 seconds aoe which is<br/>
pretty dang good :).  If I see you in Solusek again maybe I&#39;ll join you..<br/>
the exp in Cazic isnt nearly as good as stealing your kills though ;).<br/>

Hail all,<br/>
I am level 24, armed with a dragoon dirk and a Polished Granite tomahawk.<br/>
Recently  a level 29 bard stopped by our group in SolA with a train<br/>
*laughs*<br/>
and ended up getting the kill with his horn on several goblins. I was<br/>
flabergasted (given that we have a level 28 warrior and level 26 cleric<br/>
and<br/>
wizard). So I have been playing the the horn and Dennons Dischord  then<br/>
swapping to the lute for chains or lull, then back to the horn. It&#39;s<br/>
really<br/>
really hard to say, but I MAY be doing more damage now...do we have hard<br/>
figures on DDD? I am very very curious.<br/>
