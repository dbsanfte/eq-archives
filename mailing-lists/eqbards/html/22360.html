<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468379379">No slam, no flame, simply a perspective.  I looked at the ballot in<br/>
question.  Granted, if you are in a hurry and/or your mind was elsewhere,<br/>
you may have made a mistake.  To me, the real crime is that there was a<br/>
sample ballot in the local newpapers and samples posted in the building.<br/>
Even with all of this information at the ready, some folks still found a<br/>
way to mess up.  This may sound a bit harsh, but perhaps this will make<br/>
those folks take a little more time to actually *read* the ballot next time.<br/>

&gt; If I want to subscribe to a Gore-bashing mailing list I will.  I can think<br/>
&gt; of a hundred retorts - but it&#39;s not appropriate here...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as the ballots - a poorly defined user-interface is a poorly<br/>
designed<br/>
&gt; user interface.  The intelligence or educational level of the user isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; going to compensate for that.  We have the same type in here in Cook<br/>
&gt; County - as the Republicans point out - BUT for everything except judicial<br/>
&gt; retention - you never go left-right-left-right - all the candidates for an<br/>
&gt; office are on one side of the ballot - and the opposite side is blank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I AM college educated - and voted many times - and when I got to the<br/>
&gt; judicial part (which has options on both side) - it IS very confusing -<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I realized I screwed it up.  But I figured &quot;It&#39;s just judges - most people<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t vote on those - who cares&quot;.  And it didn&#39;t matter - to remove a<br/>
judge<br/>
&gt; it requires 60 percent of the voters to vote no - and not a single has<br/>
lost<br/>
&gt; their job in many many years (great system there)...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That ballot in Palm Beach Florida was very poorly designed.  I guess that<br/>
&gt; guy can always get a job working for Verant...<br/>

&gt; Hehe, the real irony here is the same type of ballot<br/>
&gt; card is used in Al Gore&#39;s home county.  Course, this<br/>
&gt; is the same guy who&#39;s surrounded by several buddhist<br/>
&gt; idols, eastern temple arcitecture, and is surrounded<br/>
&gt; by men dressed in traditional buddhists clothing but<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s in a buddhist temple.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes I really hate my country.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cent<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I mean if us American&#39;s can&#39;t figure out which darn<br/>
&gt; &gt; holes to punch in a ballot card (even a person with<br/>
&gt; a &gt; doctorate was quoted as saying that it was<br/>
&gt; confusing) &gt; then how can we expect Verant to always<br/>
&gt; get things<br/>
&gt; &gt; right. ;-)<br/>
