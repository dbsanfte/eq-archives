<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] Bard Crowd Control <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-166842671">i don&#39;t think crowd control or dealing without lullaby is the issue for<br/>
most.  we have all dealt without lullaby for a year.  it&#39;s the way bards are<br/>
being treated by verant.  as i think kitasi said, i would never have<br/>
expected to see lyrnia go as she was an avid supporter of verant decisions<br/>
(nothing wrong with that, just saying).  the way they make decisions about<br/>
bards is what i think people can no longer stomach.<br/>
