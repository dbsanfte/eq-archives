<div id="ygrps-yiv-761857812"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Its really frustrating hearing about all the new quests on the plane<br/>
&gt; of sky when quests are my favorite part of the game.  Lame as many of them<br/>
&gt; are they are still more fun than camping.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The quests are my favorite parts of the game too.  If it were not for<br/>
&gt;them and a very small handful of wonderful people on my server, I&#39;d have<br/>
&gt;left the game long ago.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I definitely agree there.  Without quests and my friends I have made in the<br/>
game I wouldn&#39;t be playing any more either.  It isn&#39;t EQ that keeps me<br/>
playing any more, its the people I know who play EQ.  That can only carry<br/>
one so far I fear.<br/>
