<div id="ygrps-yiv-884171287">hope it went ok in fear last night, you were on late....  i was terrorizing<br/>
upper guk with my pet, was hilarious, i swear i had half up upper guk dead<br/>
between my spawn times between squire and warden. though there seems to be a<br/>
pathing problem at warden because 3 pets suicided in there under the<br/>
platform. re-equipping is a real pain in the butt. camping results: 4 spawns<br/>
of squire, 2 were placeholders, no forks just collars. results of the<br/>
warden: 2 placeholders and 1 warden, which i was lucky and he had the troll<br/>
belt, i remember my buddy camping him for days on end.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of people at work playing eq, 2 of my buddies at work play on sol<br/>
ro (well 1 quit and the other is rarely on)  and 2 others that just started<br/>
wokring here play on sol ro too. Its a small world huh<br/>

&gt; Hahaha no that was not in poor form... and frankly, things <br/>
&gt; happen, and you<br/>
&gt; sometimes need to disband the group, but you always TELL <br/>
&gt; people.  But wow,<br/>
&gt; that sounds like an adventure!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmmm, I recently ditched a group during corpse retreival.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; But lemme explain<br/>
&gt; &gt; why & tell me if you think this was poor form.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was soloing as my level 7 shaman and died in Blackburrow.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Upon returning<br/>
&gt; &gt; home I hooked up with two other young barbs who also just died in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Blackburrow.  We agreed to group up for CR.  Three others <br/>
&gt; &gt; joined us and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; got my corpse back first (it was right by the zone).  As I <br/>
&gt; &gt; was donning my<br/>
&gt; &gt; patchwork one of the other naked barbs began fretting that <br/>
&gt; &gt; someone whom he&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; just consented to drag his corpse was no longer on line and <br/>
&gt; &gt; that he thinks<br/>
&gt; &gt; all his banded has been stolen.  I finish looting and we head <br/>
&gt; &gt; in for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other two corpses.  The fretting barb then tells the group they died<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere underwater after falling down the tree.  &quot;Let&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; go!&quot; they say and<br/>
&gt; &gt; start heading for the tree.  I don&#39;t know Blackburrow THAT <br/>
&gt; &gt; well so I ask if<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone knows the way out once we&#39;re down there.  A druid in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the group says<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Gate&quot;.  Great, except two of our party are warriors.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Suddenly someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; shouts &quot;Train!&quot; and I and one of the warriors groupsay <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Zone&quot;.  The two of<br/>
&gt; &gt; us zoned, then got an earful from the druid and fretting barb <br/>
&gt; &gt; who jumped<br/>
&gt; &gt; down the tree alone, and from the other naked barb and our <br/>
&gt; &gt; sixth member who,<br/>
&gt; &gt; not knowing who to follow, stood around and got killed by the <br/>
&gt; &gt; train.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; zoned back in and I waited for & watched over the two who <br/>
&gt; &gt; died by train as<br/>
&gt; &gt; they loot there corpses.  The fretting barb by this time had <br/>
&gt; &gt; realized his<br/>
&gt; &gt; worst fears - he&#39;d been robbed completely.  Someone suggested <br/>
&gt; &gt; petitioning it<br/>
&gt; &gt; but he didn&#39;t remember the name of the person he consented.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; I buffed up the<br/>
&gt; &gt; four party members still on the upper level, said farewell <br/>
&gt; &gt; and camped.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Peace<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But i guess after reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;bad mage&quot; thread, just wanted to point out that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its never a bad class,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its almost always bad players.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sooo True.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Last week I joined a pickup group in Dalnirs.  We did<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty well in the Temple room so somebody suggested<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we go down to lvl 2.  As we all landed in the pool of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; water, sombody got excited and pulled a nice train<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; into the room before we got set up.  THings got bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and somebody said gate -- The monk and I were left to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; die.  Funny thing, all four casters in the group had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to log at that point ... <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 7 deaths (6 during corpse recovery) at lvl 30 sure can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ruin your night. sigh<br/>
