<b>Subject:</b> RE: [eqbards] dueling magicians <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-749412422">i&#39;ve fought an enchanter and mage once, and won both times.  it may have<br/>
been before pixie was nerfed though, cause i interrupted the hell out of<br/>
them with it.  with the enchanter, i tried charming the pet just after that<br/>
patch went in disallowing it, and even though i got the error message that i<br/>
could not charm that npc, the pet still turned and beat the crap out of her.<br/>
with the mage i just feared away the pet.  i don&#39;t have much insight into<br/>
&lt;50 duels as all mine were at 50+, and Dirge is my single biggest weapon<br/>
that allows me to win most duels.  not my only weapon of course, but it<br/>
packs the last big punch.  against casters, if pixie works it&#39;s definitely<br/>
your best friend.  i&#39;m not sure if you can fear a pet while it is targetted.<br/>
i can fear players in duels if i am close and have no current target, but if<br/>
you have a player targetted (in duel or not) you can not sing fear =/<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; When fighting pet classes I tell them they can have a pet, <br/>
&gt; but only if it is<br/>
&gt; summoned during the duel.  If they insist then remember this: <br/>
&gt; In duels on<br/>
&gt; the regular servers charm works.  Charm the bugger and make <br/>
&gt; him attack his<br/>
&gt; own pet then step back and watch the fun :)  If you make 30 <br/>
&gt; have Curtailing<br/>
&gt; chant up to lower his MR as well if needed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When all else fails, just fear/chain him<br/>
