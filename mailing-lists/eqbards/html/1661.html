&gt;I myself soloed from 19 until 24 by fighting gorge hounds in East Karana, it<br/>
&gt;wasnt difficult.  We can solo all the way if we want, simply Bellow and<br/>
&gt;Selo.  It just takes a tremendous amount of time and becomes extremely<br/>
&gt;tedious to do much without a group later on.  Sure I could kill mass amounts<br/>
&gt;of light light blue stuff, but why when I could be in a hag killing party or<br/>
&gt;take on familiars and sages in mistmoore?  You just plain get to see more of<br/>
&gt;the game with a bard than with almost any other character.  I would have to<br/>
&gt;say that us wearing plate is a bit ridiculous, try to play a guitar in a<br/>
&gt;full suit of platemail.  And it has gotten me in trouble more times than<br/>
&gt;not.  People think I must be a great tank, since even rangers cant wear<br/>
&gt;plate, and will let me take the brunt of damage before they realize the<br/>
&gt;plate is purely for show.<br/>

swimming in plate?..where do we keep all those backpacks anyway?...could a<br/>
gnome warrior really do near as much damage as an ogre?..magic? whats<br/>
that?..ok so i am being a smart ass..my point being this is FANTASY..not<br/>
reality..if they made everything real life physics in video games it would<br/>
be boring and tedious as hell.<br/>
