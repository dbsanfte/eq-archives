<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767068068">Yes bards are so much more fun.  After a day of stress, dying, more<br/>
stress, more dying, and finally coming close to losing my level, I<br/>
packed in playing my wizard for the day.  And am now about to consider<br/>
retiring her gracefully before she loses her high elf ladylike<br/>
demeanour and swears like the trooper my bard is  hehe<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion - the bard is fun, meditating is not and neither is not<br/>
being able to hit a thing when it&#39;s busy chewing your leg off.<br/>

&gt;Because I have been rather bored lately (I can&#39;t play eq till Monday cause my good comp is boffoed) I was reading a bunch of the message boards at Eq Stractics, and it dawned on me.<br/>
&gt;We are the funnest class to play in the game!  we are not like the mages - sit, meditate, stand, cast, repeat.  and we are not like the meleers - slash, slash, bash, slash, sit, sit, sit, sit ,sit repeat. we are the best of both.<br/>
&gt; And the fact that our spells cover such a diverse range, it makes it fun to look forward to a new type of song.  I haven&#39;t been able to play eq for 3 weeks (2 weeks vacation, 1 week of boffoed computer) and I am in serious withdrawal, but I will have my happy go lucky orange little bard to play when I finally can!<br/>
