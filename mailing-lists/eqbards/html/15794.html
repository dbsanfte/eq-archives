<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-343743546">Since there&#39;s some confusion as to exactly what the % figures<br/>
for the timings mean (there are 4 possibilities, 2 of them<br/>
distinct), I&#39;m going to include the raw times for them from<br/>
now on.  I suspect there&#39;s about a 0.5 second biasing to all<br/>
these times, though I&#39;m not sure why.  Maybe it&#39;s my reaction<br/>
time...<br/>
<br/>
35.5 sec - 10 punches<br/>
28.7 sec - 10 punches, Warsong<br/>
29.7 sec - 10 punches, Celerity<br/>
29.5 sec - 10 punches, Beserkers<br/>
29.5 sec - 10 punches, Beserkers w/ horn<br/>
<br/>
So in terms of % speedup:<br/>
<br/>
Normal = 0%<br/>
Warsong = 23.7%<br/>
Celerity = 19.5%<br/>
Beserkers = 20%<br/>
<br/>
In terms of % reduction in delay (which is what I used for<br/>
the timings on Rokenn&#39;s site):<br/>
<br/>
Normal = 0%<br/>
Warsong = 19.2%<br/>
Celerity = 16.4%<br/>
Beserkers = 16.9%<br/>
<br/>
I distinctly recall Beserkers &quot;feeling&quot; much slower than<br/>
Celerity when I first got it, so there&#39;s a possibility it gets<br/>
faster as you level.  I&#39;m regretting not having timed it when<br/>
I first got it now.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, big surprise with the slowdown songs (Binding, Chain,<br/>
Cessation).  Binding and Chain DO become more effective as you<br/>
level.  I suspect though that it&#39;s a sudden jump at a certain<br/>
level.  I first timed these around level 25 and got a 30%<br/>
increase in time (3.0 -&gt; 3.9 sec).  I retested at around L30<br/>
and L35 and got the exact same results.  So I assumed it was<br/>
constant and didn&#39;t bother testing again.  I tested it again<br/>
at 48 and lo and behold:<br/>
<br/>
30.3 sec - 10 attacks, normal<br/>
42.6 sec - 10 attacks, Binding<br/>
42.6 sec - 10 attacks, Chain<br/>
42.8 sec - 10 attacks, Binding + Chain<br/>
36.5 sec - 10 attacks, Cessation<br/>
36.5 sec - 10 attacks, Cessation, w/ lute<br/>
<br/>
In terms of % slowdown:<br/>
<br/>
Normal = 0%<br/>
Binding/Chain = 28.9%<br/>
Cessation = 17.0%<br/>
<br/>
In terms of % increase in delay (which is what I used for the<br/>
figures on Rokenn&#39;s site):<br/>
<br/>
Normal = 0%<br/>
Binding/Chain = 40.6%<br/>
Cessation = 21.7%<br/>
<br/>
And just for comparison:<br/>
<br/>
Torgors = ~100% (3.0 sec -&gt; 6.0 sec, but timed over 1 attack)<br/>
<br/>
A cookie to the first bard who figures out at what level the<br/>
increase kicks in.<br/>
