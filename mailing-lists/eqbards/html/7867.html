<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361289061">Patchwork is all trivial at 26.  Raw silk begins triviality at 33 (gloves,<br/>
mask) and is still not all trivial at 39.  Cured Silk does not begin<br/>
triviality until after at least 44 where I am now unless it is the masks,<br/>
haven&#39;t made one of those in a few points.  Also the raw silk and Cured silk<br/>
will sell to vendors for about break even.  I wouldn&#39;t suggest that unless<br/>
desperate though since the Cured is selling for 2-3pp per AC point currently<br/>
(at least on E&#39;ci) and even the raw silk sells at 1pp+ per Ac pt.  Boots are<br/>
the biggest sellers for me.  No one seems to want a raw silk tunic, but the<br/>
Cured Silk tunic is so popular (due to giving that buff guildmaster look) I<br/>
have been selling them for 25pp with no complaints or question.  The Cured<br/>
pants are also very popular because the AC to wt ratio for them is ungodly<br/>
good compared to even mesh.  Pants normally have the worst AC/wt ratio of<br/>
any piece in an armor set so these are an amazing upgrade even over mesh.<br/>

I have recently begun working on my trade skills (tailoring, brewing,<br/>
and smithing...I&#39;m a bard, I should trade like one!) and have a<br/>
question about the new cured silk.  Is the triviality level the same<br/>
as raw silk/patchwork or is this something new to use instead of the<br/>
platinum eating studded armor?<br/>
<br/>
I know this is off topic, but this is the only place I have access to<br/>
ask at right now.<br/>
