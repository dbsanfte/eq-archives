<div id="ygrps-yiv-304329417">nice, i will have to relay the info on the phoboplasms.  myself and another<br/>
bard have greaves.  we have yet to see the bracer and BP.  i got a helm<br/>
today (hehe wife at home playing) which is basically worthless unless in DE<br/>
form i guess.<br/>
<br/>
our groups did know that the entire zone needs to be cleared before taking<br/>
on cazic, but damn good job getting him with his 3 goons around.  too bad he<br/>
dropped nothing, he usually has something good.<br/>

&gt; Well last night was spectularly fun because we didnt have a <br/>
&gt; single zone<br/>
&gt; crash. This enabled us to clear almost everything in the zone <br/>
&gt; except for<br/>
&gt; Cazic himself and his three henchmen fright, terror, and dread. We had<br/>
&gt; killed all of his henchmen before and they hadnt dropped anything<br/>
&gt; interesting so we where thinking we would just rather ignore <br/>
&gt; them. At this<br/>
&gt; point we started getting cocky. Dracoliche was cake for us <br/>
&gt; and if another<br/>
&gt; server could kill cazic, well then we could to. So we <br/>
&gt; launched our assault<br/>
&gt; and imediatly cazic said something about his henchmen better <br/>
&gt; come over and<br/>
&gt; help him. At this point various profanties where uttered as <br/>
&gt; we realized our<br/>
&gt; fatal mistake, and sure enough fright, terror, and dread <br/>
&gt; showed up on the<br/>
&gt; spot just as we had cazic at half life. Luckily for us we had <br/>
&gt; several high<br/>
&gt; level magicancs and necros which set their pets on the <br/>
&gt; henchmen. With this<br/>
&gt; borrowed time we finished cazic and gated out with minimal <br/>
&gt; losses. Killing<br/>
&gt; him was about the same as the dracoliche except the three henchman.<br/>
&gt; Definatly need to take out the henchmen first before killing cazic :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Updated bestiary: <br/>
&gt; Phoboplasms are my new personal favorite, they can drop up to <br/>
&gt; TWO random<br/>
&gt; class specific items. Last night we killed around 8 of these <br/>
&gt; guys and TWO<br/>
&gt; dropped a bard bracer, along with a bunch of ranger and shaman stuff. <br/>
&gt; Cazic Thule : 8 platinum. Thats it. Good thing killing him <br/>
&gt; was so much fun<br/>
&gt; cause that was a big let down. <br/>
&gt; Nightmare&#39;s drop some silly piece of nightmare hide that can cancel<br/>
&gt; blindness. Woopydo. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Total bard pieces found have been 2 bracers, helmet, and <br/>
&gt; boots (which i<br/>
&gt; got) and arms and gloves which another bard got. No greaves <br/>
&gt; or breastplates<br/>
&gt; yet :(<br/>
