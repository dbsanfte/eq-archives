<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000531135">Yea its very dependent on the classes.  I would enchanter would be one of<br/>
the worst to try to multi play.  When I stopped pl;aying EQ to perform in a<br/>
play, my regular Thursday night group, did not want to tbreak up.  So my<br/>
roomate, paid my $10 a month and played both his warrior and my cleric.  He<br/>
said it was no problem at all.  Granted he lost my cleric crowd control<br/>
(parking.and atoning), and we were no where near effective at killing<br/>
casters (when we were both playing in the same room we would pretty much<br/>
never see a enemy spell go off, between his bash and my stuns).<br/>
<br/>
I could see playing a monk as a puller (in a multi group raid) and a nother<br/>
class (since essentially the monk could just stay feigned the whole time<br/>
without losing much).<br/>
<br/>
However this stems from a specific question about loot rights and I would<br/>
say the multi played enchanter should not have gotten the robe.  Primaries<br/>
should always come before secondaries.  In my former guild, I got way ahead<br/>
of a lot of my guild mates in level, and started playing my cleric secondary<br/>
with them at times.  I would always defer loot to them, even though I was<br/>
playing my cleric (and only my cleric) at the time the loot dropped.  Its<br/>
simply common sense.  The guild was best served by the the primary getting<br/>
the item.</div>
