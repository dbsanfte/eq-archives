Well, reading what you wrote, we&#39;re probably not as different as you might<br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the chant series myself, but the tradeoff is that we aren&#39;t<br/>
singing any party buff or MOB<br/>
debuff songs while using it, so whether or not it&#39;s a good idea is<br/>
situational.  I do use them.  I don&#39;t<br/>
use them on large group efforts since I can&#39;t get high enough on the hate<br/>
list to avoid the DOT bug (no,<br/>
it&#39;s not fixed).<br/>
