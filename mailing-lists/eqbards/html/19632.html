<div id="ygrps-yiv-685819733">I&#39;ve been wondering what our server demographics looked like.  Last time I<br/>
checked bards were really low on the list.  As I recall only rogues were<br/>
less common when I checked over the course of the week.  Monks were close<br/>
behind us though. <br/>
<br/>
I wish there was an easier way to check demographics even for the times you<br/>
are on.  It would tell you a lot about where to go to hunt etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I missed the event.  My guild held a RL event on Sunday.  I did get my<br/>
Star of Odus so I guess I&#39;ll be starting the quest anyhow.  <br/>

My guild plus an allied guild conducted a raid into Kaesora yesterday.  All<br/>
told we hade 15 people there with me the lowest at 37th level.  Raid had two<br/>
goals.  One, to get as many coins as possible for the bards in my guild.<br/>
Second, to kill Xalboz, the boss mob who spawns in the church.  Not everyone<br/>
got there at the same time so we marshalled at the library to wait for<br/>
everyone to arrive.  All told we were there about an hour.  During that time<br/>
it was nonstop pulling.  The fallen crypt raider spawned once during this<br/>
time.  Once everyone showed up, we moved to the lower parts of the dungeon<br/>
en masse, killing everything in our way.  Once we broke the church area, two<br/>
groups remained at the bottom to take down Xalboz if he spawned.  My group<br/>
moved back up to the library to harvesy coins.  All told we were in Kaesora<br/>
for about six hours.  Unfortunately Xalboz never spawned.  However, the<br/>
fallen crypt raider spawned a total of five times.  So every bard who<br/>
attended the raid got a coin.  People who had been in Kaesora before were<br/>
shocked that the raider spawned so often.  Guess the random number generator<br/>
god blessed us.  <br/>
<br/>
Like someone else mentioned in a previous post, Kaesora is a vastly<br/>
underused dungeon.  We were there for six hours during peak hours on a<br/>
weekend.  During that entire time, only two other people (both 50+ level)<br/>
entered into the zone.  Not certain why there weren&#39;t more 30-45 level<br/>
people in the zone.  Almost every mob in there conned blue to me at 37th<br/>
level so its a great place to hunt for my level.  My guess is that the<br/>
server demographics for E&#39;ci is top heavy.  Probably not enough 30-45 level<br/>
folks around to cover all the dungeons designed for those levels.  <br/>

I think the failed raider shows how incredibly flawed Verant&#39;s Random Number<br/>
Generator is.  Many things seem to go for hours (days?) without every<br/>
triggering; then the RNG goes nuts and pops many many times in a row.  We&#39;ve<br/>
had two people so far claim it was &quot;easy to get&quot; and three (counting me)<br/>
reporting it difficult.  My good friend Darkfox who&#39;s on my server and this<br/>
list has also reported it&#39;s a &quot;Semi-Rare&quot; spawn...<br/>
<br/>
I spent about four hours there.  Hooked up with a group 50-55 who were after<br/>
the named guy at the Church to get a fang for a quest for a key to get into<br/>
Howling Stones and to explore the zone.  They cleared the library - no<br/>
failed raider - no coin.  They had moved on by the time I got there.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after I joined them - another group came in to camp the library.<br/>
They were there a good three hours (by the time I moved on) maybe longer.<br/>
Unless they were bullshitting me (which I doubt) - they didn&#39;t get a single<br/>
Failed Raider - and nothing else dropped the coin.  They had a bard in their<br/>
group - so I was hoping they&#39;d get two.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt they were bullshitting.  If they did get a bunch and were hoarding<br/>
them for various reasons; they fairly got the room while my group was<br/>
camping elsewhere - why would they lie?<br/>
<br/>
We all know the rules of random sampling - a 2 hour sample of a 30 minute<br/>
spawn is 4 samples - you got a 50 pct hit.  Another group got six tried and<br/>
0 pct hit... (Plus my groups sample - they cleared the room only once<br/>
though)<br/>

Kaesora is virtually deserted on Inny. Like I posted, been there 2 times<br/>
now.  First time, cleared into the Library and presto there was the coin<br/>
guy.  Second time, cleared library, no coin, cleared the other stuff in the<br/>
area, library re-spawned and we got the coin guy.  Less than 2 hours.  Might<br/>
have been the 3rd time to clear the Library but seems to be a fast 30 min<br/>
timer in that zone.<br/>
