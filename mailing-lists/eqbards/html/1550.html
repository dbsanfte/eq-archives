<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293767516">Yes indeedy. Not sure if it&#39;s a percussion or singing thing or simply a <br/>
case of: effect of this song = x + the bard&#39;s lvl (or the bard&#39;s lvl <br/>
divided by 2.. or whatever). Either way it does definitely appear to <br/>
improve as I gain levels and I&#39;ve seen high lvl bards (I&#39;m 18th, definitely <br/>
NOT high lvl ;) mention it - on here or in a post, can&#39;t remember. Other <br/>
songs improve too.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the post about some Bard spells (sic) requiring Mana on the Test <br/>
Server too... shocked me somewhat. Does anyone here honestly think we&#39;re <br/>
overpowered? I&#39;ll say this - we&#39;re a FUN class to play simply because we <br/>
don&#39;t have to put up with a lot of the tedious shit that many other classes <br/>
do. We&#39;re a quick healing, quick moving, pretty good at ass-kicking, speed <br/>
the game up a lot for the player kinda class. But I really don&#39;t think <br/>
we&#39;re overpowered or twinky in any way. Requiring mana would add an element <br/>
of tedium to playing the game - and although I hate to go off on a tangent <br/>
let me just quickly say that I reckon the last thing EQ needs is another <br/>
element of tedium to overcome.<br/>
<br/>
...which is why I love Bards - we make this game fun, for me at least.<br/>
<br/>
BACK AT THE BARDIC HOMESTEAD...<br/>
<br/>
My instincts are that aything related to us requiring mana will suck but <br/>
until some patient or extremely curious soul really does some research on <br/>
this (J Kim? (Just kidding ;)) we really don&#39;t know how harsh it&#39;ll be and <br/>
it might even be fun. Might make some of our stuff MORE powerful. I like to <br/>
think positive - call me naive.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a request for some info:<br/>
I&#39;m close to getting the inviso song... in peoples&#39; experiences, what <br/>
critters see through it? And can you use it to disappear from an attacker <br/>
even after you&#39;ve initiated combat? I suspect not but it&#39;s nice to know <br/>
these things in advance ;)<br/>
<br/>
And some tidbits on some other stuff:<br/>
I think Guardian Rhythms is a great li&#39;l spell. People have mentioned how <br/>
magic resistance isn&#39;t working, but I&#39;ve found this song to be extremely <br/>
effective - especially when I&#39;ve played it with a drum. You resisted the <br/>
&lt;&lt;turn your brains inside out&gt;&gt; spell! Yeeeeah!<br/>
And the Charismatic Carillion song is GREAT! Thanks to whoever worked out <br/>
what it&#39;s for, it&#39;s excellent to pretty much be able to do everyone&#39;s <br/>
quests (within reason, of course). I must admit, to me most quests are <br/>
inane crap with insulting rewards, but I still have fun doing them ;P I&#39;m <br/>
all excited now I can waltz into the Rogue&#39;s guild in Qeynos and try my <br/>
hand at all those fun quests I never managed to finish when I played a <br/>
Rogue.<br/>
Or not. We&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>

As you<br/>
get better at Percussion, do you get faster? Does the same apply to <br/>
singing?</div>
