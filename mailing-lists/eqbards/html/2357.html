&gt;&gt;Swim to -2140, 7490 or 220, -9210.  Those are the two spots the boat<br/>

&gt;In a similar vein to the discussion of bards wearing plate and other<br/>
&gt;aspects of roleplaying, are there other hardheads out their who would<br/>
&gt;rather drown than use /loc and numeric coordinates?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally I consider /loc a debugging command and a roleplaying<br/>
&gt;abomination.  I refuse to deal with it.  If we are to have such a pin-point<br/>
&gt;locating and finding capability, it should be a proper in-game mechanism,<br/>
&gt;not a computer programming artifact.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t use it for more mundane reasons - I&#39;m an idiot. ;)  Seriously, I&#39;ve<br/>
tried and tried to follow /loc info - it just doesn&#39;t work.  Now, I just<br/>
tell people to tell me where they are, and I find them with my collection<br/>
of maps.  A good Bard is always prepared.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which - Bristlebane willing, I should be playing again Monday,<br/>
on the server of the same name.<br/>
