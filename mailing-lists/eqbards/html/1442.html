<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708395870">I have heard that Acc at higher levels negates root<br/>
and snare.  Is there any truth in this statement?  Also<br/>
does the bard get a song that lets him gate back to<br/>
his bound position?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Also, I rarely if ever mouselook in the game.  I prefer to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have my hands on the keyboard as much as possible.  I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are those that hate keyboard turning, but other than<br/>
&gt; &gt; that, mouselook and button clicking tends to slow you down<br/>
&gt; &gt; in combat, especially when there&#39;s a lot going on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just remapped all the keyboard commands to the left side of<br/>
&gt; the keyboard (old Netrek trick :-).  I use mouselook all the<br/>
&gt; time, and I have all the keyboard controls at my fingertips<br/>
&gt; all the time.  The only time I feel clumsy is when I&#39;m typing<br/>
&gt; a message and something happens (It&#39;s shift-del to erase a<br/>
&gt; message btw).  Otherwise my right hand is always on the mouse,<br/>
&gt; and my left hand is always at its rest spot on the keyboard<br/>
&gt; with all the commands immediately available.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i.e. my movement keys are e, s, f, c; d is center<br/>
&gt; q is target nearest NPC, w is open inventory, r is run,<br/>
&gt; g is duck, z is switch camera, x is switch view, v is con,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another advantage of this is that if you&#39;re using mouselook<br/>
&gt; (holding the right mouse button down) and you hit either the<br/>
&gt; left or right key, it strafes/slews instead of turns.  After a<br/>
&gt; while, that&#39;s easier to do than hit a different key, which is<br/>
&gt; good since I&#39;m running out of keys on the left side.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I use the mouse to open distant doors (the U key most times, if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is the only key I haven&#39;t managed to remap yet.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; fight again.  If we have to run away, no matter which hotbox I&#39;m on,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s 3,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Selos starts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a &quot;natural&quot; keyboard which is split, so 5 and 6 are the<br/>
&gt; easiest keys to locate without looking.  My Selo&#39;s sits on 5<br/>
&gt; right now, although I&#39;m trying to condition myself to have it<br/>
&gt; on 6 since 5 is easier to twist with 3 and 4.  I&#39;d been<br/>
&gt; experimenting with having inventory slots on two banks so I<br/>
&gt; could keep Selo&#39;s always available.  At your level and speed<br/>
&gt; it probably doesn&#39;t matter anymore, but as we&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; discussing here, at lower levels you *need* the drum to get<br/>
&gt; away from some mobs.<br/>
