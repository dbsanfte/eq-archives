&gt; As for your last paragraph, I have to admit I don&#39;t get confused by alot of<br/>

&gt; time, and the thing they are missing is sense.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the way I felt at first.  But talking with my friends<br/>
and watching it play out in UO (and now EQ) over the last<br/>
several months has really been an eye-opener for me.<br/>
<br/>
Let me try to draw an analogy.  Baseball cards.  They&#39;re just<br/>
pieces of cardboard with ink printed on them.  But many many<br/>
people enjoy collecting them, enough so that they will pay<br/>
much more for a rare one than you and I probably make in a<br/>
year.  Their enthusiasm for it drives up the real life value<br/>
of these pieces of paper to the point where some of them trade<br/>
these things as their full-time job, and get paid or make<br/>
real-life money for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing is happening with the items in UO and EQ (less<br/>
so in EQ since there are no sinks).  Yes they&#39;re nothing more<br/>
than electronic bits on a computer somewhere, but just like<br/>
with baseball cards, they have real-life value.  And just like<br/>
baseball cards (and stamps and art and all sorts of other<br/>
things with no real practical value), they are being<br/>
integrated into real-life society and economy.  If you don&#39;t<br/>
yet see this, 5 years from now you&#39;ll be wondering how you<br/>
missed this boat; just like the folks who threw away their<br/>
baseball card collection and Roger Maris rookie card when they<br/>
&quot;outgrew&quot; the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I know it seems silly that people will pay real life money for<br/>
virtual stuff, but that&#39;s the way it&#39;s going to be from now<br/>
on, our concept of a MMORPG notwithstanding.<br/>
<br/>
(If you really want something to ponder, most real-life money<br/>
nowadays is nothing more than electronic bits on bank<br/>
computers.)<br/>
