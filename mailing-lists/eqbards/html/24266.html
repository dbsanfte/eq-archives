<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883690479">Speaking of which, anyone have good spots for experience at 48-50ish?  I<br/>
usually duo with a monk and we have a regen tunic at our disposal.<br/>
However, I also want to be able to solo in the mornings on weekends, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We tried Dreadlands, mobs too low blue to get good xp, hit really hard.  Sol<br/>
b was great and would still be good except for the crowded factor and I dont<br/>
think I can solo bats, even if I get a solo pull.<br/>
<br/>
GD is too green, as is EW.  Let me know your ideas please :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve gotten really nice Experience (probably as much from <br/>
&gt; frequency of pulls<br/>
&gt; and fast disposition of mobs) in the Hand Room...<br/>

&gt; i dunno, at least on saryrn pickup groups in the mid 50&#39;s <br/>
&gt; still seem to be<br/>
&gt; fairly<br/>
&gt; competent.  karnors sucks for exp, btw, you know that most of <br/>
&gt; the mobs in<br/>
&gt; there range from 39 to the low 40&#39;s right?  i&#39;d suggest <br/>
&gt; parking your bard in<br/>
&gt; sebilis and trying to get a group, and if that doesn&#39;t work, <br/>
&gt; play your alt.<br/>
