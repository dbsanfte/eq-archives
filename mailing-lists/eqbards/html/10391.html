<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383657752">I had the exact same experience a couple of weeks ago - also in Highkeep!<br/>
(You play on Xegony server?) had two other bards in the group.  Neither<br/>
&quot;twisted&quot; at all - they just each kept one song going the whole time. One<br/>
doing Hymn the other doing Jig.  I don&#39;t think they even bellowed.<br/>
<br/>
I got into a major argument with one of the bards about the Jig thing.  It<br/>
was funny that laughed off &quot;the old rumor that Jig DOESN&#39;T increase mana<br/>
recovery&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing about it - one of my best bud&#39;s and guildmates - a<br/>
cleric - felt that it WAS helping him.  This is a VERY knowledgeable player.<br/>
I explained to him the &quot;apparent speed&quot; issue - and he still felt it<br/>
increased mana recovery.<br/>
<br/>
The thing to keep in mind about my bud - he lives in a remote part of<br/>
Wisconsin - has TERRIBLE connectivity - goes linkdead constantly.  He ALWAYS<br/>
has bad PL/ping.  So I suspect that in the case of these people bad<br/>
connectivity - the jig song actually may help.   Jig may essentially force<br/>
more frequent server updates.  For those of us lucky enough to have<br/>
broadband access - or clean dialups - more frequent server updates makes no<br/>
difference - so we KNOW jig doesn&#39;t help.  But perhaps for the others -<br/>
perhaps it negates the lag caused by the bad connectivity?<br/>
<br/>
Just one bard&#39;s theory here..<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a different topic, I grouped in HHK last week and there was already a<br/>
&gt; bard in the party, using weapons. I had to ask her 3 times what she was<br/>
&gt; singing (so I could sing other songs so as to not conflict) and she<br/>
&gt; finally said &quot;well, mostly bellow, and chains if they run&quot;. Then after<br/>
&gt; each combat, while the party members were injured, she would sing<br/>
&gt; &quot;Jaxan&#39;s Jig o&#39; Vigor&quot; so that the cleric could get mana back faster to<br/>
&gt; heal. I sent her a private tell explaining jig doesn&#39;t aid mana<br/>
&gt; recovery, and she informed me that she KNEW it did, because a level 32<br/>
&gt; wiz told her it did. I suggested she try to test it sometime, she said<br/>
&gt; the wiz&#39;s word was good enough for her. How frustrating! I refuse to<br/>
&gt; play Jig for anyone, no matter how many people tell me it helps. I ran a<br/>
&gt; test myself, and came up with ZERO increase in recovery, so I feel<br/>
&gt; confident when I say to the casters &quot;Jig does not aid mana recovery&quot; (I<br/>
&gt; should make a hotkey for that :). Can&#39;t Verant just put a note in the<br/>
&gt; news confirming and denying some basic rumors like this and the 6 person<br/>
&gt; XP bonus? Would make our lives easier :)<br/>
