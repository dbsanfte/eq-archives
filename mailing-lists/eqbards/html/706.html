<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2223882">I also disagree that str is the best stat. I pumped 5 into str, and put the<br/>
rest in charisma. I almost never fizzle when twisting, and I get incredible<br/>
prices on items at the store. I&#39;ve also been able to access vendors most<br/>
other of my type can&#39;t - even without killing to adjust factions. <br/>
<br/>
I have purchased very expensive items for people at such savings that I got<br/>
a few plat for myself as a reward. <br/>
<br/>
I have also engaged in buying loot from people at a rate they are happy with<br/>
and sold it for profit (ogres and trolls come to mind).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no simple answer about stats, it&#39;s just based on what kind of<br/>
character you want to play. I would add the Roleplay bit into it... think<br/>
about your character and what he/she is like. Take the attributes you think<br/>
your character really has.<br/>

Just wanted to add my 2 cents on the stats issue..i have seen many people<br/>
say to pump all u can into strength cause u&#39;ll need it for that heavy<br/>
armor...this is true..but..i personally only put 5 into str to bring my<br/>
half-elf str up to 80...why would i do this ?  simple with 8- i could wear<br/>
full chain and have enough str to carry quite a bit of loot without being<br/>
encumbered..o what about that heavy plate..not to worry..i for 1 dont plan<br/>
on buying regular plate as it is heavy and ridicously expensive..i am<br/>
currently level 26 and upgrading slowly to pieces of lizard.ie mantle and<br/>
cape..and rubicite.  This armor if u didnt know is much lighter than plate<br/>
and just as good(i think, i dont have stats on all pieces)..also got a<br/>
thick leather apron from unrest  ac8 weight 1....<br/>
2ndly as you get this high there are plenty of magical items to pump up<br/>
your strength..both as loot and now from enchanters as they get higher up<br/>
in level.<br/>
So as you can see dont worry if your not arnold the bard...i found my<br/>
pumped dex and agility much more useful as lowere level than i would<br/>
strength...:)<br/>

&gt;I would suggest pumping up your strength above all the other stats, thus<br/>

&gt;As far as best race goes, personally I dont think there is one.  I play a<br/>
&gt;wood-elf and a half-elf , putting most of the extra points into strength on<br/>
&gt;both characters and there isnt a difference in playability that I&#39;ve seen<br/>
