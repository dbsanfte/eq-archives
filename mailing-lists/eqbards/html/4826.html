<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126911052">At levels 10-15, I spent a lot of time fighting the bandits in Lesser<br/>
Faydark and the Dervish Cutthroats in North Ro and West Commonlands.  That<br/>
was the point at which I decided to leave the homeland of Kelethin and<br/>
Crushbone and start exploring.  Lots of stuff out there to fight at that<br/>
level range, both in groups or solo.  I recommend doing the bard mail<br/>
delivery quests and explore some on the side.  As long as you don&#39;t run into<br/>
a griffon or giant, you can outrun just about anything you might bump into.<br/>

&gt; btw, where is a good place to hunt for this level?  I&#39;ll go pretty much<br/>
&gt; anywhere (in Steamfont now, soloing stuff outside the mino caves, but<br/>
&gt; grouping within)<br/>
