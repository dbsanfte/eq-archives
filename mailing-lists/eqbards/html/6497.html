<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326209174">I haven&#39;t tested it since the last patch but prior to the patch if you<br/>
successfully hid and then tried to sneak, you immediately got the message<br/>
that you are no longer hidden.  If you are playing the invisibility song,<br/>
you can&#39;t sneak so that option is out.  Would be nice if the invisibility<br/>
song didn&#39;t gray out the Sneak button.  That would make Sneak a potentially<br/>
useful skill.  However, on the realism side it might not make much sense<br/>
since the mobs can still hear the flute playing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Haven&#39;t brought this up since I keep forgetting, but what about using<br/>
&gt; sneak<br/>
&gt; while invisible?  Might this not let you sneak past those creatures we<br/>
&gt; &#39;think&#39; are seeing us invis?  Maybe they are just hearing us and reacting<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; that?  I know its logical which means its probably silly and wrong, but it<br/>
&gt; sounds good.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; IMO, hide and sneak should work the same for bards as it does for rogues.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; agree with everyone else that the two skills as they are currently<br/>
&gt; implemented are worthless for bards.  If we could sneak while hiding there<br/>
&gt; may be some opportunity where the skill could come in handy.  Verant<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t even include the two skills as part of the equation that<br/>
&gt; determines class balance for the bard.<br/>
