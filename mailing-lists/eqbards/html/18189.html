<div id="ygrps-yiv-903239808">yes, and i noticed i am hitting harder (a lot more in the 50s).  i&#39;m pretty<br/>
sure it has to do with gaining a level.  although absonant binding does<br/>
resist a lot more than once every 20 hours, it does stick almost all the<br/>
time which is more than i expected with 4 effects.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have all of you noticed that resist rates are very very low? <br/>
&gt; I think I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; had one single spell resisted in the 20ish hours I&#39;ve spent <br/>
&gt; there so far.<br/>
&gt; Am I extremely lucky or is everyone finding similar results?<br/>
