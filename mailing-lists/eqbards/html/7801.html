the game system.  I don&#39;t consider these things to be<br/>
non-exploit bugs or exploit-bugs anymore.  I think of them on<br/>
a graded scale, with some being more unbalancing than others.<br/>
Technically, Accelerando breaking root (if things stay as they<br/>
are) and casting SoW before you enter a dungeon are exploits.<br/>
But they are so ingrained into the game that I would not<br/>
considering them as unbalancingly exploitish.  Using the<br/>
suicide trick back from Freeport/Qeynos I probably would<br/>
consider unbalancing, except it&#39;s extremely rare that I need<br/>
to do this.  Using it to avoid the boat, I probably would not<br/>
consider unbalancing.  I&#39;ve lost enough time as it is due to<br/>
boat bugs and lack of a consistent boat arrival time, that the<br/>
time I save doing this comes nowhere near the time I&#39;ve lost<br/>
due to the boat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not that I&#39;ve seen.  Attacking yourself seems to be OK by the<br/>
guards.  Speaking of which, I accidently mesmerized myself<br/>
with Pixie Strike this weekend during a fight.  Doh!  And I<br/>
thought only enchanters had that problem...  :-)<br/>
