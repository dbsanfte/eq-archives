&gt; Not true, when it works it definitely causes a mob to stand there and do<br/>
&gt; nothing until hit or the duration ends.  However, it is broken.  Perhaps<br/>
&gt; last nights example can make this clear to you.  I was running thru BB and<br/>
&gt; paused to watch a couple of people fighting near the entrance in case they<br/>
&gt; need help.  After a bit I punched up a song to run again and hit the wrong<br/>
&gt; button, Lullaby.  I got the following, obviously incorrect results.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;         A gnoll pup nods<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t saying Lullaby is only good for interrupting casters, I was<br/>
saying it is awesome for it. I&#39;ve seen the song work in the last 3 weeks<br/>
several times effectively, so I&#39;m not able to pin down why it&#39;s not<br/>
working for others. Sorry for the confusion, my intent was to point out<br/>
the song has at least a two-fold use. I wouldn&#39;t solo a cleric that<br/>
wasn&#39;t green to me, and as such it doesn&#39;t really matter if he tries to<br/>
hit me or not, so long as he can&#39;t cast. I often pull casters with<br/>
debuff, so by the time he gets to me he&#39;s sans bravery, guard, o&#39;kiel&#39;s<br/>
radiation, etc. anyways. ;P<br/>
