<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786863613">You know, bandying about the phrase &quot;bannable offense&quot; just smacks of the <br/>
powerhungry, play-as-I-play mentality I forementioned.  Big frickin&#39; deal!!  <br/>
Any game where you can be banned for doing something that does NO HARM to <br/>
anyone but a make-believe creature is inane to begin with and hardly worth my <br/>
time.  Should I get banned I will shed not a tear and Verant will simply do <br/>
without my subscription dollars.  I have confronted GMs with this very <br/>
proposition yet I remain playing.  Wonder why that is??<br/>
