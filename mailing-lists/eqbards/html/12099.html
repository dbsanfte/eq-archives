<div id="ygrps-yiv-367980535">If you use it on yourself, it&#39;s either resist or stun.  It<br/>
seems to be more effective against mobs as well, although it&#39;s<br/>
resisted more now that they added the MR debuff to it (or<br/>
maybe all the mobs I&#39;ve been fighting lately have MR buffs).  <br/>
There are still cases of the song seemingly not working, but<br/>
they are not frequent enough for me to consider the song less<br/>
than useless.<br/>
