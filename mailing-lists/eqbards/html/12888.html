&gt;&gt;&gt; Has anyone had any luck at all getting the /stopsong command to work?<br/>
&gt;&gt; Never.  It doesn&#39;t even stop a song that is playing normally, let alone<br/>
&gt; Use the command /stop Works for me when i do decide to use it.<br/>

<br/>
similar to<br/>
<br/>
/gu /gui /guil /guild /guilds /guildsa /guildsay<br/>
<br/>
all do the same thing.  Believe me, I&#39;ve tried it with /stopsong too.  If<br/>
it works for you, more power to ya.<br/>

Story of the night: Warrior, necro, magician, me, the remnants of a stone<br/>
spider group decide to stay behind to handle one last spawn sans healer.<br/>
About a minute before the spawn, an ldc (lava duct crawler) scurries into<br/>
the room.  Everyone digs in, and as it nears death the stone spider<br/>
spawns and leaps toward the nearest pet.  The warrior ended up with about<br/>
3 bubbles of health from the ldc, and I had 2.5 with bloodboil (figured he<br/>
had it too), so I stood back and played hymn a bit, took a few swipes,<br/>
tried to stick largo&#39;s (that thing has the highest MR I&#39;ve seen yet;<br/>
granted bigger stuff I&#39;ve seen was debuffed post haste), managed to get<br/>
myself stunned, beat up some more, lost the necro pet and finally eked out<br/>
a victory over the thing for a well-earned BCP.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just glad I didn&#39;t have to mez it.<br/>
