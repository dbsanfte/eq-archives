<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501623352">You go!  I think I&#39;m heading there fairly shortly, but I think I&#39;m gonna ask some of my big brothers in the guild if they want to help &quot;lil&#39; me.&quot;  Being the only real life girl in a guild composed of all my old gameing buddies helps a lot sometimes though. :-)  Being a cute little red haired wood elf helps too, I think.<br/>
