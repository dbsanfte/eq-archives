(couldn&#39;t decide if I should /t one of them they were speaking outloud, or just<br/>
leave quickly & quietly).<br/>

&gt;         Warning, You have entered an Adult area if your Station is underage<br/>
&gt; you will be     booted in thirty seconds.<br/>

&gt; And don&#39;t give me any guff about what if my kid is playing on my account<br/>
