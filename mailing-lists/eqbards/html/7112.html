<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468054160">Don&#39;t laugh...I over heard a two-some trying to &quot;keep warm&quot; one evening in Halas.<br/>
(couldn&#39;t decide if I should /t one of them they were speaking outloud, or just<br/>
leave quickly & quietly).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Oh that should make for some interesting conversations.  Now we just need a<br/>
&gt; petition to replace some of the PvP zones with Adult zones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You walk into Hogcaller&#39;s third story...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Warning, You have entered an Adult area if your Station is underage<br/>
&gt; you will be     booted in thirty seconds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         To be followed with Loading...Please wait<br/>
&gt;         for anyone underage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And don&#39;t give me any guff about what if my kid is playing on my account<br/>
&gt; stuff as that&#39;s a violation of the user agreement anyhow no matter how<br/>
&gt; common it might be.<br/>
