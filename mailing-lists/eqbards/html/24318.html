***EverQuest Turns Two***<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago this Friday, EverQuest was launched, forever changing the<br/>
course of online gaming.  Today EverQuest boasts nearly 360,000 active<br/>
subscribers, and a two-year retention rate of 65%.  Peak usage tops 89,000<br/>
simultaneous users with average peak usage at roughly 87,000.  The EverQuest<br/>
community continues to grow daily.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve put up a page on the EverQuest website to help celebrate EverQuest&#39;s<br/>
achievement and to thank our loyal fans.  Over the next couple of days we<br/>
will be posting interesting content from EverQuest&#39;s humble beginnings, as<br/>
well as a few surprises.  Check it out!<br/>

*Ever Changing, Evolving, Expanding*<br/>
<br/>
The Warrens:<br/>
<br/>
As part of our two-year celebration, we&#39;re pleased to announce the release<br/>
of &quot;The Warrens&quot;, a free expansion zone located on Odus. &quot;The Warrens&quot; is a<br/>
low-to-mid level dungeon and the home of the Kobolds on Odus.  You can patch<br/>
the Warrens by running the &quot;Optional Patch&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to filling-out the continent of Odus, &quot;the Warrens&quot; will also<br/>
serve as a platform to try out some of the new ideas brought forth by<br/>
members of the team and the public aimed at addressing some common gameplay<br/>
issues.  We would like to see what options might be open to and enjoyed by<br/>
the players in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level<br/>
characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level<br/>
creatures.  To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that &quot;outclasses&quot;<br/>
a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP.<br/>
All other loot will drop.  &quot;Outclassing&quot; a foe is defined as having a group<br/>
makeup such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill.<br/>
This can happen if, for instance, the foe is &quot;green&quot; to all group members,<br/>
or if the group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system<br/>
determines the fight was unbalanced using regular experience rules.<br/>
<br/>
Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due to it<br/>
being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was &quot;trivial&quot; will be<br/>
displayed to the group.<br/>
<br/>
As time goes on, we will be implementing new gameplay subsets and<br/>
adjustements in the Warrens.  Please be sure to let us know what you think!<br/>
<br/>
The Planes:<br/>
<br/>
The Planes of Fear and Hate have been updated as part of our two-year<br/>
celebration.  Adventurers in the Plane of Fear will notice that some<br/>
high-level foes are now available.  Rewards for former &quot;boss npcs&quot; have been<br/>
moved down to underlings that are roughly as powerful as the old bosses<br/>
were.<br/>
<br/>
The Plane of Hate has also received a large update, but this one also<br/>
includes the opening of a previously undiscovered part of the zone, now full<br/>
high-level expansion-oriented content.  Much as with Fear, rewards from<br/>
bosses have been moved.<br/>
<br/>
Epic Quests:<br/>
<br/>
As part of the Plane updates, we&#39;ve made several adjustments to Epic quests<br/>
for a number of classes.  Previously, questers of many classes were put in<br/>
direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers for a few coveted<br/>
spawns.  In these cases, a new step has been added to separate the &quot;Epic<br/>
Encounter&quot; NPCs from the &quot;Epic Quest&quot; NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements have remained the same.<br/>
In other words, if you turn the same items into the same NPC, the same<br/>
reward applies.  What has changed is that some components may be in a<br/>
different location from where you expect them.  It is recommended that you<br/>
check with the last NPC in line or other adventurers to find where you need<br/>
to go next.<br/>
<br/>
***Patch Day***<br/>
<br/>
Along with the big announcements above, today was a patch day as well:<br/>
<br/>
- Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time between<br/>
character control being established and loading of character faction tables.<br/>
- Fixed the Dagger of Frost.  Its special item flags were improperly removed<br/>
in the last patch.<br/>
- The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit.<br/>
- The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to the<br/>
enhanced Mark of Karn.  The casting time on these items has also been<br/>
changed to 9 seconds.<br/>
- NPCs in Thurgadin will no longer stop traveling when you /hail them.<br/>
- Fixed a problem present in Nagafen&#39;s Lair and the Plane of Hate that<br/>
caused framerate to drop over time.<br/>
- Shift-clicking on a stack of items will cause you to pick up the whole<br/>
stack.  This is in addition to CTRL-clicking on a stack, which will cause<br/>
you to pick up one.  These both also work for coins now as well as items.<br/>
- In addition to the above, holding down the shift key while clicking the<br/>
&quot;Sell&quot; button in the vendor screen will cause you to sell the entire stack<br/>
of items if a stack is selected.  For example, you can sell 20 peridots by<br/>
selecting the stack, and shift-clicking &quot;Sell&quot;.  I&#39;d recommend though that<br/>
you give them to your neighborhood cleric first though :)  The ability to<br/>
buy stacks is on the list for implementation in the near future.<br/>
- There are a ton of new recipies for trade skill users out there.  Check<br/>
your books.<br/>
- There are a bunch of new quests as well.<br/>
- It appears that we fixed a bug with the Mend skill that caused it to be<br/>
unavailable for a few seconds after it was supposed to be ready for use.<br/>
Let us know if there are any further problems.<br/>
- Foraging items will now yield a message giving you some idea of what<br/>
you&#39;ve foraged.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember that the /movelog for the Rathe and E&#39;ci is scheduled for<br/>
this weekend.  Please read the message below for details on the /movelog.<br/>
<br/>
*A Message From Customer Service*<br/>
<br/>
We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters<br/>
moved from one server to another, or from one account to another.<br/>
Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we<br/>
receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and<br/>
other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters<br/>
across servers or accounts.<br/>
<br/>
It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server<br/>
remain on that server.  We also feel that it is important that characters<br/>
that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the<br/>
consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that<br/>
reputation by changing servers.<br/>
<br/>
The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large<br/>
number of characters to new servers.  At no other time will we move a<br/>
character in such a fashion.<br/>
