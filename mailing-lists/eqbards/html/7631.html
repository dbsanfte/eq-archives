<div id="ygrps-yiv-127277184">Not really most of the high level priest weapons do the same amount of<br/>
damage as a high  level caster weapon. Look at the stats on the Necro only<br/>
staff from PoF it&#39;s equal to ther priest weapons. Then again look at mid<br/>
level weapons like the staff of the observer pure casters can use this and<br/>
it has a extremly good ratio for blunt weapons. There is not much diffrence<br/>
in melee between priests and casters.<br/>

&gt;&gt; it doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not pure casters. At level<br/>
&gt;&gt; 50, a cleric/shaman/druid will be just as useful meleeing<br/>
&gt;&gt; as a wizard is, which is to say, not at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s not the point. A pure caster is a pure caster from<br/>
&gt;birth to death. Just because you *choose* not to melee,<br/>
&gt;whether it&#39;s because you&#39;re not as good at it -anymore-<br/>
&gt;as you used to be or because you do better in your other<br/>
&gt;ability (casting), does not change the fact that you can<br/>
&gt;still wear armor, you can still use multiple weapons and<br/>
&gt;you can still melee in a pinch better than any caster could<br/>
&gt;dream of.<br/>
