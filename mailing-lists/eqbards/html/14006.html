<b>Subject:</b> The future of EQ (was My overcrowding solutuion) (OT) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849119573">Ok here&#39;s my final take on both of these two issues.  I think everyone will<br/>
agree the camping vs dungeon crawling problem is a direct result of a bad<br/>
design decision when EQ was just an idea in the programmer&#39;s mind.  I think<br/>
everyone will agree that server overcrowding is a direct result of bad<br/>
forecasts by Verant on how long it would take people to reach 50 and how<br/>
long it would take them to complete the expansion.  They obviously<br/>
miscalculated.  <br/>
<br/>
The key issue as I see it is does Verant have a solution that will fix both<br/>
problems?  It might be that Verant doesn&#39;t consider camping a problem and<br/>
have no intentions of ever changing the design.  The recent discussion on<br/>
possible ways to implement dungeon crawling could all be wasted words.<br/>
Verant has said all along the game was designed where once you get to 50,<br/>
you retire your character until the expansion comes out and start a new one.<br/>
So what happens when the expansion comes out and a few months down the road<br/>
you have a bunch of level 75 characters complaining about overcrowding again<br/>
and threatening to cancel their subscription if they don&#39;t add stuff for<br/>
level 75 characters to do? <br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that Verant is in this to make money so its in their best<br/>
interest to appease their clientele.  Until they tell us their intentions<br/>
for the future of EQ, all we can do is speculate.  I do think it would be a<br/>
smart move on their part to share their future plans with us so we can<br/>
provide feedback now instead of when its too late and already in the game.  <br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that we are unlikely to see resolution on any major<br/>
issue affecting EQ until EQ2 comes out.  As a result,  I&#39;m not going to let<br/>
it upset me whatsover at this point.  If I find that down the road I no<br/>
longer enjoy the game as much as I do now, I&#39;ll just move on to another<br/>
game.  In no way will it detract from my EQ experience.  EQ was the best<br/>
money I ever spent on a computer game.  There are a lot of good games that<br/>
have come out since April 99 that I haven&#39;t played because of EQ.  Diablo 2<br/>
is just around the corner so I know for a fact I won&#39;t be playing as much EQ<br/>
when it does.  Neverwinter Nights eventually as well.  By the time I get<br/>
tired of these two games plus any others that come out, EQ2 will most likely<br/>
be out.  I&#39;m looking forward to playing a new incarnation of Galtin when it<br/>
does.<br/>

Galtin of E&#39;ci (who always tries to remember to change the subject line<br/>
because he&#39;s the one guilty of starting most of the OT threads)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; People are lazy about changing the subject.  :)  I wasn&#39;t very<br/>
&gt; &gt; interested in the overcrowding thread, but someone made the<br/>
&gt; &gt; comment that they got a chance to play the game as Brad<br/>
&gt; &gt; intended - dungeon crawling.  Then I said crawling and camping<br/>
&gt; &gt; were mutually exclusive.  Then a bunch of people posted ideas<br/>
&gt; &gt; about how to make the game crawling-based instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; camping-based, which is when I started putting (OT) on it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry about not changing the subject line.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok you win, sorry :-).  I still say it don&#39;t have a chance of ever flying<br/>
&gt; until they solve the over crowding problem though.<br/>
