&gt; &gt;Aye Musiker is on occasionally. Convinced him to do some soloing in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Dreadlands. Last I saw, he was 40.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hehe, You dident convince me to do some soloing *Grin* I almost NEVER solo. I<br/>
&gt;hate soloing, its too damned boring IMO.<br/>
&gt;I have started to hunt with groups in Dreadlands, on the north wall of <br/>
&gt;karnor to<br/>
&gt;be precise. I still find that 3 spawn in Overthere gives me better experince<br/>
&gt;overall + I have just about hunted so many berzerkers that I am able to enter<br/>
&gt;the outpost without my mask (They con threathingly without the mask) So I <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;I will do my last bubble of hell (40th) in OT.<br/>
&gt;Btw I almost never have problems finding a group. Only problem is that the <br/>
&gt;zones<br/>
&gt;where people hunt during my playhours, are the same well known zones which is<br/>
&gt;tottaly crowded during peek hours. I guess thats the curse of playing on the<br/>
&gt;hours where there is less than 1k people on the server - I seldom get to fight<br/>
&gt;in the less populated zones like dalnir.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol. Yea, I agree, soloing isn&#39;t all that exciting. City of Mist is pretty <br/>
fun, but at your hours you won&#39;t find any pickup groups. Grouping in <br/>
Dreadlands gives far less exp than soloing in Dreadlands, naturally. Where <br/>
is the 3 spawn in the Overthere? There&#39;s some person on Bertox who has been <br/>
pretty obnoxious in the past at the 3 spawn (just listening to him on the <br/>
&quot;shout&quot; chat) so I avoided the &quot;3 spawn&quot;.<br/>
