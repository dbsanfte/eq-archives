<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227666557">As far as I can tell from my monk using the fbss from my 45 rogue, it does make the skills recycle faster (dragon punch, kicks and stuff like that).  Never got the chance to try it out with my rogue and backstab...but if I remember correctly, it did *not* change it.  Could be wrong here though, haven&#39;t tested thoroughly.<br/>

  Subject: [eqbards] Haste tests... Swirlspine Belt? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I am curious as to how the Swirlspine Belt figures into all this.<br/>
  I have heard rumors that it is both faster than, the same, and slower <br/>
  than the FBSS.  Anyone have one they could try out?  If it is indeed <br/>
  the same haste %, then by far it is better than the FBSS.<br/>
<br/>
  This is interesting, I have a monk friend who has some Cape off of <br/>
  Innoruuk that gives what he says is 30% haste, he might be interested <br/>
  to know that my lil&#39; old Verses of Celerity might indeed give him <br/>
  maximum haste.<br/>
<br/>
  Wonder how monk attacks like Dragon Punch and Flying Kick, and also <br/>
  Backstab figure into the equation.<br/>
