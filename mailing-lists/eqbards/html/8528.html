&gt;&gt; I wonder if the GM/Guide bards have a percussion<br/>
&gt;&gt; instrument that is above, and beyond, the Drum of<br/>
&gt;&gt; Selo&#39;s March and/or Mistmoore Battledrum.  You<br/>
&gt;&gt; should have offered to trade :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From a reliable source.. Guides do not get *any* of their<br/>
&gt;class&#39;s spells or songs. They also do not get any<br/>
&gt;instruments or weapons (other than their staff of guiding)<br/>
&gt;to weild. They apparently have a belt of something or<br/>
&gt;another that gives them Spirit of Norrath. The guide you<br/>
&gt;saw running around wasn&#39;t using Selo&#39;s or a drum..<br/>

in the Plane of Fear (full spawn eeek!) we had a guide helping us by<br/>
ressurecting and recovering our corpses for us. He would summon us to our<br/>
corpse in the PoF and then do a ressurection. I thought this was damn odd,<br/>
because he was a lvl 50 cleric guide and was using his lvl 49 spell to do<br/>
this. And he had to meditate after each time. I have been ressurected<br/>
before by our GM and he didnt med or cast, just zapped away. Maybe this was<br/>
just a freak occurance, i dont know, but he definately had his spells :)<br/>
