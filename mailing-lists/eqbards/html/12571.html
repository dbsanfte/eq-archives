<div id="ygrps-yiv-814362310">yup, you know what happens when you make an assumption... you make an ass<br/>
out of you and umption.  ok i stole that from samuel l. jackson.  anyway, i<br/>
know you&#39;re not an idiot.  and i don&#39;t like to disagree with you (ok i do)<br/>
but you admit you are fairly new to dragon raids, so like you said earlier<br/>
you asked for advice and we&#39;re giving it.  what you mention here is<br/>
definitely one of the biggest problems.  the first time nagafen was killed<br/>
on our server (first attempt too) many months ago, we had 8 full groups of<br/>
people, and tons of lag and linkdeaths.  with server and player evolution,<br/>
we can do either dragon with 24 ppl and little to no deaths.  what you need<br/>
is less people and more experienced players who know each other, work well<br/>
together, and are balanced good for a dragon raid.  takes time and practice,<br/>
and you&#39;ll get there.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   You are assuming I&#39;m a complete idiot when it comes to lag.  Let<br/>
&gt;   me help you out here... There is visual lag (all the crap you are<br/>
&gt;   stating) and there is server lag.  The location server cannot keep<br/>
&gt;   pace with 50 or 60 people standing in one place.  It never has,<br/>
&gt;   even in beta.  Verant simply hasn&#39;t designed the game to accomodate<br/>
&gt;   that.  I do not get visual lag.  I get server lag.  In fact, to<br/>
&gt;   the point where I completely crash. </span></blockquote></div>
