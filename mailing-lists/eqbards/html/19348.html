<div id="ygrps-yiv-823146209">You don&#39;t have to take a hit if that&#39;s what you mean, no.  If you are<br/>
backing up you can do as follows.<br/>
<br/>
1. recharm pet till it sticks.<br/>
2. hit f8 to target closest non-friendly npc.<br/>
3. hit hotkey with /pet attack<br/>
4. hit accelerando hotkey<br/>
5. hit f1 twice to retarget pet<br/>
<br/>
that way the pet will initiate the conflict.  The couple of times I tried it<br/>
with FM giants it worked 100% of the time.  That&#39;s how I figured ou it<br/>
wasn&#39;t an outrunning issue.<br/>

Oki, I was afraid of that.  Is there anything that can be done?  I&#39;ve<br/>
tried chains on the target so the pet can start the combat and have the<br/>
target turn around but with the shorter-than-normal durations I&#39;m<br/>
getting when charming giants it&#39;s hard.  I suppose that&#39;s my only real<br/>
choice tho, yea?<br/>
