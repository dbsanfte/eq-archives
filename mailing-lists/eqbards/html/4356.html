<div id="ygrps-yiv-869026582">Maybe it&#39;s just me but every time I visit the eleven continent I experience <br/>
similar situations.  Maybe something about dwarves and elves attract a younger, <br/>
more immature gamer.  So I spend most of my time elsewhere despite the great <br/>
dungeons  there.  Still have the occasional KS problems but nowhere near as bad <br/>
as near The Fay.   <br/>
<br/>
One obvious solution is grouping.  Find an enchanter,   They have this great <br/>
spell that wipes the memory of the mob just before it dies.  They can be wicked <br/>
kill stealers and everytime it happens to us she teaches them a painful lesson.<br/>
Grouping is best, more fun and more effective.<br/>

from 5p-1a EST during the week and then 24/7 on the weekends. (*ahem* <br/>
believe it or not, I do have a life mixed in there.. hehe) People just <br/>
aren&#39;t selling them anymore.<br/>

&gt; good - my first choice but not for 75pp - you can get 2 <br/>
&gt; combine daggers for that and have change for milk<br/>
&gt; and muffins!<br/>
     <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought a Combine Longsword to take care of my magical mob requirements. I <br/>
was just looking for the Dirk for the day when I blessedly get dual wield. <br/>
As it is now I&#39;ve got a Dwarven Axe sitting in the bank that I&#39;ll use since <br/>
it&#39;s really fast.<br/>
     <br/>
And on a different subject and trying to keep it Bard related: What can a <br/>
bard do (if anything) when he/she is being constantly robbed of his/her <br/>
kills by magic users? For example.. I&#39;m sitting on the training hill in <br/>
Crushbone just wailing away having a good ol&#39; time - nobody else is up there <br/>
(that I can see) and I&#39;m just plugging away at Centurions.. Lo&#39; and behold <br/>
the Trainer spawns.. I start whacking away at him thinking great, real <br/>
experience now - and *zap* *bang* *boosh* and the trainer is running to a <br/>
magic user that was hiding himself over the edge of the hill. Aparently (now <br/>
I know) the Trainer carries the Shiney Brass Shield sometimes.. I mutter my <br/>
profanities and the other person leaves (so I thought). Same thing happens <br/>
again.. And again.. I finally get sick of it and leave the hill. Is there <br/>
nothing that as a Bard we can do to prevent this sort of thing? I mean, I <br/>
wasn&#39;t camping for the shield (didnt even really know about it at first) but <br/>
my kills were being stolen. I&#39;ve camped before and gladly take turns with <br/>
any other groups that are present - but it&#39;s really annoying that there&#39;s <br/>
such rampant stealing like this and nothing that can be done about it. Whine <br/>
to Verrant? I doubt they&#39;d do anything.. Duel the caster? Bah, he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
accept. And neither of us were PvP&#39;s. Are we as Bard&#39;s just stuck to the <br/>
whims of Magic users?<br/>
     <br/>
I won&#39;t even get into the massive and unbelievable amount of KS&#39;ing on the <br/>
new Brell Serillis server.. keeeeripes man. 100 people outside of Felwithe <br/>
going after the same MOB&#39;s.. I gave up on that server quickly.<br/>
