same MR as Elemental and Purifying.  I&#39;ve been tracking this<br/>
ever since I got Guardian.  It seemed odd to me too, but<br/>
Guardian has the advantage of stacking with certain other<br/>
songs (mainly Elemental and Purifying and so far all of the<br/>
Psalm series) and giving a bigger AC boost.  A couple levels<br/>
ago, I&#39;d go from 45 to 90 MR playing Elemental, and from 90 to<br/>
135 MR playing Guardian on top of that.<br/>
