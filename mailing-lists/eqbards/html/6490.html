<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746868921">I agree on the points you brought up Mike, but the graphics won&#39;t get<br/>
chenged until they do an art patch, probably in the expansion.  Barbarian<br/>
shield graphics have the same problem and fixing it would require patching a<br/>
huge file and making everyone patch in for about 45 minutes on a 56K line,<br/>
longer if slower.  I believe the graphics will get fixed, just don&#39;t think<br/>
it can happen before the expansion.<br/>
<br/>
Of much greater concern is the SoW change.  Last nite on E&#39;ci druids, angry<br/>
at losing their ridiculous ability to kite creatures that would slaughter<br/>
someone 10 levels above them of any other class, were SoW&#39;ing every bard<br/>
coming out of Freeport.  I got hit and then 30 minutes later got hit again<br/>
by another druid in W commons.  He even went so far as to laugh and say<br/>
&#39;Outrun me now nerf-boy!&#39;  Talk about childish.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, although not specifically bard related except in that bards<br/>
probably do more quests than anyone else simply because they can, is the<br/>
constant changing of items to no drop &#39;willy nilly&#39;.  I went to the bank<br/>
last nite and literally could not remove 7 of my 8 containers from the bank<br/>
because if I did I would not be able to put them back.  I would have to<br/>
carry around over 1 backpack of stuff if I did.  Why does Verant think the<br/>
solution to everything is to make an item no drop.  Bizzarely the Bozemite<br/>
Pestle, which to my knowledge no one has figured out the use for is now No<br/>
Drop.  Honey Jum on the other hand, while it now requires considerable<br/>
faction and 30gp instead of 5gp to obtain, is not.  Go figure.  Why should I<br/>
have to carry this stupid emerald shard halfway across Norrath to get the<br/>
other piece, when it would be so much more sensible to put it in the bank<br/>
while searching for the other piece.  Sigh, thank goodness it doesn&#39;t weigh<br/>
10 lbs.<br/>

I have just posted the following Usenet message on the alt.games.everquest<br/>
board that Brad says he browses, please agree or disagree, back me up, and<br/>
hopefully I was not out of line in speaking for all of us:<br/>
<br/>
Myself and others who have regular discussions on the ONELIST bard&#39;s forum<br/>
are concerned about the recent changes to SoW that is affecting our Selo&#39;s<br/>
Accelerando.  It seems that once SoW is cast on us we are stuck with it and<br/>
it overrides our Selo&#39;s, you can see how this can be a bad thing.  Please<br/>
try to work something out with this, my suggestion is that you allow the<br/>
ability for a player to cancel SoW if they choose just like you have done<br/>
with the Levitate spell.<br/>
<br/>
We are also perplexed at the minotaur horn graphic turning into a burlap<br/>
sack on our character&#39;s Avatar, is this intentional?  We have come to accept<br/>
that our drum looks like a flute and we blow on our brass horns backwards<br/>
and hope that this will one day be addressed, but maybe insted of a burlap<br/>
sack, you could change the graphic for the mino horn to look like the<br/>
graphic for the brass horn.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the bards in EQ comprise a very small percentage of the<br/>
overall population but it is that fact along with the fact that we are not<br/>
inclined toward overt rants and flames against Verant or any particular<br/>
person at Verant that causes us to often feel as though we are being<br/>
overlooked.  I believe I understant that the Bard class was the last class<br/>
to be developed before final release and as a result there were a lot of<br/>
issues (such as the ones regarding how our instruments look and behave on<br/>
our Avatars) that were left unfinished.  Granted, issues like this do not<br/>
affect gameplay, they do make us feel like the stepchild class.<br/>
<br/>
I implore you to try to dedicate some of what I realize is already burdened<br/>
development resources to addressing a number of these issues and providing<br/>
us with at least a small amount of information on if and when you intend to<br/>
address the ones leftover from beta (like my flute drum and hari-kari brass<br/>
horn).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
