Once you understand that, you start to see that monster<br/>
boosting is just another step in the downward spiral the mud<br/>
wimping article describes.  Slowly advancing people<br/>
get screwed while the quickly advancing people the changes are<br/>
aimed at are relatively unaffected since they&#39;re already high<br/>
level.  *That* is what frustrates me most about this whole<br/>
process - it&#39;s regressive in that the lowest levels are nerfed<br/>
the most.<br/>
