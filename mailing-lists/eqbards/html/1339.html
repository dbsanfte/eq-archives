<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782959797">Last night I did a little experimenting with the level 11 song.<br/>
<br/>
Changes have definately occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I have noticed:<br/>
<br/>
- Singing the song at an NPC who is less than &quot;amiable&quot; to you will make them<br/>
look upon you amiably.<br/>
<br/>
- Singing the song at an NPC who &quot;scowls at you ready to attack&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
do anything.<br/>
<br/>
- When you change one NPC to Amiable, all OTHERS of that type seem to change as<br/>
well.  So if you change a dwarf merchant who was apprehensive toward you, all<br/>
others in the same zone who were apprehensive seem to change as well.  (This<br/>
seems like a bug).<br/>
<br/>
- These changes DO affect prices, provided that the NPC was not amiable to you<br/>
in the first place.  Using the song on a dwarven smith who was originally<br/>
&quot;apprehensive&quot; changed the price of a pair of chain leggings from 47 plat to 42<br/>
plat.  Using the song on a wood elf merchant who was &quot;amiable&quot; to me made no<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else done any experimenting?<br/>
