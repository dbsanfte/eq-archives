<div id="ygrps-yiv-181277831">I have made the journey once from Qeynos to Freeport with a 22 level wizard <br/>
who had invisibility and the like. It is much better traveling with a high <br/>
level spellcaster because you can be bound to highpass hold if you die and <br/>
also because they can do invisibility. I have found only one problem with <br/>
this though. I believe Selo&#39;s acclerado somehow messes up invisibility. When <br/>
we traveled invisible with accelerado invisibility would wear off very <br/>
quickly at times. Often times RIGHT AFTER the wizard cast it. This got quite <br/>
annoying and I have died several times from it. I discovered that if you <br/>
just go invisible without the accelerado then the invisibility lasts much <br/>
longer.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I used to run back and forth from Freeport to Qeynos all the time (for <br/>
&gt;many<br/>

&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;same day. Accelerando ROCKS!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In another life I made the run from Freeport to Qeynos as a dwarf warrior<br/>
&gt;of the 6th level, in the company of a much higher level group and with the<br/>
&gt;benefit of Spirit of the Wolf for more speed.  It was somewhat of an ordeal<br/>
&gt;and I died twice trying to get through the minotaur pass, both times from<br/>
&gt;being stunned and disoriented as I tried to run through.  Without the work<br/>
&gt;and indulgence of the group I wouldn&#39;t have made it.  They even eventually<br/>
&gt;recovered all my belongings from my corpse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As a 10th level bard with a 10th level cleric friend I&#39;m getting more and<br/>
&gt;more interested in wider travel either alone or the two of us, but my fear<br/>
&gt;of the unknown keeps me from it.  It would be helpful to hear of the<br/>
&gt;adventures of other experienced travellers to help set my own expectations<br/>
&gt;properly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My fears are 1) getting lost, and 2) getting in overwhelming trouble from<br/>
&gt;getting into an area that&#39;s just too tough.<br/>
