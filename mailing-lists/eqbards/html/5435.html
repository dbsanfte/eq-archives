<div id="ygrps-yiv-525352114">Wow, sounds like it was a bad nite.  I actually didn&#39;t die, but I came close<br/>
to dying three times.  It was the first time I have used my squad ring more<br/>
than once in a playing session.  The first time I had zoned into RunnyEye,<br/>
to be greeted, and stunned by two dazed goblin guards.  I clicked my ring<br/>
for a heal and still only got out with only 5hp left.  Then as I returned<br/>
back from Rivervale I got into a disagreement when Broon decided I couldn&#39;t<br/>
cross the bridge in East Karana.  Used my ring and was down to 13hp&#39;s when I<br/>
hit the shortcut under the bridge after falling off the bridge while<br/>
stunned.  ran back to Rivervale, recharged ring and headed for Qeynos the<br/>
third time.  Running across Qeynos hills, I was jumped by Crumpy Irontoe?<br/>
Never seen or heard of him before.  He was beating me up pretty good thanks<br/>
to the help of a rabid grizzly.  Used the ring a third time and still only<br/>
had 9 hps after finishing off Crumpy.  That was one tough dwarf for only<br/>
having a rusty hammer on him.  Does he have any quest related purpose anyone<br/>
out there has heard wind of?<br/>

Damn, was last night everyone&#39;s night to die multiple times?  <br/>
I had my first triple-death night since I was trying to help<br/>
someone find and retrieve their corpse in Runnyeye 5 levels<br/>
ago.  Barely held onto 32.  I made the mistake of running back<br/>
to Cazic without a flute, and ended up stuck at the zone with<br/>
a train on one side and a bouncer on the other.  Sometimes<br/>
having a fast computer that zones quickly is not a good<br/>
thing...<br/>
