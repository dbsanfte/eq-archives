<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-803390936">I still disagree. I have both a ranger and a bard.<br/>
<br/>
In combat, my ranger<br/>
<br/>
Kicks<br/>
Taunts<br/>
Snares (once per mob)<br/>
Flame Licks occaisionally for additional taunt<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it. In the 23 levels of my ranger, I&#39;ve never had trouble<br/>
chatting while fighting, and I rarely miss a beat with any of my buttons.<br/>
<br/>
In combat my bard<br/>
<br/>
Sings song 1<br/>
Sings song 2<br/>
Sings song 3<br/>
Occasisionally sings song 4<br/>
Assists several times<br/>
Launches pet when charming<br/>
Targets all over the place to keep things charmed / mezzed<br/>
Switches Instruments if doing an all song attack<br/>
<br/>
In 47 levels, I&#39;ve never been able to get out a single sentance during<br/>
combat, unless it was 3 words or less.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of pure button pushing, if I push 2 buttons every 3-6 seconds, that<br/>
adds up to WAY more than pushing 2 buttons every 6-12 seconds (taunt and<br/>
kick refresh to the best of my recollection) with an occasional extra button<br/>
press to throw off a spell.<br/>
<br/>
Put it to the test, count the button pushes with your ranger in an average<br/>
60 second fight, vs those of your bard. Unless you&#39;re a 1 song wonder (which<br/>
I doubt) I&#39;d put my money on the bard every time to have more button pushes.<br/>

heh believe what you want.  I didn&#39;t say primary tank.  Rangers are NOT<br/>
primary tanks.  Rangers are 2ndary and as such they should ALWAYS watch<br/>
EVERYONE (including the bard) because they&#39;re the next best tank in the<br/>
group (unless there is an SK or Pally)<br/>
<br/>
Snare isn&#39;t quite as easy as you think unless you just don&#39;t bother snaring<br/>
every critter.  Its not easy to pop-target 6 mobs to make sure they&#39;re<br/>
snared then get back on the right one.  Trust me there is a LOT of button<br/>
pushing if you&#39;re a GOOD ranger, just like there is if you&#39;re a GOOD bard.<br/>
<br/>
Me and the bard I run with (when I&#39;m not playing my bard) have a blast.  I<br/>
pop-snare an entire room while they beat on me and he sings Largo&#39;s then he<br/>
AE fear&#39;s while AE dotting I beat up one at a time and we rake in XP hand<br/>
over fist.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t agree but obviously you have a different style with<br/>
your warrior than I do with my ranger.  As a Ranger I see it as my job to<br/>
make sure every un-engaged mob stays OFF every other party member and is<br/>
either rooted, snared or otherwise occupied so that the casters can do their<br/>
jobs without being killed (and a bard, in this case, is considred a caster<br/>
by me).<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line:<br/>
Bards have to time their button presses, others don&#39;t.  That does not mean a<br/>
bard is pushing more buttons.  And if your bard is pounding Sense heading<br/>
during combat then he&#39;s a fool.  The ranger CAN do it without reducing his<br/>
overall effectiveness, so he does.  In fact I&#39;ll sometimes even pop tracking<br/>
just to see what&#39;s around.  A bard can&#39;t do that while trying to twist 3<br/>
songs because of timing.  Does that mean a bard is hitting more buttons?<br/>
Nope, just means they have to time their button presses.  I don&#39;t so I tend<br/>
to pound buttons non-stop as a ranger.<br/>
<br/>
Matter of fact, I would say that when playing my ranger my fingers never<br/>
stop moving unless we&#39;re resting between fights.   Even then I&#39;m hitting<br/>
track now and then to see if a named has popped.<br/>

&gt; Sense Heading:  That goes for any character, not just rangers...  Perhaps<br/>
&gt; bard have a slightly higher int which would help a small amount.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Make sure you have the correct target?  What class doesn&#39;t have to do<br/>
that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Snare:  Not exactly tough to do, when you get the snare breaks message,<br/>
cast<br/>
&gt; it again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hit Kick: Yup<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Taunt: Why would you hit taunt all the time?  It only works when the<br/>
monster<br/>
&gt; is on someone else.  And again when it light up you hit it.  Very easy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keep an eye on casters:  I do this more as a bard than my roomate does as<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; warrior.  Why?  because he&#39;s the tank, I want to stay on the main monster,<br/>
&gt; let the extra mellees help the casters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No offense taken, but I can&#39;t disagree more with what you said.  My first<br/>
&gt; char was a warrior, who is the exact same thing, minus the snare...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hit Sense heading constantly to max skill<br/>
&gt; Make sure you have correct target<br/>
&gt; Make sure target stays snared (esp painful if there&#39;s a magician in the<br/>
grou<br/>
&gt; **curses all magicians and their stupid earth pets**)<br/>
&gt; Hit Kick when button recycles<br/>
&gt; Hit Taunt whenever button recycles (unless there is a warrior in the<br/>
group)<br/>
&gt; Keep an eye on the casters to make sure nothing jumps them.  If it does,<br/>
run<br/>
&gt; over, taunt it away and stick-root it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No offense guys.  I&#39;ve played 3 bards over 20th level (beta, test and<br/>
&gt; release server) (Beta to 30, Test to 51, Release server to 46) and, yes,<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; have a lot of button pushing to do.  But all other hybrids have it just as<br/>
&gt; bad, if not worse:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
