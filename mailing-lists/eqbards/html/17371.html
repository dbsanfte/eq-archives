<div id="ygrps-yiv-659866351">Hmm this arguement falls back to the misconception that stats affect all<br/>
classes equally.  It is possible that Stamina has a greater affect for<br/>
War/Rog/Monk/SK/PAL/RNG than it does for us.  Bards are not melee hybrids.<br/>
We&#39;re more of a cross between caster and melee than any of the other<br/>
hybrids.  In fact I&#39;d probably go so far as to say that Bards are more of a<br/>
Caster Hybrid than a Melee Hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my interpretation but it leads to my theory...<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that &quot;Caster&quot; classes get less benefit from stamina than<br/>
&quot;Melee&quot; classes.  Since the Bard class is &quot;less&quot; of a melee class than some<br/>
other classes it&#39;s possible that we don&#39;t see the benefit from stamina that<br/>
other classes do.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m currently *not* playing EQ because of the new EULA, and will not<br/>
play EQ until the new EULA is rescinded, I cannot test this theory on my 3<br/>
bards (one 11th, one 34th, one 50th) (yes, I have too much time on my<br/>
hands).   I have verified, as I levelled my shadowknight, ranger and rogue<br/>
up that Stamina has a great effect on their hitpoints.  Thus my<br/>
misconception that it would help us as well.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has a couple bards of various levels and could check this I<br/>
suspect we will find either 1 of 2 things:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Stamina has an effect on hitpoints with a greater return as you level<br/>
2)  Stamina has a constant effect on hitpoints which does not matter with<br/>
level<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure which will come up but I suspect that, given the responses I&#39;ve<br/>
seen here, bards do not get a stamina bonus (which I already know that<br/>
rogues and SK&#39;s do)<br/>
<br/>
Since EQ is based from AD&D you can see that in AD&D various classes got<br/>
more benefit from &quot;Constitution&quot; re &quot;Stamina&quot; than others.  I suspect that<br/>
the variance people are reporting re: Rog/War vs Bard have something to do<br/>
with that.<br/>
<br/>
Just a hunch though.  We&#39;ll need someone to verify through checkin&#39; it out<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s to hoping Verant comes to their senses so I can play again.<br/>
