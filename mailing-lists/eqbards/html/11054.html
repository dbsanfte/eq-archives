<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079017954">He watches over Wizards too, he just thinks they are a bunch of whiners who<br/>
don&#39;t realize their bolt spells can hit mobs in the Karanas that are not<br/>
even visible with clipping plane fully extended.  I targeted a beetle with<br/>
my bolt that was stationary walked out until I could no longer see it and<br/>
cast.  I was able to kill the beetle before it ever got to me without<br/>
rooting or moving it was so far away and so slow.<br/>

ps thanks to whoever the bard from this list who clued me in to the<br/>
ridiculouly slow speed of beetles.  It didn&#39;t help Kit a ton, but it sure<br/>
made Leagnomo&#39;s life easier!<br/>
