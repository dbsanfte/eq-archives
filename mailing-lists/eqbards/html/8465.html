&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;On Cazic-Thule.  I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s possible, but he <br/>
&gt; &gt;assured me again today that he does have them.  Either he&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt;misinformed, or the stones are already present in the world <br/>
&gt; &gt;and simply not well-distributed (relatively speaking).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I killed over 12 hill giants yesterday and a hand full of griffons.<br/>
&gt; Not one of them dropped a Lament Stone.  I killed some green fenes<br/>
&gt; too looking for a charm, nada.  I also killed the Gargoyles in LGuk <br/>
&gt; several times without seeing a Carapace and the shin froggies<br/>
&gt; without seeing greave or glove.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; None of these items are instated on the live servers.  However, they<br/>
&gt; are pretty common finds on said monsters on Test.  (ie. Aviak charms<br/>
&gt; from Avocets - that common)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  The only component currently in the game is the Lute of the Gypsy<br/>
Princess.  It&#39;s going to be quite humorous to see bards scrambling like mad<br/>
come tomorrow.<br/>
