<div id="ygrps-yiv-857044147">Yes, I noticed the same thing.  Anyone who has used this song for more than<br/>
a few months can tell you there is no way the resist rate was anywhere near<br/>
that high before.  Its pretty apparent that despite their claim to the<br/>
contrary, this is just giving us a message to show us a secret &#39;nerf&#39; that<br/>
they thought they slipped by us a while back.  I used to get 80% or so<br/>
success on this song when I first got it at 15th level and am still nowhere<br/>
near where GZ says the high level extra resist kicks in.  I have given up<br/>
using it as its too unreliable.  If we get in a situation now where before I<br/>
would have lullabied we just run.  I&#39;ve had too many deaths from depending<br/>
on a song that supposedly had not changed and yet no longer worked as well<br/>
as it did when I got it back in August or so.<br/>

I played a bit at lunch.  Now that we have a the<br/>
secondary resist message on Lullaby, it is<br/>
disturbingly easy to see just how incredibly<br/>
poorly lullaby works.  I was fighting groups of<br/>
faeries in lfay (that are barely blue to me) and<br/>
getting less than 50% success rate at lullabying<br/>
them.  This is with singing the song continuously<br/>
like GZ said we should.<br/>
