Well - Verant has gone to great extremes to try to balance this game (as to<br/>
whether one agrees how successful they are is another issue...)  Bug<br/>
exploitation in multi-player games can have a disastrous affect on the &quot;fun&quot;<br/>
that everyone else has in the game.  I have seen an online game destroyed by<br/>
a bug that wiped out the game economy.<br/>

Some people may feel that they are paying their $10/month a don&#39;t care about<br/>
anyone else&#39;s $10/month - but I for one am not one of them...<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t want to be specific about locations but there are certain<br/>
creatures<br/>
&gt; who get caught in walls when you lure them there and then you can slowly,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; surely, bellow them to death.  I haven&#39;t done it as much as I wanted to<br/>
