<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542559746">Speaking of Clouding - it has been failing big time lately by Mobs that<br/>
are now green to me in Mistmoore.  When I was in my mid-to-upper 20&#39;s - I<br/>
could sing it and get from the zone to the Graveyard completely unmolested.<br/>
The Initiates and what have you that spawn along the way would never be a<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
    Starting a couple weeks ago - they would go agro on me when singing<br/>
Clouding and when Regular (not Superior) Camouflage is cast on me.  This is<br/>
a major train generator.<br/>
<br/>
    It seems to me they upgraded these mobs see invis.  Someone I grouped<br/>
with theorized that some wandering mob casts see invis on them - but who<br/>
knows?<br/>
