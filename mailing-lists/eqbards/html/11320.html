<div id="ygrps-yiv-581408070">I had a similar experience when my wife&#39;s character died from a 131hp fall<br/>
near Blackburrow in Everfrost after zoning out of Permafrost (and if you<br/>
didn&#39;t know, that is across the zone).  I got into with the Guides and the<br/>
Prexus GM for days after they refused to ressurect her and I too was<br/>
basically &quot;accused&quot; of dragging the corpse in an indirect way.  Of course,<br/>
in the process it sounds like one of my mistakes was actually succeeding in<br/>
finding her corpse with my bard while waiting for our petition to go<br/>
through, although had I not found it, I don&#39;t think it would have made a<br/>
difference.  Here are some excerpts from some e-mails from Cailleach, the<br/>
Prexus GM, regarding the subject.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Greetings!  GM Cailleach here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In regard to your wife&#39;s character&#39;s death, please let me explain the<br/>
&gt; &gt; resurrection<br/>
&gt; &gt; policies. The reason I&#39;m doing this is so that you will see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; restrictions<br/>
&gt; &gt; guides are<br/>
&gt; &gt; under and hopefully, why they are under them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Resurrections are provided only for deaths where it can be verified by<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; guide, with the tools available to them, that the death was due<br/>
&gt; &gt; to a bug.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; refusing to perform a resurrection, they are not calling anyone a<br/>
&gt; &gt; liar, but they<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; are indicating to you that they must be able to verify the bug<br/>
&gt; &gt; objectively,<br/>
&gt; &gt; without resorting to anyone&#39;s word on it.  If they were to rely<br/>
&gt; &gt; solely on ANY<br/>
&gt; &gt; player&#39;s word, it would be a very short step from there to<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing favorites<br/>
&gt; &gt; with players, or just APPEARING to do so.  This is a very<br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult situation<br/>
&gt; &gt; to recover from, as you can guess.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In order to prevent even the appearance of favoritism, Verant built the<br/>
&gt; &gt; policies and procedures for guides so that they would have to be able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; determine by the location of the corpse, the appearance of the corpse,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; some other completely objective method to confirm the existence of a bug<br/>
&gt; &gt; causing the death, they have to refuse.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any situation reported by one player against another is also this way.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; have to personally witness the situation, OR have a report (created by<br/>
&gt; &gt; the player, using the /report &lt;playername&gt; command) that we know is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not subject to tampering, so that we can take action. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; personally encourage<br/>
&gt; &gt; players to send me a /tell when they have an emergency that requires one<br/>
&gt; &gt; of us to come and witness something.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In this situation, what I would have preferred to have the guide do is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; find the corpse, let you know where it was located, make sure it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; invisible to you, and maybe explaining the procedures a bit<br/>
&gt; &gt; better.  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; imagine why the corpse was warped so far away unless that is the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so-called<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &quot;safe point&quot; of that zone, though I don&#39;t believe it is.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AND Another<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Of course it upsets you, Jeff, but remember that we have to have objective<br/>
&gt; verification.  Now, keeping that in mind, think about this from the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>guide&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; point of view.  Their first observation is the corpse in its final<br/>
 </span></blockquote>location.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They<br/>
&gt; were not present to see where the character had been prior to the death,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nor<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is there any mechanism by which they can check that.  All they see is a<br/>
&gt; corpse in a location OTHER than the safe point (which they know very well<br/>
&gt; because it is where they &quot;zone into&quot; an area), which gives NO indication<br/>
&gt; whatsoever as to how the death occurred.  SO, what they would have to do<br/>
&gt; is to accept your word for it which they are PROHIBITED from doing, not<br/>
&gt; because you would lie to them, but because if they believe you, an honest<br/>
&gt; player,  and DON&#39;T believe a known scammer, in a situation where there<br/>
&gt; is no objective proof one way or another, the known scammer-type has<br/>
&gt; a legitimate case for claiming favoritism.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but it&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please keep in mind that the guides don&#39;t have the benefit of having made<br/>
&gt; all the observations you made by being there and therefore their<br/>
 </span></blockquote>conclusions<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; aren&#39;t going to be the same as yours without allowing for the scenario<br/>
&gt; above.  I&#39;m very sorry, because I do understand about having precious<br/>
&gt; little time to actually enjoy the game.<br/>

&gt; I believe he already stated he got into the lava because of going linkdead<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t he?  I don&#39;t want to read that whole long thing again.<br/>
&gt; Point is, the<br/>
&gt; GM&#39; / Guides won&#39;t even help get your corpse when you die from a bug.  I<br/>
&gt; actually had a guide accuse me of purposely dragging mobs to a<br/>
&gt; point where,<br/>
&gt; if I died, my corpse would fall beneath the world in W karana.  WTF?  Like<br/>
&gt; its hard to find a corpse in w karana near the q hills zone.<br/>

&gt; Why is it that people seem to have it in thier head that GM&#39;s and Guides<br/>
&gt; must help you if you cannot get<br/>
&gt; your corpse?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The ONLY reason they assist in corpse retreival is if it is stuck<br/>
&gt; in a wall.<br/>
&gt; Or fallen through the world.<br/>
&gt; Or lost due to a verifiable bug.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you fall in lava. It is YOUR responsibility to get it back. (Hope you<br/>
&gt; made friends)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To say that GM&#39;s are worthless cause they told you &quot;tough sh*t&quot; is lke<br/>
&gt; saying &quot;Dang. I cut my toe off with<br/>
&gt; this knife. Perhaps I should sue the hospital cause they can&#39;t put it back<br/>
&gt; on.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you plan to play around dragons, lava, gods. You SHOULD expect trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have died underneath Nagafen, but have still gotten my corpse.<br/>
&gt; I have had<br/>
&gt; guildmates lose thier corpses<br/>
&gt; on the other side of Fear. I have had guildmates lose corpses &quot;I forgot<br/>
&gt; where&quot; in Sol B. But they have all<br/>
&gt; been retrieved. No GM was even called because they all were of our own<br/>
&gt; doing. (Lag related or not).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What you need is a group of people that you can trust to assist<br/>
&gt; you when the<br/>
&gt; chips are down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps it is just me, but, if you lose your corpse in lava,<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t go crying<br/>
&gt; about the GM&#39;s not running to<br/>
&gt; your aid. They are not supposed to help you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Take responsibility of your own problems. If the problem is indeed a bug,<br/>
&gt; then by all means call a GM.<br/>
