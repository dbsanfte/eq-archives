<div id="ygrps-yiv-216802322">Hi<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please explain something to me? Can a bard use a shield? I<br/>
have seen quite a lot of bards with shields and they are saying that they<br/>
can use them and on the other side you are saying here that bards don&#39;t have<br/>
parrying. Doesn&#39;t that mean that we can&#39;t use shields? I allways thought<br/>
that parrying is the skill that you need if you want to use your shield. Ohh<br/>
yes and please no criticism that I should know that. Thanks for your<br/>
answers.<br/>

&gt; Monks get dodge and block (and riposte).  They don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; parry, which may be what block is for, but then we don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; parry either.<br/>
