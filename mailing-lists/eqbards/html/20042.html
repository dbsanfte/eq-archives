<div id="ygrps-yiv-606383003">Last Saturday morning I decided to return to Kunark<br/>
after two weeks of disasterous questing for lambant.<br/>
<br/>
As the ferries zoned into the TD zone, the top level<br/>
of each barge vapped and I was standing in the bottom<br/>
of the boat.<br/>
<br/>
As I tried to climb onto the big ship, I fell thru a<br/>
solid portion of the gangplank and into the water. <br/>
The ship took off at an incredible speed and I was<br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
No guild help coming, I did an /ooc request for a loc<br/>
and swam NW to an empty island.<br/>
<br/>
West 2 islands away is a spiroc camp (all conned red<br/>
to a 28 bard) and an ogre camp where the overthere<br/>
ship docks.<br/>
<br/>
I approached the dock using shaury&#39;s and saw a lot of<br/>
folks camping ogres.  Most conned blue and ... they<br/>
drop fine steel.<br/>
<br/>
I got killed once by a shaman, bigchief something or<br/>
other but on returning I found that I could walk out<br/>
to the end of the dock without getting attacked.  <br/>
<br/>
Running thru the overthere and FM zones to get bound<br/>
in FV was a breeze.<br/>
