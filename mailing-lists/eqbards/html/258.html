<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312090504">Recently, thanks to a disagreement with a Dark-Elf in the desert of Ro I<br/>
had to find another way to generate some cash. I wanted to happily hunt Fire<br/>
Beatles to fill my purse, an he wanting to happily paint the desert red with<br/>
my blood. Needless to say his cry to the effect of, &#39;You are not of a<br/>
experience to waste my time on, but I will still smight you&#39;, left me to ask<br/>
to leave, for I defiantly heard my mother calling me. never the less he<br/>
still wanted to play, but being a good boy I, while running, switched my<br/>
weapon and parrying dagger with my drum, both of which I keep in easy to<br/>
reach places, And began singing the Acceleration song. By the time I reach<br/>
the Southern Gate of Freeport I was bleeding profusely and close to a loss<br/>
of consciousness. But luckily I left my new found friend behind.<br/>
<br/>
	Not wanting to venture in to the desert till I was sure he had gone home,<br/>
and not wanting to go back to the over hunted Commonlands. I decided to get<br/>
my fishing pole out of the bank, and see how much I could roll the mer 3<br/>
Silver, 5 Copper I had into. In spent it all on bait @ 3 Copper per unit. I<br/>
then when to the dock, and straight into the water (I forgot I was still<br/>
playing my drum and singing the Acceleration song. After a quick swim I was<br/>
back on the docks again.<br/>
<br/>
	I than began to fish. Besides fish, I caught fish scales, rusted daggers,<br/>
and single tattered cloth sandals; which mad me wonder, if I fished in the<br/>
pool under the Academe of Magic would I find the stray magic ring, or in the<br/>
pool by the Hall of Truth would I get a combination sword of a stray piece<br/>
of plate? Any why, it was a profitable endeavor for the most part. I sold<br/>
the fish for just over 2 Silver each, Fish scales went for just 4 Copper<br/>
(still more than the cost of bait), and the other items sold for just over 2<br/>
silver each as well. I did lose my bait 2 times but I still had more than I<br/>
stated with approximately 1 Gold, 6 Silver for the hole trip. Making for 1<br/>
Gold, 1 Silver of pure profit, the greatest expense being 5 Silver and some<br/>
time, which I did not waste for I sang to keep my voice improving and<br/>
checking my direction to better my ability for when I really needed it.<br/>
<br/>
	So there where side benefits. I always try to capitalize on my down time,<br/>
like in the small bathing pool near the Theater of the Tranquil. I practice<br/>
my swimming without worry of Purina or sharks. I enter it and walk to the<br/>
back wall, when I reach it (either playing my drum or just singing a song<br/>
that will improve my abilities, I will then start to sing (and play, how I<br/>
do not know) and swim. &lt;OOC&gt; I then hit the auto-run key, sitting back and<br/>
watching my abilities increase.&lt;/OOC&gt; The only cost is food.<br/>
<br/>
	I placed part of the fishing profits back into bait to make more coin. The<br/>
only draw back was when the pole broke costing me around 2 Gold to replace.<br/>
But this is better than the drawback of a critical failure in say begging.<br/>
For once I hit the beg button by mistake to hear a guard say &quot;I will teach<br/>
you for your blasphemy!&quot; You think I said &#39;your grandmother wears Shadow<br/>
Knight&#39;s boots!&#39; Not politely asking for a spare copper or two. It was a<br/>
lesson I will long remember, for you can lose more than your pride by<br/>
begging... Al in All, by the end of my fishing trip I was ahead by 8 Gold<br/>
for 1 full days work.  Not as Profitable as hunting Fire Beatles in the<br/>
Desert of RO but a bit safer. For it also is not completely safe, for while<br/>
fishing a Shark popped out of the water to snap at my toes, I then went to<br/>
the raised area of the pier. Knowing my luck, they probably can jump; but I<br/>
digress...<br/>
<br/>
	I hope those near a good sized body of water think to buy a fishing pole<br/>
and keep it stashed away for those times you need a bit of safe coin. Like<br/>
after losing all ones possessions and having to start over. for one can<br/>
stomp a few rats to buy bait, then it is off to the water side so you can<br/>
get coin for a weapon (or be luckily enough to fish one out of the sea.<br/>
