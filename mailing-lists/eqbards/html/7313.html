&gt; &lt;Rumor alert!&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I heard was that Sierra canned the original concept of a<br/>
&gt; low-magic, harsh death world in-line with the Tolkien books.<br/>
&gt; And instead they&#39;re shooting for a high-magic lenient-death<br/>
&gt; world - i.e. a UO/EQ/AC clone.  This decision has supposedly<br/>
&gt; led to the entire original design staff opting not to stay<br/>
&gt; aboard.<br/>
<br/>
Which was probably a smart move if they want a mass market game. How the<br/>
developers thought they could make a fun game with no pk switch and<br/>
permanent death for characters is beyond me. (well it might be fun for<br/>
the kinds of people who get their jollys killing miners in UO)<br/>
