<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250925078"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; our group. A question here on the AE lifetap, is it a save vs magic or<br/>
&gt; something else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Lifetap series are based on Poison.  That&#39;s why they are so hard<br/>
  to resist, as most players have low poison resistances.<br/>
<br/>
  Not only do you take less damage with higher poison res, but you give<br/>
  the Maestro less tapped hp, making the battle go twice as fast.<br/>
<br/>
  Purifying is the way to go.<br/>
