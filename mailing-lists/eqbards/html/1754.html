&gt; Here is a thought and a story, maybe even a partial solution.  Perhaps the Mobs are<br/>
&gt; angry at you because you have been killing so many of their friends.  I was in North<br/>
&gt; Karanas around levels 11 through 14 killing beetles with my party.  We noticed an<br/>
&gt; odd effect which we called &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;.  It seems that after I had gone out to<br/>
&gt; fetch a dozen or so pincers, borers, and scythe bettles, that every beetle in the<br/>
&gt; zone became aggressive towards me, the fetching bard. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen this too. Thought it was a bug. I&#39;ve also had it happen in<br/>
Unrest when I pulled there. After a while I didnt even have to go into<br/>
the house, the mobs came to me for up to a half hour after the last time<br/>
I&#39;d pulled something. My group at the time was quite powerful, and hence<br/>
loved it, until we got 2 hags and other assorted mobs in one batch.<br/>

&gt; I have hunted in Crushbone and Befallen a lot, and I have noticed that I am a<br/>
&gt; preferred target, but not to the extent being reported in this thread. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to vary from zone to zone. I never had a huge problem in<br/>
Crushbone, but I have seen it in L3 of befallen and a few other bards I<br/>
talked to did as well. But in Befallen it seemed to be restricted to the<br/>
necromancers. My last time in Befallen I was at the back of the party,<br/>
not playing a song, when 3 necros down the hall past the elf skeleton<br/>
decided to open up with spells cast all on me, dispite the paladins and<br/>
clerics attacking them.<br/>
<br/>
Another place I&#39;ve seen weird effects just recently was in Solusek A<br/>
(eye). I was in a party and we were all invis&#39;d to go through to one of<br/>
the entrances to Nagafen&#39;s. 3 times in a row low level fire goblins (not<br/>
wizards or shamans) saw through my invisibility and attacted me. They<br/>
didnt see one other member of my party. It was like they could smell me<br/>
or something. I tried with the invisibility song and got the same<br/>
problem, and when I checked my buffer there was no &quot;you become visible&quot;<br/>
message before the mob attacked.<br/>
