<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519070055">I received an offer of a stone for 125pp last night. I told him good luck<br/>
getting that much, so he asked me how much I&#39;d pay. I said 15pp for loot<br/>
rights and 50pp to buy in a city. He, a 35th lvl monk, said that was<br/>
ridiculous because the stone came from a 30+ level mob. I countered with<br/>
&quot;yes, but they&#39;re lore. Can&#39;t carry too many of them around.&quot; I got no<br/>
response.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I refuse to buy ANY lambent stones on principle :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Same here... ultimately it&#39;s just a matter of time before I&#39;m able to<br/>
find<br/>
&gt; &gt; one myself (gotta love charm).  I&#39;d be willing to go as high as 25pp -<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; to save myself some time.  Unfortunately, more often than not, the<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; &gt; selling Lambent Stones (as noted previously, they generally tend to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; druids) are asking outrageous prices for an object they can&#39;t even use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, just be aware that the stones are not that rare on<br/>
&gt; giants.  Like I said, in a typical night of hunting giants,<br/>
&gt; everyone in my group will get a stone (we did this twice).<br/>
&gt; Given the rate they drop, I&#39;d value them at around 10-15pp.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;d have to be nuts to expect 150pp one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other classes can use the stones.  There is a quest for some<br/>
&gt; sort of staff that uses the stones, and the bard armor is not<br/>
&gt; no-drop so could be traded/twinked.  Dunno if other classes<br/>
&gt; can do the quests.  Still, I&#39;d expect it to soon become like<br/>
&gt; crafted armor, where the resulting armor sells for a little<br/>
&gt; above or even below the cost of the gems to complete the<br/>
&gt; quest.<br/>
