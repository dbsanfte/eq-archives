<div id="ygrps-yiv-822793830">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I figured out how to get my songs on the hotkeys <br/>
... even applied it to a magic user &quot;sister&quot; of mine. &lt;s&gt; <br/>
 I&#39;ve been running around Rivervale, twisting my little <br/>
heart out (working pretty good I think) and killing <br/>
everything in sight.<br/>
<br/>
I have one problem though ... none of the vendors like <br/>
me.  Any npc that will sell to me looks at me <br/>
&quot;apprehensively&quot;.  I went to every npc I could find and <br/>
found one that was disinterested ... but he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
(couldn&#39;t) sell to me.  So I&#39;m making crap money on my <br/>
loot.  At this rate, I&#39;m never gonna be able to even <br/>
afford songs, let alone any equipment (sewing kit & <br/>
patterns for example).<br/>
<br/>
So I need help!  Either, point me to someone in Rivervale <br/>
who will offer me decent prices or ...  If there isn&#39;t <br/>
anyone that fits that bill, then I think I need to move <br/>
on to Qeynos.  In that case, I need good directions from <br/>
Rivervale to Qeynos.  Every travel guide I&#39;ve found gives <br/>
the directions the opposite way around ... and they&#39;re <br/>
not easily reversed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
