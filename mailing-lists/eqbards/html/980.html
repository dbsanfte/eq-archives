&gt;	OK, someone clear thnigs up for me. There is endless discussion about<br/>
&gt;&quot;stacking&quot; songs, which I understand to be, conceptually, playing two songs<br/>
&gt;at once. Now since this is, by design, impossible, it requires some sort of<br/>
&gt;special trick. I gather from what I read that the process involves starting<br/>
&gt;one song, waiting for the effect to take place, stopping the song and<br/>
&gt;quickly starting another, waiting for its effect to take place, and then<br/>
&gt;stopping that one to renew the first, and so on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not impossible in the game..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;	My only question: You can&#39;t be serious, can you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yes, serious all right..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;	Do people really do this? I mean, the chances of actually seeing the<br/>
&gt;effect of both songs at once seems so small, and the amount of button<br/>
&gt;pressing seems so hectic in mele battle. I have tried it, and have failed<br/>
&gt;entirely to get it to even begin to work . . . I mean, sure, I have the<br/>
&gt;icon for both anthem and the healing song on my screen, but I hardly ever<br/>
&gt;actually get a heal out of it, and rarely is my strength actually higher<br/>
&gt;when I actually swing. This &quot;stacking&quot; basically eliminates any effect of<br/>
&gt;either song!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well 2 songs is one thing, but I used to stack 3 songs sometimes.<br/>
Well, some bards do it, but I don&#39;t normally stack or twist Hymn of <br/>
Restoration during combat. Usually I&#39;ll stack something that has an on-going <br/>
effect like Whistling Warsong and Anthem (both of those effects are on-going <br/>
as long as the icon is there). You get a pretty nice boost to stats while <br/>
they are both there. Try stacking them and check your stats. I also threw in <br/>
that song that lowers mob attack speed (i like that one)..I think it&#39;s level <br/>
21 song? Don&#39;t remember the name of it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;	I&#39;m just wondering if stacking is something that a few over zealous but<br/>
&gt;very talkative Bards write about a lot here, or something that a lot of you<br/>
&gt;take seriously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	I for one am going to save my fingers the busywork . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-Musil<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, not everyone does it or wants to do it. Suit yourself, I&#39;m sure you <br/>
make a fine bard either way. I do take it seriously though (we&#39;re not very <br/>
good fighters, I like to have every bonus I can get).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find it too much trouble either, as usually if i&#39;m not twisting I&#39;m <br/>
just standing there in auto-combat mode waiting for the computer to resolve <br/>
all the attack rolls.<br/>
