<div id="ygrps-yiv-657044688">Umm... You somehow want us to gather food and water for you? What sort of<br/>
help do you need? Are you referring to the fact that forage maxes at 40 for<br/>
bards? Keep in mind that we are travellers who like to end the journey at a<br/>
tavern or inn. Our interest in being able to gather nuts and berries to feed<br/>
on is rather low.<br/>
<br/>
	However, at level 20 I usually find no problem gathering up enough to tide<br/>
me over. I still carry some real food and water just in case I have a spot<br/>
of bad luck now and then though.<br/>
<br/>
	Good Journey,<br/>
