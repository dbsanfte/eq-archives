Here is a constructive idea that would likely make most bards happier,<br/>
return these songs to a being a viable option, and maintain Enchanters<br/>
current position with respect to crowd control.<br/>
<br/>
Make the songs in question require an instrument much the way that Sonorous<br/>
Clouding currently does.  Make a string instrument mandatory for Lucid<br/>
Lullaby and a wind instrument mandatory for Pixie Strike.  At the same time<br/>
remove the secondary resist that has rendered these spellsongs impotent.<br/>
<br/>
I think this change is in line with the bardic theme, makes the songs a<br/>
viable option, and maintains the necessary amount of balance over these<br/>
songs.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas?<br/>
