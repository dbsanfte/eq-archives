<div id="ygrps-yiv-865585493">I was at the SoV launch party this weekend in Vegas.  I got a chance to talk<br/>
to a couple of the live team folks and quized them on the changes to the<br/>
Jonthan&#39;s series.  If you have not heard they are removing the rune<br/>
component and making the song self only (like the level 7 Jonthan song).<br/>
They are also greatly buffing the haste, defense, and attack bonuses of the<br/>
song.  The goal, they said, was for these songs to allow bards to actually<br/>
*tank*.  Should be interesting to see how they change.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, had a chance to quiz GZ on the songs this weekend at <br/>
&gt; eqfest 2000 in<br/>
&gt; Houston, TX.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pixe and such, are being/have been changed, during the <br/>
&gt; patches that are<br/>
&gt; going live...he wasn&#39;t specific on it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LULLABYE WILL BE CHANGED!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; GZ: &quot;Look for some VERY interesting things to be happening to <br/>
&gt; Lullaby soon&quot;<br/>
&gt; GZ: &quot;We have been thinking about bard mez, we didn&#39;t want <br/>
&gt; them to infringe<br/>
&gt; on the Enchanter role, as that is what Enchanters do best, <br/>
&gt; BUT we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think that giving bards some mez abilities will hurt&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These are not exact quotes, but pretty close.<br/>

&gt; p.s. One helluva weekend, even if it felt like being in the Karana&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; EQFest 2000 was a blast!<br/>
&gt; Check out eq.stratics.com and watch the official eq site for news!<br/>
&gt; Thanks Ron!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, supposedly no.  However the spdat.eff file did get <br/>
&gt; patched last<br/>
&gt; &gt; weekend when I logged in.  They can also change some spell <br/>
&gt; effects in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; database without taking the servers down.  I think this <br/>
&gt; might actually<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; gone in with the last patch and may have either been <br/>
&gt; unintentional, or<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; may be trying it out to see if they see any unbalancing <br/>
&gt; effects from it<br/>
&gt; &gt; being live before they announce that it is live.  That way <br/>
&gt; if they have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; change it fewer people will notice.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t think the server I am on (E&#39;ci) has gone down for the <br/>
&gt; scheduled<br/>
&gt; server<br/>
&gt; &gt; maintenance Abashi mentioned.  Haven&#39;t noticed any downloaded files<br/>
&gt; either.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kitasi and I play on the same server so thats why I was <br/>
&gt; wondering if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; patch went in unannounced.<br/>

&gt; &gt; has either your server gone down or have you downloaded any <br/>
&gt; new files?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; if not, then it is impossible.<br/>
