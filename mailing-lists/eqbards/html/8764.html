<div id="ygrps-yiv-678003560">I have inside sources that say she may have been taken off the server for<br/>
a little moment to fix a bug with the vendor.  This was evident because I<br/>
heard that people who can track her often see her name as !Genni which<br/>
signifies a broken NPC.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Genni is definately in the temple, I don&#39;t remember the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;location, but I was able to deal with him.  He&#39;s in a seperate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;location from the bards.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; SHE is on the third floor next to Ostorm.  She sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; roams around tho.  Has anyone else noticed that the keepers<br/>
&gt; &gt; change race/sex fairly often?  Freaky.  Maybe they just<br/>
&gt; &gt; rotate around the Temple.  Genni definitely stays female<br/>
&gt; &gt; erudite. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmmm.  I&#39;ve spent about 2 hours looking for Genni, both times with other<br/>
&gt; bards there as well, and none of us found Genni on Karana.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Apparently, she CAN be tracked, but nobody has found her through<br/>
&gt; tracking either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She wasn&#39;t near Ostorm either.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;m just really dumb, but more likely she&#39;s stuck in a wall or<br/>
&gt; something on Karana.  Hrm.  <br/>
