<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045202782">ROFL, thats kinda funny.<br/>
<br/>
You say the word &quot;alt&quot; in Paradigm and you better be prepared for flames,<br/>
insults and outright warfare.<br/>
One or two people have switched mains but its VERY rare, and a couple people<br/>
have left the guild because they wanted to switch and were told no.  Another<br/>
two have almost gotten kicked out as well.<br/>
<br/>
Its interesting, people say &quot;well you are in Paradigm (or any other high<br/>
level guild) you must have great equip for you and your alts.&quot;  But fact is,<br/>
there is little to none alt equiping.  If a Trak bp drops and no mains need<br/>
it goes in the bank.  Even if your alt is level 60 (and we have quite a few<br/>
of those).  We tried to work out a system where people could use their raid<br/>
points ot buy items from teh bank for their alt but that was shot dead too.<br/>
<br/>
So, Tani will never be a main =/  Interesting how guilds perceive things<br/>
differntly :P<br/>

&gt; Wow hits in the 90&#39;s, I&#39;d love to do that so much, my highest hit is<br/>
&gt; something like 48...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Speaking of helping each other out... Does anyone else get <br/>
&gt; all excited when<br/>
&gt; someone decides to play their bard as their main in the <br/>
&gt; guild? or recruit a<br/>
&gt; new bard?  One of our old time clerics came out of retirement <br/>
&gt; and has been<br/>
&gt; powerleveling his bard up, and is now level 45.  Now to me <br/>
&gt; this is great<br/>
&gt; news as I&#39;ve been the only bard in the guild for the longest <br/>
&gt; time and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; only 53 (forever) and have gone on a few raids and have been <br/>
&gt; only crowd<br/>
&gt; control (which i love doing but get nervous sometimes). <br/>
&gt; Example of this<br/>
&gt; would be in Air when all chanters drop and I&#39;m only one left <br/>
&gt; standing trying<br/>
&gt; to mez the azaracks, or last week in PoG with only chanter <br/>
&gt; there is only<br/>
&gt; there for haste and C2 (btw i love pulling in pog and intercepting the<br/>
&gt; protectors of growth!).  We&#39;ve got another bard as well that is 51 and<br/>
&gt; leveling pretty fast.  Its kind of nice, we&#39;re a tight circle <br/>
&gt; and do as many<br/>
&gt; hand me downs on gear between us as we can.  I had no idea <br/>
&gt; the new bard was<br/>
&gt; 45 allready, so now hand me downs are going to be a wider <br/>
&gt; circle. I cant<br/>
&gt; wait for them both to hit 53 and get twilight.  Oh and <br/>
&gt; instruments, the<br/>
&gt; guild went to sirens grotto other night and the 51 bard got <br/>
&gt; himself a new<br/>
&gt; immaculate horn or whatever its called and a drums of the beast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, I&#39;m just saying its nice that people help each other <br/>
&gt; out as much as<br/>
&gt; possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m rambling on but hey, I&#39;m in a good mood cause I&#39;ve had my <br/>
&gt; first coffee,<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve had a long week, its finally friday and I finally got my <br/>
&gt; stupid HS key<br/>
&gt; last night woot. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have a great weekend everyone 8)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks, Shada! I had already put my flute up. I&#39;ll probably <br/>
&gt; dump the Vox<br/>
&gt; horn next time I&#39;m near a bank too. Looks like I will keep my <br/>
&gt; Lath Drinor in<br/>
&gt; my offhand. I was using it and a Croaking dagger. I have been <br/>
&gt; seeing melee<br/>
&gt; hits for up to 80 some. Klaget said he saw a 90 while we were <br/>
&gt; in Skyshrine<br/>
&gt; last weekend, so the epic really helped out my melee. Before, <br/>
&gt; my best hits<br/>
&gt; were in the 50s max.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Slyde: Gratz on the new weapon! I have never seen one of <br/>
&gt; those and we have<br/>
&gt; spent alot of time in HS south. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Atonal, I personally don&#39;t have a char around 35, I have a 45 <br/>
&gt; wiz and a 24<br/>
&gt; cleric. Some good friends of mine are around 40 though (or <br/>
&gt; were this past<br/>
&gt; weekend, may be higher now). If we&#39;re not on, try looking for <br/>
&gt; Delania/Chubb.<br/>
&gt; Chubb is a shaman pl&#39;ing his rogue, Delania, on a second account. He&#39;s<br/>
&gt; usually in CoM. Tell him you&#39;re a pal of mine looking for a <br/>
&gt; group. Chubb<br/>
&gt; keeps saying he wants his own bard! We may be able to group <br/>
&gt; when I play my<br/>
&gt; wiz, which I am going to concentrate on getting her out of 45 <br/>
&gt; in the near<br/>
&gt; future. Link to our guild message board:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub8.ezboard.com/bvenatorsapentia.">http://pub8.ezboard.com/bvenatorsapentia.</a> Drive by and say <br/>
&gt; hello to all the<br/>
&gt; crazy people! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Scales: Work on your epic quest and do all the one group, one <br/>
&gt; person parts.<br/>
&gt; Having that stuff done ups your chances of getting priority <br/>
&gt; on a scale drop.<br/>
&gt; As to guilds, well VS doesn&#39;t really have the numbers on at <br/>
&gt; any one time to<br/>
&gt; kill a dragon. What we do have is alliances with other guilds <br/>
&gt; in the same<br/>
&gt; boat. Alliances are sorta like marriages though so you do <br/>
&gt; have to do some<br/>
&gt; checking on the partner first. The easiest way is to make <br/>
&gt; friends in other<br/>
&gt; guilds and help anyone you can do their epic battles. I know <br/>
&gt; we are on a<br/>
&gt; serious Gore watch right now for Reorn to get his Frost tome. <br/>
&gt; If I&#39;m on,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll try and look for you guys when we get our next shot. I <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t promise<br/>
&gt; you will get the scale but meeting people who can and do kill dragons<br/>
&gt; regularly is a good thing! When we went to kill Trak for me <br/>
&gt; the second time,<br/>
&gt; it looked almost like a HL lemming rush. I was not minded to <br/>
&gt; turn any one of<br/>
&gt; my friends away and so many wanted to come help. We like <br/>
&gt; killing dragons,<br/>
&gt; and we like helping people we know to be good people do their <br/>
&gt; epic quests.<br/>
