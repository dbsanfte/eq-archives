<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-25866274">Well I tried to get a Guise this past weekend but was unsuccessful.  When I<br/>
got to Lower Guk there was a party camping the assasin room and several<br/>
people in the group didn&#39;t have a Guise yet and were unwilling to let me<br/>
purchase looting rights.  They even laughed when I offered to give PP for<br/>
it.  At their level PP was worthless.  One of them told me he would have<br/>
considered letting me loot the Guise if I had something of value to trade<br/>
him.  The problem with this is that there aren&#39;t too many items a 25th level<br/>
player can obtain that a 35+ level player doesn&#39;t already have.  Guess I<br/>
will just have to wait until I&#39;m in my 30s and get one for myself.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; 		Thats a good idea.  I&#39;m certain that with either my charm or<br/>
&gt; my cash,<br/>
&gt; 		someone will let me loot the Guise.  My main concern though<br/>
&gt; is not getting<br/>
&gt; 		killed while I&#39;m down there.  Any suggestions on how a 24<br/>
&gt; bard can pull this<br/>
&gt; 		off?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		&gt; Step number one, if you get down there and a group is<br/>
&gt; camping the mob that<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; drops the guise<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; (Assassin? I don&#39;t remember) is to just ask if they would<br/>
&gt; mind if you<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; looted it.  Be creative,<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; offer to sing them a song or something in exchange for it.<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		&gt; Chances are, they&#39;re nice people who all have masks anyway<br/>
&gt; and just want<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; to pull Serrated Bone<br/>
&gt; 		&gt; Dirks and they&#39;ll happily let you loot the mask if you<br/>
&gt; entertain them.<br/>
