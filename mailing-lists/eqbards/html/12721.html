<div id="ygrps-yiv-565097678">I believe this is not intelligent mob behavoir but instead<br/>
bad dungeon pathing.  13/14 might be a few levels too low imho<br/>
to be trying for this also.<br/>

&gt; I am dual posting this on the EQ Bard and EQ Cleric list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My group was in upper Guk yesterday trying to get to the squire.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First of all any advice?   I cannot seem to make it to him without<br/>
&gt; hitting multiple Gazz spawns (and a Ton Warrior).  I seem to remember<br/>
&gt; being able to get to him failry easily way back in my troll warrior<br/>
&gt; days.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We also ran into a repeated problem of a Froglok Apprentice, who would<br/>
&gt; agrro on our warrior (lvl 13, rest of us are 14).  This is nothing<br/>
&gt; unusal, however this wily frog would hit our puller with a DD spell,<br/>
&gt; then Run and get help (the circular room before the room with all the<br/>
&gt; weird scoffolding).  We would never do a point of damage to him before<br/>
&gt; he ran.  <br/>
&gt; The only counter we had to this was for me to go pulling with the<br/>
&gt; warrior so I could stun then root the appretince (and then let my pet<br/>
&gt; smush it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I found this pretty bizarre (intelligent) mob behavior.  Is this<br/>
&gt; normal?  Any better ideas of how to deal with it (having your only<br/>
&gt; healer go on a pull is not a real great idea, IMHO)<br/>

&gt; We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
