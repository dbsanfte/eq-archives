<div id="ygrps-yiv-740924001">does make sense that it would be a sea zone, but isnt there also a bar in<br/>
qeynos called Seafarer&#39;s tavern or something like that?   Hmmm maybe it will<br/>
be something like oh i dunno, an improved enduring breath song hehe.  gotta<br/>
make our gloves like the rest of the SS armor: useless 8)<br/>
<br/>
It is nice that they finally smartened up and got off their &quot;works as<br/>
intended&quot; routine and actually did something for us.  Must be Absor&#39;s doing.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry just being a pain in the butt, i forgot it was patch day and didnt get<br/>
my fix of eq this morning, that and well work, sucks like usual<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Info for Bards from Patch Message.<br/>

<br/>
Found this burried in todays&#39; Patch Message:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered<br/>
parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates,<br/>
though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer&#39;s tune.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First thing that came to mind...&quot;two score and nine&quot; == 49.<br/>
<br/>
Songs like we just got our 49th song, and they hid it in a quest or in a sea<br/>
zone (spell merchie on &#39;clops island in OOT comes to mind).  Hope it&#39;s good!<br/>

Heh, had a great time in MM last night, we got lucky, got 3 mm drums, 3<br/>
quest lutes, 1 real lute, 3 werewolf talons :)<br/>
