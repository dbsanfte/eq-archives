&gt; I don&#39;t recall seeing a resistance message ever for a partially resistable<br/>
&gt; spell like Direct Damage (DD) ones.  However, when the caster hits me and my<br/>
&gt; health bar doesn&#39;t move from a spell that can do up to 40 points, I know I<br/>
&gt; took at most 3 or 4, I don&#39;t have that many hp&#39;s so the bar movement is<br/>
&gt; still pretty visible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm.  I wish they&#39;d change it so you could immediately see how<br/>
much damage you take from a spell.  The caster gets to see how<br/>
much damage he did, why can&#39;t you see how much damage you<br/>
took?<br/>

&gt; all I seldom take any measurable damage from spells, but then again my MR is<br/>
&gt; jacked up pretty high for my level.  Since it is unlikely to improve much at<br/>
&gt; this point, barring increased song effects, I will undoubtedly have more<br/>
&gt; trouble at higher levels.  113 vs a hag probably isnt anywhere near as good<br/>
&gt; as having 70 somethin against lvl 15-17 casters.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m right and most DD spells check your fire<br/>
or cold resist.  You can&#39;t raise those as high since the Psalm<br/>
series does not stack with Elemental or Purifying Rhythms.<br/>
Everything seems to stack with Guardian Rhythms.<br/>
