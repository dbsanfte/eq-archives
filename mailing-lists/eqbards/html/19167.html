<b>Subject:</b> dueling magicians <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-259271504">A magician in my guild has been bragging for several<br/>
days now about how great he is.  He&#39;s dueled several<br/>
players in my guild that are 2-3 lvls higher and<br/>
defeated them (one was killed by his pet;-( )<br/>
<br/>
Anyway as I approach 30th lvl I expect to be<br/>
challenged by this guy and, since his attitude really<br/>
gets me going anyway, *really* don&#39;t want to lose...<br/>
<br/>
I have never dueled...I am more into the group and<br/>
make friends aspect of this game.  <br/>
<br/>
So far I figure pixie strike, song of siriens guardian<br/>
and elemental rythmns will be my main songs....weapons<br/>
are a T claw and gnoll hide lariet.  (I also have a<br/>
silvery axe but figure stunning is a good thing with a<br/>
caster....)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
