 </span></blockquote>  You are in the minority I can assure you.  If you enjoy fishing,<br/>
  baking, brewing, telling stories around the campfire, then that&#39;s<br/>
  your POV.  I&#39;m not gonna waste 10bux a month to essentially IRC<br/>
  with pretty graphics.  I want to advance, I want to have some<br/>
  goodies, and I want to show those goodies off to people because<br/>
  I spent the time to earn them.  I want to be a powerful element<br/>
  to plane attacks and dragon raids.  I was in a group last night<br/>
  that dinged two L49 people to L50.  L50 people are turning out like<br/>
  mad.  I&#39;m feeling the crunch too.  Nagafen&#39;s Lair and Lower Guk<br/>
  are becoming so crowded that it&#39;s rare to even see monsters, let<br/>
  alone fight them.  I know for a fact that there are at least 100<br/>
  L50 people on Innoruuk and we add one more avg each day it seems.<br/>
  When 1/16th of your server&#39;s population is 50, and probably another<br/>
  3/16th is L35+ that spells trouble and crowding.  Trying to squeeze<br/>
  a quarter of the server into two zones really hurts.<br/>
<br/>
  The whole premise behind your posts is what makes you, yourself<br/>
  happy.  I honestly find your selfish ripostes to comments about<br/>
  the whole community very weak and one sided.  What I didn&#39;t miss <br/>
  is your careless attitude, however.  Whatever makes silky&#39;s 10<br/>
  dollars count isn&#39;t why I play the game, btw.  And while I respect<br/>
  anyone&#39;s opinion including yours, you are very much lacking the<br/>
  delivery of your opinion in an organized, non-offensive manner. <br/>
  It&#39;s like you&#39;ve got something to prove about yourself, and at<br/>
  the same time you trying to disprove any statement that comes <br/>
  down the pipe.  It&#39;s a rare day to see you post complimenting <br/>
  anything.  I suppose I can continue wishing. 8)<br/>
