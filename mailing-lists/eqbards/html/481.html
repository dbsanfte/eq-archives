&gt; I have searched all of High Hold Keep and have yet to find the song.  In my<br/>
&gt; frustration I moved out of the keep into the pass, and subsequently died to<br/>
&gt; a VERY nasty Dark Elf NPC in one of the Inns.  I realize this is requesting<br/>
&gt; a spoiler, but when I died to the NPC last night I lost my level, and am<br/>
&gt; pretty frustrated at this point.  E-mail privately if you wish.<br/>

zone.  I won&#39;t say where it is inside, but this should get you there.<br/>
