GS: In general, what&#39;s new in Shadows of Luclin? Verant has stated before<br/>
that if it were to make another expansion pack after Scars of Velious, it<br/>
would be more along the lines of the first expansion, Ruins of Kunark, in<br/>
that it would have an all-new playable race and other low-level features. As<br/>
such, is Shadows of Luclin designed primarily for new players? <br/>
<br/>
JB: Luclin will include a new player-character race (Kerran), class<br/>
(Beastlord), and starting city, along with all-new player-character models<br/>
and textures, DirectX 8 support including hardware T&L, and at least 25 new<br/>
adventure zones. It is designed for players of all levels<br/>
