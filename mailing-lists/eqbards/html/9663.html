<b>Subject:</b> Problem with Anthem de Arms? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297137972">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a level 12 bard.  Picked up a slightly used Ashenwood Spear today (no<br/>
haste left), but when I&#39;m singing the Anthem de Arms, someone in my group<br/>
whose weapons have a slower delay than mine are attacking much faster than I<br/>
am.  (I&#39;m del 22, she had a del 28 weapon).  It was almost as if she had<br/>
haste cast on her or something, and I wasn&#39;t getting any effect at all from<br/>
the song.  This went on for a couple hours, so I know she didn&#39;t have<br/>
another spell on her. :)  When I solo, my del decreases normally.  Maybe I<br/>
AM attacking faster, but I still can&#39;t figure out WHY someone with a slower<br/>
weapon than me would be attacking A LOT faster than I am.  It appeared as<br/>
though her del had dropped down to at least 15, if not lower!  I don&#39;t mind,<br/>
we chewed through mobs really fast :) it just strikes me as odd.<br/>
<br/>
(oh, and I WISH there was a way to recharge items like the spear. :))</div>
