Subject: Re: [eqbards] OT: A Warning...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There may be a few problems with all of this logic.  First off, there has<br/>
already been a court case in California (of course, the state with the<br/>
most lawyers per capita) that has deemed an everquest account not to be<br/>
property.  Given the tendency of most courts not to overturn previous<br/>
rulings, accounts will most likely continue to be considered as such. <br/>
Therefore, banning (or taking away the account) cannot be treated in most<br/>
of the aforementioned ways.<br/>
<br/>
The only one left is the contestation that Verant&#39;s &quot;for any reason&quot;<br/>
clause does not give them the legal right to terminate service.  This<br/>
could be connected, in this case, to the free speech issue.  The first<br/>
argument, however, that she has the write to express whatever she wishes<br/>
in a traditional public forum is moot--she can, and did.  The question<br/>
remains as to whether Verant has the right to terminate service for such.<br/>
<br/>
There is little or no analogy between the first amendment and the<br/>
fourteenth (or so-called equal protection clause) in constitutional law. <br/>
They are considered and reasoned differently, and have very different<br/>
methods of application.  The first amendment can only very rarely be<br/>
applied to private entities, and only in very specific ways.  Extending<br/>
the first amendment to a right of service is even more tenuous.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the rights of service connection may even be less grounded than<br/>
the extension of the EULA and Rules of Conduct.  The supposed post, even<br/>
if not the correct post, would likely have violated the rules of conduct<br/>
in several ways, had it been expressed in any part on a Verant, Sony, or<br/>
989 affiliated mode of communication.   Furthermore, there is no<br/>
limitation within the snowball.com terms of service that they cannot<br/>
provide content to affiliated entities (i.e. Verant).  Once the material<br/>
has been given to Verant, Snowball&#39;s liability clause authorizes other<br/>
entities (Verant) to do commence actions which may prevent Snowball from<br/>
being prosecuted for said liabilty.  Now, this is not exactly my interest<br/>
in law--really, I know next to nothing about liabilty law--but the<br/>
actions I see can all fit into this framework, with a little bit of legal<br/>
fanangling.  I&#39;m certainly not saying this is right (heck, if Verant saw<br/>
some of my private stories, they could possibly ban me, who knows?), but<br/>
it may be more legally sound than it looks.<br/>
<br/>
One last tidbit for the faithful...it has been quoted to me that there is<br/>
a legal representative on the council that makes banning decisions. <br/>
You&#39;d think even a Verant lawyer would know enough about covering one&#39;s<br/>
ass to not have made a huge mistake here.<br/>
