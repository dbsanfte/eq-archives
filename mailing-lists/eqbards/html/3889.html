<div id="ygrps-yiv-359655994">It&#39;s not broken - but it works very differently fighting named mobs vs<br/>
generic mobs.<br/>
<br/>
Consider this - you got killed and are running somewhere to get your corpse.<br/>
Con something - low green - easy thing you ever killed.  But you have no wep<br/>
and are nekkid.  It still cons easy but you know you would die.<br/>
<br/>
So - that works in reverse.  You con Dorn or Gix and they are green. Well,<br/>
that&#39;s how they are NOT considering their armor, spells, mana, buffs etc.<br/>
<br/>
I was hanging around Hogcallers Inn and these evil types were killing lady<br/>
Shae and the bard in the back room.  Me and a mid 20&#39;s were there trying to<br/>
get them to stop.  Well, they would not and it got down to the taunting and<br/>
duel threats.  So one cons white to me and the other cons risky blue.<br/>
Neither of them will take a duel from the 20+ person.  I am kinda chicken<br/>
cuz I know they will cheat and his friend will heal him in the duel or what<br/>
ever.  So the 20+ tells me - here let me buff you then you duel them - cuz<br/>
she knows they will con me as an easy kill.<br/>
<br/>
While we never got to duel, cuz Shae spawned and they attacked and while<br/>
they fought her the bard spawned and attacked.  The troll gated and the DE<br/>
killed Shae and the Bard but went down to 1 bub of hp.  While he medded, I<br/>
ran up stairs and sent Pandos (Lady Shae&#39;s drwavin bodyguard for some<br/>
muffins (tell him the right words and he runs for muffins) then when he was<br/>
in the doorway I hailed him so he stops.  Now the DE decides to boogy and<br/>
walks out.  Pandos goes KOS and we chase the DE thru the streets of Freeport<br/>
yelling coward! coward!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow - after laughing that one off. I finally look at my stats. HOLY<br/>
BUFFAMOLY Batman!  I had over 800 hp!  That was some awesome buff she gave<br/>
me!  I would have been one of them really nasty greens had I actually dueled<br/>
him!<br/>
<br/>
So, some of the named NPC&#39;s have the really good spells and super buffs.<br/>
They are going to fight way different than they con.<br/>

		You can say that again, Bob.<br/>
<br/>
		When Dvinn finally conned Green to me, I thought, &quot;Heh heh,<br/>
payback, inkie!&quot;<br/>
		and went in the tower and waited for him, tapping my sword<br/>
in my hand.<br/>
<br/>
		He spawns. I con to make sure &quot;green&quot; just before he leaps<br/>
upon me... and<br/>
		proceeds to thoroughly and quickly, and neatly, destroy me.<br/>
Instead of<br/>
		taking 4 seconds to die to him when I was lower level,<br/>
instead, it took<br/>
		about 15 seconds (smile).<br/>
<br/>
		The /con system is either broken, or intentionally left to<br/>
mislead you. I<br/>
		believe Verant intends you to &quot;con&quot; critters by actually<br/>
fighting them,<br/>
		rather than relying upon a computer to tell you the exact<br/>
level your<br/>
		opponent may be. Lately, the only reason I con something is<br/>
to see if I will<br/>
		get experience or not. Otherwise, to me, Conning is a<br/>
complete and utter<br/>
		waste of time.<br/>
