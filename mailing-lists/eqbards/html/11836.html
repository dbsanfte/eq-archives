<div id="ygrps-yiv-777436988"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As a fellow bard I am faced with a great duel in less than a months time.<br/>
&gt; This duel will be fought between a level 30-33 bard and a similarly<br/>
&gt; leveled ranger.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also some thoughts... am I expected to lose?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Yes, you are expected to lose.  Women don&#39;t like it when their<br/>
  soon-to-be husband, in this case, beats the stuffing out of them.<br/>
  Put up a challenging fight and go down in the 3rd round.  Don&#39;t<br/>
  bite her ear off either. 8)<br/>
