<br/>
Chain (stops fleeing ghouls, drybones, werebats, monks)<br/>
Accelerando (ZONE! ZONE NOW!  Breaks root too)<br/>
invisibility (watch the train go by as your casters med)<br/>
Lullaby (when you pull more than you meant to)<br/>
Elemental Rhythms (fire and magic resists)<br/>
<br/>
And of course the old standbys, Anthem and Hymn.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
of some people using Binding to lower the AC of mobs so that<br/>
lower level people in the party have an easier time hitting<br/>
stuff that&#39;s red to them.  It&#39;s area effect though so be<br/>
careful with it.<br/>

If you have Charm, keep it handy for the occasional kill<br/>
stealer.  The hand and barkeep tend to attract a lot of<br/>
attention if you pull them out into the lawn.<br/>
