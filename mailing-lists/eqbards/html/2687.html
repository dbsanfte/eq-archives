<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-215015477">Just wanted to let everyone know there is a new bard quest in Kelethin.<br/>
I haven&#39;t completed it yet so don&#39;t know what it does.  I hadn&#39;t been to<br/>
Kelethin since I was 15th level (now 17th) so don&#39;t know how long it has<br/>
been there.  I assume it was added with the most recent patch.  I<br/>
subscibe to the digest so if this is already old news I&#39;m sorry.<br/>

Bard and Master Brewer on E&#39;ci</div>
