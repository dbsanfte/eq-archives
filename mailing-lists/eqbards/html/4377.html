<div id="ygrps-yiv-481929521">In general I agree completely, that is why I didn&#39;t buy the gloves.  <br/>
     Having said that there was one situation where HtH was very useful.  <br/>
     In a two person group where your partner is a caster.  You need to <br/>
     tank to keep the mob off the caster but (s)he has decided that your <br/>
     more effective with you instruments equipped.  It worked amazingly <br/>
     well for 3 hours, a level, and 20pp.  (I did minimal damage with HtH <br/>
     but that wasn&#39;t the point)  Amazing how many different wrinkles to <br/>
     this game I keep discovering...<br/>

Have you ever tried hand to hand combat?  Go into a newbie zone and pick a <br/>
fight with an orc pawn or a gnoll pup.  They cant hurt you because of your <br/>
ac and your hp rebuilds faster than they can damage you.  But you will be <br/>
punching them for 1 point of damage.  Now you should be getting into groups <br/>
where they are attacking monsters that are so much higher than you that your <br/>
normal weps are having trouble damaging them.  Your role in that case will <br/>
be equiping an instrument and playing songs. So magic gloves and hand to <br/>
hand combat with monsters that you can barley hit with a Dirk or Combine are <br/>
not gonna do any good.  Even lower level monsters that your regular weps can <br/>
hit will be hitting you and your party pretty hard.  If you are in the <br/>
melee, you will be at risk of getting stunned and not having your songs be <br/>
used all of the time.  And you will get beat up for no gain.  My 2cp &lt;g&gt;<br/>
     <br/>
You would be better off standing off outside of melee and supporting your <br/>
party 100% of the time (no stuns to interupt you).<br/>

p.s. I could be wrong - I have only had 2 or 3 partys and monster combos <br/>
where I was able to do this stand off support role.  but I have done the h2h <br/>
combat thing and it was pitiful!<br/>

                     The other day someone offered me Black iron gloves.  He<br/>
claimed that <br/>
                     they gave you the ability to punch magical only<br/>
creatures.  Low AC, no <br/>
                     stat adjustment, 5lb weight and high price dissuaded me<br/>
from buying <br/>
                     them.   I&#39;ve been thinking (ouch) though,  maybe they<br/>
would be handy <br/>
                     for those times that you play support bard and<br/>
contribute some kung fu <br/>
                     to the fight.  What do you all think?<br/>

                I&#39;ve been searching (on Veeshan) for one of these for 3<br/>
weeks now in various <br/>
                zones and continents. The *only* time someone was selling<br/>
one and replied to <br/>
                me was for 75pp. I&#39;m sorry, but magical or not - I&#39;m not<br/>
paying 75pp for a <br/>
                friggin&#39; dagger - at least not that particular dagger.<br/>
