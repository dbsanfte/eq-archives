<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555419406"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m not exactly sure what you mean about Shaman buffing without exceeding<br/>
&gt; their regen rate....<br/>
&gt; I can buff TWO people fully before I&#39;m out of mana.  Yes, some of the buffs<br/>
&gt; last longer but if I&quot;m debuffing during the fight, and I am even needed to<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just to clarify what it means to &quot;buff without exceeding your<br/>
mana regen rate...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Say each buff costs you one bubble.  Say each buff lasts 60<br/>
minutes.  Say you meditate back one bubble a minute.  That<br/>
means you can keep a maximum of 60 buffs up.<br/>
<br/>
How many buffs you can cast going from FM to OOM is pretty<br/>
irrelevant since buffing is almost always done during<br/>
downtime.  What matters is how many buffs your mana<br/>
regeneration rate allows you to maintain.<br/>
<br/>
This is the type of analysis Verant failed to do (and is<br/>
failing to do) every time they go off on one of their &quot;but<br/>
bards use no mana!&quot; tangents.  No we don&#39;t use mana, but<br/>
because of the short lifespan of our songs and the<br/>
(relatively) long &quot;casting time&quot; for our songs, it&#39;s pretty<br/>
much the same thing as using mana.  In fact, you can think of<br/>
our songs as spells that last 12 seconds, require 5 bubbles of<br/>
mana to cast, and our mana regen rate gives us back 5 bubbles<br/>
every 3 seconds.<br/>
