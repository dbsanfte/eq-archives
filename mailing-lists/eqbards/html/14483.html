 </span></blockquote>   #14, obviously 4 figures.  One large white one with three small<br/>
   white figures.  They appear to be worshipping the the big figure.<br/>
   As note that the big figure has a feathered headpiece (chief/king?)<br/>
   Each of the small figures has a unique color.<br/>
<br/>
   Could this be the Kobold king, with priest, champion, and noble<br/>
   worshipping him?  I mean the bigger white things do look like<br/>
   kobolds in a way.<br/>
<br/>
   Harmonic.</div>
