<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049724401">Aye, the Enchanter is a Bard&#39;s best friend.  I have an Enchantress I group <br/>
with whenever possible, with her Charms, MR reducing spells, and speed buffs <br/>
we make a deadly team.  Also Enchaters are one of the two classes that can <br/>
buff Charisma :) Plus she loves the Animal Cookies I bake her.<br/>

&gt;      Well, I was teamed with a level 16 Enchanter with a pet so maybe you<br/>
&gt;      would need a small party.  We were very careful to only take on one <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;      a time and did use the NPC camp for backup, but the exp. and the loot<br/>
&gt;      was great!  Most of my suggestions assume at least a small party, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;      not much for soloing since Bards are ever so much more efficient with<br/>
&gt;      groups.  I also tend to push my limits... I die on average of 2 or 3<br/>
&gt;      times a level.  (can you say reckless?  That guy in &#39;Lethal Weapon&#39; <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;      my hero... :)  )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      BTW the Bard/Enchanter mini team rocks!  You can take on MOB&#39;s that<br/>
&gt;      would normally reduce you to baking ingredients.<br/>
