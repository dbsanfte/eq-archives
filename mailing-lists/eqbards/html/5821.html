<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002786226">My thoughts exactly.  The MLMers and the spammers have made the Internet a<br/>

was a jarring and unwelcome note.<br/>

and then followed by your signature of 41 words. 41 words<br/>
of advertising spam that nobody likes to see regardless<br/>
of the length of your message. If I wanted to find out<br/>
about &quot;great ways to make millions&quot; I could turn off<br/>
the spam filter in my email client and get 50 a day to<br/>
choose from.</div>
