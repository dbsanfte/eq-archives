&gt; char is pretty amazing).  Our groups biggest problem is no snare (we are<br/>
&gt; warrior/bard/cleric/wizard), but chains aren;&#39;t too far away for the<br/>
&gt; bard.  (We also have a friend training up a necro who will give us the<br/>

Stuff with darkness on it will start to run *before* the<br/>
darkness will halt their movement.  So they&#39;ll still manage to<br/>
flee a bit depending on how quickly you&#39;re damaging it.  <br/>
Early on Chain acts pretty much like snare.  But later (level<br/>
thirty-something?) it will stop runners when they&#39;re at half<br/>
hp.  That makes it superior to snare for stopping green<br/>
runners, since greenies tend to run when they drop below half.<br/>
