&gt; Heh well your new set of spells every 4 levels are usually an upgrade to<br/>
&gt; existing spells. Like I said twinking only bypasses the first 15-16 levels<br/>

predecessor, then you&#39;re missing out on a lot.  Some upgrades<br/>
are better, some are worse.  Some even stack with the spells<br/>
they&#39;re supposed to be upgrading.  They usually come at<br/>
different intervals too thus constantly changing the optimal<br/>
mix of spells to use and keep loaded.  I usually try out every<br/>
spell a few times to get a feel for them, and battle-test them<br/>
in scenarios where I think they&#39;ll work best.  This is<br/>
regardless of what I thought of the predecessor.<br/>
