&gt; Oh man, that was exactly my posse before I left, they were all very serious<br/>
&gt; about their roles and we became a well oiled killing machine in Solusek&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Eye. There was the issue of runners (the warrior would chase, leaving no one<br/>
&gt; to taunt the mobs off me)  but when we added a Rogue and he took that on it<br/>
&gt; was nearly perfect.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THe bard is in charge of chasing runners if its safe.  If running is not<br/>
option, the wizard will usually nuke them late, or one of us will root<br/>
(thus wasting mana, gads I wish our druid would come back)<br/>
<br/>
Somitimes some mobs stick to her when she runs, if that happens I will<br/>
help her out...<br/>
