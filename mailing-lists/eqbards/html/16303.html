Wow, was yesterday one really messed up day :).<br/>
<br/>
	We buff up for Vox and run in, 20 seconds into the fight, 80% of<br/>
our healers get bugged by her fear or went LD.  That&#39;s right -&gt; 80% &lt;-.  I<br/>
got fear bugged with 90% mana along with 3 or 4 others and a few went LD.<br/>
We had 3 functioning healers that entire battle.  Well, we still got Lady<br/>
Vox down to a sliver before our damage output dropped to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
	A little CR, pause for a snack.<br/>
<br/>
	Our second run we only had 2 healers get bugged (which is about<br/>
the average and we had 2 casualties total.  That&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed<br/>
to happen :P.<br/>
<br/>
	Harmonic came along as a guest this trip, so he got to see both<br/>
the guild at its worst and best :).<br/>
<br/>
	Actually, Vox was very similar in items.  Nag&#39;s CoF -&gt; Vox&#39;s RBB.<br/>
Nag&#39;s scale -&gt; Vox&#39;s scale.  2 GPK&#39;s -&gt; 2 weight reducing pouches....<br/>
err... Nevermind :).<br/>
<br/>
	Vox just got really lucky with her fear bugging the healers, I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen so many people get fear bugged in so short a period of time.<br/>
