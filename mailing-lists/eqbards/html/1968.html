<div id="ygrps-yiv-431331780">On Fennin Ro, there seems to be a rather nasty group of powergamers who   <br/>
take great pleasure in killing Nostrolo whenever he spawns. The first   <br/>
time I shouted for someone to help me find him I was greeted by the reply   <br/>
&quot;Damn, now I have to hang around and kill him again.&quot; Nice... not.   <br/>
Another time, I saw him standing near a small hexagonal shaped stone   <br/>
plinth. Before I could complete the quest, some invisible mage nuked him,   <br/>
and then laughed at me when I suggested that he could have waited until   <br/>
*after* I spoke to him.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, at the time I wasn&#39;t really ready to be wandering around SK. I   <br/>
should make another attempt.<br/>

2) I also just picked up &quot;Lisera&quot;, a lute that a bard in Qeynos needs<br/>
tuning. He says that I need to take it to someone named Nostrolo in the<br/>
&quot;Karanas&quot;. But, I looked and looked and could not FINFD This Nostrolo<br/>
person. Is this a broken quest, or have I just missed this fella? Could<br/>
someone give me an idea where to look for Nostrolo? Also, is Lisera a   <br/>
lute<br/>
you should KEEP, meaning is IT better than a regular Lute?</div>
