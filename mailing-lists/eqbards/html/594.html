both (although the subscribe request to the other group<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to have gone through yet).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just timed this last night.  With a combine longsword (delay<br/>
28), I swing 5 times in roughly 14.0 seconds.  This is<br/>
consistent with my previous findings that the weapon delay is<br/>
just the recycle time in tenths of seconds (so 28 delay means<br/>
2.8 seconds between swings).<br/>
<br/>
With only the whistling warsong playing, it dropped to about<br/>
12.5 seconds, or about 25 delay (so my combine longsword is<br/>
working like a well-balanced longsword :-).  Roughly a 10%<br/>
speedup (my bard is L15).  With only the anthem playing, it<br/>
was about 12.5 seconds, maybe 13.0 seconds (my stopwatch<br/>
results for this one had about a half second of scatter).  So<br/>
again the speedup is about 10%, maybe a hair slower than the<br/>
warsong.<br/>
<br/>
Playing both whistling warsong and the anthem, I got 12.5<br/>
seconds again.  Apparently, the attack speedup with these two<br/>
does not stack, although the strength bonus does.<br/>
