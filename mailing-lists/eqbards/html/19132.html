<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361860433">Customer Service reps would also get in trouble for telling customers false<br/>
and misleading information, which they truely have no knowledge about nor<br/>
business talking about.<br/>
<br/>
but yes, i agree his intentions were good.  i wouldn&#39;t bash him, just<br/>
snicker to myself over his mistake.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Abashi is a Customer Service rep.  His job is to listen to <br/>
&gt; problems and take<br/>
&gt; them to the people who know how to fix them.  He may, on <br/>
&gt; occasion, offer<br/>
&gt; advice based on his experiences or come up with ideas on his <br/>
&gt; own.  But you<br/>
&gt; cannot expect him to have firm knowledge of how every song <br/>
&gt; and every spell<br/>
&gt; and every skill in the game works.  That&#39;s totally unfair.  <br/>
&gt; He _does_ have<br/>
&gt; general knowledge about bards.  He knows we use instruments <br/>
&gt; and have songs<br/>
&gt; that last far shorter durations than normal spells.  That&#39;s <br/>
&gt; all he really<br/>
&gt; NEEDS to know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Give the guy a break for crying out loud.  I&#39;d love to see <br/>
&gt; you do his job<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
