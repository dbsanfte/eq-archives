<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113838819">This is kind of a unique combination of classes and we were amazed it worked<br/>
so well, I was the group leader and after a few fights of assessing our<br/>
capabilities I just called a huddle and based on the fact that we were<br/>
taking very little damage I encouraged all the casters to just have fun, cut<br/>
loose and nuke away ;-)  Really careless tactic overall under normal<br/>
circumstances but as I said, with double clarity we were just unstoppable<br/>
and never OOM.  I mean, we even had the 2 clerics casting retribution and<br/>
wrath because they just didn&#39;t need to heal...lol.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fairly sure the enchanter was simply nuking.  We mostly got single pulls<br/>
and never more than 2, when we got 2 the enchanter used MY typical tactic,<br/>
she simply charmed the second and used it as a pet (me using AE fear would<br/>
have made mez disastrous).  It was a fun night because it was so<br/>
unconventional and it allowed all the classes to do things that they are<br/>
normally discouraged from doing or frowned on for doing...that&#39;s fun every<br/>
now and then, especially when you can get it to work effectively.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of brings me to another general question I wanted to throw out to<br/>
the list:  <br/>
<br/>
How often do you bards take the role of group leader?  I think that our<br/>
broad knowledge of class abilities and our support playing style tends to<br/>
make us excellent leaders and I often find people want ME to lead the group,<br/>
or if they don&#39;t ask and I find myself in a group that lacks clear<br/>
leadership I gradually just assume the role even if I wasn&#39;t the one to do<br/>
the initial inviting.<br/>
<br/>
If you treat people in your group with respect and politeness and make<br/>
strong &quot;suggestions&quot; as to what tactics they might try to employ in certain<br/>
situations you might be surprised at how often they tend to comply...the key<br/>
is knowing what you are doing and asking in the right way.  I&#39;m used to<br/>
taking a very active role in all aspects of combat even if I am not engaged<br/>
in the melee and I always know where the mobs are and what they are doing,<br/>
its just the nature of the bard I think - you learn pretty early on that it<br/>
really makes the difference between life and death for you.<br/>

That&#39;s a really cool story Faras!  Haven&#39;t seen ya in a while bud.  I am<br/>
curious about one thing, what was the enchanter casting?  Maybe I can get my<br/>
enchanter to try a new tactic.  Every time I try chains/fear or snare/fear,<br/>
he bellows about how it will break his mezzes.<br/>
