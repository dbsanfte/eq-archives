&gt; Has there been anything difinative(said by the bard programmer) about a <br/>
&gt; bards agility stat being used to check if the bard has succesfully used his <br/>
&gt; dodge skill?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In other words is it worth while for bards to raise their agility so they <br/>
&gt; dodge more often?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No there hasn&#39;t. However, other people I know have checked this and they<br/>
feel (without rigorous testing it&#39;s only a feeling) that dex is actually<br/>
used as the check for whether the dodge skill goes off, just like parry<br/>
and riposte. What agi is supposed to affect, and there is quite a bit of<br/>
debate on the usefullness, is the number of times the mob will outright<br/>
miss you. A friend of mine experimented a bit with this and he felt<br/>
there was not a huge difference between the number of times he was<br/>
missed in fights with an agility boosted up close to 200 with items and<br/>
buffs, and an agility of slightly over 100. At least in his case, he<br/>
felt you were not better off trading off ac for agi once your agi is<br/>
over 100. <br/>
<br/>
High agility is definately not reflected in higher ac. And ac determines<br/>
how much damage you take when the mob lands a hit. <br/>
