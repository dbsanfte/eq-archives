&gt;      #14, obviously 4 figures.  One large white one with three small<br/>
&gt;      white figures.  They appear to be worshipping the the big figure.<br/>
&gt;      As note that the big figure has a feathered headpiece (chief/king?)<br/>
&gt;      Each of the small figures has a unique color.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Could this be the Kobold king, with priest, champion, and noble<br/>
&gt;      worshipping him?  I mean the bigger white things do look like<br/>
&gt;      kobolds in a way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hrm... My research has shown that that particular image is called a &quot;Kobold <br/>
Shaman Painting&quot;.  All of the other images are also called Kobold <br/>
paintings, but none are as specific as that one.<br/>
