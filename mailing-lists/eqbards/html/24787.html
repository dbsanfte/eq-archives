<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-600149139">Greetings and Welcome to the EQ Bards Mailing List, a mailing list <br/>
dedicated to all for and about the Bard in EverQuest.<br/>
This list will be posted semi-regularly, and updated as often as is needed.<br/>
<br/>
05/08/2001 - Updated the weapon and armour lists.  Again.  If you have any <br/>
other instruments or weapons that should be added, please send the details <br/>
to the list (with spoiler space, please)<br/>
<br/>
If you have any suggestions, corrections, or  frequently asked questions, <br/>
please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
         First, some basic rules:<br/>
         (Common sense stuff, really)<br/>
<br/>
1) Stay on Topic (as much as possible).  While we do often stray off the <br/>
path of Bard-related stuff, lets try and keep the material &quot;of-interest&quot; to <br/>
our readers.  Ex: Discussions of DoT nerfing are acceptable, because Bards <br/>
have DoTs.  Discussions of Rogue Poison recipes are not.  Discussions of <br/>
Quests and items are okay, as long as you make an attempt not to spoil <br/>
someone else&#39;s fun. Use [Spoiler] in the heading, or put spoiler space <br/>
(several blank lines) to let people know in advance.  If you MUST post <br/>
something off-topic, please make it brief and put [OT] in the header.<br/>
         Deliberate spam will NOT be tolerated, and any person doing so <br/>
will be immediately reviewed for warning, removal or banning.<br/>
         On a related note, if you notice that your topic is straying from <br/>
the original thread, please change the subject header.  Example: RE: <br/>
Mistmoore Battle Drums becomes: re: Fighting undead as a Bard (was RE: <br/>
Mistmoore Battle Drums) For those of you receiving the digest version, if <br/>
you can make an attempt to change the subject field to something <br/>
appropriate, that would help those of us not digesting our mail better pass <br/>
it ;)<br/>
<br/>
2) No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please <br/>
be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read through, and then <br/>
make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily.  We&#39;re <br/>
all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you simply MUST insult, <br/>
badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>
<br/>
3) There is no Rule Number 3.<br/>
<br/>
4) Watch for &quot;KABONG!&quot;s.  KABONG! is an old list-term for a thread that is <br/>
being forcibly killed.  This sometimes happens when a thread has <br/>
degenerated sufficiently off-topic to no longer be valid for this list, or <br/>
when the subject matter has become too inflammatory to be discussed.<br/>
Kabongs generally only occur in extreme situations.<br/>
<br/>
5) No Attached Files!  If you wish to share with us your latest picture, <br/>
some nifty article or the Happy99 worm, please simply include a link within <br/>
your email to an appropriate place online.  If you have no access to such, <br/>
email the file to me, (except viruses ;) and I will post it for you, and <br/>
follow up to the list with the URL.  Small infractions will probably be <br/>
overlooked, but let&#39;s try to be considerate of our European readers who <br/>
have to pay by the minute to download their mail.<br/>
<br/>
6) Be Considerate of Others! Please keep &quot;me, too!&quot; posts to a minimum, and <br/>
try not to quote more of the message than necessary (although you <br/>
should  always make sure that the message you are sending is properly <br/>
referenced, so that people reading the messages out of order are not <br/>
completely lost.  And try not to abbreviate too much, or use strange <br/>
&quot;slang&quot; or incomprehensible euphemisms.  Plain, clear speech is much more <br/>
effective, and will cause fewer &quot;WTF?!&quot; messages...  Also, use spoiler <br/>
headings and/or spoiler spaces when presenting Quest hints or weapon details.<br/>
<br/>
7) Remember that, according to Verant&#39;s new policy, anything you say can <br/>
(and apparently will) be held against you.  Our email list is private as <br/>
far as posting privileges, but the archives are open for public <br/>
viewing.  So please, if you have an active EQ account, don&#39;t send anything <br/>
to this list that&#39;s likely to get you banned.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough rules.  Now for some Frequently Asked Questions!<br/>
<br/>
Q: I keep seeing all these abbreviations: &quot;DoT&quot;, &quot;DD&quot;, &quot;PGT&quot;, &quot;MM&quot;, &quot;GZ&quot; - <br/>
What do they all mean?!<br/>
A: Well, the best way to learn is to check out the EverQuest Glossary at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm</a> (shameless <br/>
plug).  Briefly, those four terms mean &quot;Damage over Time&quot; (refers to <br/>
spells/effects that do damage every few seconds for a while, instead of all <br/>
at once), &quot;Direct Damage&quot; (refers to spells/effects that do all their <br/>
damage at once), &quot;Polished Granite Tomahawk&quot; a nice weapon,  &quot;MM&quot; is <br/>
Mistmoore, a mid-to-high level zone near Lesser Faydark, and GZ is Geoffrey <br/>
Zatkin, the<br/>
Verant Designer in charge of spell balance (and thus a frequently consulted <br/>
individual when it comes to our songs....)<br/>
<br/>
Q: What is &quot;twisting&quot; (or &quot;weaving,&quot; &quot;stacking,&quot; or &quot;harmonizing&quot;), and how <br/>
do I do it?<br/>
A: &quot;Twisting&quot; is the most common name (although much deprecated by those in <br/>
favour of more &quot;period&quot; terms) for singing multiple songs at once - or at <br/>
least making it seem that way.  The short explanation is to stop one song <br/>
and immediately start another one, repeat as necessary.  Since most song <br/>
effects have a duration of about 6 seconds, you have time to weave as many <br/>
as three (and I&#39;ve even heard tell of four!) songs at once before the first <br/>
wears off, gaining the effects from all of them at once. The long <br/>
explanation, complete with illustrations, can be found here:<br/>

        (thanks Tork@Nameless).<br/>
<br/>
Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level?  What does this song do?<br/>
A: Well, again, shameless plug time: The EverQuest Bard&#39;s <br/>
Guild  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqbard.htm)">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqbard.htm)</a> has a list of<br/>
spellsongs, however, most people seem to prefer detailed statistics, so let <br/>
me refer you to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqsongs.com/">http://eqsongs.com/</a>  (The Bardic Song Analysis page), <br/>
compiled by Rokenn Swiftsong.  Also, the Soerbaird is a wonderful site: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sok.org/soerbaird/,">http://www.sok.org/soerbaird/,</a> and the Concert Hall seems to have a good <br/>
collection of Bards posting on the message boards: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/,">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/,</a> and the EQ Diva website is a great new <br/>
resource: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqdiva.com/">http://www.eqdiva.com/</a><br/>
(Anyone want to suggest any other sites?)<br/>
<br/>
Q: What do instruments do?<br/>
A: Some songs have associated instruments.  Playing this instrument will <br/>
generally enhance the song by as much as 50%, but this is also related <br/>
to  your relative skill with the instrument.  Also, instrument skill is <br/>
partially responsible for failure rate of related songs.  To avoid missing <br/>
notes, even when singing, keep your instrument skills maxed out.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; instruments for Bards?<br/>
A: Yes, there are several known &quot;special&quot; instruments in the <br/>
world.  Arranged by Strings, Percussion, Brass, Wind, in apparent order of <br/>
value.<br/>
             Lisera Lute (Unknown) Stringed instrument, used in <br/>
quests.  Not known if it has any bonuses.<br/>
             The Lute of the Gypsy Princess (also found on Mynthi Davissi <br/>
in Mistmoore) which has about a 5% improvement on stringed songs (only <br/>
really noticeable after 47th level).<br/>
             The Gypsy Lute (different from the Lute of the Gypsy Princess, <br/>
in that it is for a specific quest), which has about a 5% improvement on <br/>
stringed songs (only really noticeable after 47th level), and +5% Magic <br/>
Resistance.  It&#39;s found in the same area as the Lute of the Gypsy Princess <br/>
(above), but on the generic Gypsy Musicians.<br/>
             Lyendlln&#39;s Lute (Found in the Siren&#39;s Grotto on an unknown <br/>
mob) Stringed instrument that adds +10 AC, +25 HP, and enhances stringed <br/>
songs by about 20%.<br/>
             Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute (Found in the Plane of Hate on <br/>
Maestro of Rancor) which adds +9 DEX, +15 CHAR, +9 AGI.  It also seems to <br/>
add about 20% to stringed songs.  Also called the  &quot;Maestro&#39;s Lute.&quot;<br/>
             Lyran&#39;s Mystical Lute (Found in Veeshan&#39;s Peak on Silverwing) <br/>
Stringed instrument that adds +10 STR, +10 DEX, +10 INT, +15 CHA.  It is <br/>
unknown what bonus, if any, it gives to Stringed songs.<br/>
             Lute of the Howler (Found in Velketor&#39;s Labyrinth on Khelkar <br/>
Icepaw) Stringed instrument that can be held in the primary, while a weapon <br/>
is wielded in the off-hand. Appears to give about a 15% increase to <br/>
stringed songs.  Has Effect: Illusion Werewolf (+100 attack, +30 STR, +40% <br/>
Haste)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
             Drums of the Beast (Found in Siren&#39;s Grotto on a Shimmering <br/>
Spirit) Percussion instrument which appears to have a permanent Enduring <br/>
Breath effect while held.  It is unknown what bonus these drums give to <br/>
percussion songs (although it&#39;s rumoured to be VERY high).   It can only be <br/>
held in the primary slot.<br/>
             Mahlin&#39;s Mystical Bongo&#39;s (Given by Baenar Swiftsong in South <br/>
Karana) Percussion instrument - gives no statistic enhancements, but does <br/>
appear to give an 8% improvement for drummed songs.  This is part of the <br/>
Bard Epic Quest, resulting in the Singing Short Sword.<br/>
             The Mistmoore Battle Drum (found on Mynthi Davissi in <br/>
Mistmoore) Percussion instrument - which increases the effects of most <br/>
drummed songs by about 15%.<br/>
             Walrus Skin Drum (Found in Siren&#39;s Grotto on unknown mob) <br/>
Percussion instrument, which increases the effects of most drummed songs by <br/>
about 23%.<br/>
             Sharkskin Drums (Found in Kedge Keep on Coralyn Kelpmaiden) <br/>
Percussion instrument - which appear to increase effects of drummed songs <br/>
by about 25%.<br/>
             Nostrolo&#39;s Tambourine (Earned via Quest in Firiona Vie) <br/>
Percussion instrument - which gives +5 INT, as well as adding 20% to <br/>
drummed songs.  And, hey - it&#39;s NO DROP! (This is a good thing)<br/>
             Selo&#39;s Drums of the March (Found on Nagafen in Nagafen&#39;s <br/>
Lair)  Percussion instrument - which increases the effects of most drummed <br/>
songs by 35%.<br/>
<br/>
             Alluring Horn (Found on Quag Maelstrom in the Ocean of Tears) <br/>
Brass instrument - it appears to negatively impact songs.  Don&#39;t use <br/>
it!  It&#39;s part of the Bard Epic Quest, resulting in the Singing Short Sword.<br/>
             Conch Shell Horn (Found in Velious, in the Siren&#39;s Grotto and <br/>
Cobalt Scar on Sirens) Brass instrument, appears to give about a 5% bonus <br/>
to brass songs.<br/>
             Immaculate Shell Horn (Found in Velious, in the Siren&#39;s Grotto <br/>
and Cobalt Scar on unknown mobs) Brass instrument which adds +15 CHA, but <br/>
has a penalty of -8  STR. It appears to have about a 15% bonus to Brass songs.<br/>
             Denon&#39;s Horn of Dissonnance (Obtained through a Plane of Air <br/>
quest - Bard Test of Brass) Brass instrument, which adds +5 STR, +5 INT, <br/>
+10 CHA, +50 HP.  It does not appear to give any increase to Brass songs, <br/>
however, unlike most instruments, you can wield a weapon while holding this <br/>
one.<br/>
             McVaxius&#39; Horn of War (Found on Lady Vox in Permafrost) Brass <br/>
instrument, which adds +9 INT, +9 DEX, +15 CHA and increases Brass song <br/>
effects by 15%.<br/>
<br/>
             Lianna&#39;s Flute (From Regis the Reverent, used in a Cleric <br/>
quest) Wind instrument - no known special effects.<br/>
             Lyssa&#39;s Darkwood Piccolo (Found on Cazic Thule) is a wind <br/>
instrument.  Not sure if it  has any added effect.<br/>
             The Unicorn Horn (found on Equestrielle in Lesser Faydark), <br/>
acts as a Greater Lightstone while held, as well as a wind instrument. It <br/>
also has 5 charges of Purge.  It may have up to a 10% bonus on wind songs.<br/>
             Faun Flute - (From Fauns and Faun Stewards in the Wakening <br/>
Lands) Wind Instrument that gives +6 CHA, but no other known bonuses.<br/>
             Aglimente&#39;s Flute of Flight (Formerly obtained through a Plane <br/>
of Air quest) Wind Instrument that gives +4 STR and +2 INT, but it is <br/>
unknown if it adds any to wind instruments.<br/>
             Flute of the Sacred Glade (Found on Prince Thirneg on the <br/>
Plane of Growth)  Wind instrument that adds +4 WIS, +8 CHA and +10 vs <br/>
Disease.  It does not appear to add any bonus to wind songs.<br/>
             Minotaur Horns (Found on Minotaurs in Steamfont and the Gorge <br/>
of  King Xorbb) *wind instruments* (not Brass) which appear to add about <br/>
15% to wind songs. They are also easily found, and lighter than flutes.<br/>
             Brahhm&#39;s Horn (Found in the Gorge of King Xorbb on a named <br/>
Minotaur) Wind Instrument - which is exactly like a minotaur horn, and adds <br/>
15% to wind songs.<br/>
             Scorpion Pincer (Found on scorpions in the Field of Bone), <br/>
which adds 15% to wind songs, and has the appearance of a Minotaur Horn.<br/>
             Broken Minotaur&#39;s Horn (from the Minotaur Lord in Steamfont) <br/>
is a wind instrument like regular minotaur horns, however, it is heavier <br/>
and adds +10 to SV. vs Poison, and it&#39;s No Drop!<br/>
             Ervaj&#39;s Flute of Flight (Obtained through a Plane of Air Quest <br/>
- Bard Test of Pitch) Wind instrument which adds +8 STR, +10 STA, +5 INT, <br/>
+10 CHA, and enhances wind songs by 60%.<br/>
<br/>
      * * * Note: The Lizard Scout Fifes (Found on Lizard Scouts in the <br/>
Feerrot) and the Froglok Escort Fifes (found on Froglok Couriers in the <br/>
Swamp of No Hope) are quest items, and not playable instruments.<br/>
             There are new instruments still being discovered, so if you <br/>
find any information, or have a correction to this list, PLEASE let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Q: What&#39;s the difference between a Lute and a Mandolin?<br/>
A: Weight and cost.  Mandolins are lighter, but a little more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Q: What&#39;s with all these instrument parts I keep seeing? (Unfinished horn, <br/>
lute strings, mouthpiece, raw bamboo, etc.)<br/>
A: Nobody knows.  Rumour has it, there was to have been another tradeskill: <br/>
&quot;Instrument making&quot;, but nothing has ever been confirmed.  In the meantime, <br/>
don&#39;t accidentally buy an unfinished horn, because believe me, they just <br/>
don&#39;t play the same.<br/>
<br/>
Q: What ever happened to the Practice Lute and Small Brass Trumpet that <br/>
were supposed to be mid-level bard instruments?<br/>
A: These items were never added to the game, and they apologized for saying <br/>
that it was.<br/>
(Gordon Wrinn, October 10, 2000 on General Discussion Board)<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are there any good quests for a Bard?<br/>
A: Yes, there are many &quot;good&quot; quests for Bards, although much better ones <br/>
are found by completing other class-specific quests.  Allakhazam&#39;s Quest <br/>
Spoiler Database is probably the single-most complete compendium of quests <br/>
there is - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest_search.html">http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest_search.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Q: Where IS Fabian???<br/>
A: He&#39;s in East Freeport in the Grub and Grogg Tavern by the docks.  But <br/>
trust me - it&#39;s just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Q: When I get Dual Wield, will I be able to play an instrument while <br/>
swinging a sword?<br/>
A: Unfortunately, no.  While instruments are off-hand only items, they are <br/>
also considered two-handed.  Besides, it&#39;s ever-so-much more fun to bash <br/>
monsters with your lute, dontcha think? (Sylly! WEP!)<br/>
<br/>
Q: What&#39;s the best weapon/armour/equipment for &lt;foo&gt; level?  Where should I <br/>
hunt at this level?<br/>
A: Okay - time to ask the list ;)<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are there any magical or &quot;Unique&quot; weapons especially for Bards?<br/>
A: Yes, while Bards can take advantage of many different weapons, there are <br/>
several known Bard-specific weapons in the world:<br/>
             Whistling Dagger (In the Mines of Nurga off of unknown mob) <br/>
Piercing 6/25. +1 AC.<br/>
             Blade of Fiery Lamentations (In Kaesora off of Strathbone <br/>

             Sainy&#39;s Claw (In the City of Mist off unknown creature) <br/>
Piercing 6/19. +10 AC, +3 INT.<br/>
             Sainy&#39;s Singing Dagger (In Temple of Droga from unknown mob) <br/>

Piercing 9/19. +2 INT, +6 CHA, +5 MR.<br/>

1H-Slash (Primary only) 10/18, Effect: Niv&#39;s Melody of Preservation.<br/>
             Harmonic Dagger (In Karnor&#39;s Castle off Drolvarg Warlord) <br/>
Piercing 10/21. Procs Tishan&#39;s Clash (55 damage, 4 second stun)<br/>

&quot;Hate&quot; to the Bard.)<br/>
             Melodious Truncheon (In Charasis off of Bile Sentinel) <br/>
1H-Blunt 11/23. Procs(?) Melodious Befuddlement (Stun effect).  Appears as <br/>
a Lute.<br/>
             Evensong (In the Plane of Hate off of the Maestro of Rancor) <br/>
1H-Blunt 11/25.<br/>
             Six Note Blade (In the Plane of Hate off of the Maestro of <br/>
Rancor) 1H-Slash 11/25.<br/>
             Singing Short Sword (Epic Quest reward) 1H-Slash 16/26 +15 <br/>
STR, +10 DEX, +5 STA, +20 CHA, +100 HP, +10 to all SV.  Procs Dance of the <br/>
Blade (55% haste +str +atk)<br/>
<br/>
Q: What kinds of armour should I look for, specifically made for Bards, and <br/>
what does it look like?<br/>
A: There are seven sets of Bard-specific armour.  All use the plate-armour <br/>
graphic set.  The number in parentheses after the armour is the suggested <br/>
level for acquiring (although with good guild help or twinking, earlier is <br/>
possible).<br/>
    Lambent Armour (20+), which is available through a series of quests in <br/>
the Temple of Solusek Ro is a deep, rich blue.<br/>
    Imbrued Armour (46+), which comes from the Plane of Hate, is a strong gold.<br/>
    Singing Steel(40+), found on various high-powered mobs in Old Sebilis <br/>
and Karnor&#39;s Castle in Kunark, is a sea-foam green.  Singing Steel pieces <br/>
also have right-clickable effects associated with most of the pieces.<br/>
    In Velious, you can quest for two of the remaining four:<br/>
    Resonant (50+), another deep blue armour, which is quested for in <br/>
Thurgadin;<br/>
   Troubador (55+), which is quested for in Kael Drakkal, and originally <br/>
came in a teal guardian armour look, however, in a recent patch it was <br/>
retinted to a more burgundy shade.<br/>
   Melodic (50+), which is found in the Plane of Growth, uses the guardian <br/>
armour look, and comes in shades of grey or silver.<br/>
   High Sun / Twilight armour(55+) (they changed the name and colour <br/>
recently) is dropped in Skyshrine.  It used to use a yellow guardian armour <br/>
look, but when they changed it to Twilight armour, they changed the tint to <br/>
dark grey.<br/>
<br/>
Q: What are &quot;Hotkeys&quot; and how do I create them?<br/>
A: You&#39;ll notice that in the lower left side of the screen you have 6 empty <br/>
boxes with the number &quot;1&quot; and two arrows above it.  This is the &quot;hotkey&quot; <br/>
box.  Initially, hotkeys default to the numbers 1-6 on your keyboard, but <br/>
you can reconfigure that through the options settings.  Songs, spells, the <br/>
spellbook, socials, and inventory boxes can all be made &quot;hotkeys&quot;. To <br/>
create a &quot;hotkey&quot;, LEFT click on the box/spell/icon you want and HOLD it <br/>
down.  After a second, the box will magically &quot;lift up&quot; and attach itself <br/>
to your pointer.  Simply &quot;drop&quot; the new box onto the appropriate hotkey <br/>
slot, and blammo! Instant hotkey.  Now, whenever you press the associated<br/>
hotkey button, you will activate the song/spell or action in that slot. <br/>
Inventory boxes do NOT &quot;activate&quot;, putting them in your hotkey bank is <br/>
simply to avoid having to open your inventory to swap items in combat.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why would I want to swap items in combat?!<br/>
A: Well, not just in combat, but by placing inventory slots (General <br/>
inventory slots, or worn/wielded slots will work.  Bag slots will NOT) into <br/>
your hotkey bank, you can grab (for example) your sword and swap it with an <br/>
instrument in order to heal faster, run faster or whatever.  PRACTICE THIS <br/>
MANEUVER!!!  You *WILL* drop your weapon or instrument at least once, and <br/>
more likely several times, so practice practice practice!  And if you *do* <br/>
accidentally drop something, don&#39;t panic, just back up, grab the item and <br/>
run like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why can&#39;t Bards do &lt;foo&gt; as well as &lt;other really buff class&gt;?<br/>
A: Well, simply put, we&#39;re the &quot;Jack of all Trades, Master of None.&quot; This <br/>
means that, while we can do so many different things (sneak, dual wield, <br/>
pick locks, safe fall, etc. etc.) we&#39;re not meant to be masters in any of <br/>
them, so you may notice certain skill caps (such as 40 for Forage and 75 <br/>
for Sneak, etc.) that mean that you will never be incredibly good at these <br/>
skills.  Be thankful that you get them at all.<br/>
<br/>
Q:  Is it true that The Jig of Vigor song increases mana regeneration speed <br/>
for your party members?<br/>
A: No.  Here - let me emphasize that: NO!!!!!  What the Jig does is <br/>
increase the rate of  Stamina Regeneration every six seconds and hence the <br/>
display of the Stamina, Health, and Mana bars to show this <br/>
increase.  Without the song playing the bars are refreshed every eight <br/>
seconds.  The ultimate effect of this is that the mana bar &quot;moves&quot; every <br/>
six seconds instead of every eight seconds so it APPEARS to be moving <br/>
FASTER.  In actuality - it is moving 75% of the distance it would move if <br/>
it waited the other two seconds.  So bottom line, it LOOKS like it is <br/>
regenerating faster but it does not.  If you don&#39;t otherwise have a need to <br/>
regenerate stamina, you are wasting a memorized song slot.<br/>
   Or you can just use GZ&#39;s short answer: &quot;Urban Myth - Jig only gives <br/>
fatigue back.&quot;<br/>

Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity)?<br/>
A: &quot;There are different types of Bard Songs. Most Bard Songs leave an icon <br/>
on your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15 <br/>
seconds. Each time the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - this <br/>
means that a Bard who continues to sing the song can potentially keep the <br/>
song effect going indefinitely.<br/>
   Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the <br/>
Bard sings it, but will not get another &quot;dose&quot; until she sings it again. <br/>
Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it <br/>
does not have an actual duration, so you don&#39;t get an icon on your screen.&quot;<br/>

Q: Does Shauri&#39;s Sonourous Clouding work against undead?  Why does it work <br/>
sometimes and not others?<br/>
A: Shauri&#39;s Sonourous Clouding has been posited to work differently from <br/>
other invisibility effects in that it is level-based.  It appears to work <br/>
against anything - but only if that thing is of a certain level or <br/>
below.  This is still being hashed out, but the best solution is to con <br/>
everything you see while &quot;clouded.&quot;  If it cons indifferent, you&#39;re <br/>
invisible to it.  Otherwise, RUN!<br/>
<br/>
Q. Why can I never gain any experience in 2-handed slash or 2-handed blunt?<br/>
A. Although Bards have these skills, and even though they appear on <br/>
the  trainer, you can never train 2-handed skills as a Bard.  This is <br/>
apparently just something left over from Beta.<br/>
<br/>
Q. What are the most important stats as a Bard?<br/>
A. Well, because no matter what I answer, someone will disagree with me, I <br/>
will say this:  No matter what your starting stats, odds are, you will <br/>
eventually be able to balance any deficiencies out with magic items and <br/>
jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
Q. What&#39;s the command for &lt;foo&gt;ing?<br/>
A. Well, I don&#39;t know how to foo (not sure that I want to) but there is a <br/>
nearly complete list of commands at (shameless plug one last time) <br/>

        Okay, well, this FAQ is pretty long as it is - and I&#39;ve run out of <br/>
questions.  If anyone has any suggestions for the next version, please feel <br/>
free to send them my way.<br/>
