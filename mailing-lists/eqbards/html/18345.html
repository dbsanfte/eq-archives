Well said!  Anybody who thinks SOW is unecessary for<br/>
pulling should be the designated puller;-)<br/>

&gt; of the choke line as<br/>
&gt; a debuff, not a DOT as the damage on it is rather<br/>
&gt; small.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I usually don&#39;t like telling other people what to<br/>
&gt; do.  If I see<br/>
&gt; something really bad, like healers not healing when<br/>
&gt; people are low I<br/>
&gt; will say something.  I also always harp on assisting<br/>
&gt; the tank, but<br/>
&gt; people never seem to figure that one out.  People do<br/>
&gt; all kind of crazy<br/>
&gt; things, &quot;Damage shields are worthless&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think you need SOW to<br/>
&gt; pull.&quot;.  My reaction depends on my mood mostly.  If<br/>
&gt; they want me to pull<br/>
&gt; and won&#39;t SOW me (this being my troll warrior, not<br/>
&gt; my self SOWing bard),<br/>
&gt; he will just sit there till he gets a SOW or sees a<br/>
&gt; mob withing bow<br/>
&gt; range.  He will not move.  You don&#39;t want to give me<br/>
&gt; hp/ac buffs?  Fine,<br/>
&gt; but don&#39;t assume I&#39;m going to keep taunting stuff<br/>
&gt; off you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really hate getting pick up groups, but fortunatly<br/>
&gt; I have a good<br/>
&gt; memory, so I know who to refuse to group with.<br/>
