&gt;Druids have some nifty damage shield spells.  These are the<br/>
&gt;kind that do damage to the attacker every time you&#39;re hit.<br/>
&gt;Since bards often end up being the mob magnet, I was wondering<br/>
&gt;if anyone had tried getting a druid to cast a couple of these<br/>
&gt;on you (there are two types - one low damage/long duration,<br/>
&gt;one high damage/short duration, both stack - cast the latter<br/>
&gt;just as a fight starts).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just started using these with my L9 druid character, and I<br/>
&gt;can attack two or three blue mobs at once.  By the time I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;finished the first, the other two are down to about half hp<br/>
&gt;just from beating on me.  Of course, these are goblins who<br/>
&gt;tend to be pretty wimpy fighters in the first place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have had the same druid partner since level 4 and he does use the thron <br/>
shield spell on me quite often, usually if we fight a white or harder mob. <br/>
It&#39;s very nice - unfortunately, i don&#39;t think the more powerful version can <br/>
be cast on other players..i think it&#39;s self only..??<br/>
