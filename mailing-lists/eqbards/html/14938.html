 </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t talk a shaman or enchanter into slowing a level 1<br/>
mob for me (actually I couldn&#39;t talk them into leaving Sol B).  <br/>
So I did some rough timings (1 swing cycle).  They were<br/>
casting both Torgors and whatever L46 enchanters for a<br/>
slowdown (guess the two didn&#39;t want to change their SOP).  <br/>
The slowdown was about 100%.  i.e. the mobs went from swinging<br/>
every 3.0 seconds to about 6.0 seconds (I got times from 5.8<br/>
to 6.3 seconds, which is probably within the margin of error<br/>
for a single attack around).<br/>
<br/>
Chain may or may not interfere with it.  I had mobs I chained<br/>
stay at about 6.0 seconds per attack, so it&#39;s definitely<br/>
possible to chain a slowed mob without overwriting the<br/>
slowdown.  But sometimes the mobs went back to 3.9 seconds per<br/>
attack I&#39;d expect with chain, or the 3.0 seconds per attack<br/>
that&#39;s normal.  I&#39;m assuming this was due to torgors expiring<br/>
randomly (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a guaranteed duration).  But I<br/>
can&#39;t rule out Chain as being the cause.<br/>
