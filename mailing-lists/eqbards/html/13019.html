 </span></blockquote>I guess it depends on the guild.  I do a lot of delivering or<br/>
buying items for my guild that requires running around or<br/>
large cash purchases.  The clerics likewise are happy to do<br/>
exp resses, and the druids/wizards are happy to teleport.  <br/>
This assumes of course that we&#39;re not in a group or deep in a<br/>
dungeon somewhere.  We tend to do a lot of goofing off though,<br/>
so there are usually people free.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a problem, the clerics should learn to say no.  I<br/>
completely understand when a guild cleric or druid says they<br/>
can&#39;t help.  If people don&#39;t ask, they&#39;re going to miss out on<br/>
exp resses and teleports when they&#39;re available.<br/>
