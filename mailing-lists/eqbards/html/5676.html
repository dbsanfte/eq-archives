<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-151930597"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;In a group - Screech is a devastatingly potent weapon in saving your parties<br/>
&gt;collective butt. In lower guk while fighting dar&#39;s, zol&#39;s and a few wan&#39;s (the<br/>
&gt;L36-46 range of undead froggies) we got trained by the hand room. The group<br/>
&gt;leader called for an evac, but we were all being mobbed, including the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;hit screech. No less then 6 L40+ frogs fled in terror, and I was L36. All <br/>
&gt;conn&#39;d<br/>
&gt;blood red to me. The druid casted the evac successfully and we all escaped.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to mention.  If you get the time between your screeching and<br/>
the druid gating.  Please do a zone shout when in places like Upper or<br/>
Lower Guk.  Tell the zone that a train is leaving &lt;rough location your at&gt;.<br/>
  Like &quot;/shout Train leaving Hand room.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The reason I am requesting this is that once a frog in Guk starts moving<br/>
they usually start wandering as a huge mob.  I have never seen a mob that<br/>
was running after someone go back to its spawn point when the person that<br/>
it was after zoned.  They generally start wandering randomly as a group<br/>
hunting the next possible living thing to kill.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad that you got out, but I&#39;d hate to see another group get smacked<br/>
by 1 froggies running past from fear.<br/>
