&gt; &gt; So if lament is really that great, why are you higher level folks always<br/>
&gt; &gt; arguing about whether crowd control is best done with Lullaby, Chain, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; Charm?  Is it just that they hit multiple mobs at once?  Or are they better<br/>
&gt; &gt; than Lament even for single mobs?<br/>

&gt; At higher levels, the bard usually sticks with the main party<br/>
&gt; playing the mana song, and someone else does the pulling.  So<br/>
&gt; you never get a chance to Lament.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not only that, but at higher levels, Lament fails - a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I was fighting shadowed men all last night, and I would guess my success rate with Lament was in<br/>
the neighbourhood of 40%.  Actually, that&#39;s probably pretty high.<br/>
<br/>
And these are failures defined:  &quot;I sing Lament, get the &quot;A shadowed man looks sad&quot; message and<br/>
then pull the one near it within 5 seconds, and the lulled one still comes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It still works enough to go through the motions, but I am NOT surprised at all when I pull the<br/>
ones I Lamented.<br/>
