  I hear.  Even level 50s can have it rough in there.  Equate MM Castle<br/>
  to a L39-L50 area.  Don&#39;t be fooled, those monsters show no mercy.<br/>

&gt;     About what level are they?  Is it possible to pull one without the<br/>
&gt;     other?<br/>

  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  West Karana, near the northwest corner of the zone (near north karana)<br/>
  In a mountain area on a plateau near some L25-L30 ogres (very agro).<br/>
  Avoid the ogres.  Choon/Froon has large agro radii as well, by the<br/>
  time you see both, you probably pulled both.  Lamenting one lets you<br/>
  get close enough to Lament the other or pull the other.  They are <br/>
  both L30 on the nose.<br/>
