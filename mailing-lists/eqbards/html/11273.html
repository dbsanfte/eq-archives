  I hear.  Even level 50s can have it rough in there.  Equate MM Castle<br/>
  to a L39-L50 area.  Don&#39;t be fooled, those monsters show no mercy.<br/>

  In a mountain area on a plateau near some L25-L30 ogres (very agro).<br/>
  Avoid the ogres.  Choon/Froon has large agro radii as well, by the<br/>
  time you see both, you probably pulled both.  Lamenting one lets you<br/>
  get close enough to Lament the other or pull the other.  They are <br/>
  both L30 on the nose.<br/>
