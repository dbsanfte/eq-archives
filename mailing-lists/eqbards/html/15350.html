&gt;pay/talk someone into twinking you (which is actually likely<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My experience has been that you don&#39;t really have to talk people<br/>
into twinking you (with stuff). Rather, it takes the effort to <br/>
KEEP from being given stuff, even by complete strangers. I have <br/>
given up in all three cases that I tried this.</div>
