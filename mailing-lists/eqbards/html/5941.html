<div id="ygrps-yiv-643406377">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
In refference to to you zoning and popping back  with more life than you<br/>
zoned with.<br/>
<br/>
I play on Tarrew Marr server. MANY times this has happened lately and what<br/>
is actually is is a TIME warp.  It happens when you DIE RIGHT AS YOU ZONE.<br/>
It for some reason takes you back a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Several Dwarven characters were banned for DUPING items and money that way.<br/>
They would hand over all their cash and item then duel a friend to almost<br/>
death and then kill them as they zoned and they would pop back in time a few<br/>
minutes and have all their stuff back. The person they handed their stuff to<br/>
ALSO had their stuf THUS having 2 over everything they handed.<br/>
<br/>
I am a hater of bug exploiters and glad they got caught and banned.<br/>
<br/>
Just my guess thats its the same thing that happened to you..<br/>

&gt;Earlier tongiht I was hunting with a druid friend in Permafrost.  We got in<br/>
