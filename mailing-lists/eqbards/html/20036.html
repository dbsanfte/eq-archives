<div id="ygrps-yiv-474442991">I understand what you&#39;re saying, but aren&#39;t the people saying &quot;Price Check<br/>
on a XXXX!!!!&quot; asking around on their server?  They&#39;re doing what you&#39;re<br/>
suggesting.  Also, if you notice the reasoning (after the approximate prices<br/>
I listed) took into consideration some of the &quot;Are you happy&quot; type of<br/>
questions you asked.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I do understand the concept and the flaws in the &quot;priceguide&quot;<br/>
system, and you can peruse the actual bids and weed out the obvious fakes.<br/>
I do not believe that the priceguides are THE price for any item.  But, I<br/>
know that Xegony is one of the original servers, thus sharing more similar<br/>
economies to more servers than any that came later.  Starting with this<br/>
price as a guideline is a safe bet.  It was a little easier pre-Kunark to<br/>
ask around the server as the items had been around for awhile and more<br/>
people knew their approximate value.  With all the new items from RoK, it<br/>
makes it much more difficult to even know WHAT exists out there, much less<br/>
know the value for it.  I am surprised constantly by the new items I loot<br/>
and have to consider whether the item is a &quot;cash item&quot; or a trade item.  And<br/>
people I ask many times have no clue to the price and actually ask me the<br/>
stats! :)<br/>
<br/>
There are several things that establish a price.  Obviously Supply and<br/>
Demand are the biggest.  How badly somebody wants an item is a 3rd.  A high<br/>
end Ranger Only sword would go for more than a Bard Only sword with the<br/>
exact same stats.  Why?  There are more rangers than bards.  If both those<br/>
same items were pre-Kunark they&#39;d go for less on an aged server than a new<br/>
server.  Why?  There are more items in population.  If you look closely and<br/>
consider the flaws, the pricing guides all take this into consideration<br/>
obviously as these are (hopefully) REAL trades.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the other statement someone made about buying a car... I would<br/>
always check priceguides and alternatives first... I may be happy with the<br/>
price, but I would sure be pissed off to find out after it was too late that<br/>
I was ripped off.  Even if I could afford the payments and they didn&#39;t seem<br/>
to high at the time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used the priceguides as just that, guides, for a long time now, and<br/>
I&#39;ve had lots of success with it.  I&#39;ve had people send me tells saying,<br/>
&quot;You&#39;ll never get 30k in trade value for an Arbitor&#39;s Longsword&quot;... I laugh<br/>
to myself and tell them, &quot;Okay&quot; and proceed with dealing with the person<br/>
offering that or more.  If there is no person offering that or more, then I<br/>
obviously would lower my standard, but what they&#39;re telling me is THEY would<br/>
not pay that for the item.  That&#39;s perfectly fine... I&#39;ll trade it to<br/>
someone else. :)<br/>
<br/>
As far as the Selo&#39;s Drum... I&#39;d more than likely use my tambourine and try<br/>
to loot the selo&#39;s drum than trade 15k in value for it... But, I&#39;d be ALOT<br/>
more open to trading 15k in value for it if I knew that it was a typical<br/>
price and I wasn&#39;t being ripped off.  It&#39;s on my list of WANTS, but there<br/>
are many items on that list and I only have a limited &quot;budget&quot; to work with.<br/>
:)  I will probably only see ONE Arbitor&#39;s Longsword in my Bardic life... I<br/>
don&#39;t want to throw it away for JUST Singing Steel Gaunts, even tho I<br/>
really, no REALLY want them. :)<br/>
<br/>
btw, in case anyone doesn&#39;t know ~ means &quot;approximately&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, these are just my opinions, I don&#39;t presume to think that everyone<br/>
or &quot;anyone&quot; shares them, but I do know there is reasoning behind them. :)<br/>
YMMV<br/>

&gt; &gt; Swarmcaller is one of the top Ranger only 2HS weapons in the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My sources ( www.maximumeq.com ) say it&#39;s worth ~20k.  Those same<br/>
&gt; &gt; sources say the Jade Mace is worth ~12k.  Face value says, no it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; not a good trade. :)  But, consider the Jade Mace is the best Bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; wieldable 1HB weapon in the game AND has better dam/delay ratio than<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Symphonic Saber and Harmonic Dagger (without the proc).  You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; do MUCH better with the mace in your primary hand than with a Yak...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Keep the 2 Yaks, &quot;play&quot; with them for a little while, then sell it<br/>
&gt; &gt; off. :) I&#39;d see what else this guy could cough up to even out the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade a little and take it in a heartbeat. :) </span></blockquote></div>
