<b>Subject:</b> Info on new level cap....... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-552877858">Not confirmed by Verant but it seems Gaming World has published an article<br/>
in the latest issue with the following wording:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;ve got the scoop on Verant&#39;s upcoming expansion to EVERQUEST, THE RUINS<br/>
OF KUNARK. The one thing that you verteran players have wanted to know is<br/>
what the new level cap will be.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, players can advance to level 50; In KUNARK, that cap will be<br/>
raised to level 60. Each level increase will be much more difficult to<br/>
achieve than in the base game, however. Verant doesn&#39;t want characters<br/>
soloing dragons and walking around like gods among us mere mortals with our<br/>
level 18 druids. There will also be some special skills, spells, and even<br/>
titles for players who go past level 50.&quot;<br/>
