&quot;They need to make an equivalent faction hit for looting the fish, or<br/>
raise the level of the fish so you can&#39;t use a mule for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that they changed the fish for this quest. It is<br/>
just hearsay, but this is what someone told me...<br/>
<br/>
&quot; It is now called the Stein of Moggok. I got my character who i used<br/>
to kill the fish for the quest in qeynos to see if they changed it just<br/>
for fun. This is what i found, the fish is now the god Rodcet Nife. Hit<br/>
me for 244pts dam in one bite. Then proceeded to call me a puny<br/>
mortal.Not sure if the fish can be killed anymore. Just my experience<br/>
with it:)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t tried it, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true. But then again, I<br/>
never tried it before. Maybe someone wants to find out?<br/>
