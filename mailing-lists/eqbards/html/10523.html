<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492813131"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What type of resist does starfire check against?  Magic resist<br/>
&gt; significantly reduces the damage I take from clerical casters,<br/>
&gt; and fire/cold resist does the same against wizard-type<br/>
&gt; casters.  It&#39;s less effective against higher level mobs (wish<br/>
&gt; that were true when it&#39;s the player casting on a mob)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I wasn&#39;t planning on the druid casting on me.  I had no shield<br/>
  songs mem&#39;d.  Starfire is fire based (like most of the druid<br/>
  spells) - I&#39;m guessing it checks fire resist.  But the chance<br/>
  of me resisting a NPC 6 levels higher than me (fully or partially)<br/>
  would have been really slim.  Just a guess.  Next time, I&#39;ll have<br/>
  elemental ready.<br/>
