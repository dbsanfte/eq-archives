this.  If a mob is so powerful for its level that by the time<br/>
you can kill him, he doesn&#39;t give you experience, then his<br/>
only purpose is to annoy the players.  You do not make a loyal<br/>
playerbase by intentionally annoying the players.<br/>

will never be resisted more than 95% of the time, or less than<br/>
5% of the time.  Or in other words, ultra-green mobs have at<br/>
least a 5% chance of resisting, ultra-red mobs have at most a<br/>
95% chance of resisting.<br/>
