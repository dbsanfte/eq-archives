<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&quot;I have not seen Lullay (L15) or Pixie Strike (L28) clear the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hate list on any mob.  It certainly upgrades the bard on the<br/>
list, but I&#39;ve been unable to use either consistently to pull<br/>
a frenzied mob off of someone.  Of course it could just be a<br/>
random chance of clearing the list - the enchanter&#39;s mesmerize<br/>
is supposed to work like that (95% chance of also doing a<br/>
memory blur).&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is also my experience.  It does not seem that lullaby clears the hate<br/>
list.  It does move you up on the list, often times to the top of the list,<br/>
but does not appear to clear it.  Consonant Chains works well in this regard<br/>
too.  It usually causes the mob to target me *even when the song does not<br/>
take hold*.<br/>
<br/>
I have hand-to-hand up to 100 now (is it capped?  I hope not!).  The most I<br/>
remember hitting a mob of my level for is 5 points.<br/>
<br/>
I have received numerous tells from other bards asking me how I got my brass<br/>
skill up.  Some of them have heard or thought of going to Arena to play DDD<br/>
overnight, some have not. I still don&#39;t have it maxed, but I got it over 100<br/>
killing rats and bats and beetles in the newby zones (which seemed to<br/>
alternativly entertain or enfuriate newbies--even though I left the loot for<br/>
them).  I am playing DDD a lot more recently.  Hopefully I will be able to<br/>
get it maxed in real battles from this point on.  I like to twist it with<br/>
Chords and Chains.  <br/>
<br/>
I was in CB last night to replace my Dragoon Dirk and decided I always<br/>
wanted a little wood elf slave girl pet.  I am taking a break from being an<br/>
experience junky for a few days.  I just completed a vacation trip to kill a<br/>
bunch of folks that I owed payback to (Mr. Griffin, Mr Sand Giant, Mr. Hill<br/>
Giant, Froon and Choon, Ogre Village, Dorn, Dvinn and I still con that<br/>
Sandwhipserer Wench as red!) and trying to figure out where to go next.  Any<br/>
opinions as to where I should go for experience at 33?  I tried Solusek A,<br/>
but that was a little too low.  I will probably try Solusek B next.  Is<br/>
lower guk appropriate at this level?  Anywhere else?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
