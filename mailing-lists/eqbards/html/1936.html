    Subject: [eqbards] Boat Crashes<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
        I had one heck of a night trying to get back to Freeport from Butcherblock - the boat crashed three times.  What would happen is first all the other players on the boat would disappear then you&#39;d get dumped...  The first time I was back on the dock in BB then next time on the boat on the way to BB and then finally on the boat on the way to Freeport.<br/>
    <br/>
        The reason I bring it up here - is that several whiny players claimed that the cause of the crash is bards playing songs on the boat...  The first time I was in fact playing a song and thought that it might contribute.  The second time - no bards were playing (assuming no one in the hold was) and it crashed anyways.  I think this was true the third dump as well.  <br/>
    <br/>
        So I am wondering if people have any experience in this.  My gut is that there is no relation between the two - and this is yet another myth (like all bard songs will require mana!)<br/>
