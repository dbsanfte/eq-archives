<div id="ygrps-yiv-133512658">Only know of Song of Shield...it sells in the Library in Erudin and a couple other places.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, for those hunting Melody of Ervaj (or something), our level 50 Velious spell, it drops off of crystaline shardwurms in Great Divide (seen two drop in about 18 spell drops there).  The spells come fast...we got 10 in about 6 hours one night.  This is the cavern with 4 crystaline shardwurms, and the matriarch spawn.<br/>
<br/>
For those that want to know, this is a list of spells I&#39;ve seen drop: Melody of Ervaj, Impr. IVU (6 of these....grrrr), GD portal, Spirit Quickening, Monster Summoning 2, Shroud of Pain, Impr. Invis, Flame of Light, Superior Camo.<br/>
