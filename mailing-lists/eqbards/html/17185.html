<div id="ygrps-yiv-724616239">PvP games have better potential for open ended interest.  Playing against<br/>
human brains is a lot more fun than against NPC&#39;s that do the same thing<br/>
over and over. (I wish my friends would have switched to PvP server about 48<br/>
levels ago but we decided to stay on Innoruuk.)  There is no dynamic to EQ<br/>
NPC&#39;s.  Once you find out what they do, you can rely on them to do it onver<br/>
and over again.  In the PvP games that I have played, you can do obstensibly<br/>
the &quot;same thing&quot; over and over yet each time it can be different and unique.<br/>
I am talk about the games where you are on more or less equal terms in<br/>
&quot;equipment&quot; but the &quot;skills&quot; depend on the person and their ability to play<br/>
the game.  Games where you have to make decisions in battle and the<br/>
situation is dynamic.  And the dynamics come from having real live thinking<br/>
people as opponents vs pre-programmed NPC&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
EQ has great potential for PvP in role playing situations but my year has<br/>
been spent on an NPC server so I have seen very little of that.  On the<br/>
other hand, I have been in &quot;scenarios&quot; in other games where you have 1000<br/>
registered players and each plays a &quot;role&quot; (not talking with accents but has<br/>
a tactical role in planned combat.)   These have been the most entertaining<br/>
events I have been part of.  EQ could do alot more of this to develop their<br/>
&quot;GM Events&quot; or &quot;large scale events.&quot;  And we hashed this all out here<br/>
before.  You need it to be &quot;staged&quot; in out of game venues (web pages,<br/>
discussion forums, assigned team leaders, pre-planned actions) all this so<br/>
people know where to go and what to do once they get online and want to kill<br/>
stuff.  Think of 2 teams of 6 full groups starting on opposite sides of<br/>
Rathe Mts with the objective of securing some designated spot like the<br/>
burned out fortress.<br/>
<br/>
If you have dueled, you know that the combat technique is alot different<br/>
from soloing or grouping vs NPC&#39;s (you get to use all kinds of different<br/>
songs - and some of them actually work.)  But do any of us have significant<br/>
experience in &quot;guildwar&quot; combat?  Where multiple groups of comparable level<br/>
and equipment face off to accomplish some tactical and or strategic goal?<br/>
Fighting against other people provides for a more dynamic combat and thus<br/>
holds interest much longer.<br/>
<br/>
All the stuff you mention about how characters have become one-dimensional<br/>
at the high levels - I pretty much agree with.  The way they have designed<br/>
the higher levels where multiple group combat is necessary kind of forces<br/>
this situation even more.  There is no &quot;west karana&quot; for level 50&#39;s to shout<br/>
for a group and go hunt &quot;tormented, undead, rotting, tentecle, thought<br/>
ravishing, bixie commanders.&quot;   Maybe expansion has these - 20 new dragons?<br/>
Zones larger than West K? Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting NPC&#39;s relies on them to make new npc&#39;s.  Fight other people can be<br/>
different each time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; You don&#39;t understand.  I&#39;ve already done all that, made those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; decisions and adjustments countless times, and figured out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; near-optimal solutions.  Starting a twink would just be<br/>

&gt; &gt; You have played to 50 on PvP?  Your enchanter is 50?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PvP doesn&#39;t appeal to me in this type of game.  Presumably you<br/>
&gt; want player versus player conflict to determine who is the<br/>
&gt; better player. </span></blockquote></div>
