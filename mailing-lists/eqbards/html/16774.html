<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032625927">Nope - my record so far is on Brell.  His name is Dreadpirate Roberts (no <br/>
kidding) and he is in all Lambent - except for the rubicite chest.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been thinking of calling him &quot;Spiderpirate&quot; - but I wanna keep on his good <br/>
side ;)<br/>

&gt;I am a fashion disaster. Last night was something, I started the night<br/>
&gt;looking like a wood elf wearing chain (with silvery bracers depending on<br/>
&gt;what order I dressed) and wound up...well you will see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With my list of suggestions from Draelon Stormsong in a position of honor by<br/>
&gt;my monitor I started out for Mistmoore. But GFay being the Outlet mall of<br/>
&gt;Norrath I saw a Skull shaped barbutte for 250 (ended up paying 235 to the<br/>
&gt;*very* nice seller) it was on the list! So...quickly raising funds from the<br/>
&gt;200 I had I bought it. . I swapped order on the wrists so they would<br/>
&gt;show...looking good. THEN an old guildmate /tells me he has all the goods<br/>
&gt;for lambent legs and will bring em to me...I have no money left (for the<br/>
&gt;gems) but he will accept my chared boots in trade (plus credit towards the<br/>
&gt;next few pieces he also has parts for). He then gives me bronze boots to<br/>
&gt;replace the charred.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If the Worst Dressed awards were given today I am confident I could beat<br/>
&gt;Cher.<br/>
