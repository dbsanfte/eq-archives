<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167223416">Greetings and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
My weapon advice is:  dragoon dirk - dont leave home without it!  Yes, I<br/>
know it is not 1hs and maybe you think your pierce skill is low but a<br/>
training point or 2 and some practice and you will master in no time!  Then<br/>
keep pierce, 1hs and 1hb all mastered through practice.  A good 1hs for your<br/>
level is a combine long sword.  It hits on magic mobs and has decent stats<br/>
for now.<br/>
<br/>
For your armor concerns:  add str items to help you carry more weight & look<br/>
at each piece of bronze you have and consider the ac-to-weight ratio.  Some<br/>
pieces give lots better anti-bang per ound than others.  Look for some of<br/>
the stat boosting armor from Befallen.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and keep us posted on your adventures and your progress,<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I just subscribed to this list, but I was wondering if any of you<br/>
&gt; could reccomend a 1h slash weapon for a level 12 bard?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I am in bronze armor now for the most part..and it seems a bit<br/>
&gt; heavy.  Whats the next step armor wise?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks!<br/>
