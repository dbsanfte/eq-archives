<div id="ygrps-yiv-603799369">Hermit is 20th, although he&#39;s very good experience and spawns every 3<br/>
minutes +/- a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Gargoyles are similar in level, although they&#39;re on an island that is kinda<br/>
crowded.  Have Chains handy.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest Crag Spiders in East Karanas on the hill next to the base of<br/>
the ramp to High Pass although they&#39;ll start to turn green at 26th.  At 24th<br/>
they gave me a noticable boost in experience every time I killed one.  They<br/>
have a fairly serious poison so take precautions against that.  Sitting and<br/>
singing hymn with a lute you still gain 2 or 4 health points per tick while<br/>
poisoned, so it won&#39;t kill you if you play smart.<br/>

&gt; I am level 24 almost 25. Where can I solo for the next level ro 2<br/>
&gt; until 26/27?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have heard the Hermit or Gargoyles but I am not sure what<br/>
&gt; levels they are.<br/>
