 </span></blockquote>You mentioned you were singing Guardian Rhythms at one point, for the AC<br/>
buff.  Were you having issues with COB stacking only while GR was in the<br/>
twist?  Since both have an AC component, I&#39;m speculating they won&#39;t stack<br/>
with each other.  I&#39;m never tried that particular twist, so, as I said, I&#39;m<br/>
only speculating.<br/>
