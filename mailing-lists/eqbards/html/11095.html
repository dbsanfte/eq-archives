<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162984629">LOL what did you expect?! It&#39;s effect is fire-based (obviously) and you are <br/>
in a dungeon full of fire goblins... geez.<br/>
On non-fire based critters it&#39;s effect is resisted about the same as any <br/>
other proc in the game. My yaks are resisted just as much as my shard was <br/>
easily. I certainly hope no one thinks it is an uber-poker, though it is not <br/>
bad for a non-rogue to use as a piercer.<br/>

&gt;Your info is quite correct.  I got lucky and got the predator to drop the<br/>
&gt;shard a few weeks ago.  I used it for 2 nights and now its collecting dust<br/>
&gt;in the bank.  Its not only resisted a lot, forget about using it in Sol A,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s resisted damn near every time.  I am rather surprised about the <br/>
&gt;stamina<br/>
&gt;problems that the initial poster of this thread mentioned.  The scimi/dirk<br/>
&gt;combo is the same setup I use, and I have yet to see my stamina drop more<br/>
&gt;than a bubble.  In fact, I often drop my dirk in my ranged slot and dual<br/>
&gt;wield 2 OS&#39;s with very similar results stamina wise.  Maybe its the group<br/>
&gt;makeup I have, I imagine if you run in a caster heavy group, you would have<br/>
&gt;that problem when mana runs low.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, just to correct a post someone made yesterday or the day before:<br/>
&gt;The Obsidian Scimitar has no proc but is + 6 AGI or DEX (I forget which)<br/>
&gt;The Obsidian Shard has the proc - which is resisted WAY too much in my<br/>
&gt;opinion, so if you get one, don&#39;t expect it to become the uber-poker you<br/>
&gt;thought it could be hehe.  I personally was very disappointed.<br/>
