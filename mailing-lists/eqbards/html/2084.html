<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065795985">Well said!  Seems we do have quite a few Bards on this list.  I&#39;ve found EQ<br/>
extremely addictive as well so keep the info flowing.  My character isn&#39;t<br/>
power hungry or camp hungry like many of the players I&#39;ve seen lately.  I&#39;m<br/>
much more into the part of being a bard and enjoying the fantasty world.  I<br/>
detest the idea of hanging out waiting for things to respawn for you to kill<br/>
and then wait to kill again.  I really think EQ needs a rogue band of camp<br/>
killers to go around and whack on people if they&#39;ve been sitting there for<br/>
too long.  I do think we bards get left out sometimes though.  I think we<br/>
need to have a concert or something, maybe a Bard-alapooza or show.  Gather<br/>
the bards together and sing baby sing!<br/>

&gt; It is good that those supplying information some will consider spoilers<br/>
&gt; should give such warning.  That said, I&#39;ll offer my take on this forum and<br/>
&gt; spoilers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play EverQuest way too much.  Since I got it I no longer vegetate in<br/>
&gt; front of the TV.  I play.  Hmmmm.  Maybe overall that is an improvement.<br/>
:-)}<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, even playing that much there&#39;s a lot I miss due to time or don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; figure out or am a bit too careful about.  In my mind and on an in-game<br/>
&gt; basis, this forum represents a conclave of bards, helping one another.<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; a dedicated roleplayer, trying to keep the fantasy intact as much as I can<br/>
&gt; and avoiding fantasy-busters such as /loc or talking too much in terms of<br/>
&gt; software mechanisms, but I&#39;m sure in an alternate reality like our game<br/>
&gt; world bards would share tales and information, suggesting good places to<br/>
&gt; see, profitable ventures, and particularly effective techniques and<br/>
equipment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some want to discover it all for themselves.  Some want the most power the<br/>
&gt; fastest.  Some want to live a fantasy life.  I want to have fun and avoid<br/>
&gt; major frustration and I find this forum a wonderful resouce to those ends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bob<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keep the information flowing.  It is the life blood that runs through the<br/>
&gt; veins of the bards, the heart and soul of Norrath.<br/>
