<div id="ygrps-yiv-292359639">At my current (and everyone in my now guild&#39;s) rate of progression we will<br/>
reach the levels that you claim their spells make a difference in<br/>
approximately 2.5 years.  That&#39;s 128 patches.  I doubt the game will look<br/>
much like it does now at that point.  Why does everyone seem to continually<br/>
use the argument &quot;Wait until you are X level, then things balance out&quot; when<br/>
X is invariably well above 20?  Shouldn&#39;t a game be balanced at all levels<br/>
of play?<br/>

&gt; The other three classes you mention can function for 9 levels without<br/>
&gt; spells.  Their spells even after that are a nice flavor ability but really<br/>
&gt; do not increase their abilities in combat very much.  dance of fireflies<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; the perfect example.  What 9th level ranger can&#39;t kill a fire beele with<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; bare hands and pick up an eye?  Why have the spell?  for flavor, no other<br/>
&gt; reason.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, they gave rangers Dance of the Fireflies so they<br/>
could practice conjuration before level 30 - my two ranger<br/>
friends spent something like two weeks meditating every chance<br/>
they got so they could fizzle their L30 DoT 20 times for every<br/>
1 success hoping it would raise their conjuration from however<br/>
many practice points they were willing to sacrifice for it.<br/>
<br/>
And you are kidding yourself if you think it doesn&#39;t add to<br/>
their combat ability much.  Snare&#39;s use is obvious, as are the<br/>
buffs.  Paladins get good buffs and cures as well, and a L39<br/>
paladin is using the same heal spell as a L34 cleric.  My<br/>
paladin friend was able to act as primary healer for a L35-40<br/>
party we had in Mistmoore. </span></blockquote></div>
