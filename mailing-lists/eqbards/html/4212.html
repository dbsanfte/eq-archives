<div id="ygrps-yiv-603500103">Hahaha...too funny, I have never met anyone who was on a crusade against<br/>
acronyms.<br/>
<br/>
This is a game where people communicate in real-time and many of us do not<br/>
type 80 words per minute.  If someone uses the acronym &quot;RTS&quot; instead of<br/>
typing out &quot;Runed Totem Staff&quot; I really think they should be forgiven.<br/>
After all, if you don&#39;t know what RTS is all you have to do is ask someone<br/>
once.<br/>
<br/>
The only double-meaning acronym in the game I know of is &quot;BB&quot; - one for<br/>
Butcherblock and one for Blackburrow, but you generally do not get confused<br/>
because usage is mostly in context. <br/>
<br/>
Oh well...I shouldn&#39;t have been lured off topic but I could not resist being<br/>
stupefied by this rant, which has come up before much to my disbelief.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ah! You just need the secret decoder ring. Here ya go:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry, wrong answer.  Doesn&#39;t scale.  Barely works at all.  <br/>
&gt; Using acronyms<br/>
&gt; that aren&#39;t widely known is inconsiderate of those with whom you are<br/>
&gt; supposedly trying to communicate.  Pointing people to an <br/>
&gt; immense list of<br/>
&gt; definitions is simply a way of saying you can&#39;t be bothered <br/>
&gt; to type out<br/>
&gt; words that would be relatively sufficient.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Overuse of acronyms was one of the problems that made IBM <br/>
&gt; systems difficult<br/>
&gt; and limited their use to the priesthood.  More considerate computer<br/>
&gt; companies moved away from secret code.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Acronyms are the rudest form of slang and jargon.  They are <br/>
&gt; even worse than<br/>
&gt; obscure words like &quot;proc&quot; because they aren&#39;t even pronouncable words.<br/>
&gt; Acronyms are effectively a way to invent new words on the <br/>
&gt; fly, then use<br/>
&gt; them and berate the reader for not knowing what they mean.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll warn you now that I&#39;ve been fighting this battle in the computer<br/>
&gt; industry for 30 years, with some success.  People either get <br/>
&gt; the point and<br/>
&gt; behave less rudely or miss the point and continue to speak in <br/>
&gt; secret code,<br/>
&gt; either not understanding or simply not caring whether they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; communicating<br/>
&gt; with the majority of their audience.  If you don&#39;t mind if <br/>
&gt; the majority of<br/>
&gt; the readers simply don&#39;t know what you meant and probably <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t bother to<br/>
&gt; find out, use them, but don&#39;t kid yourself.<br/>
