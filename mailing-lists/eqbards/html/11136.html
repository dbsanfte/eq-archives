&gt;ps thanks to whoever the bard from this list who clued me in to the<br/>
&gt;ridiculouly slow speed of beetles.  It didn&#39;t help Kit a ton, but it sure<br/>
&gt;made Leagnomo&#39;s life easier!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, no problem, happy to help etc so forth so on....<br/>
The other nice things about the beetles (aside from the fact that they<br/>
walk...even  when chasing) is that they are roughly the same level range as the<br/>
crocs in oasis (but they top out at 19 instead of 21) and they drop words and<br/>
runes with about the same frequency of the crocs (not often, but you will get<br/>
them, so they are pretty good for INT casters.  I still think that they are a<br/>
great place to level your teens with a bard, because of our AE songs (or, song<br/>
depending on level) you can kite multiples...i have a few screenshots of me<br/>
with 7+ beetles following...it was alot of fun.<br/>

She has retired her monk cuz she was pissed at the FD nerf(maybe only<br/>
temporary) so we both started new chars.  <br/>

I&#39;m sorry, what was that last one?  Don&#39;t eat pork?  God has spoken. Is that the word of God or is that pigs trying to out smart everybody?&quot;<br/>
