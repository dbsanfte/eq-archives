<div id="ygrps-yiv-856959194">Heheheh, anyone who twinks a character under level 6 is a MORON. Or at least <br/>
woefully ignorant. A guy I know twinked his lvl 2 warrior with a ton of <br/>
mid-level stuff. He then got himself killed and subsequently lost connection <br/>
for 24 hours due to a power outage. Of course his corpse decayed and he lost <br/>
all of his stuff.<br/>

&gt;In all honesty I too hate seeing a bard, and a level 1 bard mind you in<br/>
&gt;full rubicite wielding dual Ykeshas.  And yes I had that pang of jealousy<br/>
&gt;that we all succumb to, but really what are you in the game for?  If it<br/>
&gt;were not for the good friends that I have made I would have left this game<br/>
&gt;a long time ago.  I bet you remember how wild some of your adventures were<br/>
&gt;and not the 3 hour camp that you did to get a &lt;insert item name here&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for making items no drop, it would appease my jealous streak, but it<br/>
&gt;will also quell my good nature towards my friend.  As a present to my<br/>
&gt;friend who working on a new cleric, I camped 6 hours straight to get her a<br/>
&gt;set of barbed arms.  The camp was horrible, but I did love the thanks I<br/>
&gt;received from her... If items don&#39;t stroke my ego, then let my friends do<br/>
&gt;it for me.  In all truth I really wish some of the other quests were not<br/>
&gt;no drop so I could give gifts to my friends for their kindness and<br/>
&gt;understanding.<br/>
