&gt;Heh, your included as part of the et. al. (Latin for &quot;and others&quot;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not that it makes a hill of beans difference, but E&#39;ci does seem to be one<br/>
&gt;of the most represented servers on this list (granted I&#39;m biased and more<br/>
&gt;likely to notice posters from E&#39;ci).  Perhaps we should take a poll to see<br/>
&gt;how well each server is represented.  If a server appears to have relatively<br/>
&gt;few members on the list, we could post a message on that servers&#39; EQvault<br/>
&gt;board to advertise this list.    <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think Onelist supports polls/surveys so what do you think Talies?<br/>
