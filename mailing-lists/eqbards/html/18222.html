Fironia<br/>
(Sung to the tune of My Sharona)<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, my little high elf one, my high elf one<br/>
Captured without saying &quot;Goodbye&quot;, `Ronia<br/>
You were captured in Kunark, in Kunark<br/>
Got a port named for you, Fironia<br/>
<br/>
Now I got to buy, a CD, through the online store<br/>
By the 24th, Verant said, it&#39;d be at my door!<br/>
Fi, fi, fi, buy, buy ,whoa!<br/>
Fi-fi-fi-Fi-Ronia<br/>
Fi-fi-fi-Fi-Ronia<br/>
<br/>
Shipping was not good to me, the phones busy<br/>
Got through and was put on hold, `Ronia<br/>
So I get my one month free, one month free<br/>
This is really getting old, `Ronia<br/>
<br/>
Tracked it on the web, every hour, it came in a week<br/>
Grabbed the mail man, took the bag, and kissed him on the cheek!<br/>
Fi, fi, fi, mine, mine, whoa!<br/>
Fi-fi-fi-Fi-Ronia<br/>
Fi-fi-fi-Fi-Ronia<br/>
<br/>
Trees slow down my graphics card, my graphics card<br/>
And got killed by vine `Ronia<br/>
Iskhar femmes are not endowed, but spiders are<br/>
&quot;Kill stealed&quot; by a butterfly, `Ronia<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna stop, give it up, played until it hurt<br/>
Up `till 8am, fell asleep, called in sick from work.<br/>
Yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, yawn, ZZZZZZZ<br/>
Fi-fi-fi-Fi-Ronia<br/>
Fi-fi-fi-Fi-Ronia</div>
