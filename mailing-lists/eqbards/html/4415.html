&gt;So what&#39;s in the lake in the West Commons anyway? Can you zone to/from the<br/>
&gt;Ocean Of Tears? Who needs a stinky boat - I&#39;m swimming from Freeport to<br/>
&gt;Butcherblock!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll save the surprise of the lake for you... swim along the bottom,<br/>
though... heheh.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, can&#39;t swim across zones.  If we could, that&#39;s the way I would<br/>
travel through the ocean o tears for sure!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;PSS: Does anyone else think that there should be a merchant or a bar in the<br/>
&gt;boat? I&#39;d love to see some drunken Bards roaming around the deck.. playing<br/>
&gt;silly songs.. falling off.. trying to swim while drunk..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was drunk and fell off the boat once.  It almost seems like there was<br/>
meant to be an NPC bartender down there, doesn&#39;t it?  Ever notice you cannot<br/>
trade, while on the boat?  Or drop anything?  Casters can&#39;t cast spells...<br/>
but bards can sing songs?  (That should be something to keep in mind if you<br/>
play on the racewar server... denon&#39;s anyone? hehe)  However that crazy code<br/>
works for boats, probably won&#39;t allow NPCs.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;PSSS: Does anyone else think it would be the greatest thing to have an<br/>
&gt;undead ferryman that you had to give a copper or silver to in order to get<br/>
&gt;across the rivers around Antonica? Could even make it some Spectre type<br/>
&gt;thing like the river Styx.. The things you think about while running nekkid<br/>
&gt;from Freeport to Qeynos screaming Selo&#39;s eh?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A fine idea!  But really, the ferryman should be somewhere on one of the<br/>
planes!  Anyone else jacked up about the plane of FEAR opening tomorrow?  I<br/>
for one am going in there naked with a drum and a minotaur horn... scout<br/>
around a little!  Fear would be entered through Oasis I presume.  O how the<br/>
spectres will be running around the beach tomorrow I have a feeling!<br/>
