<div id="ygrps-yiv-396356576">Have to agree with you there Jeff.  I was grouping in SolusekA early last<br/>
week with a warrior, paladin, and 2 wizards.  We had been grouping for about<br/>
3 hours when I started realizing what all I was doing.<br/>
First I was singing Anthem, increase attack speed and strength.<br/>
Second I was singing psalm of warmth, damage shield for everyone in the<br/>
group.<br/>
Third I was Chaining them since all goblins just love to run.<br/>
Fourth I was using Pixie Strike against the casters - worked awesome by the<br/>
way, out of around 10-15 shamans and wizards they got off maybe 5 total<br/>
spells.<br/>
Fifth I was using the Curtailing Chant to lower MR and DoTing<br/>
Then when this was over I was healing everyone up.<br/>
Now what class can do all that, while at the same time doing quite a bit of<br/>
damage melee wise.  No one I tells ya no one.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of the higher ups talk about becoming nothing but a mana bard<br/>
when they get up to higher levels so I can&#39;t really say too much on that.<br/>
But right now I am having more fun with my bard than I have had in a long<br/>
time.<br/>

&gt; IMHO, the bard class is just fine.  I&#39;m now level 28 and have found<br/>
&gt; absolutely nothing to complain about.  I seem to work great in a party and<br/>
&gt; great without one.<br/>
