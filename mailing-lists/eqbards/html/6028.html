&gt; Ok, I have been &quot;stuck&quot; in level 22 for a good long week now.  I think I<br/>
&gt; have found the cause.  Last time I was at the library in HighKeep, I bought<br/>
&gt; my 23rd level song.  Does anyone else thing buying songs ahead of time is<br/>
&gt; bad luck???<br/>

That&#39;s not the problem &quot;Silly&quot;, it&#39;s called Dying... I was halfway into<br/>
the level when I started helping some poor guys &quot;sickened&quot; by Evil eyes<br/>
in the Gorge.. I died 3 times that evening... I know we all have a<br/>
shield with a great Red Cross painted on it but I can&#39;t tell you how<br/>
many evenings I have lost helping others. A friend who was the same<br/>
level as a cleric is now at 30th and I play hours every day.<br/>
