Still, that&#39;s a far cry from the 200 the other melee classes<br/>
get.  I really do think that this is a very important<br/>
oversight - all the other classes with poor defensive skills<br/>
can do considerable damage at a distance using<br/>
root/SoW/snare/pets to keep the mob away from them.  But<br/>
because we&#39;re a melee hybrid, our primary means of damage<br/>
requires that we be in melee range.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, they can&#39;t cast spells while invulnerable, and it&#39;s<br/>
supposed to have a really long cycle time.  It&#39;s basically a<br/>
last-ditch get-out-of-death-free tactic, to help them run for<br/>
the zone.  Once a cleric casts Divine Aura, he is no longer a<br/>
factor in the fight (other than your party trying to keep him<br/>
alive).<br/>
