<div id="ygrps-yiv-82733261">the price on crystalline blades (11 38) has come down a lot, you may be able<br/>
to pick one up for 600pp or a little more.  it&#39;s not a bad weapon and you<br/>
will feel like you are doing some better damage, if a bit slower.  there is<br/>
also the brazen brass kilij (11 35) which has a better ratio, but looks like<br/>
a normal scimitar (yuk).  the short sword look of the crys blade isn&#39;t great<br/>
but it beats the scimitar.  it&#39;s been a long time but i am fairly sure the<br/>
crys blade is primary only, as is the claws and staff of writhing.<br/>
