<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245757287">I don&#39;t know your level, but I honestly think for a non-twink (?) you are <br/>
equipped decently! Don&#39;t be afraid to ask people to inspect, i&#39;d much rather <br/>
have someone ask me than have a person walk up and spam me with &quot;Bob is <br/>
inspecting your equipment....&quot;<br/>

&gt;Wow, looks like I need to go shopping!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll post this, perhaps somewhere some level 1 bard will think I&#39;m the man<br/>
&gt;hehe!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Head: Bronze Helm<br/>
&gt;Face: Leering Mask<br/>
&gt;Ears: Golden Amber Earrings X2<br/>
&gt;Neck: Spiked Collar<br/>
&gt;Shoulders: Bloodstained Mantle<br/>
&gt;Arms: Bronze Vambraces<br/>
&gt;Wrist 1: Bracer of Erollisi<br/>
&gt;Wrist 2: Bronze Bracer<br/>
&gt;Hands: Lambent Gauntlets (I still keep my elf-hide in reserve though)<br/>
&gt;Rings: Jagged Band, Can&#39;t remember the other, some wedding band or <br/>
&gt;something<br/>
&gt;+2 STR maybe?<br/>
&gt;Back: Banded Cloak (Hehe)<br/>
&gt;Waist: Drakescale Belt<br/>
&gt;Legs: Lambent Greaves<br/>
&gt;Feet: Kobold Hide Boots<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Weapons: Obsidian Scimitar X2, Dragoon Dirk, and my newly dusted off<br/>
&gt;Obsidian Shard - thanks for the info by the way, who knew? A fire proc<br/>
&gt;resisted by fire goblins? Sometimes I truly think I&#39;m the slowest bard in<br/>
&gt;Norrath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Instruments: Hand drum, lute, wodden flute, brass horn.  I live <br/>
&gt;dangerously!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Money?  Not a clue, not very much anymore after buying my lambent jewels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So there, I&#39;ll have you all know that I think the half smurf-half carrot<br/>
&gt;look is going to be very in this season!  At least you guys give us all<br/>
&gt;something of a wish list to shoot for!<br/>

&gt;still too timid in game to ask to inspect hehe.  See you round! </span></blockquote></div>
