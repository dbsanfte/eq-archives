<div id="ygrps-yiv-102563315">Pls tell me if I have been duped but a friend of mine told me that for dual<br/>
wield it does not matter what weapon u have in your secondary hands because<br/>
the speed of your dual wield depends on your primary weapon.  So I used a<br/>
combine ls in my primary hand and use a Mino axe in my secondary hand.  is<br/>
this true for dual wield?<br/>

There is no combine bastard sword for sale anywhere..it&#39;s a mythical item.<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet is to buy a combine rapier, spear, or scimitar, or barring<br/>
that, a longsword.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to open the can o&#39; worms about mino axes and bastard swords, but<br/>
trust me, they are not good weapons.  Sucker bets.<br/>
<br/>
To maximize your dual wield skill, and to take fullest advantage of combat<br/>
songs, use weapons of 30 delay or lower.  Sure, it looks impressive to hit<br/>
for 20 with a bastard sword or mino axe when you only hit for 14-16 with<br/>
another weapon.  But it&#39;s as much as a full second and a half slower per<br/>
swing than the weapons I listed above..and they all have about the same<br/>
efficiency, give or take a few decimals.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever weapons have similar efficiency but there&#39;s a wide variance in the<br/>
delay factor, you&#39;re best served to opt for the faster weapon.  Quick and<br/>
dirty way to determine weapon efficiency is to divide the Damage by the<br/>
Delay.  That number you can use to compare with other weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Since dual wield checks to see if it goes off every swing cycle, more speed<br/>
means more chances to dual wield, netting a HUGE increase in damage over<br/>
time by using a faster weapon.  HUGE.<br/>

&gt;BUT...<br/>
&gt;I am a 19th level Bard on Cazic-Thule. I have used many of the 1H<br/>
&gt;slashing weapons and have become very fond of my 2 combined longswords.<br/>
&gt;I was using the Mino Axe combo, but noticed that even though I did more<br/>
&gt;damage per hit,  I missed ALOT more than with my Combines. My question<br/>
&gt;is this: Until I get some of the higher level 1H slashing MAGIC weapons<br/>
&gt;(i.e. Demon Claw, Crys swords, etc.) I have been looking high and low<br/>
&gt;for the Combined Bastard sword.<br/>
&gt;    I was informed at one time that it was only sold at the gypsy camp<br/>
&gt;in Lavastorm MTNS, but I made a trip there today and they did not exists<br/>
&gt;there. (the swords, not the camp). I have also visited the gypsy camp in<br/>
&gt;Oasis and in one of the Karanas. Does anyone know of any other gypsy<br/>
&gt;camps, or more specifically, the gypsy camp that sells the Combined<br/>
&gt;Bastard sword?<br/>
