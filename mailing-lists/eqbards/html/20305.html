&gt; before becoming<br/>
&gt; software programmers, I decided against Compaq for their use <br/>
&gt; of cheap mother<br/>
&gt; boards, Gateway for mixing and matching motherboards (you <br/>
&gt; might get a good<br/>
&gt; one, you might not) and settled on a Dell p3 700 with 256 meg <br/>
&gt; and a geForce<br/>
&gt; 64 meg video card.<br/>

have to check the Dell catalog at home to be sure.  <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I tell people price-wise to go with Dell or Gateway, quality-wise to<br/>
avoid Gateway like the plague.  The box-of-chocolates feature is bad enough,<br/>
but I&#39;ve never, ever seen any company&#39;s portables fail so quickly as<br/>
Gateways. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How often do you actually use the mouse while playing a bard?  I mean other<br/>
than swapping instruments, as that is a very short distance for a mouse to<br/>
travel and even a lagging mouse can hack it.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, congrats to Shada & Darkfox & Melaniel & anyone else who recently<br/>
dinged.  Slyde & Gilgurth??  Sorry, bad memory, and only 64 MB of it to<br/>
boot.  ;^)<br/>
