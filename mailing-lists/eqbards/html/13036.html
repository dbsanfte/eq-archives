<div id="ygrps-yiv-778887094">Loot rules should be stated at the beginning and when any new person joins.<br/>
You can make up your mind whether to abide it or not - up front.<br/>
<br/>
This concept of the person who can personally best use the item having more<br/>
&quot;rights&quot; to it or even rights to roll for it than other&#39;s prolly developed<br/>
from regular groups and/or guild groups.  If you are consistently grouped<br/>
with players, it benefits the group (or guild) to ensure that everyone is as<br/>
well equipped as possible.  But in pick-up groups, or if you have &quot;guests&quot;<br/>
(non-guild or non-reg group), then I think (imho) that everyone deserves the<br/>
right to roll for any loot. It is their compensation for the risk of being<br/>
in the group.  Now you can modify that rule to everyone can pick any item<br/>
they want to roll for and once they win a roll they are out of the rolling<br/>
until everyone has an item.  This allows some choice and you avoid winning<br/>
something you don&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
This business of casters should not get Yk&#39;s or melee should not get SMR&#39;s<br/>
(or even the chance to roll for one) is unfair because it deprives them of<br/>
their fair shot for compensation.  You can&#39;t ignore the player based economy<br/>
(trading of items.)  The really good items are simply not sold - trades only<br/>
(or long, hard camps.)  And it&#39;s foolish to think that people should have<br/>
&quot;only one&quot; char. So people want items they cant use in order to trade for<br/>
things they (or their other characters) can use.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said - determine what the loot rules are at the outset and decide<br/>
whether that suits you or not.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Yk = short sword of the Ykesha; SMR = Shiney Metalic Robe; FBSS =<br/>
Flowing Black Silk Sash; TBB = Thick Banded Belt - some of the most prized<br/>
loot items out side of the planes.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I stopped by outside Ogg early last night and saw 2 casters working the<br/>
bouncers.  Found out that they could use some extra help and joined &#39;em.<br/>
Surprizingly, they were doing alpha loot order (normally, someone master<br/>
loots and sells and splits.)  Well, after a few kills we had totally lost<br/>
track of the loot order and were forgetting to loot.  Hehe, when you got xp<br/>
on the brain and more cash in the bank than stuff to buy - minor loots are<br/>
really - well, minor.  Then the swarm of newbies arrived and started<br/>
vultching the loots not to mention blocking our view and whining for us to<br/>
buff/heal/give them bags.  Hey bud, you just ninja looted stuff you can sell<br/>
for 10-15pp (ok, you are an oger with really crappy cha+ so maybe 6-9pp) go<br/>
buy yourself a damn backpack if you want one!  And no bards/enchanters cant<br/>
sow!<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. in order to make some room in my bank, I destroyed a no drop wep I<br/>
looted in Kithikor.  They really missed the mark on that zone.  Right idea -<br/>
poor execution. Danger zone -- where the compensation (neither loot nor xp)<br/>
simply does not match the risk and now it&#39;s virtually ignored.<br/>
<br/>

		Yeah, and what I was saying was that in most groups I&#39;ve<br/>
been<br/>
		in, the decision would&#39;ve gone:  Drum.  Bards use drums.<br/>
One<br/>
		bard in the party.  Bard gets drum.</div>
