 </span></blockquote>Is there any clean way to tell if you have a skill maxed?  Sometimes it&#39;s a<br/>
very long time between seeing the numbers on an improvement message, if you<br/>
see it at all in the flurry of battle, and sometimes they seem to pile on<br/>
one another.<br/>

Would it really be so intrusive as a game mechanism if the numbers for<br/>
present and maximum skill appeared on the Skills screen, especially since<br/>
the numbers show up on the improvement messages and since some skills, such<br/>
as trade skills, tell you when you&#39;re doing something trivial.<br/>

I won&#39;t use things like /loc, but I find Awful, Feeble, and such to lack<br/>
sufficient granularity or sense of progress or limits.  I&#39;d settle quite<br/>
happily for somthing graphical, similar to the experience or health bar<br/>
graphs.  As it is the interface is an inconsistent jumble of graphics and<br/>
numbers with little to help relate them to one another.<br/>
