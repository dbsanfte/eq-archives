<div id="ygrps-yiv-736940584">I&#39;ve had both sides of the coin.  Gm&#39;s who were helpful and quick, and<br/>
others who never answered (after 3 hrs I was forced to give up) and even<br/>
insulting ones.  There&#39;s an interesting thread on this on EQVault right now<br/>
concerning the guides who were banned.  Basically I&#39;d say Verant&#39;s reaction<br/>
was idiotic, childish, and insulting.  The guides should have gotten a<br/>
warning, not banned for a one liner in a 20 page document that none of them<br/>
ever really noticed.<br/>

I&#39;ve been quite lucky. I&#39;ve never had problems getting GMs to answer<br/>
my petition/satisfy my problems.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I have an honest face?<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s what I thought too, but apparently the teleport spot for <br/>
&gt;Butcherblock<br/>
&gt;is at about 10,000 ft.  You immediately fall and take 10,000 points anyhow<br/>
&gt;which is as you can guess instantly fatal.  Not good when you are bound in<br/>
&gt;Halas at the time as I was.  The GM&#39;s never responded to my petition even<br/>
&gt;though I was beneath the world and was supposedly teleported to a &quot;safe<br/>
&gt;spot&quot;<br/>
