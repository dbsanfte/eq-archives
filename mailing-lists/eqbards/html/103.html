&gt;I agree - Bards do NOT have to be the bringers of sweetness and light to<br/>
&gt;the world.  The idea that Bards should provide their services for free<br/>
&gt;goes against my thoughts on why we are ALL trying to play Bards...we are<br/>
&gt;each free to do as we please!  Some might want to charge an arm and leg<br/>
&gt;for their services (and sometimes that is a cheap price if a corpse is<br/>
&gt;in deadly territory!), some might wish to gain a reputation for being a<br/>
&gt;&quot;nice&quot; guy or gal and do it for free.  Nothing should be set in stone...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He is not such a good god, I have learned, but I can say one thing for<br/>
certain about ol&#39; Bristley: He&#39;s not stuck up and all hoighty toighty like<br/>
the other gods.  Personally, I have found followers of life to be bordering<br/>
on fanatics.  And I will never go to war on the pixies with my wood elf<br/>
brothers and sisters, those poor pixies are just having fun.  And who could<br/>
kill such cute creatures, nearly transparent robes covering their shapely<br/>
little frames?  Ai yi yi!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe I am good or evil, but kind of a trickster like Bristlebane,<br/>
here&#39;s a story of how I worship my god through my actions:  This giant<br/>
barbarian woman screeched that she was about to commit suicide, so everyone<br/>
in greater Faydrak could hear her, &quot;Come and get free stuff.&quot;   I turned<br/>
around, and there she was, standing right by me there at the main lift to<br/>
Kelethin.  So I decided to make some small talk, y&#39;know ask why she was<br/>
killing herself all that.   Shamans are weird, never did get an answer.  But<br/>
perhaps it was because all manner of folk soon had me wedged in front of<br/>
her, I couldn&#39;t even move!  With a great leap and accelerando, I managed to<br/>
free myself, and then climbed a hill to look down on them all.  They were<br/>
this clump of elves, dwarves and gnomes, with a smattering of other races as<br/>
well, all grouped together real tight.  I snickered and grabbed my lute,<br/>
such a dark evening, so many people, perfect time for a song!  And I lit &#39;em<br/>
all up!  You know the tune!  With each chorus of my song, every person in<br/>
that mob glowed like a torch!  Now, no one was hurt here, it was just<br/>
visually stunning, but lo the curses that rained on me!  Who am I to stop,<br/>
however, it just looked too good, so I continued and let the fiery glow of<br/>
my song blind the mass, an allogary of their greed.  Bristlebane, however,<br/>
rewarded my pleasure with a merry chase by the town drunkard... all the way<br/>
to lesser faydark.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of Bristlebane&#39;s house of worship?  Must journey there one day,<br/>
if such a place indeed exists.<br/>
