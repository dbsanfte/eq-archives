<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641227099">Our first guild night in Mistmoore, we killed the butler and<br/>
got a fang.  We decided rather than lotto it, we&#39;d hold onto<br/>
it as a guild and wait for a maid fang.  That way we wouldn&#39;t<br/>
end up with one person holding a butler fang and another<br/>
person holding a maid fang.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, I was playing with a friend&#39;s guild.  They&#39;d<br/>
been camping the tower, but it was slow so we discussed<br/>
moving.  Someone suggested camping the maid - drops a +5<br/>
wis/int wreath, and the fang.  Nobody knew where the maid was,<br/>
but I had a hunch based on where we killed the butler.  <br/>
Besides, she&#39;d been on my tracking for the last half hour so I<br/>
figured I could always use that to find her.  :)<br/>
<br/>
So we snuck everyone in invis.  I wasn&#39;t sure the hall spawn<br/>
would stay in the hall if we went straight for the maid, so we<br/>
cleared the kitchen first, then moved to the hall.  As we were<br/>
clearing the first of the hall mobs, three high level persons<br/>
(red to me at 42) went past us invis and started attacking the<br/>
maid.  Grrr.  We figured we&#39;d lost the room, but still had a<br/>
pretty nice spot deep inside the castle so finished our fight<br/>
in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it turned out the maid, two other mobs in the room, and<br/>
two hall spawn were too much for their group, and they evac&#39;ed<br/>
before killing the maid.  We cleared the rest of the hall,<br/>
then moved in to kill the maid.  She dropped a fang.  Only me<br/>
and another bard were in the lotto (the paladin bowed out<br/>
since his ghoulbane was better, and the druids wanted the<br/>
wreath), and I won.  Then a L50 druid pestered me for an hour<br/>
trying to get me to trade/sell the fang to her.  :)  Funny<br/>
thing is, she kept offering me stuff that was worse than the<br/>
EBW.  If she&#39;d offered me something equal or better (but not<br/>
as rare), I might&#39;ve jumped at the chance to get some nice<br/>
items for my guild; but as it was, I figured she was hoping I<br/>
was clueless and trying to rip me off.<br/>
<br/>
We spent the rest of the day there, got 4 wreaths for various<br/>
friends, as well as a butler fang, which I let the other bard<br/>
have since my guild already had one I could use.<br/>
<br/>
So basically, I got both fangs off the first butler and maid I<br/>
ever killed.  :-P I had to wait longer for the avenging<br/>
caitiff to show up (6 hours) than I did for the butler or the<br/>
maid. :)  I couldn&#39;t figure out how to get him to give me the<br/>
quest info, so I took a chance and just gave him both fangs.  <br/>
Presto - electrum bladed wakizashi (7 dam 21 delay 2 wt).<br/>
<br/>
I think I will dual wield it with my sceptre of rahotep when I<br/>
feel like showing off rare weapons (yeah, I ran across him<br/>
too).  :)<br/>
