&gt; I&#39;ve noticed this phenomenum a lot in Unrest lately, and I&#39;ve heard people<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been peacefully sitting up against the wall, minutes after a battle<br/>
&gt; healing my party up and strange things happen.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Picture this: There I am resting quietly, 100 feet away from the house.<br/>
&gt; *Creaaak*, opens the door.  A dry bones skeleten is standing there, takes a<br/>
&gt; look around, spots me out of a crowd of 30 camped players sitting against<br/>
&gt; the wall, and makes a b-line for me.  We handily dispatched him and all got<br/>
&gt; a good laugh.  30 seconds later.  *Creaaak*, opens the door.  A reanimated<br/>
&gt; hand is standing there, sniffs the air, spots me again and makes a run for<br/>
&gt; me, completely ignoring everyone else.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.<br/>

is getting on the hate list of a mob that&#39;s stuck somewhere.<br/>
Usually it&#39;s drybones in the attic (next to the hand room).<br/>
They can&#39;t walk down the stairs so they stay up there, casting<br/>
spells at you through the floor if you go up to the second<br/>
floor.<br/>
<br/>
Once you&#39;re on their hate list, any mob that passes near them<br/>
&quot;learns&quot; about you and you get added to their hate list.<br/>
Since they&#39;re not stuck in the attic, they come out of the<br/>
house and make a beeline for you.<br/>
<br/>
If this happens to your puller, one of two things can be<br/>
happening.  You&#39;re being added to the respective hate lists<br/>
for helping your puller (via your songs).  Or the mob makes a<br/>
beeline for your puller, and just before he gets there he sees<br/>
you helping your puller (via your songs) and switches to<br/>
target you.  Either way, things end up attacking the bard.<br/>
<br/>
The only solution I found was for the entire party to zone to <br/>
clear everyone out of any hate lists.<br/>
