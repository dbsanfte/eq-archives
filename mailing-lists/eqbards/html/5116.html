&gt; You must need incredible Dex then because my base is 124 and with a Shaman<br/>
&gt; buff it is 161, I still miss alot of notes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This could well be.  I don&#39;t claim to be absolutely correct on this, but I<br/>
think dexterity also has more face validity than charisma does when it comes to<br/>
whether you miss a note.<br/>
<br/>
Also note that the frequency of missed notes depends on how long you have had<br/>
the song in question.  When I first tried playing chords of dissonance with a<br/>
horn, the missed notes were just unbelievable.  I was like a junior high school<br/>
band.  :)<br/>
