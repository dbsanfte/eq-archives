But seriously, yes it is a rp abomination, I wish we could actually pace<br/>
things off though or mapping dungeons would be impossible.  Since we can&#39;t<br/>
pace things out, I&#39;ll accept the pain of /loc as the programming nightmare<br/>
of allowing us to use 100&#39; of rope to measure out dungeons would be<br/>
insurmountable I suspect.  Better just to assume that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing, (I<br/>
do wear a cloth cord!) or pacing off, and live with the ugliness of it.<br/>

Personally I consider /loc a debugging command and a roleplaying<br/>
abomination.  I refuse to deal with it.  If we are to have such a pin-point<br/>
locating and finding capability, it should be a proper in-game mechanism,<br/>
not a computer programming artifact.<br/>
