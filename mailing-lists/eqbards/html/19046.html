<div id="ygrps-yiv-413532872"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Only thing you need in Dalnir is off the Kly Imprecator (sp?).  The<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; coin (Royal Crown of Dalnir) for the Ancient Coin Quest<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am doing this quest at the moment and have 4 of the coins. I just need the<br/>
Dalnir one and the Kaesora one.<br/>
I been all the way through Dalnir a couple of times now and never seen the<br/>
Kly Imprecator.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please spoil me and tell me where exactly he spawns. We<br/>
cleared out the whole third level a couple of times while camping the Kly<br/>
and never saw him.<br/>
<br/>
Also any tips for Kaesora? I&#39;ve never been there but it sounds a bit of a<br/>
nightmare. Luckily I am part of a regularish group of level 43 to 52 players<br/>
so I&#39;m not too worried about getting killed.<br/>
<br/>
Also spoilers on the location of the coin in Kaesora would be most welcome.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The placeholder (Kly Overseer) dropped a full group of 6 40+ members<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday we killed the Overseer with no problems with the following party:<br/>
<br/>
Paladin 51<br/>
Mage 52<br/>
Shaman 51<br/>
Bard 43 (Me)<br/>
<br/>
Its was quite good fun, apart from the Overseer dropping no loot at all, no<br/>
coin, no words etc, nothing in the 6 times we killed him.<br/>
