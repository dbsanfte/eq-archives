 </span></blockquote>Interesting that you pick one of the few classes that didn&#39;t stage a sit<br/>
in as they ultimate in whining. From my direct experience, Warriors were<br/>
way less whiny than Druids and Necros were, most Warriors I started out<br/>
with back in March picked the more direct route of just not playing<br/>
Warriors any more (for real, not just threatened to)<br/>
<br/>
Of the Warriors I was grouping with in March and April, most had either<br/>
quit or rolled up a different class by May. On Tarrew Marr, only 2 or<br/>
the 10 or so I knew in the fast leveling crowd actually stuck it out<br/>
until L50. The only other class I noticed had a high attrition in the<br/>
first wave of people to 50 were bards.<br/>
