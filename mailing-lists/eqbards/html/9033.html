<div id="ygrps-yiv-359518940"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  So i go to the cemetary, i see a<br/>
&gt;named invisible npc with a book in hand named something like Ssinn or<br/>
&gt;something like that. Hmmm i think to myself, maybe its the red robe npc and<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s green to me and scowling ready to attack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyways, to make a long story short, i screwed up big time, Turns out it <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;a quest npc for the sol ro temple<br/>
&gt;your faction with sol ro got worse<br/>
&gt;your faction with shadowmen got better<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ugh!  and to top things off i decided to get creative before this and went<br/>
&gt;all the way in the castle to the gypsie room (woohoo i know where they are<br/>
&gt;now) and decided to tap her on the shoulder and make a run for it<br/>
&gt;screetching to  the zone....  i didnt make it *mumbles something about<br/>
&gt;casters*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Though i died, i still came out ahead at the end of the night and laughed<br/>
&gt;about my mini train, but the faction hit really hurt, im now apprehensive <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;the temple and the npcs wont talk to me unless i use my faction song,<br/>
&gt;luckily the other bard that took the hit had killed many shadowmen to get<br/>
&gt;his faction up and he&#39;s still ok in the temple.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I killed Synnthi (I think that&#39;s the name..?) in MM twice before I realized <br/>
the faction hit with Temple of Solusek Ro. So later I went and visited the <br/>
temple and the npcs there were apprehensive like you, and would not talk to <br/>
me. Using faction song of course fixed that, and then after making a couple <br/>
lambent gems I noticed my faction had gone up enough that they would talk to <br/>
me again. It&#39;s not a huge loss, just don&#39;t kill the npc in MM more than a <br/>
few times and you should be fine. If not, go kill some Shadowed Men, they <br/>
will fix your faction eventually.<br/>
