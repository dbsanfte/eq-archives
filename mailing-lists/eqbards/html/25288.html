<div id="ygrps-yiv-82129576">I still have charm mem&#39;ed as a standard but don&#39;t use it all that much at<br/>
57. I use mez (SoT) Alot though. I can only recall one time that I charmed<br/>
enough continuously to be near oom, that was once in Sebilis without a<br/>
chanter and before I had SoT. I have base INT for a WE which isn&#39;t much and<br/>
no special INT/Mana + items.<br/>

Maravana, Gratz! Our epic is really really nice! The one thing I had to get<br/>
used to was the song animations, most of which need some attention: Male<br/>
half elves stick the sword thru their heads on wind/brass songs, mine tends<br/>
to chop thru my chest a bit on stringed, maybe because I&#39;m female, who<br/>
knows. The one thing was that the animation goes off and it looks like you<br/>
aren&#39;t meleeing when if you look at damage messages you still are. I kept<br/>
thinking the mob was out of my melee range. <br/>

Sylly, try www.eqdive.com for instructions on doing the Undead bard/Trak.<br/>
It&#39;s pretty simple though: you talk to him, go thru the responses and he<br/>
just wants you to give him the quest lute body. He gives it right back to<br/>
you and aggros but he&#39;s fairly a wuss even though he cons blue to me. Trak<br/>
spawns as soon as the bard dies. What we did was to clear all the jugs, the<br/>
Seb protector and Jumpy first. Then we did the undead bard part and when he<br/>
aggroed, pulled him back to the bridge and killed him there. Then we made<br/>
sure everyone was fb/fm, sent a nec in to pull Trak to the back of the lair,<br/>
sent the melee/cleric groups in to keep him there and that let the casters<br/>
take up position safely at the mouth of the lair. The first time I tried to<br/>
do this step, we were all in the lair and something happened that caused<br/>
Trak to instantly aggro and kill all our casters when he spawned. Needless<br/>
to say, we lost that round and he despawned while we were doing CR. I think<br/>
this Trak will stay up for 2 hours so there&#39;s no reason you have to fight<br/>
the bard and the dragon back to back. <br/>
I&#39;m becoming a firm believer in dragon killing is all about keeping control<br/>
of who has main aggro. We Zergrushed Sontalak with about 60 people last<br/>
night and failed nearly instantly due to people not letting main tank build<br/>
enough aggro to start. Sont turned on everyone that healed even once and<br/>
wiped everyone out in very short order. The second try was very successful<br/>
even though some folks left.<br/>
