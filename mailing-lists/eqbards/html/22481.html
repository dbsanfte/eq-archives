&gt; &gt;I recently found out about the commands such as /book (very nice for my<br/>
&gt; &gt;casters), etc. - and the eq manual supplement sucks as far as listing<br/>
&gt; &gt;commands.. does anyone know/have a definitive listing of commands?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nice. Was there a reason the following were omitted or did I just miss it?<br/>
<br/>
/cast #<br/>
/sit (on/off)<br/>
/pause<br/>
<br/>
Also, it would be nice if they were separated into different sections by <br/>
type, but heck, it&#39;s a great list anyway!<br/>
