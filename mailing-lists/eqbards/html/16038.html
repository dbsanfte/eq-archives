Dual wielding is completely independant.<br/>
<br/>
The delay of your primary hand has nothing to do with the delay of your off<br/>
hand. That being said, if you want to dual wield a lot, put a very fast<br/>
weapon into your off hand.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things to keep in mind:<br/>
<br/>
Dex only affects proc&#39;ing rates of the main hand weapon<br/>
Minimum damage (at high levels) only affects the main hand weapon<br/>
<br/>
So, conventional theory at high levels is to put your fastest weapon in the<br/>
main hand since you are guaranteed a minimum damage level. The only time to<br/>
violate this is if you have a procing weapon that you want to proc a lot.<br/>
<br/>
At lower levels, with no minimum damage, the conventional theory is to put<br/>
the faster weapon in the off hand so that you will dual weild more.<br/>

trades I I didn&#39;t have much else to use them on and Dual Weild is a huge<br/>
event after all that wimpy thrashing around, so I wanted to be up to speed<br/>
as soon as possible. THe next one you will want to dump a lot in is safe<br/>
fall, and you have some levels to go for that.<br/>
You want your fastest weapon in your primary hand and your bigun in your off<br/>
hand as that gives you the most chances to dual wield. At 25 I am *still*<br/>
using a dragoon Dirk and PGT, though it is getting a bit long in the tooth<br/>
(and mostly now I use all instrument attack)  it is perfect for 17-24. Even<br/>
if you don&#39;t get a PGT get a dragoon dirk for your primary weapon, even when<br/>
you stop using it you can put it in your throwing slot for it&#39;s bonuses, and<br/>
it&#39;s numbers are actually better than your longsword. Don&#39;t bother with the<br/>
tenticle whip, though a barbed one would be fine.<br/>
