&gt;&gt;Let me guess - you were just singing the Rhythm songs, right?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Try playing them with a drum.  Up til about level 17 I&#39;d say<br/>
&gt;&gt;their use is minor.  At 17 you get Guardian Rhythms which<br/>
&gt;&gt;stacks with the other two Rhythm songs (those two don&#39;t stack<br/>
&gt;&gt;with each other).  With a drum and playing Guardian and<br/>
&gt;&gt;Elemental Rhythms, you should be able to get your party&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;magic resist up over 75.  If a caster buffs everyone with<br/>
&gt;&gt;Endure Magic, that should be close to 100.  *Nobody* can raise<br/>
&gt;&gt;magic resist like a bard can.  As far as I know, the best<br/>
&gt;&gt;Endure Magic spell only increases it by 30 points.  At level<br/>
&gt;&gt;29 with a battle drum, I can raise it by close to 80 points.<br/>

&gt;Actually the new cleric buffs later will raise me at least 50 pts. When i<br/>
&gt;alternate guardian and mystic shield with the drums i get my own mr over 190. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I just though I would throw some info into the idea bank for you.  One<br/>
of my characters is a 27th level Wizard. (BTW I love the clearity song)<br/>
Anyway, when I am bord and have nothing to do I work on training my<br/>
evocation specialization.  I simply cast the first level Shock of Frost<br/>
spell on myself (other players if there are any around)  It does a max of 6<br/>
damage to me (non to other players because I am not dueling them).<br/>
Generally I gain a point in specialization about every bubbel of mana or two.<br/>
But I digress, the point of this was to let you know that I have cast a<br/>
crap load of low level spells on myself.  Now granted I only have about 50<br/>
- 80 MR (depending on the buffs on me) I think I have only resisted my own<br/>
spell about 1 time in 100 castings.  I know my MR is a far cry from 113 or<br/>
even 190.  But, it seemes to me that your chance of totally resisting a<br/>
spell are probably based more on the level of the casting creature.  I<br/>
think MR as well as Cold and Heat Resistance only let you take less damage<br/>
from the spell.<br/>
Though even with my 60 cold resistance I always seem to do 6 damage to myself.<br/>
<br/>
So in conclusion I think your level has to do with totally resisting spells<br/>
but your other resistances have to do with partial resistance to damage spells.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps someone.<br/>
