<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365617806">HighHold Pass - an interesting zone for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I logged in and decided to do some exploring.  Instead of using my<br/>
invisibilty, I just wandered around like a moron.  It was around 5pm Central<br/>
time so the campers had not yet arrived and the Orcs were in control.  I<br/>
stumbled into them and managed to escape to the guards.  You&#39;d think that<br/>
would be enough of a warning to me but no I hadda go back for more and the<br/>
rest of the dorcs nailed me. Grrrrr!  Needless death - I don&#39;t even wanna<br/>
look at my xp bar. Grrrrr!  Wrong place - wrong time.<br/>
<br/>
The early part of the night goes by and I have some adventures.  But I<br/>
figger it&#39;s time to go back and get some xp.  So, back in HH I go looking<br/>
for a group to join back by the dorc side.  Nobody will have me. Wah!! So I<br/>
wander around but end up back there in not too long. Well, the place is like<br/>
a tornado tore thru it.  Ded bods all over. And only a couple inky casters<br/>
hanging about. <br/>
<br/>
And then I look up....Hargis Shraylock!  He&#39;s spawned! I shout to the zone<br/>
Hurry!  The two casters there start wailing on him.  I equip my weps and<br/>
jump into the fray. Hmm, one brave caster is ded. And the second one is not<br/>
looking too good either! So here I am whacking away as hard as I can and<br/>
bellowing like mad! Maybe - just maybe I can put enuff dmg into him.  And<br/>
then the second caster dies.  <br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s me and old Hargis (sp?) I am dropping hp and old Shrylock is not<br/>
giving up his hp too easy.  Pierce, slash, bellow, heal. anthem, rinse,<br/>
repeat... I am dipping into my 2nd last bub of hp and KA-BOOM! Down he goes!<br/>
I am looting him like lightning wondering what will happen if I die with the<br/>
loot window open - as two of his hench-orcs are pounding me.  Hey lookie<br/>
there!  Some kinda spear thing!  Right-click, right-click (I sure hope I got<br/>
open slots)  Excuse me dorcs, I cant stay and play - I gotta zone!<br/>
<br/>
Yup - I nabbed a Shiny Brass Halbred!!!  Grr - not able to equip it.  Well,<br/>
I guess I can sell it - or find some suitable purpose.  Yay!  My first big<br/>
time loot!!!  I got lucky for sure!  Right place - right time!!<br/>
