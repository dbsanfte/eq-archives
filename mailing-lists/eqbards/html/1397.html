&gt; I twist the two for the strength gain, or twist chords and warsong<br/>
&gt; for hard<br/>
&gt; to hit foes.  I rarely twist with healing since even though the<br/>
&gt; icon stays<br/>
&gt; up it doesn&#39;t seem to actually heal unless you are playing it when<br/>
&gt; a pulse<br/>
&gt; occurs, just like chords.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have tested the healing song, and it does indeed continue healing<br/>
even if you aren&#39;t playing the song.  Just start up the song and then<br/>
stop it after you get the indicator for it.  Then press &quot;i&quot; to go to<br/>
inventory/stat screen and watch the numerical representation of your<br/>
health.  You&#39;ll see it is still green (which I think indicates your<br/>
health is being adjusted by some positive effect) and you&#39;ll see it<br/>
jumps up by more than just 1 point for the next two ticks.  Net<br/>
effect of starting up the healing song and stopping it as soon as it<br/>
takes effect is 3 ticks of enhanced healing (the one it actually<br/>
starts up on and the next 2 that it lingers for).  Twisting healing<br/>
with other songs can be a very effective way of surving those<br/>
monsters you&#39;d otherwise only have a marginal chance of taking out.<br/>
