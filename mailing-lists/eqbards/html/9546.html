<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-896811268">Which mob drops the bard armor? I heard tell that bard armor has been<br/>
moved from PoF  (boogeymen) to PoH.<br/>
Mummy monks - warrior armor, clerics of innorukk - cleric armor, male<br/>
revenants - mage armor, female revenants - enchanter armor, gargoyles -<br/>
rogue armor, spite golems - shaman armor.<br/>
Now this leaves a few mobs.. the ire (somethings or other. they look<br/>
like ghouls), the ashenbone drakes  (mini dracoliches), the scorn<br/>
banshees, the liches (mini spectres), and possibly some other mobs left<br/>
that i didnt see.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows, please do tell.<br/>
