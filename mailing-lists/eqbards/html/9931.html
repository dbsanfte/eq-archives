<div id="ygrps-yiv-687544715">Why hide?  Maybe you are standing by the tree in CT court yard and need to<br/>
go afk for just a sec and are too lazy to camp but dont want to be trained?<br/>
The mobs see thru invis (casters do) and maybe your party has a pet (which<br/>
bard invis would kill) and maybe your party used their own invis which bard<br/>
invis would kill or maybe you just dont want anybody to see you &lt;g&gt;<br/>

p.s. foraged food has that &#39;gritty&#39; taste - i prefer milk and muffins<br/>

I never hide (why exactly would a bard above 19th use hide), I use forage<br/>
religiously.  If you use it all the time, you can actually generate quite a<br/>
lot of food and water.</div>
