<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916151770">I associate the AGI stat as how good you are controlling your legs and body.<br/>
I associate the DEX stat with how good you are with your hands.  If Dodge is<br/>
affected by a primary stat, it seems to me that AGI is the most likely one.<br/>
With that said, everyone knows that not everything in EQ is logical.  Case<br/>
in point is the vodka recipe that is the current hot topic on the brewers<br/>
list.  People have been trying for weeks to discover this recipe.  All kinds<br/>
of logical ingredient combinations were tried.  This week the recipe was<br/>
discovered/leaked by Verant.  One of the ingredients for vodka is short<br/>
beer.  No way in hell would anyone ever think to include beer as part of a<br/>
recipe for vodka.  I&#39;m sure there are other examples out there.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning AGI and AC, I know for a fact that AGI increasing items have at<br/>
least a one for one effect on AC.  When I equip an AGI item, my AC goes up<br/>
the same amount as the item value.  Same for AGI buffs like Feet like Cat.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has there been anything difinative(said by the bard programmer) about a <br/>
&gt; &gt; bards agility stat being used to check if the bard has succesfully used<br/>
&gt; his <br/>
&gt; &gt; dodge skill?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In other words is it worth while for bards to raise their agility so<br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; &gt; dodge more often?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No there hasn&#39;t. However, other people I know have checked this and they<br/>
&gt; feel (without rigorous testing it&#39;s only a feeling) that dex is actually<br/>
&gt; used as the check for whether the dodge skill goes off, just like parry<br/>
&gt; and riposte. What agi is supposed to affect, and there is quite a bit of<br/>
&gt; debate on the usefullness, is the number of times the mob will outright<br/>
&gt; miss you. A friend of mine experimented a bit with this and he felt<br/>
&gt; there was not a huge difference between the number of times he was<br/>
&gt; missed in fights with an agility boosted up close to 200 with items and<br/>
&gt; buffs, and an agility of slightly over 100. At least in his case, he<br/>
&gt; felt you were not better off trading off ac for agi once your agi is<br/>
&gt; over 100. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; High agility is definately not reflected in higher ac. And ac determines<br/>
&gt; how much damage you take when the mob lands a hit. <br/>
