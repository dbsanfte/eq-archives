<br/>
I just wanted to share my excitement with the folks on this list I have been<br/>
a part of for over a year, I went on my first Plane raid last night on E&#39;ci<br/>
and it was a blast.  The were only 2 bards on the raid of 47 people<br/>
including me and the other bard, Strattos, had most of his imbrued already.<br/>
Strattos was very cool and gave me lots of pointers when I got up there, not<br/>
sure if you are on this list Strattos but if so, thanks for all your help!<br/>
 <br/>
It was a great night, both Maestro and Inny were up and Maestro was dual<br/>
wielding 6-note blades.  We failed in our first attempt on Maestro but we<br/>
reorganized and took him down with few deaths on try number 2.   The battle<br/>
against Innoruk went faster than Maestro with few deaths and we took him<br/>
down on the first try.  I ended up getting a Six Note Blade and Imbrued legs<br/>
with only one death but was not in a group that was getting any XP,<br/>
nonetheless it was great fun.<br/>
 <br/>
The thing that I thought was the coolest was that 8 individual groups of<br/>
people went up there and worked together without bickering over items and<br/>
XP, I&#39;ve been playing EQ for over a year and a half and this is truly a<br/>
right of passage for me.  Thanks to everyone on this list for all the great<br/>
advice over the months that has helped me to be the best bard I can be<br/>
within the limitations of Verant&#39;s world.<br/>
