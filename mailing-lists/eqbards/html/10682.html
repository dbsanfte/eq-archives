<div id="ygrps-yiv-99647880">Heh heh, no doubt.  I tried to go to the king&#39;s room on E&#39;ci this weekend to<br/>
get some greaves.  It was camped by Fubarrh, Bolenie Sandwich, and Ironhide.<br/>
It was unbelievable.  They were willing to let me get some greaves if they<br/>
got em, but their tactics were below questionable and we all watched as some<br/>
fool shaman tried to solo the ice giant diplomat.  Worst thing was, it RAN<br/>
from him.  Right over me, I went right between its legs.  Needless to say<br/>
when it came back down the ramp it bought about 20 gobs with it killing<br/>
many, except the castes of course who simply gated.  Didn&#39;t someone once<br/>
claim they were so frail they&#39;d always be the first to go.  The melee types<br/>
had zero chance of escape and the caster&#39;s had zero chance of death.  And<br/>
they said Selo&#39;s was unbalancing in allowing train avoidance indoors?  Yeah,<br/>
right.  How fast travel can be unbalancing but instantaneous travelling is<br/>
not I fail to see.<br/>

   I always had a soft spot for mini Harmonics running around, as <br/>
   I too am a old hoot who remembers the hardships of those days.<br/>
   I have a silvery war axe and another crystalline blade in the<br/>
