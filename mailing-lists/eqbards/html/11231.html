<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324405851">Jeez that sounds familiar.  Same thing happened to a ranger and a warrior<br/>
from my guild.  Same spot and all.  And in our situation, the GM&#39;s still<br/>
said tough sh*t.  We finally managed to do the CR after a 6 hour stint with<br/>
the help of a level 30 something Shaman and Druid.  It was a nightmare.<br/>
Glad it worked out for you.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Bard Handicap of Sorts<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I guess my brother-in-law would prefer if I said =<br/>
&gt; &quot;Differently-abled&quot;..  but anyhow - another situation where an advantage =<br/>
&gt; sort of works to our disadvantage..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I had the nastiest of nasty corpse retrieval problems in lava in Sol =<br/>
&gt; A.  Last week I fell in lava (not sure how it happened - I think it was =<br/>
&gt; lag relate.. So never having been in that situation I start running =<br/>
&gt; (swimming?) through the lava to try to find a way out.  Can&#39;t figure it =<br/>
&gt; out - so I try to retrace my steps and eventually die.  I petition to =<br/>
&gt; try get help - and the guide says no more than &quot;get a friend to help&quot;.  =<br/>
&gt; I had a gig Tuesday night so I had to leave..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     After my Wednesday gig - I come on at 1:00 AM and my west-coast =<br/>
&gt; Druid buddy is about to log - so he agrees to help me.  He casts =<br/>
&gt; levitate on me and I start looking for my corpse.  He gets attacked and =<br/>
&gt; has to zone.  I find corpse - and try to drag it out - and realize there =<br/>
&gt; is a zone to Sol B in the lava (not marked on any maps I&#39;ve seen btw).  =<br/>
&gt; Zone back - try to drag it the other way - and to my horror - I discover =<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a waterfall (or should I say lava-fall type thing) that I can&#39;t =<br/>
&gt; climb over.  Basically there is no way out of the lava in that area.  =<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure what to do - so I start to loot my corpse when levitate =<br/>
&gt; wears off and I die - with my stuff split between two corpses.  My Druid =<br/>
&gt; buddy has to log - so I put it off till later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Another gig Thursday - late one - so I can&#39;t get on after.  I had a =<br/>
&gt; date Friday - and a gig Saturday (great week huh - four gigs and a =<br/>
&gt; date!) but I got home again around 1:00 AM last night.  I petition for =<br/>
&gt; help - and all the guide says is - &quot;Get a Wizard or Druid with group =<br/>
&gt; gate to get out&quot;.  Wonderful.  My Druid buddy had just logged - and =<br/>
&gt; someone in my guild mentions he&#39;s not going to be back until Wednesday =<br/>
&gt; (which turned out to untrue - but whatever)..  I start to panic because =<br/>
&gt; my corpse will disappear on Tuesday (they only last a week right?)  I =<br/>
&gt; start telling a paladin friend - who mentions he has a Druid character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     So we meet up - but we get separated - I get lost and death number 3 =<br/>
&gt; (And I whole bubble of XP gone &lt;sigh&gt;).  Run back from my bind point at =<br/>
&gt; Highkeep and try again.  This time we get to the corpse.  Okay cool - I =<br/>
&gt; loot it and say &quot;Okay Gate us out&quot;.  And then has says &quot;We need group =<br/>
&gt; gate?&quot;  I say &quot;Sh*t, I thought I explained that&quot;  &quot;You said that was =<br/>
&gt; your plan with the other Druid, but I assumed if we could get in we =<br/>
&gt; could get out&quot;  &quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me say we couldn&#39;t?&quot;  &quot;No I must have =<br/>
&gt; been zoning when you said that&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     So then I say &quot;Oh no my levitate ran out&quot;  So he casts mine as his =<br/>
&gt; runs out.  Tries to cast his own, fizzle, fizzle, he dies.  So there I =<br/>
&gt; am in the lava - can&#39;t get up the Lavafall - Can&#39;t gate out.  Then I =<br/>
&gt; remember the zone boundary there.  I have a fresh levitate - so I have =<br/>
&gt; plenty of time - figure if I can&#39;t find a way in Sol B - I can at least =<br/>
&gt; zone back and be no worse than I was before (a bit better since only one =<br/>
&gt; corpse).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     As it turns out - with Levitate - there was no problem getting to =<br/>
&gt; dry land in Sol B.  The only problem I had there was that the higher =<br/>
&gt; level characters there were pretty much jerks and completely ignored my =<br/>
&gt; please to show me to the zone.  Eventually I find a nice guy who does so =<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m to safety.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Meanwhile my Group-gate-less Druid buddy died trying to find the =<br/>
&gt; corpse on his own (didn&#39;t remember to ask me if I took loc).  So I give =<br/>
&gt; him the loc - and tell him I&#39;ll help him with locate.  So we are about =<br/>
&gt; to try again when the server crashes.  By this point it&#39;s 3:00 AM and I =<br/>
&gt; tired.  We both do get in - but there are like only 500 people on - and =<br/>
&gt; I decide a) I&#39;m too tired and b) too few people on - with all the Gob =<br/>
&gt; Casters that have see invis - we&#39;ll get attacked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Okay - assuming you&#39;re still reading this you&#39;re wondering what the =<br/>
&gt; hell the Subject has to do with the story - so finally I can get to the =<br/>
&gt; point.  I log this morning at the set time I told him I would to help =<br/>
&gt; him get to his corpse - and he&#39;s already on (in his primary char) and to =<br/>
&gt; make another long story short (I can do so when I really want to!) he =<br/>
&gt; had a GM retrieve his corpse for him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I start to get angry about this - why did they help him and not me?  =<br/>
&gt; Basically - he did find the corpse - and could drag it - but he couldn&#39;t =<br/>
&gt; loot it.  Being at the bottom of lava - there was no way he could target =<br/>
&gt; it.  No target no loot.  I was easily able to target it by using the =<br/>
&gt; locate song.  So in a sense - by having the locate song - we were able =<br/>
&gt; to avoid a situation where other players can get GMs to help them get =<br/>
&gt; their corpse.  We never have it easy &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Well anyway - I was ready to quit the game if I lost all my items; =<br/>
&gt; and while I&#39;m a full bar of XP back - I have my stuff; my friend has his =<br/>
&gt; stuff - and I can go back to trying to get to level 32 so everyone will =<br/>
&gt; love me!<br/>
