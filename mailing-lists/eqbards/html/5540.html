<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010846746">My strategy for Lavastorm was mainly weaving three songs.  Chords, Bellow,<br/>
Elemental Rhythyms.  Thinking back on it that did minimize the actual<br/>
hitting of the beasties.  I know many people scoff at Chords of Dissonance<br/>
or say its too dangerous, but sed carefully and properly it can really<br/>
increase the damage you do.  Bellow gives me the equivalent of kick when<br/>
soloing, without the caster disrupting effect, and Chords gives me what<br/>
amounts to a DOT that doesn&#39;t end until they die.  It makes it pretty easy<br/>
to solo 2 &#39;risky&#39; blues, so long as they aren&#39;t total brutes.  By the time I<br/>
Bellow/Pierce the first &#39;risky&#39; down the second one is already down a third<br/>
of his hp&#39;s.  <br/>

&gt; I&#39;m thinking Lavastorm.  I&#39;ve had some fun ther at 16th, and it requires a<br/>
&gt; bit different strategy thn normal.  How many people weave Elemental<br/>
Rhythyms<br/>
&gt; as a full time part of their attack strategy?  In Lavastorm its a<br/>
&gt; requirement with al the hot monsters there.  There will be a lot of things<br/>
<br/>
Does Elemental Rhythms really *do* anything to their attacks?<br/>
I know the drakes cast fire-based spells and the fire resist<br/>
help then, but they were mostly green to me at L16.  The fire<br/>
elementals have a fire shield, and ER didn&#39;t lower the damage<br/>
I took from that.  Nor did ER reduce the damage I took from<br/>
their melee attacks.  In fact, the best strategy I can think<br/>
of for Lavastorm is to have a caster cancel the elementals&#39;<br/>
fire shield (pretty sure this can be done - works on barbed<br/>
bones).  Mobs have so many hp you wind up taking a ridiculous<br/>
amount of damage from the shields alone.<br/>
