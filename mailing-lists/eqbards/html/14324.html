<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423231437">I understood your context.  Still don&#39;t agree with it though.  As a class,<br/>
bards have complained far and away less than all the other classes.  I think<br/>
thats why when we did complain about a few important issues, Verant listened<br/>
to us and for the most part agreed, hence the recent upgrades to the class.<br/>
<br/>
Some people believe in the &quot;squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot; philosophy.<br/>
Others believe in the &quot;don&#39;t cry wolf&quot; philosophy (i.e. don&#39;t raise a stink<br/>
unless its legitimate).  Who knows which is the best way when it comes to<br/>
getting something out of Verant.  The recent necro rants fall under the<br/>
first category.  I think the bard complaints fall under the second category.<br/>

&gt; &gt; As to your statement about &quot;constantly complaining bards&quot; I think you<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; totally off base.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never said we are constantly complaining bards, if you check the<br/>
&gt; context,<br/>
&gt; I wondered if that is what Verant sees us as.  When one is complained to<br/>
&gt; often enough they may get frustrated and see someone like that<br/>
