<div id="ygrps-yiv-837128050">i was wondering if any of our 30+ bards on this list has gotten to use this <br/>
item.  it comes from a 30+ named gypsy musician in mistmoore.  I asked a <br/>
person that killed the musician if it was a lore item or magical or <br/>
anything, but as far as he could tell, it was neither.  it has the same wt <br/>
0.5 as a regular drum, so I am curious to know if it improves songs any when <br/>
used with songs.  Since it was off a named mob, the guy did not want to sell <br/>
it to me just yet, because no one knew the worth.  anyone know about this?<br/>
