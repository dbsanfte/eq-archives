<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864633668">You used to zone in and get mass slaughtered at the gate until they took the<br/>
zone down that morning a few days ago and brought it right back up.  after<br/>
this, zoning in has been safe.  we use the same tactics, and fight in the<br/>
south spot first, then after clearing the area move down west to a second<br/>
spot.  ranger, shaman, and paladin armor seems to be plentiful.<br/>
unfortunately bard armor is more rare.  we have yet to see a BP, the only<br/>
piece left that i am dying for (have legs and boots).  we&#39;ve gotten hit by<br/>
the glare lords but they are pretty easy with clerics stunning them to<br/>
death.  and like you said, more than 3 mobs and we start shouting GG.  3<br/>
mobs are very doable with a couple enchanters messing.  usually from the<br/>
south spot the boogeyman pull from the house is usually all 3.  and we have<br/>
yet to kill cazic because every time we pull him he crashes the zone like<br/>
the samhains and boogeys sometimes do.  anyway, let me know when you get<br/>
some more armor, unless its a BP cause i will be too jealous =P<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ok, Bards are an adventurous sort (usually) so I thought I <br/>
&gt; would pick the<br/>
&gt; &gt;minds of my comrades in song. (smile).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The Fear Plane... great loot, great XP... HARD monsters.... <br/>
&gt; or so that&#39;s all<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve &quot;heard&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You enter the zone, instant death. You enter the zone, <br/>
&gt; instand backstabs for<br/>
&gt; &gt;400-800 points. You enter the zone, you can&#39;t leave except <br/>
&gt; by Evac and even<br/>
&gt; &gt;THAT only works 10% of the time. The list of horror stories goes on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;WHAT is TRUTH? Can you fight at the zone and flee if it gets bad? How<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;different&quot; does magic work? Do our songs work??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;ANY info and tales appreciated!<br/>

&gt; ******<br/>
&gt; THIS IS GONNA BE JUST CHOK FULL OF SPOILERS. DO NOT READ IF <br/>
&gt; THIS SORT OF<br/>
&gt; THING RUINS YOUR FUN. <br/>
&gt; ******<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Alright, i fancy myself some sort of veteran on the fear <br/>
&gt; plane after quite<br/>
&gt; a few expeditions. Its hard. I die frequently being a bard of <br/>
&gt; the 48th lvl.<br/>
&gt; Most are stupid deaths like the expedition splits up and i <br/>
&gt; get ganked. A<br/>
&gt; few are just bad luck where 3 things show up and you get <br/>
&gt; nailed too fast<br/>
&gt; for even a loh. When you zone in you will be on a hill top. <br/>
&gt; 90% of the time<br/>
&gt; nothing will be near you and you can safely sit there for an <br/>
&gt; hour. ONE time<br/>
&gt; i zoned in and got backstabbed for 400 by a scareling who <br/>
&gt; then teleported<br/>
&gt; me away from the hill (never that far, but if you havent been <br/>
&gt; there you can<br/>
&gt; run the wrong way and get into a lot of trouble). I died <br/>
&gt; shortly after when<br/>
&gt; i got back to the hill and he ganked me from behind again with another<br/>
&gt; incredible backstab. My team zoned in right as a died. Ah <br/>
&gt; well, after at<br/>
&gt; least 30 zone ins, thats only happened once. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right after you get into the fear plane and everybody is <br/>
&gt; there, i recommend<br/>
&gt; heading south ( i think south) to the corner of the zone. Its <br/>
&gt; just down the<br/>
&gt; hill and instead of running the risk of being hit from all 4 <br/>
&gt; directions,<br/>
&gt; you only have to worry about one and a half. Then have some <br/>
&gt; adventurous<br/>
&gt; soul pull to there. Haromony or the bard lull or a high lvl <br/>
&gt; enchanter can<br/>
&gt; really help with pulling, otherwise you might get more than <br/>
&gt; one which is<br/>
&gt; bad. Two sucks. Three you better have three full groups. 4, <br/>
&gt; start thinking<br/>
&gt; evac. All of my fear plane expeditions have involved three <br/>
&gt; full groups,<br/>
&gt; with everybody 40+. This makes it fairly safe, though at <br/>
&gt; least one person<br/>
&gt; dies every hour. personal gates and evac all have the same chances of<br/>
&gt; succeding as everywhere else. I have witnessed no wierd behavior from<br/>
&gt; spells or songs, everything works as before. I especially <br/>
&gt; loved it when i<br/>
&gt; used appaling screech on Cazic Thules fright henchman and he ran.<br/>
&gt; Delightfully ironic. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A quick mob run down and some tactics :<br/>
&gt; Spiders drop cryosilk which is for the magi classes. The robe <br/>
&gt; is incredible<br/>
&gt; and like nothing you have ever seen. Plus they drop a mage <br/>
&gt; shield thats<br/>
&gt; like the shimmering orb. <br/>
&gt; Scarelings teleport you randomly around and like to backstab <br/>
&gt; for outrageous<br/>
&gt; amounts of damage. The teleport is never that far, but if you get<br/>
&gt; disorientated and run the wrong way.... They drop nothing <br/>
&gt; special that we<br/>
&gt; have found(besides high lvl words and runes, which are super <br/>
&gt; common in the<br/>
&gt; fear plane, our lvl 50 necro just got her 49th lvl pet spell, <br/>
&gt; and all the<br/>
&gt; wizs have their ice come runes). <br/>
&gt; Phantasms fear you which can cause all kinds of problems. <br/>
&gt; They drop nothing<br/>
&gt; special<br/>
&gt; The little toads drop grey shaman armour and fear you also. <br/>
&gt; The worry wraiths drop the purple cleric armour and do <br/>
&gt; something called<br/>
&gt; gravity flux. If you have levitate then you get thrown up <br/>
&gt; like 10 feet and<br/>
&gt; you float down. If you DONT have levitate then look forward <br/>
&gt; to upwards of<br/>
&gt; 600 pts of damage from the fall. Bards are AWESOME for these <br/>
&gt; because we<br/>
&gt; just turn on the group levitate song and nobody gets hurt and <br/>
&gt; you dont ahve<br/>
&gt; to worry about the visible levitate bug. <br/>
&gt; Glare lords. Avoid these at all costs, they have a rain spell <br/>
&gt; that can wipe<br/>
&gt; out an entire party in no time. if you are getting rained on <br/>
&gt; by a glare<br/>
&gt; lord MOVE. Otherwise you will die, and die fast. They drop <br/>
&gt; nothing special<br/>
&gt; that we have found<br/>
&gt; Boogeymen. My personal favorite :), they drop the gold bard <br/>
&gt; only armour.<br/>
&gt; Boogeymen will fear you, but other than that they are a <br/>
&gt; pushover. So far we<br/>
&gt; have found arms, gloves, and boots (boots i got myself). <br/>
&gt; Shiverback gorillas. my second favorite cause they just hit <br/>
&gt; hard and dont<br/>
&gt; do any crazy stuff like all the other mobs. They drop monk <br/>
&gt; only armour like<br/>
&gt; gloves that give serpentsight and a very visually unigue set <br/>
&gt; of greeves. We<br/>
&gt; got 1 monk in our group that has almost the entire set and it <br/>
&gt; looks great. <br/>
&gt; Amgdylan warrios drop the russet armour which is usuable by all plate<br/>
&gt; wearing classes including rogues and rangers. It looks like a sort of<br/>
&gt; copper or bronze sheen.  Great stuff. <br/>
&gt; Amgdylan knights drop the black shadow knight armour. They ht <br/>
&gt; so watch it<br/>
&gt; Gorgons drop the green chain armour for druids. Got almost an <br/>
&gt; entire set<br/>
&gt; already for one druid and it looks great. These guys stun for <br/>
&gt; a long time<br/>
&gt; so carefull pulling them. <br/>
&gt; Tentacle Tormentors. Drop the green plate for rangers. These <br/>
&gt; guys are just<br/>
&gt; like the ones found in najena, have your back to a wall when <br/>
&gt; fighting them<br/>
&gt; Dracolich. So far he has dropped the bone razor (awesome <br/>
&gt; rogue only dirk),<br/>
&gt; staff of undead legions (necro only staff), and some other <br/>
&gt; staff that i<br/>
&gt; forget which only ogre and troll shamans can use. <br/>
&gt; Cazic Thule. Havent killed him yet cause the zone keeps <br/>
&gt; crashing for us<br/>
&gt; everytime we almost have it cleared. Mass deaths always cause <br/>
&gt; everytbody<br/>
&gt; logs in one at a time and gets slaughterd. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So is it worth it? Definatly, the items are just incredible <br/>
&gt; there. If its<br/>
&gt; armour, its no drop though. Thats all i can think of right now :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gendal Concorden, lvl 48 bard of tunare. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes there is a gate out btw, but its just inside the castle <br/>
&gt; so i heavily,<br/>
&gt; heavily recommend evac :)<br/>
