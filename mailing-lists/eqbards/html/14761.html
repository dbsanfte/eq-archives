&gt; &gt; Can anyone gimme a few hints about where and how tough the Solusek<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mage and the Solusek Champion are.  An opinion of how frequent the<br/>
&gt; &gt; spawn and drops are would be helpful too ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am pretty sure that I got mine in the &quot;bar room&quot; in Sol-A.  We were there<br/>
&gt; about 4 hours and I got both items.  We had some mid 30&#39;s rangers with us<br/>
&gt; lower 30&#39;s.  When my regular group tried to break the room at levels 24 thru<br/>
&gt; 28 group, we got spanked.  If you can recruit some mid 30&#39;s types you should<br/>
&gt; do pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Solusek Mages and Champions are just a type of mob, they<br/>
are not a named mob.  They appear in the goblin &quot;castle&quot; area<br/>
of Sol A.  After you zone in and crawl through the hole in the<br/>
wall, make a right turn, hop down the ledge.  There will be a<br/>
door in front of you - everything past it is the &quot;castle&quot;<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Best spot is the king area.  After you go through the door and<br/>
past a grate, turn right and go straight, through a secret<br/>
wall, follow the passage left to a door.  The four rooms past<br/>
that door spawn Solusek goblins, including the king (rare<br/>
spawn).  Mages and Champions will sometimes spawn in place of<br/>
the normal Solusek goblins.  Beware there is a wandering Sol<br/>
goblin in this hallway, and all SOl goblins can see invis.  <br/>
You will need a full group in their low to mid 30s (enchanter<br/>
highly recommended until they fix Lullaby - this was the last<br/>
place I got to use Lullaby before they broke it).  The king<br/>
drops a +str ring, and a so-so sceptre.<br/>
<br/>
Not quite as plentiful is the high shaman area.  It&#39;s a dead<br/>
end so it&#39;s relatively safe.  It&#39;s past the bar area.  Up to<br/>
four Solusek goblins spawn in the two rooms that make up the<br/>
high shaman area (vs. 3-4 in the king room, 3 in the adjacent<br/>
room, 2 in the room after, all of whom can heal through the<br/>
walls).  You could hold this room with just 3-4 low- to<br/>
mid-30s, although you might need more to take it.  The shaman<br/>
drops a nice ring that grants infravision (useful for blind<br/>
humans).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a Solusek goblin spawn *in* the bar area.  <br/>
It&#39;s a nice place to camp though, as there are a ton of<br/>
goblins nearby, each separated into different rooms (i.e. if<br/>
you have a tough fight, you can just skip a room while you<br/>
rest without screwing up the spawn pattern).<br/>
