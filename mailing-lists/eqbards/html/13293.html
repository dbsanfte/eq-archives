&gt; been in so many bad groups lately that hasn&#39;t translated into playing as<br/>
&gt; much EQ as I used to.  I think that&#39;s the biggest drawback to the bard<br/>
&gt; class.  When you get in a bad group, its the bard that pays the price.  At<br/>
&gt; least that&#39;s been my experience.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yep.  Bard always pays the price in poor grouping.  No other class<br/>
  has 50% or so of its resources dedicated to party scenarios.  Bards<br/>
  groups to live, and die as it may be ;)<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve built up some strong game relationships that I continually come<br/>
  back to.  It&#39;s not the game anymore that&#39;s fun.  It&#39;s those people<br/>
  whom I&#39;ve gotten to know very closely that keep me coming back.<br/>
