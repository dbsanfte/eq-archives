 </span></blockquote>Interestingly enough, the highest taunt value spell that a druid seems to<br/>
have IMHO is snare.  I&#39;ve seen a druid NUKE NUKE NUKE and the warrior has no<br/>
problems continuing to taunt the mob... but throw a snare up!  Wow the MOBs<br/>
go crazy!<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, one of the most annoying things for my wife&#39;s warrior is<br/>
those druids, wizards, bards and other wimpy (relative to her) hitpoint<br/>
types is when they run from a mob instead of standing there and taking their<br/>
beating.  Makes it virtually impossible for her to successfully taunt the<br/>
mob off the person.  We always tell our nukers &quot;stand still and take your<br/>
beating! we got healers :)&quot;.<br/>
