<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-463512489">I have a similar problem, but not directly related to twinking.<br/>
<br/>
I started playing EQ with a friend of mine, and since he had much more free<br/>
time to spend on his chars, he was able to advance far ahead of me with a<br/>
number of characters, but usually he would have one that he was working on<br/>
that was near my level so we would hang out and adventure together.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I turned another friend of mine on to the game, someone who had<br/>
been very addicted to UO and did not think EQ was going to be that much fun.<br/>
He started a character and was moving up the levels pretty quick, but then<br/>
at about level 15 he decided that the whole process was taking to long, so<br/>
he bought an account from E-Bay with a 50th level character and a couple of<br/>
20-30 levels characters.<br/>
<br/>
At first this really did not bug me too much, and while I tended to look<br/>
down in general who bought accounts from E-Bay, I cut him some slack. But<br/>
now it is really starting to cause some bad feelings, mainly because he&#39;s<br/>
off adventuring in the planes Guk, Sol B, etc. and I am still looking at<br/>
another 3-4 months at my pace of play to even get into the 40&#39;s where I<br/>
might be able to try those places.<br/>
<br/>
It really make me wonder what I am putting all this work into. While for the<br/>
most part I still have fun, on the nights when I join up with the world&#39;s<br/>
most inept group or worse can&#39;t find a group I begin to think about hanging<br/>
the lute up and calling it quits.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is not something any one of us can change or fix, but I thought<br/>
I would put it out there to see if anyone else had a similar experience.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been playing my bard &quot;Crier&quot; for just under 38 days of &#39;played&#39; time<br/>
&gt; and I just hit level 36.  That&#39;s definitely *not* fast leveling, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen a lot slower.  Before my bard I played a monk up to 23rd and an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter up to 13th while learning EQ and realizing that the best class<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the game was bard..  but I digress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night I saw a level 9 bard in full Lambent, dual Ykeshas, Flowing<br/>
Black<br/>
&gt; Silk Sash, Mistmoore Drums, the works; he was decked out like a level 50<br/>
&gt; that hadn&#39;t been to the Planes.  About four days ago I saw a level 15 in<br/>
&gt; full Lambent, and I assume he had MM Drums and other goodies as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got to say that this was *profoundly* discouraging to me.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; working my ass off for the pieces of Lambent armor that I have and I<br/>
*still*<br/>
&gt; lack the boots and helm.  So here I sit, dejected on the sands of Oasis,<br/>
&gt; being *less* complete than a guy that started his bard last weekend.  Not<br/>
&gt; only that, he literally *laughed* at me for having 38 &#39;played&#39; days and<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; being level 50.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When there ceases to be any way for players&#39; characters to differentiate<br/>
&gt; themselves from one another other based upon level (i.e. time and effort<br/>
&gt; expended), what is the point of continuing?  I want, when people look at<br/>
me,<br/>
&gt; for them to know that I braved death and died many times to achieve the<br/>
&gt; armor that I&#39;m wearing.  I don&#39;t want people to assume that I bought it<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; a farming high level Wizard or Mage or twinked myself with it.  I am now<br/>
&gt; &quot;just another bard in Lambent&quot;.  If the armor was NO DROP it would be a<br/>
&gt; different story.  The bard that I saw in Oasis would have been in steel<br/>
&gt; probably and I would have something tangible and visual over him based<br/>
upon<br/>
&gt; my efforts.  Everyone that saw me would then *know* that I had earned the<br/>
&gt; pieces for myself.  They would know that I had pulled Gypsy Musicians from<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore Castle for a lute, and that I had pulled Gargoyles in Lower Guk<br/>
&gt; for a Basalt Carapace.  The Lambent armor&#39;s not being NO DROP has reduced<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; efforts to inconsequential and unnoteworthy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am seriously wondering what it is I&#39;m doing playing a game that makes me<br/>
&gt; feel this way.<br/>
