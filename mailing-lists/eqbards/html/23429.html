<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179072197">I hate when people say that...  Under the new xp system, a 6th player takes<br/>
a very small percent of xp from the original 5 members.  Assuming the same<br/>
level, here is what happens:<br/>
<br/>
Group5 gets 1000 monster xp<br/>
1000*1.14/5=228 xp per person (no factoring in multiplier for xp penalty,<br/>
which means nothing in this case)<br/>
<br/>
Grou6 gets 1000 monster xp<br/>
1000*1.2/6=200 xp per person<br/>
<br/>
Which means the new player needs to increase your kill rate a mere 14% to<br/>
balance out his presence in the group.  Unless you are in an overcrowded<br/>
area, where you are fighting for kills, that should be no problem.</div>
