I had seen one of your previous posts a long time ago on this subject, but <br/>
couldn&#39;t find it. A very involved system. I&#39;m guessing that there aren&#39;t <br/>
any casual gamers in Afterlife, or if they are, they don&#39;t go on raids or <br/>
if they do, they just know they will not get any loot.<br/>
<br/>
It definitely slants rewards to the full time player: Keep up or drop out.<br/>

&gt;The explanation is very old unfortunately, pre-Kunark.  Kunark changed a lot<br/>
&gt;of things regarding loot for us, but the general idea is the same.  Mobs<br/>
&gt;that require the participation of the guild is assigned a point value.  It<br/>
&gt;was originally only dragons, so Dragon Kill Points.  Items that the mob<br/>
&gt;drops are assigned point values depending on how good the item is,<br/>
&gt;determined by the guildleaders.  You accumulate points by being present at<br/>
&gt;raids, and you use those points to get items.  People who had the number of<br/>
&gt;points necessary to go in on an item would then lotto.  Later tiers were<br/>
&gt;added so that someone with far more points on an item, even if others could<br/>
&gt;qualify, would not need to roll against anyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some items that can be used by multiple classes are limited in certain<br/>
&gt;instances (not haste items, an example is piercing items to rogues before<br/>
&gt;anyone else).  Tradeable items you replace can be kept or turned back in to<br/>
&gt;get your points back.  Anything gained in a single group has no point<br/>
&gt;values, and can be dispensed with at will but almost all of the time items<br/>
&gt;remain in the guild and are given to members in need freely (for example,<br/>
&gt;the day I zoned into Sebilis and was handed a BoH about 5 seconds later).<br/>
&gt;Items obtained using points can never be sold or traded outside the guild.<br/>
&gt;The only exceptions were made recently with items that were just too<br/>
&gt;out-dated or obsolete as to be cared about.  Other obsolete items that still<br/>
&gt;may have little value were drastically reduced in point value, for example<br/>
&gt;Kunark BPs were originally 20 points and Kunark legs were 15 points, but<br/>
&gt;later became 8 and 5 points respectively with the influx of Velious quest<br/>
&gt;armor.  We had a list of each item that any god or dragon dropped for us and<br/>
&gt;how many points they cost, but with Kunark and Velious came an enormous<br/>
&gt;amount of new items and mobs which led to points gained and point value of<br/>
&gt;items being assigned on the fly often by the guildleaders, with adjustments<br/>
&gt;made as more thought was put into it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Later on a system was added to create incentive on participating in raids<br/>
&gt;that were necessary to the advancement of the guild but yielded little<br/>
&gt;reward or points even though the particpation needed was high, specifically<br/>
&gt;Sleeper&#39;s Tomb keys.  The incentive points system gave points for those that<br/>
&gt;participated and deducted points from those that did not.  Bottom line was<br/>
&gt;to create a system that rewards participation and gives the most to those<br/>
&gt;who put in the most time.  Personally I always loved the system, but towards<br/>
&gt;the end I just did not put in nor did I have the time to stay in the race<br/>
&gt;anymore.  Most items are not even lottoed, one person who wants an item<br/>
&gt;usually has the points necessary to acquire it without rolling against<br/>
&gt;anyone.  I would say there are usually 1-3 people on average per item.  That<br/>
&gt;is what I liked, you knew who put in the time and you knew if you wanted<br/>
&gt;something and saved you had an excellent chance of eventually getting it.<br/>
&gt;The converse were some of the Japanese guilds who used far more people per<br/>
&gt;raid and one thing I will always remember was their lotto where 35 people<br/>
&gt;rolled for Gauntlets of Fiery Might.  That is the type of lotto you never<br/>
&gt;see in a points system.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Though I don&#39;t care for point systems, I think that sounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; like a pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; good one. The other only other one I am really aware of is<br/>
&gt; &gt; the DKP system<br/>
&gt; &gt; Afterlife uses. Maybe Shada will fill you in on it. :P<br/>
