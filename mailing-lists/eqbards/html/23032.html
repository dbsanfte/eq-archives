<div id="ygrps-yiv-970868281">depends on your playstyle too.  are you willing to sit your butt down in lower guk and<br/>
never leave for 3 weeks?  or do you have the need for variety and want to go to guk, and<br/>
then over to sol b and then over to karnors, etc.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Whats a conservative estimate on how long it takes to get <br/>
&gt; &gt; from 50 to 53<br/>
&gt; &gt; (three full levels)?  I play on average around 10-15 hours a <br/>
&gt; &gt; week.<br/>
