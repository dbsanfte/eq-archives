<div id="ygrps-yiv-612767792">Got an invite last night - a friend of a friend&#39;s Guild (hehehe no kidding)<br/>
had been there for a while doing respawns and needed to rotate in some warm<br/>
bodies as people were logging.  When I got there to my chagrin discovered<br/>
that the Rapier and a BP rotted earlier in the day ARRRRG!  No armor dropped<br/>
(we got two banshees and they dropped nada) but we took down Maestro (he was<br/>
tough seemed to have a lot more HP&#39;s than the last time I fought him).  He<br/>
dropped me an Evensong as well as a lute and the Hand.  The sad thing - a<br/>
lot of people died (they rez&#39;d me right away) - and the Maestro poofed<br/>
before they could lotto the Hand.  I was trying to see if Darkfox could get<br/>
up to get the lute - but we were still talking about it when it poofed.<br/>
<br/>
Verant really needs to make sure ALL Epic mobs are on a 30-minute not a<br/>
5-minute timer (Darkfox and I are guessing when they upped the poof time<br/>
it&#39;s for 55+ mobs or some such)<br/>
<br/>
QUESTION:  The stats on the Evensong are 11/25 1HB Range 50 (Not so uber<br/>
compared to many Kunark and Velious Item).  What the heck does the Range 50<br/>
mean for this type of weapon?<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] Hate<br/>
<br/>
Well the guild im in is planning to go up to hate this week.  But this<br/>
weekend i got an invite from a friend that was allready in hate so i figured<br/>
i&#39;d gate up early....<br/>
<br/>
Friday night: was allready empty zone practically (1-2 mobs on track) when i<br/>
got there, my friend&#39;s guild was in maestro hall, we proceeded to pull the<br/>
area, another bard logged in (that was in his guild) she got a helm and<br/>
martune rapier.  I have no complaints though, my group was the xp group once<br/>
i started chanting, made almost a full bub. Got tired afterwards, had to get<br/>
some shut eye...<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning: join up with another guild up there, 2 other bards in<br/>
zone, one of which had a full suit, other had bp/arms/gloves.  The one that<br/>
needed pieces went LD just before we pull a banshee, never came back, i got<br/>
boots.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning:  join up with yet another guild up there,  kill a couple<br/>
mobs, 2 cr&#39;s later and 2 banshees, i got myself a bp woot!<br/>
<br/>
All in all i guess im a lucky bard in hate so far, even won a lotto on a<br/>
ruby crown (money money money).  Only thing i really care to get from the<br/>
zone now is legs and lute and maybe a diamond if i&#39;m really lucky, and maybe<br/>
a martune rapier would be nice in offhand.  I really cant complain, so far<br/>
with this char my hate experience has been quite positive<br/>
<br/>
Wonder what i&#39;ll get this week 8)<br/>

&gt; Strangely enough, I&#39;ve spent only one full day in Hate. I was the<br/>
only bard<br/>
&gt; all day as I recall. I got the boots, BP and a Martune rapier. I&#39;ve<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; been back once for just a few hours, it was mostly clean and we<br/>
just went to<br/>
&gt; lend a hand to the crew finishing up after some folks had to camp.<br/>
No bard<br/>
&gt; stuff dropped either time from the Maestro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh btw, I&#39;ve found wisps really really hate clerics. I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
the like<br/>
&gt; since they turned down bard hate. Twice last night in WC my L10<br/>
cleric was<br/>
&gt; ganged by wisps. I started on one, another dove in when the first<br/>
was mostly<br/>
&gt; dead, then it was about dead a third and then a fourth jumped in! I<br/>
only saw<br/>
&gt; the one wisp when I started the fight. I had to run. Later, I<br/>
started on<br/>
&gt; another one and in about 2 minutes, I had five live wisps chase me<br/>
to the<br/>
&gt; zoneline after I killed the first one! Have you ever seen a wisp<br/>
train? I<br/>
&gt; had zoned in and out between fights so there couldn&#39;t have been any<br/>
leftover<br/>
&gt; aggro.<br/>
