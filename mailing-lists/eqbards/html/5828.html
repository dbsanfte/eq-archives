<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423317549">No problem I am glad to help =).  I figured that a fellow bard should<br/>
learn from my 40+ deaths in Unrest since I was a lowly level 14 bard. Here<br/>
are some replies to some statements that you make.<br/>
<br/>
As always a competent group of players is required to do really well, but<br/>
last night was an indication that surviving was possible.  I had a cleric<br/>
and a mage totally lagged last night.  I know in truth that Selo&#39;s is a<br/>
wonderful tool, but I have also learned that SOW can be a good send for<br/>
the rest of your party.  When running you will have to keep close tabs on<br/>
all of the party members because it is eay to lose them.  So it is a toss<br/>
and will depend on the situation.  BTW you are correct about the<br/>
unrooting, but it will become a moot point once you start camping a room<br/>
=).<br/>
<br/>
Actually as a bard I find that the burners have to be of higher levels or<br/>
else the burn is resisted.  Though when partied with well equipped tanks,<br/>
the need for burn is lessened.  The bard could also be older as you find<br/>
that you are the tactical componenet of the group.  YOu be the one taking<br/>
hits and tanking for the caster  if a surprise spawn appears.<br/>
<br/>
Well a group of players level 19-23 can usually take the Ghoul Magi room<br/>
without a problem.  If your casters aren&#39;t of high level it can be<br/>
dangerous when the Werebat spawns.  The bar room and hand room would<br/>
require a group of level 22-26 can hold those two rooms quite nicely.  The<br/>
safety of camping the house is all dependant on the on the number of<br/>
people who can hold rooms.  Never hold the bar room without some group in<br/>
the tower and watch out for trains if those two rooms aren&#39;t camped.<br/>
<br/>
BTW if you are playing any opf the rhythm songs be very careful I have<br/>
seen way too many hag trains make a beeline srtraight for me when exitting<br/>
the house =).<br/>
