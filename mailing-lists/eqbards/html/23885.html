<br/>
given shield of songs, I find march of the wee to be completely useless.<br/>
<br/>
- I actually found a use for this song. :)  I was in Skyshrine with another<br/>
bard.  He was on lute with Dissonance(2) Cessation (48) and Cantana (55).  I<br/>
was on drum doing the 3 chants.  After finding some of the mobs had high<br/>
resists to one of the chants (fire I think) I had a flip through the list of<br/>
other drum based songs and pulled out Wee.  The fights were taking a bit<br/>
longer but betwee the DA and healing from Cantana (well more so the healing<br/>
from Cantana) we would end the fights at full health.<br/>
<br/>
You just never know when... :)<br/>
