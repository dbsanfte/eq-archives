<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139775287">I play a pvp bard on Rallos Zek and it&#39;s relatively easy to stay alive as<br/>
long as you have Selo&#39;s accelerando and a drum.  Groups of Pkers are not a<br/>
common occurrance but it does happen.  There are such guilds out there,<br/>
namely Enemies of Norrath, Covetous Crew, and on the lighter side of things<br/>
Bane of the Living.<br/>

I play Stargazer Erudite Enchanter on Fennin Ro almost exclusively.  <br/>
I have a Barbarian Shaman level 5 also on Fennin Ro but he&#39;s just sitting<br/>
there waiting for me to get bored playing my enchanter.  <br/>
<br/>
In my frustration with the lack of role-playing on Fennin Ro, I started a<br/>
bard on the PvP server (my first PvP experience) and ran him up to lvl 4 or<br/>
5, but the first couple of times I took him out of the newbie zone I found<br/>
groups of level 8 dark elves sitting there PKing over and over again without<br/>
so much as a nod to rp&#39;ing so I gave that up for the time being.  Is anyone<br/>
playing a PvP bard.  Is this experience typical?<br/>
Any suggestions on how to stay alive?<br/>
<br/>
