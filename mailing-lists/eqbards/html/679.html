&gt; Right now, there&#39;s no increased or decreased spell effects using different<br/>

&gt; but never got around to doing.  So use a lute to save a few gold, if you<br/>
&gt; wish, it&#39;s functionally the same as a mandolin.<br/>

or is this just an oversight?  I just assumed it was<br/>
weightless and spent the extra couple gold.<br/>
