&gt; I found that the quickest way to /assist someone in your party was to use <br/>
&gt; the F keys that are already setup for targetting party members. Actually i <br/>
&gt; modified mine. The default config is F2 for the first party member in your <br/>
&gt; list all the way down to F6 for the last. I changed this to F1 thru F5 for <br/>
&gt; party members, just easier for me to remember. I hit the F key for whoever i <br/>
&gt; want to assist and quickly type &quot;/ASS&quot; which is the short version of <br/>
&gt; &quot;/ASSIST&quot;  =)<br/>

and redefine it as assist, then macro that button.  So you can<br/>
just hit an F-key followed by a number key.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
F2 is always your party leader by the way, unless you&#39;re the<br/>
leader.  Makes it easier to explain to other people - the<br/>
party leader picks a target, and everyone else hits F2 and<br/>
assists him.<br/>
