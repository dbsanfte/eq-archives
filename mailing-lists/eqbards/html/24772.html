BTW, if you have any tips for us on places you loved to hunt from 50 on up, <br/>
I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all love to hear about it. I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t have to worry <br/>
about pick-up groups, but I&#39;m also wondering if there are any 50+ zones <br/>
where you can find a pick-up group and not die repeatedly. ;-)<br/>
