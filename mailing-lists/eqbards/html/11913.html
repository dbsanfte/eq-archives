&gt;I&#39;ve found the psalm series extremely useful.  In fact, I was invited down<br/>
&gt;to the spider room/bedroom camp in lower guk, and kicked myself for not<br/>
&gt;having bought Psalm of Purity beforehand.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>aye the Psalm series has a big advantage over the Guardian series. The Psalm <br/>
songs give resist bonus in excess of what guardian gives with a drum at the <br/>
expense of only boasting one resist. So if you know you need a certain boast <br/>
(say poison for fighting Nox) just mem the correct Psalm and weave it in.  <br/>
One night a party I was in took on good old Nox, I memed Psalm of Purity & <br/>
the cleric buffed poison resist & no one in the group got poisoned.  And for <br/>
those you you that do not know Nox&#39;s poison is very nasty.</div>
