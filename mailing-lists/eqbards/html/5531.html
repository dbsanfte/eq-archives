<div id="ygrps-yiv-779110744">Thanks for the recent discussion of Lullaby vs. Charm.  I am always<br/>
interested to hear how other people use their skills, especially when<br/>
it gives me strategies that I haven&#39;t yet thought of.  As I approach<br/>
30, I am interested to hear what other mid- to high-level bards think<br/>
of recent and upcoming songs in my repertoire.  Here are my thoughts<br/>
on the songs in the 20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
20 -- Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding.  I found this to be a great &quot;taunt&quot;<br/>
      when I first got it.  I could pair with a wizard and easily pull<br/>
      a mob off of him.  However, I now feel much more comfortable<br/>
      with the targetted Consonant Chain for the same purpose.<br/>
      Lately, I&#39;ve been grouping with druids who get pissed off when<br/>
      I&#39;ve chained and they can&#39;t snare, or when my chains break their<br/>
      snare, so I&#39;m thinking of reviving this one.  As for the attack<br/>
      speed and AC adjustments, I&#39;ve never noticed any tangible<br/>
      benefits.  Currently never memorized.<br/>
<br/>
21 -- Melanie&#39;s Mellifluous Motion.  Great for getting off the top of<br/>
      the aviak structure in S Karana.  Conceivably a reasonable panic<br/>
      button, but now I&#39;d rather use Appalling Screech for that.<br/>
      Otherwise, it&#39;s just a party game.  It&#39;s amusing (in relatively<br/>
      safe areas) to bounce your casters around while they&#39;re<br/>
      meditating, but, like baking, it seems mainly useful for<br/>
      entertainment.  Currently never memorized.<br/>
<br/>
22 -- Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody.  As far as I can tell, this<br/>
      doesn&#39;t do squat.  Never memorized.<br/>
<br/>
23 -- Selo&#39;s Consonant Chain.  Great &quot;taunt&quot; and as a bonus, it can be<br/>
      used to snare runners if you don&#39;t have a snare caster in the<br/>
      party (or on the mob).  The attack speed slow-down is<br/>
      noticeable, and when combined with enchanter debuffs is truly<br/>
      remarkable.  It quickly superseded Largo&#39;s in my collection once<br/>
      I got it.  I always have this memorized.<br/>
<br/>
24 -- Lyssa&#39;s Veracious Concord.  Um.  Why is this such a high-level<br/>
      song?  As a wood-elf, I don&#39;t care about ultravision.  If I were<br/>
      human, I&#39;d have long ago come up with a decent light source.<br/>
      I&#39;ve never checked to see if I can really see invisible with<br/>
      this, but since I can&#39;t sing it with Shauri&#39;s, the usefulness of<br/>
      that effect seems limited anyway.  Never memorized.<br/>
<br/>
25 -- Psalm of Warmth.  Woohoo!  Although new people are always asking<br/>
      me, &quot;Do you really think we need cold protection,&quot; everyone<br/>
      loves the damage shield.  Even those druids who already get a 15<br/>
      point personal shield are impressed by the 5 point addition.  I<br/>
      always have this memorized, and I am almost always singing it in<br/>
      battle.<br/>
<br/>
26 -- Angstlich&#39;s Appalling Screech.  In the wrong place at the wrong<br/>
      time, this can be a disaster.  However, I have used it<br/>
      effectively a few times as a panic button, giving my party (or<br/>
      what remained of it) time to zone.  I guess it could also be<br/>
      used for reverse-kiting in safer areas, but I&#39;ve never tried<br/>
      that.  Because of its limited usefulness, I rarely have it<br/>
      memorized, unless I strongly suspect a pending disaster.<br/>
<br/>
27 -- Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens.  I was really looking forward to<br/>
      this, but once I got it, I was terribly disappointed.  It seems<br/>
      that by the time I can type &quot;/pet sit down,&quot; the charm is nearly<br/>
      expired.  Does this last longer as my level goes up?  And can I<br/>
      really charm multiple mobs at once, as described in an earlier<br/>
      post?  I thought you could only have one pet at a time.  As<br/>
      someone else noted, it can be useful to pull a single mob from a<br/>
      group that would not normally attack you, or to pull a caster in<br/>
      to your fighters, but I&#39;ll be damned if all of the interesting<br/>
      stuff doesn&#39;t just resist anyway.  Currently, I am not using<br/>
      this at all, except for entertainment in newbie zones, but I may<br/>
      have to re-evaluate this.  (By the way, one of the funniest<br/>
      things I&#39;ve seen in a while was the griffawn that I charmed and<br/>
      told to sit down.  Hee hee.)<br/>
<br/>
28 -- Crission&#39;s Pixie Strike.  If this cleared the mob&#39;s shit-list,<br/>
      it would be fantastic.  As it is, I find it disappointing.  It<br/>
      is certainly no substitute for the enchanter&#39;s mesmerize.  If I<br/>
      can really charm multiple mobs at once, then I see no real<br/>
      advantage to mesmerizing, but if charm is limited to one at a<br/>
      time, then I guess mesmerize could be useful as an alternative<br/>
      to lullaby.  Still, it seems that when mesmerizing two or three<br/>
      mobs, I&#39;d have to pull out of the fighting completely, whereas<br/>
      with lullaby I can still be in there bashing on the same guy the<br/>
      party is attacking.  Not currently memorized, but maybe I need<br/>
      to experiment with this more.<br/>
<br/>
29 -- Psalm of Vitality.  Um.  Okay, great disease resistance.  (No<br/>
      poison resistance at all, despite what I&#39;ve seen on some of the<br/>
      song listings.)  Big whoop.  Am I going to be fighting anything<br/>
      where people are going to care about this?  The last time I<br/>
      fought anything with disease, it was the undead gnolls in Lake<br/>
      Rathe (at the S Karana zone border), and we just had our druid<br/>
      cure us after the fight.  No biggie.  I don&#39;t think anyone in<br/>
      the party would have even cared for extra disease resistance.<br/>
      Does anyone out there ever use this?  I sure don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So, of all the songs in the 20&#39;s, there are only two that I find<br/>
useful enough to memorize all the time.  Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to 30 and 32 for sure.  31 could be nice for<br/>
flying across Lake Rathe, especially when I wake up naked in the<br/>
Arena, as seems to happen all too often.  33 will probably be great<br/>
for Solusek.  (Does it include a damage shield like 25?)  34 looks<br/>
like a novelty.  I have no clue what to expect from 35.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate any observations that run counter to my own analysis,<br/>
plus some insight on what&#39;s coming up for me in the 30&#39;s.  Do any of<br/>
these new songs really rock?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
