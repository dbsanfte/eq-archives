I dont think that anyone disagrees.. Crowding is a problem for higher level<br/>
players  like yourself, but that does not make it less of a problem for us mid<br/>
level players. Part of the problem is maybe also that when you hit 50 like I<br/>
belive you have mentioned there is only so much you can do today. I can imagine<br/>
that after a while you get the feeling that you have &quot;won&quot; the game? If thats<br/>
the case then overcrowding is not the main problem, but rather Lack of 46+<br/>
things to do. As it is today and nomatter how you turn and twist it I still<br/>
think that the wast marjority of the players are -40 Esp after the slew of new<br/>
players that entered after christmas. Verant are working on helping you guys. We<br/>
can argue about how well they are doing (As far as I remember all new zones<br/>
except Temple of Ro have been 46+ zones), further more changes in spawns have<br/>
also been targeted at the rising average level of players (Paw, Kithior, Solusek<br/>
Ro quests).<br/>
I can only imagnine how it would be if I played when there is 2000+ players on<br/>
Bertox.. I think the 900-1000 players(was 500-600 before christmas) that is<br/>
normally online during my playing hours (I live in EU) is very nice. Places like<br/>
Unrest is rather crowded, but when I move to places like Cazic, Rathe mountains,<br/>
Perma, MM. There is plenty of room. I did however try Rathe mountains this<br/>
weekend and it was awfull. Like 3 groups camping (ouch I hate that word) Giant<br/>
skellies and clops&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
What it all boils down to in my oppinion:<br/>
At 46-50th level Crowding is a problem because there is few places to hunt and<br/>
the number of high level players online is more &quot;constant&quot; than when it comes to<br/>
lower level players.<br/>
<br/>
At midlevels (me 29th level) Crowding is also a big problem during peek hours,<br/>
not so much because there is few zones to hunt in, but rather because of the<br/>
sheer number of people online.<br/>
<br/>
I think that Verant needs to do something about both problems.<br/>
More servers, maybe serversplits to help on the crowding during peek hours and<br/>
maybe new zones to spread people out some more.<br/>
Quests and other things geared towards 46+ players to keep those players from<br/>
getting the feeling of &quot;winnning&quot; the game (I bet the expansion will have a lot<br/>
of nice things for 46+ players to do).<br/>

Heh only 200 50.  The diffrence is these 50&#39;s are not the average player we<br/>
are all huge addicts and play a good 10 hours a day usually. So maybe you<br/>
should rethink that. Ok how many 49&#39;s? About 200 again. How many 48&#39;s about<br/>
300. How many 47&#39;s ? About 300 and so and so on. How many 46+ zones ? The<br/>
planes and I guess lower guk and sol b but they have level 30&#39;s in them and<br/>
it&#39;s crowded in with the high levels. You also have kedge keep but the<br/>
spawns in there is like 4-6 hours on most mobs so 2 good groups can go in<br/>
and clear the spawns and leave. So you got sol b, lower guk, and the 3<br/>
planes. Now even when we did all the planes that&#39;s about 30-40 in each<br/>
plane. That&#39;s not even 10% of the 46+ people online. The dragons are a long<br/>
spawn so they get done quickly and fire giants are a 8 hour spawn to. So you<br/>
got all these 46+ people who play a good 10 hours at the least usually 5<br/>
hours a day. So why do you think were ocmplaining now?<br/>
