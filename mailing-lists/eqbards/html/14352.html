&gt; &gt; I ask you this.  If all the caster classes were suddenly removed from <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game would it still be playable at all?  I think not.  Removing all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hybrid and melee classes on the other hand would make the game much<br/>
&gt;harder,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and maybe make some mobs impossible, but otherwise the game would still <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; playable.  To me that on fact is the ultimate statement of proof that <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; classes are absolutely not balanced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thats funny.  My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>
&gt;assertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>
&gt;Paladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>
&gt;types, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>
&gt;time thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>
&gt;levels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>
&gt;spread the damage around quite well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually I have done groups like this in Sol B hunting Bats & Bugs.  You <br/>
need to be very careful not to over pull.  Pulse jig every now & then, and <br/>
weave Clarity and Hymn during downtime (otherwise downtime is unacceptably <br/>
long).  But over all it is alot of fun, since you have to be so much more <br/>
careful :)<br/>
