<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006591834">Well it&#39;s quite accurate go find a level 50 necro and try it. She kicked the<br/>
crap out of my necor. Also I didn&#39;t run the sk/war tests some guild memebers<br/>
did. As for the sea furies ask somebody who was hunting there early on they<br/>
arte just cyclops with a upgrade in level and hp. They forgot to raise the<br/>
ac and attack rating. That&#39;s why when I go after gornit my pet loses a ton<br/>
more hp.<br/>

&gt;Sand and hill giants are L30-35.  Seafuries are L40+ (and<br/>

&gt;Normal cyclopses are L25-28.  I could almost solo one in my<br/>
&gt;low 30s.  Unless they&#39;ve been nerfed lately, the seafuries<br/>
&gt;could eat me alive even at 40.  My friends and I fought them<br/>
&gt;for about 2 hours at 40-45 (4 tanks, cleric, and bard) and<br/>
&gt;they took so long to kill we decided it wasn&#39;t worth the<br/>
&gt;experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; P.S. Why repond to this but skip over my test report post?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Frankly?  I&#39;ve never found your numerical comments to be<br/>
&gt;accurate or concise enough for me to consider them reliable.<br/>
&gt;(That&#39;s not to say you don&#39;t contribute - you provide insight<br/>
&gt;from the L50 viewpoint.  But you&#39;re like a fishing buddy I<br/>
&gt;have.  He knows a lot about fishing technique and style, but I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t believe anything he says with numbers in it.  He&#39;s just<br/>
&gt;not a numbers kind of guy.)<br/>
