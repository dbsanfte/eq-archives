<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017569697">I get momentary pauses of maybe a tenth of a second or so when I turn these<br/>
corners.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the textures for the buildings as much as<br/>
player textures.  There isn&#39;t really a noticeable pause when there&#39;s only 1<br/>
or 2 people by the bank, but if there&#39;s even 10 people, the pause is a lot<br/>
longer (relatively, it pauses maybe half a second.)<br/>
<br/>
How much ram in on your video card?  I have 32M.. that might be why my<br/>
pauses are shorter.. it keeps more textures in Ram..  just a thought.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It also happens when I go to the FP bank.  From the area where<br/>
&gt; the jeweler and cleric&#39;s guild are, you have to go through a<br/>
&gt; series of sharp turns to get to the bank area.  I usually end<br/>
&gt; up doing a 180 on that first turn, as the game loads in the<br/>
&gt; info for the buildings in the new area.<br/>
