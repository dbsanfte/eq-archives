<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661151620">With all the information flying about this guys weapon choices, perhaps I can get some feedback as well<br/>
from you folks.<br/>
<br/>
I like to keep all weapon skills maxxed per level.<br/>
<br/>
These are my current choices.<br/>
<br/>
Ebon Razor (Main hand only.)<br/>
2 Ykeshas<br/>
Ugly Stick (Staff of Writhing) (Main hand only.)<br/>
2 Wraithbone Hammers (Well, I use these for skill increases while Baking actually.)<br/>
2 Enameled Black Maces<br/>
Sainy&#39;s Claw (My favorite weapon I have.)<br/>
2 Obsidion Shards<br/>
<br/>
What weapon combo would work best for me?<br/>
<br/>
I am currently lvl 33 (For Proc determination.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your input in advance. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Heh, he said Ebon Razor was primary only (which I think it is)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It is.. and unfortunately, it&#39;s small races only as well. : /<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hehe well im small (Wood elf) so no problem there..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;With the weapons listed, I&#39;ll deviate from the advice already given<br/>
&gt; &gt;and say you&#39;re better off with the Ebon Razor in primary and SSoY in<br/>
&gt; &gt;secondary.  At least for those specific weapons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That was my impression as well, so thats what Ive been using.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;To use the SSoY in your primary, and take advantage of the extra<br/>
&gt; &gt;proc, you&#39;ll have to put an inferior weapon in your secondary.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ebon Razor is close enough in damage output (it has a better ratio)<br/>
&gt; &gt;to the SSoY that I think you&#39;ll have better total damage with this<br/>
&gt; &gt;combination than with the SSoY and any other weapon you currectly<br/>
&gt; &gt;have in your second hand.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;But, as has been suggested, getting a better offhand weapon might be<br/>
&gt; &gt;the best solution long term.  Only problem, on Xegony, Sionatchies<br/>
&gt; &gt;Partisans are hard to come by.  I&#39;ve been looking for weeks and weeks<br/>
&gt; &gt;to no avail.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; (btw my dex IS above 100, 110 or 108 dont, but defently above 100)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes a better off hand weapon is proberly one sollution. I have been thinking of<br/>
&gt; getting a second yak. My guild can help me there, but the thing is<br/>
&gt; Im not all that impressed with the yak the effects are resisted alot by many<br/>
&gt; mobs and I would for sure prefer a thing like the sioanitchie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Run some /log on tests with a Parser to see which combination is<br/>
&gt; &gt;giving you better results.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Duh, I will do that :o)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the advice you all. Knew I could count on you. This list is the<br/>
&gt; bestest *smile*!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I think I will keep the Ebon razor in primary hand and put the yak in my<br/>
&gt; secondary.<br/>
&gt; Then I will look for a good piercer or maybe a second yak to replace the Razor.<br/>
