&gt;Hi everyone. This is my first post in a while even though I&#39;m a long time<br/>
&gt;reader. You&#39;ll be hearing alot more from me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Books - Haven&#39;t really ready any bard specific novels, but if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;thinking of dabbling in the fantasy genre, you MUST read the Wheel of Time<br/>
&gt;series by Robert Jordan. This guy is described as a cross between J.R.R.<br/>
&gt;Tolkien and Stephen King. He is an amazing writer and hands down my fav.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s currently an 8 book series (most recent was released September 98) and<br/>
&gt;he plans on writing more until they bury him. (Also, there is an EverQuest<br/>
&gt;type RPG planned to come out sometime this year based on this game. It&#39;s<br/>

&gt;As far as this chain goes, I gotta say you guys and gals are the best. I<br/>
&gt;have quite a few characters (sue me, I can&#39;t seem to pick a favorite) and I<br/>
