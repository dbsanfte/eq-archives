<div id="ygrps-yiv-254907180">It is nor required to recast to gain altitude.  You can just use<br/>
intermediate obstacles that are slightly higher and you will &#39;pop&#39; up onto<br/>
them and levitate over them.  My druid does this all the time and can make<br/>
it into the Vox ventilation shaft without recasting or using bard<br/>
levitation.  It takes practice, but it is easy when you get used to it.  I<br/>
can go from ground level to the top of the highest building in Freeport in<br/>
about 2 minutes.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes it is broken for all classes, but... The other classes still have a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I don&#39;t understand why you all think it&#39;s broken for casters?<br/>
  They cannot cast levitate on themselves while they are already<br/>
  levitating - so what?  They never did that before, that I can<br/>
  tell.  You lose lev, remem lev, and recast lev.  The only person<br/>
  I saw jamming on levitate like 50 times was a GM to make him rise<br/>
  high above anyone.  And it&#39;s my belief why they attempted to <br/>
  correct levitate due to the people who would levitate themselves <br/>
  over and over to heights where they could easily overcome obstacles.<br/>
