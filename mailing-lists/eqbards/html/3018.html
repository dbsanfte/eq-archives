<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176097499"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m a fairly young Bard, and &quot;discovered&quot; twisting on my own<br/>
&gt; just fooling around with my early spells.  It&#39;s useful, but as<br/>
&gt; one of the &quot;dextrously challenged&quot; I&#39;m also a bit disappointed<br/>
&gt; since it seems to violate the EQ designer&#39;s statement that &quot;This<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t a twitch game&quot;.  Esp, if what I&#39;m hearing about twisting<br/>
&gt; being both needed at higher levels, and impacted by connect speed,<br/>
&gt; graphics, etc...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of the many reasons why my Bard sits in storage. My wrists are<br/>
physically tired after about an hour of twisting songs. It&#39;s tedious, it&#39;s<br/>
annoying, and what we get for twisting isn&#39;t worth it. There&#39;s only two<br/>
things bards do well, run fast and regen mana for the party. Everything else<br/>
some other class does better and easier and with fewer deaths associated<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
EQ is the fourth gaming system (paper & pencil and computer) to make bards<br/>
so close to being fun but then ruining it by making the player (the person<br/>
playing the character) do extra work for few extra benefits. I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s fixable.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong. I enjoy my bard. I enjoy her because she can run fast...<br/>
grouping (or trying to find a group since there are few high level tanks on<br/>
The Rathe who will group outside of their guilds) is a grand disappointment.<br/>
We do not add much to a party (less downtime, who cares though since you&#39;ll<br/>
be waiting on caster mana).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent countless hours trying to be a better bard. I know much about the<br/>
class. How things work and don&#39;t work. Yet I hop behind any other class and<br/>
I&#39;m suddenly a 10 times more effective character without even being sure<br/>
what my spells or skills really do. It&#39;s sad... depressing because I wanted<br/>
my bard to be so good.</div>
