&gt; &gt; There was a poll on Everlore, I believe, and only 6% of the player base has<br/>
&gt; &gt; a character between 45-50.  Some attention has to be given to high level<br/>
&gt; &gt; folks, but if that poll is accurate, they make up such a small portion of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the population that they shouldn&#39;t get ALL the attention.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brad has already stated publicly that the majority of their customers<br/>
&gt; have mid level characters. He stated this when Paw was upgraded so you<br/>
&gt; can take his &quot;mid level&quot; as someone suitable to play Paw. As Brad has<br/>
&gt; direct access to the customer database, I think this provides a perfect<br/>
&gt; example of the uselessness of web polls. The only thing that poll tells<br/>
&gt; you is that 6% of the people who go to everlore and bothered to take the<br/>
&gt; poll (and only voted once) have a 45+ character. I hope you can<br/>
&gt; understand the difference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bear in mind that what you as a player see in the game is<br/>
going to be inaccurate too.  When you take a random sample of<br/>
players you see in the game, there are two biases:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Your level.  If you&#39;re high level, you&#39;re spending more<br/>
time in high level zones, and thus see mostly high level<br/>
people.  If you&#39;re low level, you&#39;re spending more time in low<br/>
level zones, and thus see mostly low level people.<br/>
<br/>
2.  High level.  How do you get to high level?  By spending<br/>
lots of time playing the game.  So whereas ten L20 players<br/>
might play a cumulative 40 hours a week, a single L50 player<br/>
might play 40 hours a week.  The result is that you see this<br/>
L50 player online as often as you see the ten L20 players.  <br/>
Or put another way, your perception is that there are as many<br/>
L50 players as there are L20 players - for every single L20<br/>
player you see, there is a L50 player online - when in fact<br/>
there are really 10 times as many L20 players.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think there are that many high level players<br/>
(L45+) in the game.  They just have a greater presence because<br/>
they put more hours into the game.  If we were paying for the<br/>
game by the hour, then they&#39;d have clout proportional to their<br/>
playtime.  But we&#39;re all paying a flat fee.  I really hope<br/>
Verant knows what side their bread is buttered on.  (And FWIW,<br/>
my main character is L45.)<br/>
