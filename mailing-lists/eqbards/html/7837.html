Most casters I know have less problem moving through zones than melee&#39;ers <br/>
because of their ability to invis/camou.  An ability they have after 3 <br/>
seconds of rememorizing the spell.<br/>
<br/>
Does that affect your point at all?<br/>

Not really, but I see where you&#39;re coming from. Not all casters get<br/>
invis/camo (CLE, SHA, NEC), and Wizards don&#39;t get it until level 16, so it<br/>
this is not a universal answer for casters.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, your point makes a case for why casters may not need to be able<br/>
to bind anywhere, not for why melee classes can&#39;t live without bind/binding<br/>
anywhere, which is the argument I have been trying to counter.<br/>
<br/>
I hope my threads haven&#39;t been digressing to far away from bards.  If so, my<br/>
apologies.<br/>
