<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622676869">Okay, the bard at the Wizzie spires in NK is part of the newbie spell quest<br/>
that you get from the bard at the fountain in SK.<br/>
(FYI, a necro guildbro of mine has camped the bard in Sk on many occasions<br/>
and has never gotten one of those instruments. :o/  )<br/>

Hail the bard in SK, he tells you of his woeful lovelife and about some<br/>
scoundrel that has stolen some items from him.  The items are:<br/>
<br/>
1. Winds of Karanas (I think that;s the name of it) music sheet (1 of 2<br/>
sheets that are needed.  Also available on the hermit.)<br/>
2. The other sheet of Winds of Karanas (available from the bard at the<br/>
wizzie spires in NK when you give her the cracked flute from the hermit)<br/>
<br/>
Footnote -  A cracked flute  (available from the hermit in SK... he may give<br/>
them to you of you ask the right question, but you can also get them from<br/>
killing him... good money and great exp for small low-20&#39;s grp or mid-20&#39;s<br/>
solo, therefore he&#39;s always camped)<br/>
<br/>
When you return the sheets to the bard in SK, he then gives you a pitiful<br/>
sum of money and one of the lvl 1-4 songs.  Uhm... does anyone see the<br/>
reasoning behind a newbie quest waaaaay out in the middle of SK?<br/>

&gt;There is the bard at the NK wiz spires - Cordelia (does not answer hails)<br/>
&gt;and another in the Hogcaller&#39;s Tavern in West Freeport (gets killed by<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a lot).  Hehe, check out the bard in the tavern in East Freeport - he has a<br/>
&gt;sword in one hand and a lute in the other.   The bard - Misty Storyswapper<br/>
&gt;at the tent in West Karana near Qey Hills zone (and she patrols Qey Hills?)<br/>
&gt;- she talks of Guard McCluskey - maybe she talks more. Maybe you have to<br/>
&gt;swap a story with her?<br/>

&gt; Also, other than bard NPCs in the three guilds and the bard<br/>
&gt;messengers<br/>
&gt; posted in or near all the city zones, what other bard NPCs<br/>
&gt;are there in the<br/>
