<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062939090">Been reading this mailing list (in digest form) for a while now. Kind<br/>
of lurking but I think more of trying to compose my thoughts more than<br/>
anything else. Let me try to now articulate the opinions and thoughts I<br/>
have gathered and not bore you at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ARMOR<br/>
<br/>
This is from a monk friend of mine. It seems at higher level, the<br/>
actually number doesn&#39;t really matter as much. The stats however do.<br/>
Agility and Dex become more and more important in melee it seems.<br/>
Nowadays, the mobs I fight bash me really hard whether I wear the best<br/>
possible AC giving armor or not. It seems that our AC does not rise at<br/>
the same speed as the ATK of the mobs we fight. I depend so much on a<br/>
healer in our group, otherwise I&#39;m stuck with fighting really low blues<br/>
with one or two other melee classes. This makes sense since as you rise<br/>
in level, your defense points adds more to your total AC than the armor<br/>
you are wearing. At lower levels, you hardly had any defense points so<br/>
the AC of the armor played a large role in your overall AC. This<br/>
changes in the higher levels because you gather so many defense points<br/>
that they make up most of your AC and not the armor you wear. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PETITION<br/>
<br/>
I hate petitions. This is not saying that I wouldn&#39;t like to see some<br/>
changes/improvements/additions to the bard class. As far as bard only<br/>
items, let&#39;s not complain. We get to use almost everything out there<br/>
and our instruments are unique to us. In fact consider them our bard<br/>
only &quot;weapons&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
GROUPING<br/>
<br/>
As you level higher and higher, the level gap becomes wider and wider.<br/>
I group regularly up to 5 levels above me and I still get decent exp.<br/>
At lower levels, anything more than 2 levels is unheard of but it<br/>
becomes more and more common and the exp isn&#39;t bad. Maybe someone can<br/>
actually drop official numbers but from personal experience it&#39;s not<br/>
bad at all. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok some favors to ask now. Can I please see a screenshot of the bard<br/>
armor? I want to see how cool I will look in the future hopefully if<br/>
I&#39;m lucky. Unfortunately, I&#39;m a fashion addict (and I&#39;m human too hence<br/>
my armor is mostly lacking in the fashion department) and I would<br/>
really like to see the bard only armor looks. <br/>
<br/>
I know the Mistmoore Battle Drum is great and the Princess Lute doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be anything but a quest item. What about Brahm&#39;s horn? Is it<br/>
brass or is it a wind instrument (like the mino horn)?<br/>
