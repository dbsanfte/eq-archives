<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138292262">It was all done from Dojorn&#39;s isle.  It took him a while. As we sat around<br/>
for over an hour before we started buffing.  I will pay closer attention<br/>
next time (ie  bind sight)<br/>

We&#39;ve had a ranger pull the bladestorms the past few nights now.  They can<br/>
hit them with a Raincaller and 150 ranger arrows.  We&#39;ve also had the blades<br/>
come by aggroing a mob too close Dojorn&#39;s island.  <br/>
We haven&#39;t however been able to get Dojorn to leave his island.  Probably<br/>
some nerf by Verant so that people don&#39;t pull him.  Of course we could just<br/>
go down to island one and take the portal back up to his island, but this<br/>
costs a lot of time and money, especially if we want to go back to gorgalosk<br/>
island afterwards.  Would Verant nerf Dojorn so that he can only be killed<br/>
by spending a lot of money?  Prolly.  Him not leaving his island certainly<br/>
doesn&#39;t accomplish anything else.  Doesn&#39;t make him harder to kill, just<br/>
more time consuming and expensive.  Verant loves money-sinks and lots of<br/>
downtime.<br/>
<br/>
What interested me was Rokenn mentioning some trick that a paladin had for<br/>
making the Blades leave Dojorn&#39;s island.  Just wondering if this is<br/>
something that can be done from Dojorn&#39;s island, or if it also requires<br/>
going up to Gorgalosk island first.  If we only need to go to Dojorn&#39;s, we<br/>
could go up any night of the week and kill him at relatively little cost in<br/>
platinum.<br/>

We got bladestorm(s?) by  pulling I-3 mobs too close to their social (agro)<br/>
range.  We&#39;d pull something and get the something and a bladestorm.  Sorry<br/>
that&#39;s kinda vague but I did not see what exactly they were doing and the<br/>
discussion was about pulling too close to the edge of that side of the<br/>
island.<br/>
