<br/>
Befallen would still be decent experience at your level if you were in a<br/>
group and fighting on the third floor.  You&#39;d have the chance of getting the<br/>
Bone Bladed Claymore, Barbed Arms, Barbed Legs, Dagger of Marnek and<br/>
Gossimer Items (robes ususally).<br/>
<br/>
Najena would be doable too.  Maybe getcha a Flowing Black Robe, tentacle<br/>
whip, barbed leather whip, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The flag room of permafrost would be good if you get a competent group.  At<br/>
20th I probably wouldn&#39;t venture much further in than that - I&#39;d stay there<br/>
and pull.  Since you don&#39;t have Consonant Chains yet, by all means get<br/>
someone who can snare.  If you can see its butt-crack or its amphibius it<br/>
trains badly if you have a runner.  If you have a well-oiled group with<br/>
casters and a druid or cleric, you might go try to take the Preacher Room.<br/>
But do be careful as there are some nasty casters in Perma.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend that you stay outta Sol A.  I have a real dislike for goblins<br/>
in general (and I try not to be bigoted), but that place has a lot of<br/>
serious Wizards in it and they hit very hard.  They killed me twice at level<br/>
34 over the weekend (once by simply knocking me into lava) while trying to<br/>
get my Firewalker Boots.  The place never has very many people in it,<br/>
despite have a really wonderful design and some very, very interesting<br/>
places and some very nice loot.  What that says to me is that the place is<br/>
slightly misdesigned.  The level of the creatures is like 10-20% tougher<br/>
than they should be.  If they would tweak this zone down just a tiny little<br/>
bit it would be vastly more popular.  To give you some idea, there were (and<br/>
I&#39;m not joking) 2,300 people on Fennin Ro this Saturday evening.  At that<br/>
time there were 14-20 people in Sol A with me.  Most of those were resting<br/>
from Sol B, and the ones that weren&#39;t were high level Wizards camping stuff<br/>
for guildmates or secondary characters.  That says something&#39;s wrong - the<br/>
mobs and/or risk of death is too great for the amount of experience or loot<br/>
that you receive.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do any of our great bards out there have some good ideas for dungeon<br/>
&gt; crawling for a 20th going on 21st level bard?  I&#39;ve been hunting a lot<br/>
&gt; outdoors, and can make money pretty fast now if I need to, so I&#39;m more<br/>
&gt; interested in going somewhere that might have interesting loot items.  I<br/>
&gt; have considered Solusek&#39;s Eye but not sure if I am high enough to do well<br/>
&gt; there.  Any other suggestions?  I can solo high blues even I have found<br/>
&gt; since I reached 20th, but prefer to group.  Would there be groups in Sol A<br/>
&gt; that would be the right levels for me?<br/>
