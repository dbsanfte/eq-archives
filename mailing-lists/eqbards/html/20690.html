<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032504540">If your Defense rating is not maxxed out, then in order for it to increase<br/>
mobs have to be attacking you.  Don&#39;t know if they actually have to hit you<br/>
or not.  I never had a problem maxxing out Defense every level until I was<br/>
in my mid 30s.  It was at that level that mobs started ignoring me.  I<br/>
grouped with rangers and rogues a lot and they almost always held the mobs<br/>
attention.  One time though I was the only tank in the group.  Everyone else<br/>
were either healers or nukers.  In the hour or two I grouped with them, my<br/>
Defense rating went up a few points.  Its still a lot lower than my Offense<br/>
though.  Will stay that way for a while since I haven&#39;t played EQ since<br/>
Diablo 2 came out:-)<br/>

Does anyone know exactly how defense works? Either it just raises very very<br/>
slowly or if your raw AC is very high for your level *cough*twink*cough*,<br/>
despite that you take damage, your defense may not raise. If this is the<br/>
case, it is a great anti-twinking measure.<br/>
