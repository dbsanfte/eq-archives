<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686870465"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;When things get hairy, we have the<br/>
&gt;&gt; accellerando  - a near full-proff excape route.  In the situation you<br/>
&gt;&gt; described, if I was getting hit hard and hit a lot, I&#39;d hit accellerando<br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I lasted about 15 seconds.  I tried my damndest to get accell - but kept on<br/>
&gt;getting stunned...<br/>
&gt;While I was stunned the two cents and the legionaire were hitting me..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, I have to admit, I&#39;ve died like that a few times.  Now if I see more<br/>
that 2 things that stun heading my way, I run before they get in range.<br/>
That&#39;s even if they con a high green.  I was almost killed trying to fight 3<br/>
green orc at a time.  I did manage to accellerando away, but it was close.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Stupid me - didn&#39;t know you can hot-key a spell...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It took me a long time to figure this out.  You have to be in windowed mode,<br/>
not full screen.  Then you can drag and drop spell buttons just like other<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well the biggest thing I learned - not to listen to non-bards about what<br/>
&gt;song to use.  The leader of the group (who seemed to know what he was<br/>
&gt;doing) - asked me to turn on the dischord song before starting to fight.  I<br/>
&gt;should have trusted my own instincts than listen to someone else...  I<br/>
&gt;usually start with a buff song - and switch when I feel it&#39;s appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right.  Trust your instincts.  You will probably know more about your songs<br/>
than any non-bard and maybe more about them then most bards, since you<br/>
frequent this group!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I appreciate the advice.  Live and learn (or in this case - Die and Learn!)<br/>
&gt;Getting Stunned is clearly the biggest problem we face in combat!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amen and amen.<br/>
