<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783826220">Heh actually they&#39;ve changed a couple things startign with feing death not<br/>
working and normal gating plus a few others. I don&#39;t remember them all but<br/>
they definitly work diffrently then normal zones. Ahh well we all have are<br/>
opinions.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did find I like about your current post is you mentioned you<br/>
could be off bases kind of nice to not have somebody shove their opinion<br/>
down your throat.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me give an analogy to try to better explain what I was saying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only &quot;fear&quot; that exists in the Plane of Fear is what the players, not<br/>
&gt;their characters, have in their own mind.  This &quot;fear&quot;, due to the current<br/>
&gt;way the Plane of Fear works, is that 1) they will automatically die and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lose<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;hard earned experience and 2) most likely not be able to recover their<br/>
&gt;corpse. Thats some bad mojo and rightfully so.  I agree something needs to<br/>
&gt;be done about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now I will use myself as an example.  I&#39;m a 22d level bard.  Suppose I was<br/>
&gt;considering camping the basement in Unrest or the castle in Mistmoore.  I<br/>
&gt;use these places as examples because I would almost certainly die if I went<br/>
&gt;to these locations.  My reservation about going to these places is for all<br/>
&gt;practical purposes the same &quot;fear&quot; that the 46+ level players are having.<br/>
&gt;The only difference is that I have a better chance of recovering my corpse.<br/>
&gt;If my corpse is deep in the basement, I couldn&#39;t do it myself but I could<br/>
&gt;get the assistance of someone much higher level than me to protect me while<br/>
&gt;I was recovering my corpse.  46+ characters don&#39;t have the luxury of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>someone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;higher helping them retrieve their corpse so, IMO, thats the only<br/>
 </span></blockquote>difference<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;between me camping the basement in Unrest versus them camping the Plane of<br/>
&gt;Fear.  You could argue that this luxury makes a world of difference and<br/>
&gt;makes the entire analogy invalid.  I could be totally offbase here so take<br/>
&gt;it with a grain of salt.  It does make for an interesting, allbeit<br/>
&gt;off-topic, discussion:-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IMO, the Plane of Fear, as well as all others, should have something<br/>
 </span></blockquote>magical<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;about them that takes into account that the Norrathian laws of physics and<br/>
&gt;magic don&#39;t apply in the planes.  Thats pretty much how it works in most<br/>
&gt;fantasy games I&#39;m aware of.  Verant even stated when the Fear plane opened<br/>
&gt;up that magic worked different in there.  In order to do that, they need to<br/>
&gt;add the magical fear, hate, etc. element (or something along the same line)<br/>
&gt;I discussed in my original post.  Obviously if they were to do that, they<br/>
&gt;would have to do some major tweaking of how the planes work.  Offensive<br/>
&gt;capabilities of the mobs would need to be reduced to the point where, when<br/>
&gt;combined with the ideas I proposed, a players chance of survival is<br/>
&gt;near/equal that of what it was before the Plane of Fear was tweaked to the<br/>
&gt;point of where it is now.  Bottom line is that characters should, with a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lot<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;skill, good planning, and a little luck, have the chance to go to the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Planes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(or anywhere for that matter) and afterwards sit around the campfire and<br/>
&gt;celebrate their accomplishment.  Verant will get it fixed eventually (we<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;My brain hurts after this one.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Heh what your suggesting would make the zones worse then it is now.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Believe<br/>
&gt;&gt; me being thrown halfway across zone is enough don&#39;t need anything else<br/>
&gt;&gt; like<br/>
&gt;&gt; that added.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Naeeldar<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Just an idea, but perhaps Verant could reduce the toughness of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; combats<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;in the Planes so people have a better chance of survival but also make<br/>
&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Planes somehow reflect what they are.  For example, in Fear, the players<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;magic resist rate gets periodically checked to see if they become<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt;Could be at anytime, in combat or while they are sitting around.  If so,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;they start fleeing in a random direction.  In Hate, make it where a<br/>
&gt;&gt; player<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;can, if they fail their resist, become consumed by irrational hate and<br/>
&gt;&gt; start<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;attacking anything nearby, monsters or players.  In Fire, players are<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; &gt;other things that could be done similar to these.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t think this is a problem I will have to worry about for another<br/>
&gt;&gt; year<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;or so.  By that time, who knows how the game will work.<br/>
