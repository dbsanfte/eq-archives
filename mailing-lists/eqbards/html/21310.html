<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806604651">ya.. treat space like one big boat ride (aka treat planets like a<br/>
continent). But i do beleive they might want to do something in space or<br/>
players will be dissapointed<br/>
<br/>
but on a gaming scale, this could mean that for instance, look at eq, 5<br/>
continents (once vellious comes out) that&#39;s like 5 planets in SWO. Assuming<br/>
that there&#39;s more then 1 zone per planet *shrug*<br/>

Maybe each planet could be a virtual world and the starships would fly you<br/>
from one to the other.  If too many people are playing on Coruscant you<br/>
would always have the option of just hitching a ship to a different world,<br/>
no more calls for split servers.<br/>

i honestly dont know how they&#39;re gonna pull off the SWO but knowing that<br/>
lucasarts is involved, verant is gonna get a ton of heat reguarding quality<br/>
of product and SERVICE... Lucasarts is a very very rich organization who<br/>
wont let a small company tarnish their name with bad service... they have<br/>
the budget, they&#39;ll use it.<br/>
<br/>
As to how they&#39;re gonna pull off all the land/space gameplay, you&#39;ve got me<br/>
stumped as to how they&#39;re gonna do it<br/>
