<div id="ygrps-yiv-676513755">Heh..you mentioning a psalm song is funny (or not so funny...is to<br/>
me...heh).  I&#39;m 26, so I have Psalm of Warmth.  I normally won&#39;t play this<br/>
song, as it&#39;s normally not needed, at the moment (gives minimal AC, and not<br/>
in any groups fighting &quot;cold&quot; mobs).<br/>
<br/>
However, at times, choosing a 3rd (and in some groups, just a second) song<br/>
to twist in can be difficult.  Sometimes, a group is doing well even without<br/>
you, the bard...hehe.  So, what to do?  Well, since it has a damage shield<br/>
component, Psalm of Warmth is 1st on the &quot;doesn&#39;t matter, so what song will<br/>
I play&quot; list.  Never fails, though, the question, sooner or later,<br/>
comes...&quot;Why are you protecting us from cold?&quot;  Hehe...oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I just still find it amazing that a group will snatch me up, just to fill up<br/>
the group.  Such a pleasant change from the drought of the last few months.<br/>
I was reduced to soloing a druid, just so I could watch the yellow bar<br/>
advance.  :)<br/>

I dont know if I would pick those songs (what level bard? depends on what<br/>
choices were available) but they are not that far off base:<br/>
<br/>
Chains: good snare and atk slow down<br/>
<br/>
Fufil&#39;s not only does some targeted damage but it also reduces the mob&#39;s MR<br/>
(if anything, lead with Fufils so next thing sticks better.)<br/>
<br/>
Psalm of cooling: it gets awful hot and sweaty in Lower Guk and the damage<br/>
shield also helps - especially if more than on mob is awake.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>

Heh with my cleric (who normally plays only in his regular group, but with<br/>
my play I have missed several sessions and need to catch up), I was gfrouped<br/>
with a monk and a bard in L Guk (&quot;How long could it take for us to tfind a<br/>
tank, lets get the ass sup camp while we wait&quot;).  The bard was singing the<br/>
oddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no snarer or slower),<br/>
Curtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh????  I suggested<br/>
singing celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>
anything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.  Oddly she was<br/>
quite competent at crowd control.  With Pixie she was keeping 2 mobs at bay<br/>
with no trouble...<br/>
