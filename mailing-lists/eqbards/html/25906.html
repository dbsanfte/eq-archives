The same thing that&#39;s wrong with the actual adventuring interface:<br/>
<br/>
Endless dialog boxes.<br/>

They expect you to slowly sit through their damned, unabortable text<br/>
blabber,<br/>
no matter how much faster you can read (or, in the cases of other people,<br/>
how<br/>
much they&#39;d prefer audio so they didn&#39;t have to work at reading).<br/>

*** Ah, good point.  It&#39;s especially annoying when you are going through<br/>
something over & over again (e.g. Jecht shot, if you&#39;re playing FF X) &<br/>
have to watch the same animation over & over.<br/>
<br/>
With the combat interface, it&#39;s  (again) this pathetic stop-action setup,<br/>
with constant pauses to navigate endless dialog boxes.<br/>
<br/>
*** That doesn&#39;t bother me.  Actually...I like it.  They should put in an<br/>
option for real time strategy if it&#39;s not there already, since some<br/>
(including Kaz, I guess) find time stopping a bit too easy.  For me it&#39;s a<br/>
refreshing change of pace from EQ, which frequently comes down to hand-eye<br/>
coordination.  If I want a *difficult* game I&#39;ll pickup where I left off on<br/>
each of the Tomb Raiders.<br/>
