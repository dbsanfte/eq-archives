  Pretty incredible luck there. You should definitely do better than a few<br/>
  ancient coins. Message Board is a good idea. There&#39;s got to be some nice<br/>
  armour or weapons they can trade you.<br/>
<br/>
  Btw, the only coin that I had trouble with was the Kaesora because of the<br/>
  way the zone is built. Dalnir&#39;s is 2nd hardest but doable alone. Scorp one<br/>
  is easy if you kill the PHs on the ramp.<br/>

  Tzeetch - it&#39;s the very simple, and very old, Scrap Metal quest located in<br/>
  the bowels of Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>
  Sanfyrd Featherhead (formerly Sanfyrd ontop), will accept scrap metal (in<br/>
  loads of 4 unstacked at a time), which he will give you coins (a few<br/>
  silver or copper) and a random item recovered from the scrapyard, which is<br/>
  usually a rusty weapon, small buckler or Gnomish GlowRod (light source for<br/>
  off-hand).<br/>
  I believe that either 1) there is an incredibly small chance for a really<br/>
  nice item, or 2) it was a fluke. Either way, I just won the lottery as far<br/>
  as I&#39;m concerned...<br/>
