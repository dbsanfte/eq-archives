<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739192581"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Please do not do this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of fiesty people on the list today.  I will make this<br/>
short.  I am going to do what Harmonic wants to do.  If I want<br/>
to call fear/chains, reverse-kiting -or- if I want to play the <br/>
Jig o&#39; Vigor because it makes people feel better, I WILL.<br/>
<br/>
Can we please move on, and get off these kinda of &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
like your style&quot; comments?  I mean come on, guys.  I play<br/>
my way, and you&#39;ll play yours.  There&#39;s no reason to try to<br/>
change any of that.  I&#39;m not telling you all what to say<br/>
or which songs to play, unless it&#39;s a suggestion in a battle<br/>
situation.  I suggest you respect me in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not upset, but I already have a mother who asks me if<br/>
I&#39;m eating the right foods and taking care of myself.  You<br/>
all don&#39;t need to take up that task, you&#39;ve got more important<br/>
things to worry about (so to speak) =)<br/>
