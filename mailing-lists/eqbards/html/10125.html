<div id="ygrps-yiv-320242864">Nope never said that.  Shaman was in full banded, I was in a mix of magic<br/>
armor and some studded (boots and gloves).  My ac was higher and if I was in<br/>
full banded with some bronze i would be encumbered.  The only item above his<br/>
level the shaman had was a glowing wooden crook (from the same mob as LJ<br/>
vest so maybe that&#39;s what you were thinking of).  Given that they now sell<br/>
for 150pp it really wasn&#39;t much above his level if at all.  At 19th I could<br/>
buy 3 of them with my current bank account.  He still beat me last nite even<br/>
though I have only 2 pieces of armor now that is below banded ac, boot and<br/>
cap.  I also have several pieces above banded.  It was a much closer fight,<br/>
but his 9 stuns won out over my dual wield.  If its any consolation he only<br/>
had 17hp&#39;s left so I could easily win at least half the duels if I got<br/>
better luck.  The big problem is his natural str is 40 points higher than<br/>
mine.  My agility is higher but that didn&#39;t seem to be enough.<br/>
Unfortunately this is the last test I can do against this opponent.  He is<br/>
retiring to redo his shaman and give him more points in wisdom.  He<br/>
initially put only 10 points in wisdom and the lack of mana is killing him<br/>
in group fights.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You keep referring back to this unfair test you did.  I believe you admitted<br/>
that the Shaman was equipped with a LJ Vest and other items not readily<br/>
accessible to a level 17.  You were also equipped with substandard items,<br/>
Studded Leather for the most part.  A Bard of the 17th level should be<br/>
wearing Full Banded with a few Bronze pieces at minimum.<br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt that if you did the test again with comparably equipped PCs,<br/>
the Bard would win just about every time.<br/>
