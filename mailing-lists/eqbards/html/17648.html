<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449737926">If this is true (someone please verify)then this (plus the upgraded chat<br/>
series) truly makes the bard a viable solo class (albeit at higher levels)<br/>
with the capacity to deal some serious damage for a change (so long as mana<br/>
holds out).  This is an exciting revelation and if we get this detail<br/>
verified I will be overjoyed.  <br/>
<br/>
It helps to offset much of the ineffectiveness we have felt a higher levels<br/>
where you felt more powerful when you were younger and seem to get weaker as<br/>
you get higher in level (what with our combat skill caps maxing at level 39<br/>
and dodge maxing low and so forth).<br/>

&gt; Word is the L39 charm can be refreshed before the mob breaks<br/>
&gt; out of it.  Of course thinking myself the completely<br/>
&gt; open-minded type, I never thought to test this.  :P<br/>
