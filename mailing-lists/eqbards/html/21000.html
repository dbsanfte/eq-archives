&gt; I am not making a judgement on Abashi. I&#39;m not saying what is or what isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; his job to know. All I was saying was that based on what he wrote in his<br/>
&gt; post, I don&#39;t think he was aware of what we were talking about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whether he should have known or could have known or used to know has nothing<br/>

 In fact, I DO agree with you, that&#39;s what troubles me.  If he doesn&#39;t know by now <br/>
what we&#39;re talking about, how the heck are we supposed to get him to notice?  I <br/>
honestly think that, when we talk about Chains, he thinks we&#39;re talking about the <br/>
early-break modification they made, and when we&#39;re talking about Lullaby, we&#39;re <br/>
complaining about there being a secondary resist, period, or perhaps that we&#39;re <br/>
still complaining about the lack of a secondary resist message.  If he <br/>
off-handedly assumes that this is the case each time he sees a new thread, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t bother to read the thread, then we&#39;ll NEVER get him to get a clue.  If he <br/>
actually READs these threads, and STILL doesn&#39;t get it, it&#39;s even more hopeless.<br/>
