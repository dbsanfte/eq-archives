<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698668814">I maintain EK is excellent for 22-about 26 or so :)  <br/>
<br/>
I definitely recommend song/instrument combat v. weapons.  Song combat<br/>
means you save money on expensive weapons (unless they are gifts).  This<br/>
money can go towards better armor and your songs (instruments are cheap :)<br/>
<br/>
I am not certain that four song weaving is beneficial over three.  I tried<br/>
throwing in either bellow and/or chains with some twists.  Unless you can<br/>
minimize the time with just 3 song coverage (to one second or less), you<br/>
are probably losing more in terms of efficiency than you are gaining with<br/>
extra damage or slow down effect.  <br/>
<br/>
If you zone into EK from Highpass, and go all the way down to the end of<br/>
the ramp, take a left, pass the named gnolls (carefully), there is a big<br/>
hill made of<br/>
rock which is crawling with rock spiders.  Usually, these are plentiful<br/>
and non camped.  Locate one, insult it with bellow, and lure it to an<br/>
isolated area (the zone edge nearest this mountain among the trees is<br/>
good).  Then twist away.  In general, stick to the spiders who /con low<br/>
blue rather than high...it makes a big difference.  If you get poisoned<br/>
early, take the spider to the barbarian guards in the village, and don&#39;t<br/>
hesitate.  Make sure not to sing AE&#39;s around them :o)  <br/>
<br/>
I tended to run later rather than earlier, and it was a while before I<br/>
learned the benefit of picking low blues...so I took some lumps.  If you<br/>
can find a single partner to hunt with (somebody who can cure poison,<br/>
preferrably), you&#39;ll do really well.  <br/>

&gt; Okay, so I&#39;ve got some good suggestions for where - now how about some <br/>
&gt; HOWs?  I mean, I&#39;ve nearly got the hang of 3-song weaving, (I&#39;m too <br/>
&gt; unreliable on 4) - do you recommend that or melee?  Also, is there any <br/>
&gt; equipment I should have or should start looking for?<br/>
