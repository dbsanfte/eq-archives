<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702311257">It happned to me about 2 weeks ago i was wondering around the cave with my<br/>
friend and he got charmed so I ran out.  When you get charmed you 90% of the<br/>
time go to Mel&#39;s room which has 1-2 Mino guards in there and a skel. When<br/>
you become uncharmed you live for about 3 seconds.  After not long he got<br/>
his body back and we were happy.  Later on I got charmed and killed inside<br/>
his room.  I would try and get close and use the corpse command but it would<br/>
always be too far away.  After about an hour and about 3 charms leading to<br/>
dead bodies i tried to get someone to cast inviso on me thinking it would<br/>
work.  I wondered into the cave near my body and all of the sudden Mel casts<br/>
through the wall and charms me again.  I was so mad I thought I would never<br/>
get my stuff back.  I was so close to just giving up, so I said to myself<br/>
ill try 1 more time.  I walked in and made a hot key for the corpse command<br/>
and scrolled it the whole time i was wondering around through the cave.  I<br/>
knew where his room was and I would go slow near it.  I got 3 bodies out but<br/>
none of them were the ones with all my items.  I ran up really fast and kept<br/>
scrolling it, he started to cast so i ran towards the exit.  He charmed me<br/>
but I was heading out the exit to the grass when it wore off and I wondered<br/>
back In and tried again.  After about 3 of these charms not ending up in his<br/>
room I got my body back and I will tell you, I will never go back there<br/>
again.  To me its just not worth it.  I dont understand why they put a (so<br/>
called 53rd lvl NPC) NPC that high in an area of 10th-12th level critters<br/>
and that can cast through walls, attack through walls, and see someone in<br/>
inviso.<br/>

&gt;     Assuming the dangerous creature near your corpse can&#39;t detect<br/>
invisible<br/>
&gt; (?) the easiest way to get your corpse back is to find a kindly magic<br/>
caster<br/>
&gt; type to make you invisible.  Have a hot key equipped with the /corpse<br/>
&gt; command.  Go to your corpse - then walk a bit away - click that button -<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; drag your corpse to a safe location...<br/>
