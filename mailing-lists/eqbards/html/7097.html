&gt;<br/>
&gt;At level 15 when I first entered Guk that *was* the only way.<br/>
&gt;There was absolutely no way for me to get past the Troll<br/>
&gt;guards outside of Grobb in order to be bound there. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;not a tolerance level. That&#39;s a reality.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This whole thing strikes me as a simple troll (hee!) post. Clearly good<br/>
aligned characters being bound in evil cities is absurd. Monks could sneak<br/>
it at one point great. All the danger tolerance level in the world doesn&#39;t<br/>
make it s SMART thing to do (as outlined by John, the hours lost due to<br/>
death don&#39;t make up for the running time). No amount of machismo makes the<br/>
argument make any sense at all. I would suggest we not fuel the trolls fun<br/>
any longer.<br/>
