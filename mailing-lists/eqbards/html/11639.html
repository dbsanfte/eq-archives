<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-707505039">Was fighting in the aviak roost in SK last night.  Had the 22d level<br/>
teleport song memmed so I could get down to the ground fast without having<br/>
to use the ramp.  I was in a party of three people.  The top roost was full<br/>
of spawns.   Three aviaks on the inside and an avocet on the outside.  If<br/>
you attack an aviak on the outside, sometimes the ones on the inside will<br/>
join in.  Told my party I had a neat bard trick to show them.  I lamented<br/>
the three aviaks on the inside, started singing the teleport song, and<br/>
attacked the avocet before I teleported.  I was teleported to the base of<br/>
the ramp.  Before I had time to equip my weapons, the avocet appeared right<br/>
in front of me and started to whoop my butt.  No way he had time to run all<br/>
the way down the ramp.  Also, aviaks don&#39;t fly (which is surprising) so he<br/>
didn&#39;t get down that way.  I assume what happened is that he teleported to<br/>
my new location.  The other two party members had not gotten to me yet and<br/>
by the time they arrived I had lost over half my health.  The avocet still<br/>
had a lot of health remaining when a rook spawned at the ramp base so we<br/>
decided to zone.  A good plan went all for naught.    <br/>
<br/>
I think that if the three of us would have had time to consolidate on the<br/>
ground before the avocet appeared, we would have been able to kill him (the<br/>
other two got teleported a long way from the ramp).  What I can&#39;t understand<br/>
is why he appeared so quickly.  Does anyone know what it takes to trigger a<br/>
mob teleporting to your location?  I don&#39;t think distance on the X-axis is<br/>
the factor.  With Selos, we can outrun almost every mob in the game.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never had a mob that I outpaced by a large distance using Selos teleport to<br/>
my location.  I&#39;m guessing it has something to do with the Y or Z axis<br/>
coding.  I think the base of the ramp is almost directly under the top roost<br/>
and as a result I was underneath the location  where I initially attacked<br/>
the avocet.   I think the game just moved him from the top of the roost to a<br/>
point on the ground directly underneath where he spawned.  <br/>
