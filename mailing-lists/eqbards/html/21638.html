<div id="ygrps-yiv-977217106">i find the more i level up, the easier it is to find groups, if i do an ooc<br/>
asking for a group, i often end up turning down 2-3 groups. That said, i<br/>
moved away from kunark to solo some giants (where i&#39;m still getting tells<br/>
without advertising asking if i want to group).  on a side note, i want to<br/>
thank the people that posted stuff about rathe mountains here and there in<br/>
the past, I&#39;ve taken this info and put it to very good use. I have very<br/>
little time lately to play, so i try to make the most of my time and thats<br/>
exactly how i spend it, charming giants (which is a hell of alot funner then<br/>
a ridge group in dreadlands).<br/>
<br/>
Not only is my xp actually moving fast in a hell level, but the cash is a<br/>
bonus too. In only about 2 and half-3 hours or so, i now have 8 rubies on me<br/>
(i buy them to drop the cash weight) and have gotten well over a bub of xp<br/>
(which in a hell level means about 2-3 bubs normally). Im not a super charm<br/>
kiter yet as some people are but im improving, and its sometimes hard to<br/>
find giants there when other groups are camping them.  Mind you i still can<br/>
drop 3-4 of them before they pull their second one.  Another thing that is<br/>
great about them is they max lev at 37, which is same as our low lev charm<br/>
song so no need for mana.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, thanks for the suggestions to go kill the giants, and also thanks<br/>
for the suggestion on buying rubies with the cash and reselling afterwards<br/>
at a loss of about 10-12pp per gem (big deal).<br/>

P.S. Nothing quite as satisfying watching a 3 druid and a shaman group<br/>
sitting there while you finish off a couple of giants.<br/>

Subject: [eqbards] healsong vs manasong<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hey all,<br/>
<br/>
i heared you talking about bards and their problems getting into groups just<br/>
before the transformation into a manabattery at 32. i didnt have problems<br/>
finding a group but have been frequently asked for that song, finally made a<br/>
hotkey &quot;/g i get manasong at lvl 32, sorry&quot; ;)<br/>
then i grouped with a shaman and noticed him losing health. i asked him and<br/>
he told me he was transforming hp into mana. hey, i thought, this turns<br/>
healsong into manasong! it worked out well of course.<br/>
do you have any experience with that? at wich level do shamans get this<br/>
spell? can other classes do this as well (necros)? if yes it would be<br/>
interesting to see what is more effective, manasong or healsong while the<br/>
casters eat their legs.<br/>
and then, try weaving heal and manasong with this tactic. should be very low<br/>
downtime for shamans this way.<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
