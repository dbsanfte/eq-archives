<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044079675">Dump your leadtek drivers and go get the latest Detonator drivers and turn<br/>
all the bells and whistles on ;)  It totally cleared up any graphics<br/>
glitches I was having and didn&#39;t even blip system performance.  Nvidia&#39;s<br/>
drivers are the only drivers I will use for their chips no matter WHO I<br/>
bought the card from ;)<br/>
<br/>
As to your system errors?  When you replaced your drivers did you REMOVE<br/>
your old ones and set your video back to PCI VGA when you swapped the cards?<br/>

&gt; OK, I know I&#39;m a little late on this (I was on vacation out of town all<br/>
last<br/>
&gt; week) but I wanted to throw in my 2cp and mention a few things as well...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;CPU:  Pentium III, 500Mhz<br/>
&gt; &gt;RAM:  128mb<br/>
&gt; &gt;Video Card (and RAM): Leadtek Winfast GeForce2 GTS, 32mb<br/>
&gt; &gt;Video Resolution: 800x600 (would use 1024x768 but the icons are too<br/>
small)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sound Card:  Sound Blaster Live Value<br/>
&gt; &gt;HD speed (rpm): No idea, but it&#39;s 13gb so probably 5400?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&#39;Net speed:  768k down, 396k up DSL, 56k modem as backup (connects at 44)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Geographic Location: Chicago, IL<br/>
&gt; &gt;Options enabled or disabled:        Sky texturing: Double-layer<br/>
&gt; &gt;        Particle Effects: Low usually just so I can see what I&#39;m doing<br/>
&gt; &gt;        Mip Mapping:  Off<br/>
&gt; &gt;Clip plane distance:  Mostly Max, reduce to 75% in case of need (rare)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;How many songs can you twist?  3, once I surprised myself by accidentally<br/>
&gt; &gt;twisting 4<br/>
&gt; &gt;Do you slow down when it rains?  Never has<br/>
&gt; &gt;How about in Unrest or Kunark?  Some Kunark zones with way too many<br/>
trees,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but not many<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have recently upgraded my video card to a GeForce2 GTS from a Voodoo3<br/>
&gt; 3000.  The Voodoo3 was fine except some spell effects would lag me down,<br/>
&gt; most notably the AOE rain type spells.  So I upgraded.  The visual quality<br/>
&gt; on the GeForce2 isn&#39;t quite as good; the ground ahead gets kind of grainy<br/>
&gt; and/or swimmy and in general things in the distance don&#39;t look as good,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t get graphical lag at all any more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also sometimes get Fatal Error 0E in VXD VMM sometimes leaving EQ or<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; I get bonked to the server selection screen when zoning.  My MB BIOS is<br/>
&gt; current (the BIOS date was only a week old when I got the new MB last<br/>
month)<br/>
&gt; but it is a VIA KX133 Asus MB.  I have been trying various options of<br/>
&gt; settings and everything but was wondering if anyone else had similar<br/>
&gt; problems that they fixed or any other visual quality tweeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to try to get my guild to raid Kaesora soon; it&#39;s the only coin<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; need yet for the Nostrolo Tambourine.  If only somone would produce a map<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; that zone that&#39;s not so confusing and looks better.. hehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, and I recently (ok, a couple of weeks ago) got my hand on Soinachie&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Partisan during a guild attempt to get our wizzies the Brain Bite spell in<br/>
&gt; Karnors.  What a sweet weapon!  And it looks unique, unlike so many other<br/>
&gt; bard-only weapons...   Yeah, I like to swing weapons a lot just because<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; too lazy to keep switching instruments.  =8^)  Most of the time I&#39;m my<br/>
&gt; regular group&#39;s closest thing to a tank...  Plus I have to hit arena and<br/>
&gt; practice my brass skills again... hehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, enough babbling (you know how we bards can get)...<br/>
