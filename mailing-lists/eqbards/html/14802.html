<b>Subject:</b> Level 27 Strategy.  Advice? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-587511261">I´┐¢m now 27, and I´┐¢m currently reevaluating my group strategy.  I thought I´┐¢d post my thoughts for group discussion.  Please disagree with me here though; I like being shown that I´┐¢m wrong as long as it makes me better.<br/>
<br/>
As always, when I get into a group, I found out what classes are there, and look for holes and how I can hep.  First, I need to determine what the group needs, and fill their holes.  But here are common songs I sing, and when I play them:<br/>
<br/>
Healing and Anthem<br/>
These are the two staples.  It´┐¢s hard to go wrong playing these songs.  I may drop healing, if there are a couple of clerics in the party, or anthem if we´┐¢ve got an enchanter doing attack speedups.  But making the cleric´┐¢s life easy is a good thing, and letting an enchanter do crowd control instead of buffing is a good thing too (except that the enchanter speedup is better than anthem it appears).  Also, in a pure caster party, attack speedups are meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
Chaining Mode<br/>
<br/>
Normally, I like chaining the most, since it both does an attack speed slowdown, as well as a movement reduction.  That´┐¢s a very nice combo.  ´┐¢30% attack speed means we´┐¢re coming out of the battle with 30% more health.  Plus, there´┐¢s still another song or two I can twist in.<br/>
<br/>
However, chains will not always work, especially on yellows.  I´┐¢ve been fighting in places where it´┐¢s critical to control runners.  If chains fails a couple of times, the runner can get away.  Therefore, I only do this on blues.  Whites and yellows just have too many resists.  When the mob starts getting close to running, I start twisting 2 songs, instead of 3.  Thus, if I get a resist on chains, I have one more shot before the old chains wears off.  If we are fighting yellows, if anyone else can put up a longer term snare or root spell that will last, that´┐¢s a better idea.  No attack speed reduction, but that´┐¢s nothing compared to letting a runner get away.<br/>
<br/>
So, what song do I twist in?  Normally healing (especially if no cleric), anthem (unless an enchanter´┐¢s doing speed buffs), or Psalm of Warmth for the damage shield.  Sometimes I´┐¢ll do Chant of Battle, but it´┐¢s being shown that stats don´┐¢t really help too much.<br/>
<br/>
Caster Pulls:<br/>
If there´┐¢s an incoming caster, I´┐¢ll swap to drum and bring up elemental and guardian to get up a nice magic shield (plus one more if I can twist 3), until the caster´┐¢s dead.  One problem I have though, is that usually, the caster has already dumped a fair amount of damage on the puller, thus I sometimes wonder about this strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Another caster strategy, that I haven´┐¢t tried out yet is a constant stream of bellows, to interrupt the caster.  Any thoughts here?<br/>
<br/>
Multiple mob pulls<br/>
If we have an enchanter, then it´┐¢s no problem; they handle crowd control.  I can assist in a very large pull, and/or pull the mob off the enchanter with charm.  It is a pure joy to be in a group with a good enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
2 mob pull<br/>
I haven´┐¢t tried it yet, but ideally, I´┐¢d like to hotkey an ´┐¢/assist tankperson´┐¢ and ´┐¢/pet attack´┐¢.  So, I can rapid fire charm, assist the tank (go back into combat), then have the pet attack, then go back to weaving a song or two until the song wears off.<br/>
<br/>
3 mob pull<br/>
Fighters take on mob 1.  Others go after me (classic bard taunt effect).  I pull back (with 2 on me), hit the escape key (to target the next mob that hits me), hit charm.  Take a hit (thus aggroing my charmed mob) and then pull back to avoid the hits.  Then I twist another song or two, until charm wears off, etc.  Ideally, I tie up two mobs.<br/>
<br/>
4 mob pull<br/>
Run if I´┐¢m smart (unless they´┐¢re easy ;).  If not, resort to 3 mob pull strategy (since I probably don´┐¢t have sleep hotkeyed).<br/>
<br/>
A question about a specific case: What do I do here?<br/>
I´┐¢m starting to group with people, and in this party is a tank or two, an enchanter, a cleric, and a necro.  We´┐¢re fighting yellows.  The necro snares.  The cleric heals.  The enchanter does crowd control and speed buffs.  I swear I feel almost useless ;)  In this case, I play healing, Psalm of Warmth (damage shield), and chant of battle (buffs).  We may also have me play anthem to give the enchanter a mana break though.<br/>
<br/>
What about Sleeping?<br/>
I know it´┐¢s a great strategy to sleep a whole crowd if there´┐¢s a dedicated cleric in the party.  However, at my level, I´┐¢ve found that it doesn´┐¢t really work too well.  It seems that I take a lot of hits, when tanks can better absorb the damage.  Thus, when combat´┐¢s over, the cleric´┐¢s out of mana.  If I fought using the other methods, the cleric seems to be in much better mana shape, and we´┐¢re ready to go to combat sooner.<br/>
