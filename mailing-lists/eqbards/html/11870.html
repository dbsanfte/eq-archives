&gt; Speaking of Song taunting...<br/>
&gt; Only thing I can figure is that somehow the code is messed up to the point<br/>
&gt; that when a song pulses, the mobs consider it cast on everything within its<br/>
&gt; radius, whether it has an effect or not.<br/>

everything we sing is AE.  This includes not just the AE damage songs, but all party buff songs as well.<br/>
If a MOB is within the radius, they will notice.  This is why, when fighting in, say, Cazic, you will get<br/>
a pile of lizards beating on you:  1) they wander towards the party, 2) they enter your area of effect, 3)<br/>
unless someone did something to explicitly tick them off, you are now the target.<br/>
