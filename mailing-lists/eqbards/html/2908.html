<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506489418">Hail All,<br/>
<br/>
I recently subscribed to this mailing list & have lurked <br/>
a couple of days to get the feel for it before jumping <br/>
in.  I&#39;m a very &quot;young&quot; (level 3) wood elf bard on the <br/>
Quellious server.  I&#39;ve left Kelethin because of the <br/>
extreme lag, same with Freeport (not to mention that dry <br/>
desert air was murder on my delicate elven skin ;).  So <br/>
as of last night, I&#39;m bound to Rivervale.  Eventually I <br/>
intend to make it clear across Norrath.  Yes, I have <br/>
wanderlust -- is it not a good thing I&#39;ve chosen bard as <br/>
my profession? ;)<br/>
<br/>
You are all so knowledgeable ... I&#39;m learning a lot from <br/>
reading all your posts.  Even though I only have 2 songs, <br/>
I&#39;ve already started playing with the juggling I read <br/>
about here (never woulda thought of that myself).  <br/>
<br/>
Most of the advice I&#39;ve read so far will help me when I&#39;m <br/>
&quot;grown up&quot; a little (a lot?) more.  So I&#39;d like to ask <br/>
all of you for advice for a beginning bard.  I know some <br/>
of the decisions I make at the start will end up <br/>
affecting my success later in my life.  So any pointers <br/>
would be well appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
