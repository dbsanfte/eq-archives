&gt; WOW!   Thanks for all the great replies, fellow Bards! If I were to reply<br/>
&gt; individually, I&#39;d surely fill up everyone&#39;s mailbox with a  lot of &quot;Thank<br/>
&gt; you!&quot; Notes, so I will just say thanks to everyone in this one message!<br/>
&gt; THANKS!!! Some more info, and then another interesting question follows...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some more info: The &quot;Lute of the Gypsy Princess&quot; was looted off one of the<br/>
&gt; Gypsies slain in Mistmoor. I can not say which since I was not there to do<br/>
&gt; the slaying (smile). A group of mid to low 30&#39;s took her, and the person<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; got the lute had travelled with me and msgd me to see if I wanted it. HECK<br/>
&gt; YEA I wanted it, even if it DIDN&#39;T have any &quot;mystical powers&quot;. I still<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; Verant SHOULD make some magic instruments, or perhaps bardic weapons that<br/>
&gt; count as instruments, or instruments that have better effects than<br/>
standard<br/>
&gt; ones, but I digress.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I paid 15 plat for the Lute, and even if it is useless, I shall<br/>
keep<br/>
&gt; it to add to my collections. (smile) I tested it some more with the<br/>
Healing<br/>
&gt; song and there&#39;s no difference in the numbers between it and a normal<br/>
Lute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, many thanks for the help finding Nostrolo the bard in S. Karana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, on to another question:<br/>
&gt; I had a Paladin last night tell me after a battle to play the Jig O Vigor.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t sure why, since Stamina replenishes a heck of a lot faster than HP.<br/>
&gt; And you know what he told me? The Jig O Vigor actually HELPS INCREASE THE<br/>
&gt; RATE OF MANA RESTORATION!  I thought at first that this was bull, and over<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; few hours tried to test it with some mages. They all agreed that it did,<br/>
&gt; indeed, help (however slightly) them restore mana!  Has anyone else tried<br/>
&gt; this? Does everyone else KNOW about this already and I am just now leaving<br/>
&gt; the stoneage? Any input??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you all for the great discussion!<br/>
