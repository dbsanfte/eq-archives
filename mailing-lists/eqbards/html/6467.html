<b>Subject:</b> Mino horn graphic bugged after patch <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-336790408">Damnit, as if it wasn&#39;t bad enough that my drum looks like a stick.  Now,<br/>
after yesterdays patch, equipping a mino horn makes it look like I&#39;ve got a<br/>
small burlap sack attached to my wrist.  Ahh well, guess its back to the<br/>
shop to buy a normal flute.<br/>
