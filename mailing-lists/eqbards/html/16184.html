<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125950134">Did they change the spawn on the assassin and supplier?  Last time I was<br/>
there it was 34 minutes.  We had a stretch where we got 4 assassins (all<br/>
with the mask :( ), and 5 suppliers ( all with the bag :( ) in a row...<br/>
That was maybe 3 months ago, so maybe they changed the spawn times in there<br/>
since...<br/>

&gt; 1. Ok, there are 2 ways.  First: get invis to undead.  Take left side<br/>
&gt; tunnel to vampire bat room.  Then take tunnel on left but inside that<br/>
tunnel<br/>
&gt; *hug the right wall* (greater ice bone skels will agro on you if you<br/>
don&#39;t -<br/>
&gt; they see thru all invis).  Past the GIBS, you get to the bridge to the<br/>
&gt; tower.  Cross and go towards rear.  Look for the 2nd ladder you see (off<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the one side iirc).  The assasin/Supplier room is up that 2nd ladder.<br/>
&gt; Second way if the BR is camped hard and all the deadly black widows are<br/>
&gt; dead, take the right tunnel and from the vampire bat room go right thru<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; bugs - longer way but no GIBS (only bugs heh).  It eventually pops out on<br/>
&gt; the side of the bridge to the tower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Prolly 35 to 45. The named&#39;s are tough.  Mean back stabs - keep your<br/>
&gt; back to the wall at all times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Go at popular times to get the feel for the area and have lower<br/>
&gt; risk.  Then go back at slower times to try to get a group.  I think the<br/>
mask<br/>
&gt; is regarded as a class specific novelty these days - since its bard rogue<br/>
&gt; only.  You may be able to get loot rights just by asking and waiting.  Oh<br/>
&gt; yeah waiting.  Welcome to EverCamp.  2 hour spawn time iirc?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heh, I have not been to Guk in a month or more.  Guess I need to go back.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So here are my humble questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) I can get to the bedroom (who can&#39;t) but I don&#39;t know the exact way to<br/>
&gt; the assassin&#39;s room. How do I get to the room? I have several maps, but<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are all a bit sketchy in the assasin area, and I&#39;ve heard there are<br/>
ladders<br/>
&gt; involved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Does anyone know what level group usually camps the room, or what the<br/>
&gt; common loot practices are? (eg. if I go for the mask, will I be excluded<br/>
&gt; from the other loot since I can use the mask, or is it not even counted<br/>
&gt; since it&#39;s no drop) It&#39;s not that I care, I&#39;ll go either way, I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt; curious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Is there anything in particular I need to watch out for?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
