<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185838062">Ok, I went to the secret decoder page and none of those acronyms were listed<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
So clue us in ... what&#39;s a BIBS, a DBBA, LBA, and a LG?  Cuz I have no idea<br/>
what they are.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, half the time I have no idea what people are auctioning off cuz<br/>
they use acronyms.  How do I know I want it?  If it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve<br/>
seen before (ex, from a different continent) then I have no idea what the<br/>
acronym means to me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways ... thanks for the decoder page.  It will come in handy when I just<br/>
can&#39;t figure out what people are talking about. :-)<br/>

I think his point was on a place such as a mailing list, where people are<br/>
going for information about the game, seeing acronyms is a little confusing.<br/>
Just like words as &#39;twink&#39;, &#39;kite&#39;, &#39;twist&#39;, &#39;proc&#39;, new members to the list<br/>
and to EQ do not know what they mean.  The same with acronyms.  If you are<br/>
in the game and using acronyms its fine - you are usually in a hurry or<br/>
lazy.  But it isn&#39;t too much to ask to use the full words on an<br/>
informational list such as this.  I know it took me about a week to figure<br/>
out what a BIBS was and I have been playing since the end of March.<br/>
<br/>
Just for an example, I have LBA,  LG, and DBBA for sell.  Do you know what I<br/>
am talking about?  No - go to this page and look it up then :)</div>
