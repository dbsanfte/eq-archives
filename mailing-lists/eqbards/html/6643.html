<div id="ygrps-yiv-692006627">You sure you didn&#39;t go visable because of PL spikes?  Since the message was <br/>
implemented, I haven&#39;t gone visable except for PL spikes. Or when the right <br/>
most green number gets very high (in 6000s), I will jump in and out of <br/>
visablility.<br/>

&gt;Our invisibility is not 100% reliable (as I&#39;d theorized since<br/>
&gt;they put in the warning message).  I have yet to go visible<br/>
&gt;when the warning message shows, but this weekend I went<br/>
&gt;visible without a warning message.<br/>
