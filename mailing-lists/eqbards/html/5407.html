 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t think it was that bad.  What was bad was apparently<br/>
you lose about a full bubble of experience per death starting<br/>
at 31.  Immediately after I hit 31, I got killed by someone<br/>
else&#39;s train in Guk.  That wiped out the half bubble I&#39;d<br/>
gotten into 31 and put me at an indeterminate level into 30<br/>
(you know how your exp bar seems to stop for a bit at the end <br/>
before you actually level).<br/>
<br/>
Next day I got 31 again.  Before I got any experience into 31,<br/>
I died again to someone&#39;s train in Cazic (both trains were<br/>
unannounced, and as the only non-gater with area-effect<br/>
capability, I figure it&#39;s my duty to give the casters time to<br/>
gate out).  That time I got hit by level 31 experience loss<br/>
applied entirely into level 30 - over half a L30 bubble! I<br/>
looted my body and fortunately left my minotaur horn on it on<br/>
the off chance I could get a high level cleric to resurrect me<br/>
later.  Sure enough, one did (part of the group that started<br/>
the train that got me killed) which restored a bit more than<br/>
half what I&#39;d lost, and I hit 31 again later that night.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess the important lesson here is: don&#39;t die once you<br/>
hit level 31.  :-)  And leave something non-valuable on your<br/>
body in case you can get a cleric to resurrect you (L39+<br/>
spells restore some experience).<br/>
