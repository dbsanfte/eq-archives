<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-127425289"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;The thing is, I didn&#39;t die nor was I being attacked<br/>
&gt; &gt;or chased. I was a few bubbles down on health due to<br/>
&gt; &gt;a previous fight (that ended) and when I rezoned in<br/>
&gt; &gt;the wrong place I was at full health. So that was<br/>
&gt; &gt;nifty at least - but at the time of hitting the zone,<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was nowhere near death and again, not being attacked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That you *know* of - I know it sounds ridiculous but,<br/>
&gt; is it possible someone trained on you without you<br/>
&gt; knowing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. When I go through Highpass, I don&#39;t sit around. If<br/>
you remember (if you&#39;ve been) the area out front of the<br/>
keep, there&#39;s two halls that you can take to get into the<br/>
Keep zone. There&#39;s guards everywhere and you can see when<br/>
things are coming fairly well. There&#39;s nothing there that<br/>
could have killed me instantly with one hit without me<br/>
knowing it was coming. *shrug* Just a glitch I guess, as<br/>
long as I didn&#39;t lose anything I&#39;m not complaining.. just<br/>
thought it was rather odd.</div>
