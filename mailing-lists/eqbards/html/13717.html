<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-568582600">They key question to answer is this: Would pixie strike serve bards better if we<br/>
could use it reliably to mezmerize mobs or would it serve us better if it only<br/>
occasionaly mezmerized mobs (with a MR debuff added in)?  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Pixie Strike works too, and the MR debuff makes it somewhat useful in this<br/>
&gt; respect (not to mention it&#39;s a song I usually have loaded).  So I&#39;m not quite<br/>
&gt; sure I&#39;d go along with a petition to &quot;nerf&quot; it by removing the MR debuff.<br/>
