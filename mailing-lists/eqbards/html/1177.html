<b>Subject:</b> Re: Alcohol Tolerance <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-788977786">I also have a Barbarian Warrior on Tarew Marr, and have made it a point<br/>
to keep his alcohol tolerance maxxed. I usually drink short beer, and have<br/>
found even with his 60 int, I raised a point in alcohol tolerance every time<br/>
I drank one. My Barb has 130str and 110sta, and after getting completely<br/>
wasted, they both go up 20 points (my alcohol tolerance is now 120). I make<br/>
it a point to carry a backpack full of beer and down a few every time I have<br/>
a duel or am fighting a high level monster. It&#39;s like having temporary<br/>
Berserk (what happens when Warriors get low on HP). Berserk basically<br/>
increases your hit%, damage, and hit speed. Anything that does that works<br/>
for me!<br/>
<br/>
    In a Bards case, alcohol tolerance, IMHO should actually INCREASE the<br/>
effects of our songs. For instance, when I was playing in a band I played<br/>
100 times better when I was completely hammered. In the sense Verant is<br/>
using it, being drunk seems to enhance a characters specialty (ie. Warriors<br/>
fight better and main stats increase), so why shouldn&#39;t Bards become more<br/>
rambunctious and charismatic?<br/>
