<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900006060">Question to all servers once again? Has *any* imbrued armor dropped since the patch on this past<br/>
Wednesday? The armor was supposedly moved to the plane of hate since it is no longer dropped on<br/>
boogeymen, but none has dropped yet on any mobs on my server (Tarew Marr). I&#39;m starting to<br/>
believe Verant forgot to put our stuff in after they jacked it from boogeymen.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the Maestro, how far in is he? You said it took 8 hours. And how hard is he? Does he<br/>
cast any special type of spells?<br/>
<br/>
Also, when pulling mobs, have you had any weird bugs, where a single mob is pulled, and about 3<br/>
minutes into the fight, 5 - 10+ mobs come outta no where and wipe out everyone? Even with monks<br/>
feign pulling, and staying feigned while the rest of us fought so to keep aggro clear, we still<br/>
get trained everytime.<br/>

&gt; i think you are referring to scorn banshees (look like fetid fiends).  i got<br/>
&gt; a bard only martune rapier from a banshee (piercing dmg8 del23 5str 4agi).<br/>
&gt; i do not know if they now drop our imbrued armor as i heard boogeymen no<br/>
&gt; longer drop it but now have necro armor in pof.  the maestro of rancor i<br/>
&gt; think is our real best friend.  the first night groups on our server went, i<br/>
&gt; did not go and am still kicking myself several days later.  he dropped a<br/>
&gt; bard only sword (1h slashing dmg11 del25, i think called sword of the six<br/>
&gt; notes).  our best weapon to date, no bards there and it was destroyed =(<br/>
&gt; the next night i did go and after i got the rapier (on the very first kill<br/>
&gt; of the night) we got to the maestro about 8 or so hours later.  no sword,<br/>
&gt; but i did get Kelin&#39;s Seven Stringed Lute (dex9 cha15 agi9).  i kinda got<br/>
&gt; excited and destroyed my normal mandolin before testing and have not gotten<br/>
&gt; around to buying another since (sorry mr. kim hehe).  i did try healing and<br/>
&gt; i got 25 or 26 per pulse.  i can&#39;t remember what a level 50 with normal<br/>
&gt; mandolin heals per tick but i thought it was 22.  i&#39;ll get around to testing<br/>
&gt; the effects as soon as i remember to buy a new mandolin =)<br/>
