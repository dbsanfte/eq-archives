Interesting rumours I heard lately: Of the (3!?) weeks that Kunark was<br/>
in beta, 2 were dedicated to geometry testing (can you find places to<br/>
fall through the world). That left one week for the unpaid testers to<br/>
check dungeons, etc. Also, appearantly Verant&#39;s paid testing department<br/>
consists of 4 employees. That would explain why Gordon has to go test<br/>
things like spell drops.<br/>
