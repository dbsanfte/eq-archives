<div id="ygrps-yiv-802935867">HARMONIC:&gt; &gt; I am not for/against twinking.  I do it,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve done it, it&#39;s happened to me, it&#39;s happened for me.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Harmonic.<br/>

him/her<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ME: Hear hear! I am of the same opinion as harmonic... not blatantly for it,<br/>
not blatantly against it - i&#39;ve done it, it&#39;s happened to me, and it&#39;s<br/>
happened for me as well... I too, help out any younger bard I see in the<br/>
same manner as Operaman...<br/>
<br/>
OPERAMAN: &gt; As for Lambent, I&#39;ll get it when the time is right, but have no<br/>
plans to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; even go for a bracer for a few levels. Bronze been berry berry good to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ME: Me too - no plans to go for anything for probably 8-10 levels.... but I<br/>
did switch bronze shoulders for bloodstained mantle.... lighter and nicer<br/>
for me. Small bronze greaves, banded boots, still have leather (or is it<br/>
rawhide?) on the upper arm... but I have had, since L5, Dwarven Ringmail<br/>
Tunic, which an unknown someone gave me. It has served me well and will<br/>
continue to serve for a while.... It also helps having and enchanting<br/>
husband who is also a jeweler - who makes me all sorts of wonderful,<br/>
stat-buffing items - functional, practical, AND beautiful (what woman<br/>
doesn&#39;t want jewelry - even if it is for her EQ character...) *grin*<br/>
