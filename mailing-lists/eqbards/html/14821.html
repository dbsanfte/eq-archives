<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913702635">Sounds like you are doing very well!  You have a great understanding of your<br/>
songs and how they relate to various other classes.  So, when you have a<br/>
good group and it seems like all the bases are covered, think about the<br/>
additional ways you can enhance your party.  Many of our songs have more<br/>
than one effect and while some other party member may have a better spell,<br/>
the secondary effects can add.<br/>
<br/>
Chant of battle: +dex +str +ac<br/>
<br/>
Ok, you say we all &#39;know&#39; dex does not matter that much.  But we also &#39;know&#39;<br/>
that AC is king and str will boost max damage potential.  So, when the<br/>
enchanter buffs the tanks with attack speed - by all means Chant to buff AC<br/>
and Str.  Look for other songs that either buff party AC or debuff mob AC.<br/>
<br/>
Largos:  Non-Party: AE -AC, -30% ATK Speed -does not break enchanter mez -<br/>
looks like it is custom made for work with enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
Screetch: AE fear - if you are chaining and its sticking and you are<br/>
outdoors or able to affect a single mob, try fear after chain.  Not only is<br/>
this the tactic that enables bards to solo, it works well in group fights<br/>
too.  In crowded fights, it probably is not an option but maybe you are in<br/>
South Karana and you can make that snared avo turn away and take a beating<br/>
instead of dishing one out.<br/>
<br/>
Bellow: every bit of additional damage helps. Does your<br/>
sword/dagger/staff/whip consistently hit for 14?<br/>
<br/>
Chords: same cautions as Screetch but if you have the chance to use it -<br/>
give it a try.  Its a &#39;vintage&#39; song and single effect so it should &#39;stick&#39;<br/>
well even to mobs with higher cons - and it&#39;s DoT.<br/>
<br/>
Jig of Vigor:  this song regens castsers morale &lt;g&gt; sorry could not resist.<br/>
Actually, you are now probably getting to fight mobs where the fites are<br/>
lasting longer and longer.  As you and your party members stamina bar drops,<br/>
your attack speed decreases.  If you have an opportunity to play a song<br/>
because other members have covered other bases, this is a good one.  Keep<br/>
everyone&#39;s sta bars maxed and you will keep their attack speeds maxxed.<br/>
<br/>
Lament: you can use this to control the pulls and thus the fites you get<br/>
into.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts from looking at the song chart.  There are no &quot;set&quot; ways<br/>
of doing things.  Try different things and see what works best for you and<br/>
your groups.  Have some fun now and good luck!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m now 27, and I&#39;m currently reevaluating my group strategy.  I thought<br/>
I&#39;d post my thoughts for group discussion.  Please disagree with me here<br/>
though; I like being shown that I&#39;m wrong as long as it makes me better. </span></blockquote></div>
