<b>Subject:</b> Bardic Skill Caps <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-264729139">Greetings all.  I was wondering if anyone knew about our skill caps?<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, Hand to Hand - for a while now, mine has stopped at 3 * level<br/>
+ 1.  Does anyone know if this is the limit for us in this skill?  I&#39;ve<br/>
asked several of our bardic kin in-game, and no one seems to know the<br/>
answer for sure (I got a lot of people curious though  :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one more thing - does anyone know if there are any specific<br/>
differences in using the various instruments avaliable in the game?  (for<br/>
example - the mandolin and the lute - is it just the weight that&#39;s<br/>
different?  or a brass horn and a mino horn?)<br/>
<br/>
