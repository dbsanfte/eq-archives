&gt;My interpretation of these drawings has always been that the ligher colored<br/>
&gt;things were goblins from Sol A, while the red things were kobolds from Sol<br/>
&gt;B.  There are some inconsistencies with that, however, such as #14 that you<br/>
&gt;mention.  There are drawings in Sol A that you might want to factor into<br/>
&gt;this discussion as well.  At least one of those in Sol A (Gabbie&#39;s room I<br/>
&gt;think) has a map that seems to depict a coordinated attack on Lord Nagefen<br/>
&gt;by the Goblins.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you look at #8, I always thought that that picture depicted a failed<br/>
&gt;Nagefen attempt by the Golins.  You have Goblins charging Naggy with weapons<br/>
&gt;in hand, and a slew of dead Goblins around him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I look at #13 from the King Room, I always thought that this depicted<br/>
&gt;the defeat of a former King at the hands of the Goblins, perhaps prior to<br/>
&gt;the Nagefen raid from #8?  The gold is a crown.<br/>
