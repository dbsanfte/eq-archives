<div id="ygrps-yiv-588544446">I was soloing kobolds here for a while.  Once they get down to half health,<br/>
just fire up fear/chains and finish them off while they&#39;re stopped dead in<br/>
their tracks.  You really only have to kill half a kobold :)<br/>
I once even got extremly lucky here and managed to kill 2 at once with<br/>
charm.  Not bad for such a confined space.  Mind you I tried the same thing<br/>
later and got thoroughly whomped.<br/>

Just for yucks, I decided to try soloing a greater kobold in<br/>
Sol B (usually L35 or so) at level 40.  I played Hymn,<br/>
Warsong, Psalm of Cooling, and Chain, trying as hard as I<br/>
could to keep all 4 effects going (probably succeeded about<br/>
half the time).  When I dropped below half health, I switched<br/>
to Pixie Strike/Hymn with a lute while I healed up.  I did<br/>
this right in front of a little-used zone line for reasons of<br/>
safety.</div>
