&gt;For an even more frightening study, do a survey of the types of remarks real<br/>
&gt;women get in tells while playing this game.  While I know there are any<br/>
&gt;number of &quot;normal&quot; men playing this game (at least I hope).. there is a<br/>
&gt;disturbing number of men with absolutely NO idea of how to interact socially<br/>
&gt;with women.  Frightening.  And yes, I am prepared for the flames from the<br/>
&gt;overgeneralized, stereotyping remark I have just made.  Someday though, I<br/>
&gt;will have to compile my screenshots for some amusement!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking as a guy who plays a couple of female characters, I can certainly <br/>
sympathize ;)  I&#39;ve gotten some bizarre tells m&#39;self.  A few members of my <br/>
cleric&#39;s guild don&#39;t know that I&#39;m a guy, and it&#39;s humourous to read some <br/>
of the posts on our guild board...  Ahh well - I just turn down all the <br/>
marriage proposals...<br/>
