The explanation is very old unfortunately, pre-Kunark.  Kunark changed a lot<br/>
of things regarding loot for us, but the general idea is the same.  Mobs<br/>
that require the participation of the guild is assigned a point value.  It<br/>
was originally only dragons, so Dragon Kill Points.  Items that the mob<br/>
drops are assigned point values depending on how good the item is,<br/>
determined by the guildleaders.  You accumulate points by being present at<br/>
raids, and you use those points to get items.  People who had the number of<br/>
points necessary to go in on an item would then lotto.  Later tiers were<br/>
added so that someone with far more points on an item, even if others could<br/>
qualify, would not need to roll against anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Some items that can be used by multiple classes are limited in certain<br/>
instances (not haste items, an example is piercing items to rogues before<br/>
anyone else).  Tradeable items you replace can be kept or turned back in to<br/>
get your points back.  Anything gained in a single group has no point<br/>
values, and can be dispensed with at will but almost all of the time items<br/>
remain in the guild and are given to members in need freely (for example,<br/>
the day I zoned into Sebilis and was handed a BoH about 5 seconds later).<br/>
Items obtained using points can never be sold or traded outside the guild.<br/>
The only exceptions were made recently with items that were just too<br/>
out-dated or obsolete as to be cared about.  Other obsolete items that still<br/>
may have little value were drastically reduced in point value, for example<br/>
Kunark BPs were originally 20 points and Kunark legs were 15 points, but<br/>
later became 8 and 5 points respectively with the influx of Velious quest<br/>
armor.  We had a list of each item that any god or dragon dropped for us and<br/>
how many points they cost, but with Kunark and Velious came an enormous<br/>
amount of new items and mobs which led to points gained and point value of<br/>
items being assigned on the fly often by the guildleaders, with adjustments<br/>
made as more thought was put into it.<br/>
<br/>
Later on a system was added to create incentive on participating in raids<br/>
that were necessary to the advancement of the guild but yielded little<br/>
reward or points even though the particpation needed was high, specifically<br/>
Sleeper&#39;s Tomb keys.  The incentive points system gave points for those that<br/>
participated and deducted points from those that did not.  Bottom line was<br/>
to create a system that rewards participation and gives the most to those<br/>
who put in the most time.  Personally I always loved the system, but towards<br/>
the end I just did not put in nor did I have the time to stay in the race<br/>
anymore.  Most items are not even lottoed, one person who wants an item<br/>
usually has the points necessary to acquire it without rolling against<br/>
anyone.  I would say there are usually 1-3 people on average per item.  That<br/>
is what I liked, you knew who put in the time and you knew if you wanted<br/>
something and saved you had an excellent chance of eventually getting it.<br/>
The converse were some of the Japanese guilds who used far more people per<br/>
raid and one thing I will always remember was their lotto where 35 people<br/>
rolled for Gauntlets of Fiery Might.  That is the type of lotto you never<br/>
see in a points system.<br/>
