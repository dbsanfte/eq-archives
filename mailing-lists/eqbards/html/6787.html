to sell it would have been laughed out of Qeynos.  Last time I saw someone<br/>
wearing studded was like 4 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
You should ditch the studded.  You should at least be in mesh, it has the<br/>
same AC and is much lighter.  And get Banded Armor.  Banded is only a point<br/>
or two less than bronze and it weights less.  I banked the few bronze pieces<br/>
I had as they were too heavy.  Banded with a few mesh pieces is much easier<br/>
to carry.<br/>
<br/>
Once you upgrade from Studded, come back and tell us how your AC compares.</div>
