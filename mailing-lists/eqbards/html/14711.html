<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570318097">Happens to me too, very frequently.  In fact, I often screw up when i<br/>
only miss the note once, as if I see a missed note message, I keep<br/>
hitting the song key, assuming its going to fail multiple times.  This<br/>
and other things I&#39;ve seen tell me their random number generator is not<br/>
very good.<br/>
<br/>
This was idscussed on the cleric list, but its similar.  I&#39;m also<br/>
convinced their fizz% is flawed.  According to Vernat, once you get a<br/>
few lvls above a spell it should be 5%.  However, whenever I first gain<br/>
a lvl, my fizz% goes up on all my spells until I max out my skill for<br/>
that lvl.  For example, I am lvl 10 casting my lvl 4 heal. (alteration<br/>
obviously maxed).  Very few fizz, maybe once every 5 fights.  I hit lvl<br/>
11, fizz rates goes up dramitcally to around 1 fizz per fight (with the<br/>
same lvl 4 spell).  As soon as I gain some points in alteration, it goes<br/>
back down to the low rate again.  Since this hard to test (get only a<br/>
small sample every time you level), I asked our wizard to watch for it<br/>
too.  She saw similar results to mine.  High fizz% till evocation was<br/>
maxed for the lvl, even when casting lower lvl spells.<br/>

&gt;   I missed four notes in a row a night ago on Clarit.  Still doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   top my record of five missed on Selo&#39;s.  Whenever I miss notes,<br/>
&gt;   it&#39;s almost always consecutive.  Poor, poor random function.<br/>
