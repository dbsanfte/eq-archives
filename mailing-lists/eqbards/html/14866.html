&gt; So what you&#39;re saying, is that you&#39;d rather risk dying than parse?<br/>
&gt; hehe<br/>

  Major yawnage.  I&#39;ll leave that to John(tm) to fool around with.<br/>
  If you were a real battle bard, you&#39;d be out in the face of those<br/>
  enemies with an upbeat attitude and downbeat drums ;)<br/>
<br/>
  The only time I&#39;ve been killed by those ice giants is when I ate<br/>
  one for the person who was with me.  A not-so-smart shaman let<br/>
  their pet get killed and I became primary tank.  The shaman dumped<br/>
  tons of mana into offense and didn&#39;t bother to think about healing <br/>
  me.  The shaman&#39;s sow wore off during the battle, and while I could<br/>
  have easily jetted I ate it while the person casted and bolted.<br/>
<br/>
  If there&#39;s no risk, there&#39;s no adrenaline, and if there&#39;s no adrenaline<br/>
  there&#39;s no bloodrush and increased heartrate.  Where is the excitement<br/>
  in fighting a snake, I then ask? =)  You all like to have fun and<br/>
  emphasize the roleplay aspect of the game, let&#39;s go knock on death&#39;s<br/>
  door and have a little hoedown with some big ice cubes.<br/>
<br/>
  hee yah,<br/>
