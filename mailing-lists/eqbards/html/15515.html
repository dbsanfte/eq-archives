<div id="ygrps-yiv-629485087"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is the Login Server down?  My son is home sick and<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t seem to log in.  I&#39;m at work so I don&#39;t know if<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s doing anything wrong.  I installed Evermon here<br/>
&gt; and tried to check, but can&#39;t connect.  However, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know whether this is because the server is down<br/>
&gt; or Evermon won&#39;t work thru the Company&#39;s firewall.<br/>

bypass any firewall difficulties you might be having with Evermon.</div>
