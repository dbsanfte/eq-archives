<div id="ygrps-yiv-717631501">the damage part is true, but it only applies to damage to hp as far as I<br/>
know, I believe all other debuffs are the same vs. player as vs. npc.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A lot of you have noticed that you get resist after resist with Pixie <br/>
&gt;Strike, until it &quot;takes&quot; - then it suddenly works over and over (ditto with<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Charm?)  Weeeeeelll - apparently, an &quot;undocumented feature&quot; of those two <br/>
&gt;songs is a slight magic resistance debuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I noticed no change to my MR when I used Pixie Strike on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>myself.  Will have to test it again.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed this a few days ago while messing around in HK basement.  At level<br/>
<br/>
32, wind skill 165, Pixie Strike lowered my magic resist by 6.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
lot, but it could certainly account for the ease with which the song is <br/>
maintained once a target is stricken.  Fufil&#39;s lowers MR by 10 at the same <br/>
level... so (just a thought) in some cases where you&#39;re in a caster-heavy <br/>
group it might make sense to weave Pixie Strike and Fufil&#39;s to lower the <br/>
target&#39;s magic resist by quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
On this note, I have heard rumors that the damage done to players (and to <br/>
one&#39;s self) is only a fraction of the damage done to monsters (2/3 being the<br/>
<br/>
number I have heard most often).  Can anyone confirm or deny this rumor?  If<br/>
<br/>
it is true, then Fufil&#39;s and Pixie Strike combined will lower MR by 25 (10 <br/>
from PS, 15 from Fufil&#39;s)... which is rather a lot, I think.<br/>
