<b>Subject:</b> RE: More encumbrance = more damage <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755524892">I have previously posted my opinion on this, but will do so again as the<br/>
topic seems to have generated interest.  I have ound that encumbrance, not<br/>
just being encumbered, has a definite effect on dodging and damage taken.<br/>
When I am at my low weight, about 30 lbs below encumbered, I dodge about 3-4<br/>
times a fight and can solo white creatures.  I take only slightly more<br/>
damage than my banded wearing ranger friend even though I am clad in<br/>
leather/mesh with a Crush&#39;s tunic.  Although I take more when hit, I dodge<br/>
more often.  as soon as I approach my weight limit I begin to dodge<br/>
significantly less, and take more damage on a hit.  Monks experience this to<br/>
an even greater degree, but I think it affects all classes somewhat.  Hence<br/>
I have found that despite wearing lighter armor than most bards of my level,<br/>
I do not take significantly more damage because my encumbrance is so much<br/>
less.  I have also found I run slightly faster at light load than at full.<br/>
Haven&#39;t timed it enough times to be sure it wasn&#39;t the vagrancies of<br/>
connection, but it was about a 5% difference in speed crossing Kithicor.<br/>
