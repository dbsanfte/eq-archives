<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-487347244">More evidence for reduced bard hate.  I joined Rokenn&#39;s guild<br/>
for a Vox attempt last night (4 failures).  The last one,<br/>
somehow I lived.  I played resists the entire battle.  When<br/>
all three melee people and the cleric in my group died, I was<br/>
at a bubble and a half so I meleed Vox a bit, healed the<br/>
(still alive) enchanter, meleed the priest of Nagafen and some<br/>
ice giants a bit.  I was expecting to get summoned at any<br/>
moment, but I ran around doing all this for about 3 minutes<br/>
with nothing happening.  I didn&#39;t know what to do because it&#39;d<br/>
never occurred to me that I might live.  Eventually I zoned.  <br/>
I think I was the only melee person to survive.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, the first try, I played my resist song for a couple<br/>
rounds, Vox summoned me, and clawed me to death right off the<br/>
bat.  :)<br/>
