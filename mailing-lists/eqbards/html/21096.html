<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065639977">Simple.  Several times I have been actively and publicly opposed to some of<br/>
their moves for reasons which were poopoo-ed at the time.  A week later they<br/>
admitted they didn&#39;t look at all the facts and reversed their stance.  They<br/>
have 100% info and still can&#39;t make up their minds and often change it when<br/>
they do.  100 is .05% of 200,000 btw.<br/>

you have <br/>
