<div id="ygrps-yiv-226873784">Hi, Harmonic!  Saw your posting on my guild board (OBS).  I&#39;ll let you<br/>
know if we&#39;re doing anything cool, it would be fun to have you along.<br/>
(Not that they let ME know very much in advance...)  My old guild (The<br/>
Talquinn), Crimson Sigil, some high-level members of Legends, and the<br/>
Order of the Black Staff (OBS) guild merged while you were away.  It&#39;s<br/>
nice to have enough high-level people on to actually do stuff.  It&#39;s<br/>
possible that we have more high-level Bards now than any other guild in<br/>
Innoruuk.  At level 45, I&#39;m the fifth ranked.  This is good and bad, as<br/>
you might imagine, but kinda cool.<br/>
