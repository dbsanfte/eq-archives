&gt; that!  Since when is there a faction of Wolves?  Unnerved I walked around<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I think ever since they fixed it so wolves and bears no longer<br/>
&gt;attack druids and rangers on sight.  I would dearly love to<br/>
&gt;know how to raise my faction with wolf as I&#39;ve always liked<br/>
&gt;wolves.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, doubt that.  I kill wolves all of the time, and I do mean all of the<br/>
time, trying to find those quality pelts you understand so I can clothe<br/>
myself in studded and some day reinforced armor.  I even died yesterday when<br/>
4 silvermist wolves decided I was being mean to their fellow in N Karana and<br/>
joined in.  I have never seen a hit to &#39;Wolf&#39; faction before and they all<br/>
still glare threateningly at me like they did the day I was born.<br/>

Kitasi the wolf-hated?</div>
