<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929407849">I&#39;m a little confused by a couple things.  Were all people in both <br/>
groups in your guild?  And 2 of the people (including the tag-along <br/>
Enchanter) were being played by your guild leader?  &quot;Walk on the <br/>
guild&quot; means leaving the guild?<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right in that the enchanter should not have been in on <br/>
the lotto.  My guild has some guidelines to help these sort of <br/>
problems:<br/>
<br/>
Each guildmember must pick which character is their primary. It can <br/>
be any character, from level 1 to the level 60.  You can only change <br/>
your primary once every 6 months.  On any guild type event (or group, <br/>
if it&#39;s a guild group) you can only lotto for your primary, UNLESS <br/>
there are no other primaries that need.  If no primaries need, then <br/>
you may lotto (as your primary) for the item with everyone else <br/>
present and can do whatever you want with it, including giving it to <br/>
your twink.  If it&#39;s NO DROP, we obviously won&#39;t let it rot, even if <br/>
it goes to a twink. (We make some exceptions for the person who plays <br/>
2 accounts, but only because he actually PLAYS them like 2 accounts, <br/>
not one 3/4 and one 1/8.  And, if there was another Monk present, I&#39;m <br/>
sure he&#39;d automatically default on any items that Monk didn&#39;t have.)  <br/>
<br/>
I think a rule like this would help out dramatically in the situation <br/>
you described.  It kinda perturbs me that the guild leader himself <br/>
might have been the one being &quot;greedy&quot; in this case.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you got it to work out correctly, tho I would have stopped <br/>
before threatening to leave the guild, heh. (I would have left the <br/>
guild, most likely, but I wouldn&#39;t have threatened first. :)<br/>
<br/>
If it was a non-guild type raid, and more specifically, if the 2nd <br/>
enchanter was not in the guild, it makes it tougher if the loot rules <br/>
are not discussed before anything drops.  Non-guildies obviously <br/>
don&#39;t gain anything by letting the item go to someone else, so <br/>
they&#39;re much fiercer combatants. :)<br/>
