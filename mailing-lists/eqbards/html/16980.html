<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945377211">Well,<br/>
<br/>
I had the best night last night. Thought I&#39;d share it with you all.<br/>
<br/>
I log in at my regular time. I&#39;d made plans the night before to return to<br/>
Mistmore with my regular group, but I was at the temple of Solussek Ro,<br/>
having just made my lambent gauntlets. My group wasn&#39;t on yet so I figured<br/>
I&#39;d head down to guk and try to pick up another set of shin gauntlets. (I<br/>
love the silver plate look) Without even bothering to get rebound (I was<br/>
bound in Greater Faydark) I head down to guk. I quickly navigate the twists<br/>
and turns till I find myself at the live side entrance and I zone in. Not<br/>
being a killer of live froggies, I&#39;m completely at the whim of whoever is<br/>
camping the shins.<br/>
<br/>
After I zone in I see a paladin sitting down for a rest right at the zone.<br/>
Then I see an OOC... &quot;Healer or Tank needed in Supplier room&quot;. My eyes light<br/>
up, since I do not have my mask yet, but I figure I&#39;m here to get my<br/>
gauntlets. So I run down to the little room before the bridge. Lo and Behold<br/>
there is a shin knight sprawled out on the floor with no one around him. I<br/>
bend down and loot him and Cha Ching, there are the shin gauntlets I&#39;ve been<br/>
looking for. Woo Hoo, says me, mission accomplished. Seeing as how that went<br/>
so quick, I send a tell to the guy in the supplier room, but he informs me<br/>
that the spot has been filled.<br/>
<br/>
Well, here it is, a whole 10 minutes later and my group hasn&#39;t showed up<br/>
yet. :┬¼ P<br/>
So I head up to Upper Guk to camp the Giant Heart Spider while I wait. Once<br/>
our druid gets on I&#39;ll have to run over to Feerrot, so I wanted to be semi<br/>
close. I&#39;m hanging out at the heart spiders with a level 16 enchanter.<br/>
Playing clarity for him during his downtime, fishing while waiting for the<br/>
next place holder to spawn. 20 minutes go by, 40, 60; finally the enchanter<br/>
decides to log, and my party still hasn&#39;t shown up. Well, no use in my<br/>
sitting here the whole time waiting for them. I decide to head down to the<br/>
Bedroom in lower guk. Seeing as that room is so volatile in regards to it&#39;s<br/>
members anyway, I figure it won&#39;t be a problem for me to leave when my group<br/>
shows up.<br/>
<br/>
I zone into lower guk, and broadcast my oh so familiar tune... &quot;Is the<br/>
assassin camped?&quot; Seconds later I recieve a tell informing me that it is<br/>
camped but they could use more people, would I like to join?&quot; Hell yeah. I<br/>
make my way to the BR and try to get an invis to undead, but no luck. I try<br/>
to sneak past the GIBs, but there are 2 wizzies waiting at the bridge to<br/>
make my day very sad, so I head back to the BR and convince them to pull the<br/>
GIBs and wizzies for me. 10 minutes later I&#39;m in the supply room with my new<br/>
party.<br/>
<br/>
I was clearly the lowest level person in the room. It was a level 43 cleric,<br/>
level 41 paladin, 39 druid, warrior (red to me, but I don&#39;t know what<br/>
level), a 39 enchanter and me a level 34 bard. I&#39;m a little nervous that I<br/>
won&#39;t live up to expectations, but I know I&#39;m a good bard so I put it behind<br/>
me. Also having the enchanter there made me feel better.<br/>
<br/>
Things are going very well and we are plowing through the mobs. 4 tal and<br/>
wan wizzies on one pull, 5 GIBs on another. I&#39;m having a great time and<br/>
making some experience too. Next thing I know, I&#39;m face to face with the<br/>
cavelier! Woo hoo, we take him down in less than 5 seconds, roll and the<br/>
cleric wins the epolets. My first slaying of a lower guk named. :┬¼ )<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m feeling settled in and the Supplier spawns along with a wan wizzie<br/>
and a tal knight. Time for another roll. Rolling on 1 to 1000, I roll a 996<br/>
and win the light burlap sack. At this point, I&#39;m having a great night and I<br/>
vow not to leave this room till I pry the mask off the face of the assassin<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
As the night goes on we kill many of the nasty froggies including a zol<br/>
wizzie and a dar knight that seemed to have an endless amount of hit points.<br/>
Our puller was in fine form as he managed to later pull the Savant (who<br/>
dropped the mace) among the seemingly endless amount of froggies. I was<br/>
indeed able to get my mask last night, making me the happiest camper around,<br/>
and also freeing me up to help all my friends camp all the stuff they&#39;ve<br/>
been drooling over.<br/>
<br/>
All told our pickup group left with 3 sacks, 1 Serrated Bone Dirk, 2 Masks,<br/>
1 Enameled Black Mace and 1 pair of Adamantine Epolets. We almost had the<br/>
Sentinal also, but we didn&#39;t get to him in time. Defintely one of the best<br/>
nights I&#39;ve had in a while.<br/>
