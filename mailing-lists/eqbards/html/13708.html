<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752310458">I&#39;ve never been fortunate enough to have mobs leave me when I tried.  I<br/>
eventually gave up on that tactic and now just serve as the cleric&#39;s sole<br/>
point of focus for healing.  Makes his job easier I guess.<br/>

&gt; This is frightening.  Of course Abashi&#39;s suggestion that bards need to<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; when to stop singing is even more frightening.  Are they aware how little<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; can do if we stop singing.<br/>
<br/>
A bit extreme..  I stop singing all the time to get mobs off me, stop<br/>
attacking too.  That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t start again in 5 seconds, but if<br/>
removing myself from the situation for that time puts the damage back<br/>
where it belongs, it&#39;s worth it.  A wizard needs to know when to stop<br/>
nuking, a ranger needs to know when to stop taunting, a bard needs to<br/>
know when to stop singing.<br/>
