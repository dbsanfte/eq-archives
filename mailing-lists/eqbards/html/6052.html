&gt; look up and see my health bar drop from 5 bubbles to two bubbles in a<br/>

just have leveled, it acts like a taunt...  :-)<br/>

Do you know about the emergency exit from the hand room?  Out<br/>
the door to the roof, then jump down to the main path leading<br/>
to the zone.  Your safefall should prevent you from taking any<br/>
damage from the jump.<br/>
