<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Incandescent Bracer <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-706394445">I looted this item a few days ago from Glucose, a named frosticube in <br/>
Icewell Keep (the pit under Thurgadin). AC8 Cha +15 Cold +5 NO DROP Bard <br/>
only. Despite the name, it only fits in your waist slot. Not sure if they <br/>
meant it to be this way, but personally I think it would make a pretty weak <br/>
wrist item for the level of the mob it drops off of. We killed him once, he <br/>
dropped the bracer. We killed him again the next day, and he dropped <br/>
nothing. *shrug*<br/>
