<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854552352"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Um, if there is nothing in the game that you don&#39;t deserve,<br/>
&gt; then there is no advancement, and you have the ultimate<br/>
&gt; monty-haul game.  It may sound harsh to say you don&#39;t deserve<br/>
&gt; something at a certain level, but that&#39;s the fundamental basis<br/>
&gt; of advancement in a level-based roleplaying game.  If you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like it, then you probably shouldn&#39;t be playing an<br/>
&gt; advancement-based RPG.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  This paragraph very clearly summarized my point exactly.<br/>
  I don&#39;t understand why people, who obviously understand<br/>
  that I&#39;m giving MY opinion, are all bent out of shape<br/>
  over this topic.  If you say you respect other opinions<br/>
  why do I sense people getting irritated/questioning posts<br/>
  made by other people with, allbeit, differing opinions.<br/>
<br/>
  X person posted that it wasnt fair that they couldn&#39;t get<br/>
  Lambent armor because they don&#39;t have friends who want to<br/>
  help them out and that they were not high enough to complete<br/>
  the quests on their own.  This is where the &#39;you don&#39;t deserve<br/>
  it&#39; line comes in, which people instantly took offense to.<br/>
<br/>
  The way I see it, everyone here is trying to justify how/why<br/>
  they earned their Lambent, and I frankly don&#39;t care.  That<br/>
  wasn&#39;t the issue.  I am not for/against twinking.  I do it,<br/>
  I&#39;ve done it, it&#39;s happened to me, it&#39;s happened for me.<br/>
  The issue is these people who whine about NOT being able to<br/>
  get the armor regardless of level due to the fact they don&#39;t<br/>
  have the know-how, the friends, the level, the resources, or<br/>
  the time.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s really easy to read into the words on this page, and get<br/>
  the wrong idea.  In a matter-of-fact tone, non-condescending,<br/>
  Lambent armor was geared for mid level acquisition.  When<br/>
  I see L20s complaining about the hardships of Lambent armor,<br/>
  I just chuckle.  Because IMO you don&#39;t need that armor yet.<br/>
  But if you do earn a piece; congrats!  It&#39;s not easy stuff.<br/>
<br/>
  If you&#39;ve got some negative reply to make to this post, I don&#39;t<br/>
  want to see it on the list.  I&#39;m kinda over the berating of one<br/>
  particular person over the way they see things.  Feel free to<br/>
  flame me in PRIVATE.<br/>
