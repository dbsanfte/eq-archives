<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466559349">This is good to know, as those /doability commands allow us some<br/>
huge flexibility without all the keyboard calisthenics we used to have to<br/>
do.<br/>

&gt; Well I found what is probably an &quot;unintended bard nerf&quot; that seems to be<br/>
&gt; specifically related to bards.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [snip]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a bug.  I&#39;ve just lifted this from everlore.com:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;When you added the patch to make it so that the / commands could not be<br/>
&gt; used dureing inappropiate times you made it so that the /command could not<br/>
&gt; be activated while a bard song is playing even if the ability such as<br/>
&gt; forage<br/>
&gt; should be ablde to be activated at that time also the new /pause command<br/>
&gt; will not work either. while i think this command would be great for the<br/>
&gt; bards never ending quest to fight TCS. The fact that it does not work for<br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; is more then a little sadding for me please look into this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rowyl&#39;s response:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a mistake on my part that the new (and some old) / commands don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work<br/>
&gt; for Bards when singing. I plan to fix it.<br/>
