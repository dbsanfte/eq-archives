<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182777423">Here&#39;s another post about my experiences grouping with people who have no<br/>
idea of the benefits a bard can add to a party.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Roop (a fellow bard) and I were grouping with a party in Highhold<br/>
Pass fighting orcs.  After one particular tough battle, one of the party<br/>
members stated that the fight would have been a lot easier if he hadn&#39;t been<br/>
rooted the entire battle.  I then told him that had he informed the group<br/>
that he was rooted, Roop or I could have easily broken him free with Selo&#39;s.<br/>
He and the other non-bards in the group were unaware that we possessed this<br/>
capability (these were all 17+ level characters BTW).  Two others then went<br/>
on to say they wished they had known about Selo&#39;s breaking the root spell<br/>
when they were fighting in Unrest earlier.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why so many non-bards are unaware of what all we can do.  I<br/>
guess part of it may be a result of the lack of high-level bards on the<br/>
server I&#39;m on (E&#39;ci).  I am only aware of a few median to high level bards<br/>
on E&#39;ci.  Octave and Jojoii are 30+.  Roop, Faras, and Lindros are high<br/>
teens/low 20s level.  Kitasi and I are in the mid-teens.  If there are more<br/>
out there I haven&#39;t met them.  I guess it will be a neverending quest on our<br/>
part to educate the masses on our capabilities.  Looking forward to the<br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, my experience last night with Roop showed me that a party<br/>
with two bards properly played can really rock.  Our group consisted of a<br/>
ranger, cleric, magician, wizard, Roop and myself.  Roop and I had our songs<br/>
coordinated so we wouldn&#39;t cancel each other out.  Whenever a orc priest or<br/>
fanatic appeared, we would each sing a different rhythm song so we got an<br/>
extra 50 to magic resistance.  He would sing anthem while I healed.  Chords<br/>
and Lullaby were sang when appropriate.  Each of us threw a few bellows in<br/>
to mix it up.  Overall we were quite effective and I had a great time. <br/>

PS to Roop:  Thanks again for the Fierce Brew and Trumpy&#39;s Tonic shot.<br/>
Gotta get my hands on some kiola nuts so I can make that shot myself:-)</div>
