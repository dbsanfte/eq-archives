My CHA is around 105 with standard equipment on, another 15 if I use my<br/>
Crude Stein.<br/>
<br/>
It has become apparent in reviewing the last couple of posts in this thread<br/>
that I&#39;m either not coordinated enough to pull this off or I just need more<br/>
practice.  I&#39;ll try and hit the Orc Cents again and give it another go, but<br/>
hell, if I can&#39;t even finish off two Orcs without losing half a bubble of<br/>
health, how am I going to fare with Froon and Choon?<br/>
<br/>
Charming Griffs or HGs is simply laughable to me.  I would die so damn<br/>
fast...</div>
