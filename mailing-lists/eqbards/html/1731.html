&gt;Well, this debate has certainly heated things up.  Its clear there is an<br/>
&gt;easily definable line between the roleplayers and the powergamers here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t like the idea of bards wearing plate personally, it doesn&#39;t fit any<br/>
&gt;image of the class from a roleplaying perspective as far as I can see<br/>

&lt;OOC&gt; Ok, I have to say it again. First, I am a role-player, though probably <br/>
not what you would consider hard-core. As far as the plate issue, though, I <br/>
have to say I am all for it. If you treat EQ as a r/l situation where <br/>
everything you encounter decides that you are public enemy number 1, any <br/>
normal rational being is going to say &#39;heck with any pre-concieved notion of <br/>
how my profession is supposed to act, give me the hardest toughest armor you <br/>
can find and image be damned&#39;.  Tell me how this is not appropriate <br/>
role-play?<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to role-play, stop and take off some of the heavier gear <br/>
that can interfere with your strumming when you break out that lute. If you <br/>
hotkey your armor slots, it shouldn&#39;t take that long. As far as Selo&#39;s goes, <br/>
you should be able to beat a drum even in full plate.<br/>
