&gt; Yes, most bard skills are capped at 40.<br/>
&gt; ... 2handers are capped at 1, tracking at<br/>
&gt; 1, forage at 40, pick lock at 40, hide at 40, sneak at 40, disarm traps<br/>
&gt; at 40. Safe fall, instill doubt, and bind wound are probably too.<br/>
&gt; The only thing we aren&#39;t capped in are the basic weapon<br/>
&gt; skills(cept mentioned), instrument and singing skills, dual wield,<br/>
&gt; offense and defense, (though it seems to be 5 pts behind your level,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been at 90 forever at level 18), and language skills.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For a moment, you had me really worried: the skills that are capped<br/>
are precisely the ones that I would not call bard skills. Now, if<br/>
the 1H-slash, music, offense, defense, or dual were capped, I would<br/>
be more worried.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that Offense and Defense seem to be capped at 5xLevel<br/>
for both my Monk and my Bard, as opposed to the usual 5+5xLevel for<br/>
the basic combat skills.<br/>
<br/>
The only other skill I regularly pump up is Fishing, and I regularly<br/>
train it up to 5+5xLevel. It might go higher, but generally that seems<br/>
to match the amount of fishing I do per level, so I can&#39;t say whether<br/>
that is the cap or not.<br/>
<br/>
I had the fortune of being sold a Mino Axe at Level 6 -- it cost me<br/>
just about everything I had in the bank, including the money I was<br/>
saving for the Level 6 song -- and I really like the jump in damage;<br/>
I&#39;m Level 7 now, having fun with Goblins and beginning to get a feel<br/>
for what songs are useful in group situations. So far, it&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
when travelling (or panicing ;), and a combination of Jonathan&#39;s and<br/>
Restoration while fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a quick way to put away a weapon and pull out a drum, for those<br/>
run-away-quick-in-a-panic situations?<br/>
