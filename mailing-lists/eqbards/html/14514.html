&gt;Hmmm since those are ALL/ALL and bards can dual wield their fists when <br/>
&gt;punching with a mandolin/lute, can the same be said for monks?  I have an <br/>
&gt;18th level monk and that would be so damn cool to punch with one of those <br/>
&gt;in my hand.  Holding one in each hand would be even better.  Sort of a <br/>
&gt;testament to my bard.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t dual wield instruments... BUT there&#39;s a lute-looking thingy which <br/>
is not really an instrument in-game; the Lisera Lute from Qeynos (Lore item <br/>
so you can&#39;t wield two of them), which is free for anyone who bothers to ask <br/>
for it.  It looks like a lute, feels like a lute, and is even called a lute, <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t affect Hymn healing rates and you can wield it in one hand <br/>
and a weapon in the other - for a brief time I ran around wielding a lute <br/>
and sword &#39;cause I loved the confused /tells I got.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do you DO that?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Bard magic - trickery and legerdemain.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I dunno about you folks, but I love finding stuff like this to do = )<br/>
