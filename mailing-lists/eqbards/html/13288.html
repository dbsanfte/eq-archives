&gt; 		Get home, turn on pc.  Open cupboards looking for something<br/>
&gt; that can cook in the time it takes my pc to boot.  Fail miserably.  Decide I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really need to eat anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Next time you go to the store, get lots of soup and 5min frozen dinners<br/>
  &lt;g&gt;  If you are a health nut, get the Healthy Choice dinners ;-)<br/>
  I think for the past 9 months, I&#39;ve lived on just that.<br/>

&gt; 		Housemate 2 comes in completely pissed that the vcr messed<br/>
&gt; up the tape of the latest Buffy episode (note: he&#39;s 32).  I resist the urge<br/>
&gt; to ask what the &quot;purpose&quot; of Buffy is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Nothing wrong with Buffy ;-)  Although I haven&#39;t watched tv in 9<br/>
  months or so &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
  My friends keep trying to drag me out to play PuttPutt, or watch<br/>
  some Movie, yuk... that means I&#39;d have to hang around other people<br/>
  and drive and spend money... Ahhh, my nice comfortable chair...<br/>
  Accept, esc, esc, esc...  /smirk<br/>
