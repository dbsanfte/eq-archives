&gt;The other day while coming across a particular warrior on a venture, I <br/>
&gt;noticed how he would start fighting something that he couldn&#39;t handle and <br/>
&gt;constantly rely on others to finish off his beasty or zone (zoned more often <br/>
&gt;than not.)  I thought a song might bring the young warrior some courage, but <br/>
&gt;he didn&#39;t seem to appreciate my tune?  Has any other bard had this problem?  <br/>
&gt;The lyrics are below--perhaps a fellow bard can advise me on possible <br/>
&gt;alterations?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Brave Sir Robin,<br/>
&gt;Bravely ran away!<br/>
&gt;When danger reared its ugly head<br/>
&gt;He bravely tucked his tail and fled!<br/>
&gt;Bravely bravely bravely<br/>
&gt; Brave Sir Robin<br/>
&gt;Bravely ran away<br/>
&gt;Brave Sir Robin<br/>
&gt;Never becomes afraid<br/>
&gt;To have his liver cut out<br/>
&gt;and his head bashed in<br/>
&gt;and his heart ripped out<br/>
&gt;and his eyes pushed in<br/>
&gt;and his arms torn off<br/>
&gt;and his bowels removed<br/>
&gt;and his toes cut off<br/>
&gt;and his ribs crushed in<br/>
&gt;Bravely bravely bravely<br/>
&gt;Brrrave Sir Robin<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why didn&#39;t he enjoy my melody?<br/>
