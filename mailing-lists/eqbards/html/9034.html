<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155417653">Wow, thanks for the tip on clearing the &quot;trash&quot; mobs from the<br/>
hills here to get giants to spawn.  I made over 350pp there<br/>
tonight, and each of my friends there made over 200pp (I was<br/>
soloing a couple hours before the others showed up).  I think<br/>
my guild raked in close to 2000pp for the night, as well as 8<br/>
or 9 lambent stones.  Now if they&#39;ll just fix Genni...<br/>
<br/>
This place is a high level bard&#39;s dream.  Lots of open space<br/>
to run around in, great cash loot, merchants nearby so you can<br/>
sell the heavy weapons, etc.  The only down side was that I<br/>
died once.  I had two giants fighting each other, then charm<br/>
was resisted 4 times in a row, I accidently let Accelerando<br/>
drop, and got chain-stunned 3 times, which was long enough for<br/>
both giants to kill me.  My group wasn&#39;t able to get within<br/>
range to heal me in time.<br/>
