<div id="ygrps-yiv-187112465">Right, it isn&#39;t the limitation of speaking that is the problem here for<br/>
Verant.  They can legally limit your speech because Norrath is not a public<br/>
place.  What they cannot legally do is deny you access to your &#39;Real&#39;<br/>
property, ie something that has a cash value, because they choose to limit<br/>
your speech.  <br/>
<br/>
Use this example.  Can I go into my boss&#39; office and call him an ignorant<br/>
jack-off and expect my free-speech rights to protect me from losing my job?<br/>
No, of course not.  I can however, expect that my boss cannot deny me access<br/>
to my coat at my desk, as well as the rest of my personal possessions there,<br/>
and in that I&#39;d be legally correct.  They may throw them in a box and carry<br/>
them to me outside the premises, but they stil are required by law to<br/>
provide me access to them.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t the free speech that&#39;s the problem here.  I am not in any way<br/>
saying they can&#39;t legally limit someone&#39;s speech within their &#39;private&#39;<br/>
domain.  They cannot however take someone&#39;s property just because someone<br/>
violated their rules within their domain.<br/>
<br/>
Its a whole other issue as to whether the sale of Norrathian items on E-bay<br/>
is allowed.  It certainly is not illegal in any way.  By the very act of not<br/>
preventing or even attempting to curtail it, Verant has given tacit approval<br/>
to the practice, their license agreement notwithstanding.  In fact, by<br/>
changing the passwords and station names on some purchased accounts, Verant<br/>
has in fact tacitly supported the ability of these things to be sold for<br/>
real money, thereby undermining any defense they might have had in this<br/>
matter.  Getting an attorney or judge to actually rule on these things<br/>
however is a very different matter.  While the letter of the law may in fact<br/>
be violated by this practice, it remains to be seen if the violation falls<br/>
within the limits of enforceability.<br/>

Hmm. Does he mean salable as in for plat? Or auctionable on ebay? If<br/>
it&#39;s the latter I think the I Agree you click every time you log in<br/>
specifically says it&#39;s not. However, if he could make the case that<br/>
Verant, by not even attempting to use the avenues Ebay makes available<br/>
to intellectual property owners to stop these sales, is giving tacit<br/>
approval, then he might get somewhere. It would be nice to see someone<br/>
actually try this, if nothing else to see Verant forced to give more<br/>
than lip service to shutting it down.<br/>
<br/>
As for constitutional rights, reread your constitution. It specificly<br/>
says the government can&#39;t stop you from speaking, it says nothing about<br/>
what a private company does on thier own property. I think there has<br/>
been some state level judgements that stopped shopping malls, for<br/>
instance from limiting people&#39;s speech, as the malls were ruled to be a<br/>
public place, so you&#39;d have to get Norrath ruled the same.<br/>

&gt; It is property, according to definitions under US Law.  One of my gaming<br/>
&gt; buddies, who is a lawyer, came up with an even more interesting<br/>
proposition.<br/>
&gt; If my equipment is saleable my me, and therefore my property, if Verant<br/>
&gt; decides to deny me access to that equipment without due process, they are<br/>
&gt; guilty of denying me my own property without such due process, which is<br/>
&gt; under US law a violation of my civil rights.  I may have the wording not<br/>
&gt; entirely correct on this as it is from memory, but that&#39;s about how our<br/>
&gt; attorney gaming friend laid it out.  Interestingly as such, Verant also<br/>
&gt; cannot ban someone for anything they say while online.  Despite the fact<br/>
&gt; that it is in the TOS that you cannot say certain things without being<br/>
&gt; banned, US civil liberties laws specifically prohibit anyone from<br/>
&gt; voluntarily abrogating their own constitutional rights except in cases of<br/>
&gt; national security.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Makes one think doesn&#39;t it.<br/>
