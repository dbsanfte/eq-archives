don&#39;t spam the list.  I just got sent this joke and being one who likes to <br/>
share a jest and a good tale or two I had to share it with all my fellow <br/>
bards:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A Mom is driving a little girl to her friends house for a play date.<br/>
&quot;Mommy,&quot; the little girl asks, &quot;how old are you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Honey, you are not supposed to ask a lady her age,&quot;  the mother warns.<br/>
&quot;It is not polite.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ok,&quot;  the little girl says, &quot;How much do you weigh?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now really,&quot;  the mother says, &quot;these are personal questions and are<br/>
really none of your business.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Undaunted, the little girl asks, &quot;Why did you and daddy get a divorce?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That is enough questions, honestly!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The exasperated mother walks away as the two friends begin to play.<br/>
&quot;My mom wouldn&#39;t tell me anything,&quot;  the little girl says to her friend.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well,&quot; said the friend, &quot;all you need to do is look at her drivers<br/>
license. It is like a report card, it has everything on it.<br/>
<br/>
Later that night the little girl says to her mother, &quot;I know how old you<br/>
are, you are 32.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The mother is surprised and asks, &quot;How did you find that out?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I also know that you weigh 140 pounds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The mother is past surprise and shock now.  &quot;How in heavens name did<br/>
you find that out?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And,&quot;  the little girl says triumphantly, &quot;I know why you and daddy got<br/>
a divorce.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh really?&quot; the mother asks. &quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because you got an F in Sex.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
