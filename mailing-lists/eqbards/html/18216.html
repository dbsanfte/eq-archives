Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
As most of you have already noticed, there are a few items (weapons and<br/>
singing steel armor) appearing from the new lands of Kunark.<br/>
<br/>
Before any of you go berserk on how much the singing steel armor sucks, here<br/>
is the good news. We&#39;ve been talking to the live team and dev team,<br/>
currently only a few pieces of Singing armor sets are ready and they do not<br/>
have any stats / effect included in the data file YET.<br/>
<br/>
Soon these new armors will have stats bonus like imbured / lambent (but<br/>
better), and some pieces will even have process like JBoots. These new armor<br/>
looks apple green, not exactly as good looking as imbured IHMO but it&#39;s<br/>
still a charming color nevertheless.<br/>
<br/>
As for the new weapons, many of you should already noticed these weapons<br/>
have better damage / delay ratio than our planer weapons, and it is indeed<br/>
Verant&#39;s intention to replace planer gear with Kunark gears.<br/>
<br/>
Last night 3 groups of us spend over 4 hours hunting in Kunor&#39;s Castle, the<br/>
item drop rate is very nice, the mobs are not too hard (more like planer<br/>
level mobs) but they come very often and usually comes in group of 4 to 5.<br/>
With 3 enchanters we did ok and got some very good loots.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the new strategy of Verant to try fixing camping problem is this,<br/>
fast mob respawn and with good item drop, so everyone will get their chance<br/>
at items without camping sites for months. This is a very good start and I<br/>
really hope this would breath some new air into EQ.<br/>
<br/>
So here you go, I hope this info would help.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; not that they aren&#39;t very nice, but the new singing steel <br/>
&gt; bard armor so far<br/>
&gt; has been AC only with no stats.  the boots are only AC 18, <br/>
&gt; and gauntlets<br/>
&gt; were found that are only AC 14, with no stats.  i&#39;m in the <br/>
&gt; mood for some new<br/>
&gt; unique weapons, but i will probably keep in my full set of <br/>
&gt; imbrued cause<br/>
&gt; looks always come first over stats! =)  plus with the exp <br/>
&gt; being so slow,<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve got enough to worry about than getting another ste of armor, ugh!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The one that I&#39;m REALLY trying to get right now is a good <br/>
&gt; &gt; friend (another bard) got a pair of AC18 bard<br/>
&gt; &gt; only boots plus some stats that are the same color as the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hero bracer out of Kunar Castle :-)<br/>
