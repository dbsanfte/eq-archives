<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-681182244">&lt;snip&gt; How does one go to an already broken Fear plane and not expect <br/>
to be bored off his ass? The only time I could see this being even <br/>
remotely exciting is if a GM showed up and re-popped the entire zone <br/>
at once, which they would only do if some mobs were bugged. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because they haven&#39;t been there before and don&#39;t know what to <br/>
expect?  Some people are *gasp* just approaching the level limit of <br/>
the planes for the first time in their first character.  They never <br/>
had the opporunity to find the planes uncamped, unfarmed, with a <br/>
population less than 40... And, you know what?  They likely never <br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;If you want an exciting experience, try not farming Fear for <br/>
once, and instead breaking it open on a full pop. You might actually <br/>
have a challenge  *gasp* and fun. Instead of seeing maybe 2-3 dozen <br/>
mobs in 5.5 hours, you will more than likely see 2-3 dozen mobs in <br/>
your first couple hours, depending on how efficient your raiding <br/>
party is. Not only will you kill a lot more in less time, but you <br/>
will see more loot drop in a shorter amount of time. Last time I was <br/>
on a Fear raid, we saw no less than 8 drops in the first hour. It <br/>
reminded me of the candyland that was the original Fear plane <br/>
opening. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because as you say below, it&#39;s camped 24/7 and there&#39;s no way <br/>
to get a zone full of mobs to experience the &quot;fun&quot; of breaking fear.  <br/>
If you want to go, you join the &quot;farmers&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Better-than-thou attitudes and people who flame others for asking a <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kruegen says, &#39;How do I farm the plane of fear?<br/>
&gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;It is an easy task, done by many! Simply fetch me <br/>
 </span></blockquote>[a shovel] and [Treasure bag] and we can get started! There is a <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kruegen says, &#39;What is the reward?&#39;<br/>
&gt; Lleluvyn says, &#39;Ah! The reward you ask? The reward is free [phat <br/>
 </span></blockquote>lewtz] with no risk other then [/random 100].<br/>
<br/>
It neither offends me nor even comes close to making me laugh.  It&#39;s <br/>
just not funny.<br/>

/Rant on<br/>
<br/>
At such a critical point in EQ for Bards (the response to Chains and <br/>
testing of Lullaby), you&#39;d think this list would have a flurry of <br/>
activity and discussion going on.  <br/>
<br/>
IMHO, it&#39;s responses like this one that&#39;s taken this list from over <br/>
1500 posts a month to 329 so far this month.  This used to be a list <br/>
free of flames and free (for the most part) of people stroking their <br/>
egos.  These days, you can barely go 2 threads without one or the <br/>
other popping up.<br/>
<br/>
The result?  People find other places to communicate flame free.  I <br/>
won&#39;t advertise those places since I&#39;d risk spoiling them.<br/>
