I have yet to go to an LARP/SCA event, but I have enjoyed making costumes<br/>
for our Excalibur Gathering last year. I don&#39;t go to SCA lengths but try to<br/>
make period pieces that look authentic without spending a ton. They come in<br/>
handy at Halloween and when we go to the Medival Faires also.<br/>
Snicker&#39;s Amtgard site was long the memory tag I searched for to find the<br/>
early EQ bard song lists also. There is/was a link off his site.<br/>

Atonal: no mask yet?! Be sure and hang around and try for a bag off the<br/>
supplier. Same room and it&#39;s his common drop. I just got the Erudite<br/>
illusion mask the other week. Makes my kylong legs look much better with my<br/>
green bp and arms and hides my imbrued boots.<br/>
