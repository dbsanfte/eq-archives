<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966085229">Hawks, falcons (and owls?) are in the &#39;class&#39; raptor (or is it order or<br/>
family? kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species?)  Anyhow,<br/>
when I see raptor, I think falcons & hawks.  If they intended a pre-historic<br/>
reference, I would have thought they&#39;d use a &quot;drake&quot; or one of the flying<br/>
things that look pre-historic.  These &quot;raptors&quot; look like a Flintstone(tm)<br/>
dino and are 100% land based (ok, they do swim if they get feared into the<br/>
water).  Confused me - but then I used to be a birder.<br/>

p.s. a long time ago, in a real world, far, far away... I used to be a<br/>
legal, licensed, practicing falconer.  Some of the birds I have known up<br/>
close and personal include: red-tail hawks, kestrals, goshawks, prairie<br/>
falcons for the sport and a golden eagle (re-habillitation bird.)  Some of<br/>
the books I bought to learn the techniques were written in the 16th<br/>
century - heh.<br/>

&gt; &gt;It looks simply wicked!  It does good damage too. Used it on some raptors<br/>
&gt; &gt;(dinos not birds?? only Vernat...) in Timourous Deep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Um... Raptor is a classic name for hte dinosaur-like birds, I thought?<br/>
