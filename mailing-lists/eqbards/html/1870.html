<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139103433">That is VERY incorrect.  Each weapon resolves its own unique round and has<br/>
its own unique speed.  And easy enough to test, if you doubt me.  Put a<br/>
rusty bastard sword (or some other very slow 1h weapon) in your offhand, and<br/>
a dagger in the primary.  Time the pierce attacks.  They will go off every 2<br/>
seconds (provided the dagger you use is a 20 delay weapon) without fail.<br/>
<br/>
I think Mr. Kim may be confused at what I was stating.  The speed of each<br/>
weapon, in each hand, is the basis for each roundtime, and I apologize if I<br/>
didn&#39;t make that clear enough.<br/>
<br/>
As far as weapon speed in the offhand, it does matter, and it can be a huge<br/>
advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, the chances each individual swing is the same, no matter what speed<br/>
weapon you use, but a faster weapon simply nets you many more swings, and as<br/>
such, yields many more chances to activate.  Simply put, probability is in<br/>
favor of more successful attack resolutions with more speed.  Combat has a<br/>
large random component, it makes sense to weight it as much as you can in<br/>
your favor.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one reason the exceptionally fast weapons such as the Demon Claw<br/>
(5/19) CAN NOT be used in the offhand.  They are simply too fast and do to<br/>
much base damage, so in order to maintain balance for the level range they<br/>
are found at, they were tagged primary only.  There are more efficient<br/>
weapons that can be dual wielded, but that efficiency is counterbalanced by<br/>
the higher delay, making them less effective in the secondary.<br/>

&gt;Dual Wield uses the weapons speed of your slowest weapon....<br/>
&gt;So if you have a dagger with a delay of 6 and a axe with a delay of 15 or<br/>
&gt;so, your dagger also has a delay of 15 now<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since dual wield checks to see if it goes off every swing cycle, more<br/>
&gt;speed<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; means more chances to dual wield, netting a HUGE increase in damage over<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; time by using a faster weapon.  HUGE.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;d disagree with this.  If you&#39;re using different speed<br/>
&gt;&gt;weapons, the dual wield check seems to be asynchronous with<br/>
&gt;&gt;your primary weapon.  I&#39;ve watched several times as my<br/>
&gt;&gt;off-hand would swing, pause, primary, pause, off-hand, pause,<br/>
&gt;&gt;primary, etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;If this is correct and the dual wield check is made every<br/>
&gt;&gt;swing cycle of the off-hand weapon, then the weapon speed does<br/>
&gt;&gt;not matter.  If your dual wield goes off 30% of the time, then<br/>
&gt;&gt;it will increase your damage 30% regardless of what the weapon<br/>
&gt;&gt;speed is.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;*Most* of the times dual-wield succeeds it seems to be<br/>
&gt;&gt;sychronized, so there may be more to it.  Perhaps it only goes<br/>
&gt;&gt;asynchronous after a successful dual wield, and after a<br/>
&gt;&gt;failure the next check is synchronous with your primary hand?<br/>
&gt;&gt;That seems a rather convoluted way to program it; but if<br/>
&gt;&gt;that&#39;s the case, then Mr. Capozzi is correct, although the<br/>
&gt;&gt;increase in damage is not quite HUGE :-), and this advantage<br/>
&gt;&gt;becomes less the better you get at dual wield.<br/>
