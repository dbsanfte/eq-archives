<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Speaking for myself, Lullaby worked a helluva lot better at <br/>
&gt; 18 than it did<br/>
&gt; at 31.  I happen to be one of the bards who got caught in the <br/>
&gt; stealth nerf<br/>
&gt; of Lullaby so long ago.  One day I was saving my party from <br/>
&gt; certain death,<br/>
&gt; then the stealth nerf goes in, and now instead of saving the <br/>
&gt; party, I save<br/>
&gt; everyone but myself.  So for the few of us still around from <br/>
&gt; release, I know<br/>
&gt; how useful the song used to be.  <br/>
