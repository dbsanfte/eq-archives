<b>Subject:</b> Re: [eqbards] Killing Maestro (was nerf thread) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-905891644">Did my first Hate raid over the weekend.  Killed Maestro 2 times, and i <br/>
missed him on Friday.  Also Innoruk was killed Friday and Monday night.  <br/>
They can be killed.  All i did was to keep the party resistances buffed for <br/>
both mobs, and we (about 36-50 depending on night) won the fights with few <br/>
deaths.  Not sure if anyone has said it yet, but the Evensong mace appears <br/>
to be the common drop, so keep up that 1hb skill! :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Btw, I would love to know when (and if) anyone takes out Maestro after<br/>
&gt;the mid-week patch last week, and how it was done.  The uber-players in<br/>
&gt;my guild are of the opinion that he&#39;s been bumped to L63.  Their<br/>
&gt;consensus is that Cazic Thule is a pansy compared to the new improved<br/>
&gt;Maestro.  I&#39;m sure this opinion has nothing to do with the fact that he<br/>
&gt;smoked us twice.  ;)<br/>
