It is very easy to delete the ones that are about twinking.  Obviously with<br/>
everyone replying there is an interest and varying opinions on the subject.<br/>
I guess I could make a EQ_Twinking mailing list :)  I don&#39;t mind reading off<br/>
topic discussions as long as they are interesting.  At least we are<br/>
discussing the twinking of bards :)</div>
