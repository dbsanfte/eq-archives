		I&#39;ve been trying to give my bard some method of magical<br/>
attacks to<br/>
		supplement his dissonance (I&#39;m currently level 11 -- can&#39;t<br/>
wait until<br/>
		I get below).<br/>
<br/>
		So, questions:<br/>
<br/>
		1.  How much does dissonance with and without the<br/>
lute/mandolin<br/>
		    at each level?  I&#39;ve heard 16 damage at level 30, but<br/>
that<br/>
		    doesn&#39;t help when you&#39;re having a hard time getting up<br/>
to<br/>
		    20 in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
		2.  I took the very long trip to Innothule and spent a few<br/>
hours<br/>
		    killing frogloks for netted armor.  Now, mind you, I<br/>
made a<br/>
		    pretty good profit selling all the rusty weapons I could<br/>
haul<br/>
		    to Oasis, and I have an almost complete set of netted<br/>
armor<br/>
		    to auction off.  But I thought that having netted gloves<br/>
		    (which are magical) would let me fight hand to hand<br/>
against<br/>
		    magic-only monsters.<br/>
<br/>
		3.  Are there any weapons/armor out there that we can use as<br/>
bards<br/>
		    to supplement our instrumental damage songs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		Many thanks in advance.<br/>
