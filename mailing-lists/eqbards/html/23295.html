<div id="ygrps-yiv-699677499">Yes, I find it a ton easier to use overhead than 1st person (3rd person might be ok too, but I never got the<br/>
hang of it).  1st person it&#39;s too easy for things to get in the way, overhead view there&#39;s no layering (a MOB<br/>
hidden behind a PC or a MOB).  Makes it easier to follow moving MOBs, too (since you can actually see which way<br/>
they went), so I use it in most fights.<br/>

&gt; &gt; song, I can sing a full five during a twist, which lets me control 3-4 things with 1-2 resists.  (Lag<br/>

&gt;  Ken, gott&#39;a ask. Do you find going to an overhead view helps targeting<br/>
&gt; in that situation ? I love Mez and consider it much more effective than<br/>
&gt; Charm because of it&#39;s ability to take more than 2 crits out of the<br/>
&gt; action and in addition, after hitting 51 Moonflower is finding REALLY<br/>
&gt; limited song space. She can only have space for one crowd control and<br/>
&gt; Mez is it.<br/>
