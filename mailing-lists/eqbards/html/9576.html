Your car does not vanish if you forget to change the oil, just<br/>
the cost of future repairs is increased.  And by the time most<br/>
car engines start to wear out, most people are looking to buy<br/>
a new car anyway.  Once people realize their bladed thulian<br/>
claws could vanish on them in a blink of an eye, they will<br/>
repair it religiously.<br/>
<br/>
Heh, heh, you and I would maybe but not everyone.  And yes your car can<br/>
effectively vanish if you forget to change the oil.  case in point I have a<br/>
friend who could easily afford the 30 dollars every 3 months for an oil<br/>
change.  Since he owned his car for 1 year and never changed the oil or even<br/>
checked it in fact, one night the engine seized up requiring a new engine at<br/>
a 3000 dollar price tag he could not afford.  He takes the bus now.  Due to<br/>
his negligence his car literally vanished overnite.  He also cannot claim he<br/>
did not know about it as this was the second car he had lost because he<br/>
never bothered to maintain it.  The first one was showing warning indicators<br/>
for two months before the engine fried because his radiator finally leaked<br/>
out enough that it too seized up.  There are other people I know less well<br/>
who have the same thing happen to them.  Too if your claws disappear the<br/>
cost of upkeeping them has just increased to having to kill the guy that<br/>
spawns them again.  Too bad you can&#39;t just kill a guy who spawns a new car.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me you wouldn&#39;t believe how many people fighting would say, aw its<br/>
only nicked.  So maybe it&#39;ll disappear I&#39;ll risk it its too far to run to<br/>
Freeport to fix.  I&#39;ll bet weapons would even be breaking in East Commons,<br/>
and people say I&#39;m optimistic.<br/>
