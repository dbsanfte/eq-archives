<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332679734">I was the bard who spoke up, said my piece after the patch.  Abashi seemed to be quite pissie in his response, but I can understand that.  <br/>
<br/>
I tell ya all this... I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s different people working on equipment, and if they got another song in.  We are still missing 3 songs, and should not settle.  Why bards are a lower priority than other classes, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
On the good foot, tried the invis song, and it worked...<br/>
<br/>
Tried the area affect songs... Largos almost got me killed in lguk... pulled 2 outta 3 froggies off a pally & ranger, I am assuming they were laying on the taunt button...<br/>
<br/>
All in all... I think he was saying, if I don&#39;t like it, I can leave.<br/>
<br/>
Something about not being able to satisfy all the people.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno... just doesn&#39;t seem right to me<br/>
