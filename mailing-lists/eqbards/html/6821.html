<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026105006"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Anyone wandered around Kilthkor lately?  Saw some<br/>
&gt; names just hanging in the air.  Shadow men.   Targeted<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re new since the last patch. They can be found<br/>
in Kithicor, Highpass, Lesser Faydark and a few<br/>
other places as well. They are summoned creatures so<br/>
those dispel summoned spells work great on them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; motto to this point has been, if you can&#39;t be safe, be<br/>
&gt; fast.  But for the first time since I got the speed<br/>
&gt; song, something odd happened.  At level 30, with the<br/>
&gt; Mistmoor Drum, I was getting hit from behind.  A lot. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is no running spell, song or device that will<br/>
outrun the Shadowed Men. Including Spirit Of Cheetah<br/>
and the Guide&#39;s speed girdle.<br/>

&gt; now in our spooky liitle woods, can anyone verify.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They usually drop shadowed weapons which say they can<br/>
be equiped by warriors, but can&#39;t be equiped by anyone<br/>
at this time. This detail might be a bug. But the<br/>
items may also be for a quest that hasn&#39;t been found<br/>
as of yet. The items these mobs drop are also summoned<br/>
and thus disappear when you log off.</div>
