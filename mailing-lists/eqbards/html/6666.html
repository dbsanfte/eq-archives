announce an upcoming event on the Innoruuk server that is very special to<br/>
me..my wedding:) Kambei Shimada an Erudite Wizard of great skill..and<br/>
greater charm... has asked me to become his wife..and the blood of my gyspy<br/>
mother pounds hot in my veins with love for him!  I invite those here to<br/>
come and celebrate with us!<br/>
<br/>
When: Sept. 26th (sunday) at 5PM EST<br/>
Where: lesser faydark at the stone bird monument (LOC -365, -1669)<br/>
<br/>
There will be drinking..dancing..songs (OF COURSE) and no doubt a dueling I<br/>
also have hopes of pulling together a small contest or two for those who<br/>
attend to amuse themselves with.<br/>
