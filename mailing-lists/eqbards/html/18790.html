<div id="ygrps-yiv-447550231">Everyone seems to be using Summon Food and Drink as the prime examples of<br/>
uselessness.  Well aren&#39;t we the class that has been complaining rather<br/>
loudly for over a year that our forage was capped so darned low?  Well<br/>
aren&#39;t we?<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Greaves cast Invisibility.  That&#39;s cool, but we have a song for that<br/>
guys.  Think about it, we *don&#39;t* have songs that can summon food and drink.<br/>
I think it&#39;s kinda nifty, but I will admit that I hope the BP casts Gate.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d be perfectly happy to accept the lower AC if the effects given were in<br/>
&gt; any way in balance to those gained by the other classes.  Point<br/>
&gt; is they are<br/>
&gt; not, in fact they patently suck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Being able to Summon Food and Water is totally a joke.  It would be a joke<br/>
&gt; if it were on armor I could get at 28th level.  At 50+ it&#39;s extremely<br/>
&gt; insulting.  I&#39;m not sure how anyone could reasonably defend that it is<br/>
&gt; really useful to have at 50+.  What do we have now, Verant<br/>
&gt; clones?  Please.<br/>
&gt; Why would characters who have been leaving behind 5pp weapons for<br/>
&gt; 10+ levels<br/>
&gt; because they were trash loot suddenly care about 6cp muffins and milk?<br/>
&gt; Great, now we can save everyone in our party 1.2 sp a day, whoopee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enduring Breath is minorly useful.  Is it anywhere near as useful<br/>
&gt; as +25 STR<br/>
&gt; or Invisibility is to a warrior?  No.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am more irritated by the overall combo than just the AC points.<br/>
&gt;  It shows<br/>
&gt; the usual lack of any kind of thought when it comes to the bard class.  We<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t a tank so we get lower armor.  How does this mesh with giving us a<br/>
&gt; weapon that reduces our level on the hate list?  If we aren&#39;t a tank why<br/>
&gt; should we need a weapon to reduce hate?  It certainly won&#39;t help if we<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t up there mixing it up.<br/>

&gt; snip &gt;I think some of us are losing sight of what the bard class<br/>
&gt; is.  We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; traveling minstrels, not warriors.  Symphonic Harmony proc (Evade) and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Guys, we&#39;re a support class not warriors remember?<br/>
