&gt; I can not, and will not stand for having to buy things with real money for<br/>
&gt; an online game! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  THAT explains it !!! There is a guy named Jalem on the Cazic-Thule<br/>
server who is stealing items from players making trades. He did it to me<br/>
using Invisibility to step between me and my buddy and nicked me for a<br/>
PGT, Executioners Hood, Barbed Legs and a ruby ring. I petitioned that<br/>
this was an EXPLOIT and HARASSMENT under the code of conduct. Four<br/>
others also complained. I watched as he invise&#39;d himself to ply his<br/>
trade, but what I couldn&#39;t figure out was what a low level mage was<br/>
doing with all that stuff. If he can make real cash for it Kati bar the<br/>
door. After 2 days of tracking this guy, a Guide finally &quot;talked&quot; to<br/>
him, told me Jalem denied it and said there was nothing he could do<br/>
unless he observed it himself. We were going to set up a &quot;sting&quot;<br/>
operation but Jalem got nervous about all the folks standing around him<br/>
and logged.<br/>
  PS. I did challenge him to a dual with my 11th level enchanter in the<br/>
Freeport bank. He took a swing at me and the guards killed him &lt;snicker&gt;<br/>
but i still couldn&#39;t loot the body.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, if you run into this guy on Cazic, give Moonflower a tell and<br/>
if anybody has any ideas how to stop this let me know. <br/>
    Thanks,<br/>
