&gt; Definitely Agreed!  Still I can&#39;t figure out why people think running naked<br/>
&gt; accross the world to you body is more fun than regaining exp you had fun<br/>
&gt; getting the first time just so you don&#39;t get set back in some bizarre got to<br/>
&gt; get to the next level plan.  What&#39;s up with that?  Does anyone understand<br/>
&gt; that at all and can explain it logically?  I mean you had fun getting those<br/>
&gt; xp the first time.  You get to get them all over again and have fun again?<br/>

I&#39;ll repeat I don&#39;t understand either why the bind location<br/>
rules are different for casters and melee.  All the arguments<br/>
I can come up with for not allowing melee to bind anywhere are<br/>
short circuited because casters can do the same thing by<br/>
binding anywhere.  Maybe if casters came back at zero mana I<br/>
could understand...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider it that big a deal though.  I dunno, maybe I<br/>
just don&#39;t die as often as you do.<br/>
