<div id="ygrps-yiv-296330083">I used to do this a lot too, now I&#39;ll tell my group that if they want me to<br/>
weave Hymn with Clarity between battles, that means that I&#39;m having to weave<br/>
songs nearly 100% of the time that I&#39;m grouped with them, in battle and out.<br/>
Practially in &quot;battle mode&quot; all the time.  What do they do between battles?<br/>
Well they chat, go to the bathroom, get a Coke, mem spells, do guildsay,<br/>
etc.  I don&#39;t get to do any of these things if I&#39;m weaving Hymn/Clarity.<br/>
Sure, if I&#39;m the only healer in a group (it happens) or we&#39;re making a big<br/>
effort to keep downtime minimized then there&#39;s no choice.  But If there&#39;s a<br/>
Shaman or better in the group I beg off of playing Hymn.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Prior to 32d level, whenever I grouped with a 32+ bard they<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I almost always intersperse one pulse of hymn for every two of clarity,<br/>
&gt; and have never received complaint about the mana coming more slowly for<br/>
&gt; doing so.<br/>
