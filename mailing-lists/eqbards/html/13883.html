For the first several items though, any named mob will do,<br/>
which doesn&#39;t require you to clear since it&#39;s very unlikely<br/>
that all the named mobs are spawned and in place.  OTOH, with<br/>
just one named mob dropping the item, it&#39;s analagous to trying<br/>
to get the last couple items under the other system - there&#39;s<br/>
a good chance he might already be spawned so you have to<br/>
clear.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I&#39;ve added an (OT) flag to the subject.<br/>
