Subject: [eqbards] what weapon? and other questions...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi everybody!<br/>
<br/>
I am nearly ready to take on some Willo-whisps (i am almost lvl 11)<br/>
but I need a good *cheap* magic weapon, as my tarnished broad sword <br/>
aint gonna cut it.  How much can I expect to pay for a weapon that <br/>
will do the trick?  I am on a tight budget right now, what with <br/>
buying songs and learning to smith :)  <br/>
<br/>
Also, when soloing which do you prefer: Anthem de arms, or Whistling <br/>
warsong?  <br/>
<br/>
Also Also, how hard is it to get that other level 9 song I heard can <br/>
only be gotten in Luclin, &quot;Magical Monologue&quot;  (of course I&#39;ll have <br/>
to buy the exp first) so that i can save my Platinum and not have to <br/>
buy a magic weapon?<br/>
<br/>
Also Also Also does the bellow that bards get at lvl 12 affect <br/>
creatures that can only be hit with magic weapons, and does that song <br/>
show you how much dammage you are delivering (whereas the chords of <br/>
disonance only say &quot;Large Spider winces&quot; etc)?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening!<br/>
