<br/>
The highest Bard in my guild (Level 31) gave me these directions as well,<br/>
and turned out to be wrong. I assume the vendor has been moved since then.<br/>
The vendor who sells the song is in the first room on the left once you get<br/>
into the big room with the pillars. You have to open a door in this room<br/>
and then go around a corner.<br/>

&gt;Well, now that all my attempts to hide the spoiler have been<br/>
&gt;thwarted by others quoting the message...  The bank is in High<br/>
&gt;Hold itself.  On the first floor near the back there is a<br/>
&gt;clerk for the inn.  Go further back and one of the doors leads<br/>
&gt;to the prison area.  Take a right after going through that<br/>
&gt;door and you&#39;ll come to a vendor at a counter who is the bank.<br/>
&gt;Do not explore the prison area unless you are fairly high<br/>
&gt;level.  The prisoners are not locked up, and will attack you<br/>
&gt;if you get too close.  The guards will not attack them.<br/>
