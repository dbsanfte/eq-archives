<div id="ygrps-yiv-505865209">I think you may not be witnessing the complaint here. At least some of us will<br/>
be standing somewhere, farther away from mobs than other players, NOT singing,<br/>
maybe not even in a group. Someone else attacks a mob. One or more mobs rush<br/>
past the attacker and attack &lt;me&gt; the bard.<br/>
<br/>
I did not notice this behavior at lower levels at all. However, I started seeing<br/>
it some at around 15th, and now at 17th it is outrageous. Yesterday at a Dervish<br/>
Camp, where almost all the Dervs conned blue to me (some green) I was standing<br/>
FAR back out of their range. A party of 5 9-12 level expeditioners attacked a<br/>
Thug. They even had a 10th level bard in their group. I was playing nothing and<br/>
their bard was buffing with Anthem. The Thug rushed past the group even with<br/>
them hitting it, and attacked me. So did the other 2 Dervs in the camp. The<br/>
group of course stood there, thank god for Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
*grins*<br/>
<br/>
Mind you that after I zoned I took 3 faction hits with the Dervs, one for the<br/>
Thug that I had actually hit, and 2 hits for the other 2, just because they<br/>
didn&#39;t like me. I&#39;m in full banded now, and can&#39;t wait to start on brass plate,<br/>
because yes, we are public enemy #1.<br/>
(Notice I saved you the misery of the story from Befallen, where I and a group<br/>
mate are sitting in a room while he was afk, and I see the door open and no less<br/>
then 8 assorted skeletons including the elf, 3 necros with pets, and 2 mummies<br/>
all start attacking me. We were no where near a train area either. This stuff<br/>
HATES bards).<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I didn&#39;t spare you.<br/>
*evil grin*<br/>
<br/>
All this means to me is a solid group will love us because we can fetch almost<br/>
any mob just by running around. Just don&#39;t fetch a Sand Giant until you have<br/>
alot more levels under your belt.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The bard helps all of the party.  The mobs hate anyone helping anyone they<br/>
&gt; are fighting.  So, you are going to be number one on their hit list.  Also,<br/>
&gt; your hp is lower than the tanks.  So a given amount of damage to you will be<br/>
&gt; a higher percentage of your total hp than the same amount applied to a tank.<br/>
&gt; All of the mobs will want to hit you and maybe the one other party member<br/>
&gt; who is hitting them.  So, the tanks will be fighting one mob while you will<br/>
&gt; be fighting all of them.<br/>
