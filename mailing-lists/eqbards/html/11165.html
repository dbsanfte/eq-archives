Q: What changed with Levitate on the last patch?<br/>
<br/>
A: Levitate was changed so that if you already have the Levitate spell on<br/>
your<br/>
character, no other levitate effect will take hold. This was done to <br/>
prevent a certain<br/>
abuses of the spell which involved chain casting levitate to reach areas <br/>
which were not<br/>
designed to be player accessible.<br/>
<br/>
To get your levitation spell renewed, you can click to dispel it (this is <br/>
one of the<br/>
few spells that everybody can click to remove). Once the spell has been <br/>
removed, you will<br/>
be able to have it renewed.<br/>
<br/>
Bards were unintentionally hurt with these changes - their song will not <br/>
overwrite its<br/>
own levitate effect. This error will be fixed with the next patch. <br/>
