<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500956744">I know what you mean all to well. I am also a casual<br/>
player. well. sorta.. about 3 hours a day 4 or 5 days<br/>
a week.  <br/>
<br/>
.. I spent about 2 months at lvl 23. I was spending a<br/>
lot of time running around to wherever my friends were<br/>
so I could associate with them.  Also they had more<br/>
time to play so even though they played 2 or 3 char.<br/>
all of them were soon higher than me and going places<br/>
that were a little too hard for me... among other<br/>
things i was in sol a at 23  dying a lot, in cazic<br/>
courtyard (still 23barely). dying a lot.  in upper guk<br/>
at 23(almost lost 23 there) ... (Oh .. forgot you<br/>
couldnt gate-- gotta love pickup groups).. ... dying a<br/>
lot... these all have long corpse runs.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to move to high keep and am now 26, just 3<br/>
weeks later.  The waiting list in ungodly. I would<br/>
usually log in AT LEAST an hour before i want to play<br/>
and get my name on waiting lists (usually would be #7<br/>
or so). I would then wander by and check the cptr<br/>
every few minutes while i do housework.  (The dishes<br/>
and laundry have to be done sometime).  Then when i<br/>
was ready to play, I would double check with the list<br/>
keeper where i was on the list and then either go out<br/>
into high pass and goof around or go upstairs and work<br/>
on brewing and baking. I could usually get into a<br/>
group less than two hours after I got on the list.  . <br/>
.  . One night alas... it took 5 hours... just as i<br/>
was at 5 seconds to camp a tell comes in telling me my<br/>
place was up... <br/>
 <br/>
I dont think it is just that high keep is such an<br/>
awesome place (although it is, bind in same<br/>
zone!!!drastically reduces down time) Also in 24 and<br/>
25 i had a combined total of 5 deaths.. and two of<br/>
them were in everfrost getting my icy greaves to make<br/>
lambent(which i also accomplished in the last three<br/>
weeks).<br/>
<br/>
The technique of getting on a list and just waiting<br/>
while you do other stuff will work well almost<br/>
anwhere.<br/>
