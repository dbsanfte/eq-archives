<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962036238">I am curious how do you try to join groups, is it simply by using /shout or<br/>
/ooc?  You&#39;ll find that a LOT of players turn those channels off due to the<br/>
amount of spam and other inane chatter that goes on there...<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet is to do /who 8 12 (assuming you are level 10) to list the<br/>
players within a couple levels of you - do /tells to them directly.  Also -<br/>
to people nearby a /say is pretty effective.<br/>
<br/>
I can only speak for the Xegony server - but I have only seen a few<br/>
instances of guilds that don&#39;t group with people outside of their group (not<br/>
uncommon however is people leaving an existing group if some group members<br/>
com online...)<br/>

&gt; Well met everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had the pleasure to play to bard&#39;s on two separate servers, and I am<br/>
&gt; finding something very interesting going on that I thought I would ask the<br/>
&gt; rest of you about.<br/>
