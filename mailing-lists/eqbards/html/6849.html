<br/>
27 - Song of the Sirens<br/>
Effect: Charm<br/>
Instrument: Wind, unknown enhancement<br/>
Target: Target<br/>
Does not stack with: Enchanter&#39;s mesmerize line of spells<br/>
Taunt: Very high<br/>
<br/>
Quantified:  Charms the target turning it into your pet for anywhere from<br/>
0 to about 15 seconds.  Using a wind instrument has an unknown effect, if<br/>
any.  High charisma is supposed to help with success rate and duration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Comments:  This song will revitalize your ability to solo.  At this level<br/>
nearly anything that isn&#39;t green to you will tear you to shreds with their<br/>
overpowered melee capability (thanks Verant) if you try to fight them with<br/>
your now-pathetic melee skills.  You know what I&#39;m talking about - casting<br/>
mobs that are nearly impossible to interrupt, casting mobs that double<br/>
attack for 40+ damage, mobs that backstab with their fists, etc.  This<br/>
song lets you turn a mob&#39;s overpowered attacks against its comrades<br/>
instead of against you or your party.  Used smartly, you can avoid taking<br/>
any damage at all.<br/>
<br/>
Your new pet seems to default to a &quot;follow me&quot; and &quot;guard me&quot; state.  This<br/>
has both advantages and disadvantages.  Pet commands start with &quot;/pet&quot;<br/>
followed by the actual command.  Useful commands are &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;back off&quot;<br/>
(to stop it from attacking a party member), &quot;sit down&quot; (just fun to see<br/>
some things sit), &quot;guard here&quot; (if you don&#39;t want it to move from a<br/>
spot), and &quot;follow me&quot; and &quot;guard me&quot; for impressing others by having the<br/>
feared mob call you master.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Strategies:<br/>
<br/>
- Set up the /pet commands as socials buttons, then assign them to your<br/>
hotkeys.  That way you don&#39;t have to type in the full /pet command every<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
- Make sure your party knows you&#39;re charming a mob, otherwise they may<br/>
waste mana trying to nuke it (most melee types are quick to figure it out<br/>
when they don&#39;t swing, but most caster types tend not to read the messages<br/>
and thus don&#39;t see the &quot;protected&quot; bit).<br/>
<br/>
- The trickiest part to using this song is in recharming the mob.  When a<br/>
mob becomes uncharmed, it and whatever it was fighting will all charge and<br/>
attack you.  So it pays to recharm the mob as quickly as possible.<br/>
Charm, order it to attack, then BACK OFF.  The song has a tremedous range<br/>
so you want to be far enough away to give yourself plenty of time to<br/>
recharm as your former pet and the mob it was fighting both charge you.<br/>
Given enough open space or a long enough hallway, it is possible to<br/>
completely avoid taking damage while using this song.<br/>
<br/>
- You can use your songs to help time how long the charm lasts.<br/>
Immediately after re/charming your pet (and making sure it&#39;s attacking the<br/>
right target), start up another song.  If your charm lasts the full<br/>
duration, shortly after your other song pulses twice the charm will<br/>
expire.  You can use this to recharm the mob almost instantly with a bit<br/>
of practice.  You probably don&#39;t want to cut it too close though, since if<br/>
you&#39;re early, the mob will uncharm right after your song pulses, meaning<br/>
it will beat on you for a full song-start-up cycle.<br/>
<br/>
- When recharmed, your pet usually defaults to carrying out its previous<br/>
attack order.  That means you can leave your pet targeted and concentrate<br/>
on other songs instead of retargeting and re-ordering it to attack.  I<br/>
usually heal (Hymn) or prepare to run (Accelerando) while the pet is busy<br/>
attacking.  If I&#39;m in a group, I may sing some party buff songs.<br/>
<br/>
- It wipes the damage list and the hate list (except hatred for the bard).<br/>
This can be used to thwart kill-stealers, but it can also used to kill<br/>
steal so I won&#39;t go into details.  As an anti-kill-stealing tool though,<br/>
it&#39;s most useful for getting casters to dump most or all of their mana on<br/>
what is now your protected pet.  The only caveat is that DoTs seem to give<br/>
damage credit to the caster if it lasts the duration of the charm.  If<br/>
you&#39;re facing a kill-stealing DoTer, you&#39;ll have to cancel magic to cancel<br/>
the DoT.<br/>
<br/>
- It is great for pulling off mobs that have frenzied onto someone else.<br/>
Because it wipes the hate list of everyone but you, it is guaranteed to<br/>
work if it isn&#39;t resisted.  The only exception is if someone is very close<br/>
to dying, in which case nothing I know of (short of healing the person)<br/>
can get mobs off him.  Even orc pawns will attack a high level person who<br/>
is very close to dying.  Clerics and casters love bards who use this song<br/>
to pull mobs off them.<br/>
<br/>
- It&#39;s nice for pulling in casting mobs.  Casters tend to stand their<br/>
ground and nuke you instead of walking into the deathtrap your party has<br/>
set up for it.  If you charm a caster and tell it to &quot;follow me&quot;, it will<br/>
happily follow you right into your party&#39;s blades.  Make sure your party<br/>
is aware that you&#39;re charming it, otherwise they may waste mana trying to<br/>
nuke your pet.<br/>
                         <br/>
- If your party works well together, you can use charm as a substitue for<br/>
Lullaby.  You charm one mob, all the other mobs attack your pet. Your party<br/>
pulls one mob from this group and fights it off to the side.  You keep<br/>
charming to keep the other mobs occupied (usually sacrificing a few pets<br/>
to buy your group time).<br/>
<br/>
- You can cast buffs on pets.  With our short duration charm, I&#39;m not sure<br/>
why you&#39;d want to, but it&#39;s always an option.<br/>
<br/>
- You can cast cancel magic on pets.  If a mob you&#39;re fighting has several<br/>
buffs on it, you can charm it, then let a party member hit it with several<br/>
cancels without it going aggro on him.  This doesn&#39;t work so well with<br/>
casting mobs since they usually just rebuff themselves.  I suppose you<br/>
could try doing this to drain their mana (cancel tends to be a cheap<br/>
spell).<br/>
<br/>
- I&#39;ve heard that if you charm a mob that casts SoW while underground,<br/>
sometimes it will cast SoW on you.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
- Think carefully about which mob you should charm.  For example, the<br/>
mortuary fungus in Unrest is not particularly difficult to kill, nor does<br/>
it do a lot of damage.  But the mort drowsy spell it casts renders all<br/>
melee mobs nearly completely ineffective.  I was able to use a fungus to<br/>
kill a skeletal monk and two barbed bones simultaneously, even though<br/>
monks and barbed bones are much more dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cautions:<br/>
<br/>
- The song tends to have a pretty big taunt effect.  If you&#39;re left with a<br/>
pet with a considerable amount of life left, it will beat on you for quite<br/>
a while as your party attacks it from behind.  A tank can sometimes get it<br/>
off you with a taunt and high-damage hit, but be prepared to really take a<br/>
beating until your party gets the former pet off you.<br/>
<br/>
- You need to have your pet targeted to recharm it, so you can&#39;t really<br/>
help your group or your pet by fighting another mob.  (You can, but<br/>
switching targets can get tricky.)  So just keep your pet targeted, and<br/>
equip an instrument to concentrate on buffing/healing your party instead.<br/>
<br/>
- It&#39;s important to charm and recharm only one mob at a time.  If you<br/>
charm a different one, your former pet will attack you almost exclusively<br/>
until it dies.  So instead of having two mobs attacking each other, you&#39;ll<br/>
wind up with one mob attack a mob that&#39;s attacking you.  This prevents you<br/>
from being able to back off to prepare to recharm.<br/>
<br/>
- Your pet has to be your pet when the mob it was fighting dies in order<br/>
for you to get credit for it.  If your pet becomes uncharmed and your<br/>
party kills its target, the kill goes to what is now an unaffiliated mob,<br/>
and you get no experience and the corpse disappears.  For this reason I<br/>
would not recommend using charmed mobs to kill named mobs, unless you make<br/>
it clear to your group to let the pet make the kill.  Sometimes I&#39;ll order<br/>
a pet to attack a different target every time I recharm it.  That way it<br/>
softens up the horde of mobs, without doing enough damage to any specific<br/>
one to steal the kill.  You get Pixie Strike next level, which is better<br/>
for controling multi-mob (more than two) situations anyway<br/>
<br/>
- Sometimes your pet will attack a party member on its own.  I&#39;m not quite<br/>
sure why this happens, but since it&#39;s a pet, the party member cannot fight<br/>
back.  Give the pet the &quot;/pet back off&quot; ASAP to get it to stop attacking.<br/>
You&#39;ll have to retarget and give a new &quot;/pet attack&quot; order.<br/>
<br/>
- Some mobs are smart enough to attack the master (you) instead of the<br/>
pet.  I found out that evil eyes will do this.  I&#39;ve heard guards do this<br/>
as well, which would make it a bad tactic to charm someone in a duel and<br/>
ordering him to attack a guard.<br/>
<br/>
- This song does not work (well) with the enchanter&#39;s mesmerize.  You can<br/>
charm a mesmerized mob, but you end up with a mesmerized pet that will<br/>
stand there and not respond to commands.<br/>
<br/>
- Your pet may refuse to attack something that is too high level.  Most<br/>
undead do not care about level and will attack anything you order it to<br/>
attack.<br/>
<br/>
- Mobs that are fleeing continue to flee even after charmed.  This is most<br/>
noticable when a pet drops low enough in life that it&#39;ll flee on its own.<br/>
But sometimes (e.g. Mistmoore) you&#39;ll have mobs that flee to call in<br/>
reinforcements.  Charming it will not stop it.  Most undead do not flee<br/>
so they can make better pets.<br/>
<br/>
- You will find that using this song, fighting 2 or 3 mobs at once solo is<br/>
a lot easier than fighting 1 solo.  Don&#39;t make the mistake if thinking<br/>
that because a mob was really easy to kill with a charmed pet, that you&#39;ll<br/>
have an easy time soloing it.<br/>
<br/>
- Don&#39;t charm healing mobs.  During the brief interval between the charm<br/>
expiring and you recharming, they tend to heal anything else your group is<br/>
fighting.<br/>
<br/>
- Do not use this song to pull from a camp.  When you charm it, it picks<br/>
up your faction, and stuff that would attack you (i.e. everything in the<br/>
camp) will attack it.  Furthermore, because it&#39;s probably blue to you,<br/>
stuff that normally wouldn&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re too high level<br/>
*will* attack your pet.<br/>
<br/>
- Do not use this song to pull from a camp if you&#39;ve lulled the others.<br/>
Unless you can instantly hit it with a back-off command, your pet will see<br/>
all these other hostile creatures around it and attack them, defeating the<br/>
purpose of lulling them.<br/>
<br/>
- A lot of players don&#39;t understand that when two mobs fight, it&#39;s usually<br/>
because one is charmed, and they&#39;ll jump in to &quot;your&quot; fight without<br/>
asking.<br/>
<br/>
- The song caps at L37.  You cannot charm mobs L38 or higher.<br/>
Fortunately, most of the &quot;interesting&quot; mobs (giants and such) fall below<br/>
this limit.<br/>
