&gt; Went to get my Shin Gauntlets and Greaves for Lambent yesterday. I wish I<br/>
&gt; had gone 13 levels ago (as soon as I got Sonorous Clouding). When I walked<br/>
&gt; into lower Guk, turned the first corner, see Shin Corpse on ground, click,<br/>
&gt; greaves. Joined a group in the bedroom and killed Undead Shin Knights, 2nd<br/>
&gt; knight, gloves. (forgive me if I have switched these, can&#39;t remember which<br/>
&gt; dropped what)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, My advice to young bards, Get a map, enter Guk, go invis, trot down to<br/>
&gt; Lower Guk and wait. I could have looted 2 more gloves and greaves from<br/>
&gt; corpses at the exit. Plus, even if you can&#39;t complete the quests just yet,<br/>
&gt; the gloves(AC 7,+5poison Wt5) and greaves(AC 10,+5disease,Wt7.7) are nice<br/>
&gt; (plus they look cool).<br/>

&gt; 	Excellent advice Uldar, I got mine at 16 when I was fighting Heart<br/>
&gt; Spiders for silk and xp.  When I got poisoned I just ran down to Lower<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt; playing Hymn.  having never killed a froggie, and not being agnostic (they<br/>
&gt; hate people who can&#39;t decide apparently) the frogloks all ignored me.  Got<br/>
&gt; both Shin items for free which was a decent armor upgrade in the case of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; greaves from my barbed legs.  Also got several fine steel weapons no one<br/>
&gt; wanted.<br/>
