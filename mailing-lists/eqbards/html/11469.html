<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787959154">As the traditional definition of the two terms yes. In game it seems that<br/>
infravision only tends to increase contrast. I remember when I was young in<br/>
East Commonlands that at night the skeletons were easy to see since they<br/>
were light in color but the bears were almost impossible to spot.<br/>

Infra vision outlines Warm bodies and objects  in a light red haze.<br/>
Ultravision lets you see better in the dark makes everythign bright, with a<br/>
blue tinge. much better than infra<br/>

But what&#39;s the difference between Ultravision and Infravision..<br/>
