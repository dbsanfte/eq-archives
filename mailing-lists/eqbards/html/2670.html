<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919938818">So we are all real good online Bards and have excellent musical abilities to<br/>
the point of powerful magic, etc.  But what about in /ooc real life? Anyone<br/>
have any talent or interest?<br/>

p.s. in 5th grade public school, the music teacher got so frustrated with my<br/>
inability to start a song on his &#39;downbeat&#39; or whatever you call it, he<br/>
snatched the tone block off my desk and never let me try again.  I generally<br/>
hate to sing in public - I am tone deaf and totally lack any rythmn.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;you miss beat, your song abruptly ends&quot;  has been the story of my r/l<br/>
musical ventures - I do have a nice stereo &lt;g&gt;</div>
