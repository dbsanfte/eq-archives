&gt; Only problem with that is, you&#39;re going to be awfully tired of lower guk<br/>
&gt; by your mid-late 40&#39;s. Personally, I&#39;d put off going there until<br/>
&gt; everywhere else you can possibly hunt is green. At mid-high 30&#39;s I think<br/>
&gt; the king room in perma is still quite blue. I&#39;m not sure when the exp<br/>
&gt; tapers off in the king and other deep areas in Sol A, but I&#39;d check<br/>
&gt; there. Both of these places require good parties before you go though.<br/>
