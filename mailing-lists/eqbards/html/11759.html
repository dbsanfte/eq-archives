<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776639789">Note: As difficult as Verant is finding it to get up servers as fast as they<br/>
get new players, maybe player retention is NOT their highest priority. There<br/>
are cases where you don&#39;t WANT as much business as you have got. I know I<br/>
have left organizations in the past because they got Too Big. The<br/>
organization as a whole would have done better to discourage people from<br/>
joining so that those present could have more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Do not assume More always = better.<br/>
<br/>
Verant may be interested in ending up with a solid player base of people who<br/>
want to play the same type of game that THEY want to put out. NOT just in<br/>
ending up with a huge player base. They very likely would be just as happy<br/>
if many of the IDIOTS out there who don&#39;t want to play their game would just<br/>
go away.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve seen some of the types of questions/complaints Guides get. There are<br/>
some people out there you have to wonder why they are playing Everquest)<br/>

&gt;The &#39;absolute&#39; part is debatable - imho.   We have heard snippets of &quot;we<br/>
&gt;were shocked that players got level 50 in xx days played...&quot; makes me think<br/>
&gt;that they (Verant) are concerned with &#39;how hard&#39; it is to make levels, etc.<br/>
&gt;Like why have hell levels? If they want to have some kind of milestone, it<br/>
&gt;should be a positive re-enforcement - not a negative.  If they want to<br/>
&gt;retain players, that is. More than half of my friends who I started this<br/>
&gt;game with have pretty much ended their EQ careers because it got to be just<br/>
&gt;too hard (and too boring) to make progress.  In short, it was no fun any<br/>
&gt;more.  A few others have made level 50 - the level of nothing to do. And so<br/>
&gt;they re-start chars in other classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here are 2 scenarios:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;EQ-X: hard to play.  Serious players make lev 50. It takes you 6 months of<br/>
&gt;concentrated playing. You start a couple twinks and play them to upper 20&#39;s<br/>
&gt;and a new game comes out somewhere else that is more fun than then next 10<br/>
&gt;levels killing aviaks. So you semi-retire your 50 and maybe do occasional<br/>
&gt;dragons.  But then you get sick of all the guild email about stuff<br/>
&gt;you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;care for and you quit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;EQ-Z: fun to play.  Still quite a challenge but acceptable to the<br/>
&gt;people who<br/>
&gt;want to play 2 or 3  hours at a session and still do pretty good.  So they<br/>
&gt;make level 50 in 5 months.  And then start a new char of a different class<br/>
&gt;or try a char on a Race War team or PvP server.  Things are challenging but<br/>
&gt;still fun - not frustration.  So they get this next char to 50 in 3 months.<br/>
&gt;And then they decide to start another char and see if they can do<br/>
&gt;it without<br/>
&gt;twinking and do some role playing. Now they are good for another couple<br/>
&gt;months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Retention rate of your customer base is gonna depend on the fun<br/>
&gt;factor - and<br/>
&gt;that will be the &#39;absolute&#39; of all absolutes.  This is after all the<br/>
&gt;entertainment business.  When it&#39;s no longer entertaining, you are out of<br/>
&gt;business.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;		The problem with adding/removing things purely on the basis<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;		&quot;fun&quot; is that for the most part, it looks at only the<br/>
&gt;relative<br/>
&gt;		side of things (will the players be happier after the change<br/>
&gt;		than before?).  Unfortunately, the prisoner&#39;s dilemma and<br/>
&gt;		tragedy of the commons are very real, and thus create<br/>
&gt;		situations where stuff that makes the players unhappy can be<br/>
&gt;		better for the game.<br/>
