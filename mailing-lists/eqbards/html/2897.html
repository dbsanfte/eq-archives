&gt;      Level 5: Selo&#39;s Accelerando<br/>
&gt;      Effects: PARTY: Increases Movement and Stamina<br/>
&gt;      level), you run faster than someone with the popular Spirit<br/>
&gt;      of the Wolf spell. As you get higher in level, you will<br/>
&gt;      gradually run faster. By the time you reach the mid 40&#39;s in<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Druids in wolf form naturally run at SoW, but cannot cast SoC<br/>
&gt; on themselves.  I&#39;m curious what happens if you&#39;re grouped<br/>
&gt; with a druid in wolf form and you play Accelerando.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You end up with a very slow moving wolf when Selos stops. :)  I<br/>
tested this with a druid friend of mine last night.  Too bad...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      Level 12: Brusco&#39;s Boastful Bellow<br/>
&gt;      Effects: SINGLE: 1-7 points damage<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The damage range should be corrected in lieu of the formula<br/>
&gt; (level/2 + 1).  This song is nice early on, but IMHO bards get<br/>
&gt; too dependent on it and keep using it well after it pretty<br/>
&gt; much becomes ineffective.  At my level, 13 damage every 5<br/>
&gt; seconds (15 seconds if you&#39;re twisting) is pretty much<br/>
&gt; negligible in a party where each member is hitting for an<br/>
&gt; average of 10-70 points every 2-4 seconds.  I&#39;ve been fooling<br/>
&gt; around with substituting Discord in place of it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d give it a try - when I&#39;m soloing, my general twisting songs are<br/>
Jonathans, Discord, and Melodic Binding - I attack faster, the mob<br/>
is easier to hit, and he swings at me slower - Sounds like a good combo<br/>
to me.  And, I *believe* Discord does more over the ticks than one<br/>
bellow will do.  Keep forgetting to check it on someone.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;      Effects: NON-PARTY: Damage & -AC<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      or he will start attacking you. When you first get this song,<br/>
&gt;      and play it with an instrument, expect to 19 points damage<br/>
&gt;      and drop AC by 19 (with a 50 brass skill). When fighting<br/>
&gt;      multiple monsters, you will actually do more damage with<br/>
&gt;      this song than using your melee weapon. The hard part is<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that&#39;s an important point most bards are overlooking.<br/>
&gt; This song is awesome.  I played around with twisting it,<br/>
&gt; Dissonance, and either Chain or Restoration, and the fights<br/>
&gt; went about as easily as when I&#39;m using weapons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love this song, but its blessing and curse is that its also a great<br/>
taunt.  Perfect when soloing, but when fighting multiple mobs in<br/>
a party, I&#39;d much rather have an enchanter around to mesmerize<br/>
them than have them all pound on me.  Of course, the latter usually<br/>
ends up happening, since enchanters are hard to find.  Thank<br/>
goodness for clerics and paladins lay hands! :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      Level 20: Largo&#39;s Melodic Binding<br/>
&gt;      Effects: NON-PARTY: -Attack SPD & AC<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Analysis: Song effects are obvious, reducing attack speed<br/>
&gt;      and AC of monsters and NPCs. This song is one of the<br/>
&gt;      more dangerous a bard can sing. Monsters hate this song,<br/>
&gt;      but not as much as the level 18 Denon&#39;s Disruptive Discord.<br/>
&gt;      The attack speed of the monster will visibly slow down<br/>
&gt;      under the effects of this song. In most cases, however, the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I timed this on a fire beetle and got a 23% slowdown in their<br/>
&gt; attack speed at L24.  I tried it on an orc warrior and got the<br/>
&gt; exact same results (funny how both an orc warrior and fire<br/>
&gt; beetle attack once every 3.0 seconds...).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bless you for testing all this stuff.  :)  Its good to know my gut<br/>
reactions and instincts often prove correct on song choices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;      Level 22: Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody<br/>
&gt;      Effects: PARTY: Cancel Magic<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Unconfirmed Analysis: This song now works, and turns out<br/>
&gt;      to be better than the Cancel Magic spell that spell casters<br/>
&gt;      get. This song supposedly will get rid of all DoT and<br/>
&gt;      de-buffs that have been cast upon a party, but will leave all<br/>
&gt;      of your buffs intact. Very useful, and what Cancel Magic<br/>
&gt;      should have been. Note: this song will not cure disease or<br/>
&gt;      get rid of charm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had a chance to try it on another DoT.  It did *nothing*.<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have *any* idea what this song does?  From the<br/>
&gt; name I&#39;m starting to think that maybe it only nullifies charm.<br/>
&gt; The question also remains whether you play the song to remove<br/>
&gt; the effect, or if you play it continuously to avoid being hit<br/>
&gt; by the effect in the first place.  The fact that it puts an<br/>
&gt; icon on your screen for 3 pulses seems to suggest the latter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to be really dissapointed if I hit 22 and the necro pkers<br/>
can still drain me and my friends.  I had always thought it killed<br/>
DoTs too.   Has anyone tried feedbacking or bugging this?  If they<br/>
respond, chances are they&#39;d at least tell us it is or isn&#39;t working<br/>
correctly - then we&#39;d just have to figure out how to correctly use it. :)<br/>
