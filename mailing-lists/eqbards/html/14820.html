<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389039535">Got my SharkSkin Drums tonight.  Many thanks to the Twelve Year Guild on<br/>
Cazic-Thule.  <br/>
<br/>
The SharkSkin Drums are found on a named Mermaid called Coralyn Kelpma. She<br/>
spawns past Estrella, just to the right of the 5 StingTooths in the Ceiling<br/>
and right outside of the Seahorse Caves. A normal Gloomwater is her<br/>
placeholder. We came upon her by accident as she spawned 20 min after we<br/>
killed her placeholder. I had never heard of her before. Now I wonder what<br/>
her rare loot is. Grin. She looks like she is equipped with a lute when she<br/>
has these. <br/>
<br/>
I have tested the Drums. They are infact better than the Mistmoore Drums. I<br/>
do not have Selos drums to test against. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the test results from a 47 bard singing Elemental Rythms. The<br/>
number represents the point increase for the cold/fire/magic resist. <br/>
<br/>
+28 = no instrument just singing <br/>
+50 = normal hand drum <br/>
+58 = Mistmoore Battle Drums <br/>
+61 = SharkSkin Drums <br/>
<br/>
Judging from this Mistmoore drums give a 16% increase over normal drums. And<br/>
SharkSkin Drums give a 22% increase over normal drums. Testing with a couple<br/>
other songs also shows a slight increase when using the SharkSkin vs using<br/>
the Mistmoore. <br/>
<br/>
In Addition Selos speed seems slightly enhanced (actually easier to see a<br/>
slight slow down when going from Sharkskin down to Mistmoore). I feel very<br/>
happy running with these. A visually subjective test with Encumbrance seems<br/>
to indicate they are at least as good as Mist Drums in dealing with<br/>
Encumbrance and Selos running. <br/>
<br/>
All in All great Drums and ultra-rare. I shall keep these over the Selo&#39;s<br/>
Drums, even though Selos is likely better. <br/>
<br/>
The Icon looks like a lute. When equipped it looks like a lute as well. The<br/>
nice thing about this is that when running with selos I actually strum a<br/>
lute instead of a flute. Unfortunately I may mistake the icon for the Lute<br/>
of the Gyspy Princess sometimes when switching instruments as they appear<br/>
the same.  <br/>
<br/>
I Don&#39;t really read this onelist.  Just posting for a heads up and to place<br/>
in the Archives.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck getting yours. I love Kedge! <br/>
