<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173820672">I wanted to write and thank the list for all the crowd control tips <br/>
that have been shared over hte last few months.  I don&#39;t get to play <br/>
to often so I depend on this list and boards for fighting tips with my <br/>
bard so I don&#39;t have to go totally from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
Last night in Cazic Thule I was in the Throne Room. I am a level 30 <br/>
bard in Full Lambent my Charisma is about 145-150.  We had been there <br/>
about 45 minutes and our Enchanter had to leave. Someone in teh group <br/>
said &quot;No problem the Bard can handle crowd control.&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy... the last time I tried this (before mezz was fixed) I got the <br/>
group killed.  After I got my hot keys arranged with Charm, Pixie <br/>
Strike and other hot keys I went to work.<br/>
<br/>
Since we had the room broken the most that came was 3 pulls. So I <br/>
would charm 1 and attack another and keep them busy while the group <br/>
finished off the toughest monster. I would try to weave in healing or <br/>
Anthem before Charm broke. Then the group would finish off the most <br/>
dead 1 I was handling while I charmed the other to attack.<br/>
<br/>
I must say charm (in this case) worked so much better than mezz for <br/>
me. I was able to affectively keep 2 mobs busy and never got below <br/>
half health the entire time.<br/>
<br/>
So again thanks for the tips on crowd control. They were very helpful <br/>
as all I had to do was get my hot keys in order and go to town. :-)<br/>
