<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140878469"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok and hmm replying to my own message, all of a sudden the sponsor stuff is<br/>
at the top of my emails.  Is this a change or is it cuz i upgraded to<br/>
Outlook 2000?  If its the latter, anyone know how to fix it?<br/>

You&#39;ll just have to put up with it like the rest of us, I&#39;m afraid.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s more to do with egroups than with your mail client.  I use Outlook &#39;98<br/>
and it&#39;s the same.<br/>

On the bright side, you learn to ignore it after a while.</div>
