<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275309602">ouch, no wonder you are getting wacked.  Your group needs to realize now,<br/>
instead of latter, that a real tank is a must.  Rangers are good secondary<br/>
tanks, but are very bad at primary tanking.  Fortunatly is seems your core<br/>
group is still low enough level where you can power up a real tank<br/>
(preferably a Warrior) up to your level range if you all work together on<br/>
this.  Once your cleric hits 29 the run back is a moot point as you will<br/>
just get a revive.  But please do yourself and your group of friends a favor<br/>
and convince one of them to start a warrior, otherwise all of you will be<br/>
feeling the pain in a serious way in another 5-6 levels.   Trust me on this<br/>
my orginal guild kind of fell apart due to the lack of any real tanks (lots<br/>
of rangers though).  And the eventually the level split in the guild lead to<br/>
over recruiting, which always leads to a guild in crisis.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree on the cleric, but unfortunately we only have two <br/>
&gt; around my level<br/>
&gt; and one is a butt-head.  Generally the pullers bring back 1-3 <br/>
&gt; mobs which<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t too bad.  Occasionally mobs will spawn in the spots <br/>
&gt; they bring the<br/>
&gt; pull back thru which leads to the bad pulls.  I have tried <br/>
&gt; pulling but with<br/>
&gt; no speed running and the pulling distances what they are in <br/>
&gt; Sol A generally<br/>
&gt; I am usually down to a bubble or two when I get back to the <br/>
&gt; group.  I can<br/>
&gt; generally do a better job of splitting the mobs though ;-).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am the tank unfortunately.  Its just me, and another bard generally.<br/>
&gt; Occasionally we have a ranger but that&#39;s it.  Our guild is <br/>
&gt; all made up of<br/>
&gt; fairly casual players and no one else is willing to put up <br/>
&gt; with 20+ minute<br/>
&gt; runs every time they die so they all quit their melee <br/>
&gt; characters some time<br/>
&gt; ago and play casters now.  Our entire guild has about 30 <br/>
&gt; members I think.<br/>
&gt; Less than a third are non-casters.  In truth I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; generally see anywhere<br/>
&gt; near as many non-casters in general.  The melee types I do <br/>
&gt; see are nearly<br/>
&gt; always either twinks or quickly level out of my range because <br/>
&gt; they play far<br/>
&gt; more time than I do.  Even our ranger remarked that he gave <br/>
&gt; up hitting the<br/>
&gt; taunt button if I was singing hymn.  It just didn&#39;t matter he <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t taunt<br/>
&gt; anything off me after about 1 minute of fighting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Believe me, for Rp-ing reasons I want to pay my bard more <br/>
&gt; than any other<br/>
&gt; character.  This is the only list I even bother to read <br/>
&gt; anymore because it<br/>
&gt; is so far beyond the other&#39;s in terms of good tips, great debates, and<br/>
&gt; generally fun people that I quit all the others.  I just <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t get to have<br/>
&gt; much fun playing my bard anymore.  I had one really great <br/>
&gt; nite in Sol A.<br/>
&gt; The next three times I went it was pretty bad.  The last <br/>
&gt; time, I got 1/2 a<br/>
&gt; bubble of experience in 3 hours.  I spent the entire time <br/>
&gt; running, dying,<br/>
&gt; running back to zone, fleeing some other groups train, <br/>
&gt; running from a bad<br/>
&gt; pull, etc.  I would have actually had minus xp for the <br/>
&gt; evening had I not<br/>
&gt; been resurrected by a passing 50th cleric on his way into Sol B.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately he got there at the same time I did, so xp was <br/>
&gt; the only thing<br/>
&gt; I saved.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you get to play only 2 hours or less most times you sit <br/>
&gt; down, that 20<br/>
&gt; minute penalty for dying becomes quite huge.  The night I <br/>
&gt; died 3 times I got<br/>
&gt; to actually play for less than 30 minute.  the rest of my <br/>
&gt; time was spent<br/>
&gt; running back to my corpse.  Only one of those deaths was <br/>
&gt; avoidable, the rest<br/>
&gt; were the result of being trained by another group or lone wolf.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kit, <br/>
&gt; If I ever met a cleric with an attidude like that (ie let <br/>
&gt; some one die to<br/>
&gt; prove a point) I would quickly add him/her to my no group <br/>
&gt; list.  It sound to<br/>
&gt; me you need to teach the pullers in your groups that pulling does not<br/>
&gt; meaning bringing a train of 4-6 mobs back to the group.  If <br/>
&gt; they can&#39;t do it<br/>
&gt; I suggest you take over the pulling duties and show them how <br/>
&gt; it is done.<br/>

&gt; PS Also you may want to teach the &#39;tanks&#39; to hit the tuant button :)<br/>
