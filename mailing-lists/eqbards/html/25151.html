<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632634397">I know a few couples who have wished for the ability to move chars to other<br/>
accounts for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Most notably couples where one person have started playing and then the<br/>
girlfriend/boyfriend have seen him/her play and started a char on the same<br/>
account.. Maybe even leveled all the way to 60th..<br/>
I think the high price and the fact that both accounts is to be owned and<br/>
charged by the same creditcard will limit the transfers..<br/>
Also the naked transfer policy from server to server will most likely keep<br/>
the moving down..<br/>

&gt; Seems to me that with what they are charging - it&#39;s going to <br/>
&gt; be a &quot;profit<br/>
&gt; center&quot; for Verant.  I&#39;m concerned that Bards will be the <br/>
&gt; type of character<br/>
&gt; where we&#39;ll see significant E-Bay&#39;ers.  I expect to see a lot <br/>
&gt; of bards in SS<br/>
&gt; and POG armor with no idea how the songs work - let alone twisting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t really understand the mentality.  I know I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; alone in feeling<br/>
&gt; the early levels could be among the most fun - and learning <br/>
&gt; the class was a<br/>
&gt; blast.  I really enjoy getting tells from people who&#39;ve found <br/>
&gt; me randomly<br/>
&gt; with esoteric questions about being a bard - and stuff that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; rarely used<br/>
&gt; (had one recently about the Identify Magic song).<br/>
