<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746886367"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The problem appears to be fixed now so the point is moot, but I think that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;totally absurd that they encourage begging and twinking when it&#39;s extremely<br/>
&gt;easy to see what level you are, and that you don&#39;t have any food, water or<br/>
&gt;at the least, a default weapon. Now, if the GM&#39;s giving you your items back<br/>
&gt;requires that they come to you, and trade the items to you then I can<br/>
&gt;understand them not wanting to travel for hours to hundreds of people doing<br/>
&gt;that. But if it&#39;s just a matter of typing something like &quot;give equip #104<br/>
&gt;player_name&quot; then there&#39;s no reason for them not to have done it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, with the additional point that if the GM&#39;s think its too much<br/>
trouble to come and trade the items to me, then they should not be a GM,<br/>
because they either volunteered for the spot or they get paid for it.<br/>
Thankfully, the problem does seem to be over :)<br/>

&gt;My main complaint (sorry, ranting here a bit) now is that on Veeshan (and<br/>
&gt;other servers) it seems that we get a 2 minute warning whenever the server<br/>
&gt;is going to go down. Last night a GM comes on and makes an announcement that<br/>
&gt;the server is coming down - log off now. About a minute later he makes<br/>
&gt;another announcement. Then less than a minute later the server goes down.<br/>
&gt;Now excuse the heck out of me, but what about people in the middle of<br/>
&gt;seriously hard fights or deep in a dangerous dungeon? How about fighting in<br/>
&gt;the water in the Oasis? They&#39;re supposed to leave the fight, get out of the<br/>
&gt;water sit and camp (without being chased & attacked) within a minute or two?<br/>
&gt;Methinks not. My aggrivation comes after having sat on the boat for 20<br/>
&gt;minutes, hitting the final zone to my destination and then the server going<br/>
&gt;down before I could reach the dock or jump in the water. Server comes back<br/>
&gt;up and guess what.. I&#39;m in the OOT zone heading back to where I started,<br/>
&gt;looking forward to another 30-40 minutes on the dang boat. Grrr.. A 10<br/>
&gt;minute warning is all I ask. Is that so much? People on other servers said<br/>
&gt;they get that, why can&#39;t Veeshan-ians?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ouch, that hurts.  For what it&#39;s worth, Brell players got the same kind of<br/>
notice that Veeshan players did:  hardly any notice at all,  I remember it<br/>
being something like &quot;WORLD IS COMING DOWN, GET TO SAFETY AND LOG OFF NOW.&quot;<br/>
 Sheesh.  <br/>
