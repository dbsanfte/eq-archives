<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194786043">Well after all we knew the real reason for the emergency patch wasn&#39;t likely<br/>
to be related to fixing a gameplay issue unless it was to protect an uber<br/>
mob.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard that his 2000pt lifetap (or whatever the number is) doesn&#39;t hit<br/>
you if you have a magic skin up.  I&#39;ve also heard that its being patched<br/>
today.<br/>

bah hehe, yes and rogue legs too (they have 50 mana LOL).  VS seems to be<br/>
the leg guy.  i heard the cazic-thule server killed him as well yesterday,<br/>
so if word spreads how to kill him he&#39;ll probably be buffed soon.  but not<br/>
before we get another legs after today&#39;s patch =)  the 56 bard in my guild<br/>
got those legs, he&#39;s also the guild leader and plays a bit more than me and<br/>
has tons of points to use on loot.  i had won the RBB at Vox right before we<br/>
did VS.  i knew for a fact if i used my points on the RBB that those legs<br/>
would drop.<br/>
